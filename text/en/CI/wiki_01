<text>Gerard Ryan (4 June 1956 – 30 April 2010) was an Irish presenter of radio and television employed by Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ). He presented &quot;The Gerry Ryan Show&quot; on radio station RTÉ 2fm each weekday morning from 1988 until hours before his sudden death. He was presented with a Jacob&#x27;s Award for this show in 1990.

Ryan hosted several series of television shows, including &quot;Secrets&quot;, &quot;Gerry Ryan Tonight&quot;, &quot;Ryantown&quot;, &quot;Gerry Ryan&#x27;s Hitlist&quot;, &quot;Ryan Confidential&quot; and the first three series of &quot;Operation Transformation&quot;. In 1987, he earned notoriety and the moniker &quot;Lambo&quot; after an unpleasant incident in Connemara. He was also noted for co-presenting, with Cynthia Ní Mhurchú, Eurovision Song Contest 1994 and, in 2008, presenting an edition of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, television&#x27;s longest-running chat show, in place of the then regular host Pat Kenny. An autobiography, &quot;Would the Real Gerry Ryan Please Stand Up&quot;, was published in October 2008.

He married Morah Brennan in 1988 and they had five children: Lottie, Rex, Bonnie, Elliott and Babette. In 1997, Morah famously telephoned her husband&#x27;s show and, under the name Norah, told half a million listeners intimate details concerning his personal household habits. Gerry and Morah announced their separation in March 2008. He soon began a relationship with the former South African Ambassador to Ireland and the then UNICEF Ireland executive director, Melanie Verwoerd.

Ryan was found dead in his Dublin home on 30 April 2010.

==Early life==
Ryan was born in Dublin in 1956. He described his father, Vinnie, as a &quot;slightly eccentric&quot; dentist from a Presbyterian background and his mother, Maureen (née Burke), as &quot;a flamboyant woman&quot; who came from a theatrical background and worked in the theatre. His godfather was broadcaster Eamonn Andrews. He learnt to shoot with Charles Haughey&#x27;s children. He had two brothers, Michael and Vincent. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s College, Raheny, and later studied Law at Trinity College Dublin. Ryan&#x27;s mother died on Christmas Day 2006.

==Career==
===Early career===
Early in his career, Ryan was involved part-time in pirate radio – presenting a selection of programmes firstly for Alternative Radio Dublin (ARD) and then for Big D. When RTÉ Radio 2 (now RTÉ 2fm) was launched in 1979, Ryan joined RTÉ as a DJ where he presented a selection of speech- and music-based programmes, including &quot;Here Comes the Weekend&quot; on Friday nights and &quot;Saturday Scene&quot; on Saturday mornings, which earned him £78 per week. Ryan then moved to a night-time music show called &#x27;Lights out&#x27; which accompanied Mark Cagney&#x27;s grown-up album programme and Dave Fanning&#x27;s &quot;The Rock Show&quot; as part of Radio 2&#x27;s night-time line-up. The trio brought their shows on tour around Ireland. Ryan said they dressed as if they were in a band and behaved as such as well, booking into &quot;awful hotels&quot;, drinking heavily and staying out late in &quot;dodgy nightclubs&quot;. Their excessive talking has led to Ryan dubbing them &quot;the three big-mouths on at night-time&quot;. They were good friends; Fanning was &quot;a kind of hyperactive, Southside rock guru&quot; and Cagney was &quot;this obsessive, meticulous Corkman who would annotate every single millisecond of what he played on-air&quot;. The trio also started to put on live shows, some of which Ryan described as being attended by crowds of 20,000.

===&quot;Lambo&quot; incident===
In 1987, Ryan and a group of volunteers spent time in the countryside of Connemara as part of &quot;The Gay Byrne Show&quot;. Ryan claimed to have killed and eaten a lamb to survive, earning him the nickname &quot;Lambo&quot;, though the story turned out to be a hoax. The incident has been adapted for the stage.

===The Gerry Ryan Show===

Ryan&#x27;s style was considered by some to be that of a motor-mouth shock jock. &quot;The Gerry Ryan Show&quot; was subject to several upheld complaints to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI), although once escaped punishment when he said &quot;Would it be considered blasphemous if someone said on air that &#x27;God is a bollocks?&#x27;&quot;. Ryan was noted for the enjoyment he took in discussing topics such as sex, bodily functions, and food – as well as current social and political issues. Disgraced former PR guru Max Clifford claimed, after Ryan&#x27;s death, he could have, like Graham Norton and Terry Wogan, had a successful broadcasting career in the UK and said he was similar to &quot;Michael Parkinson at his best&quot;.

&quot;The Gerry Ryan Show&quot;, began in March 1988 when he was offered a three-hour morning radio slot. &quot;The G. Ryan Show&quot;, running from 09:00–12:00 on weekday mornings, consisted of interviews and phone-ins via the &quot;Ryan Line&quot;. Each morning he would begin by discussing the headlines of that morning&#x27;s newspapers. Following the news update at 10:00, Ryan would introduce that morning&#x27;s &quot;Nob Nation&quot;, a satirical slot which featured impersonations of politicians and RTÉ media personnel comparable to rival station Today FM&#x27;s &quot;Gift Grub&quot;. Ryan presented RTÉ 2fm&#x27;s only show which was regularly among the top twenty Irish radio shows in Ireland, a show which commanded around €4–5 million for RTÉ per annum, mainly through advertising (one thirty-second advertisement during the show cost €900). This meant RTÉ would have earned €27,000 through advertising from Ryan per day.

In October 1990, Ryan received a Jacob&#x27;s Award for &quot;The Gerry Ryan Show&quot;, described at the award ceremony as &quot;unbelievably bizarre and unprecedented – and at the same time being serious, hilarious and unpredictable&quot;.

The defining moment of the show came in 1993, when a rape victim, Lavinia Kerwick, rang &quot;GRS&quot; to air her feelings. For the first time it occurred to Ryan that the story was more important than the question. Since then &quot;The Ryan Show&quot; became something of a national institution as the oldest show still running on 2fm. Despite repeated reshuffles which have seen all other presenters shifted around, RTÉ have never moved &quot;The Ryan Show&quot; from its traditional slot.

In 1997, Ryan&#x27;s wife Morah, from whom he later separated, telephoned her husband&#x27;s show and, under the name Norah, told half a million listeners that her husband dumps his underpants on the floor before hopping into bed every night, doesn&#x27;t put his clothes on hangers, had not cleaned the dog&#x27;s mess from the back yard for weeks and never puts the rubbish out for the dustbin men. When she was done she asked her husband: &quot;You would do that now, wouldn&#x27;t you Gerry?&quot; The interview was nearing its finish when he realised what was happening after hearing his crew laughing in the Montrose control room. An embarrassed Ryan informed his listeners: &quot;This is my wife talking&quot;.

In 2004, Ryan caused uproar when he cancelled an interview with the Taoiseach of the time, Bertie Ahern at very short notice.

British broadcaster Chris Evans credited &quot;The Gerry Ryan Show&quot; with inspiring him to return to radio broadcasting after a long absence while on a holiday in Killarney.

===Television career===

Ryan hosted several series of television shows during his career.

Ryan hosted School Around the Corner from 1990 to 1994.

&quot;Secrets&quot; was a popular Saturday night show which was not well received by critics. Producer Kevin Linehan, was removed from the show to work on the Millstreet Eurovision and asked Ryan to co-present the event with Fionnuala Sweeney. They later met and Linehan informed Ryan that RTÉ had objected to his proposal. He did, however, co-present the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest alongside Cynthia Ní Mhurchú where he had the honour of introducing Riverdance as the interval act.

He had watched Michael Flatley and Jean Butler put the act together, choreographing it and rehearsing it &quot;fifty or sixty times&quot; and later wrote of being offered the opportunity to invest a stake of £20,000 in the act. Ryan turned it down, a decision he later admitted regretting. Ní Mhurchú later credited Ryan with telling her to not take herself too seriously. After Pat Kenny decided to stop commentating on the Contest in 1999, Ryan was the favourite to succeed him as Irish Commentator. Although the position was fulfilled by his friend Marty Whelan.

He described &quot;Ryantown&quot; as &quot;the worst television experience I&#x27;ve ever had in my entire life&quot;, with producer Julie Parsons (who had previously worked on &quot;The Gay Byrne Hour&quot;) nearly having a nervous breakdown, according to Ryan. He described RTÉ as &quot;extremely unhelpful&quot;. &quot;Suggestions would arrive at our production meetings: maybe Gerry should wear a hat. Maybe Gerry should sit down. Maybe Gerry should run around more.&quot; Ryan unsuccessfully pleaded with RTÉ to cancel midway through the series. &quot;Gerry Ryan Tonight&quot; was a chat show that aired two nights per week. Ryan describes it as &quot;no less traumatic&quot; as it nearly cost him his close personal friendship with the producer Ferdia McAnna.

&quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; was an amateur talent show in 1999.

Ryan was touted to be the successor to Gay Byrne following his departure from &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. Reports that Ryan was to be made producer as well as presenter and given a deal worth £500,000 – higher earnings than Byrne received – proved unfounded when Pat Kenny took over the role in 1999.

Later television work included &quot;Gerry Ryan&#x27;s Hitlist&quot;, &quot;Ryan Confidential&quot;, and &quot;Operation Transformation&quot;. Ryan wrote in his 2008 autobiography that his critics were not as vocal any more, although he put this down to them &quot;mostly... ignoring me&quot;. He is also noted for presenting &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on 24 October 2008 when regular presenter Pat Kenny became bereaved.

In positive notices unusual as per his television career, Ryan received praise for his guest role, even coping well with the traditionally difficult comedian Tommy Tiernan whose appearances on the show with Kenny led to complaints. The edition of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; that he hosted had the largest audience of any that season apart from the annual edition of &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot;.

The &quot;Evening Herald&quot; reported that when &quot;Tonight with Craig Doyle&quot; finished, Ryan was set to present a chat show in autumn 2010.

===Autobiography===
In the early part of 2008, Ryan announced that he had been contracted by Penguin to write his autobiography. The €100,000 advance paid by Penguin to Ryan was reported to be the largest ever paid for a book published in Ireland. &quot;Would the Real Gerry Ryan Please Stand Up&quot; was released to Irish readers on 16 October 2008. In January 2009, it was reported that the book had sold just over 10,000 copies.

===Earnings===
Ryan earned €487,492 from RTÉ in 2004, making him the second highest paid presenter to colleague Pat Kenny. He earned €462,442 in 2003, and €601,882 in 2002. RTÉ offered Ryan a new five-year contract worth €600,000 a year in July 2007. Ryan said that just before this he came very close to signing a deal with Denis O&#x27;Brien to present a daytime programme on Newstalk which was about to go national. He was offered several millions more than RTÉ were offering him. Ryan considered the deal, thinking of how one of his best friends Willie O&#x27;Reilly was head of sister station Today FM and was heavily involved with the other stations. However negotiations fell apart as Ryan cautioned on how delicate the situation was, with RTÉ looking at his contract and deciding if he was of value to them any more. O&#x27;Brien allegedly disappeared and Ryan was told he was out of coverage. The irony was not lost on him – &quot;pretty incredible for a guy who owns most of the world&#x27;s mobile telephones&quot;. O&#x27;Brien did eventually return but Ryan had already signed the RTÉ contract.

In February 2009, Ryan refused to take a 10% pay cut from RTÉ, even as several other employees in RTÉ took such pay cuts, and declared it &quot;bullshit&quot;. On 10 March 2009 he gave a lengthy speech on his radio show, at the end of which he declared he would agree to break his existing contract with RTÉ, and take a pay cut. He was not technically a member of RTÉ staff but was paid through a separate company, enabling Ryan and RTÉ to avoid paying as much tax on his salary.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Ryan was married for 26 years to his wife Morah, with whom he had five children, including Lottie.

When he worked for the pirate radio station Big D, Morah helped him with his programme. She helped her future husband put the music together and carry the equipment. He paid her £3 out of the £15 he earned.

When they first married, the Ryans had very little money. Pat Kenny gave up a bed for Ryan and his wife to use while on honeymoon in Greece. Ryan obtained a mortgage by lying about his salary and bought a little house in Marino.
In March 2008, Ryan announced he and Morah were separating and called the separation &quot;a very painful experience&quot;.

Later in 2008, he began a relationship with the former South African Ambassador to Ireland, and later UNICEF Ireland executive director, Melanie Verwoerd. In 2011, Verwoerd said she was &quot;deeply shocked&quot; to have been sacked from the charity because of the publicity surrounding her relationship with the broadcaster.

===Health===
Ryan spent several days on a drip in hospital in 2006 due to dehydration after contracting the winter vomiting bug.
He also underwent a much-publicised vasectomy which resulted in an infected wound.

After his drug-related death in 2010, reports about Ryan&#x27;s cocaine use surfaced. Ryan&#x27;s former sister-in-law, Janice O&#x27;Brien said: &quot;Many people who knew Gerry knew he took drugs. It was an accepted open secret for years. He used everywhere – birthday parties, Christmas parties. I&#x27;m not the only person in the world that knows this&quot;.

Ryan was noted for his love of fine food and wine. He was battling a weight problem for several years and had been taking Reductil (Sibutramine), a &quot;slimming pill&quot;, which he said was effective and safe. Ryan conceded in his autobiography that he drank too much for his own good.

==Death==

Shortly after midday on 30 April 2010, Ryan was found dead in the bedroom of his home on Leeson Street, Dublin.

Among the dignitaries to send tributes were Bono, the Clintons, Taoiseach Brian Cowen and President Mary McAleese. The day being Friday, that night&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was promptly given over to discussion of Ryan&#x27;s life and death. 10,000 people from across the country queued to sign books of condolence. His funeral took place on 6 May, and was broadcast on 2fm, the home of Ryan&#x27;s radio show and a first for the predominantly youthpop-oriented station.
His death also came sixteen years to the day after he hosted Eurovision 1994.

An inquest showed that the cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia and that traces of cocaine found in Ryan&#x27;s system were the &quot;likely trigger&quot; of Ryan&#x27;s death. A considerable public controversy erupted when Ryan&#x27;s long-term use of cocaine came to light. RTÉ eventually admitted to having given insufficient coverage of Ryan&#x27;s cocaine habit in the aftermath of the inquest.

<text>Zeved habat ( - &quot;Gift of the Daughter&quot;) or Simchat Bat (Hebrew: - &quot;Celebration of the Daughter&quot;) is the Jewish naming ceremony for newborn girls. The details of the celebration varies somewhat by Jewish community and will typically feature the recitation of specific biblical verses and a prayer to announce the name of the newborn child.

The ceremony is also known by other names including Fadas, Brit Bat (Hebrew: - &quot;Covenant of the Daughter&quot;) or Brit Kedusha (Hebrew: - &quot;Covenant of Holiness&quot;). A medieval naming ceremony for girls, according to the custom of some medieval Ashkenazi communities, was known as a [[Hollekreisch]] (Yiddish: ), or Shabbat Hayoledet (&quot;Sabbath of the Birth Mother&quot;).

==Background==
The practice of &quot;Zeved Habat&quot; is recorded as a custom of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in various communities including Moroccan Jews, Syrian Jews, the Sephardic community in England and of Cochin Jews of India. The ceremony is listed in a book of prayers published in 1687 associated with the Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam.

In the mid-20th century, following the development of the Havurah movement and the rise of Jewish feminism, American Jews took a renewed interest in both new and traditional ceremonies for welcoming baby girls. For American Jews who did not previously maintain the tradition of a naming ceremony for newborn girls, one strategy has been to recover older Jewish traditions to meet the present ritual needs of the community. It is likely that the first such ceremony to be formulated for Jews outside of the Sephardi and Mizrahi communities was a ceremony developed by rabbis in Reconstructionist Judaism in the 1970s. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, other American Jews from various denominations, including individual Orthodox families, also formulated various ceremonies often referred to as a &quot;Simchat Bat&quot;. At the same time, some Orthodox scholars, including Moshe Meiselman and Judith Bleich, raised opposition to new ceremonies, while Rabbi Shlomo Riskin at the Lincoln Square Synagogue supported the incorporation of the ceremony as Orthodox custom. In the case of Anglo-speaking Orthodox communities, a modified version of the &quot;Zeved Habat&quot; ceremony has been added to established Orthodox prayerbooks (alongside the standard Ashkenazi &quot;mi sheberach&quot;) since the early 2000s with the support of UK Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks.

== The traditional ceremony ==

In Jewish legal literature, the &quot;Zeved Habat&quot; event is cited as either taking place in the synagogue during the Torah reading of the Shabbat service, when the father receives an &quot;aliya&quot;, or the ceremony may take place at the home in the course of a festive meal. Some Jewish communities have the custom of waiting until the mother has recovered and can enter the synagogue for the ceremony to take place. The event is also treated as an appropriate occasion for the mother of the newborn to recite the traditional blessing of thanksgiving, known as &quot;Hagomel&quot;. Some Jews have the custom to hold the &quot;Zeved Habat&quot; ceremony on the first Shabbat from the birth. The Hebrew word &quot;zeved&quot; is understood to be a somewhat rare word and appears just once in the Pentateuch in where Leah offers thanks to God for the birth of Zebulon. The Hebrew word used in the verse may mean &quot;gift&quot; or &quot;dwelling&quot;.

The custom is for a verse from Song of Songs to be recited. And if the newborn is also the firstborn child, the custom is for an added verse of Song of Songs to be recited. Following this recitation, a &quot;Mi sheberakh&quot; blessing is recited (see text below) which includes the namegiving prayer. Some communities maintain the custom that the rabbi holds the newborn while reciting the verse(s) from Song of Songs.

=== The &quot;Mi sheberakh&quot; prayer ===
In this ceremony, a &quot;Mi sheberakh&quot; prayer (below) is used to announce the name of the child. The wording to the prayer varies somewhat by Jewish community. For some, the prayer begins with &quot;Mi sheberakh imoteinu hakedoshot&quot; (&quot;The one Who blesses our Holy Mothers&quot;). Additionally, the prayer ends with added verses relating to the matriarch Rebekah. Other versions include the phrase &quot;v&#x27;kol hakehilot hakedushot v&#x27;hatehorot&quot; (&quot;and all the holy and pure congregations&quot;) following the mention of the prophetesses. Additionally, some editions specify that the child be named with mention of her mother&#x27;s name (&quot;[name of the newborn] bat [name of the mother]&quot;).

In some versions, the words &quot;imoteinu&quot; (&quot;our mothers&quot;) and &quot;beYisrael&quot; (&quot;in Israel&quot;) are omitted. In other versions, such as those from the Moroccan Jewish community, they are included.

=== Related customs===
In the Sephardi community, the &quot;Zeved habat&quot; is usually celebrated within the first month of the birth. It is held privately in the synagogue or at a party at home. It is often led by the &quot;ḥakhám&quot; (rabbinic sage) or hazzan (cantor).

One custom is for the following to be recited:
One custom is for the father of the newborn to recite a Hebrew poem which begins with &quot;Ayuma marayich hareini&quot;.
A common element of the ceremony is the birth mother&#x27;s thanksgiving for following the birth. The blesing recited is known as &quot;Birkat HaGomel&quot; (&quot;Blessing of Deliverance&quot;).
Others include a recitation of Psalm 128, and the Priestly Blessing (&quot;Birkat kohanim&quot;).

====Ashkenazi customs====
The original Ashkenzai practice does not include a &quot;Zeved Habat&quot; ceremony and instead involves a minor prayer for name giving. However, in the 20th Century, the &quot;Zeved Habat&quot; ceremony, often renamed as a Simchat Bat ceremony has become accepted in various Ashkenazi communities.

Many Ashkenazi communities use a prayer for the health of a mother and newborn, recited by someone called up to read from the Torah scroll, as an opportunity to name a baby girl. According to the Chabad Hasidic custom, it is preferable for the newborn girl to be named at the earliest possible Torah reading in the synagogue (whether on Monday, Thursday, Shabbat or other day which include a public Torah reading), however, other customs are also cited such as those who wait until the Shabbat when a greater celebration may occur and the Sephardi custom of &quot;Zeved Habat&quot;. According to Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried (1804-1886), in terms of the &quot;aliyah&quot; for the father of a newborn girl, preference is given to the one whose wife (the mother of the newborn) comes to the synagogue.

The Ashkenz &quot;mi sheberach&quot; includes the following:
The contemporary &quot;Simchat Bat&quot; ceremony has become an accepted custom among modern-Orthodox Jews of Ashkenazi background as an adaptation of the &quot;Zeved Habat&quot; ritual. The uniqueness of the ceremony is that it may be presented as non-traditional and female-focused, in which women play a role alongside men. One possibility for this acceptance of the &quot;Simchat Bat&quot; in modern Orthodox Judaism is that it is a ceremony with no major Jewish legalistic (&quot;halakhic&quot;) implications and which does not intrude upon male ritual space. In the modern Orthodox ceremony, a number of additional elements are added to the traditional &quot;Zeved Habat&quot; ceremony including the public sharing of a Torah lesson (&quot;dvar Torah&quot;) often by the parent or a friend, readings about female biblical figures, and an explanation of the name chosen for the newborn. The child may also be given both an ‘English’ and a ‘Jewish’ name (either a Hebrew or Yiddish name). Additionally, in the &quot;Simchat Bat&quot; ceremony, there is greater opportunity for women (such as the birth mother) to participate in the ceremony ritual.

A &quot;Simchat Bat&quot; celebration may consist of a communal welcoming, a naming done over a cup of wine with the quotation of appropriate Biblical verses, and traditional blessings. In the Ashkenazi community, name ceremonies for newborn girls were not widespread and often limited to the father announcing the baby&#x27;s name in the synagogue on the Shabbat, Monday, Thursday or other occasion when the Torah would be read following the birth. Sometimes a &quot;kiddush&quot; will be held at the synagogue for family and friends. Although ceremonies can be found in Ashkenazic sources. Rabbi Yacov Emden includes a text in his famous prayer book.

====Hollekreisch ceremony====

In medieval times, girls were named during &quot;shavua habat&quot; (lit. &#x27;week of the daughter&#x27;). In early German Jewish communities, a baby naming ceremony was developed for both girls and boys called a &quot;Hollekreisch&quot; (possibly meaning &#x27;secular shout&#x27;, or relating to the mythical Frau Holle), in which the infant&#x27;s crib was raised and the newborn received their secular names. The date of the ritual varied, either on the first Shabbat following the birth when the mother of the newborn could visit the synagogue (known as &quot;Shabbat Hayoledet&quot;), or the fourth Shabbat from the date of the birth. The ritual took place after Shabbat lunch. The babies were dressed up, and boys were draped in a tallit. The book of Vayikra (Leviticus) was placed in the crib. The crib would then be lifted up and the following recited in German: &quot;Hollekreisch! How shall the baby be called? So-and-so So-and-so So-and-so (i.e. his or her name three times).&quot; Nuts, sweets and fruits were then distributed to the guests. The custom applied to both boys (who had already received their Hebrew names at their brit mila) and girls. This ceremony was widely observed in Jewish circles in Germany as early as the 14th century. In the 17th century this custom was observed in naming boys and girls only in South Germany, while in Austria, Bohemia, Moravia and Poland it was not used for boys, and only rarely for girls.

==New ceremonies==
* Conservative Judaism — The rabbi&#x27;s manual of Conservative Judaism presents a ceremony which includes readings and blessings as well as optional features which parents may choose to perform including lighting of candles, touching a Torah handle, and enfolding in a prayer shawl (&quot;tallit&quot;). In the candle ceremony, the newborn is carried between rows of guests who hold candles; alternatively, six candles may be lit, symbolizing the six days of creation. In the Torah ceremony, a Torah scroll is taken out of the ark and the baby&#x27;s hands are placed on the Torah handle. In the &quot;tallit&quot; ceremony, honorees fold each corner of a tallit over or around the newborn. Other customs include the addition of a special greeting at the start of the ceremony.
* Reconstructionist Judaism — The prayerbook of Reconstructionist Judaism includes both Hebrew prayers of blessing and an English blessing regarding Torah study. The Reconstructionist Rabbi&#x27;s Manual, however, presents an additional ceremony known as Berit Rihitzah (‘‘Covenant of Washing’’) for girls, along with the welcoming and naming ceremony. The &quot;Berit Rihitzah&quot; incorporates the washing of the baby&#x27;s feet in water with readings and blessings related to the symbol of water. The ceremony blessing states that God has ‘‘commanded us to bring her into the covenant of the people of Israel.’’ An earlier version of the Reconstructionist ceremony was known as Brit B’not Yisrael (&quot;Covenant of the Daughter of Israel&quot;) and was formulated by Rabbi Sandy Eisenberg Sasso and her husband Rabbi Dennis Sasso in the early 1970s. The ceremony was to take place on Shabbat at the home of the parents of the newborn and includes the following blessing: ‘‘Praised are You, Eternal God, Ruler of the Universe, who sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us to bring our daughter into the covenant of the people of Israel.&quot;

<doc id="1042611" wikidata="Q3559237" url="?curid=1042611" title="Evangelical Presbyterian Church (United States)">
<text>The Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC) is an American church body holding to presbyterian governance and Reformed theology. It is a conservative Calvinist denomination. It is most distinctive for its approach to the way it balances certain liberties across congregations on &quot;non-essential&quot; doctrines, such as egalitarianism /complementarianism in marriage or the ordination of women, alongside an affirmation of core &quot;essential&quot; doctrinal standards.

The motto of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church is &quot;In Essentials, Unity. In Non-Essentials, Liberty. In All Things, Charity; Truth In Love.&quot;
The Office of the General Assembly is in Orlando, Florida.

==History==

The EPC began as a result of prayer meetings in 1980 and 1981 by pastors and elders increasingly alienated by liberalism in the &quot;northern&quot; branch of Presbyterianism (the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., a predecessor of the Presbyterian Church (USA)). Two cases served as important catalysts in their separation: the Kenyon Case of 1975 and the Kaseman Case of 1981.

Wynn Kenyon was a seminary graduate who in good conscience declared that he would refuse to participate in the ordination of a woman, although he affirmed that he would willingly serve in a pastorate with ordained women on the staff. Though he had been ordained by the Pittsburgh Presbytery, in 1975 the Permanent Judicial Commission of the UPCUSA General Assembly overturned Kenyon&#x27;s ordination because accepting women&#x27;s ordination was &quot;an explicit constitutional provision.&quot; Mansfield Kaseman, meanwhile was ordained as a minister by National Capital Union Presbytery in 1979 and accused of denying four traditional attributes of Christ: his deity, sinlessness, vicarious atonement, and bodily resurrection. By 1981, his case had worked its way to the Permanent Judicial Commission of the UPCUSA, which affirmed his ordination. In contrast with the UPCUSA, the EPC permitted differing views on women&#x27;s ordination and emphasized traditional teachings on the nature of Jesus Christ.

The first general assembly of the church met at Ward Presbyterian Church in Livonia, Michigan in late 1981, drafting a list of essential beliefs. This list was intentionally short in order to help preserve the unity of the church around the essentials of the faith in theology, church government, and evangelism.

At its foundation, the EPC adopted a list of essential beliefs, &quot;The Essentials of Our Faith,&quot; to state what the EPC views as the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of Evangelical Christianity (see below), in part to seek to guarantee that it would not succumb to the theological problems that had plagued its parent denominations during the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy. &quot;The Essentials&quot; is a fuller version of the &quot;Five Fundamentals&quot; that many PCUSA ministers had rejected in the Auburn Affirmation of 1923: 
# the inerrancy of the original manuscripts of the Bible
# Christ’s virgin birth
# Christ’s vicarious atonement
# Christ’s bodily resurrection
# the reality of miracles as recorded in the Bible.

Originally titled &quot;The Fundamentals of Our Faith,&quot; the name was changed to avoid the negative connotations that the term &quot;fundamentalism&quot; had gained. This document has served to assure that the EPC has always kept what is of primary importance for all evangelical Christians (namely the Gospel, or Good News about Jesus), as well as to maintain the irenic orthodoxy that has always been the hallmark of the denomination. (See &quot;Ethos,&quot; below.)

In the more than forty years of its existence, the EPC has become active as a missional church, through church planting in the United States as well as in a variety of foreign fields, particularly in the 10/40 Window. One significant step was the incorporation of the St. Andrews Presbytery (Argentina) as one of its presbyteries. This presbytery was released to independence as the national St. Andrews Presbyterian Church of Argentina after many years of mutual cooperation and benefit.

At 2007 General Assembly, the EPC created a temporary, non-geographic &quot;New Wineskins Presbytery&quot; (NWEPC) to provide a home for churches associated with the New Wineskins Association of Churches (NWAC) that are seeking to find a new denominational home after finding that their home in the PC(USA) is no longer suitable to them theologically, organizationally, or missionally. The New Wineskins Presbytery was dissolved in 2011, as its mission was completed.

Jeff Jeremiah, the stated clerk (2006 - 2021), announced at the 2012 General Assembly, held at the First Presbyterian Church of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that the number of EPC congregations had increased from 182 in 2007 to 364 in 2012, exactly doubling in number. The number of congregations had further increased to more than 600 by August 2017.

Between 1982 and 2016, EPC grew steadily. In 2016, the denomination reached 150,042 members. However, since then, it has reported a decline in subsequent years.

In 2022, it had 125,870 members and 627 churches. In 2023, it had 121,058 members and 629 churches 

== Essentials ==
The church has an official seven point statement of the &quot;Essentials Of Our Faith&quot;.

These Essentials are set forth in greater detail in the Westminster Confession of Faith.

The EPC has also adopted an explanation of the relationship between the &quot;Essentials of Our Faith&quot; and the Westminster Standards.

==Place in American Presbyterianism==

As its name suggests, the EPC is an evangelical denomination. It associates mainly with Reformed bodies holding similar or identical beliefs regarding Christology, ecclesiology, and ethical/moral stances. As with practically all orthodox Presbyterian bodies, the EPC is committed to Biblical interpretation governed by the Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms. The EPC is member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches

Being within the Reformed tradition, the EPC is more conservative than the PC(USA) on matters of theology and ethics, yet is more moderate than the other major conservative Presbyterian denominations in the United States—the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church (ARPC) and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC). The EPC&#x27;s middling stance is similar to ECO: A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians, which was formed in 2012 from churches leaving the PC(USA). The EPC&#x27;s ethos (summarized in its motto) allows a greater degree of freedom in areas deemed to be non-essential to Reformed theology than the PCA, ARP and OPC. The EPC, like ECO and PCUSA, but unlike PCA or OPC, belongs to the World Communion of Reformed Churches.

==Women&#x27;s ordination and charismatic movement==
Two examples of the EPC&#x27;s centrist position within American Presbyterianism are women&#x27;s ordination and the charismatic movement.

The EPC considers the ordination of women to be a non-essential matter that is left to the ordaining body. That is, EPC presbyteries decide whether to ordain female ministers, while individual churches decide whether to ordain female elders and deacons. In contrast, the ARP does not ordain female ministers or elders but allows individual churches to ordain female deacons, and the PCA and OPC do not ordain women.

The EPC is far more tolerant of the charismatic movement than other conservative Presbyterian bodies; some of the more prominent charismatic Presbyterian churches in America are members of the EPC.

==Ethos==
The EPC has been described as the modern-day version of New School Presbyterianism, while the PCA, ARP and OPC are essentially the modern-day equivalent of Old School Presbyterianism. The way that this is expressed is in the motto of the denomination: &quot;In Essentials, Unity; In Non-Essentials, Liberty; In All Things, Charity. Truth in Love.&quot; Functionally, this works out with a three-tiered approach to theological issues. These may be thought of as &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B,&quot; and &quot;C&quot; issues.

&quot;A&quot; issues are those which have to do with the &quot;Essentials of Our Faith.&quot; This is a summary of those issues which are foundational to Christian faith. In the EPC, there is no allowance for disagreement among church officers (ministers, elders, and deacons) on these issues. Indeed, it is expected that all communicant members will affirm these tenets of the faith.

&quot;B&quot; issues are those which are essential to the Reformed understanding of the faith, such as the so-called &quot;Five Points of Calvinism,&quot; Covenant Theology, Presbyterian government, etc. The definition of &quot;B&quot; issues for the EPC is found in the Westminster Confession of Faith and in the Westminster Larger Catechism and Westminster Shorter Catechism. As these issues aren&#x27;t as foundational as the Essentials of Our Faith, the EPC allows ministers, elders, and deacons to state exceptions to the Westminster Standards, so long as these exceptions do not violate the system of doctrine contained therein. While non-ordained members aren&#x27;t expected to adhere to the Westminster Standards, it is understood that the teaching position of the EPC is found in the Westminster Standards.

Finally, &quot;C&quot; issues are those on which Reformed, orthodox Christians can disagree, and which do not violate the system of doctrine of the EPC. As stated above, this would include the issues of women&#x27;s ordination and the charismatic movement, as well as issues such as eschatology (views on the End times), worship preferences, or liturgy.

<doc id="1042613" wikidata="Q3145386" url="?curid=1042613" title="Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal">
<text>The Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal (; founded in 1645) was the first hospital established in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

&quot;Hôtel-Dieu&quot;, literally translated in English as &quot;Hotel of God&quot;, is an archaic French term for hospital, referring to the origins of hospitals as religious institutions.

Its emergency room and function as an active hospital ended in 2017, and as of 2020 serves as a COVID-19 test site during the COVID-19 pandemic in Montreal.

==History==
The origins of the Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal date to the arrival in 1642 of Paul Chomedey and a small party of French settlers on the Island of Montreal to found the French colony of Ville-Marie. Among them was Jeanne Mance, the first nurse in New France. She founded the hospital on October 8, 1645, as confirmed by letters patent of Louis XIV of France in April 1669.

In addition to returning to France to seek financial support for the hospital, in 1657 Mance recruited three sisters of the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph (Religieuses hospitalières de Saint-Joseph) order of nuns to serve with her as staff. Their order was founded in 1636 by a layman, Jérôme Le Royer de la Dauversière, along with Mother Marie de la Fere (fr), in La Fleche, France. Guillaume Bailly, a Sulpician missionary, is credited with drawing up the plans for the stone structure that was built in 1688.

The hospital burned and was rebuilt three times between 1695 and 1734. After the conquest of New France by the British, for two centuries, it was the only French-language hospital in Montreal. Around 1850, the hospital became affiliated with the Montreal School of Medicine and Surgery. It continued to grow until 1861, when it was moved from Old Montreal to its present site near Mount Royal. It had an affiliated nursing school between 1901 and 1970.

In 1996, it became one of the three hospitals to make up the Centre hospitalier de l&#x27;Université de Montréal (CHUM), along with the Hôpital Notre-Dame du CHUM and the Hôpital Saint-Luc du CHUM.

With the completion of the CHUM megahospital campus adjacent to Hôpital Saint-Luc in 2017, the Hôtel-Dieu&#x27;s patients were moved to the new facility as of November 5, 2017. The Hôtel-Dieu was initially slated for closure, but ultimately remained open as a large-scale urgent care clinic until 2020.

In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Montreal, the former hospital became home to one of Montreal&#x27;s largest testing sites.

The present site also contains a museum of the hospital&#x27;s long history.

==Medical achievements==
During its history, many medical milestones have been recorded at the Hôtel-Dieu, including the world&#x27;s first removal of a kidney (1868), the world&#x27;s first removal of a tongue and jaw (1872), the first femur transplant (1959), the first identification of an AIDS patient in Canada (1979), the world&#x27;s first successful recovery of a person with severe burns to 90% of the body (1981), and the world&#x27;s first robotically assisted laparoscopic surgery (1993).

<doc id="1042619" wikidata="Q1781329" url="?curid=1042619" title="Gullmarsplan">
<text>Gullmarsplan () is a place in Johanneshov, Stockholm. The square there was built at the same time the new city area was developed in the 1940s. The business area around the square was inaugurated in 1946. It was named after Gullmarn, a fjord in the province of Bohuslän, at Lysekil.

The Skanstullsbron (Skanstull bridge) and Johanneshovsbron (Johanneshov bridge) connect Gullmarsplan by road with Södermalm, a part of the city center. Beneath Gullmarsplan, the road tunnel Södra länken runs in an east-west direction. Just south of Gullmarsplan is the Söderstadion football stadium as well as the Avicii Arena (Globen).

== Public transportation hub ==

The most prominent feature of Gullmarsplan is the large public transport hub, which provides access to and between the Stockholm Metro (&quot;Tunnelbanan&quot;) green lines, Tvärbanan light rail, and a large number of bus lines mainly to and from Tyresö, Haninge, Årsta and Södermalm.
The Metro station was inaugurated on 1 October 1950 as the fourth station of the Stockholm Metro. Previously, Gullmarsplan had been a station for the light rail system that preceded the subway.

==Event==
*The Stockholm Japan Expo is an annual expo held in Gullmarsplan to showcase Japanese culture and arts.

<doc id="1042626" wikidata="Q670796" url="?curid=1042626" title="Arizona State Route 89A">
<text>State Route 89A (SR 89A) is an state highway that runs from Prescott north to Flagstaff in the U.S. state of Arizona. The highway begins at SR 89 in Yavapai County and heads northward from Prescott Valley, entering Jerome. From Jerome, the route then heads to Cottonwood and Clarkdale. The road then continues out to Sedona. The highway is notable for its scenic value as it winds over and through Mingus Mountain as well as passing through Sedona and the Oak Creek Canyon. The route then enters Coconino County soon after leaving Sedona. The highway proceeds to Flagstaff, where it crosses Interstate 17 (I-17) and I-40. The highway ends at I-40 Business in Flagstaff. What is now SR 89A became a state highway in the late 1920s as SR 79. The highway was extended and improved several times through 1938. SR 79 was renumbered to U.S. Route 89A (US 89A) in 1941 and then to SR 89A in the early 1990s.

==Route description==
SR 89A runs from its southern terminus in Prescott northward through the towns of Jerome, Cottonwood and Sedona to its northern terminus in Flagstaff. The highway is known for its scenic views as it passes through the Sedona area and Oak Creek Canyon.

===Prescott to Jerome===
SR 89A&#x27;s southern terminus is at a junction with SR 89 north of Prescott near the Antelope Hills Golf Course and Ernest A. Love Field. The road heads east from the junction with SR 89 as the Pioneer Parkway, a four-lane divided highway with diamond interchanges at most intersections. It continues as a divided highway until it reaches Fain Road in Prescott Valley. The route continues beyond this intersection as a two-lane undivided highway. The only at-grade intersection in this stretch is a junction with Great Western Drive, near milepost 321.
As SR 89A moves to the northeast, it begins to ascend the Black Hills mountain range. ADOT has designated this section of SR 89A as the Mingus Mountain Scenic Road by ADOT. The roadway follows the terrain through a series of hairpin turns as it climbs in elevation. Once SR 89A reaches passes over the mountains, it begins its descent into the Verde Valley. During its descent, SR 89A enters the town of Jerome. In Jerome, the highway provides access to the nearby Jerome State Historic Park.

===Jerome to Sedona===
Upon exiting Jerome, SR 89A heads northeast through the Verde Valley. The highway also picks up the Historic US 89A designation on the south end of Jerome. Officially named the Jerome-Clarkdale-Cottonwood Historic Road by the Arizona Department of Transportation, Historic US 89A is one of only four state designated historic routes in Arizona, the others being Historic Route 66, Historic U.S. Route 80 and the Apache Trail Historic Road. The historic route was designated on May 13, 1992, by ADOT and is about 10 miles long.

After SR 89A and Historic US 89A enter the town of Clarkdale, SR 89A turns southeast at a roundabout with Clarkdale Parkway. The route continues toward the southeast through Clarkdale before entering the town of Cottonwood. There, the highway starts heading east at Cottonwood Street before reaching an intersection with Main Street.

Historic US 89A, runs through the old downtown areas of both Clarkdale and Cottonwood. From the present day traffic circle between SR 89A and Clarkdale Parkway, Historic 89A continues north along Clarkdale Parkway, turning right at Main Street in Clarkdale, and then right again at Broadway. It continues past Tuzigoot National Monument, becoming Main Street in Cottonwood, and providing access to Dead Horse Ranch State Park. The route intersects Cottonwood Street, where the bypass route now intersects Main Street.
Following the intersection with Cottonwood Street, the road follows Main Street to an intersection with SR 260, which heads to the south toward Camp Verde and I-17. SR 89A then moves northeastward towards Sedona. As the highway leaves Cottonwood, it again becomes a divided highway north of Rocking Chair Road, heading into desert. Before reaching Sedona, SR 89A provides access to Red Rock State Park.

The route remains a divided highway until it reaches Sedona, an arts and resort community known for its red sandstone formations. As it enters the city of Sedona, the route is known as the Si Birch Memorial Highway. The route continues east through Sedona, providing access to the Sedona Airport. SR 89A continues toward the east through Sedona to an intersection with SR 179, which heads south from this intersection through the southern part of Sedona to provide access to I-17.

===Sedona to Flagstaff===
Upon leaving Sedona, SR 89A becomes the state designated Sedona–Oak Creek Canyon Scenic Road. The highway heads northeast into a wooded area from Sedona and follows Oak Creek as it enters Oak Creek Canyon. SR 89A then curves to the north as it follows the creek and provides access to Slide Rock State Park along this portion of the highway. The roadway leaves the creek as it begins to ascend through the canyon. At the edge of the canyon, the Scenic Road designation ends.

Upon ascending, the road goes through a series of hairpin turns (no trucks over 50 ft.) toward the Mogollon Rim. The roadway continues northward away from the canyon towards Flagstaff. It curves northeastward as it passes to the west of the Forest Highlands Golf Club. The route continues to the northeast towards I-17 near Flagstaff Pulliam Airport.

SR 89A begins to run concurrently with I-17 as a freeway northward. The two highways continue north to an interchange with I-40, where I-17 terminates. The route continues north along Milton Road, to the west of Northern Arizona University before reaching its northern terminus at I-40 Business in Flagstaff.

==History==

The routing of SR 89A was first defined as a state highway in 1927 as SR 79 by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT). At the time, only the portion from Prescott to Clarkdale was built, but the remaining portion to Flagstaff had been planned. By 1929, the highway had been extended north to Sedona, although the entire highway was not paved at this time. A graded dirt road was built the following year between Flagstaff and Sedona. The southern half of the section between Sedona and Flagstaff had been improved to a gravel road by 1934, with the northern half under construction. The next year, the construction on the northern section near Flagstaff was complete. The southern end of the highway near Prescott and the section between Jerome and Cottonwood had been paved by this time. By 1938, the entire route had been paved.

By 1941, the highway was redesignated from SR 79 to US 89A. Before the establishment of the route for I-17, the only route to Flagstaff was through Prescott. There were two routes available: US 89A through Jerome, Cottonwood, Clarkdale, Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon or north through Chino Valley via US 89 to US 66. The route was redesignated from US 89A to SR 89A in 1993.

Before 2001, SR 89A had veered south into the granite dells near Watson Lake, but due to an aging Granite Creek bridge and increased traffic, Yavapai County acquired the necessary land to realign SR 89A away from the dells and near the airport.

==Spur route==
State Route 89A Spur (SR 89A Spur or SS 89A) is a unsigned highway routed along Fain Road in Prescott Valley. SR 89A Spur was originally established on July 16, 2004, over a small section of Fain Road immediately east of the intersection with SR 89A proper. The route was extended over the remainder of Fain Road to SR 69 on August 18, 2011. The road was originally two lanes wide but has since been widened to a four-lane divided highway. Its primary purpose is as an eastern bypass around Prescott. The Central Yavapai Metropolitan Planning Organization has planned a freeway to connect SR 169 and SR 89A via Fain Road/SR 89A Spur as part of their 2025 regional plan.

<doc id="1042635" wikidata="Q541997" url="?curid=1042635" title="Battle of Alam el Halfa">
<text>The Battle of Alam el Halfa took place between 30 August and 5 September 1942 south of El Alamein during the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. &quot;Panzerarmee Afrika&quot; (&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel), attempted an envelopment of the British Eighth Army (Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery). In (Operation Surf), the last big Axis offensive of the Western Desert Campaign, Rommel intended to defeat the Eighth Army before Allied reinforcements arrived.

Montgomery knew of Axis intentions through Ultra signals intercepts and left a gap in the southern sector of the front, knowing that Rommel planned to attack there and deployed the bulk of his armour and artillery around Alam el Halfa Ridge, behind the front. Unlike in previous engagements, Montgomery ordered that the tanks were to be used as anti-tank guns, remaining in their defensive positions on the ridge. When Axis attacks on the ridge failed and short on supplies, Rommel ordered a withdrawal. The 2nd New Zealand Division conducted Operation Beresford against Italian positions, which was a costly failure.

Montgomery did not exploit his defensive victory, preferring to continue the methodical build up of strength for his autumn offensive, the Second Battle of El Alamein. Rommel claimed that British air superiority determined the result, being unaware of Ultra. Rommel adapted to the increasing Allied dominance in the air by keeping his forces dispersed. With the failure at Alam Halfa, the Axis forces in Africa lost the initiative and Axis strategic aims in Africa were no longer possible.

==Background==
A lull followed the Axis failure in the First Battle of El Alamein and the counterattacks by the Eighth Army (General Sir Claude Auchinleck) in July 1942. At Alamein, the Axis supply position was precarious because the main supply ports of Benghazi and Tobruk were and from the front and Tripoli— away—was almost redundant because of its distance from the front. The original Axis plan for the Battle of Gazala in June had been to capture Tobruk then pause for six weeks on the Egyptian frontier to prepare an invasion of Egypt. The magnitude of the Axis victory at Gazala led Rommel to pursue the Eighth Army to deny the Allies time to organise another defensive front west of Cairo and the Suez Canal. Axis air forces which had been allocated to Operation Herkules, an attack on Malta, were diverted into Egypt.

The British in Malta were able to rebuild their strength to resume attacks on Axis supply convoys to North Africa. From mid-August there was a big increase in Axis losses at sea, notably from a reinforced Mediterranean submarine force. At the end of August, the Axis forces had been reinforced by troops flown from Crete but were short of supplies, notably ammunition and petrol. There was a recovery in the armoured strength of in August, German tank strength rising from 133 &quot;runners&quot; to 234 and the number of Italian runners increased from 96 to 281 (of which 234 were medium tanks). &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; strength increased to 298 aircraft from 210 before the Battle of Gazala and the Italian number rising to 460 aircraft.

General Sir Harold Alexander—the new Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of Middle East Command—had only a short distance from the supply bases and ports in Egypt to the front line but supplies from Britain, the Commonwealth and the United States still took a long time to arrive. By the summer of 1942, equipment receipts began to increase, notably of new Sherman tanks and six-pounder anti-tank guns to supplement obsolete two-pounders. The RAF and associated air forces under command, supported by new American squadrons maintained a considerable degree of air superiority. Sources of military intelligence were integrated and by mid August, British and Allied forces were benefiting from tactically useful information.

German intelligence had warned Rommel of the arrival of a Allied convoy bringing new vehicles for the Allies in Egypt; reinforcements for the British would tilt the balance of advantage against the Axis. Rommel demanded from the Italian in Rome of fuel and of ammunition before attacking at the end of the month but by 29 August, over 50 per cent of the supply ships from Italy had been sunk and only of fuel had arrived at Tobruk. Rommel had to gamble on a quick victory before the increasing power of the Eighth Army made defeat inevitable. After Albert Kesselring had agreed to lend some Luftwaffe fuel, Rommel had enough for per vehicle with the troops and for other vehicles.

==Prelude==

===Plan===

At El Alamein an attack by the Axis would have to pass between the coast and the Qattara Depression about to the south and impassable for tanks. The Eighth Army defences were quite strong but Rommel believed that the south end between Munassib and Qaret El Himeimat, was lightly held and not extensively mined. One account indicated the northern and central sectors of the front were so strongly fortified that the southern stretch of between the New Zealand &quot;box&quot; on the Alam Nayil Ridge and the Qattara Depression, was the only place where an attack could quickly succeed. Since surprise in location was impossible, Rommel had to depend on achieving surprise by time and speed. By rapidly breaking through in the south, Axis forces might get astride the Eighth Army supply routes, throw it off balance and disorganise its defence.

Rommel planned a night attack to be well beyond the Eighth Army minefields before sunrise. In the north, the XXI Infantry Corps (, Enea Navarini) comprising the 102nd Motorised Division &quot;Trento&quot; and 25th Infantry Division &quot;Bologna&quot;, the XXXI (Sappers) Battalion, the German 164th Light Division and elements of the Ramcke Parachute Brigade, was to conduct a frontal demonstration to fix the defenders. The main attack was to be led by the 15th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and the 21st &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and the 90th Light Division to the south which would turn north once through the British minefields. The Eighth Army would be surrounded and destroyed, leaving the Axis forces with a promenade through Egypt to the Suez Canal.

===Allied defences===
British Ultra decrypts had anticipated an Axis attack and Auchinleck set out the basic defensive plan with several contingencies for defensive works around Alexandria and Cairo in case Axis armour broke through. On 13 August, command of the Eighth Army passed to Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery. After visiting the front, Montgomery ordered that the contingency plans be destroyed and emphasised his intention to hold the ground around Alamein at all costs. In the northern sector, just south of Ruweisat Ridge to the coast, XXX Corps (Lieutenant-General William Ramsden) comprising the 9th Australian Division, the 1st South African Infantry Division and the 5th Indian Infantry Division with the 23rd Armoured Brigade in reserve was deployed behind minefields.

XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks) held the ground south of Ruweisat Ridge. The 2nd New Zealand Division was deployed on a front south of the ridge in the New Zealand Box, which formed a corner to the main defences with its hinge of the higher ground at Alam Nayil. Since the featureless southern sector was hard to defend against an armoured attack, Montgomery chose to hold lightly the front from the New Zealand Box to Qaret el Himeimat on the edge of the Qattara Depression, to encourage Rommel to take the bait and attack there. This gap would be mined and wired; the 7th Motor Brigade Group and 4th Light Armoured Brigade (7th Armoured Division) would cover the minefields but withdraw when necessary.

The attackers would meet the main defensive positions when they swung north and approached the Alam el Halfa ridge, behind the Eighth Army front. The bulk of the British medium tanks (in 22nd Armoured Brigade) and anti-tank units were dug in to wait for the Axis attack. Behind the British armour, on the high ground to the north east would be two infantry brigades of the 44th (Home Counties) Division and concentrations of divisional and corps artillery. The 10th Armoured Division had been refitting in the Nile Delta with General Grant tanks with the effective main gun and would reinforce the Alam El Halfa position when available. Most of the 8th Armoured Brigade had arrived by 30 August and took post to manoeuvre on the left of 22nd Armoured Brigade and on the flank of the enemy&#x27;s expected advance. Once Montgomery had seen the Axis dispositions after the initial advance, he released the 23rd Armoured Brigade, in XXX Corps reserve at the eastern end of Ruweisat Ridge, to XIII Corps, attached to the 10th Armoured Division. By 13:00 on 31 August, 100 Valentine tanks had moved to fill the gap between 22nd Armoured Brigade and the New Zealanders.

==Battle==

===30/31 August===

The attack started on the night of 30 August, taking advantage of a full moon. From the start, things went wrong for Rommel; the RAF spotted the Axis vehicle concentrations and unleashed several air attacks on them. Fairey Albacores of the Royal Navy dropped flares to illuminate targets for Vickers Wellington medium bombers and for the artillery; also, the minefields that were thought to be thin turned out to be deep. The British units covering the minefields were the two brigades of the 7th Armoured Division (7th Motor and 4th Armoured), whose orders were to inflict maximum casualties before retiring. This they did, and the Axis losses began to rise. They included General Walther Nehring, the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; commander, wounded in an air raid, and General Georg von Bismarck, commander of the 21st Panzer Division, killed by a mine explosion.

===31 August===
Despite these difficulties, Rommel&#x27;s forces were through the minefields by midday the next day and had wheeled left and were drawn up ready to make the main attack originally scheduled for 06:00. The late running of the planned schedule and the continued harassing flank attacks from the 7th Armoured Division had forced them to turn north into Montgomery&#x27;s flank further west than originally planned and directly toward the prepared defences on Alam el Halfa. At 13:00, the 15th Panzer Division set off, followed an hour later by 21st Panzer. The Allied units holding the ridge were the British 22nd Armoured Brigade with 92 Grants and 74 light tanks, supported by anti-tank units with six-pounder guns and the artillery of the 44th (Home Counties) Division and the 2nd New Zealand Division.

The Axis forces had approximately 200 gun-armed tanks in the two &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions and 240 in the two Italian armoured divisions. The Italian tanks were mostly obsolete models, except for the Semovente da 75/18, which could defeat Allied medium tanks using HEAT ammunition, which could penetrate 70 mm of armour at 50 metres. The Germans had 74 up-armoured &quot;Panzer&quot; IIIs with long-barrelled guns (Pz.Kpfw III Ausf.L) and 27 &quot;Panzer&quot; IVs with long 75 mm guns (Pz.Kpfw IV Ausf.F2). The British had 700 tanks at the front, of which 160 were Grants. Only 500 of the British tanks were engaged in the armoured battle, which was brief.
As the &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions approached the ridge, the &quot;Panzer&quot; IV F2 tanks opened fire at long range and destroyed several British tanks. The British Grants were handicapped by their hull-mounted guns that prevented them from firing from hull-down positions. When the Germans came into range, they were exposed to the fire of the brigade and their tanks were hard hit. An attempt to outflank the British was thwarted by anti-tank guns and with night beginning to fall and fuel running short because of the delays and heavy consumption over the bad &#x27;going&#x27;, General Gustav von Vaerst, the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; commander, ordered the &quot;Panzers&quot; to pull back. During this engagement, the Germans lost 22 tanks and the British 21.

There had also been hard infantry fighting. In the central sector, the Italians of the 25th Infantry Division &quot;Bologna&quot; and German Infantry Regiment 433 attacked several Indian, South African and New Zealand units on Ruweisat Ridge, and managed to capture Point 211 but were later driven off by a counter-attack. Although the &quot;Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45&quot; refers to the Italo-German infantry action as simply &#x27;feints&#x27;, Captain Cyril Falls, a British military historian, wrote that it was a strong counter-attack requiring an equal response.

===1–2 September===
The night of 31 August – 1 September brought no respite for the Axis forces, as the Albacore and Wellington bombers returned to the attack, concentrating on the Axis supply lines. This added to Rommel&#x27;s supply difficulties as Allied action had sunk over 50 per cent of the of petrol promised to him by Mussolini. On 1 September the 21st Panzer Division was inactive (probably because of a lack of fuel) and operations were limited to an attack by the 15th Panzer Division toward the eastern flank of the 22nd Armoured Brigade. The attack started at dawn but was quickly stopped by a flank attack from the 8th Armoured Brigade. The Germans suffered little, as the British were under orders to spare their tanks for the coming offensive but they could make no headway either and were heavily shelled. The 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot; and 133rd Armoured Division &quot;Littorio&quot; had moved up on the left of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; and the 90th Light Division and elements of Italian X Corps had drawn up to face the southern flank of the New Zealand box. Air raids continued throughout the day and night and on the morning of 2 September, realising his offensive had failed and that staying in the salient would only add to his losses, Rommel decided to withdraw.

====Axis withdrawal====
In a message to (OKW), Rommel justified his decision to abandon the offensive by the lack of fuel, Allied air superiority and the loss of surprise. On 2 September, Armoured cars of the 4/8th Hussars (4th Armoured Brigade) attacked 300 Axis supply lorries near Himeimat, destroying 57 and Italian armoured units had to be moved to protect Axis supply lines. In the air the Desert Air Force (DAF) flew 167 bomber and 501 fighter sorties. Montgomery realised the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; was about to withdraw and planned attacks by the 7th Armoured Division and the 2nd New Zealand Division (Lieutenant-General Bernard Freyberg) under the proviso that they were to avoid excessive losses. The 7th Armoured Division managed harassment raids but the New Zealand Division attacked with the experienced 5th New Zealand Brigade, the new 132nd Infantry Brigade (Brigadier C. B. Robertson) of the 44th (Home Counties) Division under command and tank support from the 46th Royal Tank regiment (46th RTR, 23rd Army Tank Brigade).

===3–4 September, Operation Beresford===

Operation Beresford began at 22:30 on 3. September. The 5th New Zealand Brigade on the left inflicted many casualties on the Italian defenders and defeated Axis counter-attacks the next morning. The Axis defenders were alerted by diversionary raids by the 6th New Zealand Brigade (Brigadier George Clifton) on the right flank of the 132nd Infantry Brigade which was an hour late arriving on their start line. The attack was a costly failure; the Valentine tanks of the 46th RTR got lost in the dark and ran onto a minefield where twelve were knocked out. The 90th Light Division inflicted 697 casualties on the 132nd Infantry Brigade and 275 casualties on the New Zealanders. Robertson was wounded and Clifton was captured by a patrol of the X Battalion of the Italian 185th Infantry Division &quot;Folgore&quot;. The vigorous Axis defence suggested to Freyberg that another attack was unlikely to succeed and advised that the troops should be withdrawn from their very exposed positions and the operation called off. Montgomery and Horrocks agreed and the troops were withdrawn on the night of 4 September. &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Fritz Bayerlein wrote later,

===5 September===
The position north of the New Zealand Division was held by 5th Indian Infantry Division, relieved by the 4th Indian Infantry Division on 9 September. After this failure against the &quot;Folgore&quot; Division, the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; retired unhindered, except for attacks by the DAF, which flew 957 sorties in 24 hours. By 5 September, the Axis units were back almost on their starting positions and the battle was over.

==Aftermath==

During the Battle of Alam el Halfa, the Allies suffered 1,750 casualties, compared to 2,930 for the Axis. The Allies lost more tanks than the Axis but for the first time in this campaign there was no great disproportion in tank losses. Constant harassment by the RAF cost the &quot;Panzerarmee Afrika&quot; many transport vehicles. The battle was the last big offensive undertaken by the Axis in North Africa and the superior firepower of the Allies and their air supremacy brought them victory. There has been criticism of Montgomery&#x27;s leadership during the battle, especially his choice to avoid losses, which prevented the British tank formations from trying to finish off the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; when it was strung out between the minefields and Alam Halfa. Friedrich von Mellenthin in &quot;Panzer Battles&quot; painted a dramatic picture of &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions, paralysed by lack of fuel, under constant bombardment and awaiting a British onslaught.

Montgomery pointed out that the Eighth Army was in a process of reformation with the arrival of new, untrained units and was not ready to take the offensive. Nor was his army yet prepared for a pursuit were they to break through, which had caused both sides to fail to end the desert campaign, after gaining tactical success. Montgomery did not want his tanks wasted on futile attacks against Rommel&#x27;s anti-tank screen, something that had frequently happened in the past, handing the initiative to the Axis forces. Rommel complained to Kesselring, &quot;The swine isn&#x27;t attacking!&quot; Montgomery kept his forces intact and the Eighth Army accumulated supplies for the offensive in October that came to be known as the Second Battle of El Alamein.

<text>Ingles Markets, Inc. (stylized as ingles) is an American supermarket chain based in Black Mountain, North Carolina. As of September 2021, the company operates 198 supermarkets in the Appalachian region of the Southeastern United States. The company is listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol IMKTA and is part of the Global Select Market tier of trading.

As an adjunct to its supermarket business, Ingles owns and operates shopping centers, gas stations and a milk processing plant.

==History==
The first Ingles store was opened by second-generation grocer Robert P. Ingle in 1963 and is located in Asheville, North Carolina. Ingle had worked in his father&#x27;s store since he was five years old and was unable to convince his father to build a large store. The younger Ingle had a vision of 4000 square feet. When Elmer Ingle died in the 1950s, Robert Ingle sold the store because his mother could not run it. Seven years later at age 29, Ingle decided to build a new 10,000-square-foot store. He would have to compete with larger chains and with independent stores that used cooperative distributors.

To start his business, Ingle joined with his mother and sister, and they used all of their savings and a mortgage on the house. The first store opened on Hendersonville Road. In one year, that store was expanded, and in another year, a second location opened on Patton Avenue. Ingles was incorporated in 1965 in the state of North Carolina. In 1967, the company bought six Colonial supermarkets.

In 1982, Ingles purchased a milk processing plant from Sealtest, which it operates as Milkco Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary. Two-thirds of Milkco&#x27;s business, which was later expanded beyond dairy to include products such as citrus, tea, and bottled water, is from food service distributors, grocery warehouses, and independent specialty retailers located in 17 states as of 2010. Ingles became a publicly traded company in 1987.
In the summer of 1996, the chain debuted its modern large-format store design, starting with its location in Dacula, Georgia. In the 2000s, the chain started building &quot;Ingles Gas Express&quot; gas stations with many of its newer stores. 107 of 198 locations now have fuel stations.

In February 2005, Ingles Markets announced it would restate financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of 2004, to correct the accounting for vendor allowances and certain other items. The restatement was a significant factor in
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issuing a Wells notice to the firm in January 2006, indicating that it might bring an enforcement action against it. A settlement was reached with the SEC in April 2006 that did not require payment of a monetary penalty. 

Following the death of Robert Ingle on March 6, 2011, his son Robert P. Ingle II became CEO.

In December 2012 and December 2013, the company collaborated with Eblen Charities&#x27; St. Nicholas Project on what they called &quot;Ingles Toy Store,&quot; offering &quot;toys, games, clothes and stocking stuffers&quot; to needy North Carolina families.

In July 2021, Ingles collaborated with Creating A Family.

In September 2024, Ingles was severely impaired by flooding from Hurricane Helene. The company&#x27;s distribution center in Swannanoa was surrounded by water from the adjacent Swannanoa River. That and the closure of major highways throughout western North Carolina led to shortages on store shelves. The chain&#x27;s credit card transactions are handled at its Asheville-area headquarters, which was flooded, causing all stores in the chain to accept only cash and check payments for days. Some stores without power and water temporarily closed, hampering rural communities with only one supermarket at a time when clean water and food was sorely needed. Lines formed outside other stores as staff allowed, in some cases, only five shoppers inside at a time. The storm caused $4.5 million in damage to the company&#x27;s equipment and property. An additional $30.4 million worth of Ingles inventory was damaged or destroyed.

==Operations==
Ingles owns 163 of its 198 supermarkets either as free-standing locations or in shopping centers where it is the anchor tenant. The remaining 35 locations are leased from various unaffiliated third parties. The company also owns 23 undeveloped sites which are suitable for a free-standing store or shopping center development. The company owns numerous outparcels and other acreage located adjacent to the shopping centers and supermarkets it owns. Real estate owned by the company is generally located in the same geographic regions as its supermarkets. Ingles also operates 111 pharmacies and 107 gas stations at select retail locations. As of 2023, Ingles had a workforce of approximately 25,000 associates.

Ingles also owns and operates nine supermarkets under the name “Sav-Mor” with the other 189 locations being Ingles Markets. The Sav-Mor store concept accommodates smaller shopping areas and carries dry groceries, dairy, fresh meat and produce, all of which are displayed in a modern, readily accessible environment.

Substantially all of Ingles&#x27; stores are located within of its warehouse and distribution facilities, near Asheville, North Carolina. The company operates 1.65 million square feet of warehouse and distribution facilities. These facilities supply the company’s supermarkets with approximately 62% of the goods the company sells. The remaining 38% is purchased from third parties and is generally delivered directly to the stores. The proximity of the company’s purchasing and distribution operations to its stores facilitates the timely distribution of consistently high quality perishable and non-perishable items.

The company owns a 1,649,000 square foot facility, which is strategically located between Interstate 40 and Highway 70 near Asheville, North Carolina, as well as the 119 acres of land on which it is situated. The facility includes the company’s headquarters and its warehouse and distribution facility. The property also includes truck servicing and fuel storage facilities. The company also owns a 139,000 square foot warehouse on 21 acres of land approximately one mile from its main warehouse and distribution facility. Goods from the warehouse and distribution facilities and the milk processing and packaging plant are distributed to the company’s stores by a fleet of 193 tractors and 751 trailers that the company owns, operates and maintains.

==Locations==
Ingles operates 198 stores in six southeastern states:
*Alabama: 1
*Georgia: 65
*North Carolina: 75
*South Carolina: 35
*Tennessee: 21
*Virginia: 1

They also operate 9 Sav-mor Foods locations in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

== Private label brands ==
Ingles sells products with the &quot;Laura Lynn&quot; brand, named for Ingle&#x27;s daughter Laura Lynn, now Laura Ingle Sharp. She worked in advertising for the chain starting in the 1970s and has been a member of the board of directors since 1997. The chain sells natural and organic products under the &quot;Harvest Farms&quot; label. A few other products are sold with the &quot;Ingles Best&quot; label. The brand of generic pharmacy products sold, &quot;Quality Choice,&quot; is not a brand exclusive to Ingles Markets.

==Competition==
Local and regional competitors include Food City, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Harveys, Target, Aldi, Lidl, Walmart, Kroger, Lowes Foods, Publix, and United Grocery Outlet.

<text>Vehicles that have two wheels and require balancing by the rider date back to the early 19th century. The first means of transport making use of two wheels arranged consecutively, and thus the archetype of the bicycle, was the German &quot;draisine&quot; dating back to 1817. The term &quot;bicycle&quot; was coined in France in the 1860s, and the descriptive title &quot;penny farthing&quot;, used to describe an &quot;ordinary bicycle&quot;, is a 19th-century term.

==Earliest unverified bicycle==
There are several early claims regarding the invention of the bicycle, but many remain unverified.

A sketch from around 1500 AD is attributed to Gian Giacomo Caprotti, a pupil of Leonardo da Vinci, but it was described by Hans-Erhard Lessing in 1998 as a purposeful fraud, a description now generally accepted. However, the authenticity of the bicycle sketch is still vigorously maintained by followers of Augusto Marinoni, a lexicographer and philologist, who was entrusted by the Commissione Vinciana of Rome with the transcription of Leonardo&#x27;s Codex Atlanticus.

Later, and equally unverified, is the contention that a certain &quot;Comte de Sivrac&quot; developed a &quot;célérifère&quot; in 1792, demonstrating it at the Palais-Royal in France. The &quot;célérifère&quot; supposedly had two wheels set on a rigid wooden frame and no steering, directional control being limited to that attainable by leaning. A rider was said to have sat astride the machine and pushed it along using alternate feet. It is now thought that the two-wheeled &quot;célérifère&quot; never existed (though there were four-wheelers) and it was instead a misinterpretation by the well-known French journalist Louis Baudry de Saunier in 1891.

In Japan, a pedal-powered tricycle called &#x27;陸舟奔車 (Rikushu-honsha)&#x27; was described in &#x27;新製陸舟奔車之記 (Records of a Newly Made Rikushu-honsha)&#x27; (owned by the Hikone Public Library, Hikone, Japan), written in 1732 by 平石久平次時光 (Hiraishi Kuheiji Tokimitsu) (1696-1771), a retainer of the Hikone domain. However, it was not further developed, and the practical use of bicycles in Japan did not occur until modern bicycles were imported from Europe.

==19th century==

===1817 to 1819: The Draisine or Velocipede===

The first verifiable claim for a practically used bicycle belongs to German Baron Karl von Drais Sauerbronn, a civil servant to the Grand Duke of Baden in Germany. Drais invented his Laufmaschine (German for &quot;running machine&quot;) in 1817, that was called &quot;Draisine&quot; (English) or &quot;draisienne&quot; (French) by the press. Karl von Drais patented this design in 1818, which was the first commercially successful two-wheeled, steerable, human-propelled machine, commonly called a velocipede, and nicknamed hobby-horse or dandy horse. It was initially manufactured in Germany and France.

Hans-Erhard Lessing (Drais&#x27;s biographer) found from circumstantial evidence that Drais&#x27;s interest in finding an alternative to the horse was the starvation and death of horses caused by crop failure in 1816, the Year Without a Summer (following the volcanic eruption of Tambora in 1815).

On his first reported ride from Mannheim on June 12, 1817, he covered 13 km (eight miles) in less than an hour. Constructed almost entirely of wood, the draisine weighed 22 kg (48 pounds), had brass bushings within the wheel bearings, iron shod wheels, a rear-wheel brake and 152 mm (6 inches) of trail of the front-wheel for a self-centering caster effect. This design was welcomed by mechanically minded men daring to balance, and several thousand copies were built and used, primarily in Western Europe and in North America. Its popularity rapidly faded when, partly due to increasing numbers of accidents, some city authorities began to prohibit its use. However, in 1866 Paris a Chinese visitor named Bin Chun could still observe foot-pushed velocipedes. The Draisine is regarded as the first bicycle and Karl von Drais is seen as the &quot;father of the bicycle&quot;.

The concept was picked up by a number of British cartwrights; the most notable was Denis Johnson of London announcing in late 1818 that he would sell an improved model. Johnson called his machine as a pedestrian curricle or velocipede, but the public preferred nicknames like &quot;hobby-horse,&quot; after the children&#x27;s toy or, worse still, &quot;Dandy horse,&quot; after the foppish men, then called dandies, who often rode them. Johnson&#x27;s machine was an improvement on Drais&#x27;s, being notably more elegant: his wooden frame had a serpentine shape instead of Drais&#x27;s straight one, allowing the use of larger wheels without raising the rider&#x27;s seat, but was still the same design.

During the summer of 1819, the &quot;hobby-horse&quot;, thanks in part to Johnson&#x27;s marketing skills and better patent protection, became the craze and fashion in London society. The dandies, the Corinthians of the Regency, adopted it, and therefore the poet John Keats referred to it as &quot;the nothing&quot; of the day. Riders wore out their boots surprisingly rapidly, and the fashion ended within the year, after riders on pavements (sidewalks) were fined two pounds.

===1820s to 1850s: An Era of 3 and 4-Wheelers===

The intervening decades of the 1820s–1850s witnessed many developments concerning human-powered vehicles often using technologies similar to the draisine, even if the idea of a workable two-wheel design, requiring the rider to balance, had been dismissed. These new machines had three wheels (tricycles) or four (quadracycles) and came in a very wide variety of designs, using pedals, treadles, and hand-cranks, but these designs often suffered from high weight and high rolling resistance. However, Willard Sawyer in Dover successfully manufactured a range of treadle-operated 4-wheel vehicles and exported them worldwide in the 1850s.

===1830s: The Reported Scottish Inventions===
The first mechanically propelled two-wheel vehicle is believed by some to have been built by Kirkpatrick Macmillan, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839. A nephew later claimed that his uncle developed a rear-wheel-drive design using mid-mounted treadles connected by rods to a rear crank, similar to the transmission of a steam locomotive. Proponents associate him with the first recorded instance of a bicycling traffic offense, when a Glasgow newspaper reported in 1842 an accident in which an anonymous &quot;gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design&quot; knocked over a pedestrian in the Gorbals and was fined five shillings. However, the evidence connecting this with Macmillan is weak, since it is unlikely that the artisan Macmillan would have been termed a gentleman, nor is the report clear on how many wheels the vehicle had. 

A similar machine was said to have been produced by Gavin Dalzell of Lesmahagow, circa 1845. There is no record of Dalzell ever having laid claim to inventing the machine. It is believed that he copied the idea having recognized the potential to help him with his local drapery business and there is some evidence that he used the contraption to take his wares into the rural community around his home. A replica still exists today in the Riverside Museum in Glasgow. The museum holds the honor of exhibiting the oldest bike in existence today. The first documented producer of rod-driven two-wheelers, treadle bicycles, was Thomas McCall, of Kilmarnock in 1869. The design was inspired by the French front-crank velocipede of the Lallement/Michaux type.

=== 1853 and the invention of the first bicycle with pedal crank &quot;Tretkurbelfahrrad&quot; by Philipp Moritz Fischer ===
Philipp Moritz Fischer, who used the draisine to get to school from the age of 9, invented the pedal crank in 1853. After years of living all over Europe, he left London to go back to his native town of Schweinfurt, Bavaria, when his first son died at a young age. He built the very first bicycle with pedals in 1853; however, he did not make the invention public. The Tretkurbelfahrrad from 1853 is still sustained and is on public display in the municipality museum in Schweinfurt.

=== 1860s and the Michaux &quot;Velocipede&quot;, aka &quot;Boneshaker&quot; ===
The first widespread and commercially successful design was French. An example is at the Canada Science and Technology Museum, in Ottawa, Ontario. Initially developed around 1863, it sparked a fashionable craze briefly during 1868–70. Its design was simpler than the Macmillan bicycle; it used rotary cranks and pedals mounted to the front wheel hub. Pedaling made it easier for riders to propel the machine at speed, but the rotational speed limitation of this design created stability and comfort concerns which would lead to the large front wheel of the &quot;penny farthing&quot;. It was difficult to pedal the wheel that was used for steering. The use of metal frames reduced the weight and provided sleeker, more elegant designs, and also allowed mass-production. Different braking mechanisms were used depending on the manufacturer. In England, the velocipede earned the name of &quot;bone-shaker&quot; because of its rigid frame and iron-banded wheels that resulted in a &quot;bone-shaking experience for riders&quot;.

The velocipede&#x27;s renaissance began in Paris during the late 1860s. Its early history is complex and has been shrouded in some mystery, not least because of conflicting patent claims: all that has been stated for sure is that a French metalworker attached pedals to the front wheel; at present, the earliest year bicycle historians agree on is 1864. The identity of the person who attached cranks is still an open question at International Cycling History Conferences (ICHC). The claims of Ernest Michaux and of Pierre Lallement, and the lesser claims of rear-pedaling Alexandre Lefebvre, have their supporters within the ICHC community.


Bicycle historian David V. Herlihy documents that Lallement claimed to have created the pedal bicycle in Paris in 1863. He had seen someone riding a draisine in 1862 then originally came up with the idea to add pedals to it. It is a fact that he filed the earliest and only patent for a pedal-driven bicycle, in the US in 1866. Lallement&#x27;s patent drawing shows a machine which looks exactly like Johnson&#x27;s draisine, but with the pedals and rotary cranks attached to the front wheel hub, and a thin piece of iron over the top of the frame to act as a spring supporting the seat, for a slightly more comfortable ride.

By the early 1860s, the blacksmith Pierre Michaux, besides producing parts for the carriage trade, was producing &quot;vélocipède à pédales&quot; on a small scale. The wealthy Olivier brothers Aimé and René were students in Paris at this time, and these shrewd young entrepreneurs adopted the new machine. In 1865 they travelled from Paris to Avignon on a velocipede in only eight days. They recognized the potential profitability of producing and selling the new machine. Together with their friend Georges de la Bouglise, they formed a partnership with Pierre Michaux, Michaux et Cie (&quot;Michaux and company&quot;), in 1868, avoiding use of the Olivier family name and staying behind the scenes, lest the venture prove to be a failure. This was the first company which mass-produced bicycles, replacing the early wooden frame with one made of two pieces of cast iron bolted together—otherwise, the early Michaux machines look exactly like Lallement&#x27;s patent drawing. Together with a mechanic named Gabert in his hometown of Lyon, Aimé Olivier created a diagonal single-piece frame made of wrought iron which was much stronger, and as the first bicycle craze took hold, many other blacksmiths began forming companies to make bicycles using the new design. Velocipedes were expensive, and when customers soon began to complain about the Michaux serpentine cast-iron frames breaking, the Oliviers realized by 1868 that they needed to replace that design with the diagonal one which their competitors were already using, and the Michaux company continued to dominate the industry in its first years.

On the new macadam paved boulevards of Paris it was easy riding, although initially still using what was essentially horse coach technology. It was still called &quot;velocipede&quot; in France, but in the United States, the machine was commonly called the &quot;bone-shaker&quot;. Later improvements included solid rubber tires and ball bearings. Lallement had left Paris in July 1865, crossed the Atlantic, settled in Connecticut and patented the velocipede, and the number of associated inventions and patents soared in the US. The popularity of the machine grew on both sides of the Atlantic and by 1868–69 the velocipede craze was strong in rural areas as well. Even in a relatively small city such as Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, there were five velocipede rinks, and riding schools began opening in many major urban centers. Essentially, the velocipede was a stepping stone that created a market for bicycles that led to the development of more advanced and efficient machines.

However, the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 destroyed the velocipede market in France, and the &quot;bone-shaker&quot; enjoyed only a brief period of popularity in the United States, which ended by 1870. There is debate among bicycle historians about why it failed in the United States, but one explanation is that American road surfaces were much worse than European ones, and riding the machine on these roads was simply too difficult. Certainly another factor was that Calvin Witty had purchased Lallement&#x27;s patent, and his royalty demands soon crippled the industry. The UK was the only place where the bicycle never fell completely out of favour.

In 1869, William Van Anden of Poughkeepsie, New York, USA, invented the freewheel for the bicycle. His design placed a ratchet device in the hub of the front wheel (the driven wheel on the &#x27;velocipede&#x27; designs of the time), which allowed the rider to propel himself forward without pedaling constantly. Initially, bicycle enthusiasts rejected the idea of a freewheel because they believed it would complicate the mechanical functions of the bicycle. Bicycle enthusiasts believed that the bicycle was supposed to remain as simple as possible without any additional mechanisms, such as the freewheel.

===1870s: the high-wheel bicycle===
The high-bicycle was the logical extension of the boneshaker, the front wheel enlarging to enable higher speeds (limited by the inside leg measurement of the rider), the rear wheel shrinking and the frame being made lighter. Frenchman Eugène Meyer is now regarded as the father of the high bicycle by the ICHC in place of James Starley. Meyer invented the wire-spoke tension wheel in 1869 and produced a classic high bicycle design until the 1880s.

James Starley in Coventry added the tangent spokes and the mounting step to his famous bicycle named &quot;Ariel&quot;. He is regarded as the father of the British cycling industry. Ball bearings, solid rubber tires and hollow-section steel frames became standard, reducing weight and making the ride much smoother. Depending on the rider&#x27;s leg length, the front wheel could now have a diameter up to 60 in (1.5 m).
Much later, when this type of bicycle was beginning to be replaced by a later design, it came to be referred to as the &quot;ordinary bicycle&quot;. (While it was in common use no such distinguishing adjective was used, since there was then no other kind.) and was later nicknamed &quot;penny-farthing&quot; in England (a penny representing the front wheel, and a coin smaller in size and value, the farthing, representing the rear). They were fast, but unsafe. The rider was high up in the air and traveling at a great speed. If he hit a bad spot in the road he could easily be thrown over the front wheel and be seriously injured (two broken wrists were common, in attempts to break a fall) or even killed. &quot;Taking a header&quot; (also known as &quot;coming a cropper&quot;), was not at all uncommon.

The rider&#x27;s legs were often caught underneath the handlebars, so falling free of the machine was often not possible. The dangerous nature of these bicycles (as well as Victorian mores) made cycling the preserve of adventurous young men. The risk averse, such as elderly gentlemen, preferred the more stable tricycles or quadracycles. In addition, women&#x27;s fashion of the day made the &quot;ordinary&quot; bicycle inaccessible. Queen Victoria owned Starley&#x27;s &quot;Royal Salvo&quot; tricycle, though there is no evidence she actually rode it.

Although French and English inventors modified the velocipede into the high-wheel bicycle, the French were still recovering from the Franco-Prussian war, so English entrepreneurs put the high-wheeler on the English market, and the machine became very popular there, Coventry, Oxford, Birmingham and Manchester being the centers of the English bicycle industry (and of the arms or sewing machine industries, which had the necessary metalworking and engineering skills for bicycle manufacturing, as in Paris and St. Etienne, and in New England). Soon bicycles found their way across the English Channel. By 1875, high-wheel bicycles were becoming popular in France, though ridership expanded slowly.

In 1877, Joseph Henry Hughes&#x27; provisional patent application was allowed, titled &quot;Improvements in the bearings of bicycles and velocipedes or carriages&quot;. Hughes, a local of Birmingham, described a ball bearing race for bicycle and carriage wheels which allowed for initial adjustment of the system to ensure optimal contacts between components, and for subsequent adjustments to compensate for wear of components from use. William Bown, an already successful owner of Bown Manufacturing Company, persuaded Hughes to sell rights to this patent to him. Having patented improvements to sewing machines and horse clippers himself, Bown also persuaded Hughes join him on further bearing innovations for the next decade. This turned into the successful Aeolus brand of ball bearings, used in the first ball-race-pedals and wheel-bearings for bicycles and carriage wheels. 

In the United States, Bostonians such as Frank Weston started importing bicycles in 1877 and 1878, and Albert Augustus Pope started production of his &quot;Columbia&quot; high-wheelers in 1878, and gained control of nearly all applicable patents, starting with Lallement&#x27;s 1866 patent. Pope lowered the royalty (licensing fee) previous patent owners charged, and took his competitors to court over the patents. The courts supported him, and competitors either paid royalties ($10 per bicycle), or he forced them out of business. There seems to have been no patent issue in France, where English bicycles still dominated the market. In 1880, G.W. Pressey invented the high-wheeler American Star Bicycle, whose smaller front wheel was designed to decrease the frequency of &quot;headers&quot;. By 1884 high-wheelers and tricycles were relatively popular among a small group of upper-middle-class people in all three countries, the largest group being in England. Their use also spread to the rest of the world, chiefly because of the extent of the British Empire.

Pope also introduced mechanization and mass production (later copied and adopted by Ford and General Motors), vertically integrated, (also later copied and adopted by Ford), advertised aggressively (as much as ten percent of all advertising in U.S. periodicals in 1898 was by bicycle makers), promoted the Good Roads Movement (which had the side benefit of acting as advertising, and of improving sales by providing more places to ride), and litigated on behalf of cyclists (It would, however, be Western Wheel Works of Chicago which would drastically reduce production costs by introducing stamping to the production process in place of machining, significantly reducing costs, and thus prices.) In addition, bicycle makers adopted the annual model change (later derided as planned obsolescence, and usually credited to General Motors), which proved very successful.

Even so, bicycling remained the province of the urban well-to-do, and mainly men, until the 1890s, and was an example of conspicuous consumption.

===The safety bicycle and the bike bubble: 1880s and 1890s===

The development of the safety bicycle was arguably the most important change in the history of the bicycle. It shifted their use and public perception from being a dangerous toy for sporting young men to being an everyday transport tool for men and women of all ages.

Aside from the obvious safety problems, the high-wheeler&#x27;s direct front wheel drive limited its top speed. One attempt to solve both problems with a chain-driven front wheel was the dwarf bicycle, exemplified by the Kangaroo. Inventors also tried a rear wheel chain drive. Although Harry John Lawson invented a rear-chain-drive bicycle in 1879 with his &quot;bicyclette&quot;, it still had a huge front wheel and a small rear wheel. Detractors called it &quot;The Crocodile&quot;, and it failed in the market.

John Kemp Starley, James Starley&#x27;s nephew, produced the first successful &quot;safety bicycle&quot;, the &quot;Rover,&quot; in 1885, which he never patented. It featured a steerable front wheel that had significant caster, equally sized wheels and a chain drive to the rear wheel.

Widely imitated, the safety bicycle completely replaced the high-wheeler in North America and Western Europe by 1890. Meanwhile, John Dunlop&#x27;s reinvention of the pneumatic bicycle tire in 1888 had made for a much smoother ride on paved streets; the previous type were quite smooth-riding, when used on the dirt roads common at the time. As with the original velocipede, safety bicycles had been much less comfortable than high-wheelers precisely because of the smaller wheel size, and frames were often buttressed with complicated bicycle suspension spring assemblies. The pneumatic tire made all of these obsolete, and frame designers found a diamond pattern to be the strongest and most efficient design.

On 10 October 1899, Isaac R Johnson, an African-American inventor, lodged his patent for a folding bicycle – the first with a recognisably modern diamond frame, the pattern still used in 21st-century bicycles.

The chain drive improved comfort and speed, as the drive was transferred to the non-steering rear wheel and allowed for smooth, relaxed and injury free pedaling (earlier designs that required pedalling the steering front wheel were difficult to pedal while turning, due to the misalignment of rotational planes of leg and pedal). With easier pedaling, the rider more easily turned corners.

The pneumatic tire and the diamond frame improved rider comfort but do not form a crucial design or safety feature. A hard rubber tire on a bicycle is just as rideable but is bone jarring. The frame design allows for a lighter weight, and more simple construction and maintenance, hence lower price.

Most likely the first electric bicycle was built in 1897 by Hosea W. Libbey.
In the middle of the decade, bicycle sales were one of the few areas of the economy where sales were growing despite a severe economic depression, leading hundreds of manufacturers to enter business. This resulted in a downward spiral of market saturation, over-supply and intense price competition, eventually leading to the collapse of many manufacturers as the bicycle bubble burst.

== 20th century ==
===The roadster===
The ladies&#x27; version of the roadster&#x27;s design was very much in place by the 1890s. It had a step-through frame rather than the diamond frame of the gentlemen&#x27;s model so that ladies, with their dresses and skirts, could easily mount and ride their bicycles, and commonly came with a skirt guard to prevent skirts and dresses becoming entangled in the rear wheel and spokes. As with the gents&#x27; roadster, the frame was of steel construction and the positioning of the frame and handlebars gave the rider a very upright riding position. Though they originally came with front spoon-brakes, technological advancements meant that later models were equipped with the much-improved coaster brakes or rod-actuated rim or drum-brakes.
The Dutch cycle industry grew rapidly from the 1890s onwards. Since by then it was the British who had the strongest and best-developed market in bike design, Dutch framemakers either copied them or imported them from England. In 1895, 85 percent of all bikes bought in the Netherlands were from Britain; the vestiges of that influence can still be seen in the solid, gentlemanly shape of a traditional Dutch bike even now.

Though the ladies&#x27; version of the roadster largely fell out of fashion in England and many other Western nations as the 20th century progressed, it remains popular in the Netherlands; this is why some people refer to bicycles of this design as Dutch bikes. In Dutch the name of these bicycles is Omafiets (&quot;grandma&#x27;s bike&quot;).

===Popularity in Europe, decline in US===
Cycling steadily became more important in Europe over the first half of the twentieth century, but it dropped off dramatically in the United States between 1900 and 1910. Automobiles became the preferred means of transportation. Over the 1920s, bicycles gradually became considered children&#x27;s toys, and by 1940 most bicycles in the United States were made for children. In Europe cycling remained an adult activity, and bicycle racing, commuting, and &quot;cyclotouring&quot; were all popular activities. In addition, specialist bicycles for children appeared before 1916.

From the early 20th century until after World War II, the roadster constituted most adult bicycles sold in the United Kingdom and in many parts of the British Empire. For many years after the advent of the motorcycle and automobile, they remained a primary means of adult transport. Major manufacturers in England were Raleigh and BSA, though Carlton, Phillips, Triumph, Rudge-Whitworth, Hercules, and Elswick Hopper also made them.

===Technical innovations===
Bicycles continued to evolve to suit the varied needs of riders. The derailleur developed in France between 1900 and 1910 among cyclotourists, and was improved over time. Only in the 1930s did European racing organizations allow racers to use gearing; until then they were forced to use a two-speed bicycle. The rear wheel had a sprocket on either side of the hub. To change gears, the rider had to stop, remove the wheel, flip it around, and remount the wheel. When racers were allowed to use derailleurs, racing times immediately dropped.

===World War II===

Although multiple-speed bicycles were widely known by this time, most or all military bicycles used in the Second World War were single-speed. Bicycles were used by paratroopers during the war to help them with transportation, creating the term &quot;bomber bikes&quot; to refer to US planes dropping bikes for troops to use. The German &quot;Volksgrenadier&quot; units each had a battalion of bicycle infantry attached. The Invasion of Poland saw many bicycle-riding scouts in use, with each bicycle company using 196 bicycles and 1 motorcycle. By September 1939, there were 41 bicycle companies mobilized.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japan used around 50,000 bicycle troops. The Malayan Campaign saw many bicycles used. The Japanese confiscated bicycles from civilians due to the abundance of bicycles among the civilian population. Japanese bicycle troops were efficient in both speed and carrying capacity, as they could carry of equipment compared to a normal British soldier, who could carry .

===China and the Flying Pigeon===

The Flying Pigeon was at the forefront of the bicycle phenomenon in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The vehicle was the government approved form of transport, and the nation became known as &quot;zixingche wang guo&quot; (自行车王国) the &#x27;Kingdom of Bicycles&#x27;. A bicycle was regarded as one of the three &quot;must-haves&quot; of every citizen, alongside a sewing machine and watch – essential items in life that also offered a hint of wealth. The Flying Pigeon bicycle became a symbol of an egalitarian social system that promised little comfort but a reliable ride through life.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the logo became synonymous with almost all bicycles in the country. The Flying Pigeon became the single most popular mechanized vehicle on the planet, becoming so ubiquitous that Deng Xiaoping — the post-Mao leader who launched China&#x27;s economic reforms in the 1970s — defined prosperity as &quot;a Flying Pigeon in every household&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Flying Pigeon was the country&#x27;s biggest bike manufacturer, selling 3 million cycles in 1986. Its 20-kilo black single-speed models were popular with workers, and there was a waiting list of several years to get one, and even then buyers needed good &quot;guanxi&quot; (relationship) in addition to the purchase cost, which was about four months&#x27; wages for most workers.

===North America: Cruiser vs. racer===
At mid-century there were two predominant bicycle styles for recreational cyclists in North America. Heavyweight cruiser bicycles, preferred by the typical (hobby) cyclist, featuring balloon tires, pedal-driven &quot;coaster&quot; brakes and only one gear, were popular for their durability, comfort, streamlined appearance, and a significant array of accessories (lights, bells, springer forks, speedometers, &quot;etc.&quot;). Lighter cycles, with hand brakes, narrower tires, and a three-speed hub gearing system, often imported from England, first became popular in the United States in the late 1950s. These comfortable, practical bicycles usually offered generator-powered headlamps, safety reflectors, kickstands, and frame-mounted tire pumps. In the United Kingdom, like the rest of Europe, cycling was seen as less of a hobby, and lightweight but durable bikes had been preferred for decades.

In the United States, the sports roadster was imported after World War II, and was known as the &quot;English racer&quot;. It quickly became popular with adult cyclists seeking an alternative to the traditional youth-oriented cruiser bicycle. While the English racer was no racing bike, it was faster and better for climbing hills than the cruiser, thanks to its lighter weight, tall wheels, narrow tires, and internally geared rear hubs. In the late 1950s, U.S. manufacturers such as Schwinn began producing their own &quot;lightweight&quot; version of the English racer.
In the late 1960s, Americans&#x27; increasing consciousness of the value of exercise and later the advantage of energy efficient transportation led to the American bike boom of the 1970s. Annual U.S. sales of adult bicycles doubled between 1960 and 1970, and doubled again between 1971 and 1975, the peak years of the adult cycling boom in the United States, eventually reaching nearly 17 million units.

Most of these sales were to new cyclists, who overwhelmingly preferred models imitating popular European derailleur-equipped racing bikesvariously called &quot;sports&quot; models, &quot;sport/tourers&quot;, or simply &quot;ten-speeds&quot;to the older &quot;roadsters&quot; with hub gears which remained much the same as they had been since the 1930s. These lighter bicycles, long used by serious cyclists and by racers, featured dropped handlebars, narrow tires, derailleur gears, five to fifteen speeds, and a narrow &#x27;racing&#x27; type saddle. By 1980, racing and sport/touring derailleur bikes dominated the market in North America. Fatbike was invented for off-road usage in 1980.

===Europe===
In Britain, the utility roadster declined noticeably in popularity during the early 1970s, as a boom in recreational cycling caused manufacturers to concentrate on lightweight (), affordable derailleur sport bikes, actually slightly-modified versions of the racing bicycle of the era.

In the early 1980s, Swedish company &quot;Itera&quot; invented a new type of bicycle, made entirely of plastic. It was a commercial failure.

In the 1980s, UK cyclists began to shift from road-only bicycles to all-terrain models such as the mountain bike. The mountain bike&#x27;s sturdy frame and load-carrying ability gave it additional versatility as a utility bike, usurping the role previously filled by the roadster. By 1990, the roadster was almost dead; while annual UK bicycle sales reached an all-time record of 2.8 million, almost all of them were mountain and road/sport models.

===BMX bikes===
BMX bikes are specially designed bicycles that usually have 16 to 24-inch wheels (the norm being the 20-inch wheel), which originated in the state of California in the early 1970s when teenagers imitated their motocross heroes on their bicycles. Children were racing standard road bikes off-road, around purpose-built tracks in the Netherlands. The 1971 motorcycle racing documentary &quot;On Any Sunday&quot; is generally credited with inspiring the movement nationally in the US. In the opening scene, kids are shown riding their Schwinn Sting-Rays off-road. It was not until the middle of the decade the sport achieved critical mass, and manufacturers began creating bicycles designed specially for the sport.

It has grown into an international sport with several different disciplines such as Freestyle, Racing, Street, and Flatland.

===Mountain bikes===

In 1981, the first mass-produced mountain bike appeared, intended for use off-pavement over a variety of surfaces. It was an immediate success, and examples flew off retailers&#x27; shelves during the 1980s, their popularity spurred by the novelty of all-terrain cycling and the increasing desire of urban dwellers to escape their surroundings &quot;via&quot; mountain biking and other extreme sports. These cycles featured sturdier frames, wider tires with large knobs for increased traction, a more upright seating position (to allow better visibility and shifting of body weight), and increasingly, various front and rear suspension designs. By 2000, mountain bike sales had far outstripped that of racing, sport/racer, and touring bicycles.

== 21st century ==
The 21st century has seen a continued application of technology to bicycles (which started in the 20th century): in designing them, building them, and using them. Bicycle frames and components continue to get lighter and more aerodynamic without sacrificing strength largely through the use of computer aided design, finite element analysis, and computational fluid dynamics. Recent discoveries about bicycle stability have been facilitated by computer simulations. Once designed, new technology is applied to manufacturing such as hydroforming and automated carbon fiber layup. Finally, electronic gadgetry has expanded from just cyclocomputers to now include cycling power meters and electronic gear-shifting systems.

===Hybrid and commuter bicycles===
In recent years, bicycle designs have trended towards increased specialization, as the number of casual, recreational and commuter cyclists has grown. For these groups, the industry responded with the &quot;hybrid&quot; bicycle, sometimes marketed as a &quot;city bike&quot;, &quot;cross bike&quot;, or &quot;commuter bike&quot;. Hybrid bicycles combine elements of road racing and mountain bikes, though the term is applied to a wide variety of bicycle types.

Hybrid bicycles and commuter bicycles can range from fast and light racing-type bicycles with flat bars and other minimal concessions to casual use, to wider-tired bikes designed for primarily for comfort, load-carrying, and increased versatility over a range of different road surfaces. Enclosed hub gears have become popular again – now with up to 8, 11 or 14 gears – for such bicycles due to ease of maintenance and improved technology.

===Recumbent bicycle===
The recumbent bicycle was invented in 1893. In 1934, the Union Cycliste Internationale banned recumbent bicycles from all forms of officially sanctioned racing, at the behest of the conventional bicycle industry, after relatively little-known Francis Faure beat world champion Henri Lemoine and broke Oscar Egg&#x27;s hour record by half a mile while riding Mochet&#x27;s Velocar. Some authors assert that this resulted in the stagnation of the upright racing bike&#x27;s frame geometry which has remained essentially unchanged for 70 years. This stagnation finally started to reverse with the formation of the International Human Powered Vehicle Association which holds races for &quot;banned&quot; classes of bicycle. Sam Whittingham set a human powered speed record of 132 km/h (82 mph) on level ground in a faired recumbent streamliner in 2009 at Battle Mountain.

While historically most bike frames have been steel, recent designs, particularly of high-end racing bikes, have made extensive use of carbon and aluminum frames.

Recent years have also seen a resurgence of interest in balloon tire cruiser bicycles for their low-tech comfort, reliability, and style.

In addition to influences derived from the evolution of American bicycling trends, European, Asian and African cyclists have also continued to use traditional roadster bicycles, as their rugged design, enclosed chainguards, and dependable hub gearing make them ideal for commuting and utility cycling duty.

<text>The St. Leger family is an old Anglo-Irish family with Norman roots. The surname is written and pronounced in several way including Sallinger or Sallenger ( ). The oldest French and English records of the family use the Latin form . 

==St. Legers in history==
The English family took its name from Saint-Léger-aux-Bois, in the modern French département of Seine Maritime, and they were tenants of the Counts of Eu in both France and England. The first clear use of the surname in England is in the 1086 Domesday Book entry for Bexhill-on-Sea, near Hastings in Sussex, which lists Robert St. Leger as one of the tenants there under Robert, Count of Eu, lord of Hastings. This Robert was probably also holding Fairlight. It has also been suggested that another Domesday Book ancestor of the family is William, mentioned without surname, who held Cortesley (between Bexhill and Hastings), and Wartling under the count of Eu, both of which were later lordships of a St. Leger family, who also held Fairlight. The later St. Leger family of Ulcombe in Kent, also tenants of the counts of Eu, are generally believed to be relatives of the St. Leger family of Wartling and Fairlight.

St. Legers of notable historical interest include:
*Bishop Thomas St. Leger 1240–1320 was the Archdeacon of Kells.
*In 1377, Thomas St. Leger, resided at Otterden in Kent, and also became the owner of East Hall Manor in Murston.
*Sir Thomas Saint Leger (1440-1483) was a Knight of the Bath and Ambassador to France. He married Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter. Upon Edward IV of England&#x27;s death in 1483, St. Leger was beheaded by Richard III of England. 
*John St. Leger (died 1441) of Ulcombe was Sheriff of Kent in 1430.
*Anthony St Leger (Lord Deputy of Ireland) (1496–1559), served as Lord Deputy in Ireland.
*Anthony St Leger (Master of the Rolls) ( 1535–1613), English-born judge and Master of the Rolls in Ireland.
*Sir William St. Leger, President of the province of Munster in Ireland (1586–1642)
* Sir John St Leger (1674-1743), judge of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland), father of Generals Anthony and Barry St Leger
*Anthony St Leger (British Army officer) (1731–1786), Member of Parliament for Grimsby and Governor of St Lucia.
*Colonel Barry St. Leger, British colonel involved in the American Revolutionary War (1737–1789); he was Anthony&#x27;s brother 
*St Leger St Leger, 1st Viscount Doneraile (d. 1787) Irish Member of Parliament for Doneraile
*Frederick York St Leger, founder of the &quot;Cape Times&quot;.
*Colonel Stratford Edward St Leger , Anglo-Boer War diarist and artist, World War I (1867–1935)

<doc id="1042651" wikidata="Q1193891" url="?curid=1042651" title="Retrograde amnesia">
<text>In neurology, retrograde amnesia (RA) is the inability to access memories or information from before an injury or disease occurred. RA differs from a similar condition called anterograde amnesia (AA), which is the inability to form new memories following injury or disease onset. Although an individual can have both RA and AA at the same time, RA can also occur on its own; this &#x27;pure&#x27; form of RA can be further divided into three types: focal, isolated, and pure RA. RA negatively affects an individual&#x27;s episodic, autobiographical, and declarative memory, but they can still form new memories because RA leaves procedural memory intact. Depending on its severity, RA can result in either temporally graded or more permanent memory loss. However, memory loss usually follows Ribot&#x27;s law, which states that individuals are more likely to lose recent memories than older memories. Diagnosing RA generally requires using an Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI) and observing brain structure through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a computed tomography scan (CT), or electroencephalography (EEG).

== Types ==
=== Temporally graded RA ===
Memory loss in patients with temporally graded RA strongly follows Ribot&#x27;s law, meaning that one will experience more memory loss for events closer to the injury or disease onset. This type of RA is commonly triggered in individuals with Korsakoff syndrome due to a combination of long-term alcohol use and Wernicke encephalopathy. Debate has risen about why this temporal gradient forms in the first place. Initial theories proposed that the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe are not nearly as important for long-term memories compared to short-term memories. As memory processing occurs in the brain over time, neocortical regions can directly communicate with each other, so they do not rely as heavily on the hippocampus for long-term memory storage. Therefore, if an individual experiences RA that damages the hippocampus, they will lose more short-term memories according to this theory. However, this theory has been challenged by the multiple-trace theory, which claims that the brain develops a hippocampal trace each time a memory is retrieved. Since more hippocampal traces are present for older memories, it is easier for older memories to remain intact when RA occurs.

=== Focal, isolated, and pure RA ===
An absence of anterograde amnesia (AA) characterizes pure forms of RA, which fall into three main categories: focal, isolated, and pure RA. Slight differences in the use of these terms to describe a pure form of RA are summarized below:
== Causes ==
RA commonly results from damage to regions of the brain that are associated with episodic and declarative memory, including autobiographical information. In extreme cases, individuals may completely forget who they are. Generally, this is a more severe type of amnesia known as global, or generalized amnesia. However, memory loss can also be selective or categorical, manifested by a person&#x27;s inability to remember events related to a specific incident or topic. Patients also differ in durations of RA (how long they can&#x27;t recall information) and durations of what is forgotten (past time frame for which information is unavailable).

During consolidation, the hippocampus acts as an intermediate tool that quickly stores new information until it is transferred to the neocortex for the long-term. The temporal lobe, which holds the hippocampus, entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices, has a reciprocal connection with the neocortex. The temporal lobe is temporarily needed when consolidating new information; as the learning becomes stronger, the neocortex becomes more independent of the temporal lobe.

Studies on specific cases demonstrate how particular impaired areas of the hippocampus are associated with the severity of RA. Damage can be limited to the CA1 field of the hippocampus, causing very limited RA for about one to two years. More extensive damage limited to the hippocampus causes temporally graded amnesia for 15 to 25 years. Another study suggests that large medial temporal lobe lesions, that extend laterally to include other regions, produce more extensive RA, covering 40 to 50 years. These findings suggest that density of RA becomes more severe and long-term as the damage extends beyond the hippocampus to surrounding structures.

=== Traumatic brain injury (TBI) ===
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs from an external force that causes structural damage to the brain, such as a sharp blow to the head, a diffuse axonal injury, or childhood brain damage (e.g., shaken baby syndrome). In cases of sudden rapid acceleration, the brain continues moving around in the skull, harming brain tissue as it hits internal protrusions.

TBI varies according to impact of external forces, location of structural damage, and severity of damage ranging from mild to severe. Retrograde amnesia can be one of the many consequences of brain injury but it is not always the outcome of TBI. An example of a subgroup of people who are often exposed to TBI are individuals who are involved in high-contact sports. Research on football players takes a closer look at some of the implications to their high-contact activities. Enduring consistent head injuries can have an effect on the neural consolidation of memory.

Specific cases, such as that of patient ML, support the evidence that severe blows to the head can cause the onset of RA. In this specific case there was an onset of isolated RA following a severe head injury. The brain damage did not affect the person&#x27;s ability to form new memories. Therefore, the idea that specific sections of retrograde memory are independent of anterograde is supported. Normally, there is a very gradual recovery, however, a dense period of amnesia immediately preceding the trauma usually persists.

=== Traumatic events ===
RA can occur without any anatomical damage to the brain, lacking an observable neurobiological basis. Primarily referred to as psychogenic amnesia or psychogenic fugue, it often occurs due to a traumatic situation that individuals wish to consciously or unconsciously avoid through intrapsychic conflicts or unconscious repressions. The onset of psychogenic amnesia can be either global (i.e., individual forgets all history) or situation specific (i.e., individual is unable to retrieve memories of specific situations).

Patients experiencing psychogenic amnesia have impaired episodic memory, instances of wandering and traveling, and acceptance of a new identity as a result of inaccessible memories pertaining to their previous identity.

Recent research has begun to investigate the effects of stress and fear-inducing situations with the onset of RA. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is the process by which there is a signal transmission between neurons after the activation of a neuron, which has been known to play a strong role in the hippocampus in learning and memory. Common changes in the hippocampus have been found to be related to stress and induced LTP. The commonalities support the idea that variations of stress can play a role in producing new memories as well as the onset of RA for other memories. The amygdala plays a crucial role in memory and can be affected by emotional stimuli, evoking RA.

Studies of specific cases, such as &#x27;AMN&#x27;, support evidence of traumatic experiences as a plausible cause of RA. AMN escaped a small fire in his house, did not inhale any smoke, and had no brain damage. Nevertheless, he was unable to recall autobiographical knowledge the next day. This case shows that RA can occur in the absence of structural brain damage.

After a traumatic head injury, emotional disturbances can occur at three different levels: neurological, reactionary, and long-term disturbances. Neurological disturbances can change emotional and motivational responses. Reactionary disturbances effect emotional and motivational responses as well, but reflect the failure to cope with environmental demands. Someone with this might withdraw from the environment that they are placed in because they no longer know how to handle the cognitive resources.

=== Nutritional deficiency ===
RA has been found among alcohol-dependent patients who have Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome. Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome patients develop retrograde amnesia due to a thiamine deficiency (lack of vitamin B1). Also, chronic alcohol use disorders are associated with a decrease in the volume of the left and right hippocampus.

These patients&#x27; regular diet consists mostly of hard alcohol intake, which lacks the necessary nutrients for typical development and maintenance. Therefore, after a prolonged time consuming primarily alcohol, these people undergo memory difficulties and ultimately develop RA. However, some of the drawbacks of using Korsakoff patients to study RA is the progressive nature of the illness and the unknown time of onset.

=== Infections ===
Infections that pass the blood–brain barrier can cause brain damage (encephalitis), sometimes resulting in the onset of RA. In the case of patient &#x27;SS&#x27;, the infection led to focal or isolated retrograde amnesia where there was an absence of or limited AA. Brain scans show abnormalities in the bilateral medial temporal lobes, including two thirds of the hippocampal formation and the posterior part of the amygdala.

=== Surgery ===
Henry Molaison had epilepsy that progressed and worsened by his late twenties. The severity of his condition caused him to undergo surgery in an effort to prevent his seizures. Unfortunately, due to a lack of overall known neurological knowledge, Molaison&#x27;s surgeons removed his bilateral medial temporal lobe, causing profound AA and RA. The removed brain structures included the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the parahippocampal gyrus, now called the medial temporal lobe memory system. HM was one of the most studied memory cases to date and started the examination of neurological structures in relation to memory.

Patients who have RA due to surgery are &quot;P.B.&quot; and &quot;F.C.&quot; who had unilateral removal of the medial areas in the left temporal lobe.

=== Controlled induction ===
Clinically induced RA has been achieved using different forms of electrical induction.
* Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), used as a depression therapy, can cause impairments in memory. Tests show that information from days and weeks before the ECT can be permanently lost. The results of this study also show that severity of RA is more extreme in cases of bilateral ECT rather than unilateral ECT. Impairments can also be more intense if ECT is administered repetitively (sine wave simulation) as opposed to a single pulse (brief-pulse stimulation).
* Electroconvulsive shock (ECS): The research in this field has been advanced by using animals as subjects. This is done to further understand RA.

==Diagnosis ==

Since RA affects people&#x27;s memories to varying degrees, testing is required to fully diagnose RA; these tests, however, are inherently limited if a patient&#x27;s previous neuropathological medical history is unknown. As a result, some clinicians diagnose RA by testing patients about factual knowledge, such as current public events. This testing is limited, however, because people&#x27;s knowledge about current events differs. Furthermore, these tests must be adjusted to account for the time period that a patient is alive, which affects the amount of detail included in the questions. Since some information obtained from this testing is subjective, it is difficult to verify how accurately memories are recalled; this difficulty is especially true for memories from the distant past.

To avoid these issues, many researchers test for RA using the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI). The AMI asks patients targeted questions about three different portions of their life: childhood, early adult life, and recent life. For each period of that individual&#x27;s life, researchers ask questions that require the patient to use either their autobiographical or semantic memory. Through the AMI, researchers can better understand the types of memories affected, as well as the degree of a patient&#x27;s RA. These AMIs can then be used alongside functional brain imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography scans (CT) and electroencephalography (EEG) that detect brain damage in patients with RA.

== Brain structures ==
The most commonly affected areas are associated with episodic and declarative memory such as the hippocampus, the diencephalon, and the temporal lobes.
* The hippocampus deals largely with memory consolidation, where information from the working memory and short-term memory is encoded into long-term storage for future retrieval. Amnesic patients with damage to the hippocampus are able to demonstrate some degree of unimpaired semantic memory, despite a loss of episodic memory, due to spared parahippocampal cortex. In other words, retrograde amnesics &quot;know&quot; about information or skill, but cannot &quot;remember&quot; how they do.
* The diencephalon and the surrounding areas&#x27; role in memory is not well understood. However, this structure appears to be involved in episodic memory recall. 
* The temporal lobes are essential for semantic and factual memory processing. Aside from helping to consolidate memory with the hippocampus, the temporal lobes are extremely important for semantic memory. Damage to this region of the brain can result in the impaired organization and categorization of verbal material, disturbance of language comprehension, and impaired long-term memory. The right frontal lobe is critical for the retrieval of episodic information, while the left frontal region is more active for the retrieval of semantic information. Lesions in the right hemisphere and right frontal lobes result in the impaired recall of non-verbal material, such as music and drawings. Difficulties in studying this region of the brain extends to its duties in comprehension, naming objects, verbal memory, and other language functions.

Brain plasticity has helped explain the recovery process of brain damage induced retrograde amnesia, where neuro-structures use different neural pathways to avoid the damaged areas while still performing their tasks. Thus, the brain can learn to be independent of the impaired hippocampus, but only to a certain extent.
For example, older memories are consolidated over time and in various structures of the brain, including Wernicke&#x27;s area and the neocortex, making retrieval through alternate pathways possible.

== Case studies ==
Since researchers are interested in examining the effects of disrupted brain areas and conducting experiments for further understanding of an unaffected, normal brain, many individuals with brain damage have volunteered to undergo countless tests to advance our scientific knowledge of the human brain. For example, Henry Molaison (HM) was someone with significant brain damage and participated in a lot of neurological research. Furthermore, he was also the most tested person in neuropsychology. All living people who participate are referred to in literature using only their initials to protect privacy.

Each case of RA has led to different symptoms and durations, where some patients have exhibited an inability to describe future plans, whether in the near future (e.g., this afternoon) or in the distant future (e.g., next summer) because of their inability to consolidate memories. Furthermore, researchers have also found that some patients can identify themselves and loved ones in photographs, but cannot determine the time or place the photo was taken. It has also been found that patients with RA greatly differ from the general population in remembering past events.

A few case examples are:
* After a head injury, AB had to relearn personal information. Many of AB&#x27;s habits had also changed.
* Patient CD reported disorientation of place and time following his injuries as well as relearning previously learned information and activities (e.g., using a razor).
* EF was examined and found to be very confused about social norms (e.g., appropriate attire outside his home). EF exhibited memory loss of his personal experiences (e.g., childhood), and the impaired ability to recognize his wife and parents.
* JG is the first recorded patient with isolated RA.
* GH, a mother and a wife, had surgery in August 2002. When GH woke up after the surgery, she believed it was May 1989. Due to her amnesia, GH experienced great difficulty in her social environment, being overwhelmed by relationships to others.
* DH, a learning disabilities instructor and husband, sustained a closed head injury. He did not show any normal signs of memory loss but he could not recall anything prior to the accident.
* CDA is a 20-year-old man who fell and experienced head trauma after being unconscious for a little less than an hour. He had a self-identity loss and a retrograde deficit limited to the autobiographical events 5 years before the trauma. He often showed signs of spontaneous speech that was iterative and sometimes incoherent. When he saw his family and friends, he was shocked at how old they looked because he remembered them from 5 years earlier. This case also included amnesia for procedural skills like the fear of shaving or driving, which ultimately was overcome. There were no psychological, neuropsychological, or brain damage problems. His recovery of memory was progressive and spontaneous, where after several months the amnesia was limited to the two years preceding the trauma. This was a classic case of PRA.
* GC was a 38 year old accountant that was found in a town square unable to remember anything about himself and unaware of where he was and how he got there. He was eventually able to recall basic information about himself and his family, but could not recall emotionally charged autobiographical events pertaining to the last 7 years of his life. Within 3–4 days, it was determined that his autobiographical amnesia was clearly and strictly selective for professional events, as he could remember everything that was not related to his job. It was ultimately learned that the job had created severe emotional stress and anxiety due to the extreme hours that triggered a sudden fugue state. He was eventually able to recover most of his memories minus a single work event where he had stolen money from the company. This was a classic case of psychogenic amnesia.
* AF is a 15-year-old boy who hit his head and lost consciousness. He could not remember anything but was able to play songs on the piano, showing that his procedural memory was still intact. He gradually recovered some memories within the first 2–3 days but had autobiographical amnesia as well as significant memory loss for famous public facts and events for the 2 years prior to the injury.
* L is 19-year-old student who was left with the inability to recall episodic memories after experiencing a fugue state in December 2020. However, he was able to recall things such as his birthday and the street names of Nantes, the city where he resides in. L was part of a case study that associated reduced pupil size as a possible indicator of RA.

Although it may seem that people living with brain damage have great difficulty continuing the usual day-to-day aspects, they still can accomplish many feats. People with RA are able to lead a normal life. For instance, KC is a man who has many functional aspects intact; normal intelligence, unaffected perceptual and linguistic skills, short-term memory, social skills, and reasoning abilities. All of these things are necessary in everyday life and contribute to normal living. KC also is fully capable of scripted activities (e.g., making reservations or changing a flat tire).
In addition, patient HC graduated high school and continued into post-secondary studies, an obvious accomplishment despite her condition. DH relearned his childhood memories from his parents and can retell the stories, but cannot recall specifics other than what has been told to him.

== Other forms of amnesia ==
Other forms of amnesia exist and may be confused with RA. For instance, anterograde amnesia (AA) is the inability to learn new information. This describes a problem encoding, storing, or retrieving information that can be used in the future. It is important to note that these two conditions can, and often do both occur in the same patient simultaneously, but are otherwise separate forms of amnesia.

RA can also be an inherent aspect of other forms of amnesia, namely transient global amnesia (TGA). TGA is the sudden onset of AA and RA caused by a traumatic event, however it is short lived, typically lasting only 4 to 8 hours TGA is very difficult to study because of the patients&#x27; quick recovery. This form of amnesia, like AA, remains distinct from RA.

Post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) is a state of confusion that occurs immediately following a traumatic brain injury in which the injured person is disoriented and unable to remember events that occur after the injury.

Psychogenic amnesia, or dissociative amnesia, is a memory disorder characterized by sudden retrograde autobiographical memory loss, said to occur for a period of time ranging from hours to years.

<text>The Kvichak River ( ; Yup&#x27;ik: &quot;Kuicaraq&quot;) is a large river, about long, in southwestern Alaska in the United States. It flows southwest from Lake Iliamna to Kvichak Bay, an arm of Bristol Bay, on the Alaska Peninsula. The communities of Igiugig and Levelock lie along the Kvichak River. The Kvichak is navigable along its entire length, and is used as a short cut by boats getting between Cook Inlet and Bristol Bay via the Lake Iliamna portage.

The Kvichak River is home to the largest red salmon run in the world. Commercial harvests are worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars annually.

The Kvichak River is part of the watershed downstream of the proposed Pebble Mine.

Historically, the river was navigated and subsistence fished by local Alaska Natives. The name of the river means &quot;from&quot;- or &quot;up to&quot;- &quot;great water&quot;, a reference to Iliamna Lake, Alaska&#x27;s largest freshwater lake.

The Kvichak River was a finalist for the 2017 Riverprize Award for being one of the best-managed and sustainable rivers in the world.

<doc id="1042669" wikidata="Q1543039" url="?curid=1042669" title="Winston Field">
<text>Winston Joseph Field (6 June 1904 – 17 March 1969) was a British politician who served as the seventh Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. Field was a former Dominion Party MP who founded the Rhodesian Front political party with Ian Smith.

==Early life==
Field was born and raised in Bromsgrove and attended Bromsgrove School as a day student, in Worcestershire, England, and moved to Southern Rhodesia at the age of 17 in 1921. A tobacco farmer near Marandellas (now known as Marondera), in Mashonaland East, Field was President of the powerful Rhodesian Tobacco Association from 1938 to 1940, when he left for military service during the Second World War.

Initially enlisting in the Rhodesian Forces as a sergeant, he was court-martialled and demoted to the rank of private for striking a subordinate. Field then transferred to the British Forces, joining the Worcestershire Regiment as a Second Lieutenant from 1941, served in the D-Day Normandy landings in 1944, and ended the war with the rank of Major in the 6th Durham Light Infantry.

==Early political career==
Field was first elected to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Federal Assembly for Mrewa in a 1957 by-election under the Dominion Party ticket. The Federation Minister of Justice, Julian Greenfield, found him &quot;somewhat impulsive and opinionated but entirely straightforward&quot;.

When the Rhodesian Front was founded in early-1962 by Ian Smith and Douglas &quot;Boss&quot; Lilford; a very wealthy right-wing tobacco farmer, they needed an establishment figurehead and Field was chosen. He was a solid, trustworthy figure and no racist, even though &quot;nearly everyone else in the new party was to the right of him&quot;. His wife said &quot;he didn&#x27;t really want to take it on, he wasn&#x27;t really a political animal&quot;.

==Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia==
The &quot;imperious and intolerant&quot; Field was elected, to his and many others&#x27; surprise, as Rhodesia&#x27;s first Rhodesian Front Prime Minister at the 1962 general election and served until he was replaced by Ian Smith in 1964. Field lent an air of respectability to the Rhodesian Front government, though his Cabinet was derided by one newspaper as &quot;by no means an inspiring list&quot;. Broader afield, the Australian journal &quot;The Bulletin&quot; noted of Field that &quot;those who know him best do not for a moment suppose that Winston Field has been slow to attract attention because he is personally diffident or lacking in character. On the contrary, they see him as a man of cold reserve, not softened by his past defeats, not at all intimidated by the terrible power over other men’s lives now put into his hands by the white voters of Southern Rhodesia.&quot;

At the time of Field&#x27;s election, it was assumed that the UK would delay the process of independence for Rhodesia until &quot;an African majority assumed power in Salisbury&quot;. Many in the Rhodesian Front felt that Field did not fight hard enough for independence, in particular that the British had hoodwinked him on visits to London in June 1963 and January 1964 over promises of independence. His relatively short tenure in office saw the dissolution of the Central African Federation on 31 December 1963, though he did win the majority of the Federation&#x27;s military and other assets for Southern Rhodesia.

Field&#x27;s Cabinet included John Gaunt, a former Federal MP for Lusaka and a former District Commissioner in Northern Rhodesia. Aware of discontent in Cabinet fomented by Gaunt, Field demanded his resignation in the spring of 1964. Gaunt asked him to wait over the weekend whilst he cleared up some matters in his office. In that time, Gaunt and Smith organised a plot against Field, now seen as ineffectual after his failure to win independence. Ken Flower, head of Rhodesia&#x27;s Central Intelligence Organisation, an organisation Field had ordered be set up, had in fact warned him sometime previously there was a conspiracy against him, involving several of his ministers.

The caucus of the Rhodesian Front decided to ask for his resignation on 2 April 1964 and the decision was conveyed to Field the next day, though the formal demand was not made until a Cabinet meeting a few days later. Field was replaced as leader of the Rhodesian Front and as Prime Minister of Rhodesia by Ian Smith on 14 April 1964, despite the Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs urging him to fight against the rebels in his party.

==Later life==
Field retired from parliament at the May 1965 election, at which the Rhodesian Front under Ian Smith was returned with a greater majority, and was succeeded in his Marandellas seat by David Smith.

Field died at the age of 64 in Salisbury, Rhodesia, in 1969. On his death, Clifford Dupont, serving as Officer Administering the Government since Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965, observed: &quot;Some day the story will be told of how much this country owes to Mr. Winston Field, who devoted his whole life to the good of Rhodesia. I, myself, have lost a friend, and I join Rhodesians everywhere in mourning the passing of this great patriot.&quot;

<text>DPCX (Distributed Processing Control eXecutive) was an operating system for the IBM 8100 small computer system. IBM hoped it would help their installed base of IBM 3790 customers migrate to the 8100 and the DPPX operating system. It was mainly deployed to support a word processing system, &quot;Distributed Office Support Facility&quot; (DOSF) which was derived from the earlier IBM 3730 word processing system.

Like DPPX, it was written in the PL/S-like PL/DS language. The applications, including much of DOSF, however, were written an interpreted language that was &quot;compiled&quot; using the System/370 assembler macro facility.

The 8100/DPCX/DOSF system was the first type of distributed system to connect to the IBM Distributed Office Support System (DISOSS) running on data host. Later versions of DISOSS relied on SNA Distribution System (SNADS) and eventually became peer-to-peer communication of documents which complied with Document Interchange Architecture (DIA) and Document Content Architecture (DCA) as other types of distributed system gained DISOSS support – Scanmaster, Displaywriter, and 5520 Office System.

<doc id="1042678" wikidata="Q3523258" url="?curid=1042678" title="The Wake (UK band)">
<text>The Wake are a British post-punk, synth-pop and later indie pop band, formed in Glasgow in 1981 by Gerard &quot;Caesar&quot; McInulty (formerly of Altered Images), Steven Allen (drums) and Joe Donnelly (bass), the latter replaced by Bobby Gillespie. Steven&#x27;s sister Carolyn Allen also joined on keyboards, and remained in the band thereafter. Gillespie left the band in 1983, replaced by Martin Cunning and then by Alexander &#x27;Mac&#x27; Macpherson.

==History==
The Wake released their first single on their own Scan 45 label, coupling together &quot;On Our Honeymoon&quot; and &quot;Give Up&quot;. This single eventually caught the attention of New Order manager Rob Gretton, who helped the band sign to Factory Records in 1982 and record an LP (&quot;Harmony&quot;) at Strawberry Studios in Stockport. This was followed by a number of singles on Factory and its Belgian sister label Factory Benelux. In 1983, The Wake toured with New Order, and thus received critical attention but were often unfavourably compared to their more celebrated labelmates. Gillespie was asked to leave in 1983, subsequently playing drums with The Jesus and Mary Chain and achieving fame with his own band Primal Scream. After a short-lived stint with McInulty&#x27;s ex-classmate Martin Cunning on bass, Alexander &#x27;Mac&#x27; Macpherson permanently replaced Gillespie. That same year the band recorded a session on John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 programme and David &#x27;Kid&#x27; Jensen&#x27;s BBC radio 1 show. The band toured extensively and scored an indie hit with their 1984 single &quot;Talk About The Past&quot; which featured Vini Reilly of Durutti Column on piano. The recording and release of their seminal 1985 album &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot; marked the apex of their career. Further releases were few and far between: one more single &quot;Of The Matter&quot; emerged in 1985 before their last release for Factory, a 4-track EP entitled &quot;Something That No One Else Could Bring&quot; finally appeared in 1987.

In 1988, disillusioned with the lack of proper promotion and indeed apathy from Factory Records, The Wake left the label and signed to Bristol&#x27;s legendary Sarah Records, releasing two singles and two LPs, the last being 1994&#x27;s &quot;Tidal Wave of Hype&quot;. By this point, once again down to a three piece featuring McInulty, Allen and Allen, they also shared personnel with another Glasgow-based band on Sarah, The Orchids, with whom they had also played a few live gigs. When Sarah shut down in 1995, The Wake effectively dissolved.

For a few years, McInulty concentrated on other activities outside of recording music – notably writing scripts for plays that featured Allen in an acting role. McInulty and Allen eventually took up writing music again, and after a few tentative demos for possible new material later hooked up with Bobby Wratten (The Field Mice/Northern Picture Library/Trembling Blue Stars) under the name The Occasional Keepers. They released the albums &quot;The Beauty of an Empty Vessel&quot; and &quot;True North&quot; on LTM Recordings, which also incidentally reissued the entire Wake, Field Mice and Orchids back catalogues on remastered CDs containing all the original albums and single/EP cuts collected together.

==Recent developments==
In autumn 2009, The Wake (McInulty and Allen) came together once again to record a new album, &quot;A Light Far Out&quot;, the recording of which took time to complete. On 12 December 2009 the group performed live with other Factory labelmates such as Section 25 and A Certain Ratio, at the Plan K venue in Brussels.

On 28 February 2010, the band performed a 45-minute set at the London Popfest at the Islington venue, the Lexington. They were a last-minute replacement for another band who had dropped out. The set included early tracks such as &quot;Testament&quot;, &quot;The Old Men&quot; and &quot;Favour&quot;, as well as &quot;O Pamela&quot; and &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot;, from their Factory Records period, plus later Sarah Records recordings. Since then the group have also performed in New York and Paris.

In December 2011, the band revealed in an interview with Jacob Graham of The Drums that the new album &quot;A Light Far Out&quot; was set for release in early 2012.

The album &quot;A Light Far Out&quot; was released on CD in April 2012 on LTM Records, containing 7 vocal tracks and 1 instrumental, &quot;Faintness&quot;. The group marked Record Store Day in 2013 with a vinyl release of the album on the revived Factory Benelux imprint, and in July 2013 performed at the Indietracks Festival.

Further reissues of their first two Factory albums came in 2013 - with a double vinyl edition of &quot;Harmony&quot; which coupled the original album with the 12&quot; single &quot;Something Outside&quot; plus three radio session tracks. This was released by Factory Benelux. Their second album &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot; was then reissued in a special commemorative Record Store Day-only format, by US label Captured Tracks, comprising a hardback slipcase containing the original album plus a bonus album of singles and EP tracks that were issued between 1983 and 1987, together with an exclusive pamphlet/lithograph containing a band interview.

Autumn 2014 saw the first ever definitive compilation of The Wake&#x27;s previously released material, titled &quot;Testament - Best Of&quot; and released by Factory Benelux in vinyl and CD formats. The vinyl format featured a slightly abbreviated track listing to the CD, but also came with a special bonus CD composed wholly of previously unreleased demos and live cuts. The regular CD itself featured 14 tracks culled from various singles and albums, plus one bonus, exclusive new track (an outtake from their 2012 album &quot;A Light Far Out&quot;) entitled &quot;Clouds Disco&quot;.

This exclusive CD track was then later issued as a 7&quot; vinyl single to mark 2015&#x27;s Record Store Day.

In late 2015 both Sarah Records albums by The Wake were reissued as remastered CDs, now expanded to include all tracks from the singles Crush the Flowers and Major John.

<doc id="1042690" wikidata="Q29207" url="?curid=1042690" title="Sauli Niinistö">
<text>Sauli Väinämö Niinistö (, born 24 August 1948) is a Finnish politician who served as the 12th president of Finland from 2012 to 2024.

A lawyer by education, Niinistö was Chairman of the National Coalition Party (NCP) from 1994 to 2001, Minister of Justice from 1995 to 1996, Minister of Finance from 1996 to 2003, Deputy Prime Minister from 1995 to 2001 and the NCP candidate in the 2006 presidential election. He served as the Speaker of the Parliament of Finland from 2007 to 2011 and has been the honorary president of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) since 2002.

Niinistö was the NCP candidate in the 2012 presidential election, defeating Pekka Haavisto of the Green League (VIHR) with 62.6% of the vote in the decisive second round. Niinistö assumed office on 1 March 2012; he is the first NCP president since Juho Kusti Paasikivi, who left office in 1956. In May 2017, Niinistö announced that he would seek reelection in the 2018 presidential election, running as an Independent candidate. The NCP and Christian Democrats (KD) supported his candidacy. He won reelection in the first round on 28 January 2018 with 62.7% of the vote and his second term began on 1 February 2018.

== Early life and education ==
Niinistö was born in Salo in 1948. His parents were the circulation manager of &quot;Salon Seudun Sanomat&quot; Väinö Niinistö (1911–1991) and nurse Hilkka Niinistö, née Heimo (1916–2014). Niinistö&#x27;s godfather was , founder of Salora.

Niinistö graduated from the &quot;Salon normaalilyseo&quot; high school in 1967, after which he went to study at the University of Turku. From there he graduated with a Master of Laws degree in 1974. He completed court training in 1977.

== Career ==

Niinistö ran his own law firm in Salo between 1978 and 1988 before entering national politics.

Niinistö served on the municipal council of Salo from 1977 to 1992 and was elected a Member of the Parliament of Finland from the district of Finland Proper in 1987. In 1994 he was chosen to lead the NCP as party chairman and subsequently became Justice Minister in Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen&#x27;s first cabinet in 1995.

Switching portfolios, Niinistö became Finance Minister in 1996, continuing in Lipponen&#x27;s second cabinet from 1999 to 2003. In both administrations, Niinistö was deputy prime minister under social democrat Lipponen. As Finance Minister, Niinistö was known for his strict fiscal policy. He was the first Finn to make a purchase with euros on 1 January 2002. Niinistö was urged by his party to stand as a candidate in the 2000 presidential election, but he refused the candidacy for completely related to his private life reasons. He announced his gradual retirement from politics in 2001, and he was succeeded that year by Ville Itälä as party leader. After the end of his term as a cabinet minister in 2003, Niinistö became vice president at the European Investment Bank.
In March 2005, Niinistö announced his candidacy for the 2006 presidential election. He represented the NCP, challenging the incumbent President Tarja Halonen. He qualified for the second round runoff (as one of the top two candidates in the first round), held on 29 January 2006, but lost to Halonen. The costs of Niinistö&#x27;s campaign were circa 2,225,000 euros, including 492,864 euros and 717,191 euros contributions from NCP. His financial declaration in 2006 was made more detailed in 2009 because of controversies.

In 2006, Niinistö announced that he was standing again for the 2007 parliamentary election. He said, however, that he had no plans to take any high-ranking political job such as the prime ministership in the future. He received 60,563 votes in the 2007 elections, a record in a Finnish parliamentary election; it was about 21% more than the 1948 record of Hertta Kuusinen. After the 2007 election, Niinistö decided to accept the position of the Speaker of the Parliament. Niinistö negotiated the merger of the European Democrat Union (EDU) into the EPP in 2002 and became its Honorary President.

Niinistö was elected as the president of the Football Association of Finland on 8 November 2009, replacing Pekka Hämäläinen, but the three-year term was interrupted when Niinistö was elected president of the republic.

== Presidency (2012–2024) ==

Niinistö was the NCP candidate for a second time in the 2012 presidential election. With 37.0% of the vote, he won the election&#x27;s first round and faced off against Haavisto of the Green League in the decisive second round. He carried the second round with around 62.6% against Haavisto&#x27;s 37.4%. Niinistö&#x27;s margin of victory was larger than that of any previous directly elected president. He won a majority in 14 of 15 electoral districts. Niinistö&#x27;s election budget was circa 1.2 million euros.

After becoming the President, Niinistö pledged to establish a special task force aiming at preventing alienation among the country&#x27;s youth and expressed concern about the problems of sparsely populated rural areas. Niinistö stressed the significance of mutual understanding with the cabinet and Parliament. His acceptance speech thanked those who backed him in the campaign and those who disagreed with him. Niinistö said that the differing views expressed should be taken into consideration.

In May 2017, Niinistö announced that he would seek re-election in the 2018 presidential election, running as an independent candidate. His candidacy was soon supported by the National Coalition Party and Christian Democrats. In the election, Niinistö received 62.7% of the votes, becoming the first president in Finland to win the first round of an election by popular vote.

By 2022, Niinistö was estimated to have an approval rating of 92 percent, but rejected efforts by a grassroots movement to allow him to run for a third term.

=== Foreign policy ===

As President, Niinistö visited Russia and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2013 to promote bilateral trade (e.g. Shell, Cargotec, YIT). He discussed ice hockey and business, but not human rights issues or the selling of Russian military equipment to Syria and its transport through Finland. Niinistö&#x27;s contacts with the Russian leader have led him to be dubbed as the &quot;Putin whisperer&quot; by some commentators.

At the same time as the sanctions against Russia, mainly caused by the Russian invasion in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, Niinistö said that the focus should be on easing tensions and increasing understanding between Europe and Russia. He stated that Finland should serve as a broker between Russia and Europe. He also stated that &quot;Russia understands that the conflict in Ukraine has generated debate in Finland over this country&#x27;s own security policy. It&#x27;s important that President Putin understands Finland&#x27;s position on NATO membership in this debate. Finland accepts that Russia is working to find a solution to the acute conflict in Ukraine, but it needs to do more.&quot;

The foreign minister of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, used a statement of Niinistö in his arguments about future choices for the next Prime Minister of Finland, saying, &quot;&#x27;Does Northern Europe need this? How will Russia react?&#x27; President Niinistö asked these questions with the subtext. He knows that the answer is negative: nobody needs this&quot;; Lavrov added &quot;President Niinistö realizes that what happened in Ukraine is impossible in Finland.&quot;

In his 2015 New Year&#x27;s Speech, Niinistö stated: &quot;We condemned Russia&#x27;s illegal annexation of Crimea as soon as it happened and then condemned Russia&#x27;s actions in eastern Ukraine. We have done this in the EU context but have also made this clear in our direct contacts with Russia. We condemn any illegal occupations, illegal use of force or attempts to limit the sovereignty of independent nations. Such actions never achieve anything but danger and increased tension. While power may have once grown out of the barrel of a gun, these days it leads to nothing but chaos.&quot;

Niinistö met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on 26 October 2016 in Tehran, Iran. He also met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. They discussed closer economic cooperation, human rights in Iran, the situation in the Middle East and the threat of terrorism. Niinistö said: &quot;Iran was one of the first countries to recognise Finland&#x27;s independence, and now our countries will further deepen their cooperation.&quot;

In April 2017, Niinistö openly supported the One-China policy.

In 2018, Niinistö said during his re-election campaign that he would block arms sales to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, due to their involvement in the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen.

On 16 July 2018, Niinistö officially hosted U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Putin for the US-Russia Summit in Helsinki. Niinistö was involved 73rd United Nations General Assembly in New York on 25 September 2018. President Niinistö spoke about Russia and Baltic nations affairs at the UNGA 2018.Niinistö visited China on 13–14 January 2019 and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, they went through common issues between Finland-China to raise friendship and partnership. Xi Jinping and Niinistö jointly launched the 2019 China-Finland Year of Winter Sports.

In October 2019, Niinistö condemned Turkey&#x27;s military campaign in Kurdish–controlled areas of northern Syria. He said that two NATO member states are &quot;quite involved&quot; in Syria.

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine and accession of Finland to NATO ====

In an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in January 2022, Niinistö stated that he could not speak to Putin&#x27;s intentions regarding the frozen relations between Russia and the West, but cited what he described as Finnish &quot;wisdom&quot; on experiences in dealing with Moscow. &quot;Finns certainly learned the wisdom that a Cossack, that means a Russian soldier, takes all that is loose. You have to be very, very, clear, where the fixed line is.&quot; When he was asked to shed light on his thoughts about Putin after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, Niinistö replied: &quot;The masks have now been taken off, showing only the face of war.&quot;

On 4 March 2022, Niinistö visited Washington, D.C., to meet President Joe Biden and number of other US politicians and security personnel. The meetings were initiated by Niinistö&#x27;s office earlier the same week. In a press conference with Finnish media, Niinistö said that in the meeting the presidents discussed the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its impact on European and Finnish security. Furthermore, they agreed on deepening Finnish-US security co-operation and bilateral relations.

On 12 May 2022, ten weeks after the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Niinistö and prime minister Sanna Marin advocated in a joint statement for a &#x27;NATO membership without delay&#x27;. Niinistö also made his last call with Putin that month, telling him that Finland&#x27;s decision to join NATO was the Russian leader&#x27;s &quot;own doing.&quot;
On 19 May 2022, Niinistö made a statement regarding Finland&#x27;s NATO membership, stating that they are ready to address Turkey&#x27;s security concerns, are ready for dialogue, always take terrorism seriously and always condemn terrorism.
On 21 May 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told Niinistö that &quot;overlooking threatening terrorist organisations that pose a threat to a NATO member is not in the spirit of the alliance.&quot; On the same day, Niinistö, after a telephone conversation with Erdoğan, announced that they were ready for dialogue with Turkey regarding Finland&#x27;s membership in NATO and that they always condemned terrorism. On 1 June 2022, Niinistö stated in a statement regarding Finland&#x27;s NATO membership that Turkey could address its concerns about terrorism, that it was always open to dialogue and that they always condemned terrorism. On 8 June 2022, Niinistö said he was surprised by Turkey&#x27;s opposition to Finland&#x27;s NATO membership. During Niinistö&#x27;s presidency, neighbouring military cooperation ties between Finland and Sweden were further strengthened, culminating in joint, rather than separate, NATO accession bids initiated by both countries. Amid threats of a veto from the Turkish Government over Sweden&#x27;s accession, Niinistö stated that he was steadfastly committed to the application being joint and that it would mean that Finland would have to decline the invitation into NATO if Sweden&#x27;s membership application was vetoed. Finland and Sweden agreed to a deal with the Government of Turkey that would allow the countries to join NATO on 28 June 2022, in the wake of the veto threat. During Niinistö&#x27;s presidency, Finland became a member of NATO on 4 April 2023.

=== Pardons ===
As President of Finland, Niinistö held the power of pardoning for individual criminal sentences and related sanctions. In 2019 and 2020, he did not pardon anyone, and pardoned on average only three people per year. In comparison, his predecessor Tarja Halonen reached a figure of 20 pardons per year on average. Niinistö had explained that he was in good agreement with the policy of the Supreme Court of Finland, which had always processed the case first before the President saw it. Niinistö supported the abolition of the presidential pardon in his presidential campaigns, calling the institution an outdated &quot;royal tradition&quot;.

== Post-presidency (2024–present) ==
In March 2024, Niinistö was called upon to make and prepare a draft report for the EU on improving crisis resistance of European societies at the request of Ursula von der Leyen as President of the European Commission. The report was described to be a society-wide review of Europe&#x27;s crisis resilience, covering both conventional defense, new and emerging cybersecurity and hybrid threats as well as the impact of people&#x27;s mindsets on European societies&#x27; collective crisis resilience to several threats.

In 2025, Niinistö criticised European countries for failing to playing a central role in engaging Russia to end its war on Ukraine.

== Political positions ==
Niinistö opposes the president&#x27;s right to pardon prisoners and only pardoned one prisoner during his first year as president. He opposes same-sex marriage but thinks that same-sex couples should have the right to adoption and a common surname. He supports euthanasia under certain circumstances. In December 2017, Niinistö stated that Finland should not apply for NATO membership in the current circumstances. According to Niinistö, as a member of NATO, Finland would lose the opportunity to stay out of the crisis. However, Niinistö wondered that in the event of a crisis between Russia and the EU, Finland should consider membership very seriously.

== Personal life ==
Niinistö married Marja-Leena Alanko in 1974 and they had two sons. Marja-Leena was killed in a car crash in January 1995. Niinistö wrote about the time after the death of his first wife in his book &quot;Viiden vuoden yksinäisyys&quot; (translation: &quot;Five years of loneliness&quot;).

While a cabinet minister, Niinistö, as a widower, was romantically involved with MP Tanja Karpela, a former beauty queen and later Minister of Culture. Karpela&#x27;s Centre Party was in opposition and Niinistö was considered the second-most influential man in government. In 2003 Karpela and Niinistö announced their engagement, which was ended in 2004.

In 2005, Niinistö met Jenni Haukio, who at the time worked for the National Coalition Party and interviewed Niinistö for the &quot;Nykypäivä&quot; magazine. They later became romantically involved but kept the relationship secret from the public until the wedding on 3 January 2009. In October 2017, the couple announced that they were expecting a child, and they subsequently had a son, who was born in February 2018. In 2017 Niinistö and Haukio&#x27;s dog Lennu went viral across the world.

Niinistö is the uncle of Ville Niinistö, a Green League MP from Turku, former leader of the Green League and former Minister of the Environment. However, he is not related to ex-Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö, and their family names have different origins.

Niinistö is a survivor of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. He escaped the ensuing tsunami by climbing a utility pole with his son in Khao Lak, Thailand.

Niinistö is a devout Christian and member of the Lutheran Church.

Niinistö enjoys roller skating in his spare time, and in the winter he often plays ice hockey.

Beside his native language, Niinistö also speaks English and Swedish.

== In popular culture ==
*Niinistö was a guest in political satire TV series &quot;Hyvät herrat&quot;.
*Niinistö had a small role in the film &quot;&quot;.
*In 2000, Niinistö won 100,000 mk in the &quot;Haluatko miljonääriksi?&quot; game show. He donated the prize money to a charity against youth drug use.
*Niinistö appears as an animated character in the political satire TV series &quot;The Autocrats&quot;.

<text>Commerce Bancshares, Inc. is a regional bank holding company headquartered in Missouri, with principal offices in Kansas City and St. Louis. It is the corporate parent of Commerce Bank, which offers a diversified line of financial services, including business and personal banking, wealth management and investments through its affiliated companies.

Commerce operates more than 275 branch and ATM locations across Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Oklahoma and Colorado with operating subsidiaries involved in mortgage banking, credit-related insurance, venture capital and real estate activities.

As of September 30, 2024, Commerce Bank was the 63rd largest commercial bank in the United States, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank.

==History==
Commerce was founded by Francis Reid Long with $10,000 in capital in 1865, just as communities were rebuilding during post-Civil War Reconstruction. Originally known as the Kansas City Savings Association, it was acquired in 1881 by Dr. William Stone Woods and renamed the National Bank of Commerce, claiming at the time to be the largest bank west of Chicago. Harry Truman, the 33rd President of the United States, worked as a clerk and cashier at the bank in the early 1900s. When describing Dr. Woods, Truman once said, &quot;There are dozens of stories about his close accounting of the nickels and pennies, but if he chose to back a man, he stayed with him through thick and thin if that man had energy and character.&quot; Dr. Woods would go on to transform the Kansas City bank into a modern financial institution.

Truman&#x27;s housemate at the time was fellow Commerce employee Arthur Eisenhower, brother of future war hero and President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Arthur went on to work at Commerce for more than 50 years.

The bank became Commerce Bank in 1903 with William Thornton Kemper Sr. as its first president. Kemper set up one of his sons, James M. Kemper, at Commerce and his other son, Rufus Crosby Kemper Sr., at the competing City Center Bank, which later became UMB Financial Corporation. Members of the Kemper family still play a dominant role at both banks. They also are a major force in Missouri philanthropies, with their names attached to numerous buildings throughout the state, including Kemper Arena.

In 1928, Commerce opened the nation&#x27;s first 24-hour banking transit department, where checks or transit items drawn from out-of-town banks could be cleared and collected. The bank was an early adopter in other ways as well. In 1955, it installed the latest moving &quot;electric stairs&quot; in the Walnut Lobby of its Kansas City headquarters.

After World War II, Commerce Bank continued to play an important role in the Midwest&#x27;s growth. It funded business growth, working with H&amp;R Block, Sprint (originally called United Utilities), and Trans World Airlines, which had its main overhaul base at Kansas City International Airport. In 1954, the Commerce Trust Company allowed Walt Disney and his wife, Lillian, to take out a $60,000 loan against Disney&#x27;s life insurance policy to help fund the development of a new theme park Disney envisioned. Disneyland opened in California a year later, and by the end of its first year in operation, the park had already attracted 3.6 million guests.

From the 1960s to the 1990s, Commerce grew alongside the American economy, expanding throughout Missouri, Kansas, and Illinois. In 1968, Commerce became the first bank in Missouri to enter the credit card business. In 1969, Commerce helped Ewing Kauffman, owner of Marion Laboratories, buy the Kansas City Royals. Commerce remains the Royals&#x27; bank. After a young Johnny Morris opened a bait and tackle shop in the back of his father&#x27;s liquor store in Springfield, Missouri, Commerce provided the line of credit he needed in 1974 to open a second store in a chain known today throughout North America as Bass Pro Shops. When the financial crisis caused a recession in 2008, Commerce was the country&#x27;s sixth largest bank to decline financial assistance from the U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.

Appearing regularly on lists recognizing top banks, Commerce later added Colorado and Oklahoma to its banking footprint, with additional commercial offices throughout the Midwest and commercial payments services available in 48 states. In 2023, Commerce completed Commerce Bank Tower, a 15-story building adjacent to Commerce Bank&#x27;s office building at 8000 Forsyth Blvd. in St. Louis.

<doc id="1042706" wikidata="Q11223800" url="?curid=1042706" title="IBM 3790">
<text>The IBM 3790 Communications System was one of the first distributed computing platforms. The 3790 was developed by IBM&#x27;s Data Processing Division (DPD) and announced in 1974. It preceded the IBM 8100, announced in 1979.

It was designed to be installed in branch offices, stores, subsidiaries, etc., and to be connected to the central host mainframe, using IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA).

Although its successor&#x27;s role in distributed data processing was said to be &quot;a turning point in the general direction of worldwide computer development,&quot; the 3790 was described by Datamation in March 1979 as &quot;less than successful.&quot;

==System description==
IBM described it as &quot;a programmable, operator oriented terminal system.&quot;

==Components==
The 3790 supported 
* up to 16 IBM 3277 display stations
* an integrated floppy disk unit 
* an integrated 120 lines per minute (lpm) line printer
* up to three 3292 auxiliary control units
* up to four 3793 keyboard-printers
* a Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) communications interface
* A 1200 baud internal or external modem

The base unit of the 3790 was the IBM 3791 programmable control unit, which was offered as a choice of:
* the model 1, supporting 8.3MB of disk storage
* the model 2, with up to 26.9MB.

Attached to the 3791 were:
* The 3792 auxiliary control unit, which had options for attachment of 
:* up to two dial-in IBM 2741 communications terminals, 
:* up to four 3793 display stations, and a line printer.
:* The 3793 printer-keyboard (up to four).
:* The 3411 model 1, Magnetic tape unit and controller (added in 1977) and 
::* up to three 3410 tape units attached to the 3411 unit.

==Host software==
* Function Support Program.
* Subsystem Support Services.
* VTAM (with the host running DOS/VS, OS/VS1, or OS/VS2)
* User Application Support Program.

==Reception==
The 3790 failed to achieve the success IBM intended, due to several issues. It had a complex programming language, &quot;The 3790 Macro Assembler&quot;, and the customers found it difficult to deploy applications on it. The Macro Assembler ran only on an IBM mainframe and then the compiled and linked object was moved to the 3790 for testing.

The 3790 was designed as a departmental processor, but the requirement for an IBM mainframe development environment inhibited adoption in its target market of mid-size companies. The result was lackluster interest in the product. In addition the 3790 was priced higher than minicomputers of comparable processing power.

One of the products IBM released to help developers was &quot;Program Validation Services&quot; (PVS). With PVS, one could test a program in the mainframe environment using scripts. The scripts were cumbersome to create, and prone to errors. Since mainframe time was expensive and often difficult to obtain very few programmers used PVS for anything other than initial testing.

The manual for the Macro Assembler was bulky (about 4 inches thick) and difficult to use as a reference. Another programming issue was code design and size; the hardware architecture loaded code into memory on 2k segments, for optimal execution time it was critical to ensure that processing intensive loops did not cross the segment boundary and incur delays swapping segments in and out of memory.

IBM recognized the problems with the Macro Assembler and created an automated program generator named DMS. DMS later became Cross System Product (CSP) on the 8100. DMS was essentially a screen painter; it could do simple edits such as field range checking or numeric tests but more complex logic still had to be coded using the Macro Assembler.

==IBM 3730==
The IBM 3730 is a word-processing variant of the 3790, announced in the late 1970s. It used 3790 hardware but its software made it a dedicated shared-logic word-processing system which could support a dozen or more word-processing IBM 3732 terminals, which were derived from the IBM 3270 family of terminals. Defunct IBM 3777 terminals which had been returned by customers were re-engineered and equipped with a specialized word-processing keyboard, and shipped back to other customers as part of the 3730 word processing system. The 3730 could be connected using Systems Network Architecture to a central mainframe running IBM DISOSS which was a centralized document exchange software running on CICS.

He was a Liberal member of Parliament (MP) from 1988 to 2010 and was one of eleven candidates for the 2006 leadership contest, but dropped out of the race on August 14, 2006. He has been described in the media as a &quot;right-of-centre, business friendly Liberal&quot;.

He resigned his seat in the House of Commons of Canada and announced on September 3, 2010, that he would be a candidate for mayor of Vaughan. On October 25 he was elected mayor.

==Early life==
Born in Sulmona, Italy, he arrived in Canada in 1970 at the age of 10. As a youth, he attended Emery Collegiate and received a Bachelor of Arts from York University. He has two children, Jean-Paul and Victoria.

==Politics==
He first got involved in party politics by working as a staffer for Sergio Marchi, and would later participate in student politics at York University.

Initially elected in the 1988 election, he defeated the Progressive Conservative candidate by only 77 votes. Due to the closeness of the race, the results were voided by the courts, and a by-election was called for 1990.

Bevilacqua won the 1990 by-election in York North by over 7,000 votes, despite a strong effort by the New Democratic Party.

Bevilacqua represented the districts of York North (1988–1997), Vaughan—King—Aurora (1997–2004) and Vaughan (2004–2010). He is a former secretary of state (Science, Research and Development) and (International Financial Institutions). He is also a former parliamentary secretary to the minister of Labour (Human Resources Development) and to the Minister of Employment and Immigration (Human Resources Development). He was formerly a consultant.

He was the longtime chair of the Commons finance committee. While a fiscal conservative, Bevilacqua has supported same-sex marriage.

==2006 Liberal leadership bid==
On April 19, 2006, he declared his candidacy for the leadership of the Liberal Party, joining Martha Hall Findlay, Michael Ignatieff, and Stéphane Dion as official entrants into the leadership race. His supporters included MPs Gerry Byrne and Roy Cullen, former Cabinet minister Roy MacLaren and former party pollster Michael Marzolini. Bevilacqua also attracted the support of former Chrétien organizers Tennio Evangelista, Jeff Angel and Jeff Smith. His campaign for the Liberal Party leadership was not successful and he dropped out of the race on August 14, 2006 to support fellow Liberal Party leadership candidate Bob Rae.

==Mayor of Vaughan (2010 - 2022)==
Bevilacqua officially announced in early September 2010 that he was running in the 2010 Vaughan municipal election for the position of mayor. The announcement came shortly after his resignation as Member of Parliament for Vaughan.

He defeated controversial incumbent Linda Jackson, the former mayor who was still facing charges from election finance irregularities stemming from her 2006 mayoral victory.

Bevilacqua was re-elected mayor of Vaughan in 2014 and again in 2018, both times with greater than seventy percent of the vote.

On June 1, 2022 Bevilacqua announced he would not be seeking re-election in the 2022 election and subsequently endorsed Steven Del Duca to succeed him.

<doc id="1042717" wikidata="Q5969055" url="?curid=1042717" title="IBM System 9000">
<text>The System 9000 (S9000) is a family of microcomputers from IBM consisting of the System 9001, 9002, and 9003. The first member of the family, the System 9001 laboratory computer, was introduced in May 1982 as the IBM Instruments Computer System Model 9000. It was renamed to the System 9001 in 1984 when the System 9000 family name and the System 9002 multi-user general-purpose business computer was introduced. The last member of the family, the System 9003 industrial computer, was introduced in 1985. All members of the System 9000 family did not find much commercial success and the entire family was discontinued on 2 December 1986. The System 9000 was based around the Motorola 68000 microprocessor and the Motorola VERSAbus system bus. All members had the IBM CSOS real-time operating system (OS) stored on read-only memory; and the System 9002 could also run the multi-user Microsoft Xenix OS, which was suitable for business use and supported up to four users.

==Features==
There were three versions of the System 9000. The 9001 was the benchtop (lab) model, the 9002 was the desktop model without laboratory-specific features, and the 9003 was a manufacturing and process control version modified to be suitable for factory environments. The System 9002 and 9003 were based on the System 9001, which was based on around an 8MHz Motorola 68000, and the Motorola VERSAbus system bus (the System 9000 was one of the few that used the VERSAbus). Input/output ports included three RS-232C serial ports, an IEEE-488 instrument port, and a bidirectional 8-bit parallel port. For laboratory data acquisition, analog-to-digital converters that could be attached to its I/O ports were available. User input could be via a user-definable 10-key touch panel on the integrated CRT display, a 57-key user-definable keypad, or a 83-key Model F keyboard. The touch panel and keypad were designed for controlling experiments.

All System 9000 members had an IBM real-time operating system called CSOS (Computer System Operating System) on 128KB of read-only memory (ROM). This was a multi-tasking operating system that could be extended by loading components from disk. IBM also offered Microsoft Xenix on the System 9002, but this required at least 640KB of main memory and a VERSAbus card containing a memory management unit. The machines shipped with 128KB of main memory as standard, and up to 5MB could be added to the system using memory boards that plugged into the VERSAbus. Each board could contain up to 1MB, which were installed in 256KB increments.

==History==
The System 9000 was developed by IBM Instruments, Inc., an IBM subsidiary established in 1980 that focused on selling scientific and technical instruments as well as the computer equipment designed to control, log, or process these instruments. It was originally introduced as the IBM Instruments Computer System Model 9000 in May 1982. Its long name led to it being referred to as the &quot;Computer System 9000&quot;, &quot;CS-9000&quot;, &quot;CS/9000&quot;, or &quot;CS9000&quot;. Originally, the CS9000 was available for scientific instrument users, it was not offered to customers who wanted to use it for other purposes. The CS9000 was unsuccessful in this niche; the cheaper IBM Personal Computer was adequate for many instrumentation tasks, and IBM&#x27;s larger general-purpose computers were used for more demanding tasks.

In 1983 IBM began encouraging value-added resellers to sell the CS9000 as an alternative to large computers like DEC Professional and Honeywell Level 6. IBM formally repositioned the CS9000 on February 21, 1984 as a family of computers, renaming it to the &quot;System 9000&quot;, which consisted of the System 9001 and 9002. The 9001 was a renamed CS9000, which retained its focus on the instrumentation market, while the 9002 was a general-purpose business computer that ran the IBM CSOS or Microsoft Xenix operating systems and supported one to four users. The 9002 was unsuccessful in the business market, due to the lack of business application software support from software developers other than IBM. IBM finally introduced a new model, the System 9003, in April 1985 as a computer-aided manufacturing computer, but it was also unsuccessful. As a result, manufacturing of the System 9000 family was stopped in January 1986, and it remained in limited availability until it was discontinued on 2 December 1986. Reasons cited for the failure of the System 9000 were its poor performance and high price, which led to the IBM PC being used where price was of concern, and to other 32-bit microcomputers being used where performance mattered. IBM closed its Instrument division in January 1987, reassigning the approximately 150 employees that had worked for it to other positions.

==Reception==
Noting the obscurity of its 1982 release, &quot;BYTE&quot; in January 1983 called the System 9000 &quot;IBM&#x27;s &#x27;Secret&#x27; Computer&quot; and stated that it was &quot;in its quiet way, one of the most exciting new arrivals on today&#x27;s microcomputer scene&quot;. The magazine speculated that with some changes it would be &quot;a natural candidate for a business or general-purpose computer&quot;. A later review by a member of Brandeis University&#x27;s chemistry department criticized several aspects of the hardware and software, but praised the sophisticated BASIC and IBM&#x27;s customer service. The reviewer concluded that &quot;the CS-9000 is a very fast and powerful laboratory computer [that is] very affordable&quot;.

==IBM 9000==
At least some ads by dealers in 1983 referred to &quot;The IBM 9000: Multi-User Micro,&quot; although the name &quot;IBM Computer System 9000&quot; was also advertised.

IBM also sometimes referred to the System 9000 as &quot;IBM 9000&quot; in their own marketing, at least when referring to their C compiler for the system.

<doc id="1042720" wikidata="Q270309" url="?curid=1042720" title="Universal Media Disc">
<text>The Universal Media Disc (UMD) is a discontinued optical disc medium developed by Sony for use on its PlayStation Portable handheld gaming and multimedia platform. It can hold up to 1.8 gigabytes of data and is capable of storing video games, feature-length films, and music. UMD is the trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment for their optical disk cartridge (ODC).

==Video storage format==
While the primary application for UMD discs is as a storage medium for PSP games, the format is also used for the storage of motion pictures and, to a lesser degree, television shows for playback on the PSP. The video is encoded in the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC format, with the audio in ATRAC3plus or PCM. Video stored on UMD is typically encoded in 720×480 resolution, but is scaled down when displayed on the PSP. To date, there are around 1,500 films released on UMD (around 1,000 are common for all regions and around 500 are region exclusives).
The American punk rock band The Offspring released their &quot;Complete Music Video Collection&quot; on the format. The BBC released a number of its programmes on UMD in the UK, including &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Little Britain&quot;. WWE also released some wrestler highlights and documentary content on UMD format, such as the &quot;Monday Night War&quot;, &quot;Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts: Pick Your Poison&quot;, and &quot;WWE Raw Homecoming&quot; (a special episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; celebrating the return to USA Network); the only WWE pay-per-view released on UMD format was WrestleMania XXIV.

Tupac&#x27;s performance, &quot;Live at the House of Blues&quot;, was also released on the UMD, which also included several music videos, including &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up&quot;.

Some adult films have been released on UMD in Japan. Sony reportedly took offence at adult film studios publishing pornography on the medium, but claimed that they were unable to restrict films on UMD like with games and other software for the PSP.

==Specifications==
ECMA-365: Data Interchange on 60 mm Read-Only ODC – Capacity: 1.8 GB (UMD)
* Dimensions: approx. 64 mm (diameter) × 4.2 mm (thickness)
* Maximum capacity: 1.80 GB (dual layer), 900 MB (single-layer)
* Laser wavelength: 660 nm (red laser)
* Numerical aperture: 0.64
* Track pitch: 0.70 μm
* Minimum pit length: 0.1384 μm
* Modulation: 8-to-16 RLL(2,10)
* Encryption: AES 128-bit

The case dimensions for UMD discs are 177×104×14mm.

===Provisions===
According to the official ECMA specification Sony designed the UMD to support two possible future enhancements and products.

#Protective Shutter: Similar to the MiniDisc and 3-inch floppy disk, this protective shutter would shield the inner disc from accidental contact.
#Auto-Loading: UMDs were designed for possible future slot loading devices with Auto-Loading mechanisms. These would be very similar to the auto-loading mechanism used in slot loading MiniDisc home and car decks. It would also be similar to the Sony U-Matic auto-loading mechanism. Unlike the current clamshell loading design the PSP uses, a slot loading device using an Auto-Loading mechanism would be motorized and completely automatic. The user would insert the disc into the device slot, the motorized mechanism would then take over and draw the disc inside the drive completing the loading process. The disc would also be ejected fully automatically by the motorized mechanism, like a VCR. This would also mean that power would be required in order to insert or eject a disc.

=== Region coding ===
DVD region coding has been applied to most UMD movies and music. However, all PSP games are region-free, although some require pay-to-continue.

*Region ALL: Worldwide (region-free)
*Region 1: North America, Central America, Latin America
*Region 2: Europe (without Russia or Belarus), Japan, Middle East, South Africa, Greenland
*Region 3: Southeast Asia, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong
*Region 4: Oceania, South America
*Region 5: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, India, Pakistan, Africa (without Egypt or South Africa), North Korea, Mongolia
*Region 6: China

==Availability and support==
UMD offers large capacity and the capability to store quality audio/video content; however, the format&#x27;s proprietary nature, the lack of writers and accompanying blank media, made adoption difficult. The UMD format never saw implementation on any device other than the PlayStation Portable, and as a result the market was very limited compared to those of other optical media formats. The high price of UMD movie releases were another contributing factor: they often retailed at comparable prices to DVD, but lacked extra content. Poor sales of UMD movies early in the format&#x27;s life caused major studios like Universal and Paramount to rescind their support. Retail support of the format experienced similar troubles, and in 2006, Wal-Mart began phasing out shelf space devoted to UMD movies.

In late 2009, Sony began pushing developers away from the UMD format and towards digital distribution on the PlayStation Network in preparation for the launch of the digital-download-only PSP Go, which was the first (and only) PSP model to not include a UMD drive. However, the system experienced lackluster sales compared to previous models, with most consumers still choosing the UMD-compatible PSP-3000 model, which continued to be sold alongside the PSP Go. Despite the earlier push for PlayStation Network releases around the PSP Go&#x27;s launch, over half of the PSP&#x27;s library was only made available in UMD format including &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;. There have been a few PlayStation Network exclusive releases since the PSP Go&#x27;s launch, such as &quot;LocoRoco Midnight Carnival&quot;. Still, most new games continued to be distributed via UMD, and, aside from those published by SCE, not all have been released on PlayStation Network.

The successor of the PlayStation Portable, the PlayStation Vita, did not include UMD support, nor was it added throughout its lifespan. In move similar to the PSP Go, Sony focused on digital downloads and opted for low-profile flash-based cartridges as the system&#x27;s main media format. UMD releases of films ended in 2011. Games were published on UMD up until 2013. Production of UMDs ended when the last Japanese factory producing them closed in late 2016.

UMD can be dumped into disc image files (.iso or .cso), using a modified PSP. This file can be loaded by a modified PSP through the Memory Stick, similar to titles that were distributed through the PlayStation Network.

<text>RACF [pronounced Rack-Eff], short for Resource Access Control Facility, is an IBM software product. It is a security system that provides access control and auditing functionality for the z/OS and z/VM operating systems. RACF was introduced in 1976. Originally called RACF it was renamed to z/OS Security Server (RACF), although most mainframe folks still refer to it as RACF.

Its main features are:
* Identification and verification of a user via user id and password check (authentication)
* Identification, classification and protection of system resources
* Maintenance of access rights to the protected resources (access control)
* Controlling the means of access to protected resources
* Logging of accesses to a protected system and protected resources (auditing)

RACF establishes security policies rather than just permission records. It can set permissions for file patterns—that is, set the permissions even for files that do not yet exist. Those permissions are then used for the file (or other object) created at a later time.

== Community ==
There is a long established technical support community for RACF based around a LISTSERV operated out of the University of Georgia. The list is called RACF-L which is described as &quot;RACF Discussion List&quot;. The email address of the listserv is RACF-L@LISTSERV.UGA.EDU and can also be viewed via a webportal at https://listserv.uga.edu/scripts/wa-UGA.exe .

== Books ==
The first text book published (first printing December 2007) aimed at giving security professionals an introduction to the concepts and conventions of how RACF is designed and administered was &quot;Mainframe Basics for Security Professionals: Getting Started with RACF&quot; by Ori Pomerantz, Barbara Vander Weele, Mark Nelson, and Tim Hahn.

== Evolution ==
RACF has continuously evolved to support such modern security features as digital certificates/public key infrastructure services, LDAP interfaces, and case sensitive IDs/passwords. The latter is a reluctant concession to promote interoperability with other systems, such as Unix and Linux. The underlying zSeries (now IBM Z) hardware works closely with RACF. For example, digital certificates are protected within tamper-proof cryptographic processors. Major mainframe subsystems, especially Db2, use RACF to provide multi-level security (MLS).

Its primary competitors have been ACF2 and TopSecret, both now produced by CA Technologies.

<text>Nehsi was an official at the court of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Hatshepsut. He appears to have been of Nubian descent–nehsi (nHs.j) meaning He of Nubia–and held a number of important official positions, such as Wearer of the Royal Seal and chief treasurer. He is depicted in the &quot;Punt Reliefs&quot; in the temple of Deir el-Bahri where he is described as having been responsible for dispatching Hatshepsut&#x27;s expedition to Punt. This has been interpreted by some as his having led the expedition from beginning to end.

The expeditionary force comprised five ships, each seventy feet long, accommodating 210 men including sailors and 30 rowers. Among the company were people who made records of the fauna, flora and the inhabitants of Punt, spiritual forebears of the Napoleonic scientists who wrote their &quot;Déscriptions&quot; of Egypt. Nehsi was buried in Saqqara, where he had a rock cut tomb.

<doc id="1042727" wikidata="Q5227352" url="?curid=1042727" title="Data set (IBM mainframe)">
<text>In the context of IBM mainframe computers in the S/360 line, a data set (IBM preferred) or dataset is a computer file having a record organization. Use of this term began with, e.g., DOS/360, OS/360, and is still used by their successors, including the current z/OS. Documentation for these systems historically preferred this term rather than &quot;file&quot;.

A data set is typically stored on a direct access storage device (DASD) or magnetic tape, however unit record devices, such as punch card readers, card punches, line printers and page printers can provide input/output (I/O) for a data set (file).

Data sets are not unstructured streams of bytes, but rather are organized in various logical record and block structures determined by the codice_1 (data set organization), codice_2 (record format), and other parameters. These parameters are specified at the time of the data set allocation (creation), for example with Job Control Language codice_3 statements. Within a running program they are stored in the Data Control Block (DCB) or Access Control Block (ACB), which are data structures used to access data sets using access methods.

Records in a data set may be fixed, variable, or “undefined” length.

==Data set organization==
For OS/360, the DCB&#x27;s codice_1 parameter specifies how the data set is organized. It may be
;CQ
:Queued Telecommunications Access Method (QTAM) in Message Control Program (MCP)
;CX
:Communications line group
;DA
:Basic Direct Access Method (BDAM)
;GS
:Graphics device for Graphics Access Method(GAM)
;IS
:Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM)
;MQ
:QTAM message queue in application
;PO
:Partitioned Organization
;PS
:Physical Sequential
among others.
Data sets on tape may only be codice_5. The choice of organization depends on how the data is to be accessed, and in particular, how it is to be updated.

Programmers utilize various access methods (such as QSAM or VSAM) in programs for reading and writing data sets. Access method depends on the given data set organization.

==Record format (RECFM)==
Regardless of organization, the physical structure of each record is essentially the same, and is uniform throughout the data set. This is specified in the DCB codice_2 parameter. codice_7 means that the records are of fixed length, specified via the codice_8 parameter. codice_9 specifies a variable-length record. V records when stored on media are prefixed by a Record Descriptor Word (RDW) containing the integer length of the record in bytes and flag bits. With codice_10 and codice_11, multiple logical records are grouped together into a single physical block on tape or DASD. FB and VB are codice_12, and codice_13, respectively. RECFM=U (undefined) is also variable length, but the length of the record is determined by the length of the block rather than by a control field.

The codice_14 parameter specifies the maximum length of the block. codice_15 could be also specified, meaning codice_16, meaning all the blocks except the last one were required to be in full codice_14 length. codice_18, or codice_19, means a logical record could be spanned across two or more blocks, with flags in the RDW indicating whether a record segment is continued into the next block and/or was continued from the previous one.

This mechanism eliminates the need for using any &quot;delimiter&quot; byte value to separate records. Thus data can be of any type, including binary integers, floating-point, or characters, without introducing a false end-of-record condition. The data set is an abstraction of a collection of records, in contrast to files as unstructured streams of bytes.

== Partitioned data set ==

A partitioned data set (PDS) 
is a data set containing multiple &quot;members&quot;, each of which holds a separate sub-data set, similar to a directory in other types of file systems. This type of data set is often used to hold &quot;load modules&quot; (old format bound executable programs), source program libraries (especially Assembler macro definitions), ISPF screen definitions, and Job Control Language. A PDS may be compared to a Zip file or COM Structured Storage.

A Partitioned Data Set can only be allocated on a single volume and have a maximum size of 65,535 tracks.

Besides members, a PDS contains also a directory. Each member can be accessed indirectly via the directory structure. Once a member is located, the data stored in that member are handled in the same manner as a PS (sequential) data set.

Whenever a member is deleted, the space it occupied is unusable for storing other data. Likewise, if a member is re-written, it is stored in a new spot at the back of the PDS and leaves wasted “dead” space in the middle. The only way to recover “dead” space is to perform file compression. Compression, which is done using the IEBCOPY utility, 
moves all members to the front of the data space and leaves free usable space at the back. (Note that in modern parlance, this kind of operation might be called defragmentation or garbage collection; data compression nowadays refers to a different, more complicated concept.) PDS files can only reside on DASD, not on magnetic tape, in order to use the directory structure to access individual members. Partitioned data sets are most often used for storing multiple job control language files, utility control statements, and executable modules.

An improvement of this scheme is a Partitioned Data Set Extended (PDSE or PDS/E, sometimes just &quot;libraries&quot;) introduced with DFSMSdfp for MVS/XA and MVS/ESA systems. A PDS/E library can store program objects or other types of members, but not both. BPAM cannot process a PDS/E containing program objects.

PDS/E structure is similar to PDS and is used to store the same types of data. However, PDS/E files have a better directory structure which does not require pre-allocation of directory blocks when the PDS/E is defined (and therefore does not run out of directory blocks if not enough were specified). Also, PDS/E automatically stores members in such a way that compression operation is not needed to reclaim &quot;dead&quot; space. PDS/E files can only reside on DASD in order to use the directory structure to access individual members.

== Generation Data Group ==
A Generation Data Group (&quot;GDG&quot;) is a group of non-VSAM data sets that are successive generations of historically-related data stored on an IBM mainframe (running OS or DOS/VSE).

A GDG is usually cataloged.

An individual member of the GDG collection is called a &quot;&quot;Generation Data Set&quot;.&quot; The latter may be identified by an absolute number, , or a relative number: (-1) for the previous generation, (0) for the current one, and (+1) the next generation.

===GDG JCL &amp; features===
Generation Data Groups are defined using either the BLDG statement of the IEHPROGM utility or the DEFINE GENERATIONGROUP statement of the newer IDCAMS utility, which allows setting various parameters.
* would limit the number of generations limit to 10.
* would retain each member, up to the limited#generations, at least 91 days.

IDCAMS can also delete (and optionally uncatalog) a GDG.

<text>Dorothy Veronica &quot;Dory&quot; Previn (née Langan; October 22, 1925 – February 14, 2012) was an American lyricist, singer-songwriter and poet.

During the late 1950s and 1960s, Previn was a lyricist on songs intended for motion pictures and, with her then husband, André Previn, received several Academy Award nominations. In the 1970s, after their divorce, she released six albums of original songs and an acclaimed live album. Previn&#x27;s lyrics from this period are characterized by their originality, irony and honesty in dealing with her troubled personal life as well as more generally about relationships, sexuality, religion and psychology. Until her death, she continued to work as a writer of song lyrics and prose.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Previn was born in either Rahway or Woodbridge, New Jersey, and grew up in Woodbridge, the eldest daughter in a strict Catholic family of Irish origin. She had a troubled relationship with her father, especially during childhood. He had served in the First World War and been gassed, and experienced periods of depression and violent mood swings. He tended to alternately embrace and reject her, but supported her when she began to show talent for singing and dancing. His mental health deteriorated after the birth of a second daughter, culminating in a paranoid episode in which he boarded the family up in their home and held them at gunpoint for several months. Previn&#x27;s childhood experiences, described in her autobiography &quot;Midnight Baby&quot;, had a profound effect on her later life and work.

After high school, Previn attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts for a year before financial difficulties forced her to leave. She toured as a chorus-line dancer and singer and started to write songs. She later wrote, &quot;I have been an actress, model, and chorus girl. I&#x27;ve worked at odd jobs—secretary, salesgirl, accounting in a filling station, waitress—anything to keep me going while I pursued my writing.&quot; At that time, she entered a brief first marriage that soon ended in divorce.

===Lyricist and marriage: 1958–1969===
Through a chance contact with film producer Arthur Freed, she gained a job as a lyricist at MGM. There she met, and began collaborating with, composer André Previn. In 1958, as Dory Langdon, she recorded an album of her songs, &quot;The Leprechauns Are Upon Me&quot;, with André Previn and jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell accompanying her, for Verve Records. She married Previn in 1959. The couple collaborated on a number of songs used in motion pictures, including &quot;The Faraway Part Of Town&quot;, sung by Judy Garland in the film &quot;Pepe&quot;, which was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song in 1960. In 1961 they wrote &quot;One, Two, Three Waltz&quot; for the movie &quot;One, Two, Three&quot;, and in 1962 &quot;A Second Chance&quot; for the movie &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot;, which won them a second Oscar nomination. They also wrote songs recorded by Rosemary Clooney, Chris Connor, Vic Damone, Bobby Darin, Sammy Davis Jr., Doris Day, Eileen Farrell, Jack Jones, Marilyn Maye, Carmen McRae, Matt Monro, Leontyne Price, Nancy Wilson, and Monica Zetterlund. In 1964, they collaborated with Harold Arlen on &quot;So Long, Big Time!&quot;, which was recorded by Tony Bennett. Later in 1966, the song was covered by Carola, accompanied by the Heikki Sarmanto Trio. During this period, Dory Previn wrote lyrics with other film composers for the movies &quot;Tall Story&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Again&quot; and &quot;Harper&quot;.

By the mid-1960s, André Previn had become a classical music conductor, touring worldwide, but Dory&#x27;s fear of air travel kept her from joining him. In 1965 she suffered a psychiatric breakdown for which she was briefly hospitalized, but continued to write songs with André, including &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Hear from Me&quot;, recorded by Frank Sinatra, and began to use the name Dory Previn professionally. In 1967, they wrote five songs for the movie &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;. The soundtrack album spent six months on the charts, and Dionne Warwick had a pop hit with her version of the theme song. In 1968, she wrote a new English language libretto for Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Impresario&quot;. The next year, she won a third Oscar nomination for &quot;Come Saturday Morning&quot;, with music by Fred Karlin, from the movie &quot;The Sterile Cuckoo&quot;. A hit version was recorded by The Sandpipers.

In 1968, André Previn had fully moved from composing film scores to conducting symphony orchestras, most notably the London Symphony Orchestra. While in London, he began an affair with 23-year-old actress Mia Farrow, who was working on the film &quot;A Dandy in Aspic&quot;. In 1969, Dory Previn discovered that Farrow had become pregnant by her husband, which led to their separation. Their divorce became final in July 1970. André Previn subsequently married Farrow. The betrayal led to Previn&#x27;s being hospitalized again, where she was treated with electroconvulsive therapy. This seemed to change her outlook as a songwriter, making her more introspective. She expressed her feelings about Farrow and the end of her marriage in the song &quot;Beware of Young Girls&quot; on her 1970 album &quot;On My Way to Where&quot;.

In a 1973 interview, Previn said: &quot;I&#x27;d been writing for films for several years, but nothing I could say in those theme songs had not been said better by many songwriters before me; and gloriously by poets. So what did I do? Did I want to go on and write more poetic lyrical metaphors on things already said? Or did I want to write about the one thing I can only presume to be an authority on: myself?&quot;

===Singer-songwriter: 1970–1980===
In 1970, Previn signed as a solo artist with the Mediarts company founded by Alan Livingston and Nik Venet, and recorded her first album for 12 years, &quot;On My Way to Where&quot;. Much of it, which like several subsequent albums was produced by Venet, deals with her experiences in the late 1960s. &quot;Mister Whisper&quot; examines episodes of psychosis from within the confines of a psychiatric hospital, while &quot;Beware of Young Girls&quot; is a scathing attack on Mia Farrow and her motives for befriending the Previns. The track &quot;With My Daddy in the Attic&quot; is a chilling piece dealing with Stockholm syndrome and incest. The album&#x27;s lyrics were published in book form in 1971.

Her second album of this period, &quot;Mythical Kings and Iguanas&quot;, released in 1971, was even more successful. United Artists Records then took over Mediarts and released her third album, &quot;Reflections in a Mud Puddle&quot;. It was voted one of the best albums of 1972 by &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, and was included in &quot;The New York Times&quot; critics&#x27; choice as one of the outstanding singer-songwriter albums of the 1970s. &quot;Taps, Tremors and Time-Steps: One Last Dance for my Father&quot;, the second side of &quot;Reflections In a Mud Puddle&quot;, is a personal account of the deterioration of their relationship and her anguish at their differences remaining unresolved at the time of her father&#x27;s death.

In 1972, she released &quot;Mary C. Brown and the Hollywood Sign&quot;, a thematic album about Hollywood misfits and Mary C. Brown, an actress who kills herself jumping from Hollywood&#x27;s letter &quot;H&quot;, apparently based on Peg Entwistle. The songs were intended for a musical revue that ran briefly in Los Angeles. Previn teamed up with producer Zev Buffman to stage it on Broadway, but the previews were poor and the show was canceled before it opened.

Previn&#x27;s albums maintained a balance of intensely personal lyrics and wider commentary. &quot;A Stone for Bessie Smith&quot; is about the premature death of singer Janis Joplin, while &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; examines the latent savagery of humanity. Self-conscious spirituality at the expense of the tangible is criticized in &quot;Mythical Kings and Iguanas&quot;, while songs dealing with emotionally frail characters include &quot;Lady With the Braid&quot;, &quot;Lemon-Haired Ladies&quot;, and &quot;The Altruist and the Needy Case&quot;. Feminist issues and dilemmas are explored in &quot;Brando&quot; and &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot;, while the male ego is attacked with wit and irony in &quot;Michael, Michael&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Put Him Down&quot;, and &quot;The Perfect Man&quot;.

In 1973, Previn&#x27;s screenplay &quot;Third Girl From The Left&quot; was filmed and broadcast as a TV movie. She also gave some public performances that year, including a concert in New York on April 18, 1973, that was recorded and released as a double LP, &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;, which featured in a book of the 200 best rock albums. She also continued to collaborate on music for film and TV. Her last film credit was the title song for &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; (1973), with music by Gato Barbieri.

She then switched to Warner Bros. Records, and released the album &quot;Dory Previn&quot; in 1974, followed by &quot;We&#x27;re Children of Coincidence and Harpo Marx&quot; in 1976. Still unable to overcome her fear of flying, she crossed the ocean on the QE2 to tour in Europe in the late 1970s, and in 1980 performed in a musical revue of her songs, &quot;Children Of Coincidence&quot;, in Dublin. She withdrew from music for a period, and wrote two autobiographies, &quot;Midnight Baby: an Autobiography&quot; (1976, ) and &quot;Bogtrotter: An Autobiography with Lyrics&quot; (1980; ). The latter title refers to her Irish heritage: &quot;bogtrotter&quot; is a derogatory term for an Irish person. She wrote &quot;Schizo-phren&quot;, a one-woman play with songs.

===Later life===
From the 1980s, she often used the name Dory Previn Shannon, Shannon being her mother&#x27;s maiden name. In 1983 she wrote and appeared in a musical statement on nuclear war, &quot;August 6, 1945&quot;, in Los Angeles. Working for television, she won an Emmy Award in 1984 for &quot;We&#x27;ll Win this World&quot; (from &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;) with Jim Pasquale, and an Emmy nomination in 1985 for &quot;Home Here&quot; (from &quot;Two Marriages&quot;) with Bruce Broughton.

In 1984, she married actor and artist Joby Baker. She performed in London in 1986, and wrote a stage work, &quot;The Flight of the Gooney Bird&quot;. She last appeared in concert in 1988, in Dublin and at the Donmar Warehouse in London. Her short stories appeared in several publications, and she also worked on a novel, &quot;Word-Play with an Invisible Relative&quot;. She lectured on lyric writing, recording, and writing autobiographies at various American universities. Baker provided illustrations for &quot;The Dory Previn Songbook&quot; (1995), which contains songs from her period with United Artists.

In 1997, she collaborated with André Previn again, to produce a piece for soprano and ensemble, &quot;The Magic Number&quot;. It was first performed by the New York Philharmonic, with Previn conducting and Sylvia McNair performing the soprano part. A piano reduction was published by G. Schirmer, Inc (). In 2002, Dory Previn released a royalty-free recording available online, &quot;Planet Blue&quot;. It contains a mixture of recent and previously unreleased material dealing with environmental degradation and the threat of nuclear disaster. She continued to work, despite having suffered several strokes that affected her eyesight. A new compilation of her early 1970s work, &quot;The Art of Dory Previn&quot;, was released by EMI on January 21, 2008.

===Death===
Previn died, aged 86, on February 14, 2012, at her farm in Southfield, Massachusetts, where she lived with her husband, Joby Baker. In addition to her husband, she was survived by three stepchildren, Michelle Wayland, Fredricka Baker and Scott Zimmerman, and six step-grandchildren.

<text>Air assault is the movement of ground-based military forces by vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, such as helicopters, to seize and hold key terrain that has not been fully secured, and to directly engage enemy forces behind enemy lines. In addition to regular infantry training, air-assault units usually receive training in rappelling, fast-roping techniques, and air transportation. Their equipment is sometimes designed or field-modified to allow better transportation and/or carrying within aircraft.

The United States Army field manual FM 1-02 (FM 101-5-1) describes an &quot;air assault operation&quot; as an operation in which assault forces (combat, combat support, and combat service support), using the firepower, mobility, and total integration of helicopter assets, maneuver on the battlefield under the control of the ground or air maneuver commander to engage and destroy enemy forces or to seize and hold key terrain usually behind enemy lines.

Due to the transport load restrictions of helicopters, air assault forces are usually light infantry, though some armored fighting vehicles, like the Russian BMD-1 are designed to fit most heavy lift helicopters, which enable assaulting forces to combine air mobility with a certain degree of ground mechanization. Invariably the assaulting troops are highly dependent on aerial fire support provided by the attack helicopters, armed helicopters, and/or fixed-wing aircraft escorting them. A concept called &quot;mounted vertical maneuver&quot; requires the ability to transport light, motorized, or medium-weight mechanized force by VTOL or super STOL aircraft.

Air assault should not be confused with &quot;air attack&quot;, &quot;air strike&quot;, or &quot;air raid&quot;, which all refer to attack using solely aircraft (for example bombing, strafing, etc.). Moreover, air assault should not be confused with an airborne assault, which occurs when paratroopers, and their weapons and supplies, are dropped by parachute from transport aircraft, often as part of a strategic offensive operation.

== Organization and employment ==

Air assault and air mobility are related concepts. However, air assault is distinctly a combat insertion rather than transportation to an area in the vicinity of combat.

Air assault units can vary in organization; using helicopters not only in transport but also as close air fire support, medical evacuation helicopters and resupply missions. Airmobile artillery is often assigned to air assault deployments. Units vary in size, but are typically company to
brigade sized units.

Airmobile units are designed and trained for air insertion and vertical envelopment (&quot;a maneuver in which troops, either air-dropped or air-landed, attack the rear and flanks of a force, in effect cutting off or encircling the force&quot;, air resupply, and if necessary air extraction.

One specific type of air assault unit is the US Army air cavalry. It differs from regular air assault units only in fulfilling a traditional cavalry reconnaissance and short raids role. Britain&#x27;s 16 Air Assault Brigade was formed in 1999 following an amalgamation of elements of 5th Infantry Brigade (5 Airborne Brigade) and 24 Airmobile Brigade, bringing together the agility and reach of airborne forces with the potency of the attack helicopter. Similarly, the US 101st Airborne Division was originally classed as airborne, then airmobile and now air assault.

== History ==
Air mobility has been a key concept in offensive operations since the 1930s. Initial approaches to air mobility focused on parachutists and the use of military gliders. During World War II many assaults were done by military gliders. The World War Two era German Fallschirmjäger, Brandenburgers, and the 22nd Air Landing Division glider borne paras laid the foundation for modern day air assault operations. In 1941 the U.S. Army quickly adopted this concept of offensive operations initially utilizing wooden gliders before the development of helicopters. Following the war, faster aircraft led to the abandonment of the flimsy wooden gliders with the then new helicopters taking their place. Four YR-4B helicopters saw limited service in the China Burma India theatre with the 1st Air Commando Group

In 1943 the Germans conducted the Gran Sasso raid which implemented many aspects of the air assault concept. Another example was the German Brandenburgers&#x27; glider borne operation at Ypenburg during World War Two.

In 1946, U.S. Marine General Roy S. Geiger observed the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll and instantly recognized that atomic bombs could render amphibious landings difficult because of the dense concentrations of troops, ships and material at beachheads. During this time, The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Alexander Vandegrift, convened a special board known as the Hogaboom Board. This board recommended that the USMC develop transport helicopters in order to allow a diffused attack on enemy shores. It also recommended that the USMC form an experimental helicopter squadron. HMX-1 was commissioned in 1947 with Sikorsky HO3S-1s. In 1948 the Marine Corps Schools came out with &quot;Amphibious Operations—Employment of Helicopters (Tentative)&quot;, or &quot;Phib-31&quot;, which was the first US manual for helicopter airmobile operations. The Marines used the term vertical envelopment instead of air mobility or air assault. HMX-1 performed its first vertical envelopment from the deck of an aircraft carrier in an exercise in 1949.

American forces later used helicopters for support and transport to great effect during the Korean War showing that the helicopter could be a versatile and powerful military tool.

=== First helicopter air assaults ===
The first helicopter airlift and helicopter sling load mission was conducted on September 13, 1951, during the Korean War. &quot;Operation Windmill I&quot; was conducted by the United States Marine Corps in support of a battalion clearing the enemy from a series of ridges around a basin called &quot;The Punchbowl.&quot; In total seven HRS-1 Marine helicopters made 28 flights that delivered 8,550 kg (18,848 pounds) of supplies and evacuated 74 seriously wounded men.

On November 5, 1956, the Royal Marines&#x27; 45 Commando performed the world&#x27;s first combat helicopter insertion with air assault during an amphibious landing as part of Operation Musketeer, in Suez, Egypt. 650 marines and 23 tons of equipment were flown in ten Westland Whirlwind Mark 2s of 845 Naval Air Squadron from the deck of HMS &quot;Theseus&quot;, and six each Whirlwinds and Bristol Sycamore HC.12s and HC.14s off ″s embarked Joint Experimental Helicopter Unit (JEHU) (Royal Air Force). The plan was to use the helicopters to drop No. 45 Commando at Raswa, to the south of Port Said, in order to secure two vital bridges. Last-minute concerns about their vulnerability to ground fire meant that they were replaced in this role by French paratroops who conducted a daring low-level drop on 5 November, securing one of the two bridges intact. Instead No. 45 Commando was landed the following day, disembarking close to the seafront in the aftermath of the seaborne landing that had secured the area. This first-ever operational use of helicopters to land troops during an amphibious assault proved successful. With their carriers lying nine miles offshore, the marines were landed far more quickly than could have been achieved using landing craft, and without the need to get their boots wet. However ... they landed the marines in much the same place that old style landing craft would have put them.

In 1956, the United States Marine Corps executed the first Division-strength exercise of vertical envelopment when the 1st Marine Division was helicopter-lifted from converted WWII jeep carriers to landing sites at Camp Pendleton, CA, U.S. Marine Corps Base. One of the ships utilized for this exercise was the USS &quot;Thetis Bay&quot;. This exercise was the culmination of the Marines&#x27; developing strategy of vertical envelopment rather than amphibious assaults on heavily defended beaches. The maneuvers were well-covered by the media of the time, including LIFE Magazine. The Marine Corps subsequently adopted this method as standard operating procedure after proving that helicopters could be used to transport very large numbers of troops and large amounts of supplies in a timely fashion.

Operation Deep Water was a 1957 NATO naval exercise held in the Mediterranean Sea that involved the first units of the United States Marine Corps to participate in a helicopter-borne vertical envelopment operation during an overseas deployment.

During the Vietnam war the U.S. Army&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division conducted the first large scale air assault operation in combat during the Battle of Ia Drang.

=== Algerian War ===
The use of armed helicopters coupled with helicopter transport during the Algerian War for the French Army to drop troops into enemy territory gave birth to the tactics of airmobile warfare that continues today.

The machines of the French Army Light Aviation carried out a considerable number of missions against Algerian insurgents between 1955, when the &quot;Groupe d’Hélicoptères&quot; No.2 (GH 2) was created, and 1962 when the French empire in Algeria finally came to an end. GH 2 was based at Sétif – Aïn Arnat in the east of the country, and it was equipped primarily with machines to undertake transport missions, though the Vertol H-21C, would soon join the unit owing to concerns about the lack of machines which could both defend themselves and carry out offensive missions against the insurgents. Acquiring these machines lay in the hands of the licensee Piasecki given France&#x27;s urgent need to have them on account of the circumstances. Usually, the H-21 could carry up to 18 troops, yet local operating (as well as climatic) conditions decreed that the French army examples could carry only up to around 12 troops each. In two years, GH 2 received the vast majority of the H-21s acquired by ALAT, which consisted of five squadrons by the end of 1958. A sixth squadron from the French naval air arm, the &quot;Aéronautique navale&quot;, had operated with GH 2 for little more than a year.

From 1955 to 1962, GH 2 took part in the major battles, which occurred near the frontier between Algeria and Tunisia, including the battle of Souk-Ahras in April 1958. The helicopters, including types such as the H-21, the Alouette II, the Sikorsky H-19 and Sikorsky H-34, together aggregated over 190,000 flying hours in Algeria (over 87,000 for the H-21 alone) and helped to evacuate over 20,000 French combatants from the combat area, including nearly 2,200 at night. By the time the war in Algeria had ended, eight officers and 23 non-commissioned officers from ALAT had died in the course of their duties.

=== Vietnam War ===

U.S. Army CH-21 helicopter transports arrived in South Vietnam on 11 December 1961. Air assault operations using Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troops began 12 days later in Operation Chopper. These were very successful at first but the Viet Cong (VC) began developing counter helicopter techniques, and at the Battle of Ap Bac in January 1963, 13 of 15 helicopters were hit and four shot down. The Army began adding machine guns and rockets to their smaller helicopters and developed the first purpose built gunship with the M-6E3 armament system.

U.S. Marine helicopter squadrons began four-month rotations through Vietnam as part of Operation SHUFLY on 15 April 1962. Six days later, they performed the first helicopter assault using U.S. Marine helicopters and ARVN troops. After April 1963, as losses began to mount, U.S. Army UH-1 Huey gunships escorted the Marine transports. The VC again used effective counter landing techniques and in Operation Sure Wind 202 on 27 April 1964, 17 of 21 helicopters were hit and three shot down.

The 2nd Battalion 3rd Marines made a night helicopter assault in the Elephant Valley south of Da Nang on 13 August 1965 shortly after Marine ground troops arrived in country. HMM-361 commanded by LtCol Tom Ross. On 17 August 1965 in Operation Starlite the 2nd Battalion 4th Marines landed in three helicopter landing zones (LZs) west of the 1st VC Regiment in the Van Tuong village complex, south of Chu Lai, while the 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines used seaborne landing craft on the beaches to the east. The transport helicopters were 24 UH-34s from HMM-361, HMM-261 and HMM-161 in relief, escorted by Marine and Army Hueys from VMO-2 and VMO-6 led by Maj Donald G. Radcliff, US Army who was killed in action. VC losses were 614 killed, Marine losses were 45 KIA and 203 WIA.

The need for a new type of unit became apparent to the Tactical Mobility Requirements Board (normally referred to as the Howze Board) of the U.S. Army in 1962. The Board met at a difficult time; the bulk of the military hierarchy were focused primarily on the Soviet threat to Western Europe, and perceived as requiring heavy, conventional units. The creation of new, light airmobile units could only occur at the expense of heavier units. At the same time, the incoming Kennedy administration was placing a much greater emphasis on the need to fight &#x27;small wars&#x27;, or counter-insurgencies, and was strongly supportive of officers such as General Howze who were embracing new technologies. The Board concluded that a new form of unit would be required, and commissioned tests – but justified these at the time on the need to fight a conventional war in Europe.

Initially a new experimental unit was formed at Fort Benning, Georgia, the 11th Air Assault Division on 11 February 1963, combining light infantry with integral helicopter transport and air support. Opinions vary as to the level of support for the concept within the Army; some have argued that the initial tests against the context of conventional warfare did not prove promising, and, despite opposition from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, it was primarily the Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara who pushed through the changes in 1965, drawing on support from within the Pentagon which had now begun to establish a counter-insurgency doctrine that would require just such a unit. Others have put more weight on the support of newly appointed senior Army commanders, including the new Chief of Staff General Wheeler, in driving through the changes. Nonetheless, the 11th Air Assault Division assets were merged with the co-located 2nd Infantry Division and reflagged as the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), continuing the tradition of the 1st Cavalry Division. Within several months it was sent to Vietnam and the concept of air mobility became bound up with the challenges of that campaign, especially its varied terrain – the jungles, mountains, and rivers which complicated ground movement.

The first unit of the new division to see major combat was the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, led by Lieutenant Colonel Harold G. Moore. The 7th Cavalry was the same regiment that Custer had commanded at the ill-fated Battle of the Little Bighorn. On November 14, 1965, Moore led his troops in the first large unit engagement of the Vietnam War, which took place near the Chu Pong massif near the Vietnam-Cambodia border. It is known today as the Battle of Ia Drang Valley, and is considered to be the first large scale helicopter air assault.

This battalion (vice &quot;squadron,&quot; which would have been its nomenclature had it actually been a cavalry organization) gave common currency, albeit incorrectly, to the U.S. term &quot;Air Cavalry.&quot; However, 1-7 Cav was in actuality an infantry formation carrying a &quot;Cavalry&quot; designation purely for purposes of lineage and heraldry. (True air cavalry organizations are/were helicopter-mounted reconnaissance units.) Light infantry-centric organizations (battalions, brigades, or divisions) that are trained, organized, and equipped to operate with organic (i.e., owned by the joint parent headquarters of both the light infantry organization and the supporting aviation organization) are classified as &quot;Air Assault,&quot; previously designated as &quot;Airmobile.&quot;

The Vietnam-era 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) was not an &quot;air cavalry&quot; division, per se, although it did contain air cavalry squadrons. The division was a new concept that probably was more akin to a modern version of &quot;mounted rifles,&quot; owing to its helicopter &quot;mounts,&quot; and, as did 1-7 Cav discussed above, carried the &quot;Cavalry&quot; designation primarily for purposes of lineage and heraldry, and not because of its then current mission or organizational structure.

On a practical level, virtually any light infantry formation can instantly become &quot;airmobile&quot; simply by dividing the assault elements into &quot;chalks&quot; (aircraft load designations pertaining to order of loading and type of aircraft), embarking them on the aircraft, transporting them to the objective/assembly area, and inserting/disembarking them into a landing zone, etc. However, true &quot;air assault&quot; organizations are specialized light infantry (much like airborne troops), who are trained, organized, and equipped specifically to perform the complex, rapid, and dynamic tasks inherent in air assault vice simply being transported by aircraft. Perhaps a rough comparison can be made between &quot;motorized&quot; and &quot;mechanized&quot; infantry. Any light infantry unit can be transported by truck (viz., &quot;motorized&quot;), however, &quot;mechanized&quot; infantry are specifically trained, organized, and equipped to conduct operations in close-coordination with tanks.

=== Southern African wars ===

The armed forces of Portugal, Rhodesia and South Africa widely conducted airmobile warfare operations in Southern Africa, during the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974), the Rhodesian Bush War (1964–1979) and the South African Border War (1966–1990). The airmobile warfare was part of the counter-insurgency actions made by the forces of the three countries against guerrilla forces in Angola, Portuguese Guinea, Rhodesia, Mozambique and South-West Africa.

The airmobile warfare tactics used by Portugal, Rhodesia and South Africa had many similar characteristics. The air forces of the three countries also used the same types of helicopters (mainly Alouette III and later, regarding Portugal and South Africa, SA 330 Puma), and there were military cooperation agreements and sharing of experience between the three powers, including the secret Alcora Exercise.

Portuguese, Rhodesian and South African airmobile tactics often involved air assaults done by small units of special forces or light infantry, transported in four or five Alouette III helicopters. Assaults were often supported by an Alouette III armed with a side-mounted 20 mm MG 151 autocannon. This helicopter was nicknamed &quot;Helicanhão&quot; (heli-cannon) by the Portuguese and &quot;K-Car&quot; by the Rhodesians. Variants of the air mobile warfare tactics used in Africa included the Rhodesian Fireforce and the Portuguese heliborne-horseborne forces cooperation.

=== Bangladesh Liberation War (1971) ===

Meghna Heli Bridge was an aerial operation of Indian and Bangladeshi allied forces during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. It took place on 9 December, when the Indian Air Force airlifted the Mukti Bahini and the IV Corps of the Indian Army from Brahmanbaria to Raipura in Narsingdi over the River Meghna, bypassing the destroyed Meghna Bridge and Pakistani defences in Ashuganj.

=== Post Cold War ===


In the United States Army, the air assault mission is the primary role of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). This unit is a division-sized helicopter-borne fighting force. 101st Airborne Division soldiers attend the Sabalauski Air Assault School. Graduates are qualified to insert and extract using fast rope and rappel means from a hover in addition to the ordinary walk on and off from an airlanded helicopter.

In addition, all U.S. Marine Corps divisions are capable of, and routinely train for and perform, air assault operations. Forward-deployed Marine Corps infantry battalions/regiments (reinforced, organized, and designated as Battalion Landing Teams/Regimental Combat Teams, or BLTs and RCTs, respectively), form the Ground Combat Element (GCE) of a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), or Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB). These MEUs and MEBs are capable of embarking aboard amphibious warships and include air assault as one of several means of conducting amphibious landing operations, supported by embarked Marine Corps tilt-rotor, helicopter, and STOVL fixed-wing strike aircraft.

The 10th Mountain Division Light Infantry has a limited capability to perform air assault operations. On September 19, 1994, the 1st Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division conducted the Army&#x27;s first air assault from an aircraft carrier, the , as part of Operation Uphold Democracy. This force consisted of 54 helicopters and almost 2,000 soldiers. This was the Army&#x27;s largest operation from an aircraft carrier since the Doolittle Raid of World War II

The 16th Air Assault Brigade of the British Army is the UK&#x27;s main air assault body. It comprises units of paratroopers from the Parachute Regiment and light infantry units trained in helicopter insertion, as well as light tanks and artillery.

Britain&#x27;s 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines are also highly experienced in air assault, both for boarding ships and in land attacks, see article above.

==== Russo-Ukrainian War ====

The Battle of Antonov Airport was an operation during the opening days of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine where the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) attempted an air assault in order to capture Hostomel Airport, in order to use the airport to airlift troops and heavy equipment directly into Kyiv. The VDV was initially able to capture the airport, but without artillery or armored support they were not able to handle a counter-attack started by local Ukrainian forces. The airport was captured only on the second day by a second air assault combined with an armored push from ground troops.

A simultaneous air assault was attempted at Vasylkiv, where VDV paratroopers attempted to seize the Vasylkiv Air Base but the attack was repelled.

<text>The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is a U.S. government agency that provides statistical information to guide actions and policies to improve the public health of the American people. It is a unit of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System. It is headquartered at University Town Center in Hyattsville, Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C.

== History ==
The Marine Hospital Service, predecessor of the Public Health Service (PHS), began collecting data on communicable diseases and performing surveillance of the incidence and distribution of diseases due to an 1878 act of Congress. In 1893, another law provided for weekly collection of data from state and municipal authorities.

The Division of Sanitary Reports and Statistics was established in 1899 as part of the initial establishment of internal divisions within the Marine Hospital Service. Separately, the Division of Public Health Methods was formed in 1937 within the National Institute of Health. In 1943, these two divisions were merged, retaining the name Division of Public Health Methods but being transferred into the Office of the Surgeon General. 

In 1946, the Division of Public Health Methods absorbed the Vital Statistics Division, which dated from 1903, from the Bureau of the Census in the Department of Commerce. The merged division was renamed the National Office of Vital Statistics. It was then transferred into the PHS Bureau of State Services in 1949.

In 1960, the National Office of Vital Statistics and the National Health Survey merged to form the National Center for Health Statistics. The National Health Survey had been created within PHS in 1956 through the National Health Survey Act (); it was the successor to a seminal national health survey performed by the Works Progress Administration during 1935–1936, which had multiple supplemental studies carried out in the intervening decades.

During the PHS reorganizations of 1966–1973, the National Center for Health Statistics was part of the Health Services and Mental Health Administration (HSMHA), and afterwards was part of the Health Resources Administration. Since 1987, it has been part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

== Data collection programs ==
NCHS collects data with surveys, from other agencies and U.S. states, from administrative sources, and from partnerships with private health partners. NCHS collects data from birth and death records, medical records, interview surveys, and through direct physical examinations and laboratory testing. These diverse sources give perspectives to help understand the U.S. population&#x27;s health, health outcomes, and influences on health.

There are four major data collection programs at NCHS:

===National Vital Statistics System===
The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) collects official vital statistics data based on the collection and registration of birth and death events at the state and local levels. NCHS works in partnership with the vital registration systems in each jurisdiction to produce critical information on such topics as teenage births and birth rates, prenatal care and birth weight, risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, infant mortality rates, leading causes of death, and life expectancy.

===National Health Interview Survey===
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) provides information on the health status of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population through confidential interviews conducted in households by Census Bureau interviewers. NHIS is the Nation&#x27;s largest in-person household health survey, providing data on health status, access to and use of health services, health insurance coverage, immunizations, risk factors, and health-related behaviors.

===National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey===
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is NCHS&#x27;s most in-depth and logistically complex survey, operating out of mobile examination centers that travel to randomly selected sites throughout the U.S. to assess the health and nutritional status of Americans. This survey combines personal interviews with standardized physical examinations, diagnostic procedures, and laboratory tests to obtain information about diagnosed and undiagnosed conditions; growth and development, including overweight and obesity; diet and nutrition; risk factors; and environmental exposures.

===National Health Care Surveys===
The National Health Care Surveys provide information about the organizations and providers that supply health care, the services they render, and the patients they serve. Provider sites surveyed include physician offices, community health centers, ambulatory surgery centers, hospital outpatient and emergency departments, inpatient hospital units, residential care facilities, nursing homes, home health care agencies, and hospice organizations. The National Health Care Surveys are used to study resource use, including staffing; quality of care, including patient safety; clinical management of specific conditions; disparities in the use and quality of care; and diffusion of health care technologies, including drugs, surgical procedures, and information technologies.

==Other data collection programs==
In addition to its major data collection programs, conducts targeted surveys and augments survey data where possible. NCHS conducts the National Survey of Family Growth to obtain information on factors affecting birth and pregnancy rates, adoptions, and maternal and infant health, and supplements the information obtained on birth certificates collected through the National Vital Statistics System. NCHS&#x27;s State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS) produces state-level data on such topics as the health of children with special needs, to meet the data needs of its colleagues in &#x27;s Maternal and Child Health Bureau and elsewhere. NCHS&#x27;s National Immunization Survey is conducted in collaboration with other offices in Atlanta. NCHS&#x27;s National Death Index creates a longitudinal component to other routine data systems. NCHS&#x27;s Questionnaire Design Research Laboratory develops and tests survey and data collection instruments for use by NCHS and other federal agencies and research organizations.

<text>IEFBR14 is an IBM mainframe utility program. It runs in all IBM mainframe environments derived from OS/360, including z/OS. It is a placeholder that returns the exit status zero, similar to the true command on UNIX-like systems.

== Purpose ==
=== Allocation (also called Initiation)===
On OS/360 and derived mainframe systems, most programs never specify files (usually called datasets) directly, but instead reference them indirectly through the Job Control Language (JCL) statements that invoke the programs. These data definition (or &quot;codice_1&quot;) statements can include a &quot;disposition&quot; (codice_2) parameter that indicates how the file is to be managed — whether a new file is to be created or an old one re-used; and whether the file should be deleted upon completion or retained; &quot;etc&quot;.

IEFBR14 was created because while codice_1 statements can create or delete files easily, they cannot do so without a program to be run due to a certain peculiarity of the Job Management system, which always requires that the Initiator actually execute a program, even if that program is effectively a null statement. The program used in the JCL does not actually need to use the files to cause their creation or deletion — the codice_4 specification does all the work. Thus a very simple do-nothing program was needed to fill that role.

IEFBR14 can thus be used to create or delete a data set using JCL.

===Deallocation (also called Termination)===
A secondary reason to run IEFBR14 was to unmount devices (usually tapes or disks) that had been left mounted from a previous job, perhaps because of an error in that job&#x27;s JCL or because the job ended in error. In either event, the system operators would often need to demount the devices, and a started task – codice_5 – was often provided for this purpose.

Simply entering the command
 S DEALLOC
at the system console would run the started task, which consisted of just one step. However, due to the design of Job Management, DEALLOC must actually exist in the system&#x27;s procedure library, SYS1.PROCLIB, lest the start command fail.

Also, all such started tasks &quot;must&quot; be a single jobstep as the &quot;Started Task Control&quot; (STC) module within the Job Management component of the operating system only accepts single-step jobs, and it fails all multi-step jobs, without exception.
 //STEP01 EXEC PGM=IEFBR14

=== Parsing and validation ===
At least on z/OS, branching off to execute another program would cause the calling program to be evaluated for syntax errors at that point.

== Naming ==
The &quot;IEF&quot; derives from a convention on mainframe computers that programs supplied by IBM were grouped together by function or creator and that each group shared a three-letter prefix. In OS/360, the first letter was almost always &quot;I&quot;, and the programs produced by the Job Management group (including IEFBR14) all used the prefix &quot;IEF&quot;. Other common prefixes included &quot;IEB&quot; for dataset utility programs, &quot;IEH&quot; for system utility programs, and &quot;IEW&quot; for program linkage and loading. Other major components were (and still are) &quot;IEA&quot; (Operating System Supervisor) and &quot;IEC&quot; (Input/Output Supervisor).

As explained below, &quot;BR 14&quot; was the essential function of the program, to simply return to the operating system. This portion of a program name was often mnemonic — for example, IEBUPDTE was the dataset utility (IEB) that applied updates (UPDTE) to source code files, and IEHINITT was the system utility (IEH) that initialized (INIT) magnetic tape labels (T).

As explained further in &quot;Usage&quot; below, the name &quot;BR14&quot; comes from the IBM assembler-language instruction &quot;Branch (to the address in) Register 14&quot;, which by convention is used to &quot;return from a subroutine&quot;. Most early users of OS/360 were familiar with IBM Assembler Language and would have recognized this at once.

== Usage ==
Example JCL would be :

//IEFBR14 JOB ACCT,&#x27;DELETE DATASET&#x27;,MSGCLASS=J,CLASS=A
//STEP0001 EXEC PGM=IEFBR14 
//DELDD DD DSN=xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz,
// DISP=(MOD,DELETE,DELETE),UNIT=DASD

To create a Partitioned Data Set:

//TZZZ84R JOB NOTIFY=&amp;SYSUID,MSGCLASS=X 
//STEP01 EXEC PGM=IEFBR14 
//DD1 DD DSN=TKOL084.DEMO,DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE), 
// DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=80,DSORG=PO), 
// SPACE=(TRK,(1,1,1),RLSE), 
// UNIT=SYSDA
== Implementation ==

IEFBR14 consisted initially of a single instruction a &quot;Branch to Register&quot; 14. The mnemonic used in the IBM Assembler was BR and hence the name: IEF BR 14. BR 14 is identically equivalent to BCR 15,14 (Branch Always [ mask = 15 = always ] to the address contained in general purpose register 14). BR is a pseudo instruction for BCR 15. The system assembler accepts many cases of such pseudo-instructions, as logical equivalents to the canonical System/360 instructions. The canonical instance of BR 14 is BCR 15,14.

The linkage convention for OS/360 and its descendants requires that a program be invoked with register 14 containing the address to return control to when complete, and register 15 containing the address at which the called program is loaded into memory; at completion, the program loads a return code in register 15, and then branches to the address contained in register 14. But, initially IEFBR14 was &quot;not&quot; coded with these characteristics in mind, as IEFBR14 was initially used as a dummy control section, one which simply returned to the caller, not as an executable module.

The original version of the program did not alter register 15 at all as its original application was as a placeholder in certain load modules which were generated during &quot;Sysgen&quot; (system generation), not as an executable program, per se. Since IEFBR14 was always invoked by the functional equivalent of the canonical BALR 14,15 instruction, the return code in register 15 was always non-zero. Later, a second instruction was to be added to clear the return code so that it would exit with a determinate status, namely zero. Initially, programmers were not using all properties of the Job Control Language, anyway, so an indeterminate return code was not a problem. However, subsequently programmers were indeed using these properties, so a determinate status became mandatory. This modification to IEFBR14 did not in any way impact its original use as a placeholder.

The machine code for the modified program is:

 SR R15,R15 put zero completion code into register 15
 BR R14 branch to the address in register 14 (which is actually an SVC 3 instruction in the Communications Vector Table)

The equivalent machine code, eliminating the BR for clarity, is:

 SR R15,R15 put zero completion code into register 15
 SVC 3 issue EXIT SVC to terminate the jobstep
This makes perfect sense as the OS/360 Initiator initially &quot;attaches&quot; the job-step task using the ATTACH macro-instruction (SVC 42), and &quot;unwinding&quot; the effect of this ATTACH macro (it being a Type 2 SVC instruction) &quot;must&quot; be a complementary instruction, namely an EXIT macro (necessarily a Type 1 SVC instruction, SVC 3).

<text>The North American YF-93 was an American fighter development of the F-86 Sabre that emerged as a radically different variant that received its own designation. Two were built and flown before the project was eventually canceled.

==Design and development==

In 1947, North American Aviation began a design study, NA-157, to create a true &quot;penetration fighter&quot; to meet the requirements of a long-range version of its F-86A Sabre. In order to accommodate more fuel, a much larger F-86A was envisioned, eventually able to carry , both internally and with two underwing drop tanks. The new variant possessed a theoretical unrefuelled range of over , twice that of the standard production F-86A. The resultant fighter originally designated the F-86C was intended to compete with the XF-88 Voodoo and Lockheed XF-90 to fulfill the USAF&#x27;s Penetration Fighter requirement for a bomber escort.

The F-86C was much larger and heavier, weighing in at more than its antecedent. The increased weight and girth necessitated a dual-wheel main landing gear, increased wing area and a more powerful engine, the Pratt &amp; Whitney J48 rated at static thrust and thrust available in afterburner. With the SCR-720 search radar and six 20 mm (.79 in) cannon mounted in the nose where the air intake was on the F-86A, the engineers designed a novel set of flush-mounted NACA inlets. 

In December 1947, the Air Force ordered two prototype NA-157s and, considering the many changes to the F-86, redesignated it YF-93A. Both prototypes were built with NACA inlet ducts; the first, (48-317), was later retro-fitted with more conventional intakes. Six months later, the initial contract was followed up with an order for 118 F-93A-NAs. In 1949, the production order was abruptly canceled as priorities had shifted dramatically following the testing of the ground-breaking Boeing B-47 which reputedly would not need an escort due to its high speed capabilities. With the prototype YF-93As just coming off the production line, the USAF took over the project.

==Operational history==
The prototypes, serial numbers 48-317 and -318, began flight tests in 1950 and were entered in a flyoff against the other penetration fighter projects, the XF-88 and XF-90; the XF-88 Voodoo was declared the winner. None of the projects would be ordered. The YF-93As were turned over to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) AMES facility for further testing before being utilized as chase aircraft until 1956. Flight with the NACA ducts proved troublesome at high angles of attack, restricting air flow to the engines.

<text>Shuma-Gorath () is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Steve Englehart and Frank Brunner, the character first appeared in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #10 (September 1973). Shuma-Gorath belongs to the Great Old Ones, a race of ancient eldritch beings who predate Earth. It is a recurring antagonist of the superhero Doctor Strange.

==Publication history==
Shuma-Gorath first appears as an adversary for Doctor Strange in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #10 (September 1973), created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Frank Brunner. The character&#x27;s name is taken from Robert E. Howard&#x27;s short story &quot;The Curse of the Golden Skull,&quot; which features a dying magician named Rotath invoking the &quot;iron-bound books of Shuma-Gorath&quot; in a curse against humanity.

Heroic Signatures holds the rights to the Shuma-Gorath name, due to its use in Howard&#x27;s story, along with additional elements related to the Conan the Barbarian and Kull of Atlantis mythos, which is licensed to Marvel Comics.

==Fictional character biography==
During Earth&#x27;s pre-history Shuma-Gorath ruled the world, and demanded human sacrifice until eventually banished by time-traveling sorcerer Sise-Neg. The entity eventually returns during the Hyborian Age, but is imprisoned within a mountain by the power of the god Crom. Shuma-Gorath continues to be an influence on Earth until it was returned to its home dimension by Crom.

When the entity tries to return to Earth via the mind of the Ancient One, his disciple Doctor Strange is forced to kill him to prevent this. Years later, Strange battles Shuma-Gorath in its home dimension, and although victorious, he gradually becomes a new version of the entity. Strange commits suicide to prevent this transformation and is resurrected by an ally. Sorcerer Nicholas Scratch summons the entity to Earth, but it is driven back by the combined efforts of Doctor Strange, the Fantastic Four, the Salem&#x27;s Seven and villain Diablo.

Shuma-Gorath is eventually revealed to be one of the four undying extra-dimensional &quot;multi-angled ones&quot; guiding a metaphysical invasion from a dimension called the &quot;cancerverse&quot;. In attempting to destroy Death itself, the entity and its allies are rendered inert by the conceptual form of Death and subsequently are trapped in the cancerverse when it is destroyed. Shuma-Gorath survives and once again attempts to invade Earth but is repelled by the Avengers with the Spear of Destiny.

During the 2011 &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Shuma-Gorath is among the demons who meet at the Devil&#x27;s Advocacy to discuss the threat of the Serpent.

During the 2013 &quot;Infinity&quot; storyline, Thanos&#x27; servant Ebony Maw manipulates Doctor Strange into summoning Shuma-Gorath to New York. The creature is met by Luke Cage and his new team of Avengers. Blue Marvel arrives at the scene of the battle and flies through Shuma-Gorath&#x27;s head, destroying its physical manifestation. Shuma-Gorath&#x27;s astral body possesses a crowd of people in New York City and attempts to recreate itself on Earth. It is weakened through mystical attacks by Power Man and White Tiger and finally banished by Monica Rambeau, who penetrates Shuma-Gorath&#x27;s eye with a ray of light and disperses the entity from within.

The &quot;Last Days of Magic&quot; storyline describes Shuma-Gorath as responsible for destroying the home planet of the Imperator, leader of the Empirikul, by sending a group of evil sorcerers after his family. This leads the Imperator to dedicate his life to destroying magic in every universe.

Later, during a battle, Dormammu states to Doctor Strange that he helped the Empirikul in finding Shuma-Gorath, who was defeated by the Imperator. Strange later banishes Dormammu to Shuma-Gorath itself, who was visibly wounded and seeking revenge.

==Powers and abilities==
Shuma-Gorath is a godlike ruler of nearly a hundred alternate universes. The character has the power to destroy galaxies and realities. The entity is described as immortal. Shuma-Gorath is able to manipulate reality. It can communicate with and control life forms across dimensions. It can shoot powerful energy blasts from its eye or tentacles. The entity is capable of teleportation. It also possesses the ability to shape-shift. Shuma-Gorath can also levitate.

<doc id="1042746" wikidata="Q976974" url="?curid=1042746" title="Peter Cosgrove">
<text>General Sir Peter John Cosgrove, (born 28 July 1947) is an Australian retired senior Army officer who served as the 26th governor-general of Australia, in office from 2014 to 2019.

A graduate of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Cosgrove fought in the Vietnam War, receiving the Military Cross in 1971. From 1983 to 1984, he was commander of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and he later served as commander of the 6th Brigade and the 1st Division. Cosgrove rose to prominence in 1999, when he served as commander of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), which oversaw the peacekeeping mission in East Timor during its transition to independence. He is also an alumnus of National Defence College, India.

Cosgrove was Australia&#x27;s Chief of Army from 2000 to 2002 and Chief of the Defence Force from 2002 to 2005, receiving corresponding promotions to lieutenant general and general. Cosgrove retired from active service following the end of his term as Chief of the Defence Force, and subsequently served as leader of a taskforce helping to rebuild communities in Queensland after Cyclone Larry in 2006. In January 2014, Cosgrove was named to succeed Dame Quentin Bryce as Governor-General of Australia. He was sworn in on 28 March 2014 and made a Knight of the Order of Australia on the same date. Cosgrove retired on 1 July 2019 and was succeeded by General David Hurley.

== Early life and education ==

Cosgrove was born in Sydney, New South Wales, on 28 July 1947. He was educated at Waverley College in Sydney, then followed his father, a warrant officer, into the Australian Army by attending the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1965. Cosgrove&#x27;s uncle, Bill Cosgrove, was a professional Australian rules football player, but was killed in action while serving with the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II. Cosgrove class of 1964 spent time in Waverley College&#x27;s Cadet Unit, as a cadet he was Adjutant CUO P. Cosgrove and tied for the Major General JA Chapman Cane for the most efficient cadet in the Unit. Years later the cadet unit has named an award after Cosgrove, the General Cosgrove Shield (for the most efficient Speciality in the Cadet Unit) each year to honour the achievements of the most senior ranking officer to graduate.

== Military service ==

Cosgrove was appointed a probationary second lieutenant in August 1968 while attached to a regular army unit, and was commissioned a lieutenant on 11 December 1968. He was allotted to the Royal Australian Infantry. He arrived in South Vietnam on 3 August 1969 and was posted to 9th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment on 20 August 1969. On 10 October 1969, Lieutenant Cosgrove was commanding 5 Platoon, B Company. The platoon located an occupied bunker system in an area where, because of the proximity of allied troops, indirect fire support was difficult to obtain. In spite of this, he led his platoon in an assault on the bunkers without indirect fire support, capturing the system and killing and wounding at least four enemy without sustaining any casualties. On 16 October 1969, 5 Platoon located another bunker system occupied by about a platoon of enemy. Lieutenant Cosgrove silently deployed his own platoon for an attack. His assault completely surprised the enemy causing them to flee, abandoning large quantities of food, stores and documents. The following day in the same bunker system a party of enemy approached his right forward section and was engaged by the sentry. Knowing that the remainder of the section was elsewhere on other tasks, Lieutenant Cosgrove ran to the contact area and personally conducted the fight against the enemy. As a result of his actions, two enemy were killed and three weapons and four packs containing rice were captured. He was awarded the Military Cross for these actions.

Cosgrove was promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 21 September 1970, and was appointed an aide-de-camp to the then-Governor-General Paul Hasluck on 20 December 1971. He was promoted to substantive captain on 31 October 1974 (seniority from 13 July), to temporary major on 2 January 1976 and to substantive major on 11 December 1978. In 1980 he was awarded the National Medal, and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 7 December 1981. In the mid-1980s he commanded the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment.

Cosgrove came to national fame in 1999 when, as a major general, he led the international forces (INTERFET) in a peacekeeping mission to East Timor. The mission&#x27;s success made him one of Australia&#x27;s most respected and popular military leaders. He returned to Australia in 2000 as Land Commander Australia, was promoted to lieutenant general in July and appointed Chief of the Army and, in 2002, was advanced to general as Chief of the Defence Force.

In 2004, the Foreign Minister Alexander Downer queried the judgement of Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty. Following a joint interview with the then Defence Minister Robert Hill, Cosgrove was accused of &quot;playing politics&quot; when he said that, on this occasion, he disagreed with Keelty&#x27;s point of view. However, Cosgrove expressed strong support for the Police Commissioner in his Australian best selling autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;, published in 2006. On 3 July 2005, Cosgrove&#x27;s three-year appointment as Chief of the Defence Force was completed, and he was succeeded by then-Chief of Air Force Air Marshal Angus Houston.

== Post-military career ==
=== Cyclone Larry Taskforce ===
On 23 March 2006, Cosgrove was selected to lead the Queensland Government taskforce of rebuilding communities damaged by Cyclone Larry, a Category 5 tropical cyclone that devastated the Innisfail region of northern Queensland.
&quot;In recognition of the important contribution General Cosgrove made to the community of North Queensland following Cyclone Larry&quot;, on 11 October 2008, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh announced that a new residential suburb in the Bohle Plains area of Townsville would be named Cosgrove, formerly the site of an Abattoir for the cattle sale yards next to it.

=== Corporate leadership and community organisations ===
Cosgrove served on the board of Australia&#x27;s main airline Qantas between July 2005 and January 2014 and is on numerous other boards as chairman or member. He served as Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University between November 2010 and January 2014; and is Honorary Patron of the ACT Veterans Rugby Club and the Rosies Youth Mission.
Peter Cosgrove was appointed as Patron to the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard Association in 2015.

== Governor-General ==

On 28 January 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that Queen Elizabeth II had accepted his advice to appoint General Peter Cosgrove as the next Governor-General of Australia, to succeed Dame Quentin Bryce in late March. On 25 March, Abbott announced that the Queen had also approved the reinstatement of the grade of Knight or Dame in the Order of Australia (she had abolished it in 1986 on the advice of Bob Hawke), and that governors-general would be &quot;ex officio&quot; the Principal Knight or Dame of the Order. The incumbent, Quentin Bryce, was immediately made the first new Dame of the Order. On 28 March, Cosgrove succeeded Dame Quentin and was sworn in as Governor-General by Chief Justice Robert French, becoming Sir Peter Cosgrove. Former headmaster of Waverley College, Ray Paxton, states &quot;In choosing Sir Peter Cosgrove for Governor General, Australia has honoured a remarkable man&quot;. During his time as Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove was a supporter for the Lung Foundation Australia.
On 16 December 2018, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that The Queen had approved the appointment of retired General David Hurley, the current Governor of New South Wales, as the next Governor-General of Australia, commencing in July 2019, and that Cosgrove&#x27;s term would be extended until that time to ensure smooth transitions following the New South Wales election in March and federal election expected in May 2019.

On 12 August 2019, during a post appointment call upon the Queen, Cosgrove was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.

During the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla, with the Governor-General of Australia and all of the state governors in London, Cosgrove served as the Administrator of the Commonwealth from 30 April to 10 May 2023.

== Personal life ==

Cosgrove married Lynne Payne in 1976; they have three sons and four grandchildren. Cosgrove is a Roman Catholic and frequently attends Mass in St Christopher&#x27;s Cathedral, Canberra.

Cosgrove is a strong supporter and member of the Sydney Roosters. He is also a keen follower of cricket and rugby union.

<doc id="1042749" wikidata="Q3154557" url="?curid=1042749" title="Iroquois Falls">
<text>Iroquois Falls is a town in Northern Ontario, Canada, with a population of 4,537 at the 2016 census.

The town centre lies 11 km east of Hwy 11 on the banks of the Abitibi River, west of Lake Abitibi. Timmins, one of the largest cities in northern Ontario, is approximately to the southwest. The following communities are also within the municipal boundaries: Monteith, Nellie Lake, and Porquis Junction.

Iroquois Falls&#x27; primary industry was a large mill producing newsprint and commercial printing papers. In December 2014, the owner, Resolute Forest Products, announced its permanent closure. There are also three hydro-electric dams nearby. The Monteith Correctional Complex, a provincial prison serving a regional catchment area, is located in the community of Monteith (named for Samuel Nelson Monteith).

==History==
The background of the town&#x27;s name varies depending on the source, attributing it to invasions by the Iroquois on Huron or Ojibway villages. It is also unclear who has relayed the tale, settlers or the First Nations people themselves.



Iroquois Falls was built as a company town by Frank Harris Anson, owner of the Abitibi Power and Paper Company. Anson had been influenced by the garden city movement of urban planning, and was committed to building an elaborate town. A Chicago architectural firm was hired to design the landscaping and houses, and work crews began clearing land in 1913. The town&#x27;s park and commercial developments were clearly separated from the paper mill, and the residential streets curved with a focus on the centre of the town. A large church was built, the first English Catholic Parish in Northern Ontario, and today remains a historic landmark. Anson&#x27;s company town had a hospital, a school, and a company hotel. Employee homes were designed with gambrel roofs to resemble New England farmhouses, and their design and location reflected the employee&#x27;s rank at the mill. Papermakers lived in double-adjoined homes, while senior managers lived on separate streets in single-family homes.

Much of the town was destroyed by fire in 1916, though Anson continued his beautification program during the 1920s as the community rebuilt.

The town&#x27;s avant-garde style earned it the nickname &quot;Anson&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

The town was incorporated in 1915, and a board of trade was chartered in 1926.

The paper mill created a dramatic change to the area, and people migrated to the community for work.

The creation of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (now Ontario Northland Railway) greatly boosted the economy as there were few roads at the time.

As Iroquois Falls grew, two new communities within the town began to emerge. An area known first as &quot;The Wye&quot; (because the rail tracks split at this point) grew to the south, and was at first a ramshackle collection of cabins and shacks. It later became known as Ansonville, and was home to a number of business people and others who were shut out from the company town. In contrast to Iroquois Falls, Ansonville had little town planning, and no water, sewer, or electrical service. Insurance companies would not insure homes there because the risk of fire was too great, and the first residents were French-Canadians, Russians and Ukrainians. Animosity was frequent between Ansonville and Iroquois Falls, and many residents of Iroquois Falls condemned Ansonville &quot;as a dark den of foreigners engaged in regular street brawls, illegal alcohol consumption, and other unsavoury activities&quot;

In 1921, Ansonville began to levy taxes, which led a group of residents to establish a third community named Victoria in the north-west section of the town. The name was later changed to Montrock.

In 1979, the three communities were amalgamated into one town named Iroquois Falls.

The paper mill, then called Abitibi-Price, merged with Stone-Consolidated, and then with Donohue Forest Products, and finally with Bowater to create Abitibi-Bowater. On 17 April 2009, Abitibi-Bowater sought bankruptcy protection, emerging from it as Resolute Forest Products.

A tragic event occurred in 1984 at the coffee shop at Joe&#x27;s Texaco in nearby Porquis Junction. Ontario Provincial Police constable Vern Miller was drinking coffee with his partner constable Norm Tiegen, when 23-year-old Gregg Prevost of Iroquois Falls entered and shot Miller with a shotgun, killing him instantly. The community was shocked and outraged, and Prevost was sentenced to life in prison. The town of Matheson renamed their local arena the Vern Miller Memorial Arena in his honour.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Iroquois Falls falls within the northern periphery of the humid continental climate (Dfb) despite extreme January and February record lows that exceed that of many subarctic regions. In January 1935, the town set the record low temperature for Ontario of , the town also happens to hold the unofficial February record low of . set in February 1899 (before the town was officially incorporated but weather was taken) and tied in February 1934 but it wasn&#x27;t recorded at the location used for official temperature readings. Winter typically lasts from the end of October to well into April.
== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Iroquois Falls had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Economy==

Resolute Forest Products announced the permanent closure of its mill in Iroquois Falls on 5 December 2014, eliminating 180 jobs. Mayor Michael Shea commented: &quot;it&#x27;s going to affect every village in Northern Ontario.&quot;

In 2015, the Town of Iroquois Falls entered into an agreement with Resolute Forest Products, and Riverside Developments, regarding redeveloping the former mill site into a multi-use industrial facility, commercial-industrial park, or possibly a greenhouse complex.

==Sports and recreation==

===Jus Jordan Arena===

The Jus Jordan Arena arena and curling rinks were completed in 1955. The arena was designed and construction supervised by then Abitibi Paper Company engineer Jus Jordan. entirely through the volunteer effort of townspeople.

<text>An oriel window is a form of bay window which protrudes from the main wall of a building but does not reach to the ground. Supported by corbels, brackets, or similar cantilevers, an oriel window generally projects from an upper floor, but is also sometimes used on the ground floor.

Oriel windows are seen in Arab architecture in the form of mashrabiya and in Turkish are known as &quot;şahnişin&quot; or &quot;cumba&quot;. In Islamic culture, these windows and balconies project from the street-front of a house, providing an area in which women could peer out and see the activities below whilst remaining safely out of line-of-sight.

== Origins ==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the term &quot;oriel&quot; is derived from Anglo-Norman &#x27; and Late Latin &#x27;, both meaning &quot;gallery&quot; or &quot;porch&quot;, perhaps from Classical Latin &quot;&quot; (&quot;curtain&quot;).

* Oriel College, Oxford, took its name from a balcony or oriel window forming a feature of a building which occupied the site the college now stands on.
* Oriel Chambers in Liverpool was a very controversial building when it was built, featuring an entire façade of glass oriel windows.

<doc id="1042759" wikidata="Q1016318" url="?curid=1042759" title="Burtonport">
<text>&#x27; or &#x27; (English name: Burtonport) is a fishing village about northwest of Dungloe in The Rosses district of County Donegal, Ireland. The main employers in the village were the Burtonport Fishermen&#x27;s Co-op and the &quot;Bord Iascaigh Mhara&quot; (BIM; Irish Sea Fisheries Board) ice plant; but these have both since closed and their former premises were demolished in 2021 as part of a seafront environment upgrade scheme.

==History==
Burtonport was developed by Marquess of Conyngham as a rival to another planned village on Rutland Island.

A plaque in the village commemorates the brief landing on the nearby Rutland Island of a French military force led by James Napper Tandy in a failed attempt to assist rebels during the 1798 rebellion on 16 September 1798. St Columba&#x27;s Church dates from 1899.

In 1974, a commune called Atlantis Primal Therapy Commune was established in Burtonport by Jenny James. The commune, which came to be known as &quot;The Screamers&quot; for its practice of primal therapy, moved to the island of Inishfree in 1980. From 1982 to 1992 Burtonport was the home of the Silver Sisterhood, a new religious movement. Members believed that God was a woman.

==Transport==

As the mainland port for both the Arranmore car ferry services, Burtonport receives some passing tourist traffic. Burtonport had a railway service from Letterkenny between 1903 and 1940 provided by the Letterkenny &amp; Burtonport Extension Railway (L&amp;BER), a company jointly owned by the State and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway (L&amp;LSR). Burtonport railway station opened on 9 March 1903, but finally closed on 3 June 1940. The TFI Local Link Route 271 (Burtonport/Letterkenny) service links the area to Dungloe, Crolly and Letterkenny.

==People==

* Packie Bonner, football goalkeeper, is from the area around Burtonport.
* Joseph Duffy, martial artist and UFC fighter, is from Burtonport.
* Pat &quot;the Cope&quot; Gallagher, Fianna Fáil politician, was born in Burtonport.
* Major-General Joe Sweeney, Irish military commander and politician who served as both an MP and as a TD, was born and raised in Burtonport.

<doc id="1042760" wikidata="Q8037767" url="?curid=1042760" title="Wrest Point Hotel Casino">
<text>The Wrest Point Hotel Casino is a casino in Tasmania. It was Australia&#x27;s first legal casino, opening in the suburb of Sandy Bay in Hobart, on 10 February 1973.
The hotel tower is the tallest building in Hobart as well as Tasmania.
==History==
Historically, Dunkley&#x27;s Point was a camping ground held by the semi-nomadic Mouheneener people, who held a permanent settlement at nearby Long Beach called &quot;kreewer&quot;. Norfolk Islander Thomas Chaffey constructed his residence on the point between 1808 and 1813, during the British colonisation of Tasmania, which became known as Chaffey&#x27;s Point by the end of his life. The &quot;Traveller&#x27;s Wrest Hotel&quot;, which is still standing today on Sandy Bay Road, was erected by his son William Chaffey in 1836. David Dunkley purchased the Chaffey&#x27;s Point estate from William Chaffey in 1847. He constructed his residence, St. Helena and renamed the area Dunkley&#x27;s Point. George G. Robertson purchased St. Helena in 1898 and rebuilt it, adding a jetty and a boat house. Mrs. G. Minette Lucas purchased the estate in 1928 and erected her mansion, known as &quot;Wrest Point&quot;. The estate was purchased by entrepreneur Arthur James Drysdale in 1936.

===Wrest Point Riviera Hotel===
Designed by architects Colin Philp and David Hartley Wilson, the streamline moderne &quot;Wrest Point Riviera Hotel&quot; was considered &quot;one of the most modern establishments of its kind in Australia&quot; upon opening on 5 December 1939. 400 guests attended the opening, including Tasmanian Premier Edmund Dwyer-Gray.

Built at a cost exceeding £A70,000, the luxurious hotel featured accommodation for 500 patrons. The entirety of Dunkley&#x27;s Point was also redeveloped, featuring tiered garden beds, a heated saltwater bathing pool, tennis court and a private jetty with a steamboat named &quot;Arcadia&quot; offering scenic cruises and a yacht named &quot;Acushla&quot;. Both the pool and tennis courts were walled as a means to protect patrons from undesirably strong winds.

During World War II the hotel was &quot;booming&quot; and the hotel was sold to Australia&#x27;s oldest hotel group, Federal Hotels, in March 1956.

===Granting of the casino licence===
In the 1960s, The Federal Group attempted to secure Australia&#x27;s first casino license. At the time, Tasmania&#x27;s natural scenery and beauty were not widely known elsewhere, and as a result the state wasn&#x27;t attracting many tourists. The marketing claim was that a casino could be the draw-card that would kick-start Tasmania&#x27;s tourism industry.

John Haddad, one of the company&#x27;s executives at the time, was assigned the role of getting a casino license. He met with then Tasmanian Premier Eric Reece and other state officials.

A state referendum was held to determine the granting of a gambling licence. The polls were very tight, especially since the question in the referendum attempted to minimise the gambling aspect of the development.

Shortly before the referendum was to be held, the Labor party, sensing they had the numbers in the parliament pushed through the legislation to legalise the casino. They did not wait for the results of the vote. When the vote was taken the hotel redevelopment was narrowly passed. Questions have since been raised about how the legislation was passed, with one member of parliament, Kevin Lyons, suspected of accepting bribes over the licence.

===Development===
The development of the casino included the construction of the 17-storey hotel tower, with a revolving restaurant, designed by Sir Roy Grounds, a landmark that is nationally identified with Hobart, and the 64-metre dodecagonal prism tower remains the city&#x27;s tallest building.

After the centre&#x27;s opening in 1973 (after which it was known as &quot;Wrest Point Hotel Casino&quot;) the casino provided a catalyst for the nation&#x27;s casino industry, with 12 additional casinos opening across the country. This included a second Federal Group casino in Tasmania, the Country Club Casino, which opened in Launceston in 1982.

The building has been extended in recent years, including the conference centre which was opened in 1984, and the boardwalk in 1996.

Wrest Point underwent an extensive multi-year redevelopment that began in 2018, including new restaurants, gaming areas, and the refurbishment of accommodation.

== Controversy ==
While initially the hotel was supposed to be an entertainment complex, the casino soon took over much of the hotel; and, while the poker machines were initially not permitted, by executing successful lobbying, they now come to dominate the complex, with over 650 machines.

The owners of the hotel and the poker machines, Federal Hotels, were fined on a number of occasions for poker machines that were not functioning as programmed, and were thus in breach of the law.

In 2017, the building was protected with a heritage listing. While some saw this as significant, the decision &quot;angered local residents and puzzled some experts.&quot;

== 2018 Tasmanian election ==
In the 2018 election, the opposition leader, Rebecca White, promised to remove all pokies from pubs and clubs, leaving the two casinos as the only location for pokies in the state, citing the negative health and economic impacts of poker machines. The Federal Group, who own both the casinos and the pokies licences have opposed the policy as have the Liberal government.

<text>Taj El-Din Hamid Hilaly (alternatively spelt Tajeddin Hilaly, Hilali, Al-Hilaly, Taj el-Din al-Hilali, Aldin Alhilali, Tajideen El-Hilaly or Tajeddine; 17 January 1941 – 5 October 2023) was an Egyptian Australian imam of Lakemba Mosque in Sydney and a Sunni Muslim leader in Australia. The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils appointed him Mufti of Australia in 1988. He referred to himself as the Grand Mufti of Australia and New Zealand, although this title was not unanimously endorsed, and was also described by some Muslims as honorary, rather than substantial.

Hilaly was a controversial figure and made several controversial statements, as well as having promoted Islamic extremism on many occasions. Hilaly spread many antisemitic conspiracy theories during his lifetime, including claims that Western countries are controlled by Israel and claims that the Holocaust was a &quot;Zionist lie&quot;. Hilaly was known for his antisemitic, anti-LGBT, anti-Western and Islamic supremacist views, as well as for his misogynistic statements. After a series of controversial statements on social issues, Hilaly retired from this position in June 2007 and was succeeded by Fehmi Naji.

==Early life==
Born in Egypt, Hilaly arrived in Australia in 1982 on a tourist visa from Lebanon. Although the visa was temporary, it was routinely reissued until 1988 when then Minister for Immigration Chris Hurford attempted to have Hilaly deported for being against &quot;Australian values&quot;. The Islamic community showed strong support for Hilaly to remain in Australia, and Hilaly was eventually granted permanent residence in 1990 by Hurford&#x27;s successor Gerry Hand.

==Appointment as Imam==
Hilaly served as Imam at Lakemba Mosque, which is run by the Lebanese Muslim Association. However, his wages were paid by &quot;the Libyan Islamic Call Society and private individuals&quot;, according to a former vice-president of the LMA.

==Criminal charges==
In 1999 Hilaly was charged and jailed after being convicted of being involved in smuggling goods from Egypt to Australia, which he denied.

In early 2003 Hilaly&#x27;s vehicle was stopped because an object was protruding from it. After closer inspection, New South Wales Police charged him with driving an unregistered and uninsured vehicle, as well as for his behaviour towards the police officers. This incident led to an attack against police officers by nearby Muslims and widespread condemnation from the public. Although charges of assaulting the police officers, hindering the officers, and resisting arrest were later dropped due to police using invalid evidence to justify their suspicion and subsequent search, Hilaly was fined A$400 for the incident.

==Negotiation to free Douglas Wood==
In May 2005 Australian contractor Douglas Wood was abducted by a militant group calling itself the Shura Council of the Mujahideen of Iraq. They demanded that the Australian government withdraw its troops from Iraq in exchange for Wood. Twice that month, Hilaly traveled to Iraq to negotiate Wood&#x27;s release, the second time interrupting treatment for a heart condition and returning, at the explicit request of the Australian government, &quot;to Baghdad to deliver an extraordinary offer to Mr Wood&#x27;s captors, on their behalf.&quot; Hilaly said later, &quot;There was a point where the abductors wanted $25 million. Eventually, we managed to convince them to drop this demand and a figure, in the thousands, was agreed.&quot; Hilaly also claimed to have spoken to Douglas Wood via telephone, yet after Douglas Wood was rescued following a raid by the Iraqi army, Wood denied ever having spoken to Hilaly.

==2005 Australian Muslim Achievement Award==
In July 2005 Hilaly was named &quot;Muslim Man of the Year&quot; for 2005 at the first Australian Muslim Achievement Awards by Mission of Hope (Muslim Community Solutions for Health and Well-being).

==Controversial statements==

===1988 speech regarding Jews===
Australian Jewish organisations have regularly accused Hilaly of antisemitism, a charge he denied. The charges began in 1988 when Hilaly delivered a lecture to a group of Muslim students at University of Sydney on the topic &quot;The Disposition of Jews in the light of the Qur&#x27;an.&quot; He was quoted as saying:

Hilaly did not apologise nor retract his comments, in which he accused Jews of &quot;causing all wars.&quot;

===February 2004 sermon===
In February 2004 Hilaly gave a sermon at a mosque in Sidon, Lebanon, whilst overseas the text of which was translated by the Australian Embassy in Beirut. It appeared to show him supporting terrorist attacks. In his sermon, Hilaly said:

In his speech, he also predicted that Muslims would control the White House and appeared to support Hezbollah. The Australian Federal Police declined to investigate his activities overseas.

===2006 Holocaust denial===
In July 2006 Hilaly was sacked from Prime Minister of Australia John Howard&#x27;s Muslim Community Reference Group following comments he made in which he denied the Holocaust, calling it a &quot;Zionist lie&quot;. He also referred to Israel as a &quot;cancer&quot;. This prompted calls for legal action to be pursued against him in a country which has the highest per-capita number of Holocaust survivors in the world outside Israel.

===October 2006 sermon===

====Comments concerning dress and rape====
In October 2006, Hilaly delivered a Ramadan sermon in Arabic in which he made statements concerning female clothing which proved highly controversial. The key part of these was:

Hilaly also said, &quot;in the state of zina, the responsibility falls 90 per cent of the time on the woman. Why? Because she possesses the weapon of enticement (igraa).&quot; Hilaly later claimed that he had intended to suggest that &quot;if a woman who shows herself off, she is to blame...but a man should be able to control himself.&quot; He also contended that his references to the prison sentence of Bilal Skaf, the leader of a group of Lebanese Australians who committed gang rapes in Sydney in 2000, in which he said that women would &quot;sway suggestively&quot; before men &quot;and then you get a judge without mercy (rahma) and gives you 65 years&quot;, were aimed at illustrating the need for harsh sanctions for rape.

====Reactions and responses====
Phong Nguyen, chairman of the Ethnic Communities&#x27; Council of Victoria, responded by saying, &quot;Cultural diversity and equality between the sexes in Australia means that women are entitled to dress as they choose and should never be judged on their dress choice.&quot; He also commented, &quot;The standard of someone&#x27;s dress should never be used to justify rape, which is a criminal offence.&quot;

Pru Goward, Australia&#x27;s Sex Discrimination Commissioner, responded during a television interview that &quot;It is incitement to a crime. Young Muslim men who now rape women can cite this in court, can quote this man... their leader in court. It&#x27;s time we stopped just saying he should apologise. It is time the Islamic community did more than say they were horrified. I think it is time he left.&quot;

Keysar Trad, a spokesman for Hilaly, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, &quot;From my discussions with him, the issue was not whether they wear a hijab or don&#x27;t wear a hijab. The issue is that every society has a certain dress code, a normal dress code that people go by. So if somebody goes beyond that dress code, if men or women get to the stage where they dress in a manner that is provocative then these people are doing something wrong. He was not talking about rape.&quot;

After such comments were made publicly, on 26 October 2006 Hilaly released a statement. He said, &quot;I unreservedly apologise to any woman who is offended by my comments. I had only intended to protect women&#x27;s honour, something lost in &quot;The Australian&quot; presentation of my talk.&quot;

The Australian National Imams Council was formed in 2006 during a meeting of more than 80 Imams which had gathered to discuss the crisis created by comments made by Taj El-Din Hilaly.

====Bikini march====
In late 2006 Melbourne resident Christine Hawkins organised a bikini rally, in which women were to wear beach clothing and march on Lakemba Mosque and the Islamic Information and Support Centre in Brunswick, Melbourne, to voice their &quot;disgust&quot; at Hilaly&#x27;s comments. Ultimately, organisers claimed that public reports critical of the demonstration and personal attacks caused them to abandon the event.

===January 2007 television comments===
On 8 January 2007, Hilaly appeared on an Egyptian television program. He made a number of comments that sparked criticism in Australia, including the following:
*British and Irish settlers arrived in Australia as convicts. Muslims paid for their own tickets, and so have more right to Australia
*Western people, especially the English race, are the biggest liars and oppressors.

Hilaly also condemned the level of rights awarded to homosexuals in Australia, stating &quot;We have Christian churches which allow people of the same gender to marry&quot; and &quot;I understand the mentality of the West and especially the Australian mentality and I understand that the Australian law guarantees freedoms to the point of insanity.&quot;

=== Proposed political movement===
Following his comments on social and legal issues and in the lead-up to the 2007 Federal election, Hilaly proposed to form a political party to represent Islamic interests in the national Parliament. The party was to have been supported by the political committee of Muslim community elders, also created by Hilaly. The suggested motto was: &quot;With you, from and for you&quot;. A party manifesto had originally been drafted in 2001 but the idea was abandoned in the wake of the 11 September terrorist attacks. Hilaly indicated he would register the party with several thousand members by late 2007.

The proposed new party was immediately criticised. Opposition leader Kevin Rudd was quoted as saying &quot;Australians will never vote for a man who denigrates women, defends gang rapists and makes statements when he is in the Middle East denouncing Australia and Australians.&quot; Prime Minister John Howard commented &quot;It would be unwise because it would heighten the belief of some in the community that islamic Australians are opposed to integration.&quot;

The concept of the Party was abandoned once again in June 2007 when Hilaly retired from his role as Mufti.

==Cleared of alleged links to Hezbollah==
Allegations surfaced that Hilaly was diverting relief funds intended for the victims of the Israel-Lebanon war to Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah, the military wing of which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the Australian Government. On 10 May 2007 the Australian Federal Police cleared Hilaly of diverting charitable funds to Hezbollah.

==Retirement and death==
The Council of Islamic Jurisprudence and Research reappointed Hilaly as Grand Mufti on 10 June 2007; however, he declined the position, thereby ending his term in office.

<doc id="1042768" wikidata="Q5358266" url="?curid=1042768" title="Electronic Key Management System">
<text>The Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) is a United States National Security Agency led program responsible for Communications Security (COMSEC) key management, accounting, and distribution. Specifically, EKMS generates and distributes electronic key material for all NSA encryption systems whose keys are loaded using standard fill devices, and directs the distribution of NSA produced key material. Additionally, EKMS performs account registration, privilege management, ordering, distribution, and accounting to direct the management and distribution of physical COMSEC material for the services. The common EKMS components and standards facilitate interoperability and commonality among the armed services and civilian agencies.

Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) replaces EKMS.

== Reasons for development ==
The primary reason for the development of EKMS centers on the security and logistics problems that plagued the COMSEC Material Control System (CMCS), which replaced the Registered Publications System (RPS) in the 1970s. The CMCS was a very labor-intensive operation that had been stretched to capacity. The most serious, immediate concern was the human threat associated with access to and exploitation of paper key throughout its life cycle. The disclosure of the Walker spy ring was clear justification of this concern. Although eliminating the majority of paper keys will greatly reduce this human threat, the long-term goal of EKMS to minimize human access to keys will not be realized until benign fill key is fully implemented. Benign fill permits the encrypted distribution of electronic keying material directly to the COMSEC device without human access to the key itself.

The need for joint interoperability led to the Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, under which the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) tasked NSA, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and the Joint Tactical Command, Control and Communications Agency (JTC3A) to develop a Key Management Goal Architecture (KMGA). Subsequent difficulties in coordinating COMSEC distribution and support during joint military operations, e.g., Desert Storm, Urgent Fury, and Operation Just Cause, have further emphasized the need for a system capable of interoperability between the Services.

== Central facility (Tier 0) ==
EKMS starts with the Central Facility (CF), run by NSA, which provides a broad range of capabilities to the Services and other government agencies. The CF, also referred to as Tier 0, is the foundation of EKMS. Traditional paper-based keys, and keys for Secure Telephone Unit – Third Generation (STU-III), STE, FNBDT, Iridium, Secure Data Network System (SDNS), and other electronic key are managed from an underground building in Finksburg, Maryland which is capable of the following:
* processing orders for both physical and electronic keys
* electronically generating and distributing keys
* generating key material for FIREFLY (an NSA algorithm)
* performing seed conversion and rekey
* maintaining compromise recovery and management of FIREFLY material
* support for over-the-air rekeying (OTAR)
The CF talks to other EKMS elements through a variety of media, communication devices, and networks, either through direct distance dialing using STU-III (data mode) or dedicated link access using KG-84 devices. During the transition to full electronic key, the 3.5-inch floppy disk and 9-track magnetic tape are also supported. A common user interface, the TCP/IP-based message service, is the primary method of communication with the CF. The message service permits EKMS elements to store EKMS messages that include electronic key for later retrieval by another EKMS element.

== Tier 1 ==
Under CMCS, each service maintained a central office of record (COR) that performed basic key and COMSEC management functions, such as key ordering, distribution, inventory control, etc. Under EKMS, each service operates its own key management system using EKMS Tier 1 software that supports physical and electronic key distribution, traditional electronic key generation, management of material distribution, ordering, and other related accounting and COR functions. Common Tier 1 is based on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s key distribution system (NKDS) software developed by the Naval Research Laboratory and further developed by SAIC in San Diego.

== Tier 2 ==

EKMS Tier 2, the Local Management Device (LMD), is composed of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) personal computer (PC) running the Santa Cruz Operation&#x27;s SCO UNIX operating system, and an NSA KOK-22A Key Processor (KP). The KP is a trusted component of EKMS. It performs cryptographic functions, including encryption and decryption functions for the account, as well as key generation, and electronic signature operations. The KP is capable of secure field generation of traditional keys. Locally generated keys can be employed in crypto-net communications, transmission security (TRANSEC) applications, point-to-point circuits, and virtually anywhere that paper-based keys were used. Electronic keys can be downloaded directly to a fill device, such as the KYK-13, KYX-15, or the more modern AN/CYZ-10 Data Transfer Device (DTD) for further transfer (or fill) into the end cryptographic unit.

== Tier 3 ==
The lowest tier or layer of the EKMS architecture which includes the AN/CYZ-10 (Data Transfer Device (DTD)), the SKL (Simple Key Loader) AN/PYQ-10, and all other means used to fill keys to End Cryptographic Units (ECUs); hard copy material holdings only; and STU-III/STE material only using Key Management Entities (KMEs) (i.e., Local Elements (LEs)). Unlike LMD/KP Tier 2 accounts, Tier 3 using entities never receive electronic key directly from a COR or Tier 0.

<text>The Court of Aldermen forms part of the senior governance of the City of London Corporation. It comprises twenty-five Aldermen of the City of London, presided over by the Lord Mayor (becoming senior Alderman during his or her year of office). The Court was originally responsible for the entire administration of the City, but most of its responsibilities were subsumed by the Court of Common Council in the fourteenth century. The Court of Aldermen meets seven times a year in the Aldermen&#x27;s Court Room at Guildhall. The few remaining duties of the Court include approving people for Freedom of the City, approving the formation of new livery companies, and appointing the Recorder of London.

== History ==
It is probable that no definite account of the origin of the office of Alderman, or of the body known as the Court of Aldermen can ever be written for, and is likely that the office of the Aldermen of the City of London came into existence by a process of natural growth and development created by the necessities of the times. The first possible mention of the court comes from 1200, &#x27;fiveand-twenty of the more discreet men of the City&#x27; were &#x27;sworn to take counsel on behalf of the City together with the Mayor&#x27;, although this could possibly be an early form of the London Common Council, as in 1200 there were only 24 wards.

== Term of office ==
Although there is no compulsion by law to do so, Aldermen usually submit themselves for re-election every six years and by custom retire at the age of 70.

In 2020, David Graves declined to stand for re-election after six years as Alderman for Cripplegate, stating &quot;given the current CV-19 concerns and limitations, I decided that to trigger a 42 ... day electoral process now would be inappropriate and unsuitable for the good conduct of a fair election&quot;. He again deferred standing for re-election in 2021 for the same reason, triggering calls for the reform of the law relating to this election.

<text>Jacques-Laurent Agasse (April 24, 1767 – December 27, 1849) was an animal and landscape painter from Switzerland.

Born at Geneva, Agasse studied in the public art school of that city. Before he turned twenty he went to Paris to study in veterinary school to make himself fully acquainted with the anatomy of horses and other animals. He seems to have subsequently returned to Switzerland. The &quot;Tübinger Morgenblatt&quot; (1808, p. 876) says that &quot;Agasse, the celebrated animal painter, now in England, owed his fortune to an accident. About eight years ago, he being then in Switzerland, a rich Englishman (George Pitt, later Lord Rivers) asked him to paint his favourite dog (greyhound) which had died. The Englishman was so pleased with his work that he took the painter to England with him.&quot;

Nagler says that he was one of the most celebrated animal painters at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century. In Johann Georg Meusel&#x27;s &quot;Neue Miscellaneen&quot; (viii. 1052 et seq.), he compares Agasse and Wouwermans, wholly in favour of the former. In that partial article much is said of his extreme devotion to art, of his marvelous knowledge of anatomy, of his special fondness for the English racehorses, and his excellence in depicting them. He appears first in the Academy catalogues in 1801 as the exhibitor of the &#x27;Portrait of a Horse&#x27;, and continued to exhibit more or less until 1845 (contradicting Nagler&#x27;s statement that he died &quot;about&quot; 1806).

In the catalogues his name is given as J.L. Agasse or Agassé. The number of times Agassé changed his address confirms Redgrave&#x27;s assertion that &quot;he lived poor and died poor&quot;. The writer of the panegyric already quoted says, however, that he did not work for money, but that he was urged forward by the resistless force of natural genius.

<text>Cumberland County is a county in the State of New South Wales, Australia. Most of the Sydney metropolitan area is located within the County of Cumberland.

The County of Cumberland stretches from Broken Bay to the north, the Hawkesbury River to the north-west, the Nepean River to the west, the Cataract River to the south-west and the northern suburbs of Wollongong to the south. It includes the area of the Cumberland Plain.

Note that Cumberland County should not be confused with the former Cumberland County Council, a county council which existed from 1945 to 1964, and which despite the shared name was a legally distinct entity, with a distinct (albeit largely overlapping) territory, the Cumberland county district.

== History ==

The name &quot;Cumberland&quot; was conferred by Governor Arthur Phillip in honour of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn at a gathering to celebrate the birthday of his brother, George III, on 4 June 1788. The county has been marked on maps since the start of the colony, as shown along the key on a 1789 map describing Port Jackson as being within the county of Cumberland. In the nineteenth century, parts of the county were in the South and North Riding electoral districts from 1856 to 1859, which were replaced by Central Cumberland. There was also the Cumberland Boroughs electoral district.

== Sub-divisions ==

=== Hundreds ===

There were thirteen hundreds in Cumberland County, which were published in a government gazette on 27 May 1835, but repealed on 21 January 1888. Unlike South Australia, the hundreds were never adopted anywhere else in New South Wales. The hundreds:
* Bringelly
* Campbelltown
* Dundas
* Evan
* Hardinge
* Liverpool
* Packenham
* Parramatta
* Richmond
* Southend
* Hundred of Sydney
* Windsor
* Woronora (shown as Heathcote on some maps)

=== Parishes ===

In 1835, Cumberland County was subdivided into 57 parishes. Previously, the subdivisions of the area since the beginning of the colony were called districts. Many of the parishes founded in 1835 kept the name of the district. Others were named after Anglican churches in the same area. This included three of the four small parishes in the Sydney city area: The Parish of St Philip, which is named after St Philip&#x27;s Church; the Parish of St James, which is named after St James Church, and is still the name of the region today; and finally the Parish of St Andrew which is named after St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral. However, the Parish of St Lawrence gave its name to the church, rather than the other way around. Further out of the city, the parishes of St John, St Luke, St Peter and St Matthew, in the Parramatta, Liverpool, Campbelltown and Windsor areas respectively, have Anglican churches which bear the same saints names; St John&#x27;s in Parramatta (opened 1803); St.Luke&#x27;s in Liverpool (building began 1818); St.Peter&#x27;s in Campbelltown (opened 1823, the third oldest Anglican church in Australia); and St. Matthew&#x27;s in Windsor (consecrated in 1822)

A full list of parishes found within this county; the LGAs which the parish is mostly in (most parish boundaries do not match LGA boundaries exactly), and mapping coordinates to the approximate centre of each location is as follows:

=== Districts ===

The first subdivisions of the county were called districts, shown in early maps from the period, such as 21 districts on an 1810 map and 37 districts on an 1824 map (not including Philip which was across the Nepean River and not part of the county). The districts in use in 1824:

<text>Kyrksæterøra is the administrative center of Heim Municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. The village was known as the &quot;white town of Hemnfjorden&quot; at one time because there were only white houses. It is located at the end of Hemnfjorden, about southwest of the village of Holla. The villages of Hellandsjøen and Heim both lie to the north and the village of Vinjeøra lies to the south. Hemne Church is located in the village. Norwegian County Road 680 passes through the village. The newspaper &quot;Søvesten&quot; has been published in Kyrksæterøra since 1994.

The village has a population (2024) of 2,598 and a population density of .

At one time, there was a shoe factory, a shipyard, a lumber mill, and fish processing plant in the area. Kyrksæterøra was bombed during World War II, but there were no deaths and there was minimal damage. Nearby, the Nazis also had a large camp for Russian prisoners-of-war.

==Name==

<doc id="1042794" wikidata="Q670673" url="?curid=1042794" title="Arizona State Route 69">
<text>State Route 69 (SR 69) is a highway that serves as the main road to Prescott, Arizona, from Interstate 17. The highway mainly consists of four-lanes (two per side), although some sections in Prescott and Prescott Valley are wider. Prior to the construction of Interstate 17 in the 1960s and early 1970s, State Route 69 continued south to Phoenix, Arizona, as the Prescott-Phoenix Hwy or Black Canyon Highway on a different alignment, through the ghost towns of Bumble Bee and Cordes.

==Route description==

The southern terminus of SR 69 is located at exit 262 of I-17, at a spot known as Cordes Junction. It heads northwest from this interchange passing through Mayer before curving towards the north at Poland Junction. It continues north to a junction with SR 169 in Dewey-Humboldt. The highway gradually curves towards the west after this junction as it heads through Prescott Valley. It continues its gradual curve towards the southwest until it curves towards the west near Yavapai Hills. The highway continues towards the west until it reaches its terminus at SR 89 in Prescott.

==History==

SR 69 was first established as a state highway on May 19, 1936. The new route served as a shorter connection than the pre-existing US 89 from Phoenix to Prescott for northbound travelers. The original route taken by SR 69 reached Mayer from Black Canyon City, by way of Bumble Bee and Cordes. By 1951, a new paved alignment of SR 69 had been constructed between New River and Cordes, bypassing the original road through Bumble Bee. By 1958, SR 69 was re-routed on another new alignment through Cordes Junction, bypassing the remainder old route between New River and Mayer, through Cordes. Despite being bypassed by a newer alignment, the original route was still owned and maintained by the state until December 28, 1962. SR 69 was truncated from Phoenix to Cordes Junction in 1970, after Interstate 17 was completed.

<text>The state of New South Wales is divided into three divisions: the Eastern Division, the Central Division, and the Western Division. These were established for the purposes of the management of the lease of Crown land to private persons.
The Western Division includes Broken Hill, Bourke, Cobar, Cockburn (NSW half), Walgett, Wentworth as well as the western land boards of Forbes, Griffith, Rankins Springs, West Wyalong, White Cliffs, Wyalong, Conargo, Hay and Parkes.

The &quot;Western Lands Act 1901&quot; established a &quot;Western Lands Board&quot;, composed of three commissioners, to issue leases in the Western Division. The See government appointed Colin James McMasters as chairman on a salary of £1,500 per year and Robert McDonald and Hugh Langwell as commissioners on a salary of £1,000 per year. In 1931 the Lang government appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the administration of the Western Lands Division, including whether the then commissioners, Hugh Langwell, George Australia Denning and Arthur Willim Mullen were guilty of misbehaviour or incompetence. The commissioner, Ernest Arthur Prior, found that they had been negligent and incompetent, and they were dismissed on the advice of cabinet.

The &quot;Western Lands (Amendment Act) 1934&quot; dissolved the &quot;Western Lands Board&quot;, and appointed a single &quot;Western Lands Commissioner&quot; in its stead, to carry out the same functions.

Today, the Western Lands Commissioner is part of the Department of Lands.

Most of the land in the Western Division of NSW remains perpetual leasehold; as such, the Western Lands Commissioner retains an active function to this day in the administration of the leases.

<text>The Suessiones were a Belgic tribe, dwelling in the modern Aisne and Oise regions during the La Tène and Roman periods.

During the Gallic Wars (58–50 BC), their oppidum Noviodunum (Pommiers) was besieged and conquered by Caesar. Following their defeat by the Romans at the end of the campaign of 57 BC, they fell into dependence upon Rome and remained faithful to the Romans during the revolt of 51 BC.

== Name ==
=== Attestations ===
They are mentioned as &quot;Suessiones&quot; by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC) and Pliny (1st c. AD), as &quot;Souessíōnes&quot; (Σουεσσίωνες) and &quot;Ou̓essíōnas&quot; (Οὐεσσίωνας) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD), and as &quot;Ouéssones&quot; (Οὐέσσονες) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD).

=== Etymology ===
The etymology of the Gaulish ethnonym &quot;Suessiones&quot; has been debated, but most scholars derive it from the word for &#x27;six&#x27;, (cf. Gaulish &#x27;sixth&#x27;, Irish , Welsh &#x27;six&#x27;), after a Gallic custom of including numbers in tribal names (e.g. &quot;Vo-contii&quot;, &quot;Vo-corii&quot;, &quot;Tri-corii&quot;, &quot;Petru-corii&quot;). Other proposed etymologies include &quot;*su-ed-ti-ones&quot; (&#x27;rich in food&#x27;), or a formation from the root &quot;*swe-&quot; (&#x27;proper, to oneself&#x27;). The tribal name &quot;Suessetani&quot; and the place-name (), both attested in Iberia, are probably linguistically related.

The city of Soissons, attested as &quot;Augusta Suessionum&quot; in the 4th c. AD (&quot;Suessio&quot; in 561, &quot;Soisson&quot; in 1288), and the region of Soissonnais, are named after the tribe.

== Geography ==

=== Territory ===

The territory of the Suessiones was bordered by the forest of the Oise valley to the west, and by wooded heights along the Marne river (near Épernay) to the southeast. They dwelt northeast of the smaller Meldi and Silvanectes, and west of the Remi.

=== Settlements ===

==== La Tène period ====
The oppidum of Villeneuve-Saint-Germain, founded on a plain near the Aisne river in the middle of the 1st century BC, was the main settlement of the Suessiones before the Roman conquest. It was an important Gallic agglomeration, reaching 70ha at its height.

From the period of the Gallic Wars (58–50 BC), their chief town became the oppidum of Pommiers, generally identified with the fortress of &quot;Noviodunum&quot; (Gaulish: &#x27;new fortress&#x27;) mentioned by Caesar. Pommiers was progressively abandoned and became unoccupied after the end of reign of Augustus (27 BC–14 AD), when their chief town became Augusta Suessionum.

Smaller oppida were also located at Ambleny, Pont-Saint-Mard, or Epagny.

==== Roman period ====
Augusta Suessionum (modern Soissons), founded ca. 20 BC on an area more adapted to urbanization than Villeneuve-Saint-Germain and Pommiers, became the capital of the &quot;civitas&quot; &quot;Suessionum&quot; during the Roman period. Reaching 100–120ha at its height, it was one of the most important settlements of northwestern Gaul. The Germanic Migrations in the 3rd century AD led to the erection of fortifications around the city. Rome was only able to defend the region until the defeat of Syagrius against the Frankish king Clovis in 486.

Smaller agglomerations within the &quot;civitas&quot; were also located at Château-Thierry, Ciry-Salsogne, Épaux-Bézu, Blesmes, Sinceny, and Ressons-le-Long.

== History ==

=== La Tène period ===
According to archaeologist Jean-Louis Brunaux, large-scale migrations occurred in the northern part of Gaul in the late 4th–early 3rd century BC, which may correspond to the coming of the Belgae. Those cultural changes emerged later among the Suessiones, who probably came to be fully integrated to the Belgae only after the 3rd century. New funerary customs (from burial to cremation) are noticeable from 250–200 BC on the territories of the Ambi or Bellovaci, whereas incineration occurred later in the Aisne valley, from around 200–150.

Around 80 BC, the Suessones king Diviciacus gained supremacy in areas of southeastern Britain.

=== Gallic Wars ===
Caesar recounts in his &quot;Gallic Wars&quot; that in 57 BC the Suessiones were ruled by Galba.

== Political organization ==
Until the Gallic Wars (58–50 BC), the Suessiones shared a common cultural identity with the neighbouring Remi, which with they were linked by the same law, the same magistrates and a unified commander-in-chief. In reality, this virtual state of union between the two tribes probably leaned in favour of the Suessiones. When Caesar entered Gallia Belgica in 57 BC, the Remi asked the protection of the Romans, thus gaining independence from a possibly asymmetrical relationship. The Meldi were probably also tributary to the more powerful Suessiones.

During the Roman period, the Suessiones were regarded as dependant upon Rome, whereas the Remi were considered the allies of the Romans. Parts of the Suessionean territory were given to the Remi, the Meldi, and perhaps to the Sulbanectes. The dependency of the Suessiones upon the Remi appears to have lasted until the beginning of the 1st century AD, and a Roman military presence is attested in Suessionean territory at the camp of Arlaines (Ressons-le-Long) until the Flavian period.

== Religion ==
In Augusta Suessionum were found a votive stele dedicated to the native goddess Camuloriga (&quot;Camloriga&quot;), and a statuette of the Roman god Mercury. The divine name &quot;Camuloriga&quot; stems from the Gaulish term &quot;camulos&quot;, possibly translated as &#x27;champion, servant&#x27; (denoting one who makes efforts) and attached to the suffix &quot;-riga-&quot; (&quot;&lt; rigani&quot; &#x27;queen&#x27;; compare with Old Irish &quot;rígain&quot; &#x27;queen&#x27;).

Rural sanctuaries have been identified at Fossoy, Grand-Rozoy, and Pasly. Archaeologists have not been able to identify which deities were worshipped there.

== Economy ==
The Suessiones straddled two river routes, the Aisne and the Marne. Coinage minted by Belgic Gauls first appeared in Britain in the mid-2nd century BC with the coinage now categorized as the &quot;Gallo-Belgic A&quot; type. Coins associated with King Diviciacus of the Suessiones, issued near or between 90 and 60 BC, have been categorized as &quot;Gallo-Belgic C&quot;. Finds of this issue of coin extend from Sussex to the Wash, with a concentration of finds near Kent. A later issue of coin, &quot;Gallo-Belgic F&quot; (c. 60–50 BC), has concentrated finds near Paris, throughout the lands of the Suessiones, and the southern, coastal areas of Britain. These finds lead scholars to suggest that the Suessiones had significant trade and migration into Britain during the 2nd and 1st centuries prior to Roman conquest. Caesar describes the Belgae as going to Britain looking for booty: &quot;The inland part of Britain is inhabited by tribes declared in their own tradition to be indigenous to the island, the maritime part by tribes that migrated at an earlier time from Belgium to seek booty by invasion.&quot;

<text>Jettying (jetty, jutty, from Old French &quot;getee, jette&quot;) is a building technique used in medieval timber-frame buildings in which an upper floor projects beyond the dimensions of the floor below. This has the advantage of increasing the available space in the building without obstructing the street. Jettied floors are also termed &quot;jetties&quot;. In the U.S., the most common surviving colonial version of this is the garrison house. Most jetties are external, but some early medieval houses were built with internal jetties.

== Structure ==

A jetty is an upper floor that depends on a cantilever system in which a horizontal beam, the jetty bressummer, supports the wall above and projects forward beyond the floor below (a technique also called &quot;oversailing&quot;). The bressummer (or breastsummer) itself rests on the ends of a row of jetty beams or joists which are supported by jetty plates. Jetty joists in their turn were slotted sideways into the diagonal dragon beams at angle of 45° by means of mortise and tenon joints.

The overhanging corner posts are often reinforced by curved jetty brackets.

The origins of jettying are unclear but some reasons put forward for their purpose are:
* to gain space.
* the structural advantage of the jettied wall counteracting forces in the joists or tying a stone wall together
* to shelter the lower walls of the house from the weather.
* to simplify joinery.
* uses shorter timbers, a benefit due to timber shortages and difficult handling of long timbers especially in city streets.
* as a &quot;symbol of wealth and status.&quot;

Jetties were popular in the 16th century but banned in Rouen in 1520 relating to air circulation and the plague, and London in 1667 relating to the great fire. They are considered a Gothic style.

Structurally, jetties are of several types:
* framed on multiple joists.
* framed on a few beams.
* framed on brackets added to the posts.
* hewn jetty also called a false jetty: Framed on projections of the posts rather than on cantilevered beams (or brackets).

===Vertical elements===
The vertical elements of jetties can be summarized as:
* the more massive corner posts of the timber frame that support the dragon beam from the floor below and are supported in their turn by the dragon beam for the extended floor above.
* the less substantial studs of the close studding along the walls above and below the jetty.

===Horizontal elements===

The horizontal elements of jetties are:
* the jetty breastsummer (or bressummer), the sill on which the projecting wall above rests; the bressummer stretches across the whole width of the jetty wall
*the dragon-beam which runs diagonally from one corner to another, and supports the corner posts above and is supported in turn by the corner posts below
*the jetty beams or joists which conform to the greater dimensions of the floor above but rest at right angles on the jetty-plates that conform to the shorter dimensions of the floor below. The jetty beams are morticed at 45° into the sides of the dragon beams. They are the main constituents of the cantilever system and they determine how far the jetty projects
*the jetty-plates, designed to carry the jetty-beams or joints. The jetty-plate itself is supported by the corner posts of the recessed floor below.

==Cantilever==

Jettying was used for timber-framed buildings, but was succeeded by cantilever which are used for the same reason as jettying, to maximise space in buildings. This is often utilised on buildings which are on a narrow plot and space is at a premium.

==Forebay==
The Pennsylvania barn in the U.S. has a distinctive cantilever called a forebay, not a jetty.

==Mediterranean area==
The traditional Turkish house is a half-timbered house with a cantilevered or supported overhang called a cumba.

In the North African Maghreb, houses in medieval city kasbahs often featured jetties. Contemporary examples still survive in the Casbah of Algiers.

The House of Opus Craticum, built before AD 79 in Roman Herculaneum, has a supported cantilever.

<text>Ralph Bradley Miller (born May 19, 1953) is an American attorney, congressman and former U.S. Representative for , serving from 2003 to 2013. District 13 included all of Caswell and Person counties, and parts of Alamance, Granville, Guilford, Rockingham and Wake counties. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life, education, and law career==
Miller was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina to Margaret Hale Miller and Nathan David Miller.

Miller earned a BA degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1975, a Master&#x27;s degree from the London School of Economics in 1978, and a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School in 1979. After graduation he served as clerk to Judge J. Dickson Phillips Jr. of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

Miller practiced Law in Raleigh before entering politics.

==North Carolina legislature==
He was a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1992 until 1994 and a member of the North Carolina Senate from 1996 to 2002.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 2002, Miller was elected to represent North Carolina&#x27;s 13th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Following the 2000 Census, Miller had a hand in redrawing the district map which established NC 13. During the 2002 election, Miller advanced from a crowded Democratic primary, which included former Congressman Robin Britt, to defeat Republican Carolyn Grant and a Libertarian candidate with roughly 55% of the vote. Grant later sued Miller alleging, among other things, that he and his campaign defamed her in an October 2002 television advertisement. She later dropped the suit after she failed to comply with several court orders. 

Miller was elected to his second term in the 2004 Congressional elections, earning 59% of the vote and defeating Republican Virginia Johnson.

Miller&#x27;s opponent in the 2006 race was Vernon Robinson, a conservative African American politician who is a former city council member and current resident of Winston-Salem, North Carolina (outside the thirteenth congressional district). Robinson was able to garner national attention due to his bombastic and exaggerative rhetoric. Robinson made several accusations against Miller, including that he was cutting money from US troops to study the sex lives of prostitutes. He also claimed that Miller was gay, despite having a wife, and that he was allowing illegal immigrants to sneak into America. Miller defeated Robinson 63.71% to 36.29%.

In 2007 Miller considered a run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Elizabeth Dole but decided against it. Later, he ruled out running against Sen. Richard Burr in 2010.

After the 2010 United States Census, Republicans who controlled the state&#x27;s General Assembly redrew the districts. In the process, they placed Miller into a new, heavily Republican 13th District stretching from northern Raleigh all the way to Surry County on the other side of the state. While Barack Obama carried the old 13th fairly handily with 59 percent of the vote, John McCain would have won the reconfigured 13th with 56 percent of the vote.

However, after 1st District Congressman G. K. Butterfield raised objections that the new map violated the rights of African-American voters in the eastern part of the state, the state legislature was forced to redraw the map again. The new plan made the 13th more compact, taking in territory from areas just west and east of Raleigh to just east of Rocky Mount. However, it is still significantly more Republican than its predecessor; McCain would have won it with 54 percent. The new map also placed Miller&#x27;s apartment complex 50 yards inside the 4th district, represented by fellow Democrat David Price, but left the rest of Miller&#x27;s precinct in the 13th. On January 26, 2012, Miller announced that he would not seek re-election to Congress.

===Tenure===
;Education
Miller co-founded and co-chairs the bipartisan congressional Community College caucus, which educates members of Congress on the importance of community colleges. For his efforts, he was recognized with the Congressional Award from the Council for Resource Development.

;Healthcare reform
Miller voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

;Financial reform
The Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2009
In Congress, Miller served on the House Financial Services Committee, where he has worked to protect consumers from abusive lending, especially predatory mortgage lending. In 2007 and 2009 the House passed comprehensive federal mortgage lending reform legislation authored by Miller, but neither bill was subsequently considered in the Senate.

;Financial Product Safety Commission Act of 2009
In 2009 Miller introduced legislation with Rep. Bill Delahunt (D-MA) to establish a Financial Product Safety Commission. The bill, modeled on a concept proposed by Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, was subsequently included in the financial regulatory reform package announced by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on July 24, 2009.

;Emergency Homeownership and Mortgage Equity Protection Act of 2007
On September 20, 2007 Miller introduced H.R. 3609, becoming the first member of Congress to propose that bankruptcy courts be allowed to modify the mortgage debt of persons in foreclosure or against whom foreclosure proceedings had been commenced.

;AIG Hearing
On March 18, 2009 Miller, a member of the Financial Services Committee, excoriated American International Group (AIG) Chairman Edward Liddy during testimony pertaining to the insurance company&#x27;s controversial financial policies following its receipt of federal assistance. Miller cited AIG&#x27;s allocation of $49.5 billion of taxpayer resources toward bank credit insurance policies, criticizing the company for acting to compromise &quot;market discipline.&quot;

;Repeal of Defense of Marriage Act
In September 2011, Miller announced that he will co-sponsor a bill that would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law that forbids federal agencies from recognizing the legal marriages of gay and lesbian couples. Describing the legislation, Miller said &quot;North Carolina would still not be required to perform civil marriage, but it would be required to recognize marriages performed in other states.&quot; The announcement comes on the heels of the North Carolina Legislature announcing that it would include a proposed constitutional amendment on the next ballot banning gay marriage.

;Environment
Miller was originally in favor of having the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) located close to his district in Butner, North Carolina, but changed his mind after his constituents objected to the project.

<text>Jeremy Thomas McRae Blackall (born 19 March 1969), better known by his stage name Tom McRae, is an English singer-songwriter.

==Career==
The son of two Church of England vicars, McRae sang in the church choir and as a teen experimented with his mother&#x27;s guitar. Initially trying to emulate his heroes, Billy Bragg, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Neil Young, Kate Bush, U2, he began to write his own songs and develop his own style. At the age of 18, he went to City of London Polytechnic achieving a degree in politics and government, 
and forming his first band, &quot;The Ministers of Orgasm&quot;. Subsequently, McRae was involved in bands &quot;Raising Cain&quot; and &quot;Orchid Lounge&quot;. A chance meeting with recording engineer and record producer Roger Bechirian, (Elvis Costello, Squeeze, Carlene Carter, The Undertones), led to a working relationship. Bechirian helped to shape McRae&#x27;s soft-spoken sound, which later gained McRae a deal with Dave Bates&#x27;s db Records (db records). In 2000, director Scott Walker chose McRae to perform at the Meltdown Festival in the Royal Festival Hall. McRae&#x27;s confessional, self-titled debut appeared in autumn 2001, during the height of the new acoustic movement and earned him comparisons to Nick Drake and Bob Dylan. Critics raved and McRae gained nominations for the Mercury Prize, a &quot;Q&quot; magazine award and the BRIT Award for Best Newcomer. By then, McRae was working with Oliver (&quot;Oli&quot;) Kraus, cellist, and in 2003 was joined by Olli Cunningham on keyboards. McRae&#x27;s second album, &quot;Just Like Blood&quot;, was released in the UK in February 2003 produced by Ben Hillier, whose credits include Elbow, Martha Wainwright and Blur. McRae then moved to California, where he wrote and recorded his next album, &quot;All Maps Welcome&quot;, which was released in May 2005.

In 2005, McRae supported Tori Amos on the UK/Ireland leg of her &quot;Original Sinsuality&quot; tour. Having played many times in the Hotel Café in Los Angeles and having been one of the artists on the first U.S Hotel Cafe Tour, McRae brought the Tour to the UK in 2006, introducing his fans to many other singer-songwriters which most notably included Steve Reynolds, Joe Purdy, Cary Brothers, and Jim Bianco. The Hotel Cafe Tour saw the artists participating in each other&#x27;s songs. The tour also featured a variety of special guests, including Kathryn Williams, Justin Currie, Colin MacIntyre and Aqualung.

McRae&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;King of Cards&quot;, was recorded in Suffolk and released in May 2007.

In spring 2008, McRae once again brought the Hotel Cafe Tour to the UK, and for the first time, also took it to continental Europe. This time he was accompanied by Cary Brothers, Brian Wright, Catherine Feeny, Greg Laswell, Jim Bianco and Jason (or Dr.) Kanakis. Again, there were special guests at each location, including Eddi Reader and Turin Brakes.

McRae was a guest vocalist for the band &quot;Wills and the Willing&quot; at a number of festivals in the UK in summer 2008, and had a headline slot at the Offset festival in August. In autumn 2008, he toured the North Eastern states of America and Canada.

McRae&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The Alphabet of Hurricanes&quot;, was produced in his own recording studio, Gunpoint, in East London. The album was recorded over three years in varied settings, and, thanks to a deal with Cooking Vinyl was released in February 2010. The &quot;Alphabet of Hurricanes&quot; Tours, which sold-out at a number of venues, were rescheduled to fit in with the album release. Towards the end of 2010, McRae was involved in the Crossing Border festival in the Netherlands, playing with the Matangi Quartet who are based in that country. He released a second live album, &quot;Tom at Tut&#x27;s&quot; with songs and banter garnered from 2 full band gigs at King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow in 2004. In the spring of 2011, Tom toured the UK and Europe with a UK string quartet, and did a solo tour in Germany. 2012 saw the arrival of his sixth studio album &quot;From the Lowlands&quot;, being the long-awaited second part of the &quot;Alphabet of Hurricanes&quot;, and Tom&#x27;s first solo tour in France, the UK and Ireland which was met with sold-out venues. A further leg of the solo tour in April 2013 coincided with a commercial release of &quot;From the Lowlands&quot;.

On 7 September 2013, instrumental music composed by McRae was performed as part of a multimedia art installation of video-artist Klaus Verscheure &quot;14 EMOTIONS/Allegoria Via Dolorosa&quot; by the Belgian group Spectra Ensemble at the Transformator/Happening (festival of metamorphosis) in Zwevegem, Belgium.

In 2014, among other writing projects, McRae wrote the song, &quot;Love More or Less&quot; for Marianne Faithfull&#x27;s album, Give My Love to London and worked on his seventh album, &quot;Did I Sleep and Miss the Border&quot;, released on 11 May 2015. He continued writing songs and music for other artists but was able to release his eighth album &quot;Ah, the World! Oh, the World&quot; in September 2017, with a companion book, and his UK tour to promote the album, quickly sold out.

In 2020, McRae collaborated with Welsh singer-songwriter Lowri Evans, under the name Evans-Mcrae, to create an album of original music entitled Only Skin.

During lockdown in 2021, McRae kept himself busy translating a collection of songs by well-known French singer Michel Polnareff.
McRae takes to the longest tour of his career this Autumn 2024, around the United Kingdom,Crown Dependancies and Europe.

The ÉTRANGE HIVER Tour coincides with McRae&#x27;s 10th album, of the same name. It features duets with French artists, blending English and French songs. Inspired by his love for French music and his European identity post-Brexit, McRae collaborates with artists like Keren Ann and Chien Noir. The album explores themes of love, loss, and political and environmental issues, offering a mix of cinematic and intimate moments.
These songs as well as a plethora of back-catalogue classics are promised on this exhaustive, but intimate tour, playing many venues for the first time, often suggested by rural fans.

As of July 2024, McRae branched out with a Podcast and Archive section called MacRaetheisms, a nod to previous fan-made definitions of all things McRae-ish.

<doc id="1042819" wikidata="Q16926917" url="?curid=1042819" title="History of cycling in New Zealand">
<text>The bicycle originally reached New Zealand in the 1860s in the form of the velocipede, also known as the &#x27;boneshaker&#x27;. These bikes, as elsewhere, soon evolved into the elegant &#x27;high wheelers&#x27;, known today as penny-farthings. Popular among wealthy young men, these offered adventure and speed (&quot;Colonials like to get along fast&quot;, one newspaper wrote), but were also dangerous due to the lack of modern features like efficient brakes. Additionally the fact that they were useless on the rough and hilly roads of most of the country, ensured that they were seldom used for anything other than sport and recreation. 

By the late 1880s, the safety bicycle was being produced: with a lower frame and pneumatic tyres, it was a popular model for women to ride, and consequently brought about a new form of freedom for them. Kate Sheppard was involved with the first cycle club in Christchurch in 1892: the Atalanta Cycle Club. The bicycle has therefore been credited as significant in bringing women&#x27;s enfranchisement to New Zealand.

It was the &#x27;safety bicycle&#x27;, with its chain, sprockets and similar sized wheels that catapulted the bicycle into the public arena. Sales boomed, prices dropped and, for half a century, the bicycle became a transport of the masses, at least in the somewhat more level and developed areas of the country.

Cycle tracks were being built alongside some main roads in 1949 and 1950.

However, in the 1950s and 60s, driven by rising affluence and government transport policies, New Zealanders turned away from most other transport methods to become one of the countries with the highest car ownership ratios in the world. This largely relegated cycling once again to recreational and sports use.

The oil shocks of the 1970s triggered the first of several bicycle resurgences. New bicycles became popular: first, road racing bikes, then BMXs and eventually mountain bikes. By 1990, a survey showed cycling to be the second most popular participation sport in New Zealand. Since then, cycle sales have remained high, averaging over 150,000 per annum.

From January 1994 the wearing of bicycle helmets in New Zealand became mandatory for all ages of people using a bicycle.

<text>Thomas Dybdahl (born 12 April 1979) is a Norwegian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist.

== Background ==
Thomas Dybdahl grew up in Sandnes, Norway. His musical career started off as the guitarist in the band Quadraphonics. The band released one album in 2002 on Oslove Records.

==Career==
Dybdahl released his first single as a solo artist EP, &quot;Bird&quot;, in 2000. His second EP from 2001 was titled &quot;John Wayne&quot;.

Beginning with the release of his first album, &quot;...That Great October Sound&quot;, in 2002, the first part of his &quot;October&quot; series, he received national and even international appreciation for his work. Since then, and especially after the European release in 2004, Dybdahl&#x27;s notability has increased significantly. The mostly positive reviews tout Dybdahl as a new pop wonder comparable to Nick Drake, Jeff Buckley and other solo artists. He received the Spellemannprisen and the Alarm Award for his work.

The release of his next two albums, &quot;Stray Dogs&quot; (European release in 2005) and &quot;One Day You&#x27;ll Dance for Me, New York City&quot;, further increased his standing as a respected artist.

The album &quot;One Day You&#x27;ll Dance for Me, New York City&quot; features the Norwegian philosopher Arne Næss speaking of quality of life, as a sort of interlude.

In 2004, Dybdahl teamed up with artists from the bands Jaga Jazzist and BigBang on the project &quot;The National Bank&quot;, which immediately entered the Norwegian charts with the project&#x27;s self-titled debut album. It was released outside Norway in 2009.

His single &quot;Damn Heart&quot;, written for the Danish movie &quot;En Soap&quot;, was released in 2006 on Copenhagen Records.

In 2007, Dybdahl performed as an opening act in the US for fellow Norwegian artist Sondre Lerche, and in 2011 he opened for Tori Amos during her &quot;Night of Hunters&quot; tour.

On 24 February 2017, his album &quot;The Great Plains&quot; was released. His eighth solo studio album &quot;All These Things&quot; came out at 12 October 2018.

<doc id="1042823" wikidata="Q1228291" url="?curid=1042823" title="Dirty Vegas">
<text>Dirty Vegas are an English house music group initially made up of Ben Harris and Paul Harris (no relation to each other) on instruments and production and Steve Smith on vocals. The group formed in 2001, then broke up in 2005 before reforming in December 2008 to record new material.

They are best known for their international hit single &quot;Days Go By&quot;, which gained mainstream popularity in a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse television commercial, and for remixing songs created by other artists.

==History==
===Early success===
Dirty Vegas&#x27;s debut release was the single &quot;Days Go By.&quot; It originally made the top 30 in 2001, but when reissued in 2002 reached the top 20 in the UK. They released their self-titled debut album in June 2002 and a second album, &quot;One&quot;, in 2004.

The song &quot;Days Go By&quot;, from their eponymous first album, gained wide exposure in the US when it was used in a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse commercial. The song went on to win the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. 

They have remixed songs for artists such as Justin Timberlake and Madonna.

===Present day===
The group played their last concert together in May 2005. After the band&#x27;s breakup, Smith released his first solo album &quot;This Town&quot; on 18 February 2008, on his own G.A.S. Records label. During their hiatus from the public, they began working on the film score for &quot;Boys &amp; Girls Guide To Getting Down&quot;. 

After four years, Paul Harris and Steve Smith decided to reform and returned with their third studio album &quot;Electric Love&quot; in April 2011. In April 2013, the band released the EP &#x27;Let the Night, which reached No.4 in US iTunes Dance Album chart and gained Gold status in Italy. Their fourth and latest studio album, entitled &quot;Photograph&quot;, was released via iTunes in September 2015. &quot;Days Go By&quot; was featured on the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, for the Xbox One, PS4 and PC on the in-game radio. The further enhanced versions of the game on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S retain this song.

===Pop culture===
The band has also appeared on a variety of television shows such as FOX television&#x27;s drama &quot;Standoff&quot;, where &quot;Late Nights and Street Fights&quot; was used as the show&#x27;s theme song, FOX&#x27;s &quot;The O.C.&quot; where &quot;Closer&quot; appeared in episode 32 entitled “The SnO.C.”, and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; where the single &quot;Walk Into The Sun&quot; appeared in episode 214. Dave Chappelle has parodied the Mitsubishi Eclipse television commercial, the song &quot;Never Enough&quot; from &quot;Electric Love (album)&quot; also play on the game Nike+ Kinect Training.

<doc id="1042826" wikidata="Q702504" url="?curid=1042826" title="Those Who Hunt Elves">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yu Yagami. The plot revolves around three travelers, the eponymous &quot;Elf Hunters&quot;, and the elven sorceress Mistress Celcia. The anime was released in North America on VHS and DVD by ADV Films and later re-released by Sentai Filmworks.

On June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed &quot;Those Who Hunt Elves&quot; among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.

==Plot==
Elf Hunters seek five spell fragments that have been placed on the skin of elves, similar to tattoos, throughout the magical world they have been transported to. When they find them, they will be able to return to Japan.

The Elf Hunters travel by means of a Type 74 tank, which has been transported to the magical world with them.

The reaction of various elves as the team attempts to strip them naked is a primary basis for much of the show&#x27;s humor, and are more ridiculous than suggestive. The series is also known for breaking the fourth wall, mostly by Junpei.

==Characters==

===Elf Hunters===
: 
: A 19-year-old karateka and strongman with incredible fighting ability, Junpei is the group&#x27;s muscle of the group as well as being the only male. However, his rather rough way of saying things as well as his eye for beautiful women get him into trouble more often than not. He is constantly arguing with Celcia and obsessed about curry and, briefly, heliocentrism. Junpei abhors fantasy stories and might be atheist or agnostic. He is infatuated with Airi but is clueless to Celcia&#x27;s own feelings for him despite their constant bickering. Junpei carries a wallet filled with membership cards from various dojos, and a condom with the words &quot;Use with Airi Only!&quot; written on the wrapper.
: 
: A 16-year-old high school girl and military otaku. She&#x27;s a tomboy but not to the point where she loses her femininity. She drives and maintains the tank (to which she has a strong attachment) and also acts as a sniper from time to time; she often sets landmines and booby traps. Despite her love of modern military hardware, Ritsuko also displays a more sensitive and innocent side: she falls in love with the cute Pichi and maintained a belief in Father Christmas long after her peers had abandoned it and is also frightened to death of ghosts. Over the course of the manga, she gradually falls in love with Junpei. Ritsuko carries a Howa Type 64 battle rifle, SIG SG 550 assault rifle, SIG P226 and Heckler &amp; Koch USP semiautomatic pistols, G36 assault rifle, PSG1 sniper rifle, a sheath knife, some C4 and a Colt M16A2 assault rifle. She also speaks fluent English and German.
: 
: A 24-year-old talented Japanese-American actress, Airi is as skilled as she is beautiful. Able to cut from one emotion to another in an instant, and even disguise herself as someone else, Airi&#x27;s talents come in handy for getting out of sticky situations that require trickery rather than brute force. Airi also has an ability to quickly and accurately assess any given situation and to plan for its eventual outcome. Although aware of Junpei&#x27;s blatant affections for her, she does not reciprocate (although she does use them to her advantage, for example when getting Junpei to volunteer to be live bait to catch a giant shark by saying &quot;Pretty please&quot;). Airi carries a katana and a make-up compact kit.

: The unfortunate elf who happens to get tied up with her world&#x27;s new visitors, Celcia offers to transport Junpei and the others back with a spell, but gets distracted in the process and causes her spell book pages to be spread out all over the world. She is a bit of a ditz and a bit psychotic and is constantly at odds with Junpei, but she is just as determined to get him and his friends back to their own world as they are – even despite her own feelings for Junpei (who she&#x27;s actually in love with but publicly butts heads with). Generally, she wants them to get back home because they tend to cause a LOT of trouble. During the efforts to retrieve the spell fragments, Celcia displays an uncanny knack for getting stuck in animal form – first as a dog (Pochi), into which she&#x27;d willingly transformed, and secondly into a panda. The reason for her retention of these forms is that it is she who recovers spell fragments from the bodies of other elves, only for them to become cloven to her. Unfortunately, if they become cloven to her while she is in another form, it traps her in that form. Also, some of these marks are rather annoying. One, for instance, is a goofy looking black eye; another gives her a set of whiskers.

: The Type 74 tank is possessed during the show by the spirit of a cat known as Mihke. Mihke is first met by Elf Hunters possessing a giant teddy bear, which is then attacked by villagers, who explain that the spirit has been harassing them for some time. Upon the destruction of the bear, the spirit possesses a toy dog, found floating in a river by Ritsuko, before this too is destroyed.

: A small, white, teddy bear-like interdimensional creature with the ability to produce toilet paper, to whom Ritsuko takes a liking. Pichi ends up proving an incentive for the group, especially due to a plot involving a scarcity of toilet tissue.

===Supporting===
:
:A priestly elf and acolyte of Celcia who often appears during the group&#x27;s adventures. Early in the series, she loses her faith and trust in Celcia for she thought she&#x27;d betrayed the elven race for helping out Those Who Hunt Elves and sought to stop TWHE by using a powerful spell, but ended up opening a portal and bringing more earth-originated material through. Subsequently, she ended up stripped naked and flowing down a river attached to a log. Despite this, she is later seen as a major supporter of Elf Hunters efforts to return to Japan. Probably because this is the best way to stop them.

==Media==

===Manga===
The manga was written and illustrated by Yu Yagami. It was serialized by MediaWorks in the manga magazine &quot;Dengeki Comic Gao!&quot; from June 1995 to March 2003, and collected in 21 bound volumes. It is licensed in English by ADV Manga, with only the first seven volumes published in English in 2004, before the series went on indefinite hiatus. ADV&#x27;s website makes no mention of the series in manga form, so it is unlikely the series will be continued.

===Anime===
Two anime series were created. Both were animated by Group TAC and produced by Amuse, Inc., while the second was also produced by Project E2. Both series were licensed by ADV Films, who released as 4 DVDs. In 2009 Sentai Filmworks released the series in a complete collection set.

<text>The spread eagle is one of the moves in the field in the sport of figure skating, in which a skater glides on both feet, the toes turned out to the sides, heels facing each other. It can be performed on either the inside or outside edges. It is commonly used as an entrance to jumps, adding to the difficulty level of that jump under the Code of Points. It is most commonly used as

<text>The Northern Counties Committee (NCC) was a railway that served the north-east of Ireland. It was built to Irish gauge () but later acquired a number of narrow gauge lines. It had its origins in the Belfast and Ballymena Railway which opened to traffic on 11 April 1848.

The NCC itself was formed on 1 July 1903 as the result of the Midland Railway of England taking over the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway (BNCR), which the Belfast and Ballymena Railway had become. At the 1923 Grouping of British railway companies, the Committee became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). After the nationalisation of Britain&#x27;s railways in 1948 the NCC was briefly part of the British Transport Commission, which sold it to the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) in 1949.

The BNCR and its successors recognised the potential value of tourism and were influential in its development throughout Northern Ireland. They were able to develop and exploit the advantages of the Larne to Stranraer ferry route between Northern Ireland and Scotland which gained importance in World War II.

==Belfast and Ballymena Railway==
===Proposals===
There had been a proposal by the Davison brothers of Ballymena to build a railway between Belfast and Ballymena in 1836 but this came to nothing due, firstly, to the inability to identify a suitable route out of Belfast that did not include excessive gradients and, secondly, an economic downturn.

However, in 1844, the same promoters, in association with Sinclair Mulholland, William Coates and John McNeile of Belfast drew up a new scheme that included a branch to Carrickfergus. Charles Lanyon was employed to carry out preliminary surveys of the proposed route.

In fact, two routes out of Belfast were surveyed. One was an inland route beginning at the Antrim Road and skirting Cavehill. The other started at the junction of York Road and Corporation Street; it ran north on an embankment across slob land on the western shore of Belfast Lough. To ease the gradient, it was necessary for the line to Ballymena to leave the Carrickfergus branch by means of a trailing junction from Belfast. Lanyon strongly favoured this latter coastal route and reported accordingly at a public meeting in Antrim courthouse on 20 May 1844. A motion was carried that a complete survey of the line was to be completed and that costs were to be defrayed by opening a subscription.

A prospectus was issued in September 1844 with an optimistic review of the financial prospects for the undertaking. There was a good response and capital accumulated steadily from both sides of the Irish Sea. By 1848, the Belfast and Ballymena Railway (B&amp;BR) would have 221 shareholders.

===Parliamentary approval===

The next stage was to obtain parliamentary approval for the B&amp;BR&#x27;s original line plus a branch to Randalstown. A bill was duly lodged and came before a committee of the House of Commons in April 1845. Clauses were inserted at the Belfast Harbour Commissioners&#x27; request to protect them from possible competition from the harbour at Carrickfergus. The promoters were able to assuage the committee&#x27;s fears that the works would be heavy and costly and the bill received royal assent on 21 July 1845 as the (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. lxxxi), &quot;An Act for making a Railway from Belfast to Ballymena in the County of Antrim, with Branches to Carrickfergus and Randalstown&quot;.

===Building the line===
Lanyon immediately began preparations for building the line and placed advertisements for tenders for the construction of the railway. The contract was awarded to William Dargan. Orders were placed for rails and sleepers and locomotives were ordered from Bury, Curtis and Kennedy.

Meanwhile, the directors were recruiting staff. A secretary was appointed in 1845, Ellis Rowland was appointed locomotive superintendent in 1847 and Thomas Houseman Higgin became manager in May 1848.

By the spring of 1847, portions of the line were ready for ballasting and, as neither Dargan nor the B&amp;BR had any locomotives, a second-hand engine was obtained from the Ulster Railway to carry out the work. While it had been hoped to open the line in November 1847, this was put back by the need to raise the embankment along the shore of Belfast Lough.

Stations were built along the main line and the Carrickfergus branch. The most impressive was that at Belfast where Lanyon used his architectural talents to create an imposing classical design.

====Board of Trade inspections====
Eventually the line was deemed to be ready for inspection by the Board of Trade on 10 January 1848. Captain Robert Michael Laffan RE carried out the inspection and issued an unfavourable report dated 3 March. He was much concerned that the permanent way was very roughly laid and unballasted in places; neither were there any signals. Furthermore, he deemed that a bridge had been constructed in a hasty manner with the result that, when tested, it exhibited very great deflection. Other defects included poor drainage in cuttings and a lack of mileposts. Captain Laffan&#x27;s opinion was that it was therefore unsafe to allow the line to be opened.

Lanyon and Dargan were keen to retrieve their reputations and there was a period of furious activity as they worked to correct deficiencies identified in the Board of Trade report. The directors carried out their own inspection of the line on 6 April and felt sufficiently confident about what they had seen to ask Captain Laffan to make a second inspection. This he did and his report of 8 April was more encouraging than the previous one. Although there were some strictures, Captain Henry Drury Harness RE, secretary to the Railway Department of the Board of Trade formally advised the directors of the on 14 April that the railway could be opened for public service. However, authorisation had been sent previously by telegraph and the railway was already at work.

===The line opens===
As soon as the Board of Trade&#x27;s telegraphic authority had been received, advertisements were placed in the newspapers on 8 April 1848 to inform the public that the B&amp;BR would be open for passenger traffic on 12 April. Because of the delay in starting operations, it was decided not to have an official opening ceremony. However, two special trains ran on 11 April to give members of the press and potential customers a foretaste of railway travel and the railway was in business.

The normal train service was five trains each way with the Carrickfergus Junction (later renamed Greenisland)-Carrickfergus and Drumsough Junction-Randalstown lines being considered as branches. All main line trains had to reverse at Carrickfergus Junction because of the trailing connection there. This was to be an operating problem for years to come.

Because the goods sheds were still incomplete, it was not possible to run goods trains at first but some articles were accepted for carriage by passenger train.

====Early accounts====
The financial results for the first year of operation were very poor due to depressed passenger traffic during the winter season and because of the Great Famine of Ireland with the result that no dividend was paid. Goods traffic increased once the goods sheds and other facilities had been completed and, in an attempt to obtain additional passenger traffic, the company reduced second and third class fares. However, the financial situation remained unsatisfactory throughout the early years and no dividend would be declared until 1850–51 when it was possible to pay a modest dividend of 1%.

Dividends continued at around 1-1% until November 1855 when they rose to a new peak of 5%. Goods traffic had continued to increase gratifyingly although passenger numbers fluctuated.

===Cookstown extension===
Terminating at a small country town, the Randalstown branch was not generating as much traffic as the directors wished. Therefore, it was decided to extend the line to Cookstown. The act of Parliament for this extension, the (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. lxviii) became law on 28 June 1853. After a delay to acquire land and raise capital, William Dargan was awarded the contract for building the line and began work in March 1855.

The Cookstown extension included two massive engineering features. One was the eight-span masonry bridge which carried the line fifty feet above the River Main just outside Randalstown and the other, a few miles further on, was a lattice bridge with a swing section across the River Bann near its outflow from Lough Neagh. Nevertheless, Dargan was able to carry out the work on the Cookstown extension speedily and the line was deemed to be ready for a Board of Trade inspection on 13 October 1856.

Captain H. W. Tyler RE, the inspecting officer, reported that although there was much that was satisfactory, the presence of an unauthorised level crossing prevented his allowing the line to be opened. Eventually, following correspondence between the directors and the Board of Trade, permission was given to open the line on condition that a bridge replaced the crossing within six months. The line was officially opened on 16 October 1856 but public services did not begin until 10 November. Four trains ran in each direction on weekdays and two on Sundays.

===Excursion traffic===
Cheap travelling facilities were offered from the earliest days of the railway. Special trains were run from Ballymena and intermediate stations in connection with Queen Victoria&#x27;s visit to Belfast in August 1849. Later that year, day excursion tickets were available from Belfast to Randalstown for those who wished to visit Shane&#x27;s Castle demesne at about two-thirds of the cost of normal tickets. Cheap tickets were also available for those travelling to Belfast; in 1857, passengers from Cookstown were being urged to experience the view from Cave Hill.

By 1859, further reductions were available for parties of eight or more travelling to destinations such as Shane&#x27;s Castle, Masserene Park, Toomebridge, Moyola Park, the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Dunluce Castle. As always, the seaside was a popular destination with excursion tickets to Portstewart and Portrush via the neighbouring Belfast, Ballymena, Coleraine and Portrush Junction Railway (BBC&amp;PJR) and valid for seven days being offered at normal single fare rates.

===A lack of capital and a change of name===
The continued to prosper but lacked capital and matters came to a head at when it was reported that the capital was totally expended and borrowing powers had been exceeded by £10,000. It was essential that the company raise additional funds to double the existing single line out of Belfast, as it was no longer adequate for the current volume of traffic and to replace many of the original wooden stations. It was therefore proposed to make a submission to Parliament as soon as possible.
In 1858, with the connivance of the , the neighbouring promoted the (21 &amp; 22 Vict. c. liii) to empower the to purchase the at a future date. The sum required was to be paid for by the issue of new shares. This manoeuvre was aided by the links both companies had with William Dargan.
However, a complication arose when the was granted approval in the (22 Vict. c. xxxi) in April 1859 to build a bridge over the River Bann at Coleraine to connect with the Londonderry and Coleraine Railway. Since this was after the 1858 act, the bridge could not be included in any sale of the . An additional act was promoted to regularise the situation. In addition, this later bill made provision to change the title of the and to alter the dates of the half-yearly meetings.

When the last half-yearly accounts ending in March 1860 were issued, it was possible to declare a dividend of 4%.
With the passage of the (23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. xlvi) on 15 May 1860, the Belfast and Ballymena Railway ceased to exist and the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway (BNCR) took its place.

==Belfast and Northern Counties Railway==

On 15 May 1860 the Belfast and Ballymena Railway became known as the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway (BNCR), a title it would retain until amalgamation with the Midland Railway in 1903.
The following independent railways became part of the after its incorporation (opening date(s)/amalgamation date):
* Ballymena, Ballymoney, Coleraine and Portrush Junction Railway (November 1855/January 1861)
* Londonderry &amp; Coleraine Railway (December 1852 and July 1853/July 1871)
* Ballymena, Cushendall and Red Bay Railway (1875 &amp; 1876/October 1884)
* Ballymena and Larne Railway (August 1877, June &amp; August 1878/July 1889)
* Carrickfergus and Larne Railway (October 1862/July 1890)
* Draperstown Railway (July 1883/July 1895)
* Derry Central Railway () (February 1880/September 1901)
* Portstewart Tramway (June 1882/June 1897)

Edward John Cotton had succeeded Thomas H. Higgin as manager of the in 1857 and continued in this position with the . He would be instrumental in making it the most prosperous railway in Ireland. Berkeley Deane Wise was the Chief Civil Engineer of the from 1888 to 1906. During those 18 years Wise made an immense contribution to the , designing many of its grand stations and tourist attractions.

===Steamer services===
The shortest distance between Great Britain and Ireland is the across the North Channel between Portpatrick in Wigtownshire, Scotland and Donaghadee in County Down. A privately run mail service had started in 1662 which. taken over by the Post Office and then the Admiralty, continued for nearly 200 years. In 1849, problems at both Portpatrick and Donaghadee during severe weather and the difficulty in accommodating larger steamers at Portpatrick caused the termini of the Short Sea Route to be transferred to Stranraer and Larne.

Even before the Carrickfergus &amp; Larne railway (C&amp;LR) had been completed, the was playing a leading role in discussions with other railway companies about operating a steamer service between Larne and Stranraer. The , Glasgow &amp; South Western, Portpatrick, North British and Newcastle &amp; Carlisle Railways formed a joint committee to operate a steamer. It purchased the iron-hulled paddle steamer which made her first sailing in normal service on 2 October 1862. The service was not a success and continuing poor financial results led to its being suspended on 31 December 1863.

Meanwhile, the continued to promote the possibility of a steamer service but with a better ship. Although lacking capital it was able to encourage private investors to set up a new company in 1871. Known as the Larne &amp; Stranraer Steam Boat Company it began operating the PS &quot;Princess Louise&quot; on a daily service from 1 July 1872.

In 1885, the London &amp; North Western, Midland, Caledonian and Glasgow &amp; South Western railways had formed the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway to operate the Portpatrick Railway and to, improve the profitability of the route, bought out the steamship company. A new, faster and larger ship, the &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; entered service in May 1890 and reduced the sea crossing to only 2 hours. The new service was an immediate success and was well patronised by businessmen. Furthermore, the Postmaster General recognised the crossing as a supplementary mail route in addition to Holyhead-Kingstown. Traffic increased by 40% between 1875 and 1885 and in July 1891 an additional ship was put on the service during the summer. The BNCR had subscribed a large sum in 1890 and in July 1893 it was able to join the four railways operating the Portpatrick Joint Railway in the newly created Larne &amp; Stranraer Steamship Joint Committee. Edward John Cotton of the managed the service which continued to be a success.

Once the had absorbed the Ballymena &amp; Larne Railway in 1889 and the Carrickfergus and Larne railway in 1890, it possessed both of the Irish routes leading to the Larne-Stranraer steamer.

===Tourism===
Whilst tourism in Ireland was not a new development, it was in the last quarter of the nineteenth century that a great increase occurred with large numbers of tourists making the sea crossing from Great Britain to see the delights of Ireland&#x27;s scenery. The railways saw that it would be to their advantage to encourage tourist development since this would bring them increased traffic. On the , its manager, Edward John Cotton, especially recognised the potential value of tourism and was influential in its development throughout the North of Ireland.

The was able to exploit the advantages of the Larne-Stranraer short sea route with its benefit of a daylight crossing in the summer months and the ease with which passengers could transfer to trains alongside the steamer berth at Larne Harbour.

====Excursions and special attractions====
The continued the &#x27;s practice of running cheap excursions. Besides excursions organised by the company itself, there were extensive summer programmes of special trains operated on behalf of outside organisations especially Sunday schools and other church organisations. A large number of special trains were chartered by Loyalist organisations around the &quot;Twelfth of July&quot; and the &quot;Twelfth of August&quot;.

G. L. Baillie, the golfing pioneer, organised golfing excursions that included first class train fare and hotel accommodation to Portrush and Newcastle as well as to the County Donegal links at Rosapenna, Portsalon and Lisfannon.

The Giant&#x27;s Causeway became an even greater tourist attraction with the opening of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway, Portrush and Bush Valley Electric Tramway all the way to the Causeway in 1887. Thousands of tourists found the journey from outside Portrush railway station much quicker and easier than before and, being the world&#x27;s first hydro-electric tramway, it was an attraction in itself.

Another of Ulster&#x27;s celebrated tourist attractions is the Antrim Coast Road that stretches north from Larne to Ballycastle and Portrush and from which may be seen the Nine Glens of Antrim. The largest and arguably the most beautiful of these is Glenariff which stretches from Parkmore down to the sea. The opening of the Cushendall line to passengers created whole new possibilities for tourism. The leased Glenariff from the landlords and laid out a series of paths and bridges to make it easily accessible to tourists. Rustic shelters were provided near the water falls to protect visitors from the spray and, in 1891, a &quot;tea house&quot; was built which, as well as providing refreshments, included a dark room for the use of photographers.

Coastal scenery of a different kind may be seen in the Islandmagee area near Whitehead. While there was already some provision for tourists, the &#x27;s civil engineer Berkeley Deane Wise constructed a new promenade and imported sand from Portrush to make a beach. In 1892 he also engineered a cliff path was engineered that stretched 1 miles from Whitehead to the Blackhead promontory. The lower sections bordered the shore but blasting and cantilevering from the cliffs was necessary higher up.

Further north from Whitehead on the eastern coast of Islandmagee is a region of high basalt cliffs known as the Gobbins. Here too, Wise set to work building a path. Steps were cut to connect the various levels, bridges were thrown across ravines including two tubular bridges that connected the &quot;Man o&#x27;War Stack&quot; to the main path. The first section of the path opened in August 1902 but it was to prove too expensive to continue to Heddle&#x27;s Port as originally planned.

====Hotels====
Hotel accommodation in nineteenth century Ireland was not of a generally high standard. While this should have been of concern to the railway companies, few took a direct interest in the matter. The and the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway were exceptions.

The purchased a share in the lease of the long-standing and well thought of Antrim Arms hotel at Portrush and in 1883 formed a separate company to manage what was renamed the Northern Counties Hotel. Situated on an elevated site, the hotel overlooked the Atlantic Ocean at front and back. With more than one hundred rooms, it was intended to accommodate high-class tourists visiting the Giant&#x27;s Causeway. The hotel was enlarged and improved in 1884 and 1892 and in 1902 the purchased the freehold outright from the Earl of Antrim.

A new hotel was built in Belfast as part of the York Road station reconstruction with the intention of capturing trade from long-distance travellers as it was convenient to the cross-channel steamer berths. Designed by Berkeley Dean Wise and directly connected to the station, the unimaginatively named Station Hotel opened in 1898.

In addition to the railway-operated hotels, arrangements were made during the 1890s with the independent Olderfleet hotel in Larne and the Antrim Arms and Marine hotels in Ballycastle for the issue of combined railway and hotel tickets.

====The Holden train====
The Holden train was a new concept in Irish tourism. In 1902, A. W. Holden, a Larne hotelier who had hired trains from the for his summer tours, approached the railway to provide him with a special train. York Road works built the all first class four-car train. Three of the coaches were saloons and the fourth was a restaurant car, all being furnished to a high standard. They were bogie vehicles with corridor connections; the lower body panels were finished in match boarding and the end doors were recessed in the manner of Pullman cars. Two six-wheel vans were fitted with corridor connections to work with the train.

The train entered service in 1903 shortly before the end of the &#x27;s independent career. Based at the Laharna Hotel, Larne, Holden&#x27;s tour visited most of the popular tourist attractions in north-eastern Ireland over a six-day period. During this time, it covered some of railway travel and a further by road. The tours ran until the outbreak of World War I.

===Accidents===
The early years of the company were relatively free from serious incidents but as traffic increased and the system became busier, weaknesses in less than adequate operating procedures were exposed and a number of accidents occurred. Board of Trade inspectors investigated these and reported on the causes and recommended appropriate corrective actions.

The injury rates were low but sadly there were some fatalities which are mentioned in the list below.

* 9 February 1863. The coupling between two carriages of a Ballymena to Belfast train broke and a first class coach fell on it side but fortunately did not drag other vehicles with it. Two passengers were injured.
* 3 April 1863. A pointsman at Coleraine turned a down train into the up loop where it collided with engine of an up train
* 2 October 1876. A stopping train from Belfast to Ballymena derailed on a crossover at Cookstown Junction. Major General C.S. Hutchinson RE investigated the accident and blamed the system of wire interlocking in use at the junction.
* 26 December 1876. The 08.35 Coleraine to Belfast passenger train and 08.15 down goods collided head-on at Moylena near Antrim. One passenger was killed and eight others were injured. Colonel Frederick Rich RE investigated and, finding fault with the company&#x27;s method of working the single line by the fixed timetable system, recommended adopting the train staff system until the line was doubled.
* 23 December 1878. Wagons ran away while a mixed train was shunting at Duncrue siding near Carrickfergus.
* 28 September 1887. An up train derailed just on the Londonderry side of the Bann Bridge at Coleraine. During his investigation, Colonel Rich found that the track was old and the ballast to be of poor quality. He commented on the lack of timber baulks on the bridge itself that would prevent a derailed train from falling in the river and also criticised the signalling arrangements at the bridge which the company revised shortly afterwards.
* 27 February 1892. A ballast train from Limavady ran into the back of the 07.00 Londonderry to Belfast passenger train at Castlerock. There were no injuries. Major General Hutchinson found fault with personnel at Downhill and Castlerock for signalling irregularities. The passenger train had been running late due to poor steaming because the brick arch in its firebox had collapsed some days previously and General Hutchinson censured the driver for not reporting the collapse.
* 25 August 1894. A stopping train from Larne Harbour to Belfast derailed on a section of track that was being relaid shortly after leaving Whitehead. A speed restriction should have been imposed but the permanent way gang carrying out the work had failed to post warning signs and had left the track in a dangerous condition. Fortunately the derailed vehicles remained upright as they passed through Whitehead tunnel otherwise the consequences could have been much more serious.
* 7 August 1897. The firebox collapsed on 2-4-0 locomotive No.58, killing both locomotive men on the approach to Antrim station. Major F.A. Marindin RE found that the procedure for inspecting locomotive boilers was inadequate and a more rigorous regime was put in place.
* 13 July 1898. The 09.55 Belfast to Larne passenger train overran signals at Larne Town station and collided with a train of empty coaches causing extensive damage to both trains. Lieutenant Colonel George Addison RE found that lapses routinely occurred in working the block system and signals. Shortly afterwards, Larne Town station was completely resignalled and the Larne Town-Larne Harbour section was equipped with tablet instruments.
* 10 October 1900. The 16.00 train from Kilrea to Coleraine was completely derailed a little over a mile to the south of Coleraine station but fortunately there were no injuries. Major J.W. Pringle RE determined that the cause was excessive speed over old iron rails aggravated by the rigidity of the double-framed locomotive, No.22. The completion of the track relaying programme was put in hand immediately.
* 25 September 1902. A special troop train from Ballincollig, County Cork to Larne Harbour became divided. The detached rear portion subsequently collided with that in front between Greenisland and Trooperslane. Four vehicles were destroyed and many others damaged; three cavalry horses were killed but there were no other injuries. Major Pringle felt that the locomotive crew had not been sufficiently vigilant in keeping a proper lookout. Furthermore, he censured the Great Southern and Western Railway, the GNR(I) and the , over whose metals the train had run, for treating it as goods or cattle and marshalling the passenger vehicles behind the non-braked cattle wagons with the result that the vacuum brake was not in operation throughout the train.

===Amalgamation===
The Midland Railway had invested heavily in new harbour facilities at Heysham and was anxious that its influence in Ulster would not end at Donegall Quay in Belfast. To extend its activity in Ireland it decided to purchase an interest in a large Irish railway. The was an efficient, prosperous company and well suited the Midland&#x27;s purposes; it connected the two largest cities in the north of Ireland and had direct links to County Donegal. The Midland made a very tempting offer which the &#x27;s directors advised the shareholders to accept. This was also agreed by the Midland&#x27;s shareholders.
The date of vesting was set for 1 July 1903 and on 21 July 1903, the act of Parliament necessary for amalgamation passed into law as the (3 Edw. 7. c. cxxvii). Thus ended the separate existence of the railway that was affectionately nicknamed &quot;Big Nancy Coming Running&quot;. Henceforth, the would be known as the Midland Railway (Northern Counties Committee).

==Midland Railway (Northern Counties Committee)==
The amalgamation of the BNCR with the Midland Railway took place on 1 July 1903. The railway retained a great deal of autonomy and was run by a management committee based in Belfast – the Northern Counties Committee (NCC). Locomotive and rolling stock liveries remained very much as they had been under the BNCR except for the adoption of the Midland Railway coat of arms and NCC monogram.

The following railways became part of the MR(NCC) (opening date(s)/amalgamation date):
* County Donegal Railways Joint Committee Londonderry and Strabane section, formerly part of the narrow gauge Donegal Railway () was vested in the MR (NCC) in May 1906.
* Limavady and Dungiven Railway () (July 1883/February 1907).

Total mileage in 1911 was 

Two steam railmotors were obtained from Derby and entered service in 1905. Originally proposed for Belfast suburban services, the traffic department put them to work on Belfast-Ballymena stopping services. Hauling vans and horseboxes, they soon became worn out and were withdrawn in 1913.

Meanwhile, valuable iron ore traffic was obtained in 1907. Iron ore had been transported by road from the mines near Parkmore to Waterfoot for shipment but the poor condition of the roads was making this impossible. The traffic was put on rail via Ballymena to Larne Harbour, 100 new wagons and two new locomotives were built to handle the 35 000 tons of ore that was to be transported annually.

The NCC purchased two Thornycroft motor char-a-bancs in 1905 and hired a third for at least one season. One was used to take guests at the Northern Counties Hotel on trips to the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and other tourist attractions while the second provided a service between Parkmore, Glenariff Glen and Cushendall. The hired vehicle was used on tours of the Antrim Coast Road.

===Statistics – 1910===
* In 1910 the Committee owned 79 locomotives; 364 passenger train vehicles; two railmotor cars; and 2328 goods vehicles
* Locomotives were painted &quot;invisible green&quot; (a very dark bronze green that looked almost black) picked out with yellow, blue and vermilion lining; passenger rolling stock, lake, picked out with gold and vermilion lining.
* The Portstewart Tramway owned 3 locomotives and four other vehicles
* The Committee owned three hotels: Midland Station Hotel, Belfast; Northern Counties Hotel, Portrush; and Laharna Hotel, Larne

===Tourism===
The NCC continued the BNCR&#x27;s policy of encouraging tourism.

The Belfast hotel, now known as the Midland Station Hotel continued to prosper and additional bedrooms were added in 1905. In 1906 additional accommodation was added to the rear of the Northern Counties Hotel at Portrush. The work increased the number of rooms to 150 and provided a splendid new ballroom. The NCC acquired a third hotel, the Laharna Hotel at Larne, from the Holden company in 1909 and with it the Holden train.

Glenariff continued to be a popular tourist destination and Sunday trains were run on the Cushendall line during summer to meet public demand.
The Gobbins cliff path on Islandmagee had not been completed in BNCR days. While it had been intended to carry the path to Heddle&#x27;s Port, the engineering and other construction works this would entail were considered to be too expensive. Instead a final extension of the path only as far as the Seven Sisters caves opened in 1908.

===Steamer services===
The Larne-Stranraer steamer service continued to prosper. A new steamer, the &quot;Princess Maud&quot;, was delivered in May 1904. She was the first turbine steamer to operate on any of the cross-channel services on the Irish Sea. A further steamer arrived in 1912. The &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; was broadly similar to the &quot;Maud&quot; but with more powerful engines and improved passenger accommodation.

Meanwhile, the Midland Railway&#x27;s Heysham-Belfast service began operations in September 1904 with three new ships, , &quot;Donegal&quot; and . The NCC was less involved in this route than that to Stranraer but managed the facilities at the Donegall Quay berth in Belfast and provided booking facilities both in Belfast and through booking from its stations.

===World War I===
The NCC was relatively unaffected by the events of World War I. Most cross-channel traffic was carried on the principal Kingstown-Holyhead route.

Conscription was never applied in Ireland but 318 of the NCC&#x27;s employees enlisted in the armed forces of whom 60 were to be killed during the hostilities.

In September 1914 the NCC undertook to build seventy road transport wagons at York Road for the War Department and in October 1915 subcontracted work on munitions for Workman Clark &amp; Co.

The war created severe shortages of permanent way materials and a number of little used sidings were lifted for the materials they yielded. It was also necessary to resort to using sleepers made from home-grown timber rather than the imported Baltic variety. Steel boiler tubes replaced copper and brass in locomotives for economy and a different pattern of uniform overcoat had to be sourced since the government had commandeered the wool crop.

Greencastle, the first station out of Belfast, closed in June 1916 because of competition from the extended Belfast tramways.

The NCC along with other Irish railways adopted Greenwich Mean Time in October 1916. This was 25 minutes ahead of Dublin or Irish time which had previously been used throughout Ireland.

The Belfast and Portrush hotels continued to function fairly normally although they had lost their French and German employees at the outbreak of war. The Laharna, on the other hand, was suffering from a shortage of tourists and was requisitioned by the army in 1917.

The steamer services were affected by the war. The &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; was requisitioned as a troop ship leaving the &quot;Princess Maud&quot; to operate the Larne-Stranraer mail service which was sometimes the only crossing available due to enemy submarine activity in the Irish Sea. The &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; returned to cross-channel service in 1920. The Heysham service was suspended in the latter part of the war and the steamer &quot;SS Donegal&quot; was sunk while on war service in 1917.

====Government control====
The railways in Great Britain had come under government control from the outbreak of war but those in Ireland had not. The trades unions believed that under control their members would achieve parity in wartime bonuses with cross-channel railwaymen and applied constant pressure to achieve this. Frustrated with a lack of progress the unions threatened to strike in December 1916 which prompted the government to agree to taking control of the Irish lines. On 22 December 1916 they came under Board of Trade supervision which acted through the Irish Railways Executive Committee (IREC).

The government paid compensation to the railways to bring their net yearly receipts up to those of 1913 subject to limitations on capital expenditure. The NCC had already been affected by virtue of its Midland Railway parent having been under control since 1914. The cost of war bonuses was also met by the government.

The tremendous consumption of coal by industry meant that less was available for Ireland and in March 1918 the Board of Trade ordered the Irish railways to cut their consumption by 20%. The NCC maintained its goods mileage but reduced passenger working by a quarter.

Control did not end with the Armistice in 1918. The IREC enforced the eight-hour day for railwaymen starting in January 1919. This resulted in the NCC having to employ an additional 158 men in the traffic department.

The newly created Ministry of Transport assumed the powers of the IREC which ceased to function on 31 December 1919. Negotiations between the railways and the ministry for de-control and compensation continued throughout 1920 and early 1921 and governmental supervision came to an end on 15 August 1921.

===The troubles===
There was widespread political unrest in Ireland during the 1920s. The railways were prime targets although the NCC did not suffer as seriously as other lines. On 25 March 1921, wooden buildings at Crossroads, Cargan, Parkmore and Retreat on the Cushendall line were set on fire and completely destroyed. The same night the signal cabins at Killagan and Dunloy on the main line were destroyed by fire while that at Glarryford suffered minor damage.

Two trains that were crossing at Staffordstown on 29 June 1921 were held up by armed men who robbed mailbags. In a similar incident armed men stopped a train from Parkmore near Martinstown and again rifled mailbags.

On 3 May 1922 an attempt was made to set fire to coaches stabled at Limavady but was foiled by the prompt action of staff. A more serious arson attack on 19 May destroyed part of Ballymena station.

The only recorded attempt to damage the track itself was on 19 May when a bridge between Killagan and Dunloy was damaged by explosives. Repairs took four days during which time passengers had to pass the gap on foot.

Sadly two members of staff were murdered in Belfast. The first incident took place on the night of 14 April 1922 when a driver was shot near the engine shed and in the other a ganger was killed in broad daylight on 22 May. One other casualty was a police constable who was hit by a train while guarding Randalstown viaduct.

===Changed conditions===
The railways had regained control of their own finances in August 1921 and were again dependent on their own resources. However, a large number of former military lorries had come on to the second hand market and, with no system of licensing in place, anyone who wished could set up as a common carrier. In August 1921, James Cowie, the NCC&#x27;s manager, estimated that 50 000 tons of goods traffic was being lost annually.

Ireland had been partitioned in 1921 and in May 1922 the newly created Northern Ireland government set up a commission to enquire into the railways operating in Northern Ireland. The majority report recommended continuing the existing system of private management but recommended several economies such as common use of wagons and plant. The minority report recommended nationalisation.

The unsatisfactory financial condition of all the companies was noted with only the NCC considered to be in a strong position by virtue with its British connections even though it receipts were markedly reduced. The committee recommended that the struggling Ballycastle Railway should be amalgamated with the NCC. The government took no action, being preoccupied with other matters.

Between 1913 and 1922 there had been a 26% reduction in passenger traffic and 25% less goods traffic. Receipts had increased by nearly 60% but working expenditure has risen by an alarming 112% and the necessity for economy was to become a dominant factor in operating the railway.

==London, Midland and Scottish Railway (Northern Counties Committee)==

The Midland Railway, and with it the NCC, was grouped by the Railways Act 1921 into the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923. On grouping, it was recorded as having of Irish broad gauge and of narrow gauge track. The LMS started painting NCC locomotives and carriages into crimson lake (also known as Midland red).

A new railway bridge over the River Bann at Coleraine was opened in March 1924. It had been built to replace an older bridge dating from 1860. The construction of this bridge was carried out to the design and largely under the supervision of Bowman Malcolm. The opening span was the first application of the Strauss underhung bascule principle in the United Kingdom.

The NCC took over the operation of the narrow gauge Ballycastle Railway in August 1924, completing its acquisition of the line in June 1925. This brought the NCC up to its maximum route mileage of .

The first line closure took place when the Portstewart Tramway ceased operating on 31 January 1926 due to continuing losses, deferred maintenance and obsolete equipment. The NCC sponsored a replacement bus service.

York Road station, Belfast was resignalled with colour light signalling. The installation, which was brought into use in 1926, was the first of its kind in Ireland and among the earliest large installations in the United Kingdom.

During the 1920s, the railways began to face increasing competition from road transport operators. The NCC responded by taking over competing bus services and running its own bus network.

===Statistics – 1932===
* In 1932 the Committee owned 73 locomotives, of which 14 were tank engines; 190 passenger carriages; 150 other coaching vehicles and 2389 goods vehicles.
* The company&#x27;s locomotives ran a total of 1 941 407 engine miles of which 1 213 336 were loaded train miles.
* Carried 2 682 291 passengers; 99 053 head of livestock and 549 087 tons of goods traffic.
* The Committee owned 115 buses and 36 goods and parcels road vehicles.
* The Committee owned the Midland Station Hotel, Belfast; Northern Counties Hotel, Portrush; and the Laharna Hotel, Larne

===Developments in the 1930s===
Although the NCC had dealt with the issue of competing passenger road transport by running its own bus services, competition from unregistered road freight operators remained a problem.

A number of innovations were introduced during the 1930s with the intention of bringing about greater economies or improving services to retain existing customers and attract new ones.

On the single line sections of the Main Line north-west of Ballymena and on the Larne Line north of Whitehead, crossing loops were relaid in the 1930s to provide one completely straight or &quot;fast&quot; line to allow the passage of express trains at high speed in both directions.

==== Greenisland Loop Line ====
It had long been recognised that the need for Main Line trains to reverse at Greenisland was undesirable. Various plans for a direct line bypassing Greenisland had been proposed over the years but the engineering problems faced by having to cross Valentine&#x27;s Glen near Whiteabbey and surmount Mossley Col had precluded these. However, construction started on such a scheme on 1 January 1931.

This involved creating a new junction at Bleach Green where the Larne and Loop Lines diverged. The former main line from Greenisland Junction was singled and joined the new Main Line at a new connection, Mossley Junction, to the east of Mossley station. The old main line became known as the &quot;Back Line&quot;. The ruling gradient on the Loop Line was 1 in 75 which could only be achieved by excavating and lowering a section of the existing Main Line near Mossley station. The new lines were carried over Valentine&#x27;s Glen on imposing ferro-concrete viaducts. The smaller of these curved to the east from Bleach Green Junction as a burrowing junction passing under a skew span of the larger Main Line viaduct which curved westwards. The old masonry Main Line viaduct was retained to carry what had become the up Larne Line.

A strike by Irish locomotive men in 1933 delayed completion and it was not until 22 January 1934 that the new lines opened for regular service.

Part of the programme included resignalling the lines between Belfast, Greenisland and Mossley Junction with automatic colourlight signals. A new signal cabin was built at Greenisland to control train movements over the triangle formed by the Loop Line, Larne Line and the Back Line.

Although the distance covered by the Loop Line was only two miles less than by the old route, eliminating the reversal at Greenisland saved as much as fifteen minutes allowing services to be accelerated. Some up Main Line trains were divided at Ballyclare Junction with coaches for Larne Harbour being detached and worked over the Back Line to Greenisland while the main part of the train continued to Belfast.

====North Atlantic Express====
Given the opportunity for accelerating services provided by the opening of the Greenisland Loop Lines and the availability of the new powerful Class W 2-6-0 locomotives, a new express service known as the &quot;North Atlantic Express&quot; was introduced between Portrush on the north coast of County Antrim and Belfast.

The &quot;North Atlantic Express&quot; began operation on 1 June 1934 and was intended to exploit the market in prestigious long-distance commuter traffic. A set of three luxurious new coaches with large picture windows, including a buffet car, was built for the service.

Initially, 80 minutes was allowed for the journey with a stop of one minute at Ballymena but this was progressively reduced to 73 minutes by 1938. Slick working was needed as slightly more than half of the route was single track. For the first time on the NCC a start-to-stop booking of was required as only 31 minutes were allowed for the from Ballymena to Belfast.

Two further coaches were built for the &quot;North Atlantic Express&quot; in 1935 and on arrival at Belfast in the morning the set was speedily attached to the Larne Harbour boat train to provide a through Portrush to Larne service.

The &quot;North Atlantic Express&quot; was discontinued on the outbreak of World War Two although the coaches would be used on prestige services in the immediate post-war years.

====Railcars====
Four railcars entered service on the NCC&#x27;s lines between 1933 and 1938. They were all double-ended single units with underfloor engines and running on two four-wheel bogies.

The first of these, No.1, was long and seated 61 passengers. It had a traditionally constructed wooden body and was powered by two Leyland petrol engines with hydraulic transmission in the form of Lysholm-Smith torque converters. No.1 was re-engined with Leyland diesels in 1947 and again in 1959.

The next car, No.2, introduced in 1934, was to a radically different design. An ungainly looking machine, it had a long, slab-sided lightweight body that was to prove problematic. To eliminate the need to run round its trailer at termini, it was equipped with an elevated driving position at each end (similar to some French railcars) so that the driver could see over the top of a trailer that was being propelled. No.2 could seat 75 third class and five first class passengers and was powered by two Leyland Diesel engines with a similar transmission to No.1. No.2&#x27;s looks were improved somewhat when the raised drivers&#x27; cabs were removed during its NCC service.

Railcars Nos.3 and 4 were built in 1935 and 1938 respectively and were virtually identical. Like No.2, they were long with elevated driving positions but there the similarity ended as the cars had &quot;air smoothed&quot; bodywork. Each seating 80 passengers, they too were powered by two Leyland Diesel engines with hydraulic transmission.

In 1934, two railcar trailers emerged from York Road works. Of light weight construction, they weighed only 17 tons (17 tonne) but each could seat 100 passengers. They had a low roof profile so that the railcar driver in his elevated cab could more easily see ahead when propelling them. Elderly former BNCR Class I1 bogie brake tricomposite coaches dating from the 1890s supplemented the purpose-built trailers and provided an interesting contrast between the latest technology and Victorian design.

Besides pulling their trailers, the railcars could also be seen hauling 4-wheel vans. With top speeds of around , the railcars were not restricted to branch lines but could also work stopping trains on the main lines.

Railcar No.2 was withdrawn in 1954 and No.3 was destroyed by fire in 1957 but the remaining two cars were to continue in service until the mid-1960s.

=== Pole report and the NIRTB ===

The railways continued to lose business to unlicensed, &quot;pirate&quot; road freight operators and in 1932, the BCDR, GNR(I) and NCC formally asked the government to create a monopoly covering road transport throughout Northern Ireland. Sir Felix Pole, a former manager of the Great Western Railway, was appointed to investigate the road transport situation. After taking evidence from a wide range of interests, such as the railways, road transport operators, transport users and trades unions, his report was published in July 1934. Pole recommended that a board be set up to control all bus and lorry operations which would co-operate and co-ordinate its activities with the railways.

The government accepted these proposals and, on 1 October 1935, the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board (NIRTB) came into being and absorbed buses and coaches from the three railway companies. The NCC handed over 131 buses and 56 lorries together with operating and maintenance staff, the Smithfield bus station in Belfast and other facilities. A joint NCC/NIRTB passenger timetable was issued from 1 October and it was arranged that the NIRTB could continue to use the former NCC bus and lorry facilities at railway stations. However, the hoped for co-operation between road and rail failed to materialise and the new board appeared to be only interested in co-ordinating road transport to better compete with the railways. There were complaints from the public that the NIRTB&#x27;s rates were higher and its services poorer than those previously provided.

In response to demands from the railways and other interested parties, the government set up two enquiries into the road transport situation. A committee headed by Sir William McClintock made a wide-ranging and complex investigation into the financial and organisational structure while a commission of His Honour Herbert Thompson KC specifically investigated rates and fares. The scope of these reports overlapped to some extent and they were published together in late 1938.

The McClintock report ascertained that there was organised competition on the part of the NIRTB against the railways&#x27; freight services. It recommended abolishing the NIRTB and setting up a single authority to control road transport, the NCC and the BCDR (the GNR(I) was excluded because of its international nature). A select committee of both Houses of the Northern Ireland Parliament was appointed to review the reports. It completed its deliberations in mid 1939 and recommended that the Government should compel the NIRTB and the railways to co-ordinate their services. The political climate in the late summer of 1939 was, however, such that no action would be taken and the unsatisfactory transport situation continued.

===World War II===

Following the declaration of war on 3 September 1939, &quot;Emergency Time Table &#x27;A&quot;&#x27; was introduced. Services were cut back to reduce train mileage and decelerated so that the running speed of many trains did not exceed . However, the speed limit was not rigidly enforced and subsequent issues of the time table progressively expanded the service. A regular routine was established which lasted until the air raids in 1941.

During 1940 two ambulance trains were prepared for emergencies. For each train the LMS provided three regauged coaches and the NCC and GNR(I) each supplied four vehicles. Initially both were stationed at Whitehead but one was later moved to the GNR(I). The ambulance trains were little used and returned to railway ownership in 1944. At the same time, the War Department converted a number of GNR(I) wagons into diesel-engined armoured trolleys. Disguised as cement wagons, they were initially stationed at Whitehead and later Magherafelt.

Unlike the situation in World War I, government control was not imposed on the railways of Northern Ireland during World War II.

NCC trains covered almost twelve million miles during the six years of war.

====The Blitz====
The Luftwaffe attacked Belfast three times in 1941. The first air raid was on the night of 7/8 April. Although some doors and windows were blown out, little damage was done to NCC installations. An attack in greater force on the night of 15/16 April was a much more serious affair. York Road station was hit, the facade suffering considerable damage. The general stores department and various offices were burned out.

The last air raid was on 4 May and concentrated on the docks and shipyard. The NCC suffered severe damage because of its closeness to the docks and York Road station was made unusable. Almost all the remaining station offices, its overall roof and the Midland Hotel were gutted by fire. Both the inwards and outwards goods sheds were destroyed and the works section extensively damaged with several workshops completely burned out and a consequent loss of stores and equipment. Bombs also cut the running lines in two places between York Road and Whitehouse.

Unfortunately, manning problems meant that it had not been possible to evacuate rolling stock to other locations as planned and several trains were caught in the air raid. Twenty coaches were destroyed along with more than 250 wagons representing heavy losses of 10% and 15% of total stock respectively. Despite the surrounding destruction, however, the locomotive sheds and the signal cabin remained undamaged.

Temporary passenger termini were set up at Whitehouse and Whiteabbey with shuttle bus services to the city operated by the NIRTB. Goods services were transferred to the GNR(I) Grosvenor Road goods yard. Meanwhile, the Civil Engineer&#x27;s staff and military personnel worked to clear debris and demolish dangerous structures at York Road. The station reopened to passengers on 8 May and shortly afterwards it was possible to accept goods traffic.

The loss of rolling stock imposed severe constraints on the NCC&#x27;s ability to maintain its services. The LMS provided twenty ex-Midland Railway coaches that were no longer included in its capital stock and these were regauged in Belfast. Meanwhile, arrangements were made for the Great Southern Railways (GSR) and GNR(I) to build and repair 250 wagons.

====Military traffic====
The first special trains carrying soldiers ran on 27 September 1939 when two trains carried a Belfast territorial battalion from a camp in Portstewart.

The NCC served both of Northern Ireland&#x27;s most important harbours, Belfast and Larne, during the war. From the beginning Larne-Stranraer was the principal route used by military personnel; the Irish state remained neutral and the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route was not available. Various territorial units were transferred from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. At first each movement numbered less than 400 personnel but this soon increased to over 1 000 which required multiple special trains and additional steamer sailings.

The first significant move into Northern Ireland was in late 1939 when 2 700 men of the British 158th Infantry Brigade were sent to various destinations. Although there were logistical problems on this occasion, valuable lessons were learned. The buildup of troops in Northern Ireland for training continued and with it came the need to arrange for leave traffic. Few special trains were required at first but in July 1940, an extra steamer sailing was put on from Larne Harbour and additional trains were run from Londonderry and Belfast to connect with it. By 1941, the reverse working from Larne Harbour required a train of up to seventeen coaches.

The first United States troops to land in the United Kingdom in World War II disembarked at Belfast on 26 January 1942. Although some were billeted in Belfast the majority were bound for other destinations. The NCC provided seven special trains and was thus the first railway in World War II to transport American troops in Europe. There were many more such arrivals over the following two years. The need for leave trains decreased considerably as the continued influx of Americans displaced their British counterparts and had almost ceased by mid-1943.

The training programmes for British and American troops involved battle exercises for which heavy military vehicles had to be transported. The NCC converted existing rolling stock to provide 61 end-loading wagons.

Having completed their training, the United States&#x27; forces began leaving Northern Ireland in the spring of 1944 in readiness for the Normandy Landings. The NCC worked hard to ensure that each train arrived in Belfast on time so that the troopships could sail with a minimum of delay. Once the invasion of Europe was underway the number of troops in Northern Ireland decreased rapidly and with them the special problems they had created for the NCC.

Londonderry became an important naval base supporting the Battle of the Atlantic and a large traffic in personnel and &quot;materiel&quot; developed. At its peak in April 1943 some 20 500 men travelled to Londonderry. The facilities at Londonderry were inconvenient and rapidly became inadequate to cope with the buildup in naval activity; in late 1941 the Royal Navy started work on an additional base with extensive jetties at Lisahally about from Londonderry. The NCC already had a siding at this location and a new signal cabin and crossing loop were installed. Lisahally base was much used by allied navies during the Battle of the Atlantic and at the end of the war as a berth for captured German U-boats.

Some movements of prisoners of war (POW) took place, mostly of captured submarine crews, who were transported by train from Londonderry to Belfast en route to internment at Holywood. Later, vacated army camps were used as POW centres, those on the NCC being near Dunloy and Cookstown.

====Civilian traffic====
Civilian passenger journeys increased rapidly from the start of the war, partly because of evacuation from Belfast and the petrol restrictions which made the railway the only available means of transport. This was particularly so after the 1941 Blitz when many people fled to the countryside.

The following table shows the number of passenger journeys for each of the six years of war, when a total of nearly 45 million passengers were carried, with those for 1937 included for comparison.

The passenger train service was greatly changed with only a few old-established trains remaining. War work increased traffic during the morning and afternoon peaks on the Larne line requiring additional trains and even affected services on the main line as far as Cullybackey.

The boat train services were completely altered due to the upsurge in steamer traffic. The pre-war through coaches that had provided a Londonderry-Larne Harbour service via Belfast were replaced by a direct service of up and down trains routed along the Back Line from Monkstown Junction to Greenisland.

Before the war most of the military works had been centred on Belfast but now workmen had to travel all over the system, especially between Coleraine and Londonderry where several airfields were being constructed. Further services were operated between Coleraine and Aghadowey and from Cullybackey and Randalstown to Aldergrove for airfield construction and from Belfast and Cullybackey to the Royal Naval torpedo factory at Antrim. The long closed halt at Barn near Carrickfergus reopened in 1942 to serve nearby mills producing parachutes.

There was one unusual occurrence of a station having to close because of excessive demand. The tiny halt at Eden between Carrickfergus and Kilroot had platforms that were barely one coach long yet about one hundred passengers were forcing themselves on to it at the morning peak. There was a danger that some would be swept off by non-stop trains and the halt was closed. Later, Eden was reopened for some off peak services.

====Freight====
There was a significant upsurge in freight traffic. The following table shows the tonnages of traffic moved by freight trains in the years between 1938 and 1945.
Five new classes of freight traffic contributed to this increase:
*Government stores for the Royal Navy, War Department and Royal Air Force depots;
*Construction materials for airfields, etc.;
*Traffic dispersed for safe storage away from Belfast;
*Development of materials not used in peacetime;
*Traffic directed from road to rail because of petrol rationing.

Northern Ireland&#x27;s strategic importance led to an increase in the number of airfields from three to twenty one. This massive construction programme required huge quantities of stone, cement and general building materials. The NCC&#x27;s ballast quarry at Ballyboyland and others at Portrush and Coleraine supplied the majority of the stone needed for the airfields in the NCC&#x27;s area. Cement came by rail from the British Portland Cement Manufacturers&#x27; works at Magheramorne and via the GNR(I) from Drogheda in County Louth.

Additional military supply depots were built near NCC lines at Ballyclare, Lismoney near Magherafelt and at Desertmartin on the Draperstown branch. There were petrol depots at Randalstown and Limavady all of which generated a great deal of traffic. Ammunition generally came into Northern Ireland through the harbours at Coleraine and Warrenpoint and was forwarded by rail to depots at Antrim and Dungiven.

===Post-war era===
Large-scale troop movements and additional passenger and freight traffic had ensured the NCC&#x27;s prosperity during World War II. The ending of hostilities, however, saw passenger and goods traffic receipts decline rapidly as fuel for road transport became available.

Despite the worsening financial situation, the NCC introduced a number of measures in an attempt to improve the railway&#x27;s competitive position. Services were accelerated and, although the poor condition of the track due to deferred maintenance meant that it was not possible to attain pre-war timings, strenuous efforts were made to ensure that trains adhered to the published schedules.

In 1944 the NCC had decided that its system should be worked by tank engines and placed an initial order for four locomotives to be built at Derby and erected in Belfast. The first of these WT Class 2-6-4 tank locomotives were delivered in the late summer of 1946. Additional orders followed and by the end of 1947 ten engines were in service. Passenger rolling stock was augmented by eight elderly ex-Midland Railway coaches from the LMS which were refurbished in Belfast and fitted with salvaged gauge bogies.

A start was made on restoring the permanent way and air-raid damage at York Road station was repaired.

The company&#x27;s hotels, which had closed during the war years, were reopened to the public by mid-1947 although the Midland Station Hotel in Belfast, which had suffered severe damage during the 1941 Blitz, was not fully operational. Paths and bridges at Glenariff were repaired but the Gobbins cliff path, on which maintenance had ceased in 1942, would not reopen under NCC management.

The Northern Ireland Government resumed its deliberations into the transport situation that had been postponed during the war. It published a White Paper in 1946 that proposed the amalgamation of the BCDR, the NCC and the NIRTB, together with that portion of the GNR(I) which lay in Northern Ireland, into a single organisation to be known as the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA). In the event, however, the GNR(I) was to be excluded from the provisions of The Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1948 (c. 16 (N.I.)) and when the UTA came into existence on 1 April 1948, only the BCDR and the NIRTB would be absorbed at first; the NCC&#x27;s British connection meant that there was a delay in its acquisition by the new organisation.

==Nationalisation, centenary and sale==
On 1 January 1948, the LMS was nationalised and passed to the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission. The NCC became known as the Railway Executive (NCC) and was operationally part of the London Midland Region of British Railways.
The NCC celebrated the centenary of the opening of the Belfast and Ballymena Railway on 11 April 1948 with a minor flourish. An illustrated booklet was printed and distributed to customers and staff. It included a chronology of the NCC and its predecessors, a history of the steamer services, a route description of the Main Line and a map of the system. The BBC Northern Ireland Home Service broadcast a centenary programme on 12 April; it was narrated by John D. Stewart, the writer and dramatist.

Under the provisions of the Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1948 (c. 16 (N.I.)), the Northern Ireland Government purchased the NCC in 1949 for £2,668,000, and the NCC became part of the Ulster Transport Authority from 1 April 1949.

Today (2007) the former NCC main line from Belfast to Derry~Londonderry, the Larne line and the Portrush branch remain open and are operated by Northern Ireland Railways.

The upgrading of the Belfast to Derry~Londonderry by NI Railways will give faster more frequent trains with better permanent way and signalling as part of the strategic investment in the network.

==Signalling==



The majority of the NCC system was signalled using somersault signals. This type of lower quadrant semaphore signal, with a centrally pivoted arm, had originated on the Great Northern Railway in England.

Upper quadrant semaphore signals were installed at Larne Harbour station when the layout was remodelled in 1933.

Two types of mechanical ground signals were installed. The majority were similar to the LNER standard type but others of a Westinghouse type were to be found at Larne Harbour and a few other locations.

There were three colour light signal installations on the NCC. The earliest was at York Road station, Belfast where two-aspect colour light signals had been installed in 1926. The subsidiary signals were of a unique &quot;pointer light&quot; type.

Two-aspect searchlight signals were installed on the Main and Shore Lines in 1934 in connection with the opening of the Greenisland Loop Line. Finally, Coleraine was resignalled with three-aspect colour light signals in 1938.

At those crossing loops on the Main and Larne Lines which had been relaid with straight &quot;fast&quot; lines, the fast lines and loops were both fully signalled for working trains in the up and down directions. The use of Manson tablet exchange apparatus at these locations allowed tablet exchanges to be carried out regularly at speeds of up to (and on occasion in excess of) .

Most of the signal cabins on the broad gauge lines were to a BNCR hipped roof design by Berkeley Dean Wise that was introduced c1889. They had a brick base with wooden superstructure but usually also a brick back wall to the operating floor. A principal feature of these cabins was the overhanging roof supported by large eaves brackets which served to protect the window sashes from the weather. Newer cabins to the traditional design, such as those at Larne Harbour and Coleraine, omitted the eaves brackets but retained a distinctive appearance.

The new signal cabins at York Road, Greenisland, Antrim and Mount were built entirely from brick with flat concrete roofs. Another exception was Templepatrick cabin which was of all wood construction.

:Details of signalling systems in this section are mainly from &quot;LMS NCC Appendix to the Working Time Table&quot;.

==Locomotives==
===BNCR and constituents===
The early locomotives of the constituent companies were to assorted designs from a number of manufacturers. The first locomotives for the Belfast and Ballymena Railway were purchased from Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy. These were four 2-2-2 singles and one 0-4-2 goods engine. Later, four more 2-2-2s were ordered but this time from Sharp Brothers. Fairbairn 2-2-2s were to be found on the Ballymena, Ballymoney, Coleraine and Portrush Junction Railway but this company also favoured Sharp locomotives which were double framed 2-4-0s. These latter engines proved to be a sound investment, of those ordered in 1856, four were still in service in 1924. These locomotives were inherited by the BNCR.

The first engine to be built for the BNCR was No.35, an 0-6-0 by Sharp, Stewart and Company in 1861. Additional 2-4-0 and 0-6-0 locomotives were obtained from Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company.

During his tenure as Locomotive Superintendent from 1876 to 1922, Bowman Malcolm was responsible for creating an extensive stud of Worsdell-von Borries two-cylinder compound locomotives for the BNCR. The first of these entered service in 1890. There were &quot;Light Compounds&quot; which included small 2-4-0s with a peculiarly truncated appearance and larger, more powerful &quot;Heavy Compounds&quot;. Noteworthy were the two Class D 2-4-0s &quot;Jubilee&quot; and &quot;Parkmount&quot; which had diameter driving wheels and would be rebuilt as 4-4-0s. A 2-4-2 tank version, Class S, was designed for the narrow gauge lines. Many of these engines were built at York Road works, Belfast.

A good number of these locomotives were to survive throughout the LMS NCC period although many were rebuilt to two-cylinder simple expansion.

====Ross &quot;pop&quot; safety valve====
Class C 2-4-0 locomotive No.57 was the first engine in the world to be fitted with a Ross &quot;pop&quot; safety valve. The Ross valve was patented in 1902 by fitter R.L. Ross, a Coleraine man who had the first experimental valve made at York Road workshops. This type of two-stage safety valve had a very positive action designed to prevent &#x27;dribbling&#x27; of steam from a locomotive boiler at full pressure. In its developed form, the Ross &quot;pop&quot; safety valve would become a standard fitting on British steam locomotives and was also used overseas.

===NCC===
MR (NCC) locomotive policy continued BNCR practice and remained largely independent of Derby until Bowman Malcolm retired at the end of 1922. Von Borries compounds were still being built during this period. The last were two narrow gauge Class S 2-4-2 tank engines outshopped in 1919 and 1920. In 1920, the NCC&#x27;s broad gauge stock included twenty five 2-4-0 tender locomotives as compared with twenty two 4-4-0s. The remaining broad gauge locomotives were sixteen 0-6-0s, four 2-4-0 saddle tanks and two 0-4-0 dock tanks.

Midland Railway and LMS influence became increasingly apparent during the building and renewal programmes undertaken by Malcolm&#x27;s successors William Wallace and, later, H.P. Stewart. The modernisation and standardisation of NCC locomotives began in 1923 with the delivery of three standard G7 boilers from Derby. Two of these were to be used in rebuilding &quot;Light Compounds&quot; Nos.59 and 62 to Class U1 4-4-0 locomotives. From this time on, with few exceptions, all boilers would be LMS standard ones (G6, G7, G8). Derby works could more economically deal with these boilers than York Road and so they would be sent to Derby for overhaul. The boilers would return some four or five months later with a new firebox fitted, ready for installing in the next suitable engine coming into the works.

==== NCC locomotive classes ====
The BNCR introduced class letters for its locomotive stock in 1897. The MR (NCC) and later the LMS (NCC) continued to use the system adding new classes as required.

The following tables list details (where available) of NCC locomotive classes that were extant at the time of the amalgamation of the BNCR with the Midland Railway in 1903 and those classes which entered NCC stock subsequently.

==Coaching stock==
As with the locomotives, Midland Railway influence on NCC coaching stock design only became apparent after Bowman Malcolm retired in 1922.

The NCC was a small railway and did not require the variety of coach types that its parent the LMS did. However, the NCC provided accommodation for three classes of passengers throughout its existence and this led to there being several coach designations that were unique to the NCC.

Most LMS (NCC) coaches were similar to LMS Period I stock. This was perpetuated into the mid-1930s with repeat orders to existing designs. These coaches were mounted on steel under frames that were generally long, weighed between 28 and 31 tons depending on type, and ran on two four-wheeled bogies. They had wooden framed, fully panelled bodies with semi elliptical roofs and three-link screw couplings.

Side corridor stock such as the J6 thirds and F2 composites had doors with adjacent quarter lights to all compartments and ventilation was by droplights set into the doors. G1 tea cars had a small dining saloon and kitchen set into one end of a composite coach. Although there were no external doors to the dining saloon, the windows retained the droplight and quarter light arrangement.

On the other hand, open stock had a two-window arrangement whereby each seating bay had two windows side by side. One window was fixed and the other was a droplight. Restaurant vehicles such as the B2 first class dining car and the B3 third class dining saloon had Stone&#x27;s pattern ventilators above the fixed windows but this feature was not included in other open stock. The J5 open thirds were unusual in having four doors per side rather than two. The doors had adjacent quarter lights like those on the side corridor stock and opened directly into the passenger saloon rather than the end vestibules which only accommodated the lavatories.

The &quot;North Atlantic&quot; stock clearly belonged to Period II but the large picture windows and toplight ventilators had been inspired by contemporary Great Western Railway practice. The full set of five coaches was made up of four types. These were a B4 buffet car, an H3 side corridor tricomposite, two J8 side corridor thirds and a K3 side corridor brake third. The buffet car was long and the others long.

The class V14 bogie brake vans that appeared in 1936–37 were superficially similar to the LMS variety. However, they had standard underframes as opposed to ones and beading strips on the sides to cover panel joints.

The J10 open thirds that were built at the same time as the V14s generally reflected the styling of William Stanier Period III stock but these too had beading strips. Lavatories on these coaches appear to have been an afterthought. There were three doors on one side but only two on the other; a single lavatory had been squeezed into the vestibule where the missing door would have been. Despite their modern appearance, their bus type seats were not popular with passengers.

=== NCC coaching stock designations ===

:Much of the information in this section is derived from a review of NCC coach diagrams.

==Preserved vehicles==
A number of NCC vehicles have been preserved.

*Class U2 4-4-0 No.74 &quot;Dunluce Castle&quot; is on display at the Ulster Folk &amp; Transport Museum, Cultra, County Down.

*Class WT 2-6-4T steam locomotive No.4 is owned by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland at Whitehead which operates it on special excursion trains on the Irish railway network. The society also owns 3 NCC carriages.
*Although none of the original NCC Class W&#x27;s have survived into preservation, the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland at Whitehead is building a new member of the class.
*Coaches Nos.68, 87 and 91, are at the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland site at Whitehead.
*Railcar No.1 is stored in a dilapidated condition at the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland site at Whitehead.
*Coaches Nos.238 and 241, former Midland Railway vehicles which had been transferred to the NCC from the LMS as replacements for stock destroyed in the air raid of 4 May 1941, were repatriated in 2004 and 2005 respectively and are at the Embsay &amp; Bolton Abbey Steam Railway, Embsay, Yorkshire.
*Portstewart Tramway Kitson 0-4-0 tram locomotive No.1 was an early candidate for preservation, crossing the Irish Sea in 1939, and is in the collection of the Streetlife Museum of Transport, Kingston-upon-Hull, Yorkshire.

<text>William Morrow Fechteler (March 6, 1896 – July 4, 1967) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served as Chief of Naval Operations during the Eisenhower administration.

==Biography==
Fechteler was born in San Rafael, California, on March 6, 1896, the son of Rear Admiral Augustus F. Fechteler. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy with the class of 1916 and served in the battleship during World War I. Over the following two decades, Fechteler had a variety of seagoing and shore billets, including several staff positions and command of the destroyer .

In 1942–43, Captain Fechteler served in the Bureau of Navigation (later Bureau of Naval Personnel), then commanded the battleship in the Pacific. Promoted to the rank of rear admiral in early 1944, he was Commander of the Seventh Fleet&#x27;s Amphibious Group 8 from August 1944 to March 1945, participating in landings at Morotai, Leyte, Lingayen and elsewhere in the Philippines. He spent the rest of 1945 as Assistant Chief of Naval Personnel, in Washington, D.C., followed by service as Commander, Battleships &amp; Cruisers, Atlantic Fleet. As a vice admiral, he was Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Personnel, from February 1947 until January 1950 and, as an admiral (February 1, 1950), was Commander in Chief, Atlantic and United States Atlantic Fleet in February 1950 – August 1951.

In August 1951, Admiral Fechteler was appointed Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), succeeding Admiral Forrest P. Sherman, who had died in office in July. As CNO, Fechteler was responsible for sustaining Korean War-era naval activities in the Far East and in the European area. He made two trips across the Atlantic in 1951–52 and one to Asia. He continued the Navy&#x27;s building program for new aircraft carriers in the face of economy moves and to expand pay and benefits for the Navy&#x27;s people.

When President Dwight D. Eisenhower took office in 1953, he chose to replace all the Armed Forces&#x27; chiefs. In August 1953, Admiral Fechteler exchanged positions with the new CNO, Admiral Robert B. Carney, becoming Commander in Chief, Allied Forces, Southern Europe. He served at that command&#x27;s Naples headquarters until July 1956, when he retired. Over the next several years, Fechteler served on a special Defense Department study committee on personnel compensation and worked for the General Electric Company.

Fechteler died at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland on July 4, 1967, at the age of 71. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>The flip jump (also called the flip) is a figure skating jump. The International Skating Union (ISU) defines a flip jump as &quot;a toe jump that takes off from a back inside edge and lands on the back outside edge of the opposite foot&quot;. It is executed with assistance from the toe of the free foot.
==History==
The origin of the flip jump is unknown, although American professional figure skater Bruce Mapes might have created it. Gustave Lussi claimed that he and his student Montgomery Wilson invented it. The jump was sometimes called the Wilson in Canada and the Mapes in the United States after Mapes&#x27;s wife, Evelyn Chandler Mapes, who popularized the jump there.

Writer Ellyn Kestnbaum calls the jump &quot;somewhat trickier than the loop for most skaters. considerably more so than the salchow or toe loop&quot;, because of its unstable inside edge and the precision required to align and time the jump&#x27;s vault from the toepick. As a consequence, quadruple flip jumps are, as ESPN puts it, &quot;rare&quot;. Kestnbaum also states that it is crucial that the skater&#x27;s edge not be too deep, but instead almost forms a straight line. 

Variations of the flip jump include the half flip and the split flip. The half flip is often used as a simple transitional movement during a step sequence and as a takeoff for other half jumps. A split flip is a single flip jump with a split position at the peak of the skater&#x27;s position in the air. There is no record of the first male skater to perform the triple flip. 

In competitions, the base value of a single flip is 0.50; the base value of a double flip is 1.80; the base value of a triple flip is 5.30; the base value of a quadruple flip is 11.00; and the base value of a quintuple flip is 14.

<text>Juanita Pulsipher Brooks (January 15, 1898 – August 26, 1989) was an American historian and author, specializing in the American West and Mormon history. Her most notable contribution was her book related to the Mountain Meadows Massacre, to which her grandfather Dudley Leavitt was sometimes linked, and which caused tension between her and the church authorities. She also made significant archival contributions in the form of collected pioneer diaries documenting early Mormon history in the Dixie, Utah area.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Juanita Leone Leavitt was born to Henry Leavitt and Mary Hafen in Bunkerville, Nevada and raised there. Her grandparents on both sides were polygamists; her paternal grandfather, Dudley Leavitt, being one of the primary founders of Bunkerville. From a young age she developed an interest in history when, &quot;her brilliant, sensitive, and imaginative mind was saturated from childhood in Mormon lore.&quot; She was often employed as a grade school teacher in nearby Southern Utah. In 1919 she married Ernest Pulsipher, who died of lymphoma a little more than a year later, leaving her with an infant son, Leonard Ernest Pulsipher. After his death, she resumed her job as a teacher, and then received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from BYU. Her first published work was a poem titled &quot;Sunrise from the Top of Mount Timp,&quot; which appeared in the LDS periodical &quot;Improvement Era&quot; in 1926.

===Academia and family life===

After her bachelors degree, she settled in St. George, Utah, and became an instructor of English and Dean of Women from 1925–1933 at the LDS-backed Dixie Junior College. While on a sabbatical from Dixie College from 1928–1929, she obtained a master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University. 

In 1933, the state of Utah discontinued funding for parochial Mormon post-secondary education. She resigned from the college after the program was cut and, in the same year, married a widower named Will Brooks. She became stepmother to his four sons, Walter, Bob, Grant, and Clair. Within five years the couple added a daughter, Willa Nita, and three sons to their family. Juanita Brooks had affectionate relationships with all of her children, including her step-sons, describing her family as &quot;compound-complex&quot;. She would sometimes complain that she lacked time to write because of her family, but she also stated that her loved ones were essential to her happiness. Her children spoke highly of their mother at her funeral, telling stories of her nurturing character.

Her calling as a historian and writer was frequently at odds with her position as a believing Mormon woman. As a woman, she was expected to and, indeed, desired to devote her life to homemaking and motherhood. Her passion for research and writing was very unorthodox for her situation. As she wrote in an article for the Mormon studies journal, , in regards to her writing, she &quot;did not talk about it and did not work on it while they were around&quot;. She then described how she would always keep a basket of ironing work nearby, so that if a neighbor dropped by, she could cover her typewriter and appear to be doing housework.

=== Tension with the LDS Church ===
Despite her feelings of loyalty to and love for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Brooks anticipated excommunication upon the publication of &quot;The Mountain Meadows Massacre&quot; book. She greatly hoped for some sort of acknowledgement on behalf of general authorities, but she received none. In fact, such notable church authorities as Stephen L. Richards, LeGrand Richards, and Harold B. Lee discouraged Brooks from pursuing her study of the Mountain Meadows Massacre and questioned her motives and research. No disciplinary action was taken against Brooks by the church, but an atmosphere of disgrace descended upon her and her protective husband. For a time, she was ostracized from both her local congregation and Church officials for her investigations on such touchy subjects, and she was no longer published within official LDS Church periodicals. While she would state her opinion fearlessly, she often felt conflicted and guilty in her choice to oppose church leaders. She was confronted with two conflicting forces- the good name of the Church and her own faith on the one hand, and history she believed to be true on the other. Juanita chose truth, no matter the cost. In Brooks&#x27; letters to general authorities who criticized her, she affirmed her intentions. She famously stated that &quot;This study is not designed either to smear or to clear any individual; its purpose is to present the truth. I feel sure that nothing but the truth can be good enough for the church to which I belong.&quot;

Brooks has often been compared to Fawn Brodie, another Mormon historian who wrote &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot;, a similarly notorious biography of Joseph Smith. In fact, the two became good friends through their mutual connection of Dale Morgan, and frequently corresponded and assisted each other with scholarly work. Although Brodie was excommunicated for her book and Brooks was not, both were labeled as &quot;dissenters&quot;.

=== Accomplishments and death ===
Brooks was known as a very humble woman, who, in spite of her numerous recognitions, awards, honors, and academic postings, downplayed her intelligence and achievements. Brooks served on the board of trustees for the Utah State Historical Society for twenty-four years. She received honorary degrees from Utah State University, Southern Utah State College, and the University of Utah. She was also awarded the Distinguished Service Award of the Utah Academy of Arts, Sciences, and Letters in 1958. In 1975, she was awarded an honorary membership in Phi Beta Kappa at the University of Utah and a writing award from Dixie College and the Southern Heritage Writers&#x27; Guild. From her home in Salt Lake City, Utah, she kept up close relationships to her children and her ailing mother, Mary, who died in 1980. Around 1976, she began a slow and debilitating mental and physical decline, which stifled her continuing research and hopes of publication. Brooks died in 1989 from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, leaving her lifelong autobiographical project unfinished. In honor of Juanita Brooks, a scholarship endowment was established at Utah Tech University, formerly Dixie State College, as well as an annual lecture series.

== Books and scholarly work ==

===Pioneer diary archiving===
Brooks&#x27; interest in pioneer diaries came from the stories she had been told about the Mountain Meadows Massacre from family members and friends as she was growing up and later began collecting diaries from the area during the time period so that she could gather more information about the events that occurred. Brooks assisted Nels Anderson, while the latter was a graduate student at Columbia doing field work in sociology in Southern Utah, by researching the experiences of Brooks&#x27; grandfather Dudley Leavitt. In 1934, while Anderson was on the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, he facilitated Brooks&#x27; assignment to start and manage a branch of the Emergency Relief Administration in southern Utah. Brooks fulfilled this objective by paying individuals to transcribe local pioneer&#x27;s diaries. Brooks continued to devote herself to unearthing diaries and records of early settlers and organizing a Utah library of Mormons; and, in 1947, she joined the Board of the Utah Historical Society. The diary-collecting project was started under the Works Progress Administration during the Depression of the 1930s, and its transcripts were eventually cataloged at the Library of Congress. 

This work brought her into contact with Dale Morgan, who was the supervisor for the Utah Writer&#x27;s Project under the Works Progress Administration. She continued this work for the Huntington Library as a field fellow in the 1940s. These diaries were preserved for others&#x27; use due to Juanita&#x27;s diligent pursuit and copying.

===&quot;Quicksand and Cactus: A Memoir of the Southern Mormon Frontier&quot;===

Per the encouragement of Dale Morgan, Brooks&#x27; colleague in the Works Project Administration, Juanita began writing her autobiography, &quot;Quicksand and Cactus&quot; in which she describes her childhood and early adulthood through a mix of first and third point narrative. She began the manuscript in 1944 and attempted to get published multiple times through 1949 before temporarily abandoning the project to focus on the publication of &quot;The Mountain Meadows Massacre&quot;. During her revisions of the script, she took advice from Morgan to concentrate on the chapters on her childhood, as the chapters on her later life showed little enthusiasm from editors. Discouraged by rejections from publication firms, she also chose to fictionalize herself in the later versions of the script, substituting for herself a fictional character, Sal, a revision that has been subject to much controversy in the authenticity of her recount. Brooks defended her revision in a letter to D. L. Chambers stating, &quot;While I can see that it may lose something in authenticity, I hope that it may gain in vitality. I had felt that, to justify the book, the subject of an autobiography should have achieved distinction in some field, while a good story may just be a good story.&quot;

Brooks revisited the book in 1970 after returning to Salt Lake City after the death of her husband Will Brooks. The next five years were painstaking to finish the book as Brooks found it challenging to stick to it for long periods of time, and her memory began to falter in regards to her first marriage and early widowhood. In 1977, her children moved her back to St. George and boxed the manuscripts, essentially marking the end of her writing career. The rest of the publication was left up to Trudy McMurrin, Brooks&#x27; assigned developmental editor at the University of Utah Press. McMurrin pieced together chapters and ideas, but due to a lack of dates and unity in style and themes and despite her best efforts, she deemed the work unfit to publish. Juanita&#x27;s son Karl Brooks took the matter into his own hands and hired Richard Howe to prepare and publish the work. Howe consulted McMurrin, studied Juanita&#x27;s correspondence with Morgan, and evaluated consistencies among the paper and typewriters used by Brooks to logically order chapters for its final publication. Thus, the autobiography is unfinished by Juanita herself, a tribute to an unfinished quality of Brooks&#x27; living personality.

===The Mountain Meadows Massacre===

Brooks&#x27; study of diaries and other personal journals enlivened her historiography, and her subsequent works reflected her scrutiny of such sources. Brooks went on to write numerous historical articles as well as a variety of family narratives including a biography of her pioneer grandfather Dudley Leavitt and a biography of her sheriff husband, &quot;Uncle Will Tells His Story&quot;. Brooks&#x27; notable books on Mormon history include &quot;The Mountain Meadows Massacre&quot; (1950) and &quot;John D. Lee: Zealot, Pioneer Builder, Scapegoat&quot; (1961). She also edited Hosea Stout&#x27;s diaries. Brooks&#x27; book on the Mountain Meadows Massacre broke new ground. It was the first comprehensive account of the incident using modern historical methods. Juanita would write after the kids were in bed, often starting at 11:00 pm or midnight, and working for a few hours, then sleep but still get up with the family in the morning to get them all off to school and work. She would write while they were away by keeping her ironing handy; when someone would come over she would cover the typewriter with ironing and then iron until the visitor left. She seemed to have a great deal of ironing, and never seemed to get it finished. This inspired Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, a famous historian and professor: &quot;For a young Mormon mother struggling to define an intellectual life, it was great to know that a renowned historian had once hid her typewriter under the ironing. Juanita Brooks&#x27; example taught me that housewives could be thinkers, too.&quot;

Brooks&#x27; interest in the Mountain Meadows Massacre &quot;gave unity to her life very much like the unity a plot gives a novel.&quot; For the topic, she received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation that helped her to further her research on the Mountain Meadows Massacre and other topics.

While living near the area in Southern Utah where the massacre occurred, Brooks investigated the events thoroughly but found no evidence of direct involvement by Brigham Young. However, she did charge Young with obstructing the investigation and with provoking the attack through his incendiary rhetoric, calling him &quot;an accessory after the fact.&quot; Brooks suggested that Young became so fearful of federal invasion that he created a hothouse atmosphere where the militia saw threats everywhere.

Despite her notoriety within the church, &quot;The Mountain Meadows Massacre&quot; received resounding critical acclaim.

<text>Voice chat is telecommunication via voice over IP (VoIP) technologies—especially when those technologies are used as intercoms among players in multiplayer online games. The VoIP functionality can be built into some games, be a system-wide communication system, or a third-party chat software.

== History ==
Voice chat in video games began in the sixth generation with the Sega Dreamcast (circa 1999). Some games, including Seaman and Alien Front Online included built in voice chat functionality, though it required an active subscription to the Dreamcast&#x27;s online service, SegaNet.

In 2001, Sony released the Network adapter for their PlayStation 2 video game console, which allowed voice chatting with a headset. In 2002, Microsoft launched the Xbox Live service, including support for voice chat. Later, Microsoft required all Xbox Live console game developers to integrate voice chat capability into their games and bundled a microphone and headset with the Xbox Live retail unit. In 2005, Nintendo launched the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, an online multiplayer service for both the Nintendo DS and for the Wii. &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot;, which was released in March 2006, was the first game that allowed voice chatting through the Nintendo DS&#x27;s microphone. Nintendo also released a Nintendo DS headset for voice chat alongside the release of &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; (2006).

=== 2010s ===
Starting in the 2010s, third-party software have become very popular among gamers, even when in game VoIP services are available. Notable software includes Discord, Ventrilo, TeamSpeak, and Mumble. Support for Discord was added to the Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles in 2022, with support coming to PlayStation 5 in 2023.

== Impact ==
The widespread adoption of voice chat in online gaming has also led to several negative consequences. While voice chat has become a big hit in console games, it also leads to problems such as griefing, cyberbullying, harassment, and scams. Voice chat has enabled a new level of toxicity and harassment in online gaming communities. Players can now use voice chat to insult, belittle, and harass their teammates and opponents, creating a hostile and unpleasant gaming environment. Voice chat has also been used to scam and exploit players, particularly in games that involve trading or transactions. Scammers can use voice chat to build trust with their victims and convince them to hand over valuable in-game items or currency.

To mitigate the negative consequences of voice chat in online gaming, game developers and social media platform holders have implemented various measures, such as mute and block features, reporting of misconduct to online platforms, community guidelines that outline proper behavior and consequences for misconduct. These game developers and social media platforms have also implemented parental controls to restrict a child&#x27;s access to voice chat or limit their interactions with other players.

<doc id="1042850" wikidata="Q275552" url="?curid=1042850" title="Vultee P-66 Vanguard">
<text>The Vultee P-66 Vanguard was a United States Army Air Forces fighter aircraft. It was initially ordered by Sweden, but by the time the aircraft were ready for delivery in 1941, the United States would not allow them to be exported, designating them as P-66s and retaining them for defensive and training purposes. Eventually, a large number were sent to China where they were pressed into service as combat aircraft with mixed results.

==Design and development==
Vultee&#x27;s chief engineer Richard W. Palmer, made an all out effort to secure substantial military orders on the eve of World War II. According to Jonathan Thompson, &quot;Palmer and his staff project no fewer than four types, all with the same wing design and similar fuselage structure; the model 48 pursuit fighter, model 51 basic combat, model 54 advanced trainer and model 54A basic trainer.&quot; Sweden placed an order for 111 48Cs, but they were diverted for use by the USAAF as the P-66, and then diverted to India and China. The Vultee BC-51 lost out to North America&#x27;s AT-6 as the Air Corps&#x27; advanced trainer, though one was delivered as the BC-3. The Vultee model 54A, similar to the model 54 but with fixed landing gear, was selected by the USAAC as the BT-13.

In 1938, Richard W. Palmer started the detailed design of the V-48 fighter member of the quartet. The aircraft featured a metal-covered, semi-monocoque fuselage and fully retractable landing gear, and was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 air-cooled radial engine. During construction of the first prototype, a decision was made to lengthen the propeller shaft and install a tight cowling to provide a pointed nose to reduce drag. The first aircraft flew in September 1939 piloted by Vance Breese, and was assigned registration number &quot;NX21755&quot;. The fighter was named the Vanguard. On 9 May 1940, the prototype collided with a Lockheed Sirius while landing at Vultee airfield, the impact severing one main undercarriage leg. Nevertheless, Breese skillfully landed the airplane with little additional damage. It was subsequently rebuilt with the orthodox cowling as employed on subsequent machines.

==Operational history==

On 6 February 1940, the Swedish government ordered 144 Vanguards as the V-48C. The production prototype flew on 6 September 1940. The model V-48C was similar to the V-48X except for installation of a later version of the R-1830 engine with better higher altitude performance and provision for four machine guns in the wings and two machine guns in the fuselage.

When production deliveries began in September 1941, the U.S. government placed an embargo on exporting the aircraft to Sweden. In the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, all Vanguards were assigned the designation P-66. Production ended in April 1942. Approximately 50 aircraft were retained by the USAAF and primarily used at pursuit training bases in the western U.S. and were deployed to the 14th Pursuit Group in defensive roles. Although pilots were impressed by the P-66&#x27;s handling, the type was considered less than robust and a tendency to ground-loop led to 15 aircraft being destroyed in landing accidents.

The British government took possession of 100 P-66s as the Vanguard I with plans to use the aircraft as an advanced trainer in Canada. After concluding their trials however, the British then relinquished the aircraft to China where 104 Vanguards (including USAAC examples) were shipped under the Lend-Lease program. They were originally intended to equip the 3rd American Volunteer Group (AVG); however, plans for additional groups were dropped after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

The Chinese received the assembled fighters via India by late 1942; Chinese Vanguards had USAAF insignia and serials as well as Chinese markings and Vultee serials on factory models. The undistinguished combat record of the Vanguard in China was due to problems that began in transit where a number of Vanguards were destroyed during tests in India and others lost while en route to China. Assembled P-66s were deemed unairworthy and abandoned at Karachi resulting in only 12 Vanguards on station at Kunming with the 74th Fighter Squadron of the 23rd Fighter Group, but this unit saw little action. Two Chinese squadrons from the 3rd Group and the 5th Group based at An-Su saw combat action with the Vanguard from August 1943 onward. However, many P-66s were destroyed on the ground during Japanese attacks while several were shot down in error when they were mistaken for the Nakajima firm&#x27;s Ki-43 &quot;Oscar&quot; and Ki-44 &quot;Tojo&quot;. Although the Vanguard possessed a top speed of , it was no match for the agile Japanese fighters in high-&quot;g&quot; maneuvers and relied on hit-and-run tactics against the Japanese.

The P-66 in Chinese service was largely replaced by Curtiss P-40s in 1943. A number of surviving P-66 Vanguards were placed in caves for storage at Chungking for use in the civil war against Mao&#x27;s Communists. As late as 1947, many were reportedly still in their crates.

<text>State Route 87 (SR 87) is a north–south highway that travels from I-10 near Picacho northward to State Route 264 near Second Mesa.

==Route description==

SR 87 begins to the north of I-10 at a junction with an unsigned orphan segment of SR 84, which serves as a direct connection to I-10 at Exit 211. SR 87 travels north for toward Coolidge, passing by the town of Eloy. In Coolidge, State Route 87 is known as Arizona Boulevard.

The highway leaves Coolidge heading northwest and travels as a two-lane rural road through the Gila River Indian Community, until it reaches a junction with SR 587 on the border between the Gila River Indian Community and Chandler. North of this junction, SR 87 travels along Arizona Avenue in Chandler, intersecting Loop 202 before entering Mesa and becoming Country Club Drive. The highway then intersects with U.S. 60 and SR 202 for a second time, before leaving Mesa as the Beeline Highway. The Mesa and Chandler sections of SR 87 are discontinuous, with most of these sections between McKellips Road in Mesa and Cloud Road in Chandler being owned and maintained by their respective cities. A ADOT-owned segment north of the Western Canal and south of Baseline Road forms the city limits separating Mesa from Chandler, and also the city limits separating Gilbert from Mesa. The only major portions where SR 87 technically exists wholly inside Mesa city limits (under ADOT ownership) is the area surrounding US 60 and then a short length south of the Loop 202 Red Mountain Freeway north of McKellips Rd.

SR 87 is known as the Beeline Highway from McDowell Road, just north of Mesa, passing by Fountain Hills and to Payson. This portion of SR 87 is entirely a four-lane highway. There is a stretch of road where the highway splits, taking different canyons through the Mazatzal Mountains south of Payson, near the junction with SR 188. The old alignment is currently the southbound lanes, while a new alignment was built for the northbound lanes. There is a stretch where the roads cross-over each other because of the difference in elevations of the two canyons.

SR 87 is part of the National Highway System between I-10 and Payson. ADOT is currently studying a stretch of I-10 to widen and improve interchanges along its stretch from Tucson to Casa Grande, including the interchange with SR 87.

==History==

SR 87 was designated in 1924 from Casa Grande to Mesa. In 1927, it was rerouted to end in Eloy, and the old route was renumbered AZ 187. In 1959, it extended to Strawberry Junction. In 1967, it extended north over State Route 65 to its current terminus. By 1983, almost half of the Beeline Highway, between Mesa and Payson, had already been widened to either three or four lanes; in 1989, work began to convert the entire highway to four lanes, and was completed in 2001.

Notable destinations along SR 87 include the Mogollon Rim and Tonto Natural Bridge.

In the 1930s Harvey Bush championed a highway from Mesa to Payson, crossing the Mazatzal Mountains, which became known as the &quot;Bush Highway&quot;. In the 1950s a cutoff was built between Mesa and the Saguaro Lake turnoff, bypassing a slow section of the Bush Highway and shortening the trip by 15 minutes. This cutoff was dubbed the Beeline Highway, and the name gradually came to apply to the entire route.

<text>131 (one hundred thirty one) is the natural number following 130 and preceding 132.

==In mathematics==
131 is a Sophie Germain prime, an irregular prime, the second 3-digit palindromic prime, and also a permutable prime with 113 and 311. It can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive primes, 131 = 41 + 43 + 47. 131 is an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and real part of the form formula_1. Because the next odd number, 133, is a semiprime, 131 is a Chen prime. 131 is an Ulam number.

131 is a full reptend prime in base 10 (and also in base 2). The decimal expansion of 1/131 repeats the digits 007633587786259541984732824427480916030534351145038167938931 297709923664122137404580152671755725190839694656488549618320 6106870229 indefinitely.

131 is the fifth discriminant of imaginary quadratic fields with class number 5, where the 131st prime number 739 is the fifteenth such discriminant. Meanwhile, there are conjectured to be a total of 131 discriminants of class number 8 (only one more discriminant could exist).

<doc id="1042866" wikidata="Q3299024" url="?curid=1042866" title="Acute toxicity">
<text>Acute toxicity describes the adverse effects of a substance that result either from a single exposure or from multiple exposures in a short period of time (usually less than 24 hours). To be described as &quot;acute&quot; toxicity, the adverse effects should occur within 14 days of the administration of the substance.

Acute toxicity is distinguished from chronic toxicity, which describes the adverse health effects from repeated exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer time period (months or years).

It is widely considered unethical to use humans as test subjects for acute (or chronic) toxicity research. However, some information can be gained from investigating accidental human exposures (e.g., factory accidents). Otherwise, most acute toxicity data comes from animal testing or, more recently, &quot;in vitro&quot; testing methods and inference from data on similar substances.

== Measures of acute toxicity ==
=== Regulatory values ===
Limits for short-term exposure, such as STELs or CVs, are defined only if there is a particular acute toxicity associated with a substance. These limits are set by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), based on experimental data. The values set by these organizations do not always coincide exactly, and in the chemical industry it is general practice to choose the most conservative value in order to ensure the safety of employees. The values can typically be found in a material safety data sheet. There are also different values based on the method of entry of the compound (oral, dermal, or inhalation).
*Threshold limit value-time-weighted-average: The maximum concentration to which a worker can be exposed every work day (8 hours) and experience no adverse health effects.
*Short-Term Exposure Limit, STEL or Threshold limit value-short-term exposure limit, TLV-STEL: The concentration which no person should be exposed to for more than 15 minutes during an 8-hour work day.
*Ceiling value, CV or Threshold limit value-ceiling, TLV-C: The concentration which no person should ever be exposed to.

=== Experimental values ===
*No-observed-adverse-effect level, NOAEL
*Lowest-observed-adverse-effect level, LOAEL
*Maximum tolerable concentration, MTC, LC0; Maximum tolerable dose, MTD, LD0
*Minimum lethal concentration, LCmin; Minimum lethal dose, LDmin
*Median lethal concentration, LC50; Median lethal dose, LD50; Median lethal time, LT50 (LT50)
*Absolute lethal concentration, LC100; Absolute lethal dose, LD100

The most referenced value in the chemical industry is the median lethal dose, or LD50. This is the concentration of substance which resulted in the death of 50% of test subjects (typically mice or rats) in the laboratory.

==Responses and treatments==
When a person has been exposed to an acutely toxic dose of a substance, they can be treated in a number of ways in order to minimize the harmful effects. The severity of the response is related to the severity of the toxic response exhibited. These treatment methods include (but are not limited to):
*Emergency showers used for removing irritating or hazardous chemicals from the skin.
*Emergency eye washes used for removing any irritating or hazardous chemicals from the eyes.
*Activated charcoal used to bind and remove harmful substances consumed orally. This is used as an alternative to conventional stomach pumping.

<text>The Public Service Enterprise Group, Inc. (PSEG) is a publicly traded diversified energy company headquartered in Newark, New Jersey, US, established in 1985 with a legacy dating back to 1903.

The company&#x27;s largest subsidiary is Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&amp;G). The Public Service Electric and Gas Company is a regulated gas and electric utility company established in 1928 serving the state of New Jersey and it is New Jersey&#x27;s oldest and largest investor owned utility company; it was originally a subsidiary of the New Jersey–based Public Service Corporation.

==History==
PSE&amp;G/PSEG origins date back to 1903 with the defunct Public Service Corporation.

===Public Service Electric and Gas Company===
The Public Service Electric and Gas Company, commonly referred to as PSE&amp;G, is the primary subsidiary of the Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) and was established in 1928.

The Public Service Corporation was formed in 1903 by combining more than 400 gas, electric and transportation companies in New Jersey. In 1928, the corporation merged its electric and gas utilities into a single company, PSE&amp;G. Also in 1928, Public Service Coordinated Transport was formed as an umbrella for the transit businesses. The parent Public Service Corporation was dissolved in 1948 and PSE&amp;G became an independent company, with Public Service Coordinated Transport as a subsidiary.

PSCT was renamed Transport of New Jersey in 1971, and sold to New Jersey Transit in 1980, leaving PSE&amp;G exclusively in the utility business.

===Public Service Enterprise Group===
The Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) was established in 1985 to take control of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&amp;G).

In 1989, Public Service Enterprise Group established the Enterprise Diversified Holdings Inc. (now PSEG Energy Holdings) to begin consolidation of unregulated businesses. In 2000, Public Service Enterprise Group split off the PSE&amp;G subsidiary&#x27;s unregulated national power generation assets to form PSEG Power, while the PSE&amp;G subsidiary continued operating in New Jersey as a regulated gas and electric delivery company.

In June 2005, the acquisition of PSEG by Exelon, a Chicago and Philadelphia based utility conglomerate, was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; however, the deal was never consummated and eventually dissolved after it became clear that it would not win state regulatory approval from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.

In 2009, PSEG began installing solar panels on 200,000 utility poles in its service area in a project costing $773 million, the largest such project in the world. The Solar 4 All project increased the capacity for renewable energy in New Jersey and was completed in 2013. In addition, PSEG is building four solar farms in Edison, Hamilton, Linden, and Trenton.

In August 2020, about 400,000 customers on Long Island and 490,000 customers in New Jersey under the jurisdiction of PSEG were left without power as a result of Hurricane Isaias. Although some got power back within hours of Isaias, some had to wait days for power to be restored. As of August 10, 2020, around 42,000 Long Island customers were still without power, while around 20,000 New Jersey customers were without power. State and local officials have called for more accountability from PSEG after the storm passed. Governor Andrew Cuomo threatened to take away operating licenses from PSEG and ConEdison, while Nassau County Executive Laura Curran along with several state senators called for reimbursement to customers for their failure to respond quickly.

== Operations ==
Public Service Enterprise Group has three operating subsidiaries:
* Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&amp;G)
* PSEG Long Island
* PSEG Power

=== Public Service Electric and Gas ===
PSE&amp;G serves the population in an area consisting of a diagonal corridor across the state from Bergen to Gloucester Counties. PSE&amp;G is the largest provider of gas and electric service, servicing 1.8 million gas customers and 2.2 million electric customers in more than 300 urban, suburban and rural communities, including New Jersey&#x27;s six largest cities.

PSEG&#x27;s transmission line voltages are 500 kilovolts (kV), 345 kV, 230 kV and 138 kV with interconnections to utilities in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York. The company&#x27;s subtransmission voltages are 69 kV and 26 kV. PSEG&#x27;s distribution voltages are 13.2 kV and 4.16 kV.

=== PSEG Power ===
PSEG Power has four main subsidiaries: PSEG Nuclear, PSEG Fossil, PSEG Energy Resources &amp; Trade, and PSEG Power Ventures.

PSEG Nuclear operates three nuclear reactors at two facilities in Lower Alloways Creek Township. PSEG owns one reactor at Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station and operates two reactors at Salem Nuclear Power Plant where PSEG Nuclear holds a 57 percent stake (in partnership with Exelon Corporation). The three plants receive $300 million per year in subsidies. Exelon also operates two reactors at Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station in a 50/50 joint venture with PSEG.

=== PSEG Long Island ===
PSEG Long Island provides electricity to 1.1 million customers in Nassau and Suffolk counties, and the Rockaway Peninsula of Queens, part of New York City. This system operates under an agreement with the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency that owns the system, that went into effect January 1, 2014. PSEG was selected to essentially privatize LIPA after the controversies surrounding Hurricane Sandy, taking over near complete control of the system including its brand name, whereas before this agreement only a number of functions were performed by the private sector and the system was operated under the LIPA name.

==Environmental record==

In 2001, NOAA presented PSEG with The Walter B. Jones Memorial and NOAA Excellence Awards in Coastal and Ocean Resource Management in the category of Excellence in Business Leadership for its Estuary Enhancement Program.

<text>The Daily Chronicle was a left-wing British newspaper that was published from 1872 to 1930 when it merged with the &quot;Daily News&quot; to become the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;.

==Foundation==
The &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; was developed by Edward Lloyd out of a local newspaper that had started life as the &quot;Clerkenwell News and Domestic Intelligencer&quot;, set up as a halfpenny 4-page weekly in 1855.

Launched after the duties on advertising and published news had been abolished in 1853 and July 1855, this local paper specialised in small personal ads. At first, it carried about three times as much advertising as it did local news.

As the formula proved popular, it grew in size and frequency and often changed its name to match. In 1872, it finally changed from the &quot;London Daily Chronicle and Clerkenwell News&quot; to plain &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;. It was then being published daily in eight pages, half of which were news and half advertising.

Edward Lloyd was keenly interested in advertising. It had the potential to generate substantial income and so allow the paper&#x27;s cover price to be kept low. In time it contributed about 40% of &quot;Chronicle&quot; revenues. Demand was strong enough to charge a good price per line but, even so, advertising had to be limited to no more than half the paper. The lobby at 81 Fleet Street served as an informal labour exchange where advertisers and targets would search each other out in person.

==Early years==
Lloyd bought the paper in 1876, paying the owner £30,000 for the title and spending a further £150,000 on setting it up (about £19m in modern money). The Fleet Street office cost a further £40,000 a few years later.

Only a small circle knew about his plan and the public was taken by surprise when it appeared in national daily guise on 28 May 1877. They clearly liked what they read and the new paper was a success from the start. It had inherited a circulation of about 40,000 in 1877 and this rose to 200,000 in a year. It had risen to 400,000 by the outbreak of war in 1914 and doubled during the war. It was reputedly the best selling daily in the 1890s and, during the war, sold more copies than the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Morning Post&quot;, &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; combined.

Lloyd was a great believer in news – objective reporting of facts, unadorned by comment or speculation. The scope and quality of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;’s reporting secured its popularity. It was the first Fleet Street paper to report industrial disputes systematically. This echoed the paper’s political stance, but it also met readers’ need to know about what was a new legal regime at the time – freedom to join a trade union and picket workplaces.

The paper followed the London County Council and its first election in 1889, and covered religion and the affairs of the church. In the 1880s, it created a special section for colonial news under the title &quot;Greater Britain Day by Day&quot;. It also led the way in using specialist correspondents. Ample space was made available for books, literary extracts and the theatre.

Politically the paper was left of centre. It supported the radical wing of the Liberal Party but it might well have supported the Labour Party, had that existed in 1877. From 1892, it supported Irish home rule. John O&#x27;Connor Power, Irish MP and powerful orator, was one of its liveliest leader writers.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot;’s appearance coincided with the expansion of the London suburbs and the commuting by train that went with it. It competed with the &quot;Telegraph&quot; for that market and for those who felt that elite papers like the &quot;Times&quot; were not for them. The breadth of its news coverage was welcomed by many because it deliberately ranged far and wide – far beyond the Westminster affairs that dominated Fleet Street at the time.

==Middle years==
During Lloyd&#x27;s lifetime, the editor was a literary Irish journalist, Robert Boyle, who had helped Lloyd with the conversion of the paper. He maintained the local news coverage inherited from the Clerkenwell paper, but this was later dropped. He died in February 1890, two months before Lloyd.

The next editor, Alfred Fletcher, had been assistant to Boyle and had a more pronounced left-wing approach. After he left the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, he stood as a Liberal candidate for Parliament twice but was not elected. Many of his later writings were on education.

In 1894, Henry Massingham was appointed editor. Generally recognised as one of the leading journalists of the day, with influence in the corridors of power, he was able to build up a newspaper that he valued highly.

Although he worked for the &quot;Chronicle&quot; for a decade, Massingham was editor for just five years. On foreign policy, he was a great believer in the power of diplomacy and expressed his opposition to the Boer War with some vehemence. This went down badly with readers, many of whom had family or friends risking and losing their lives for that cause. As sales were lost, he was asked to resign by Frank Lloyd, son of Edward Lloyd and managing director of the company that owned the paper.

Politically, Massingham was at the radical end of the Liberal Party. He had edited the radical evening paper, &quot;The Star&quot;, in 1890–91. He went on to become editor of the &quot;Nation&quot;, where he transferred its allegiance to the Labour Party during the war. He resigned in 1923 when John Maynard Keynes, a Liberal, took it over.

In 1899, the &quot;Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s former foreign editor, William Fisher, became editor, handing over to Robert Donald in 1904.

Donald had worked as news editor for the &quot;Chronicle&quot; but had taken time off journalism to experience an unrelated occupation – promoting a hotel. From 1906, he also edited &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Weekly News&quot;, the Sunday newspaper owned by the Lloyd family.

He was thoughtful and principled, with a firm belief in objective reporting and editorial independence. Under his direction, the paper was broadly supportive of the radical wing of the Liberal Party under David Lloyd George. It was never anti-war, but it was critical of political interference in military strategy.

==Buy-out==

Donald had got to know Lloyd George well, although he never hesitated to point out failings if justified. After he became prime minister at the end of 1916, Lloyd George valued the &quot;Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s impartial and objective coverage and found it the most acceptable of the non-Conservative papers. He misled himself into thinking that Donald was an uncritical supporter, drawing confirmation from Donald&#x27;s willingness to advise him on the official propaganda effort in 1917 and then to accept an official position – &quot;director of propaganda in neutral countries&quot;.

In fact, the relationship between Donald and Lloyd George, always arm&#x27;s-length in Donald&#x27;s eyes, had been fatally soured by dealings in 1917 that were unknown to the public. Lloyd George had tried to buy the &quot;Chronicle&quot; through his political allies. Frank Lloyd, as owner, named his price. Although a realistic valuation, £900,000 was too high for the initial backer, the Liberal peer Lord Leverhulme. Lord Beaverbrook, a Conservative press baron who had promised to support Lloyd George for five years, then became involved as a potential backer.

Since selling to a Conservative proprietor would be anathema, Donald tried to form a rival consortium to buy the paper. This failed but the dealings between him and Lloyd George were irretrievably tainted by underhand behaviour on the prime minister&#x27;s side of the negotiations.

In 1918, events unexpectedly turned Lloyd George&#x27;s way, albeit rather uncomfortably. He had assured Parliament on 9 April that the number of British troops facing the German onslaught in March had not been reduced. Frederick Maurice, the general in charge of statistics on the Western Front, was greatly concerned by the inaccuracy of this statement. He wrote to the new Chief of Staff asking whether it should not be exposed, but received no reply. After some days examining his conscience, he decided to write a letter to all the major newspapers.

Four of them published the letter on 7 May. Maurice was forced to resign and Parliament debated the matter on 9 May. Lloyd George won the vote, partly by counterattacking Maurice&#x27;s figures but largely because there was no obvious successor and the war was at too sensitive a point to risk a governmental crisis. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; reported the debate factually.

However, a few days later, it recruited Maurice as its military correspondent. This move infuriated the prime minister. Lloyd George was now determined to buy the paper and set about raising the finance from friends of the party and by selling peerages. Beaverbrook was excluded, as were the Berry brothers of Allied Newspapers. The prime mover was Sir Henry Dalziel who already owned &quot;Reynold&#x27;s News&quot;. He was rewarded by a knighthood in 1918 and a peerage in 1921.

Wartime inflation had lifted Frank Lloyd&#x27;s price from £900,000 to £1.1m. In the end, Lloyd George paid £1.6m – probably for a quick sale. He was already planning the early general election that was announced immediately after the Armistice (he won).

Donald and the &quot;Chronicle&quot; knew nothing of these negotiations. He and Maurice heard a rumour on 3 October 1918 and Frank Lloyd confirmed the following day that the sale had gone through. A new regime was due to come into effect at 6 p.m on 5 October. Both men were obliged to resign.

==Later years==
The new editor was Ernest Perris, formerly the news editor. Some suspected him of having been complicit in Lloyd George&#x27;s negotiations. He was the source of the rumour passed on to Donald and Maurice, but this does not indicate whether he was the messenger or equally taken by surprise. He also became editor of &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in 1924.

Whatever the loss of independence did to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s credibility, its sales did not suffer under the new management. The editorial staff were not unduly interfered with, it seems. Rather, the paper suffered at the hands of corporate finance.

After Lloyd George ceased to be prime minister in 1922, he remained active in politics for the rest of the 1920s. His fall from power marked the end of the Liberal Party as a majority government but that was not apparent at the time. He needed money to back candidates but this time his idea of selling honours was thwarted by the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925.

He had a valuable asset in the form of United Newspapers, owner of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and other Lloyd publishing interests. He had bought off his fellow investors in 1922 and 1926, presumably at the 1918 valuation or thereabouts. He was sole owner in the sale contract. The question of whether the party should not benefit too caused some controversy at the time.

On 11 July 1927, Lloyd George sold the company to three investors who were rich but lacking experience of publishing, let alone newspapers. They paid him £2.9m. On 17 July 1928, a year and a week later, the three sold the company for £1.5m.

The first of these sales contained a curious clause that preserved Lloyd George&#x27;s editorial control without responsibility for its liabilities. He was granted a 10-year option to buy back the shares if the &quot;Chronicle&quot; or &quot;Lloyd’s Weekly&quot; failed to follow progressive Liberal policies or promoted reactionary or communist views.

This was endorsed by the next owner despite his allegiance to the Conservative Party. He was William Harrison, an entrepreneur who had acquired a number of magazines and provincial newspapers. He had also gone into paper-making through Inveresk Paper Co and that now owned the former Lloyd newspapers. In the 1929 crash, Inveresk&#x27;s share price fell 80%.

Harrison left the scene. An audit then showed that the &quot;Chronicle&quot; owed £3m in debt and commitments, had no cash and was suffering a marked loss of sales. It looked doomed. However, News and Westminster Ltd, a Cadbury company, offered to take the &quot;Chronicle&quot; on and merge it into the &quot;Daily News&quot; to create the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;. Their sales would combine to make 1,400,000, which seemed to offer a viable future. It was not a merger of equals, however, and the loss of jobs was borne by the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

The &quot;News Chronicle&quot; prospered until 1956 when its opposition to the UK&#x27;s involvement in the Suez crisis caused it to lose readers. Again facing closure, the only offer of help came from Associated Newspapers whose &quot;Daily Mail&quot; had been the &quot;Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s adversary since its launch in 1896.

Associated took an option to buy the company if it did not return to profit. When it failed to do that by the summer of 1960, Associated took over the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s plant, property and goodwill. The paper disappeared and, with it, the last vestiges of the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;.

<text>The GNU Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable Library (GNU MPFR) is a GNU portable C library for arbitrary-precision binary floating-point computation with correct rounding, based on GNU Multi-Precision Library.

==Library==
MPFR&#x27;s computation is both efficient and has a well-defined semantics: the functions are completely specified on all the possible operands and the results do not depend on the platform. This is done by copying the ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for fixed-precision floating-point arithmetic (correct rounding and exceptions, in particular). More precisely, its main features are:
* Support for special numbers: signed zeros (+0 and −0), infinities and not-a-number (a single NaN is supported: MPFR does not differentiate between quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs).
* Each number has its own precision (in bits since MPFR uses radix 2). The floating-point results are correctly rounded to the precision of the target variable, in one of the five supported rounding modes (including the four from IEEE 754-1985).
* Supported functions: MPFR implements all mathematical functions from C99 and other usual mathematical functions: the logarithm and exponential in natural base, base 2 and base 10, the log(1+x) and exp(x)−1 functions (codice_1 and codice_2), the six trigonometric and hyperbolic functions and their inverses, the gamma, zeta and error functions, the arithmetic–geometric mean, the power (xy) function. All those functions are correctly rounded over their complete range.
* Subnormal numbers are not supported, but can be emulated with the codice_3 function.

MPFR is not able to track the accuracy of numbers in a whole program or expression; this is not its goal. Interval arithmetic packages like Arb, MPFI, or Real RAM implementations like iRRAM, which may be based on MPFR, can do that for the user.

MPFR is dependent upon the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP).

MPFR is needed to build the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Other software uses MPFR, such as ALGLIB, CGAL, FLINT, GNOME Calculator, the Julia language implementation, the Magma computer algebra system, Maple, GNU MPC, and GNU Octave.

<text>A water ionizer (also known as an alkaline ionizer) is a home appliance which claims to raise the pH of drinking water by using electrolysis to separate the incoming water stream into acidic and alkaline components. The treated water is called alkaline water. Proponents claim that consumption of alkaline water results in a variety of health benefits, making it similar to the alternative health practice of alkaline diets. Such claims violate basic principles of chemistry and physiology. There is no medical evidence for any health benefits of alkaline water. Extensive scientific evidence has completely debunked these claims, leaving such claims in the pseudoscientific realm.

The machines originally became popular in Japan and other East Asian countries before becoming available in the U.S. and Europe.

==Health claims==
Water ionizers are marketed on the basis of health claims which are focused on their ability to make water more alkaline. A wide variety of benefits have been claimed, including the ability to slow aging, prevent disease, give the body more energy, and offset alleged effects of acidic foods. Some claims include it being twice as hydrating after exercise.

There is no empirical evidence to support these claims, nor the claims that drinking ionized water will have a noticeable effect on the body. Drinking ionized water or alkaline water does not alter the body&#x27;s pH due to acid-base homeostasis. Additionally, marketers have inaccurately claimed that the process of electrolysis changes the structure of water from large non-bioavailable water clusters to small bioavailable water clusters, called &quot;micro clusters&quot;.

Some proponents of alkaline water and the alkaline diet as a whole claim a link between alkaline intake and cancer prevention; no scientific evidence exists for such a connection, and as such, several cancer societies have denounced this claim.

==Operation==
Despite being described as &#x27;water ionizers&#x27;, the machines are designed to work as water electrolyzers. This is an electrochemical process in which water is split to form hydrogen and oxygen by an electric current. In some machines, the process produces calcium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid through the use of an ion-exchange membrane.

The effectiveness of the process is debatable because electrolysis requires significant amounts of time and power; hence, the amount of hydroxide that could be generated in a fast-moving stream of water such as a running tap would be minimal at best. Additionally, the process of reversing the reaction requires much less energy, so if the area between the alkaline and acidic water is at least semi-permeable, the water will undergo another reaction that just leaves neutral water.

<text>Bradley Alan Miller (born April 12, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player. The two-time NBA All-Star played for six National Basketball Association (NBA) teams.

==College career==

After playing prep school basketball for a season in Maine at MCI Maine Central Institute, Miller returned to his home state to attend Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he played under head coach Gene Keady and assistant coaches Bruce Weber and Frank Kendrick. During his freshman season, along with senior Cuonzo Martin, he led the Boilermakers to a 25–7 record. Along the way, he was part of a Big Ten Conference Title and an NCAA Second Round appearance. He averaged 6.5 points and 5.4 rebounds a game.

During his sophomore season, Miller helped lead Purdue, along with fellow sophomore Chad Austin, to a three-peat conference title and a consecutive NCAA Second Round appearance. The Boilers finished the season with a 26–6 overall record. Miller averaged 9.6 points and 5.5 rebounds on the season.

Miller&#x27;s junior season showed more progress than the prior season, averaging 14.3 points and 8.3 rebounds a game. Finishing second in the conference, Miller, along with teammate and former NBA player Brian Cardinal, helped the Boilers to a third straight NCAA Second Round finish. They beat Rhode Island in overtime, where Brad scored 31 points, grabbed eight rebounds and set a school tournament record with made/attempted free throws, going 15–21 from the line. He finished his junior season with an 18–12 record. Throughout his junior year, Miller became the only center in Purdue history to lead the team in assists.

Miller had his best college season during his senior year, helping with a 28–8 record. Averaging 17.2 points and 8.8 rebounds in his last season at Purdue, he led the Boilermakers to a Sweet Sixteen appearance and a 2nd overall seed in the NCAA Tournament. Miller set a school tournament record with 6 steals in a win against Delaware. His last collegiate game was a loss to Stanford. Miller&#x27;s biggest game of his senior season came against Michigan State, where he scored 30 points and pulled down 12 rebounds to force Michigan State to share their Big Ten crown.

During his career at Purdue, Miller became one of only six players (Joe Barry Carroll, Terry Dischinger, Walter Jordan, Robbie Hummel, and Zach Edey) to record 800 rebounds and the first player in school history to have 1,500 points, 800 rebounds, and 250 assists.

==Professional career==

===Livorno (1998)===
After college, because of the NBA lockout, Miller started his career in the Italian Serie A with Bini Viaggi Livorno for three months.

=== Charlotte Hornets (1999–2000) ===
Miller was then signed by the Charlotte Hornets as an undrafted free agent in 1999. He played for the Hornets for two seasons. On March 24, 1999, he had 25 points, going 9–9 shooting and 7–7 from the line. On May 5, 1999, scored a season high 32 points to go along with 13 rebounds in a win against the Boston Celtics. The Hornets made it to the playoffs the following season where they lost 1–3 to the Philadelphia 76ers. In his first playoff series, Miller averaged 7.5 points on 52 percent shooting.

===Chicago Bulls (2000–2002)===
After two seasons with the Hornets, Miller signed with the Chicago Bulls as a free agent. In January 2002, he was involved in an on-court altercation with center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers. After he and Charles Oakley gave a hard foul on O&#x27;Neal, Miller walked away as O&#x27;Neal swung at the back of his head; O&#x27;Neal would be suspended three games. Nearly doubling his playing time with the Bulls, he averaged 12.7 points a game, shooting 46 percent during the 2001–02 season.

===Indiana Pacers (2002–2003)===
In February 2002, Miller was traded by the Bulls with Ron Mercer, Ron Artest (now Metta Sandiford-Artest) and Kevin Ollie to the Indiana Pacers for Jalen Rose, Travis Best, Norman Richardson, and a second-round draft pick. He wrapped up the 2001–02 season with a 15.1 points and 8.2 rebounds per game average. During his first and only complete season with the Pacers, he made his first NBA All-Star Team becoming one of the first undrafted players to be named an All-Star along with the Detroit Pistons&#x27; Ben Wallace the same year. The Pacers clinched a playoff berth for the 6th season in a row, where they lost to the Celtics, 4–2.

===Sacramento Kings (2003–2009)===

During the 2003 offseason, Miller was involved in a sign-and-trade with the Sacramento Kings. He was signed to a multi-year deal by Indiana and then traded to the Kings in exchange for Scot Pollard. In the same trade, the Kings sent Hedo Türkoğlu to San Antonio Spurs, San Antonio traded Danny Ferry to Indiana and Indiana traded Ron Mercer to San Antonio. While signing with the Kings, Miller stated, &quot;I wanted to stay with Indiana but my agent said that the money I could make with Sacramento was just too good to pass up and I would never get this kind of contract again.&quot; On November 21, 2003, Miller recorded his first career triple-double with 22 points, 14 rebounds, and 10 assists in a win over the Orlando Magic. Less than a month later, Miller recorded another triple-double with 18 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists. Averaging 14.1 points and 10.3 rebounds in his first season with the Kings, he was voted to back-to-back NBA All-Star Game appearances. In the playoffs, Sacramento lost the Western Conference Semifinals 4–3 to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Miller appeared in only 56 games during his second season in Sacramento, yet averaging his career high of 15.6 points a game. On February 2, 2005, Miller scored a career-high 38 points to go along with 17 rebounds in a win over the Golden State Warriors. Two days later scored his first back-to-back 30 points game with 35 against the New York Knicks. In the playoffs, Miller averaged a career-high 11.2 points but the Kings lost 4–1 to the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round. In middle of the 2005–06 season, he became the first center since Sam Lacey in 1981 to record back-to-back double-doubles in both points and assists. After a career best 1,182 points scored during the season, the following 2006–07 season brought lower averages and totals of the previous five years. On April 10, 2007, Miller recorded his third career triple-double with 17 points, 10 rebounds and a career-high 11 assist.

On January 14, 2009, Miller recorded his first 30/20 game with 30 points and a career-high 22 rebounds in a win over the Golden State Warriors. He finished his five and a half seasons with the Kings averaging just over 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 4 assists a game.

===Return to Chicago (2009–2010)===

On February 18, 2009, the Kings reached a tentative agreement to trade Miller and John Salmons to the Chicago Bulls for Drew Gooden, Andrés Nocioni, Michael Ruffin (later traded to Portland Trail Blazers for Ike Diogu) and Cedric Simmons. As a veteran presence on a young team, Miller added depth in the paint with forward/center Joakim Noah to compete in the 2009 NBA Playoffs after a two-year absence of postseason play while with the Kings. On April 28, Miller received a busted lip by Boston Celtics guard Rajon Rondo, and missed game-decisive free-throws at the end of game 5 of the Eastern Conference First Round. During game six of the 7-overtime series and after receiving 7 stitches for his lip, he posted a double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds, shooting 8 for 9 from the floor. Miller averaged 10.3 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 1.3 assists during the seven-game series in the 2009 Playoffs. He made 5 of 7 three point field goals (71.4%) and shot 79.2 percent from the free throw line.

===Houston Rockets (2010–2011)===
On July 17, 2010, Miller signed a three-year contract with the Houston Rockets, worth $15 million. He was expected to back up Yao Ming and provide the Rockets a valuable insurance policy. On November 12, 2010, in Miller&#x27;s first start after coming to the Rockets, he scored 23 points, grabbed 8 rebounds, and gave out 5 assists. On December 3, 2010, Miller tied his season-high 23 points, going a perfect 7-7 from the field, including 3-3 from downtown, and 6-7 from the foul line.

===Minnesota Timberwolves (2011–2012)===
During the 2011 NBA Draft, Miller was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, along with the rights of Nikola Mirotić, in a deal that sent the rights of Donatas Motiejunas and Jonny Flynn to Houston. Due to microfracture knee surgery on his left knee while a member of the Rockets in May 2011, he was doubtful to begin playing for the Wolves at the projected start of the 2011–12 season (which was delayed due to the owners&#x27; lockout) - or indeed at all.

On January 12, 2012, Miller practiced with the team for the first time, strictly in half-court situations to protect his knee. He made his debut with the team on January 29, 2012. In an interview with Yahoo! Sports, he announced that the 2011–2012 season would be his final season. After the season, however, Miller&#x27;s agent said that Miller was undecided about retiring.

On July 13, 2012, Miller was traded to the New Orleans Hornets, then traded to the Phoenix Suns as part of a three-team deal on July 27, 2012. He was waived by the Suns on August 15, 2012, when the team signed Jermaine O&#x27;Neal. Miller later reaffirmed his decision to retire.

==International career==

Shortly after finishing his college career, Brad joined the US national team in the 1998 FIBA World Championship. During the time of the NBA lockout, there were no players from the league on the team. With fellow former Purdue standout Jimmy Oliver, Miller led the USA team to the bronze medal. He played under NBA coach Rudy Tomjanovich.

Miller was selected as a member of the U.S. squad that competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship, where he played along with fellow NBA players, such as LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard. After much hype over the improvement of the team, the tournament ended in disappointment with a loss to Greece in the semifinal game. The team finished with the bronze medal by defeating Argentina. Despite pre-tournament assertions that the U.S. needed a good-shooting big man like Miller, he rarely played in the tournament and did not log any playing time in the decisive semifinal loss. The team was coached by Duke&#x27;s head coach Mike Krzyzewski.

==Career notes==
Despite his size, Miller did not fit the mold of a traditional center. He only averaged double-digit rebounds once in his career and never averaged more than 1.2 blocks per season.

In 2005–2006, Miller averaged 4.7 assists per game, good for 29th in the league but far above what other centers averaged (Ben Wallace was second among centers with 1.9 APG). The Princeton offense run by the Kings both allowed and demanded Miller to be a good passer, and he was typically recognized as one of the best-passing big men in the league. Miller also added a three-point shot to his game.

<doc id="1042920" wikidata="Q266339" url="?curid=1042920" title="Józef Bem">
<text>Józef Zachariasz Bem (, ; 14 March 1794 – 10 December 1850) was a Polish engineer and general, an Ottoman pasha and a national hero of Poland and Hungary, and a figure intertwined with other European patriotic movements. Like Tadeusz Kościuszko (who fought in the American War of Independence) and Jan Henryk Dąbrowski (who fought alongside Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy and in the French Invasion of Russia), Bem fought outside Poland&#x27;s borders anywhere his leadership and military skills were needed.

==Early life==
He was born on 14 March 1794 in Tarnów in Galicia, the area of Poland that had become part of the Habsburg monarchy through the First Partition in 1772. After the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw from the territories captured by Napoleon, he moved with his parents to Kraków, where after finishing military school (where he distinguished himself in mathematics) he joined the ducal forces as a fifteen-year-old cadet. He joined a Polish artillery regiment as a sub-lieutenant and then lieutenant in the French service, took part in the French invasion of Russia (1812), and subsequently distinguished himself in the defence of Danzig () (JanuaryNovember 1813), winning the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Legion d&#x27;honneur.

After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Duchy of Warsaw was transformed into the constitutional Kingdom of Poland, a dependent territory of the Russian Empire, and Bem became a teacher at a military college. There he carried out research on a newly designed rocket-like missile, publishing his research with extensive illustrations.

Bem became involved in a political conspiracy to restore Poland to full independence, but, when his membership in a secret patriotic organisation was discovered, he was demoted and sentenced (in 1822) to one year in prison. Although the sentence was suspended, Bem resigned his commission and moved to Galicia. There he researched steam engines and their application, and again published his results. Bem lived in Lwów (now Lviv) and Brody until 1830, and planned on writing a treatise on the subject.

==November Uprising==

When the November Uprising, an insurrection for Polish independence, broke out on 29 November 1830 against the Russian Empire, Bem immediately joined the Polish insurgents. He arrived in Warsaw, was given a major&#x27;s commission and the command of the 4th Light Cavalry Battalion, which he led during the Battles of Iganie and Ostrołęka. During the Battle of Ostrołęka, Bem&#x27;s forces bravely charged the Russian opponents. Although the Polish army suffered a serious defeat with a loss of 6,000 men, Bem&#x27;s actions prevented the destruction of the entire army. For his valour on the battlefield, Bem was awarded the Virtuti Militari Golden Cross and promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. He was steadfastly against capitulation until the very end of the Uprising, during the desperate defence of Warsaw against Prince Paskievich (27 September 1831). Nonetheless, the Polish army was eventually compelled to lay down arms on 5 October 1831, and crossed the Russian–Prussian partitional border under the command of General Maciej Rybiński in the Great Emigration.

==First exile==
Bem then escaped to Paris, where he supported himself by teaching mathematics. In France, he published his next work, on the national uprising in Poland, in which he not only gave an appraisal of the 1831 insurrection, but also tried to present a programme for the continuation of the struggle for the country&#x27;s freedom. During his stay in France, he collaborated with the Hôtel Lambert organization and was a member of the Historical and Literary Society.

In 1833 he went to Portugal to assist the liberal Dom Pedro against the reactionary Dom Miguel, but abandoned the idea when it was found that a Polish legion could not be formed there. While in Portugal he was the target of an assassination attempt carried out by Russian agents.

==1848 hero==
A wider field for his activity presented itself in 1848 due to the Austrian Revolution in the Habsburg Empire. First he attempted to hold Vienna against the imperial troops of Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz, and, after the capitulation, hastened to Pressburg (, today Bratislava, Slovakia) to offer his services to Lajos Kossuth, first defending himself, in a long speech, from the accusations of &quot;treachery to the Polish cause&quot; and &quot;aristocratic tendencies&quot; — which the more fanatical section of the Polish émigré Radicals repeatedly brought against him. He was entrusted with the defence of Transylvania at the end of 1848, and in 1849, as General of the Székely troops, he performed miracles with his little army, notably at the bridge of Piski (now Simeria, Romania) on 9 February, where, after fighting all day, he drove back an immense force of pursuers.

After relieving Transylvania he was sent to drive the Austrian General Anton Freiherr von Puchner out of the Banat region. Bem defeated von Puchner at Orsova (now Orșova) on 16 May, but the Russian invasion forced Bem to retreat to Transylvania. From 12 to 22 July Bem was fighting continually, but finally, on 31 July 1849, his army was annihilated by overwhelming numbers in the Battle of Segesvár (now Sighişoara); Bem escaped after feigning death. He fought a fresh action at Nagycsür (now Șura Mare) on 6 August, and contrived to bring his fragmented army to the Battle of Temesvár (now Timișoara), to aid the hard-pressed General Henryk Dembiński. Bem was in command and was seriously wounded in the last pitched battle of the war, fought there on 9 August.
==Second exile and death==
On the collapse of the rebellion he fled to the Ottoman Empire, where he adopted Islam, and served as Governor of Aleppo under the name of Murad Paşa/Pasha. His last military victory was defeating Bedouins sieging the city of Aleppo. On 10 December 1850, he died of malaria.

==Burial and grave==
Bem was buried in a military cemetery in Aleppo. In 1926 a committee was formed to bring his body back to Poland. His mausoleum was designed by Adolf Szyszko-Bohusz and built on an island in a pond, in Strzelecki Park in Tarnów. Since Bem has converted to Islam, as was required for his career in the Ottoman Empire, he couldn&#x27;t be buried in Catholic ground, but the unique design of this mausoleum – a rectangular sarcophagus standing on six Corinthian columns, above ground – made it possible for him to be buried in his hometown. On the longer side walls of the sarcophagus there are inscriptions: &quot;Józef Bem&quot; on the front, &quot;Bem apó, a magyar szabadságharc legnagyobb hadvezére 1848–1849&quot; (&quot;Grandpa Bem, greatest leader of the Hungarian fight for freedom 1848–1849&quot; in Hungarian) on the back. On the shorter side walls فريق مراد باشا (&quot;Lt. General Murat Pasha&quot;) is written on one side and the years 1794, 1850 and 1929 (the years of his birth, death and reburial, respectively) on the other.

The mausoleum has been completed in July 1928. Bem was exhumed on 20 June 1929. Before the coffin reached Tarnów, it was displayed to the public at the National Museum in Budapest, and then in the Wawel Castle in Kraków. The funeral ceremony of General Józef Bem in Tarnów took place on 30 June 1929. The next day, the coffin, after being moved to the building of the Rifle Society, was opened for an anthropological research to be carried out. The skull was too fragile to make a plaster cast. On 6 July in the morning, after the construction of a special scaffolding, the coffin was lifted with cranes to the top of the mausoleum and placed in the sarcophagus, and the side wall was bricked up.

==Character and legacy==
Bem was a man respected for his courage and heroic temper, both of which were in contrast with his small stature. His influence is said to have been magnetic: although none of his Székely subordinates understood the language he spoke, most revered him. As a soldier Bem was remarkable for his excellent handling of artillery and the rapidity of his marches. In Hungarian, he is often referred to affectionately as &quot;Bem apó&quot;, which roughly translates into &quot;Grandpa Bem&quot; or &quot;Old Man Bem&quot;.

In the 1930s Hungary and Poland each had a regiment of mounted artillery named for him. To date, Bem remains the most famous Muslim in both countries, partly due to his role in the fight for independence in both states.

A statue to his honour was erected at Marosvásárhely (now Târgu-Mureş, Romania) but he lives still more enduringly in the verses of the Hungarian national poet Sándor Petőfi, who fell in the fatal action of 31 July 1849 at the Battle of Segesvár.

The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 (which originally started as a sympathy protest, supporting the Polish Poznań protests) began on 23 October with a protest at the foot of the Bem Statue in Budapest.

== Works ==

Józef Bem published also in French, Polish and German languages books about the history of Poland, technology and military aspects:

*Józef Bem – &quot;La Pologne dans ses anciennes limites et l&#x27;empire des Russies&quot; 1836

The great Polish poet Cyprian Norwid, a descendant of Jan III Sobieski, dedicated to Józef Bem the poem &quot;Bema pamięci żałobny rapsod (Funeral Rhapsody in Memory of Bem)&quot;, which was subsequently used by other artists including Zbigniew Herbert and Czesław Niemen.

Since 1969 Czesław Niemen&#x27;s &quot;Bema pamięci żałobny rapsod (Mourner&#x27;s Rhapsody in Memory of Bem)&quot; became cult status in Central Europe and also beyond the Iron Curtain.

In 1974 an English version was re-recorded with the help of Michał Urbaniak, John Abercrombie, Jan Hammer, Rick Laird and Don Grolnick, which was published worldwide by CBS Records International.

In 1977 the &quot;Bema pamięci żałobny rapsod (Mourner&#x27;s Rhapsody in Memory of Bem)&quot; intro from the 1970 initial issue was bootlegged by the West German rock band Jane as intro and reprise intro for the second side of their elegic Krautrock album &quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot; also immediately achieving golden record status.

Józef Bem&#x27;s descendants are present mainly among artists and in music related business in Poland and in exile and include the jazz singer Ewa Bem and her brothers Aleksander Bem and the jazz guitarist Jarosław Bem.

<text>Étienne Cabet (; January 1, 1788 – November 9, 1856) was a French philosopher and utopian socialist who founded the Icarian movement. Cabet became the most popular socialist advocate of his day, with a special appeal to artisans who were being undercut by factories. 

Cabet published &quot;Voyage en Icarie&quot; in French in 1839 (and in English in 1840 as &quot;Travels in Icaria&quot;), in which he proposed replacing capitalist production with workers&#x27; cooperatives. Recurrent problems with French officials (a treason conviction in 1834 resulted in five years&#x27; exile in England), led him to emigrate to the United States in 1848. Cabet founded utopian communities in Texas and Illinois, but was again undercut, this time by recurring feuds with his followers.

==Early and family life==

Cabet was born in Dijon, Côte-d&#x27;Or, the youngest son of a cooper from Burgundy, Claude Cabet, and his wife Francoise Berthier. He was educated as a lawyer. Cabet married Delphine Lasage on March 25, 1839 at Marylebone, London, during his exile in England, who bore a child.

==Career in France==

Cabet secured an appointment as attorney-general in Corsica. He represented the government of Louis Philippe, despite having headed an insurrectionary committee during the July Revolution of 1830 which led to the ouster of the &quot;Republican Monarch&quot; King Charles X (and the ascent of Louis Philippe). However, Cabet lost this position for his attack upon the conservatism of the government in his &quot;Histoire de la révolution de 1830&quot;. Nonetheless, in 1831, Cabet was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in France as the representative of Côte d&#x27;Or, and sat with the extreme radicals.
Accused of treason in 1834 because of his bitter attacks on the government both in the history book and subsequently, Cabet was convicted and sentenced to five years&#x27; exile. He fled to England and sought political asylum. Influenced by Robert Owen, Thomas More and Charles Fourier, Cabet wrote &quot;Voyage et aventures de lord William Carisdall en Icarie&quot; (&quot;Travel and Adventures of Lord William Carisdall in Icaria&quot;, 1840), which depicted a utopia in which a democratically elected governing body controlled all economic activity and closely supervised social life. &quot;Icaria&quot; is the name of his fictional country and ideal society. The nuclear family remained the only other independent unit. The book&#x27;s success prompted Cabet to take steps to realize his Utopia.

In 1839, Cabet returned to France to advocate a communitarian social movement, for which he invented the term &quot;communisme&quot;. Some writers ignored Cabet&#x27;s Christian influences, as described in his book &quot;Le vrai christianisme suivant Jésus Christ&quot; (&quot;The real Christianity according to Jesus Christ&quot;, in five volumes, 1846). This book described Christ&#x27;s mission to be to establish social equality, and contrasted primitive Christianity with the ecclesiasticism of Cabet&#x27;s time to the disparagement of the latter. In it, Cabet argued that the kingdom of God announced by Jesus was nothing other than a communist society. The book also contained a popular history of the French Revolutions from 1789 to 1830.

In 1841 Cabet revived the &quot;Populaire&quot; (founded by him in 1833), which was widely read by French workingmen, and from 1843 to 1847 he printed an Icarian almanac, a number of controversial pamphlets as well as the above-mentioned book on Christianity. There were probably 400,000 adherents of the Icarian school.

==Emigration to the United States of America==
In 1847, after realizing the economic hardship caused by the depression of 1846, Cabet gave up on the notion of reforming French society. Instead, after conversations with Robert Owen and Owen&#x27;s attempts to found a commune in Texas, Cabet gathered a group of followers from across France and traveled to the United States to organize an Icarian community. They entered into a social contract, making Cabet the director-in-chief for the first ten years, and embarked from Le Havre, February 3, 1848, for New Orleans, Louisiana. They expected to settle in the Red River valley in Texas. However, the Peters Land Company gave them deeds to only 320 acres of land in Denton County, Texas near what became Dallas, Texas rather than the million acres of land in the Red River Valley they expected (more than 200 miles away). The first group of emigrants ultimately returned to New Orleans; Cabet came later at the head of a second and smaller band. Neither Texas nor Louisiana proved the looked-for Utopia, and, ravaged by disease, about one-third of the colonists returned to France.

The remainder (142 men, 74 women and 64 children, although 20 died of cholera en route), moved northward along the Mississippi River to Nauvoo, Illinois, where they purchased twelve acres recently vacated by the Mormons in 1849. Cabet was unanimously elected leader, for a one-year term. The improved location enabled the experiment to develop into a successful agricultural community. Education and culture were highly valued by members. By 1855, the Nauvoo Icarian community had expanded to about 500 members with a solid agricultural base, as well as shops, three schools, flour and sawmills, a whiskey distillery, English and French newspapers, a 39 piece orchestra, choir, theater, hospital and the state&#x27;s largest library (4000 volumes). Members met on Saturdays to discuss community affairs and problems, with universal male suffrage; women were allowed to speak but not vote. On Sundays members talked about ethical and moral issues, but there were no denominational religious services, only members had espoused Christianity before joining the community. Based on this success, some even considered expanding the community 200 miles west to Adair County, Iowa.

However, Cabet was forced to return to France in May 1851 to settle charges of fraud brought up by his previous followers in Europe. Although found not guilty by a French jury in July 1851, when Cabet returned to Nauvoo in July 1852, the community had changed. Some men were using tobacco and abusing alcohol, many women were adorning themselves with fancy dresses and jewelry, and families claimed land as private property. Cabet responded by issuing &quot;Forty-Eight Rules of Conduct&quot; on November 23, 1853, forbidding &quot;tobacco, hard liquor, complaints about the food, and hunting and fishing &#x27;for pleasure&#x27;&quot; as well as demanding absolute silence in workshops and submission to him. Some described him as authoritarian or emotionally unstable; internal problems arose and worsened.

In the spring of 1855, Cabet tried to revise the colony&#x27;s constitution to make him president for life, but was instead relieved of the presidency, so his followers went out on strike, and were in turn temporarily barred from the communal dining hall. Although the colony by then had 526 members and 57 more across the Mississippi River at Montrose, Iowa, it was suffering economically—dependent upon money brought by new members and subsidies from the &quot;Le Populaire&quot; home office in France.

Moreover, split regarding the work division and food distribution worsened during the summer and following year. Cabet published his final book, &quot;Colonie icarienne aux États-Unis d&#x27;Amérique&quot; (1856), but that failed to solve the internal problems. In October 1856, about 180 supporters and Cabet left Nauvoo in three groups for New Bremen, Missouri near St. Louis, Missouri.

==Death and legacy==
Cabet suffered a stroke on November 8, 1856, a few days after moving to Missouri with the last group of his followers, and soon died. He was buried at the Old Picker&#x27;s Cemetery, but his remains were moved during construction of a high school on the site, and now rest at New Saint Marcus Cemetery and Mausoleum in Affton, St. Louis County, Missouri, with a gravestone funded by the French Embassy.

On February 15, 1858, the remaining Icarians settled in Cheltenham on the western edge of St. Louis, under the leadership of a lawyer named Mercadier, whom Cabet had designated as his successor. That colony would disband in 1864 (with several young men fighting in the American Civil War) and two families rejoined the Icarians in Corning, Iowa discussed below (the Cheltenham area became a neighborhood within St. Louis). Before his death, Cabet sued the Nauvoo Icarians in a local court, as well as petitioned the Illinois legislature to repeal the act that incorporated the community. The Nauvoo colony relocated to Corning, Adams County, Iowa, about 80 miles southwest of Des Moines, Iowa between 1858 and 1860, because of Illinois crop failures as well as the end of financial support from France following the Panic of 1857. The Corning Icarians prospered until another factional split in 1878, prompted by new emigrants from France, who left to establish a community in Cloverdale, California in 1883 (but &quot;Icaria Speranza&quot; lasted only four years). The colony at Corning disbanded in 1898, but by that time it had existed for 46 years, making it the longest non-religious communal living experiment in American history.

The library at Western Illinois University has a Center for Icarian Studies, as well as Icarian archives and papers. The Nauvoo Historical Society also has some papers and artifacts on display, and some in the town remember the Icarians during the Labor Day Grape Festival, through a historical play. The connection with grape cultivation is more symbolic than foundational, as the growing of Concord grapes in the Nauvoo area did not begin with the Icarians. It sprang from efforts by a French Catholic priest in the 1830s, and expanded in 1846 when Swiss vintner John Tanner brought the Norton grape to the area. However, Baxter&#x27;s Vineyards and Winery was founded by Icarians Emile and Annette Baxter in 1857, and continues as a 5-generation old family business. It is Illinois&#x27; oldest winery.

<doc id="1042932" wikidata="Q946347" url="?curid=1042932" title="The Seven Sins of Memory">
<text>The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers is a book by Daniel Schacter, former chair of Harvard University&#x27;s Psychology Department and a leading memory researcher.

The book revolves around the theory that &quot;the seven sins of memory&quot; are similar to the seven deadly sins, and that if one tries to avoid committing these sins, it will help to improve one&#x27;s ability to remember. Schacter argues that these features of human memory are not necessarily bad, and that they serve a useful purpose in memory. For instance, persistence is one of the sins of memory that can lead to things like post traumatic stress syndrome. However persistence is also necessary for long-term memory, and so it is essential, according to Schacter.

==Overview==
Schacter asserts that &quot;memory&#x27;s malfunctions can be divided into seven fundamental transgressions or &#x27;sins&#x27;.&quot; These are transience, absent-mindedness, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility, bias, and persistence. The first three are described as sins of omission, since the result is a failure to recall an idea, fact, or event. The other four sins (misattribution, suggestibility, bias, and persistence) are sins of commission, meaning that there is a form of memory present, but it is not of the desired fidelity or the desired fact, event, or ideas.

==Types of memory failure==
===Transience===
Transience means the influence from one 
memory on another one. Failures are due to the general deterioration of a specific memory over time and are enhanced by interference of memories. There are two types of interference: proactive interference (old memory inhibits the ability to remember new memories properly), and retroactive interference (new memories inhibit the ability to remember old memories accurately). Typically, more information can be remembered of recent events than older events. This is especially true with episodic memory as compared to semantic memory, as &quot;richly detailed evocative memories from the past&quot; contain more multidimensional information than &quot;general conceptual knowledge divested of a specific spatiotemporal context&quot;. Since memories of experiences contain multifaceted information—including sensory, spatial, and temporal details—, there are more areas inside an episodic memory susceptible to interference. 

One of Schacter&#x27;s examples of transience is a study of how well undergraduates remembered how they found out about the O. J. Simpson trial verdict immediately after, 15 months, and 32 months later. After three years, fewer than 30 percent remembered accurately, and nearly half had major errors.

===Absent-mindedness===

This form of memory failure involves a problem at the point where attention and memory interface. Common errors of this type include misplacing keys or eyeglasses, or forgetting appointments. The reason is that at the time of encoding sufficient attention was not paid to the fact that place or time etc. would later need to be recalled. Absentmindedness means here that the person&#x27;s attention is focused on something different, and therefore misses part of the encoding.

===Blocking===
Blocking is when the brain tries to retrieve or encode information, but another memory interferes with it. Blocking is a primary cause of Tip of the tongue phenomenon (a temporary inaccessibility of stored information).

===Misattribution===

Misattribution entails correct recollection of information with incorrect recollection of the source of that information. For example, a person who witnesses a murder after watching a television program may incorrectly blame the murder on someone he or she saw on the television program. This error has profound consequences in legal systems because of its unacknowledged prevalence and the confidence which is often placed in the person&#x27;s ability to impart correctly information critical to suspect identification.

One example Schacter gives of eyewitness misattribution occurred in connection with the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. Two days before, the bomber rented a van, but an employee there reported seeing two men renting it together. One description fit the actual bomber, but the other description was soon determined to be of one of a pair of men who also rented a van the next day, and were unconnected with bombing.

Schacter also describes how to create misattribution errors using the DRM procedure. Subjects are read a list of words like &quot;sharp&quot;, &quot;pin&quot;, &quot;sewing&quot;, and so on, but not the word &quot;needle&quot;. Later subjects are given a second list of words including the word &quot;needle&quot;, and are asked to pick out which words were on the first list. Most of the time, subjects confidently assert that &quot;needle&quot; was on the first list.

===Suggestibility===
Suggestibility is somewhat similar to misattribution, but with the inclusion of overt suggestion. It is the acceptance of a false suggestion made by others. Memories of the past are often influenced by the manner in which they are recalled, and when subtle emphasis is placed on certain aspects which might seem likely to a specific type of memory, those emphasized aspects are sometimes incorporated into the recollection, whether or not they occurred. For example, a person sees a crime being committed by a redheaded man. Subsequently, after reading in the newspaper that the crime was committed by a brown-haired man, the witness &quot;remembers&quot; a brown-haired man instead of a redheaded man.

Loftus and Palmer&#x27;s work into leading questions is an example of such suggestibility.

===Bias===
The sin of bias is similar to the sin of suggestibility in that one&#x27;s current feelings and worldview distort remembrance of past events. This can pertain to specific incidents and the general conception one has of a certain period in one&#x27;s life. Memories encoded with a certain amount of stimulation and emotion are more easily recalled. Thus, a contented adult might look back with fondness on his or her childhood, induced to do so by positive memories from that time, which might not be representative of his/her average mood during his/her childhood.

===Persistence===
This failure of the memory system involves the unwanted recall of information that is disturbing. The remembrance can range from a blunder on the job to a truly traumatic experience, and the persistent recall can lead to formation of phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, and even suicide in particularly disturbing or intrusive instances.

<doc id="1042950" wikidata="Q5138465" url="?curid=1042950" title="Coat of arms of Kłodzko">
<text>The coat of arms of [[Kłodzko]] shows a white Bohemian Lion on a red field with a golden crown and a double tail. The coat of arms comes from the dynasty of Czech kings Premyslids.

== Legend ==
Residents of Kłodzko, granted municipal rights by Přemysl Otakar II, the ruler of the Bohemia, decided to go to the Prague court, to ask the king for the grant of a coat of arms, which was the most important determinant of a city in the Middle Ages. The king, after an audience with the delegation, agreed to give Kłodzko a coat of arms, which represented the lion&#x27;s crown. During the transport of stone sculptures of the image of a lion to Kłodzko, an accident occurred when the statue fell out of the cart and broke in a place where the lion&#x27;s tail was. Therefore, the messenger once again went to Prague, where he received a new sculpture with arms, with the difference that the sculptor, as a safety measure, made the lion with two tails. This time on the way back, nothing happened, and the disc arrived safely to Kłodzko.

== Coat of arms ==

In fact, the Kladsko/Kłodzko/Glatz coat of arms was granted to the city by King Ottokar II sometime during his reign (1253–1278). The precise date and circumstances are not known, because the royal foundation charter (or its copy) has not survived. The figure of a silver lion with two tails refers to the heraldic symbol of the Kingdom of Bohemia, to which all the Kłodzko Land belonged from the 10th century until 1742–1748. The earliest image of a lion is preserved on the municipal seal originating in the third quarter of the 13th century.

A similar coat of arms is also borne by the second biggest town in this region – Bystrzyca Kłodzka.

<text>Françoise Boivin (born June 11, 1960 in Hull, Quebec) is a Canadian politician, who represented the electoral district of Gatineau in the House of Commons of Canada until 2015.

She first represented the district from 2004 to 2006 as a member of the Liberal Party, but was defeated in the 2006 election by Richard Nadeau of the Bloc Québécois. She subsequently left the Liberals and ran to reclaim her seat in the 2008 election as a New Democratic Party candidate, but was narrowly defeated by Nadeau. She was re-elected to Parliament as a New Democrat in the 2011 election. She was defeated in 2015.

== Studies, early career and community involvement ==

Françoise Boivin has degrees in social sciences and civil law from the University of Ottawa.

Boivin has been a member of the Quebec Bar since 1984. She began her legal career with Beaudry, Bertrand and subsequently co-founded the law firm Letellier &amp; Associés. During this time, she also taught, and was in charge of the negotiation sector, at the Quebec Bar training school.

In September 1998, Boivin hosted a public affairs program on CJRC. She was subsequently asked to host a number of other programs for CJRC-1150 and for Canal Vox. During the times of increasing price of gas, she asked her radio listeners to boycott Petro-Canada to push the country&#x27;s national fuel company to decrease its prices.

In 2000, she set up her own firm where she works mainly in the area of labour law.

Boivin has participated in many fundraising activities to help agencies such as the Canadian Cancer Society, the Outaouais Alzheimer&#x27;s Society, and the Foundation for Heart Disease (Outaouais). She has also worked closely with various support and network agencies helping women and seniors.

== Liberal politician ==
In 2004, Boivin, a longtime Liberal supporter, won her party&#x27;s nomination for Gatineau. She defeated Bloc candidate Richard Nadeau by only two percentage points, an unusually close margin for what has historically been a strongly federalist riding. She made a breakthrough in politics as newly elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) by being one of the first to openly oppose the US missile defence system, a point of view that ultimately became the official position of Prime Minister Paul Martin.

Françoise Boivin was also chosen to be the official seconder to the 2004 Speech from the Throne in October of that year. She was a member of the Committee on Bill C-38 to provide legal recognition of same-sex marriage, which she supported. In Parliament, she was a member of the Subcommittee on Parliamentary Privilege and the Liberal Committee on Cities and Communities. She was also part of the Standing Committee on Official Languages and the Standing Committee on Finance.

She was named &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; by Susan Delacourt of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, and was one of the rare MPs to have never missed a vote in the House of Commons. As a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs which studied the topic of Electoral Reform, on May 17, 2005, when Ed Broadbent proposed a detailed resolution that the government launch a process of electoral reform, she immediately stated that she fully concurred with his resolution, which formed the basis for the Committee&#x27;s Report the next month. She also served as chair of the Liberal Women&#x27;s Caucus.

Boivin was narrowly defeated by Nadeau in the January 23, 2006 federal election. She remained active within the Liberal Party, backing Michael Ignatieff during the 2006 Liberal Party leadership campaign and as media specialist for the Liberal Women&#x27;s Commission (Quebec).

==Move to the NDP==
On February 25, 2008, Boivin announced that she would seek to regain her old seat, this time as the candidate of the NDP. She opted to leave the Liberals after learning they planned to have a &quot;star candidate&quot; parachute into the riding. However, she said that her views were more aligned with those of the NDP than the Liberals. She had been a prominent member of the Liberals&#x27; left wing, and voted against stated Liberal policy five or six times during her initial stint in Parliament. She was formally welcomed to the party on June 17 at a press conference that included NDP leader Jack Layton and deputy leader/Quebec lieutenant Thomas Mulcair.

As an indication of her popularity, Boivin came in a very close second during the 40th Canadian Election in October 2008, beating the Liberal and distant Conservative candidates and challenging incumbent Nadeau very late into election night for the final result. At 29.1%, Nadeau received the lowest share of the popular vote of any candidate elected in that election.

==Between elections==
Boivin practiced labour law at her own law firm and was strongly involved in Outaouais community activities and associations. She was an advisory member of the committee for the President of the Women&#x27;s Business Network (RÉFAP) and a guest speaker at the Public Service Commission Management School. She appeared weekly on television as host of &quot;La Vérité choc&quot; with Roger Blanchette and &quot;Le Témoin est à vous&quot; on Canal Vox, and as a news commentator on the &quot;Denis Lévesque&quot; broadcast on LCN and TVA.

At its November 2008 convention, Boivin was elected president of the Quebec Section of the federal NDP, a position she occupied until November 2010.

==2011 election==
Boivin once again ran as the NDP candidate in her old riding of Gatineau during the 41st Canadian election. In the May 2, 2011 election, she won with 61.8% of the vote as part of the massive NDP tsunami that swept across Quebec, finishing 27,000 votes ahead of Nadeau.

==41st Parliament==
On May 26, 2011 Layton named Boivin critic for the Status of Women. On September 20, 2011, interim Opposition Leader Nycole Turmel also named her Deputy Critic for Justice. Boivin also co-chaired the Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations with Conservative Senator Bob Runciman. In April 2012, newly elected NDP leader Mulcair named her critic for Justice.

==2015 election==
Boivin lost to Liberal Steven MacKinnon in the October 19, 2015 election.
