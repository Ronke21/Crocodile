<text>J. Fred Muggs (born March 14, 1952) is a chimpanzee born in the African colony of French Cameroon that forms part of modern-day Cameroon. Brought to New York City before his first birthday, he was bought by two former NBC pages and eventually appeared on a host of television shows on that network including NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; where he served as mascot from 1953 to 1957. Muggs worked in several television shows including a short-lived eponymous series, toured the world and worked at Busch Gardens in Tampa, Florida. He officially retired at age 23. , Muggs was still alive. Chimpanzees have been known to live up to 70 years, though 50 is more commonly the animal&#x27;s lifespan.

==Life and career==
Muggs was born in French Cameroon. He first became popular when he was in Henry Trefflich&#x27;s pet store in New York; a &quot;name that chimp&quot; contest led to his being named Mr. Muggs, to which the &quot;Today Show&quot; later added &quot;J. Fred&quot;. Carmine &quot;Bud&quot; Mennella and Leroy &quot;Roy&quot; Waldron, former NBC pages, bought him for $600 when he was 10 months old, and Mennella trained him. He appeared on the &quot;Perry Como Show&quot; and Pat Weaver of the &quot;Today Show&quot; saw potential in him; Mennella had an appointment with NBC executives for Muggs to audition for the &quot;Today Show&quot;, but missed it; however, Muggs&#x27; antics in a coffee shop led the president of the network to offer him a contract anyway. Muggs first appeared on the show on February 3, 1953, dressed in diapers like a baby.

The &quot;Today Show&quot; had begun in 1952, with Dave Garroway as host, but was doing poorly. The introduction of a chimpanzee caused Jim Fleming, the original newsreader, to quit; he was replaced by Frank Blair. However, the addition of Muggs boosted ratings and helped win advertisers; the program&#x27;s producer, Richard Pinkham, once estimated Muggs had brought the network $100 million. Muggs sat in Garroway&#x27;s lap, mastered more than 500 words, and had a wardrobe of 450 outfits. He &quot;read&quot; the day&#x27;s newspapers, imitated Popeye and played the piano with Steve Allen. Merchandise featuring him included books, comics, and games; as a star, he was called on to open supermarkets and commission US Navy ships.

Many sources refer to Garroway as jealous of Muggs. Joe Hagan of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; noted, without attribution, that &quot;Legend has it that ... Mr. Garroway grew jealous and began spiking Muggs&#x27; orange juice with benzedrine to make him misbehave and deliver his human co-host back to center stage.&quot; Many sources suggested that Muggs did not have a good disposition. He has been described as &quot;a nasty little monkey&quot; and as &quot;throwing legendary tantrums&quot;. He is said to have learned that if he misbehaved when the red light was on, indicating that the program was broadcasting live, he could not be disciplined. At the press conference announcing his addition to the show, Muggs yanked Garroway&#x27;s glasses off. He was restrained in a harness and leash, but sometimes escaped: during one remote broadcast he climbed a tree and had to be lured down with bananas, and in Beirut an associate producer had to chase him in her underwear down a hotel hallway.

Many contemporary websites refer to Muggs as having bitten comedian Martha Raye on the arm. Though Gerald Preis told Hagan that this story was a &quot;tabloid rumor&quot; and &quot;just plain bullshit.&quot;, the story is well documented in the 1954 press, including the report from an NBC representative circulated by the International News Service: &quot;An NBC spokesman said yesterday the network plans no punitive action against J. Fred Muggs, popular TV chimp star which bit comedienne Martha Raye and her understudy [Vickie Carlson] Saturday night.&quot;

Muggs&#x27;s handlers at one point sued Garroway in the chimp&#x27;s name for allegedly ruining Muggs&#x27;s career by claiming to have been bitten by him; Garroway said Muggs had bitten him on the face on live TV.
 During a 1955 episode of the game show &quot;Make the Connection&quot;, Muggs appeared with Joanne Cottingham, who served as his babysitter; the panel was supposed to attempt to guess her relationship to the chimpanzee, but after Muggs was introduced, he spent most of the segment running all over the set (as well as behind it) until host Gene Rayburn finally called the game and awarded Cottingham the show&#x27;s maximum $150 payoff by default.

Muggs was also an artist. In 1958, one of his finger paintings was used as the cover of &quot;Mad&quot; #38. Supposedly, Muggs bit editor Al Feldstein.

Muggs was associated with &quot;Mad&quot; in another way, when the magazine ran an article titled &quot;The Dave Garrowunway Show&quot;. This article focused on the chimpanzee, whom writer Harvey Kurtzman named &quot;J. Floyd Gluggs&quot;, and his apparent ambition to take over &quot;Garrowunway&#x27;s&quot; spot as anchor. Sure enough, by the end of the article, with &quot;Garrowunway&quot; rapping rudely on the window from outside the building, &quot;Gluggs&quot; appears in Garroway&#x27;s familiar closing pose, in suit, glasses and lavalier microphone, saying &quot;vootie&quot; in place of the anchor&#x27;s tagline &quot;Peace,&quot; with his right palm thrust forward. The caption reads, &quot;By George...we&#x27;ve warned Garrowunway to watch out...&quot;

&quot;Today&quot; interrupted its coverage of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation (which involved slightly delayed still pictures and BBC radio audio) with foolery and advertising for tea, featuring Muggs. This was severely criticized in the United Kingdom and by some US television critics, including Jack Gould in &quot;The New York Times&quot;; in the UK the introduction of commercial television was being debated at the time, and its opponents felt that it strengthened their case. It was arguably a key factor in the strong regulation of ITV (by the Independent Television Authority) written into the Television Act 1954, including its ban on advertising breaks during programming featuring the Royal Family.

Muggs went on a world tour to promote &quot;Today&quot;; in Japan, where his popularity was second only to that of Marilyn Monroe, 15 geishas waited on him, while in Russia &quot;Izvestia&quot; described him as &quot;a symbol of the American way of life&quot; and said he was &quot;necessary in order that the average American should not look into reports on rising taxes, and decreasing pay, but rather laugh at the funny mug of a chimpanzee.&quot; In 1957—supposedly following the Martha Raye incident—he was replaced on the show by another chimpanzee called Kokomo Jr. NBC&#x27;s press release stated that he intended &quot;to extend his personal horizons&quot;, and he briefly starred in &quot;The J. Fred Muggs Show&quot;. He then worked at Busch Gardens in Tampa, Florida, and appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; (on ABC) to celebrate his 23rd birthday, before retiring.

Muggs and his &quot;live-in girlfriend&quot;, Phoebe B. Beebe (who also made appearances on &quot;Today&quot;), were still alive as of January 12, 2012, and living in Citrus Park, Florida, in the care of Gerald Preis, Mennella&#x27;s son. In 2004, Joe Hagan reached Preis at his home, where Preis stated that Muggs &quot;has a little gray, mostly in his beard.&quot;

==Legacy==
For many years, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ran an annual feature highlighting its takes on the year&#x27;s most dubious television programs, episodes, activities, and issues, &quot;The J. Fred Muggs Awards for Distinguished Foolishness&quot;. And in the 1994 film &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, chronicling the infamous quiz show scandal of the late 1950s, actor Ralph Fiennes as &quot;Twenty-One&quot; champion Charles Van Doren—shown being offered a regular job on &quot;Today&quot;—says to the Dave Garroway character (played by Barry Levinson), &quot;I hope you&#x27;re not firing the chimp!&quot;

<text>The KSD-64[A] Crypto Ignition Key (CIK) is an NSA-developed EEPROM chip packed in a plastic case that looks like a toy key. The model number is due to its storage capacity — 64 kibibits (65,536bits, or 8KiB), enough to store multiple encryption keys. Most frequently it was used in key-splitting applications: either the encryption device or the KSD-64 alone is worthless, but together they can be used to make encrypted connections. It was also used alone as a fill device for transfer of key material, as for the initial seed key loading of an STU-III secure phone.

Newer systems, such as the Secure Terminal Equipment, use the Fortezza PC card as a security token instead of the KSD-64. The KSD-64 was withdrawn from the market in 2014. Over one million were produced in its 30-year life.

==Operation==
The CIK is a small device which can be loaded with a 128·bit sequence which is different for each user. When the device is removed from the machine, that sequence is automatically added (mod 2) to the unique key in the machine, thus leaving it stored in encrypted form. When it is reattached, the unique key in the machine is decrypted, and it is now ready to operate in the normal way. The analogy with an automobile ignition key is close, thus the name. If the key is lost, the user is still safe unless the finder or thief can match it with the user&#x27;s machine. In case of loss, the user gets a new CIK, effectively changing the lock in the cipher machine, and gets back in business.

The ignition key sequence can be provided in several ways. In the first crypto-equipment to use the idea (the KY-70), the CIK is loaded with its sequence at NSA and supplied to each user like any other item of keying material. Follow-on application (as in the STU-II) use an even more clever scheme. The CIK device is simply an empty register which can be supplied with its unique sequence from the randomizer function of the parent machine itself. Not only that, each time the device is removed and re-inserted, it gets a brand new sequence. The effect of this procedure is to provide high protection against the covert compromise of the CIK wherein a thief acquires the device, copies it, and replaces it unknown to its owner. The next morning (say), when the user inserts the device, it will receive a new sequence and the old copied one will be useless thereafter. If the thief has gotten to his machine during the night, he may be able to act into the net; but when the user attempts to start up in the morning the user&#x27;s device will no longer work, thus flagging the fact that penetration has occurred.

This concept appears particularly attractive in office environments where physical structures and guarding arrangements will not be sufficiently rigorous to assure that crypto-equipments cannot be accessed by unauthorized people.

<doc id="1068849" wikidata="Q3229192" url="?curid=1068849" title="Leimert Park, Los Angeles">
<text>Leimert Park (; ) is a neighborhood in the South Los Angeles region of Los Angeles, California.

Developed in the 1920s as a mainly residential community, it features Spanish Colonial Revival homes and tree-lined streets. The Life Magazine/Leimert Park House is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life Magazine/Leimert Park House&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of Leimert Park is Leimert Park Village, which consists of Leimert Plaza Park, shops on 43rd Street and on Degnan Boulevard, and the Vision Theater. The village has become the center of both historical and contemporary African-American art, music, and culture in Los Angeles.

==History==

Leimert Park is named for its developer, Walter H. Leimert, who began the subdivision business center project in 1928. The master plan was designed by the Olmsted Brothers company, which was managed by the sons of Frederick Law Olmsted (1822–1903), the landscape designer best known for Central Park in New York City.

Elderly Japanese-American residents still live in the area, and some of the Japanese gardens still exist. The Crenshaw Square Shopping Center was inspired and designed in the style of Japanese architecture. The center was a hub of retailing in the mid 1950s.

In 2013 and 2014, resurgent home prices in South Los Angeles spurred much interest among many young professionals into moving into Leimert Park and among other areas within the region. Observers took note with mixed feelings: fears of gentrification and hope for increased business investment. The trend continued with 2021 seeing a jump in house prices.

==Geography==
===Neighborhood boundaries===

According to LAist: The boundaries are Obama Boulevard (formerly Rodeo Road) on the north, 4th Avenue and Roxton Avenue on the east, West Vernon Avenue on the south, and Crenshaw Boulevard on the west. The Crenshaw District lies to the northwest, View Park and Baldwin Hills are to the west and southwest, Vermont Square is to the east, and Jefferson Park is to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;laist 2008/07/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Los Angeles Times Mapping L.A. project: Leimert Park is bounded by Exposition Boulevard on the north, South Van Ness Avenue and Arlington Avenue on the east, West Vernon Avenue on the south, and Victoria Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard on the west. Jefferson Park is to the north, the Exposition Park neighborhood and Vermont Square are to the east, Hyde Park to the south and View Park-Windsor Hills and Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw to the west. Leimert Park angles to the West Adams district on the northwest.

According to Google Maps: the boundaries are Exposition Boulevard on the north, Western Avenue on the east, West Vernon Avenue on the south, and Crenshaw Boulevard on the west.

According to the books &quot;Leimert Park (Images of America)&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Residential Architecture&quot;, Leimert Park was established with the following boundaries: Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. (formerly Santa Barbara Avenue) on the north, Arlington on the east, Vernon to the south and Crenshaw Boulevard (formerly Angeles Mesa Drive) on the west.

===Historic Leimert Park Village===

Within the Leimert Park neighborhood lies the city-designated &quot;Historic Leimert Park Village&quot;. On May 1, 2018, the Los Angeles City Council designated the area between the intersections at Vernon Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard, 43rd Street and Crenshaw Boulevard, Leimert Boulevard and 43rd Street, Leimert Boulevard and Vernon Avenue, and Degnan Boulevard and 43rd Street as “Historic Leimert Park Village&quot; and directed the Department of Transportation to erect permanent ceremonial sign(s) to this effect at these locations.

In 2005, a &quot;Leimert Park Village&quot; brick gateway marker was installed.

==Demographics==
A total of 11,782 people lived in Leimert Park according to the 2000 U.S. census— counted 9,880 residents in the 1.19 square-mile neighborhood. The median age was 38. The percentage of residents aged 65 and above was among the county&#x27;s highest.

Within the neighborhood, African Americans made up 79.6% of the population, with Latinos at 11.4%, Asians at 4.9%, White at 1.5%, and other races at 3.2%. El Salvador and Mexico were the most common places of birth for the 10.7% of the residents who were born abroad. This is a low percentage of foreign-born when compared with the overall city or Los Angeles County.

The median household income in 2008 dollars was $45,865, considered average for the city but low for the county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less was high, compared to the county at large. The average household size of 2.2 people was low for both the city and the county. Renters occupied 54.1% of the housing units, and homeowners occupied the rest.

In 2000 there were 817 families headed by single parents, or 27.7%, a rate that was high for the city and the county. There were 990 veterans, or 11.1% of the population, considered high when compared with the city overall. The percentage of veterans who served in the Vietnam War was among the county&#x27;s highest.

==Arts and culture==
===Leimert Park Village===
The core of Leimert Park is Leimert Park Village, which consists of Leimert Plaza Park, two blocks of 43rd Street, and one block of Degnan Boulevard. Leimert Park Village has historically served as a hub of African-American art and culture in Los Angeles, has been compared to both Harlem and Greenwich Village, and in 1998 was seen as &quot;the cultural heartbeat of black Los Angeles.&quot; Leimert Plaza Park was designed by the Olmsted Brothers to serve as the public hub of the master planned community. The park has been a go-to community space for the African American community since the 1980s hosting art walks, a regular drum circle, annual celebrations, rallies, protests, and memorials.

The village has blues and jazz night clubs, theaters for musicals, dramatic performances, award ceremonies, comedy specials, and poetry readings, and venues for hip hop. The intersection of 43rd Street and Degnan Boulevard was dedicated as Barbara Morrison Square on the anniversary of her birth, September 10. 2022. Project Blowed is the longest-running hip hop open mic in the world, started in 1994 by rapper Aceyalone and friends. It is hosted by Kaos Network, and held every Thursday night at 43rd Place and Leimert Boulevard.

===Vision Theatre===
April 21, 2019, marked the 87th anniversary of the opening of the Vision Theatre (initially named the Leimert). This Mediterranean Revival Style theater is at the south end of Leimert Park Village at 3341 West Forty-Third place and Degnan Avenue. It was designed in 1931 by the architectural firm Morgan, Walls &amp; Clements and opened as a movie theater on April 21, 1932.

In 1977 the theater came under the ownership of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses known as the &quot;Assembly Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;. Actress Marla Gibbs bought the theater in 1990 and renamed it the Vision Theatre, intending to make it a venue for African-American movies, live theater, and dance productions. In 1992 the Los Angeles civil unrest and an economic recession hit the area hard, and the property fell into foreclosure. The City of Los Angeles acquired the theater in 1999. The Department of Cultural Affairs manages the theater with the goal of providing a performing arts venue for professional performing arts presentations; a training center for talent reflective of South Los Angeles; and a venue for the production and presentation of world-class theater, music, and dance performances.

The first phase of renovations to the Vision Theatre included upgrades to the lobbies, restrooms, office space, and classrooms in 2011. Phase II of the renovation began in March 2018. The rehabilitation of the remaining portions of the theater includes the historic refurbishment and expansion of the theater and auditorium, and the addition of an orchestra pit and a fly loft. The grand reopening of the Vision Theatre is planned for 2022.

===The Leimert Park Book Fair===
The Leimert Park Book Fair began in 2007 and attracts &quot;more than 200 authors, poets, spoken-word artists, storytellers and other participants.&quot;

===Destination Crenshaw===
Sankofa Park will anchor the northern end of Destination Crenshaw, an open-air museum of African American history and culture that will extend 1.3-miles (2.1 km) down Crenshaw Boulevard through the Hyde Park neighborhood.

===Juneteenth===
Juneteenth is commemorated with a street festival that brings together artists and residents for a day of fun and remembrance. The event celebrates the day in 1865 when the last enslaved African Americans were liberated. The celebration in Leimert Park dates back to 1949 when a new resident started hosting a barbeque in his backyard. He was surprised that it was not a popular tradition like it was in Texas. The celebration expanded and has been organized by Black Arts Los Angeles since 2009. During the 2020 celebration, the iconography of the Black Lives Matter movement, and images of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor were part of the celebration.

<doc id="1068850" wikidata="Q1269104" url="?curid=1068850" title="Dynamo Open Air">
<text>Dynamo Open Air is a festival in the Netherlands that was held (almost) every year between 1986 and 2005. It was reborn in 2008 as Dynamo Outdoor and in 2015 as Dynamo Metal Fest.

==History==
Originally held to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Dynamo rock club in Eindhoven, it grew from 5,000 people in the Dynamo parking lot up to 118,000 attendees in 1995. Until this day, the 1995 edition still is the largest multi-day open air festival ever held in the Netherlands. This caused too much pressure on the Dutch infrastructure and the festival had to shrink to a maximum of 60,000 visitors for 1996. From there it went downhill, mostly because the festival could not find a permanent venue. In 1999 Dynamo Open Air was held on a former rubbish dump in Mierlo, and the following year it went to the Goffertpark in Nijmegen. That was the first time DOA was held outside the province of North Brabant, and it was the first time in years that the festival had to shrink down to only one day. The previous years it had always been a two- or three-day festival.

In 2001, the organisation thought they had found a site where the festival could return on a yearly basis, near the town of Lichtenvoorde. However, the threat of foot-and-mouth disease caused trouble, and Dynamo Open Air had to be cancelled. In 2002 it returned, at the site of the Bospop festival, but 2003 was another year without a Dynamo festival, because it would violate a recently passed law about animal protection during breeding season. For 2004, the festival returned to Nijmegen, at the same location where it took place in 2000. In 2005, the festival used the site of the Dauwpop festival, and the reunited Anthrax headlined the stage.

In an attempt to revitalise the festival, the current organization of the Dynamo youth center decided to change the festival&#x27;s name from Dynamo Open Air to Dynamo Outdoor. In 2008, the first Dynamo Outdoor festival was held in the centre of Eindhoven, with bands such as Mad Sin, Anathema and Born From Pain performing. The festival was once again held in Eindhoven in the following year, with Destine, Stahlzeit, Asphyx, Textures, The Butcher and Municipal Waste on the bill.
The revival of the festival occurred with a new name as Dynamo Metal Fest, which has taken place every year since 2015. The festival had taken place traditionally on the second or third Saturday in July from 2015 to 2018; for the 2019 edition, it was converted into a two-day festival. After the 2020 edition was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dynamo Metal Fest was scheduled to return in August 2021, however again cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Dynamo Metal Fest was again held in August 2022.

===Live recordings===

In 1995, Nailbomb had their performance recorded at the festival and it was released as &quot;Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide&quot; the same year it was recorded. It was released by Roadrunner Records In 2005, live footage of the performance was released on DVD and it was called Live at Dynamo. It was also released by Roadrunner Records. In May 1998, guest band Death recorded stock footage of their performance. Three years later, in an effort to raise money to pay for Chuck Schuldiner&#x27;s cancer treatment, the footage was limitedly released in October 2001 by Nuclear Blast on CD and DVD formats under the name Live In Eindhoven, two months before Schuldiner&#x27;s ultimate demise.

<text>Ill Niño (Spanish for &quot;ill child&quot;; stylized as ill niño) is an American nu metal band formed in Union City, New Jersey, in 1998 by drummer Dave Chavarri, who is the sole remaining original member of the band. They have released seven studio albums, two EPs and one compilation album, totaling in over 1.3 million worldwide album sales.

==History==
===Early career===
Ill Niño was formed as El Niño by former Pro-Pain drummer David &quot;Dave&quot; Chavarri in May 1998. He enlisted Merauder vocalist Jorge Rosado, guitarist Daniel Gomez and bassist Christian Machado and took on the position of drummer and percussionist himself. With this line-up, the band released a self-titled EP. Gomez left the band soon after the EP&#x27;s release, with a variety of guitarists filling in his spot. Among them were future fulltime member Marc Rizzo, Scott Roberts of Biohazard and Derek Sykes of Demolition Hammer. Sykes also appears on the compilation album &quot;Métalo&quot;, released by Grita! Records in June 1999. By this time, the band had already renamed to Ill Niño. When Chavarri took over Roy Mayorga&#x27;s duties in Soulfly on the Bring Da Shit Tour in July 1999, Ill Niño was briefly put on hold. After he returned from tour, Chavarri decided to reform the band with a revamped lineup: Machado switched from bass to lead vocals and the two were joined by guitarists Marc Rizzo and Jardel Paisante, bassist Lazaro Pina and Roger Vasquez on additional percussions. They received exposure via the New Jersey metal college radio station WSOU, played the World Series of Metal festival in Ohio and, in the following year, opened for bands like Kittie, Soulfly and Snapcase. They also released a self-titled EP and were signed by Roadrunner Records in June 2000. With financial support secured, the recording for their debut album commenced in November 2000.

===Mainstream success===
On September 18, 2001, Ill Niño released their debut album, &quot;Revolution Revolución&quot;. The album peaked at No. 28 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and went on to sell over 350,000 albums worldwide in the first two years after release. In early 2003, just before Ill Niño was set to record the follow-up, the band parted ways with guitarist Marc Rizzo and percussionist Roger Vasquez. &quot;Confession&quot; was recorded in mid-2003 and released on September 30, 2003. It debuted at No. 37 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first week sales of 27,863. The lead single, &quot;How Can I Live&quot;, was their first single to break into the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, peaking at No. 26 on the Mainstream Rock chart.

The band&#x27;s third effort&quot;, One Nation Underground&quot;, was released on September 27, 2005 and debuted at No. 101 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts. On July 15, 2006, Ill Niño parted with Roadrunner Records and their guitarist Jardel Paisante. Just a week later, they signed a new deal with the recently formed Cement Shoes Records. Roadrunner released &quot;The Best of Ill Niño&quot; on September 12, 2006, as a contractual obligation to the label, and without the band&#x27;s consent or involvement.

Through Cement Shoes Records they released &quot;The Under Cover Sessions&quot;, an EP featuring three covers and two new songs, and &quot;Enigma&quot;, their fourth studio album, released in 2008 after multiple delays. The album sold 5,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at No. 145 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

In March 2010, Ill Niño signed with Victory Records. &quot;Dead New World&quot;, the band&#x27;s label debut, was released on October 25, 2010 and production was shared by Sahaj Ticotin and Clint Lowery of Sevendust. &quot;Epidemia&quot;, the band&#x27;s sixth album, was released on October 22, 2012. This was their last release to feature long-time percussionist Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Couto, who left the band in late 2013 and was replaced by Oscar Santiago. The band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Till Death La Familia&quot;, was released on July 22, 2014. Afterwards, they toured in support of the new album and embarked on a worldwide &quot;15 Years Of Revolution&quot; tour to celebrate the 15th anniversary of &quot;Revolution Revolución&quot; in 2016 and 2017.

===Fracture and lawsuit===
On January 15, 2019, Dave Chavarri announced that Cristian Machado, Ahrue Luster and Diego Verduzco had departed the band. They were replaced by Marcos Leal (Shattered Sun), Jes De Hoyos (Sons of Texas) and Salvadore Dominguez (ex-Upon a Burning Body), respectively. This occasion also saw the return of Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Couto on percussions. One day later, the three former members dismissed Chavarri&#x27;s public statement and assured the band&#x27;s fans that they had not departed the band, vowing to continue as &quot;Ill Niño&quot; instead.

On March 21, 2019, MetalSucks acquired a copy of the lawsuit paperwork filed by Machado, Luster and Verduzco accusing Chavarri of shady business deals, such as using his status as Ill Niño&#x27;s manager to scam the band into taking a financial loss while repaying a personal loan, falsifying financial documents in order to keep tens of thousands of dollars for himself, pocketing show guarantees and tour advances for himself, sometimes even canceling tours and then refusing to return the promoter&#x27;s advance, and refusing the band members their legally owed access to financial records among many other accusations.

===Settlement and continuation===
In March 2020, Chavarri, Pina, Machado, Luster and Verduzco reached a mutual agreement, allowing Chavarri and Pina to continue with the Ill Niño bandname. With the legal issues resolved, ex-Ill Niño members Machado, Luster and Verduzco went on to form a new band Lions at the Gate, and the new Ill Niño line-up began work on their eighth album and subsequently released a second single, &quot;Máscara&quot;, featuring AJ Channer from Fire from the Gods. At the same time, they announced the title of their next album, &quot;IllMortals&quot;. They also held a one-day event dubbed &quot;American Revolución&quot; on January 30, 2021, along with Fire From the Gods and Hyro the Hero. Also present as guests were former members of the band, such as Marc Rizzo, Jorge Rosado and Daniel Gomez. This marked the first time in over 18 years they performed with Ill Niño. On October 6, 2021, Rizzo revealed that he had rejoined Ill Niño as their permanent lead guitarist.

In an interview during the band&#x27;s spring 2022 tour, Dave Chavarri announced May 6 as the release date for the new album &quot;IllMortals&quot;. On that day, Ill Nino instead released a new single titled &quot;This Is Over&quot; and later announced June 10 as the album&#x27;s new release date. However, the album was again delayed for undisclosed reasons and remains unreleased. But on May 13, 2023, the band re-recorded the &quot;Numb&quot; song from their &quot;Confession&quot; album with new arrangements and lyrics changed by Leal, and its video clip has been posted on YouTube.

The band embarked on a 25th year anniversary tour in Europe; Tommy Vext filled in for Leal and Leal eventually announced his official departure from the band on September 24. Marc Rizzo also departed for the second time as well. Later that year, Marcos Leal accused the rest of the band for the multiple delays of the band&#x27;s plannned Illmortals EPs which would feature his vocals but as of now, remains unreleased, citing their &quot;incompetence&quot; as a reason for the delays. He also engaged in a harsh back and forth exchange of words with guitarist Jes DeHoyos on social media over his alleged contributions to the album.

<text>Iestyn Rhys Harris (born 25 June 1976) is a former dual-code international professional rugby league and rugby union footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s, and coach in rugby league in the 2000s and 2010s. He played representative rugby league for Great Britain and Wales, and at club level for the Warrington Wolves, the Leeds Rhinos (captain) where he won the 1998 Man of Steel Award, the Bradford Bulls (captain), and Featherstone Rovers, and representative rugby union for Wales, and at club level for Cardiff RFC and Cardiff Blues, and has coached representative rugby league for Wales, and at club level for Featherstone Rovers (assistant coach), the Crusaders Rugby League (initially as assistant coach under Brian Noble, and then head coach), the Wigan Warriors (assistant coach), and Salford Red Devils (head coach).

==Early life==
Harris was born in Oldham, Greater Manchester, England. His Abercarn-born grandfather Norman Harris played rugby union for Abercarn RFC, Ebbw Vale RFC, Pontypool RFC and Newbridge RFC before heading north to win eight Wales caps in rugby league.

==Early Rugby League career==
=== Warrington ===
Harris&#x27; professional career began with league club Warrington at age 17 in 1993 before a record-breaking £350,000 transfer to Leeds in 1997.

Iestyn Harris played at in Warrington&#x27;s 10–40 defeat by Wigan in the 1994–95 Regal Trophy Final during the 1994–95 season at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield on Saturday 28 January 1995.

===Leeds===
Harris was made captain of Leeds Rhinos in his first full season at the club at the age of twenty-one, and became the first Leeds captain in a decade to lift silverware when Leeds Rhinos claimed the 1999 Challenge Cup.

Harris initially played at before being switched to . In 1998, despite having played most of his games at fullback, he was named in the half backs in 1998&#x27;s Super League Dream Team and also collected the annual Man of Steel trophy as the best player in the Super League. He captained Leeds Rhinos from in their 1998 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Wigan Warriors.

A superb goal-kicker, Harris broke the club record for goals in a season in 1999 with 168, he was named at stand-off in 1999&#x27;s Super League IV Dream Team, and broke the 2,000 career points total two years later.

Harris matched the record for scoring the most points in a Challenge Cup Final when he scored 20 points (1 try, and 8 conversions) in Leeds&#x27; 52–16 victory over London Broncos in the 1999 Challenge Cup Final during Super League IV at Wembley Stadium, London on 1 May 1999. This equalled the record set by Neil Fox (2-tries and 7-goals) in Wakefield Trinity&#x27;s victory over Hull F.C. in the 1960 Challenge Cup Final.

==Cardiff and Wales RU==
In 2001, Harris made a £1.5 million switch to Cardiff RFC and Wales.

Harris made his debut for the Welsh side on 10 November 2001, playing against Argentina in Cardiff; Wales lost 16–30. Having played only 200 minutes of rugby union before his international debut, Harris struggled, particularly with his tactical kicking. This led to a move from fly-half to inside centre, where he could be creative with less pressure.

===World Cup 2003===
Harris played in the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia, where Wales lost in the quarter-finals to eventual winners, England, despite leading the game for 60 minutes. Harris won 25 Wales caps as a union player but made it clear that he wanted to return to League.

==Return to Rugby League==

===Bradford Bulls===
In 2004, Harris returned to rugby league, citing &quot;family reasons&quot;. He joined Bradford Bulls after a contractual fight with former club Leeds. His salary was reputed to be £1 million over 4 seasons. Harris played for the Bradford Bulls at in their 2004 Super League Grand Final loss against the Leeds Rhinos. Harris was selected in the Great Britain team to compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Australia he played at in the Lions&#x27; 44–4 loss.

Harris wrote a book, published in October 2005, detailing his moves between codes called &quot;Iestyn Harris: There and Back – My Journey from League to Union and Back Again&quot;. Harris was part of the 2005 Bradford Bulls squad that became the first side in the history of Super League to win the Grand Final when finishing third in the final league ladder. He played for the Bradford Bulls at , kicking a goal in their 2005 Super League Grand Final victory against Leeds Rhinos.

Harris was Bradford Bulls&#x27; captain for one year in 2006 taking over from Leeds-bound Jamie Peacock. As Super League champions Bradford Bulls faced National Rugby League premiers Wests Tigers in the 2006 World Club Challenge. Harris captained the Bradford Bulls from , kicking five goals from six attempts in their 30–10 victory. On 10 May 2006, Harris announced he would be retiring from playing international rugby league with Great Britain, just a week after being named in a 36-strong training squad for a June 2006 Test against New Zealand. Harris, who won the last of his 15 Great Britain caps against Australia in November 2005, said he wanted to concentrate on his club career. On 26 September 2006, he confirmed that he would continue to play for Wales, and was scheduled to return to the side against Scotland at the Brewery Field, Bridgend in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup qualifying match on Sunday 29 October 2006. He was forced to pull out through injury hours before kick-off. Harris kicked a club record 15 goals against Toulouse Olympique in a record 98–6 win on 19 April 2008. Harris had been linked to a player-coach role with Crusaders, but he decided to sign for National League One club Featherstone Rovers instead.

===Featherstone Rovers===
Harris signed a 2-year deal at Featherstone Rovers, as well as playing, he also took his first steps into coaching and working in the marketing department of the club, he made his debut for Featherstone Rovers on Sunday 15 February 2009, he also ultimately made a lot of debt for Bradford Bulls, and he played his last match for Featherstone Rovers during the 2009 season. On announcement of his tenure as assistant coach to Brian Noble at Celtic Crusaders, he agreed termination of his contract at Featherstone Rovers and an immediate end to his playing career.

==Coaching career==

===Wales National Rugby League team===
While still playing for Bradford, Harris was appointed Wales Assistant Coach on 18 June 2008. On 22 September 2009, Harris was appointed Wales&#x27;s rugby league head coach, succeeding John Dixon. Appointed alongside Harris were the more experienced Kevin Ellis and Clive Griffiths, and the trio&#x27;s first match was against England on 17 October, which they lost 48–12.

Wales qualified for the 2011 Rugby League Four Nations, and therefore won the Tournament&#x27;s co-hosting rights with England. Unfortunately, as expected, Wales lost all of games, but they put up great fights. They lost by 42–4 against England, but they played well against the Kiwis at Wembley Stadium in London. Wales lost by 36–0, but New Zealand were frustrated by not being able to play their attacking football full of flair, and this was due to Harris&#x27; team&#x27;s good defence. Then surprisingly, in Wales&#x27; (and Welsh legend Lee Briers last game of his international career) final game of the Tournament, Wales shocked all odds, as they had an early 8–0 lead, against world heavyweights Australia, after 14 minutes. It took Australia until just before half-time to take the lead. Harris&#x27; men would then go on to lose the game 56–14, but he still gave Lee Briers a fitting farewell.

Iestyn coached Wales in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup held in their own country and fellow British nation England. Unfortunately Iestyn&#x27;s side didn&#x27;t get a single win at the event, and they gave history to each of the teams that defeated them. Italy won their first World Cup match in their first appearance, USA in their annual tournament advanced to the quarter-final, and the Cook Islands won their first ever World Cup match.

On 9 April 2014, Harris resigned from the Wales post, after taking up the head coaching role at the Super League club, the Salford Red Devils.

===Crusaders Rugby League===
On 14 October 2009, Harris was announced as assistant coach to Brian Noble at Wales-based Crusaders Rugby League, alongside Jon Sharp. After a year as assistant it was announced in November 2010 that Harris would take over as head coach of Crusaders following the resignation of Brian Noble. His first official game in charge was against Salford on Sunday 13 February 2011 in the opening round of the Super League. The game was played at the Millennium Stadium as part of the Magic Weekend.

===Wigan Warriors===
In 2011, Harris became the assistant coach at former club Wigan.

===Salford Red Devils===
In 2014, it was announced by Marwan Koukash that Harris would take over from Brian Noble as head coach at Salford Red Devils. The appointment was described as a &quot;huge gamble&quot;. In Harris&#x27; first match in charge, Salford played away from home and defeated Bradford Bulls by 38–24.

In September 2015, after being absent from the club for two months, Salford mutually sacked Harris from his post as head coach of the club.

==Media career==
Iestyn regularly provides expert TV and radio analysis including BBC&#x27;s Super League Show, and contributes to BBC Radio Five Live&#x27;s rugby league coverage.

==Author==

<doc id="1068876" wikidata="Q2628185" url="?curid=1068876" title="Cranachan">
<text>Cranachan ( ) is a traditional Scottish dessert. It was originally a celebration of harvest, made following the raspberry harvest in August. The dessert of cream and fresh seasonal raspberries is bolstered by Scottish oats and whisky. It has been called &#x27;the uncontested king of Scottish desserts&#x27;. Cranachan owes its origins to crowdie, a popular breakfast in which crowdie cheese is combined with lightly toasted oatmeal, cream, and local honey. Raspberries, when in season, might be added to the dish.

Cranachan is now served all year round, and typically on special occasions. A traditional way to serve cranachan is to bring dishes of each ingredient to the table so that each person can assemble their own dessert to taste.

==Recipes ==
There are many versions of this traditional Scottish pudding. Earlier recipes used crowdie cheese instead of, or in addition to cream and were sometimes called cream-crowdie. Other earlier recipes are more austere, omitting the whisky and treating the fruit as an optional extra. More modern recipes have swapped the crowdie cheese for a simple whipped cream. Modern recipes usually are made from a mixture of double cream, whisky, honey and fresh raspberries, with toasted oatmeal soaked overnight in a little drop of whisky. Tall dessert glasses are often used to serve.

Alternative versions of the recipe include orange cranachan, cranachan trifle, spiced rum, and shortbread round. For spiced rum cranachan the rum mixture is folded in with whipped cream and placed on top of the shortbread and then the raspberries are added. Whisky-soaked raisins can be used if raspberries are unavailable. Chocolate cranachan can be made with chopped toasted hazelnuts, light muscovado sugar and chocolate.

<doc id="1068910" wikidata="Q120056" url="?curid=1068910" title="List of Washington state parks">
<text>The U.S. state of Washington has over 140 state parks that are managed by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission. These include 19 marine parks and 11 Historical Parks.
The park system was established in 1913 by the creation of the Washington State Board of Park Commissioners. The first two parks were formed from donated land in 1915, and by 1929 the state had seven parks. In 1947 the State Parks Committee was renamed to the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission and given authority to oversee the state park system. By 1960 the number of state parks had increased to 130.

In 2003, the Washington State Legislature introduced a $5-a-day parking fee, meant to fund park-related construction projects; more than a quarter of the fees collected went into the fee-collection system itself. Park use decreased more than 15% under the fees. The fee was rescinded in early 2006, returning the state park system to its status of the only system in the West without day-use fees. In 2011 the legislature enacted a $10 day-use permit and a $30 annual pass, called the Discover Pass, for vehicles to enter state parks, lands owned or managed by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and designated lands of the Washington Department of Natural Resources. Funds generated from the sale of the Discover Pass are deposited into the Recreation Access Pass Account. The new fees did not raise as much money as was hoped, though another effort to encourage donation when renewing certain state licenses (including driver&#x27;s licenses) was more successful than officials expected.

<doc id="1068912" wikidata="Q1753160" url="?curid=1068912" title="Mercedonius">
<text>Mercedonius (Latin for &quot;Work Month&quot;), also known as Mercedinus, Interkalaris or Intercalaris (), was the intercalary month of the Roman calendar. The resulting leap year was either 377 or 378 days long. It theoretically occurred every two (or occasionally three) years, but was sometimes avoided or employed by the Roman pontiffs for political reasons regardless of the state of the solar year. Mercedonius was eliminated by Julius Caesar when he introduced the Julian calendar in 45 BC.

==History==
This month, instituted according to Roman tradition by Numa Pompilius, was supposed to be inserted every two or three years to align the conventional 355-day Roman year with the solar year.

The decision of whether to insert the intercalary month was made by the pontifex maximus, supposedly based on observations to ensure the best possible correspondence with the seasons.
However, the pontifex maximus would normally be an active politician, and the decision would often be manipulated to allow friends to stay in office longer or force enemies out early. Such unpredictable intercalation meant that dates following the month of Februarius could not be known in advance, and further to this, Roman citizens living outside Rome would often not know the current date.

The exact mechanism is not clearly specified in ancient sources. Some scholars
hold that in intercalary years February&#x27;s length was fixed at 23 days and it was followed by a variable-length with 27 or 28 days. This view is followed in generalist surveys of calendrical history.

However, following a discussion of intercalation by Michels (1967) some specialist studies of the pre-Julian calendar published since 1967 claim that in intercalary years Februarius was set at either 23 or 24 days, which was followed by an intercalary month of 27 days.

Whichever interpretation is correct, the days to , normally referring to the end of February, were in intercalary years the concluding days of the .

The month was eliminated by Julius Caesar with his revised calendar in 45 BC.

<doc id="1068915" wikidata="Q2647226" url="?curid=1068915" title="Februarius">
<text>Februarius, fully Mensis Februarius (&quot;month of Februa&quot;), was the shortest month of the Roman calendar from which the Julian and Gregorian month of February derived. It was eventually placed second in order, preceded by &quot;Ianuarius&quot; (&quot;month of Janus&quot;, January) and followed by &quot;Martius&quot; (&quot;month of Mars&quot;, March). In the oldest Roman calendar, which the Romans believed to have been instituted by their legendary founder Romulus, March was the first month, and the calendar year had only ten months in all. &quot;Ianuarius&quot; and &quot;Februarius&quot; were supposed to have been added by Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, originally at the end of the year. It is unclear when the Romans reset the course of the year so that January and February came first.

&quot;Februarius&quot; was the only month in the pre-Julian calendar to have an even number of days, numbering 28. This was mathematically necessary to permit the year itself to have an odd number of days. Ancient sources derived &quot;Februarius&quot; from &quot;februum&quot;, a thing used for ritual purification. Most of the observances in this month concerned the dead or closure, reflecting the month&#x27;s original position at the end of the year. The Parentalia was a nine-day festival honoring the ancestors and propitiating the dead, while the Terminalia was a set of rituals pertaining to boundary stones that was probably also felt to reinforce the boundary of the year.

==In the agricultural year==
Many Roman festivals and religious observances reflect the Romans&#x27; agrarian way of life in their early history. In his treatise on farming, Varro divides the agricultural year into eight phases, with Spring beginning officially on February 7, when Favonius the west wind was thought to start blowing favorably and it was time to ready the fields. The grain fields were to be weeded, vineyards tended, and old reeds burned. Some kinds of trees were pruned, and attention was given to olive and fruit trees.

The agricultural writer Columella says that meadows and grain fields are &quot;purged&quot; &quot;(purguntur)&quot;, probably both in the practical sense of clearing away old debris and by means of ritual. The duties of February thus suggest the close bond between agriculture and religion in Roman culture. According to the farmers&#x27; almanacs, the tutelary deity of the month was Neptune.

==Dates==

The Romans did not number days of a month sequentially from the 1st through the last day. Instead, they counted back from the three fixed points of the month: the Nones (5th or 7th, depending on the length of the month), the Ides (13th or 15th), and the Kalends (1st) of the following month. The Nones of February was the 5th, and the Ides the 13th. The last day of February was the &quot;pridie Kalendas Martias,&quot; &quot;day before the Kalends of March&quot;. Roman counting was inclusive; February 9 was &quot;ante diem V Idūs Februarias,&quot; &quot;the 5th day before the Ides (13th) of February,&quot; usually abbreviated &quot;a.d. V Id. Feb.&quot; (or with the &quot;a.d.&quot; omitted altogether); February 23 was &quot;VI Kal. Mart.&quot;, &quot;the 6th day before the Kalends of March.&quot;

February had one and possibly two moveable feasts &quot;(feriae conceptivae)&quot;. The Amburbium (&quot;City Circuit&quot;) was a purification of the whole city with no fixed date, but seems to have been held in February. The Fornacalia (&quot;Oven Festival&quot;) was celebrated by the thirty ancient divisions of the Roman people known as &quot;curiae&quot;. Each &quot;curia&quot; celebrated a festival separately under its own leader &quot;(curio)&quot; on various days following the Nones. These dates were established and publicized by the &quot;curio maximus&quot;, the chief &quot;curio&quot;. Anyone who missed the Fornacalia celebrated by his own &quot;curia,&quot; or who didn&#x27;t know his &quot;curia,&quot; could attend a public festival which was always held as the concluding ceremony on February 17. The Fornacalia overlapped with the festival of the ancestral dead that dominated the month, and on its last day coincided with the Quirinalia, a day also known as the Feast of Fools &quot;(feriae stultorum)&quot;. &quot;Februarius&quot; was thus such a religiously complex month that during the Julian reform of the calendar, when days were added to some months, it was left as it had been, even though it was the shortest month.

Each day was marked with a letter to denote its status under religious law. In the month of February:

* F for &quot;dies fasti&quot;, days when it was legal to initiate action in the courts of civil law;
* C for &quot;dies comitalis,&quot; a day on which the Roman people could hold assemblies &quot;(comitia)&quot;, elections, and certain kinds of judicial proceedings;
* N for &quot;dies nefasti&quot;, when these political activities and the administration of justice were prohibited;
* NP, the meaning of which remains elusive, but which marked &quot;feriae&quot;, public holidays;
* EN for &quot;endotercissus&quot;, an archaic form of &quot;intercissus&quot;, &quot;cut in half,&quot; meaning days that were &quot;nefasti&quot; in the morning, when sacrifices were being prepared, and in the evening, while sacrifices were being offered, but were &quot;fasti&quot; in the middle of the day.

By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show days marked with these letters, probably in part as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius. Days were also marked with nundinal letters in cycles of &quot;A B C D E F G H&quot;, to mark the &quot;market week&quot; (these are omitted on the table below).

On a &quot;dies religiosus&quot;, individuals were not to undertake any new activity, nor do anything other than tend to the most basic necessities. On the calendar under the Republic, a &quot;dies natalis&quot; was an anniversary such as a temple founding or rededication, sometimes thought of as the &quot;birthday&quot; of a deity. During the Imperial period, some of the traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important, and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays. On the calendar of military religious observances known as the &quot;Feriale Duranum&quot;, sacrifices pertaining to Imperial cult outnumber the older festivals.

Festivals marked in large letters on extant &quot;fasti&quot;, represented by festival names in all capital letters on the table, are thought to have been the most ancient holidays, becoming part of the calendar before 509 BC. After the mid-1st century AD, a number of dates are added to calendars for spectacles and games &quot;(circenses)&quot; held in honor of various deities in the venue called a &quot;circus&quot;.

Unless otherwise noted, the dating and observances on the following table are from H.H. Scullard, &quot;Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic&quot; (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 69–84.

<text>Carl William Demarest (February 27, 1892 – December 28, 1983) was an American actor, known especially for his supporting roles in screwball comedies by Preston Sturges and as Uncle Charley in the sitcom &quot;My Three Sons&quot; from 1965-72. Demarest, who frequently played crusty but good-hearted roles, was a prolific film and television actor, appearing in over 140 films, beginning in 1926 and ending in the late 1970s. Before his career in movies, he performed in vaudeville for two decades.

==Early life==
Carl William Demarest was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the youngest of three sons of Wilhelmina (née Lindgren) and Samuel Demarest. During William&#x27;s infancy, the family moved to New Bridge, a hamlet in Bergen County, New Jersey. He served in the U.S. Army during World War I.

== Career ==
Demarest started in show business working in vaudeville, performing initially in his youth with his two older brothers and later with his wife Estelle Collette (real name Esther Zichlin) as &quot;Demarest and Colette&quot;. He then moved to work on Broadway, and by 1926 also began working in films. By the 1940s he was a member of an informal troupe of actors whom director Preston Sturges often featured in his screwball comedies, appearing in 10 films written by Sturges, eight of which were under his direction. Among these he had prominent roles in &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;, &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot;, and &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Demarest was such a familiar figure at the Paramount studio that just his name was used in the movie &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; as a potential star for William Holden&#x27;s unsold baseball screenplay.

In 1951 Demarest had a featured role in &quot;The Strip&quot; opposite Mickey Rooney as a philosophic nightclub owner and pianist fronting for a band composed of Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, Barney Bigard, Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines, and Rooney himself on drums.

He played folksy Jeb Gaine, an occasional sidekick to the main character, in the 1961–62 season of the Western series &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;.

Demarest appeared as Police Chief Aloysius of the Santa Rosita Police Department in the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963) and in 1964 he co-starred in an episode originally aired in the final season of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s in the Box&quot;), portraying a hen-pecked husband who murders his wife, played by Joan Blondell. Several years later, Blondell and Demarest reunited on an episode of &quot;My Three Sons&quot;.

His most famous television role was in the sitcom &quot;My Three Sons&quot; from 1965 to 1972, playing Uncle Charley O&#x27;Casey. He replaced William Frawley, who was in failing health. Demarest had worked with Fred MacMurray previously in the films &quot;Hands Across the Table&quot; (1935), &quot;Pardon My Past&quot; (1945), &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Far Horizons&quot; (1955) and was a personal friend.

==Awards==
Demarest received a single Academy Award nomination for his supporting role in &quot;The Jolson Story&quot; (1946), playing Al Jolson&#x27;s fictional mentor. He shared the screen with the real Al Jolson in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;.

Demarest also received an Emmy nomination for the 1968–1969 season of &quot;My Three Sons&quot; as Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Role.

Demarest has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to motion pictures, bestowed upon him on August 8, 1979 by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. In attendance at the ceremony and then later at Musso &amp; Frank Grill for celebrations were his &quot;My Three Sons&quot; co-stars Fred MacMurray and his wife June Haver, Tina Cole, Stanley Livingston, Barry Livingston, and Dawn Lyn.

In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

==Personal life==
Demarest was married twice. His first wife was his vaudeville partner Estelle Collette, born Esther Zichlin. Demarest helped raise her daughter, author Phyllis Gordon Demarest, from her earlier marriage, in 1907, to English poet and novelist Samuel Gordon, who had divorced Zichlin before his death. Demarest&#x27;s second wife was Lucille Thayer, born Lucille Theurer, whom he married in Prescott, Arizona, on August 31, 1942. Thayer, who later became an activist on health issues in the motion picture industry, was appointed California&#x27;s lay-chairman of the American Nurses Association in October 1960.

==Death==
Demarest died at his home in Palm Springs, California on December 28, 1983, and his body was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

<text>Ivan Shamiakin (, 30 January 1921 – 14 October 2004) was a Soviet Belarusian writer, perhaps one of the most prolific of the BSSR, writing in a socialist realist style.

He was born in 1921 in the village of Karma, Gomel Region, Belarus, studied construction engineering in a vocational school in 1940, then fought in World War II, taking part in battles near Murmansk and in Poland. After the war he studied at the Homel Pedagogical University, worked as an editor and had different Communist Party positions in the local party offices in Belarus.
In 1958 Shamiakin, along with some other Belarusian writers, took part in the anti-Boris Pasternak campaign. In 1991 he confessed that he had never been familiar with Pasternak and never read &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, but had followed in the steps of older comrades. Shamiakin also mentioned Pasternak&#x27;s &quot;typically Jewish cowardice&quot;.

In 1963 Shamiakin worked at the United Nations as part of the Belarusian UN delegation. In 1980 he became the chief editor of the Byelorussian Soviet Encyclopedia and remained in this position until 1992. In 1994 he became the academician of the National Academy of Sciences.

<doc id="1068940" wikidata="Q2478017" url="?curid=1068940" title="Seven and the Ragged Tiger">
<text>Seven and the Ragged Tiger is the third studio album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released on 21 November 1983 through EMI and Capitol Records. Co-produced by Alex Sadkin, Ian Little and the band, recording sessions took place in France, the Caribbean and Australia between April and October 1983 following Duran Duran&#x27;s decision to record outside the UK as tax exiles. Unlike their previous two studio albums, the sessions were marred by a lack of productivity and tensions rose between the band members over its direction.

Wanting a change in direction from their previous album &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; is a synth-pop and dance-driven record, with emphasis on synthesiser-based textures. The lyrics are ambiguous and cover a variety of topics; lead vocalist Simon Le Bon described the album as &quot;an adventure story about a little commando team&quot;. The title refers to the five band members and their two managers; the &quot;ragged tiger&quot; means success. The cover artwork was shot at the State Library of New South Wales and designed by Malcolm Garrett.

The album received poor critical reviews but was a commercial success, becoming the band&#x27;s first and only UK number one album. It also charted at number eight in the US, eventually going double platinum. It yielded three singles: &quot;Union of the Snake&quot;, &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; and a remix of &quot;The Reflex&quot; by Nile Rodgers, a UK and US number one. Duran Duran supported the album with a worldwide concert tour that yielded several concert films and a live album. It was the last studio album with the original lineup until 2004&#x27;s &quot;Astronaut&quot;. In later decades, &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; has received mixed reactions, with critics finding weaker songwriting compared to their first two records. It was reissued by EMI in 2010.

==Background==
By 1983, Duran Duran had established themselves as one of the most successful bands in the world. They were negatively received by the press and their musical peers but enjoyed commercial success following the release of &quot;Rio&quot; (1982): the non-album single &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; spent three weeks at number one in the United Kingdom in March 1983. Capitol Records also reissued the band&#x27;s 1981 self-titled debut album in the United States with an updated sleeve photo and replacing &quot;To the Shore&quot; with the new single to capitalise on its success. Duran Duran underwent an exhaustive press tour and live performances for &quot;Rio&quot; from March to April before recording commenced on their third studio album.

==Recording history==
===French sessions===
At the decision of their managers, Paul and Michael Berrow, Duran Duran opted to spend a year away from the UK as tax exiles to avoid paying the high tax rates successful British musicians were required to pay. To record their third studio album, the band moved into a three-story château in Valbonne, France on the Côte d&#x27;Azur in April 1983, utilising the 24-track RAK Mobile recording truck rented from RAK Studios in North London. According to author Stephen Davis, the idea was for work to ensue amidst the lavender-scented hills above the city. This attracted tabloid criticism. In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; in 1995, bassist John Taylor stated:

Duran Duran escaped some of the large media hype surrounding them, which their photographer Denis O&#x27;Regan attributed to the château&#x27;s relaxed atmosphere. The band had ended their partnership with Colin Thurston, the producer of their first two albums, so Ian Little, the co-producer of &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot;, was brought in to produce the sessions. At the château, the instruments were set up in a large empty room upstairs and wired to the recording equipment outside, forcing the musicians to travel back and forth in between takes to verify it was taping properly. The group worked on demos and ideas for three months. Like their previous albums, the rhythm tracks were recorded first, with lyrics written and taped at a later date.

The sessions commenced slowly due to a lack of new material; John Taylor said that all their material had been used up for the first two albums. The musicians were burned out, so creativity was low. Little later verified that &quot;nothing had been written in advance, so the biggest starting point they&#x27;d ever have would be another song&quot;. Workdays did not start until 4 p.m. due to the antics of the band members, particularly John, and only lasted a couple of hours. The musicians briefly went to Cannes to visit the music video set of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Still Standing&quot;, directed by Duran Duran&#x27;s own video director Russell Mulcahy. On several occasions, the band members individually flew back to the UK for other commitments. Reflecting in his 2008 memoir, guitarist Andy Taylor stated that &quot;it was the start of the megadamage&quot; due to the acceleration of his and John Taylor&#x27;s cocaine addictions.

Throughout the recording days, Duran Duran primarily wrote through jam sessions, receiving feedback from Little on which parts were worth developing further. The producer gave the band a songwriting method he had learned working with Roxy Music&#x27;s Bryan Ferry and Phil Manzanera, wherein he would create a groove using a programmed drum with effects on top. Little explained: &quot;Bryan would then vamp on the keyboard and produce what he called a &#x27;moody synth&#x27; sound, which was like a pad sound with plenty of movement and character. That would enable him to get a lot of feeling out of a couple of chords, and Duran Duran did the same thing.&quot; Using the method, the group yielded what author Steve Malins called several &quot;embryonic ideas&quot;, a demo of &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; and an unreleased track titled &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;, parts of which evolved into &quot;The Seventh Stranger&quot;. According to John Taylor, sketches of the tracks &quot;Of Crime and Passion&quot;, &quot;(I&#x27;m Looking For) Cracks in the Pavement&quot;, &quot;I Take the Dice&quot; and &quot;Spidermouse&quot;, which became &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot;, were devised during their time in France.

===Caribbean sessions===

As a means to increase concentration amid tabloid scrutiny and paparazzi bombardment, Duran Duran relocated to George Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios on the Caribbean island of Montserrat to resume recording. In his memoir, John Taylor says the group viewed a BBC documentary chronicling the recording of the Police&#x27;s &quot;Synchronicity&quot; (1983) at AIR and felt it would be a good fit for Duran Duran. EMI believed Little&#x27;s inexperience as a producer was slowing down progress and brought in Alex Sadkin to replace Little. Sadkin, the mixer of &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot;, felt Little was important to the band&#x27;s writing process and insisted he stay. Little later said he contributed several ideas despite not receiving any writing credits on the finished album.

Duran Duran spent five to six weeks recording in Montserrat, engineered by Peter Wade-Schwier. Tracks produced at AIR included &quot;The Reflex&quot; and &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; by mid-June 1983, as well as the chorus of &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot;. Chic backing vocalists Michelle Cobbs and B. J. Nelson were flown in from New York City to provide backing vocals for &quot;The Reflex&quot;. The group encountered both personal and technical problems at AIR, such as tape machines that failed to run at the correct speeds; the production crew were passed off as &quot;whiny and unprofessional&quot; when they complained to the local studio engineers. The band&#x27;s massive success led to rising tensions between the members. Additionally, keyboardist Nick Rhodes collapsed one day and had to be airlifted to a hospital in Miami, Florida after suffering from paroxysmal tachycardia, or an abnormally fast heartbeat. With a deadline of a Christmas release, Andy Taylor remembered the band members being worried that the album would not be delivered on time. 

On 20 July 1983, Duran Duran briefly halted the sessions to play at the Prince&#x27;s Trust concert with Dire Straits at the Dominion Theatre in London, with Prince Charles and Princess Diana in attendance. Having not performed live in several months, Duran Duran were under-rehearsed, leading to a poor performance amidst technical problems, but spoke briefly with the royal couple afterwards. A photograph taken of Diana with singer Simon Le Bon, John Taylor and Andy Taylor made headlines the following day. Three days later, the band played a charity concert at Aston Villa&#x27;s football stadium, Villa Park, in Birmingham before returning to Montserrat.

Upon their return to Montserrat, Steve Sutherland of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; visited the sessions to check on progress. According to Malins, the band played him eight new songs &quot;in various states of disarray&quot;. Sutherland predicted &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; would be the first single, while opining that &quot;[&#x27;The Reflex&#x27;] is sharper and more brutal than anything they&#x27;ve recorded before&quot;. The writer was informed by Sadkin that the album was far from completion amidst the studio&#x27;s technical problems. Sadkin had a hard time producing the record overall and later said he was surprised at how little material the band had.

===Australian sessions===
With tensions rising in Montserrat, Duran Duran changed recording locations again, settling in Sydney, Australia at the end of August 1983 as they felt their relationship with the country was special following their previous tours and commercial success there. Throughout September, the band recorded and mixed the rest of the album, now called &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;, at Studios 301. The studio was reportedly inferior to AIR, but superior to the mobile studio in France; the producers found technical problems could be resolved more easily. Phil Thornalley, Sadkin&#x27;s personal engineer, assumed the role for these sessions.
With the majority of the rhythm tracks cut, the band used 301 to record lyrics, synthesiser and guitar overdubs, and Andy Hamilton&#x27;s saxophone parts. Le Bon, suffering from writer&#x27;s block, composed melody lines after listening back to the rhythm parts and wrote lyrics based on those later. Little felt that he was the &quot;least involved&quot; and the &quot;least active&quot; of the five members. Rhodes used a new Fairlight CMI digital sampling synthesiser to help change the band&#x27;s sound, as he wanted &quot;Seven&quot; to be a more &quot;sophisticated pop album full of minutiae and multiple textures&quot;.

Other members also experimented during the sessions: John Taylor utilised a different technique for his bass playing, playing fewer notes as a way to &quot;get more feel&quot; out of the instrument; drummer Roger Taylor worked with Sadkin to create a more natural sound compared to the &quot;machine-like, rigid beats&quot; of the first two albums; and Andy Taylor used a more melodic style of playing compared to his, in Malins&#x27; words, &quot;usual cut-and-thrust&quot;. Rafael de Jesus and Mark Kennedy contributed percussion, which Malins felt created a &quot;more exciting, dynamic foundation for the songs&quot;. The tracks went through different versions regularly. At this point, the members grew tired of the album&#x27;s long recording process and tensions rose over its direction. Andy Taylor later described its recording as a &quot;laborious plod&quot;, while Rhodes said:

Sadkin and Rhodes discarded several of the rhythm tracks during mixing and received pushback from John Taylor and Andy Taylor over rerecording their parts. Reflecting in his memoir, John Taylor acknowledged the period as the beginning of a split in the band that only grew worse over the next year. Alongside growing tensions in the studio, the players were forced to relocate from their hotels due to bombardment from fans. Rhodes and Sadkin ultimately worked 15-hour days with Little to mix &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;, extending into October 1983. By the time the first single, &quot;Union of the Snake&quot;, was being mixed, Rhodes and Sadkin only had 24 hours to write and record its B-side, &quot;Secret Oktober&quot;, which Malins describes as a &quot;moody electronic-carousel&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
Commentators have recognised &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; as a departure from Duran Duran&#x27;s previous albums. Richard Buskin of &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; observed more of a &quot;synth-dance sound&quot;, while author Annie Zaleski wrote that &quot;Seven&quot; is &quot;indebted less to guitar-driven post-punk and more the sleeker synth-pop sounds popular at the time&quot;. Writing for AllMusic, Mike DeGagne found that the album&#x27;s content has the band &quot;moving ever so slightly into a danceclub arena&quot;, with &quot;their ability to produce a sexier sound&quot; favouring electronics and instrumentation over &quot;a firm lyrical and musical partnership&quot;. Malins agrees, referring to &quot;Seven&quot; as a &quot;very detailed, technology-based record&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason described the opening track, &quot;The Reflex&quot;, as sounding like &quot;an underwritten exercise in art-funk&quot;, drawing comparisons to &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;Hold Back the Rain&quot;. &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; and &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; showcase the band&#x27;s influences: the former echoes Roxy Music, while the latter was based on the bass drum pattern for David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983). Malins finds the up-tempo tracks &quot;Of Crime and Passion&quot; and &quot;Shadows on Your Side&quot; evoke feelings of insomnia and hysteria. Davis describes &quot;(I&#x27;m Looking For) Cracks in the Pavement&quot; as sounding like an homage to the Police with a &quot;carnival vibe&quot;. &quot;Seven&quot; also features an atmospheric, electronic-based instrumental called &quot;Tiger Tiger&quot;, dubbed by Davis a &quot;pastoral drone, evoking a jungle painted by Rousseau with hidden tribes playing rattles and sticks&quot;. The final track, &quot;The Seventh Stranger&quot;, Malins and Davis deem a &quot;moody finale&quot; and a &quot;tepid ballad&quot;, respectively.

Le Bon described &quot;Seven&quot; as &quot;an adventure story about a little commando team&quot;. The album&#x27;s lyrics are ambiguous and cover a variety of topics, including the dark side of fame the band were experiencing (&quot;Shadows on Your Side&quot;), living based on instinct (&quot;The Reflex&quot;), being pulled by an undertow (&quot;Of Crime and Passion&quot;) and changing identities as a means of escape (&quot;The Seventh Stranger&quot;). According to Malins, most of the tracks, particularly &quot;Union of the Snake&quot;, &quot;I Take the Dice&quot;, &quot;Shadows on Your Side&quot; and &quot;(I&#x27;m Looking For) Cracks in the Pavement&quot;, portray a character in a &quot;manic, slightly deranged state&quot;. In &quot;Union of the Snake&quot;, the words visualise a dreamlike revolution led by music, and &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; presents a character&#x27;s attempt to flatter a shy potential lover. Davis says the lyrics took influence from Le Bon&#x27;s relationship uncertainties and &quot;romantic ambivalences&quot; with his then-girlfriend.

==Title and packaging==
The album&#x27;s title was devised by Le Bon and taken from the unreleased track of the same name. The &quot;seven&quot; refers to the five band members and their two managers, while the &quot;ragged tiger&quot; is success: &quot;Seven people running after success. It&#x27;s ambition. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s about.&quot; Rhodes disliked the title, stating in 1983: &quot;It seems to me like the name of a kids&#x27; book, not so much the Famous Five, more sort of piratey.&quot; According to Malins, the keyboardist still refers to the LP simply as &quot;the third album&quot;.

The album cover was shot at the State Library of New South Wales during a photoshoot with the photographer Rebecca Blake. Sleeve designer Malcolm Garrett was flown in from the UK, as well as a live Bengal tiger from Melbourne to be pictured on both the album cover and upcoming tour programme. Surrounded by crew members, local journalists, TV cameramen and fans, Duran Duran were dressed in all-black attire: Rhodes donned a &quot;black lizard suit&quot;, John Taylor and Roger Taylor in &quot;evening dress&quot;, while Le Bon and Andy Taylor wore suede and leather; John Taylor later quipped in his memoir that &quot;we all looked like successful young men&quot;. The shoot reportedly cost upwards of £65,000 (). 

According to Paul Berrow, the plan was to shoot a promo in Kashmir involving the tiger but Andy Taylor and Rhodes vetoed the idea. Another idea involving the use of smoke bombs was scrapped when the tiger was spooked by them. Garrett&#x27;s final sleeve design solely features the tiger&#x27;s eye and a small portion of its fur. Against the caramel-coloured artwork are various logos, including the band&#x27;s new D&quot;D&quot; logo, a crescent moon, a triple-X glyph and a Chinese-style antique map depicting snowy mountains and rivers; Davis says this represents the trips Duran Duran ventured on during their upcoming tour. Malins finds the map suggests secrets that are waiting to be unfolded, offering a visual representation of Le Bon&#x27;s &quot;soul-searching on the album through [the] admittedly ambiguous lyrics&quot;.

==Release and singles==
The music video for &quot;Union of the Snake&quot;, featuring the band members in a cave with serpent-like dancers and Le Bon as leather-wearing road warrior, was sent to MTV by Capitol a full week before the single was set to release to radio, drawing pushback from radio stations who found the move unfair. According to John Taylor, the band expressed distaste for the video. Upon its release as a single on 17 October 1983, &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; peaked at number three in both the UK and the US. Following the number one debut of &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot;, the group&#x27;s failure to hit number one led some critics to conclude Duran Duran had hit their peak.

&quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; was released a month later on 21 November 1983, shortly after the band commenced a worldwide tour. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, becoming the band&#x27;s first album to top the chart, although sales fell off more quickly than EMI had expected. When it debuted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, both &quot;Rio&quot; and the reissued &quot;Duran Duran&quot; were still high on the chart. It reached number eight and within months achieved platinum status with sales of one million units, eventually going double platinum. Elsewhere, &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; topped the charts in the Netherlands and New Zealand, and it reached number two in Australia, three in Finland, seven in Canada, 11 in Austria, 12 in Italy, 14 in Norway, 16 in Switzerland, 17 in Germany and 19 in Sweden.

&quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; was issued as the second single on 23 January 1984, backed by a remix of &quot;Tiger Tiger&quot;. Its ambitious video, directed by Mulcahy&#x27;s colleague Brian Grant, contained images of a medieval French town and was shot during a two-day shoot in Paris before the tour resumed in Japan. Hated by the band members, the video received heavy airplay on MTV. The single itself stalled at number nine in the UK and number ten in the US. With both singles performing below the label&#x27;s expectations, EMI executives grew concerned that Sadkin lacked the skill to produce a successful single for Duran Duran.
While in Australia on tour, John Taylor heard a prerelease copy of the INXS single &quot;Original Sin&quot;, produced by Chic member Nile Rodgers and engineered by Jason Corsaro, and felt a remix of &quot;The Reflex&quot; would perform well as a single. For the remix, Rodgers made the song more dance-oriented, adding looping vocals, additional percussion, increased the tempo and cut the runtime. John said it initially received pushback from EMI and Capitol; according to Andy Taylor, they felt it was &quot;too black&quot; for Duran Duran. Executives were eventually convinced and upon release as the third single on 16 April 1984, the remixed song became the band&#x27;s first US and second UK number one single. Its success boosted sales for &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; five months after its release. The single&#x27;s accompanying video was shot by Mulcahy over two days at the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto; John wanted the video to be taken from a live show as a way to showcase their strength as a live band and to dismiss interviewers who referred to Duran Duran solely as a &quot;video band&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Reviews for &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; were predominantly negative upon its release. Critics cited poor lyrics and found the group utilised their musical influences in unoriginal ways. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; Jim Reid felt the record marked the first chapter in the band&#x27;s decline, deeming the music &quot;no more than a sub-art school mix of plagiarism&quot; and the lyrics &quot;chickenfeed mysteries that neither say or mean anything&quot;. Reid found the LP &quot;bad as in pathetic, useless, no good&quot; and a &quot;painful [listening] experience&quot; that showcases the group&#x27;s &quot;mediocre talent&quot;. Ira Robbins was also negative in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, describing &quot;Seven&quot; as &quot;a harmless, useless mishmash of old riffs and weak songs&quot; that represents a step backward from &quot;Rio&quot;. He argued the band were &quot;too talented to be satisfied with such a dismal showing&quot;. &quot;Sounds&quot; dubbed the record &quot;Seven and the Rancid Ravings&quot;, arguing that it is &quot;so assuredly awful it breaks new ground in badness&quot;, and concluding: &quot;&quot;Seven&quot; is more redolent of illness – a nervous disorder of people near to cracking up – than it is of just being an amusingly dreadful recording.&quot; In &quot;NME&quot;, Paolo Hewitt argued that pop stars are only interested in themselves, with Duran Duran being &quot;perhaps the most striking example&quot;, criticising the lyrics as &quot;attempting to add drama and shade&quot; to the material&#x27;s &quot;already weak structures&quot;.

Among positive reviews, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; Michael Oldfield found the album a bold move at this stage of the band&#x27;s career, in which they solidify the 1980s dancefloor sound and simultaneously put an end to their &quot;wimpish image&quot;. He also said that &quot;Seven&quot; &quot;restores danger and menace to a band that was veering dangerously close to the insipid&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; acknowledged a refinement in the style exhibited on prior works that equated to a &quot;well-crafted set&quot; that &quot;yields fresh bursts of their now familiar choral sound, more playful eroticism and plenty of dance-oriented rhythmic momentum for their club fans&quot;, giving particular recognition to the production. Peter Martin of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; wrote: &quot;The arrangements are watertight, the melodies are razor-sharp and every number is drenched with the mystique of a James Bond theme. A classy concoction, it should ensure they&#x27;ll be around for quite a while yet.&quot; In a more mixed review, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; stated that &quot;as public figures and maybe as people, these imperialist wimps are the most deplorable pop stars of the post-punk if not post-Presley era,&quot; calling the lyrics &quot;obtuse at best,&quot; and said &quot;if you&#x27;d sooner listen to a machine sing than Simon Le Bon, what are you going to do with both?&quot; However, he praised the album&#x27;s singles as being &quot;twice as pleasurable as anything Thomas Dolby is synthesizing these days&quot;.

==Tour==

To support &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;, Duran Duran embarked on a world tour that covered shows in Australia, Japan, England, the US and Canada. Dubbed the Sing Blue Silver Tour after a lyric in &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;, the tour was documented by a film crew, directed by Mulcahy. It commenced in Canberra, Australia in mid-November 1983 before returning to the UK for concerts in London in early December. A short seven-date leg of Japan occurred throughout mid-to-late January 1984. In Japan, Duran Duran played at larger venues than they were used to; audiences screamed so loud they could not hear themselves play. Throughout the tour, the ensemble displayed a harder and heavier sound compared to the supporting album. Roger Taylor stated: &quot;The guitar is more upfront. We go for more power and everyone projects a lot. It&#x27;s basically a rock show. We&#x27;re not a synthesiser band.&quot;

The North American leg commenced at the end of January; according to Malins, the band members were on an &quot;adrenaline-charged &#x27;voyage of discovery. While on the road in February, the band won two Grammy Awards in the new Best Long Form and Best Short Form music video categories, and appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, who dubbed them the &quot;Fab Five&quot; in comparison to the Beatles. 

The tour was massively successful, including through the selling of merchandise, but the non-stop touring schedule took a toll on the band members by the end of February. The cold weather and constant use of drugs and alcohol led to increased tensions and fights amongst the players. According to Malins, inflated egos led to rampant behavior, particularly from Andy Taylor. In March, Duran Duran continued playing in the northeastern US and Canada before playing two sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden, achieving a goal they had made when they signed to EMI in 1981.

The Sing Blue Silver Tour continued around the US, concluding in San Diego in mid-April. By the final dates, John Taylor was doing drugs on stage. Footage from the shows in Oakland, California were compiled for the concert film &quot;Arena&quot; (1985). A planned European leg was cancelled due to the band&#x27;s exhaustion. It was the final tour of the 1980s with the original lineup. At its end, the band filmed more material for &quot;Arena&quot; using studio sets; the film was released in late 1984 along with a documentary about the tour, titled &quot;Sing Blue Silver&quot;; an edited one-hour cut of &quot;Arena&quot;, titled &quot;As the Lights Go Down&quot;, was broadcast on several US channels. Live recordings from across the tour and a new studio song, the Rodgers-produced &quot;The Wild Boys&quot;, were compiled and released in late 1984 on a live album, also titled &quot;Arena&quot;.

==Legacy==

&quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; was Duran Duran&#x27;s final studio album with the original five-piece line-up until 2004&#x27;s &quot;Astronaut&quot;. After recording &quot;The Wild Boys&quot;, the band members mostly collaborated on different projects from 1984 to 1985: Andy Taylor and John Taylor formed the supergroup the Power Station with the singer Robert Palmer and Chic&#x27;s former drummer Tony Thompson, while Le Bon, Rhodes and Roger recorded a studio album, &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; (1985), as Arcadia. Duran Duran briefly regrouped to record the title song of the James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985) before Andy and Roger departed the band shortly before the recording of their Rodgers-produced fourth studio album &quot;Notorious&quot; (1986).

In later decades, &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; continues to receive mixed reactions. In a retrospective review, DeGagne found &quot;Seven&quot; fails to match the &quot;unrestrained pop/rock ebullience&quot; of &quot;Rio&quot; with weaker songwriting, as well as favouring synthesisers over Andy Taylor&#x27;s guitar stylings, but still displays strong singles and enough musicality to equal a &quot;bright, energetic and effectual&quot; record. Writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Thomas H. Green described &quot;Seven&quot; as &quot;opulently produced&quot;, with &quot;their new romantic origins blooming into lush decadent pop&quot;. Chris Gerard found the album more uneven in &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; but argued &quot;Seven&quot; predicted the musical direction of both &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; and &quot;Notorious&quot;. Writing in 2009, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Tom Ewing referred to &quot;Seven&quot; as a disappointment compared to &quot;Rio&quot;.

In his biography of the band, Malins contends that the album&#x27;s primary flaw is a &quot;lack of punch and power&quot;, and its &quot;frenzied, chaotic bluster&quot; lacks the effectiveness of &quot;Rio&quot;. In his book &quot;Please Please Tell Me Now&quot;, Davis opines that good lyrics were &quot;hard-earned&quot; as Le Bon&#x27;s &quot;beatnik muse&quot; had vanished. In his memoir, John Taylor stated the whole band were not satisfied with the album musically. The bassist felt &quot;Seven&quot; was anticlimactic after &quot;Rio&quot;, writing: &quot;&quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; is a beautifully textured record, but it didn&#x27;t hit you viscerally in the way the earlier albums had.&quot;

EMI re-released &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; in 2010 in two configurations: a two-disc digipak and a three-disc box set, featuring two CDs and one DVD, which included the first official release of the &quot;As the Lights Go Down&quot; video. Like the reissue of their debut released the same year, the remastering had a negative reaction from fans as a victim of the loudness war. Andy Taylor, who had left the band by that point, criticised the remaster, saying that it &quot;sounds like it was done down the pub&quot; and condemned EMI for promoting the demos as bonus tracks: &quot;They should be gifting them to fans after 30 years of support...shame on all involved&quot;. EMI refused to recall the reissue because complaints about its sound quality were, according to the label, &quot;by far in the minority&quot;.

<doc id="1068955" wikidata="Q3440851" url="?curid=1068955" title="Sign bit">
<text>In computer science, the sign bit is a bit in a signed number representation that indicates the sign of a number. Although only signed numeric data types have a sign bit, it is invariably located in the most significant bit position, so the term may be used interchangeably with &quot;most significant bit&quot; in some contexts.

Almost always, if the sign bit is 0, the number is non-negative (positive or zero). If the sign bit is 1 then the number is negative. Formats other than two&#x27;s complement integers allow a signed zero: distinct &quot;positive zero&quot; and &quot;negative zero&quot; representations, the latter of which does not correspond to the mathematical concept of a negative number.

When using a complement representation, to convert a signed number to a wider format the additional bits must be filled with copies of the sign bit in order to preserve its numerical value, a process called &quot;sign extension&quot; or &quot;sign propagation&quot;.

== Sign bit weight in Two&#x27;s complement ==

Two&#x27;s complement is by far the most common format for signed integers. In Two&#x27;s complement, the sign bit has the weight where w is equal to the bits position in the number. With an 8-bit integer, the sign bit would have the value of , or -128. Due to this value being larger than all the other bits combined, having this bit set would ultimately make the number negative, thus changing the sign.

== Sign bit weight in Ones&#x27; complement ==

Ones&#x27; complement is similar to Two&#x27;s Complement, but the sign bit has the weight where w is equal to the bits position in the number. With an 8-bit integer, the sign bit would have a value of , or -127. This allows for two types of zero: positive and negative, which is not possible with Two&#x27;s complement.

== Sign bit in sign magnitude integers ==

Using sign magnitude, the sign bit directly determines the sign. If the sign bit is 0, the number is positive; if the sign bit is 1, the number is negative. Similarly with Ones&#x27; Complement, this allows for both a positive and a negative zero.

== Sign bit in floating-point numbers ==
Floating-point numbers, such as IEEE format, IBM format, VAX format, and even the format used by the Zuse Z1 and Z3 use a Sign and magnitude representation.

<text>Double Wide is the debut studio album by American recording artist Uncle Kracker. It was released on May 30, 2000, via Lava/Atlantic Records. The recording sessions took place on the back of a tour bus parked in various motels and arena parking lots across the country. The production was mostly handled by Kid Rock with Michael Bradford. The music of the album is noted for its eclectic style, categorized by AllMusic as country, rock rap and rockabilly. Additionally, the album also incorporates elements of hip hop, rock and roll, blues rock and pop.

The album reached top 10 in Germany, Austria and the United States. It was certified platinum by Music Canada on August 13, 2001, and 2× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on November 28, 2001. Regarding the album&#x27;s success, Kracker stated in 2001 &quot;It gives you that kind of &#x27;I told you so&#x27; feeling, because I always knew the record was good.&quot;

<text>Number 12 Squadron, also known as No. 12 (Bomber) Squadron and occasionally as No. XII Squadron, is a flying squadron of the Royal Air Force (RAF). The squadron reformed in July 2018 as a joint RAF/Qatar Emiri Air Force squadron. It is currently based at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, and operates the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4, while temporarily integrating Qatari air and ground crews in order to provide training and support as part of the Qatari purchase of 24 Typhoons from the UK.

==History==
===The World Wars===

No. 12 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was formed in February 1915 from a flight of No. 1 Squadron RFC based at Netheravon Airfield in Wiltshire. The squadron moved to France in September 1915 and operated a variety of aircraft on operations over the Western Front during the First World War. In March 1918, the squadron was re-equipped with the Bristol F.2b Fighter just before becoming part of the newly formed Royal Air Force. The squadron, by then based at Bickendorf in Germany, was disbanded in 1922.

The squadron re-formed at RAF Northolt in West London on 1 April 1923, operating the de Havilland DH.9A. In 1924, it moved to RAF Andover in Hampshire and converted to the Fairey Fawn, a single-engined biplane bomber. The Fawns were replaced in 1926 with the Fairey Fox, which influenced the adoption of the fox&#x27;s head as part of the squadron badge and the squadron&#x27;s motto. The squadron was the only RAF user of the Fairey Fox and its performance was superior to other types, resulting in the motto of &#x27;Leads the Field&#x27;. In 1931, the squadron re-equipped with the Sydney Camm designed Hawker Hart. In October 1935 the squadron moved to Aden, but returned to Andover in August 1936. The Harts were replaced by the Hawker Hind in 1936 and in 1938 the squadron was equipped with Fairey Battles.

On the first day of the Second World War the squadron moved to France to begin operations. On 12 May 1940, over the Albert Canal, Belgium, one bridge in particular was being used by the invading German Army, with protection from fighter aircraft, anti-aircraft and machine-guns. The RAF was ordered to demolish this vital bridge, and five Fairey Battles from the squadron were dispatched.

At Amifontaine, 12 Squadron was briefed for an attack on the bridges near Maastricht with six Battles. After the fate of Belgian Battles attacking the day before, the commander asked for volunteers and every pilot stepped forward; the six crews on standby were chosen. Two Blenheim squadrons were supposed to attack Maastricht at the same time as a diversion and twelve Hurricane squadrons were flying in support but half of these were operating to the north-west and the others were only flying in the vicinity, except for 1 Squadron, which was to sweep ahead to clear away German fighters.

Three Battles of B Flight were to attack the bridge at Veldwezelt and three from A Flight the bridge at Vroenhoven. Two Battles of A Flight took off at and the Battles climbed to ; short of Maastricht, the aircraft received anti-aircraft fire, surprising the crews with the extent of the German advance. The Hurricane pilots saw about fighters above them and attacked; three Bf 109s and six Hurricanes were shot down. During the diversion, A Flight dived over the Maastricht−Tongeren road towards the Vroenhoven bridge covered by three Hurricanes; a Bf 109 closed on the leading aircraft, then veered off towards the second Battle, which hid in a cloud. The Battles dived from and bombed at , both being hit in the engine, one Battle came down in a field, the crew being captured. The second Battle crew, having shaken off the Bf 109, saw bombs from the first Battle explode on the bridge and hit the water and the side of the canal. The pilot turned away through a web of tracer from ground fire and was hit by a Bf 109, then the rear gunner damaged the German fighter. The port fuel tank caught fire, the pilot ordered the crew to parachute and then noticed that the fire had gone out. The pilot nursed the bomber home but ran out of fuel a few miles short and landed in a field; the observer got back to Amifontaine but the gunner was taken prisoner.

Five minutes later, B Flight attacked the bridge at Veldwezelt, having flown over Belgium in line astern at . One Battle was hit and caught fire before the target, bombed and crashed near the canal; the pilot, despite severe burns, saving the crew who were taken prisoner. A second Battle was hit, zoomed while on fire, dived into the ground and exploded, killing the crew. The third Battle made a steep turn near the bridge then dived into it, destroying the west end. German engineers began immediately to build a pontoon bridge.

The attack met intense anti-aircraft fire, but the mission was accomplished, much of the success being due to the coolness and resource of the pilot Flying Officer Garland of the leading aircraft and the navigation of Sergeant Gray. Notwithstanding the success of the mission, the leading aircraft and three others did not return. Flying Officer Garland and Sergeant Gray were both posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

No. 12 Squadron returned to England in June. It was stationed initially at RAF Finningley in South Yorkshire, before moving to RAF Binbrook in Lincolnshire during July 1940, when it was refurnished with Battles. Amongst other missions, the squadron carried out anti-invasion strikes against shipping in Boulogne Harbour in northern France, most notably on 17 and 19 August. The squadron was one of the last No.1 Group units to conduct operations with Fairey Battles. These took place on 15/16 October 1940, when No. 301 (Polish) Squadron bombed Boulogne and Nos. 12 and 142 Squadrons bombed Calais. By November 1940, the squadron had been re-equipped with the Vickers Wellington medium bomber, remaining for the time being at RAF Binbrook. The squadron moved again in 1942, to RAF Wickenby also in Lincolnshire, and soon after converted to operate the Avro Lancaster a heavy bomber.

===Cold War===
In 1946, No. 12 Squadron re-equipped with the Avro Lincoln, another heavy bomber. In 1952, the squadron joined the jet-age and re-equipped with the English Electric Canberra jet bomber. After 44 years continuous service the squadron was again disbanded on 1 July 1961.
On 1 July 1962, the squadron was re-formed to operate eight Avro Vulcan V bombers equipped with Yellow Sun one megaton free-fall strategic nuclear bombs for medium to high altitude release. The squadron initially operated Vulcans from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and then later from RAF Cottesmore in Rutland. The advent of effective Soviet surface-to-air-missiles made high-flying bombers vulnerable, and in late 1966 the squadron took delivery of eight WE.177B strategic nuclear laydown bombs for low-level penetration missions. It was assigned to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) as part of the UK strategic nuclear forces deployed with that 450 kt weapon, that was intended as a temporary stop-gap until the UK Polaris force began to take over the strategic nuclear delivery role. The squadron stood down from this role on 31 December 1967. It was then intended to re-form the squadron with the BAC TSR-2 and then the General Dynamics F-111K but both acquisitions were cancelled by the British Government.
No. 12 Squadron was eventually re-formed at RAF Honington in Suffolk on 1 October 1969 with twelve Blackburn Buccaneer aircraft assigned to Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) in the anti-shipping role, equipped with twelve WE.177 nuclear bombs and free-falling conventional high explosive bombs, and from 1974 with Martel missiles for non-nuclear strike.

During the late 1970s the squadron featured in the RAF documentary film &quot;12 Squadron Buccaneers&quot;, produced by the Central Office of Information. The film features the squadron&#x27;s deployment from Honington to RAF Gibraltar in the Mediterranean for NATO exercise &quot;Open Gate,&quot; where they carry out a low-level anti-shipping mission.

The squadron moved to RAF Lossiemouth in Morayshire during 1980, still in the same anti-shipping role.

During the 1991 Gulf War, personnel from all three Buccaneer squadrons at Lossiemouth, including No. 12 Squadron, took part in Operation Granby, the aircraft&#x27;s first combat operation. Following a short-notice decision to deploy to the Middle East, the first batch of six aircraft were brought to readiness in under 72 hours, including the adoption of desert-pink camouflage and additional war-time equipment. The first six aircraft departed from Lossiemouth for Muharraq in Bahrain at 04:00 on 26 January 1991. Twelve Buccaneers operated as target designators and it became common for each attack formation to comprise four Tornados and two Buccaneers; each Buccaneer carrying a Pave Spike laser designator pod, one as a spare in case of equipment failure. The Buccaneer force became known as the &quot;″Sky Pirates″&quot; in reference to the maritime history of the Buccaneer. Each aircraft had a Jolly Roger flag painted on its port side, alongside nose art featuring female characters. In recognition of their Scottish roots, the Buccaneers were also named after Speyside whisky such as &quot;Glenfiddich&quot;, &quot;Glen Elgin&quot; and &quot;The Macallan&quot;. Hostilities ended in late February 1991, the Buccaneers having flown 218 sorties without loss, designating targets for other aircraft and later dropping 48 Paveway II laser-guided bombs.

In October 1993, the squadron retired its Buccaneers.

===Panavia Tornado GR (1993–2018)===

In September 1993, No. 27 Squadron, then based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, disbanded and immediately re-formed as No. 12 (B) Squadron operating twelve Panavia Tornado GR1B aircraft and relocated to RAF Lossiemouth. The squadron was equipped with eighteen WE.177 nuclear weapons.

During December 1998, the squadron took part in Operation Desert Fox, the four-day air campaign against Iraq. Deployments to the Persian Gulf continued, flying the upgraded Tornado GR4 from 2001, and included major contributions in 2003 as part of Operation Telic as well as supporting the first free elections in Iraq for 50 years in January 2005. In 2006 and again in 2008, No. 12 (B) Squadron provided armed overwatch for UK and US ground operations in Iraq. Shortly afterwards, as British troops withdrew from the country, the Tornado fleet based in the region also returned to the UK, marking the end of a long era of the aircraft in theatre. Between 6 and 16 October 2008, the squadron deployed to RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, to participate in Exercise Crown Condor alongside Saab JAS 39 Gripens from the Blekinge Wing of the Swedish Air Force.
In June 2009, the squadron deployed ten jets to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, eight of which continued to Kandahar in Afghanistan. This marked the start of Tornado GR4 operations in Afghanistan, with the type replacing the Harrier GR9 in theatre. For over four months, No. 12 (B) Squadron successfully provided support to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), including close air support for, amongst others, British, American, Canadian and Afghan troops in all parts of the country. On 16 October 2009, No. 12 (B) Squadron returned to Lossiemouth after having handed over to a Marham-based GR4 squadron.

Between subsequent Operation Herrick deployments during 2011, No. 12 (B) Squadron was deployed in support of Operation Ellamy, the UK&#x27;s participation in the military intervention in Libya under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. This saw ten aircrew deploy to Gioia del Colle in southern Italy to bolster the Tornado component during the peak of operations. The remainder of the squadron was held at readiness to move to RAF Marham to launch Storm Shadow raids on hardened Libyan targets. These missions required three air-to-air refuelling brackets on the outward journey and one further on return to Gioia Del Colle. No. 12 (B) Squadron carried out their last tour of Afghanistan from July to October 2013, being replaced by No. 617 Squadron. The squadron disbanded on 31 March 2014 under the command of Wing Commander Simon Strasdin.

All Tornado aircraft were due to be withdrawn from RAF operations by the end of 2015. Consequently, No. II (AC) Squadron was expected to stand down on 31 March 2015 as a Tornado squadron at RAF Marham, and reactivate the following day as a Eurofighter Typhoon squadron at RAF Lossiemouth. However, in October 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that No. II (AC) Squadron&#x27;s disbanding and reformation would be put on hold to allow Tornados to continue to support operations against ISIL. As a consequence, the new No. II (AC) Squadron formed at Lossiemouth on 12 January 2015, and No. 12 (B) Squadron re-formed the same day at RAF Marham, taking over the former Tornado aircraft and assets of No. II (AC) Squadron. The re-formed squadron was commanded by Wing Commander Nikki Thomas, the first female RAF officer to command a fast jet squadron.

In August 2015, Jane&#x27;s reported that the squadron will stay active for a longer period and it was subsequently deployed to Syria for reconnaissance of ISIS troop movements. The squadron&#x27;s last mission operating the Tornado took place on 14 December 2017 in the skies over Iraq and Syria. As part of the draw-down of the RAF&#x27;s Tornado fleet, the squadron disbanded on 14 February 2018, 103 years after it first formed. Squadron personnel were re-assigned to Marham&#x27;s other Tornado squadrons, No. IX (B) Squadron and No. 31 Squadron and the squadron standard was returned to RAF College Cranwell.

===Eurofighter Typhoon (2018–)===

On 14 December 2017, it was announced by the Ministry of Defence that No. 12 Squadron would operate the Eurofighter Typhoon and temporarily integrate Qatari air and ground crews in order to provide training and support as part of the Qatari purchase of 24 Typhoons. The squadron reformed on 24 July 2018 as a joint RAF/Qatar Emiri Air Force (QEAF) unit at Horse Guards in London. No. 12 (B) Squadron received its first Typhoon FGR4 (&quot;ZK436&quot;) in July 2019 at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. In November 2019, No. 12 Squadron deployed to Qatar and participated in Exercise Epic Skies III alongside the QEAF for three weeks.

<doc id="1068967" wikidata="Q38508" url="?curid=1068967" title="Kangal Shepherd Dog">
<text>The Kangal Shepherd Dog () is a traditional Turkish breed of large livestock guardian dog. The breed name derives from that of the town and district of Kangal in Sivas Province, the easternmost province of the Central Anatolia Region in central Turkey. The coat colour varies from pale fawn to wolf grey, always with a black mask. 

It is a traditional flock guardian dog, kept with flocks of sheep to fend off wolves and other predators. Some have been exported to African countries such as Namibia, Kenya and Tanzania, where they successfully protect local flocks from cheetahs, thus contributing to the conservation of endangered cheetah populations.

== History ==
The Kangal is a traditional working breed of Central Anatolia. The name derives from that of the town and district of Kangal in Sivas Province, the easternmost province of the Central Anatolia Region. The Kangal has been used by shepherds for protection against wolves and other predators for centuries. 
A DNA study found that the dogs of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan are genetically closest to Kangal dogs, and the researchers propose that the breed may have been brought from Central Asia by the nomadic Turks.

The Kangal was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1989; the most recent breed standard was published in 2018.

The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom recognised the Turkish Kangal Dog with effect from April 2013, and a provisional breed standard was published early in that year; owners of dogs registered as Anatolian Shepherd Dogs could apply for them to be re-registered under the new name.

Around 300 of the dogs have been given to farmers in Namibia since 1994 by the Cheetah Conservation Fund to help protect livestock from cheetah attacks, and the programme has been extended to Kenya. Since then, the number of cheetahs killed by farmers is calculated to have fallen from 19 per farmer annually to 2.4. Livestock losses have been cut significantly at more than 80% of the farms where the dogs have been adopted. The great majority of cheetahs that are still killed by farmers are killed after specific attacks on livestock. Previously, the cats were tracked and killed whenever they neared a farm.

=== Anatolian Shepherd ===
Anatolian Shepherd Dog is the name used in the United States to describe dogs descended from regional Turkish livestock guardian dogs, particularly the Kangal but also the Akbash, from the late 1960s. In 1967 a US Navy Lieutenant who was stationed in Turkey, Robert Ballard, acquired two working livestock guardians Zorba and Peki, from breeders in the Ankara region, Zorba was a long-coated pinto-colored dog and Peki a short-coated buff-colored bitch. In the late 1960s Ballard returned to the United States and took his dogs with him and in 1970 the pair bred their first litter, becoming the foundation stock of the breed in the United States. A breed club was quickly formed and further examples were imported from Turkey. In developing the breed, the American enthusiasts acted without understanding of regional Turkish varieties of shepherd&#x27;s dogs, with the result that the American dogs could be bred with various coat lengths, colors and color patterns whilst in Turkey the different breeds breed more true to a set coat type. This was further exacerbated by most of these dogs being sourced in the intermediate zone between the main breeding centers of the Akbash and the Kangal, where examples of both types can be found. In subsequent years animosity developed between American breeders, who insisted their dogs were the true Turkish shepherd&#x27;s dog, and Turkish breeders who believed, and stated, they were an amalgam of various Turkish breeds. Insults and counter-insults were exchanged with American breeders accusing the Turks of marketing dogs of dubious ancestry as independent breeds and the Turks stating the Americans were breeding crossbred dogs. The name Anatolian Shepherd Dog is unknown in Turkey and the breed is sometimes described as having the Turkish name of Çoban Köpeği which means &#x27;shepherd&#x27;s dog&#x27;, or livestock guardian dog. Since the 1980s Americans have almost exclusively imported Kangals and the Anatolian has increasingly conformed to that breed type. Despite this, pups of mixed appearance are still whelped and Turkish authorities still refuse to recognise Anatolians as a purebred Turkish breed.

== Characteristics ==
Dogs usually stand between at the withers, bitches between , with a tolerance either way for both sexes.

The Kangal Shepherd Dog is not as heavy as some other mastiff breeds, allowing it greater speed and agility than larger dogs. The dogs can reach speeds of up to .
The under-layer provides insulation against both severe Anatolian winters and the fierce summer sun, while the outer-layer repels water and snow. This combination of coat allows it to regulate its core temperature more efficiently, while the coat is dense enough to repel rupture from wolf bites.

== Use ==

The Kangal is a traditional flock guardian dog, kept with flocks of sheep to fend off wolves and other predators. Some have been exported to African countries such as Namibia, Kenya and Tanzania, where they successfully protect local flocks from cheetahs, thus contributing to the conservation of endangered cheetah populations.

<text>In Nacht und Eis (English: &quot;In Night and Ice&quot;), also called Der Untergang der Titanic (&quot;The Sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;&quot;) and Shipwrecked in Icebergs in the US, is a 1912 German silent adventure-disaster drama film about the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. It is the second one made, and the first surviving one, about the disaster.

==Plot==
The film starts out with the passengers boarding at Southampton. The lives of the passengers on board the ill-fated ocean liner are depicted. On 14 April, &quot;Titanic&quot; strikes an iceberg, throwing the diners in the Café Parisien to the side. Panic strikes the passengers. The crew ready the lifeboats, despite the fact that there are not enough of them. Women and children are loaded, while the men are held back. The radio operators (who take up most of the sinking part of the film) send out an SOS. Fire blows out of the funnels during the sinking and then the boilers explode. The ship&#x27;s band is repeatedly shown playing musical pieces, the titles of which are shown on captions; the hymn, &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot; is played. As the radio room floods, the Captain calls out to the passengers, &quot;Be British!&quot; and finally the Captain releases the operators from their duty but both are willing to remain on the ship. As &quot;Titanic&quot; sinks, the captain saves a drowning man and takes him to a lifeboat but he refuses a spot and declares he will follow his ship, swims away and the waves close over the swimming captain, as his cap floats in the water.

==Production==
The film was produced by Continental-Kunstfilm of Berlin, and directed by the Romanian Mime Misu. While most of its footage was shot in a glasshouse studio in the rear courtyard of the offices at 123 Chausseestrasse, some footage was shot in Hamburg, and some was possibly done aboard the German ocean liner &quot;Kaiserin Auguste Victoria&quot;, then docked at Hamburg. The Café Parisien scenes were filmed in the vessel&#x27;s Winter Garden. The Berlin Fire Department provided water to use for the sinking scenes. The filming began in May 1912, and the film premiered in August 1912. The Captain and First Officer are played by Otto Rippert and Ernst Rückert respectively.

With a running time of 35 minutes, &quot;In Nacht und Eis&quot; was three times longer than the average film of 1912. Shot in black and white, various scenes were tinted to heighten their impact, such as night scenes in dark blue and a shot of a stoker feeding a burner in red.

In one scene, a title card reads: &quot;Der kleine Milliardenerbe, welcher mit seinem Kindermädchen gerettet wurde, weil sich die ganze Familie opferte, um den Namen zu erhalten&quot; which translates to &quot;The little inheritor of billions, who was rescued by his nanny to preserve the [family] name, since the whole family sacrificed themselves.&quot; This related to the true story of the Allison family which were traveling in First Class, whose baby Trevor escaped the &quot;Titanic&quot; with his nanny Alice, while his family perished in the sinking.

==Preservation status==
The film was presumed lost until February 1998, when the German film archivist Horst Lange, after seeing a newspaper article mentioning the disappearance of &quot;In Nacht und Eis&quot;, informed the paper that he possessed a print of the film, after which the Deutsche Kinemathek started working on a restoration of the film, which premiered on August 28, 1998 in Bonn. Various scenes can be seen in the documentary &quot;Beyond Titanic&quot;. The movie itself is available to view in its entirety on YouTube.

<doc id="1068977" wikidata="Q777947" url="?curid=1068977" title="My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean">
<text>&quot;My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean&quot;, or simply &quot;My Bonnie&quot;, is a traditional Scottish folk song and children’s song that is popular in Western culture. It is listed in Roud Folk Song Index as No. 1422. The song has been recorded by numerous artists since the beginning of the 20th century, and many parody versions also exist.

The best known recording of the song may be a rock and roll version titled &quot;My Bonnie&quot; by Tony Sheridan and The Beatles, recorded in the first ever commercial recording session that featured The Beatles. The resulting single is generally regarded as the Beatles&#x27; first single.

==History==
Although the song&#x27;s origin is uncertain, its original subject could be Charles Edward Stuart (&#x27;Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;): after the defeat of the Prince at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 and his subsequent exile, his Jacobite supporters could have sung this song or one like it in his honour; and thanks to the ambiguity of the term &quot;Bonnie&quot;, which can refer to a woman as well as to a man, they could pretend it was a love song.

In 1881, under the duo of pseudonyms H. J. Fuller and J. T. Wood, Charles E. Pratt published sheet music for &quot;Bring Back My Bonnie to Me&quot;. Theodore Raph, in his 1964 book &quot;American Song Treasury: 100 Favorites&quot;, writes people were requesting the song at sheet music stores in the 1870, and Pratt was convinced to publish a version of it under the pseudonyms. The song became a big hit, especially popular with college singing groups, but also for any group singing.

Another song from the English tradition titled &quot;My Barney Lies over the Ocean&quot; has a slightly different melody, and it is said to be an antecedent of &quot;My Bonnie&quot;. In the liner notes for 1975 album &quot;For Pence and Spicy Ale&quot; where the English traditional singing group The Watersons recorded a version, the musicologist A. L. Lloyd says about &quot;My Barney&quot;: &quot;A stage song favoured by Irish comedians from the 1860s on. During the 1880s, apparently on American university campuses, close harmony groups remade it into the better-known—and even more preposterous—&#x27;My Bonny Lies over the Ocean&#x27;. Watersons had this from Bob Davenport who learnt it from a Frank Quinn 78.&quot;

==Early recordings==
Many early recordings were recorded under the title &quot;Bring Back My Bonnie to Me&quot;, such as the recording released by the vocal group Haydn Quartet in 1901. Others with the same title include an instrumental version by The Taylor Trio (1916), and a vocal version by Alma Gluck and Orpheus Quartet (1918). The song was recorded in many different musical styles; for example, the country group The Leake County Revelers recorded a country version in 1927 with the title &quot;My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean&quot;, a big band version was recorded by Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra in 1938, and a calypso-style version by Ella Fitzgerald with Bobby Orton&#x27;s Teen-Aces in 1952, released as the flip side of &quot;Trying&quot;.

In 1919, Billy Murray released a different song titled &quot;My Barney Lies Over the Ocean (Just the Way He Lied to Me)&quot;, where a few modified lines of &quot;My Bonnie&quot; was used as the chorus. It was sung from a female perspective where she suspected her significant other (the &quot;Barney&quot; of the title) of cheating and lying.

There have been a handful of field recordings of traditional versions. Birmingham resident Cecilia Costello was recorded singing a version by Peter Kennedy in 1951, whilst the &quot;East Grinstead Old People&#x27;s Club&quot; of East Grinstead, Sussex, England sang a version to Ken Stubbs in 1960, which can be heard online via the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website. Traditional versions of the song have also been recorded in the United States and Canada.

== Lyrics ==
&lt;poem&gt;
My Bonnie lies over the ocean,
My Bonnie lies over the sea,
My Bonnie lies over the ocean,
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

[Chorus]
Bring back, bring back,
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me.
Bring back, bring back,
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

Oh, blow ye winds over the ocean,
Oh, blow ye winds over the sea,
Oh, blow ye winds over the ocean,
And bring back my Bonnie to me.

[Repeat Chorus]

Last night as I lay on my pillow,
Last night as I lay on my bed,
Last night as I lay on my pillow,
I dreamt that my Bonnie was dead.

[Repeat chorus]

The winds have blown over the ocean,
The winds have blown over the sea,
The winds have blown over the ocean,
And brought back my Bonnie to me.

[Repeat chorus]
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Variations and parodies==
The structure and tune of the song made it a suitable vehicle for parody, and numerous variations and parodies of the song have been created over the years. Some of these may be sung as children songs, and many have become common campfire song for organizations such as the Boy Scouts. These campfire versions are occasionally accompanied by interactive movements, such as sitting down or standing up every time a word that begins with the letter &quot;b&quot; is sung. Two examples are given below, the first may be sung as additional verses or variations for the song, the second a song titled &quot;Oh God, How the Money Rolls In&quot; sung to the tune of &quot;My Bonnie&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
;My Bonnie (variations)
Last night as I lay on my pillow,
Last night as I lay on my bed,
I stuck my feet out of the window,
In the morning the neighbors were dead.

Bring back, bring back, oh bring back my neighbor to me, to me
Bring back, bring back, oh bring back my neighbor to me

My Bonnie leaned over the gas tank,
The height of its contents to see,
I lighted a match to assist her,
O Bring back my Bonnie to me.

Bring back, bring back, oh bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Bring back, bring back, oh bring back my Bonnie to me.

My breakfast lies over the ocean,
My luncheon lies over the rail.
My supper lies in a commotion. 
Won&#x27;t somebody bring me a pail?

Please bring, please bring, oh please bring a pail to me, to me. 
Please bring, please bring, oh please bring a pail to me. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

; My God, How The Money Rolls In
&lt;poem&gt;
My mother makes beer in the bathtub,
My father makes synthetic gin,
My sister makes fudge for a quarter,
My God, how the money rolls in.

[chorus]
Rolls in, rolls in, my God, how the money rolls in, rolls in,
Rolls in, rolls in, my God, how the money rolls in.

My mother, she drowned in the bathtub,
My father, he died from his gin,
My sister, she choked on her chocolate,
My God, what a jam I am in.

[Repeat chorus]

I tried making beer in the bathtub,
I tried making synthetic gin,
I tried making fudge for a living,
Now look at the shape that I&#x27;m in.

[Repeat chorus]
&lt;/poem&gt;
Another variant popular in the Scouting movement goes under titles such as &quot;My Father&#x27;s a Lavatory Cleaner&quot;, &quot;Shine Your Buttons with Brasso&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Violets&quot;. Its history is unknown, but the references to the cleaning material Brasso, its price of three ha&#x27;pence (three halfpennies), and its availability from Woolworths, suggest a possible origin in English music hall, or among British or ANZAC troops, in the early 20th century. It is Roud folk song index no. 10232.

== Tony Sheridan and the Beatles ==

A rock n&#x27; roll arrangement of the song was recorded by Tony Sheridan and the Beatles. It was titled &quot;My Bonnie&quot;, and subtitled &quot;Mein Herz ist bei dir nur&quot; (&quot;My Heart is with You Only&quot;) in its German language version. The band was credited as the Beat Brothers in its original release; their name was changed because the German producer wanted to avoid association with the similar sounding German slang &quot;pidels&quot; (pronounced &quot;peedles&quot; meaning &quot;little willies&quot;), and the &quot;Beat Brothers&quot; was thought more understandable to the German audience.

===Recording===
Tony Sheridan and the Beatles (with Pete Best on drums) were signed by bandleader Bert Kaempfert to Polydor, and they recorded a number of songs including &quot;My Bonnie&quot; in their first recording session on 22 June 1961 at the Friedrich-Ebert-Halle in Hamburg, West Germany. These songs were the Beatles&#x27; first commercial recordings. Kaempfert produced the song, assisted by sound engineer Karl Hinze. &quot;My Bonnie&quot; was said to have been chosen because it was a song known to the Germans. 

Tony Sheridan sang lead on the song, starting with a slow Elvis Presley style introduction. The Beatles were the backing band; Paul McCartney provided vocal harmony and shouts, Best on drums provided a constant &quot;2-and, 4&quot; beat on the faster part of the song, and George Harrison on guitar notably on the bridge. This is how Sheridan describes his arrangement of the song: &quot;The [slow] introduction was in A, now we did a very innovative thing, we went in to C to Rock and roll.&quot; He described their preparation for their recording session of My Bonnie, in these words:
===Personnel===
*Tony Sheridan - lead vocals, guitar solo
*John Lennon - rhythm guitar, backing vocals
*Paul McCartney - bass, backing vocals
*George Harrison - lead guitar, backing vocals
*Pete Best - drums

===Release and response===
&quot;My Bonnie&quot; was first released as a single in October 1961 in West Germany, with &quot;The Saints (When the Saints Go Marching In)&quot; its B-side. According to McCartney in 1962, it reached top 5 on the German hit parade.

The single is said to have been instrumental in bringing the Beatles to the attention of Brian Epstein (even though Epstein was likely to have been aware of the group before then), when a customer requested the record at his music store NEMS in Liverpool. Epstein subsequently went to see the Beatles at The Cavern Club and became their manager. Brian Epstein placed a large order of the single for NEMS, which persuaded the German label to release the single on 5 January 1962 in the UK, this time credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beatles. However, it did not chart in the UK in 1962, but charted in 1963 at No. 48 after the Beatles became popular. In July 1963, Polydor released &quot;My Bonnie&quot; as an EP in the UK in order to capitalise on the success of the Beatles. The single was also released in the United States during the Beatlemania, this time around with the Beatles credited as the lead artist, and it reached the No. 26 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

John Lennon later expressed his dislike for the Beatles&#x27; recording with Sheridan, as he said: &quot;It&#x27;s just Tony Sheridan singing, with us banging in the background. It&#x27;s terrible. It could be anybody.&quot; George Harrison, however, was enthusiastic about the initial release of their recording, and said that he &quot;didn&#x27;t stop playing it for days&quot;. For a short while the band performed the song in shows, with Lennon taking over on lead vocals.

Both &quot;My Bonnie&quot; and &quot;The Saints&quot; were included on Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;My Bonnie&quot; album. Sheridan&#x27;s first version of &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; was also recorded with the Beatles and issued on an E.P. in 1962. This was the third and last song with the Beatles to be credited to the Beat Brothers. When the Beatles gained fame, all eight recordings made by the Beatles in Hamburg in 1961 and 1962 were compiled on the German album &quot;The Beatles&#x27; First!&quot; in 1964 and issued elsewhere in subsequent years. &quot;My Bonnie&quot;, along with &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot; and &quot;Cry for a Shadow&quot;, was placed on &quot;Anthology 1&quot; in 1995.

=== Weekly charts ===
==Other versions==
*Duane Eddy and the Rebels recorded an instrumental version titled &quot;Bonnie Come Back&quot;, which reached No. 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 15 in Canada, and No. 12 on the UK chart in 1960.
* Ray Charles released a R&amp;B version titled &quot;My Bonnie&quot; in 1958. It was included in his 1959 album &quot;What’d I Say&quot;.
* Pete Seeger sang a song titled &quot;My Children Are Seven in Number&quot; based on the tune of &quot;My Bonnie&quot; to promote the labour movement and show solidarity with striking workers. The song was included in his 1956 album &quot;American Industrial Ballads&quot; as well as other compilations.
* &quot;My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean&quot; was recorded by the American quintet Bounding Main and released on their 2011 album &quot;Kraken Up&quot;.

==In modern culture==
*The Fleischer brothers filmed this song in DeForest Phonofilm, part of their Song Car-Tunes series, released 15 September 1925, and notable as the first film to use the &quot;follow the bouncing ball&quot; technique.
*&quot;My Bunny Lies Over The Sea&quot;, a short Bugs Bunny cartoon film whose title parodies the song, was released by Warner Brothers in 1948.
*On December 20, 2011, JibJab released a video about the year 2011 in review with a song called &quot;2011, Buh-Bye&quot;, to the tune of the title song.
* In 2012 Hollie Steel starred and sang &quot;My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean&quot; in the 55 minute musical docudrama, &quot;Children on the Titanic&quot; available on Amazon Video and on YouTube.
*In 1940, refugees aboard the &quot;Dunera&quot; ship &quot;learned from their British warders&quot; this song&#x27;s tune and, in response to maltreatment, including to their luggage, they composed and sang &quot;regularly on board the ship&quot;: &quot;My luggage went into the ocean, My luggage went into the sea, My luggage was thrown in the ocean, Oh, bring back my luggage to me!&quot;

<doc id="1068978" wikidata="Q888450" url="?curid=1068978" title="Bobby Bare">
<text>Robert Joseph Bare Sr. (born April 7, 1935) is an American country singer and songwriter, best known for the songs &quot;Marie Laveau&quot;, &quot;Detroit City&quot; and &quot;500 Miles Away from Home&quot;. He is the father of Bobby Bare Jr., also a musician.

==Early career==
Bare was born in Ironton, Ohio. In the 1950s, he repeatedly tried and failed to sell his songs. He finally got a record deal, with Capitol Records, and recorded a few unsuccessful rock and roll singles. Just before he was drafted into the United States Army, he wrote a song called &quot;The All American Boy&quot; and did a demo for his friend, Bill Parsons, to learn how to record. Instead of using Parsons&#x27; later version, the record company, Fraternity Records, decided to go with Bare&#x27;s original demo. The record reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but Fraternity erroneously credited Bill Parsons on the label. The same track, with the same billing error, peaked at No. 22 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1959. In 1965, an album of older recorded material, &quot;Tender Years&quot; (JM-6026), was released on the Hilltop label. That same year, the material was repackaged by Sears and released under the title &quot;Bobby In Song&quot; (SPS-115). These albums are not usually included in Bare&#x27;s published discographies.

==Career at RCA Victor (1962–1970)==
Bare&#x27;s big break in country music came when Chet Atkins signed him to RCA Victor. His debut single for the label was 1962&#x27;s &quot;Shame On Me&quot;. Follow-up &quot;Detroit City&quot; reached No. 6 Country, No. 16 Hot 100, and in 1964 earned him a Grammy Award for Best Country &amp; Western Recording. Then a surge of hits followed, including &quot;500 Miles Away from Home&quot; (based on a traditional folk ballad written by Hedy West as &quot;500 Miles&quot;) and Ian Tyson&#x27;s &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot;. In 1965 he received two further Grammy nominations for Best Country &amp; Western Vocal Performance and Best Country &amp; Western single for the latter song. In 1966, he received a yet another Grammy Nomination for Best Country &amp; Western Male Vocal Performance for his song &quot;Talk Me Some Sense&quot;. He also recorded two duet albums with Skeeter Davis and recorded six tracks as a trio with Norma Jean and Liz Anderson, which produced a major hit with &quot;The Game of Triangles&quot;, a wife-husband-other woman drama that hit No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and earned the trio a Grammy nomination. In 1968, he recorded an album with a group from England called The Hillsiders. In 1969, he had a Top 5 hit with Tom T. Hall&#x27;s &quot;(Margie&#x27;s At) The Lincoln Park Inn&quot;.

==Career at Mercury (1970–1972)==
Bare moved to Mercury Records in 1970 and immediately scored a Top 3 hit with &quot;How I Got To Memphis&quot;, and also had two Top 10 hits with early Kris Kristofferson compositions, &quot;Come Sundown&quot; and &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Tell Me How the Story Ends&quot; (both 1971). He also scored a #12 hit in 1972 with a version of Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show&#x27;s pop hit &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Mother&quot;, written by Shel Silverstein.

==Return to RCA (1973–1977)==

Bare returned to RCA in 1973, after two years at Mercury. and scored once more with Billy Joe Shaver&#x27;s &quot;Ride Me Down Easy&quot;, which nearly made the Top 10.

Bare started to release novelty songs recorded live with selected audiences. One such song, &quot;Marie Laveau&quot;, topped the country chart in 1974; the song was Bare&#x27;s only #1 hit. It was co-written by his friends Silverstein and Baxter Taylor, who received a BMI Award for the song in 1975.

In 1977, Bare released an entire album of songs by songwriter Bob McDill called &quot;Me and McDill&quot;, which contained the popular hit &quot;Look Who I&#x27;m Cheatin&#x27; On Tonight.&quot;

Silverstein penned other songs for Bare including a Grammy-nominated hit, &quot;Daddy What If&quot;, which he recorded with his five-year-old son, Bobby Bare Jr. The song was an immediate success as well, not only reaching No. 2 on the country charts, but nearly reaching the Top 40 on the pop charts. Bare&#x27;s album, &quot;Sings Lullabys, Legends and Lies&quot;, became his most commercially successful album, finding him a new audience with pop radio once again playing his songs and also gaining a new following with college kids. These songs, all 14 written or co-written by Shel Silverstein, however, would become Bare&#x27;s last Top 10 hits.
In 1975 Bare recorded a children&#x27;s album with his family, mainly of Silverstein songs, called &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Kitchen&quot;. It was nominated in Best Group category in Grammy Awards. 

His biggest hits during this time included &quot;Alimony&quot; (1975), &quot;The Winner&quot; (1976), and &quot;Drop Kick Me, Jesus (Through The Goalposts Of Life)&quot; (an unusual Christian-football waltz, and a 1976 Grammy nominee for Best Country Song). In 1977 he recorded &quot;Redneck Hippie Romance&quot; and &quot;Vegas&quot; (a duet with his wife Jeannie).

==Career at Columbia (1978–1983)==
Bare signed with Columbia Records and continued to have hits like &quot;Sleep Tight Good Night Man&quot;, which barely cracked the Top 10 in 1978, alongside continuing to score critical acclaim with his releases &quot;Bare&quot; and &quot;Sleeper Wherever I Fall&quot;. In 1979, he started off Rosanne Cash&#x27;s career in a big way by being her duet partner on the Top 20 hit &quot;No Memories Hangin&#x27; Round&quot;. In 1980, he almost cracked the Top 10 with &quot;Numbers&quot;, which came from his album &quot;Down and Dirty&quot;. On that album, Bare started to experiment with Southern rock, which continued with his following album, &quot;Drunk and Crazy&quot; (1980). The next year, Bare returned to his country roots with his Rodney Crowell-produced album &quot;As Is&quot;, featuring the single &quot;New Cut Road&quot;. Bare was still doing well chartwise into the early 1980s. In 1983, his duet with Lacy J. Dalton, &quot;It&#x27;s A Dirty Job&quot;, hit the Top 30. His last trip into the Top 30 came that summer with the novelty song &quot;The Jogger&quot;. He also released &quot;Used Cars&quot;, the theme song from the film of the same name.

==Film career==
Bare was also given an opportunity to star in movies. He acted in a Western with Troy Donahue, &quot;A Distant Trumpet&quot;, and had a memorable scene being branded for desertion, and a few episodes of the TV series &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;. He turned his back on Hollywood to pursue his country career.

==Later country career (1983–present)==
From 1983 to 1988, Bare hosted &quot;Bobby Bare and Friends&quot; on The Nashville Network which featured him interviewing songwriters who sang their hit songs on the show.

In 1985, Bare signed with EMI America Records where he scored three low-charting singles.

In 1998, he formed the band Old Dogs, with Jerry Reed, Mel Tillis and Waylon Jennings. As of 2023 he is the last surviving member of the group.

In 2005, he released his first new album in two decades, &quot;The Moon Was Blue&quot;, produced by his son Bobby Bare Jr., who is also a musician. He continues to tour today.

In 2012, Bare performed a duet of the song &quot;I&#x27;d Fight The World&quot; on the Jamey Johnson album &quot;Living for a Song: A Tribute to Hank Cochran&quot;.

On April 10, 2013, the CMA announced that Bare would be a 2013 inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Other 2013 Inductees include Cowboy Jack Clement and Kenny Rogers.

After being inducted in the 1960s but gradually drifting away, Bare was reinstated as a member of the Grand Ole Opry on April 7, 2018, by Garth Brooks.

==Eurovision 2012==
In January and February 2012, Bare joined up with Petter Øien at the 2012 Melodi Grand Prix to compete for Norway&#x27;s entry to the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, in May. His song &quot;Things Change&quot; got through to the Norwegian final where Øien and Bare finished third.

<doc id="1068979" wikidata="Q132833" url="?curid=1068979" title="Sphecidae">
<text>The Sphecidae are a cosmopolitan family of wasps of the suborder Apocrita that includes sand wasps, mud daubers, and other thread-waisted wasps.

The name Sphecidae was formerly given to a much larger grouping of wasps. This was found to be paraphyletic, so most of the old subfamilies have been moved to the Crabronidae.

==Biology==

The biology of the Sphecidae, even under the restricted definition, is still fairly diverse; some sceliphrines even display rudimentary forms of sociality, and some sphecines rear multiple larvae in a single large brood cell. Many nest in pre-existing cavities, or dig simple burrows in the soil, but some species construct free-standing nests of mud and even (in one genus) resin. All are predatory and parasitoidal, but the type of prey ranges from spiders to various dictyopterans, orthopteroids and larvae of either Lepidoptera or other Hymenoptera; the vast majority practice mass provisioning, providing all the prey items prior to laying the egg.

==Phylogeny==
This phylogenetic tree is based on Sann &quot;et al.&quot;, 2018, which used phylogenomics to demonstrate that both the bees (Anthophila) and the Sphecidae arose from within the former Crabronidae, which is therefore paraphyletic, and which they suggested should be split into several families; the former family Heterogynaidae nests within the Bembicidae, as here defined. These findings differ in several details from studies published by two other sets of authors in 2017, though all three studies demonstrate a paraphyletic &quot;Crabronidae.&quot;

===Family Sphecidae (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;)===


The old digger wasp family Sphecidae (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) was paraphyletic and has been broken up. Only the following subfamilies remain in the new family Sphecidae (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;) which is a monophyletic clade.

Subfamily Ammophilinae
* &quot;Ammophila&quot; 
* &quot;Eremnophila&quot; 
* &quot;Eremochares&quot; 
* &quot;Hoplammophila&quot; 
* &quot;Parapsammophila&quot; 
* &quot;Podalonia&quot; 

Subfamily Chloriontinae
* &quot;Chlorion&quot; 

Subfamily Sceliphrinae
*&quot;Chalybion&quot; 
*&quot;Dynatus&quot; 
*†&quot;Hoplisidia&quot; 
*&quot;Penepodium&quot; 
*&quot;Podium&quot; 
*†&quot;Protosceliphron&quot; 
* &quot;Sceliphron&quot; 
*&quot;Trigonopsis&quot; 

Subfamily Sphecinae
* &quot;Chilosphex&quot; 
* &quot;Isodontia&quot; 
* &quot;Palmodes&quot; 
* &quot;Prionyx&quot; 
* &quot;Sphex&quot; 
* &quot;Stangeella&quot; 

Both of the historical definitions of the Sphecidae (a conservative one, where all the sphecoid wasps other than ampulicids and heterogynaids were in a single large family, and a more refined one, where the seven large sphecid subfamilies were each elevated to family rank) have recently been shown to be paraphyletic, and the most recent classification is closer to the refined scheme; there are now seven families in addition to the Sphecidae and Crabronidae, all of which were formerly placed within Sphecidae.

===Family Crabronidae===
All the other digger wasp taxa that were formerly included in Sphecidae (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) were placed in the family Crabronidae, which was itself paraphyletic, and recent classifications have split Crabronidae into a number of smaller families, mostly formerly treated as subfamilies.

<doc id="1068987" wikidata="Q3631710" url="?curid=1068987" title="BATON">
<text>BATON is a Type 1 block cipher in use since at least 1995 by the United States government to secure classified information.

While the BATON algorithm itself is secret (as is the case with all algorithms in the NSA&#x27;s Suite A), the public PKCS#11 standard includes some general information about how it is used. It has a 320-bit key and uses a 128-bit block in most modes, and also supports a 96-bit electronic codebook mode. 160 bits of the key are checksum material. It supports a &quot;shuffle&quot; mode of operation, like the NSA cipher JUNIPER. It may use up to 192 bits as an initialization vector, regardless of the block size.

In response to a Senate question about encrypted video links, the NSA said that BATON could be used for encryption at speeds higher than those possible with Skipjack.

==Usage==
BATON is used in a variety of products and standards:
*APCO Project 25 (Public standard for land mobile radio) (Algorithm IDs 01 and 41)
*PKCS#11 (Public standard for encryption tokens)
*CDSA/CSSM (Another public standard)
*HAIPE-IS (NSA&#x27;s version of IPsec)
*FNBDT (Advanced flexible voice security protocol)
*Thales Datacryptor 2000 (a British network-encryption box)
*SecNet-11 (a crypto-secure 802.11b PC Card, based on the Sierra chip)
*Fortezza Plus (a PC Card product, used in the STE)
*SafeXcel-3340 (a HAIPIS network-encryption box)
*Numerous embeddable encryption modules: AIM, CYPRIS, MYK-85, Sierra (microchip), etc.

<doc id="1068988" wikidata="Q938685" url="?curid=1068988" title="Khami">
<text>Khami (also written as &quot;Khame&quot;, &quot;Kame&quot;, or &quot;Kami&quot;) is a ruined city located west of Bulawayo, in Zimbabwe. It was once the capital of the Kingdom of Butua of the Torwa dynasty. It is now a national monument and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986.

==Context==

The settlement that we see today was a development of the architectural form that emerged at Great Zimbabwe in the 13th century AD and a local Leopard&#x27;s Kopje culture that built platforms of rough walling on which houses would be constructed. Khami marks an innovation that recognised the environment in which was built. The area around Khami, being riverine, is hot and had problems with malaria. The stone found at Khami (laminar granite) was different from the ones found in other areas of Zimbabwe (biotite). With a mixture of dolerite, this stone was harder to quarry and produced shapeless building stone. It can be estimated that over 60% of the stone produced at these quarries would not be of building quality. The building blocks thus needed to be shaped, but even then the stones were not suitable for building free-standing dry stone walls. The builders thus made an innovation and produced retaining walls instead. Secondly, building platforms made the houses cooler than those in the open areas below. It also eliminated the problem of malaria for the lucky royals who stayed in the built-up areas. The walls are gravity retaining walls built without mortar. Unlike at Great Zimbabwe, some of the walls at Khami have foundations built with huge blocks which would have been lifted by at least four people. Excavations have revealed well-planned buildings especially at the Hill Complex, which was occupied by the king. The complex was first built up by creating terraces of rough walling. These stable walls were then covered up by quality walling of dressed stone blocks. Each terrace was highly decorated with either a checkerboard pattern, herringbone, or a cord pattern. The terraces leaned inwards so that gravity would not cause collapses. The terraces that were created by leaning inwards had wooden poles probably for the guards to hold on to as they walked along the high and steep walls.

==History==

Khami was the capital of the Torwa dynasty for about 200 years from around 1450 and appears to have been founded at the time of the disappearance of the state at Great Zimbabwe. After that (the traditional date is 1683), it was conquered by Changamire Dombo who led an army of Rozvi rebels from the Mwenemutapa (&quot;Monomotapa&quot;) State. Excavations seem to show that the site was not occupied after these Rozvi took over. The Rozvi made another Khami phase site, Danamombe (Dhlo-Dhlo), their new capital. In the 1830s Nguni speaking Ndebele raiders displaced them from Khami and many of the other sites they had established.

The site of Khami reveals seven built-up areas occupied by the royal family with open areas in the valley occupied by the commoners. The complex comprises circular, sometimes terraced, artificial platforms encased by dry stone walls. The beautifully decorated 6m-high by 68m-long retaining wall of the precipice platform bears a checkerboard design along its entire length. The platforms, rising 2–7m above the ground, carried dhaka (clay) huts and courtyards where those of lower status lived. The remnants of cattle kraals and huts for ordinary people can be seen below the Hill Complex. The ruins include a royal enclosure or Hill Complex, which had to be on higher ground than other buildings, stone walls and hut platforms, and also a Christian cross believed to have been placed by a contemporary missionary. There are also ruins on the eastern side of the Khami River. Other platforms are believed to have been cattle kraals and a retaining wall with a chequered pattern. Recent excavations (2000–2006) have revealed that the walls of the western parts of the Hill Complex were all decorated in chequer, herringbone, cord, as well as variegated stone blocks.

== Conservation ==
In the early 2000s, the National Museums and Monuments of Zimbabwe launched a conservation and recording programme whose purpose was to focus on preserving and restoring the stone walls. To date,the notable achievements are the stabilization and restoration of terrace walls on the Main, Cross and North platforms.Between 2000 and 2007, volunteers from the C.H.A.M association participated in a restoration effort.

<doc id="1069007" wikidata="Q1321141" url="?curid=1069007" title="Museum of the City of New York">
<text>The Museum of the City of New York (MCNY) is a history and art museum in Manhattan, New York City, New York. It was founded by Henry Collins Brown, in 1923 to preserve and present the history of New York City, and its people. It is located at 1220–1227 Fifth Avenue between East 103rd to 104th Streets, across from Central Park on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, at the northern end of the Museum Mile section of Fifth Avenue.

The red brick with marble trim museum was built in 1929–30 and was designed by Joseph H. Freedlander in the neo-Georgian style, with statues of Alexander Hamilton and DeWitt Clinton by sculptor Adolph Alexander Weinman facing Central Park from niches in the facade.

The museum is a private non-profit organization which receives government support as a member of New York City&#x27;s Cultural Institutions Group. Its other sources of income are endowments, admission fees, and contributions.

==History==

The museum was originally located in Gracie Mansion, where available space was limited. One of its first major exhibits was &quot;Old New York&quot;, presented in the American Fine Arts Building on West 57th Street in 1926. The success of the project led to a search for a new, permanent headquarters for the museum. A design competition was held between five invited architects, and the Colonial Revival design by Freedlander was selected. The city donated a site on Fifth Avenue, and funds for construction of the museum building were raised by public subscription. The original plans for the museum&#x27;s building were scaled back as a result of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, nevertheless, the building was dedicated on January 11, 1932.

On January 24, 1967, the museum building was designated a New York City landmark.

In 1982, the museum received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.&quot;

===Proposed move===

In 2000, the administration of mayor Rudy Giuliani told the museum that it could relocate to the historic Tweed Courthouse near City Hall in Lower Manhattan. El Museo del Barrio would then have moved across the street to occupy the current Museum of the City of New York building. This decision was overturned by the incoming administration of Michael Bloomberg, which decided to use the Courthouse as the headquarters for the new New York City Department of Education, causing MCNY&#x27;s then-director Robert R. McDonald to tender his resignation. McDonald was replaced in 2002 by Susan Henshaw Jones, who was at the time the president of the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C.

There was also an attempt to merge the museum with the New-York Historical Society, which did not come to fruition, and the museum was passed over for space at the World Trade Center site.

===Expansion===
The museum&#x27;s former director, Susan Henshaw Jones, recommitted MCNY to its East Harlem neighborhood by planning an extension to the museum. The groundbreaking for this extension, which included renovation of existing gallery space, as well as a new pavilion, took place on August 2, 2006, and it was completed in February 2008 with a ribbon cutting later that same year.

The pavilion gallery, designed by the Polshek Partnership, is glass addition, which has two levels for which to display artifacts. The original 1932 Georgian Revival building was also restored during this project, as well as additions including a vault for the museum&#x27;s silver collection, a research room and a room for the handling of artifacts. The total costs for the first phase of refurbishments came to $28 million.

In late 2011, the museum temporarily took over operation of the South Street Seaport Museum which reopened in January 2012.

==Collection==
The museum&#x27;s collection of over 1.5 million items – which is particularly strong in objects dating from the 19th and early 20th centuries – include paintings, drawings, prints, including over 3000 by Currier and Ives, and photographs featuring New York City and its residents, as well as costumes, decorative objects and furniture, antique toys– the museum was the first in the United States to establish a curatorial department for toys – ship models, rare books and manuscripts, marine and military collections, police and fire collections, and a theater collection which documents the golden age of Broadway theater. There are also dioramas about the city&#x27;s history as well as its physical environment. The museum also has a collection of original Marquand and Co. silver from the early 19th century. 

Among the rare items in the museum&#x27;s collection is a chair that once belonged to Sarah Rapelje, daughter of Joris Jansen Rapelje of Nieuw Amsterdam, and said to be the first child born in New York State of European parentage. The chair was donated by her Brinckerhoff descendants.

The museum is known for its comprehensive collection of photographic images, which includes works by noted photographers Percy Byron, Jacob Riis and Berenice Abbott, as well as many Depression-era Federal Art Project photographs. The collection also includes still photography by film director Stanley Kubrick.

MCNY was also the longtime home to recreations of two furnished rooms from the house of John D. Rockefeller, donated by the Rockefeller family. In 2008, the museum disposed of the rooms, donating one to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the other to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Notable as well is a model of New Amsterdam based on the Castello Plan of 1660.

==Notable exhibitions==
From October 2004 through July 2009, &quot;Perform&quot; was the only permanent exhibition in New York City focused on theater in New York. It included objects ranging from Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson&#x27;s tap shoes to advertising materials from &quot;Avenue Q&quot;.

Until September 15, 2019, the exhibition &quot;In the Dugout with Jackie Robinson: An Intimate Portrait of a Baseball Legend&quot; was on display. In honor of the centennial of Robinson&#x27;s birth, the exhibition featured memorabilia, rare footage, and published magazines of the Robinson family.

In February 2020, the exhibit &quot;City/Game: Basketball in New York&quot; opened. The exhibit explored the history of basketball in New York City, including players like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bob Douglass.

<doc id="1069015" wikidata="Q4756700" url="?curid=1069015" title="Andrew Coyne">
<text>James Andrew Coyne (born December 23, 1960) is a Canadian columnist with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and a member of the &quot;At Issue&quot; panel on CBC&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot;. Previously, he has been national editor for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; and a columnist with &quot;National Post&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Coyne was born in Ottawa, Ontario, the son of Hope Meribeth Cameron (née Stobie) and James Elliott Coyne, who was governor of the Bank of Canada from 1955 to 1961. His paternal great-grandfather was historian and lawyer James Henry Coyne. His sister is actress Susan Coyne. He is also the cousin of constitutional lawyer Deborah Coyne, who is the mother of Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s youngest child.

Coyne graduated from Kelvin High School in Winnipeg. Coyne studied at the University of Manitoba where he became the editor of &quot;The Manitoban&quot; student newspaper. He also spent two years reporting for the &quot;Winnipeg Sun&quot;. In 1981, Coyne transferred to the University of Toronto&#x27;s Trinity College, where his classmates included Jim Balsillie, Malcolm Gladwell, Tony Clement, Nigel Wright, Patricia Pearson, Atom Egoyan, and author and political strategist John Duffy. He received a BA in economics and history from Trinity. Coyne then went to the London School of Economics, where he received his master&#x27;s degree in economics.

== Career ==
After a six-year period as a &quot;Financial Post&quot; columnist from 1985 to 1991, Coyne joined &quot;The Globe and Mail&#x27;s&quot; editorial board. There, Coyne won two consecutive National Newspaper Awards for his work. He had a regular column in the &quot;Globe&quot; between 1994 and 1996, when he joined Southam News (later CanWest News Service) as a nationally syndicated columnist.

Coyne became a columnist with the &quot;National Post&quot; – the successor to the &quot;Financial Post&quot; – when it launched in 1998. Coyne left the &quot;Post&quot; in 2007 to work at &quot;Maclean&#x27;s.&quot;

Coyne left &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in 2011 to return to the &quot;Post&quot; as a columnist. In December 2014, he was appointed to the position of Editorials and Comment Editor. After years of writing a weekly Saturday column, Coyne&#x27;s contribution was absent from the edition published just prior to the 2015 Canadian federal election, because the column he wanted to submit called for a vote against the Conservative Party of Canada while the Post&#x27;s editorial board had endorsed the Conservatives. While Coyne was the head of the editorial board, the decision to endorse the Conservatives was made by the newspaper&#x27;s publisher Paul Godfrey. On election day, Coyne announced that as a result of the paper refusing to run his election column, he was resigning as the Post&#x27;s editorial page and comment editor but would remain as a columnist.

Coyne has also been published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, the now-defunct Canadian edition of &quot;Time&quot;, and other publications. Coyne has also written for the conservative magazine &quot;The Next City.&quot;

Coyne has been a longtime member of the &quot;At Issue&quot; panel on CBC&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot;, where he appeared as early as 2012 in the day of Peter Mansbridge. His role on the panel hosted by CBC Chief Political Correspondent Rosemary Barton has made him a household name appearing every Thursday evening alongside panelists Chantal Hébert and Althia Raj.

In November 2019, Coyne announced that he would henceforth be employed by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

Coyne is a proponent of the Century Initiative, a proposal spearheaded by Dominic Barton to increase Canada&#x27;s population to 100 million by 2100. He admits that this lofty goal might not increase Canada&#x27;s standard of living. Nevertheless he supports it because it is ambitious and might result in more global clout for his home country.

<doc id="1069018" wikidata="Q435679" url="?curid=1069018" title="Juice Newton">
<text>Juice Newton (born Judith Kay Newton; February 18, 1952) is an American pop and country singer, songwriter, and musician. Newton has received five Grammy Award nominations in the Pop and Country Best Female Vocalist categorieswinning once in 1983as well as an ACM Award for Top New Female Artist and two consecutive &quot;Billboard&quot; Female Album Artist of the Year awards. Newton&#x27;s other awards include a People&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Best Female Vocalist&quot; and the Australian Music Media&#x27;s &quot;Number One International Country Artist&quot;.

Newton has several Gold and Platinum records to her credit, including &quot;Juice&quot;, &quot;Quiet Lies&quot; and her first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. During the 1980s, she charted 14 top 10 hits across the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country, AC, and Hot 100 charts, with many of the recordings achieving crossover success and six of the songs hitting the No. 1 position.

==Early life and education==
Newton was born in Lakehurst, New Jersey. She is the daughter of a Navy officer. Her mother encouraged her interest in music, giving her a guitar for her 13th birthday. 

After graduating from First Colonial High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia, she attended Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California. During this time, she performed folk music in some local coffeehouses. She then formed a folk-rock band with guitarist and songwriter Otha Young and toured bars in Northern California with her band.

== Career ==

=== Early music career ===
In the early 1970s, Newton, Otha Young and Tom Kealey formed a band that would eventually be called Juice Newton &amp; Silver Spur, which was signed to RCA Records. The group released two albums for RCA, in 1975 and 1976, but scored only one charting country single with &quot;Love Is a Word&quot;. The band was dropped by RCA, then joined Capitol Records in 1977. The band broke up shortly after releasing just one more album.

In late 1977, Newton went solo, continuing to record for Capitol, and until 1982 Silver Spur remained the name of her backing band. Newton also sang backing vocals for three tracks on Bob Welch&#x27;s platinum solo debut album, including his hit &quot;Ebony Eyes&quot;.

Near the end of 1977, &quot;It&#x27;s a Heartache&quot; became Newton&#x27;s first solo record and a major hit in Mexico, where it was eventually certified Gold, and in 1978, she released it in the United States. “It’s a Heartache” became the first of what would eventually be her 11 &quot;Hot 100&quot; pop hits. Also in 1978, The Carpenters&#x27; version of the Newton/Young-penned song &quot;Sweet, Sweet Smile&quot; reached the Top 10 on both the Country and Adult Contemporary charts, and #44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. In 1978, Newton legally changed her name from &quot;Judy Kay Newton&quot; to &quot;Juice Newton&quot; (&quot;Juice&quot; having long been her nickname).

Newton&#x27;s solo debut album &quot;Well Kept Secret&quot; was released later in 1978. Neither &quot;Well Kept Secret&quot; nor its sole single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; charted, but Capitol Records did renew Newton&#x27;s contract. In 1979 Capitol&#x27;s investment in Newton began to pay off as Newton had her first Top-40 Country hit with &quot;Let&#x27;s Keep It That Way&quot; (another one-off single). Later that year, the album &quot;Take Heart&quot; featured five modestly-charting singles: &quot;Until Tonight&quot;, &quot;Any Way That You Want Me&quot;, &quot;You Fill My Life&quot;, &quot;Lay Back in the Arms of Someone&quot;, and &quot;Sunshine&quot;. In 1980, &quot;Sunshine&quot; became Newton&#x27;s second top-40 country chart single, &quot;You Fill My Life&quot; reached No. 41, and &quot;Until Tonight&quot; was No. 42. Both of Newton&#x27;s initial solo efforts performed with modest success but failed to have lasting impacts on the album charts.

=== Early 1980s pop music success ===
In 1981, Newton&#x27;s third solo album, simply titled &quot;Juice,&quot; was released. It spawned three consecutive Top-10 pop hits, namely &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; (written by Chip Taylor), &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;, and an updated version of &quot;The Sweetest Thing (I&#x27;ve Ever Known)&quot; (the original version had appeared on the Silver Spur debut album) earned Newton the first of several No. 1 Country chart singles. A fourth single &quot;Ride &#x27;Em Cowboy&quot; from &quot;Juice&quot; was released in 1984 to support Newton&#x27;s first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, reaching the Billboard Country Top 40 chart.

In 1981, Newton&#x27;s video for &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; was the first country-music video to air on MTV, and the 40th video to air on the channel overall. Newton was the third female solo artist to be featured on MTV&#x27;s first air date (after videos by Pat Benatar and Carly Simon).

&quot;Juice&quot; sold more than a million copies in the United States and went Triple-Platinum (300,000 copies) in Canada. &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; and &quot;The Sweetest Thing (I&#x27;ve Ever Known)&quot; each reached #1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, where Newton would chart regularly for the next several years. In 1982, Newton received two Grammy nominations for Best Female Vocalist: one for &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; in the Pop category, and another for &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; in Country.

These two singles became her biggest sellers in the United States, each earning an RIAA Gold certification. (Note: in 1981 and 1982, when these singles were certified, the RIAA standard for Gold singles was &quot;more than 1 million copies sold&quot;; in 1989, RIAA lowered the standard to 500,000 for Gold single certifications.) The songs were also sizable hits in Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries. For example, &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; peaked at No. 1 in Canada and No. 43 in the UK Singles Chart in 1981. While &quot;The Sweetest Thing (I&#x27;ve Ever Known)&quot; did not receive a U.S. certification, the song&#x27;s popularity propelled album sales from Gold to Platinum, and the recording remained in the Top 40 (of the Hot 100) for 18 weeks. &quot;Shot Full Of Love&quot; was released as a single in the UK, but failed to chart.

In the spring of 1982 Newton released her fourth solo album, &quot;Quiet Lies,&quot; which sold 900,000 copies in the United States. The album went platinum in Canada (100,000 copies). From &quot;Quiet Lies&quot; came the Top 10 Pop and Adult Contemporary hit &quot;Love&#x27;s Been a Little Bit Hard on Me&quot; (which garnered her another Pop Female Vocalist Grammy nomination). &quot;Break It to Me Gently&quot; was the second single and hit #1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, #2 on the Billboard Country chart, as well as #9 in Cash Box and #11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The recording, a contemporary remake of a Brenda Lee hit from the 1960s, won Newton her first Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance, beating out contemporaries Dolly Parton, Rosanne Cash, Emmylou Harris and Sylvia. The album&#x27;s third and final single, &quot;Heart of the Night&quot;, reached #4 on the Adult Contemporary chart in early 1983 and climbed to #25 on the Hot 100.

The album also garnered Newton an award from Australia as the &quot;Top International Country Artist&quot; for the continent. In 1982, Newton toured with country band Alabama on the &quot;Salem Spirit&quot; double-headliner tour. (Various acts opened for Newton and Alabama.)

The direction for Newton&#x27;s sixth and final Capitol album, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Looks,&quot; was decidedly more rock-oriented and experimental than her usual blending of folk, pop and country styles. The album spawned a moderate-sized hit with &quot;Tell Her No&quot; (Hot 100 No. 27/AC No. 14) and the title track, a rock-edged number that charted low in the Hot 100. The single &quot;Stranger at My Door&quot; had a brief run on the country charts. The album was a moderate success, selling more than 300,000 copies in the United States and going Gold in Canada (50,000 copies). (The song &quot;Dirty Looks&quot; was written by Dave Robbins and Van Stephenson, who would later become part of the Country group Blackhawk in the 1990s. The pair also wrote Newton&#x27;s 1984 country single &quot;Restless Heart&quot;.)

According to a 1984 front-page article in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, changes at Capitol led Newton to return to RCA. The 1984 album &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait All Night&quot; continued with a rock-oriented sound. The launch single, &quot;A Little Love&quot;, and the title track became Newton&#x27;s final charting pop singles to date, reaching No. 44 and No. 66, respectively; while &quot;Restless Heart&quot; made No. 57 on the country chart. &quot;A Little Love&quot; became Newton&#x27;s seventh and final Top-10 hit on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart, reaching the No. 7 spot. Newton&#x27;s final double-header &quot;Salem Spirit&quot; tour with Alabama took place during this time, with Bill Medley of The Righteous Brothers as the opening act.

=== From pop to country ===
Newton had always been moderately popular in country music; she responded to her waning popularity in the pop market by targeting her next album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Old Flame&quot;, solely to country audiences. The strategic move was a success; the album revitalized her career, reached No. 12 on the Billboard album chart and featured six Top-10 country hits, including the No. 1s &quot;You Make Me Want to Make You Mine&quot;, &quot;Hurt&quot;, and &quot;Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)&quot; (with Eddie Rabbitt), none of which (unlike her previous efforts) appeared at all on the pop charts. The duet was released to the public before the pop version &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot; by Gloria Loring and Carl Anderson; the pop version was released to radio and stores two weeks after Newton and Rabbitt&#x27;s version first appeared, even though it was recorded first. Newton&#x27;s version was originally available only on a special edition of the &quot;Old Flame&quot; album and on the Eddie Rabbitt album &quot;Rabbitt Traxx&quot;. The &quot;Old Flame&quot; album produced hit singles for more than sixteen months, with the final release being &quot;What Can I Do with My Heart&quot; (written by Otha Young), which reached the Top 10 in early 1987.

Newton returned to the Top 10 in 1988 with &quot;Tell Me True&quot; from her 1987 album &quot;Emotion&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, the progressive-country tune &quot;First Time Caller&quot;, stalled at No. 24. Her final album of the decade, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Cry&quot; (1989), was not promoted by the label and did not chart. But it did spawn her final Top-40 country hit to date, &quot;When Love Comes Around the Bend&quot;, which RCA refused to release as a single because Newton&#x27;s contract had not been renewed. 

After being dropped by RCA Records in 1989 (along with several other country artists, including Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers, as country music as a whole was about to undergo momentous change), Newton took time to focus on her family life. Newton took a hiatus from recording albums, touring sporadically until returning to the music scene in late 1990s when she released the albums &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot; (1998) and &quot;American Girl&quot; (1999).

=== 1990s to present ===
In 1994, Newton contributed the track &quot;Lovers of One Day&quot; to an Édith Piaf tribute album which also included songs by Pat Benatar and Donna Summer.

In 1995, Newton recorded a double-album of pop duets (which was slated to be sold via infomercial), but the project was riddled with legal issues, resulting in a low-impact, &quot;accidental&quot; release of the &quot;Platinum &amp; Gold&quot; series of duets in the early 2000s (the CD set was released without Newton&#x27;s permission). Subsequently, bootleg CDs including most of the duets turned up on U.S. store shelves as &quot;Gold &amp; Platinum, Volumes 7 and 8&quot;. Those CDs also contain 1995 solo versions of three of Newton&#x27;s pop hits &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Been a Little Bit Hard on Me&quot; and &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;. Newton&#x27;s duet partners included Willie Nelson, Melissa Manchester, The Pointer Sisters and Frankie Valli. In 1998, Newton released &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot;, a collection of seven re-recorded hits and three new songs, including the single &quot;When I Get Over You&quot;. The 1998 effort was quickly followed by &quot;American Girl&quot; in 1999, which was Newton&#x27;s first album of all-new material since 1989 and featured the single &quot;They Never Made It to Memphis&quot;. The collection featured tracks written by Otha Young, Freddie Mercury, Nanci Griffith, Tom Petty and Newton herself.

&quot;Every Road Leads Back to You&quot; (which consists of live material and a bonus EP of four studio recordings of original songs) was released in 2002 with an accompanying DVD. &quot;American Girl Vol. II&quot;, which was originally sold exclusively at cdbaby.com and at Newton&#x27;s live shows, was released in 2003 and reissued in 2006 and again in 2011 by Brookside Records.

In 2005, Newton appeared on the TV show &quot;Hit Me Baby, One More Time&quot; on which she performed a folk-rock rendition of Ashlee Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Pieces Of Me&quot; and a truncated version of &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;; online voters selected Newton&#x27;s performance as their favorite of the five acts that appeared on the episode. In the mid-2000s, Newton also contributed tracks to the albums &quot;An All-Star Tribute To Cher&quot; (&quot;Reason to Believe&quot;) and &quot;An All-Star Tribute to Shania Twain&quot; (&quot;Come On Over&quot;).

On November 15, 2007, Newton released &quot;The Gift of Christmas&quot;, her first Christmas album. The 12-song album includes a new version of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Needs Love to Be Christmas&quot; and &quot;Mary&#x27;s Boy Child&quot;, as well as a special Christmas version of &quot;For Believers&quot;, an Otha Young-penned song first recorded in 1983 for the &quot;Dirty Looks&quot; album.

On August 6, 2009, Newton&#x27;s longtime musical partner Otha Young died of cancer. The pair worked together for 37 years.

On October 26, 2010, Newton&#x27;s &quot;Duets: Friends &amp; Memories&quot; album was released by Fuel 2000. The album contained duets performed with Willie Nelson, Melissa Manchester, Frankie Valli and others. One single (&quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot;) has been released. In addition to the domestic album, an import edition was released on November 30, 2010.

On July 26, 2011, Fuel 2000 released &quot;Juice Newton: The Ultimate Hits Collection&quot;, which included her own version of the Carpenters&#x27; 1978 hit &quot;Sweet Sweet Smile&quot;, which Newton and Otha Young wrote in the &#x27;70s.

On May 7, 2012, BGO Records issued a two-CD set containing Newton&#x27;s three 1970s Capitol albums: &quot;Come To Me&quot;, &quot;Well Kept Secret&quot; and &quot;Take Heart&quot;. This marks the first time these albums have been available in the CD format. With the release of this set, all Newton&#x27;s 17 studio albums have been issued on CD.

In the 2016 film &quot;Deadpool&quot;, Juice Newton&#x27;s version of &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; was used for the opening credits montage. As a result, the track re-charted on the Billboard Country chart, reaching #43, and also hit #3 on Spotify&#x27;s World Music chart.

In 2021, Juice Newton&#x27;s version of &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; was featured in the critically acclaimed, Oscar-winning film &quot;Promising Young Woman&quot;. Newton&#x27;s recording is played for longer than four minutes during the film&#x27;s climactic scene.

==Personal life==
Newton bought a thoroughbred gelding named Puppy in 1983 and stabled him at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center. The center&#x27;s manager was polo star and coach, Tom Goodspeed. Newton married Goodspeed in 1985. They have two children: Jessica and Tyler. 

Besides continuing in the music business, Newton works as a horse trader, dealing mostly in European breeds. She also played polo herself.

<text>Catherine Vernice Glover (July 24, 1962 – September 24, 2024) was an American choreographer, dancer, singer, and rapper.

==Background==
Born on July 24, 1962, in the North Lawndale neighborhood of Chicago, Glover was raised first there and, from age 10 on, in Morgan Park, Chicago. The youngest of four girls born to Mildred Taylor and Doneall Glover, she was named after her maternal grandmother Catherine Taylor. Her birth date is given as July 23, 1964 in a number of obituaries; however, the date July 24, 1962 has been cited both after her death—by her manager, speaking with &quot;The New York Times&quot;—and during her life, by Glover herself, in a 1989 interview conducted by the performer&#x27;s cousin, Chicago-based journalist Chinta Strausberg, then with the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;.

Glover began performing at age 5 in a group called the Soullettes, started by her eldest sister Mitlitha and featuring the other three, Cat, Cynthia and Christine. At the age of eight, she appeared at the Playboy Towers Hotel in Chicago. Her first taste of mainstream television exposure came on the hit talent show &quot;Star Search&quot;, alongside dance partner Patrick Allen in the duo known simply as &quot;Pat &amp; Cat&quot;. Their act was the first to ever achieve a &quot;Perfect Score&quot; of Four Stars on the show. Glover was the standout member of the duo, winning the crowd over with her trademark dance move &quot;Cat Scat&quot;.

==Career==
Glover was best known for her work with Prince in the late 1980s. She choreographed and appeared in several of his videos and his concert film &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot;, traveled with him as a backing vocalist and dancer on the Sign o&#x27; the Times Tour and Lovesexy Tour, and rapped on both &quot;The Black Album&quot; track &quot;Cindy C.&quot; and the &quot;Lovesexy&quot; song &quot;Alphabet St.&quot; She was supposed to have released an album on Paisley Park, but the project was ultimately canceled.

Following her work with Prince, she released the EP &quot;Catwoman&quot; in 1989. Subsequently, she worked in London and Los Angeles, recording her own material as well as continuing her choreography and performing.

Glover recorded with Tim Simenon of Bomb the Bass, Louie Louie, and Steve Hopkins.

==Personal life and death==
Glover had four children and died at her home in Los Angeles, on September 24, 2024, at the age of 62. Her body was discovered the same day. Glover&#x27;s death was later revealed to be from congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

<doc id="1069033" wikidata="Q619324" url="?curid=1069033" title="Apollonia 6">
<text>Apollonia 6 was an American female singing trio founded in 1983 by Prince, as a successor to his previous group Vanity 6 following the departure of lead singer Vanity. Singers Brenda Bennett and Susan Moonsie continued from the earlier group, while actress and model Apollonia Kotero joined as frontwoman. The group released one album and dissolved in 1985.

==Origin==
Recording artist Prince created the group Vanity 6 in 1981, with singers Vanity (Denise Matthews), Brenda Bennett and Susan Moonsie. After a number of disputes with Prince, Vanity left the group in 1983 to pursue solo endeavors. She also left behind a co-starring role in Prince&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;.

Searching for a replacement, the film&#x27;s director, Albert Magnoli, met aspiring actress and model Patricia Apollonia Kotero. Prince asked her to use her middle name, and as Apollonia she both stepped into the film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, and became lead vocalist in the group, which was renamed Apollonia 6.

The group released one self-titled album, which featured Prince associates Jill Jones and Wendy &amp; Lisa on backing vocals.

A four-track video was filmed, based on the Apollonia 6 album, directed by Brian Thomson (Australian production designer of the original stage versions of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;), scripted by Keith Williams (concept writer for music videos by Phil Collins, Ray Parker Jr., and Donna Summer), with a cast consisting of Ricky Nelson, Edy Williams and Buck Henry. Shot in a Los Angeles film studio in 1985, and produced by British video firm Limelight, the video never went beyond rough cut. Footage from the project has appeared on many social networking sites, such as YouTube.

==Dissolution==

Prince had originally intended his classic tracks &quot;Manic Monday&quot; (later recorded by The Bangles), &quot;17 Days&quot; (later used as the B-side to &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;), &quot;Take Me with U&quot; (released on the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; soundtrack) and &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot; (recorded by Sheila E. in 1984) for the &quot;Apollonia 6&quot; album. Apollonia 6 were slated to open the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; tour with Prince and Sheila E., but that idea was scrapped after the group returned from a promotional tour of Europe. However, Apollonia 6 did appear on a few select dates of the Purple Rain tour, usually during the &quot;Baby I&#x27;m a Star&quot; encore. One such moment is documented in the &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot; and &quot;Baby I&#x27;m a Star&quot; performance on the VHS of &quot;Prince and the Revolution: Live&quot;, filmed in Syracuse, March 30, 1985.

After the group&#x27;s demise, Kotero continued working on TV shows such as &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; and in films for the next decade. She released a solo album in 1988 entitled &quot;Apollonia&quot; through Warner Bros. Records.

<doc id="1069034" wikidata="Q65122136" url="?curid=1069034" title="Western Massachusetts">
<text>Western Massachusetts, known colloquially as &quot;western Mass,&quot; is a region in Massachusetts, one of the six U.S. states that make up the New England region of the United States. Western Massachusetts has diverse topography; 22 colleges and universities including UMass in Amherst, MA, with approximately 100,000 students; and such institutions as Tanglewood, the Springfield Armory, and Jacob&#x27;s Pillow.

The western part of western Massachusetts includes the Berkshire Mountains, where there are several vacation resorts. The eastern part of the region includes the Connecticut River Valley, which has a number of university towns, the major city Springfield, and numerous agricultural hamlets. In the eastern part of the area, the Quabbin region is a place of outdoor recreation.

== History ==
=== Native inhabitants ===
Archeological efforts in the Connecticut River Valley have revealed traces of human life dating back at least 9,000 years. Pocumtuck tradition describes the creation of Lake Hitchcock in Deerfield by a giant beaver, possibly representing the action of a glacier that retracted at least 12,000 years ago. Western Massachusetts was originally settled by Native American societies, including the Pocomtuc, Nonotuck Mohawk, Nipmuck, and Mahican. Various sites indicate millennia of fishing, horticulture, beaver-hunting, and burials. The passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990 ordered museums across western Massachusetts and the country to repatriate these remains to Native peoples, an ongoing process.

The region was inhabited by several Algonkian-speaking Native American communities, culturally connected but distinguished by the place names they assigned to their respective communities: Agawam (low land), Woronco (in a circular way), Nonotuck (in the midst of the river), Pocumtuck (narrow, swift river), and Sokoki (separated from their neighbors). The modern-day Springfield metropolitan area was inhabited by the Agawam people. The Agawam, as well as other groups, belong to the larger cultural category of Alongkian Indians.

In 1634, a plague, probably smallpox, reduced the Native American population of the Connecticut River Valley to a tiny percentage of its previous size. Governor Bradford of Massachusetts writes that in Windsor, notably the site of a trading post, where European diseases often spread to Native populations, &quot;of 1,000 of [the Native Americans] 150 of them died.&quot; With so many dead, English colonists were emboldened to attempt significant settlement of the region.

=== Colonial and early Federal period ===
The first European explorers to reach western Massachusetts were English Puritans, who in 1635, at the request of William Pynchon, settled the land that they considered most advantageous for both agriculture and trading in modern-day Agawam, adjacent to modern Metro Center, Springfield. In 1636, a group of English colonists—lured by the promise of a &quot;great river&quot; and the northeast&#x27;s most fertile farmland—ventured to Springfield, where they established a permanent colony. Originally, this settlement was called &quot;Agawam Plantation&quot;, and administered by the Connecticut Colony. (Springfield lies only 4 miles north of Connecticut; however, Agawam included lands as far south as Windsor Locks, as far north as Holyoke, and as far west as Westfield.) In 1640, Springfield voted to separate from the Connecticut Colony following a series of contentious incidents and, after a brief period of independence, decided to align with the coastal Massachusetts Bay Colony, shaping the region&#x27;s political boundaries. The Massachusetts Bay Colony settled at the Connecticut River Valley&#x27;s most fertile land―stretching from Windsor, Connecticut, (once part of Springfield,) to Northampton, Massachusetts―from 1636 to 1654.

For the next several decades, Native people experienced a complex relationship with European settlers. The fur trade stood at the heart of their economic interactions, a lucrative business that guided many other policy decisions. White settlers traded wampum, cloth and metal in exchange for furs, as well as horticultural produce. Because of the seasonal nature of goods provided by Native people compared with the constant availability of colonial goods, a credit system developed. Land, the natural resource whose availability did not fluctuate, served as collateral for mortgages in which Native people bought goods from the colonists in exchange for the future promise of beavers. However, trade with the colonists made pelts so lucrative that the beaver was rapidly overhunted. The volume of the trade fell, from a 1654 high of 3723 pelts to a mere 191 ten years later. With every mortgage, Native people lost more land, although their population recovered and expanded from the old plague.

In a process that historian Lisa Brooks calls &quot;the deed game&quot;, colonists acquired an increasing amount of land from Indian tribes through debt, fraudulent purchases and a variety of other methods. Native people began to construct and gather in palisaded “forts”―structures that were not necessary beforehand. These sites were excavated in the 19th and 20th centuries by anthropologists who took cultural objects and human remains and displayed them for years in area museums. With the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990, a long process of repatriation began.

Tensions between the colonists and surrounding Indian tribes, which had already been poor for some time, continued to deteriorate in the years preceding the outbreak of King Philip&#x27;s War. Colonial encroachment on Indian lands combined with the decimation of the native population with European diseases led to increasing Native resentment and hostility towards the colonists. Though some Indians became integrated into colonial society, with many being employed in white households, numerous pieces of legislation were passed which prevented Indians from marrying settlers and staying in colonial settlements after dark, while colonists were prevented from living among the Indians.

In 1662, the leader of the eastern Massachusetts Wampanoag Indian tribe, Wamsutta, died shortly after being questioned at gunpoint by Plymouth colonists. Wamsutta&#x27;s brother, Chief Metacomet (known to inhabitants of Springfield as &quot;Philip,&quot;) began a war against colonial expansion in New England which spread across the region. As the conflict grew in its initial months, colonists throughout western Massachusetts became deeply concerned with maintaining the loyalty of &quot;their Indians.&quot; The Agawams cooperated, even providing valuable intelligence to the colonists.

In August 1675, a group of colonists in Hadley demanded the disarming of a “fort” of Nonotuck Indians. Unwilling to relinquish their weapons, they left on the night of August 25. A hundred colonists pursued them, catching up to them at the foot of Sugarloaf Hill, which was a sacred space for the Nonotucks called the Great Beaver. The colonists attacked, but the Nonotucks forced them to withdraw and were able to keep moving. The shedding of Native blood on sacred land was an attack on their entire kinship network, and caused Native peoples in western Massachusetts to join the ongoing conflict.

Following the war, the greater part of the Native American population left western Massachusetts behind. Many refugees of the war joined the Wabanaki in the north, where their descendants remain today. Native American influence remains evident in the land and culture of western Massachusetts, from the practice of tobacco farming to the names of cities and rivers

In 1777, George Washington and Henry Knox selected Springfield for the site of the fledgling United States&#x27; National Armory. Built atop a high bluff overlooking the Connecticut River, Washington and Knox agreed that Springfield provided an ideal location—beside a great river and at the confluence of major rivers and highways. For the following 200 years, the Springfield Armory would bring concentrated prosperity and innovation to Springfield and its surrounding towns.

After the American Revolution, a rebellion led by Daniel Shays culminated in a battle at the National Armory in Springfield.

== Geography ==
=== Berkshire Mountains ===
The Berkshires have long been patronized by artists (e.g. Herman Melville, who wrote &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; while living in Pittsfield; Edith Wharton, who wrote &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; and &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; while living in Lenox; and Norman Rockwell, many of whose painting were based on scenes that he observed in the town of Stockbridge). Cultural institutions include Lenox&#x27;s Tanglewood, Becket&#x27;s Jacob&#x27;s Pillow, and Stockbridge&#x27;s Norman Rockwell Museum, as well the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown. The city of Pittsfield is the largest community located in the Berkshires.

=== Connecticut River Valley ===
New England&#x27;s largest river, the Connecticut, flows through the center of its agricultural valley. Nearly bisected by the Holyoke Range and the Mount Tom Range, this relatively small area contains a number of college towns, urban environments, and rural hamlets. The portion of this valley in Massachusetts is also commonly referred to as the Pioneer Valley.

At its southern tip, the Springfield-Hartford region is home to 29 colleges and universities and over 160,000 university students—the United States&#x27; second highest concentration of higher learning institutions after the Boston metropolitan area.

Innovations originating in the valley include the sports of basketball (James Naismith, 1895) and volleyball (William Morgan, 1895); the first American automobile (Duryea, 1893); the first motorcycle company (Indian, 1901); the first use of interchangeable parts in manufacturing (Thomas Blanchard, 1825); and the first commercial radio station, (WBZ, 1920, from Springfield&#x27;s Kimball Hotel).

Significant Massachusetts towns and cities in the valley&#x27;s so-called &quot;Knowledge Corridor&quot; include Northampton, Amherst, Easthampton, Holyoke, Chicopee, West Springfield, East Longmeadow, Longmeadow, Ludlow, Agawam, and Westfield.

=== The Hilltowns ===
The Hilltowns include the areas of Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, and Hampden counties west of and above the escarpment bordering the ancient rift valley through which the Connecticut River flows. Elevations increase from about to at least in the escarpment zone. On top, elevations rise gradually to the west. Williamsburg in Hampshire County and Becket in Berkshire County are prominent hilltowns. Generally, the hilltowns west of the Connecticut River Valley were less attractive for agricultural uses, which resulted in later migration there than, for example, the fertile Connecticut River Valley. Subsistence farming predominated in this area.

The 1,000-foot elevation difference between uplands and the Connecticut River Valley produced streams and rivers with gradients around 40 feet/mile (8 meters/km) flowing through steep-sided valleys, notably the Westfield and Deerfield rivers and their larger tributaries. Mills were built to exploit the kinetic energy of falling water, and mill towns grew up around them, or company towns integrating production, residential and commercial activities.

The development of steam engines to free industrialization from reliance on water power brought about the so-called Second Industrial Revolution when railroads were built along the rivers to take advantage of relatively gentle grades over the Appalachians. And so as hilltop farming towns declined in importance, industrial towns in the river valleys rose to local prominence.

=== The Quabbin and Quaboag regions ===

In northern Massachusetts, the higher altitude area to the east of the Connecticut River Valley is known as the North Quabbin region. These northern municipalities include Warwick, Orange, Petersham, Phillipston, Wendell, New Salem, and Athol near the New Hampshire border.

The South Quabbin region (formerly the Swift River Valley) includes the towns of Barre, Belchertown, Pelham, Ware, Hardwick, Leverett, and Shutesbury. This area once included the four &quot;Lost Towns&quot; of Enfield, Dana, Greenwich, and Prescott, which were destroyed to make way for the Quabbin Reservoir.

Farther south, the area called the Quaboag Hills includes Hampden, Monson, Wales, Warren, Holland, and Wilbraham on the Connecticut border. Numerous other towns stretching east towards Worcester are sometimes included in the Quaboag Valley region.

Geology is similar to the Hilltown-Berkshire uplands with resistant metamorphic rocks overlain by thin and rocky soil. With less relief, the river valleys are less pronounced, but still moderately high gradient. The Quaboag Hills and Valley, the Quabbin Regions, and populated places stretching east towards Worcester are all locally known as &quot;Hill Towns&quot;; a term interchangeable with the Hill Towns west of the Pioneer Valley.

=== Geology ===
The mountain range in Berkshire County at the western end of Massachusetts is conventionally known as the &quot;Berkshires&quot;. Geologically, however, the Berkshires are a westward continuation of uplands west of the Connecticut River and a southern extension of Vermont&#x27;s Green Mountains.

The Hilltown-Berkshire upland ends at the valley of the Housatonic River which flows south to Long Island Sound, and in the extreme north west of Massachusetts at the Hoosic River, a tributary of the Hudson. From these valleys, uplands to the east appear as a rounded mountain range, rising some although they are actually a plateau. West of the Housatonic-Hoosic valley system rises the narrower Taconic Range along the New York border. Upper tributaries of the Hoosic separate Massachusetts&#x27; highest peak, Mount Greylock from both ranges, however Greylock&#x27;s geology connects it with the Taconics.

Most of this region is a rolling upland of schist, gneiss and other resistant metamorphics with intrusions of pegmatite and granite. Scraping by continental glaciers during the Pleistocene left thin, rocky soil that supported hardscrabble subsistence farming before the Industrial Revolution. There was hardly a land rush into such marginal land, but the uplands were slowly settled by farmers throughout most of the 18th century and organized into townships. Then in the early 1800s better land opened up in Western New York and the Northwest Territory. The hilltown agricultural population went into a long decline and fields began reverting to forest.

The Connecticut River Valley is an ancient downfaulted graben or rift valley that formed during the Mesozoic Era when rifting developed in the Pangaea supercontinent to separate North America from Europe and South America from Africa. Secondary rifts branched off the main crustal fracture, and this one was eventually occupied by the Connecticut River. The Metacomet Ridge is a series of narrow traprock ridges where lava penetrated this rift zone, beginning at the northern end of the graben near Greenfield and extending south across Massachusetts and Connecticut to Long Island Sound. Fossil dinosaur footprints in Holyoke attest to the life present in this region during the Mesozoic.

As continental glaciers receded near the end of the last glacial period, a moraine at Rocky Hill, Connecticut, dammed the river to create Lake Hitchcock, extending northward some inundating places such as Springfield, Agawam, and West Springfield, while certain highlands remained above water, (i.e. sections of Holyoke).

Accumulation of fine sediments during the era of Lake Hitchcock accounts for this region&#x27;s exceptionally rich agricultural soil, which attracted settlers as early as 1635. Although the Connecticut River Valley&#x27;s soil is the richest in New England, many of its fields have been covered by urban and suburban development. Regardless, the valley remains New England&#x27;s most productive farmland. Tobacco, tomatoes, sweet corn, and other vegetables are still produced there in commercial quantities.

== Demographics ==
Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire and Hampden counties, in the year 2020 collectively had 828,188 residents, a population greater than that of any one of the six smallest U.S. states. The population amounted to approximately 12.84% of the 2000 population of the entire state of Massachusetts, which was 6,349,097. Its average population density is 293.07 inhabitants per square mile (113.16/km2), compared to 422.34/km2 (1,093.87/sq mi) for the rest of Massachusetts, and 312.68/km2 (809.83/sq mi) for the state as a whole.

Western Massachusetts&#x27; population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs along the Connecticut River in an urban axis surrounding Springfield that is contiguous with greater Hartford, Connecticut (i.e. the Knowledge Corridor.) A secondary population concentration exists in the Housatonic-Hoosic valley due to the industrial heritage of Pittsfield and North Adams, and the development of tourism throughout that valley. This far-western zone is linked to New York City and Albany, New York, more than with the rest of Massachusetts, however both populated zones are ultimately part of the Northeast megalopolis. The rest of western Massachusetts is lightly populated, particularly the Hilltowns where densities below 50 persons per square mile (20 per km2) are the rule.

In descending order of size, its largest communities are: Springfield, Chicopee, Pittsfield, Westfield, Holyoke, Northampton, Agawam, West Springfield, Amherst Center (CDP), Easthampton, Longmeadow (CDP), East Longmeadow, North Adams, and Greenfield (CDP).

== Economy ==

Western Massachusetts has been compared as a microcosm of the rest of the United States. The third largest city in Massachusetts, Springfield is situated in the region, and it has struggled financially coming close to bankruptcy at the beginning of the 21st century. The unemployment rate in the area lags behind that of eastern Massachusetts by double though officials have pushed for ways to lure more longer-term business growth into the region to tap the abundance of students being turned out by colleges and universities in the area. To combat the higher cost of telecommunications which were roughly double that of eastern Massachusetts, the government of the Commonwealth invested $45.4 Million in building out a broadband network using Federal grant under the &#x27;Massachusetts Technology Park - MassBroadband 123&#x27; initiative, funds which were matched by $45 million in federal investment. The 1,200 mile &#x27;middle mile&#x27; project was completed in early 2014, connecting public institutions throughout central and western Massachusetts, but also providing a fiber-optic backbone to allow for further expansion in these regions. Building off of that project, the Commonwealth launched a &#x27;Last Mile&#x27; initiative targeting 54 communities that were unserved or under-served by broadband. That program has invested in municipal fiber-to-the-home networks, which are also supported by municipal bonds; private provider projects; and advanced wireless projects to connect homes and businesses in these communities. Small, rural towns such as Mount Washington, Mass., now have access to internet speeds that reach 500 megabit per second (Mbps) symmetrical service. In recent years there has been a push for adding high-speed rail from western Massachusetts for eastern Massachusetts. The residents of western Massachusetts have vibrant culture in and support the local mix of arts, tourism, and culture.

== Education ==

The decline of manufacturing as the region&#x27;s economic engine since World War II—and in particular, since the controversial closing of the Springfield Armory—was counterbalanced in western Massachusetts by growth in post-secondary education and healthcare.

This created new jobs, land development, and had gentrifying effects in many college towns. State and community-funded schools (e.g., University of Massachusetts Amherst and Westfield State University) were conspicuous in their growth, as were the region&#x27;s highly regarded liberal arts colleges, including Williams founded 1793, Amherst founded 1821, Mount Holyoke founded 1837, Smith founded 1871, and American International founded 1885.

Despite the gains in higher ed, the region has sought to obtain equitable share of the state&#x27;s education budget to place into local primary education as well. Several communities in western Massachusetts have fought to have changes made the Chapter 70 structure which the state presently uses to allocate education funding to cities and towns.

== Government and politics ==
Western Massachusetts used to be the Republican stronghold in an otherwise heavily Democratic state, but it is now consistently viewed by political analysts as one of the most politically liberal regions in the United States. In 2006 and 2010, the region voted heavily in favor of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Deval Patrick.

In &quot;Crash!ng the Party&quot;, Ralph Nader includes western Massachusetts as one of the few places in the country where he believes small-town spirit is still strong. In a 2010 editorial, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; berated communities in northern western-Massachusetts for resisting efforts to force consolidation of local school districts. In response, the Franklin County School Committee Caucus released a map that overlaid the county north-to-south over Metro Boston. The overlay reached from Rhode Island in the south to New Hampshire in the north and Framingham in the west.

In 2008 the Office of the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts opened a local office in western Massachusetts.

=== Counties ===
The western portion of Massachusetts consists approximately of the four counties of Franklin, Hampshire, Hampden and Berkshire. This set of four counties is sometimes regarded as defining western Massachusetts; for example, the Western Massachusetts Office of the Governor serves residents of these counties. Towns at the western edge of Worcester County, especially those near the Quabbin Reservoir, may be considered to be in western Massachusetts for some purposes; for example, two Worcester County towns have telephone numbers in western Massachusetts&#x27;s area code 413.

Hampden County, with over half of the population of western Massachusetts, includes the City of Springfield; to the north, Hampshire County contains the college towns of Northampton, Amherst and South Hadley; further north, rural Franklin County borders Vermont and New Hampshire; to the west is Berkshire County, bordering New York, Vermont and Connecticut and the other three counties.

After a number of county governments were eliminated in Massachusetts in the late 1990s (including Franklin, Hampshire, Hampden, Berkshire and Worcester), most county functions were assigned to the state government. The municipalities of Franklin and Hampshire counties then organized two voluntary county-oriented &quot;regional councils of government&quot;.

=== Attitude towards eastern Massachusetts/Boston ===
Some residents of western Massachusetts are critical towards Boston, the state&#x27;s capital and largest city. This group believes that the Massachusetts legislative and executive branches know little of and care little about western Massachusetts, which comprises 20% of the total population of the state.
Among the incidents that have created this feeling:
*The dismantling, submerging and disincorporation of four western Massachusetts towns, Prescott, Enfield, Greenwich (formerly in Hampshire County) and Dana (formerly in Worcester County), to build the Quabbin Reservoir that supplies water to Boston. Also disruption of small towns accompanying flood control projects such as Knightville Reservoir and construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike.
* Extreme inequities in additional state assistances per capita for western Massachusetts cities compared with eastern Massachusetts cities—for example, in 2006, for every $278.66 Boston received, its neighbor Cambridge received $176.37, Greater Boston&#x27;s westernmost city, Worcester, received $67.50, while the City of Springfield received $12.04 per person.
*Former state House Speaker Tom Finneran&#x27;s use of parliamentary rules to deny Northampton an election to fill a vacant House seat.
*Abolishing county governance placed formerly local property and employees under the direct administration of the eastern capital. This also affected representation of low-population/large-land rural towns which previously relied on their county seat in budgeting of road maintenance funding.

Long a haven for small, independent businesses, western Massachusetts has expressed conflicted feelings towards big box corporations, leading to controversies about zoning changes and variances that would allow companies such as Wal-Mart to build in western Massachusetts towns. The debate has been particularly strong in northern towns; for example, in Greenfield, Massachusetts.

<text>Bresaola ( , , , , ) is air-dried, salted beef (but it can also be made of horse, venison and pork) that has been aged two or three months until it becomes hard and turns a dark red, almost purple colour. It is made from top (inside) round, and it is lean and tender, with a sweet, musty smell. It originated in Valtellina, a valley in the Alps of northern Italy&#x27;s Lombardy region.

The word comes from the diminutive of Lombard (&#x27;braised&#x27;).

==Production==
A strict trimming process is essential to give a unique flavour. Legs of beef are thoroughly defatted and seasoned with a dry rub of coarse salt and spices, such as juniper berries, cinnamon and nutmeg. They are then left to cure for a few days. A drying period of between one and three months follows, depending on the weight of the particular bresaola. The meat loses up to 40% of its original weight during ageing.

In Valtellina, a similar process is applied to smaller pieces of meat. This produces a more strongly flavoured product, &quot;slinzega&quot;. Traditionally, horse meat was used for &quot;slinzega&quot;, but now other meats, such as venison and pork, are used as well.

==Serving==
As an antipasto, bresaola is usually sliced paper-thin and served at room temperature or slightly chilled. It is most commonly served and eaten with drizzled olive oil and lemon juice or balsamic vinegar, and served with rocket (rucola, arugula) salad, cracked black pepper, and fresh Parmesan cheese. Bresaola is sometimes confused with carpaccio, which is made from thin-sliced raw beef (the other ingredients are the same). Sliced bresaola should be stored well-wrapped in a refrigerator.

==Similar products==

The bresaola produced in Valtellina is a protected geographical indication (PGI) under EU Regulation 2081/92. Since this designation, dried beef made outside Valtellina may carry a generic name such as &quot;viande séchée&quot;. There are traditional products from several other areas that are similar:

* &quot;Biltong&quot;: air-dried cured meat from South Africa with a taste very similar to Bresaola
* &quot;Bündnerfleisch&quot; (&quot;Bindenfleisch&quot;): another Alpine dried meat from across the border in Grisons, Switzerland
* &quot;Brési&quot;: from the Doubs region of France
* &quot;Pastirma&quot;: a highly seasoned, air-dried cured beef that is found in the cuisines of the eastern Mediterranean.
* &quot;Suho meso&quot; : a smoked beef preparation from Bosnia and Herzegovina

<text>Stanisław Jerzy Lec (; 6 March 1909 – 7 May 1966), born Baron Stanisław Jerzy de Tusch-Letz, was a Polish aphorist and poet. Often mentioned among the greatest writers of post-war Poland, he was one of the most influential aphorists of the 20th century, known for lyric poetry and skeptical philosophical-moral aphorisms, often with a political subtext.

==Biography==

Son of the Baron Benon de Tusch-Letz and Adela Safrin, he was born on 6 March 1909 in Lemberg, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Lviv) to a Jewish nobilitated family. The family moved to Vienna at the onset of First World War, and Lec received his early education there. After the war the family returned to Lwów in the Second Polish Republic. Lec attended the Lemberg Evangelical School. In 1927 he matriculated and begun studies at Lwów&#x27;s Jan Kazimierz University in Polish language and law, which he graduated in 1933.

His literary debut was in 1929. Much of his early work was lyric poetry appearing in left-wing and communist magazines. He collaborated with the communist “&quot;Dziennik Popularny&quot;&quot; between 1933 and 1936. In 1935 he co-founded the satirical magazine &quot;Szpilki&quot; (Pins). A &quot;literary cabaret&quot; he founded in Lwów in collaboration with Leon Pasternak in 1936 was closed by the authorities after several performances. Nor did his law-abiding image improve after he took part in the Convention of Culture Workers, a radical congress initiated by the international communist movement Popular Front in the same year. Later that year he spent a few months in Romania, afraid that his activism could lead to his arrest in Poland. He spent the next two years in Warsaw, where he was involved with a number of other left-leaning publications.

Following the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, Lec fled Warsaw, returning to his hometown, Lwów. Lec spent the years 19391941 there, while the city along with the rest of Polish Eastern Borderlands was occupied by the Soviet Union after the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939. While in the Soviet Union, Lec joined in the literary life under the auspices of Ukrainian SSR authorities. He contributed to the magazine “New Horizons”. His poems, satires, articles, and translations from Russian were published in ”Krasnoe Znamya” magazine. In 1940 he joined the Union of Soviet Writers of Ukraine and became a member of the editorial board of “The Literary Almanac” in Lwów. Through this and similar activities he became one of the most prolific pro-Soviet Polish writers, producing numerous works praising the Soviet regime, including the first poem about Stalin written in the Polish language (&quot;Stalin&quot;, &quot;Czerwony Sztandar&quot;, 5 December 1939). A number of his works appeared in the &quot;Czerwony Sztandar&quot; (Red Banner) newspaper. On 19 November 1939 Lec signed a resolution calling for the incorporation of Polish Eastern Borderlands into the territory of the Soviet Union. Lec&#x27;s collaboration with the Soviet authorities remains controversial to this day, though he has been defended by Adam Michnik who wrote in his 2007 book that Lec has been unfairly branded by critical opinion as a &quot;Soviet collaborator&quot; on the basis of his &quot;weakest, least successful, or most frankly conformist pieces&quot;.

After Nazi Germany&#x27;s attack on the Soviet Union he was imprisoned in a German work camp in Tarnopol (now Ternopil), from which he made several attempts to escape. He received a death sentence for his second attempt to escape, but managed to successfully escape in 1943. In his autobiography he described his escape as having taken place after he killed his guard with a shovel when taken to dig his own grave. This became the subject of one of his most famous poems &quot;He who had dug his own grave&quot; (from the cycle &quot;To Abel and Cain&quot;):
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em; font-size: 98%&quot;&gt;
He who had dug his own grave
looks attentively
at the gravedigger&#x27;s work,
but not pedantically:
for this one
digs a grave
not for himself.
&lt;/poem&gt; 
After his escape he participated in partisan warfare within the communist formations of Polish resistance (the Gwardia Ludowa and the Armia Ludowa), and eventually served in regular units of Polish People&#x27;s Army until the end of the war, which he finished with the rank of major. He also edited the communist resistance underground newsletter &quot;Żołnierz w Boju&quot; (Soldier in Combat) and the communist magazine &quot;Wolny Lud&quot; (Free Nation).

Lec&#x27;s wartime service allowed him to obtain a diplomatic post as a cultural attaché in Vienna. Becoming disillusioned with the Communist government, he left for Israel in 1950 with his wife, son and daughter. Lec couldn&#x27;t adapt to the life in Israel and returned to Poland with his son after two years there. His wife and daughter remained in Israel. He moved to a small town in which he had been in the underground during the war, and remarried there before returning to Warsaw. At first he worked as a translator, as the Polish communist authorities had taken away his right to write or publish until the late 1950s. He was immensely popular, and despite the anti-communist and anti-totalitarian themes of his later works, he was given an official state funeral in Warsaw when he died on 7 May 1966. That year, he was awarded the Officer Cross of the Order Polonia Restituta.

==Works==
Lec&#x27;s early works were primarily lyrical poetry. In his later years, he became known for aphorisms and epigrams. He was influenced by religious (Jewish and Christian) as well as European cultural traditions. In his works he often modernized ancient messages, while preserving their universality. His notable poems such as &quot;Notatnik polowy&quot; (Field Notebook; 1946), &quot;Rękopis Jerozolimski&quot; (The Jerusalem Manuscript; 1950–1952, reedited in 1956 and 1957), and &quot;Do Kaina i Abla&quot; (To Cain and Abel; 1961) had a theme of exploring the world through irony, melancholy, and nostalgia. His later works, usually very short (aphorisms), through techniques such as wordplay, paradox, nonsense, abstract humor, and didacticism convey philosophical thoughts through single phrases and sentences. Collections of Lec’s aphorisms and epigrams include &quot;Z tysiąca jednej fraszki&quot; (From a Thousand and One Trifles; 1959), &quot;Fraszkobranie &quot;(Gathering Trifles; 1967); and &quot;Myśli nieuczesane&quot; (Unkempt Thoughts; 1957, followed by sequels in 1964 and 1966).

His work has been translated into a number of languages, including English, German, Slovak, Dutch, Italian, Serbian, Croatian, Swedish, Czech, Finnish, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian and Spanish.

==Lec&#x27;s aphorisms==

*Those who tried to enlighten were often hanged on lampposts.
*Beyond each corner new directions lie in wait.
*It&#x27;s a shame to suspect, when you are quite certain.
*The exit is usually where the entrance was.
*Some like to understand what they believe in. Others like to believe in what they understand
*He who limps is still walking.
*In a war of ideas it is people who get killed.
*The mob shouts with one big mouth and eats with a thousand little ones.
*Even a glass eye can see its blindness.
*To whom should we marry Freedom, to make it multiply?
*I am against using death as a punishment. I am also against using it as a reward.
*You can close your eyes to reality but not to memories.
*Optimists and pessimists differ only on the date of the end of the world.
*Is it a progress if a cannibal is using knife and fork?
*If a man who cannot count finds a four-leaf clover, is he lucky?
*No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.
*All is in the hands of man. Therefore wash them often.
*Do not ask God the way to heaven; he will show you the hardest one.
*If you are not a psychiatrist, stay away from idiots. They are too stupid to pay a layman for his company.
*Thoughts, like fleas, jump from man to man, but they don&#x27;t bite everybody.
*The first condition of immortality is death.
*Suppose you succeed in breaking the wall with your head. And what, then, will you do in the next cell?
*When smashing monuments, save the pedestals—they always come in handy.
*Do not expect too much of the end of the world.
*Even the masochists tell everything when tortured. From sheer gratitude.

==Family==
Lec was married twice, first with Elżbieta Rusiewicz-Zuckerman, with whom he had a son Jan (1949) and a daughter Małgorzata (1941), and second with Krystyna Świętońska, with whom he had a son Tomasz (1955).

==Influence==
Roman Turovsky composed a tombeau for Lec in 2018.

<text>Riverview is a town in Albert County, New Brunswick, Canada. Riverview is located on the south side of the Petitcodiac River, across from the larger cities of Moncton and Dieppe.

Riverview is the largest town in New Brunswick, and despite being designated as a town it is the fifth-largest municipality in the province, being more populous than the cities of Edmundston, Bathurst, Campbellton, and Miramichi.

==History==

Though the Petitcodiac River was a regular transportation corridor for aboriginal peoples, the first known settlements in the area were three Acadian &quot;villages&quot; in what are now Turtle Creek, Lower Coverdale and Point Park. The French-speaking families were forced to abandon the area in 1758 during the Grand Derangement. Resettlement of what would become Riverview began around 1783 when settlers from Yorkshire, England began to farm there. The Town of Riverview was formed on July 9, 1973 with the amalgamation of the three villages of Bridgedale, Gunningsville and Riverview Heights. Harold Findlay became the first mayor and seven councillors were elected at-large to serve a population of 14,177. Since that time, Riverview has grown to include almost 19,130 represented by four ward councillors and three councillors-at-large.

Riverview&#x27;s first female mayor was Anne Seamans who served until her retirement in 2021.

<text>Deborah Margaret Ryland Coyne (born February 24, 1955) is a Canadian constitutional lawyer, professor, and author. She is the cousin of journalist Andrew Coyne and actress Susan Coyne, and the niece of former Bank of Canada governor James Elliott Coyne.

==Biography==
Coyne grew up in Ottawa. She graduated from Queen&#x27;s University with a degree in economics and history in 1976. She received a Bachelor of Laws degree from Osgoode Hall Law School of York University in 1979 and a Master of Philosophy from University of Oxford in international relations in 1982.

She was an employee in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office of John Turner, before spending two years teaching constitutional law at the University of Toronto Law School; she has also worked for the Business Council on National Issues, the Ontario Health Service Appeal and Review Board, and the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

For years, Coyne dated former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Their child, Sarah Elisabeth Coyne, is Trudeau&#x27;s only daughter, and attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Her second child, Matthew Coyne, is the son of Canadian journalist Michael Valpy. Valpy and Coyne have since divorced.

Deborah Coyne now lives in Toronto.

==Political involvement==

===Opposition to the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords===
Deborah Coyne took a role in opposing the Meech Lake Accord, a comprehensive package of constitutional amendments designed to gain the province of Quebec&#x27;s formal acceptance of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. Coyne was among many prominent Liberals who disagreed with the Accord, including Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Donald Johnston and Jean Chrétien, although the issue split the federal Liberal caucus. She was a founding member of the Canadian Coalition on the Constitution, a grass-roots group that opposed the agreement. From 1989 to 1991, Coyne served as constitutional advisor to Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells. Among the premiers, Wells was the staunchest opponent of the Meech Lake Constitutional Accord. Following the death of the Accord, partly at the hands of the Newfoundland House of Assembly, she opposed the Charlottetown Accord, a subsequent attempt to amend the Canadian constitution. The Charlottetown agreement was submitted to a national referendum in 1992 and was ultimately rejected by a majority of Canadian voters. Coyne led one of the &quot;No&quot; committees in the campaign and spoke widely against the deal.

===Liberal candidate===
Until the 2006 federal election was called, she was a member of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. In that election, she ran in the electoral district of Toronto—Danforth as a Liberal Party candidate against New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton. Coyne finished second to Layton with 17,256 votes, or 34.2%.

Coyne was nominated in March 2007 as the Liberal Party of Canada candidate in Toronto Danforth but withdrew later in the year. In 2008, she sought the federal Liberal nomination in the riding of Don Valley West but withdrew in favour of Rob Oliphant.

===Liberal leadership campaign===
On June 27, 2012, Coyne announced that she would be a candidate for leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, during the Party&#x27;s 2013 leadership contest, which was won ultimately by Justin Trudeau. Her campaign was managed by blogger Jeff Jedras.

Following the leadership campaign, Coyne made an unsuccessful bid for the Liberal Party of Canada&#x27;s nomination in Ottawa West—Nepean in 2014.

===Move to the Green Party===

On February 26, 2015, Green Party of Canada Leader Elizabeth May announced that Coyne had been appointed as a senior policy advisor, noting &quot;Deborah&#x27;s thoughtful approach to One Canada for all Canadians complements the vision of the Green Party of Canada.&quot; Coyne was the Green Party of Canada candidate in the Ottawa riding of Carleton for the 2015 federal election, where she finished fourth with just over 3% of the vote.

Since the 2015 federal election, Coyne has stepped away from partisan politics and no longer holds a membership in any political party.

<text>Apocalypso is a novel by the British author Robert Rankin.

A crack team of paranormal investigators are dispatched to recover a crashed spaceship from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

According to his autobiography, I, Robert, Rankin was unhappy with how he portrayed certain characters within this story. Before releasing the book on his own E-imprint, he edited out numerous jokes which he felt to be unsavory.

<doc id="1069069" wikidata="Q2983287" url="?curid=1069069" title="Michael (Franz Ferdinand song)">
<text>&quot;Michael&quot; is a song by Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand. It was released as the fourth single from their eponymous debut studio album on 16 August 2004 through Domino Records. The song was notable for its homoerotic lyrics such as &quot;stubble on my sticky lips&quot; and &quot;beautiful boys on a beautiful dancefloor&quot;.

&quot;Michael&quot; released in multiple formats, including a 7-inch vinyl, two 12-inch vinyls, and two CDs. The second CD that was released was pulled from stores a day after its release due to chart ineligibility as it had three tracks on it instead of two, which is the allowed number of tracks for the CD2 format. It was later re-released with only two tracks. The song experienced commercial success, peaking at number 17 on the UK Singles Chart, number 39 on the Irish Singles Chart, and number 15 on the Finnish Singles Chart.

==Composition and lyrics==
Frontman Alex Kapranos stated in an interview to the UK magazine &quot;Boyz&quot; that the song was written about two friends of his: &quot;It was one night when me and the band were out with friends from Glasgow, and we went to this warehouse dance party thing called Disco X. It was a very debauched night and these two friends got it together in a very sexy way.&quot;

Reviewer Alexis Petridis praised the song&#x27;s &quot;intriguing combination of sly humour and bug-eyed lust, as if the song&#x27;s central character started camping it up for a laugh and ended up in rather deeper water than he had anticipated...You simply don&#x27;t get songs like Michael very often in current rock music.&quot;

===Secret message===

The song contains a secret message from 1:35 to 1:39 saying, &quot;She&#x27;s worried about you, call your mother&quot;, if played backwards. According to &quot;franzferdinand.net,&quot; bassist Bob Hardy was getting a bit worried about calling his mother back home, so the band added the backwards lyrics in as an homage. Hardy has said that he has no knowledge of the lyrics being there and he thought it was just a positive message to put on the track.

==Release==
The song was released in the UK on 16 August 2004 as two CD singles and a 7-inch single. Due to a breach of UK chart rules by providing three tracks on the CD2 format instead of two, in what the band described in a press statement as a &quot;silly schoolboy error&quot;, sales of the original CD2 format were disqualified. The disc was withdrawn within a day of release, to be replaced by the end of the week by a two-track version, omitting &quot;Tell Her Tonight&quot;. This track was released as a free download from Franz Ferdinand and Domino Records&#x27; websites from 17 August. Despite this, the single still reached number 17 in the UK and number 39 in Ireland.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Michael&quot; features the band members playing at an underground dance club. A man walks in and studies himself in a mirror, before joining the club. Throughout the video, the occupants are being replayed over and over as like in a short video, and show absolutely no emotion whatsoever, as the band plays. The man dances on the dance floor, but the occupants stare at him with murderous intent, and one sheds a tear, the man realizing that due to him not rewinding over and over, the occupants have found an outcast, or something of a sacrifice. The occupants form a circle around the man, and they tear out the man&#x27;s arm, which emits a white beam of light, and the occupants stand in a circle as light overtakes them. The final scenes show the bands with multiple limbs. Alex Kapranos has three arms and a double-sided guitar, Nick McCarthy has two heads, Bob Hardy has four arms and two stomachs, and Paul Thomson also has three arms and plays the drum with three sticks.

==Alternative version==
The song was recorded alternatively in May 2004 in Hamburg, Germany, as a duet, and it was originally intended for release as a single. Without changing the lyrics, the reworked track was meant to take the perspective of a male love interest and female love interest fighting over Michael. Catriona Shaw of the band Queen of Japan provided the female vocals of this version of the track. In the end the band felt that the homoerotic undertones of the song became too diluted, so decided not to use it for the release of the track as a single and stuck with the original album version.

* The re-issue of CD2 omits &quot;Tell Her Tonight&quot;.

<text>The Crabronidae is a large family of wasps within the superfamily Apoidea.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
This family has historically been treated as a subfamily in the now-defunct Spheciformes group under the family Sphecidae. The Spheciformes included well over 200 genera, containing well over 9000 species. Revision of these taxa resulted resulted in the restriction of the Sphecidae to what was once the subfamily Sphecinae. As a result, the former Crabroninae was elevated to family status as Crabronidae. Subsequent revision has further restricted the Crabronidae. Several of the subfamilies of the Crabronidae are often treated as families in their own right, as is true of the most recent phylogenies. Of these lineages of Apoidea, only three were not included within Crabronidae in the past: Ampulicidae, Sphecidae, and Anthophila.

The following phylogenetic tree is based on Sann &quot;et al.&quot;, 2018, which used phylogenomics to demonstrate that both the bees (Anthophila) and the Sphecidae arose from within the former Crabronidae, which is therefore paraphyletic, and which they suggested should be split into several families; the former family Heterogynaidae nests within the Bembicidae, as here defined. These findings differ in several details from studies published by two other sets of authors in 2017, though all three studies demonstrate a paraphyletic &quot;Crabronidae&quot; and the need to establish additional families.

Further analysis by Sann &quot;et al.&quot; in 2021 resulted in the former Entomosericini (from Pemphredoninae) and Eremiaspheciinae being elevated to family status as Entomosericidae and Eremiaspheciidae, respectively. The true phylogentic placements for both small families remain unresolved but outside of either Pemphredonidae, Psenidae, and the lineage comprising Ammoplanidae and bees.

<doc id="1069072" wikidata="Q2226947" url="?curid=1069072" title="Economy of Europe">
<text>The economy of Europe comprises about 748 million people in 50 countries. Throughout this article &quot;Europe&quot; and derivatives of the word are taken to include selected states whose territory is only partly in Europe, such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia, and states that are geographically in Asia, bordering Europe and culturally adherent to the continent, such as Armenia and Cyprus.

There are differences in wealth across Europe which can be seen roughly along the former Cold War divide, with some countries breaching the divide (Greece, Portugal, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia). Whilst most European states have a GDP per capita higher than the world&#x27;s average and are very highly developed, some European economies, despite their position over the world&#x27;s average in the Human Development Index, are relatively poor. Europe has total banking assets of more than $50 trillion, the United Kingdom accounts for 25% ($12 trillion) of Europe’s total banking assets followed by France with 20% ($10 trillion) and Germany with 15% ($7 trillion). Europe Global assets under management is more than $20 trillion, with the United Kingdom accounting for more than 40% ($8 trillion) of Europe’s total AUM followed by France with 20% ($4 trillion) and Germany with 12% ($2 trillion). London and Paris are by far the richest cities in Europe, each with a GDP exceeding $1 trillion. London and Paris are major economic hubs in Europe, with the London Stock Exchange and Euronext Paris, the two largest stock exchanges in Europe by market cap.
The formation of the European Union (EU) and in 1999 the introduction of a unified currency, the Euro, brought participating European countries closer through the convenience of a shared currency. Various European states have increased their economic links through regional integration. The EU is a &quot;sui generis&quot; political entity, combining the characteristics of both a federation and a confederation. As one entity, the union is one of the largest economies in the world, having influence on regulations in the global economy due to the size of its single market with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

Europe&#x27;s largest national economies by nominal GDP over US$1.0 trillion are: Germany ($4.43 trillion), United Kingdom ($3.33 trillion), France ($3.05 trillion), Italy ($2.19 trillion), Russia ($1.86 trillion), Spain ($1.58 trillion), Netherlands ($1.09 trillion).

Europe&#x27;s largest national economies by nominal GDP PPP over US$1.0 trillion are: Russia ($6.91 trillion), Germany ($6.02 trillion), France ($4.36 trillion), United Kingdom ($4.28 trillion), Italy ($3.60 trillion), Spain ($2.67 trillion), Poland ($1.89 trillion), Netherlands ($1.46 trillion).

In the International Comparison Program 2021, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region was linked through the standard global core list approach, unlike in ICP 2017. Based on the results, the World Bank announced that in 2021 Russia was the world&#x27;s 4th largest economy (int$5.7 trillion and 3.8 percent of the world) and the largest economy in Europe and Central Asia when measured in PPP terms (15 percent of the regional total), followed by Germany (13 percent of the regional economy).

Europe is one of the world’s largest trading entities, with Germany, France and the United Kingdom serving as the primary economic powerhouses in terms of both exports and imports. Germany is Europe’s largest exporter and importer and the third-largest exporter globally, with over $2 trillion in exports in 2022. Germany is also a major importer, with $1.5 trillion in imports in 2022, reflecting its role as a key player in global supply chains. France is the second-largest exporter in Europe, with over $1 trillion in exports in 2022. France is also a significant importer, with $850 billion in imports in 2022, the second largest importer in Europe. The United Kingdom is the third-largest exporter in Europe, with over $1 trillion in exports in 2022. The United Kingdom is also a significant importer, with $800 billion in imports in 2022, the third largest importer in Europe.

Of the top 500 largest corporations measured by revenue (Fortune Global 500 in 2010), 184 have their headquarters in Europe. 161 are located in the EU, 15 in Switzerland, 6 in Russia, 1 in Turkey, 1 in Norway. 
With 30 companies that are part of the world&#x27;s biggest 500 companies, France was in 2023 the most represented European country in the 2023 Fortune Global 500, ahead of Germany (27 companies) and the UK (15). With 62 companies that are part of the world&#x27;s biggest 2000 companies, France was again in 2023 the most represented European country in the 2023 Forbes Global 2000, ahead of the UK (60 companies) and Germany (50).
As noted in 2010 by the Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells, the average standard of living in Western Europe is very high: &quot;The bulk of the population in Western Europe still enjoys the highest living standards in the world, and in the world&#x27;s history.&quot;

== Economic development ==

=== Pre–1945: Industrial growth ===
Prior to World War II, Europe&#x27;s major financial and industrial states were the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain, spread rapidly across Europe, and before long the entire continent was at a high level of industry. World War I briefly led to the industries of some European states stalling, but in the run-up to World War II Europe recovered well and was competing with the ever-increasing economic might of the United States of America.

However, World War II caused the destruction of most of Europe&#x27;s industrial centres and much of the continent&#x27;s infrastructure was laid to waste.

=== 1945–1992: The Cold War era ===
Following World War II, European governments were in tatters. Many non-Socialist European governments moved to integrate their economies, laying the foundation for what would become the European Union. This meant a huge increase in shared infrastructure and cross-border trade. Whilst these European states rapidly improved their economies, by the 1980s, the state-run economies of the COMECON group were struggling, mainly due to the massive cost of the Cold War. The GDP and the living standards of Central and Eastern European states were lower than in other parts of Europe.

The European Community grew from 6 original members following World War II, to 12 in this period.

Average living standards in Europe rose significantly during the post-war period, as characterised by these findings:

Per capita private consumption (PPSs) in 1980
* Luxembourg: 5495
* France: 5395
* Germany, Federal Republic: 5319
* Belgium: 5143
* Denmark: 4802
* Netherlands: 4792
* United Kingdom: 4343
* Italy: 4288
* Ireland: 3029

Per capita personal disposable income (PPSs) in 1980
* Belgium: 6202
* France: 6044
* Germany, Federal Republic: 5661
* Netherlands: 5490
* Italy: 5378
* Denmark: 4878
* United Kingdom (UK): 4698

=== Rise of the European Union ===
When the &#x27;Eastern Bloc&#x27; dissolved around 1992, these states struggled to adapt to free-market systems. There was, however, a huge variation in degrees of success, with Central European states such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Poland adapting reasonably quickly, whilst states that used to form the USSR such as Russia, Belarus and Ukraine struggled to reform their crumbling infrastructures.

Many developed European countries were quick to develop economic ties with fellow European states, where democracy was reintroduced. After the Revolutions of 1989, states in Central Europe and the Baltic states dealt with change, former Yugoslavian republics descended into war and Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are still struggling with their old systems.

Europe&#x27;s largest economy, Germany, struggled upon unification in 1991 with former communist German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, influenced by the Soviet Union. The GDR had much of its industrial infrastructure removed during the Cold War, and for many years unified Germany struggled to build infrastructure in the former East Germany up to the level of former West Germany.

Peace did not come to Yugoslavia for a decade, and by 2003, there were still many NATO and EU peacekeeping troops present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, and Kosovo. War severely hampered economic growth, with only Slovenia making any real progress in the 1990s.

The European economy was affected by the September 11 Attacks in the United States in 2001, with Germany, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom being the worst hit. But, in 2002/2003, the economy began to recover from the attacks in US.

The total size of the economy of Europe was by this time dominated by the EU, a union with then 15 of Europe&#x27;s states as full members. EU membership was seen as something to aspire to, and the EU gave significant support and aid to those Central and Eastern European states willing to work towards achieving economies that met the entry criteria. During this time, 12 of the 15 members of the EU became part of the Eurozone, a currency union launched in 1999, whereby each member uses a shared currency, the euro, which replaced their former national currencies. Three states chose to remain outside the Eurozone and continue with their own currencies, namely Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

=== 2004–2007: EU expansion ===
In early 2004, 10 mostly former communist states joined the EU in its biggest ever expansion, enlarging the union to 25 members, with another eight making associated trade agreements. The acceding countries are bound to join the Eurozone and adopt the common currency euro in the future. The process includes the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, of which some of these countries are already part.

Most European economies are in very good shape, and the continental economy reflects this. Conflict and unrest in some of the former Yugoslavia states and in the Caucasus states are hampering economic growth in those states, however.

In response to the massive EU growth, in 2005 the Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) created a rival trade bloc to the EU, open to any previous USSR state, (including both the European and Asian states). 12 of the 15 signed up, with the three Baltic states deciding to align themselves with the EU. Despite this, the three Caucasus states have said in the past they would one day consider applying for EU membership, particularly Georgia. This is also true of Ukraine since the Orange Revolution.

=== 2008–2015: Eurozone expansion and European debt crisis ===
Slovenia became the first republic from the former Yugoslavia as well as the first formerly communist nation overall to adopt the EU currency, the euro, in 2007, followed by Malta and Cyprus in 2008, and Slovakia in 2009. In 2011, Estonia became the first republic from the former Soviet Union to adopt the euro, followed by Latvia in 2014, and Lithuania in 2015. In 2013, Croatia became the 28th member of the European Union, and adopted the euro on 1 January 2023.

In 2008, the Global Financial Crisis, triggered by the housing bubble in the United States, caused a significant decline in the GDP of the majority of the European economies, which was a precedent to a far broader and more problematic Eurozone debt crisis, which threatened the collapse of economies in the south, particularly Greece, Portugal and Spain. Having also been hit hard, Ireland exited the crisis in mid-2013. Meanwhile, increased bailouts of the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank alleviated somehow the situation in the debt-stricken nations, with Central and East European economies led by Germany escaping the worst of the 2010s debt crisis.

By the mid-2010s, 2014–2015, Ireland was recovering at a steady pace having graduated from the bail out programme successfully. The Eurozone as a whole had become more stable, however problems in Greece and slow recovery in Italy and in Iberia (Spain and Portugal) continue in keeping growth in the Euro area to a minimum. Germany continues to lead Europe in stability and growth, while both the UK and Ireland are seeing strong growth of 3–4%. Unemployment in Ireland reducing at the fastest levels in Europe, expected to reach 8% by 2016, down from double that in 2011. The Czech Republic and Germany have constantly the lowest unemployment rate in the EU. Growth outlook in general remains optimistic for Europe in the future. With positive growth expected across the Euro area. Although uncertainty still surrounds Greece and debt payments in the Greek state, at present things appear stable.

European businesses have been in decline against worldwide ones since the crisis. Of the 50 most valuable global firms, only seven were European as of 2015, compared to 17 in 2006. Out of 24 economic sectors, Europe only leads in one - food, which is led by Nestlé from Switzerland. Companies like HSBC, Vodafone, TotalEnergies and BNP Paribas have all also sled in their respective industries against American and Asian competitors. In addition, former technologic heavyweights like Nokia, Ericsson and Alcatel have also declined against evolving American companies in the Silicon Valley.

While the bottom 80% of the European population&#x27;s income has increased by an estimated 40% on average since 1980, the top 1%&#x27;s pre-tax income has more than doubled. Employment in the European Union reached a new high in 2019.

While many social and economic indicators have converged across EU regions, the global financial crisis resulted in a sharp divergence in unemployment rates. Recently, these ranged from less than 2% in Prague to more than 20% in parts of Greece, southern Spain, and southern Italy. Rapid technological change also had an effect on medium-skilled workers resulting in more low-skilled jobs being taken up.

===2016–present: Brexit, COVID pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine===

In 2016, the United Kingdom became the first nation to vote to leave the European Union since its modern iteration in the post-Cold War era, reducing the number of the said bloc&#x27;s membership down to 27 member states for the time being. U.K.&#x27;s exit prolonged the country&#x27;s ongoing economic recession beyond the COVID pandemic era in the 2020s decade. In 2022, the Russian war on Ukraine prompted both Ukraine and Moldova to be granted immediate candidate status by the European Union for economic and security reasons, with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia following suit by the end of the following year. Croatia recently became the newest member of the Eurozone after officially adopting the euro as its currency in the beginning of 2023, while Finland and Sweden became the newest members of the NATO the following year.

== Regional variation ==

European countries with a long history of trade, a free market system, and a high level of development in the previous century are generally in the north and west of the continent. They tend to be wealthier and more stable than countries congregated in the European East and South, even though the gap is converging, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, due to higher growth rates.

The poorest states are those that just emerged from communism, fascist dictatorships and civil wars, namely those of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, with some exceptions. Former Western Bloc itself presents some living standards and development differences, with the greatest contrast seen between the Nordics (Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland) and Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy.
Below is a map of European countries by gross national income per capita. High income in blue ($12,616 or more, as defined by the World Bank), upper middle income in green ($4,086 – $12,615) and lower middle income ($1,036 – $4,085) in yellow.

The predicted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on GDP is greatest in Southern Europe, where structural improvements are expected to enhance GDP levels by up to 5% by 2030, with the effect decreasing to 2.5% by 2040. The effect is projected to be a little less than 1% in Western Europe and Northern Europe, with cross-border spillover effects from the rest of Europe accounting for half of the predicted impact.

A survey conducted in 2021 found that many businesses cut back on operations as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic, resulting in a significant decline in revenue and job changes. Due to the pandemic, over 40% of the businesses surveyed had to close temporarily. Sales in the region declined by roughly 25% on average, but there was substantial variation within sub-regions.

One out of every five businesses launched or grew their online business or distribution of products and services, while one out of every four businesses started or increased their remote operations.

The pandemic has also hastened corporate transformation, with over 30% of companies altering or transforming their output as a result of it. Chemical manufacturers and wholesalers were the first to respond, with one in three expanding online business activity, beginning or boosting delivery of products and services, increasing remote employment, and changing manufacturing.

Economic activity decreased by almost 4% in the majority of sub-regions in 2020, which was similar to the global average of 3.2%. However, the variance between nations is prominent. The high infection and mortality rates of the pandemic in countries in the Western Balkans, the Eastern Neighbourhood, and Central and Eastern Europe meant they faced deeper recessions.

=== European Union ===

The European Union has the second largest economy in the world, behind that of the United States. Trade within the Union accounts for more than one-third of the world total.

The European Union or EU is a supranational union of European states, the most recent acceding member being Croatia, which became full member on 1 July 2013. It has many functions, the most important being the establishment and maintenance of a common single market, consisting of a customs union, a single currency (adopted by 18 of the member states), a Common Agricultural Policy and a Common Fisheries Policy. The European Union also undertakes various initiatives to co-ordinate activities of the member states.

The union has evolved over time from a primarily economic union to an increasingly political one. This trend is highlighted by the increasing number of policy areas that fall within EU competence: political power has tended to shift upwards from the Member States to the EU.

=== European Free Trade Association ===
The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) was established on 3 May 1960 as an alternative for European states that did not wish to join the European Union, creating a trade bloc with fewer central powers.

The EFTA member states as of 1992 were Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. In 2014 only four countries, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, remained members of EFTA, as the other members have gradually left to join the EU.

=== European Economic Area ===
The European Economic Area (EEA) came into being on 1 January 1994 following an agreement between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union (EU). It was designed to enable EFTA countries to participate in the European Single Market without having to join the EU.

In a referendum, Switzerland (ever keen on neutrality) chose not to participate in the EEA (although it is linked to the European Union by bilateral agreements similar in content to the EEA agreement), so the current members are the EU states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

A Joint Committee consisting of the non EU members plus the European Commission (representing the EU) has the function of extending relevant EU Law to the non EU members.

=== Commonwealth of Independent States ===
The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is a confederation consisting of 9 of the 15 states of the former Soviet Union, (the exceptions being the three Baltic states, Georgia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine (Turkmenistan and Ukraine are participating states in the CIS)). Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is more than a purely symbolic organization and possesses co-ordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking and security. It 2012 the Commonwealth of Independent States Free Trade Area was established.

=== Central European Free Trade Agreement ===
The Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) is a trade bloc of: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) on behalf of Kosovo.

=== Agriculture and fishing ===
Europe&#x27;s agricultural sector is in general highly developed and also has the lowest percentage of the population working in agriculture of any continent. The process of improving Central Europe&#x27;s agriculture is ongoing and is helped by the accession of Central European states to the EU. The agricultural sector in Europe is helped by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which provides farmers with a minimal price for their products and subsidizes their exports, which increases competitiveness for their products. This policy is highly controversial as it hampers free trade worldwide (protectionism sparks protectionism from other countries and trade blocs: the concept of trade wars) and is violating the concept of &quot;fair trade&quot;.

This means because of the protectionist nature of the CAP, agricultural products from developing countries are rendered uncompetitive in both Europe (an important export market for developing countries) and on their home markets (as European agricultural products are dumped on developing countries&#x27; markets with help from European agricultural subsidies). This controversy surrounds every system of agricultural subsidies (the United States&#x27; policy of subsidizing farmers is also controversial). The CAP is also controversial because 40% of the EU&#x27;s budget is spent on it, and because of the overproduction caused by it.

The Common Fisheries Policy is surrounded by an extensive system of rules (mainly consisting of quotas) to protect the environment from overfishing. Despite these rules, the cod is becoming increasingly rare in the North Sea resulting in drastic shortages in countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom. Strict fishing rules are the main reason for Norway and Iceland to stay out of the European Union (and out of the Common Fisheries Policy). Price guarantees and subsidizations of fishermen are implemented in the same way as agricultural subsidies are. Bluefin tuna is also a problem. Global stocks of the species are overfished with extinction in the wild a possibility in the near future. This also has the negative effect of threatening their traditional, natural predators.

=== Manufacturing ===
Europe has a thriving manufacturing sector, with a large part of the world&#x27;s industrial production taking place in Europe. Most of the continent&#x27;s industries are concentrated in the &#x27;Blue Banana&#x27; (covering Southern England, the Benelux, western Germany, eastern France, Switzerland, and northern Italy). However, because of the higher wage level and hence production costs, Europe is suffering from deindustrialization and offshoring in the labour-intensive manufacturing sectors. This means that manufacturing has become less important and that jobs are moved to regions with cheaper labour costs (mainly China and Central and Eastern Europe).

Central Europe (Berlin, Saxony, the Czech Republic and Little Poland) was largely industrialised by 1850 but Eastern Europe (European Russia) begun industrialisation between 1890–1900 and intensified it during the communist regime (as the USSR), but it suffered from contraction in the 1990s when the inefficient heavy-industry-based manufacturing sector was crippled after the collapse of communism and the introduction of the market economy.

In the 21st century the manufacturing sector in Central and Eastern Europe picked up because of the accession of ten formerly Communist European states to the EU and their resulting accession to the European Common Market. This caused firms within the European Union to move jobs from their manufacturing sector to Central European countries such as Poland (see above), which sparked both Central and Eastern European industrial growth and employment.

According to Fortune Global 500, 195 of the top 500 companies are headquartered in Europe. The main products in European industry are automobiles, bicycles, rail, machinery, marine, aerospace equipment, food, chemical and pharmaceutical goods, software and electronics.

=== Investing and banking ===
Europe has a well-developed financial sector. Many European cities are financial centres with London being the largest. The financial sector of the Eurozone is helped by the introduction of the euro as common currency. This has made it easier for European households and firms to invest in companies and deposit money in banks in other European countries. Exchange rate fluctuations are now non-existent in the Eurozone. The financial sector in Central and Eastern Europe is helped by economic growth in the region, European Regional Development Fund and the commitment of Central and Eastern European governments to achieve high standards.

According to the Global Financial Centres Index, , four European cities rank among the 20 largest financial centres in the world: London (2nd), Zurich (14th), Frankfurt (15th), and Paris (17th).

European banks are amongst the largest and most profitable in the world, such as HSBC, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Grupo Santander, Société Générale, Barclays, Groupe BPCE, Deutsche Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Lloyds Banking Group, ING Group, Crédit Mutuel, UBS and UniCredit.

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the economy, aggregate investment levels fell in the second quarter of 2020. The corporate sector was the most responsible for this reduction. Investment appeared to be increasing in early 2021, coinciding with the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions.

30% of EU firms reported in the European Investment Bank&#x27;s Investment Survey 2021 that they adjusted their investment expectations to fit the COVID-19 pandemic. This is reported as more than the US where the positive revision of investment plans was more common, with 25% of firms reporting. 72% of EU enterprises state that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a long-term influence on investment requirements and priorities.

Businesses in Europe received governmental support following the economic crisis. Governments ensured that enterprises had access to financing, with some governments covering labour expenses so that people could remain employed. This initiative targeted enterprises experiencing the greatest revenue loss, and the companies who got assistance were more likely to stick to their investment goals.

Mid-2021, the European Union&#x27;s gross saving rate was still 18% of gross disposable income, higher above the average of 11-13%, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

63% of large firms, 61% of infrastructure firms and 58% of firms in the service sector are the largest share expecting long term effects of COVID-19.

Across the European Union, the most commonly mentioned investment barrier is the lack of trained labor. 75% of businesses in transitional regions found this to be problematic. In less developed and non-cohesion regions, it is 79%. Demographics and rising demand for skills that are less common on the market, such as those needed to support digitalization activities, might contribute to the lack of competent workers.

Companies that are located in the countries under the European cohesion policy are less likely to spend money on the types of intangible assets, like R&amp;D or training. Businesses in cohesion regions tend to concentrate their investments more on purchasing real estate, machinery, and other tangible assets. Only 28% of investments are made in intangible activity in areas considered less developed, compared to 35% in transition areas and 39% in more developed areas.

In all regions, bank loans are the most prevalent type of external financing. In less developed regions, they account for 49% of finance, in more developed regions, 58%, and in transitional regions, 69%. Grants make up a larger portion of the financing in less developed areas.

Intangible assets (R&amp;D, software, training, and business processes) were invested in by firms in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe countries at a lower rate (24%) in 2022 than the EU average (37%). The proportion of enterprises aiming to prioritize innovation in new goods and services was higher in these regions (27%) than in the EU (24%) and the US (21%). Manufacturing enterprises (36%) and big firms (31%), in particular, have innovation as an investment priority. Among CESEE enterprises, Slovenia (38%) and the Czech Republic (37%), are the most likely to prioritize innovation. Over half of businesses (57%) altered their operations in response to COVID-19. The majority (44%), produced new items (26%), while a minority (16%) reduced their supply chain. 39% of EU enterprises created or introduced new goods, processes, or services in the previous fiscal year, compared to 57% of US firms. In both the EU and the US, little more than 12% of enterprises introduced ideas that were novel to the country or the global market.

Europe&#x27;s level of productive investment has lagged behind that of the United States - by two percentage points of GDP annually since 2010, according to European Commission data. In comparison to 2021, there is a significant increase in the proportion of enterprises citing energy prices as a limitation to investment (87%), particularly those considering it as a substantial obstacle (63%). The transition to cleaner energy is seen as a danger to investments by 41% of energy-intensive manufacturers in Europe, thus affecting all investment plans. This is compared to 31% of enterprises in non-energy heavy industries. For future investment plans, European energy-intensive manufacturers and firms are more interested in climate investments than non-energy-intensive enterprises, with 48% now investing and 57% planning to invest.

Productive investment, as of 2023 (excluding housing), has been increasing as a percentage of GDP in Europe. There remains a gap of around 1.5 percentage points in productive investment between Europe and the United States, but this growth has helped Europe keep up with the rate of productive investment growth in the United States to a certain extent. Although Europe is not falling further behind like during the sovereign debt crisis, European firms state narrowing this gap as a priority. 

Infrastructure enterprises were somewhat more likely than other firms to invest insufficiently in 2022 according to survey data. The same was true for SMEs (21%) against large businesses (15%). Firms in Lithuania (28%) and Latvia (30%) are the most likely to believe they have invested insufficiently during the previous three years. The proportion of enterprises that believe they have overinvested was largest (but still minor) in Hungary (7%), Bulgaria (7%), and the Czech Republic (6%).

Most companies in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (59%), and the rest of the EU (57%) projected their revenues to be greater in 2022 than they were in 2019. COVID-19 has had a negative impact on 45% of the enterprises in those regions. Almost one-third of those surveyed (13% of total enterprises) did not anticipate a recovery, whereas the vast majority did. Even throughout the pandemic, 41% of enterprises observed an increase in revenue, and the majority of them predicted stronger sales in 2022.

Long-term hurdles to corporate investment continue to be energy prices, uncertainty, and a shortage of skills, with 83%, 78%, and 81% of enterprises citing these concerns as restraints, respectively. EU enterprises were more likely than US firms to cite energy prices as a key impediment. In 2022 - 2023, EU businesses were found increasingly unhappy with the cost of credit as monetary policy tightened and external finance conditions deteriorated. This dissatisfaction is at more than 14% in 2023, compared to 5% in 2022.

In 2023, Austrian enterprises are the most likely to grow stock and inventory, while Romanian firms are the most likely to invest in digital inventory and input tracking. Romania has the largest proportion of importers lowering the proportion of goods/services imported from abroad, as well as the highest proportion of enterprises diversifying or growing the number of countries from which they import. Also in the same year, 80% of EU firms were profitable, which was 2 percentage points higher than the historical average. Firms that achieved profits of at least 10% of their turnover were 8% more likely to increase their investment compared to firms that only broke even. Policy support and financial reserves have played a crucial role in protecting and maintaining corporate investment. Despite the energy crisis that started in 2022, firms were able to meet their investment expectations, thanks to the support and buffers in place.

Credit demand in the Central, Eastern and Southern European regions remained strong in the first six months of 2023, although it has been steadily declining since 2021-22. Fixed investments and retail components, particularly the housing sector, contributed adversely, while credit demand was once again driven by corporate liquidity requirements (particularly for inventories and working capital). In the previous six months, most parent banks in Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern Europe nations have maintained their level of exposure. Major players in Serbia and Romania engaged in some mergers and acquisitions activities. Banks foresee an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs), which would hit the retail and business sectors in virtually all countries (excluding Albania).

According to data from a European survey, big mid-caps account for the greatest percentage of high-growth and very high-growth enterprises, at 7.5% and 3.1%, respectively, followed by SMEs at 6% and 2%. XLs and tiny mid-caps trail somewhat, accounting for 5.2-5.5% and 1.9-2.1% of high- and very-high-growth enterprises, respectively. Manufacturing businesses with big mid-caps and XL firms have the greatest percentage of extremely high-growth firms.

Europe in particular suffers from a lack of funding for more mature scale-up operations. Financing for these operations is six to eight times higher in the United States (in dollars). Corporate investment among EU countries varies significantly due to distinct national factors. The sectoral breakdown of aggregate investment is not yet accessible for all EU members, even for early 2023. In some European nations, real corporate investment increased by 5% or more by early 2023, while in others it remained stagnant or far lower than pre-pandemic levels. In 2023, enterprises with profits of at least 10% of turnover were 8 percentage points more likely to increase investment than enterprises that broke even. A main point in 2023 has been that EU enterprises embraced modern digital technology and were able to close an 11 point deficit with the United States in their usage of those technology. 

According to recent intelligence reported by GlobalData, the global Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) market is projected to see a significant increase over the coming decade. An estimated compound annual growth rate of 4.8% is expected, primarily owing to the swift rise in Europe&#x27;s UAS market. This growth is poised to almost double the UAS market size, from $12.5 billion in 2024 to an impressive $20 billion by 2034. This growth is largely attributed to Europe&#x27;s rising prominence in the UAS market sector.

In the EU, less firms were expecting to increase investment in 2024, falling to a net balance of 7%. European businesses invest 37% of their capital in intangible assets, prioritizing them over physical assets like land, buildings, and infrastructure. Only 14% of European firms focus on these physical assets, while in the US, 24% of companies focus on the same assets. 26% of EU firms also invest in expansion.

Market potential in Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern Europe is predominantly assessed as high, particularly in Czechia and Romania, or medium, especially in Western Balkan markets. According to surveyed banks, profitability in the region exceeds that of overall group operations, notably in Hungary and Kosovo. Banks in the Western Balkans report even stronger profitability, with Albania being a notable exception.

Approximately 20% of parent banks in Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern Europe anticipate asset sales or strategic restructuring at the group level. Banking groups in the region are focusing on deleveraging by either increasing or maintaining stable loan-to-deposit ratios.

International banking groups in Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern Europe mostly maintained their regional exposure over the six months leading to October 2024. According to surveyed banks in a study conducted by the European Investment Bank, 45% aim to selectively expand operations, down from 58% earlier in the year, while 55% plan to maintain current levels. These trends reflect cautious long-term strategies amid changing economic conditions.

=== Transport ===

Transport in Europe provides for the movement needs of over 700 million people and associated freight. The political geography of Europe divides the continent into over 50 sovereign states and territories. This fragmentation, along with increased movement of people since the Industrial Revolution, has led to a high level of cooperation between European countries in developing and maintaining transport networks. Supranational and intergovernmental organisations such as the European Union (EU), Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe have led to the development of international standards and agreements that allow people and freight to cross the borders of Europe, largely with unique levels of freedom and ease.

==== Rail transport ====

Rail networks in Western and Central Europe are often well maintained and well developed, whilst Eastern, Northern and Southern Europe often have less coverage and/or infrastructure problems. Electrified railway networks operate at a plethora of different voltages AC and DC varying from 750 to 25,000 volts, and signalling systems vary from country to country, hindering cross-border traffic. EU rail subsidies amounted to €73 billion in 2005.

==== Air transport ====

Despite an extensive road and rail network, most long-distance travel within Europe is by air. A large tourism industry also attracts many visitors to Europe, most of whom arrive into one of Europe&#x27;s many large international airports. London is the second busiest airport in the world by number of international passengers, only trailing Dubai. The advent of low cost carriers in recent years has led to a large increase in air travel within Europe. Air transportation is now often the cheapest way of travelling between cities. This increase in air travel has led to problems of airspace overcrowding and environmental concerns. The Single European Sky is one initiative aimed at solving these problems.

== Global trade relations ==
The bulk of the EU&#x27;s external trade is done with China, Mercosur and the United States, Japan, Russia and non-member European states.

EU members are represented by a single official at the WTO.

The EU is involved in a few minor trade disputes. It had a long running dispute with the USA of allegedly unfair subsidies the US government gives to several companies, such as Boeing. The EU has a long running ban prohibiting arms trade with the Chinese. The EU issued a brief accusing Microsoft of predatory and monopolistic practices.

<text>A subsistence economy is an economy directed to basic subsistence (the provision of food, clothing and shelter) rather than to the market.

==Definition==
&quot;Subsistence&quot; is understood as supporting oneself and family at a minimum level. Basic subsistence is the provision of food, clothing, shelter. A subsistence economy is an economy directed to one&#x27;s subsistence rather than to the market. Often, the subsistence economy is moneyless and relies on natural resources to provide for basic needs through hunting, gathering, and agriculture. In a subsistence economy, economic surplus is minimal and only used to trade for basic goods, and there is no industrialization. In hunting and gathering societies, resources are often, if not typically underused.

The subsistence system is maintained through sharing, feasting, ritual observance and associated norms.
Harvesting is an important indicator of social capital. 
Subsistence embodies cultural perspectives of relationships to places, people and animals.

==History==
In human history, before the first cities, all humans lived in a subsistence economy. As urbanization, civilization, and division of labor spread, various societies moved to other economic systems at various times. Some remain relatively unchanged, ranging from uncontacted peoples, to marginalized areas of developing countries, to some cultures that choose to retain a traditional economy.

==List of strategies==

* Hunting and gathering techniques, also known as foraging:
** Artisan fishing — a term which particularly applies to coastal or island ethnic groups using traditional techniques for subsistence fishing.
**Aboriginal whaling, including the subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale in the Arctic.
* Agriculture:
** Subsistence agriculture — agricultural cultivation involving continuous use of arable (crop) land, and is more labor-intensive than horticulture.
**Horticulture — plant cultivation, based on the use of simple tools. 
* Pastoralism, the raising of grazing animals:
** Pastoral nomadism — all members of the pastoral society follow the herd throughout the year.
** Transhumance or agro-pastoralism — part of the society follows the herd, while the other part maintains a home village.
** Ranch agriculture — non-nomadic pastoralism with a defined territory.
* Distribution and :
** Redistribution 
** Reciprocity — exchange between social equals. 
** Potlatching — a widely studied ritual in which sponsors (helped by their entourages) gave away resources and manufactured wealth while generating prestige for themselves.
** LETS — Local Exchange Trading Systems.
*A parasitical society, subsisting on the produce of a separate host society:
** Raiding
** Conquest
** Garbage picking, when subsisting in a larger economy

<doc id="1069074" wikidata="Q7574861" url="?curid=1069074" title="Special rights">
<text>Special rights is a term originally used by conservatives and libertarians to refer to laws granting rights to one or more groups that are not extended to other groups. Ideas of special rights are controversial, as they clash with the principle of equality before the law.

Potential examples of special rights include affirmative action policies or hate crime legislation with regard to ethnic, religious or sexual minorities or state recognition of marriage as a group with different taxation from those who are not married. However, the term has often been extended to include some policies that are only seeking simple equality, such as LGBT rights, and some other civil rights movements.

Concepts of &quot;special rights&quot; are closely aligned with notions of group rights and identity politics.

==Other uses==
More recently, social conservatives have used the term to more narrowly refer to measures that extend existing rights for heterosexual couples to gays and lesbians, such as in the case of same sex marriage, or that include sexual orientation as a civil rights minority group.

The term is also used internationally. In German the term &quot;Sonderrechte&quot;
(de), with the same literal meaning, is used in senses like &#x27;privileges&#x27;, &#x27;special legislations&#x27; or &#x27;special exemptions&#x27;.

==Legal argument==
The basis behind the argument of the term is based on whether it should be considered just and legal for a law to treat various parties unequally. For example, in the US Constitution the prohibition on bills of attainder require that laws do not single out a single person or group of persons for specific treatment.

Another example is the equal protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. Both sides argue that the other side is or has traditionally been singled out and so the law is either needed or unnecessary.

In some cases, such as those with social implications, the universal definition of rights also often conflict with other, often more regional or local, laws that require certain public standards or behavior based on cultural norms.

==Libertarianism on rights and special rights==
In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism&quot;, Eric Mack states:

A too-ready acceptance of alleged rights leads to an oppressive list of enforceable obligations. As the list of others&#x27; rights grows, each of us is subject to a growing burden made up of the obligations correlative to those rights; correspondingly the ability of rights to be protective of individual choice dissolves. Moreover, as the list of rights grows, so too does the legitimate role of political and legal institutions, and the libertarian case for radically limiting the scope and power of such institutions withers away. Libertarian theories of rights avoid generating an oppressive list of obligations through the employment of two crucial distinctions – the distinction between negative and positive rights and the distinction between general and special rights.
==Definition of minorities==
Minority rights advocacy groups often contend that such protections confer no special rights, and describe these laws instead as protecting equal rights, due to past conditions or legal privileges for specific groups.

==Broadcasting==
On 6 August 2001, Fox Kids Europe announced they had acquired worldwide television distribution rights to the series, including the United States.

In Canada, Family Channel aired reruns of the series weekdays at 6:00pm until June 28, 2007, when they were replaced by &quot;Zoey 101&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the show aired on BBC One 18 September 2001 and on the &quot;Children&#x27;s Channel&quot; CBBC. Some episodes had a shorter running time than others because of the removal of the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; featurettes.

Later in the series, the show starts with the crew wandering around the set with the camera following them. They talk about today&#x27;s events, such as the birthday of an actor on the set. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen usually appear in this segment.

In Italy, the series aired on Italia 1 under the name &quot;Due gemelle e un maggiordomo&quot; (&quot;Two Twins and a butler&quot;) from August until September 2002.

A short &quot;behind the scenes&quot; featurette was sometimes included at the end of an episode as well. Although retained on the Warner Home Video VHS and DVD releases, these were always edited out of the U.K. terrestrial transmissions.

The series briefly reran on Nickelodeon in 2015 after the network acquired the rights to Olsen twins&#x27; Dualstar video library.

==Episodes==
==Home media==
From 2002 to 2003, Warner Bros. and DualStar released 4 separate volumes of the show on DVD and VHS. Each volume contained 6 episodes each for a total of 24 episodes. In 2005, those 4 volumes were packaged together as one box set containing a fifth DVD with the only two episodes that had not yet been released to DVD (&quot;Outbreak&quot; and &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot;). This box set was titled &quot;So Little Time: 5 DVD Gift Set&quot;. The episodes on the gift set are not presented in air date or production order, because it is simply a repackaging of the individual DVD releases and each release had its own theme.

Although the gift set and individual releases for volumes 1–4 have since gone out of print, volumes 1–4 were re-released in 2017 as two 2-disc &quot;double feature&quot; sets, the first containing volumes 1 and 2 and the second containing volumes 3 and 4. The bonus disc containing &quot;Outbreak&quot; and &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; has not been re-released and those two episodes remain only available as part of the &quot;5 DVD Gift Set&quot; package.

The series also featured new original stories based on the show, which were written by the same authors.

<text>Rufus is an American funk band from Chicago best known for launching the career of lead singer Chaka Khan. They had several hits during their career, including &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot;, &quot;Sweet Thing&quot;, &quot;Do You Love What You Feel&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&quot;. Rufus and Chaka Khan were one of the most popular and influential funk bands of the 1970s; they had four consecutive number-one R&amp;B albums, ten top 40 pop hits, and five number-one R&amp;B singles among other accolades.

==Biography==

===Origins===
In 1968, the American Breed (Gary Loizzo, guitar/vocals; Al Ciner, guitar; Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Colbert, bass; and Lee Graziano, drums) had a top ten hit with the classic-rock single &quot;Bend Me, Shape Me&quot;. After their success, Colbert and Graziano (without Loizzo, who pursued a successful production career) created a new group adding later-day American Breed members Kevin Murphy (keyboards) and Paulette McWilliams (vocals) as well as James Stella (vocals), and Vern Pilder (guitar) from the bar band Circus. They re-emerged in 1969 with the name Smoke. In 1970, after switching their management to Bob Monaco and Bill Traut, the group&#x27;s name was changed again to Ask Rufus, taken from the title of the advice column in &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot;. At that point, Ciner came back replacing Pilder and Willie Weeks was added on bass after Colbert left. In 1971, the band signed a contract with Epic Records and recorded an album which was not released; then Epic dropped their contract in early 1972. Weeks was replaced by Dennis Belfield, James Stella by keyboardist/vocalist Ron Stockert, and Lee Graziano by Andre Fischer.

Paulette McWilliams and Chaka Khan had met and they became the best of friends through their spouses Howard Towles and Hassan Khan. Khan attended most Ask Rufus gigs when they performed in Chicago. When McWilliams decided that she was leaving Ask Rufus, she told them she had the perfect singer to replace her; she also asked Khan if she was interested. After the band hesitantly agreed, McWilliams remained for a few weeks to teach Khan the material. McWilliams got Khan a gig with the group Lyfe, formed by Chicago&#x27;s Cash McCall. Khan had been performing at the Pumpkin Room on the south side of Chicago, with a local group, Lock and Chain which was led by drummer Scotty Harris.

===Early career===
Bob Monaco was part of a booking company known as Ashley Famous with Jim Golden. They booked Ask Rufus, with Paulette McWilliams and also the Rotary Connection with Minnie Riperton. Monaco was responsible for helping get Ask Rufus their deal on ABC Dunhill. Monaco returned to Los Angeles, convinced the label to give him a demo budget and then quickly returned to Chicago where the group recorded eleven songs in two days at Marty Feldman&#x27;s Paragon Studios. After they took the demo tapes to ABC Dunhill in 1973, the group was immediately asked to sign a long-term recording contract.

A few weeks before Monaco saw Rufus perform, the group had already caught the attention of musician Ike Turner who flew them to Los Angeles to record at his studio Bolic Sound in Inglewood, California. Turner wanted Khan to become an Ikette; she declined saying that she was &quot;really happy with Rufus. But Ike&#x27;s attention was certainly a boost.&quot; The group returned to Los Angeles shortly after that to record &quot;Rufus&quot; at Quantum Recording Studios in Torrance, California; it was released in 1973. Although the songs &quot;Whoever&#x27;s Thrilling You (Is Killing Me)&quot; and &quot;Feel Good&quot; (both featuring Khan) brought the group some attention from R&amp;B radio stations, the album itself had minimal sales and the Stockert-led &quot;Slip &amp; Slide&quot; failed to catch major attention from pop radio. The group quickly re-entered the same studio to record their follow-up album &quot;Rags to Rufus&quot;. 

Ciner and Belfield left the group shortly thereafter along with Stockert who was replaced by keyboardist Nate Morgan, based in Los Angeles. Additionally, Tony Maiden and bassist Bobby Watson, who was also from Los Angeles, were recruited by drummer Andre Fischer. The trio&#x27;s addition to Rufus added a unique sound to the group, bringing a stronger funk and jazz influence to complement Khan&#x27;s now emerging powerful lead vocals.

===Success, stardom and tension===
&quot;Rags to Rufus&quot; was released in 1974 and two of its singles—the Stevie Wonder-penned &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot; and the Parker-Khan composition, &quot;You Got the Love&quot;—became smash hits and &quot;Rags to Rufus&quot; went Platinum. They landed opening spots for the tours of several top stars, including Stevie Wonder, Cheech and Chong, and the Hues Corporation. &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot; also gave Rufus their first Grammy Award. In addition it sold over one million copies and was awarded a Gold disc by the RIAA on August 9, 1974. 

Due to Khan&#x27;s increasing popularity Rufus and ABC began calling the group Rufus featuring Chaka Khan. With the new billing, the band recorded and released their next album without delay, &quot;Rufusized&quot; in 1974. Another Platinum success, the group again entered the top ten with the funk singles, &quot;Once You Get Started&quot; (penned by Gavin Christopher), &quot;Stop on By&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Woman&quot;, &quot;Pack&#x27;d My Bags&quot; (later sampled for Jody Watley&#x27;s &quot;Lovin&#x27; You So&quot;), and &quot;Please Pardon Me (You Remind Me of a Friend)&quot;, penned by their friend Brenda Russell.
The group headlined their first major tour in 1975, with Khan attracting attention in concert reviews for her powerhouse vocals and sexy attire—so much so that Khan was often featured on magazine covers like &quot;Jet&quot;. Due to her off-stage antics which added to her on-stage persona, the media billed Khan as &quot;the wild child&quot;. She was often compared to Tina Turner and some rock and soul press labeled her a &quot;pint-sized Tina&quot;. Attention to Khan began to make waves for some of the group&#x27;s members, as they felt her presence overshadowed the band itself. 

The group&#x27;s fourth release, and the third major release with Khan as singer, &quot;Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan&quot;, was released in 1975. The major hit on the album was a composition by Khan and Tony Maiden titled &quot;Sweet Thing&quot;; it reached the top five of the charts and became their fourth record to go Gold. Despite the album&#x27;s success as well as a second successful major tour which followed, tensions grew within the group, particularly between Khan and longtime Rufus drummer Andre Fischer. 

Khan married Richard Holland during recording sessions of &quot;Ask Rufus.&quot; She had divorced her first husband Hassan Khan in 1974 prior to the birth of their child Milini. Holland&#x27;s presence only made things worse between Khan and Fischer. During one session of &quot;Ask Rufus&quot;, Fischer got into a fight with Holland, who received help from Khan who counter-attacked. &quot;Ask Rufus&quot; was released in 1977 and includes the hits &quot;At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up)&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, and &quot;Everlasting Love&quot;. After a tour promoting &quot;Ask Rufus&quot;, Fischer finally left the group. He was followed by Nate Morgan. They were replaced by Richard &quot;Moon&quot; Calhoun and David &quot;Hawk&quot; Wolinski, respectively. 

The new line-up recorded the album &quot;Street Player&quot;, featuring the Khan-composed song &quot;Stay&quot;. After first putting it off as a rumor, Khan confirmed to media reports that she was going solo and signing a deal with Warner Bros. Records. The decision strained relations between Khan and the other Rufus members. Khan released her self-titled debut later in 1978. The album sold more than &quot;Street Player&quot;, going Platinum, thanks to the international Ashford &amp; Simpson-composed single &quot;I&#x27;m Every Woman&quot;. She continued to promote the album in 1979. In April 1978, Calhoun was replaced by John &quot;JR&quot; Robinson as the group&#x27;s drummer.

===Decline and final years===

After Calhoun&#x27;s replacement, ABC Records was absorbed by MCA, bringing the group to MCA. While Khan promoted &quot;Chaka&quot;, Rufus put out a less favorably received album without Khan, &quot;Numbers&quot;. Khan returned to record with the band for &quot;Masterjam&quot; which was produced by Quincy Jones. By now, Rufus and Khan were two separate acts. Khan&#x27;s stardom helped &quot;Masterjam&quot; go Gold thanks to the funk-laden disco recording, &quot;Do You Love What You Feel&quot;. Though Khan said later that she was ready to leave Rufus at the time she released &quot;Chaka&quot; in 1978, she discovered that she had two more albums left in her ABC/MCA contract with the band and agreed to fulfill her obligations. After &quot;Masterjam&quot;, one of the contractual albums, and another album without Khan, &quot;Party &#x27;Til You&#x27;re Broke&quot;, which did not sell well, Rufus and Khan reunited for their last MCA album, &quot;Camouflage&quot;, in 1981. Tension was felt during the album sessions. Khan avoided the band, recording her vocals alone to a click track.

The album failed to garner attention, mainly due to Khan&#x27;s solo obligations, which now included two more Gold-certified studio albums, &quot;Naughty&quot; and &quot;What Cha&#x27; Gonna Do for Me&quot;. With the release of &quot;Camouflage&quot;, Khan was free to leave the group and after her exit in early 1982, the remaining members of Rufus released what became their final studio album, &quot;Seal in Red&quot; in 1983. Like their previous albums, it went unnoticed. Rufus band members agreed to split after one last live album. The band asked Khan to contribute to their final concert performance, which was filmed by Warner Bros. She obliged, reuniting with the group for what was later released as a documentary film, &quot;Stompin&#x27; At the Savoy&quot;. Warner Bros. declined to release the film at that time and released only the live album. The filmed concert has since been released to home video. 

The album included four Khan-led studio songs, including the Dave Wolinski composition &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&quot;, which got attention when a producer for the film &quot;Breakin&#x27;&quot; heard it while screening songs for the movie&#x27;s soundtrack. WB eventually released the song (with the billing Rufus and Chaka Khan) and the song became a top 30 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit, reaching number one on the R&amp;B chart and was number eight on the UK Singles Chart. The success of the track led to the band receiving its second Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

After that Rufus went their separate ways. Khan soon released the album and smash single &quot;I Feel for You&quot;, cementing her solo career, which continued successfully for decades.

===Post-break-up===
In 2001, Rufus (Kevin Murphy, Tony Maiden, Bobby Watson, Dave Wolinski, John &quot;JR&quot; Robinson) and Khan reunited for a brief tour, which Khan described in her 2003 autobiography, &quot;Chaka! Through the Fire&quot; (co-written with Tonya Bolden). Khan and Maiden reunited on the modernized Rufus medley &quot;Pack&#x27;d My Bags&quot;/ &quot;You Got the Love&quot;, on Khan&#x27;s double Grammy Award-winning 2007 album, &quot;Funk This&quot;. While discussing a second potential reunion with Rufus during a 2008 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Khan said that the band&#x27;s classic lineup, which includes Andre Fischer and Nate Morgan, had no plans on reuniting with Khan saying that touring with Maiden, one of the few Rufus bandmates with which Khan kept a close friendship was the closest to another Rufus reunion. 

A lineup of Rufus including Bobby Watson and JR began a short tour in 2008. Neither founding member Kevin Murphy, mainstay Tony Maiden, nor Dave Wolinski participated in the tour. In September 2011, the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame committee announced that the band and Khan were jointly nominated for induction to the 27th annual class. They had been eligible since 1999 (with the committee counting the band&#x27;s first album as being &quot;Rags to Rufus&quot; rather than 1973&#x27;s &quot;Rufus&quot;). It was their first year of nomination. Earlier in the year, Khan received a solo star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Rufus was nominated again for the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in September 2017.

<text>A breeches role (also pants role or trouser role, or Hosenrolle) is one in which an actress appears in male clothing. Breeches, tight-fitting knee-length pants, were the standard male garment at the time these roles were introduced. The theatrical term &quot;travesti&quot; covers both this sort of cross-dressing and also that of male actors dressing as female characters. Both are part of the long history of cross-dressing in music and opera and later in film and television.

In opera, a breeches role refers to any male character that is sung and acted by a female singer. Most often the character is an adolescent or a very young man, sung by a mezzo-soprano or contralto. The operatic concept assumes that the character is male, and the audience accepts him as such, even knowing that the actor is not. Cross-dressing female characters (e.g., Leonore in &quot;Fidelio&quot; or Gilda in Act III of &quot;Rigoletto&quot;) are not considered breeches roles. The most frequently performed breeches roles are Cherubino (&quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;), Octavian (&quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;), Hansel (&quot;Hansel und Gretel&quot;) and Orpheus (&quot;Orpheus and Euridice&quot;), though the latter was originally written for a male singer, first a castrato and later, in the revised French version, an haute-contre.

Because non-musical stage plays generally have no requirements for vocal range, they do not usually contain breeches roles in the same sense as opera. Some plays do have male roles that were written for adult female actors, and (for other practical reasons) are usually played by women (e.g., &quot;Peter Pan&quot;); these could be considered modern-era breeches roles. However, in most cases, the choice of a female actor to play a male character is made at the production level; Hamlet is not a breeches role, but Sarah Bernhardt once played Hamlet as a breeches role. When a play is spoken of as &quot;containing&quot; a breeches role, this &quot;does&quot; mean a role where a female character pretends to be a man and uses male clothing as a disguise.

== History ==

When the London theatres re-opened in 1660, the first professional actresses appeared on the public stage, replacing the boys in dresses of the Shakespeare era. To see real women speak the risqué dialogue of Restoration comedy and show off their bodies on stage was a great novelty, and soon the even greater sensation was introduced of women wearing male clothes on stage. Out of some 375 plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700, it has been calculated that 89, nearly a quarter, contained one or more roles for actresses in male clothes (see Howe). Practically every Restoration actress appeared in trousers at some time, and breeches roles would even be inserted gratuitously in revivals of older plays.

Some critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, have argued that these cross-dressing roles subvert conventional gender roles by allowing women to imitate the roistering and sexually aggressive behaviour of male Restoration rakes, but Elizabeth Howe has objected in a detailed study that the male disguise was &quot;little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object&quot;. The epilogue to Thomas Southerne&#x27;s &quot;Sir Anthony Love&quot; (1690) suggests that it does not much matter if the play is dull, as long as the audience can glimpse the legs of the famous &quot;breeches&quot; actress Susanna Mountfort (also known as Susanna Verbruggen):

:You&#x27;ll hear with Patience a dull Scene, to see,
:In a contented lazy waggery,
:The Female Mountford bare above the knee.

Katharine Eisaman Maus also argues that as well as revealing the female legs and buttocks, the breeches role frequently contained a revelation scene where the character not only unpins her hair but as often reveals a breast as well. This is evidenced in the portraits of many of these actresses of the Restoration.

Breeches roles remained an attraction on the British stage for centuries, but their fascination gradually declined as the difference in real-life male and female clothing became less extreme. They played a part in Victorian burlesque and are traditional for the principal boy in pantomime.

== Opera ==
Historically, the list of roles that are considered to be breeches roles is constantly changing, depending on the tastes of the opera-going public. In early Italian opera, many leading operatic roles were assigned to a castrato, a male castrated before puberty with a very strong and high voice. As the practice of castrating boy singers faded, composers created heroic male roles in the mezzo-soprano range, where singers such as Marietta Alboni and Rosamunda Pisaroni specialised in such roles. (See &quot;Xerxes&quot; below.)

Currently, all castrato roles are being reclaimed by men. As the training and use of countertenors becomes more common, there are more men with these very high voices to sing these roles.

Casting directors are left with choices such as whether to cast the young Prince Orlofsky in Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; for a woman or man; both commonly sing the role. When played by a mezzo, the prince looks like a woman, but sounds like a boy. When played by a counter-tenor, he looks like a man, but sings like a woman. This disparity is made even clearer if, as in this case, there is also spoken dialogue.

The term &quot;travesty&quot; (from the Italian &quot;travesti&quot;, disguised) applies to any roles sung by the opposite sex.

A closely related term is a &quot;skirt role&quot;, a female character to be played by a male singer, usually for comic or visual effect. These roles are often ugly stepsisters or very old women, and are not as common as trouser roles. As women were not allowed to sing on stage in the Papal States until the end of the 18th century, although not elsewhere in Europe, many female operatic roles which premiered in those areas were originally written as skirt roles for castrati (e.g. Mandane and Semira in Leonardo Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Artaserse&quot;). The Madwoman in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Curlew River&quot; and the Cook in Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; are later examples. The role of the witch in Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot;, although written for a mezzo-soprano, is now more regularly sung by a tenor, who sings the part an octave lower. In the same opera the &quot;male&quot; roles of Hänsel, the Sandman, and the Dewman are however meant to be sung by women.

<doc id="1069091" wikidata="Q5421511" url="?curid=1069091" title="Exponent bias">
<text>In IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, the exponent is biased in the engineering sense of the word – the value stored is offset from the actual value by the exponent bias, also called a biased exponent.
Biasing is done because exponents have to be signed values in order to be able to represent both tiny and huge values, but two&#x27;s complement, the usual representation for signed values, would make comparison harder.

To solve this problem the exponent is stored as an unsigned value which is suitable for comparison, and when being interpreted it is converted into an exponent within a signed range by subtracting the bias.

By arranging the fields such that the sign bit takes the most significant bit position, the biased exponent takes the middle position, then the significand will be the least significant bits and the resulting value will be ordered properly. This is the case whether or not it is interpreted as a floating-point or integer value. The purpose of this is to enable high speed comparisons between floating-point numbers using fixed-point hardware.

If there are formula_1 bits in the exponent, the bias
is typically set as formula_2.

Therefore, the possible integer values that the biased exponent can express lie in the range formula_3.
To understand this range, with formula_1 bits in the exponent, the possible unsigned integers lie in the range formula_5.
However, the strings containing all zeros and all ones are reserved for special values, so the expressible integers lie in the range formula_6.
It follows that:

* The maximum biased value is formula_7.
* The minimum biased value is formula_8.

When interpreting the floating-point number, the bias is subtracted to retrieve the actual exponent.

* For a half-precision number, the exponent is stored in the range 1 .. 30 (0 and 31 have special meanings), and is interpreted by subtracting the bias for an 5-bit exponent (15) to get an exponent value in the range −14 .. +15.
* For a single-precision number, the exponent is stored in the range 1 .. 254 (0 and 255 have special meanings), and is interpreted by subtracting the bias for an 8-bit exponent (127) to get an exponent value in the range −126 .. +127.
* For a double-precision number, the exponent is stored in the range 1 .. 2046 (0 and 2047 have special meanings), and is interpreted by subtracting the bias for an 11-bit exponent (1023) to get an exponent value in the range −1022 .. +1023.
* For a quad-precision number, the exponent is stored in the range 1 .. 32766 (0 and 32767 have special meanings), and is interpreted by subtracting the bias for a 15-bit exponent (16383) to get an exponent value in the range −16382 .. +16383.

== History ==
The floating-point format of the IBM 704 introduced the use of a biased exponent in 1954.

<text>Michael Fayat Keenan (born 19 March 1972) is an Australian former politician who was a member of the House of Representatives representing the Division of Stirling for the Liberal Party from the 2004 federal election until his retirement in 2019. He was the Minister for Human Services and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Transformation in the Morrison government from 2017 until his retirement. He previously served as Minister for Justice from 2013 to 2017.

==Early life==
Keenan was born in Perth. His father Peter was born in County Durham, England. During the parliamentary eligibility crisis of 2017, it came to public attention that Keenan had acquired British citizenship by descent at birth, which he renounced before the 2004 election. Some media outlets had incorrectly reported that he had never renounced his citizenship; in response, he wrote &quot;I am an Australian citizen and I do not hold citizenship of any other country. Fairfax is aware of this, yet in a cheap grab for a headline they have ignored this&quot;.

== Education ==
Keenan went to school at Trinity College, Perth. He later attended Murdoch University, the Australian National University, and Cambridge University, where he obtained a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy. He was a property consultant with a real estate firm before entering politics. He had previously worked as an adviser to Senator Amanda Vanstone and was deputy director of the Liberal Party of Western Australia.

==Politics==
Keenan was elected to parliament at the 2004 federal election, defeating the incumbent Labor member Jann McFarlane. He was promoted to the shadow ministry after the 2007 election, serving as Shadow Assistant Treasurer (2007–2008), Shadow Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (2008–2009), and finally Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection (2009–13). He was identified by the media as a supporter of Malcolm Turnbull in the 2009 leadership spill.

===Government minister===
Following the 2013 federal election, Keenan was appointed Minister for Justice in the Abbott government. He was also made Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Counter-Terrorism in May 2015. In the 2015 leadership spill, Keenan was again identified as one of Turnbull&#x27;s supporters. He retained both his positions in the new ministry.

During the 2016 federal election campaign, Keenan was accused of starting a smear campaign against the Muslim Labor candidate Anne Aly, in reference to her previous counter-terrorism work. Keenan appeared with Liberal MP Luke Simpkins, the incumbent in Cowan whose seat was challenged by Aly, to make accusations against her. However, prior to Aly becoming a Labor candidate, Simpkins had written to her in admiration of her counter-terrorism work.

As justice minister, Keenan oversaw the first national firearms amnesty since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. It ran from July to September 2017, allowing people to hand in unregistered or unwanted firearms. The amnesty had been approved in March 2017 by the Firearms and Weapons Policy Working Group to reduce the number of unregistered firearms in Australia that were being used in Islamic terrorist attacks.

In a ministerial reshuffle in December 2017, Keenan was promoted to cabinet as Minister for Human Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Transformation.
On 25 January 2019 he announced that he would not contest the 2019 election, to spend more time with his family after 15 years in parliament. He and his wife have four sons, all born while he was a member of parliament.

On Wednesday 13 February 2019, one of Keenan&#x27;s office staffers was implicated in conspiring with Michaelia Cash&#x27;s office staff in making strategic media leaks about AFP raids on the offices of the AWU.

<doc id="1069099" wikidata="Q6742753" url="?curid=1069099" title="Malcontent">
<text>The malcontent is a character type that often appeared in early modern drama. The character, usually an unhappy outsider, but always dissatisfied, observes and comments on the action, and is sometimes metafictionally aware that they are in a play. 
==Role==
The character is discontented with the social structure and other characters in the play, and is often an outsider who observes and comments on the action, and may even acknowledge they are in a play. Shakespeare&#x27;s Richard III, Iago in &quot;Othello&quot;, and Jaques in &quot;As You Like It&quot; are typical malcontents.

The role is usually both political and dramatic, with the malcontent voicing dissatisfaction with the usually Machiavellian political atmosphere and often using asides to build up a kind of self-consciousness and awareness of the text itself that other characters in the play lack.
==Examples==
Important malcontents include Bosola in Webster&#x27;s &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, Vindice in Middleton&#x27;s &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, Malevole in Marston&#x27;s &quot;The Malcontent&quot;, and Hamlet in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.
==Morality and sympathy==
The morality and sympathy of the malcontent is highly variable, as in the examples above. Sometimes, as in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;The Malcontent&quot;, they are the sympathetic centre of the play, whereas Iago is a very unsympathetic character. The most important thing about the malcontent is that the character is malcontent—unhappy, unsettled, displeased with the world of the play, eager to change it somehow, or to dispute with it.
==Objectivity==
The malcontent is an objective or quasi-objective voice that comments on the play&#x27;s concerns as though somehow above or beyond them. The concept has much to do with the Renaissance idea of humorism and a surfeit of &quot;black bile&quot; which caused melancholy.

There is an ontological argument regarding Iago: if a malcontent is dissatisfied due to a displacement from their place in the social order, then Iago does not fit. His scheming and disaffection is not clearly motivated by resentment stemming from an injustice done to him.

<doc id="1069107" wikidata="Q864271" url="?curid=1069107" title="Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary">
<text>The Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary (), abbreviated VSM and also known as the Visitandines, is a Catholic religious order of Pontifical Right for women. Members of the order are also known as the Salesian Sisters (not to be confused with the Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco) or, more commonly as the Visitation Sisters.

== History ==

The Order of the Visitation was founded in 1610 by Francis de Sales and Jane Frances de Chantal in Annecy, Haute-Savoie, France. At first, the founder had not a religious order in mind; he wished to form a congregation without external vows, where the cloister should be observed only during the year of novitiate, after which the sisters should be free to go out by turns to visit the sick and poor. The Order was given the name of The Visitation of Holy Mary with the intention that the sisters would follow the example of Virgin Mary and her joyful visit to her kinswoman Elizabeth, an event celebrated in Christianity as &quot;The Visitation&quot;.
De Sales invited Jane de Chantal to join him in establishing a new type of religious life, one open to older women and those of delicate constitution, that would stress the hidden, inner virtues of humility, obedience, poverty, even-tempered charity, and patience, and founded on the example of Mary in her journey of mercy to her cousin Elizabeth. The order was established to welcome those not able to practice austerities required in other orders. Instead of chanting the canonical office in the middle of the night, the sisters recited the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary at half-past eight in the evening. There was no perpetual abstinence nor prolonged fasting. The Order of the Visitation of Mary was canonically erected in 1618 by Paul V who granted it all the privileges enjoyed by the other orders. A bull of Urban VIII solemnly approved it in 1626.

==Charism==
The special charism of the Visitation Order is an interior discipline expressed primarily through the practice of two virtues: humility and gentleness. The motto of the order is &quot;Live Jesus&quot;.

==Expansion==
A foundation was established in Lyons in 1615 followed by Moulines (1616), Grenoble (1618), Bourges (1618), and Paris (1619). When Francis de Sales died (1622) there were 13 convents established; at the death of Jane Frances de Chantal in 1641 there were 86.
The order spread from France throughout Europe and to North America. , there are about 150 autonomous Visitation monasteries throughout the world.

===Portugal===
The Order of the Visitation has been present in Portugal since 1784, maintaining today three monasteries: in Braga, in Vila das Aves and in Batalha. The Sisters of the Visitation in Portugal produce and distribute the emblems of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (like devotional scapulars) as Margaret Mary Alacoque did in the past.

===England===
At the French Revolution in 1789 when all the religious houses were suppressed many of the French Sisters took refuge in other Catholic countries. The sisters in Rouen, northern France, fled to Portuguese monasteries, having only escaped the guillotine by the death of Robespierre in 1794. In 1803 six sisters left Lisbon in an English packet ship and while at sea they were attacked by French pirates. They were spared because of their nationality (they were French not English) and were returned safely to the Spanish seaport of Vigo. After a brief sojourn in Spain three of the Sisters made a second attempt to cross from Porto and without further encounters with pirates arrived in Falmouth on 29 January 1804. They later journeyed to Acton and founded the first monastery of the Visitation on English soil on 19 March 1804. They subsequently re-located to Waldron.

===Germany===
In 1835, the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary of Dietramszell acquired Beuerberg Abbey (Kloster Beuerberg), in Eurasburg, Germany. Between 1846 and 1938 they ran a girls&#x27; school and a home for nursing mothers at Beuerberg Abbey, and afterwards an old people&#x27;s convalescent home. The abbey still belongs to the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary.

===Colombia===
The nine Visitation Sisters from Madrid, Spain came to Colombia in 1892 and founded the first Monastery at Santa Fe, Bogotá.

===Ireland===
The Visitation Sisters came to Ireland in 1955 and founded a Monastery at Stamullen, Co. Meath. When Mother Mary Teresa O’ Dwyer, Superior of the Visitation Monastery of Roseland, England learned that the Brothers of St. John of God were moving out of Silverstream, she applied to the Bishop of Meath for permission for the Order of the Visitation to enter his diocese. Staffing problems were solved by borrowing three Sisters from America. The Visitation Monasteries of St. Paul Minnesota, Brooklyn New York and Atlanta Georgia each lent a Sister.

===Korea===
In 2005, six Visitation Sisters from Manizales, Colombia, came to South Korea. The Monastery of the Visitation was established in Jeongok-eup, Yeoncheon County, in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea.

=== Poland ===

The Visitation Sisters (Polish: &quot;Zakon Nawiedzenia Najświętszej Marii Panny&quot;, or, &quot;siostry wizytki&quot;) were first invited to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Polish queen-consort Marie Louise Gonzaga, who was heavily involved as a patron and supporter of the Catholic church. Her wish came to pass with the arrival of 12 nuns to Warsaw. The Warsaw Visitandines&#x27; numbers would quickly increase and the convent funded two more, in Kraków and Vilnius, before 1700. Following the partitions, the order was robbed multiple times by foreign armies and it suffered under sanctions imposed by the occupying powers. Currently there are four Visitationist convents in Poland.

==== Warsaw ====
The first convent was built on Krakowskie Przedmieście, near a royal residence. The nuns were officially enclosed the same year, 1654, however soon after, they would have to leave their cloister twice due to threats from hostile armies &quot;-&quot; this would happen again some centuries later, when the sisters were driven out to house Napoleonic soldiers. Since their founding, &quot;Wizytki&quot;, as they are called, managed schools and pensions for girls, taking care of the urban poor. The sisters were forbidden from teaching after the fall of the January Uprising (1864), as one of the many efforts by the Tsar to erase any Polish national influence in education - along with the pension, the novitiate was closed, meaning no new sisters could be taken in. Wizytki only resumed training novices in 1905. The oldest of the Visitationist convents was also involved in the Warsaw Uprising, when the sisters voluntarily opened their cloister to guests and sheltered the vulnerable civilian population. As stewards of one of the most prominent historical landmarks in Warsaw, the sisters were also involved in art conservation. Under communist rule, the same convent was a space of contact and exchange with clergy in countries such as Hungary or Czechoslovakia.

==== Kraków ====
The convent in Kraków attributes its conception to a miracle performed by Francis of Sales, who answered the prayer of bishop and founder Jan Małachowski when the latter was drowning in the frozen Vistula river. Five nuns from the Warsaw convent moved to Kraków the very same winter, but the enclosed convent proper would only be established in the summer of 1682, the following year. In Kraków too, the sisters were heavily involved with girls&#x27; education, which was the only reason the convent was not forced to disband under Austrian occupation. Thanks to its good reputation, it even received foreign students. During and after the first world war, the convent came to rely on goodwill for income.

==== Jasło ====
The aforementioned convent in Vilnius was disbanded and the sisters forcefully expelled to France in 1841 by the order of Tsar Nicholas I. In 1901, the Visitandines came from Versailles to Poland, where they found a new home in a newly-built convent in Jasło, that received them officially in 1903. Like its sister convents, the Visitandines of Jasło managed a pension for women and girls, although its capacity as a school was not formally recognised; their educational activity ceased with the outbreak of World War I. During World War II, the sisters were once again displaced and the convent first converted to a war hospital and then detonated. The Visitandines returned to the ruins in the 1950s and the slow process of rebuilding begun; in 1966, the church was consecrated again as part of the wider celebrations of 1000-year anniversary of Catholicism in Poland.

==== Rybnik ====
In 1942, the Visitandines of Vilnius were expelled once again. They were forbidden from wearing the habit and had to live among civilians for the remainder of World War II. In 1946, the bishop Stanisław Adamski invited them to Siemanowice Śląskie. In the year 2000, the convent in Siemanowice was closed and the sisters moved to Rybnik. The Visitandine sisters in Rybnik are mostly elderly.

===In the United States===
In the United States there are 10 monasteries in two federations. The monasteries of the First Federation live the purely contemplative life, observing papal enclosure, with solemn vows, and have retained the traditional habit of the order. Of the ten monasteries of the Visitation in the United States, six belong to the First Federation.

====First federation====
* The Convent of the Visitation in Mobile, Alabama was founded in 1833 by Bishop Michael Portier, first bishop of Mobile. Aware of the lack of schools in his diocese, he remembered the fine work of the Visitation nuns throughout his native France. Five nuns from the monastery in Georgetown, Washington, D. C. boarded a sailing ship in November, 1832 and arrived in Mobile a month later. In March, 1840, a tornado leveled the buildings. In the 1950s the school was converted to a retreat house. The monastery also serves as a distribution center for communion breads used by churches throughout the Mobile Archdiocese and for many churches in surrounding states, a service extended to a number of non-Catholic churches as well
* In 1866 Visitation Sisters from Baltimore, Maryland came to Richmond, Virginia at the request of Bishop John McGill. In 1987 the Visitation Sisters relocated to Rockville, Virginia (where they continue to bake altar breads as their main source of income).
** In 1846, 11 of the Georgetown Visitation sisters relocated to Frederick, Maryland to carry on a school began by the Sisters of Charity in 1824, which from that date became the Visitation Academy of Frederick - which had an important part in Civil War history when it was occupied in September 1862 (until January 1863) by Union Troops and became General Hospital #5 following the Battles of South Mountain and Antietam. In the spring of 2005 the Visitation Monastery closed its doors and the remaining three Visitation Sisters transferred to the Monastery of the Visitation of Holy Mary Monte Maria in Rockville, Virginia.
* The Visitation community of Tyringham, Massachusetts was founded in 1853 in Keokuk, Iowa by the Visitation Monastery of Montluel, France. In the 19th Century, it was necessary for Visitation communities, both in France and in the United States, to have academies for girls in order to support themselves. After having moved from Keokuk, Iowa, to Suspension Bridge, New York, and then, lastly, to Wilmington, Delaware in 1868, a generous benefactress enabled the community to close the school in 1893 and live the full contemplative life. In 1993 the community relocated to Massachusetts and moved into its present monastery, Mont Deux Coeurs, in December 1995.
* The Visitation nuns were founded in Toledo from Georgetown in 1915 at the invitation of Bishop Joseph Schrembs.
* The Monastery of the Visitation was established in Atlanta Georgia and moved to Snellville, Georgia in 1974.
* Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

====Second federation====
Sisters of the Second Federation add apostolic work to their contemplative life.
* Georgetown Visitation Monastery was the first house of the Visitation founded in the United States. In 1799, three sisters in the order were given permission by Archbishop Leonard Neale to start a girls&#x27; school located next to Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C., called the Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School. In 1816, the Georgetown Visitation Monastery was founded with Teresa Lalor as superior.
* On May 3 of 1833, eight sisters from the Georgetown Visitation founded the first Visitation Academy in the midwest at Kaskaskia, Illinois. On the final leg of their trip from Georgetown, the Sisters crossed the Mississippi River from Missouri into Illinois. First person accounts tell of the Sisters &quot;sitting in a ferryboat that took them across the river. They sat dangerously close to the brown water.&quot; In April 1844, six sisters left to begin the Visitation Academy of St. Louis in St. Louis, Missouri. On June 24, the flooding Mississippi River forced evacuation from Kaskaskia, and a steamboat bearing visitors to the monastery rescued sisters, students, and furnishings through the second story windows, and transported them to St. Louis. In 1992, five sisters from the Rock Island, Illinois Visitation merged with the St. Louis community. Later eleven sisters from St. Louis re-located to the Mercy Sisters&#x27; retirement facility, Catherine&#x27;s House, in St. Louis.
* The Visitation monastery in Brooklyn, New York was founded in 1855 by sisters from Baltimore.
* In 1873, six Sisters of the Visitation from St. Louis, Missouri traveled by steamship for eight days up the Mississippi river to the fast-growing river town of St. Paul, Minnesota at the request of Bishop Grace, who asked them to make a new foundation and to open a school, Convent of the Visitation School; together, the school and monastery moved four times as they expanded. In 1966, the sisters and school moved to Mendota Heights, where the larger facility allowed for expanded programs and enrollment. The Mendota monastery was slated to close in mid-January 2019, with the remaining three sisters moving to a health care facility or other Visitation monastery. The school — now simply called Visitation School — remains today at the Mendota Heights campus.
** In 1989, the Leadership of the Second Federation of the Visitation Order in the United States of America established an urban monastic community in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As part of their ministry to families they offer education sessions, such as cooking and nutrition, finance and budgeting, college preparation, etc. for neighborhood teens.

The Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy was founded in 1848 as the Wheeling Female Academy in downtown Wheeling, West Virginia and in 1865 assumed its current name. While grades five through twelve were all female, Mount de Chantal&#x27;s Montessori and Elementary schools were co-ed. The school ceased operations on May 31, 2008, and the nuns re-located to the Georgetown Visitation in Washington, D.C. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, before being razed on November 7, 2011.

==Notable Visitandines==

A notable saint of the order is Margaret Mary Alacoque, who reportedly received the revelations of the Sacred Heart of Jesus resulting in the First Friday Devotion, the Holy Hour and the Feast of the Sacred Heart. 
Another notable figure of the Visitation Order was Marie Martha Chambon, known for having reported a series of revelations from Jesus and having introduced, at the beginning of the 20th century, the devotion of the Chaplet of the Holy Wounds (or &quot;Holy Wounds Rosary&quot;).
On May 10, 1998, seven Visitandine nuns of the First Monastery of Madrid, Spain, martyred during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, were beatified in Rome by Pope John Paul II.

* Maria Gabriela de Hinojosa Naveros (b. July 24, 1872 in Alhama, Granada)
* Teresa Maria Cavestany y Anduaga (b. July 30, 1888 in Puerto Real, Cadiz)
* Josefa Maria Barrera Izaguirre (b. May 23, 1881 in El Ferrol, La Coruna)
* Maria Ines Zudaire Galdeano (b. January 28, 1900 in Echavarri, Navarre)
* Maria Cecilia Cendoya Araquistain (b. January 10, 1910 in Azpeitia, Guipuzcoa)
* Maria Engracia Lecuona Aramburu (b. July 2, 1897 in Oyarzun Guipuzcoa)
* Maria Angela Olaizola Garagarza (b. November 12, 1893 in Azpeitia Guipuzcoa

The nuns were members of the Madrid House of the Order of the Visitation. In early 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, as religious persecution intensified, most of the community moved to Oronoz, leaving a group of six nuns in the charge of Sr Maria Gabriela de Hinojosa. By July they were confined to their apartment, When a neighbour reported them to the authorities, and in November 1936 their apartment searched. Nevertheless, they refused to seek refuge in the consulates.

The following evening, a patrol of the Iberian Anarchist Federation broke into the apartment and ordered all the sisters to leave. They were taken by van to a vacant area and shot. Maria Cecilia, who had run when she felt the sister next to her fall, surrendered shortly after and was shot five days later at the cemetery wall in Vallecas on the outskirts of Madrid.

In 2010, in honor of the worldwide Jubilee Year for the Visitation Order, Pope Benedict XVI granted a plenary indulgence to those who would make a visit to and pray in a Visitation monastery.

Léonie Martin (1863-1941), the third sister of Thérèse of Lisieux, became a nun of the Order of the Visitation after many failures and hardships in her life. She received the veil on the 2nd of July 1900 at the Visitation in the French city of Caen and took the name Sister Françoise-Thérèse. On the 24 January 2015, the process for Leonie&#x27;s beatification began and she is now known as Servant of God.

<text>Aharon Appelfeld (; born Ervin Appelfeld; February 16, 1932 – January 4, 2018) was an Israeli novelist and Holocaust survivor.

==Biography==
Ervin (Aharon) Appelfeld was born in Jadova Commune, Storojineț County, in the Bukovina region of the Kingdom of Romania, now Ukraine. In an interview with the literary scholar, Nili Gold, in 2011, he remembered his home town in this district, Czernowitz, as &quot;a very beautiful&quot; place, full of schools and with two Latin gymnasiums, where fifty to sixty percent of the population was Jewish. In 1941, when he was nine years old, the Romanian Army retook his hometown after a year of Soviet occupation and his mother was murdered. Appelfeld was deported with his father to a forced labor camp in Romanian-controlled Transnistria. He escaped and hid for three years before joining the Soviet army as a cook. After World War II, Appelfeld spent several months in a displaced persons camp in Italy before immigrating to Palestine in 1946, two years before Israel&#x27;s independence. He was reunited with his father after finding his name on a Jewish Agency list in 1960. (Both Appelfeld and his father had presumed the other had been murdered in the Holocaust. They had both made their way separately to Israel after the war.) The father had been sent to a &quot;ma&#x27;abara&quot; (refugee camp) in Be&#x27;er Tuvia. The reunion was so emotional that Appelfeld had never been able to write about it.

In Israel, Appelfeld made up for his lack of formal schooling and learned Hebrew, the language in which he began to write. His first literary efforts were short stories, but gradually he progressed to novels. He completed his studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He lived in Mevaseret Zion and taught literature at Ben Gurion University of the Negev and was often writing in Jerusalem&#x27;s Ticho House (Beit Ticho).

In 2007, Appelfeld&#x27;s &quot;Badenheim 1939&quot; was adapted for the stage by Arnold Wesker and performed at the Gerard Behar Center in Jerusalem.

== Choice of language ==
Appelfeld was one of Israel&#x27;s foremost living Hebrew-language authors, despite the fact that he did not learn the language until he was a teenager. His mother tongue was German, but he was also proficient in Yiddish, Ukrainian, Romanian, Russian, English, and Italian. With his subject matter revolving around the Holocaust and the sufferings of the Jews in Europe, he could not bring himself to write in German. He chose Hebrew as his literary vehicle for its succinctness and biblical imagery.

Appelfeld purchased his first Hebrew book at the age of 25: &quot;King of Flesh and Blood&quot; by Moshe Shamir. In an interview with the newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot;, he said he agonized over it, because it was written in Mishnaic Hebrew and he had to look up every word in the dictionary.

In an interview in the &quot;Boston Review&quot;, Appelfeld explained his choice of Hebrew: &quot;I’m lucky that I’m writing in Hebrew. Hebrew is a very precise language, you have to be very precise—no over-saying. This is because of our Bible tradition. In the Bible tradition you have very small sentences, very concise and autonomic. Every sentence, in itself, has to have its own meaning.&quot;

==The Holocaust as a literary theme ==
Many Holocaust survivors have written an autobiographical account of their survival, but Appelfeld does not offer a realistic depiction of the events. He writes short stories that can be interpreted in a metaphoric way. Instead of his personal experience, he sometimes evokes the Holocaust without even relating to it directly. His style is clear and precise, but also very modernistic.

Appelfeld resided in Israel but wrote little about life there. Most of his work focuses on Jewish life in Europe before, during and after World War II. As an orphan from a young age, the search for a mother figure is central to his work. During the Holocaust he was separated from his father, and only met him again 20 years later.

==Motifs==
Silence, muteness and stuttering are motifs that run through much of Appelfeld&#x27;s work. Disability becomes a source of strength and power. Philip Roth described Appelfeld as &quot;a displaced writer of displaced fiction, who has made of displacement and disorientation a subject uniquely his own.&quot;

<doc id="1069117" wikidata="Q4757684" url="?curid=1069117" title="Andrew Laming">
<text>Andrew Charles Laming (born 30 September 1966) is an Australian medical doctor and former politician. He was a Liberal Party member of the House of Representatives representing the Division of Bowman for the Liberal National Party of Queensland from 2004 to 2022.

Laming was a medical practitioner and a management consultant before entering politics. He is the son of former Queensland state Liberal MP Bruce Laming, who held the seat of Mooloolah from 1992 until 2001, and served as Deputy Speaker of the Queensland Legislative Assembly.

==Early life==
Laming was born on 30 September 1966 in Hobart, Tasmania. He was educated at the Anglican Church Grammar School. He studied medicine at the University of Queensland and is a fellow of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists. He also holds a Diploma in obstetrics and gynaecology from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, as well as a Master of Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University, a Master of Public Policy from Charles Darwin University and a Master of Philosophy in Public Health from the University of Sydney. He has worked in public health, economics, ophthalmology.

==Medical career==
After graduating from the University of Queensland in 1990, Laming worked as a rural GP in Gundagai, New South Wales, and the rural Queensland towns of Goondiwindi, Mungindi, Dirranbandi and St George. In 1991, he researched anterior cruciate ligament injuries at the Perisher ski fields. In 1992, he worked as a gym manager and rigger in South Africa as well as three months in Afghanistan clearing land mines with the British charity Halo Trust and doing basic war surgery with the International Council of the Red Cross in Kabul. He continued obstetric training in 1993 with a diploma of obstetrics in Bromley and Farnborough Hospital in the UK.

Laming worked in the Northern Territory community of Lajamanu in 1995, combining ophthalmic surgery training and public health. As part of a Master of Philosophy in Public Health, he was the principal researcher in evaluating single dose azithromycin for mass treatment of trachoma. This treatment became standard practice partly as a result of Laming&#x27;s research. He conducted eye disease surveys across the top end as an ophthalmic registrar and co-founded &quot;RedANT&quot; – Australia&#x27;s first mobile eye disease database, earning a Master of Public Policy from Charles Darwin University in 2000.

In 1999, Laming established FIDO – Friends In Deed Organisation – while completing ophthalmology training at Sydney Eye Hospital and Royal North Shore Hospital. FIDO was Australia&#x27;s first internet-based volunteering service which partners skilled volunteers with not-for-profit organisations. Fido is now operated by The Centre for Volunteering in New South Wales and in 2006 it became known as Fido Skilled Volunteer Search.

In 2000, while studying for a Master of Public Administration at Harvard University&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government, Laming was one of three people who established the now annual &quot;Kennedy School Review&quot;. He co-authored &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Turkey&quot; in 2001 before joining the World Bank Group&#x27;s Health Nutrition and Population section in Washington DC. He then worked with the East Timor Transitional Authority as Health Planning Specialist as the country&#x27;s health system was rebuilt.

At the 2001 federal election, Laming unsuccessfully challenged Con Sciacca in the federal seat of Bowman.

In 2002, Laming was employed as then Health Minister Kay Patterson&#x27;s medical and public health advisor, then worked as an ophthalmologist, and a public sector consultant to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.

Laming was one of seven Liberal MPs in the 46th Parliament of Australia who had obtained degrees at an Oxbridge or Ivy League university, the others being Alan Tudge, Angus Taylor, Josh Frydenberg, Dave Sharma, Greg Hunt and Paul Fletcher.

==Parliamentary career==
After the 2004 federal redistribution in Queensland, Sciacca nominated for the newly created seat of Bonner, which contained historically safe Labor areas formerly in Bowman, and Laming secured the now notionally Liberal seat of Bowman, centred on Redland City.

In his first parliamentary term, Laming was appointed to represent the government on the UNESCO National Commission and in 2005, he participated in the International Election Observer Mission as an observer of the election of Bougainville&#x27;s first autonomous government.

In 2006, he was a contributor to the debate on a bill to lift the ban on the &quot;abortion pill&quot; RU486. He said that while undergoing post-graduate training in obstetrics and gynaecology in London, he was required to perform late-term abortions which he found &quot;harrowing&quot;. He introduced an amendment to the bill, which would give Parliament a right of veto over the quasi-autonomous government drug regulator – the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). He failed to win support for the amendment and ultimately supported the bill.

At the 2007 federal election, it initially appeared on election night as if Laming had lost Bowman to Labor rival Jason Young on a large swing. However, counting of pre-poll votes which progressed over the next couple of weeks placed Laming marginally ahead, and the Australian Electoral Commission eventually declared him the winner on a 0.04-point margin – just 64 votes ahead – having suffered a two-party-preferred swing of 8.86 points, compared with the Queensland state average of 7.53 points.

At the 2010 federal election, Laming was re-elected to the seat of Bowman with a swing of more than 10 points. He was subsequently promoted to the position of Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Health Services and Indigenous Health and onto the front bench. Through this shadow portfolio, Laming was critical of the Government&#x27;s handling of intervention in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory.

Throughout his political career, Laming has served on a number of parliamentary committees. These include the House of Representatives&#x27; Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts from 2004 to 2007, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit from 2004 to 2007, the House of Representatives&#x27; Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs from 2006 to 2010, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in 2007, and the House of Representatives&#x27; Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations in 2008.

In May 2013, Laming announced that he would maintain his registration as an eye specialist by applying to the newly constituted AHPRA; stating that this would give him the opportunity to volunteer in Aboriginal communities to perform eye exams and screen for disease to save surgeons time. The Medical Board of Australia granted Laming six time extensions to complete the required paperwork and an unsuccessful application leading to an order to pay the Medical Board&#x27;s legal costs, Laming&#x27;s second AHPRA application was successful.

In 2006, Laming supported reform of the PBS, but his proposed changes caused backlash from the Pharmacy Guild.

In 2018, he supported Peter Dutton&#x27;s calls to treat white South African farmers as refugees. Laming&#x27;s support of the bill has been linked to a view expounded by the NSW Young Nationals used to influence the party to adopt alt-right views in a report by the ABC. The attempt to prioritise white South African farmers, who are sometimes targets of attacks, above other humanitarian crises at the time was labelled as &quot;&#x27;dog-whistling&#x27; to racist voters&quot; by opponents of the bill.
Elected to the House of Representatives for Bowman, Queensland in 2004 and re-elected in 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019, he retired prior to the general election in 2022 after several controversies.

===Controversies ===
In 2007, Laming and fellow Queensland Liberal MPs Gary Hardgrave and Ross Vasta were investigated and subsequently cleared of breaches relating to parliamentary entitlements. This included A$67,000 for printing campaign material and Laming&#x27;s five-day employment of a staff member who worked in the office of Hardgrave. There was speculation in the media and the Queensland Parliament that funds had been diverted to the Liberals&#x27; 2006 state election campaign. On 2 March 2007, the Australian Federal Police conducted a search on the three MPs&#x27; electoral offices as well as those of a printing company and a graphic artist.

On 13 August, Ross Vasta was cleared and Gary Hardgrave was cleared on 11 September. Vasta had admitted making an &quot;administrative error&quot; during the investigation, and repaid nearly $24,000. On 28 September 2007, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions announced that there were not &quot;reasonable prospects of conviction for a criminal offence against Dr Laming&quot;, effectively clearing him.

In January 2013, in response to clashes between groups of Indigenous Australians and Pacific Islanders in , Queensland, Laming twice posted the following statement on Twitter: &quot;Mobs tearing up Logan tonight. Did any of them do a day&#x27;s work today, or was it business as usual and welfare on tap?&quot; The federal Labor ministers Penny Wong and Craig Emerson subsequently criticised Laming&#x27;s post, with Emerson calling it &quot;disgraceful and inflammatory&quot;, while fellow Liberal and shadow Minister Greg Hunt stated that there was a need to be cautious about commenting on the clashes. Laming later posted another tweet which stated &quot;To clarify: Working together to resolve these riots the priority. Training and a chance for jobs are key&quot;. The acting opposition leader Warren Truss told reporters that Laming &quot;has got to take responsibility for his own actions. He&#x27;s done that by correcting the tweet&quot;.

On Australia Day in 2014, at a barbecue in his electorate of Bowman, Laming a beer while performing a handstand, attracting significant media attention. The stunt was criticised as attention seeking, prompting then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott to comment that &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t be how I would choose to celebrate Australia Day&quot;, while a witness at the barbecue stated that they were &quot;a little bit surprised when he did it, but in the context of the party it was OK&quot;. Earlier that week, Laming voiced opposition to reduced licensing hours for drinking establishments, using Facebook to post: &quot;Why should idiots remove my right to stay out late celebrating a special occasion?&quot;

In March 2015, Laming was suspended from Parliament for 24 hours by the Speaker Bronwyn Bishop for bringing a jar of blackfuel into the Parliament House chamber and pouring it out onto his hand, in protest at the pollution left by cruise ship liners. Bishop said &quot;In his remarks the member himself acknowledged the dangerous nature of the material, setting aside the member&#x27;s own offence in making use of props it is highly disorderly to bring dangerous and flammable substances into each of the chambers. I consider the member&#x27;s actions to be totally disorderly, disrespectful of the House and the Federation Chamber and potentially dangerous to the health and safety of members and staff of the Federation Chamber&quot;.

He gained notoriety in December 2016 when he spent eleven hours on the comment section of Facebook page &#x27;The Simpsons Against the Liberals&#x27; after they published a meme making fun of his proposal to stop hiring PE teachers. This spawned a large amount of media attention, especially regarding his use of curious phrases such as &#x27;mashing lefties&#x27;.

On 23 January 2021, Laming made a Facebook post suggesting that Indigenous Australians were petrol sniffers. He has since claimed that posting &quot;Deny it&#x27;s Australia Day. That&#x27;ll help petrol sniffing and school attendance in remote Australia&quot; was not racist.

In March 2021, it was reported that Laming had repeatedly made abusive posts on Facebook targeting two women, with one of the women stating that he had been doing so for six years. Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Laming to apologise for this in parliament before the story was broadcast, which he did. As part of his apology Laming stated that the women are &quot;highly regarded individuals within our Redland community&quot;, though in a subsequent exchange he reportedly said that &quot;In this climate – I willingly apologise – I didn&#x27;t even know what for at 4pm when I did it.&quot; On 27 March, after a third woman accused him of misconduct, Laming issued a statement saying, &quot;I will step down from all Parliamentary roles effective immediately and complete both the counselling courses I committed to; as well as additional clinical counselling.&quot; The following day, Laming announced that he would not stand for re-election. However, he did not withdraw his nomination for preselection after his announcement. On 12 April 2021, he was disendorsed by the LNP, making him eligible for a taxpayer-funded &#x27;resettlement payment&#x27; of six months&#x27; salary, amounting to $105,600.

On 6 April 2021, &quot;Guardian Australia&quot; reported that Laming had set up and operated around 35 Facebook pages, supposedly for community groups and suburbs in his electorate, which he allegedly used to promote political material and attack political opponents, seemingly in contravention of Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) rules requiring political authorisation for information intended to influence how electors vote. On 7 April, the AEC confirmed it was investigating the Facebook pages regarding their lack of authorisation disclosure.

In March 2022, the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority, which audits the travel and expenses of Members of Parliament to ensure they meet parliamentary standards, ordered Laming to repay over $10,000 for travel expenses he claimed in 2019. Laming refused to pay back the money and claimed that the relevant emails proving the purpose of his travel were &#x27;lost&#x27;.

==Post-parliament==
In January 2024, Laming announced he would run for mayor of Redland at the local government elections. On 25 January, he confirmed he had dropped his LNP membership, saying it had &quot;no place&quot; at a local level&quot;.
He received 25 966 votes, less than half of the total received by the successful candidate, Jos Mitchell, who receive 52 599.

<text>British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language (BANZSL, ), or the British Sign Language (BSL) family, is a language family or grouping encompassing three related sign languages: British Sign Language, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). The term &quot;BANZSL&quot; was coined informally by the linguists Trevor Johnston and Adam Schembri in the early 2000s. However, in 2024, Schembri remarked that the Wikipedia article on BANZSL had begun describing it with the more specific or authoritative meaning of &quot;the language from which modern BSL and Auslan and New Zealand sign language have descended&quot;, a meaning that &quot;took on a life of its own—something that we didn&#x27;t intend&quot;. As a result, Schembri says he and Johnston have disowned the term due to pushback from Deaf communities, concerned that it is replacing the names of each of the three languages. 

BSL, Auslan and NZSL all have their roots in a Deaf sign language used in Britain during the 19th century. The three languages in question are related in their use of similar grammar, manual alphabet, and high degree of lexical overlap. 

American Sign Language and the BANZSL varieties are not part of the same language family. However, there is still significant overlap in vocabulary, probably due largely to relatively recent borrowing of lexicon by signers of all three BANZSL varieties, with many younger signers unaware which signs are recent imports.

Between Auslan, BSL and NZSL, 82% of signs are identical (per Swadesh lists). When considering identical as well as similar or related signs there are 98% cognate signs between the languages. By comparison, ASL and BANZSL have only 31% signs identical, or 44% cognate.

According to Henri Wittmann (1991), Swedish Sign Language also descends from BSL. From Swedish SL arose Portuguese Sign Language and Finnish Sign Language, the latter with local admixture; Danish Sign Language is largely mutually intelligible with Swedish SL, though Wittmann places it in the French Sign Language family.

Anderson (1979) instead suggested that Swedish Sign, German Sign and British Sign share one origin in a &quot;North-West European&quot; sign language.

==Languages==

**Northern Ireland SL (19th century - with American Sign Language and Irish Sign Language influences)
**South African SL (somewhere between 1846 &amp; 1881), used by perhaps 235,000 people

<text>Against medical advice (AMA), sometimes known as discharge against medical advice (DAMA), is a term used in health care institutions when a patient leaves a hospital against the advice of their doctor. While leaving before a medically specified endpoint may not promote the patient&#x27;s health above their other values, there is widespread ethical and legal consensus that competent patients (or their authorized surrogates) are entitled to decline recommended treatment.

The available data suggests that in general, patients discharged AMA have an increased risk of hospital readmission, and potentially death. This data however, describes groups of patients discharged AMA, and therefore should not necessarily be applied to an individual patient wishing to leave AMA, and who may have different clinical circumstances and risks.

Although common hospital practice for an AMA discharge involves the patient being asked to sign a form stating that they are aware that they are leaving the facility AMA, the hospital is generally not legally required to use it. Rather, the legal and ethical requirement is that the authorized health care professional has an informed consent discussion with the patient regarding their choice to leave the hospital before it has been recommended. This discussion which includes disclosure of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to hospitalization, as well as the patient&#x27;s understanding, should be documented in the patient&#x27;s chart. Many physicians incorrectly believe that insurance denies payment for the hospitalization of patients leaving AMA, leaving such patients financially responsible. This &quot;pervasive &#x27;medical urban legend may lead to ethical problems, as it &quot;scare[s] patients with misleading information&quot; about their exposure to costs, leading to a &quot;breakdown in the patient–doctor relationship&quot; and an infringement of patient autonomy.

Authors across numerous disciplines have begun to question the wisdom of the practice of designating a discharge as AMA, as it doesn&#x27;t follow professional standards, lacks evidence of its utility to improve patient care, and may harm patients by reducing their likelihood of following up. Finally, there is widespread ethical consensus that even when patients decline recommended treatment, health care professionals still have a duty to care for and support patients.

The limited research in this area has led to a stagnation in effective interventions designed to alleviate AMA discharges. Multiple retrospective studies examining AMA discharges over the last 4 decades have attempted to identify risk factors in order to develop interventions to reduce the likelihood of AMA discharges in the future. The majority of studies have identified patient risk factors for AMA discharges that included low socioeconomic status, history of a substance use disorder, and male sex. No studies have yet attempted to identify physician factors that increase the risk of an AMA discharge. More research is needed to understand this practice and intervene effectively in a patient-centered fashion.

==Statistics==
In the United States, the total number of stays discharged AMA increased 41 percent between 1997 and 2011. For adults ages 45–64 years, the percentage of AMA discharges increased from 27 percent in 1997 to 41 percent in 2011. By payer, the share of AMA discharges increased from 25 percent to 29 percent for Medicare and decreased from 21 percent to 16 percent for private insurance.

<text>Digby Frank Denham (25 January 1859 – 10 May 1944) was a politician and businessman in Queensland, Australia. He was a Premier of Queensland and Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. He was the first of only two Queensland Premiers to lose their own seat at a general election.

==Early life==

Denham was born in Langport, Somerset, England on 25 January 1859 to William Denham, a baker, and his wife Edna Grace, née Cooke. He studied at Langport Grammar School before being indentured to a drapery firm in July 1873. In 1881 Denham migrated to South Australia where he formed a business partnership in Mallala with a commercial traveller, George Cable Knight. He married Knight&#x27;s sister Alice Maud at North Adelaide on 16 April 1884: they were to have two daughters and a son.

Denham moved to Sydney in 1885 to form a partnership in John Melliday &amp; Co. He opened a branch of the firm in Brisbane in 1886, and then bought out the firm in partnership with his brother in 1890, renaming it to Denham Bros, Produce and Grain Merchants. He became involved in several other companies over the following years and by the early 1900s he was chairman of the New Swanbank Colliery Co. and one of the leading businessmen in Brisbane.

==Politics==
From February 1892 until 1902, Denham served as a member, and for four years as chairman, of the Stephens Divisional Board (later the Shire of Stephens) based in Annerley.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1902 until 1915 representing the seat of Oxley, and was Premier of Queensland from 7 February 1911 to 1 June 1915.

In June 1902 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Oxley. He campaigned in opposition to a state income tax which Robert Philp&#x27;s government had proposed, although by the time he became premier in 1911, he had concluded that it was not high enough.

In September 1903 Philp&#x27;s government resigned when its income tax measures were narrowly passed with three supporters, including Denham, crossing the floor. A Liberal-Labour coalition government headed by Arthur Morgan was formed and Denham was appointed Home Secretary and Secretary for Agriculture portfolios in the new administration. In April 1904, Denham became Secretary for Agriculture and Public Works, and in 1906 took on Agriculture and Railways as part of William Kidston&#x27;s government.

In February 1907, sensing that a new anti-Labour coalition could be formed, he resigned his portfolios. Ultimately, Kidston resigned as Premier in November 1907 following the Governor&#x27;s refusal to appoint sympathetic members to the Queensland Legislative Council, and Philp formed a new conservative ministry in November. Denham, now Home Secretary, became the Deputy Premier. However, the Ministry did not command the support of a majority of Parliament, and failed almost immediately, with a new election in February 1908 returning government to Kidston&#x27;s party. However, later that year, Kidston amalgamated his own party with Philp&#x27;s as the Liberals, and Denham returned to the ministry as Secretary for Public Lands. On 7 February 1911 he succeeded Kidston as Premier.

Denham&#x27;s major contribution was the &quot;Land Act 1910&quot;, which consolidated 50 years of Acts and amendments as well as historic New South Wales legislation still in force in Queensland, and removed much confusion. He was widely praised for his grasp of the legislation.

While Denham commanded an easy majority in the Legislative Assembly, he did not always lead a united party – a parliamentary group known as the Farmers&#x27; Union emerged within the party in reaction to various legislation, while the Legislative Council refused to pass key legislation such as a 1911 liquor bill. A tramway and general strike erupted in Brisbane on 18 January 1912, and Denham enlisted the police and special constables to deal with the strikers, who were criticised for their violent handling of the dispute. When the Commonwealth refused his request to send in the armed forces, Denham contemplated landing troops from a German warship to assist. He called an election, in which his government lost seats in Brisbane (mostly to Labor) but won new seats in rural areas and retained office. The Industrial Peace Act 1912 established an Industrial Court which did not recognise trade unions.

The 1915 election saw the Liberal government swept out of power; 21 seats changed hands, with the main beneficiaries being the new Farmers&#x27; Union, an early precursor to the Country Party, and the Labor Party, which formed a majority government for the first time under T. J. Ryan. Denham lost his own seat in the election, as did several of his ministers. Denham was the first of only two Queensland Premiers to lose his seat in a general election, the other being Campbell Newman in the 2015 election.

==Later life==

Denham returned to business, establishing new firms in the Maryborough area in the late 1920s. He keenly supported the establishment of the University of Queensland, the ambulance service and the Baptist Church in Queensland. He was Grand Master of the Loyal Orange Institution of Queensland and frequently took the chair with Oxley True Blues LOL 19 who met at the Orange Hall in Sherwood (although this was not his parent lodge).

Denham died on 10 May 1944 at Annerley, survived by his wife and children. His family declined a state funeral and on 12 May a private funeral service commenced at his home &quot;Ingleside&quot; at 391 Annerley Road, Annerley followed by his burial in the nearby South Brisbane Cemetery. At probate, his estate was valued at £44,085.

Denhams in Brisbane went into voluntary liquidation but the companies in Maryborough and Rockhampton continued.

His residence &quot;Ingleside&quot; is heritage-listed and is located at 391 Annerley Road, Annerley, close to the intersection of Denham Street, presumably named after him.

<text>Sun Fo (; 21 October 1891 – 13 September 1973), courtesy name Zhesheng (), was a Chinese politician and high-ranking official in the government of the Republic of China. He was the son of Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, and his first wife Lu Muzhen.

==Biography==

Sun was born in Xiangshan (now Zhongshan), Guangdong, China. He studied abroad, graduated in 1911 from Saint Louis College (now Saint Louis School, K-12, Honolulu, Hawaii), earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of California, Berkeley in 1916 and a Master of Science from Columbia University in 1917. He also received an honorary LL.D. from Columbia. He married Chen Suk-ying and had two sons (Sun Tse-ping and Sun Tse-kiong) and two daughters (Sun Sui-ying and Sun Sui-hwa). He had two more daughters; Sun Sui-fong with Yan Ai-juang, and Sun Sui-fen with Lan Yi. Most of his children, including daughters, went on to have successful careers in public.

After returning to China, Sun was appointed Mayor of Guangzhou (Canton), where the Kuomintang&#x27;s government headed by his father was headquartered, serving from 1920 to 1922 and again from 1923 to 1925 (between 1922 and 1923, Sun Yat-sen was exiled by Chen Jiongming). As recorded in a China Mail (a Chinese newspaper) on 4 June 1923, there was controversy in relation to a case involving 50,000 yuan and Sun Fo. The case was voiced in public through Chan Po-yin (陳步賢; 1883–1965), a Senator of Guangzhou. In the Nationalist government, Sun served as Minister of Communications from 1926 to 1927, as Minister of Finance from 1927 to 1928 and Minister of Railways from 1928 to 1931.

In 1928, he became President of Chiao Tung University in Shanghai, and made many administrative and educational reforms, including introducing a Moral Education Department. He created the Science College, which incorporated three departments (Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry).

In 1931, the near civil war caused by the arrest of Hu Hanmin and the invasion of Manchuria forced Chiang Kai-shek to resign. For one month, he was President of the Executive Yuan (Premier). He found the government was paralyzed by the absence of the party&#x27;s Big Three: Hu, Chiang, and Wang Jingwei. High level negotiations brought the latter two back into politics with Wang becoming premier.

Sun disagreed with Chiang extensively on their objectives, Sun desired to put off war against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in favor of war against Japan, and reach an agreement with the CCP.

Sun became President of the Legislative Yuan from 1932 to 1948 (the first to head the Legislative Yuan under the 1947 Chinese Constitution, which he helped frame). From 1947 to 1948 he was Vice Chairman of the Nationalist Government and he served again as President of the Executive Yuan from 1948. During this time, he gained the reputation of having an &quot;iron neck&quot; —an outspoken liberal against Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s authoritarian tendencies, he could not be purged because he was the son of Sun Yat-sen. In the first election for president and vice president under the new Constitution in 1948, Sun stood for the vice presidency against Li Zongren and Cheng Chien. Despite his previous veiled criticisms of Chiang, Sun remained the favored choice of Chiang, but Li (one of Chiang&#x27;s rivals in the Kuomintang) won the election.

He was a member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee from 1926 to 1950. Leading the left wing of the Kuomintang, he advocated cooperation with the CCP in the fight against the Japanese military occupation of 1931–1945, and represented his party in negotiations with Zhou Enlai.

Following the full-scale Japanese invasion of 1937, Sun Fo was tasked with obtaining military assistance from the Allied Powers. Turned down by the U.S., Britain, and France, he turned to the Soviet Union. In direct talks with Joseph Stalin in 1937, 1938, and 1939, he secured the crucial arms and ammunition that prevented the total defeat of Nationalist forces. But while Chiang Kai-shek wanted the arms primarily to fight the CCP, Sun Fo insisted that the threat to China&#x27;s national integrity came foremost from the invading outside forces.

At the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, he exiled himself to Hong Kong until 1951, and moved to Europe (stops in Paris and Spain) from 1951 to 1952, and finally resided in the United States (Los Angeles) from 1952 to 1965.

After years of political differences with Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Fo returned to serve in the government of the Republic of China in Taipei as a senior advisor to President Chiang from 1965, and as President of the Examination Yuan from 1966 until his death in 1973. He was also Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Soochow University in Taiwan from 1966 to 1973.

Sun Fo and his wife are buried at Yangmingshan Private Cemetery, in the Beitou District, Taipei, Taiwan.

<doc id="1069141" wikidata="Q1929200" url="?curid=1069141" title="Michael Scheuer">
<text>Michael F. Scheuer (pronounced &quot;SHOY-er&quot;), (born 1952) is an American former intelligence officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, blogger, author, commentator and former adjunct professor at Georgetown University&#x27;s Center for Peace and Security Studies. One assignment during his 22-year career was serving as Chief of the Bin Laden Issue Station (the Osama bin Laden tracking unit at the Counterterrorism Center, known as &quot;Alec Station&quot;) from 1996 to 1999. He also served as Special Advisor to the Chief of Alec Station from September 2001 to November 2004.

Scheuer became a public figure after being outed as the anonymous author of the book &quot;Imperial Hubris&quot; (2004), in which he criticized many of the United States&#x27; assumptions about Islamist insurgencies and particularly Osama bin Laden. Later in 2004, shortly after the &quot;outing&quot; of Scheuer&#x27;s harsh criticism of America&#x27;s close alliance with Israel, Scheuer resigned from his position at the CIA. In his book, Scheuer depicted bin Laden as a rational actor who was fighting to weaken the United States by weakening its economy, rather than merely combating and killing Americans.

Scheuer challenges the common assumption that terrorism is the threat facing the United States in the modern era, arguing rather that Islamist insurgency (and not &quot;terrorism&quot;) is the core of the conflict between the U.S. and Islamist forces, who in places such as Kashmir, Xinjiang, and Chechnya are &quot;struggling not just for independence but against institutionalized barbarism.&quot; Osama bin Laden acknowledged the book in a 2007 statement, suggesting that it revealed &quot;the reasons for your losing the war against us&quot;.

In February 2009, Scheuer was fired from his position as a senior fellow of the Jamestown Foundation by the foundation&#x27;s president. In December 2013 and January 2014, Scheuer was criticized for seeming to advise American citizens to seriously consider assassinating U.S. President Barack Obama. In September 2014, in addition to earlier &quot;praise&quot; received from Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State issued a press release quoting Scheuer in order to appeal to an American audience. By 2019, Scheuer was endorsing QAnon conspiracy theories and advocating violence against various perceived enemies of Donald Trump, including former president Barack Obama, whom Scheuer falsely claimed was &quot;Kenya-born.&quot;

==Biography==
Scheuer was born in Buffalo, New York, and graduated from Canisius College with a BA in history in 1974. He went on to earn an MA in American History from Niagara University in 1976 and another MA in American Canadian Relations from Carleton University in 1982. He also received a PhD in British Empire–U.S.–Canada–U.K. relations from the University of Manitoba in 1986.

Scheuer served in the CIA for 22 years before resigning in 2004. He was chief of the Bin Laden Issue Station at the CIA&#x27;s Counterterrorism Center from 1996 to 1999, and worked as Special Adviser to the Chief of the bin Laden unit from September 2001 to November 2004. He is now known to have been the anonymous author of both the 2004 book &quot;Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror&quot; and the earlier anonymous work &quot;Through Our Enemies&#x27; Eyes: Osama bin Laden, Radical Islam, and the Future of America&quot;. After his anonymously published books were publicly associated with his name, he was mentioned by Osama bin Laden in his statement of September 7, 2007. 

After leaving the CIA in 2004, Scheuer worked as a news analyst for CBS News and a terrorism analyst for the Jamestown Foundation&#x27;s online publication &quot;Global Terrorism Analysis&quot;. He made radio and television appearances and taught a graduate-level course on Al-Qaeda at Georgetown University. He also participates in conferences on terrorism and national security issues, such as the New America Foundation&#x27;s December 2004 conference, &quot;Al Qaeda 2.0: Transnational Terrorism After 9/11.&quot;

In 2009, Scheuer reported that he had lost his position as a Senior Fellow with the Jamestown Foundation, after &quot;several major financial donors to Jamestown threatened to withdraw funding&quot; if he continued in that role. The funding threats were pursuant to his criticism of Barack Obama&#x27;s &quot;dancing the Tel Aviv two-step&quot; in allegedly kowtowing to the Israeli lobby, as well as Scheuer&#x27;s disdaining of Obama&#x27;s selection as Chief of Staff of Rahm Emanuel, &quot;a U.S. citizen who during the 1991 Gulf War left America to serve in Israel&#x27;s military.&quot;

==Publications==
===&quot;Through Our Enemies&#x27; Eyes&quot;===
His first book, published anonymously, is an analysis of the public discourse available on al-Qaeda&#x27;s ideology and strategy. In it, Scheuer explores the bin Laden phenomenon and its implications for U.S. security. He began the book in 1999 as an unclassified manual for counterterrorism officers. Due to the secrecy agreement he signed as an employee of the CIA, the book is based solely on unclassified intelligence or material available from open sources such as media reports. His main thesis in the work is that the view of bin Laden as a lunatic is a form of &quot;myopia&quot; that limits Western military thinkers&#x27; ability to respond to the bin Laden phenomenon. He writes that &quot;the West&#x27;s road to hell lies in approaching the bin Laden problem with the presumption that only the lunatic fringe could oppose what the United States is trying to accomplish through its foreign policy toward the Muslim world. Bin Laden&#x27;s philosophy is slowly harnessing the two most powerful motivating forces in contemporary international affairs: religion and nationalism.&quot;

[T]he crux of my argument is simply that America is in a war with militant Islamists that it cannot avoid; one that it cannot talk or appease its way out of; one in which our irreconcilable Islamist foes will have to be killed, an act which unavoidably will lead to innocent deaths; and one that is motivated in large measure by the impact of U.S. foreign policies in the Islamic world, one of which is unqualified U.S. support for Israel. 

===&quot;Imperial Hubris&quot;===

In his second book, &quot;Imperial Hubris&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, Scheuer writes that the Islamist threat to the United States is rooted in &quot;how easy it is for Muslims to see, hear, experience, and hate the six U.S. policies bin Laden repeatedly refers to as anti-Muslim:
* U.S. support for apostate, corrupt, and tyrannical Muslim governments.
* U.S. and other Western troops on the Arabian Peninsula.
* U.S. support for Israel that keeps Palestinians in the Israelis&#x27; thrall.
* U.S. pressure on Arab energy producers to keep oil prices low.
* U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.
* U.S. support for Russia, India, and China against their Muslim militants.&quot;

Scheuer contends that Al-Qaeda is following a martial strategy that is more rational than it is given credit for among Western politicians and media. He cites Carl von Clausewitz&#x27;s dictum that one must strike one&#x27;s enemy&#x27;s &quot;center of gravity&quot;, and pairs it with an al-Qaeda writer&#x27;s assertion that &quot;the American economy is the American center of gravity&quot;.

In a videotape released around September 7, 2007, Osama bin Laden stated, &quot;If you want to understand what&#x27;s going on and if you would like to get to know some of the reasons for your losing the war against us, then read the book of Michael Scheuer.&quot;

===&quot;Marching Toward Hell&quot;===
Scheuer&#x27;s book &quot;Marching Toward Hell: America and Islam After Iraq&quot; was published on February 12, 2008. It details how the 2003 Iraq War has affected Al-Qaeda and the United States. He argues that the instability in the Iraq War has benefited Al-Qaeda without serving any U.S. interests.

==Views==
===War on Terror===
Scheuer&#x27;s views emphasized the danger of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, as well as the ineffectiveness of U.S. policy against these imminent threats. The threat to the United States, Scheuer has consistently maintained, continues to grow, and the U.S. continually fails to grasp the nature of the struggle in which it is engaged: Islamist and anti-American sentiment continue to grow around the world, and the bin Laden movement is aimed, not at killing or conquering Americans or reforming their internal political systems, but rather bankrupting them in order to reduce their worldwide influence and thereby liberate Muslims from the yoke of American political, military, and financial influence. The failure of the U.S. to apprehend this threat is, in part, rooted in a misunderstanding and underestimation of Osama bin Laden himself. To Scheuer, Osama bin Laden&#x27;s &quot;beliefs, goals, and intentions&quot; were

carefully chosen, plainly spoken, and precise. He has set out the Muslim world&#x27;s problems as he sees them; determined that they are caused by the United States; explained why they must be remedied; and outlined how he will try to do so. Seldom in America&#x27;s history has an enemy laid out so clearly the basis for the war he is waging against it.

Scheuer&#x27;s criticism of U.S. foreign policy includes a sweeping condemnation of the invasion of Iraq, which he has characterized as a &quot;Christmas present&quot; to Osama bin Laden&#x27;s Islamist recruitment efforts, and a validation of bin Laden&#x27;s claims that the U.S. is at war with Islam. From his personal involvement in background research in the run-up to the war, Scheuer states that &quot;there was no connection between [Al Qaeda] and Saddam.&quot;

U.S. rhetoric about bin Laden having allegedly &quot;hat[ed] freedom&quot; has also irked Scheuer, who suggests that those &quot;willing to give their lives to destroy the dictatorship in Saudi Arabia ... must want freedom in some kind of way.&quot; This erroneous rhetoric, according to Scheuer, is not only to be found in the media and among politicians, but even in the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, in which bin Laden and his followers were identified &quot;as takfiris, who kill Muslims if they don&#x27;t agree with them. They&#x27;re not takfiris. They&#x27;re just very devout, severe Salafists and Wahhabis.&quot;

The insistence on referring to al-Qaeda and the Islamist movement around it as a terrorist group or terrorist movement has also been a mistake, according to Scheuer. The U.S. is faced with an insurgency, rather than mere terrorism. Speaking on the BBC News on November 9, 2012, Scheuer criticized what he called the Obama administration&#x27;s deceit about the threat from Islamic militants, and misleading the American people in his first administration by claiming that the word &quot;jihad&quot; had nothing to do with military affairs, and that it had to do with &quot;self reform and community improvement&quot;, which Scheuer claims was a blatant lie.

===Clinton and Bush administrations===
Scheuer has been critical of the Clinton and Bush administrations for not having killed bin Laden, for costly and disastrous policy missteps, and for not taking decisive measures to defend the country. He states that Clinton had eight to ten opportunities to kill bin Laden prior to September 11, and Bush had one opportunity thereafter. Richard A. Clarke and the Clinton administration, according to Scheuer, thwarted the CIA&#x27;s ambitions to kidnap or kill bin Laden when they had the chance. According to Scheuer,

Clarke&#x27;s book &quot;Against All Enemies&quot; is also a crucial complement to the September 11 panel&#x27;s failure to condemn Mr. Clinton&#x27;s failure to capture or kill bin Laden on any of the eight to 10 chances afforded by CIA reporting. Mr. Clarke never mentions that President Bush had no chances to kill bin Laden before September 11 and leaves readers with the false impression that he, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Clinton&#x27;s national security adviser, Sandy Berger, did their best to end the bin Laden threat. That trio, in my view, abetted al Qaeda, and if the September 11 families were smart they would focus on the dereliction of Dick [Clarke], Bill [Clinton] and Sandy [Berger] and not the antics of convicted September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.

Of the Bush administration, Scheuer warns against assigning it full responsibility for the nation&#x27;s troubles since September 11, 2001. Although the &quot;unprovoked attack of Iraq&quot; will forever be remembered as &quot;infamous&quot;, as will Dick Cheney&#x27;s &quot;reptilian contention that Americans who criticize U.S. foreign policy are &#x27;validating the strategy of the terrorists&#x27;&quot;; according to Scheuer, a &quot;bipartisan governing elite&quot;, both Democratic and Republican, is to blame for the nation&#x27;s woes. (Notwithstanding the bipartisan responsibility, Scheuer comments, &quot;the thought of what history will say about Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s tenure at the Department of Defense ought to make his relatives shudder down to their latest generation.&quot;)

===Pending threats===
In 2007, Scheuer said &quot;The Iranians are no threat to the United States unless we provoke them. They may be a threat to the Israelis. They&#x27;re not a threat to the United States. The threat to the United States, inside the United States, comes from al Qaeda. ... These people are going to detonate a nuclear device inside the United States, and we&#x27;re going to have absolutely nothing to respond against.&quot;

===Israel and the Lobby===
Scheuer has stated that the Mearsheimer and Walt paper &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot; is essentially correct. Israel, according to Scheuer, has engaged in one of the most successful campaigns to influence public opinion in the United States ever conducted by a foreign government. Scheuer said to NPR that &quot;They [Mearsheimer and Walt] should be credited for the courage they have had to actually present a paper on the subject. I hope they move on and do the Saudi lobby, which is probably more dangerous to the United States than the Israeli lobby.&quot;

In &quot;Marching Toward Hell&quot;, Scheuer laments &quot;the war in Iraq that was instigated by U.S. citizen Israel-firsters and their evangelical Christian allies&quot;. He continues,

Because both U.S. political parties are wholly owned subsidiaries of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and the Israeli government, there is no large-scale U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq in the cards ... If you doubt this, keep in mind the name Rahm Emanuel. Slated to be the president-elect&#x27;s chief of staff, Mr. Emanuel has labored as a volunteer for AIPAC&#x27;s various anti-U.S. causes, strove to ensure the defeat of anti-Iraq War Democratic congressional candidates in 2006, and in 1991, as a 32-year-old U.S. citizen, chose to serve with the Israeli Defense Forces rather than volunteer to fight for the United States in the war against Saddam&#x27;s Iraq.

In April 2009, Scheuer participated in the Doha Debates at Georgetown University, where he debated for the motion &quot;This house believes that it is time for the USA to get tough on Israel&quot; with fellow speaker Avraham Burg. Speakers against the motion were Dore Gold and Alan Dershowitz. Burg and Scheuer won the debate, with 63% of the audience voting for the motion. During the debate, Scheuer suggested that &quot;the war in Iraq is the responsibility of the American fifth column that supports Israel&quot; and accused Dershowitz of being part of this &quot;fifth column&quot;. Dershowitz responded that he opposed the war in Iraq, that &quot;more Jews than any other ethnic group in America opposed the war in Iraq&quot; and that Scheuer was engaging in &quot;bigotry.&quot;

===Iraq and al-Qaeda===
Thomas Joscelyn of &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; wrote a critical piece on Scheuer and an interview Scheuer did on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;. According to Joscelyn, Scheuer&#x27;s claims that &quot;there was no evidence of a relationship between Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq and al Qaeda&quot;, in various interviews, &quot;directly contradicted&quot; Scheuer&#x27;s earlier assertions, in his first book, in which Scheuer &quot;cited numerous pieces of evidence showing that there was, in fact, a working relationship between Saddam and al Qaeda.&quot;

Scheuer wrote about a relationship between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda in his 2002 book. Yet when interviewed in 2004 he stated that he had found no evidence of a Saddam/al-Qaeda connection. Tim Russert asked Scheuer to explain the seeming contradiction on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; (30 November 2004):
:MR. SCHEUER: I certainly saw a link when I was writing the books in terms of the open-source literature, unclassified literature, but I had nothing to do with Iraq during my professional career until the run-up to the war. What I was talking about on &quot;Hardball&quot; was, I was assigned the duty of going back about nine or 10 years in the classified archives of the CIA. I went through roughly 19,000 documents, probably totaling 50,000 to 60,000 pages, and within that corpus of material, there was absolutely no connection in the terms of a—in the terms of a relationship.

:MR. RUSSERT: But your [2002] book did point out some contacts?

:MR. SCHEUER: Certainly it was available in the open-source material, yes, sir.

Scheuer explains more fully in the revised edition of his 2002 book the exhaustive study of the evidence of the alleged Iraq-al-Qaeda cooperation that eventually led him to the conclusion that there was no relationship between the two forces:

:For a number of reasons, I was available to perform the review of Agency files on Iraq and al Qaeda, and the chief of the bin Laden unit handed me the assignment. I was delighted with the task, eager to begin, and sure that my research would support the analysis I had presented in &quot;Through Our Enemies&#x27; Eyes&quot;. For about four weeks in late 2002 and early 2003, I and several others were engaged full time in searching CIA files—seven days a week, often far more than eight hours a day. At the end of the effort, we had gone back ten years in the files and had reviewed nearly twenty thousand documents that amounted to well over fifty thousand pages of materials. I was both pleased and embarrassed by the results of the research. I was pleased because CIA&#x27;s position was reaffirmed and the analysis of Mr. Feith&#x27;s unit was discredited. There was no information that remotely supported the analysis that claimed there was a strong working relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda. I was embarrassed because this reality invalidated the analysis I had presented on the subject in my book.

===Libyan insurgency===
Scheuer has stated his objection to any involvement by the U.S. in the Libyan insurgency, being particularly critical of the work of United States&#x27; UN representative Susan E. Rice, calling the whole affair &quot;none of our business&quot; and essentially a &quot;recruiting tool for terrorists.&quot; His overall view is that the interests of U.S. foreign policy are far better served by the current status quo, whereby the existing autocratic regimes are better able to suppress the threat he perceives from Al-Qaeda incursion than Western-style democratic systems. Scheuer believes that, irrespective of NATO ostensibly leading the bombing operations, &quot;in the Muslim world, this is Americans killing Muslims again, and it looks like it&#x27;s for oil.&quot;

===2012 endorsement of Ron Paul===
Scheuer penned an editorial in late December 2011 endorsing U.S. presidential candidate Ron Paul. He said, &quot;Dr. Paul&#x27;s precise use of history and common sense exposes the exorbitantly costly effort to build democracies in the Islamic world for what it is; namely, Washington throwing money down the drain for a cause that is impossibly lost from the start and one that will involve us in wars where we have no interests.&quot;

===2016 endorsement of Donald Trump===
Scheuer expressed his support for U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump in multiple blog postings on non-intervention.com. Scheuer based his support on, in his view, Trump&#x27;s strong support of the Second Amendment, Trump&#x27;s proposed wall along the Southern Border, Trump&#x27;s skepticism of NATO and military intervention in the Muslim World, and Trump&#x27;s unpopularity with neoconservatives and their media outlets such as &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, and also much of the mainstream media. Scheuer also likes Trump&#x27;s &quot;America First&quot; talk towards American statecraft.

On December 23, 2013, Scheuer endorsed the extrajudicial killing of then-Prime Minister of Britain David Cameron and President Barack Obama, endorsing the view of Algernon Sidney that &quot;by an established law among the most virtuous nations, every man might kill a tyrant; and no names are recorded in history with more honor, than of those who did it.&quot;

:&quot;In 2014, he [Scheuer] suggested that assassinating Barack Obama was legitimate.&quot;

In July 2018, Scheuer called upon &quot;those millions of well-armed citizens who voted for Trump&quot; to be ready to kill &quot;a long and very precise list&quot; of those who oppose Trump. His list included the entire mainstream media and two former Presidents. &quot;If Trump does not act soon to erase&quot; his opponents, he wrote, &quot;the armed citizenry must step in and eliminate them.&quot;

Scheuer referred to Kyle Rittenhouse, who was charged with murder for shooting people demonstrating in George Floyd protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin a “young hero”, hoping that “Rittenhouse’s necessary, patriotic, and constitutional actions will power the formation of militias across the United States.” In July 2020, he wrote that “loyal Americans know their domestic enemies, as well as their locations, in detail, and will be able to act swiftly to eliminate them and the threat they pose.”

:&quot;In December, [2019] he endorsed the increasingly violent QAnon conspiracy movement, which the FBI has called a potential wellspring of domestic terrorism. Those who deny QAnon’s unhinged hallucinations are, to Scheuer, “coup-ists [and] insurrectionists.” Last month, Scheuer claimed vindication against critics when Trump seemed to acknowledge QAnon. Scheuer has long been comfortable with violence.&quot;

:&quot;Scheuer blogged that “those who do not believe QAnon will be mighty surprised.” It made him the senior-most former intelligence official to embrace a social media-born cult that portrays Trump’s political enemies as a pedophile conspiracy. “There is so much accuracy, and well-proven accuracy,” he wrote of a theory holding John F. Kennedy Jr. is alive and secret indictments will soon imprison Obama and others at Guantanamo.

===European Union===
In March 2018, Scheuer claimed that the European Union was in the process of &quot;falling apart&quot;, saying that British Prime Minister Theresa May was &quot;siding with the EU&quot; during the future relation talks of the UK leaving the European Union.

Scheuer has called for the public execution of European politicians, saying that &quot;all European rulers are tyrants&quot; adding that &quot;they are a despicable bunch, the people that head the European Union, and they really deserve to be hung.&quot; He is critical of the EU&#x27;s abolition of the death penalty and the implications it has on the deportation of terrorist suspects, saying that &quot;the EU&#x27;s policy of easily obtainable political asylum and its prohibition against deporting wanted or convicted terrorists to a country with a death penalty have made Europe a major, consistent and invulnerable source of terrorist threat to the United States.&quot; Scheuer sees the extraordinary renditions carried out by the U.S. government as being hindered by the European Union: &quot;The extraordinary rendition programme should not be destroyed because of &quot;venal and prize hungry reporters, grandstanding politicians and sanctimonious Europeans.&quot;

===Antisemitism===
Scheuer has argued that American Jews are disloyal and &quot;must be stopped and then scoured from the continent&quot; 

==Portrayals==
In the Hulu miniseries, &quot;The Looming Tower&quot; (2018), Scheuer is the basis for the character of Martin Schmidt (portrayed by Peter Sarsgaard), depicted as one of two people primarily responsible for the lack of intelligence sharing between the CIA and the FBI in the lead-up to 9/11.

<text>Katherine Margaret Ellis (born 22 September 1977) is an Australian former politician, who represented the Division of Adelaide in the Australian House of Representatives for the Australian Labor Party from 2004 until 2019. She served in multiple portfolios in the outer ministry of the 2007–2013 federal Labor government and was in the shadow cabinet after that. In March 2017 Ellis announced that she would step down from shadow cabinet as of the next reshuffle and leave parliament at the 2019 federal election.

==Early life and career==
Ellis was born in Melbourne and grew up in rural South Australia in the Murray River town of Mannum where her mother worked as a teacher at the local primary school. Ellis moved to Adelaide for her secondary education, attending Daws Road High School. She enrolled but left without completing a Bachelor of International Studies at Flinders University. While enrolled at Flinders she was General Secretary of the Students Association and an editor of &quot;Empire Times&quot;. A member of the Australian Labor Party, she worked as a research officer for state and federal parliamentarians. Ellis is linked with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA). She was a ministerial adviser to South Australian state minister Rory McEwen and then for the former Deputy Premier of South Australia, Kevin Foley.

==Political career==
Ellis was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Adelaide, South Australia at the 2004 federal election, defeating Liberal Party incumbent Trish Worth on a 2 percent two-party swing to a margin of 1.3 points, increasing to 8.5 points in 2007. The margin was reduced to 7.7 points in 2010 and to 4.0 percent in 2013.

After the 2007 election Ellis became Minister for Youth and Minister for Sport. This made her the youngest person to become an Australian government minister, a record until then held by former Prime Minister Paul Keating. In 2009 Ellis took on the portfolio of Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth. After the 2010 election, Ellis became the Minister for Employment Participation and Early Childhood and Childcare and the Minister for the Status of Women. For a few months prior to the 2013 Labor government defeat, Ellis was the Minister for Early Childhood, Childcare and Youth. Ellis was then elevated to shadow cabinet with the portfolios of Education and Early Childhood.

In 2012 Ellis voted in support of a same-sex marriage bill. She supported the Safe School Coalition Australia program in 2016.

==Personal life==
On 23 February 2013, Ellis married News Limited journalist David Penberthy, then the editor-in-chief of news.com.au and a columnist for several News Limited publications and previously the editor of Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. Ellis gave birth to her first child in April 2015 and a second in July 2017. Ellis supports the Adelaide Football Club and was named as a club ambassador in 2009. In 2011, she joined tennis star Lleyton Hewitt as the club&#x27;s number-one ticket holder, becoming the first woman so honoured. She is also a Club Ambassador for the SANFL team the Glenelg Tigers.

Ellis&#x27;s public image has been the subject of media attention since her entry into public life. In October 2008, she was voted Parliament&#x27;s &quot;sexiest&quot; MP in a poll of federal MPs conducted by &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; newspaper. In April 2010, she modelled a Karen Millen dress and Gucci high-heels for &quot;Grazia&quot; magazine. She agreed to do the shoot to raise awareness of the pressures on women related to body image, and to encourage fashion magazines to promote healthy attitudes toward weight and eating.

On 9 March 2017, Ellis announced that she would step down from shadow cabinet as of the next reshuffle, and leave parliament at the 2019 federal election in order to spend more time with her young family. A week later, it was announced that she was in the early stages of her second pregnancy, and her second son was born in July 2017.

In April 2021, her book, &quot;Sex, Lies and Question Time&quot;, was published by Hardie Grant.

<text>Nikolai Yakovlevich Myaskovsky (; ; 20 April 18818 August 1950), was a Russian and Soviet composer. He is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Father of the Soviet Symphony&quot;. Myaskovsky was awarded the Stalin Prize five times.

==Early years==
Myaskovsky was born in Nowogieorgiewsk, near Warsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire, the son of an engineer officer in the Russian army. After the death of his mother the family was brought up by his father&#x27;s sister, Yelikonida Konstantinovna Myaskovskaya, who had been a singer at the Saint Petersburg Opera. The family moved to Saint Petersburg in his teens.

Though he learned piano and violin, he was discouraged from pursuing a musical career, and entered the military. However, a performance of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Pathétique&quot; Symphony conducted by Arthur Nikisch in 1896 inspired him to become a composer. In 1902 he completed his training as an engineer, like his father. As a young subaltern with a Sappers Battalion in Moscow, he took some private lessons with Reinhold Glière and when he was posted to St Petersburg he studied with Ivan Krizhanovsky as preparation for entry into the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, where he enrolled in 1906 and became a student of Anatoly Lyadov and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

A late starter, Myaskovsky was the oldest student in his class but soon became firm friends with the youngest, Sergei Prokofiev, and they remained friends throughout the older man&#x27;s life. At the Conservatory, they shared a dislike of their professor Anatoly Lyadov, which, since Lyadov disliked the music of Edvard Grieg, led to Myaskovsky&#x27;s choice of a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his String Quartet No. 3.

== Early works ==
Prokofiev and Myaskovsky worked together at the conservatory on at least one work, a lost symphony, parts of which were later scavenged to provide material for the slow movement of Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 4. They both later produced works using materials from this period—in Prokofiev&#x27;s case the Third and Fourth piano sonatas; in Myaskovsky&#x27;s other works, such as his Tenth String Quartet and what are now the Fifth and Sixth Piano Sonatas, all revisions of works he wrote at this time.

Early influences on Myaskovsky&#x27;s emerging personal style were Tchaikovsky, strongly echoed in the first of his surviving symphonies (in C minor, Op. 3, 1908/1921), which was his Conservatory graduation piece, and Alexander Scriabin, whose influence comes more to the fore in Myaskovsky&#x27;s First Piano Sonata in D minor, Op. 6 (1907–10), described by Glenn Gould as &quot;perhaps one of the most remarkable pieces of its time&quot;, and his Symphony No. 3 in A minor, Op. 15 of 1914, a turbulent and lugubrious work in two large movements.

Myaskovsky graduated in 1911 and afterwards taught in Saint Petersburg, where he also developed a supplementary career as a penetrating musical critic, writing for the Moscow publication, &quot;Muzyka.&quot; He was one of the most intelligent and supportive advocates in Russia for the music of Igor Stravinsky, though the story that Stravinsky dedicated &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; to Myaskovsky is untrue.

Called up during World War I, he was wounded and suffered shell-shock on the Austrian front, then worked on the naval fortifications at Tallinn. During this period he produced two diametrically opposed works, his Symphony No. 4 (Op. 17, in E minor) and his Symphony No. 5 (Op. 18, in D major). The next few years saw the violent death of his father, an ex-Tsarist general who was murdered by Red Army soldiers while waiting for a train in the winter of 1918–19, and the death of his aunt, to whom he was closely attached, in the winter of 1919–20. His brother-in-law, the husband of his sister Valentina Yakovlevna, had committed suicide before the War because of financial troubles. Myaskovsky himself served in the Red Army from 1917 to 1921; in the latter year he was appointed to the teaching staff of the Moscow Conservatory and membership of the Composers&#x27; Union. Thereafter he lived in Moscow, sharing an apartment with his widowed sister Valentina and her daughter. (He also had a married sister, Vera.)

==Middle years==
In the 1920s and 1930s Myaskovsky was the leading composer in the USSR dedicated to developing basically traditional, sonata-based forms. He wrote no operas—though in 1918 he planned one based on Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;The Idiot&quot;, with a libretto by Pierre Souvtchinsky; but he would eventually write a total of 27 symphonies (plus three sinfoniettas, two concertos, and works in other orchestral genres), 13 string quartets, 9 piano sonatas as well as many miniatures and vocal works. Through his devotion to these forms, and the fact that he always maintained a high standard of craftsmanship, he was sometimes referred to as &#x27;the musical conscience of Moscow&#x27;. His continuing commitment to musical modernism was shown by the fact that along with Alexander Mosolov, Gavriil Popov and Nikolai Roslavets, Myaskovsky was one of the leaders of the Association for Contemporary Music. While he remained in close contact with Prokofiev during the latter&#x27;s years of exile from the USSR, he never followed him there.

Myaskovsky&#x27;s reaction to the events of 1917–21 inspired his Symphony No. 6 (1921–1923, rev. 1947—this is the version that is almost always played or recorded) his only choral symphony and the longest of his 27 symphonies, sets a brief poem (in Russian though the score allows Latin alternatively—see the American Symphony Orchestra page below on the origins of the poem—the soul looking at the body it has abandoned.) The finale contains quite a few quotes—the Dies Irae theme, as well as French revolutionary tunes.

The years 1921–1933, the first years of his teaching at the Moscow Conservatory, were the years in which he experimented most, producing works such as the Tenth and Thirteenth symphonies, the fourth piano sonata and his first string quartet. Perhaps the best example of this experimentative phase is the Thirteenth symphony, which was the only one of his works to be premiered in the United States.

In the 1920s and 1930s Myaskovsky&#x27;s symphonies were quite frequently played in Western Europe and the USA. His works were issued by Universal Edition, one of Europe&#x27;s most prestigious publishers. In 1935, a survey made by CBS of its radio audience asking the question &quot;Who, in your opinion, of contemporary composers will remain among the world&#x27;s great in 100 years?&quot; placed Myaskovsky in the top ten along with Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Shostakovich, Richard Strauss, Stravinsky, Sibelius, Ravel, de Falla and Fritz Kreisler.

The next few years after 1933 are characterized mostly by his apparent discontinuation of his experimental trend, though with no general decrease in craftsmanship. The Violin Concerto dates from these years, the first of two or three concerti, depending on what one counts, the second being for cello, and a third if one counts the Lyric Concertino, Op. 32 as a concerto work.

Another work from the period up to 1940 is the one-movement Symphony No. 21 in F-sharp minor, Op. 51, a compact and mostly lyrical work, very different in harmonic language from the Thirteenth.

Despite his personal feelings about the Stalinist regime, Myaskovsky did his best not to engage in overt confrontation with the Soviet state. While some of his works refer to contemporary themes, they do not do so in a programmatic or propagandistic way. The Symphony No. 12 was inspired by a poem about the collectivization of farming, while No. 16 was prompted by the crash of the huge airliner &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; and was known under the Soviets as the &quot;Aviation Symphony&quot;. This symphony, sketched immediately after the disaster and premiered in Moscow on 24 October 1936, includes a big funeral march as its slow movement, and the finale is built on Myaskovsky&#x27;s own song for the Red Air Force, &#x27;The Aeroplanes are Flying&#x27;. The &quot;Salutation Overture&quot; was dedicated to Stalin on his sixtieth birthday.

==Final decade==
The year 1941 saw Myaskovsky evacuated, along with Prokofiev and Aram Khachaturian among others, to what were then the Kabardino-Balkar regions. There he completed the Symphony-Ballade (Symphony No. 22) in B minor, inspired in part by the first few months of the war. Prokofiev&#x27;s Second String Quartet and Myaskovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 23 and Seventh String Quartet contain themes in common—they are Kabardinian folk-tunes the composers took down during their sojourn in the region. The sonata-works (symphonies, quartets, etc.) written after this period and into the post-war years (especially starting with the Symphony No. 24, the piano sonatina, the Ninth Quartet) while Romantic in tone and style, are direct in harmony and development. He does not deny himself a teasingly neurotic scherzo, as in his last two string quartets (that in the Thirteenth Quartet, his last published work, is frantic, and almost chiaroscuro but certainly contrasted) and the general paring down of means usually allows for direct and reasonably intense expression, as with the Cello Concerto (dedicated to and premiered by Sviatoslav Knushevitsky) and Cello Sonata No. 2 (dedicated to Mstislav Rostropovich).

While not particularly experimental, there is no suggestion—as with some earlier works—that Scriabin or Arnold Schoenberg might still have been an influence. In 1947 Myaskovsky was singled out, with Shostakovich, Khachaturian and Prokofiev, as one of the principal offenders in writing music of anti-Soviet, &#x27;anti-proletarian&#x27; and formalist tendencies. Myaskovsky refused to take part in the proceedings, despite a visit from Tikhon Khrennikov inviting him to deliver a speech of repentance at the next meeting of the Composers&#x27; Union. He was only rehabilitated after his death from cancer in 1950, leaving an output of eighty-seven published opus numbers spanning some forty years and students with recollections.

==Legacy==

===Character and influence===
Myaskovsky was long recognized as an individualist, even by the Soviet establishment. In the 1920s the critic Boris Asafyev commented that he was &quot;not the kind of composer the Revolution would like; he reflects life not through the feelings and spirit of the masses, but through the prism of his personal feelings. He is a sincere and sensible artist, far from &#x27;life&#x27;s enemy&#x27;, as he has been portrayed occasionally. He speaks not only for himself, but for many others&quot;.

Myaskovsky never married and was shy, sensitive and retiring; Pierre Souvtchinsky believed that a &quot;brutal youth (in military school and service in the war)&quot; left him &quot;a fragile, secretive, introverted man, hiding some mystery within. It was as if his numerous symphonies provide a convenient if not necessary refuge in which he could hide and transpose his soul into sonorities&quot;.

Stung by the many accusations in the Soviet press of &quot;individualism, decadence, pessimism, formalism and complexity&quot;, Myaskovsky wrote to Asafyev in 1940, &quot;Can it be that the psychological world is so foreign to these people?&quot; When somebody described Zhdanov&#x27;s decree against &quot;formalism&quot; to him as &quot;historic&quot;, he is reported to have retorted &quot;Not historic – hysterical&quot;. Shostakovich, who visited Myaskovsky on his deathbed, described him afterwards to the musicologist Marina Sabinina as &quot;the most noble, the most modest of men&quot;. Mstislav Rostropovich, for whom Myaskovsky wrote his Second Cello Sonata late in life, described him as &quot;a humorous man, a sort of real Russian intellectual, who in some ways resembled Turgenev&quot;.

Myaskovsky exercised an important influence on his many pupils, as a professor of composition at the Moscow Conservatory from 1921 until his death. The young Shostakovich considered leaving Leningrad to study with him. His students included Aram Khachaturian, Dmitri Kabalevsky, Varvara Gaigerova, Vissarion Shebalin, Rodion Shchedrin, German Galynin, Andrei Eshpai, Alexei Fedorovich Kozlovsky, Alexander Lokshin, Boris Tchaikovsky, and Evgeny Golubev.

The degree and nature of his influence on his students is difficult to measure. What is lacking is an account of his teaching methods, what and how he taught, or more than brief accounts of his teaching; Shchedrin makes a mention in an interview he did for the American music magazine &quot;Fanfare&quot;. It has been said that the earlier music of Khachaturian, Kabalevsky and other of his students has a Myaskovsky flavor, with this quality decreasing as the composer&#x27;s own voice emerges (since Myaskovsky&#x27;s own output is internally diverse such a statement needs further clarification)—while some composers, for instance the little-heard Evgeny Golubev, kept something of his teacher&#x27;s characteristics well into their later music. The latter&#x27;s sixth piano sonata is dedicated to Myaskovsky&#x27;s memory and the early &quot;Symphony No. 0&quot; of Golubev&#x27;s pupil Alfred Schnittke, released on CD in 2007, has striking reminiscences of Myaskovsky&#x27;s symphonic style and procedures.

===Recordings===
Myaskovsky has not been as popular on recordings as have Shostakovich and Prokofiev. Nonetheless, most of his works have been recorded, many of them more than once, including the Cello Concerto, the Violin Concerto, many of the Symphonies, and much of his chamber and solo music.

Between 1991 and 1993 the conductor Yevgeny Svetlanov realized a massive project to record Myaskovsky&#x27;s entire symphonic output and most of his other orchestral works on 16 CDs, with the Symphony Orchestra of the USSR and the State Symphony Orchestra of the Russian Federation. In the chaotic conditions prevailing at the breakup of the USSR, Svetlanov is rumoured to have had to pay the orchestral musicians himself in order to undertake the sessions. The recordings began to be issued in the West by Olympia Records in 2001, but ceased after volume 10; the remaining volumes were issued by Alto Records starting in the first half of 2008. To complicate matters, in July 2008, Warner Music France issued the entire 16-CD set, boxed, as volume 35 of their &#x27;Édition officielle Evgeny Svetlanov&#x27;.

In a testimony printed in French and English in the accompanying booklet, Svetlanov describes Myaskovsky as &quot;the founder of Soviet symphonism, the creator of the Soviet school of composition, the composer whose work has become the bridge between Russian classics and Soviet music ... Myaskovsky entered the history of music as a great toiler like Haydn, Mozart and Schubert. ... He invented his own style, his own intonations and manner while enriching and developing the glorious tradition of Russian music&quot;. Svetlanov also likens the current neglect of Myaskovsky&#x27;s symphonies to the neglect formerly suffered by the symphonies of Gustav Mahler and Anton Bruckner.

===Advocates===
One of Myaskovsky&#x27;s strongest early advocates was the conductor Konstantin Saradzhev. He conducted the premieres of Myaskovsky&#x27;s 8th, 9th and 11th symphonies and the symphonic poem &quot;Silence&quot;, Op. 9 (which was dedicated to Saradzhev). The 10th Symphony was also dedicated to Saradzhev. In 1934 Myaskovsky wrote a &quot;Preludium and Fughetta on the name Saradzhev&quot; (for orchestra, Op. 31H; he also arranged it for piano 4-hands, Op. 31J).

In the 1930s, Myaskovsky was also one of two Russian composers championed by Frederick Stock, the conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The other was Reinhold Glière, whom he met in 1940 and commissioned to write his &quot;Feast in Fergana&quot;, Op. 75, a large-scale orchestral fantasia.

Stock met Myaskovsky in March 1938 at the invitation of the Composers Union. He commissioned Myaskovsky&#x27;s 21st Symphony (Symphony-Fantasy in F-sharp minor) for the Chicago Symphony&#x27;s Fiftieth Anniversary. The first performance was in Moscow on 6 November 1940 (conducted by Aleksandr Gauk); Stock conducted the Chicago premiere on 26 December 1940.

<text>This is a list of members of the [[Australian Senate]] from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2008. Half of the state senators had been elected at the November 2001 election and had terms due to finish on 30 June 2008; the other half of the state senators were elected at the October 2004 election and had terms due to finish on 30 June 2011. The territory senators were elected at the October 2004 election and their terms ended at the next federal election, which was November 2007. The new Senate first met in August 2005, with state senators elected in 2004 sworn in on 9 August 2005.

This election was the beginning of the end for the Australian Democrats, in that while they still had 4 senators from the 2001 election, they failed to win a single senate seat at the 2004 election and have not won a senate seat since.

<doc id="1069166" wikidata="Q7857757" url="?curid=1069166" title="Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>The Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Act 2004 (previously bill no. 15 of 2004) amended the Constitution of Ireland to limit the constitutional right to Irish citizenship of individuals born on the island of Ireland to the children of at least one Irish citizen and the children of at least one parent who is, at the time of the birth, entitled to Irish citizenship. It was approved by referendum on 11 June 2004 and signed into law on 24 June of the same year. It affected in part changes made to the Constitution by the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which was passed as part of the Good Friday Agreement.

==Changes to the text==
A new Article 9.2 was inserted:

The former Article 9.2 was renumbered as Article 9.3.

==Background==
Prior to 1999, the right to citizenship by reason of birth in Ireland existed in ordinary legislation. The only people who had a constitutional right to citizenship were those who were citizens of the Irish Free State when the constitution came into force. For those born after 1937, the Constitution stated that the &quot;future acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law&quot;. This changed in 1999 when, as part of the Nineteenth Amendment, the following clause was inserted into Article 2 of the Constitution:
This provision was intended to ensure that people from Northern Ireland would not be deprived of Irish citizenship, but also created a constitutional right to citizenship by birth. Though immigration concerns did not feature much as an issue in the referendum campaign for the Nineteenth Amendment, it was given as an argument against in the Referendum Commission&#x27;s leaflet:

&quot;The new Article 2 will give a constitutional right of citizenship to anyone born in Ireland. This will make it very difficult to change the laws on citizenship and it may prevent the enactment of necessary laws to regulate immigration.&quot;

By 2002, it was reported that the number of births in Ireland&#x27;s national maternity hospital had reached a 20-year high with 8,162 births, 15% of which were reported as being births to non-nationals.

The Minister for Justice at the time Michael McDowell said that between 40% and 50% of non-EU nationals who give birth in Ireland were doing so to gain Irish citizenship for their children.

In April 2004, an internal Department of Justice memo revealed that in August 2003, the Masters of Ireland&#x27;s maternity hospitals had warned that pregnant women were arriving in Ireland from abroad with their &quot;antenatal notes&quot;.

In October 2004, a European Court of Justice ruling (Case C-200/02) &quot;Chen v Home Secretary&quot; ruled that the non-EU parent of a child who is a citizen of the Union had a right to reside with that child in the EU.

==Campaign==
The Twenty-seventh Amendment was introduced by the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition government of Bertie Ahern. It was also supported by Fine Gael (the largest opposition party) but they refused to campaign due to what they complained was insufficient consultation before the poll. The amendment was opposed by the Labour Party, the Green Party, and Sinn Féin, as well as the Irish Human Rights Commission, a statutory body, and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, a civil society non-profit organisation. It was also opposed by Northern Ireland&#x27;s SDLP, as Irish citizenship is an option for people born there.

The government presented the amendment as a common sense proposal that would close a constitutional loop-hole and allow Irish law to be brought into line with the rest of Europe. In 2004, no other nation of the European Union granted citizenship by birth in the same manner as Ireland.

Some criticisms of the amendment related merely to the manner in which it was proposed. In the lead-up to the referendum the Irish and British governments issued a joint statement saying that they did not regard the proposed constitutional change as affecting the British-Irish Agreement (this being the inter-governmental component of the Good Friday Agreement). The Democratic Unionist Party cited the amendment as evidence that the Agreement could be changed.

The referendum on the amendment was held on the same day as both European and local elections.

In the referendum, the amendment was ultimately approved, by a large majority of almost 80% in favour.

==Result==
Although most Irish referendums count votes per Dáil constituency, this one was organised by city/county council area, the basis for the local elections being held simultaneously. Voters received different-coloured ballot papers for the referendum, city/county council election, and European Parliament election; all went into the same ballot box and were separated by colour once the boxes arrived at the count centre for the city/county. Not all voters received all ballots as the franchises differ.

==Aftermath==

The amendment was signed into law on 24 June 2004, after the referendum result had been certified by the High Court. On 29 September the government published a bill to amend nationality law within the scope of the revised constitutional parameters. This bill was signed into law on 15 December 2004 as the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004.

In December 2004, The Master of Ireland&#x27;s National Maternity Hospital Dr Declan Keane told irishhealth.com that prior to the referendum, 16% of the deliveries at the hospital were to non-EU women and five per cent were to women from other EU countries. He said that since the referendum, this figure had been reversed, with 16% of births now accounted for by mothers from other EU countries and five per cent to mothers from outside the EU.

<doc id="1069169" wikidata="Q554027" url="?curid=1069169" title="Allan Houston">
<text>Allan Wade Houston (born April 20, 1971) is an American former professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1993 to 2005. A shooting guard, Houston played nine seasons for the New York Knicks; he was a member of the Knicks&#x27; 1999 NBA Finals team. Houston made the NBA All-Star Team twice and also won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. men&#x27;s basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

As of July 2019, Houston serves as special assistant to the general manager for the New York Knicks and general manager of the Knicks&#x27; G League team, the Westchester Knicks.

==High school and college career==
Houston was born in Louisville, Kentucky and played at Ballard High School in Louisville as they won the 1988 Kentucky state championship. He went on to play at the University of Tennessee (where he played under his coach and father Wade) and graduated in 1993 as the school&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, and is currently second to Chris Lofton at Tennessee for three-point field goals made. Houston is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. On March 6, 2011, the University of Tennessee retired Houston&#x27;s number (20) during halftime ceremonies at a Tennessee-Kentucky game.

==Professional career==

=== Detroit Pistons (1993–1996) ===
Houston was selected in the first round (eleventh overall) by the Detroit Pistons in the 1993 NBA draft, and averaged 8.5 points per game in his rookie year. His average increased to 14.5 and 19.7 points per game in the next two years.

=== New York Knicks (1996–2005) ===
In 1996, after his rookie contract expired, Houston signed as a free agent with the New York Knicks, for whom he played for the next nine seasons. In his first year as a Knick, Houston took the place of John Starks in the starting lineup, with Starks serving as a mentor for him coming off the bench. Houston kept his scoring average at 17 points per game, and helped lead the team to the 1999 NBA Finals. His most famous play came in the decisive Game 5 of the first round of the 1999 Eastern Conference quarterfinals against the Miami Heat. In the fourth quarter, with the Knicks inbounding the ball trailing by one point, Houston caught the inbounds pass, and made a running jumper in the lane with 0.8 second left on the clock to win the game and the series for the Knicks, 78–77, which was then only the second time in NBA playoffs history where a #8 seed had defeated a #1. The Knicks would then defeat the Atlanta Hawks and Indiana Pacers to advance to the NBA Finals. Houston averaged 21.6 points per game in the only Finals appearance of his career, including a memorable 34 point performance in a game 3 victory over San Antonio. The Knicks, decimated by injuries to Patrick Ewing and Larry Johnson, would lose the series 4–1.

During his career, Houston was known for his three-point shooting prowess. Houston also made the All-Star team twice. Despite the on-court accolades, though, Houston&#x27;s lasting legacy may be something that happened off the court: In 2001, Houston signed a six-year, $100.4 million contract extension with the Knicks. Houston&#x27;s yearly salary of over $20 million made him virtually untradeable, and his injury problems would burden the Knicks. Houston missed 32 games in 2003–04 due to a knee injury, and despite claims in the summer of 2004 that he would be ready to play the next season (he even refused to have surgery on his knee that summer), he played in only 20 games that season because his injury had not completely healed. Knee injuries would eventually force Houston to announce his retirement on October 17, 2005. Houston attempted to return to the NBA in 2007, but decided to end his comeback attempt on October 20, 2007, because of bad timing in choosing to join the team so late into preparation for the regular season. Houston was signed by the Knicks to play in 2008, but was cut before the end of the preseason without appearing in a game.

In 2005, the NBA agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement with the players&#x27; union. The agreement included an amnesty clause provision allowing teams to release one player without his contract counting against the NBA&#x27;s luxury tax threshold. The clause did not negate a player&#x27;s contract, a team&#x27;s obligation to pay a player, or a contract&#x27;s impact on the salary cap; it merely made it possible to remove a released player&#x27;s salary from luxury tax calculations on a one-time basis. The clause benefited teams that were in danger of facing the luxury tax, which was a penalty paid by teams with payrolls exceeding a certain threshold. Because the Knicks were expected to use the amnesty clause to waive Houston due to his expensive contract and injury woes (as of the 2005 offseason, two years and $40 million remained on his contract), the amnesty clause was dubbed the &quot;Allan Houston Rule.&quot; After Houston assured his team that he would retire if his knee problems recurred in training camp that fall, the Knicks chose not to use the amnesty clause to release him; instead, they released forward Jerome Williams.

Houston&#x27;s final NBA game was played on January 19, 2005, in a 81–98 loss to the Toronto Raptors where he recorded 3 points, 4 assists, 1 rebound and 1 steal while playing 28 minutes off the bench.

== National team career ==
Houston was a member of the USA men&#x27;s national basketball team that won the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and the 1999 Tournament of the Americas, in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

==Executive career==
In 2008, Houston was hired by the New York Knicks as assistant to the president for basketball operations. In December 2010, Houston was promoted to the position of assistant general manager. As of July 2019, Houston is special assistant to the general manager of the Knicks; he was also general manager of the Westchester Knicks, the organization&#x27;s G League affiliate.

==Personal life==
Houston is married to Tamara Houston. They have seven children together.

<text>Peter Charles Knight (May 5, 1903 – May 23, 1937) was a Canadian and World Champion Rodeo Bronc Rider. Knight was the acclaimed &quot;King of the Cowboys&quot; of the 1930s, and held the Rodeo Association of America title &quot;World Champion Bronc Rider&quot; for 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1936. The Rodeo Hall of Fame in the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum inducted Knight in 1958. The Ellensburg Rodeo Hall of Fame inducted him in 1998. The ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colorado, inducted Knight in the Saddle Bronc Riding category when it opened its doors in 1979.

== Bronc Riding career ==
Knight won second in a bucking contest a few months after beginning training in 1918. Calgary Stampede founder Guy Weadick invited him to compete at the Stampede, which he did in 1924, winning second place in the Canadian Bucking Horse Championship event by 1/10th of a point. He toured with the Alberta Stampede Company, riding Midnight for the first time in October 1926 in Montreal. He won the 1927 Canadian and North American Open bucking championships and was awarded the Prince of Wales&#x27; Cup.
At the 1930 Calgary Stampede, Knight won the Canadian Championship Bucking event for the second time, and weeks later, won the 1930 bucking event at the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo. In 1931, Knight won the World Series Rodeo bucking event held in Madison Square Garden, New York City, and was chosen to compete against three other riders (the bucking event winners of the 1931 Rodeos at Calgary, Pendleton, Oregon, and Cheyenne) for the Jack Dempsey Trophy, which Knight won at Reno, Nevada in the Ride of Champions event held in June 1932. He went on to win the bucking event at the 1932 Pendleton Round-Up in Pendleton, Oregon.

Knight entered the Calgary Stampede in 1933, again winning both the North American Open Bucking Championship and the Canadian Championship Bucking event, and was presented with the Prince of Wales&#x27; Cup for perpetuity. Later in 1933, Knight won the bucking event held at the World&#x27;s Fair Rodeo in Chicago. Later that year, Wilf Carter recorded &quot;Pete Knight, The King of the Cowboys.&quot; The same year, Knight performed screen tests and rode bucking horses in movies for Tom Mix at Los Angeles.

In 1934, Knight was invited to ride in England with the Tex Austin Rodeo Troupe. Later in 1934, Knight was invited to Melbourne, Australia, where he rode in the Stewart McColl pageant with fellow rider Yakima Canutt. The Rodeo Association of America (RAA) named Knight the World Champion Bronc Rider for 1932, 1933, 1935, and 1936. At the Rodeo held in Boston Gardens in 1936, Knight helped organize the Cowboy strike, becoming a founding member of the Cowboys Turtle Association (CTA) in 1936.

On May 23, 1937, Knight was trampled to death by a horse called &quot;Duster&quot;, at the Hayward Rodeo in California. He was buried at Lone Tree Cemetery in Fairview near Hayward; his remains were later reinterred in 1960 at the Greenwood cemetery in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Knight&#x27;s cups, trophies, saddles and buckles became a permanent fixture at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, US. In his hometown of Crossfield, Alberta, the town named its arena in honor of Pete Knight, and holds an annual &quot;Pete Knight Days Rodeo&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Grouper&quot; (SS/SSK/AGSS-214), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the grouper.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Grouper&quot; was launched by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut, on 27 October 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Albert F. Church, and commissioned at New London on 12 February 1942, with Lieutenant Commander C. E. Duke in command.

== 1942 ==
After shakedown in Long Island Sound, &quot;Grouper&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor on 30 March 1942 to join the Pacific Submarine Force, which was to play havoc on Japanese shipping. Before departing for her first war patrol, &quot;Grouper&quot; was assigned to the submarine screen which ringed the area as the American and Japanese fleets clashed in the decisive Battle of Midway. Patrolling the fringe of the fighting on 4 June, &quot;Grouper&quot; sighted two burning enemy aircraft carriers, but could not close for attack because of heavy air cover. On that day, she was strafed by fighter planes and driven deep in a series of aircraft and destroyer attacks which saw over 170 depth charges and bombs dropped on the novice submarine.
The next day, as the battle still raged, &quot;Grouper&quot; crash-dived to avoid enemy bombers. She then put in at Midway for three days for fuel and provisions before sailing on her first war patrol on 12 June. She torpedoed and damaged two Japanese &quot;maru&quot; (civilian) ships before returning to Pearl Harbor on 30 July.

On her second patrol (28 August – 9 October), &quot;Grouper&quot; under the command of Rob Roy McGregor sank two freighters, &quot;Tone Maru&quot; on 21 September and &quot;Lisbon Maru&quot; on 1 October. It was later learned that &quot;Lisbon Maru&quot; was carrying 1800 British POWs from Hong Kong; over 800 died in the sinking.

On her third patrol (12 November – 31 December) to Brisbane, Australia, on 17 December, she encountered and sank &quot;Bandoeng Maru&quot;, a passenger-freighter headed for the Solomon Islands with troop reinforcements.

== 1943 ==
During her fourth war patrol (21 January – 18 March 1943), &quot;Grouper&quot; rescued an aviator who had been stranded on Rengi Island, near Rob Roy Island in the Solomons, for several days; she also located several key Japanese radar installations in the Solomon Islands. On 4 February 1943, she penetrated between the two columns of a Japanese convoy and had just achieved a firing solution on a destroyer at a range of when Allied aircraft arrived and began bombing the convoy, both prompting her target to make a radical course change that spoiled her attack and endangering &quot;Grouper&quot; herself. Japanese aircraft intervened, resulting in a large dogfight over &quot;Grouper&quot;&#x27;s position. With the Japanese ships and aircraft on high alert, &quot;Grouper&quot; went deep and lost her opportunity to attack the convoy.

&quot;Grouper&quot;&#x27;s next four patrols netted her no further kills, despite several determined attacks, but the patrols illustrated the varied tasks submarines took on during the war. In addition to her regular patrol duties, which harassed Japanese shipping and tied up valuable warships desperately needed by the enemy, &quot;Grouper&quot; landed 50 men and of gear on New Britain to carry on guerrilla warfare; at the same time, she rescued an American aviator who had been stranded there almost three months.

On 30 July 1943, a United States Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell bomber mistakenly attacked &quot;Grouper&quot; in the Coral Sea, east of Rossel Island at . She crash-dived to a depth of , but the B-25 dropped two depth charges which exploded as she passed a depth of , inflicting enough damage that she was forced to terminate her patrol and head for Brisbane. She reached Brisbane on 3 August 1943 and went alongside the submarine tender for repairs.

At the conclusion of her eighth patrol, &quot;Grouper&quot; headed for the United States and overhaul, reaching San Francisco on 19 October 1943.

== 1944 ==
After returning to Pearl Harbor on 7 January 1944 for additional repairs, the veteran submarine sailed for her ninth war patrol on 22 May. This patrol netted &quot;Grouper&quot; what was to be her last kill of the war, &quot;Kumanoyama Maru&quot;, which she sank in a night surface attack on 24 June. &quot;Grouper&quot; final three war patrols found a lack of targets; American submarines had done their job on Japanese shipping too well for &quot;Grouper&quot; purposes. She stood lifeguard duty during several air strikes and rescued seven downed aviators during raids on the Palaus in September 1944.

== 1945–1949 ==
Returning to Pearl Harbor from her 12th and last war patrol on 26 April 1945, &quot;Grouper&quot; sailed the following day for San Francisco and overhaul. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 August, but V-J Day cancelled plans for another patrol, and on 9 September, &quot;Grouper&quot;, in company with and , sailed for New London. Four years of local operations and training exercises along the coast to Florida and in the Caribbean followed for &quot;Grouper&quot;. During this period, she chalked up two &quot;firsts&quot;: in 1946 she became the first submarine to have a Combat Information Center installed,
and the following year she effected the first discharge and recovery of men from a submerged and underway submarine.

== 1950–1957 ==
These operations ended 5 March 1950 as &quot;Grouper&quot; entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for conversion under project SCB 58 to the Navy&#x27;s first &quot;hunter-killer submarine&quot;. Her classification was changed to SSK-214 on 2 January 1951. With the addition of a snorkel and extensive sonar and radar facilities, &quot;Grouper&quot; emerged from the yard on 27 June 1951 to pioneer in research on the deadly submarine-versus-submarine warfare. For the next eight years, as a unit of Submarine Development Group 2, &quot;Grouper&quot; worked to develop and test concepts of hunter-killer antisubmarine warfare. In this duty, she ranged along the East Coast from Nova Scotia to Florida, as well as participating in Caribbean exercises. In 1953 and 1955, exercises took &quot;Grouper&quot; across the Atlantic to Rothesay, via Iceland. In the fall of 1957, she then participated in NATO maneuvers.

== 1958–1962 ==

&quot;Grouper&quot; was reclassified AGSS-214, 17 May 1958, and on 28 November 1959 she entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for extensive modification. Her forward torpedo room was converted into a floating laboratory; work benches and additional berths for scientists were installed, and various types of sonar gear were added topside. Thus equipped, &quot;Grouper&quot; departed Portsmouth on 23 June 1960 to embark on the fourth phase of her long career, research vessel for the Naval Research and Underwater Sound Laboratories. Her duties as a floating laboratory took her frequently to the Caribbean and Bermuda, although she retained New London as her home port and engaged in operations there and as far north as Nova Scotia. Her efforts were focused on the study of sound propagation in water. In December 1962, &quot;Grouper&quot; entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for overhaul and modification to prepare for further work in this field. &quot;Grouper&quot; left the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in May 1963 to resume her investigation of waterborne sound.

== 1964–1968 ==
In June 1964, &quot;Grouper&quot; was awarded the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot;. In November 1965, the submarine again entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for overhaul and equipment modifications to increase her usefulness as a floating underwater sound laboratory. She departed Philadelphia on 1 May 1966, reached New London on 1 June, and headed for the Caribbean for intensive research. Her studies during 1966 also took her to Narragansett Bay and twice to Bermuda. At the beginning of 1967, &quot;Grouper&quot; was at New London preparing to resume gathering knowledge of underwater sound propagation.

Up until the end of 1968, &quot;Grouper&quot; was still adding accomplishments as a floating laboratory to her long and outstanding record during both war and peace.

In May 1965 &quot;Grouper&quot; surpassed the record previously held by for serving the longest as the oldest submarine in the U.S. Navy.

&quot;Grouper&quot; was decommissioned and stricken on 2 December 1968. On 11 August 1970, she was sold for scrapping.

<doc id="1069187" wikidata="Q681340" url="?curid=1069187" title="Ciudad Obregón">
<text>Ciudad Obregón is a city in southern Sonora. It is the state&#x27;s second largest city after Hermosillo and serves as the municipal seat of Cajeme. As of 2020, the city has a population of 436,484. Ciudad Obregón is south of the state&#x27;s northern border.

== History ==
The city, previously named Cajeme, takes its name from Mexican Revolutionary Álvaro Obregón, a native of nearby Huatabampo, Sonora. Álvaro Obregón became president of Mexico after the Revolution and initiated an &quot;agricultural revolution&quot; in the Yaqui Valley, introducing modern agricultural techniques and making this valley one of the most prosperous agricultural regions in the country. Renowned US agronomist Norman Borlaug, the architect of the &quot;Green Revolution&quot; worked here after successful developments in increasing the resistance of wheat. For his efforts he was later awarded the Nobel Prize.
The origins of this city date back to the year 1906 when the company&#x27;s rail track South Pacific Railway reached this area of the Yaqui Valley; this route, made it possible to incorporate with the Mayo Valley to the domestic and external market, attracting a wave of investors and settlers who brought out populations.

In 1907, a flag station was established for the locomotive crossing the state to supply water, this station was called Cajeme. Cajemé was a Yaqui leader (whose population lives in this area) who fought against them as part of the Porfyrian army; and then led the Yaqui rebellion against it Porfirio Díaz.

&quot;The Cajeme station was run by the American Bert Cameron, superintendent, and Emilio Estrella, station manager. They and their families were the first settlers. Soon after, the cowboys arrived to guard the corrals of cattle that from here was sent to other regions. Soon came neighbors of Hope, near the fields cultivated in the Valley.&quot; The Yaquis offered resistance to the arrival of the first settlers on their lands.

The first neighborhood was called &quot;Plano Oriente&quot;. In 1923, &#x27;Cajeme Motors&#x27; was installed, owned by American James Huffaker, it was the first auto agency; fact that contributed significantly to the development of Cajeme. At the end of his term as president of the country (1920–1924), the General Alvaro Obregón returned to Sonora and carried out business projects in Navojoa and Cajeme, creating in 1925, the company &#x27;Obregón y Cía.&#x27;, which provided more work and economic development in the Region.
On 29 November 1927, Cajeme was declared the head of the municipality (until then it had been part of Cocorit) by the governor Fausto Topete, and in 1928 year in which the first town hall was installed, it was decreed on 28 July of the same year on 28 July of the same year change of name to Ciudad Obregón in recognition of Alvaro Obregón, while the name of the municipality was preserved. That same year the first printing press was installed and it was where the first news weekly called &#x27;The Pacific Gazette&#x27;, owned by Lithuanian immigrant Leo Rosenfeld and his wife Virginia Gámez, was printed.

The first neighborhoods were Plano Oriente, Ladrillera, Cumuripa, Hidalgo, Constitución, El Castillo, Quinta Díaz, Bella Vista and Colonia del Valle.

Rice was the most important crop in the Yaqui Valley in the early [twentieth century]; other crops also include wheat, beans, chickpeas, various vegetables and alfalfa. Over the course of the century, wheat became the most important crop. Due to Cajeme&#x27;s agricultural vocation, the first industry of great importance was rice mills.

In the 1950s the agronomist Norman E. Borlaug (called the Father of the Green Revolution) collaborated with the creation of the Northwest Agricultural Research Center (CIANO) and in 1970 received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in research developing better varieties of wheat and maize. Then &quot;El Valle Del Yaqui&quot; was called,&quot;The Barn Of Mexico.&quot;

At the end of the twentieth century the railway disappeared as a means of transport for passengers and the station was abandoned.

For the development of productive activities, local commerce offers everything from re-shareholders, agricultural implement stores, agribusiness machinery, safety equipment and all kinds of inputs for production. There are two markets for supplies.
