<text>The military history of Portugal is as long as the history of the country, from before the emergence of the independent Portuguese state.

==Before Portugal==
Before the emergence of Portugal, between the 9th and the 12th centuries, its territory was part of important military conflicts – these were mainly the result of three processes.

===Roman expansion===
* The conflict between Ancient Rome and Carthage for the dominion of the western Mediterranean sea mainly occurred in Iberia (the Roman Hispania) during the Second Punic War from 218 to 201 BC.

* The Roman conquest of Hispania, a long process from 218 BC (in the context of the Second Punic War) to 17 BC (already during Emperor Augustus), had three major confrontations regarding modern Portuguese territory:
** The Lusitanian War from 155 to 139 BC, between the Romans and the Lusitanians, namely during the period these were led by Viriatus.
** The expedition and conquest of Gallaecia (north of Portugal and Galicia), from 135 and 132 BC, led by Consul Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus.
** The Cantabrian Wars from 29 to 19 BC, in the last stade of Roman conquest, that, although not directed at populations in the present Portuguese territory, greatly involved military movements in what is now the north of Portugal.
* The Roman republican civil wars that took place, wholly or partially, in Hispania, even if in interaction and connection to the process of conquest, namely:
** Sertorius&#x27; revolt in Hispania, from 83 to 72 BC, under the leadership of Sertorius.
** Caesar&#x27;s Civil War, from 49 to 45 BC, between Julius Caesar and the optimates (conservative republicans), initially led by Pompey.

===Germanic expansion===
The invasions during the Migration Period and the Decline of the Roman Empire, in the beginning of the 5th century, and the subsequent conflicts between conquerors (until the 8th century), namely:
* Invasion of Roman Gallaecia by the Germanic Suebi (Quadi and Marcomanni) under king Hermeric, accompanied by the Buri in 409.
* Invasion of Hispania by the Germanic Vandals (Silingi – established in Baetica, and Hasdingi – established in interior Gallaecia, near the Suebi) and the Sarmatian Alans (established in Roman Lusitania), in 409.
* Invasion of Hispania by the Germanic Visigoths led by King Theodoric, expanding from Aquitaine and under request by the Romans, in 410, establishing the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania.
* The war between The Suevi and the Hasdingi Vandals, where the first resisted with Roman aid, in 419.
* The war between the Alans and the Suevi and Romans where the last two are defeated at the Battle of Mérida, in 428.
* The war between the Visigoths and the Vandal–Alanic alliance, that ended in 429, with most of the Vandals and Alans moving to North Africa.
* The on and off continuous dynastic disputes between the Suevi.
* The on and off continuous war between the Suevi and the Visigoths, that ended when the Visigothic king, Liuvigild, conquered the Kingdom of the Suebi in 585.
* The war between the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania and the Byzantine Empire in its southern Iberian province of Spania, from 552 until 624.
* The dynastic and civil war in the Visigothic Kingdom between the supporters of Achila II (controlling most of eastern Hispania) and Roderic (controlling most of western Iberia).

===Islamic expansion and Christian standoff===
* The Moorish Umayyad conquest of Hispania, from 711 to 718, taking advantage of the civil war, and that established the Islamic Al-Andalus.
* The Reconquista started as an insurgency in Asturias in 722. Currently Historians and archaeologists generally agree that Northern Portugal, between the Minho and the Douro rivers, kept a significant share of its population, in social and political Christian area that until the late 9th century there were no acting political powers. However, in late 9th century, the region is part of a structure of powers, the Galician–Asturian, Leonese and Portuguese power structures. The county of Portugal slowly grew in power and territory forming a separate Kingdom of Portugal which expanded at the expense of the Moorish states of Al-Andalus, finishing its Reconquista in 1249.

==Portuguese Reconquista (868–1249)==
=== County of Portugal and Kingdom of Portugal and Galicia ===
The county of Portugal slowly grew in power and its counts started to style themselves as dukes, one of which became regent of the Kingdom of León between 999 and 1008. In 1070, the Portuguese count Nuno Mendes wished the Portuguese title and the Battle of Pedroso was fought on 18 February 1071, the count was killed in combat led by Garcia II of Galicia. The later annexed the county and started to styled himself as &quot;King of Portugal and Galicia&quot; (&quot;Garcia Rex Portugallie et Galleciae&quot;). Garcia&#x27;s brothers Sancho II of Castille and Alfonso VI of Leon united and annexed Garcia&#x27;s Kingdom during that same year who agreed to split it among themselves, however the king of Castille was killed by a noble in that same year and Alfonso took Castille for himself and Garcia recovered his kingdom of Portugal and Galicia, but in 1073 the Alfonso VI gathered all power and started to style himself as &quot;Imperator totius Hispaniæ&quot; (Emperor of All Hispania) since 1077. When the Emperor died, the Crown was left for his daughter Urraca, while Teresa inherited the County of Portugal.

==The Napoleonic Wars==
===War of the Oranges (1801)===
===Instability prior to the French invasions===
====Riots of Campo de Ourique and conspiracy of the Marquis of Alorna (1803)====
On 24 and 25 July 1803, in Campo de Ourique, Lisbon, a regiment of infantry commanded by liberal army man Gomes Freire de Andrade and the Legion of Light Troops commanded by the also liberal-leaning Marquis of Alorna mutinied against the state authorities, entering in confrontation with the then recently created Royal Guard of the Police. The end of the mutinies, of forcing political liberalism on Portuguese government, did not succeed.

====Conspiracy of Mafra (1805)====
In 1805, then Princess regent (soon afterwards Queen) Carlota Joaquina promoted a conspiracy in Mafra with the objective of removing her husband Prince João from regency by claiming him to be mentally incapable, assuming regency on her own in his place, being aided in the attempted coup by the Count of Sabugal, the Marquis of Ponte de Lima, the Count of Sarzedas, the Marquis of Alorna and Francisco de Melo. The attempted conspiracy did not succeed, but it did increase the tension between the couple to the point of a divorce or separation being considered, which was never advanced due to the damage that it would bring to the Portuguese state, and the couple still had two children after the attempted conspiracy of Carlota (Maria da Assunção, born in 1805, and Ana de Jesus Maria, born in 1806), although there are suspicions about the possibility of the four children of the couple born after 1801, including the 1802-born Miguel, were not children of João but of one or several of the lovers of Carlota Joaquina).

====Riots of Saint Torcato (1805)====
The riots of Saint Torcato was a popular uprising in the Portuguese country side with a strong mixture of religious influence and zealotry.

===Peninsular War (1807–14)===
====First invasion====
During the Napoleonic Wars, Portugal was, for a time, Britain&#x27;s only ally on the continent. Throughout the war, Portugal maintained a military of about 200–250 thousand troops worldwide. In 1807, after the Portuguese government&#x27;s refusal to participate in the Continental System, French troops under General Junot invaded Portugal, taking Lisbon. However, a popular revolt against Junot&#x27;s government broke out in the summer of 1808 and Portuguese irregulars took up arms against the French. This enabled a British army under Arthur Wellesley to be landed in Portugal where, aided by Portuguese troops, they defeated Junot at the Battle of Vimeiro; this first French invasion was ended by the Convention of Sintra negotiated by his superiors, which allowed Junot&#x27;s men to withdraw unmolested with their plunder. Meanwhile, the general revolt against the French in Spain led to the landing of Sir John Moore in the north of that country, forcing Napoleon himself to lead an army into the Peninsula. Though Moore was killed, the British managed to extricate themselves from the Peninsula in the Battle of La Coruña. Portugal itself, however, remained independent of the French, and Napoleon left things in the Iberian Peninsula in the hands of Marshal Soult.

====Second and third invasions====
Soult proceeded to invade Portugal in the north. However, the Portuguese held on, giving the British the impetus to send Wellesley back with additional regiments of troops to help recover the Iberian peninsula. Wellesley, aided by the remaining Portuguese regiments hastily scraped together, liberated Portugal. A third invasion took place, led by Marshal André Masséna. The Anglo-Portuguese Army managed to halt the French advance at the fortifications of Torres Vedras and successfully defeat Masséna&#x27;s troops, and slowly recovered the Iberian peninsula. Wellesley was made Duke of Wellington in recognition of his services. The Portuguese army was put under the command of Marshal Beresford and was most heavily engaged under his leadership in the bloody Battle of Albuera. Portuguese forces also formed part of Wellington&#x27;s advance into southern France, in 1813–14.

====Persecutions of the &quot;Setembrizada&quot; (1810)====
The Setembrizada was the arrest and deportation of a group of personalities connected to the Portuguese Freemasonry, Jacobinist currents and following of the ideals of the French Revolution who had collaborated with the French occupation during the First Invasion, with the first detentions occurring between 10 and 13 September 1810 (hence the name &quot;setembrizada&quot;), after the entry of the Second Invasion led by general Jean-de-Dieu Soult. By 1814, King João VI gave an amnesty to all the former collaborationists.

====British &quot;de facto&quot; occupation====
====Conspiracy of Gomes Freire (1817)====

==Civil Wars (1820–51)==
===Liberal Revolution (1820)===
====&quot;Martinhada&quot; (1820)====
On 11 November 1820 (day of St. Martin, hence the name of the revolt, also known in slang as &quot;o imbróglio&quot;, &quot;the plot&quot; or &quot;a pavorosa&quot;, &quot;the dreadful one&quot;), a group of military leaders known as &quot;exaltados&quot; (exalted ones), who challenged the civilian rule in which the 1820 liberal Provisional Junta of Supreme Government of the Kingdom was falling and also what they considered to be the moderate proposals of a constitutional being drawn under influence of the liberal orator Manuel Fernandes Tomás, defending instead the immediate adoption of the Cádiz Constitution or even a more advanced liberal one. These groups rose up in a paradoxical wide informal coalition with conservative military and politicians and radical bourgeois people. It had a brief success, but by 17 November that year a counter-coup restores Manuel Fernandes to leadership of the Junta, forcing some Martinhada leaders, like Gaspar Teixeira de Magalhães e Lacerda, António da Silveira Pinto da Fonseca and Bernardo de Sá Nogueira, forced to exile, and only the sections of the Constitution relating to electoral instructions are adopted, at 22 November 1820, with the first elections after the 1820 Revolution (the elections for the General Extraordinary and Constituting Courts, that is, the Constitution writing constituting assembly) occurring under those instructions between 10 and 27 December 1820.

====Riots of 1821====
=====Conspiracy of Major Pimenta (1821)=====

====Conspiracy of &quot;Formosa&quot; street (1822)====
====Riots of the 24th and 10th Infantry Regiments (1822)====
====Riots in Castelo Branco and S. Miguel d&#x27;Acha (1822)====

===Saldanha&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; (1822)===
====Rebellion of the Count of Amarante (1823)====

===The &quot;Vilafrancada&quot; (1823)===
The &quot;Vilafrancada&quot; was the first of two uprisings of Prince D. Miguel&#x27;s uprisings supported by several other people of traditionalist and absolutist leanings, against the liberalism adopted by his father D. João VI in the later phase of his rule.

====Conspiracy of Elvas (1823)====

===The &quot;Abrilada&quot; (1824)===
On 30 April 1824, Prince D. Miguel rose again against his father. The King took refuge aboard the British ship Windsor Castle, with the aid of the Portuguese diplomatic corp, while grandes of the kingdom like the Duke of Palmela were arrested in Belém, being then moved to imprisonment in Peniche, with the then intendent-general of police Baron of Rendufe being persecuted by the Miguelist rise-up, which then turned its attentions to the Count of Vila Flor (later more famous for his future title of Duke of Terceira) and the Count of Paraty. The reactionary philosopher José Agostinho de Macedo was one of the leaders of the rallying up of support among the masses for the movement, denouncing the prisoners the movement made at political rallies. On 13 May, D. Miguel was finally forced to leave for exile on board the frigate Pérola towards France, while on the following day D. João returned to Bemposta, and impeached the brutal pro-Miguelist Minister of Justice José António de Oliveira Leite de Barros, replacing him by Friar Patrício da Silva, and the Duke of Palmela was promoted to Minister of the Kingdom.

===Disturbances of 1826–27===
* Riots of Trás-os-Montes
* Sublevation of the Royal Police Guard
* Rebellion of Algarve and Alentejo
* Archotada
* Miguelite riots in Coimbra

===The Liberal Wars (1828–34)===

After the Napoleonic War, the British ruled Portugal in the name of the absent king in Brazil, with Beresford as de facto Regent, until the Liberal Revolution of 1820 when they were driven out and the king was forced to return as a constitutional monarch. Over the next 25 years the fledgling Portuguese democracy experienced several military upheavals, especially the Liberal Wars fought between the brothers Dom Pedro, ex-Emperor of Brazil and the absolutist usurper Dom Miguel. To assert the cause of the rightful Queen, his daughter Maria da Glória, Pedro sailed from Terceira in the Azores with an expeditionary force consisting of 60 vessels, 7500 men including the Count of Vila Flor, Alexandre Herculano, Almeida Garrett, Joaquim António de Aguiar, José Travassos Valdez and a volunteer British contingent under the command of Colonels George Lloyd Hodges and Charles Shaw and effected a Landing at Mindelo on the shores north of Porto. On 9 July Porto was taken by the liberal forces, and after an inconclusive result at the Battle of Ponte Ferreira on 22–23 July were besieged in the city by the Miguelites for nearly a year until, in July 1833, the Duke of Terceira (as Vila Flor had now been created) was able to land in the Algarve and defeat Miguel&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Almada. Meanwhile, Miguel&#x27;s fleet was comprehensively defeated by Pedro&#x27;s much smaller squadron, commanded by Charles Napier, in the fourth Battle of Cape St. Vincent. The Miguelites were driven out of Lisbon but returned and attacked the city in force, unsuccessfully. Miguel was finally defeated at the Battle of Asseiceira, 16 May 1834, and capitulated a few days later with the Concession of Evoramonte. He was exiled, though his supporters continued to plot for his return and cause trouble up to the 1850s.

====Other guerrillas====
In the period of instability after the end of the Portuguese Civil War, several guerrillas happened between pro-governmental and anti-governmental local groups and between local groups and government forces, both by forces of the defeated Miguelites who kept the guerrillas and between different factions of Portuguese liberals. Among these were included:
* Guerrilla of Jorge Boto (a Miguelite guerrilla in the Beira Alta region just after the end of the Civil War and also in the last years of given war)
* Guerrilla of Dom Manuel Martinini (a liberal guerrilla in the last days of the Civil War and first years right after its end led by a former Spanish Army officer around Marvão, Alentejo

====&quot;Montaria&quot; (1847)====
A failed badly planned attempt of revolt against the government in the afternoon of 29 April 1847, which ended with the imprisonment of several of the involved members.

====Conspiracy of the Hidras (1848)====
A conspiratorial movement in Lisbon and Coimbra in August 1848, inspired by the popular and students&#x27; uprising of Paris from 22 to 24 February 1848 (which led to the fall of King Louis Philippe I and the proclamation of the Second Republic). It was controlled by the government of the Duke of Saldanha (with detaining of some of the heads of the conspiracy, the remaining ones falling in clandestinity), with the name by which the conspiracy became known deriving from the term used by Saldanha to define the organization (&quot;revolutionary hydra&quot;)

===&quot;Coup&quot; of the &quot;Regeneração&quot; (1851)===

==Colonization of Africa==

In the 19th century, Portugal became involved in the scramble for Africa, enlarging its territories in Portuguese Angola, Portuguese Mozambique, Portuguese Cabinda, and Portuguese Guinea.

===British Ultimatum (1890)===
==&quot;Coup&quot; attempts during the last stages of the monarchy==
===Republican insurrection of 1881===
===Regicide of 1908===

After the revolution that would establish the First Portuguese Republic, the Republic would suffer many &quot;coup&quot; attempts, see Portugal enter World War I and end 16 years later with the 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état.

===Revolution of 1910===
===Military instability before World War I===

====German incursions in Mozambique (1914)====
Before the beginning of World War I, Germany already had interests in Portuguese African colonies and had negotiated with the British the possibility of annexation of Angola. German troops fought Portuguese ones in the Maziua raid in Mozambique, August 1914. In October of the same year, the Naulila Incident happened in Angola, which then culminated in the Battle of Naulila and the German campaign in Angola. These events happened while Portugal and Germany were officially at peace.

===World War I (1916–18)===
Portugal entered WWI on the 9th of March 1916, after Germany declared war on Portugal, following Portugal&#x27;s compliance with a British request to confiscate German ships in Portuguese ports. On 15 July of the same year, Portugal is formally invited by the British to join the Allies and on August 7 the Portuguese Parliament accepts Portugal&#x27;s participation in the war. In December 1916, there are naval confrontations near Funchal. Naval confrontations in the Atlantic, which include sporadic bombardment of land in Madeira and Azores, continue throughout the war, with the last notable event being the Action of 14 October 1918.

==== Mainland Europe (1917–18) ====
Portugal sent an Expeditionary Corps of two reinforced divisions (40,000 men) to France and Belgium, which fought alongside the British XI Corps. German offensives in the British sector hit the Portuguese hard, with one division destroyed on 9 April 1918 in the Battle of La Lys, as it became known in Portugal, or Operation Georgette or the Battle of Estaires to the British. In the Treaty of Versailles, the Portuguese acquired the territory of Kionga from what was once German East Africa.

====German incursions in Mozambique (1917)====
A raid by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s remaining troops evaded British troops and managed to penetrate relatively far into Portuguese Mozambique, seizing arms, capturing troops, and sparking unrest among the population (African and European). The German forces met Portuguese ones in the Battle of Ngomano, where Portuguese forces were defeated.

===Military instability and &quot;coup&quot;s during and after World War I===


==Estado Novo (1926–74)==
===28 May 1926 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;===
===Military dictatorship (1926–33)===
===Involvement in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39)===

Salazar gave material and diplomatic aid to Francisco Franco&#x27;s nationalist forces while maintaining a formal neutrality. A special volunteer force of 18,000, called &quot;Os Viriatos&quot; (in honour of Lusitanian leader and Portuguese national hero Viriatus), led by regular army officers, was recruited to fight as part of Franco&#x27;s army, even if unofficially. When the civil war ended in 1939, Portugal and Spain negotiated the Treaty of Friendship and Nonaggression (Iberian Pact). The pact committed the two countries to defend the Iberian Peninsula against any power that attacked either country and helped to ensure Iberian neutrality during World War II.

===World War II (1939–45)===
Although Portugal proclaimed neutrality in the conflict, the Japanese Imperial Army invaded the Portuguese Timor colony in distant Oceania, killing thousands of natives and dozens of Portuguese. In response, the Portuguese civilians joined Australia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States against the Japanese. See Battle of Timor.

===NATO===
====Parachuters (1956)====
===Portuguese–Indian War (1961)===

The Portuguese–Indian War was a conflict with the Republic of India&#x27;s armed forces that ended Portuguese rule in its Indian enclaves in 1961. The armed action involved defensive action against air, sea and land strikes by a numerically superior Indian force for over 36 hours, and terminated in Portuguese surrender, ending 451 years of Portuguese rule in Goa. Thirty-one Portuguese and thirty-five Indians were killed in the fighting.

===Portuguese Colonial War (1961–74)===

Portugal remained steadfastly neutral in World War II, but became involved in counterinsurgency campaigns against scattered guerrilla movements in Portuguese Angola, Portuguese Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea. Except in Portuguese Guinea, where the revolutionary PAIGC quickly conquered most of the country, Portugal was able to easily contain anti-government forces through the imaginative use of light infantry, home defense militia, and air-mobile special operations forces, despite arms embargoes from other European countries. During the counterinsurgency campaigns in Angola and Mozambique, Portugal was significantly aided by intelligence provided by native residents who did not support revolutionary forces. However, the ideology of the guerrillas, especially the PAIGC, had a profound impact on the officers of the Portuguese armed forces and a left-wing military coup in Lisbon by Portuguese military officers in 1974 toppled the Caetano government and forced a radical change in government attitudes. Faced with international condemnation of its colonial policies and the increasing cost of administering its colonies, Portugal quickly moved to grant the remainder of its African colonies independence.

====Commandos (1961)====

===Military &quot;coup&quot; attempts===

==Carnation Revolution (1974)==
===The &quot;hot&quot; years of the revolution (1974–75)===

==International involvement (1991 to present)==
Portugal was a founding member of NATO, and, although it had scarce forces, it played a key role in the European approaches. After 1991, Portugal committed several infantry and air-landing battalions to international operations. The Portuguese Army keeps soldiers in Iraq, Jordan, Mali, Central African Republic, Somalia, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, Kosovo and Baltic states.

<text>Berberis (), commonly known as barberry, is a large genus of deciduous and evergreen shrubs from tall, found throughout temperate and subtropical regions of the world (apart from Australia). Species diversity is greatest in South America and Asia; Europe, Africa and North America have native species as well. The best-known &quot;Berberis&quot; species is the European barberry, &quot;Berberis vulgaris&quot;, which is common in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and central Asia, and has been widely introduced in North America. Many of the species have spines on the shoots and all along the margins of the leaves.

==Description==
The genus &quot;Berberis&quot; has dimorphic shoots: long shoots which form the structure of the plant, and short shoots only long. The leaves on long shoots are non-photosynthetic, developed into one to three or more spines long. The bud in the axil of each thorn-leaf then develops a short shoot with several normal, photosynthetic leaves. These leaves are long, simple, and either entire, or with spiny margins. Only on young seedlings do leaves develop on the long shoots, with the adult foliage style developing after the young plant is 1–2 years old.

Many deciduous species, such as &quot;Berberis thunbergii and B. vulgaris&quot;, are noted for their attractive pink or red autumn colour. In some evergreen species from China, such as &quot;B. candidula and B. verruculosa&quot;, the undersides of the leaves are brilliant white, a feature valued horticulturally. Some horticultural variants of &quot;B. thunbergii&quot; have dark red to violet foliage. Such as &quot;B. thunbergii&quot; f. &quot;atropurpurea&quot; &#x27;Admiration&#x27;, and &quot;B. thunbergii&quot; f. &quot;atropurpurea&quot; &#x27;Atropurpurea Nana&#x27;.

The flowers are produced singly or in racemes of up to 20 on a single flower-head. They are yellow or orange, long, sepals are usually six, rarely three or nine and there are six petals in alternating whorls of three, the sepals usually coloured like the petals. The fruit is a small berry long, ripening red or dark blue, often with a pink or violet waxy surface bloom; in some species, they may be long and narrow, but are spherical in other species.

Some authors regard the compound-leaved species as belonging to a different genus, &quot;Mahonia&quot;. There are no consistent differences between the two groups other than the leaf pinnation (&quot;Berberis sensu stricto&quot; appear to have simple leaves, but these are in reality compound with a single leaflet; they are termed &quot;unifoliolate&quot;), and many botanists prefer to classify all these plants in the single genus &quot;Berberis&quot;. However, a recent DNA-based phylogenetic study retains the two separate genera, by clarifying that unifoliolate-leaved &quot;Berberis s.s.&quot; is derived from within a paraphyletic group of shrubs bearing imparipinnate evergreen leaves, which the paper then divides into three genera: &quot;Mahonia&quot;, &quot;Alloberberis&quot; (formerly &quot;Mahonia&quot; section &quot;Horridae&quot;), and &quot;Moranothamnus&quot; (formerly &quot;Berberis claireae&quot;); it confirms that a broadly-circumscribed &quot;Berberis&quot; (that is, including &quot;Mahonia&quot;, &quot;Alloberberis&quot;, and &quot;Moranothamnus&quot;) is monophyletic.
==Ecology==
&quot;Berberis&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the moths barberry carpet moth (&quot;Pareulype berberata&quot;), and mottled pug (&quot;Eupithecia exiguata&quot;).

&quot;Berberis&quot; species can infect wheat with stem rust, a serious fungal disease of wheat and related grains. &quot;Berberis vulgaris&quot; (European barberry) and &quot;Berberis canadensis&quot; (American barberry) serve as alternate host species of the rust fungus responsible, the fungus &quot;(Puccinia graminis)&quot;. For this reason, cultivation of &quot;B. vulgaris&quot; is prohibited in many areas, and imports to the United States are forbidden. The North American &quot;B. canadensis&quot;, native to Appalachia and the Midwest United States, was nearly eradicated for this reason, and is now rarely seen extant, with the most remaining occurrences in the Virginia mountains.

Some &quot;Berberis&quot; species have become invasive when planted outside of their native ranges, including &quot;B. glaucocarpa&quot; and &quot;B. darwinii&quot; in New Zealand (where it is now banned from sale and propagation), and &quot;B. vulgaris&quot; and green-leaved &quot;B. thunbergii&quot; in much of the eastern United States.

Japanese barberry is considered an invasive plant in 32 US states. It is deer-resistant because of its taste and is favoured as a shelter for ticks capable of transmitting lyme disease.

==Cultivation==

Several species of &quot;Berberis&quot; are popular garden shrubs, grown for such features as ornamental leaves, yellow flowers, or red or blue-black berries. Numerous cultivars and hybrids have been selected for garden use. Low-growing &quot;Berberis&quot; plants are also commonly planted as pedestrian barriers. Taller-growing species are valued for crime prevention; being dense and viciously spiny, they are effective barriers to burglars. Thus they are often planted below vulnerable windows, and used as hedges. Many species are resistant to predation by deer.

Species in cultivation include:
* &quot;B. darwinii&quot;
* &quot;B. dictyophylla&quot;
* &quot;B. julianae&quot;
* &quot;B. thunbergii&quot;
* &quot;B. verruculosa&quot;

The following hybrid selections have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
* &quot;B.&quot; &#x27;Georgei&#x27;
* &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;lologensis&quot; &#x27;Apricot Queen&#x27;
* &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;media&quot; &#x27;Red Jewel&#x27;

* &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;stenophylla&quot; &#x27;Corallina Compacta&#x27;
* &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;stenophylla&quot; (golden barberry)

==Uses==

=== Culinary ===

&quot;Berberis vulgaris&quot; grows in the wild in much of Europe and West Asia. It produces large crops of edible berries, rich in vitamin C, but with a sharp acid flavour. In Europe for many centuries the berries were used for culinary purposes much as citrus peel is used. Today in Europe they are very infrequently used. The country in which they are used the most is Iran, where they are referred to as &quot;zereshk&quot; () in Persian. The berries are common in Persian cuisine in dishes such as pilaf (&quot;zereshk polo&quot;) and as a flavouring for poultry. Because of their sour flavour, they are sometimes cooked with sugar before being added to Persian rice. Iranian markets sell dried zereshk. In Russia and Eastern Europe, it is sometimes used in jams as a source of pectin (especially with mixed berries). An extract of barberries is a common flavouring for soft drinks, candies, and sweets.

&quot;Berberis microphylla&quot; and &quot;B. darwinii&quot; (both known as &quot;calafate&quot; and &quot;michay&quot;) are two species found in Patagonia in Argentina and Chile. Their edible purple fruit are used for jams and infusions.

=== Traditional medicine ===
The dried fruit of &quot;Berberis vulgaris&quot; is used in herbal medicine. The chemical constituents include isoquinolone alkaloids, especially berberine. A full list of phytochemicals was compiled and published in 2014. The safety of using berberine for any condition is not adequately defined by high-quality clinical research. Its potential for causing adverse effects is high, including untoward interactions with prescription drugs, reducing the intended effect of established therapies. It is particularly unsafe for use in children.

=== Other uses ===
Historically, yellow dye was extracted from the stem, root, and bark.

The thorns of the barberry shrub have been used to clean ancient gold coins, as they are soft enough that they will not damage the surface but will remove corrosion and debris.

The acidic young leaves are sometimes chewed for refreshment by parched hikers.

<text>Coconut Grove station is a station on the Metrorail rapid transit system on the western end of the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, Florida. The station is located at the intersection of South Dixie Highway (US 1) and West 27th Avenue/Grapeland Boulevard (SR 9), opening to service on May 20, 1984.

In 2018, there were plans to make the station entirely solar-powered. The station has been closed since January 21, 2025 for renovations, and is expected to open again in spring of the same year.

==Station layout==
The station has two tracks served by an island platform. Immediately north of the platform lies a mixed-use development called Grove Central, with apartments, retail and a parking garage including parking specifically for the station.

<doc id="1052323" wikidata="Q928582" url="?curid=1052323" title="Sphere of influence (astrodynamics)">
<text>A sphere of influence (SOI) in astrodynamics and astronomy is the oblate spheroid-shaped region where a particular celestial body exerts the main gravitational influence on an orbiting object. This is usually used to describe the areas in the Solar System where planets dominate the orbits of surrounding objects such as moons, despite the presence of the much more massive but distant Sun. 

In the patched conic approximation, used in estimating the trajectories of bodies moving between the neighbourhoods of different bodies using a two-body approximation, ellipses and hyperbolae, the SOI is taken as the boundary where the trajectory switches which mass field it is influenced by. It is not to be confused with the sphere of activity which extends well beyond the sphere of influence.

== Models ==
The most common base models to calculate the sphere of influence is the Hill sphere and the Laplace sphere, but updated and particularly more dynamic ones have been described.
The general equation describing the radius of the sphere formula_1 of a planet:
formula_2
where
* formula_3 is the semimajor axis of the smaller object&#x27;s (usually a planet&#x27;s) orbit around the larger body (usually the Sun).
* formula_4 and formula_5 are the masses of the smaller and the larger object (usually a planet and the Sun), respectively.

In the patched conic approximation, once an object leaves the planet&#x27;s SOI, the primary/only gravitational influence is the Sun (until the object enters another body&#x27;s SOI). Because the definition of &quot;r&quot;SOI relies on the presence of the Sun and a planet, the term is only applicable in a three-body or greater system and requires the mass of the primary body to be much greater than the mass of the secondary body. This changes the three-body problem into a restricted two-body problem.

==Table of selected SOI radii==

The table shows the values of the sphere of gravity of the bodies of the solar system in relation to the Sun (with the exception of the Moon which is reported relative to Earth):
An important understanding to be drawn from this table is that &quot;Sphere of Influence&quot; here is &quot;Primary&quot;. For example, though Jupiter is much larger in mass than say, Neptune, its Primary SOI is much smaller due to Jupiter&#x27;s much closer proximity to the Sun.

==Increased accuracy on the SOI==
The Sphere of influence is, in fact, not quite a sphere. The distance to the SOI depends on the angular distance formula_6 from the massive body. A more accurate formula is given by
formula_7

Averaging over all possible directions we get:
formula_8

==Derivation==
Consider two point masses formula_9 and formula_10 at locations formula_11 and formula_12, with mass formula_13 and formula_14 respectively. The distance formula_15 separates the two objects. Given a massless third point formula_16 at location formula_17, one can ask whether to use a frame centered on formula_9 or on formula_10 to analyse the dynamics of formula_16.
Consider a frame centered on formula_21. The gravity of formula_22 is denoted as formula_23 and will be treated as a perturbation to the dynamics of formula_16 due to the gravity formula_25 of body formula_21. Due to their gravitational interactions, point formula_21 is attracted to point formula_22 with acceleration formula_29, this frame is therefore non-inertial. To quantify the effects of the perturbations in this frame, one should consider the ratio of the perturbations to the main body gravity i.e. formula_30. The perturbation formula_31 is also known as the tidal forces due to body formula_22. It is possible to construct the perturbation ratio formula_33 for the frame centered on formula_22 by interchanging formula_35.
As formula_16 gets close to formula_21, formula_38 and formula_39, and vice versa. The frame to choose is the one that has the smallest perturbation ratio. The surface for which formula_40 separates the two regions of influence. In general this region is rather complicated but in the case that one mass dominates the other, say formula_41, it is possible to approximate the separating surface. In such a case this surface must be close to the mass formula_21, denote formula_43 as the distance from formula_21 to the separating surface.

The distance to the sphere of influence must thus satisfy formula_45 and so formula_46 is the radius of the sphere of influence of body formula_21

==Gravity well==
Gravity well (or funnel) is a metaphorical concept for a gravitational field of a mass, with the field being curved in a funnel-shaped well around the mass, illustrating the steep gravitational potential and its energy that needs to be accounted for in order to escape or enter the main part of a sphere of influence.

<doc id="1052329" wikidata="Q84767939" url="?curid=1052329" title="Death of Lisa McPherson">
<text>Lisa McPherson (February 10, 1959 – December 5, 1995) was an American Scientologist who died in the care of the Church of Scientology in Clearwater, Florida. After a minor traffic accident where McPherson seemed unharmed, she removed her clothes in the street and paramedics transported her to a local hospital. In order to avoid psychiatric intervention, local Scientologists convinced her to leave the hospital and seek care at the nearby Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization (FSO). There she was held against her will for 17 days without any medical care, while her physical and mental condition rapidly deteriorated and she died. Following the report by the state medical examiner that indicated that McPherson was a victim of negligent homicide, FSO was indicted on two felony charges, &quot;abuse and/or neglect of a disabled adult&quot; and &quot;practicing medicine without a license.&quot; The charges were dropped after the state&#x27;s medical examiner changed the cause of death from &quot;undetermined&quot; to an &quot;accident&quot; on June 13, 2000. A civil suit brought by McPherson&#x27;s family was settled on May 28, 2004.

==Background==
In 1994, Lisa McPherson, who became a Scientology adherent at age 18, moved from Dallas, Texas, to Clearwater, Florida, with her employer, AMC Publishing, which was at that time owned by Bennetta Slaughter and operated and staffed primarily by Scientologists. During June 1995, the Church of Scientology placed McPherson in an &quot;Introspection Rundown&quot; due to perceived mental instability. McPherson completed the process, and she attested to the state of &quot;Clear&quot; in September.

On November 18, 1995, McPherson was involved in a minor car accident. Paramedics initially left her alone because she was ambulatory, but after she began to remove her clothes, the paramedics decided to take her to the hospital. McPherson remarked to the paramedics that she had taken off her clothes in hopes of obtaining counseling. Hospital staff agreed that she was unharmed, but recommended keeping her overnight for observation. Following intervention by fellow Scientologists, McPherson refused psychiatric observation or admission at the hospital and checked herself out after a short evaluation. Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Frank Quesada concluded:
McPherson was then taken to the Fort Harrison Hotel, also known as the Flag Land Base, where she was put under the care of staffers belonging to the Church&#x27;s Flag Service Organization (FSO). According to Scientology, McPherson was brought to the Fort Harrison Hotel for &quot;rest and relaxation&quot;. However, sworn statements demonstrate that she was brought there for another Introspection Rundown. Mark McGarry, an attorney with the Florida Office of the State Attorney, characterized McPherson&#x27;s care under the FSO as an &quot;isolation watch&quot;:
Scientology accommodated McPherson in a cabana and kept a &quot;24 hours&#x27; watch&quot; over her. Detailed logs were kept on her day-to-day care. These logs were handwritten on plain white paper. Most of these logs were kept, but the logs for the last three days were summarized from the originals and the originals were shredded. Brian J. Anderson, the then Commanding Officer of the Church&#x27;s Office of Special Affairs (OSA) in Clearwater, said in his sworn statement:

McPherson&#x27;s &quot;care logs&quot; narrate the last seventeen days of her life: she was incoherent and sometimes violent, her nails were cut so she would not scratch herself or the staff, and she bruised her fists and feet while hitting the wall. McPherson was given natural supplements and the drug chloral hydrate to help her sleep. A Church staffer noted that she &quot;looked ill like measles or chicken pox on her face.&quot; On repeated occasions, McPherson refused food and protein shakes that the staff offered. On November 26 and 30 and December 3 to 4, Church staff attempted to force feed her, noting that she spat the food out. McPherson was noted to be very weak, not standing up nor on some days moving at all. Scientologists who questioned this handling were told to &quot;butt out&quot;.

On December 5, 1995, Church staffers contacted David Minkoff, a Scientologist medical doctor who twice prescribed McPherson Valium and chloral hydrate without examining her. They requested for him to prescribe an antibiotic to McPherson because she seemed to have an infection. Minkoff refused, stating that she should be taken to a hospital and he needed to see her before prescribing anything. They objected, expressing fear that McPherson would be put under psychiatric care. Dr. Janice Johnson, a senior medical officer at the Fort Harrison Hotel who was assigned to care for McPherson, stated that she had been gasping and had labored breathing while en route. However, they passed a total of four hospitals along the way to their ultimate destination.

When they arrived at Minkoff&#x27;s hospital forty-five minutes north of Clearwater, McPherson exhibited no vital signs. Hospital staff attempted to resuscitate her for twenty minutes before declaring her dead.

Scientologists called McPherson&#x27;s family to say that she had died of meningitis or a blood clot while at the Fort Harrison Hotel for &quot;rest and relaxation&quot;. A suspicious death investigation began the next day and an autopsy was performed. One year later, in response to a Clearwater Police Department website request for information on her death, Clearwater media began speculating about the causes of McPherson&#x27;s death. Regular pickets have taken place outside Scientology offices on or around the anniversary of her death in the years since.

==Coroner&#x27;s report and review==

===First coroner&#x27;s report===
On December 5, 1995, McPherson&#x27;s autopsy was conducted by assistant medical examiner Robert Davis. Davis never completed McPherson&#x27;s autopsy report because he was asked to resign from his position. The report identified McPherson&#x27;s cause of death as a thromboembolism of the left pulmonary artery caused by &quot;bed rest and severe dehydration&quot;, ruling the manner of death as &quot;undetermined&quot;. The report also identified multiple bruises, an abrasion on the nose, lesions and insect bites that appeared consistent with that of a cockroach. The autopsy report was completed by Davis’s supervisor, medical examiner Joan Wood.

On January 21, 1997, Wood appeared on the news program &quot;Inside Edition&quot; and stated that the autopsy showed McPherson&#x27;s condition had deteriorated slowly, going without fluids for five to ten days, was underweight, had cockroach bites and was comatose from 24 to 48 hours before she died. Scientology&#x27;s legal team proceeded to sue Wood to gain access to her files; including tissue, organ and blood samples from McPherson&#x27;s body. The lawsuit argued that Wood waived any right to keep her records on the case closed when she spoke openly about the case with news reporters. Scientology alleged that the records were needed to start their legal defense. These records were previously denied to the Church because they were part of an ongoing criminal investigation.

===Independent opinion===
The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; contacted five medical experts for their opinions about the report, and they confirmed Wood&#x27;s opinion. Scientology responded that the five doctors should have been given the entire autopsy report, not just the vitreous fluid tests, which pathologists use to determine the composition of blood at the time before death.

===Scientology hired forensic pathologists===
Scientology hired its own team to oppose Wood&#x27;s findings, including two nationally known forensic pathologists: Dr. Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner for New York City; and Dr. Cyril Wecht, a county coroner from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Baden and Wecht concluded that McPherson died suddenly and unpredictably of a blood clot in her left lung that originated from a knee bruise she suffered in the minor car accident seventeen days earlier.

This scientific evidence was then sent to Wood for review. The scientific evidence sent to Wood included:
* Research on compounds known as ketones, which people produce when they are dehydrated, starving or even fasting. Tests of McPherson&#x27;s bodily fluids showed no ketones according to the pathologists.
* Findings from a body measurement expert hired by the church. The Church-hired expert compared autopsy photos of McPherson with those taken shortly before the accident. The expert concluded from the photographs there was &quot;no appreciable weight loss&quot;, countering the prosecution&#x27;s view that McPherson lost to while in Scientology&#x27;s care.
* A report by a Morton Plant Hospital doctor and Church officials who saw McPherson just before she entered the Fort Harrison Hotel, stating McPherson was already thin with protruding cheek bones.
* A report by Robert D. Davis, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy for Wood&#x27;s office, concluded McPherson&#x27;s body was of average nutritional status.
* Medical literature and sworn testimony gathered by the church that it says proves the eye fluid samples were improperly handled by Wood&#x27;s office, incompetently tested at an independent lab and ultimately contaminated.

The plaintiff&#x27;s response was that the chain of custody of evidence was not broken (also corroborated by assistant State Attorney Douglas Crow&#x27;s memo to State Attorney Bernie McCabe).

Due to the vitreous fluid tests, Baden and Wecht maintained that McPherson was dehydrated. Chemical pathologists Calvin Bandt and Werner Spitz concurred with the initial coroner&#x27;s report in their affidavits. Plaintiff witness Dr. Alan Wu also testified that ketones need not be present for dehydration in a special case like McPherson where she was fed proteins and therefore didn&#x27;t create measurable ketones. The plaintiffs maintained that McPherson did lose water weight to result in with respect to the vitreous fluid.

===Final coroner&#x27;s report===
In light of the new scientific evidence provided by Scientology, a review was mandated. The policy stated that the medical examiner will &quot;readdress key issues&quot; in a case if &quot;credible new evidence is presented, regardless of its source.&quot; After the review, Wood changed the cause of death from &quot;undetermined&quot; to an &quot;accident.&quot; Wood stated that McPherson&#x27;s psychosis and auto accident were major factors to the development of the fatal pulmonary embolism.

==Criminal case review==
Wood&#x27;s revised report caused the review and subsequent dismissal of the criminal case concerning McPherson&#x27;s death. The review was done by assistant State Attorney Douglas Crow and was outlined in the 31-page memo that he sent to State Attorney Bernie McCabe, with a recommendation to drop the criminal case against Scientology.

===The initial autopsy===
Crow stated that there were credibility issues with the original autopsy, including that Wood signed the autopsy herself, five months after Davis&#x27;s departure, she failed to examine tissue samples and did not consult clinical experts before reaching her conclusion. He also pointed out two other mistakes made by Wood, such as, she released the autopsy report on an active-criminal case and went public on national media.

===Robert Davis&#x27;s testimony===
Davis changed his testimony from a 1997 deposition given in the civil case to strongly disagree that McPherson was severely dehydrated. He also made a series of accusations against the Medical Examiner Office&#x27;s handling of the case and questioned its motive. Davis stated that Wood was not present during the autopsy and did not consult him when she signed the autopsy.

===Destruction of evidence===
Crow noted that Wood&#x27;s credibility would be attacked due to the Medical Examiner Office&#x27;s failure to follow its own policies; to preserve evidence, for the release of the body for cremation before a cause of death had been determined, and for the destruction of Davis’s autopsy notes.

===Wood&#x27;s explanation of the autopsy changes===
The primary reason Wood gave for changing her findings was her realization that the microscopic slides of the popliteal vein and the photographs of muscle tissue in the surrounding area provided evidence of trauma which could explain the thrombus formation. She could not explain why she had not seen this before. Crow was highly critical of Wood in his memo, stating:
Crow also mentioned a unique set of circumstances that put Wood under tremendous pressure and might have affected the quality of her judgment. These being:
# Wood&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Inside Edition&quot; left her more vulnerable to litigation and committed her to a forensic position that would make any modification professionally embarrassing.
# The fact that Davis, the forensic examiner that actually did the autopsy, was critical of her conclusions.
# The defense suggestion that if forced to litigate it would reveal information extremely damaging to Wood&#x27;s office and her career.

===Conclusion===
Crow concluded that even though there was probable cause, the actions and testimony of Wood had so muddied the facts that there wasn&#x27;t enough credible evidence to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, and recommended the dismissal of all charges.

==Timeline==
;1995
* December 5 – Lisa McPherson died while in the care of Flag Service Organization (FSO), a branch of the Church of Scientology.

;1997
* February 19 – McPherson&#x27;s family sued the Church of Scientology and the individuals involved for wrongful death, while the Church claimed it did nothing wrong toward McPherson.

;1998
* September 15 – Dr. David Minkoff settled his portion of the wrongful death suit by having his malpractice insurance pay $100,000 to the estate.
* November 13 – Scientology was indicted on two felony charges in McPherson&#x27;s death; abuse or neglect of a disabled adult, a second-degree felony, and unauthorized practice of medicine, a third-degree felony; the first criminal charges ever filed in the U.S. against Scientology. These charges were brought against Scientology as a corporation, not against any individuals, and the maximum penalty, had the charges been pursued and the Church found guilty, would have been a $15,000 fine plus costs.

;1999
* December 6 – Florida State Attorney Bernie McCabe presented a response to Scientology&#x27;s attempt to get the case dismissed.

;2000
* February 23 – Wood changed McPherson&#x27;s cause of death to an &quot;accident&quot;. &quot;Gone from the new report is the original reference to the bed rest and dehydration. Wood still traces the death to a blood clot behind McPherson&#x27;s knee. But she lists McPherson&#x27;s psychosis and a minor auto accident as major factors.&quot;
* March 8 – A group of more than 200 Scientologists moved to have the criminal case dismissed on the claim that it had &quot;chilled the religious rights of every Scientologist&quot; and that other Scientologists were now being treated with concern, suspicion or ridicule by non-Scientologists. A central point of the motion was that McPherson had undergone the Introspection Rundown, which the brief putting forth the motion called an &quot;entirely religious&quot; practice.
* April 4 – Scientology moved to have the entire criminal case dismissed. &quot;The entire basis for the state&#x27;s prosecution of this case has now collapsed,&quot; begins one of the many Scientology legal briefs arguing the case should be dismissed.
* June 12 – On the advice of Assistant State Attorney Douglas Crow, State Attorney Bernie McCabe dropped the criminal charges against the Church. According to a memo by Crow, medical examiner Joan Wood could not be counted on to confidently testify.

;2001
* August 3 – Minkoff had his license suspended for one year and was fined $10,000 for prescribing medicine to McPherson at the request of her FSO caretakers without having ever seen her.

;2002
* April 29 – Scientology accused McPherson attorney Ken Dandar of professional misconduct and perjury and tried to get him removed from the case.
* June 22 – Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Frank Quesada dismissed the count alleging that McPherson was falsely imprisoned on the McPherson&#x27;s civil suit.

;2003
* August – Scientology sued Dandar for breach of contract, for having added Church leader David Miscavige to the wrongful death lawsuit despite a mutual agreement not to add additional defendants. In a 2003 jury trial, Scientology asked for over $2 million in damages, but received only $4,500 in attorney fees and no punitive damages.

;2004
* May 28 – Under terms undisclosed to the public, the civil suit was settled out of court.

;2009
* June 22 – Mark Rathbun, a former member of Scientology, admitted that he had instructed the Church to destroy files related to the case.

;2012
* October 31 – Dandar filed a federal lawsuit against Scientology and its attorneys, asking for injunctive relief from the church&#x27;s litigation, which he claimed was a violation of his civil rights.
* November 17 – In support of Dandar&#x27;s lawsuit, Rathbun claimed in sworn testimony that Scientology spent $30 million to influence Florida judges and defame Dandar during the criminal and civil lawsuits concerning McPherson&#x27;s death. Rathbun also claimed that Scientology influenced Wood&#x27;s ruling of McPherson&#x27;s death as &quot;accident&quot; by bribing her lawyer, Jeffrey Goodis, with Super Bowl tickets and other gifts. Goodis denied the charges.
* November 24 – Dandar added Miscavige as a defendant in his federal lawsuit against Scientology.
* November 28 – Mat Pesch, the former treasury secretary of the FSO, claimed that he witnessed the OSA dumping $20 million in FSO reserves into Scientology&#x27;s legal defense over McPherson&#x27;s death.

===Memorial brick===

In 2001, a group called Citizens for a Better Clearwater decided to renovate an unused alley owned by the City of Clearwater. They called the project Cleveland Street Gas Light Alley, and their fundraising efforts included soliciting donations for engraved paver bricks that would be laid in the walkway. The alley abutted the Coachman Building, owned by the Church of Scientology. Several Scientology critics ordered bricks, including a memorial brick for Lisa McPherson ordered by staff members of the Lisa McPherson Trust, an advocacy organization dedicated to &quot;expose the deceptive and abusive practices of Scientology and help those victimized by [the Church of Scientology]&quot;. The committee reversed their initial decision to reject the brick donations from the critics and the bricks were placed. However, over the years, the Lisa McPherson brick has been vandalized many times and replaced.

===Lisa McPherson Clause===
As a result of the controversy surrounding McPherson&#x27;s death, the Church of Scientology now requires members to sign a general release form each time they register for a new service, whereby they make certain agreements, such as acknowledging that Scientology is a religion and not intended to treat medical issues, promising not to sue the Church for any reason unless criminal negligence is assured, or disavowing psychiatric treatment. In the event a Scientologist is involuntarily placed into a psychiatric ward or institution, the form also grants permission to allow the Church to intervene on their behalf and have them released into the care of other Scientologists in order to undergo the Introspection Rundown or any other Scientology services deemed necessary.

===Injunction against the film &quot;The Profit&quot;===
During the civil suit against Scientology brought by McPherson&#x27;s family members, an injunction was sought and obtained to keep the Scientology-critical film &quot;The Profit&quot; from being shown to avoid prejudicing the jury pool against Scientology.

<doc id="1052335" wikidata="Q3422736" url="?curid=1052335" title="Red House, Bexleyheath">
<text>Red House is a significant Arts and Crafts building located in Bexleyheath, south-east London, England. Co-designed in 1859 by the architect Philip Webb and the designer William Morris, it was created to serve as a family home for Morris. Construction was completed in 1860.

Following an education at the University of Oxford, Morris decided to construct a rural house for himself and his new wife, Jane Morris, within a commuting distance of central London. Purchasing a plot of land in what at the time was the village of Upton in Kent, he employed his friend Webb to help him design and construct the house, financing the project with money inherited from his wealthy family. Morris was deeply influenced by Medievalism and Medieval-inspired Neo-Gothic styles are reflected throughout the building&#x27;s design. It was constructed using Morris&#x27; ethos of craftsmanship and artisan skills and is an early example of what came to be known as the Arts and Crafts movement.

A number of Morris&#x27; friends visited, most notably the Pre-Raphaelite painters Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, both of whom aided him in decorating the House; various Burne-Jones wall murals remain. While at Red House, Morris was involved in the formation of his design company, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., and embarked on his earliest wallpaper designs. It was also here that his two daughters, Jenny and May, were born. Although initially intending to live there for the rest of his life, Morris found that the house proved too expensive to run and did not suit his lifestyle. After five years, he moved his family to a flat in Queen Square, Bloomsbury and sold the property.

Red House remained a private residence for various individuals from 1866 until 2002, during which period various alterations were made to the interior design. In 1950 it was designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. From 1952 to 1999 the architect Edward Hollamby lived at the House, initiating attempts at preservation and establishing the Friends of Red House charity in 1998. In 2003, the National Trust purchased the property, undertaking a project of conservation and maintaining it as a visitor attraction with an accompanying tea room and gift shop.

==William Morris at Red House==

William Morris was born in Walthamstow, Essex, on 24 March 1834, and raised in a wealthy middle-class family. Although his father died in 1847, the Morris family remained affluent as a result of shares in the Devon Great Consols copper mines. In 1853 Morris began university studies at Exeter College, Oxford, focusing on Classics. There, he developed a keen interest in medieval history and medieval architecture, inspired by Oxford&#x27;s many medieval buildings. This interest was tied to Britain&#x27;s growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. He was heavily influenced by the writings of art critic John Ruskin, being particularly inspired by his chapter &quot;On the Nature of Gothic Architecture&quot; in the second volume of &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;. Morris adopted Ruskin&#x27;s philosophy of rejecting the tawdry industrial manufacture of decorative arts and architecture in favour of a return to hand-craftsmanship, raising artisans to the status of artists, and creating art that should be affordable and hand-made, with no hierarchy of artistic mediums.

At Oxford, Morris became the best friend of fellow undergraduate Edward Burne-Jones; they had a shared attitude to life and a keen mutual interest in Arthurianism. Having passed his finals and been awarded a BA in 1856, Morris began an apprenticeship with the Oxford-based Gothic revival architect George Edmund Street in January 1856. There he was placed under the supervision of Philip Webb, who became a close friend. He soon relocated to Street&#x27;s London office, in August 1856 moving into a flat in Bloomsbury, Central London with Burne-Jones. Morris was fascinated by London but dismayed at its pollution and rapid expansion into neighbouring countryside, describing it as &quot;the spreading sore&quot;. Preferring rural life, Morris became increasingly fascinated with the Pre-Raphaelites and soon met one of the foremost Pre-Raphaelite painters, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, after Burne-Jones became Rossetti&#x27;s disciple; the three soon became close friends. Through Rossetti, Morris came to associate with poet Robert Browning, and the artists Arthur Hughes, Thomas Woolner, and Ford Madox Brown. At Rossetti&#x27;s recommendation, Morris and Burne-Jones moved in together to a flat at No. 17 Red Lion Square in Bloomsbury by November 1856. Morris designed and commissioned furniture for the flat in a medieval style, much of which he painted with Arthurian scenes in a direct rejection of mainstream artistic tastes.

In October 1857 Morris met Jane Burden, a woman from a working-class background, at a theatre performance and asked her to model for him. Smitten with her, they entered into a relationship and were engaged in spring 1858; Burden would later admit, however, that she never loved Morris. They were married in a simple ceremony held at St Michael at the North Gate church in Oxford on 26 April 1859, before honeymooning in Bruges, Belgium. Newly married, Morris decided to construct a house for himself and his bride. He commissioned Webb, who was then setting out as and architect independent of Street, to help him design it.

===Origins and construction: 1859–60===

Morris envisioned Red House as being not only a family home, but also a background to his ongoing artistic work. He wanted it to be situated in a rural area that was not far from London, and chose to search in Kent because it was his favourite county; he particularly enjoyed its geographical mix of large open spaces with small hills and rivers, favourably contrasting it to the flat expanse of his native Essex. After looking at various locations for sale in the area, he settled on a plot of land in the village of Upton in West Kent; although ten miles to London by road, it was situated three miles from the nearest railway station, Abbey Wood railway station. At Upton, Morris purchased an orchard and a meadow, wanting his new home to be surrounded by an apple and cherry orchard. Morris would likely have been pleased that Upton was close to the track that pilgrims followed to Canterbury Cathedral during the Middle Ages, and would also have had the opportunity to visit the ruins of the Medieval Lesnes Abbey which were around three miles away.

While Red House was under construction, Morris and his wife lived in rented accommodations at 41 Great Ormond Street, just along the road from Webb&#x27;s office, at 7 Great Ormond Street. However, as the project neared completion, the Morrises moved to Amberley Lodge, close to the site, so that Morris could monitor the builder&#x27;s progress. Webb and Morris would work on the design of the house together. Thus, the National Trust have described it as &quot;a complex fusion of Morris&#x27;s romantic utopianism and Webb&#x27;s practical common sense&quot;, while Edward and Doris Hollamby described it as &quot;a collaborative effort in which we cannot separate one from the other&quot;. Red House would be Webb&#x27;s first project as an independent architect, while it remained the only house that Morris ever built. The actual construction was given to a contractor, and the structure took a year to build. It cost Morris approximately £4,000, at a time when the value of his shares was dropping.

Unique in its design, Red House was designed to an L-shaped plan, with two stories and a high-pitched roof made of red tile. The large hall, dining room, library, morning room, and kitchen were located on the ground floor, while on the first floor were situated the main living rooms, the drawing room, the studio, and the bedrooms. The servants&#x27; quarters were larger than in most contemporary buildings, reflecting the embryonic ideas regarding working class conditions which would lead Morris and Webb to become socialists in later life. Windows were positioned to suit the design of the rooms rather than to fit an external symmetry; thus a variety of different window types are present, including tall casements, hipped dormers, round-headed sash-windows, and bull&#x27;s eye windows. The house lacked any applied ornamentation, with its decorative features instead serving constructional purposes, such as the arches over the windows, and the louvre in the open roof over the staircase. According to Morris&#x27; biographer J.W. Mackail, the external design of the house was &quot;plain almost to severity, and depended for its effect on its solidity and fine proportion.&quot; This was somewhat radical at the time, as most contemporary buildings were heavily furnished with ornamentation. Rosseti termed it &quot;a real wonder of the age ... which baffles all description&quot;, while Morris biographer Fiona MacCarthy described it as &quot;the ultimate Pre-Raphaelite building&quot;.
The architecture of Red House was inspired by styles of British design from the thirteenth century, and Morris described the building as being &quot;very mediaeval in spirit&quot;. Historian E.P. Thompson asserted that the house &quot;was built, not–as in previous Gothic revivals–in an attempt to combine a number of superficial medieval characteristics which pleased the taste of the architect, but in a definite attempt to adapt late Gothic methods of building to the needs of the nineteenth century.&quot;
Later owners of the property, Edward and Doris Hollamby, described Red House as Webb and Morris&#x27; attempt to &quot;apply Gothic principles to domestic architecture without archaeological imitation&quot;. While asserting that it was certainly &quot;a far cry from the Victorian bourgeois norm&quot;, MacCarthy stated that it was &quot;by no means a revolutionary building&quot;, having much in common with other Neo-Gothic buildings of the period, comparing its &quot;complicated dense&quot; interiors to those of the architect Augustus Pugin.

When the building itself had been constructed, Morris set about decorating the interior, however specifically chose to design and create almost everything himself. Only a few pieces of decor were pre-bought as ready-made items, namely the Persian carpets, and blue china or delft. Morris took his painted settle from the Red Lion Square flat and had it transported in pieces to Red House, where it was reassembled in the drawing room. Many other items of furniture were specially designed by Webb, including the oak dining table, other tables, chairs, cupboards, copper candlesticks, fire dogs, and glass tableware. The plastered walls and ceilings were given simple designs in tempera, although more complex designs were planned for the hall and main living rooms. Stained glass windows were installed in the house, with designs created by Burne-Jones and Webb. In reference to the route taken by medieval pilgrims headed to Canterbury, Morris termed the passage which connects the main hallway to the house&#x27;s rear entrance, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Rest&quot;. The garden was similarly unique in its design, with Morris insisting on integration of the design of the house and garden; the latter was divided into four small square gardens by trellises on which roses grew. The flower beds were bordered with lavender and rosemary while lilies and sunflowers had also been planted in the garden. White jasmine, roses, honeysuckle and passion flower were planted to climb up the walls of the house.

===Morris&#x27; life at Red House: 1860–1865===

Morris and his wife moved into Red House at the end of the summer of 1860. At the time, he envisioned living there for the rest of his life, although ultimately would only stay there for five years. Morris&#x27; friends regularly came to visit; Burne-Jones and his new bride, Georgiana Burne-Jones, would often spend their Sundays at Red House, while other regular visitors included Rossetti, Faulkner and his two sisters, Webb, Swinburne, Madox Brown, and Arthur Hughes. Here, Burne-Jones and Faulkner often played practical jokes on Morris, for instance, doctoring a pack of playing cards or sewing up his clothing to make it feel much tighter. The group of friends liked to play hide and seek at the house, and in the evenings would gather around the piano to sing songs.

It was at Red House that Morris and Janey&#x27;s two children were born; in January 1861, a daughter named Jane Alice Morris, who would come to be known as &quot;Jenny&quot;. Jenny was followed in March 1862 by the birth of their second daughter, Mary &quot;May&quot; Morris. Morris was a caring father to his daughters, and years later they both recounted having had idyllic childhoods. However, there were problems in Morris&#x27;s marriage as Janey became increasingly close to Rossetti, who often painted her. It is unknown if their affair was ever sexual, although by this point other members of the group were noticing Rossetti and Janey&#x27;s closeness. Morris also hired various servants, four of whom were cited as living in the house in the 1861 census; the cook Charlotte Cooper, the housemaid Jane Chapman, the nanny Elizabeth Reynolds, and the groom Thomas Reynolds.

Morris added to both the house&#x27;s interior and the design of the garden intermittently over the years, aided by his various friends. There was to be no wallpaper anywhere in the house, with the walls instead being painted or covered by tapestries. The walls of the staircase were intended to feature a painted mural by Burne-Jones depicting scenes from the Trojan War, while on the wall of the hall beneath was intended to be a picture of warships carrying the ancient Greek soldiers to Troy. Although depicting scenes from Classical mythology, Morris had wanted the designs to be medieval in style, with the warships being based on those of the fourteenth century. On the hallway cupboard, Morris began (although never finished) a painting based on Thomas Malory&#x27;s tale of how Sir Lancelot brought Sir Tristan and La Belle Iseult to the castle of the Joyous Garde. The figures themselves are depictions of some of Morris&#x27; friends, among them Jane, Faulkner, the Burne-Joneses, and Lizzie Siddel. In the dining room, Morris planned to decorate the walls with a series of embroidered female heroines, based in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot;. Produced by Jane and her sister Bessie, only seven or eight were completed.

Around the walls of the drawing room, Morris had wanted a mural featuring a series of scenes from the fifteenth-century Middle English romance of &quot;Sir Degrevant&quot;. Ultimately, three were executed by Burne-Jones, and survive today; they feature Morris as king and Jane as queen. Over the fireplace, Morris had inscribed a Latin motto, &quot;Ars longa vita brevis&quot;, meaning &quot;Life is short, but art endures.&quot; The settle from Red Lion Square was installed here, on top of which was fashioned a minstrels&#x27; gallery designed for Christmas concerts.
Designs were pricked into the ceilings and then painted with simple, bold patterns. Commenting on the designs being introduced by his friend, in February 1862 Burne-Jones wrote that &quot;Top [i.e. Morris] thrives through bandy, and is slowly making Red House the beautifullest place on Earth.&quot;
It was while living at Red House, in April 1861, that Morris co-founded a decorative arts company, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., with six other partners: Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, Ford Madox Brown, Charles Faulkner, and Peter Paul Marshall. Operating from a premises at No. 6 Red Lion Square, they referred to themselves as &quot;the Firm&quot; and were intent on adopting Ruskin&#x27;s ideas of reforming British attitudes to production. They hoped to reinstate decoration as one of the fine arts and adopted an ethos of affordability and anti-elitism. For additional staff, they employed boys from the Industrial Home for Destitute Boys in Euston, central London, many of whom were trained as apprentices. Although working within the Neo-Gothic school of design, they differed from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship.

The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm&#x27;s early years as they were in high demand for the surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris&#x27;s anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.

Although the Firm was becoming more successful, it did not generate large profits in its early years. Mackail suggests that as a result, the Morris family were placed under increasing financial strain as they attempted to retain the lavish lifestyle to which they had become accustomed. Morris was also considering expanding operations at Upton by moving the Firm&#x27;s workshops to the village. As part of this, he formulated a plan for a second wing of Red House to be constructed, to house the Burne-Jones family. Although Burne-Jones agreed and together they began to organise the design of the new house, these were disrupted when Georgiana contracted scarlet fever, resulting in the miscarriage of her second child. The plans were subsequently scrapped. It has been suggested that Burne-Jones may also have been loath to move from London at the time because his artistic career was becoming increasingly successful, and most of his contacts within the art world were in the city. Morris was deeply disappointed with this, writing to Burne-Jones: &quot;As to our palace of art, I confess your letter was a blow to me at first, though hardly an unexpected one: in short I cried, but I have got over it now; of course I see it from your point of view&quot;.

===Leaving Red House: 1865===

With the collapse of his ideas regarding Upton becoming the base for the Firm&#x27;s operations, Morris began to recognise various problems with the property. Being north-facing, the interior of the house was cold during winter, which aggravated Morris&#x27; various medical conditions, and its isolated location made it difficult for doctors to visit. The three-mile commute by carriage from the house to Abbey Wood railway station over an exposed and windy plateau further aggravated him, as did the daily commute from Abbey Wood to the Firm&#x27;s offices in Bloomsbury, which took up three to four hours a day.
Although various authors on the subject have asserted that there were financial considerations encouraging Morris to leave, it has been established that in 1865 Morris&#x27; dividends from his shares were higher than at any point since 1857.

Morris decided to move out of Red House and sell the property rather than rent it out, although no immediate purchaser appeared. He moved with his family to Queen Square in Bloomsbury in autumn 1865. Those pieces of furniture which proved too difficult to move to their new abode were left in Red House, where some of them are still present. Morris never returned to visit the Red House, commenting that the sight of it would be too emotional for him. Nevertheless, Mackail described the five years that Morris lived at Red House as being &quot;probably the happiest and not the least fruitful of his life.&quot;

==After Morris==

Morris had been unable to find a buyer for Red House, and agreed to let it for £95 per annum to a retired commander in the Indian Navy named James Arnold Heathcote (1827–1877), who moved into the house in spring 1866. Having served at the siege of Multan, Heathcote had gone on to become a specialist in maritime surveying, marrying Eliza Margarita Burton and with her having two children, Marion and Rennie. After retirement he returned to England, moving to Red House with two servants. They also purchased pieces of Morris&#x27; furniture that were in the house; two of Morris&#x27; chairs remained in the Heathcote family until 1997, when they were sold at Christie&#x27;s auction house in London to the Delaware Art Museum in Wilmington. After Heathcote&#x27;s death at the House, it was purchased from Morris by a wealthy stockbroker, Edmund Charlesworth (1831–1890), who lived there from 1879 to 1889 with his wife Marta and daughter Laura. The Charlesworth family decorated the house&#x27;s studio with Morris&#x27; &quot;Daisy&quot; wallpaper, which remains in place to the present.
In 1889 Charlesworth sold the Red House for £2,900 to Charles Holme (1848–1923), who remained owner until 1903. Holme had become prosperous through a woollen business in Bradford before expanding into the Asian goods trade and by the 1880s he was employed as a buyer for the Liberty department store. Married to Clara Benton, they had three daughters and a son, who moved with him to the House. Holme admired Morris, and it was here in 1893 that he founded the arts magazine, &quot;The Studio&quot;, which gave importance to the Arts and Crafts movement. The earliest photographs of Red House date from the period in which it was occupied by Holme. He also contributed to the development of the building by encouraging visitors to scratch their signatures into the window panes on the screen dividing the entrance hall from the gallery with either a diamond ring or glass-scratching implement. He collected over one hundred signatures here, from family members, friends, and visitors. Notable names include those of May Morris and Georgina Burne-Jones on their visit in 1897, and the names of Japanese visitors who were in London to collect a battleship docked on the River Thames; among the latter was the future Japanese Prime Minister Saitō Makoto. This would be a tradition continued by some of the later owners, with the latest engraving dating to 1952.

In 1903 the House was purchased by Henry Muff (1850–1910), a draper from Bradford who lived there with his wife Maude and their son Edward, who later became a noted architect. The Muffs were social activists involved in a number of progressive causes, with Maude being elected to Bexley Urban District Council in 1907, being the second woman in England to have been elected to a district council. In keeping with the fashions of the time, they introduced a lighter colour scheme throughout much of the House. Henry died at the house in 1910, although Maude continued to live there for another decade. In 1920, she began renting the property to Arthur James Sherwell (1863–1942), who had previously served as a Liberal Party member of parliament for Huddersfield from 1906 to 1918, positioning himself on the radical wing of the party. He moved to the House with his wife Amy Whadcoat, which they later purchased from Maude Muff.

In 1924, Sherwell sold Red House to Walter Scott Godfrey (1855–1936), the director of a wine and spirits merchant and an author on anti-theism who had been widowed two years previously. Of all the property&#x27;s residents, he would live there for the shortest time, although he carried out one of the largest alterations, by removing the dividing wall between the downstairs waiting room and bedroom to create a study-cum-library and inserted a porthole window between this library and the Pilgrims&#x27; Rest, which was designed by his son, the architect Walter Hindes Godfrey. He lived at the house with his youngest daughter and three domestic servants, however he felt lonely at Red House and found its upkeep too expensive. In 1927 an Australian, Alfred Herbert Horsfall (1871–1944), purchased the house. A medical doctor, Horsfall had served as a medic in the British Army during the South African War, before moving to Britain and becoming a lecturer for the Social and Political Education League and staunch apologist for the British Empire. In the stock market crash of the early 1930s, Horsfall lost much of his money. He was unsuccessful in selling the House in 1932.

===Threats and the Hollambys: 1934–2002===

Horsfall attempted to sell the house again in 1934, this time with Harrods; he put forward an asking price of £4,000. Many believed that the house would be demolished to make way for encroaching suburban development, so a campaign group emerged with the hope of preserving the house and donating it to The National Trust; founding a preservation committee, they launched an appeal to purchase the property, with Horsfall agreeing that he would be willing to sell it to them for £3,100. The group sought to raise this amount, gaining the support of writers like Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and John Masefield, and architects Edwin Lutyens, Giles Gilbert Scott, Herbert Baker, and Raymond Unwin, as well as the former Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.
They asserted that &quot;We realise that at the present time the public are interested in other and very different movements in architecture and industrial art. We are however confident that, for the sake of its association with the work of William Morris and his group, the importance of this house will be appreciated in the future, and its loss in this regard will be recognised as irreparable.&quot; By December 1934, the committee&#x27;s appeal had only raised £550 and the Trust were unwilling to foot the rest of the bill. The committee returned the donations that had been offered. On learning of this, May Morris commented that &quot;That beautiful house is fated to have bad luck, it seems!&quot;

The House was purchased by a local estate agent, Thomas Curtis Hills (c.1883–1957), in 1935. Aware of the threats posed to the house, he moved into it with his wife, Beatrice Nellie Foster. In 1941, during the Second World War, the government&#x27;s Assistance Board took control of the house&#x27;s ground floor, using it as an office to aid those left homeless by the Blitz. Commenting on this situation, a visitor to the building, Prime Minister of New Zealand Peter Fraser, stated that &quot;I think Morris would be pleased to know that a house of his is being used for such a purpose. The house is being devoted to the service of the people and Morris was for the people all the time.&quot; An air raid shelter was constructed in the House&#x27;s gardens for the use of the Assistance Board&#x27;s staff. After the war, the House had fallen into a poor state and the Hills were keen to sell it. In 1950, they unsuccessfully attempted to sell it to the National Trust and then the Labour Party, before offering it for £5,000 to anyone &quot;willing to preserve it for the nation&quot;. The same year, it was designated a Grade I [listed building] by English Heritage. At the same time, the wellhead in the garden, also designed by Webb, was given its own Grade I listing.

The couple moved out of the building in early 1951, and it was left empty for over a year; it was purchased for £3,500 by Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Toms (1914–2005) and Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Hollamby (1921–1999) in 1952.
Both architects working for the London County Council, Toms and Hollamby had a keen interest in Morris and embraced his socialist ideals, being members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the British-Soviet Friendship Society. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were only able to afford a mortgage with the aid of a loan from Toms&#x27; father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms&#x27; name, and thus Hollamby became Toms&#x27; tenant. Both architects had wives – Mary Toms and Doris Hollamby – and children, and thus both families moved into the building in 1952, dividing the rooms among themselves, with the old kitchen being used as a communal dining room. In 1954, a third architect, David Gregory Jones, joined them at the House, and together they set about renovating much of the property. In 1957 the Toms moved out, desiring to live closer to central London, and they were replaced by Jean and David Macdonald; Jean was an architect who worked alongside Ted Hollamby, while David was an accountant and woodworker. Rearranging the former ownership arrangements, the Macdonalds and Hollambys agreed to legally own half of the property each. However, in 1964 the Macdonalds left and the Hollambys assumed sole ownership of the House.

In 1953, the newly founded William Morris Society held its inaugural meeting at Red House, subsequently holding a garden party there in 1960 to commemorate its centenary. After his retirement in 1985, Ted Hollamby decided to open the House up to visitors, offering guided tours on one Sunday per month. As the number of those attending such tours grew, especially in the 1996 centenary of Morris&#x27; death, Hollamby began to search for a way of securing future public access. In 1998 he helped to establish the Friends of Red House, a group of individuals who were largely members of the Bexley Civic Society, and who helped to maintain the House and its gardens as well as give tours to visitors. Hollamby died in 1999, and his wife left Red House to move to a care home in 2002. 

===The National Trust===
After Doris Hollamby put the house up for sale, an anonymous benefactor purchased it and donated it to the National Trust, who completed the purchase in 2003, with the Friends of Red House continuing to organise tours. Contributions from the William Morris Society and Bexley Council also aided the Trust in purchasing the building. It has since performed further restoration and research to restore the house as much as possible to its original condition. The house is open to the public, but not every day; guided tours must be advance-booked and unguided visits are available for limited periods. There is a tea room with a gift shop.

In November 2004, the National Trust organised a seminar titled &quot;Red House: Past and Future Lives&quot; at the Art Workers&#x27; Guild at which various specialists in the house presented papers on the subject.

In 2013, a previously unknown mural depicting five figures from the Book of Genesis was discovered in Morris&#x27; bedroom at the house. It was believed that it resembled the joint work of Morris, Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Siddal, and Ford Madox Brown; as a result, the building&#x27;s property manager James Breslin described the mural as being &quot;of international significance&quot;.

<text>1 Esdras (), also Esdras A, Greek Esdras, Greek Ezra, or 3 Esdras, is the ancient Greek Septuagint version of the biblical Book of Ezra in use within the early church, and among many modern Christians with varying degrees of canonicity. 1 Esdras is substantially similar to the standard Hebrew version of Ezra–Nehemiah, with the passages specific to the career of Nehemiah removed or re-attributed to Ezra, and some additional material.

As part of the Septuagint translation, it is now regarded as canonical in the churches of the East, but apocryphal in the West; either presented in a separate section, or excluded altogether. 1 Esdras is found in Origen&#x27;s &quot;Hexapla&quot;. The Greek Septuagint, the Old Latin bible and related bible versions include both Esdras Αʹ (English title: 1 Esdras) and Esdras Βʹ (Ezra–Nehemiah) as separate books.

There is scope for considerable confusion with references to 1 Esdras. The name refers primarily to translations of the original Greek &#x27;Esdras A&#x27;. The Septuagint calls it Esdras A and the Vetus Latina calls it 1 Esdras, while the Vulgate calls it 3 Esdras. It was considered apocryphal by Jerome.

== Contents ==
1 Esdras contains the whole of Ezra with the addition of one section; its verses are numbered differently. Just as Ezra begins with the last two verses of 2 Chronicles, 1 Esdras begins with the last two chapters; this suggests that Chronicles and Esdras may have been read as one book at sometime in the past.

Ezra 4:6 includes a reference to a King Ahasuerus. Etymologically, Ahasuerus is the same as Xerxes, who reigned between Darius I and Artaxerxes I. In 1 Esdras, the section is reorganized, leading up to the additional section, and the reference to Ahasuerus is removed.

The additional section begins with a story variously known as the &#x27;Darius contest&#x27; or &#x27;Tale of the Three Guardsmen&#x27; which was interpolated into 1 Esdras 3:4 to 4:4. This section forms the core of 1 Esdras with Ezra 5, which together are arranged in a literary chiasm around the celebration in Jerusalem at the exiles&#x27; return. This chiastic core forms 1 Esdras into a complete literary unit, allowing it to stand independently from the book of Nehemiah. Indeed, some scholars, such as W. F. Albright and Edwin M. Yamauchi, believe that Nehemiah came back to Jerusalem &quot;before&quot; Ezra.

==Author and criticism==

The purpose of the book seems to be retelling the Return to Zion in a way that it revolved around the story of the dispute among the courtiers, the &#x27;Tale of the Three Guardsmen&#x27;. Since there are various discrepancies in the account, most scholars hold that the work was written by more than one author. However, some scholars believe that this work may have been the original, or at least the more authoritative. Most scholars agree that the original language of the work was Aramaic and Hebrew, with a few arguing for the originality of the Greek. The text contains similarities to the vocabulary in the Book of Daniel and II Maccabees, and it is presumed that the authors came either from Lower Egypt or Palestine and wrote during the Seleucid period. Assuming this theory is correct, many scholars consider the possibility that the book made use of an Aramaic chronicle.

Josephus makes use of the 1 Esdras which he treats as Scripture, while generally disregarding the canonical text of Ezra–Nehemiah. Some scholars believe that the composition is likely to have taken place in the second century BC. Many Protestant and Catholic scholars assign no historical value to the sections of the book not duplicated in Ezra–Nehemiah. The citations of the other books of the Bible, however, provide an early alternative to the Septuagint for those texts, which increases its value to scholars.

In the current Greek texts, the book breaks off in the middle of a sentence; that particular verse thus had to be reconstructed from an early Latin translation. However, it is generally presumed that the original work extended to the Feast of Tabernacles, as described in Nehemiah 8:13–18. An additional difficulty with the text appears to readers who are unfamiliar with chiastic structures common in Semitic literature. If the text is assumed to be a Western-style, purely linear narrative, then Artaxerxes seems to be mentioned before Darius, who is mentioned before Cyrus. (Such jumbling of the order of events, however, is also presumed by some readers to exist in the canonical Ezra and Nehemiah.) The Semitic chiasm is corrected in at least one manuscript of Josephus in the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, Book 11, chapter 2 where we find that the name of the above-mentioned Artaxerxes is called Cambyses.

Some scholars, including Joseph Blenkinsopp in his 1988 commentary on Ezra–Nehemiah, hold that the book is a late 2nd/early 1st century BC revision of Esdras and Esdras β, while others such as L. L. Grabbe believe it to be independent of the Hebrew-language Ezra–Nehemiah.

==Use in the Christian canon==
The book was widely quoted by early Christian authors and it found a place in Origen&#x27;s &quot;Hexapla&quot;.

In early Latin traditions, Ezra, Nehemiah, 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras were known, respectively, as 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, 3 Esdras (‘the Greek Esdras’) and 4 Esdras. 

In the Vulgate, I Esdras is considered to be Ezra, II Esdras to be Nehemiah, III Esdras to be 1 Esdras, and IV Esdras to be 2 Esdras. For Jerome, III Esdras and IV Esdras were apocryphal. As Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate version of the Bible gradually achieved dominance in Western Christianity, III Esdras no longer circulated. From the 13th century onwards, Vulgate Bibles produced in Paris reintroduced a Latin text of 1 Esdras, in response to commercial demand. However, the use of the book continued in the Eastern Church, and it remains a part of the Eastern Orthodox canon.

In the Roman rite liturgy, 1 Esdras is cited once in the Extraordinary Missal of 1962 in the Offertory of the votive Mass for the election of a Pope. (&quot;Let them not take part in the holy things, until there arise a priest unto showing and truth.&quot;) (3 Esdras 5, 40).

At the Council of Trent, only 3 bishops voted for an explicit rejection of the books of Esdras; the overwhelming majority &quot;withheld any explicit decision on these books&quot;. &quot;The question of Esdras&#x27; canonical status was left theoretically open.&quot; Catholic theologians and apologists disagree, but some argue that these books could theoretically be added as &quot;tritiocanonical&quot; books by the Roman Catholic Magisterium (or pope) at a later time, most likely related to union with one or more of the churches who already hold these books to be canonical.

==Nomenclature==
The book normally called 1 Esdras is numbered differently among various versions of the Bible. In most editions of the Septuagint, the book is titled in Greek: and is placed before the single book of Ezra–Nehemiah, which is titled in Greek: Ἔσδρας Βʹ.

1 Esdras is called 3 Esdras in the Latin Vulgate, which was translation from the Greek version of the Septuagint called Esdras A.

The Vulgate denoted 1 Esdras (Ezra) and 2 Esdras (Nehemiah) respectively. Vulgate Bible editions of the 13th century, and in what later became the usage of the Clementine Vulgate and the Anglican Articles of Religion, the Book of Ezra is applied to &#x27;1 Esdras&#x27;; while the Book of Nehemiah corresponds to &#x27;2 Esdras&#x27;; Esdras 1 (Esdras A in the Septuagint) corresponds to 3 Esdras and finally 2 Esdras, an additional work associated with the name Ezra, is denoted &#x27;4 Esdras&#x27; (It is called &#x27;2 Esdras&#x27; in the King James Version and in most modern English bibles). 3 Esdras continues to be accepted as canonical by Eastern Orthodoxy and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, with 4 Esdras varying in canonicity between particular denominations within the Eastern churches.

Overwhelmingly, citations in early Christian writings claimed from the scriptural &#x27;Book of Ezra&#x27; (without any qualification) are taken from 1 Esdras, and never from the &#x27;Ezra&#x27; sections of Ezra–Nehemiah (Septuagint &#x27;Esdras B&#x27;), the majority of early citations being taken from the 1 Esdras section containing the &#x27;Tale of the Three Guardsmen&#x27;, which is interpreted as Christological prophecy.

<text>Lake Charlevoix ( ) is a lake in Charlevoix County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the third largest inland lake in the state with a surface area of over and of shoreline. The maximum depth in the main basin is and in the south arm, .

The lake&#x27;s largest tributaries are the Jordan River, feeding into the south arm at East Jordan, and the Boyne River, flowing into the main basin from the east at Boyne City. Other significant tributaries include Horton, Stover, Porter, and Loeb Creeks. The outflow of Lake Charlevoix is the short Round Lake/Pine River complex which discharges into Lake Michigan at Charlevoix. The lake&#x27;s watershed covers in Charlevoix and Antrim Counties, and a small portion of the northwest corner of Otsego County.

The lake occupies portions of Charlevoix Township, Marion Township, Hayes Township, Eveline Township, Bay Township, and Evangeline Township.

Young State Park is located on the shore of the lake just northwest of Boyne City. The Ironton Ferry at Ironton, a designated Michigan Historical Site in operation since 1876, crosses the south arm where it branches off from the main basin, saving about 20 minutes of driving time around the south arm by the shoreline route.

The lake was also known previously as Pine Lake and Long Lake. It was renamed from &quot;Pine Lake&quot; to its current name (&quot;Lake Charlevoix&quot;) in 1926.

<doc id="1052359" wikidata="Q285958" url="?curid=1052359" title="Mazda6">
<text>The (known as the Mazda Atenza in Japan, derived from the Italian &quot;&quot;) is a mid-size sedan produced by Mazda since 2002, replacing the long-produced Capella/626.

The Mazda6 was marketed as the first example of the company&#x27;s &quot;Stylish, Insightful and Spirited&quot; design philosophy, followed by the Mazda2 in December 2002, the RX-8 in August 2003, the Mazda3 in January 2004, the Mazda5 in the summer of 2005, the MX-5 in October 2005, and the CX-7 in November 2006. The 2003 Mazda6 is essentially the seventh-generation Mazda 626, part of the &#x27;G&#x27; model code family.


== First generation (GG1; 2002) ==

The first-generation Mazda6 was launched in Japan as the Mazda Atenza in May 2002. The model lineup consisted of a four-door sedan, a four-door hatchback and a five-door wagon, marketed in North America as the &quot;Sport Sedan&quot;, &quot;5-Door&quot; and &quot;Sport Wagon&quot;, respectively. In Australia, the lineup was first available in Limited trim, as a sedan; in Classic trim as sedan, hatch or wagon and in Luxury trim as a sedan and liftback — and Luxury Sports trim, as a liftback. In New Zealand, the lineup consisted of 2.0L GLX (sedan only), 2.3L GSX (sedan, liftback, and wagon), and 2.3L Limited (sedan and liftback).

The first generation was marketed as a 2003 model in the United States and as a 2004 model in Canada. In Europe, the luxury sports model was available as a direct injection turbodiesel (&quot;DITD&quot;) estate up until 2007. As of 2008, the European Mazda catalog listed only the &quot;Sport&quot; version of the turbodiesel estate, while the &quot;Luxury Sport&quot; version had been dropped.

Drivetrain combinations included the Mazda MZR engine in configurations of 1.8 L (L8-DE), 2.0 L (LF-VE) and 2.3 L (L3-VE), initially with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission (with a sequential-automatic option, dubbed the &quot;Four-Speed Sport AT&quot;). In the US domestic market a 3.0 L Duratec 30 V6 engine was also available with a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic (with a sequential-automatic option, dubbed the &quot;5-Speed Sport AT&quot;). European and Australian versions also feature a four-cylinder turbodiesel that comes with a six-speed manual transmission and produces significantly more torque than the V6, with much improved fuel economy.

In North America, the 5-speed automatic optional on the V6 models were replaced by an Aisin 6-speed automatic for the 2005 model year. The four-cylinder model received a FS5A-EL five-speed automatic in the following year. Power was directed to the front wheels in most markets, although full-time all-wheel-drive models were available in Japan, Europe, and Australia. Not all configurations were available in all areas – for example, the Mazda 6 as released in Australia was available in 2.3L four-cylinder guise only, when the 626 it replaced had been available with a choice of four- or six-cylinder engines. The MZI V6 engine was only fitted to vehicles manufactured at Mazda&#x27;s Flat Rock Assembly Plant and destined for the U.S. and Canadian domestic markets.

Mazda&#x27;s Hofu Plant in Yamaguchi Prefecture produced the Mazda6 for international markets from February 2002 to August 2007. In North America, Mazda6 production was handled at the AutoAlliance International plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. The first Mazda6 rolled off the AAI assembly line on October 1, 2002, one month after 626 production ended. There are also satellite plants building Mazda6 models in China and Thailand for local markets.

In September 2005, the Mazda6 received a facelift which introduced 5-speed auto and 6-speed manual transmissions, standard 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels, and minor bodywork upgrades.

In China, the Mazda6 was introduced by FAW Mazda in 2003. Despite the release of its successors, the first generation car, known locally as the &quot;Maliu&quot; (马六, &quot;Horse 6&quot;), continues to be manufactured at FAW&#x27;s Changchun plant, having sold over 770,000 units as of 2014. This model is also used as the base for the FAW Benteng, also known as Besturn B70 or Hongqi C301.

=== Mazdaspeed6 ===

The 2006 Mazdaspeed6 (known as &quot;Mazdaspeed Atenza&quot; in Japan and &quot;Mazda6 MPS&quot; in Europe, South Africa and Australia) is a high-performance version of the first generation Mazda6. Its mission statement was written with the help of Peter Birtwhistle, chief of Mazda&#x27;s advanced design studio in Germany at the time. It was initially unveiled as a concept at the 2002 Paris Motor Show. It features a turbocharged version of the 2.3 L MZR inline-four which produces , although the European version was detuned to as a result of stricter emissions standards. The North American version originally produced , which was revised to for 2007. All models have of torque. The 2.3 L DISI turbocharged engine features direct fuel injection and conforms to the new Euro 5 emissions standards. All markets received a revised front fascia with a raised hood, a 6-speed manual transmission, and all-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive system uses Mazda&#x27;s &quot;Active Torque Split&quot; computer-based control, which can route between a 100/0 to 50/50 front/rear torque split depending on driving conditions. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a limited-slip differential.

Originally scheduled to be launched in June 2005, the Mazdaspeed Atenza was delayed until November. In North America, the Mazdaspeed6 comes in two trim levels; the &quot;Sport&quot; trim with cloth interior and standard key entry and ignition; and the &quot;Grand Touring&quot; trim with leather interior, keyless entry/ignition, and optional DVD navigation. Automatic climate control is standard, as is a 200 W Bose stereo system featuring seven speakers and a 9-inch subwoofer in addition to an in-dash six-disc CD changer. A sunroof with moonroof feature is optional on the Grand Touring trim.

The Mazdaspeed6 was released to generally positive reviews, and was noted for impressive power and handling.

== Second generation (GH1/GH2; 2007) ==

The second-generation Mazda6 made its premiere at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show in September. It is based on the modified first-generation Mazda6 chassis which Ford also utilized as their CD3 platform. Mazda continued to provide three body styles, including 4-door saloon (sedan), 5-door hatchback and wagon. A number of journalists have already praised its electrically assisted steering for being considerably improved compared to the previous generation, providing more feedback to the driver. The hatchback model even has a trunk space which beats the larger rival Ford Mondeo and Opel/Vauxhall Insignia (hatchback) by 200 liters with rear seats folded down.

This model of the Mazda6 was awarded 2010 Family Car of the Year by &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine.

At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Mazda announced their new 2011 Mazda6.

=== Facelift ===
=== North America ===
The North American version was redesigned for the 2009 model year, with the wagon and hatchback versions being dropped there. It is a widened and lengthened version of the model sold elsewhere, with larger engines. Reviewers have noted its coupe-like roofline and sportier style. North American engine choices include a new 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and North American versions get the 3.7-liter V6 which is also available in the Mazda CX-9. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; recorded a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 6.1 seconds for the Mazda 6 V6.

In America, only a sedan model was available (In the Middle East, USDM Mazda6 known as Mazda6 Ultra is sold alongside the JDM Mazda6). A Mazdaspeed6 variant was not offered. Despite the North American version&#x27;s increase in dimensions, Mazda maintains that the 6 retains the overall driving experience is still sportier than rivaling Honda Accords, Toyota Camrys, or Chevrolet Malibus. Early reviews have been favorable.

On March 3, 2011, around 50,000 Mazda6 vehicles from the 2009–10 model years were recalled in the United States, with another 15,000 in Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico after it was found that Yellow Sac Spiders were building nests in the fuel line of the vehicles. The Mazda6 has two pipes coming from its gas tank, an extremely rare configuration. The amount of gasoline vapor in the fuel line is just strong enough to draw the spider in but not strong enough to kill it. On April 5, 2014, Mazda reissued the same recall for spiders against all 2010–2013 Mazda6 vehicles with 2.5 liter engines.

Production for North American market would be transferred to Hofu, Japan, when Mazda ceased production at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant.

The last Mazda6 rolled off the line at Mazda&#x27;s Flat Rock Assembly Plant on Friday, August 24, 2012, with Mazda discontinuing production on American soil, effectively ending the 20 year joint-venture between Mazda and Ford. Mazda moved production of the Mazda6 back to the Hofu factory in Japan.

=== Recall ===
In China, over 680,000 Mazdas, including Mazda6 made between September 2008 and January 2016, were recalled due to faulty airbags. An earlier recall involved 280,000 Mazda6 models made between 2003 and 2008 for a similar issue.

===Motorsport===
In 2007, Mazda won its first manufacturers championship in the Touring Car class. In 2009, they finished 2nd in the manufacturer&#x27;s championship with 65 points, behind Acura.

The Mazda6 has also been used in the KONI Challenge Series Sport Touring class. It was last used in 2008 by the Baglieracing team with Dennis Baglier, Chris Gleason, and Marty Luffy as drivers.

The Mazda6 also gives its name to a stock car in the NASCAR Corona Series.

== Third generation (GJ1/GL; 2012) ==
The third generation Mazda6 sedan was unveiled during Moscow International Automobile Salon on 29 August 2012, and the station wagon version followed during the 2012 Paris Motor Show in the following month. This generation is available in a 4-door sedan or 5-door station wagon styles only. The design was previewed by both the Takeri concept, unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show, and the Shinari concept from 2010.

The design was a finalist in the &quot;2013 World Design of the Year&quot;.

== Awards ==
The Mazda6 was second place in the 2003 European Car of the Year awards and made &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 2003. The &quot;Sport Wagon&quot; won the Canadian Car of the Year &quot;Best New Station Wagon&quot; award, while the &quot;Sport&quot; sedan won the Canadian Car of the Year &quot;Best New Family Car&quot; award for 2005. The 6 Estate also won &quot;What Car?&quot;″s &quot;Best Estate&quot; award in 2004. Also the Mazda6 won the 2003 Semperit Irish Car of the Year.

The Mazda6 won the &#x27;Best Mid-size Car (over $28,000)&#x27; title in Australia&#x27;s Best Cars in 2002 and 2003. It came second in 2004, behind the Subaru Liberty, and fifth in 2005 (the Honda Accord Euro was first in 2005). Wheels magazine also awarded the Mazda6 winner of its Active Safety Program in July 2005. In December 2007 the Mazda6 won the Carsales Peoples Choice award for its class in Australia.

The Mazda6 also won &quot;Best Family Sedan&quot; in &quot;MotorWeek&quot;″s 2009 Driver&#x27;s Choice Awards.

The Mazda6 was praised for its edgy handsome design, communicative steering, and tight suspension. However, as it was designed as a world car in order to fit the needs of Europe and Japan, it was smaller than its North American contemporaries in the midsize segment, being criticized for its reduced passenger space. Its acceleration, particularly the V6 engine models, lagged behind that of its rivals as well.

The hatchback&#x27;s liftback/notchback styling was considered a clever design to disguise it as a four-door saloon, as North Americans generally considered trunks more elegant than hatches. The estate had an early demise, but the hatchback was somewhat successful in Canada, especially in Québec, though it would not have a 2009 refresh, as both models were unpopular in the US.

==Motorsport==
For the 2013 Rolex Sports Car Series the Mazda6 was involved in the short lived Grand-Am GX series. Three cars were used, one racing under the number #70, being driven by Jonathan Bomarito, Marino Franchitti, Tom Long, Sylvain Tremblay, and James Hinchcliff, a VisitFlorida.com sponsored car using the number #00, driven by Tristan Nunez, Spencer Pigot, and Tristan Vautier, and Yojiro Terada, and the third car was driven under the #25, being driven by Andrew Carbonell, Tom Long, Rhett O’Doski, and Derek Whitis. The car was successful, albeit in a class with few other cars. The class they were driven in was the GX class, intended for cars using alternative fuels or alternative technologies. The class folded after one year, and was not carried onto the 2014 United SportsCar Championship.

<text>The Special Purpose Individual Weapon (SPIW) was a long-running United States Army program to develop, in part, a flechette-firing &quot;rifle&quot;, though other concepts were also involved. The concepts continued to be tested under the Future Rifle Program and again in the 1980s under the Advanced Combat Rifle program, but neither program resulted in a system useful enough to warrant replacing the M16.

==Project SALVO==
The idea of a flechette-firing individual weapon started in earnest during the Army&#x27;s Project SALVO. SALVO had earlier concluded that a small weapon with a high rate of fire would be considerably deadlier than the large &quot;full power&quot; weapons being developed in the 1950s, and followed several lines of investigation to find the best way to provide high firing rates. SALVO had a small number of &quot;duplex load&quot; weapons developed, where two bullets were stacked, while Springfield Armory and Olin/Winchester both entered multiple barrel firearms.

Even before the SALVO tests, Irwin Barr of AAI Corporation had been developing single and multiple flechette cartridges. The Navy became sufficiently interested in the concept to provide him with some development funding from the Office of Naval Research, resulting in a 12 gauge shotgun shell firing 32 flechettes. The Army later added funding as well, and AAI was invited to SALVO. In SALVO testing they were found to be able to penetrate one side of a standard steel helmet at —excellent given their light weight—but the dispersion of the darts was so great as to make them only marginally useful.

Further development continued by adapting a Winchester Model 70 rifle with new XM110 5.6x53mm rounds firing a single dart. The result was a weapon with somewhat less accuracy than the .308Win (7.62×51mm NATO) rounds, but with equal penetration and a trajectory so flat it could be fired with no sight adjustment out to . Better yet the rounds were very light, and had almost no recoil in comparison to even the .22-caliber weapons under development. This meant they could be fired at extremely high rates of fire, from a very lightweight weapon.

Project SALVO began in 1951 and was based on the assumption that firing multiple projectiles would increase the probability of hitting the target. Consideration to lighter ammunition types and rifle/grenade launcher combinations was given. Flechettes were found to be inaccurate and expelled fiberglass fragments with each round fired. SALVO mainly studied weapons and ammunition as opposed to developing them. It determined that higher velocity projectiles, smaller than .308 (7.62 mm), had equal or greater lethality with less weight. It also found that fully automatic fire did not increase hit probability.

Since the Army was by this time only interested in fully automatic weapons, Barr suggested that they build a multiple barrel prototype in order to quickly test the concept. Various multiple barrel rifles entered the project. The resulting &quot;burst simulators&quot; were tested in 1961, and the general conclusion was that the light weight of the flechette meant that it could be fired at extremely high rates of fire, the baseline being 2300 rpm, from a weapon of only , fully loaded with 60 rounds. Accordingly, the Army became extremely interested in the weapon. The conclusion of Project SALVO was to adopt the Armalite AR-15, which became the M16 rifle.

==Project NIBLICK==
Meanwhile, the Army&#x27;s Operations Research Office, ORO, had been working on Project NIBLICK, follow-on to SALVO to develop a modern grenade launcher. Interested in the original shotgun-type shells, they recommended development of a dedicated flechette-firing weapon combined with a grenade launcher, the SPIW. The final requirements resulted in an over-under weapon, firing flechettes from one barrel, and grenades from the other. It was to weigh under fully loaded with three grenades and 60 flechettes.

Four companies responded to the contract tender: AAI, Springfield Armory, Winchester Arms and Harrington &amp; Richardson. AAI continued with the original 5.6×53mm XM110 rounds (or sized in 0,22 by 2.09 inches, while Springfield and Winchester used a new 5.6×44mm (0.22 by 1.73 inches) XM144 cartridge. The H&amp;R design loaded the dart from the XM144 into their own cartridge design.

The H&amp;R design was the most advanced. It mounted the dart between three plastic sabots in a triangular plastic cartridge. When fired, the sabots were discarded early in small &quot;sub-barrels&quot; while the dart continued down the main barrel. Although the rounds were lightweight, the weapon itself was not, at while loaded, and the weapon was quickly eliminated from the contest.

Winchester&#x27;s design used a &quot;soft recoil&quot; stock which absorbed the recoil of an individual round in a spring. The idea was to allow three rounds to be fired before the spring was completely compressed, meaning that there was very little recoil until the end of the burst. This was intended to dramatically increase the accuracy of burst fire, but the system never truly worked, and was later dropped. The grenade launcher portion of the design proved much more interesting, however, and work continued on that portion.

The Springfield entry was most interesting for its layout. It used two 30-round magazines in tandem in a bullpup layout, taking rounds from the front magazine first. However, their massive magazine-fed grenade launcher pushed the weight to , and it seemed unlikely this could be reduced by much.

AAI&#x27;s design was the least technically advanced. The flechette gun portion was somewhat heavy, but fired at 2400 rpm. Their grenade launcher was a simple single-shot weapon; their semi-automatic version was not ready in time for testing.

The conclusion of the testing was that none of the weapons were ready for development into a combat system. The AAI flechette portion and the Winchester grenade launcher were both interesting for general development, however. More worrying was the result of general testing of the flechette concept. While the weapons delivered on their promise of extremely high rates of fire and excellent penetration, the rounds themselves were extremely expensive to produce, and the darts could be easily deflected in flight even by heavy rain. Finally, the rounds gave off extremely loud reports and had a huge muzzle flash, making the guns easily visible in low light.

A second round of testing followed, with the Springfield model adopting the Winchester grenade launcher with a disposable magazine and a new side-by-side layout for the flechette magazines. AAI&#x27;s design was equipped with their semi-automatic launcher, which was now complete, and a new plastic buttstock/sighting system. Neither updated version proved very reliable and both were over the limit. In 1966 SPIW was put into &quot;maintenance mode&quot; and the M16 adopted.

AAI continued development at a low level, and eventually managed to dramatically improve the reliability of their XM19. However, this revealed another problem: heat buildup in the chamber was great enough to result in &quot;cook off&quot;. Changes in the Army command structure and the adoption of the M16 made interest in the SPIW fade, and eventually the project was allowed to die. AAI&#x27;s original &quot;simple&quot; grenade launcher turned out to be a major success: it was selected as the M203 in 1968 and became a common weapon under the M16.

==The Future Rifle Program==

In 1969, the Army started the Future Rifle Program, and invited AAI to enter against General Electric&#x27;s Dual Cycle Rifle, a derivative of the Springfield SALVO design. (Springfield had closed in 1968.) Additional entries with multiple flechettes or bullets (&quot;micro-caliber&quot;) were also entered, mirroring the original SALVO tests of the 1950s. However, the program came under attack by the United States Congress as a waste of money, and was forced to scale back. Testing finally began in 1974. The AAI design never managed to fire more than six bursts before jamming. A possible entrant was the French designed VFIW assault rifle.

==Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR)==

The concept of firing flechette ammunition was revived for the last time during the 1986 Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR) trials in the late 1980s. Several designs were entered, from the simple Colt ACR to the more exotic flechette designs, such as the Steyr ACR. Although the basic problem of a single-dart flechette round had finally been solved by this time, none of the weapons entered offered the 100% improvement over the M16 that the Army tests required.

It was based on the assumption that accuracy errors made by stressed soldiers could be made up for by launching multiple rounds per trigger pull. The conclusion of the ACR program was that even firing multiple projectiles could not substantially compensate for shooter error.

<text>The Sheffield Outrages were a series of explosions and murders by a group of trade unionists carried out in Sheffield, England in the 1860s.

Sheffield&#x27;s early success in steel production had involved long working hours, in conditions which offered little or no safety protection. In &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844&quot;, Friedrich Engels quotes a local doctor, Dr. Knight, regarding the so-called &quot;Grinder&#x27;s Asthma&quot; suffered by the Sheffield cutlery workers in the mid 19th century:
The city became one of the main centres for trade union organisation and agitation in the United Kingdom.

By the mid-late 1860s the majority of the objectives of the Chartist movement had been frustrated. These social and political reformers had not accomplished all they had hoped to, although they had succeeded in lobbying for the establishment of the first town council in 1843. (Eventually, the great majority of the items of their &#x27;charter&#x27; did, in fact, become law).

Social and working conditions in industrial England were not showing any significant improvement and the - as yet unrecognised - trade unions struggled to protect the interests of their members. These conditions provoked great discontent and eventually militant action. In some isolated incidents, workmen even began to use violence to punish employers and also those fellow-workers who would not become union members: the so-called &quot;Sheffield Outrages&quot;.

The trade unions themselves sought a formal inquiry to establish the facts of the matter, largely as a result of accusations in the newspapers of complicity in these outrages resulting from investigations by W. C. Leng of the &quot;Sheffield Daily Telegraph&quot;. On 17 November 1866 a delegation, which included members of the Sheffield Trades Council and the London Trades Council, requested that the Home Secretary take the necessary measures to investigate.

This led to a Special Commission of Enquiry into these occurrences in May 1867. Immunity was offered to all who gave evidence and, as a result a number of people were encouraged to testify. Among these was William Broadhead, the Secretary of the Sawgrinders&#x27; Union at that time, who described how he had paid two workmen £15 to murder an employer called Linley, who, according to Broadhead, had taken on too many apprentices.

<text>Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter (German; . Free translation: A real/proud Viennese never gives up) is a classic Austrian television series. It was produced by Österreichischer Rundfunk, Austrian Television, and ran for 24 episodes from 1975 to 1979. The script writer was Ernst Hinterberger; the series was based on his 1966 novel &quot;Das Salz der Erde&quot; (The Salt of the Earth). The producer was Hans Preiner, who initiated the project in his series &quot;Impulse&quot; (Impulses), which centered on development of new program formats and training of new, young directors.

&quot;Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter&quot; starred popular Austrian actor Karl Merkatz as the main character, Edmund &quot;Mundl&quot; Sackbauer. Mundl lives in a typical Vienna &quot;Gemeindebau&quot; (a working-class housing estate) at Hasengasse, in Vienna&#x27;s 10th municipal district (&quot;Favoriten&quot;). The series used Viennese dialect and became successful after an initial campaign against it by the &quot;Krone&quot; newspaper as too &quot;common.&quot;

== Movies ==
In 1994 two episodes, &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; and &quot;Jahreswende&quot;, were combined into a movie that had success in theaters and was also available on VHS.

On December 19, 2008, the movie &quot;Echte Wiener - Die Sackbauer-Saga&quot; (&quot;Real Viennese - The Sackbauer Saga&quot;), set 30 years after the last episode of the TV series, opened in Austria. It was directed by Kurt Ockermüller and scripted by Ernst Hinterberger, and Karl Merkatz again played Mundl.

The sequel &quot;Echte Wiener II - Die Deppat&#x27;n und die Gspritzt&#x27;n&quot; is planned to open in December 2010.

== Characters ==

===Edmund &quot;Mundl&quot; Sackbauer===

Edmund Sackbauer is the main character of the series. In the first 13 episodes he is shown as very tyrannical and angry. After a big quarrel with his wife and a serious accident at work, he changes, and the program lost something of its joke because Mundl&#x27;s &quot;fits&quot; were really amusing.

=== Antonia Sackbauer ===
Antonia (&quot;Toni&quot;) Sackbauer is Edmund Sackbauer&#x27;s wife. Although a woman of few words, she generally has the last word and unlike her husband, always makes rational decisions. She is a housewife, but because of money problems gets a job as a janitor in a drugstore. She is warm and generous and a confidante to many of her friends and acquaintances.

In the course of the series we learn that the super, Kurt Blahovec, once thought about marrying her.

===Karl Sackbauer===
Karl (&quot;Karli&quot;) is the Sackbauers&#x27; older child and takes after his father: like Mundl he likes drinking beer, shouts a lot, and uses a lot of obscenities that sometimes get him in trouble. Very early in the series he marries Irma Werner and by the end they have two children, René and Petra. He fights a lot with his sister and is extremely disrespectful to his parents. He drives a forklift but a promotion to supervisor enables him to afford his own apartment.

In the book on which the series is based, he turned his back on Vienna and went to Paris, where he did well as a wrestler; this had to be changed after the slightly built Klaus Rott was cast in the part, and also there was no money for filming out of the country.

Rott had a cabaret act as Karli in which he continued the story of the Sackbauers.

===Johanna Sackbauer===
&quot;Hanni&quot; is the Sackbauers&#x27; younger child and in the first episode becomes engaged to an &quot;avant garde&quot; writer, Franz Vejvoda, leading to big problems in the family. She is often envious and takes offense easily. Starting with the episode &quot;Jahreswende&quot; she is preoccupied with women&#x27;s liberation, which also causes problems in her male-dominated family. To keep up with her fiancé she takes college courses in literature and typing.

===Johann Sackbauer===
Mundl&#x27;s brother, known as &quot;Schani,&quot; is sympathetic to the family and often talks Mundl down from his rages.

<doc id="1052385" wikidata="Q123075" url="?curid=1052385" title="Robert Walser">
<text>Robert Walser (15 April 1878 – 25 December 1956) was a German language Swiss writer. He additionally worked as a copyist, an inventor&#x27;s assistant, a butler, and in various other low-paying trades. Despite marginal early success in his literary career, the popularity of his work gradually diminished over the second and third decades of the 20th century, making it increasingly difficult for him to support himself through writing. He eventually had a nervous breakdown and spent the remainder of his life in sanatoriums.

==Life and work==

===1878–1897===
Walser was born into a family with many children. His brother Karl Walser became a well-known stage designer and painter. Walser grew up in Biel, Switzerland, on the language border between the German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland, and grew up speaking both languages. He attended primary school and progymnasium, which he had to leave before the final exam when his family could no longer bear the cost. From his early years on, he was an enthusiastic theatre-goer; his favourite play was &quot;The Robbers&quot; by Friedrich Schiller. There is a watercolor painting that shows Walser as Karl Moor, the protagonist of that play.

From 1892 to 1895, Walser served an apprenticeship at the Bernischer Kantonalbank in Biel. Afterwards he worked for a short time in Basel. Walser&#x27;s mother, who was &quot;emotionally disturbed&quot;, died in 1894 after being under medical care for a long period. In 1895, Walser went to Stuttgart where his brother Karl lived. He was an office worker at the Deutsche Verlagsanstalt and at the Cotta&#x27;sche Verlagsbuchhandlung; he also tried, without success, to become an actor. On foot, he returned to Switzerland where he registered in 1896 as a Zürich resident. In the following years, he often worked as a &quot;Kommis&quot;, an office clerk, but irregularly and in many different places. As a result, he was one of the first Swiss writers to introduce into literature a description of the life of a salaried employee.

===1898–1912===
In 1898, the influential critic Joseph Victor Widmann published a series of poems by Walser in the Bernese newspaper &quot;Der Bund&quot;. This came to the attention of Franz Blei, and he introduced Walser to the Art Nouveau people around the magazine &quot;Die Insel&quot;, including Frank Wedekind, Max Dauthendey and Otto Julius Bierbaum. Numerous short stories and poems by Walser appeared in &quot;Die Insel.&quot;

Until 1905, Walser lived mainly in Zürich, though he often changed lodgings and also lived for a time in Thun, Solothurn, Winterthur and Munich. In 1903, he fulfilled his military service obligation and, beginning that summer, was the &quot;aide&quot; of an engineer and inventor in Wädenswil near Zürich. This episode became the basis of his 1908 novel &quot;Der Gehülfe&quot; (&quot;The Assistant&quot;). In 1904, his first book, &quot;Fritz Kochers Aufsätze&quot; (Fritz Kocher&#x27;s Essays), appeared in the &quot;Insel Verlag&quot;, with eleven illustrations by his brother Karl.

At the end of 1905 he attended a course in order to become a servant at the castle of Dambrau in Upper Silesia. The theme of serving would characterize his work in the following years, especially in the novel &quot;Jakob von Gunten&quot; (1909). In 1905, he went to live in Berlin, where his brother Karl Walser, who was working as a theater painter, introduced him to other figures in literature, publishing, and the theater. Occasionally, Walser worked as secretary for the artists&#x27; corporation Berliner Secession.

In Berlin, Walser wrote the novels &quot;Geschwister Tanner&quot;, &quot;Der Gehülfe&quot; and &quot;Jakob von Gunten&quot;. They were issued by the publishing house of Bruno Cassirer, where Christian Morgenstern worked as editor. Apart from the novels, he wrote many short stories, sketching popular bars from the point of view of a poor &quot;flaneur&quot; in a very playful and subjective language. There was a very positive echo to his writings. Robert Musil and Kurt Tucholsky, among others, stated their admiration for Walser&#x27;s prose, and authors like Hermann Hesse and Franz Kafka counted him among their favorite writers.

Walser published numerous short stories in newspapers and magazines, many for instance in the &quot;Schaubühne.&quot; They became his trademark. The larger part of his work is composed of short stories – literary sketches that elude a ready categorization. Selections of these short stories were published in the volumes &quot;Aufsätze&quot; (1913) and &quot;Geschichten&quot; (1914).

===1913–1929===
In 1913, Walser returned to Switzerland. He lived for a short time with his sister Lisa in the mental home in Bellelay, where she worked as a teacher. There, he got to know Lisa Mermet, a washer-woman with whom he developed a close friendship. After a short stay with his father in Biel, he went to live in a mansard in the Biel hotel &quot;Blaues Kreuz&quot;. In 1914, his father died.

In Biel, Walser wrote a number of shorter stories that appeared in newspapers and magazines in Germany and Switzerland and selections of which were published in &quot;Der Spaziergang&quot; (1917), &quot;Prosastücke&quot; (1917), &quot;Poetenleben&quot; (1918), &quot;Seeland&quot; (1919) and &quot;Die Rose&quot; (1925). Walser, who had always been an enthusiastic wanderer, began to take extended walks, often by night. In his stories from that period, texts written from the point of view of a wanderer walking through unfamiliar neighborhoods alternate with playful essays on writers and artists.

During World War I, Walser repeatedly had to go into military service. At the end of 1916, his brother Ernst died after a time of mental illness in the Waldau mental home. In 1919, Walser&#x27;s brother Hermann, geography professor in Bern, committed suicide. Walser himself became isolated in that time, when there was almost no communication with Germany because of the war. Even though he worked hard, he could barely support himself as a freelance writer. At the beginning of 1921, he moved to Bern in order to work at the public record office. He often changed lodgings and lived a very solitary life.

During his time in Bern, Walser&#x27;s style became more radical. In a more and more condensed form, he wrote &quot;micrograms&quot; (&quot;Mikrogramme&quot;), called thus because of his minuscule pencil hand that is very difficult to decipher. He wrote poems, prose, dramolettes and novels, including &quot;The Robber&quot; (&quot;Der Räuber&quot;). In these texts, his playful, subjective style moved toward a higher abstraction. Many texts of that time work on multiple levels – they can be read as naive-playful feuilletons or as highly complex montages full of allusions. Walser absorbed influences from serious literature as well as from formula fiction and retold, for example, the plot of a pulp novel in a way that the original (the title of which he never revealed) was unrecognizable. Much of his work was written during these very productive years in Bern.

===1929–1956===
In the beginning of 1929, Walser, who had had anxieties and hallucinations for quite some time, went to the Bernese mental home Waldau, after a mental breakdown, at his sister Fani&#x27;s urging. In his medical records it says: &quot;The patient confessed hearing voices.&quot; Therefore, this can hardly be called a voluntary commitment. He was eventually diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia. While he was in the mental home, his state of mind quickly returned to normal, and he went on writing and publishing. More and more, he used the way of writing he called the &quot;pencil method&quot;: he wrote poems and prose in a diminutive Sütterlin hand, the letters of which measured about a millimeter of height by the end of that very productive phase. Werner Morlang and Bernhard Echte were the first ones who attempted to decipher these writings. In the 1990s, they published a six-volume edition, &quot;Aus dem Bleistiftgebiet&quot; (&#x27;From the Pencil Zone&#x27;). Only when Walser was, against his will, moved to the sanatorium of Herisau in his home canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, did he quit writing, later telling Carl Seelig, &quot;I am not here to write, but to be mad.&quot;

In 1936, his admirer Carl Seelig began to visit him. He later wrote a book, &quot;Wanderungen mit Robert Walser&quot;, about their talks. Seelig tried to revive interest in Walser&#x27;s work by re-issuing some of his writings. After the death of Walser&#x27;s brother Karl in 1943 and of his sister Lisa in 1944, Seelig became Walser&#x27;s legal guardian. Though free of outward signs of mental illness for a long time, Walser was crotchety and repeatedly refused to leave the sanatorium.

In 1955, Walser&#x27;s &quot;Der Spaziergang&quot; (&quot;The Walk&quot;) was translated into English by Christopher Middleton; it was the first English translation of his writing and the only one that would appear during his lifetime. Upon learning of Middleton&#x27;s translation, Walser, who had fallen out of the public eye, responded by musing &quot;Well, look at that.&quot;

Walser enjoyed long walks alone. On 25 December 1956 he was found, dead of a heart attack, in a field of snow near the asylum. The photographs of the dead Walser in the snow are reminiscent of a similar image of a dead man in the snow in his first novel, &quot;Geschwister Tanner&quot;.

==Writings and reception==
Today, Walser&#x27;s texts, completely re-edited since the 1970s, are regarded as among the most important writings of literary modernism. In his writing, he made use of elements of Swiss German in a charming and original manner, while very personal observations are interwoven with &quot;texts about texts&quot;; that is, with contemplations and variations of other literary works, in which Walser often mixes pulp fiction with high literature. Walser has been regarded as the missing link between Heinrich von Kleist and Franz Kafka. As writes Susan Sontag, &quot;at the time [of Walser&#x27;s writing], it was more likely to be Kafka [who was understood] through the prism of Walser.&quot; For example, Robert Musil once referred to Kafka&#x27;s work as &quot;a peculiar case of the Walser type.&quot;

Walser was admired early on by Kafka and writers such as Hermann Hesse, Stefan Zweig, and Walter Benjamin, and was in fact better known during his lifetime than Kafka or Benjamin were known in theirs. He never belonged to a literary school or group, perhaps with the exception of the circle around the magazine &quot;Die Insel&quot; in his youth, but was a notable and often published writer before World War I and into the 1920s. After the second half of the latter decade, he was rapidly forgotten, in spite of Carl Seelig&#x27;s editions, which appeared almost exclusively in Switzerland but received little attention.

Walser was rediscovered only in the 1970s, even though famous German writers such as Christian Morgenstern, Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin, Thomas Bernhard and Hermann Hesse were among his great admirers. Since then, almost all his writings have become accessible through an extensive republication of his entire body of work. He has exerted a considerable influence on various contemporary German writers, including Ror Wolf, Peter Handke, W. G. Sebald, and Max Goldt. In 1967, Walser&#x27;s piece &#x27;Kleist in Thun&#x27; was published in 0 to 9 magazine. A revival of interest in his work arose when, in the late 20th century and early 2000s, his writings from &quot;the Pencil Zone&quot;, also known as &quot;Bleistiftgebiet&quot; or &quot;the Microscripts&quot;, which had been written in a coded, microscopically tiny hand using a form of Kurrent script on scraps of paper collected while in a Waldau sanatorium, were finally deciphered, translated, and published.

In 2004, Spanish writer Enrique Vila-Matas published a novel entitled &quot;Doctor Pasavento&quot; about Walser, his stay on Herisau and the wish to disappear. In 2007, Serbian writer Vojislav V. Jovanović published a book of prose named &quot;Story for Robert Walser&quot; inspired by the life and work of Robert Walser. In 2012, &quot;A Little Ramble: In the Spirit of Robert Walser&quot;, a series of artistic responses to Walser&#x27;s work was published, including work by Moyra Davey, Thomas Schütte, Tacita Dean and Mark Wallinger.

== Robert Walser Center ==

The Robert Walser Center, which was officially established in Bern, Switzerland, in 2009, is dedicated to Robert Walser and the first patron of Walser&#x27;s work and legacy, Carl Seelig. Its purpose is to promulgate Walser&#x27;s life and work as well as to facilitate scholarly research. The center is open to both experts and the general public and includes an extensive archive, a research library, temporary exhibition space, and two rooms with several workstations are also available. The Center furthermore develops and organizes exhibitions, events, conferences, workshops, publications, and special editions. The translation of Robert Walser&#x27;s works, which the Center both encourages and supports, also represents a key focus. In order to fully meet its objectives and responsibilities as a center of excellence, it often collaborates on certain projects with local, national, and international partners as well as universities, schools, theaters, museums, archives, translators, editors, and publishers.

<text>The Freer Gallery of Art is an art museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. focusing on Asian art. The Freer and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery together form the National Museum of Asian Art in the United States. The Freer and Sackler galleries house the largest Asian art research library in the country and contain art from East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Islamic world, the ancient Near East, and ancient Egypt, as well as a significant collection of American art.

The gallery is located on the south side of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., contiguous with the Sackler Gallery. The museum is open 364 days a year (being closed on Christmas), and is administered by a single staff with the Sackler Gallery. The galleries were among the most visited art museums in the world.

The Freer houses over 26,000 objects spanning 6,000 years of history from the Neolithic to modern eras. The collections include ancient Egyptian stone sculpture and wooden objects, ancient Near Eastern ceramics and metalware, Chinese paintings and ceramics, Korean pottery and porcelain, Japanese folding screens, Persian manuscripts, and Buddhist sculpture. In addition to Asian art, the Freer also contains the famous &quot;Harmony in Blue and Gold: The Peacock Room&quot; (better known as &quot;The Peacock Room&quot;) by American artist James McNeill Whistler which serves as the centerpiece to the Freer&#x27;s American art collection.

The museum offers free tours to the public and presents a full schedule events for the public including films, lectures, symposia, concerts, performances, and discussions. Over 11,000 objects from the Freer|Sackler collections are fully searchable and available online. The Freer was also featured in the Google Art Project, which offers online viewers close-up views of selected items from the Freer.

==History==
===Founding===
The gallery was founded by Detroit railroad-car manufacturer and self-taught connoisseur Charles Lang Freer. He owned the largest collection of works by American artist James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) and became a patron and friend of the famously irascible artist. Whistler made it very clear to Freer that if he helped him to build the premier Whistler collection, then that collection would have to be displayed in a city where tourists went.

In 1908, Charles Moore, a former aide to Michigan United States Senator, James McMillin and the chairman of the United States Commission of Fine Arts, moved from Washington, D.C., to Detroit. Moore became friends with Freer, who was director of the Michigan Car Company, and persuaded Freer to permanently exhibit his 8,000-piece collection of Oriental art in Washington, D.C. Before then, Freer informally proposed to President Theodore Roosevelt that he give to the nation his art collection, funds to construct a building, and an endowment fund to provide for the study and acquisition of &quot;very fine examples of Oriental, Egyptian, and Near Eastern fine arts.&quot;

The Freer gift was accepted on behalf of the government by the Smithsonian Board of Regents in 1906. Freer&#x27;s will, however, contained certain requirements that only objects from the permanent collection could be exhibited in the gallery, and that none of the art could be exhibited elsewhere. Freer felt strongly that all of the museum&#x27;s holding should be readily accessible to scholars at all times. In addition, Freer&#x27;s bequest to the Smithsonian came with the proviso that he would execute full curatorial control over the collection until his death. The Smithsonian initially hesitated at the requirements but the intercession of President Theodore Roosevelt allowed for the project to proceed. The Freer Gallery possesses an autographed letter from Roosevelt inviting Freer to visit him at the White House, reflecting the personal interest Roosevelt showed in the development of the museum. Freer died before the art gallery was completed.

===Construction and architecture===

Construction of the gallery began in 1916 and was completed in 1921, after a delay due to World War I. On May 9, 1923, the Freer Gallery of Art was opened to the public. Designed by American architect and landscape planner Charles A. Platt, the Freer is an Italian Renaissance-style building inspired by Freer&#x27;s visits to palazzos in Italy. It is reported that in a meeting with architect Charles Platt at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, Freer jotted down his ideas for a classical, well-proportioned building on a napkin. The gallery is constructed primarily of granite: the exterior of the Freer is pink granite quarried in Milford, Massachusetts, the courtyard has a carnelian granite fountain and walls of unpolished Tennessee white marble. The gallery&#x27;s interior walls are Indiana limestone, and the floors are polished Tennessee marble.

A major renovation of the building, which culminated in a grand reopening in 1993, greatly expanded storage and exhibition space by connecting the Freer and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. With the addition of the connecting gallery, the Freer has of public space. The original structure designed by Platt remains intact, including the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Auditorium which serves as the venue for many public programs.

=== Current ===
After opening in 1923, the Freer served as the Smithsonian&#x27;s first museum dedicated to the fine arts. The Freer was also the first Smithsonian museum created from a private collector&#x27;s bequest. Through the years, the collections have grown through gifts and purchases to nearly triple the size of Freer&#x27;s original donation: nearly 18,000 works of Asian art have been added since Freer&#x27;s death in 1919.

The Freer is now connected by an underground exhibition space to the neighboring Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. Although their collections are stored and exhibited separately, the two museums share a director, administration, and staff. The Freer closed for extensive renovations in January 2016 and reopened in October 2017.

==Exhibitions==


Because one of the main conditions of Charles Lang Freer donation stated that only items from his collection may be exhibited at the gallery, the Freer does not borrow from or lend out items to other institutions. However, due to the 26,000 objects in the gallery&#x27;s collections, they are still able to present exhibitions internationally recognized for both depth and quality.

The Freer also has a number of rotating/temporary exhibits.

==American art at the Freer==

Freer began collecting American art in the 1880s. In 1890, after meeting James Abbott McNeill Whistler, an American artist influenced by Japanese prints and Chinese ceramics, Freer began to expand his collections to include Asian art. He maintained his interest in American art, however, amassing a collection of over 1,300 works by Whistler, which is considered the world&#x27;s finest.

One of the most well-known exhibits at the Freer is &quot;The Peacock Room&quot;, an opulent London dining room painted by Whistler in 1876–77. The room was designed for British shipping magnate F. R. Leyland and is lavishly decorated with green and gold peacock motifs. Purchased by Freer in 1904 and installed in the Freer Gallery after his death, &quot;The Peacock Room&quot; is on permanent display. During its time in the Freer Gallery, the Peacock Room underwent large-scale conservation projects in the 1940s and the early 1990s, and a major restoration in the summer of 2022.

The Freer also has works by Thomas Dewing (1851–1938), Dwight Tryon (1849–1925), Abbott Handerson Thayer (1849–1921), Childe Hassam (1859–1935), Winslow Homer (1836–1910), Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848–1907), Willard Metcalf (1858–1925), John Singer Sargent (1856–1925), and John Twachtman (1853–1902).

==F|S Online==

The Freer|Sackler provides several online resources for exploring the art and culture of Asia and its American art collections. Besides the collections objects viewable online, thousands of photographs, archeological diaries, maps, and archaeological squeezes (impressions of carvings) have been digitized and are used by researchers from around the world.

==F|S Archives and Library==
The Freer Sackler Archives houses over 120 important manuscripts collections relevant to the study of America&#x27;s encounter with Asian art and culture. The core collection is the personal papers of gallery founder Charles Lang Freer, which includes his purchase records, diaries, and personal correspondence with public figures such as artists, dealers and collectors. Freer&#x27;s extensive correspondence with James McNeill Whistler forms one of the largest sources of primary documents about the American artist. Other significant collections in the Archives includes the papers (notebooks, letters, photography, squeezes) and personal objects of the German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld (1879–1946), documenting his research at Samarra, Persepolis and Pasargadae. The papers of Carl Whiting Bishop Dwight William Tryon, Myron Bement Smith, Benjamin March and Henri Vever are also located at the Archives. The Archives also holds over 125,000 photographs of Asia dating from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Highlights of photographic holdings include the Henry and Nancy Rosin Collection of 19th century photography of Japan, the 1903-1904 photographs of the Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi, and photographs of Iran by Antoin Sevruguin.

The Freer|Sackler Library is the largest Asian art research library in the United States. Open to the public five days a week (except federal holidays) without appointment, the library collection consists of more than 86,000 volumes, including nearly 2,000 rare books. Half the volumes are written and catalogued in Asian languages.
Originating from the collection of four thousand monographs, periodical issues, offprints, and sales catalogues that Charles Lang Freer donated to the Smithsonian Institution as part of his gift to the nation, the F|S Library maintains the highest standards for collecting materials an active program of purchases, gifts, and exchanges.

In July 1987 the library moved to its new home in the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. Today it supports activities of both museums, such as collection development, exhibition planning, publications, and other scholarly and educational projects. Its published and unpublished resources—in the fields of Asian art and archaeology, conservation, painting, sculpture, architecture, drawings, prints, manuscripts, books, and photography—are available to museum staff, outside researchers, and the visiting public.

==Public programs==
The Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Auditorium, named after American financier and publisher Eugene Meyer and journalist/social activist Agnes E. Meyer, is located in the Freer and provides a venue for a broad variety of free public programs. These programs include concerts of music and dance, lectures, chamber music, and dramatic presentations. It is also known for its film series, highlighting a wide variety of Asian cultures (including a Korean Film Festival and Iranian Film Festival).

Most recently, the museums began the series Asia After Dark, opening up the space for musicians, dancing, Asian cuisine, and other after-work adventures. The Freer and Sackler&#x27;s &#x27;We Stand With Japan&#x27; in 2011 hosted Steve Aoki.

Free drop-in tours are available daily and guide visitors through both featured exhibitions and specific themes in both the Freer and Sackler galleries, and a wide range of public lectures provide in-depth experiences with prominent artists and scholars.

==Conservation==
Care of the collections began before the museum came into existence as Charles Lang Freer, the founder of the Freer Gallery of Art, hired Japanese painting restorers to care for his works and to prepare them for their eventual home as part of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1932, the Freer Gallery of Art hired a full-time Japanese restorer and established what was to become the East Asian Painting Conservation Studio. This facility remains one of the few in the United States that specializes in the conservation of Asian paintings. The Technical Laboratory was established in 1951 when chemist Rutherford J. Gettens moved from the Fogg Museum at Harvard University to the Freer. The laboratory was the first Smithsonian facility devoted to the use of scientific methods for the study of works of art. Over the years, the work of the Technical Laboratory expanded to include objects, paper, and exhibits conservation. The Technical Laboratory and the East Asian Painting Conservation Studio merged in 1990 to create the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research for both the Freer and Sackler Galleries.

The conservators in the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research care for and treat works of art in the collection and prepare them for exhibition. The department works to ensure long-term preservation and storage, safe handling, exhibition, and transport of artworks in the permanent collection, as well as those on loan. In addition, conservators are responsible for conducting technical examinations of objects already in the collection and those under consideration for acquisition. They also collaborate frequently with the department&#x27;s scientists on technical and applied research. Training and professional outreach efforts are an integral part of the department&#x27;s commitment to educating future conservators, museum professionals, and the public about conservation.

==Scholarship==
The Freer has had a long tradition in serving as a center for inquiry and advanced scholarship about Asia. The Freer not only presents lectures and symposia to the public, but it also copublishes the Ars Orientalis with the University of Michigan Department of History of Art. &quot;Ars Orientalis&quot; is a peer-reviewed annual volume of scholarly articles and occasional reviews of books on the art and archaeology of Asia, the ancient Near East, and the Islamic world.

The Freer and Sackler, along with the Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies in Kyoto, Japan, presents the Shimada Prize for distinguished scholarship in the history of East Asian art. The award was established in 1992 in honor of Professor Shimada Shujiro, by the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and by The Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies in Kyoto, Japan. Several fellowships are also available to support graduate students and visiting scholars, including the Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship, Anne Van Biema Fellowship (Japanese Visual Arts), Iran Heritage Foundation (IHF) Fellowship (Persian art), Lunder Fellowship, J. S. Lee Memorial Fellowship (Chinese Art), Smithsonian Institution Fellowship, and the Freer Fellowship.

Freer and Sackler curators are also involved in dozens of ongoing research projects, often with colleagues from institutions around the world. The results of their work can be seen in a variety of published formats, including exhibition catalogues, scholarly publications, and online publications.

<doc id="1052396" wikidata="Q230150" url="?curid=1052396" title="2 Esdras">
<text>2 Esdras, also called 4 Esdras, Latin Esdras, or Latin Ezra, is an apocalyptic book in some English versions of the Bible. Tradition ascribes it to Ezra, a scribe and priest of the fifth century BC, whom the book identifies with the sixth-century figure Shealtiel.

2 Esdras forms a part of the canon of Scripture in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (an Oriental Orthodoxy body), though it is reckoned among the apocrypha by Roman Catholics and Protestants. Within Eastern Orthodoxy it forms a part of the canon although its usage varies by different traditions. 2 Esdras was excluded by Jerome from his Vulgate version of the Old Testament, but from the 9th century onward, the Latin text is sporadically found as an appendix to the Vulgate, inclusion becoming more general after the 13th century.

==Naming conventions==

As with 1 Esdras, some confusion exists about the numbering of this book. The Vulgate of Jerome includes only a single book of Ezra, but in the Clementine Vulgate, 1, 2, 3 and 4 Esdras are separate books. Protestant writers, after the Geneva Bible, called 1 and 2 Esdras of the Vulgate Ezra and Nehemiah, respectively, and called 3 and 4 Esdras of the Vulgate 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras, respectively. These then became the common names for these books in English Bibles.

Medieval Latin manuscripts denoted it 4 Esdras, which to this day is the name used for chapters 3–14 in modern critical editions, which are typically in Latin, the language of its most complete exemplars.

It appears in the Appendix to the Old Testament in the Slavonic Bible, where it is called 3 Esdras, and the Georgian Orthodox Bible numbers it 3 Ezra. This text is sometimes also known as Apocalypse of Ezra — chapters 3–14 known as the Jewish Apocalypse of Ezra or 4 Ezra; in modern critical editions, chapters 1–2 are named as 5 Ezra, and chapters 15–16 as 6 Ezra.

Bogaert speculates that the &quot;fourth book of Ezra&quot; referred to by Jerome most likely corresponds to modern 5 Ezra and 6 Ezra combined, and notes a number of Latin manuscripts where these chapters are together in an appendix.

==Contents==

===5 Ezra===
The first two chapters of 2 Esdras are found only in the Latin version of the book, and are called 5 Ezra by scholars. They are considered by most scholars to be Christian in origin; they assert God&#x27;s rejection of the Jews and describe a vision of the Son of God. These are generally considered to be late additions (possibly third century) to the work.

===4 Ezra===
Chapters 3–14, or the great bulk of 2 Esdras, is a Jewish apocalypse, also sometimes known as 4 Ezra or the Jewish Apocalypse of Ezra. The latter name should not be confused with a later work called the &quot;Greek Apocalypse of Ezra&quot;.

The Ethiopian Church considers 4 Ezra to be canonical, written during the Babylonian captivity, and calls it Izra Sutuel (ዕዝራ ሱቱኤል). It was also often cited by the Fathers of the Church. In the Eastern Armenian tradition, it is called 3 Ezra. It was written in the late following the destruction of the Second Temple.

Among Greek Fathers of the Church, 4 Ezra is generally cited as Προφήτης Ἔσδρας &quot;Prophetes Esdras&quot; (&quot;The Prophet Ezra&quot;) or Ἀποκάλυψις Ἔσδρα &quot;Apokalupsis Esdra&quot; (&quot;Apocalypse of Ezra&quot;). Most scholars agree that 4 Ezra was composed in Hebrew, which was translated into Greek, and then to Latin, Armenian, Ethiopian, and Georgian, but the Hebrew and Greek editions have been lost.

Slightly differing Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopic, Georgian, and Armenian translations have survived in their entirety; the Greek version can be reconstructed, though without absolute certainty, from these different translations, while the Hebrew text remains more elusive. The modern Slavonic version is translated from the Latin.
4 Ezra consists of seven visions of Ezra the scribe. The first vision takes place as Ezra is still in Babylon. He asks God how Israel can be kept in misery if God is just. The archangel Uriel is sent to answer the question, responding that God&#x27;s ways cannot be understood by the human mind. Soon, however, the end would come, and God&#x27;s justice would be made manifest. Similarly, in the second vision, Ezra asks why Israel was delivered up to the Babylonians, and is again told that man cannot understand this and that the end is near. In the third vision, Ezra asks why Israel does not possess the world. Uriel responds that the current state is a period of transition. Here follows a description of the fate of evil-doers and the righteous. Ezra asks whether the righteous may intercede for the unrighteous on Judgment Day, but is told that &quot;Judgment Day is final&quot;.

The next three visions are more symbolic in nature. The fourth is of a woman mourning for her only son. She is transformed into a city when she hears of the desolation of Zion. Uriel says that the woman is a symbol of Zion. The fifth vision concerns an eagle with three heads and 20 wings (12 large wings and eight smaller wings &quot;over against them&quot;). The eagle is rebuked by a lion and then burned. The explanation of this vision is that the eagle refers to the fourth kingdom of the vision of Daniel, with the wings and heads as rulers. The final scene is the triumph of the Messiah over the empire. The sixth vision is of a man, representing the Messiah, who breathes fire on a crowd that is attacking him. This man then turns to another peaceful multitude, which accepts him.

Finally, a vision of the restoration of scripture is related. God appears to Ezra in a bush and commands him to restore the Law. Ezra gathers five scribes and begins to dictate. After 40 days, he has produced 204 books, including 70 works to be published last. 2 Esdras 14:44–48 KJV:

44 In forty days they wrote two hundred and four books.

45 And it came to pass, when the forty days were filled, that the Highest spake, saying, The first that thou hast written publish openly, that the worthy and unworthy may read it:

46 But keep the seventy last, that thou mayest deliver them only to such as be wise among the people:

47 For in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of knowledge.

48 And I did so.

The &quot;seventy&quot; might refer to the Septuagint, most of the apocrypha, or the lost books that are described in the Bible. But it is more probable that the number is just symbolic. 

Almost all Latin editions of the text have a large lacuna of 70 verses between 7:35 and 7:36 that is missing because they trace their common origin to one early manuscript, &quot;Codex Sangermanensis I&quot;, from which an entire page had been cut out very early in its history. In 1875 Robert Lubbock Bensly published the lost verses and in 1895 M.R. James oversaw a critical edition from Bensly&#x27;s notes restoring the lost verses from the complete text found in the &quot;Codex Colbertinus&quot;; this edition is used in the Stuttgart edition of the Vulgate. The restored verses are numbered 7:35 to 7:105, with the former verses 7:36–7:70 renumbered to 7:106–7:140. For more information, see the article &quot;Codex Sangermanensis I&quot;.

Second Esdras turns around a radical spiritual conversion of Ezra in a vision, where he stops to comfort a sobbing woman who turns instantly into a great city (2 Esd. 10:25–27). On this pivotal event, one scholar writes that Ezra:

is badly frightened, he loses consciousness and calls for his angelic guide. The experience described is unique, not just in 4 Ezra, but in the whole Jewish apocalyptic literature. Its intensity complements the pressure of unrelieved stress evident in the first part of the vision, and it resembles the major orientation of personality usually connected with religious conversion.

The following verses (10:28–59) reveal that Ezra had a vision of the heavenly Jerusalem, the true city of Zion, which the angel of the Lord invites him to explore. As the angel tells Ezra at the end of Chapter 10 in the Authorised Version:

&lt;poem&gt;And therefore fear not,
 let not thine heart be affrighted,
but go thy way in,
 and see the beauty and greatness of the building,
as much as thine eyes be able to see;
 and then shalt thou hear as much as thine ears may comprehend.
For thou art blessed above many other
 and art called with the Highest and so are but few.&lt;/poem&gt;

But tomorrow at night thou shalt remain here and so shall the Highest show thee visions of the high things which the Most High will do unto them that dwell upon earth in the last days.

So I slept that night and another like as he commanded me (2 Esd. 10:55–59).

===6 Ezra===
The last two chapters, also called 6 Ezra by scholars, and found in the Latin, but not in the Eastern texts, predict wars and rebuke sinners. Many assume that they probably date from a much later period (perhaps late third century) and may be Christian in origin; though not certain, they possibly were added at the same time as the first two chapters of the Latin version. They likely are Jewish in origin, however; 15:57–59 have been found in Greek, which most scholars agree was translated from a Hebrew original.

==Author and criticism==
The main body of the book appears to be written for consolation in a period of great distress (one scholarly hypothesis is that it dates to Titus&#x27; destruction of the Second Temple in ). The author seeks answers, similar to Job&#x27;s quest for understanding the meaning of suffering, but the author does not like or desire only the answer that was given to Job.

Critics question whether even the main body of the book, not counting the chapters that exist only in the Latin version and in Greek fragments, has a single author. Kalisch, De Faye, and Charles hold that no fewer than five people worked on the text. However, Gunkel points to the unity in character and holds that the book is written by a single author; the author of 2 Esdras has also been suggested to have written the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch. In any case, the two texts may date from about the same time, and one almost certainly depends on the other.

Critics have widely debated the origin of the book. Hidden under two layers of translation, determining whether the author was Roman, Alexandrian, or Judean is impossible.

The scholarly interpretation of the eagle being the Roman Empire (the eagle in the fifth vision, whose heads might be Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian if such is the case) and the destruction of the temple would indicate that the probable date of composition lies toward the end of the first century, perhaps 90–96, though some suggest a date as late as 218.

==Usage==
The book is found in the Orthodox Slavonic Bible (Ostrog Bible, Elizabeth Bible, and later consequently Russian Synodal Bible). 2 Esdras is in the Apocrypha of the King James Version, and Pope Clement VIII placed it in an appendix to the Vulgate along with 3 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh &quot;lest they perish entirely&quot;. The chapters corresponding to 4 Ezra, i.e. 2 Esdras 3–14, make up the &quot;Book of II Izra&quot;, aka &quot;Izra Sutuel&quot;, canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church; it was also widely cited by early Fathers of the Church, particularly Ambrose of Milan, as the &#x27;third book of Esdras&#x27;. Jerome states that it is apocryphal. It may also be found in many larger English Bibles included as part of the Biblical apocrypha, as they exist in the King James Version, the Revised Version, the Revised Standard Version, and the earliest editions of the Catholic Douay–Rheims Bible, among others.

The &quot;introitus&quot; of the traditional Requiem Mass of the Extraordinary Form of the 1962 Missal in the Catholic Church is loosely based on 2:34–35: &quot;Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them.&quot; Several other liturgical prayers are taken from the book. The same chapter, verses 36 and 37, is cited in the Introit of Pentecost Tuesday, &quot;&quot;Accipite jucunditatem gloriae vestrae, alleluia: gratias agentes Deo, alleluia: qui vos ad caelestia regna vocavit, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia&quot;. Ps. 77 &quot;Attendite, popule meus, legem meam: inclinate aurem vestram in verba oris mei. Gloria Patri. Accipite&quot;. – Receive the delight of your glory, alleluia, giving thanks to God, alleluia, Who hath called ye to the heavenly kingdoms, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. Psalm 77 Attend, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. Glory be. Receive.” The Alleluia verse &quot;Crastina die&quot; for the Vigil Mass of Christmas in the Roman Missal is taken from chapter 16, verse 52.

Christopher Columbus quoted verse 6:42, which describes the Earth as being created with six parts land and one part water, in his appeal to the Catholic Monarchs for financial support for his first voyage of exploration.

The book is appointed as a scripture reading in the Ordinariate’s Evensong service for All Hallows&#x27; Eve.

The work is included in the NRSV-based &quot;Renovaré Spiritual Formation Bible&quot;.

<text>The Federal Prison Camp, Alderson (FPC Alderson) is a minimum-security United States federal prison for female inmates in West Virginia. It is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice.

FPC Alderson is in two West Virginia counties, near the town of Alderson. A portion of the prison is in unincorporated Monroe County, while the other portion of the prison, including the dormitories, is in unincorporated Summers County. The majority of the prison is in Summers County. Four other area towns, Hinton, Lewisburg, Ronceverte, and White Sulphur Springs, are within commuting distance of FPC Alderson.

==History==

In the 1920s, there was a shortage of federal prison space for female inmates. Women offenders either were given alternative punishments or were housed alone within all-male institutions. Prison staff and fellow inmates sexually exploited girls and women who were incarcerated in these facilities.

Mabel Walker Willebrandt, then an Assistant U.S. Attorney General, first encouraged establishment of a facility for women. FPC Alderson, which opened on April 30, 1927, as the Federal Industrial Institute for Women, was the first federal women&#x27;s prison in the United States. It was opened during a reform movement in the 1920s to help reform female offenders.

The first warden, Mary B. Harris, was chosen by Willebrandt. Despite later bureau mythology that Alderson opened its doors with moonshining women from the hills of West Virginia, 174 women had been sent to the facility in the first year of operation before its formal November 14, 1928, opening. The West Virginia location was chosen as it was remote enough from major population centers to reduce potential escapes, while it was reasonably close to the U.S. capital. The vast majority of the women were imprisoned for drug and alcohol charges imposed during the Prohibition era.

Esther Heffernan, a sociology professor at Edgewood College, said that throughout history the inmates included &quot;relatives of famous mobsters and grandmotherly women who embezzled money from banks. You&#x27;ve had a real mixture.&quot; Hefferman added that in Alderson, which was a &quot;not undesirable&quot; place to be confined, the isolation from urban life could be stressful for inmates. She said that the inmates, &quot;Coming from the streets of New York and D.C.,&quot; were awakened at night by crickets and frogs. 

Most of the inmates at FPC Alderson have been convicted of non-violent or white-collar crime. Many are in the drug program and have come from other prisons to attend the program at Alderson. 

==Facility==

FPC Alderson is a facility and is the largest employer in the Alderson, West Virginia area. The prison is about a five-hour driving distance from Washington, D.C.

Serving as a model for prison reform at the time, the facility was styled after a boarding school, offering education with no armed guards. The facility followed a reformatory model with no fenced grounds. The prison consisted of primarily work-oriented facilities designed for minor federal offenders. It originally consisted of 14 cottages built in a horseshoe pattern on two-tiered slopes. The offenders were segregated by race in the cottages and each building contained a kitchen and rooms for about 30 women. 

While there is no barbed wire on the fence surrounding the camp, the prisoners have schedules and each one must work. Inmates get holidays off except those who work in the powerhouse and kitchen. From its beginning, Alderson&#x27;s staff members have maintained a focus on vocational training and personal growth experiences, with craft-shop activities an integral part of vocational training. 

Free time is spent walking around the sidewalk that is set between the two dorms as this is within bounds for the inmates. Since 2004 inmates are no longer free to roam the entire campus and are restricted in areas of the prison. They also play recreational activities such as volleyball.

John Benish, the former co-manager of the Alderson Hospitality House, a hospitality establishment where families of Alderson inmates stay when visiting, said that FPC Alderson is &quot;built like a college campus. There is lot of property, a lot of greenery and there is no barbed wire around.&quot; 

The Alderson facility includes two dormitories with 500 inmates each. Inmates live in two-person cubicles instead of traditional barred prison cells, and sleep in bunk beds. The cubicles are , separated by cinder-blocks.

The prison was nicknamed &quot;Camp Cupcake&quot; by members of the news media when Martha Stewart was sentenced to a five-month term there and was referred to as &quot;Yale&quot; by Stewart herself. Local residents have also referred to it as &quot;the college campus.&quot; 

By 2004, according to Alexandra Marks of &quot;The Independent&quot;, the operating model for Alderson followed &quot;a punitive rather than a rehabilitative model&quot;. As of 2004, most prisoners at Alderson were convicted of recreational drug-related offenses. Prisoners are not permitted to patronize Alderson-area businesses.

The facility allows weekend visits, but special hours are available for holidays. In prior years the families of inmates were allowed past visiting rooms only on Thanksgiving Day when they could also share in a holiday feast for $1.75.

FPC Alderson was one of six federal and state prisons participating in the Paws4prisons service dog training program. This program allowed inmates the opportunity to interact and work with dogs. This included an academic curriculum where inmates first learned how to train &quot;shelter-rescue dogs&quot; and then progressed to developing highly trained assistance dogs.

<text>The Little Brown Jug is a trophy contested between the Michigan Wolverines football team of the University of Michigan and the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team of the University of Minnesota. The Little Brown Jug is an earthenware jug that serves as a trophy awarded to the winner of the game. It is one of the oldest and most played rivalries in American college football, dating to 1892. The Little Brown Jug is the most regularly exchanged rivalry trophy in college football, the oldest trophy game in FBS college football, and the second oldest rivalry trophy overall, next to the 1899 Territorial Cup (which did not become a travelling/exchange trophy until 2001), contested between Arizona and Arizona State (which did not become a four-year college until 1925).

Both universities are founding members of the Big Ten Conference. As a result of the Big Ten not playing a complete round-robin schedule, Michigan and Minnesota occasionally did not play. In 2011, with the conference&#x27;s initiation of divisional play, Michigan and Minnesota were both placed in the Big Ten&#x27;s Legends division under the new two-division alignment. However, when the conference expanded again three years later, the teams were split into opposite divisions (Michigan in the East, Minnesota in the West). The conference stated there will be only one protected crossover matchup under the new alignment (Indiana vs. Purdue for the Old Oaken Bucket), meaning the rivalry will not be contested every year.

With the addition of UCLA, USC, Oregon and Washington to the Big Ten Conference in 2024, the fate of this continued rivalry is up in the air, as Michigan and Minnesota were not classified as Protected Opponents, and are currently scheduled for both a home and away game against each other in 2024 and 2025.

Michigan is the current holder of the jug with a 27–24 victory on September 28, 2024. Through the end of the 2024 season, Michigan leads the series, 78–25–3.

==Series history==
===Pre-Brown Jug===
The teams met for the first time in 1892 in Minneapolis, with Minnesota prevailing 14–6. Michigan and Minnesota played five more games over the next decade, Michigan winning four of those five.

===1903 game===

The earthenware jug, originally used by Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost, is painted with the victories of each team. The name most likely originates in the 1869 song of the same name by Joseph Winner.

After Yost took over coaching the Wolverines in 1901, the team went on to win 28 straight games. In the meantime, Minnesota had been assembling teams themselves, and Gopher fans were excited about possibly ending the Wolverines&#x27; streak.

When Yost and the team came into Minneapolis for the 1903 game, student manager Thomas B. Roberts was told to purchase something to carry water. Yost was somewhat concerned that Gopher fans might contaminate his water supply. Roberts purchased a five-gallon jug for 30¢ from a local variety store in Dinkytown. The jug itself is known as a Red Wing Pottery &quot;five gallon beehive jug&quot;, and was made in Red Wing, Minnesota.

Twenty thousand fans watched the matchup between the two teams in an overflowing Northrop Field. Minnesota held the &quot;point-a-minute&quot; squad to just one touchdown, but hadn&#x27;t yet managed to score themselves. Finally, late in the second half, the Gophers reached the endzone to tie the game at 6. As clouds from an impending storm hung overhead, Minnesota fans stormed the field in celebration. Order could not be restored and the game had to be called with two minutes remaining. The Wolverines walked off the field, leaving the jug behind in the locker room of the University of Minnesota Armory.

The next day custodian Oscar Munson brought the jug to L. J. Cooke, head of the Minnesota athletics department, and declared in a thick Scandinavian accent: &quot;Yost left his jug.&quot; Exactly how Munson came to possess the jug is a mystery. Some accounts say that Munson purposely stole the jug in the chaos that ended the game, although most believe it was accidentally left behind. Thomas Roberts, writing in 1956, stated that the jug had served its purpose, so he intentionally left it sitting on the field.

Still, Cooke and Munson were excited to have this bit of memorabilia, proceeding to paint it brown (it had originally been putty-colored and currently is painted half blue, which is Michigan&#x27;s color) and commemorate the day by writing &quot;Michigan Jug –; Captured by Oscar, October 31, 1903&quot; on the side along with the score &quot;Michigan 6, Minnesota 6&quot;. Minnesota&#x27;s score was written many times larger than that of Michigan.

When the two schools met in football again in 1909, Cooke and the Minnesota team captain decided that playing for the jug &quot;might be material to build up a fine tradition between the two institutions.&quot; When presented with this idea, Yost and Michigan&#x27;s captain agreed, and has been a travelling trophy since. Michigan took home the jug in 1909 and 1910. Minnesota and Michigan met up again in 1919 after Michigan rejoined the Big Ten Conference, marking the first year that Minnesota won the jug outright.

===Other notable games===

&quot;The Battle of Giants&quot; occurred in 1940, with undefeated Minnesota facing undefeated Michigan on November 9, 1940. Minnesota won 7–6. Minnesota went on to go 8–0 and win the national championship.

In 1977, Minnesota stunned #1 Michigan 16–0; it was the only loss of the regular season for the Wolverines as they advanced to (and lost) the 1978 Rose Bowl to the Washington Huskies 27-20.

In 1986, Minnesota was regarded as an easy victory for #2 Michigan as a 25-point underdog. With two minutes to go and the game tied at 17, Minnesota quarterback Rickey Foggie scrambled to put Chip Lohmiller in position to kick the winning field goal. The Gophers took home the Little Brown Jug from Michigan for the first time since 1977. Similarly, it was Michigan&#x27;s only loss in the regular season on their way to losing the 1987 Rose Bowl.

The 2003 game was one of the most highly anticipated Michigan–Minnesota matchups in years. This was the 100th Anniversary of the 1903 game. The Little Brown Jug was featured on the cover of the Michigan Football Media Guide. Minnesota was ranked #17 and Michigan was ranked #20 with the game at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Down 28–7, Michigan put together a comeback in the fourth quarter to win 38–35. Michigan advanced to (and lost) the 2004 Rose Bowl. The next season, in another highly anticipated game, #14 Michigan came back again in the fourth quarter to defeat #13 Minnesota 27–24. Michigan advanced to (and lost) the 2005 Rose Bowl. In 2013, the 2003 game was singled out as one of the biggest setbacks to the Gopher football team rebuilding since their last Big Ten Championship in 1967.

Michigan has dominated the series since 1968, during which Minnesota has held the jug only four times. On October 8, 2005, Minnesota claimed the jug for the first time since 1986, defeating Michigan 23–20 on a last second field goal in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Wolverines grabbed the trophy right back the next year on September 30, with a 28–14 victory in Minneapolis.

Michigan won all 12 meetings with Minnesota at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which the Gophers shared with the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Vikings from 1982 through 2008. To date, Michigan has not lost a road game against the Gophers since 1977 and have won the last 17 games between the teams in Minnesota. The Gophers last defeated Michigan 30–14 in 2014, ending a six-game win streak by Michigan.

<doc id="1052414" wikidata="Q365824" url="?curid=1052414" title="Eli Heckscher">
<text>Eli Filip Heckscher (24 November 1879 – 23 December 1952) was a Swedish political economist and economic historian who was a professor at the Stockholm School of Economics.

He is known for the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem, an influential model of international trade that predicts that capital-abundant countries export capital-intensive goods, while labor-abundant countries export the labor-intensive goods.

==Biography==
Heckscher was born in Stockholm, son of the Jewish Danish-born businessman Isidor Heckscher and his spouse Rosa Meyer, and completed his secondary education there in 1896. He conducted higher studies at Uppsala University (from 1897) and Gothenburg University College (in 1898), completing his PhD in Uppsala in 1907. He was professor of Political economy and Statistics at the Stockholm School of Economics from 1909 until 1919, when he exchanged that chair for a research professorship in economic history, finally retiring as emeritus professor in 1945. In 1929 Heckscher founded the Institute for Economic and Business History Research as a key step in his effort to create the field of economic history in Sweden, and make it a policy-oriented science. He advanced his agenda by recruiting two other scholars, historian Bertil Boëthius (1885–1974) and economist Arthur Montgomery. Thereby the &quot;Stockholm School&quot; emerged and achieved a voice in government planning.

Prior to World War I, Heckscher was a social conservative who advocated for an interventionist state. During World War I, his attitudes shifted, as he became a proponent of economic liberalism and a staunch opponent of state interventionism.

Heckscher is well known for his 1935 book &quot;Mercantilism&quot;, which was translated into several languages. He is also known for multi-volume &quot;An Economic History of Sweden&quot;.

Heckscher&#x27;s most important work, though, is his 1919 article “The Effect of Foreign Trade on the Distribution of Income.&quot; In this article, Heckscher provided a model explaining patterns in international trade now known as the (Heckscher–Ohlin model). Heckscher&#x27;s &quot;The Effect of Foreign Trade on the Distribution of Income&quot; was groundbreaking but originally gained little attention for several reasons. First, Hecksher published the article in the Swedish journal &quot;Ekonomisk Tidskrift&quot; in Swedish, a language with comparatively less international access. Second, even those reading Swedish and following Hecksher may have overlooked this particular article at first since Heckscher was so prolific (he published 1148 articles and books). Finally, Heckscher was a Jew which was a factor because, just as the significance of the article became apparent beyond Sweden, the rise of anti-Semitism globally and Nazism bans on Jewish authors arguably delayed its greater recognition until after World War II. Heckscher&#x27;s famous former student Bertil Ohlin at the Stockholm School of Economics (who himself succeeded Heckscher as professor there), significantly expanded on Hecksher&#x27;s theory, giving it more support and a wider audience. Ohlin won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1977 long after Heckscher&#x27;s death.

Heckscher was a member of the American Philosophical Society.

== Heckscher–Ohlin theorem ==

The Heckscher–Ohlin Theorem, which is concluded from the Heckscher–Ohlin model of international trade, states: trade between countries is in proportion to their relative amounts of capital and labor. In countries with an abundance of capital, wage rates tend to be high; therefore, labor-intensive products, e.g. textiles, simple electronics, etc., are more costly to produce internally. In contrast, capital-intensive products, e.g. automobiles, chemicals, etc., are less costly to produce internally. Countries with large amounts of capital will export capital-intensive products and import labor-intensive products with the proceeds. Countries with high amounts of labor will do the reverse.

The following conditions must be true:
* The major factors of production, namely labor and capital, are not available in the same proportion in both countries.
* The two goods produced either require more capital or more labor.
* Labor and capital do not move between the two countries.
* There are no costs associated with transporting the goods between countries.
* The citizens of the two trading countries have the same needs.

The theory does not depend on total amounts of capital or labor, but on the amounts per worker. This allows small countries to trade with large countries by specializing in production of products that use the factors which are more available than its trading partner. The key assumption is that capital and labor are not available in the same proportions in the two countries. That leads to specialization, which in turn benefits the country&#x27;s economic welfare. The greater the difference between the two countries, the greater the gain from specialization.

==Personal life==
Eli Heckscher&#x27;s son was Gunnar Heckscher (1909–1987), a political scientist and the leader of what would later become the Swedish Moderate Party 1961–1965. His grandson is the Social Democratic politician Sten Heckscher.

<text>Claudine Auger (born Claudine Oger; 26 April 1941 – 18 December 2019) was a French actress best known for her role as a Bond girl, Dominique &quot;Domino&quot; Derval, in the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965). She earned the title of Miss France Monde 1958 (the French representative to the Miss World beauty pageant) and went on to finish as the first runner-up in the 1958 Miss World contest.

== Career ==
Born in Paris, France, Auger began her career as a model and earned the title of Miss France Monde 1958 (the French representative to the Miss World beauty pageant) and went on to finish as the first runner-up in the 1958 Miss World contest. Jean Cocteau cast Auger in an uncredited role as a tall ballerina in &quot;Testament of Orpheus&quot; (1960). When she was 18, she married the 43-year-old writer-director Pierre Gaspard-Huit, and he cast her in several films, including &quot;Le Masque de fer&quot; (1962) and &quot;Kali Yug: Goddess of Vengeance&quot; (1963).

In 1965 she was cast in the 1965 James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot;, directed by Terence Young. &quot;Thunderball&quot; launched Auger into a successful European movie career, but did little for her otherwise in the United States. Though she performed in the movie, her French accent was considered too strong and her voice was dubbed by another actress. She did, however, star in a Danny Thomas special called &quot;The Road to Lebanon&quot; with Bing Crosby, which was shown on NBC on 20 April 1966.

In 1966 she co-starred in the World War II drama &quot;Triple Cross&quot; with Yul Brynner and Christopher Plummer, that reunited her with her James Bond director Terence Young. Auger co-starred with another Bond girl, Ursula Andress, in the Italian comedy &quot;Anyone Can Play&quot; (1968). She starred with two future Bond girls, Barbara Bouchet and Barbara Bach, in &quot;Black Belly of the Tarantula&quot; (1971), a giallo mystery. She had major roles in films such as &quot;The Killing Game&quot; in 1967, &quot;Flic Story&quot; in 1972, and filmed scenes for &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; (1975), only to have her entire performance cut from the movie.

On television, she made an appearance in 1972 on the CBS series &quot;Medical Center&quot;. In the 1980s Auger starred &quot;The Man Who Married a French Wife&quot; which was broadcast on the BBC and shown as part of the &quot;Great Performances&quot; series that was broadcast on PBS in the United States. She also appeared in the 1994 British television series &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
In 1959, she married film director and screenwriter Pierre Gaspard-Huit. They later divorced in 1969. She married British businessman Peter Brent in 1984. He died in 2008. They had one child.

Auger died in Paris on 18 December 2019 following a lengthy illness.

<doc id="1052424" wikidata="Q706168" url="?curid=1052424" title="Conrad Helfrich">
<text>Lieutenant Admiral Conrad Emil Lambert Helfrich (11 October 1886 – 20 September 1962) of the Royal Netherlands Navy was a leading Dutch naval figure of World War II. He was born in Semarang.

==World War II==
Helfrich was appointed overall commander of all forces in the Netherlands East Indies in October 1939. At the outbreak of the war in the Pacific he gave instructions to wage war aggressively. His small force of submarines sank more Japanese ships in the first weeks of the war than the entire British and US navies together, an exploit which earned him the nickname &quot;Ship-a-day Helfrich&quot;. Admiral Helfrich worked tirelessly to establish co-operation with the Allied navies in the area since he knew that the Dutch could not hope to protect the Dutch East Indies by themselves.

===Java Sea===
When a combined command (ABDA) was finally created in January 1942, he was bypassed for the post of commander of the navy, in favour of Admiral Thomas C. Hart of the United States Navy. Helfrich&#x27;s mission to defend Java at all costs clashed with Hart&#x27;s desire to conserve as many naval units as possible. On 12 February 1942, Helfrich succeeded Hart as commander of the American–British–Dutch–Australian naval forces in the Pacific and immediately went on the offensive. The courage of the &quot;Striking Force&quot; was to no avail in the face of the overwhelming superiority of the Japanese navy and after the disastrous Battle of the Java Sea, most of the ABDA ships under his command had been put out of action and ABDA itself was dismantled. Helfrich spent the remainder of the war in Ceylon preparing the return of Dutch administration to the Dutch East Indies.

===Japanese surrender===

In 1945, he was given command of all Dutch naval forces and promoted to lieutenant admiral. On 2 September 1945, he signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender aboard the battleship on behalf of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Helfrich returned to the Dutch East Indies on 1 October 1945, where he commanded the Dutch forces in the Dutch East Indies until 24 January 1946 when the post of commander of the armed forces in the East was abolished. During that time, Commander Helfrich had to deal with the Indonesian struggle for independence. He was a fierce opponent of compromising with Sukarno and, supported by Chief of the General Staff Hendrik Johan Kruls, he objected to the Linggarjati Agreement of 15 December 1946, but without effect.

He remained in command until his retirement from the navy on 1 January 1949.

He wrote his memoirs which were published in 1950 and he died in The Hague, on 20 September 1962.

==Honours and awards==
For his services during the World War, Helfrich received several awards. He was Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau with Swords, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion, Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (UK) and awarded the Silver Cross (5th grade) of the Virtuti Militari (Poland). He had also received the Expedition Cross.

<doc id="1052431" wikidata="Q505653" url="?curid=1052431" title="Martín Alonso Pinzón">
<text>Martín Alonso Pinzón, (; Palos de la Frontera, Huelva; c. 1441 – c. 1493) was a Spanish mariner, shipbuilder, navigator and explorer, oldest of the Pinzón brothers. He sailed with Christopher Columbus on his first voyage to the New World in 1492, as captain of the &quot;Pinta&quot;. His youngest brother Vicente Yáñez Pinzón was captain of the &quot;Niña&quot;, and the middle brother Francisco Martín Pinzón was &quot;maestre&quot; (first mate) of the &quot;Pinta&quot;.

==The Pinzón family of Palos==

The Pinzón family was among the leading families of Palos de la Frontera in the late 15th century. There are several conflicting theories about the origin of the family and of their name (&quot;see Pinzón family&quot;). His grandfather was a sailor and diver known as &quot;Martín&quot;; it is not clear whether that was a first or last name, and whether in his generation &quot;Pinzón&quot; was a surname or an epithet. His father was a sailor named Martín Pinzón; his mother was named Mayor Vicente.

==Life==
Born in Palos around 1441, it appears that at quite a young age Pinzón shipped out on a locally based caravel as a &quot;grumete&quot; (cabin boy). His home, now the Casa Museo de Martín Alonso Pinzón, was on the old royal road to the Monastery of La Rábida. Martín&#x27;s family contracted a marriage with a resident of the locality named María Álvarez. They had five children: two boys—Arias Pérez and Juan, who participated in several expeditions to the Americas—and three girls—Mayor, Catalina, and Leonor. Leonor, the youngest, suffered frequent attacks of what was then called &quot;gota coral&quot; and would now be called epilepsy.

A French tradition holds that Alonso Pinzón sailed to the New World with the navigator Jean Cousin, and that together they discovered the continent in 1488, four years before Columbus. Back in Dieppe, Pinzón left Cousin in a dispute, and is claimed to have left for Spain, from where he advised Columbus on his westward sail. Pinzon is known to have displayed a remarkable confidence in guiding Columbus in his discovery of the New World. No indisputable written records remain, however, to support this early claim to discovery.

His nautical experience and his leadership remained patent in the 1508–1536 lawsuits known as the &quot;pleitos colombinos&quot; (&quot;Columbian lawsuits&quot;), where the witnesses indicated him as the leader of the &quot;comarca&quot; (a region comparable to a shire). He was also famous for his battles against the Portuguese in the War of the Castilian Succession. It is probable that even while in Portugal before coming to Spain, Columbus was aware of Martín Alonso, because he was known for his participation in the war, as well as for his incursions into the Afro-Atlantic waters in the wake of the Portuguese, traveling to the Canary Islands and Guinea, with their rich fisheries and the commercial possibility of trade in gold, spices, and slaves.

==Preparations for the voyage of discovery==
On 23 May 1492 a royal provision was read out to the residents of Palos, by which the Catholic Monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand ordered that certain residents deliver two caravels to Columbus and travel with him on his voyage that he was making &quot;by command of Their Highnesses&quot; (&quot;por mandado de Sus Altezas&quot;) and that the town should respect the royal decision. The locals did not comply. The sailors of Palos had no confidence in embarking on this adventure with Columbus, who was largely unknown to them. Independent of their greater or lesser credence in his ideas, the men of Palos found it difficult to support the Genovese sailor if he was not accompanied by a mariner known and respected in the town. The venture—risky and, above all, of uncertain profit—did not present great attractions. Opposition or indifference to Columbus&#x27;s project was general.
At about this time, Pinzón returned from a routine commercial voyage to Rome. The Franciscans of the Monastery of La Rábida put Columbus in touch with Pinzón. Pinzón&#x27;s friend Pero Vázquez de la Frontera, a very respected old mariner in the town, also had an important influence on Pinzón deciding to support the undertaking, not only morally but also economically.

There is no record of any written agreement between Columbus and Pinzón, and the terms of any agreement are lost to history. However, we do have the writings of Fray Bartolomé de las Casas and the testimony of some witnesses. According to Fernández Duro, de las Casas says Columbus offered Pinzón equal honors in the voyage and half the profits, and Diego Pinzón Colmenero testified the same in the &quot;pleitos colombinos&quot;; Francisco Medel testified that he heard him offer Pinzón &quot;whatever he asked for and desired&quot;.

As a strong sign of his commitment to Columbus&#x27;s plan, Pinzón put up half a million (&quot;medio cuento&quot;) maravedís in coin toward the cost of the voyage, half of the amount that had been put up by the monarchy. Thanks to his prestige as a shipowner and expert sailor and his fame throughout the Tinto-Odiel region, he was able to enlist an appropriate crew. Signing on, he dismissed the vessels that Columbus had already seized based on the royal order and also dismissed the men he had enrolled, supplying the enterprise with two caravels of his own, the &quot;Pinta&quot; and the &quot;Niña&quot;, which he knew from his own experience would be better and more suitable boats. Furthermore, he traveled through Palos, Moguer and Huelva, convincing his relatives and friends to enlist, composing of them the best crew possible. According to testimony in the &quot;pleitos colombinos&quot;, he &quot;brought such diligence to secure and animate the people as if what were discovered were for him and his sons.&quot; Among those he recruited were Cristóbal Quintero from Palos and the Niño brothers from Moguer.

At this time, Pinzón and Columbus seemed quite close. In the &quot;pleitos colombinos&quot;, witness Alonso Gallego from Huelva remembered hearing Columbus say, &quot;Mister Martín Alonso Pinzón, we are going on this voyage which, if we go on with it and God reveals new lands to us, I promise by the Royal Crown to treat you as a brother.&quot;

==Voyage with Columbus==

===The voyage out===
On 3 August 1492, the &quot;Santa María&quot;, &quot;Pinta&quot;, and &quot;Niña&quot; left Palos on their voyage of discovery. Admiral Columbus captained the flagship &quot;Santa María&quot;, Pinzón was captain of the &quot;Pinta&quot;; his middle brother Francisco was master. It was from the &quot;Pinta&quot; that Rodrigo de Triana would be the first to sight land in the Americas.

During the voyage, Pinzón demonstrated on several occasions his gifts as an expert mariner and as a leader. When the tiller of the &quot;Pinta&quot; broke &quot;en route&quot; to the Canary Islands, Columbus, who could not get close enough to help from the &quot;Santa María&quot;:
 When, between 6 and 7 October 1492 Columbus was unable to reestablish discipline among the tired and discouraged crew of the &quot;Santa María&quot;, Martín Alonso with his gift of command managed to resolve the situation. As the Hernán Pérez Mateos would testify over forty years later:
 At that time, Pinzón suggested to Columbus the change of course on 6 October 1492. This change brought the expedition to landfall on Guanahani on 12 October 1492.

These and other acts by Pinzón and by his brothers, especially Vicente, have led historians to see the brothers as &quot;co-discoverers of America&quot;, in that without their help, support, and courage, Columbus probably could not have achieved his enterprise of discovery, at least not in that time and place. At one point during the &quot;pleitos colombinos&quot;, a royal prosecutor argued that Pinzón had played a more important role in the discovery of the Indies than Columbus himself.

===Separation in the Caribbean===
All evidence—the remarks in Columbus&#x27;s diary, the testimony in the &quot;pleitos colombinos&quot;—is that on the outward voyage, relations between Columbus and Pinzón remained positive. Once among the Caribbean islands, that began to change.

On 21 November 1492, off the coast of Cuba, Pinzón failed to follow a direct order of Columbus to change course. He probably sailed off on his own trying to make individual discoveries and to find treasure, although Cesáreo Fernández Duro argues that the initial separation may have been accidental, a matter of missed signals. (Asensio takes Fernández Duro strongly to task for not adequately explaining the length of the separation; Fernández Duro responds that Pinzón simply continued the prior course, and if Columbus wanted, he should have had a pretty fair idea where to find him over the next several days.) During his separate travels he discovered new land; while all of the island geography of the first voyage is open to question, it is believed that the land was Haiti.

19th-century historian José María Asensio, at least, blamed Pinzón&#x27;s absence for the fact that on 25 December, the &quot;Santa María&quot; was wrecked on a shoal; Pinzón&#x27;s brother Vicente in command of the &quot;Niña&quot; played a key part in rescuing the sailors and Columbus himself. Columbus, giving up on Pinzón, began sailing homeward 4 January, leaving behind 38 men, all of whom died before Columbus&#x27;s return nine months later. The &quot;Niña&quot; and &quot;Pinta&quot; sighted and rejoined one another 6 January 1493, and, after a furious argument in which according to at least one witness, Pinzón objected to the 38 men being &quot;left so far from Spain, being so few, because they could not be provided for and would be lost&quot;, and Columbus threatened to hang Pinzón, the two ships headed together back toward Spain on 8 January.

Columbus&#x27;s published diary of the voyage was heavily edited by Bartolomé de las Casas, so it is impossible to know what was actually written at the time and what was added later, but the diary launches a series of accusations against Pinzón beginning with his separation on November 21:


Nonetheless, much of the testimony in the &quot;pleitos colombinos&quot;, as well as part of the specialized historiography and investigators, does not agree that these things happened in this manner, nor is there any accusation against Pinzón in Columbus&#x27;s Letter on the First Voyage, which Columbus wrote during his return.

===Return voyage and death===
During the voyage back to Spain, Pinzón&#x27;s ship was separated from Columbus in stormy conditions, southwest of the Azores. Pinzón arrived in Baiona in Galicia, near Vigo, 1 March 1493; Columbus reached Lisbon on March 4; he later faced problems with the Court for having touched down in Portugal out of necessity in bad weather. Pinzón, despite the bad weather and strong southerly winds, had managed to touch down on Spanish territory, not Portuguese. Believing Columbus to be lost, or trying to overcome him, he sent a letter to the King and Queen; some have argued that he claimed the glory of the great discoveries for himself, while others defend him from the charge; the letter itself is lost. In any case, he was snubbed by the court and told to only come under the command of Columbus. It is not clear whether Pinzón&#x27;s letter or Columbus&#x27;s from Lisbon reached court first, nor is it clear whether the failure to invite Pinzón to court resulted from Columbus&#x27;s primacy of position, possible accusations by Columbus against Pinzón, or simply reports of Pinzón&#x27;s illness and death.

Pinzón returned home to Palos, arriving on 15 March 1493, precisely the same day the &quot;Niña&quot; reached the voyage&#x27;s starting point. Exhausted and suffering from a recurrent fever, he was taken from his ship in a stretcher. As Columbus arrived, his friends took him to a farm on the boundary between Palos and Moguer. It is possible that Martín&#x27;s son, Arias Pérez Pinzón, did not bring him directly to his house in Palos in order to protect him, given that Columbus had threatened him earlier. Another possibility is that this was because Martín did not get along well with Catalina Alonso, the woman who had been living with his father since he became a widower, and with whom the father would have two illegitimate children: Francisco and Inés Pinzón. According to the testimony of Francisco Medel and Hernán Pérez Mateos, he was brought to the La Rábida Monastery, where he died; he was entombed there, as was his wish.

It has been claimed that Pinzón&#x27;s recurring fever was syphilis. The theory that syphilis is of New World origin and that it was first brought back to Europe by Columbus&#x27;s crew has been longstanding, and long controversial. Some recent genetic evidence restores credence to the theory. Even so, even if Pinzón contracted it on the voyage, it is extremely unlikely that it was the cause of his death. Tertiary syphilis does not normally show up for 3 to 15 years. There is also a possibility that some historians have confused Martín Alonso Pinzón with his brother Francisco, who is more plausibly (but still controversially) believed to have had this particular disease. Conversely, there is the possibility that the first outbreak of syphilis among Europeans with no immunity was much more virulent than subsequently.

Fernández Duro further writes that Pinzón&#x27;s &quot;unpardonable crime&quot; was that he had the luck or skill to obtain more gold than Columbus.

==Legacy==
Along with his brother, Martín Alonso Pínzon is the namesake of Pinzón Island in the Galápagos. He was portrayed by Tchéky Karyo in &quot;1492: Conquest of Paradise&quot; and by Robert Davi in &quot;Christopher Columbus: The Discovery&quot;, both released in 1992.

<text>Royal Air Force Nutts Corner, or more simply RAF Nutts Corner, is a former Royal Air Force (RAF) station located east of Crumlin, County Antrim, Northern Ireland and north west of Belfast.

== Second World War ==

The site was selected for use as an Royal Air Force (RAF) airfield in mid-1940 and within months construction was accorded high priority, enabling No. 120 Squadron RAF flying Consolidated Liberator to begin operations there when the station opened on 2 June 1941. No. 220 Squadron arrived from RAF Wick in January 1942 with Lockheed Hudsons and soon began converting to Boeing Fortress I, flying the first sortie with the type on 29 April before transferring to Ballykelly on 20 June.

As Nutts Corner had been selected as trans-Atlantic reception centre 120 Squadron Moved to Ballykelly in July 1942 and the following year the first USAAF United States Army Air Forces Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses began to arrive. Although the airfield remained under overall RAF control an American presence was established on the airfield in relation to activities involved with ferrying aircraft from the United States and 385 USAAF aircraft (mostly B-17) had passed through the airfield by the end of 1943.

July 1944 saw American activity peak when 372 aircraft arrived that month. The majority of transatlantic deliveries shifted to Prestwick and by the end of 1944 American activity at the airfield was minimal. In July 1945 the airfield began a period of use by the Royal Navy, commissioned as HMS Pintail but was returned to RAF control in April 1946.

The following Royal Air Force squadrons and units were here at some point:
=== Royal Navy ===

RAF Nutts Corner was transferred on loan to the Admiralty from RAF Northern Ireland and known as Royal Naval Air Station Nutts Corner, (RNAS Nutts Corner). It was used to provide accommodation for Fleet Air Arm first-line fighter squadrons. On 11 July 1945 it commissioned as HMS &quot;Pintail&quot;.

List of Fleet Air Arm first and second line squadrons, Royal Naval Air Station flight and other Royal Navy flying units based at this location:
* 4th Naval Fighter Wing
* 772 Naval Air Squadron
* 802 Naval Air Squadron
* 803 Naval Air Squadron
* 807 Naval Air Squadron
* 809 Naval Air Squadron
* 879 Naval Air Squadron
* 883 Naval Air Squadron
* 891 Naval Air Squadron
* 1835 Naval Air Squadron
* 1837 Naval Air Squadron
* 1852 Naval Air Squadron

On 14 November 1945 the airbase was put to Care &amp; Maintenance status, &#x27;on books of HMS &quot;Gadwall&quot;&#x27;. RNAS Nutts Corner finally paid off 1 April 1946 and was returned to RAF Northern Ireland control.

==Post war==
On 1 December 1946 civil air operations were transferred from HMS Gadwall/Belfast Harbour Airport (now the George Best Belfast City Airport) to Nutts Corner due to the longer runways available at that airfield. Other reasons included the limited space available at Belfast for expansion and the danger associated with obstacles such as the cranes around Belfast harbour. Other sites were studied as possible alternative civil airports including RAF Long Kesh and Lisburn. The advantage of choosing Nutts Corner was the large amount of existing hardstanding which was necessary for civil aircraft movements. The former RAF station then became known as Belfast-Nutts Corner Airport.

By the end of the 1950s the steep approach necessary for aircraft flying to Nutts Corner was deemed unsuitable. This was due to the location of the airport, close to the Belfast mountains and the obstacles located there, particularly transmitters and aerials. Another factor was the fact that of Nutts Corner&#x27;s three runways, only one was suitable for modern aircraft. Aldergrove&#x27;s two runways set at 100 degrees (07-25 and 17-35) to each other made operations possible even if conditions (particularly wind) changed dramatically. The decision to restore civil flights to Aldergrove was taken in July 1959. The move was made official in September 1963 and a month later the present terminal was opened.
==Current use==
A section of the A26 Moira Road, running from Nutts Corner Roundabout for approximately 2 km, is constructed on one of the old runways. The airfield was used from 1984 to 2004 for events such as the Irish Superbike Championships and Rallycross, but it was restricted due to noise complaints from local residents. A small section of the circuit continues to be used by the Northern Ireland Carting Club (NICA) and the Ulster Karting Club. The site is also used for a weekly market and a model aircraft club is on the site.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 18 February 1942 a Liberator bomber which was leaving for an Atlantic patrol failed to gain height, struck a radio mast and crashed. Six of the crew survived but four were killed.
*On 21 August 1942, the First World War air ace Harry King Goode was killed on a demonstration flight with a 120 Squadron Consolidated Liberator stationed at the base.
*On 27 March 1951 a Douglas Dakota 3 cargo aircraft operated by Air Transport Charter and en route from Ringway Airport, Manchester, crashed shortly after take-off following failure to gain height. There were four fatalities, two of the three crew on board and two of the three passengers. The subsequent investigation found that the crash resulted from a loss of engine power caused by ice formation in the carburetor intakes attributable to the captain&#x27;s failure to make use of the heat controls. An extended undercarriage and the presence of snow on the wings may have also been contributory factors.
*Nutts Corner was the site of the worst air disaster in Ireland, when on 5 January 1953 a British European Airways (BEA) Vickers Viking crashed after striking landing lights and then a building at the airfield, killing 27 people out of 35 on board.
*On 23 October 1957 a Vickers Viscount of BEA crashed at the airport, killing all seven on board.

<text>In winemaking, vintage is the process of picking grapes to create wine. A vintage wine is one made from grapes that were all, or primarily, grown and harvested in a single specified year. In certain wines, it can denote quality, as in Port wine, where Port houses make and declare vintage Port in their best years. From this tradition, a common, though not strictly correct, usage applies the term to any wine that is perceived to be particularly old or of a particularly high quality.

Most countries allow a vintage wine to include a portion of wine that is not from the year denoted on the label. In Chile and South Africa, the requirement is 75% same-year content for vintage-dated wine. In Australia, New Zealand, and the member states of the European Union, the requirement is 85%. In the United States, the requirement is 85%, unless the wine is designated with an AVA, (e.g., Napa Valley), in which case it is 95%. Technically, the 85% rule in the United States applies equally to imports, but there are difficulties in enforcing the regulation.

The opposite of a vintage wine is a &quot;nonvintage&quot; wine (often seen on a wine list as &#x27;NV&#x27;), which is usually a blend from the produce of two or more years. This is a common practice for winemakers seeking a consistent style of wine, year on year.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&quot; was first used in the early 15th century. It was adapted from the Old French () deriving from the Latin (), in turn coming from () and ().

==Importance of vintage==

The importance assigned to vintage is both varied and disputed.

For wine produced in regions at the colder climatic limits of wine production, vintage can be very important, because some seasons will be much warmer and produce riper grapes and better wine. On the other hand, a poor growing season can lead to grapes failing to reach optimal ripeness, resulting in grape juice that is higher in acid and lower in sugar, which affects the quality of the resulting wine.

In many wine regions, especially in the New World, growing seasons are much more uniform. In dry regions, the systematic and controlled use of irrigation also contributes to uniform vintages. However, such wines are regularly labeled by vintage because of consumer demand.

Wines of superior vintages from prestigious producers and regions will often command much higher prices than those from average vintages. This is especially the case if wines are likely to improve further with some age in the bottle. Some wines are only labeled with a vintage in better-than-average years, to maintain their quality and reputation, while the vast majority of wines are produced to be drunk young and fresh. In such cases, a vintage is usually considered less important. However, it can serve to protect consumers against buying a wine that would not be expected to improve with age and could be past its best, such as with Beaujolais nouveau, a wine style made to be consumed within months of its bottling.

The importance of vintage may sometimes be exaggerated. For example, &quot;New York Times&quot; wine columnist Frank J. Prial declared the vintage chart to be dead, writing that &quot;winemakers of the world have rendered the vintage chart obsolete&quot;; Bill Marsano wrote that &quot;winemakers now have the technology and skills to make good and even very good wines in undistinguished years&quot;. James Laube of &quot;Wine Spectator&quot; has asserted that &quot;even an average vintage can yield some grand wines&quot;.
===Weil blind tastings===
Roman Weil, co-chairman of the Oenonomy Society of the US and professor at the University of Chicago, tested the controversial hypothesis that experienced wine drinkers &quot;cannot distinguish in blind tastings the wine of years rated high from those of years rated low, or, if they can, they do not agree with the vintage chart&#x27;s preferences&quot;.

Weil used wines ranging from four to 17 years beyond their vintage with 240 wine drinkers and found that the tasters could not distinguish between wines of good and bad vintages except for Bordeaux wines. Even when they could make a distinction, the match between the tasters&#x27; individual assessments and the charts&#x27; rankings were little better than tossing a coin. When the tests were replicated with wine experts, including French wine academics, the results were again the same as chance.

Weil does not consider a vintage chart to be useless. He suggests using one to help &quot;find good buys in wine&quot;, as wine made in years considered to be worse than average for vintages may be priced far below its actual quality.

<doc id="1052481" wikidata="Q1635166" url="?curid=1052481" title="Mazda Persona">
<text>The Mazda Persona is a mid-sized, front-wheel drive, four-door hardtop sedan produced by Mazda in Japan from November 1988 to December 1991, and sold both within its main range and under its upscale Eunos brand, as the Eunos 300. It is a rebodied Capella/626 with more luxurious equipment. The Persona was Mazda&#x27;s answer to the Toyota Carina ED, Nissan Presea, and Mitsubishi Emeraude — Japanese sedans that attempted to capture the pillarless hardtop look and proportion of large American sedans. Transposed onto a smaller Japanese sedan, this proportion often led to a small, low cabin in context of longer front and rear ends. It was replaced by the ɛ̃fini MS-8 in March 1992, after Persona stocks had run out. The car was only offered new in the domestic Japanese market.

The 1.8-liter engine option had a single camshaft and three valves per cylinder, producing , while the two-litre option had twin camshafts and four valves per cylinder, with a max output of . Both engines could also be found in the Capella/626 range and other MA platform cars, although the two-litre was tuned for more torque in this application, and both were fuel injected.

In February 1990 a limited edition &quot;Persona Couture&quot; arrived, only available in Silver Stone Metallic paint. It was fully equipped, with air condition and ABS brakes over the Type B, and only available with the larger engine in combination with the automatic transmission. It sold for ten percent more than a 2000 Type B. The Persona underwent a minor change in March 1990, with new body colors and more equipment, such as a power seat and optional ABS brakes. The 12-valve 1.8 was replaced by a twin-cam 16-valve unit which had already been seen in the Eunos 300, producing . Unlike the case of the Eunos, however, the 2-liter FE DOHC engine remained unchanged. Production came to a halt in December 1991, although the car remained on sale for another three months.

Mazda placed much emphasis on the Persona&#x27;s interior, marketing the car under the tagline . It featured lounge-style door trims that appears completely integrated into the rear seats when the doors are closed, while the front seat belts were mounted in the rear doors to be as discreet as possible. It won a prize for &quot;Best Car Interior&quot; in 1988. Other unusual details were the absence of ashtrays as well as a cigarette lighter - they were available as a cost option. A pull-out drawer located underneath the passenger seat replaced a traditional glove compartment. There were two equipment levels, Type A and Type B. Both were well equipped, but the Type B added extras such as leather interior.

==Eunos 300==
When Mazda launched the Eunos dealership channel in Japan for 1990, launched on 1 November 1989, the Persona became available with Eunos 300 badging. Unlike the Persona, the ostensibly sportier Eunos version came with an ashtray and a lighter, as well as a different grille with a &quot;V&quot;-pattern rather than the fine mesh of the Persona. It received the more powerful upgraded 1.8-liter engine from the beginning, a few months earlier than the Persona did. The 2-liter option was the more powerful FE-ZE DOHC engine, producing with a manual transmission and with the automatic. To further its sporting pretensions it also came equipped with a front strut bar and a lower tie bar at the rear. Along with the Eunos Roadster (Mazda MX-5 Miata). the Eunos 100 (Mazda Familia Astina), and the 1990 Eunos Cosmo, these formed the initial Eunos brand lineup. The Eunos 300 was a stop-gap solution until the January 1992 launch of the Eunos 500, also known as the Mazda Xedos 6. It underwent no changes during its two-year production run, aside from the addition of the limited production Type X which received BBS cross-spoke alloy wheels.

<text>The United States Senate Committee on the Budget was established by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. It is responsible for drafting Congress&#x27;s annual budget plan and monitoring action on the budget for the Federal Government. The committee has jurisdiction over the Congressional Budget Office. The committee briefly operated as a special committee from 1919 to 1920 during the 66th Congress, before being made a standing committee in 1974.

The current Chair is South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, and the Ranking Member is Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley.

==Contrasted with other committees==
The Budget Committee should not be confused with the Finance Committee and the Appropriations Committee, both of which have different jurisdictions: The Finance Committee is analogous to the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives; it has legislative jurisdiction in the areas of taxes, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and some other entitlements. The Appropriations Committee has legislative jurisdiction over appropriations bills, which provide funding for government programs.

While the budget resolution prepared by the Budget Committee sets out a broad blueprint for the Congress with respect to the total levels of revenues and spending for the government as a whole, these other Committees prepare bills for specific tax and spending policies.

<doc id="1052485" wikidata="Q7806532" url="?curid=1052485" title="TES (magazine)">
<text>TES, formerly known as the Times Educational Supplement, is a British weekly trade magazine aimed at education professionals. It was first published in 1910 as a pull-out supplement in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. Such was its popularity that in 1914, the supplement became a separate publication selling for one penny.

&quot;TES&quot; focuses on school-related news and features. It covered higher education until the Times Higher Education Supplement (now &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;) was launched as a sister publication in 1971. Today its editor is Jon Severs. Since 1964, an alternative version of the publication, TESS, has been produced for Scotland. An edition for Wales, TES Cymru, was also published between 2004 and 2011. The lack of content about Wales since its closure has been criticised by the Welsh Education Minister, Jeremy Miles. All are produced by London-based company TES Global, which has been owned by US investment firm Providence Equity Partners LLC since 2018. The &quot;TES&quot; no longer has a connection with &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. Times Higher Education was sold in 2018 and is now a separate business to TES Global.

&quot;TES&quot; is published weekly on Fridays, at a cover price of £3.50. Data from the National Readership Survey Jan–Dec 2012 suggested that the average yearly readership was around 362,000, of which around 90 percent of the readership were in the ABC1 category. In addition to the magazine, TES runs a popular website featuring breaking education news and comment, teaching jobs, forums, and classroom resources that are uploaded by teachers.

==History==
The idea for a regular section on education in &quot;The Times&quot; was first proposed in 1905 by J E G de Montmorency, a barrister and writer who later composed leader articles for &quot;The TES&quot;. The first issue of the monthly educational supplement appeared on 6 September 1910, opening with a witty weather forecast for the UK&#x27;s school systems. King George V had recently begun his reign, and the paper noted that &quot;some great resettlement of the English school system seems likely to take place&quot;.

Over its first decade, &quot;The TES&quot; established itself as a paper for teachers, though it was primarily aimed at those in private and grammar schools. However, it pressed for education reform from its early years, calling in 1913 for &quot;Secondary Education for All&quot;.

In 1914, &quot;The TES&quot; became a stand-alone publication, noting on the outbreak of the First World War that &quot;every great war in the modern world has been followed by changes in education&quot;. Two years afterwards, while the war still raged, the paper began to be published weekly. &quot;The TES&quot; later explained that &quot;the decision to change into a weekly periodical was taken to lend the support of &quot;The Times&quot; more effectively to the movement for reform in education which culminated in the Fisher Reform Act of 1918&quot;.

Notable editors of &quot;The TES&quot; included George Sydney Freeman, who was editor for its first 28 years and Harold Dent, a progressive former schoolteacher who became acting editor in 1940. He put the newspaper together practically single-handedly during the Blitz. His editorials pressed for &quot;total reform&quot; of the education system, &quot;based on a new conception of the place, status and function of education in a democratic State, not a patching and padding of the present system&quot;. This attitude chimed with the radical thinking then going on within the Board of Education. Mr. Dent had regular meetings with its president, Rab Butler, in the years building up to the Education Act 1944.

The readership of &quot;The TES&quot;, once primarily private and grammar school teachers, broadened during the 20th century. During the 1970s, the paper became more supportive of Comprehensive schools, when it had once defended grammars.

In the 1980s, it became increasingly concerned that political reforms might overload or restrict teachers, particularly the launch of the national curriculum and league tables with the Education Reform Act 1988. Its then editor, Stuart Maclure, noted in 1985 that &quot;the irony of the last 10 years, in which the politicians and industrialists have clamoured for reform and accused the educationists of blocking it, was not lost on anyone who cares to look back&quot;.

When the newspaper reached its centenary in 2010, its former editor Gerard Kelly, wrote: &quot;If there is one phenomenal, outstanding, amazing development of the past century in this country, it has to be that education has liberated women in a way that was never anticipated by the most liberal of reformers, even by those far-sighted individuals on &quot;The TES&quot; in 1910.&quot;

In September 2011, TES changed from a newspaper to being printed as a magazine.

==Ownership==
At its start, &quot;TES&quot; was owned, like its parent paper, by Lord Northcliffe. After his death in 1922, the newspapers were sold to the Astor family, and it was sold on again in 1966 to the Canadian newspaper tycoon Roy Thomson.

Rupert Murdoch took ownership of the newspaper in 1979. Murdoch&#x27;s News International restructured its newspapers to set up &quot;Times Supplements Limited&quot; and by 1999, this became &quot;TSL Education Ltd&quot;, which also published &quot;THE&quot; and &quot;Nursery World&quot;. In October 2005, the group was sold to Exponent, a private equity group, who in turn sold it to Charterhouse in May 2007.

&quot;TES&quot; online is run by the London-based &quot;TES Global&quot;, which claims to be &quot;The largest network of teachers in the world&quot;, and has been owned by the US-based Providence Equity Partners global investment company since December 2018

==Past staff and contributors==
Staff journalists at &quot;TES&quot; have included Simon Jenkins, who became editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;; novelist, literary historian, and biographer Valerie Grosvenor Myer; and Timothy Mo and Frances Hill, who both became novelists.

The newspaper&#x27;s columnists have included Ted Wragg, Caitlin Moran and Libby Purves. The pop singer Daniel Bedingfield was employed to work on the newspaper&#x27;s website.

External contributors have included Gordon Brown, who contributed comment articles to the Scottish edition of &quot;TES&quot; as a young lecturer in 1979. A competition for writing by pupils in 1980 was won by Sacha Baron Cohen, then eight years old.

==TES Global==
TES first established a website in 1997, when it briefly experimented with a paywall.

It was revamped after the newspaper&#x27;s relaunch in 2007 and is now split into distinct sections, including &quot;School Solutions&quot;, &quot;Jobs&quot;, &quot;Teaching resources&quot; and &quot;School portal&quot;. &quot;Jobs&quot; is home to all the vacancies listed in the &quot;TES&quot; magazine and is updated daily. &quot;School solutions&quot; includes various software products that TES offers to schools and teachers.

Over 13 million educators are members of the site and use it regularly.

The &quot;Resources&quot; section is a platform for teachers to share original classroom resources, including lesson plans, PowerPoint presentations, interactive whiteboard resources, worksheets, and activities. As of May 2017, there have been over 1 billion downloads of classroom resources from the TES platform.

In February 2015, TES Global launched an open marketplace, which allowed teachers to buy and sell teaching resources.

The &quot;TES&quot; portal is now home to &quot;the world&#x27;s largest online community of teachers&quot;, with more than 13 million registered users.

In 2012, PPA (Professional Publishers Association) awarded the &quot;TES&quot; website the digital product of the year for the 3rd year in a row and &quot;TES&quot; magazine was named Business Magazine of 2012.

==Software and services offered==
In 2015, TES bought Hibernia College UK, at the time the largest provider of subject knowledge enhancement courses in England. This later became TES Institute, which offers routes into teaching as well as safeguarding and training courses for teachers.

TES products include Class Charts, a classroom seating plan and behaviour management tool, and Provision Map, software that schools used to manage special educational needs. These products were produced by Edukey, before that company was bought by TES in 2016. They had previously won the best company award at the 2009 Bett Awards.

In 2019, TES purchased Australian school timetabling business Edval. Edval was named as a top education service provider in Australia in 2021.

In 2021, TES bought Glasgow based SchoolCloud, the company behind software that runs parents’ evening software used by over 8,000 schools. A BBC report on the software suggested that Covid restrictions were leading more schools to run virtual parents&#x27; evenings using SchoolCloud software. In March 2023 the Glasgow office was closed and the remaining SchoolCloud staff made redundant as TES centralised roles in its Sheffield and Fishguard offices.

==Awards==
First held in 2009, the TES Schools Awards are held annually to celebrate achievements by schools in the UK. Categories include a school of the year for primary, secondary, specialist provision, and early years, as well as best use of technology, and excellence in creative arts. In 2024, there were 22 categories.

The TES Schools Awards are judged by a panel of independent education experts from across the UK who are education leaders, headteachers, and researchers.

From 2012 to 2021, TES hosted the Independent School Awards, which has since been combined into the TES Schools Awards via new categories. From 2011 to 2020, TES also hosted the FE Awards, aimed at the further education sector.

The TES Schools Awards are announced at a live formal event in London. Typically hosted by public figures and comedians, hosts have included Alex Horne and The Horne Section in 2024, Dara Ó Briain in 2016, and Greg Davies in 2015.

In 2024, TES launched and hosted the TES Awards for International Schools, aimed at British curriculum and International Baccalaureate schools outside the UK. The winners were announced via livestream on 25 April 2024.

<text>Jehan-Aristide Paul Alain (; 3 February 1911 – 20 June 1940) was a French organist, composer, and soldier. Born into a family of musicians, he learned the organ from his father and a host of other teachers, becoming a composer at 18, and composing until the outbreak of the Second World War 10 years later. His compositional style was influenced by the musical language of the earlier Claude Debussy, as well as his interest in music, dance and philosophy of the far east. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Alain became a dispatch rider in the Eighth Motorised Armour Division of the French Army; he took part in the Battle of Saumur, in which he was killed.

His younger brother was composer-organist-pianist-musicologist Olivier Alain and his younger sister was the organist Marie-Claire Alain, who was also responsible for popularising his works.

==Biography==
Alain was born in Saint-Germain-en-Laye in the western suburbs of Paris, into a family of musicians. His father, Albert Alain (1880–1971) was an organist, composer and amateur organ builder who had studied with Alexandre Guilmant and Louis Vierne. His younger brother was the composer, organist and pianist Olivier Alain (1918–1994), and his youngest sister the organist Marie-Claire Alain (1926–2013). Jehan received his initial training in the piano from Augustin Pierson, the organist of Saint-Louis at Versailles, and in the organ from his father, who had built a four-manual instrument in the family sitting room. By the age of 11, Jehan was substituting at St. Germain-en-Laye.

Between 1927 and 1939, he attended the Paris Conservatoire and achieved First Prize in Harmony under André Bloch and First Prize in Fugue with Georges Caussade. He studied the organ with Marcel Dupré, under whose direction he took first prize for Organ and Improvisation in 1939. His studies in composition with Paul Dukas and Jean Roger-Ducasse won him the &quot;Prix des amis de l&#x27;orgue&quot; in 1936 for his &quot;Suite for Organ, Op. 48: Introduction, Variations, Scherzo and Choral&quot;.

He was appointed organist of Eglise Saint-Nicolas de Maisons-Laffitte in Paris in 1935, and remained there for four years. He also played regularly at the Rue Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth synagogue. The only known recording of his playing—a six-minute improvisation—was made in 1938 at that synagogue.

His short career as a composer began in 1929, when Alain was 18, and lasted until the outbreak of the Second World War 10 years later. His music was influenced not only by the musical language of the earlier Claude Debussy and his own contemporary Olivier Messiaen (seen in &quot;Le jardin suspendu&quot;, 1934), but also by an interest in the music, dance and philosophies of the far east (acquired at the Exposition coloniale internationale of 1931 and seen in &quot;Deux danses à Agni Yavishta&quot;, 1932, and &quot;Deuxième fantaisie&quot;, 1936), a renaissance of baroque music (seen in &quot;Variations sur un thème de Clément Janequin&quot;, 1937), and in jazz (seen in &quot;Trois danses&quot; of 1939). Alain described &quot;Le jardin suspendu&quot; (&quot;The Hanging Garden&quot;) as a portrayal of &quot;the ideal, perpetual pursuit and escape of the artist, an inaccessible and inviolable refuge&quot;.
He wrote choral music, including a Requiem Mass, chamber music, songs and three volumes of piano music. But it is his organ music for which he is best known. His most famous work is &quot;Litanies&quot;, composed in 1937. That work is prefaced with the text: &quot;Quand l’âme chrétienne ne trouve plus de mots nouveaux dans la détresse pour implorer la miséricorde de Dieu, elle répète sans cesse la même invocation avec une foi véhémente. La raison atteint sa limite. Seule, la foi poursuit son ascension.&quot; (&quot;When the Christian soul no longer finds new words in its distress to implore God&#x27;s mercy, it repeats incessantly the same invocation with a vehement faith. Reason has reached its limits. Alone, faith pursues its ascension&quot;). &quot;Deuils&quot; (&quot;mourning&quot;), the second of the &quot;Trois danses&quot;, is dedicated to Odile (Alain&#x27;s deceased sister) as a &quot;Funeral Dance to an Heroic Memory&quot;.

Always interested in mechanics, Alain was a skilled motorcyclist and became a dispatch rider in the Eighth Motorised Armour Division of the French Army. On 20 June 1940, he was assigned to reconnoiter the German advance on the eastern side of Saumur, and encountered a group of German soldiers at Le Petit-Puy. Coming around a curve, and hearing the approaching tread of the Germans, he abandoned his motorcycle. After using his machine gun to shoot several infantry soldiers who had ordered him to surrender, he was killed. He was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre for his bravery, and was provisionally buried at the place where he had died. 

He left behind his wife, Madeleine Payan, whom he had married in 1935, his three children Denis, Agnès, and Lise, and a body of compositions viewed by many to have been amongst the most original of the 20th century.

Henri Dutilleux&#x27;s &quot;Les citations&quot; contains a quotation from Jehan Alain&#x27;s music. Maurice Duruflé wrote a musical tribute to Jehan Alain with his &quot;Prélude et fugue sur le nom d&#x27;A.L.A.I.N&quot;, Op. 7 for organ.

==Chronological catalogue==
The JA Catalogue, drawn by Marie-Claire Alain in 2001, uses partially numbers which Jehan Alain had formerly used to better classify his manuscripts. As the numbering of this catalogue is arbitrary, it is not a Catalogue of his works and the numbers shouldn&#x27;t be used to designate the work titles. In actual fact, during his lifetime, Jehan Alain had used some opus numbers.

<doc id="1052491" wikidata="Q613381" url="?curid=1052491" title="Cold Duck">
<text>Cold Duck is a sparkling wine made in the United States.

==Origin==
The recipe was based on a German legend involving Prince Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony ordering the mixing of champagne with unfinished bottles of wine. The drink, as it evolved in Germany, became standardized as one part wine from the Mosel region, one part wine from the Rheinhessen region, and one part champagne, seasoned with lemons and balm mint. The wine produced was given the name &quot;Kaltes Ende&quot; (&quot;cold end&quot; in German), until it was altered to the similar-sounding term &quot;Kalte Ente&quot; meaning &quot;cold duck&quot;.

Modern Cold Duck was invented in 1937 by Harold Borgman, the owner of Pontchartrain Wine Cellars in Detroit, Michigan. He simultaneously poured champagne and sparkling burgundy into a hollow-stem wine glass.

==Other wines==
* In the US, the Michigan winery Bronte Champagnes and Wine was the first to bottle Cold Duck in the 1960s and 1970s. Bronte was sold to Tabor Hill Winery in 1984.
* During the early 1970s, the South Australian company Orlando Wines produced a sparkling red wine labelled &#x27;Cold Duck&#x27;. Between 1971 and 1974, there were a number of trademark registrations, including Cold Turkey, Chicken, Gander, and Stork.
* In the early 1970s, Glenvale Vineyards and Montana Vineyards in New Zealand each produced wine under the name &#x27;Cold Duck&#x27;. 
* Stellenbosch Farmers&#x27; Winery in South Africa now produces &#x27;Fifth Avenue Cold Duck&#x27;, also a sweet sparkling red.

<doc id="1052492" wikidata="Q3246534" url="?curid=1052492" title="Hurley (stick)">
<text>A hurley or hurl or hurling stick (Irish: &quot;camán&quot;) is a wooden stick used in the Irish sports of hurling and camogie. It typically measures between long with a flattened, curved &quot;bas&quot; ( , &quot;palm of hand&quot;) at the end. The &quot;bas&quot; is used to strike a leather &quot;sliotar&quot; ball. GAA Rule 4.5 specifies that the bas should be no more than 13 cm at its widest point, however this rule is &quot;ignored completely&quot;, with most hurleys having a &quot;bas&quot; in the region of 15.24 to 17 cm.

==Name==
Different varieties of Hiberno-English call the stick either a &#x27;hurl&#x27; or &#x27;hurley&#x27;. There are regional variations, with 22 of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties using the term &#x27;hurl&#x27; according to a poll in 2020,
 which found that 97% of people in County Cork preferred the name &#x27;hurley&#x27;, while 98% of people in County Wexford preferred &#x27;hurl&#x27;. The use of the word &#x27;hurl&#x27;, to refer to the stick, reputedly dates back to at least 1882.

==Form and construction==
Hurleys are typically made from ash wood; the base of the tree near the root is the only part used and is usually bought from local craftsmen in Ireland (for about €20–50), who still use traditional production methods. Beginning in 2020, Torpey began manufacturing bamboo hurleys in response to the effects of ash dieback on ash trees in Ireland.

For some time in the 1970s, hurleys made from plastic were used, mainly produced by Wavin. These proved more likely to cause injury and were phased out. As of 2012, at least one manufacturer was producing synthetic hurleys approved for use by the GAA. On wooden hurleys, steel bands are used to reinforce the flattened end - though these are not permitted in camogie due to increased risk of injury. Bands have been put on hurleys since the beginning; the 8th century Brehon Laws permit only a king&#x27;s son to have a bronze band, while all others must use a copper band.

No matter how well crafted the hurley is, a hurler may well expect to use several hurleys over the course of the hurling season. The hurleys often break if two collide in the course of a game, or occasionally they break off on the other players (arms, legs, etc.). Two hurleys colliding is colloquially known as &quot;the clash of the ash&quot;, a poetic description that has come to be used as a romantic or poetic synonym for the game itself. Some hurleys can be repaired by a method called &quot;splicing&quot;. This method involves cutting a &quot;bas&quot;-shaped piece from another broken hurley and fixing it to the broken &quot;bas&quot; by way of glue and nails; the two-piece &quot;bas&quot; is then banded (&quot;hooped&quot;) and sanded into shape. (The face of the hurley is called the &quot;bas&quot;, and is the area used to strike the ball.) Throwing the hurley (e.g., to block a ball going high over one&#x27;s head) is illegal, though camogie players may drop it to make a handpass.

There are names associated with different parts of the hurley. The &quot;bas&quot; is the rounded end of the hurley where the sliotar makes contact as it is being struck. At the same end the &quot;heel&quot; of the hurley is the area to the left of the band and at the hurley&#x27;s edge. It is used to give height to a ball struck on the ground. The rounded area to the right of the band is the &quot;toe&quot; of the hurley and is used in the roll lift or jab lift techniques which allow a player to gain legal possession of a ball into the hand from the ground. The handle is at the opposite end of the hurley to the &quot;bas&quot;, with the timber cut to form a small lip at the peak (to prevent the hurley from slipping from the player&#x27;s hand). The handle is typically wrapped with a self-adhesive synthetic foam grip or tape.

When selecting a hurley, choosing the correct size is very important as a hurley that is the incorrect length can be difficult to swing correctly. A correctly sized hurley should be just touching the ground when gripped at the top and held parallel to the player&#x27;s leg with their arms relaxed. Traditionally it was recommended that the toe of the hurley should reach the player&#x27;s hip when the heel of the hurley is placed on the ground and held parallel to the player&#x27;s leg. This has proved inaccurate and unsuitable since two players of the same height can have a difference of 4 inches or 10 centimetres in hip height.

==As a gift==

The hurley is often given as a gift to or between politicians; for example, Mary McAleese was given two when she was awarded the freedom of Kilkenny in 2009, and Barack Obama was given one by Enda Kenny on his visit to Ireland in 2011. Prince Philip was also given a hurley and sliotar as a gift during Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s visit to Ireland.

<text>The Gyrojet is a family of unique firearms developed in the 1960s named for the method of gyroscopically stabilizing its projectiles. Rather than inert bullets, Gyrojets fire small rockets called Microjets which have little recoil and do not require a heavy barrel or chamber to resist the pressure of the combustion gases. Velocity on leaving the tube was very low, but increased to around at . The result is a very lightweight and transportable weapon.

Long out of production, today they are a coveted collector&#x27;s item with prices for even the most common model ranging above $1,000. They are rarely fired; ammunition is scarce and can cost over $200 per round.

== History ==
Robert Mainhardt and Art Biehl joined forces to form MBAssociates, or MBA, in order to develop Biehl&#x27;s armor-piercing rocket rounds. Originally developed in a .51 caliber, the cartridges were self-contained self-propelled rockets with calibers ranging from .49 and 6mm to 20mm.

A family of Gyrojet weapons was designed, including the pistol, the carbine and a rifle, as well as a proposed squad-level light machine gun and a needlegun known as the Lancejet; however only the pistol and carbine were built. The space age-looking carbines and an assault rifle variant with a removable grip-inserted magazine were tested by the US Army, where they proved to have problems. One issue was that the vent ports allowed humid air into fuel, where it made the combustion considerably less reliable. The ports themselves could also become fouled fairly easily, although it was suggested that this could be solved by sealing the magazines or ports.

Versions of the Gyrojet that were tested were inaccurate, cumbersome, slow loading, and unreliable. At best, a 1% failure rate was suggested; users quote worse figures, with many rounds that misfired the first time but later fired. Possibly these disadvantages could have been overcome in time, but the technology did not offer enough advantages over conventional small arms to survive.

The original designer Robert Mainhardt enlisted the help of his friend Nick Minchakievich of Pleasanton, California, before 1962, in helping to stabilize the projectiles or ammunition. Minchakievich first developed retractable fins after rear ignition proved too dangerous. But the retractable fins proved too expensive, requiring advanced machining during production. The two experimental calibers with retractable fins were 6mm and 13mm.

Rushed for a solution due to the possibility of large government contracts, Minchakievich then invented diagonal vented ports to make the projectiles or ammunition spin while advancing, stabilizing the projectiles gyroscopically, in the same manner as a rifle. This method was used in all the Mainhardt calibers for the Gyrojet. Minchakievich warned Mainhardt that rushing the project would only make the pistol shoddy and unreliable.

Working for free out of his Livermore Aerospace Plastics Lab, Minchakievich requested six more months to perfect an accurate projectile, and make the Gyrojet more famous than the Colt Peacemaker. Mainhardt and the Air Force declined as current ordnance and technology was in demand for Vietnam. Minchakievich even attempted a marketing strategy by enlisting the help of Gene Roddenberry in using the pistol on Star Trek. Although Roddenberry loved the Gyrojet, he wanted a &quot;ray gun&quot; and not a pistol that merely shot a rocket projectile, no matter how advanced for the twentieth century.

== Design ==
The inherent difference between a conventional firearm and a rocket is that the projectile of a conventional firearm builds up to its maximum speed in the barrel of the firearm, then slows down over the course of its trajectory; the rocket continues to accelerate as long as the fuel burns, then continues its flight like an unpowered bullet. A bullet has maximum kinetic energy at the muzzle; a rocket has maximum kinetic energy immediately after its fuel is expended. The burn time for a Gyrojet rocket has been reported as of a second by a Bathroom Reader&#x27;s Institute book and as 0.12 second by &quot;The &#x27;DeathWind&#x27; Project&quot;.

A firearm&#x27;s rifled barrel must be manufactured to high precision and be capable of withstanding extremely high pressures; it is subject to significant wear in use. The Gyrojet rocket is fired through a simple straight, smooth-walled tube of no great strength.

Accuracy is increased by spinning the projectile. This is achieved for a bullet by being forced against spiral rifling grooves in the barrel. A rocket does not have enough initial energy to allow stabilization this way. Spin stabilization of the Gyrojet was provided by angling the four tiny rocket ports rather than by forcing the projectile through a rifled barrel. Combustion gases released within the barrel were vented through vent holes in it. Spin stabilization is limited in accuracy as a targeting technique by the accuracy with which one can point the launching tube and the accuracy with which the orientation of the projectile is constrained by the tube. The technique requires the shooter to have a line of sight to the target.

The rocket leaves the barrel with low energy and accelerates until the fuel is exhausted at about , at which point the 180-grain rocket has a velocity of about , slightly greater than Mach 1, with about twice as much energy as the common .45 ACP round. While test figures vary greatly, testers report that there was a sonic crack from some rounds but only a hissing sound from others, suggesting that the maximum velocity varied from slightly below to slightly above Mach 1.

In 1965, the manufacturer of the pistol claimed 5-mil accuracy (about 17 MOA, or about 4.5 inches at 25 yards), worse than conventional pistols of the time. However, in later tests accuracy proved very poor; the difference seems to have been due to a manufacturing flaw in later production runs which partially blocked one of the exhaust ports, creating asymmetrical thrust that caused the projectile to corkscrew through the air.

About one thousand of the &quot;Rocketeer&quot; model pistols were produced; a few saw service in the Vietnam War and were featured in the James Bond book and movie &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, the Matt Helm film &quot;Murderers&#x27; Row&quot;, and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; novel &quot;The Monster Wheel Affair&quot;. At about the same general size as the Colt M1911, the Gyrojet was considerably lighter at only 22 ounces (625 g), as the structure was mostly made of Zamac, a zinc alloy. The weapon was cocked by sliding forward a lever above the trigger to pull a round into the gun; the lever sprang back when the trigger was pulled. The lever hit the bullet on the nose, driving it into the firing pin. As the round left the chamber, it pushed the lever forward again to recock it. The pistol lacked a removable magazine; rounds had to be pushed down from the open &quot;bolt&quot; and then held in place by quickly sliding a cover over them on the top of the gun. Reloading quickly was impossible.

Tests in 2003 claimed that the acceleration, rather than being constant, started at a high value and decreased, leading to velocities at close range which were not as low as expected, about at 1 foot (30 cm) instead of the calculated . The testers suggested that the (secret) manufacturing process was designed to achieve this effect. However, independent analysis of those testers&#x27; own published data shows that their conclusions were incorrectly calculated. The projectile&#x27;s acceleration actually started out low and continually increased over the bullet&#x27;s measured flight.

==Variants==

===Gyrojet MkI===
Aside from a few Gyrojets tested by the United States military, most Gyrojets were sold on the commercial market starting in the mid-1960s. These were Mark I Gyrojets, which launched a .51 caliber rocket, and had ammunition that was costly to produce and buy.

===Gyrojet MkII===
In 1968, the U.S. Gun Control Act of 1968 created a new legal term, the &quot;destructive device&quot;. Under the new law, any weapon firing an explosive-filled projectile over a half-inch in diameter was considered a destructive device and required paying a tax and obtaining a license. The registration process was changed several years later, but in the interim, MBA created the legal Gyrojet Mark II, firing a .49 caliber rocket.

===Gyrojet assault rifle===
Assault rifle variant with M16-type ergonomics tested by the US Army. This variant had full auto capability and a removable grip inserted magazine. To increase ammo capacity, it is possible this rifle was chambered in the 6 mm caliber.

===Gyrojet carbine===
Came with a rifle type stock, pistol grip and scope.

===Gyrojet Derringer===

Derringer pistol with an upper barrel chambered for the Gyrojet round.

===Gyrojet flare launcher===

The Gyrojet principle was also examined for use in survival flare guns, and a similar idea was explored for a grenade launcher. The emergency-survival flare version (A/P25S-5A) was used for many years as a standard USAF issue item in survival kits, vests, and for forward operations signaling, with flares available in white, green, blue, and red. Known as the gyrojet flare, the A/P25S-5A came with a bandolier of seven flares and had an effective altitude of over . Its rounded-nose projectile was designed to ricochet through trees and clear an over canopy of branches.

===Gyrojet Lancejet===
An underwater firearm variant of the Gyrojet called the &quot;Lancejet&quot; was considered for use by the United States military. It was planned and tested but not adopted; the inaccuracy of the weapon eventually removed it from consideration.

===Gyrojet pepperbox pistol===
An experimental twelve-barrel Gyrojet pepperbox-type pistol was planned to be used, but was not, in the film version of &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;.

===Gyrojet conversion gun===

The Studies and Observations Group (SOG) of the U.S. military in Vietnam in 1967 saw an opportunity to try out one of the SOG&#x27;s new developments, a revolutionary rocket pistol called a &quot;Gyrojet&quot;. In one test, a rocket round punched through an old truck door and into a water-filled 55-gallon drum, almost exiting its opposite side. SOG men also test-fired it through sandbag walls and even tree trunks.

<text>May wine, also known as Maitrank, Maiwein, Maibowle and Waldmeisterbowle, is an aromatized wine popular in Germany, sometimes made into a punch. May wine is served in the spring, traditionally on the May Day holiday. The base is made by steeping the fragrant creeping herb sweet woodruff (&quot;Galium odoratum&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Asperula odorata&quot;, known in Germany as &quot;Waldmeister&quot;) that grows in the forests of Northern Europe in a white German wine. It is the specialty of the town of Arlon, in the south of Belgium.

==Ingredients==
The Council of the European Communities legally defines Maiwein as:
To make a punch (&quot;Maibowle&quot;, May punch) ingredients such as brandy, sparkling wine (or carbonated water) and sugar may also be added to Maywein.

Since strawberries are in season at that time of year, they are often floated in the drink. 

==Production==
A variation might include strawberry flavoring or fermentation techniques to make it lightly sparkling. Commercial May wine produced in Germany has been made with artificial flavoring and coloring agents since the 1980s.

Maywein is produced in German cultural regions of the United States such as Frankenmuth, Michigan.

About 60% of the land surface of County is given over to agricultural use. However, very little of this is arable land; the vast majority consists of permanent grass pasture or rough grazing for herd animals such as sheep and cows. Although both beef and dairy cattle are raised widely, especially in Odrzechowa, the county is more well known for its sheep farming, and thus lamb is the meat traditionally associated with its cuisine.

<text>Cariocecus or Cariociecus was the god of war in the mythology of various Iberian tribes, in the region then known as Hispania. Through conquest and cultural overlay, he became syncretised with the Ancient Rome god Mars and the Ancient Greek god Ares.

The Lusitanians practiced human sacrifice and when a priest wounded a prisoner in the stomach they made predictions by the way the victim fell down and by the appearance of the victim&#x27;s innards. Sacrifices were not limited to prisoners but also included animals, horses and goats specifically. That was confirmed by Strabo: &quot;They offer a goat and prisoners and horses&quot;. The Lusitanians cut the right hand of prisoners and consecrated it to Cariocecus.

<text>Akre (, , ) is a city located in Kurdistan Region of Iraq. it is part of the Duhok Governorate, Akre is known for its celebrations of Newroz.

== History == 

The city was built in the 7th century B.C. and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The Medes ruled the city from 612 to 550 BC in what is known as its golden age. Zoroastrian Prince Zand was the prince of the city.

In year 115, the town came under Roman control commanded by Emperor Trajan and he set up a victory statue in the city. However, the locals quickly revolted and removed the statue.

The city was the fief of the Kurdish Humaydi tribe since the 10th century, and as such, Yaqut al-Hamawi indicated that it was also known as &quot;‘Aqr al-Ḥumaydiya&quot;. In 1133, the city was invaded by Imad al-Din Zengi of the Zengid dynasty who destroyed the defense wall of the city. The 14th-century Shihab al-Umari also noted the presence of the Yazidi Dasni tribe. The decline of the Principality of Bitlis from the 1500s and 1700s allowed Bahdinan to take Akre and its surroundings. Bahdinan would however lose the town to Emir Muhammad Kor of the Soran Emirate in 1833. Before losing the city, the Bahdinan era of the city saw significant cultural and economic developments and constructions. The city wall was also rebuilt with alabaster. However, during the 18th century, the city fell victim to various military campaigns from Soran Emirate which ultimately captured the city in 1833. The city would be captured by the Ottomans in 1842 due to its strategic location and continued to be under Ottoman rule until 1918. During this period, it was administered as part of the Mosul Vilayet and was populated by Christians, Jews and Muslims.

=== 20th century ===
In 1924, of the population was Kurdish, while that number decreased to in 1931. In 1947, 90% of the population was Kurdish.

<doc id="1052555" wikidata="Q181578" url="?curid=1052555" title="Qazvin">
<text>Qazvin (; ; ) is a city in the Central District of Qazvin County, Qazvin province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. It is the largest city in the province.

Qazvin was a capital of the Safavid Empire for over forty years (1555–1598) and nowadays is known as the calligraphy capital of Iran. It is famous for its traditional confectioneries (like Baghlava), carpet patterns, poets, political newspaper and Pahlavi influence on its accent.

Located in northwest of Tehran, in the Qazvin Province, it is at an altitude of about above sea level. Due to its position at the south of the rugged Alborz range called KTS Atabakiyam, its climate is cold but dry.

==History==
Qazvin has sometimes been of central importance at major moments of Iranian history. It was captured by invading Arabs (644 AD) and destroyed by Hulagu Khan (13th century). In 1555, after the Ottoman capture of Tabriz, Shah Tahmasp (1524–1576) made Qazvin the capital of the Safavid Empire, a status that Qazvin retained for half a century until Abbas the Great moved the capital to Isfahan in 1598. It is a provincial capital today that has been an important cultural center throughout its history.

Qazvin is located at a crossroad connecting Tehran, Tabriz, and the Caspian Sea region, which has historically been a major factor in its commercial importance. However, it never rivalled other major Iranian cities like Ray, Nishapur, or Isfahan during the Middle Ages. One reason is that its growth is constrained by a lack of water. Until fairly recently, the entire Qazvin plain was irrigated by just a single qanat and four small streams.

=== Prehistory ===
The earliest remains of prehistoric humans have been discovered in a cave called Qaleh Kurd where archaeologists discovered a Neanderthal tooth. Archaeological findings in the Qazvin plain reveal urban agricultural settlements for at least nine millennia.

=== Sasanian era ===
Qazvin was founded by Shapur I (), the second ruler of the Sasanian Empire. It was refounded by Shapur II (), who established a coin mint there. Under the Sasanians, Qazvin functioned as a frontier town against the neighbouring Daylamites, who made incursions into the place.

=== Early Islamic dynasties ===
Qazvin came under the expanding Rashidun Caliphate in 644, during the reign of Umar. It was taken by Al-Bara&#x27; ibn &#x27;Azib, who besieged the city and received a request for a &quot;sulh&quot; (agreement) from its inhabitants. They were offered the same terms as Abhar had earlier, but the people of Qazvin did not want to pay jizya and supposedly accepted Islam instead. Al-Bara&#x27; then used Qazvin as a base for further campaigns into Daylam and Gilan. Later, when Sa&#x27;id ibn al-&#x27;As was appointed governor of Persia under the Umayyads, he built a new town called Hājjāj at Qazvin.

Two more new cities were founded at Qazvin during the late 8th century. The Abbasid caliph Musa al-Hadi founded a new city called Mādina Mūsā next to Hājjāj. He bought nearby Rustamābād and designated it as a waqf for the benefit of the new town. His freedman Mubarak, a Turk, also founded a new town at Qazvin in 792/3 (176 AH), called Mubarakābād after himself.

Harun al-Rashid visited Qazvin while on his way to Khorasan and saw firsthand the locals&#x27; struggles as a result of the Daylamite raids. At the same time, he was impressed by their efforts to fend off the Daylamites. Harun suspended Qazvin from having to pay the &quot;kharaj&quot; tax and instead ordered an annual payment of 10,000 silver dirhams. He had a wall constructed around the new cities of Mādina Mūsā and Mubarakābād and also built a congregational mosque in the city, and he endowed several buildings as a waqf to support the mosque. The mosque no longer exists today.

Harun&#x27;s wall was not completed until 868, over half a century after his death. It had 206 towers and 12 gates and was built out of mud brick except for the battlements and gates. When it was finished, more people began to settle in Qazvin. Its population was heavily Arab during this time.

Qazvin remained an important frontier town during the wars between the Abbasid caliphate and the Alid rulers of the Caspian. The caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim appointed Fakhr al-Dawla Abu Mansur Kufi as governor of Qazvin around 838; he remained governor for the next 40 years. For a couple of years around 865/6, the Alids under Hasan ibn al-Bakir took control of Qazvin, and Fakhr al-Dawla continued to serve as governor under them.

Qazvin briefly came under Samanid rule in 905/6 (293 AH) when Ilyas ibn Ahmad became governor. The next year, though, the governorship passed to Fakhr al-Dawla Abu Ali, an ancestor of Hamdallah Mustawfi, and he served as governor for the next 27 years. In 913/4 (301 AH) Qazvin was put under Ali ibn al-Muqtadir along with Ray, Dinavar, Zanjan, Abhar, and Tarom.

In 916/7 (304 AH), Yusuf ibn Abi&#x27;l-Saj unsuccessfully attempted to seize control of Qazvin. He was defeated by Asfar ibn Shiruya, who made himself ruler of the whole region between Tabaristan and Gorgan and Qom and Hamadan. In 927/8 (315 AH) Qazvin was the site of a battle between Asfar and an army sent by the Abbasid caliph al-Muqtadir against him. The people of Qazvin assisted the Abbasid army, but Asfar won the battle. As punishment for siding against him, Asfar destroyed parts of the city, killed many of its inhabitants, and imposed monetary demands on the city.

After Asfar&#x27;s death, the Buyid ruler Rukn al-Dawla took control of Qazvin, and it remained part of Buyid territory for over a hundred years. There was rioting in the city in 968/9 (358 AH) and the Buyid vizier Abu&#x27;-Fath Ali ibn Muhammad was sent to restore order. When that was done, he imposed a fine of 1,200,000 dirhams on the city.

=== Ghaznavids, Seljuks, and Khwarazmshahs ===
Qazvin came under Ghaznavid control in 1030 (421 AH). Around 1033/4 (424 AH), Abu Ali Muhammad Ja&#x27;fari became governor of Qazvin. He and his sons continued to hold power in Qazvin for almost 60 years. The last of these sons, Fakhr ul-Ma&#x27;ali Sharafshah, died in 1091 or 1092 (484 AH) and was survived by one daughter. He was extremely wealthy and he and his followers owned most of the land in the area. The annual income from his landed estates was said to be 366,000 gold dinars.

In 1038/9 (430 AH), along with an alliance of the Ghuzz, the Daylamite ruler Fanna Khusraw came to Qazvin after already sacking Ray the year before. The locals bought them off for a sum of 7,000 dinars. Later in 1042/3 (434 AH), the Seljuk sultan Tughril besieged Qazvin. In 1046 Qazvin was visited by Nasir-i Khusraw, who left the following account:


Under the Seljuks, Qazvin appears to have formed part of the central territory around the capital in Isfahan that was more or less directly ruled by the sultans, who were able to levy taxes and appoint governors here. However, despite Qazvin&#x27;s position close to the Isma&#x27;ili strongholds like Alamut, the Seljuks do not seem to have considered it an important governorship to be given to an important amir. After the death of the last Ja&#x27;fari ruler of Qazvin, Malikshah appointed Imad ud-Dawla Turan ibn Alfaqash as governor of Qazvin and instructed him to transfer his household and possessions there so that he would be more invested in its governance. Later, in 1118/9 (512 AH), Sanjar assigned Qazvin to the future Tughril II along with other territories. In terms of religion, Seljuk-era Qazvin was mostly Sunni, although it did have a Shi&#x27;i quarter.

The oldest known structure in Qazvin that still exists is the dome chamber of the city&#x27;s Jameh mosque, which according to its inscription was built from 1106 to 1114 (500-508 AH). Its patron was the amir Abu Mansur Khumartash ibn Abd Allah al-&#x27;Imadi. It was built adjoining an earlier madrasa that was itself built in the 10th century by the &quot;sahib&quot; Isma&#x27;il ibn Abbad. The 13th-century writer Zakariya Qazvini wrote that the dome was &quot;unparalleled anywhere&quot; in size; he wrote that &quot;the masons despaired of vaulting such a huge space until a passing boy suggested that they fill the interior with straw&quot;. According to Hamdallah Mustawfi, two iwans were added to the mosque in 1153 (548 AH); the present-day north iwan is Seljuk in style and may be one of them. The present-day mosque mostly dates from the Safavid and Qajar periods; it is one of the largest mosques in Iran.

Another early monument is the Heydariyeh Mosque, which was probably built a few years after the Jameh mosque. Its original function is unclear; it could have been either a mosque or a madrasa. It features a very early use of glazed ornamentation. A unique architectural style emerged in Seljuk-era Qazvin that influenced architecture in surrounding regions, such as the mosques at Sojas and Ghorveh.

Not long after the Isma&#x27;ilis established themselves at Alamut, Abu&#x27;l-Mahasin Ruyani persuaded the Qazvinis to have anyone coming from the direction of Alamut to be out to death, to prevent people from developing sympathies for the enemy after spending time with them. In 1129 (423 AH) the Isma&#x27;ilis killed about 400 people in Qazvin in retaliation for their envoy being killed in Isfahan. Under the grandmaster Muhammad ibn Buzurg-Ummid (1138–62) the Isma&#x27;ilis conducted raids against Qazvin. In 1165 (560 AH) the Isma&#x27;ilis of Rudbar built a fortress very close to Qazvin, which threatened the city. In 1176 (572 AH), the city&#x27;s walls were rebuilt by the Seljuk vizier Sadr al-Din al-Maraghi.

Qazvin later came under the Khwarazmshahs. Isma&#x27;ili raids continued during this period. When Jalal al-Din Hasan III succeeded as Isma&#x27;ili imam in 1210 (607 AH) he claimed to have converted to Sunni Islam and took the name &quot;Naw-Musalmān&quot; meaning &quot;New Muslim&quot;. The people of Qazvin were skeptical and demanded proof, and he obliged by inviting some of Qazvin&#x27;s leading men to Alamut Castle where he publicly burned Isma&#x27;ili texts for them to see. Also in 1210, the city was damaged by the forces of Kingdom of Georgia sent by Tamar the Great, as per the retribution for destroying Georgian-controlled Ani by the Muslim forces that left 12,000 Christians dead.

=== The Mongols ===
Meanwhile, a new threat was looming – the Mongols. Qazvin changed hands several times during their wars with the Khwarazmshahs, and in 1220 (617 AH) the Mongols massacred the city&#x27;s inhabitants.

It was under the Mongols that there was large-scale Turkic migration into the Qazvin area. Although at least some must have settled there during Seljuk times, it was during the Mongols that they started coming in larger numbers. Several prominent Turkic families established themselves in Qazvin. One of them was the Būlātmūriyān, who first came during the rule of Ögedei when their member Amir Takash was appointed &quot;shihna&quot; or military governor of Qazvin. Another was the Qarāvulān, who acquired large landed estates but had already lost their prominence by the time of Hamdallah Mustawfi. However, most of the main families at his time still traced their roots back to an Arab founder. The religion was mostly Sunni of the Shafi&#x27;i &quot;madhhab&quot;, although there were Shi&#x27;i and Hanafi Sunni minorities.
Mangu Qa&#x27;an appointed Iftikhar al-Din Muhammad al-Bukhari as governor of Qazvin in 1253/4 (651 AH). Iftikhar al-Din learned Mongolian and translated the &quot;Kalila wa-Dimna&quot; into Mongolian. He and his brother Imam al-Din Yahya remained in office until 1278/9 (677 AH).

Qazvin suffered during the tumultuous period preceding Ghazan Khan&#x27;s rise to power in 1295. Many people left the town, to the point that Hamdallah Mustawfi wrote that Friday prayers could not be performed. He also mentioned Mongol reappropriation of waqf land in nearby Pishkildarra.

At the end of Uljaytu&#x27;s reign Qazvin became administered by Husam al-Din Amir Umar Shirazi and the mustawfi Hajji Fakhr al-Din Ahmad. When Abu Sa&#x27;id Bahadur Khan took over in 1316, he assigned the income from Qazvin to cover the expenses of his mother&#x27;s household.

After the fall of the Ilkhanate, Qazvin had an uneventful history until the beginning of the Safavid Empire.

=== Safavid rule ===

From its beginnings under Ismail I, the Safavid state had key frontiers in Azerbaijan, with the Ottoman Empire, and in Khorasan with the Uzbek tribes led by the Shaybanids. Because of Qazvin&#x27;s central location on the road between these two regions, its strategic importance increased under the Safavids. In 1555, after temporarily losing his original capital of Tabriz to the Ottomans, Tahmasp I moved his capital to the more secure location of Qazvin. Qazvin remained capital until Abbas I moved the capital to Isfahan about half a century later. While it was the capital, Qazvin bore the title &quot;dār al-salṭana&quot;.

Like many other cities in Iran, Qazvin became divided into Haydari and Ne&#x27;mati factions during the Safavid period. The Italian traveller Vicento d&#x27;Alessandri visited Qazvin during the reign of Tahmasp I and reported that 4 of Qazvin&#x27;s districts belonged to one group and 5 belonged to the other, and the two had been hostile to one another for at least 30 years by that point with frequent conflicts between the two.

Widespread public conversion to Twelver Shi&#x27;ism probably took place during the early Safavid period, but many people probably secretly remained Sunnis for some time. The Nuqqawi heresy spread to Qazvin during the reign of Tahmasp I. The local leader was Darvīsh Khusrāw, who came from a family of &quot;muqanni&quot;s (qanat builders) and had associated with the Nuqqawis for a while before returning to Qazvin. The ulama, concerned with his growing popularity, charged him with heresy and banned him from the mosque where he had been living at. After Tahmasp&#x27;s death, he returned to preaching, but he was eventually charged with heresy again and executed in 1593/4 (1002 AH).

Qazvin was also a mercantile center during this period. There was an increase in European merchants coming through southern Russia, and in 1561 Anthony Jenkinson noted the presence of merchants from India as well. The English merchant Arthur Edwards made several trips to Qazvin for the Muscovy Company; he wrote in 1567 that it was a producer of velvet and other goods but not as high in quality as elsewhere, and in 1569 he wrote that there were many spices sold in its markets but again they were not as good as elsewhere, and they went for such a high price that buying them here would be unprofitable.

After Tahmasp&#x27;s death, Turkoman rebels seized Qazvin and installed his son Tahmasp Mirza as a puppet ruler in the city for a while. In the spring of 1596, Hamza Mirza marched on Qazvin and overthrew the Turkomans. Qazvin appears to have emerged relatively unscathed from this drama – Don Juan of Persia, who visited the city soon after, described it as large and prosperous. He wrote that it had over 100,000 heads of households, or upwards of 450,000 people in total, with over 500 mosques and a &quot;sumptuous&quot; palace quarter. A member of Anthony Shirley&#x27;s entourage, which arrived in Qazvin in December 1598, was less enthusiastic and wrote that it was an unremarkable city except for a few mosques and the palace gate; he estimated its population as a somewhat smaller than London&#x27;s.

In 1607, the Catholic priest Paul Simon wrote that Qazvin, though no longer the capital, was still a large city rivalling Isfahan in size. He said it was an important commercial destination for silks, carpets, and brocades. Pietro della Valle, who visited Qazvin in 1618, was not very impressed with the city and wrote that it had &quot;nothing to satisfy the expectations of a royal residence&quot;. Thomas Herbert, writing in 1627, said Qazvin was &quot;equal for grandeur to any other city in the Persian Empire&quot;, except for Isfahan, and estimated its population at 200,000. About a decade later, Adam Olearius offered a lower estimate of 100,000 people. In 1674, Jean Chardin visited Qazvin, and he wrote that its walls were in ruins by that time and it had lost its grandeur. He estimated that it had 12,000 houses and 100,000 people. He wrote that there were &quot;a great many merchants in Qazvin, but not many rich ones&quot; and commented on its shoe-makers, who he said made &quot;the best shoes in the whole country&quot; out of shagreen and coming in green, white, and other colors. There were also artisans who made gilded horse saddles and bows.

There was an outbreak of plague in Qazvin in 1635/6 (1045 AH).

The original Safavid palace complex is located at what is now the city&#x27;s maidan or central square. Two parts of this now survive: the Chehel Sotun pavilion, which now hosts the Qazvin museum, and the monumental Ali Qapu portal which now serves as the city&#x27;s police headquarters. The palace complex was probably originally at the northern end of the city - earlier monuments are all to the south and west - but over time the city expanded to the north and the palace precinct ended up in the center of the later Safavid city. This probably happened after the royal court moved to Isfahan under Abbas I in 1596/7 (1005 AH).

The Chehel Sotun pavilion is typically attributed to Tahmasp I, although this is not confirmed because there is no inscription. Shah Ismail II was enthroned here in 1576, with a grand reception held in its main hall on 22 August of that year. Mohammad Khodabandeh was probably also enthroned here, and Abbas I was also enthroned here in 1587/8 (996 AH).

After Shah Abbas moved the capital to Isfahan in 1596/7 (1005 AH), Qazvin did not become a provincial capital. Instead, it was governed by a &quot;wazir&quot;, &quot;darugha&quot;, kalantar, and &quot;mustawfi&quot; appointed directly by the central government. Qazvin only became a provincial capital during the latter part of Shah Soltan Hosayn&#x27;s rule in the early 1700s. Based on the small contingent assigned to its governor - 300 soldiers - it does not seem to have been considered an important province.

The tumultuous final years of the Safavid dynasty had a negative impact on Qazvin. Its population decreased, which was at least partly because of a decline in commerce. In 1722, Qazvin surrendered to an Afghan force of 6,000 soldiers under Aman Allah Khan, but in January 1723 there was a popular uprising (or &quot;lūṭibāzār&quot;) against them in all quarters of the city, led by the kalantars. The Afghans lost 2,000 men and were forced to retreat to Isfahan. Then in 1726, Qazvin surrendered to the Ottomans on the condition that the Ottomans would not send troops to the city - which the Ottomans promptly disregarded and sent 12,000 troops along with their appointed governor Ali Pasha. The troops were soon driven out of Qazvin. Writing in 1744, the English travller Jonas Hanway wrote that a Persian merchant had told him that there had formerly been 12,000 houses in Qazvin, but by then there were only 1,100.

=== Qajar era ===

By the beginning of the 19th century, Qazvin was again starting to flourish as a center of trade. Commercial traffic on the Caspian Sea was growing, and Qazvin was one of the main centers of activity – in the words of one traveller in 1801, it was &quot;the mart of all the commerce of the Caspian&quot;. Qazvin&#x27;s importance as a commercial &quot;entrepôt&quot; was helped by the fact that it lay at a three-way crossroads: it connected Tehran, the new Qajar capital; Tabriz, &quot;the second city of the empire&quot;, and the important Caspian port of Anzali. Qazvin was manufacturing velvets, brocades, and cotton cloth. In an 1841 report, the British diplomat Keith Edward Abbott wrote that Qazvin was commercially as important as Tehran. Mirza Husayn Farahani, who visited Qazvin in 1884, wrote that it was divided into 17 districts and had 600 shops, 8 caravanserais, 40 mosques, 9 madrasas, and 12 yakhchals. Its walls were in ruins but 12 gates were still standing.

This increase in commercial importance does not seem to have been accompanied by an increase in population, although it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure because contemporary estimates were not necessarily based on the same criteria. James Justinian Morier and William Ouseley in the early 1800s both gave an estimate of 25,000 people. The census taken from 1880 to 1882 gave a population of 64,362 for Qazvin. Farahani in 1884 wrote that Qazvin had 30,000 people in about 7,000 households. George Curzon wrote that Qazvin&#x27;s population was said to be 40,000 in 1889, but he wrote that its actual population was probably no more than 2/3 of that.
In the middle of the century, the Babi movement had one of its centers here and the first massacre of Babis occurred in Qazvin in 1847. In the second half of the 19th century Qazvin was one of the centers of Russian presence in northern Iran. A detachment of the Persian Cossack Brigade under Russian officers was stationed here. From 1893 this was the headquarters of the Russian Company for Road construction in Persia which connected Qazvin by roads to Tehran and Hamadan. The company built a hospital and the St. Nicolas Church.

=== 20th century to present ===

In 1920 Qazvin was used as a base for the British Norperforce. The 1921 Persian coup d&#x27;état that led to the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty was launched from Qazvin.

During the reign of Reza Shah, Qazvin declined in importance as a commercial center as communications improved. Many merchants and other residents moved to Tehran.

On 1 September 1962, an earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter Scale struck Qazvin, killing more than 12,000 people. The earthquake occurred shortly before Israeli Minister of Agriculture, Moshe Dayan, was scheduled to visit Iran in mid-September for meetings with the Shah and with his Iranian counterpart, in order to discuss Israel&#x27;s possible role in the White Revolution, a plan for land reform and the modernization of rural Iran. Shortly after the earthquake, two planning experts were sent from Israel to assist with Iranian relief activities. After touring the region and meeting with the Iranian minister in charge of relief efforts, they were assigned to rebuild the village of Khuznin, located in the center of the Qazvin region. Other teams, both Iranian and foreign, had also arrived in the region to offer assistance and expertise in the reconstruction activities. Each team was assigned one or more villages for planning and rebuilding. Over the course of three months, the Israeli team built hundreds of houses in the village that they had been allocated.

In 1963, the Qazvin Development Authority was established to develop the agriculture and water resources of Qazvin and its surroundings.

Qazvin became a state in 1996. On 15 July 2009 Caspian Airlines Flight 7908 crashed near Qazvin. In Autumn 2015 portions of Qazvin were struck by a meteorite.

==Main sights==
Qazvin contains several archeological excavations. In the middle of the city lie the ruins of Meimoon Ghal&#x27;eh, one of several Sassanid edifices in the area.

Qazvin contains several buildings from the Safavid era, dating to the period in which it was capital of Persia. A well known of the surviving edifices is the Chehel sotoun, Qazvin, today a museum in central Qazvin.

In the Islamic era, the popularity of mystics (tasawwuf), as well as the prominence of tradition (Hadith), religious jurisprudence (fiqh), and philosophy in Qazvin, led to the emergence of many mosques and religious schools. They include:
*Jame&#x27; Atiq Mosque of Qazvin
*Heydarieh Mosque
*Masjed Al-Nabi (Soltani Mosque): With an area of 14000 m2, this mosque is one of the most glorious mosques of antiquity, built in the Safavieh&#x27;s monarchy era.
*Sanjideh Mosque: Another mosque of Qazvin dating back to pre-Islamic Iran; a former fire temple. Its present-day form is attributed to the Seljukian era.

About south-west of Qazvin are the tombs of two Saljuki era princes — &quot;Abu Saeed Bijar&quot;, son of Sa&#x27;d, and &quot;Abu Mansur Iltai&quot;, son of Takin — located in two separate towers known as the Kharraqan twin towers. Constructed in 1067, these were the first monuments in Islamic architecture to include a non-conic two-layered dome. Both towers were severely damaged by a devastating earthquake in March 2003.

Sepah Street (خیابان سپه, pronounced &quot;Cepah&quot; referring to ancient Persian army and not the revolutionary guards pronounced &quot;Sepaah&quot;) is known as the first modern street in Iran. This street entirely is carpeted with carved gray stone and is surrounded by craftsmen gift shops (used to be bars or bygone liquorshops, called May&#x27;kadeh) and hosts historical places such as Qazvin&#x27;s Ali Qapu gate, entrance of Jame&#x27; Atiq mosque and historical schools.

Qazvin has three buildings built by Russians in the late 19th/early 20th century. Among these is the current Mayor&#x27;s office (former Ballet Hall) and a water reservoir. St. Nicholas church was built in 1904 by the Russian Company for Roads in Persia which had its headquarter here. The church was in use until being decommissioned in 1984 because the community of Russian emigres in Qazvin did not exist any more. The iconostasis and bell was removed to Tehran and the building handed over to the Iranian government which keeps it available to the public as a historic monument. In front of the church is a 1906 memorial to a Russian road engineer.

==Economy==
Qazvin today is a center of textile trade, including cotton, silk and velvet, in addition to leather. It is on the railroad line and the highway between Tehran and Tabriz.

<text>Ataegina (; ) was a goddess worshipped by the ancient Iberians, Lusitanians, and Celtiberians of the Iberian Peninsula. She is believed to have ruled the underworld.

==Names==
The deity&#x27;s name is variously attested as &quot;Ataegina&quot;, &quot;Ataecina&quot;, &quot;Adaecina&quot; and &quot;Adaegina&quot;, among other spellings. Her name appears in conjunction to a place named &quot;Turibriga&quot; or &quot;Turobriga&quot; (see below).

==Etymology==
=== Celtic hypothesis===

The name &quot;Ataegina&quot; is most commonly derived from a Celtic source: according to Cristina Maria Grilo Lopes and Juan Olivares Pedreño, French scholar D&#x27;Arbois de Jubainville and Portuguese scholar José Leite de Vasconcelos interpreted her name as a compound from &quot;*ate-&quot; &#x27;repetition, re-&#x27; &quot;*-genos&quot; &#x27;(to be) born&#x27;. Thus, her name would mean &#x27;The Reborn One&#x27; (&quot;renascida&quot;, in the original).

Others propose a connection to the domain of nocturnal or underworld deities: tentatively saw a connection with Irish &quot;adaig&quot; &#x27;night&#x27;, which may indicate a relation to the underworld. Similarly, in a 1998 article, Eugenio Luján, based on the epigraphic evidence available until then, supposed that &quot;Adaecina&quot; is the original spelling of her name, and related it to Irish &quot;adaig&quot;, and both deriving from a Proto-Celtic &quot;*adakī&quot;. This form would account for both words, but Luján refrained from offering a definitive etymology. Wolfgang Meid raises the possibility that Old Irish &quot;adaig&quot; may be a borrowing of Welsh &quot;adeg&quot; &quot;time, occasion, period, seaspn&quot;, whose native Irish cognate is &quot;athach&quot; &quot;interval, space (of time)&quot;, derived from Proto-Celtic &quot;*atikā&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*h₂et-i-keh₂&quot;, from &quot;*h₂et-&quot; (“to go”), making a connection between these words and &quot;Ataegina&quot; unlikely. 

Italian linguist Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel argues for a Celtic etymology, from &quot;*atakī&quot; (&#x27;night&#x27;), from an earlier &quot;*at-ak-ī&quot; (&#x27;interval&#x27;). Thus, de Bernardo proposes, her name means &quot;the one of the night&quot;. In a later article, she describes Ataecina as &quot;the goddess of the nighttime&quot;, and derives her name from *&quot;Atakī-nā&quot; &#x27;the divine (night)time&#x27;.

===Other hypotheses===
That said, her presence in decidedly non-Indo-European Iberian regions suggest that she may have an older, indigenous origin, in which case her name&#x27;s etymology is more likely Iberian, Aquitanian or Tartessian.

In his late 19th-century study, José Leite de Vasconcelos, while proposing a Celtic reading of her name, also supposed her origins as a Celticized indigenous deity. Spanish historian supported the idea of Ataegina&#x27;s indigenous character, while remarking that a Celtic interpretation of her name as &#x27;reborn&#x27; is &quot;inviable&quot;, and that her connection to Irish &#x27;night&#x27; is &quot;difficult&quot;.

==Centers of worship==
Ataegina was worshipped in Lusitania and Betica; there were also sanctuaries dedicated to Ataegina in Elvas (Portugal), and Mérida and Cáceres in Spain, along with other places, especially near the Guadiana river. She was one of the goddesses worshipped in &quot;Myrtilis&quot; (today&#x27;s Mértola, Portugal), &quot;Pax Julia&quot; (Beja, Portugal). A bronze plaque from Malpartida de Cáceres suggests associations with the goat as a sacred animal.

===Turibriga or Turobriga===
Her name appears with adjective &quot;Turobrigensis&quot;, which seems to indicate a place called &quot;Turibriga&quot; or &quot;Turobriga&quot;. Similar epigraphic attestations read &quot;Turibrige&quot;, &quot;[T]urubricae&quot; and &quot;Turibri&quot;, which led professor Amílcar Guerra to indicate a form &quot;*Turibris&quot;.

This place is interpreted by scholarship to mean the main center of her cult, but its precise location is unknown. Classical author Pliny indicated it belonged to Celtic Beturia.

==Functions==
Epigraphs from the Badajoz region associate the goddess with the Roman Proserpina (analogous to Greek Persephone), which would make her a goddess presiding over spring and seasonality, echoing the &quot;reborn&quot; derivation of the name, or connect her to the Underworld. In that regard, a dedication etched in marble was found in Augusta Emérita: the propitiator prays to &quot;Dea Ataecina Turibrig(ensis) Proserpina&quot; for her to avenge the theft of some pieces of clothing.

<text>Ares Lusitani (Latin for the &quot;Lusitanian Ares&quot;) was the God of horses and knights in Lusitanian mythology, in the cultural area of Gallaecia and Lusitania (in the territory of modern Galicia (Spain) and Portugal). This deity was probably a late Greek-Roman addition to the native pantheon.

<text>An acronym is a type of abbreviation consisting of a phrase whose only pronounced elements are the initial letters or initial sounds of words inside that phrase. Acronyms are often spelled with the initial letter of each word in all caps with no punctuation.
For some, an initialism or alphabetism, connotes this general meaning, and an &quot;acronym&quot; is a subset with a narrower definition: an acronym is pronounced as a word rather than as a sequence of letters. In this sense, &quot;NASA&quot; is an acronym but &quot;USA&quot; is not.

The broader sense of &quot;acronym&quot;, ignoring pronunciation, is its original meaning and in common use. Dictionary and style-guide editors dispute whether the term &quot;acronym&quot; can be legitimately applied to abbreviations which are not pronounced as words, and they do not agree on acronym spacing, casing, and punctuation.
The phrase that the acronym stands for is called its &quot;expansion&quot;. The &quot;meaning&quot; of an acronym includes both its expansion and the meaning of its expansion.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;acronym&quot; is formed from the Greek roots , meaning &#x27;height, summit, or tip&#x27;, and , &#x27;name&#x27;. This neoclassical compound appears to have originated in German, with attestations for the German form appearing as early as 1921. Citations in English date to a 1940 translation of a novel by the German writer Lion Feuchtwanger.

== Pronounceability controversy ==
It is an unsettled question in English lexicography and style guides whether it is legitimate to use the word &quot;acronym&quot; to describe forms that use initials but are not pronounced as a word. While there is plenty of evidence that &quot;acronym&quot; is used widely in this way, some sources do not acknowledge this usage, reserving the term &quot;acronym&quot; only for forms pronounced as a word, and using &quot;initialism&quot; or &quot;abbreviation&quot; for those that are not. Some sources acknowledge the usage, but vary in whether they criticize or forbid it, allow it without comment, or explicitly advocate it.

Some mainstream English dictionaries from across the English-speaking world affirm a sense of &quot;acronym&quot; which does not require being pronounced as a word. American English dictionaries such as &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot;, Dictionary.com&#x27;s &quot;Random House Webster&#x27;s Unabridged Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; as well as the British &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and the Australian &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; all include a sense in their entries for &quot;acronym&quot; equating it with &quot;initialism&quot;, although &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary&quot; criticizes it with the label &quot;usage problem&quot;. However, many English language dictionaries, such as the &quot;Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Cambridge Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Macmillan Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English&quot;, &quot;New Oxford American Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World Dictionary&quot;, and &quot;Lexico&quot; from Oxford University Press do not acknowledge such a sense.

Most of the dictionary entries and style guide recommendations regarding the term &quot;acronym&quot; in the twentieth century did not explicitly acknowledge or support the expansive sense. The Merriam–Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of English Usage from 1994 is one of the earliest publications to advocate for the expansive sense, and all the major dictionary editions that include a sense of &quot;acronym&quot; equating it with &quot;initialism&quot; were first published in the twenty-first century. The trend among dictionary editors appears to be towards including a sense defining &quot;acronym&quot; as &quot;initialism&quot;: the &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot; added such a sense in its 11th edition in 2003, and both the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary&quot; added such senses in their 2011 editions. The 1989 edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; only included the exclusive sense for &quot;acronym&quot; and its earliest citation was from 1943. In early December 2010, Duke University researcher Stephen Goranson published a citation for &quot;acronym&quot; to the American Dialect Society e-mail discussion list which refers to &quot;PGN&quot; being pronounced &quot;pee-gee-enn&quot;, antedating English language usage of the word to 1940. Linguist Ben Zimmer then mentioned this citation in his December 16, 2010 &quot;On Language&quot; column about acronyms in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. By 2011, the publication of the 3rd edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; added the expansive sense to its entry for &quot;acronym&quot; and included the 1940 citation. As the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; structures the senses in order of chronological development, it now gives the &quot;initialism&quot; sense first.

English language usage and style guides which have entries for &quot;acronym&quot; generally criticize the usage that refers to forms that are not pronounceable words. &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; says that &quot;acronym&quot; &quot;denotes abbreviations formed from initial letters of other words and pronounced as a single word, such as &quot;NATO&quot; (as distinct from &quot;B-B-C&quot;)&quot; but adds later &quot;In everyday use, &quot;acronym&quot; is often applied to abbreviations that are technically initialisms, since they are pronounced as separate letters.&quot; &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; acknowledges the complexity (&quot;Furthermore, an acronym and initialism are occasionally combined (JPEG), and the line between initialism and acronym is not always clear&quot;) but still defines the terms as mutually exclusive. Other guides outright deny any legitimacy to the usage: &quot;Bryson&#x27;s Dictionary of Troublesome Words&quot; says &quot;Abbreviations that are not pronounced as words (IBM, ABC, NFL) are not acronyms; they are just abbreviations.&quot; &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot; says &quot;An acronym is made from the first letters or parts of a compound term. It&#x27;s read or spoken as a single word, not letter by letter.&quot; &quot;The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage&quot; says &quot;Unless pronounced as a word, an abbreviation is not an acronym.&quot;

In contrast, some style guides do support it, whether explicitly or implicitly. The 1994 edition of &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of English Usage&quot; defends the usage on the basis of a claim that dictionaries do not make a distinction. The BuzzFeed style guide describes CBS and PBS as &quot;acronyms ending in S&quot;.

==Historical and current use==

Acronymy, like retronymy, is a linguistic process that has existed throughout history but for which there was little to no naming, conscious attention, or systematic analysis until relatively recent times. Like retronymy, it became much more common in the twentieth century than it had formerly been.

Ancient examples of acronymy (before the term &quot;acronym&quot; was invented) include the following:
* Acronyms were used in Rome before the Christian era. For example, the official name for the Roman Empire, and the Republic before it, was abbreviated as &quot;SPQR&quot; (). Inscriptions dating from antiquity, both on stone and on coins, use many abbreviations and acronyms to save space and work. For example, Roman first names, of which there was only a small set, were almost always abbreviated. Common terms were abbreviated too, such as writing just &quot;F&quot; for , meaning &quot;son&quot;, a very common part of memorial inscriptions mentioning people. Grammatical markers were abbreviated or left out entirely if they could be inferred from the rest of the text.
* So-called (&#x27;sacred names&#x27;) were used in many Greek biblical manuscripts. The common words God (), Jesus (), Christ (), and some others, would be abbreviated by their first and last letters, marked with an overline. This was just one of many kinds of conventional scribal abbreviation, used to reduce the time-consuming workload of the scribe and save on valuable writing materials. The same convention is still commonly used in the inscriptions on religious icons and the stamps used to mark the eucharistic bread in Eastern Churches.
* The early Christians in Rome, most of whom were Greek rather than Latin speakers, used the image of a fish as a symbol for Jesus in part because of an acronym (or backronym): &#x27;fish&#x27; in Greek is (), which was construed to stand for (: &#x27;Jesus Christ, God&#x27;s Son, Savior&#x27;). This interpretation dates from the second and third centuries and is preserved in the catacombs of Rome. Another ancient acronym for Jesus is the inscription &quot;INRI&quot; over the crucifix, for the Latin (&#x27;Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews&#x27;).
* Hebrew has a millennia-long history of acronyms pronounced as words. Along with theophoric parallels to the Greek described above, Talmudic sages as early as Rabbi Yehuda shorten the ten plagues to דצ&quot;ך עד&quot;ש באח&quot;ב, the order of blessings to יקנה&quot;ז, etc., for the sake of mnemonic. The rishonic period saw Hebrew acronymy expand to a lexicon of many hundreds, including every type of word and extending to proper nouns: almost all Medieval rabbis are known by acronyms like &quot;Rashi&quot; and &quot;Rambam.&quot;

During the mid- to late nineteenth century, acronyms became a trend among American and European businessmen: abbreviating corporation names, such as on the sides of railroad cars (e.g., &quot;Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad&quot; → &quot;RF&amp;P&quot;); on the sides of barrels and crates; and on ticker tape and newspaper stock listings (e.g. American Telephone and Telegraph Company → AT&amp;T). Some well-known commercial examples dating from the 1890s through 1920s include &quot;Nabisco&quot; (&quot;National Biscuit Company&quot;), &quot;Esso&quot; (from &quot;S.O.&quot;, from &quot;Standard Oil&quot;), and &quot;Sunoco&quot; (&quot;Sun Oil Company&quot;).

Another field for the adoption of acronyms was modern warfare, with its many highly technical terms. While there is no recorded use of military acronyms dating from the American Civil War (acronyms such as &quot;ANV&quot; for &quot;Army of Northern Virginia&quot; post-date the war itself), they became somewhat common in World War I, and by World War II they were widespread even in the slang of soldiers, who referred to themselves as G.I.s.

The widespread, frequent use of acronyms across the whole range of linguistic registers is relatively new in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-twentieth century. As literacy spread and technology produced a constant stream of new and complex terms, abbreviations became increasingly convenient. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) records the first printed use of the word &quot;initialism&quot; as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after &quot;acronym&quot; had become common.

In English, acronyms may be a twentieth-century phenomenon. Linguist David Wilton in &quot;Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends&quot; claims that &quot;forming words from acronyms is a distinctly twentieth- (and now twenty-first-) century phenomenon. There is only one known pre-twentieth-century [English] word with an acronymic origin and it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886. The word is &quot;colinderies&quot; or &quot;colinda&quot;, an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition held in London in that year.&quot; However, although acronymic words seem not to have been before the twentieth century (as Wilton points out), the is treated as effortlessly understood (and evidently not novel) in an Edgar Allan Poe story of the 1830s, &quot;How to Write a Blackwood Article&quot;, which includes the contrived acronym &quot;P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H.&quot;

===Early examples in English===
The use of Latin and Neo-Latin terms in vernaculars has been pan-European and pre-dates modern English. Some examples of acronyms in this class are:

*&quot;A.M.&quot; (from Latin , &#x27;before noon&#x27;) and &quot;P.M.&quot; (from Latin , &#x27;after noon&#x27;)
*&quot;A.D.&quot; (from Latin , &#x27;in the year of our Lord&#x27;), whose complement in English, &quot;B.C.&quot; (Before Christ), is English-sourced

The earliest example of a word derived from an acronym listed by the &quot;OED&quot; is &quot;abjud&quot; (now &quot;abjad&quot;), formed from the original first four letters of the Arabic alphabet in the late eighteenth century. Some acrostics pre-date this, however, such as the Restoration witticism arranging the names of some members of Charles II&#x27;s Committee for Foreign Affairs to produce the &quot;CABAL&quot; ministry.

&quot;OK&quot;, a term of disputed origin, dates back at least to the early nineteenth century and is now used around the world.

===Current use===
Acronyms are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms. The armed forces and government agencies frequently employ acronyms; some well-known examples from the United States are among the &quot;alphabet agencies&quot; (jokingly referred to as &quot;alphabet soup&quot;) created under the New Deal by Franklin D. Roosevelt (himself known as &quot;FDR&quot;). Business and industry also coin acronyms prolifically. The rapid advance of science and technology also drives the usage, as new inventions and concepts with multiword names create a demand for shorter, more pronounceable names. One representative example, from the U.S. Navy, is &quot;COMCRUDESPAC&quot;, which stands for &quot;commander, cruisers destroyers Pacific&quot;; it is also seen as &quot;ComCruDesPac&quot;. Inventors are encouraged to anticipate the formation of acronyms by making new terms &quot;YABA-compatible&quot; (&quot;yet another bloody acronym&quot;), meaning the term&#x27;s acronym can be pronounced and is not an offensive word: &quot;When choosing a new name, be sure it is &#x27;YABA-compatible&#x27;.&quot;

Acronym use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with short message service (SMS), and instant messenger (IM). To fit messages into the 160-character SMS limit, and to save time, acronyms such as &quot;GF&quot; (&quot;girlfriend&quot;), &quot;LOL&quot; (&quot;laughing out loud&quot;), and &quot;DL&quot; (&quot;download&quot; or &quot;down low&quot;) have become popular. Some prescriptivists disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;proper&quot; English. Others point out that languages have always continually changed, and argue that acronyms should be embraced as inevitable, or as innovation that adapts the language to changing circumstances. In this view, the modern practice is just the &quot;proper&quot; English of the current generation of speakers, much like the earlier abbreviation of corporation names on ticker tape or newspapers.

Exact pronunciation of &quot;word acronyms&quot; (those pronounced as words rather than sounded out as individual letters) often vary by speaker population. These may be regional, occupational, or generational differences, or simply personal preference. For instance, there have been decades of online debate about how to pronounce GIF ( or ) and BIOS (, , or ). Similarly, some letter-by-letter initialisms may become word acronyms over time, especially in combining forms: &quot;IP&quot; for &quot;Internet Protocol&quot; is generally said as two letters, but &quot;IPsec&quot; for &quot;Internet Protocol Security&quot; is usually pronounced as or , along with variant capitalization like &quot;IPSEC&quot; and &quot;Ipsec&quot;. Pronunciation may even vary within a single speaker&#x27;s vocabulary, depending on narrow contexts. As an example, the database programming language SQL is usually said as three letters, but in reference to Microsoft&#x27;s implementation is traditionally pronounced like the word &quot;sequel&quot;.

====Expansion at first use====

In writing for a broad audience, the words of an acronym are typically written out in full at its first occurrence within a given text. Expansion At First Use (EAFU) benefits readers unfamiliar with the acronym.

Another text aid is an abbreviation key which lists and expands all acronyms used, a reference for readers who skipped past the first use. (This is especially important for paper media, where no search utility is available to find the first use.) It also gives students a convenient review list to memorize the important acronyms introduced in a textbook chapter.

Expansion at first use and abbreviation keys originated in the print era, but they are equally useful for electronic text.

====Jargon====
While acronyms provide convenience and succinctness for specialists, they often degenerate into confusing jargon. This may be intentional, to exclude readers without domain-specific knowledge. New acronyms may also confuse when they coincide with an already existing acronym having a different meaning.

Medical literature has been struggling to control the proliferation of acronyms, including efforts by the American Academy of Dermatology.

====As mnemonics====
Acronyms are often taught as mnemonic devices: for example the colors of the rainbow are ROY G. BIV (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). They are also used as mental checklists: in aviation GUMPS stands for gas-undercarriage-mixture-propeller-seat belts. Other mnemonic acronyms include CAN SLIM in finance, PAVPANIC in English grammar, and PEMDAS in mathematics.

====Acronyms as legendary etymology====

It is not uncommon for acronyms to be cited in a kind of false etymology, called a folk etymology, for a word. Such etymologies persist in popular culture but have no factual basis in historical linguistics, and are examples of language-related urban legends. For example, &quot;cop&quot; is commonly cited as being derived, it is presumed, from &quot;constable on patrol&quot;, and &quot;posh&quot; from &quot;port outward, starboard home&quot;. With some of these specious expansions, the &quot;belief&quot; that the etymology is acronymic has clearly been tongue-in-cheek among many citers, as with &quot;gentlemen only, ladies forbidden&quot; for &quot;golf&quot;, although many other (more ) people have uncritically taken it for fact. Taboo words in particular commonly have such false etymologies: &quot;shit&quot; from &quot;ship/store high in transit&quot; or &quot;special high-intensity training&quot; and &quot;fuck&quot; from &quot;for unlawful carnal knowledge&quot;, or &quot;fornication under consent/command of the king&quot;.

==Orthographic styling==
===Punctuation===
====Showing the ellipsis of letters====
In English, abbreviations have previously been marked by a wide variety of punctuation. Obsolete forms include using an overbar or colon to show the ellipsis of letters following the initial part. The forward slash is still common in many dialects for some fixed expressionssuch as in &quot;w/&quot; for &quot;with&quot; or &quot;A/C&quot; for &quot;air conditioning&quot;while only infrequently being used to abbreviate new terms. The apostrophe is common for grammatical contractions (e.g. &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;y&#x27;all&quot;, and &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot;) and for contractions marking unusual pronunciations (e.g. &quot;a&#x27;ight&quot;, &quot;cap&#x27;n&quot;, and &quot;fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle&quot; for &quot;all right&quot;, &quot;captain&quot;, and &quot;forecastle&quot;). By the early twentieth century, it was standard to use a full stop/period/point, especially in the cases of initialisms and acronyms. Previously, especially for Latin abbreviations, this was done with a full space between every full word (e.g. , , and for &quot;Anno Domini&quot;, &quot;id est&quot;, and &quot;exempli gratia&quot;). This even included punctuation after both Roman and Arabic numerals to indicate their use in place of the full names of each number (e.g. &quot;LII.&quot; or &quot;52.&quot; in place of &quot;fifty-two&quot; and &quot;1/4.&quot; or &quot;1./4.&quot; to indicate &quot;one-fourth&quot;). Both conventions have fallen out of common use in all dialects of English, except in places where an Arabic decimal includes a medial decimal point.

Particularly in British and Commonwealth English, all such punctuation marking acronyms and other capitalized abbreviations is now uncommon and considered either unnecessary or incorrect. The presence of all-capital letters is now thought sufficient to indicate the nature of the &quot;UK&quot;, the &quot;EU&quot;, and the &quot;UN&quot;. Forms such as &quot;the U.S.A.&quot; for &quot;the United States of America&quot; are now considered to indicate American or North American English. Even within those dialects, such punctuation is becoming increasingly uncommon.

=====Ellipsis-is-understood style=====
Some style guides, such as that of the BBC, no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis; some even proscribe it. Larry Trask, American author of &quot;The Penguin Guide to Punctuation&quot;, states categorically that, in British English, &quot;this tiresome and unnecessary practice is now obsolete.&quot;

=====Pronunciation-dependent style and periods=====
Nevertheless, some influential style guides, many of them American, still require periods in certain instances. For example, &quot;The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage&quot; recommends following each segment with a period when the letters are pronounced individually, as in &quot;K.G.B.&quot;, but not when pronounced as a word, as in &quot;NATO&quot;. The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme.

=====Other conventions=====
When a multiple-letter abbreviation is formed from a single word, periods are in general not used, although they may be common in informal usage. &quot;TV&quot;, for example, may stand for a &quot;single&quot; word (&quot;television&quot; or &quot;transvestite&quot;, for instance), and is in general spelled without punctuation (except in the plural). Although &quot;PS&quot; stands for the single English word &quot;postscript&quot; or the Latin &quot;postscriptum&quot;, it is often spelled with periods (&quot;P.S.&quot;) as if parsed as Latin &quot;post scriptum&quot; instead.

The slash (&#x27;/&#x27;, or &quot;solidus&quot;) is sometimes used to separate the letters in an acronym, as in &quot;N/A&quot; (&quot;not applicable, not available&quot;) and &quot;c/o&quot; (&quot;care of&quot;).

Inconveniently long words used frequently in related contexts can be represented according to their letter count as a numeronym. For example, &quot;i18n&quot; abbreviates &quot;internationalization&quot;, a computer-science term for adapting software for worldwide use; the &quot;18&quot; represents the 18 letters that come between the first and the last in &quot;internationalization&quot;. Similarly, &quot;localization&quot; can be abbreviated &quot;l10n&quot;; &quot;multilingualization&quot; &quot;m17n&quot;; and &quot;accessibility&quot; &quot;a11y&quot;. In addition to the use of a specific number replacing that many letters, the more general &quot;x&quot; can be used to replace an unspecified number of letters. Examples include &quot;Crxn&quot; for &quot;crystallization&quot; and the series familiar to physicians for history, diagnosis, and treatment (&quot;hx&quot;, &quot;dx&quot;, &quot;tx&quot;). Terms relating to a command structure may also sometimes use this formatting, for example gold, silver, and bronze levels of command in UK policing being referred to as Gx, Sx, and Bx.

====Representing plurals and possessives====
There is a question about how to pluralize acronyms. Often a writer will add an &#x27;s&#x27; following an apostrophe, as in &quot;PC&#x27;s&quot;. However, Kate L. Turabian&#x27;s &quot;A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations&quot;, writing about style in academic writings, allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms &quot;only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters&quot;. Turabian would therefore prefer &quot;DVDs&quot; and &quot;URLs&quot; but &quot;Ph.D.&#x27;s&quot;. The style guides of the Modern Language Association and American Psychological Association prohibit apostrophes from being used to pluralize acronyms regardless of periods (so &quot;compact discs&quot; would be &quot;CDs&quot; or &quot;C.D.s&quot;), whereas &quot;The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage&quot; requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods (preferring &quot;PC&#x27;s, TV&#x27;s and VCR&#x27;s&quot;).

Possessive plurals that also include apostrophes for mere pluralization and periods appear especially complex: for example, &quot;the C.D.&#x27;s&#x27; labels&quot; (the labels of the compact discs). In some instances, however, an apostrophe may increase clarity: for example, if the final letter of an abbreviation is &quot;S&quot;, as in &quot;SOS&#x27;s&quot; (although abbreviations ending with S can also take &quot;-es&quot;, e.g. &quot;SOSes&quot;), or when pluralizing an abbreviation that has periods.

A particularly rich source of options arises when the plural of an acronym would normally be indicated in a word other than the final word if spelled out in full. A classic example is &quot;Member of Parliament&quot;, which in plural is &quot;Members of Parliament&quot;. It is possible then to abbreviate this as &quot;M&#x27;s P&quot;, which was fairly common in mid-twentieth-century Australian news writing (or similar), and used by former Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley. This usage is less common than forms with &quot;s&quot; at the end, such as &quot;MPs&quot;, and may appear dated or pedantic. In common usage, therefore, &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; becomes &quot;WMDs&quot;, &quot;prisoners of war&quot; becomes &quot;POWs&quot;, and &quot;runs batted in&quot; becomes &quot;RBIs&quot;.

Abbreviations that come from single, rather than multiple, wordssuch as &quot;TV&quot; (&quot;television&quot;)are usually pluralized without apostrophes (&quot;two TVs&quot;); most writers feel that the apostrophe should be reserved for the possessive (&quot;the TV&#x27;s antenna&quot;).

 In some languages, the convention of doubling the letters in the acronym is used to indicate plural words: for example, the Spanish , for (&#x27;United States&#x27;). This old convention is still sometimes followed for a limited number of English abbreviations, such as &quot;SS.&quot; for &quot;Saints&quot;, &quot;pp.&quot; for the plural of &#x27;pages&#x27;, or &quot;mss.&quot; for &quot;manuscripts&quot;.

===Case===
====All-caps style====
The most common capitalization scheme seen with acronyms is all-uppercase (all caps). Small caps are sometimes used to make the run of capital letters seem less jarring to the reader. For example, the style of some American publications, including the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;, is to use small caps for acronyms longer than three letters; thus &quot;U.S.&quot; and &quot;FDR&quot; in normal caps, but &quot;&quot; in small caps. The acronyms &quot;AD&quot; and &quot;BC&quot; are often smallcapped as well, as in: &quot;From &quot;.

====Normal case and anacronyms====
Where an acronym has linguistically taken on an identity as regular word, the acronym may use normal case rules, e.g. it would appear generally in lower case, but with an initial capital when starting a sentence or when in a title. Once knowledge of the words underlying such an acronym has faded from common recall, the acronym may be termed an anacronym. Examples of anacronyms are the words &quot;scuba&quot;, &quot;radar&quot;, and &quot;laser&quot;. The word &quot;an&quot;acro&quot;nym&quot; should not be confused with the word &quot;an&quot;achro&quot;nym&quot;, which is a type of misnomer.

====Mixed-case variant====
Words derived from an acronym by affixing are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root acronym is clear. For example, &quot;pre-WWII politics&quot;, &quot;post-NATO world&quot;, &quot;DNase&quot;. In some cases a derived acronym may also be expressed in mixed case. For example, &quot;messenger RNA&quot; and &quot;transfer RNA&quot; become &quot;mRNA&quot; and &quot;tRNA&quot;.

====Pronunciation-dependent style and case====
Some publications choose to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms, reserving all-caps styling for initialisms, writing the pronounced acronyms &quot;Nato&quot; and &quot;Aids&quot; in mixed case, but the initialisms &quot;USA&quot; and &quot;FBI&quot; in all caps. For example, this is the style used in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;BBC News&quot; typically edits to this style (though its official style guide, dating from 2003, still recommends all-caps). The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme. However, it conflicts with conventional English usage of first-letter upper-casing as a marker of proper names in many cases; e.g. &quot;AIDS&quot; stands for &quot;acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome&quot; which is not a proper name, while &quot;Aids&quot; is in the style of one.

Some style manuals also base the letters&#x27; case on their number. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for example, keeps &quot;NATO&quot; in all capitals (while several guides in the British press may render it &quot;Nato&quot;), but uses lower case in &quot;Unicef&quot; (from &quot;United Nations International Children&#x27;s Emergency Fund&quot;) because it is more than four letters, and to style it in caps might look ungainly (flirting with the appearance of &quot;shouting capitals&quot;).

===Numerals and constituent words===
While abbreviations typically exclude the initials of short function words (such as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, or &quot;to&quot;), this is not always the case. Sometimes function words are included to make a pronounceable acronym, such as CORE (Congress of Racial Equality). Sometimes the letters representing these words are written in lower case, such as in the cases of &quot;TfL&quot; (&quot;Transport for London&quot;) and &quot;LotR&quot; (&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;); this usually occurs when the acronym represents a multi-word proper noun.

Numbers (both cardinal and ordinal) in names are often represented by digits rather than initial letters, as in &quot;4GL&quot; (&quot;fourth generation language&quot;) or &quot;G77&quot; (&quot;Group of 77&quot;). Large numbers may use metric prefixes, as with &quot;Y2K&quot; for &quot;Year 2000&quot;. Exceptions using initials for numbers include &quot;TLA&quot; (&quot;three-letter acronym/abbreviation&quot;) and &quot;GoF&quot; (&quot;Gang of Four&quot;). Abbreviations using numbers for other purposes include repetitions, such as &quot;A2DP&quot; (&quot;Advanced Audio Distribution Profile&quot;), &quot;W3C&quot; (&quot;World Wide Web Consortium&quot;), and &quot;T3&quot; (&quot;Trends, Tips &amp; Tools for Everyday Living&quot;); pronunciation, such as &quot;B2B&quot; (&quot;business to business&quot;); and numeronyms, such as &quot;i18n&quot; (&quot;internationalization&quot;; &quot;18&quot; represents the 18 letters between the initial &quot;i&quot; and the final &quot;n&quot;).

===Casing of expansions===
Authors of expository writing will sometimes capitalize or otherwise distinctively format the initials of the expansion for pedagogical emphasis (for example, writing: &quot;the onset of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)&quot; or &quot;the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)&quot;). Capitalization like this, however, conflicts with the convention of English orthography, which generally reserves capitals in the middle of sentences for proper nouns; when following the AMA Manual of Style, this would instead be rendered as &quot;the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)&quot;.

==Changes to (or wordplay on) the expanded meaning==
=== Pseudo-acronyms and orphan initialisms===
Some apparent acronyms or other abbreviations do not stand for anything and cannot be expanded to some meaning. Such pseudo-acronyms may be pronunciation-based, such as &quot;BBQ&quot; (&quot;bee-bee-cue&quot;), for &quot;barbecue&quot;, and &quot;K9&quot; (&quot;kay-nine&quot;) for &quot;canine&quot;. Pseudo-acronyms also frequently develop as &quot;orphan initialisms&quot;: an existing acronym is redefined as a non-acronymous name, severing its link to its previous meaning. For example, the letters of the &quot;SAT&quot;, a US college entrance test originally dubbed &quot;Scholastic Aptitude Test&quot;, no longer officially stand for anything. The US-based abortion-rights organization &quot;NARAL&quot; is another example of this; in that case, the organization changed its name three times, with the long-form of the name always corresponding to the letters &quot;NARAL&quot;, before eventually opting to simply be known by the short-form, without being connected to a long-form.

This is common with companies that want to retain brand recognition while moving away from an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became AT&amp;T and British Petroleum became BP. &quot;Russia Today&quot; has rebranded itself as &quot;RT&quot;. American Movie Classics has simply rebranded itself as AMC. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc.; The Learning Channel became TLC; MTV dropped the name Music Television out of its brand; and American District Telegraph became simply known as ADT. &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot; went partway, re-branding itself with its initialism &quot;KFC&quot; to de-emphasize the role of frying in the preparation of its signature dishes, though they have since returned to using both interchangeably. The East Coast Hockey League became the ECHL when it expanded to include cities in the western United States prior to the 2003–2004 season.

Pseudo-acronyms may have advantages in international markets: for example, some national affiliates of International Business Machines are legally incorporated with &quot;IBM&quot; in their names (for example, IBM Canada) to avoid translating the full name into local languages. Likewise, UBS is the name of the merged Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, and HSBC has replaced the long name Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Some companies which have a name giving a clear indication of their place of origin will choose to use acronyms when expanding to foreign markets: for example, Toronto-Dominion Bank continues to operate under the full name in Canada, but its U.S. subsidiary is known as TD Bank, just as Royal Bank of Canada used its full name in Canada (a constitutional monarchy), but its U.S. subsidiary is called RBC Bank. The India-based JSW Group of companies is another example of the original name (Jindal South West Group) being re-branded into a pseudo-acronym while expanding into other geographical areas in and outside of India.

===Redundant acronyms and RAS syndrome===
Rebranding can lead to redundant acronym syndrome, as when Trustee Savings Bank became TSB Bank, or when Railway Express Agency became REA Express. A few high-tech companies have taken the redundant acronym to the extreme: for example, ISM Information Systems Management Corp. and SHL Systemhouse Ltd. Examples in entertainment include the television shows &quot;&quot; and &quot;Navy: NCIS&quot; (&quot;Navy&quot; was dropped in the second season), where the redundancy was likely designed to educate new viewers as to what the initials stood for. The same reasoning was in evidence when the Royal Bank of Canada&#x27;s Canadian operations rebranded to RBC Royal Bank, or when Bank of Montreal rebranded their retail banking subsidiary BMO Bank of Montreal.

Another common example is &quot;RAM memory&quot;, which is redundant because &quot;RAM&quot; (&quot;random-access memory&quot;) includes the initial of the word &quot;memory&quot;. &quot;PIN&quot; stands for &quot;personal identification number&quot;, obviating the second word in &quot;PIN number&quot;; in this case its retention may be motivated to avoid ambiguity with the homophonous word &quot;pin&quot;. Other examples include &quot;ATM machine&quot;, &quot;EAB bank&quot;, &quot;HIV virus&quot;, Microsoft&#x27;s NT Technology, and the formerly redundant &quot;SAT test&quot;, now simply &quot;SAT Reasoning Test&quot;). TNN (The Nashville/National Network) also renamed itself &quot;The New TNN&quot; for a brief interlude.

===Redefined acronyms===
In some cases, while the initials in an acronym may stay the same, for what those letters stand may change. Examples include the following:

*DVD was originally an acronym for the unofficial term &quot;digital video disc&quot;, but is now stated by the DVD Forum as standing for &quot;Digital Versatile Disc&quot;
*GAO changed the full form of its name from &quot;General Accounting Office&quot; to &quot;Government Accountability Office&quot;
*GPO changed the full form of its name from &quot;Government Printing Office&quot; to &quot;Government Publishing Office&quot;
*RAID was originally an acronym for &quot;Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks&quot; but has since been redefined as &quot;Redundant Array of Independent Disks&quot;
*The UICC was founded as the &quot;International Union Against Cancer&quot;, and its initials originally came from the Romance-language versions of that name (such as French ). The English expansion of its name has since been changed to &quot;Union for International Cancer Control&quot; so that it would also correspond to the UICC acronym.
*WWF was originally an acronym for &quot;World Wildlife Fund&quot;, but now stands for &quot;World Wide Fund for Nature&quot; (although the organization&#x27;s branches in the U.S. and Canada still use the original name)

===Backronyms===

A &quot;backronym&quot; (or &quot;bacronym&quot;) is a phrase that is constructed &quot;after the fact&quot; from a previously existing word. For example, the novelist and critic Anthony Burgess once proposed that the word &quot;book&quot; ought to stand for &quot;box of organized knowledge&quot;. A classic real-world example of this is the name of the predecessor to the Apple Macintosh, the Apple Lisa, which was said to refer to &quot;Local Integrated Software Architecture&quot;, but was actually named after Steve Jobs&#x27;s daughter, born in 1978.

Backronyms are oftentimes used for comedic effect. An example of creating a backronym for comedic effect would be in naming a group or organization, the name &quot;A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.&quot; stands for (among other things) &quot;a clever regiment of nerdy young men&quot;.

===Contrived acronyms===

Acronyms are sometimes , that is, deliberately designed to be especially apt for the thing being named (by having a dual meaning or by borrowing the positive connotations of an existing word). Some examples of contrived acronyms are &quot;USA PATRIOT&quot;, &quot;CAN SPAM&quot;, &quot;CAPTCHA&quot; and &quot;ACT UP&quot;. The clothing company French Connection began referring to itself as &quot;fcuk&quot;, standing for &quot;French Connection United Kingdom&quot;. The company then created T-shirts and several advertising campaigns that exploit the acronym&#x27;s similarity to the taboo word &quot;fuck&quot;. Contrived acronyms find frequent use as names of fictional agencies, with a famous example being frequent James Bond antagonist organization SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion).

The U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is known for developing contrived acronyms to name projects, including &quot;RESURRECT&quot;, &quot;NIRVANA&quot;, and &quot;DUDE&quot;. In July 2010, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine reported that DARPA announced programs to &quot;transform biology from a descriptive to a predictive field of science&quot; named &quot;BATMAN&quot; and &quot;ROBIN&quot; for &quot;Biochronicity and Temporal Mechanisms Arising in Nature&quot; and &quot;Robustness of Biologically-Inspired Networks&quot;, a reference to comic-book superheroes Batman and Robin.

The short-form names of clinical trials and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, as well as many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as names within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of mnemonic reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in medicine include the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) and the CHARM trial (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity). The fact that RAS syndrome is often involved, as well as that the letters often do not entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the archetypal form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the of clinical trial acronyms, as with gene and protein symbols, is simply to have a syntactically usable and easily recalled short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not memorized. It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of &quot;cutesy&quot; examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short name&#x27;s chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a name, rather than being a and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been (1) that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document, and (2) that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as three different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain them somewhere in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication. At least one study has evaluated the citation impact and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others, finding both good aspects (mnemonic help, name recall) and potential flaws (connotatively driven bias).

Some acronyms are chosen deliberately to avoid a name considered undesirable: For example, (&quot;ViB&quot;), a German telenovela, was first intended to be (&#x27;All for Love&#x27;), but was changed to avoid the resultant acronym &quot;ANAL&quot;. Likewise, the Computer Literacy and Internet Technology qualification is known as &quot;CLaIT&quot;, rather than &quot;CLIT&quot;. In Canada, the Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance (Party) was quickly renamed to the &quot;Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance&quot; when its opponents pointed out that its initials spelled CCRAP (pronounced &quot;see crap&quot;). Two Irish institutes of technology (Galway and Tralee) chose different acronyms from other institutes when they were upgraded from regional technical colleges. Tralee RTC became the Institute of Technology Tralee (ITT), as opposed to Tralee Institute of Technology (TIT). Galway RTC became Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), as opposed to Galway Institute of Technology (). The charity sports organization Team in Training is known as &quot;TNT&quot; and not &quot;TIT&quot;. Technological Institute of Textile &amp; Sciences, however, is still known as &quot;TITS&quot;. George Mason University was planning to name their law school the &quot;Antonin Scalia School of Law&quot; (ASSOL) in honor of the late Antonin Scalia, only to change it to the &quot;Antonin Scalia Law School&quot; later.

===Macronyms/nested acronyms===

A macronym, or nested acronym, is an acronym in which one or more letters stand for acronyms (or abbreviations) themselves. The word &quot;macronym&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;&quot; and &quot;acronym&quot;.

Some examples of macronyms are:
* XHR stands for &quot;XML HTTP Request&quot;, in which &quot;XML&quot; is &quot;Extensible Markup Language&quot;, and HTTP stands for &quot;HyperText Transfer Protocol&quot;
* POWER stands for &quot;Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC&quot;, in which &quot;RISC&quot; stands for &quot;reduced instruction set computer&quot;
* VHDL stands for &quot;VHSIC Hardware Description Language&quot;, in which &quot;VHSIC&quot; stands for &quot;Very High Speed Integrated Circuit&quot;
* XSD stands for &quot;XML Schema Definition&quot;, in which &quot;XML&quot; stands for &quot;Extensible Markup Language&quot;
* AIM stands for &quot;AOL Instant Messenger&quot;, in which &quot;AOL&quot; originally stood for &quot;America Online&quot;
* HASP stood for &quot;Houston Automatic Spooling Priority&quot;, but &quot;spooling&quot; itself was an acronym: &quot;simultaneous peripheral operations on-line&quot;
* VORTAC stands for &quot;VOR+TACAN&quot;, in which &quot;VOR&quot; is &quot;VHF omnidirectional range&quot; (where VHF = very high frequency radio) and &quot;TAC&quot; is short for TACAN, which stands for &quot;tactical air navigation&quot;
* Global Information Assurance Certification has a number of nested acronyms for its certifications, e.g. &quot;GSEC&quot; is an acronym for &quot;GIAC Security Essentials&quot;
* RBD stands for &quot;REM Behavior Disorder&quot;, in which &quot;REM&quot; stands for &quot;rapid eye movement&quot;

Some macronyms can be multiply nested: the second-order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy. In an informal competition run by the magazine &quot;New Scientist&quot;, a fully documented specimen was discovered that may be the most deeply nested of all: RARS is the &quot;Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service&quot;; ATOVS is &quot;Advanced TOVS&quot;; TOVS is &quot;TIROS operational vertical sounder&quot;; and TIROS is &quot;Television infrared observational satellite&quot;. Fully expanded, &quot;RARS&quot; might thus become &quot;Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service&quot;, which would produce the much more unwieldy acronym &quot;RATIOSOVSRS&quot;.

Another example is VITAL, which expands to &quot;VHDL Initiative Towards ASIC Libraries&quot; (a total of 15 words when fully expanded).

However, to say that &quot;RARS&quot; stands directly for that string of words, or can be interchanged with it in syntax (in the same way that &quot;CHF&quot; can be usefully interchanged with &quot;congestive heart failure&quot;), is a prescriptive misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description; the true nature of such a term is closer to anacronymic than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are. The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to &quot;spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations&quot;, but the former are irreducible in that respect; they can be annotated with parenthetical explanations, but they cannot be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way. Just as the words &quot;laser&quot; and &quot;radar&quot; function as words in syntax and cognition without a need to focus on their acronymic origins, terms such as &quot;RARS&quot; and &quot;CHA2DS2–VASc score&quot; are irreducible in natural language; if they are purged, the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule, but it cannot be described as remaining natural. Similarly, protein and gene nomenclature, which uses symbols extensively, includes such terms as the name of the NACHT protein domain, which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domain – NAIP (NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein), C2TA (major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from &quot;Podospora anserine&quot;), and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein) – but is not syntactically reducible to them. The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym, and its expansion cannot replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a name within a clause clearly parsable by human readers or listeners.

====Recursive acronyms====

A special type of macronym, the recursive acronym, has letters whose expansion refers back to the macronym itself. One of the earliest examples appears in &quot;The Hacker&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; as MUNG, which stands for &quot;MUNG Until No Good&quot;.

Some examples of recursive acronyms are:
* GNU stands for &quot;GNU&#x27;s Not Unix!&quot;
* LAME stands for &quot;LAME Ain&#x27;t an MP3 Encoder&quot;
* PHP stands for &quot;PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor&quot;
* WINE stands for &quot;WINE Is Not an Emulator&quot;
* HURD stands for &quot;HIRD of Unix-replacing daemons&quot;, where HIRD itself stands for &quot;HURD of interfaces representing depth&quot; (a &quot;mutually recursive&quot; acronym)

==Non-English languages==
===Specific languages===
====Chinese====
With English terminology, discussions of languages with syllabic or logographic writing systems (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), &quot;acronyms&quot; describe the short forms that take selected characters from a multi-character word.

For example, in Chinese, &#x27;university&#x27; (/, ) is usually abbreviated simply as (&#x27;great&#x27;) when used with the name of the institute. So &#x27;Peking University&#x27; () is commonly shortened to ( &#x27;north-great&#x27;) by also only taking the first character of &quot;Peking&quot;, the &quot;northern capital&quot; (). In some cases, however, other characters than the first can be selected. For example, the local short form of &#x27;Hong Kong University&#x27; () uses () rather than .

There are also cases where some longer phrases are abbreviated drastically, especially in Chinese politics, where proper nouns were initially translated from Soviet Leninist terms. For instance, the full name of China&#x27;s highest ruling council, the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), is &#x27;Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China&#x27; (). The term then reduced the &#x27;Communist Party of China&#x27; part of its name through acronyms, then the &#x27;Standing Committee&#x27; part, again through acronyms, to create . Alternatively, it omitted the &#x27;Communist Party&#x27; part altogether, creating &#x27;Politburo Standing Committee&#x27; (), and eventually just &#x27;Standing Committee&#x27; (). The PSC&#x27;s members full designations are &#x27;Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China&#x27; (); this was eventually drastically reduced to simply (), with the term () used increasingly for officials destined for a future seat on the PSC. In another example, the word (&#x27;National People&#x27;s Congress&#x27;) can be broken into four parts: = &#x27;the whole nation&#x27;, = &#x27;people&#x27;, = &#x27;representatives&#x27;, = &#x27;conference&#x27;. Yet, in its short form (literally &#x27;man/people big&#x27;), only the first characters from the second and the fourth parts are selected; the first part () and the third part () are completely dropped.

Many proper nouns become shorter and shorter over time. For example, the CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala, whose full name is literally read as &#x27;China Central Television Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala&#x27; () was first shortened to &#x27;Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala&#x27; (), but eventually referred to as simply (). In the same vein, CCTV or () was reduced to () in the mid-2000s.

====Korean====
Many aspects of academics in Korea follow similar acronym patterns as Chinese, owing to the two languages&#x27; commonalities, like using the word for &#x27;big&#x27; or &#x27;great&#x27; i.e. (), to refer to universities (; , literally &#x27;great learning&#x27; although &#x27;big school&#x27; is an acceptable alternate). They can be interpreted similarly to American university appellations, such as &quot;UPenn&quot; or &quot;Texas Tech&quot;.

Some acronyms are shortened forms of the school&#x27;s name, like how Hongik University (, ) is shortened to (, &#x27;Hong, the big [school]&#x27; or &#x27;Hong-U&#x27;) Other acronyms can refer to the university&#x27;s main subject, e.g. Korea National University of Education (, ) is shortened to (교원대, &#x27;Big Ed.&#x27; or &#x27;Ed.-U&#x27;). Other schools use a Koreanized version of their English acronym. The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (, ) is referred to as KAIST (, ) in both English and Korean. The 3 most prestigious schools in Korea are known as SKY (, ), combining the first letter of their English names (Seoul National, Korea, and Yonsei Universities). In addition, the College Scholastic Ability Test (, ) is shortened to (, &#x27;S.A.&#x27;).

====Japanese====

The Japanese language makes extensive use of abbreviations, but only some of these are acronyms.

Chinese-based words (Sino-Japanese vocabulary) uses similar acronym formation to Chinese, like for . In some cases alternative pronunciations are used, as in Saikyō for 埼京, from , rather than Saitō.

Non-Chinese foreign borrowings (gairaigo) are instead frequently abbreviated as clipped compounds, rather than acronyms, using several initial sounds. This is visible in katakana transcriptions of foreign words, but is also found with native words (written in hiragana). For example, the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise&#x27;s name originally stood for &quot;pocket monsters&quot; ( [po-ke-tto-mon-su-tā] → ), which is still the long-form of the name in Japanese, and &quot;wāpuro&quot; stands for &quot;word processor&quot; ( [wā-do-pu-ro-se-ssā]→ ).

====German====
To a greater degree than English does, German tends toward acronyms that use initial syllables rather than initial single letters, although it uses many of the latter type as well. Some examples of the syllabic type are rather than &quot;GSP&quot; (for , &#x27;Secret State Police&#x27;); rather than &quot;FAK&quot; (for , &#x27;anti-aircraft gun&#x27;); rather than &quot;KP&quot; (for , &#x27;detective division police&#x27;). The extension of such contraction to a pervasive or whimsical degree has been mockingly labeled (for , &#x27;strange habit of abbreviating&#x27;). Examples of include (for , &#x27;short in the front, long in the back&#x27;, i.e., a mullet haircut) and the mocking of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s title as (, &#x27;Greatest General of all Time&#x27;).

====Hebrew====

It is common to take more than just one initial letter from each of the words composing the acronym; regardless of this, the abbreviation sign gershayim is always written between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym, even if by this it separates letters of the same original word. Examples (keep in mind Hebrew reads right-to-left): (for , the United States); (for , the Soviet Union); (for , Rishon LeZion); (for , the school). An example that takes only the initial letters from its component words is (, for , Israel Defense Forces). In inflected forms, the abbreviation sign remains between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. &#x27;report&#x27;, singular: , plural: ; &#x27;squad commander&#x27;, masculine: , feminine: ).

====Indonesian====

There is also a widespread use of acronyms in Indonesia in every aspect of social life. For example, the political party stands for , stands for (&#x27;National Monument&#x27;), the public transport stands for (&#x27;city public transportation&#x27;), stands for (&#x27;internet cafe&#x27;), and many others. Some acronyms are considered formal (or officially adopted), while many more are considered informal, slang, or colloquial.

The capital&#x27;s metropolitan area (Jakarta and its surrounding satellite regions), , is another acronym. This stands for . Many highways are also named by the acronym method; e.g. (&#x27;Toll Road&#x27;) (), (), and ().

In some languages, especially those that use certain alphabets, many acronyms come from the governmental use, particularly in the military and law enforcement services. The Indonesian military (TNI – ) and Indonesian police (POLRI – ) are known for heavy acronyms use. Examples include the (; &#x27;Special Forces Command&#x27;), (; &#x27;Frogmen Command&#x27;), (; &#x27;Military District Command&#x27; – one of the Indonesian army&#x27;s administrative divisions), (; &#x27;Head Sergeant&#x27;), (; &#x27;Military Academy&#x27; – in Magelang), and many other terms regarding ranks, units, divisions, procedures, etc.

==== Malay ====
Although not as common as in Indonesian, a number of Malay words are formed by merging two words, such as from (&#x27;kindergarten&#x27;) and from . This, however, has been less prevalent in the modern era, in contrary to Indonesian. It is still often for names such as organisation names, among the most famous being MARA from (&#x27;People&#x27;s Trust Council&#x27;), a government agency in Malaysia.

Some acronyms are developed from the Jawi (Malay in Arabic script) spelling of the name and may not reflect its Latin counterpart such as PAS from (&#x27;Malaysian Islamic Party&#x27;) which originated from the Jawi acronym , with the same pronunciation, since the first letter of the word &#x27;Islam&#x27; in Jawi uses the letter Aleph, which is pronounced like the letter &quot;A&quot; when in such position as in the acronym.

Rules in writing initialisms in Malay differ based on its script. In its Latin form, the initialism would be spelt much like in English, using capitals written without any spacing, such as TNB for .

In Jawi, however, the way initialisms are different depending on the source language. For Malay initialisms, the initial Jawi letters would be written separated by a period such as for . If the initialism is from a different language, however, it would be written by transliterating each letter from the original language, such as for MCMC, or for Α.Π.Θ.

====Russian====
Acronyms that use parts of words (not necessarily syllables) are commonplace in Russian as well, e.g. (), for (, &#x27;gas industry&#x27;). There are also initialisms, such as (&#x27;SMI&#x27;, for , &#x27;means of mass informing&#x27;; () combines two initials and three letters of the final word: it stands for (, &#x27;Chief Administration of Camps&#x27;).

Historically, &quot;OTMA&quot; was an acronym sometimes used by the daughters of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia and his consort, Alexandra Feodorovna, as a group nickname for themselves, built from the first letter of each girl&#x27;s name in the order of their births: Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia.

====Swahili====
In Swahili, acronyms are common for naming organizations such as &quot;TUKI&quot;, which stands for (&#x27;Institute for Swahili Research&#x27;). Multiple initial letters (often the initial syllable of words) are often drawn together, as seen more in some languages than others.

====Vietnamese====
In Vietnamese, which has an abundance of compound words, initialisms are very commonly used for both proper and common nouns. Examples include &quot;TP.HCM&quot; (, &#x27;Ho Chi Minh City&#x27;), &quot;THPT&quot; (, &#x27;high school&#x27;), &quot;CLB&quot; (, &#x27;club&#x27;), &quot;CSDL&quot; (, &#x27;database&#x27;), &quot;NXB&quot; (, &#x27;publisher&#x27;), (, a general form of address), and (, &#x27;Vietnamese Martyrs&#x27;). Longer examples include &quot;CHXHCNVN&quot; (, &#x27;Socialist Republic of Vietnam&#x27;) and &quot;MTDTGPMNVN&quot; (, &#x27;Liberation Army of South Vietnam or the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam&#x27;). Long initialisms have become widespread in legal contexts in Vietnam, for example &quot;TTLT-VKSNDTC-TANDTC&quot;. It is also common for a writer to coin an ad hoc initialism for repeated use in an article.

Each letter in an initialism corresponds to one morpheme, that is, one syllable. When the first letter of a syllable has a tone mark or other diacritic, the diacritic may be omitted from the initialism, for example or for (&#x27;Southeast Asia&#x27;) and &quot;LMCA&quot; or for (&#x27;European Union&#x27;). The letter is often replaced by &quot;W&quot; in initialisms to avoid confusion with &quot;U&quot;, for example &quot;UBTWMTTQVN&quot; or for (&#x27;Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front&#x27;).

Initialisms are purely a written convenience, being pronounced the same way as their expansions. As the names of many Vietnamese letters are disyllabic, it would be less convenient to pronounce an initialism by its individual letters. Acronyms pronounced as words are rare in Vietnamese, occurring when an acronym itself is borrowed from another language. Examples include (), a respelling of the French acronym &quot;SIDA&quot; (&#x27;AIDS&#x27;); &quot;VOA&quot; (), a literal reading of the English initialism for &#x27;Voice of America&#x27;; and &quot;NASA&quot; (), borrowed directly from the English acronym.

As in Chinese, many compound words can be shortened to the first syllable when forming a longer word. For example, the term is derived from the first syllables of (&#x27;Vietnam&#x27;) and (&#x27;communist&#x27;). This mechanism is limited to Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary. Unlike with Chinese, such clipped compounds are considered to be portmanteau words or blend words rather than acronyms or initialisms, because the Vietnamese alphabet still requires each component word to be written as more than one character.

===General grammatical considerations===
====Declension====
In languages where nouns are declined, various methods are used. An example is Finnish, where a colon is used to separate inflection from the letters:
*An acronym is pronounced as a word: NATO or Nato – &#x27;into Nato&#x27;; another example is &#x27;from NASA&#x27;
*An acronym is pronounced as letters: EU – &#x27;into [the] EU&#x27;
*An acronym is interpreted as words: EU – &#x27;into [the] EU&#x27;
The process above is similar to the way that hyphens are used for clarity in English when prefixes are added to acronyms: thus &quot;pre-NATO policy&quot; (rather than &quot;preNATO&quot;).

====Lenition====
In languages such as Scottish Gaelic and Irish, where lenition (initial consonant mutation) is commonplace, acronyms must also be modified in situations where case and context dictate it. In the case of Scottish Gaelic, a lower-case &quot;h&quot; is often added after the initial consonant; for example, &#x27;BBC Scotland&#x27; in the genitive case would be written as , with the acronym pronounced &quot;VBC&quot;. Likewise, the Gaelic acronym for &#x27;television&#x27; is , pronounced &quot;TV&quot;, as in English.

<text>Almas del Silencio (English: &quot;Souls from the Silence&quot;) is the seventh studio album and fifth Spanish-language album recorded by Puerto Rican-American recording artist Ricky Martin. This is the first Spanish album release since 1998&#x27;s &quot;Vuelve&quot;. The album witch released by Sony Discos and Columbia Records on May 20, 2003. The album was released in 38 non-Hispanic countries and reached top ten in Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal, Norway and Finland.

== Background and development ==
Martin initially planned to release an English-language album, which was supposed to be his first complete work in the field of songwriting. He changed his mind: 

Martin noted about the language: &quot;Many countries are releasing [this album] simply as Ricky Martin&#x27;s next album, period. They know me as a Latino who recorded an album in English. And the next English-language album will be Ricky Martin&#x27;s next album, period.&quot;

Martin said of the new album: &quot;I really needed to go back to focus, to my center, to the beginning. I had the need to search within, and really dig deep, and find those emotions that, because of the adrenaline and the euphoria that I lived for a couple of years, were probably sabotaged.&quot; Therefore, he asked the songwriters for tracks that &quot;reflect his own state of mind, expressing his yearning for his native Puerto Rico and for the simpler things in life.&quot;

== Singles ==
&quot;Tal Vez&quot; was released as the lead single of &quot;Almas del Silencio&quot; on March 24, 2003, it was written by the Venezuelan singer-songwriter Franco De Vita, who wrote &quot;Vuelve&quot;, the title track of the last album in Spanish from Martin. &quot;Tal Vez&quot; is a radical ballad that never turns cloying. The single debuted at No. 1 on the US Hot Latin Tracks, It was the first time that list has seen a No. 1 debut since February 7, 1998, when Los Temerarios &quot;Porque Te Conoci&quot; (Why Did I Meet You) bowed in the top slot, then spent 11 weeks on top of the Hot Latin Songs. &quot;Tal Vez&quot; also debuted at No. 1 on the Latin Pop Airplay (thirteen weeks on top) and at No. 4 on the list of Tropical Airplay (weeks later it reached number one). It also reached number seventy-four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, thanks to its seventy-three peak on the Hot 100 Airplay. &quot;Tal Vez&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Songs Year-End Chart. Also reached number 1 in Argentina, Chile, Central America, Mexico and Venezuela. Martin performed &quot;Tal Vez&quot; at the Latin Billboard Music Awards on May 8 in Miami.

&quot;Jaleo&quot; it was the first international single and the second single from the album. It was released on April 28, 2003, internationally and in July 2003 in the United States. &quot;Jaleo&quot;, a Spanish word with various definitions, but it basically means &quot;to clap&quot; or, rather, yell out words of excitement such as &quot;¡olé!&quot; and &quot;¡eso!&quot; usually during flamenco and merengue performances. The song has reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks and number two on the Latin Pop Airplay. He also entered the charts in Belgium, Germany, France, Norway, Sweden and Japan with the single achieving the top 10 positions in Spain (# 1 for four weeks), Italy and Sweden and Top 30 entries in Denmark, Holland and Switzerland.

&quot;Asignatura Pendiente&quot; was released as the third single on July 14, 2003. The song was written by Guatemalan singer-songwriter Ricardo Arjona and produced by Tommy Torres, is about the artist&#x27;s experiences, whatever it may be, not only Ricky Martin, but in the mouth of the Puerto Rican singer. This refers to his beginnings with the famous group Menudo&quot;, how success has influenced his life and the nostalgia he feels far from his native Puerto Rico, which also applies to Ricardo Arjona, due to his ex-wife and very good friends of the island. In &quot;Asignatura Pendiente&quot; lovelessness, sacrifice and lived rewards are evidenced. The song has reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks and number four on the Latin Pop Airplay.

&quot;Juramento&quot; it was the second international single and the fourth single from the album. It was released on September 8, 2003. The Spanglish version is called &quot;Juramento (The Way to Love)&quot;. The song reached number eleven in Spain, number forty-five in Italy, number fifty-seven in Switzerland and number ninety-two in Germany.

&quot;Y Todo Queda en Nada&quot; is the fifth and final single from the album. It was released as a promotional single on November 24, 2003, in Latin territories. The song reached number one on the Hot Latin Tracks in the United States and stayed at the top for one week. It arrived at peak number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100, it also peaked at number two on the Latin Pop Airplay and Latin Tropical Airplay. In 2004 the song he stayed with number 4 of &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Songs Year-End Chart. On February 26, in Miami, Martin performed &quot;Y todo Queda en Nada&quot; along with &quot;Jaleo&quot; at the Premio Lo Nuestro.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Almas del Silencio&quot; released by Sony Discos debuted at number one on the US Top Latin Albums and stayed there for six weeks. The album has also made the highest charting debut on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (# 12) of any Spanish-language album in the SoundScan era, selling more than 65,000 copies the first week.

In total, he sold 261,000 copies in the US. It was certified 4× Platinum Latin award by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), indicating shipments of over 400,000 copies in the country. Outside the United States, it was certified Platinum in Spain and Argentina, and Gold in Mexico and Switzerland. The album has sold over two million copies worldwide.

<text>Ludwig van Beethoven is one of the most influential figures in the history of classical music. Since his lifetime, when he was &quot;universally accepted as the greatest living composer&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s music has remained among the most performed, discussed and reviewed in the Western world. Scholarly journals are devoted to analysis of his life and work. He has been the subject of numerous biographies and monographs, and his music was the driving force behind the development of Schenkerian analysis. He is widely considered among the most important composers, and along with Bach and Mozart, his music is the most frequently recorded.

Beethoven expanded the formal and emotional scope – not to mention length – of nearly every genre in which he wrote. While he is most famous for his heightening of the symphonic form, Beethoven also had a dramatic influence on the piano sonata, violin sonata, string quartet and piano concerto, among several others. Only in the realm of vocal composition – opera and the mass – was his effect on later generations muted.

Beethoven&#x27;s stylistic innovations bridge the Classical and Romantic periods. The works of his early period brought the Classical form to its highest expressive level, expanding in formal, structural, and harmonic terms the musical idiom developed by predecessors such as Mozart and Haydn. The works of his middle period were more forward-looking, contributing to the musical language and thinking of the Romantic era, inspiring composers such as Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, and Johannes Brahms. His late period works were characterized by formal, harmonic, and structural experimentation at the highest level, often pointing toward contrapuntal tendencies and microscopic textures, as well as an increasingly introverted compositional outlook. Though rightly credited as a major harbinger of the Romantic era in music that followed, Beethoven never abandoned fundamental aesthetical paradigms and a generally objective artistic philosophy characterizing musical Classicism to the same extent that later composers such as Berlioz or even Schubert did.

==Overview==
Beethoven&#x27;s musical output has traditionally been divided into three periods, a classification that dates to the first years after the composer&#x27;s death in 1827 and was formalised with the publication of Wilhelm von Lenz&#x27;s influential work &quot;Beethoven et ses trois styles&quot; (Beethoven and his Three Styles). Lenz proposed that Beethoven&#x27;s creative output be marked by three periods of distinct stylistic personality and he identified specific compositions as milestones for each period. Lenz considers that the first period opens with the Piano Trios of op. 1, and culminates with the performances in 1800 of his first symphony and Septet. The second period spans the period from the publication of his Moonlight Sonata to the Piano Sonata in E minor, Op. 90 in 1814. The last period covers Beethoven&#x27;s works after Op. 90 to his death in 1827.

Although later scholars have called into question such a simplistic categorisation, it is still widely used. Extensive subsequent analytical consideration of Lenz&#x27;s thesis has resulted in a slight revision of his original dates and broad consensus regarding Beethoven&#x27;s three periods is as follows:

* a formative period that extends to 1802
* a middle period from 1802 to 1814,
* a late period from 1814 to 1827

Generally, each period demonstrates characteristic stylistic evolutions in Beethoven&#x27;s musical language and preoccupations as well as important developments in the composer&#x27;s personal life. For example, the middle period was ushered in by the &#x27;Heiligenstadt Testament&#x27;, a letter in which Beethoven, despairing about his hearing loss, considers and then rejects taking his life. On the other hand, the late period began with a period where Beethoven, suffering from the aftereffects of a myriad of personal and external crises, including the episode of the &#x27;Immortal Beloved&#x27;, struggled to compose for several years.

==Early period==
Many of Beethoven&#x27;s early works were not assigned an opus number and were simply listed with the label WoO, which is the abbreviation for the German term &quot;works without opus number.&quot; Some, however, were published with opus numbers later on such as several compositions in the Eight Songs, op. 52. Although these were compiled between 1803 and 1805 and published in the latter year, were written during his early years in Vienna and Bonn.
The compositions that Beethoven wrote in his formative period can be generally characterized by the composer&#x27;s efforts to master the predominant classical language of the period. His works from this period can be subdivided into two, based on the composer&#x27;s residence. First, various juvenalia, written when the adolescent Beethoven was in residence in Bonn and heavily indebted to the works of contemporaries, especially Mozart and his teacher, Christian Gottlob Neefe. These early efforts can be seen in a set of three piano sonatas (WoO 47) and piano quartets (WoO 36) that Beethoven wrote before 1792. The Quartets, for instance, are each specifically modelled after three Violin Sonatas Mozart published in 1781 – K 296, 379 and 380 – and Beethoven would later draw upon this familiarity in the composition of several of his own Violin Sonatas.

Second, a number of more substantial and original works were written after Beethoven moved to Vienna and commenced studies with the famed Austrian composer and leading musical figure of the period, Joseph Haydn. As the 1790s progressed, his mastery of the Viennese style became increasingly clear, and his works became more and more experimental, especially in genres like the piano sonata. By the period 1798-1802, his piano sonatas had become increasingly more experimental, but his Op. 18 string quartets and first symphony are more conservative than the sonatas, probably a symptom of his relative inexperience in composing in these genres in comparison to the piano sonata.

=== Bonn period ===

With the exception of a visit to Vienna in 1787, Beethoven lived in Bonn until 1792, where he worked in the court chapel of the Elector of Cologne. His stints in the court chapel exposed him to a wide variety of musical style, not just from Vienna, but also from Venice and Rome. In addition to this, he played the viola in the orchestra of the Bonn Court Theatre from 1789, which exposed him to operas like Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. Some forty compositions from this period are extant, including ten early works written by the young adolescent Beethoven when he was being promoted as a child prodigy performer and published as a result of the efforts of his teacher. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly because his superiors in the palace chapel and court theatre did not compose music for the court, and thus not providing an example for the young Beethoven, and also because of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in Johann Nikolaus Forkel&#x27;s influential &quot;Musikalischer Almanack&quot; compared Beethoven&#x27;s efforts to those of rank beginners. Whatever the case, most of Beethoven&#x27;s earliest surviving works were written after he turned twenty, between 1790 and 1792. Some of this music was later published by Beethoven, or incorporated into later works. As such, they provide an important foundation for judging the later evolution of his style.

Beethoven&#x27;s early publications have been notable for scholars because of the view that it already indicated success as a child composer. One assessment stated that &quot;if a child composer managed only a single published item, this might not indicate much, but if they had at least two publications, this is far more significant, for it suggests that the first one had had some success.&quot; Beethoven&#x27;s childhood compositions had been published until 1784. An account cited how, by age thirteen, the child prodigy was already established, having composed three sonatas and four small works in addition to the earlier work called Dressler Variations. This is significant because, at this point, he no longer needed to be taught by a tutor, who would have influenced his musical style.

In general, Beethoven&#x27;s earliest compositions show his struggles to master the prevailing classical style, both in structural and idiomatic terms. Several works, including two he later published, show the incipient signs of his later individual style: twelve Lieder, several of which he published in 1805 as Opus 52, his Wind Octet, later published as Opus 103, and several sets of Variations, including one (WoO 40) for violin and piano on Mozart&#x27;s aria &quot;Se vuol ballare&quot; (later reworked in Vienna). Although these works largely conform to the formal conventions of the classical style, including strict observance of form and, in the variations, the decorative filigree associated with the genre, they also show early signs of Beethoven&#x27;s later tendency to the more substantive treatment of thematic material.

Beethoven also produced numerous fragments of larger-scale works, including a symphonic movement (also written in C minor), a violin concerto, an oboe concerto, an early draft of his B-flat Piano concerto (both now vanished), and a concertante for piano, flute and bassoon. Scholars generally regard these early efforts as bland and uninspired and have concluded that his first efforts at writing in the classical sonata style (with the exception of his Wind Octet) were poorly conceived. Gustav Nottebohm, for example, wrote of Beethoven&#x27;s Dressler Variations (WoO 63), &quot;they show not a trace of contrapuntal independent part-writing. They are figural variations of the simplest kind&quot;. Téodor de Wyzewa considered his early &quot;Kurfürsten Sonatas&quot; written in 1783 (WoO 47) as merely &quot;correct imitations of Haydn.&quot;.

The most ambitious work that Beethoven composed during his Bonn years was a funeral cantata to commemorate the death of Emperor Joseph II, commissioned by the literary society of Bonn. Though it was not performed, it was evidently impressive enough that Beethoven was commissioned to write a second cantata &#x27;On the Accession of Leopold II to the Imperial Dignity&#x27;, which was again not performed. These works already show skill in choral writing, as well as in writing arias, the latter also exhibited by three concert arias he composed around this time.

Considered as a whole, Beethoven&#x27;s compositional efforts in Bonn demonstrate the importance of his move to Vienna in terms of the development of his musical style and the sophistication of his grasp of classical form and idiom, for his efforts in the sonata style are less accomplished than his efforts in other genres like variations, Lieder, and large vocal-orchestral pieces.
=== Early Vienna Period ===

For the first years after moving to Vienna, Beethoven composed considerably less than he did either before or after. Not only was he studying with Haydn and Albrechtsberger, but he was also revising several of his Bonn works to cater to Viennese styles and tastes. However, by 1795-96, Beethoven had started developing a style which not only displayed an increasing mastery of the Viennese style but also contained a dramatic flair which became a quintessential feature of his music. It was the piano that often served as a catapult for Beethoven&#x27;s innovations, in works such as his Op. 1 piano trios and Op. 2 piano sonatas. These works expand the three-movement sonata form found in the sonatas of Mozart and Haydn to four-movements, which is more often associated with orchestral symphonies rather than chamber works or piano sonatas. In particular, the first movement of his first piano sonata displays an intensity in musical construction that foreshadows the motivic development he would later exploit in his 3rd and 5th symphonies, while the Piano Trio in C minor (from the Op. 1 set) had such an intensity of expression that Haydn thought that they would not be understood by the public. In addition, these works also display virtuosity which would become another of Beethoven&#x27;s characteristics, particularly in his piano sonatas and chamber works. Beethoven also incorporated textures typical of chamber music and orchestral and vocal music into his piano works, often employing elaborate figuration and a use of trills, features of his piano music which would be apparent even in his late period.

Beethoven also developed a penchant for the key of C minor which would last for the rest of his life. Most of his full-scale works in minor keys from this period are in the key, including the &#x27;Pathétique&#x27; sonata (the 1st movement of which was novel in its integration of the slow introduction into the overall sonata form), and the key became associated with extreme drama in Beethoven&#x27;s works. Beethoven also seemed to have an interest in all current musical genres, including three piano concertos (the 2nd, in B-flat major, being a revised version of a piano concerto from his Bonn years), some violin and cello sonatas, and the Op.18 string quartets. The latter illustrates Beethoven&#x27;s increasing interest in &#x27;motivic saturation&#x27; (in the first movement of the 1st quartet in F major) and juxtaposition of strikingly different moods (in the Finale of the 6th quartet in B-flat major, subtitled &#x27;La malinconia&#x27;), the latter of which is a precursor to similar explorations in his late period.
Beethoven became increasingly more experimental in his use of form in his piano sonatas of 1800-02. Op. 26 in A-flat major contains a &#x27;marcia funebre&#x27; which foreshadows that of the &#x27;Eroica&#x27; symphony; Op. 27, no. 2 in C-sharp minor &#x27;Quasi una fantasia&#x27; (the famous &#x27;Moonlight&#x27; sonata) has the dramatic sonata form movement come last instead of first, and Op. 31, No. 3 in E-flat major contains both a scherzo and a minuet, sacrificing a slow movement. This formal experimentation furthered his incorporation of differing moods into the sonata style that had already been seen in the finale of Op. 18, No.6; the most striking of which is contained in the first movement of Op. 27, no.2. From this point all of Beethoven&#x27;s pieces display a &quot;striking individuality&quot;, perhaps because of the integration of these Romantic moods within a Classical approach towards form. Emblematic of this approach was Beethoven&#x27;s extension of the tonal range of the Classical sonata into mediant and submediant keys, instead of the dominant key as Mozart and Haydn had done, as seen in the first movement of Op. 31, no. 1 (in this case both B major and B minor, in comparison to the tonic of G major). These mediant and submediant keys acted as a substitute for the dominant key, creating a long-range dissonance against the tonic and creating tension that would be resolved with a move toward the tonic at the central climax of the movement. This expansion of the modulatory possibilities of sonata form would continue into the middle period, though the experiments in form would be sidelined in favour of the &#x27;symphonic ideal&#x27;, instead returning in his late period.

Despite his experiments in the piano sonatas and chamber works, his larger-scale works were more conservative. The First Symphony has been described as &quot;wilt[ing] when... examine[d]... for clues to future symphony greatness.&quot; though it has also been praised for its &quot;extraordinary cohesion&quot; The Second Symphony is more accomplished and bigger in scope; though still conservative in comparison to the piano sonatas composed at the same time; despite this, it has been described as &quot;the longest and most powerful symphony ever written... at the time of its composition.&quot; Its use of a unifying motive (a rise from F# to G) foreshadows the emergence of the &#x27;germ motive&#x27; in the symphonic works of the middle period, while the increased scope of the symphony suggests Beethoven had finally grasped how he could use the orchestra in a way where he could start to incorporate the formal and expressive advances seen in his piano sonatas and chamber works of the time.

==Middle period==

Beethoven&#x27;s middle period is characterised by the increased scope of his compositions, a byproduct of further focus on large public works which often display elements of extra-musical sources. This increased scope &quot;create[s] the impression of a psychological journey or growth process [where] something seems to arrive or triumph or transcend.&quot; A pivotal work of the period is the 3rd Symphony, nicknamed &quot;Eroica&quot;. He achieves this increased scope through his creation of large, extended structures characterised by the extensive development of musical material, themes, and motifs, as well as the development of long-range tonal dissonances that are resolved on the scale of entire movements (or even whole symphonies). The 1st movement of the &quot;Eroica&quot; is an example of this; the introduction of a chromatic C# at the beginning of the movement creates massive tonal instability that not only marks the first movements but the other movements as well. These structures often amount to a &quot;projection of the underlying principles of the sonata style on the scale of the total four-movement work&quot;, instead of only the first movement in sonata form. So extensive were these structures as first employed in the &quot;Eroica&quot; that Beethoven did not write another work of such scale for many years afterwards, and in any case, many of these increasingly large scale works, such as the &quot;Eroica&quot; and the Rasumovsky string quartets met with an initially mixed reception.

In the development section of the &quot;Eroica&#x27;s&quot; first movement&#x27;s sonata form, the 1st theme is transformed into a variant which is often analysed as an entirely different theme. This use of a &#x27;germ motive&#x27; also appears in works like the &quot;Waldstein&quot; sonata and 5th symphony, and is emblematic of his approach to musical architecture during his middle period. The 5th symphony is particularly renowned for the opening theme of its first movement, which takes the &#x27;motivic saturation&#x27; previously seen in the 1st String Quartet&#x27;s opening movement to extreme lengths, appearing in virtually every bar of the movement. The theme is even incorporated into the other movements, albeit modified, often by exploiting the rhythmic ambiguity of the motif. This feature can be seen even in overtly extra-musical works such as the Pastoral symphony, where the birdsongs at the end of the second movement are motivically linked to earlier passages of the movement.

In fact, another feature of Beethoven&#x27;s middle-period is in the incorporation of these extra-musical ideas, whether it be the programmatic material of the &quot;Pastoral&quot; Symphony, or the heroic implications of the &quot;&#x27;Eroica&quot;&#x27; title of the 3rd Symphony. The former is noted for its incorporation of the ostensibly opposing &#x27;pastoral&#x27; and &#x27;symphonic&#x27; styles: the former being &quot;gentle and static&quot;, the latter &quot;energetic and dynamic&quot;. Its five movements also sets it apart from the normal four movement symphonic work; each movement features and musically evokes a title suggestive of a feature of the countryside. Extra-musical ideas of heroism are implict in the &quot;Waldstein&quot; and &quot;Appassionata&quot; sonatas, as well as the Rasumovsky quartets, which explain the emphasis on lengthier, more developmental forms in these solo/chamber works. The sonatas use the key symbolism that characterises Beethoven&#x27;s opera &quot;Fidelio&quot;, the original version of which was composed in 1805, around the same time of these sonatas. The Rasumovsky quartets also show for the first time Beethoven&#x27;s interest in folk song, particularly in the third quartet of the set, where the Andante movement is written in Beethoven&#x27;s conception of a Russian idiom. The &quot;Pastoral&quot; symphony also incorporates many features of folk style suggestive of the countryside, such as drones, and an Alpine horn call.

Much of Beethoven&#x27;s music of this period further incorporates remote modulations to chromatic mediant keys (e.g. in the &quot;Waldstein&quot; sonata), rather than focusing on tonic-dominant relationships prevalent in the works of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven himself up to this point. This not only provides more opportunity for him to develop his motives but also gives his works an added urgency (especially in his sonata form movements). The 4th symphony begins with a slow introduction in the tonic minor, with suggestions of B minor and other keys, only reaching a firm B-flat major in bar 43. Chromatic mediant modulations also find long-range use in the 7th symphony; the keys of C major and F major that are introduced in the slow introduction of the first movement finding regular use in the symphony as a contrast to the tonic key of A major. Other remote key relations are found in the large-scale exploitation of Neopolitian sixths in the Appassionata sonata and in the String Quartet, op. 95, the latter of which foreshadows the style of the late quartets.

In his orchestral music, Beethoven achieves a &quot;sheer variety and extreme range of color, texture, and sound&quot; that, for the most part, are achieved without enlarging the orchestral forces used by Haydn and Mozart. However, in works such as the 3rd, 5th, and 6th symphonies, Beethoven does use larger orchestras. Beethoven moves the centre of the sound downwards in the orchestra, to the violas and the lower register of the violins and cellos, giving his music a heavier and darker feel than that of his two immediate predecessors. This may have been influenced by French post-revolutionary music, such as operas by Cherubini, as can be seen in the &#x27;March Funebre&#x27; in the &quot;Eroica&quot; symphony. He expanded the range of the orchestra adding instruments such as the piccolo and contrabassoon in his 5th symphony, and the separation of the cello and double bass in the 3rd and 5th symphonies, which helped express the &quot;heroic ideals&quot; found in much of the music in this period. Midway through the 4th movement of the &quot;Pastoral&quot; symphony, the introduction of the piccolo and trombones, not previously heard in the work, help to depict the chaos of the raging storm. This particular use of the trombones may have been inspired by a similar &#x27;storm&#x27; passage in Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot;, and the use of the contrabassoon and piccolo in the 5th and 6th symphonies also have precedent in that oratorio as well as Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot;. Beethoven also started expanding the roles of certain instruments. In the &quot;Eroica&quot; symphony, he increases the number of horns to three, providing a rich timbre that is strikingly used in the trio of the 3rd movement. Beethoven also started to expand the role of the timpani in this period, giving the instrument solos in the first and second movements of the 4th symphony, and famously at the beginning of the Violin Concerto. In the finale of the 8th symphony, he tuned the timpani in octaves instead of the typical 4th or 5th, in order to further the coherence of the work as a whole.

== Late period ==

After 1814, Beethoven&#x27;s output dropped considerably due to turmoil in his personal life, creative exhaustion after 10 years of near-constant musical activity, and the challenge of sustaining the Classical style while other composers like Rossini and Weber were moving towards the Romantic style. This resulted in a stylistic change in Beethoven&#x27;s work, but his continued adherence to the Classical forms he loved meant that the influence of these late works only became apparent after the time of his own younger contemporaries. This stylistic change has been described by Charles Rosen as a &quot;contraction or even a distillation of classical procedure rather than an expansion [of it],&quot; and this manifests itself in a &quot;more direct and intimate mode of communication.&quot; Theodor Adorno went further, stating:&quot;Everywhere in his formal language [during his late period] ... one finds formulas and phrases of convention scattered about. The works are full of decoratve trill sequences, cadences, and &quot;fioraturas&quot;. Often convention appears in a form that is bald, undisguised, [and] untransformed.&quot;Beethoven became more concerned with lyricism in this period. Although his melodic skills have been criticised, Beethoven previously utilised immensely lyrical melodies, and during his middle period, developed a hymn-like melodic style in his slow movements. This was intensified in his late period and was combined with a newfound &quot;intimacy and delicacy&quot; which was already apparent in works like the Piano Sonata in A major, Op. 101.

Beethoven also arranged 150 folksongs for the editor George Thomson during this time. Many melodies reminiscent of folksong appear in his late works, especially in his song-cycle &quot;An die ferne Geliebte&quot;, which was a great influence on the next generation of composers. These works largely departed from the Classical style. This incorporation of vocal forms also manifested in the setting of Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &#x27;Ode to Joy&#x27; in the finale of the Ninth Symphony, this time being carrying symbolism of universal brotherhood. Another aspect of this is frequent use of recitative and arioso in instrumental works like the Piano Sonata in A-flat major, Op. 110, and the &#x27;beklemmt&#x27; passage in the Cavatina of the String Quartet in B-flat major, Op. 130.

In addition, Beethoven also had an immense interest in variation form in this period. In his early Vienna period, variation movements in large works are infrequent; while they become more frequent in his middle period generally they are of the progressively more decorative variety. However, starting with the Piano Sonata in E major, Op. 109, Beethoven started redefining the form, resulting in variations which take on more individual and radical reinterpretations of the original themes. The variations did not merely vary the theme, they transformed it or played with its fundamentals, as seen in some variations in the Diabelli Variations. Paradoxically, this emphasis on the fundamentals on a theme resulted in both a progressive simplification of Beethoven&#x27;s conception of the theme as the variations go on, even if the textures become increasingly complex. These suggest Beethoven&#x27;s changing view of musical unity, from a dialogue between contrasting elements to a gradual evolution from within. 

Beethoven also developed a great interest in contrapuntal forms in this period, including fugal sections or even full-scale fugues in most of his major works. The fugal sections are often embedded in the development sections of sonata form movements, as in the 1st movement of the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; sonata, or become full movements unto themselves, as in the 4th movement of the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; or the &quot;Grosse Fuge&quot;. These full-scale fugues are often a series of variations on the fugue theme itself. In effect, Beethoven integrates the fugue within the sonata style by emphasising its potential for thematic development, while also using it as a means to infuse drama into these works. Often these replace obvious uses of the dominant in this function, a process also reinforced by his increased use of 6/4 chords and experimentation with the church modes.

Beethoven also looked increasingly to the past in this period. Much of his older material was published or reworked into new works, as happened in the Bagatelles, Op. 119. He increased use of strict counterpoint and modes, often looking back to the academic exercises he did with Albrechtsberger, and he became interested in the music of Palestrina, Bach, and Handel. Even the 9th symphony represented a resumption of the &#x27;symphonic ideal&#x27; that had lay dormant in his music for a decade by the time he wrote the work in the early 1820s, and the choral finale shows the influence of revolutionary French cantatas. Even the last work he completed, the Op. 135 String Quartet, has been said to be an exercise in &quot;Classical nostalgia.&quot; Charles Rosen argued that, in his late period, Beethoven found new ways of exploiting old conventions in the classical style to produce thematic unity in works like the Piano Sonata in A-flat major, Op. 110. Beethoven also sought to integrate variations, fugue, and lyricism into the sonata style he had cultivated through his career. Perhaps the most important indication of his adherence to the Classical aesthetic is the musical unity he constantly strives for, even while moving away from the conventional sonata style (most of his late string quartets have more than 4 movements, sometimes as many as 7).

During his late period, Beethoven expanded his use of the &#x27;germ motive&#x27; beyond all previous conception. For example, the entire Hammerklavier sonata is based on the idea of a descending 3rd, as well as the conflict between the tonic B-flat and B natural. The entire development section of the 1st movement, as well as the Scherzo theme of the 2nd movement, use persuasive descending 3rds, and the 3rd movement begins in F-sharp minor, a 3rd away from the tonic key of the whole sonata. To some extent, this is an extension of Beethoven&#x27;s substitution of dominant for the mediant/submediant that was already present in his early and middle periods, but the degree to which the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; sonata depends on the idea is new. Similarly, the &#x27;Ode to Joy&#x27; theme of the finale of the 9th symphony is foreshadowed in the first three movements, and the long instrumental introduction of the finale is also paralleled in the first three movements.

== Criticism ==
Many of Beethoven&#x27;s late works were not initially well received: Beethoven&#x27;s student Carl Czerny, for instance, wrote in 1852 about ‘when Beethoven’s deafness began to have a disturbing effect on his compositions’, which supposedly affected many of the late works. The Ninth Symphony attracted particular criticism: Richard Taruskin observed that the only musicians who defended Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony were those for whom this work fit into their broader artistic project, chief among whom was Richard Wagner. Other composers, most notably Mendelssohn, Spohr, Brahms, and Schumann, were highly critical, particularly of the inclusion of the choir in the finale of the Ninth.

In his book &quot;The Joy of Music&quot;, Leonard Bernstein, who, in his television documentary &quot;Bernstein on Beethoven&quot; admitted that he considered Beethoven the greatest composer who ever lived, nevertheless criticized his orchestration as sometimes being &quot;downright bad&quot;, with &quot;unimportant&quot; orchestral parts being given too much prominence. Bernstein attributed this to Beethoven&#x27;s ever-increasing deafness, which presumably rendered him incapable of judging how much louder than another a given instrument might be playing at certain moments. He repeated some of this criticism in the 1982 miniseries &quot;Bernstein/Beethoven&quot;, a PBS miniseries containing performances of all nine symphonies, several overtures, one of the string quartets, and the &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;. But at the same time, Bernstein added that what makes Beethoven great is his perfect sense of form – his ability to realize what the next note always had to be.

<doc id="1052596" wikidata="Q6239743" url="?curid=1052596" title="John Hood (university administrator)">
<text>Sir John Antony Hood (born 2 January 1952) is a New Zealand businessman and administrator. He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 5 October 2004 until 30 September 2009. He was the first Vice-Chancellor to be elected from outside Oxford&#x27;s academic body in 900 years, and the first to have addressed the scholars&#x27; congregation via a webcast. In March 2007 New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark awarded him the World Class New Zealand supreme award to honour his contribution to profiling New Zealand and New Zealanders internationally. On 15 November 2007 he announced that he would not seek an extension to his five-year term as Vice Chancellor, and that he would leave Oxford in September 2009.

==Early life and education==
Born on 2 January 1952 in Napier, New Zealand, Hood attended Westlake Boys High School in Auckland, where a house has been named after him (Hood House).

From 1970 to 1976, Hood attended the University of Auckland, where he graduated with a B.E. in 1972 and a PhD in Civil Engineering in 1976. His doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;A theoretical and experimental investigation of a curved, single cell box-girder bridge&quot;. He was then awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, where he resided in Worcester College and studied for an M.Phil. in Management. He won a Blue playing squash for Oxford University and also played first-class cricket for Oxford University in 1977.

==Career==
===Career in New Zealand===
He has held a number of directorships in prominent New Zealand companies and bodies, including Fonterra, Fletcher Challenge and the New Zealand Cricket review of 1995. His career at Fletcher Challenge is described in the book &quot;Battle of the Titans&quot; by Bruce Wallace. From 1999 to 2004, he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Auckland.

===Vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford===
Hood&#x27;s term as vice-chancellor of Oxford has been the subject of controversy. Hood had proposed to reform the 900-year-old tradition of complete self-governance by introducing a number of external members to council, and by separating academic and financial boards. The initial proposal called for a majority of external members of council, bringing Oxford into line with all other UK universities except the University of Cambridge. Following a two-hour debate, the proposal was amended by Congregation to allow the election of a college fellow, a further insider, to the council within five years, resulting in a majority of eight insiders (including the vice-chancellor) on the 15-member council. The amendment was supported by a majority of votes (657 to 502), with both supporters and opponents of the reforms claiming victory.

The amended proposal was brought to vote by Congregation on 28 November 2006, and was defeated by 730 to 456 votes. A postal vote was called on 5 December, with ballots being sent to all 3000 members of Congregation and votes being accepted until 18 December. On 19 December it was announced that the proposal had once again been defeated, this time by 1540 to 997 votes. Hood stated that he would not treat the defeat as a vote of no confidence, citing a need to &quot;put aside division, continue dialogue with all shades of opinion and, in an atmosphere of trust, tolerance and goodwill, promote the academic aims and ideals of Oxford&quot;.

The proposed reform met with opposition not because it would invite outside opinion on the university&#x27;s financial and academic decisions, but because of the impression that control would be wrested from Congregation, thus threatening the university&#x27;s academic reputation. Furthermore, some opponents claimed that the reform would place too much power in the hands of the vice-chancellor. Other critics questioned the applicability of corporate models of governance in educational institutions. Lord Patten of Barnes stated in December 2006 that without reforms to Oxford&#x27;s governance it would be more difficult to raise money he said was needed by the university, particularly with respect to needs-based funding to support students from poorer backgrounds. Similarly, Hood stated at the same time that the issue was not &quot;whether there has to be change, but what kind of change.&quot;

Others criticised the appointment of the Registrar, Julie Maxton, who was noted to be a former colleague of Hood. Maxton was chosen for the position of Registrar by way of a selection committee including consultants, external members of council, and the vice-chancellor of Cambridge.

Comparisons were drawn with Lawrence Summers, the 27th President of Harvard University, who announced his resignation on 21 February 2006 following two motions of censure. Although individual academic staff were critical of Hood, no formal motions were brought forward calling for his resignation. However, an informal letter of confidence organised by his supporters in February 2006 attracted only about fifty signatories from Members of Congregation. Contested elections to the Council of the university by Congregation resulted in the election of three leading critics of Hood&#x27;s proposals, namely Susan Cooper in 2005, Nicholas Bamforth in 2006, and Donald Fraser, who was elected unopposed, also in 2006.

In June 2007 it was revealed that the university press office had been monitoring and editing comments in Hood&#x27;s Wikipedia article in an attempt to protect his reputation. In the same month, two further critics of Hood, Colin Thompson and Peter Robbins, were elected to the council.

Andrew Hamilton, who had previously served as the Provost of Yale University, was nominated on 3 June 2008 to succeed John Hood as Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University from 1 October 2009.
 His appointment was confirmed on 16 June 2008.

===Later career===
He is a non-executive director of BG Group Plc, and will be President and Chief Executive Officer of the Robertson Foundation from 2010.

In December 2011, John Hood became Chair of Rhodes Trustees.

In January 2012, the board of global private education provider Study Group appointed John Hood as chairman.

In the 2014 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Hood was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (KNZM) for services to tertiary education.

==Personal life==
Hood has three children. His wife, Emma, Lady Hood, was a contemporary of Theresa May at St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford.

<text>Duberdicus or Duberdico, is a lusitanian theonym, in the cultural area of Lusitania (in the territory of modern Portugal). It has historically been assumed that this was a water god, but Alarcão 2009 disagrees with this assertion (as well as several other alleged cases of water deities in the Lusitanian sphere) and assumes that it is a theonym associated with a specific fortress.

<text>Nabia (or Navia) was a goddess of the Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula, although she also had an extended cult during the Roman occupation of the peninsula.

Nabia was worshipped in many places on the Iberian Peninsula, sometimes in very different ways, leading some historians to suggest that &quot;Nabia&quot; was just a common word used by different peoples to refer to their deities (a theory questioned by others). Due to the uncertainty of her nature, she is sometimes interpreted as a water deity, other times she is associated with valleys, forests and hills, and she&#x27;s further seen as the goddess of fertility, health, and abundance.

<text>Fraternitas Saturni (lat.: &quot;Brotherhood of Saturn&quot;) is a German magical order, founded in 1926 by Eugen Grosche a.k.a. Gregor A. Gregorius and four others. It is one of the oldest continuously running magical groups in Germany. The lodge is, as Gregorius states, &quot;concerned with the study of esotericism, mysticism, and magic in the cosmic sense&quot;. The FS adopts a system of degrees, ending with the 33rd as highest degree to reach this goal. The lodge claims further no political or economical objectives. It propagates ideals of freedom, tolerance and fraternity.

== History ==

=== Origins: Pansophia Lodge and the Weida Conference ===
The &quot;Fraternitas Saturni&quot; was founded in the wake of the so-called &quot;Weida Conference&quot; in 1925. It succeeded the &quot;Collegium Pansophicum, Orient Berlin&quot; (Pansophia Lodge), a Rosicrucian magical order founded by , a notable German occultist of the time. The Weida Conference was meant to consolidate Aleister Crowley&#x27;s claims to be the Outer Head of Ordo Templi Orientis and the expected World Teacher. The conference consisted of Crowley&#x27;s entourage of Leah Hirsig, Dorothy Olsen, and Norman Mudd and the members of Heinrich Traenker&#x27;s &quot;Pansophia Lodge&quot;. Traenker had served as a X° National Grand Master of the German O.T.O. under Theodor Reuss up until Reuss&#x27;s death. Also attending the conference were the notable film pioneer Albin Grau and Gregor A. Gregorius.

The conference was not a smooth event and Traenker withdrew his support of Crowley. The differences between Traenker and Crowley led to a schism in the Pansophical Lodge between the brothers who disagreed with Crowley and those who accepted Crowley&#x27;s Law of Thelema, including Gregorius and Grau. Following these differences the Pansophical Lodge would be officially closed in 1926. Those brothers of the Pansophia Lodge who accepted the teachings of Crowley would join Grosche in founding the &quot;Fraternitas Saturni&quot; - but without Albin Grau.

=== Founding ===
At Easter 1928, the &quot;Fraternitas Saturni&quot; was officially founded in Berlin. The Lodge made a formal acceptance of &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; but they would not answer to Crowley. The FS still thought of him as an important teacher and included the Law of Thelema in most of its teachings, while divorcing itself from direct contact with him. This resulted in the FS developing a different take on the idea of Thelema, which is reflected in the rituals and magical techniques of the brotherhood. The emphasis of the FS lies more on astrological and Luciferian teachings, rather than on Qabalah and Tarot compared to other western magical orders founded in the early 20th century. Because of its unique approach to modern occultism, the FS is considered by many modern authors to be the most influential German magical order.

In 1936, the &quot;Fraternitas Saturni&quot; was prohibited by the Nazi regime. Gregorius as well as other leaders of the lodge emigrated in order to avoid imprisonment, but in the course of the war Grosche was arrested for a year by the Nazi government.

=== After World War II ===
The end of World War II saw the reactivation of &quot;Fraternitas Saturni&quot;. First from Riesa in Eastern Germany and later from Berlin, Gregorius tried to contact the Brothers and found lodges in several German cities. By 1957 lodges existed in Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Stuttgart, with the Grand Lodge in Berlin. In 1960 the FS had, according to its membership list, about 100 members, but in 1962 internal problems led to the expulsion of several members. Following Grosche&#x27;s death in 1964, the lodge experienced confusion concerning the position of Grandmaster. This resulted in a schism between the Frankfurt lodge and the main body of the Order.
In 1969 the two separate groups of the Fraternitas Saturni were reunified, ending the former conflicts.

==Structure==

===Development===
Originally, there existed eight degrees within the &quot;Fraternitas Saturni&quot;, not including the &quot;Novice&quot;, who was not a regular member but a candidate to the Order, and the Grandmaster, which was not a degree in those days but a position held by a single master of the highest degree, guiding the affairs of the lodge. A new member of the &quot;Pronaos&quot; held the degree of &quot;Neophyt&quot; (Apprentice), the second degree was called &quot;Gradus Mercurii&quot; (Journeyman), followed by the &quot;Gradus Solis&quot; (Master). The first degree in the second order of &quot;R + C&quot; was called the &quot;Gradus Pentalphae&quot;, followed by the &quot;Gradus Sigilli Salomonis&quot; and the &quot;Magus Heptagrammatos&quot;. The third order called the &quot;S. S. G.&quot;, was formed by the degrees of &quot;Templarius&quot;, &quot;Gnosticus&quot; and &quot;Magister Aquarius&quot;.

The system of degrees was changed in 1960. After the reformation of the degree system and its expansion to 33 degrees, the &quot;Gradus Mercurii&quot; became 8°, &quot;Gradus Solis&quot; became 12° and the &quot;Gradus Pentalphae&quot; became 18°. The other Grades were repositioned as well. The &quot;Templarius&quot; were renamed &quot;Princeps Arcani&quot; (24°) and a new degree of &quot;Magister Templarius&quot; (31°) were installed.

====Outline of degree system====
=== Contents ===
In the 1950s, the first two degrees of the &quot;Fraternitas Saturni&quot; were of theoretical character. The first degree to be attained by work was the &quot;Gradus Mercurii&quot; (8°). The conditions centered on basic understanding of esoteric principles and a written essay. The second degree to be attained by work was the &quot;Gradus Solis&quot; (12°), which required a deeper understanding of lodge ritual and two essays. This degree qualified the Initiate to lead a lodge of the FS. Today these degrees require theoretical understanding as well as practical work in the field of occultism.

Another important degree was the &quot;Frater&quot; (4°), which contained an oath of lifelong commitment. This was later changed and the vow was made part of the attainment of the &quot;Gradus Solis&quot;. After 1960, the &quot;Gradus Solis&quot; marked the member as a part of the inner order, the so-called &quot;Grand-Lodge Fraternitas Saturni&quot;.

Much speculation has been made around the content of the &quot;Gradus Pentalphae&quot; (18°), the degree of the pentagram or the five pointed star. As far as it is known, the work of the &quot;Gradus Pentalphae&quot; was centered on tantric mysticism and sex magic. As many faked documents have been published it is hard to verify the rumors about the contents of this degree.

The Initials of the degree of &quot;Gradus Ordinis Templi Orientis Saturni&quot; (33°) are similar to the name of the egregore of the lodge - GOTOS.

==Current lodges==

=== Fraternitas Saturni ===
The &quot;Fraternitas Saturni&quot; became a legal organisation, registered as &quot;Fraternitas Saturni, e.v.&quot; in 1957. The &quot;Fraternitas Saturni&quot; is, beside incorporating new attempts on magic, still working on its traditional roots and enhancing the concept of &quot;Saturn-Magic&quot; as the center of its work. On its 75th anniversary (2003), the lodge incorporated another order of the so-called &quot;Immanuel-succession&quot;, the &quot;Grand-Lodge Gregor A. Gregorius&quot;. This unification effectively doubled the size of its membership. The &quot;Fraternitas Saturni&quot; claims to have working lodges in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

<text>WCSH (channel 6) is a television station in Portland, Maine, United States, affiliated with NBC and owned by Tegna Inc. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Congress Square in Downtown Portland, and its transmitter is located on Winn Mountain in Sebago. Together with WLBZ (channel 2) in Bangor, which simulcasts most of WCSH&#x27;s local newscasts, it is known as News Center Maine.

WCSH is the oldest operating television station in Portland, signing on in December 1953. It was an outgrowth of WCSH radio, one of NBC&#x27;s charter affiliates when it was constituted as a radio network in 1926, and broadcast from its namesake, the Congress Square Hotel in downtown Portland, for nearly 25 years. Founded by the Rines family and sold to Tegna predecessor Gannett Company in 1997, it has generally been the highest-rated station in TV news in the market since the mid-1980s.

==History==
===Establishment===
When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lifted its four-year freeze on television station applications in April 1952, four bids had already been received to start new stations in Portland, which was allocated two commercial very high frequency (VHF) channels and a third on the new ultra high frequency (UHF) band. One of these came from the Congress Square Hotel Company, owner of Portland radio station WCSH (970 AM), which had filed for channel 11 in 1948 but amended its application when only VHF channels 6 and 13 were assigned. In October 1952, the FCC ordered comparative hearings to decide who should be given construction permits for channels 6 and 13. Two groups sought each channel; Congress Square&#x27;s application was rivaled by one from the Oliver Broadcasting Company, which owned station WPOR.

The third VHF channel in southern Maine was channel 8 at Poland Spring, and activity around this channel would proceed to unblock channel 6 in Portland. The FCC granted a permit in early July 1953 to Mount Washington Television, a group headed by former Maine governor Horace A. Hildreth containing principals from Oliver as shareholders. Oliver withdrew its channel 6 application on July 30, 1953, and the FCC immediately awarded the Congress Square Hotel Company a permit for channel 6, WCSH-TV. This was the second construction permit for a Portland TV station, with WPMT (channel 53) already being built.

Because WCSH had conditionally purchased television equipment 18 months prior, it was assured delivery of its order to put channel 6 on the air by the end of 1953. WCSH-TV announced its intention to be Portland&#x27;s NBC affiliate, matching WCSH radio—which had carried NBC&#x27;s very first program when the radio network began in November 1926 and previously had been part of the WEAF chain that preceded it. The transmitting facility would be erected in Falmouth, while WCSH&#x27;s quarters in the Congress Square Hotel were extensively refitted to house the television station: a large radio studio was converted for television use, and a new studio was created out of a former storage room to house a kitchen for cooking shows.

The first test pattern was sent out on November 29, and on December 20, 1953, WCSH-TV began broadcasting. The station&#x27;s broadcasting activity steadily increased in its early years, with such local shows as the home decorating program &quot;Your Home and You&quot;; &quot;Youth Cavalcade&quot;; the noontime women&#x27;s program &quot;Living Down East&quot;; &quot;The Dave Astor Show&quot;, a teen dance program; and early and late evening newscasts. By January 1955, it was broadcasting 18 hours a day and had become a secondary affiliate of the DuMont Television Network in its final years of operation after WPMT closed the month before. The Rines family, who had founded WCSH radio and television, also owned the Maine Broadcasting System with radio stations WRDO in Augusta and WLBZ in Bangor. It expanded its TV holdings north in 1958 when it bought WTWO, an independent station in Bangor owned by Murray Carpenter, and made it into an NBC affiliate as WLBZ-TV.
After 50 years of radio and television operations in the Congress Square Hotel, WCSH opted to move its broadcasting businesses into more modern quarters. The studio portion of the hotel complex had become overcrowded despite multiple additions. In 1977, WCSH moved one city block to occupy a four-story building at 1 Congress Square, which received a two-story addition containing studio space; WCSH radio moved to separate facilities in Scarborough. The Maine Broadcasting System continued to own the radio station until 1981, when it was sold and changed call letters; WLBZ radio in Bangor was also sold, while the television properties were retained. Particularly beginning in the 1980s, WCSH made its mark as the dominant station in Portland-market ratings, even if it sometimes irked NBC. The station was heavily protective of its 6 p.m. newscast, resulting in far more frequent preemptions of network sports events. In 1994, WCSH did not air 38 percent of NBC&#x27;s 502 hours of sports programming that year—the most of any of NBC&#x27;s 213 affiliates and more than double the preemption rate of WSMV-TV in Nashville, Tennessee—which the network begrudgingly tolerated because the station delivered strong performance for the network&#x27;s daytime and prime time entertainment shows. Events as diverse as the second games of NBA doubleheaders and golf tournaments were not aired to provide a consistent airing of the 6 p.m. &quot;NewsCenter&quot; and to air movies which drew more viewers.

===Gannett/Tegna ownership===

The Rines-Thompson family exited the local broadcasting industry after 72 years (44 of them owning WCSH) by selling WCSH and WLBZ to the Gannett Company in 1997. It had negotiated exclusively with Gannett for several months after approaching several potential acquirers. The family had decided to sell because of deregulation in broadcasting and costly new technological mandates, such as the forthcoming conversion to digital television. The family earned a handsome return on its original investment in WCSH radio in 1925. The transaction also marked the entry of large station groups into Maine. For most of the broadcasting era, Maine had been traditionally dominated by locally based owners, including families.

WCSH&#x27;s digital signal on UHF channel 44 signed on in April 2002, bringing high definition network television to the area. WCSH&#x27;s broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009; the station elected to continue broadcasting on channel 44 (using virtual channel 6), which it did until being repacked to channel 31 in 2020. As part of the SAFER Act, WCSH kept its analog signal on the air until June 27 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WCSH and WLBZ were retained by the latter company, named Tegna. The two stations adopted the brand News Center Maine in 2018 upon the rollout of a combined website for Portland and Bangor news coverage.

==Local programming==
===News operation===

Newscasts were part of WCSH&#x27;s schedule from its first television broadcasts in 1953, and the station was airing early evening and late evening newscasts by 1955. While the station typically trailed WGAN-TV/WGME in the news ratings for most of its history, this changed in February 1986 when WCSH surpassed WGME at 11 p.m. and tied channel 13 in the vital 6 p.m. news slot. Later that year, the station would surpass WGME at 6 and proceed to do so for at least the next 16 years. This was aided by stability in its evening news team and NBC&#x27;s strong national program lineup in the 1990s. On-air talent like anchors Pat Callaghan and Cindy Williams and meteorologist Joe Cupo were mainstays on channel 6 for years. Cupo left in 2016 after 37 years when Tegna offered voluntary retirement packages, while Williams retired in 2021 and Callaghan in 2022 after tenures of 32 and 43 years, respectively.

From the 1980s onward, WLBZ&#x27;s local operations were progressively cut back, a trend that accelerated after Gannett took over. While WLBZ had already simulcast WCSH&#x27;s morning and weekend newscasts since 1989, regional 5:30 and 11 p.m. newscasts were instituted in 2000 with split weather forecasts for each area, with WLBZ only airing separate 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts. WLBZ ceased producing separate local newscasts altogether on October 8, 2015; all newscasts on both stations now originate from Portland, though Bangor viewers continue to see separate weather forecasts. The presence of WLBZ in the News Center Maine operation has resulted in a newscast with a stronger statewide news focus than its competitors in the Portland market.

After The WB affiliate WPXT shut down its news department in fall 2002, WCSH and WLBZ entered into a news share agreement with that station, resulting in a nightly prime time newscast. The half-hour &quot;News Center at 10&quot; moved to a digital subchannel of WCSH in 2008 when WPXT opted out of the arrangement, citing a lack of advertising support. In the early 2010s, WCSH tried its hand again at airing news for WPXT, with the addition of a 7 a.m. hour of WCSH&#x27;s morning newscast branded as &quot;News Center Morning Report Xtra&quot;.

===Non-news programming===
From 2000 until the host&#x27;s retirement in 2019, the News Center Maine stations aired human interest and outdoors program &quot;Bill Green&#x27;s Maine&quot;; Green had gotten his start at WLBZ before moving to Portland and WCSH in 1981. Reruns now air weekdays at 12:30PM, replacing Tegna&#x27;s now-canceled in-house talk show Daily Blast Live.

WCSH debuted &quot;207&quot;, a weeknight lifestyle and entertainment magazine aired weeknights at 7 pm, in 2003. It was named for the state&#x27;s area code, 207.

<text>Sémillon () is a golden-skinned grape used to make dry and sweet white wines, mostly in France and Australia. Its thin skin and susceptibility to botrytis make it dominate the sweet wine region Sauternes AOC and Barsac AOC.

==History==

The Sémillon grape is native to the Bordeaux region. It was known as Sémillon de Saint-Émilion in 1736, while Sémillon also resembles the local pronunciation of the town&#x27;s name ([semi&#x27;ʎuŋ]). It first arrived in Australia in the early 19th century and by the 1820s the grape covered over 90% of South Africa&#x27;s vineyards, where it was known as &quot;Wyndruif&quot;, meaning &quot;wine grape&quot;. It was once considered to be the most planted grape in the world, although this is no longer the case. In the 1950s, Chile&#x27;s vineyards were made up of over 75% Sémillon. Today, it accounts for just 1% of South African Cape vines.

==Viticulture==
Sémillon, which is relatively easy to cultivate, consistently produces six to eight tons of grapes per acre from its vigorous vines. It is fairly resistant to disease, except for rot. The grape ripens early, when, in warmer climates, it acquires a pinkish hue. Since the grape has a thin skin, there is also a risk of sunburn in hotter climates; it is best suited to areas with sunny days and cool nights.

Sémillon wines are rather heavy, with low acidity and an almost oily texture. It has a high yield and wines based on it can age a long time. Along with Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle, Sémillon is one of only three approved white wine varieties in the Bordeaux region.

The grape is also key to the production of sweet wines such as Sauternes. For the grapes to be used for sweet wine production, they need to have been affected by Botrytis (also known as &quot;noble rot&quot;). This fungus dries out the grapes, thus concentrating the sugar and flavours in the grape berry.

==Regional production==

Sémillon is an important cultivar in two significant wine producing countries. In France, Sémillon is the preeminent white grape in the Bordeaux wine regions. The grape has also found a home in Australia; whereas today the country&#x27;s major white varieties are Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc, early in the country&#x27;s viticultural development it was Sémillon, at that time mislabeled as Riesling, that was the most significant white variety.

===France===
In France, the Sémillon grape is grown mostly in Bordeaux where it is blended with Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle. When dry, it is referred to as &quot;Bordeaux blanc&quot; and is permitted to be made in the appellations of Pessac-Léognan, Graves, Entre-Deux-Mers and other less-renowned regions. In this form, Sémillon is generally a minor constituent in the blend. However, when used to make the sweet white wines of Bordeaux (such as those from Sauternes, Barsac and Cérons) it is often the dominant variety. In such wines the vine is exposed to the &quot;noble rot&quot; of &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; which consumes the water content of the fruit, concentrating the sugar present in its pulp. When attacked by Botrytis cinerea, the grapes shrivel and the acid and sugar levels are intensified.

Due to the declining popularity of the grape variety, fewer clones are cultivated in nurseries causing producers to project a future shortage of quality wine. In 2008, 17 Bordeaux wine producers, including Château d&#x27;Yquem, Château Olivier, Château Suduiraut and Château La Tour Blanche, formed an association to grow their own clones.

===Australia===
Sémillon is widely grown in Australia, particularly in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney, where for a long time it was known as &quot;Hunter River Riesling&quot;. Four styles of Sémillon-based wines are made there: 
* a commercial style, often blended with Chardonnay or Sauvignon blanc; 
* a sweet style, after that of Sauternes; 
* a complex, minerally, early picked style which has great longevity; 
* and an equally high quality dry style, which can be released soon after vintage as a vat- or bottle-aged example. 
The latter two styles were pioneered by Lindemans, Tulloch, McWilliam&#x27;s Elizabeth, Drayton&#x27;s and Tyrrell&#x27;s, and are considered unique to Australia.

Most examples of these bottle-aged Hunter Semillons exhibit a buttercup-yellow colour, burnt toast or honey characteristics on the nose and excellent complex flavours on the palate, with a long finish and soft acid. Young Hunter Valley semillon is almost always a dry wine, usually exhibiting citrus flavours of lemon, lime or green apple. Cooler-year Hunter Semillons seem to be the most highly sought after, with some of the 1974 and 1977 vintages still drinking well. The newer, fruit-accentuated styles are championed by the likes of Iain Riggs at Brokenwood Wines and The Rothbury Estate.

Sémillon is also finding favour with Australian producers outside the Hunter Valley in the Barossa Valley and Margaret River regions. The Adelaide Hills is becoming a flourishing region for Semillon, with the cooler climate producing some wines of great complexity. Vineyards such as Amadio and Paracombe produce some premium blends of the classical style.

===South Africa===
Semillon is one of the Cape&#x27;s true heritage white varietals, with origins as early as the 17th century (when it became known as Groendruif which translates as Green grape), the grape variety accounted for more than 90% of plantings in the first half of the 19th century. While South African Semillon has not quite taken off as a serious commercial category in single varietal form in the modern era, there are stunning wines being made from especially older vineyards (some of them centurions). More often, the variety plays a role in beefing up the volume of Sauvignon blancs.

The best South African Semillons have juicy fruit with often an ethereal-like citrus perfume, fine texture, herbal interest and manage to marry the intensity of flavour with finesse.

A red mutation of Semillon is today rarely found, although it was once quite common in South Africa. Semillon Rouge is also a synonym for Merlot.

===Other regions===
Outside of these regions, however, Sémillon is unpopular and often criticised for lack of complexity and intensity. As such, plantings have decreased over the last century. As referenced above, the grape can still be found in South Africa and Chile. The latter is reputed to have the largest plantings of this grape, although the number of acres planted with Sémillon fluctuates often. California growers plant Sémillon primarily to blend it with Sauvignon blanc. There are some wineries in the Washington State that have produced Sémillon as a varietal wine since the early 1980s; others actively produce Sémillon for Ice Wine and Late Harvest wines. At least one winery in Idaho grows and produces a varietal offering and at least four vineyards in Texas are growing Sémillon. The grape is also planted in Argentina, Canada (Niagara and British Columbia) and recently in New Zealand.

<doc id="1052626" wikidata="Q2307507" url="?curid=1052626" title="Typhoon Paka">
<text>Typhoon Paka, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Rubing, was an extremely powerful and long-lived storm that devastated Guam and the Marshall Islands in December 1997. One of the strongest Pacific typhoons ever recorded in the month of December, Paka was the last tropical cyclone of the 1997 Pacific hurricane and typhoon seasons and the last of a record eleven super typhoons that formed in 1997. Paka, which is the Hawaiian name for Pat, developed on 28 November from a trough well to the southwest of Hawaii. The storm tracked generally westward for much of its duration, and on 7 December it crossed into the western Pacific Ocean. Much of its track was characterized by fluctuations in intensity, and on 10 December the cyclone attained typhoon status as it crossed the Marshall Islands. On 16 December, Paka struck Guam and Rota with winds of , and it strengthened further to reach peak winds on 18 December over open waters as the final super typhoon of the year. Subsequently, it underwent a steady weakening trend, and on 23 December Paka dissipated.

Typhoon Paka first impacted the Marshall Islands, where it dropped heavy rainfall and left in damages. Later, it passed just north of Guam, where strong winds destroyed about 1,500 buildings and damaged 10,000 more; 5,000 people were left homeless, and the island experienced a complete power outage following the typhoon. Damage on the island totaled , which warranted the retirement of its name. Paka also caused minor damage in the Northern Mariana Islands, and overall, the typhoon did not cause any reported fatalities.

==Meteorological history==

As the weather synoptics of the northern Pacific Ocean transitioned into a late-fall to early winter-type pattern, convection from the monsoon trough extended to the east of the International Date Line. During late November, a westerly disturbance developed into twin troughs on opposite sides of the equator; the one in the Southern Hemisphere eventually developed into Tropical Cyclone Pam, while the one in the Northern Hemisphere formed into an area of convection about southwest of Hawaii. The disturbance gradually organized as it drifted north-northeastward, and on 28 November it developed into Tropical Depression Five-C about west-northwest of Palmyra Atoll. Operationally, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) did not begin issuing warnings on the system until 2 December.

The tropical depression continued drifting north-northeastward, and failed to strengthen significantly. It turned to the west on 1 December, due to the presence of a strong anticyclone to its north with a ridge extending westward past the International Date Line. On 2 December, based on satellite estimates, the CPHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Paka while located about south-southeast of Johnston Atoll. Due to the presence of high clouds across the area, forecasters had difficulty at times in locating the low-level circulation. After becoming a tropical storm, Paka remained nearly stationary for about two days before resuming a slow motion to the west-southwest. It steadily intensified due to warm water temperatures, and on 3 December the storm attained winds of . The next day, however, it encountered dry air and began weakening; by 6 December, the winds had decreased to minimal tropical storm status for about 12 hours. Subsequently, Paka began to re-intensify, and on 7 December the storm crossed the International Date Line into the western North Pacific Ocean with winds of .

Upon entering the western North Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclone warning duties transferred from the CPHC to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), and the JMA first assessed Paka as a storm. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially assumed warning duties for interests in the United States Department of Defense. Paka continued to intensify after crossing the date line, and from late on 7 December through early the following day it remained a strong tropical storm. However, upper-level wind shear increased, and it again weakened. At 1200 UTC on 9 December, the JTWC assessed Paka as an tropical storm and forecast it to continue weakening. By 10 December, the shear had begun to decrease as the storm moved through the Marshall Islands, and that night the JTWC upgraded Paka to typhoon status. Paka officially attained typhoon status when JMA classified it with winds of at 0000 UTC on 11 December.

After attaining typhoon status, Paka strengthened fairly quickly, and by 12 December it reached sustained winds of for a ten-minute (10 min) duration, or over a one-minute (1 min) duration. Subsequently, it briefly weakened as its forward motion increased. However, Paka again re-intensified, and at 1200 UTC on 14 December it attained the unofficial ranking of Category 5 super typhoon status while over the open Pacific Ocean with estimated 1-minute sustained winds of . At the same time, the JMA classified it with 10 min sustained winds of . After reaching its initial peak intensity, Paka underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and began weakening as it approached the southern Mariana Islands; the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar from Guam revealed the presence of a primary eyewall of in diameter, with a fragmented inner wall cloud of in diameter. Additionally, satellite imagery indicated an eyewall mesovortex within the eye of the typhoon. It slowed and began to re-intensify as it continued westward, and at 0530 UTC on 16 December the northern portion of the outer eyewall of Paka passed over the island of Rota; 20 minutes later, the southern portion of the inner wall cloud moved across northern Guam. As it tracked through the Rota Channel, the center of Paka passed about north of the northern tip of Guam, its closest approach to the island.

Typhoon Paka continued to steadily intensify after passing the Marianas Islands, and late on 17 December it reached its peak intensity of ) while located west-northwest of Guam. Early on 18 December, the JTWC assessed it as attaining peak winds of ). On 19 December, it entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, or PAGASA, and was named Rubing. Shortly thereafter, Paka moved through an area of progressively increasing wind shear, which resulted in a steady weakening trend. By 21 December, winds decreased to tropical storm status. The next day, it degenerated into a tropical depression before it dissipated on 23 December.

==Preparations and impact==

===Marshall Islands===
Prior to the typhoon passing through the Marshall Islands, several hundred residents on the island of Ebeye fled to safer structures. The threat of Paka prevented Continental Micronesia from flying in or out of the area.

Paka entered the Marshall Islands between Mili and Majuro as a tropical storm on 10 December, and after strengthening into a typhoon, it left the archipelago on 14 December. The cyclone affected several islands in the nation, and the Majuro and Kwajalein atolls reported wind gusts in excess of . On Jaluit Atoll, the typhoon dropped of precipitation in six hours, with a total of about recorded in 30 hours. Strong waves inundated low-lying islands, which flooded crops with salt water. The combination of the wind and flooding caused severe damage to banana, papaya, and lime trees across the territory. Typhoon Paka damaged 70% of the houses on Ailinglaplap Atoll, and most of the coconut trees on the atoll were left toppled or damaged. Strong winds left large portions of Ebeye island without electricity or telephone. The typhoon caused no reported deaths or injuries in the region, and damage was estimated at .

===Guam===

The Guam National Weather Service issued a typhoon watch on 14 December, which was upgraded to a typhoon warning the next day. The Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport was closed during the passage of Paka, with only emergency flights permitted.

Passing a short distance north of the island, Typhoon Paka produced strong winds across northern Guam, though reliable wind reports are incomplete due to the long duration and intensity of the winds. The highest reading believed to be reliable was at Apra Harbor. There, a station recorded a wind gust of before the sensor failed as winds shifted to the southwest; since the winds from the southwest were stronger and of greater duration, officials believe gusts there reached . Additionally, Andersen Air Force Base recorded a peak wind gust of , which at the time was considered the highest wind speed on record, surpassing the 1934 world record of on Mount Washington in New Hampshire. However, a subsequent wind survey of the area discarded the reading at the base, as it was considered unreliable. As microbarographs are less exposed than wind sensors, pressure readings on the island are considered accurate; the lowest reading on the island was at Andersen Air Force Base. In two days, the typhoon dropped about of precipitation on the northern portion of the island, or about 89% of the monthly rainfall total. Waves along northern Guam reached about in height.

The strong winds from Paka left around 1,500 buildings destroyed on the island, of which 1,160 were single-family homes. A further 10,000 buildings sustained damage to some degree, with 60% of the homes on the island reporting major damage. In all, about 5,000 people were left homeless due to the typhoon. Additionally, an estimated 30–40% of the public buildings received major damage. Buildings on the island made of reinforced concrete fared well, as opposed to light metal-frame structures, which more often than not were destroyed. Large tourist hotels near Hagåtña, on which Guam is dependent, received generally minor damage, such as broken windows and damaged power generators.
A complete island-wide power outage followed the typhoon; damage to the main electrical transmission and distribution system was estimated at . Following the passage of the typhoon, 25% of the homes on Guam were left without water. Telephone service remained working after the storm, due to most lines being underground. Strong waves washed away a few coastal roads in the northern portion of the island, leaving them temporarily closed. The waves surpassed the seawall at Apra Harbor, damaging the road and infrastructure of the seaport; many boats were washed ashore after breaking from their moorings. Strong winds damaged a radar system and lights along the runway of the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, though most airport facilities received light damage. Andersen Air Force Base also sustained heavy damage, with hundreds of downed trees and many facilities left damaged. Across Guam, damage was estimated at . About 100 people were injured, but the typhoon caused no deaths on the island.

===Northern Mariana Islands===
A typhoon watch was issued for Rota, Tinian, and Saipan on 14 December, which was upgraded to a typhoon warning the next day. Because Paka was intensifying while passing to the south of Rota, the first wind, or northeast through east winds, was less severe than the second wind from the southeast. Sustained winds on the island reached , with gusts reaching . Many trees in the mountainous portion of the island were left defoliated, which limited nesting and foraging sites for the endangered bridled white-eye bird. While passing to the south of the island, Paka dropped of rain. Damage on the island totaled $4.4 million (1997 USD, $6.4 million 2015 USD). The typhoon also produced above-normal precipitation on Saipan.

==Aftermath==
Following the passage of the typhoon in the Ailinglaplap Atoll in the Marshall Islands, residents experienced severe food shortages due to damaged crops and little rainfall. Experts estimated the entire redevelopment of its fauna would require more than a decade. As a result of the crop shortage, large-scale evacuations of the islands&#x27; residents were considered. Officials in the nation requested assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States, and on 20 March 1998, the area was declared a disaster area; the declaration allowed for the usage of emergency funds.

On 17 December 1997, President Bill Clinton declared Guam a federal disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance. One week later, a disaster declaration was ordered for the Northern Mariana Islands. Ultimately, FEMA received 14,770 Individual Assistance Applications from residents on Guam. In turn, FEMA provided the residents with over $27 million in assistance (1997 USD, $39 million 2015 USD). The entire island of Guam was left without power after Paka. Water and sewage systems on Guam were directly affected minimally by the typhoon. With the usage of power generators, most areas of the island had water pumping capabilities within a few days after the typhoon. The Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport was partially reopened to daytime flights a day after the typhoon, and by a week after the passage of Paka the airport was fully re-opened.

Due to the typhoon&#x27;s impacts on Guam, the World Meteorological Organization later retired the name &quot;Paka&quot; from future use in the central North Pacific. The name &quot;Pama&quot; was chosen as its replacement.

<text>Eremolaena is a genus of flowering plant in the Sarcolaenaceae family, endemic to Madagascar. The genus has three species, all native to the country&#x27;s humid east coast.

The family Sarcolaenaceae is endemic to Madagascar. The genus appears to be most closely related to the genera &quot;Pentachlaena&quot; and &quot;Perrierodendron&quot;.

==Species==
&quot;Eremolaena humblotiana&quot;, known by the vernacular names &quot;Amaninombilahy, Hamaninaombilahy&quot; and &quot;Fotona&quot;, is found in the humid Madagascar lowland forests and Madagascar subhumid forests ecoregions, up to 1200–1500 meters elevation, from the Brickaville to Vatomandry area, Betampona Reserve, Zahamena Reserve, and the area around Lac Alaotra.

&quot;Eremolaena rotundifolia&quot;, known by the vernacular names &quot;Amaninombilahy fotsy, Anjananjana, Fotona, Fotonala, Fotonalahy, Menahy lahy, Takodizahana lahy&quot; and &quot;Voantalanina,&quot; is native to littoral (seaside) forests on sand at Masoala National Park and in the Fort Dauphin area, in the Madagascar lowland forests ecoregion.

<doc id="1052632" wikidata="Q748233" url="?curid=1052632" title="Sylvester–Gallai theorem">
<text>The Sylvester–Gallai theorem in geometry states that every finite set of points in the Euclidean plane has a line that passes through exactly two of the points or a line that passes through all of them. It is named after James Joseph Sylvester, who posed it as a problem in 1893, and Tibor Gallai, who published one of the first proofs of this theorem in 1944.

A line that contains exactly two of a set of points is known as an &quot;ordinary line&quot;. Another way of stating the theorem is that every finite set of points that is not collinear has an ordinary line. According to a strengthening of the theorem, every finite point set (not all on one line) has at least a linear number of ordinary lines. An algorithm can find an ordinary line in a set of formula_1 points in time formula_2.

==History==
The Sylvester–Gallai theorem was posed as a problem by . suggests that Sylvester may have been motivated by a related phenomenon in algebraic geometry, in which the inflection points of a cubic curve in the complex projective plane form a configuration of nine points and twelve lines (the Hesse configuration) in which each line determined by two of the points contains a third point. The Sylvester–Gallai theorem implies that it is impossible for all nine of these points to have real coordinates.

 claimed to have a short proof of the Sylvester–Gallai theorem, but it was already noted to be incomplete at the time of publication. proved the theorem (and actually a slightly stronger result) in an equivalent formulation, its projective dual. Unaware of Melchior&#x27;s proof, again stated the conjecture, which was subsequently proved by Tibor Gallai, and soon afterwards by other authors.

In a 1951 review, Erdős called the result &quot;Gallai&#x27;s theorem&quot;, but it was already called the Sylvester–Gallai theorem in a 1954 review by Leonard Blumenthal. It is one of many mathematical topics named after Sylvester.

== Equivalent versions ==
The question of the existence of an ordinary line can also be posed for points in the real projective plane RP2 instead of the Euclidean plane. The projective plane can be formed from the Euclidean plane by adding extra points &quot;at infinity&quot; where lines that are parallel in the Euclidean plane intersect each other, and by adding a single line &quot;at infinity&quot; containing all the added points. However, the additional points of the projective plane cannot help create non-Euclidean finite point sets with no ordinary line, as any finite point set in the projective plane can be transformed into a Euclidean point set with the same combinatorial pattern of point-line incidences. Therefore, any pattern of finitely many intersecting points and lines that exists in one of these two types of plane also exists in the other. Nevertheless, the projective viewpoint allows certain configurations to be described more easily. In particular, it allows the use of projective duality, in which the roles of points and lines in statements of projective geometry can be exchanged for each other. Under projective duality, the existence of an ordinary line for a set of non-collinear points in RP2 is equivalent to the existence of an &quot;ordinary point&quot; in a nontrivial arrangement of finitely many lines. An arrangement is said to be trivial when all its lines pass through a common point, and nontrivial otherwise; an ordinary point is a point that belongs to exactly two lines.
Arrangements of lines have a combinatorial structure closely connected to zonohedra, polyhedra formed as the Minkowski sum of a finite set of line segments, called generators. In this connection, each pair of opposite faces of a zonohedron corresponds to a crossing point of an arrangement of lines in the projective plane, with one line for each generator. The number of sides of each face is twice the number of lines that cross in the arrangement. For instance, the elongated dodecahedron shown is a zonohedron with five generators, two pairs of opposite hexagon faces, and four pairs of opposite parallelogram faces.
In the corresponding five-line arrangement, two triples of lines cross (corresponding to the two pairs of opposite hexagons) and the remaining four pairs of lines cross at ordinary points (corresponding to the four pairs of opposite parallelograms). An equivalent statement of the Sylvester–Gallai theorem, in terms of zonohedra, is that every zonohedron has at least one parallelogram face (counting rectangles, rhombuses, and squares as special cases of parallelograms). More strongly, whenever sets of formula_1 points in the plane can be guaranteed to have at least formula_4 ordinary lines, zonohedra with formula_1 generators can be guaranteed to have at least formula_6 parallelogram faces.

==Proofs==
The Sylvester–Gallai theorem has been proved in many different ways. Gallai&#x27;s 1944 proof switches back and forth between Euclidean and projective geometry, in order to transform the points into an equivalent configuration in which an ordinary line can be found as a line of slope closest to zero; for details, see . The 1941 proof by Melchior uses projective duality to convert the problem into an equivalent question about arrangements of lines, which can be answered using Euler&#x27;s polyhedral formula. Another proof by Leroy Milton Kelly shows by contradiction that the connecting line with the smallest nonzero distance to another point must be ordinary. And, following an earlier proof by Steinberg, H. S. M. Coxeter showed that the metric concepts of slope and distance appearing in Gallai&#x27;s and Kelly&#x27;s proofs are unnecessarily powerful, instead proving the theorem using only the axioms of ordered geometry.

===Kelly&#x27;s proof===

This proof is by Leroy Milton Kelly. call it &quot;simply the best&quot; of the many proofs of this theorem.

Suppose that a finite set formula_7 of points is not all collinear. Define a connecting line to be a line that contains at least two points in the collection. By finiteness, formula_7 must have a point formula_9 and a connecting line formula_10 that are a positive distance apart such that no other point-line pair has a smaller positive distance. Kelly proved that formula_10 is ordinary, by contradiction.

Assume that formula_10 is not ordinary. Then it goes through at least three points of formula_7. At least two of these are on the same side of formula_14, the perpendicular projection of formula_9 on formula_10. Call them formula_17 and formula_18, with formula_17 being closest to formula_14 (and possibly coinciding with it). Draw the connecting line formula_21 passing through formula_9 and formula_18, and the perpendicular from formula_17 to formula_25 on formula_21 . Then formula_27 is shorter than formula_28. This follows from the fact that formula_29 and formula_30 are similar triangles, one contained inside the other.

However, this contradicts the original definition of formula_9 and formula_10 as the point-line pair with the smallest positive distance. So the assumption that formula_10 is not ordinary cannot be true, QED.

===Melchior&#x27;s proof===

In 1941 (thus, prior to Erdős publishing the question and Gallai&#x27;s subsequent proof) Melchior showed that any nontrivial finite arrangement of lines in the projective plane has at least three ordinary points. By duality, this results also says that any finite nontrivial set of points on the plane has at least three ordinary lines.

Melchior observed that, for any graph embedded in the real projective plane, the formula formula_34 must equal formula_35, the Euler characteristic of the projective plane. Here formula_36, formula_37, and formula_38 are the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the graph, respectively. Any nontrivial line arrangement on the projective plane defines a graph in which each face is bounded by at least three edges, and each edge bounds two faces; so, double counting gives the additional inequality formula_39. Using this inequality to eliminate formula_38 from the Euler characteristic leads to the inequality formula_41. But if every vertex in the arrangement were the crossing point of three or more lines, then the total number of edges would be at least formula_42, contradicting this inequality. Therefore, some vertices must be the crossing point of only two lines, and as Melchior&#x27;s more careful analysis shows, at least three ordinary vertices are needed in order to satisfy the inequality formula_41.

As note, the same argument for the existence of an ordinary vertex was also given in 1944 by Norman Steenrod, who explicitly applied it to the dual ordinary line problem.

====Melchior&#x27;s inequality====
By a similar argument, Melchior was able to prove a more general result. For every formula_44, let formula_45 be the number of points to which formula_46 lines are incident. Then
:formula_47
or equivalently,

:formula_48

===Axiomatics===
 writes of Kelly&#x27;s proof that its use of Euclidean distance is unnecessarily powerful, &quot;like using a sledge hammer to crack an almond&quot;. Instead, Coxeter gave another proof of the Sylvester–Gallai theorem within ordered geometry, an axiomatization of geometry in terms of betweenness that includes not only Euclidean geometry but several other related geometries. Coxeter&#x27;s proof is a variation of an earlier proof given by Steinberg in 1944. The problem of finding a minimal set of axioms needed to prove the theorem belongs to reverse mathematics; see for a study of this question.

The usual statement of the Sylvester–Gallai theorem is not valid in constructive analysis, as it implies the lesser limited principle of omniscience, a weakened form of the law of excluded middle that is rejected as an axiom of constructive mathematics. Nevertheless, it is possible to formulate a version of the Sylvester–Gallai theorem that is valid within the axioms of constructive analysis, and to adapt Kelly&#x27;s proof of the theorem to be a valid proof under these axioms.

==Finding an ordinary line==
Kelly&#x27;s proof of the existence of an ordinary line can be turned into an algorithm that finds an ordinary line by searching for the closest pair of a point and a line through two other points. report the time for this closest-pair search as formula_49, based on a brute-force search of all triples of points, but an algorithm to find the closest given point to each line through two given points, in time formula_50, was given earlier by , as a subroutine for finding the minimum-area triangle determined by three of a given set of points. The same paper of also shows how to construct the dual arrangement of lines to the given points (as used in Melchior and Steenrod&#x27;s proof) in the same time, formula_50, from which it is possible to identify all ordinary vertices and all ordinary lines. first showed how to find a single ordinary line (not necessarily the one from Kelly&#x27;s proof) in time formula_2, and a simpler algorithm with the same time bound was described by .

The algorithm of is based on Coxeter&#x27;s proof using ordered geometry. It performs the following steps:
#Choose a point formula_53 that is a vertex of the convex hull of the given points.
#Construct a line formula_54 that passes through formula_53 and otherwise stays outside of the convex hull.
#Sort the other given points by the angle they make with formula_53, grouping together points that form the same angle.
#If any of the points is alone in its group, then return the ordinary line through that point and formula_53.
#For each two consecutive groups of points, in the sorted sequence by their angles, form two lines, each of which passes through the closest point to formula_53 in one group and the farthest point from formula_53 in the other group.
#For each line formula_60 in the set of lines formed in this way, find the intersection point of formula_60 with formula_54
#Return the line formula_60 whose intersection point with formula_54 is the closest to formula_53.
As the authors prove, the line returned by this algorithm must be ordinary. The proof is either by construction if it is returned by step 4, or by contradiction if it is returned by step 7: if the line returned in step 7 were not ordinary, then the authors prove that there would exist an ordinary line between one of its points and formula_53, but this line should have already been found and returned in step 4.

==The number of ordinary lines==

While the Sylvester–Gallai theorem states that an arrangement of points, not all collinear, must determine an ordinary line, it does not say how many must be determined. Let formula_4 be the minimum number of ordinary lines determined over every set of formula_1 non-collinear points. Melchior&#x27;s proof showed that formula_69. raised the question of whether formula_4 approaches infinity with formula_1. confirmed that it does by proving that formula_72. conjectured that formula_73, for all values of formula_1. This is often referred to as the Dirac–Motzkin conjecture; see for example . proved that formula_75.
Dirac&#x27;s conjectured lower bound is asymptotically the best possible, as the even numbers formula_1 greater than four have a matching upper bound formula_77. The construction, due to Károly Böröczky, that achieves this bound consists of the vertices of a regular formula_21-gon in the real projective plane and another formula_21 points (thus, formula_80) on the line at infinity corresponding to each of the directions determined by pairs of vertices. Although there are formula_81 pairs of these points, they determine only formula_21 distinct directions. This arrangement has only formula_21 ordinary lines, the lines that connect a vertex formula_84 with the point at infinity collinear with the two neighbors of formula_84. As with any finite configuration in the real projective plane, this construction can be perturbed so that all points are finite, without changing the number of ordinary lines.

For odd formula_1, only two examples are known that match Dirac&#x27;s lower bound conjecture, that is, with formula_87 One example, by , consists of the vertices, edge midpoints, and centroid of an equilateral triangle; these seven points determine only three ordinary lines. The configuration in which these three ordinary lines are replaced by a single line cannot be realized in the Euclidean plane, but forms a finite projective space known as the Fano plane. Because of this connection, the Kelly–Moser example has also been called the non-Fano configuration. The other counterexample, due to McKee, consists of two regular pentagons joined edge-to-edge together with the midpoint of the shared edge and four points on the line at infinity in the projective plane; these 13 points have among them 6 ordinary lines. Modifications of Böröczky&#x27;s construction lead to sets of odd numbers of points with formula_88 ordinary lines.

 proved that formula_89 except when formula_1 is seven. Asymptotically, this formula is already formula_91 of the proven formula_92 upper bound. The formula_93 case is an exception because otherwise the Kelly–Moser construction would be a counterexample; their construction shows that formula_94. However, were the Csima–Sawyer bound valid for formula_93, it would claim that formula_96.

A closely related result is Beck&#x27;s theorem, stating a tradeoff between the number of lines with few points and the number of points on a single line.

Ben Green and Terence Tao showed that for all sufficiently large point sets (that is, formula_97 for some suitable choice of formula_98), the number of ordinary lines is indeed at least formula_92. Furthermore, when formula_1 is odd, the number of ordinary lines is at least formula_101, for some constant formula_18. Thus, the constructions of Böröczky for even and odd (discussed above) are best possible. Minimizing the number of ordinary lines is closely related to the orchard-planting problem of maximizing the number of three-point lines, which Green and Tao also solved for all sufficiently large point sets. In the dual setting, where one is looking for ordinary points, one can consider the minimum number of ordinary points in an arrangement of pseudolines. In this context, the Csima-Sawyer formula_103 lower bound is still valid, though it is not known whether the Green and Tao asymptotic formula_92 bound still holds.

==The number of connecting lines==

As Paul Erdős observed, the Sylvester–Gallai theorem immediately implies that any set of formula_1 points that are not collinear determines at least formula_1 different lines. This result is known as the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem. As a base case, the result is clearly true for formula_107. For any larger value of formula_1, the result can be reduced from formula_1 points to formula_110 points, by deleting an ordinary line and one of the two points on it (taking care not to delete a point for which the remaining subset would lie on a single line). Thus, it follows by mathematical induction. The example of a near-pencil, a set of formula_110 collinear points together with one additional point that is not on the same line as the other points, shows that this bound is tight.

==Generalizations==
The Sylvester–Gallai theorem has been generalized to colored point sets in the Euclidean plane, and to systems of points and lines defined algebraically or by distances in a metric space. In general, these variations of the theorem consider only finite sets of points, to avoid examples like the set of all points in the Euclidean plane, which does not have an ordinary line.

===Colored points===
A variation of Sylvester&#x27;s problem, posed in the mid-1960s by Ronald Graham and popularized by Donald J. Newman, considers finite planar sets of points (not all in a line) that are given two colors, and asks whether every such set has a line through two or more points that are all the same color. In the language of sets and families of sets, an equivalent statement is that the family of the collinear subsets of a finite point set (not all on one line) cannot have Property B. A proof of this variation was announced by Theodore Motzkin but never published; the first published proof was by .

===Non-real coordinates===

Just as the Euclidean plane or projective plane can be defined by using real numbers for the coordinates of their points (Cartesian coordinates for the Euclidean plane and homogeneous coordinates for the projective plane), analogous abstract systems of points and lines can be defined by using other number systems as coordinates. The Sylvester–Gallai theorem does not hold for geometries defined in this way over finite fields: for some finite geometries defined in this way, such as the Fano plane, the set of all points in the geometry has no ordinary lines.

The Sylvester–Gallai theorem also does not directly apply to geometries in which points have coordinates that are pairs of complex numbers or quaternions, but these geometries have more complicated analogues of the theorem. For instance, in the complex projective plane there exists a configuration of nine points, Hesse&#x27;s configuration (the inflection points of a cubic curve), in which every line is non-ordinary, violating the Sylvester–Gallai theorem. Such a configuration is known as a Sylvester–Gallai configuration, and it cannot be realized by points and lines of the Euclidean plane. Another way of stating the Sylvester–Gallai theorem is that whenever the points of a Sylvester–Gallai configuration are embedded into a Euclidean space, preserving colinearities, the points must all lie on a single line, and the example of the Hesse configuration shows that this is false for the complex projective plane. However, proved a complex-number analogue of the Sylvester–Gallai theorem: whenever the points of a Sylvester–Gallai configuration are embedded into a complex projective space, the points must all lie in a two-dimensional subspace. Equivalently, a set of points in three-dimensional complex space whose affine hull is the whole space must have an ordinary line, and in fact must have a linear number of ordinary lines. Similarly, showed that whenever a Sylvester–Gallai configuration is embedded into a space defined over the quaternions, its points must lie in a three-dimensional subspace.

===Matroids===
Every set of points in the Euclidean plane, and the lines connecting them, may be abstracted as the elements and flats of a rank-3 oriented matroid. The points and lines of geometries defined using other number systems than the real numbers also form matroids, but not necessarily oriented matroids. In this context, the result of lower-bounding the number of ordinary lines can be generalized to oriented matroids: every rank-3 oriented matroid with formula_1 elements has at least formula_113 two-point lines, or equivalently every rank-3 matroid with fewer two-point lines must be non-orientable. A matroid without any two-point lines is called a Sylvester matroid. Relatedly, the Kelly–Moser configuration with seven points and only three ordinary lines forms one of the forbidden minors for GF(4)-representable matroids.

===Distance geometry===
Another generalization of the Sylvester–Gallai theorem to arbitrary metric spaces was conjectured by and proved by . In this generalization, a triple of points in a metric space is defined to be collinear when the triangle inequality for these points is an equality, and a line is defined from any pair of points by repeatedly including additional points that are collinear with points already added to the line, until no more such points can be added. The generalization of Chvátal and Chen states that every finite metric space has a line that contains either all points or exactly two of the points.

<text>Jane Rossington (born 5 March 1943) is a British actress, best known for her role as Jill Richardson/Harvey/Chance in the soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Derby, Rossington&#x27;s family moved to Sutton Coldfield when she was four years of age. The daughter of a bank manager, she attended Sutton Coldfield Grammar School and was an amateur actress, having trained in the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama, before appearing in repertory theatre in Sheffield and York. She was the only &quot;Crossroads&quot; original cast member to be in the first and last episode of the series.

Rossington spoke the first words of the first episode of &quot;Crossroads&quot; on 2 November 1964, &quot;Crossroads Motel, good evening&quot;. She played Jill Richardson, the daughter of the owner of the Crossroads Motel, Meg Richardson. For the 24 years she appeared in the show the writers delighted in making Jill suffer, and amongst other things, she was married five times - once bigamously - was a drug addict, an alcoholic and had a baby with her stepbrother. As well as being the only actor to remain in the show for its entire series, she also spoke the final words of the final episode in 1988.

Because no regular member of the cast of &quot;Crossroads&quot; had a permanent contract, she had plenty of time to pursue other roles, and played the minor role of Monica Downes in the BBC Radio 4 soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot;. She was, however, an integral part of &quot;Crossroads&quot;. When she became pregnant, the show&#x27;s producer, Reg Watson, ordered the scriptwriters to include the pregnancy in the storyline. When Rossington miscarried, Watson asked her if she would mind if the pregnancy storyline went ahead, as they had had such a positive response from the audience. After agreeing, Rossington conceived again, and in order to not alter the storylines, Jill appeared to be pregnant on screen for 11 months. Jill&#x27;s daughter, Sarah-Jane, was sometimes played by Rossington&#x27;s own daughter, Sorrel. After the demise of the original series, Rossington was seen very little on television but frequently appeared on stage. When ITV1 announced in 2000 that the series was to be revived, she returned to the role.

Rossington also appeared in an episode of the children&#x27;s series &quot;Dramarama&quot;. For a while, she had her own show on Beacon Radio. She later toured in the stage plays &quot;Murder in Mind&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Rock the Boat&quot;. She has also appeared on &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;.

In 2014, she joined fellow Crossroads&#x27; cast members on a special edition of Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the soap. With Tony Adams, Paul Henry and Susan Hanson, Jane recalled some of the highlights from her time working on the hit ATV series.

==In media==
She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in October 1987 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at a central London hotel. In a video interview on YouTube. Rossington stated that she was Eamonn Andrews&#x27; final subject on This Is Your Life as he died on 5 November 1987.

In 2023, Rossington was portrayed by Antonia Bernath in the ITVX drama &quot;Nolly&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rossington now lives in Staffordshire with her second husband, chartered surveyor David Dunger. She has two grown children, Sorrel and Harry. From 1988, Rossington was the main patron of the original Crossroads Appreciation Society. She renewed her involvement with the fan club in 2002, at a time under new management it was officially recognised by the programme creators and Central Carlton. In June 2022, Rossington&#x27;s family revealed that she was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="1052647" wikidata="Q1869750" url="?curid=1052647" title="Loop unrolling">
<text>Loop unrolling, also known as loop unwinding, is a loop transformation technique that attempts to optimize a program&#x27;s execution speed at the expense of its binary size, which is an approach known as space–time tradeoff. The transformation can be undertaken manually by the programmer or by an optimizing compiler. On modern processors, loop unrolling is often counterproductive, as the increased code size can cause more cache misses; &quot;cf.&quot; Duff&#x27;s device.&lt;ref name=&quot;lkml-0008.2/0171&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of loop unwinding is to increase a program&#x27;s speed by reducing or eliminating instructions that control the loop, such as pointer arithmetic and &quot;end of loop&quot; tests on each iteration; reducing branch penalties; as well as hiding latencies, including the delay in reading data from memory. To eliminate this computational overhead, loops can be re-written as a repeated sequence of similar independent statements.

Loop unrolling is also part of certain formal verification techniques, in particular bounded model checking.

==Advantages==
The overhead in &quot;tight&quot; loops often consists of instructions to increment a pointer or index to the next element in an array (pointer arithmetic), as well as &quot;end of loop&quot; tests. If an optimizing compiler or assembler is able to pre-calculate offsets to each &quot;individually referenced&quot; array variable, these can be built into the machine code instructions directly, therefore requiring no additional arithmetic operations at run time.

* Significant gains can be realized if the reduction in executed instructions compensates for any performance reduction caused by any increase in the size of the program.
* Branch penalty is minimized.
* If the statements in the loop are independent of each other (i.e. where statements that occur earlier in the loop do not affect statements that follow them), the statements can potentially be executed in parallel.
* Can be implemented dynamically if the number of array elements is unknown at compile time (as in Duff&#x27;s device).

Optimizing compilers will sometimes perform the unrolling automatically, or upon request.

==Disadvantages==
* Increased Code Size: Unrolling increases the number of instructions, leading to larger program binaries. 
** Higher Storage Requirements: The expanded code takes up more memory, which can be problematic for microcontrollers or embedded systems with limited storage.
** Instruction Cache Pressure: The unrolled loop consumes more space in the instruction cache. If it exceeds the cache size, frequent cache misses can occur, which can cause severe performance degradation due to costly memory accesses.
* Reduced Code Readability: If loop unrolling is done manually instead of by an optimizing compiler, the code can become harder to understand and maintain.
* Conflict with Function Inlining: When the loop body contains function calls, unrolling may prevent inlining due to excessive code expansion, leading to a trade-off between these two optimizations.
* Increased Register Pressure: On hardware that relies on software pipelining for performance (e.g., systems without register renaming or with in-order superscalar execution), unrolling may require additional registers to store temporary variables across iterations, limiting register reuse.
* Branch Prediction: Modern CPUs use branch prediction to try to guess which way a branch will go. If the prediction is correct, the CPU can continue executing instructions without waiting for the branch to resolve. However, if the prediction is incorrect, the CPU has to flush the pipeline and start executing the correct instructions, which can be a performance penalty. Loop unrolling can increase the number of branches in the code, which could lead to more branch mispredictions and lower performance. 

==Static/manual loop unrolling==
Manual (or static) loop unrolling involves the programmer analyzing the loop and interpreting the iterations into a sequence of instructions which will reduce the loop overhead. This is in contrast to dynamic unrolling which is accomplished by the compiler.

===Simple manual example in C===
A procedure in a computer program is to delete 100 items from a collection. This is normally accomplished by means of a codice_1-loop which calls the function &quot;delete(item_number)&quot;. If this part of the program is to be optimized, and the overhead of the loop requires significant resources compared to those for the &quot;delete(x)&quot; function, unwinding can be used to speed it up.

As a result of this modification, the new program has to make only 20 iterations, instead of 100. Afterwards, only 20% of the jumps and conditional branches need to be taken, and represents, over many iterations, a potentially significant decrease in the loop administration overhead. To produce the optimal benefit, no variables should be specified in the unrolled code that require pointer arithmetic. This usually requires &quot;base plus offset&quot; addressing, rather than indexed referencing.

On the other hand, this &quot;manual&quot; loop unrolling expands the source code size from 3 lines to 7, that have to be produced, checked, and debugged, and the compiler may have to allocate more registers to store variables in the expanded loop iteration . In addition, the loop control variables and number of operations inside the unrolled loop structure have to be chosen carefully so that the result is indeed the same as in the original code (assuming this is a later optimization on already working code). For example, consider the implications if the iteration count were not divisible by 5. The manual amendments required also become somewhat more complicated if the test conditions are variables. See also Duff&#x27;s device.

===Early complexity===
In the simple case, the loop control is merely an administrative overhead that arranges the productive statements. The loop itself contributes nothing to the results desired, merely saving the programmer the tedium of replicating the code a hundred times which could have been done by a pre-processor generating the replications, or a text editor. Similarly, codice_2-statements and other flow control statements could be replaced by code replication, except that code bloat can be the result. Computer programs easily track the combinations, but programmers find this repetition boring and make mistakes. 
Consider:

But of course, the code performed need not be the invocation of a procedure, and this next example involves the index variable in computation:

which, if compiled, might produce a lot of code (&quot;print&quot; statements being notorious) but further optimization is possible. This example makes reference only to &quot;x(i)&quot; and &quot;x(i - 1)&quot; in the loop (the latter only to develop the new value &quot;x(i)&quot;) therefore, given that there is no later reference to the array &quot;x&quot; developed here, its usages could be replaced by a simple variable. Such a change would however mean a simple variable &quot;whose value is changed&quot; whereas if staying with the array, the compiler&#x27;s analysis might note that the array&#x27;s values are constant, each derived from a previous constant, and therefore carries forward the constant values so that the code becomes 
 print 2, 2;
 print 3, 6;
 print 4, 24;
 ...etc.

In general, the content of a loop might be large, involving intricate array indexing. These cases are probably best left to optimizing compilers to unroll. Replicating innermost loops might allow many possible optimisations yet yield only a small gain unless n is large.

=== Unrolling WHILE loops ===
Consider a pseudocode WHILE loop similar to the following:
In this case, unrolling is faster because the ENDWHILE (a jump to the start of the loop) will be executed 66% less often.

Even better, the &quot;tweaked&quot; pseudocode example, that may be performed automatically by some optimizing compilers, eliminating unconditional jumps altogether.

== Dynamic unrolling ==
Since the benefits of loop unrolling are frequently dependent on the size of an array—which may often not be known until run time—JIT compilers (for example) can determine whether to invoke a &quot;standard&quot; loop sequence or instead generate a (relatively short) sequence of individual instructions for each element. This flexibility is one of the advantages of just-in-time techniques versus static or manual optimization in the context of loop unrolling. In this situation, it is often with relatively small values of &quot;n&quot; where the savings are still useful—requiring quite small (if any) overall increase in program size (that might be included just once, as part of a standard library).

Assembly language programmers (including optimizing compiler writers) are also able to benefit from the technique of dynamic loop unrolling, using a method similar to that used for efficient branch tables. Here, the advantage is greatest where the maximum offset of any referenced field in a particular array is less than the maximum offset that can be specified in a machine instruction (which will be flagged by the assembler if exceeded).

=== Assembler example (IBM/360 or Z/Architecture) ===
This example is for IBM/360 or Z/Architecture assemblers and assumes a field of 100 bytes (at offset zero) is to be copied from array &quot;FROM&quot; to array &quot;TO&quot;—both having 50 entries with element lengths of 256 bytes each.
* The return address is in R14.
* Initialize registers R15, R0, R1, and R2 from data defined at the end of 
* the program starting with label INIT/MAXM1.
 LM R15,R2,INIT Set R15 = maximum number of MVC
* instructions (MAXM1 = 16), 
* R0 = number of entries of array,
* R1 = address of &#x27;FROM&#x27; array, and
* R2 = address of &#x27;TO&#x27; array.
* The loop starts here.
LOOP EQU * Define LOOP label.
* At this point, R15 will always contain the number 16 (MAXM1).
 SR R15,R0 Subtract the remaining number of 
* entries in the array (R0) from R15.
 BNP ALL If R15 is not positive, meaning we
* have more than 16 remaining entries
* in the array, jump to do the entire
* MVC sequence and then repeat.
* Calculate an offset (from start of MVC sequence) for unconditional branch to 
* the &#x27;unwound&#x27; MVC loop below.
* If the number of remaining entries in the arrays is zero, R15 will be 16, so 
* all the MVC instructions will be bypassed.
 MH R15,=AL2(ILEN) Multiply R15 by the length of one
* MVC instruction.
 B ALL(R15) Jump to ALL+R15, the address of the
* calculated specific MVC instruction 
* with drop through to the rest of them.
* MVC instruction &#x27;table&#x27;. 
* First entry has maximum allowable offset with single register = hexadecimal F00
* (15*256) in this example.
* All 16 of the following MVC (&#x27;move character&#x27;) instructions use base-plus-offset 
* addressing and each to/from offset decreases by the length of one array element
* (256). This avoids pointer arithmetic being required for each element up to a 
* maximum permissible offset within the instruction of hexadecimal FFF 
* (15*256+255). The instructions are in order of decreasing offset, so the last 
* element in the set is moved first.
ALL MVC 15*256(100,R2),15*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 16th entry from 
* array 1 to array 2 (with 
* drop-through).
ILEN EQU *-ALL Set ILEN to the length of the previous
* MVC instruction.
 MVC 14*256(100,R2),14*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 15th entry.
 MVC 13*256(100,R2),13*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 14th entry.
 MVC 12*256(100,R2),12*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 13th entry.
 MVC 11*256(100,R2),11*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 12th entry.
 MVC 10*256(100,R2),10*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 11th entry.
 MVC 09*256(100,R2),09*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 10th entry.
 MVC 08*256(100,R2),08*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 9th entry.
 MVC 07*256(100,R2),07*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 8th entry.
 MVC 06*256(100,R2),06*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 7th entry.
 MVC 05*256(100,R2),05*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 6th entry.
 MVC 04*256(100,R2),04*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 5th entry.
 MVC 03*256(100,R2),03*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 4th entry.
 MVC 02*256(100,R2),02*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 3rd entry.
 MVC 01*256(100,R2),01*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 2nd entry.
 MVC 00*256(100,R2),00*256(R1) Move 100 bytes of 1st entry.
 S R0,MAXM1 Reduce the number of remaining entries
* to process.
 BNPR R14 If no more entries to process, return
* to address in R14.
 AH R1,=AL2(16*256) Increment &#x27;FROM&#x27; array pointer beyond
* first set.
 AH R2,=AL2(16*256) Increment &#x27;TO&#x27; array pointer beyond
* first set.
 L R15,MAXM1 Reload the maximum number of MVC 
* instructions per batch into R15
* (destroyed by the calculation in the 
* first instruction of the loop).
 B LOOP Execute loop again.
* Static constants and variables (these could be passed as parameters, except 
* MAXM1).
INIT DS 0A 4 addresses (pointers) to be 
* pre-loaded with the &#x27;LM&#x27; instruction
* in the beginning of the program.
MAXM1 DC A(16) Maximum number of MVC instructions
* executed per batch.
N DC A(50) Number of actual entries in array (a 
* variable, set elsewhere).
 DC A(FROM) Address of start of array 1 
* (&quot;pointer&quot;).
 DC A(TO) Address of start of array 2 
* (&quot;pointer&quot;).
* Static arrays (these could be dynamically acquired).
FROM DS 50CL256 Array of 50 entries of 256 bytes each.
TO DS 50CL256 Array of 50 entries of 256 bytes each.

In this example, approximately 202 instructions would be required with a &quot;conventional&quot; loop (50 iterations), whereas the above dynamic code would require only about 89 instructions (or a saving of approximately 56%). If the array had consisted of only two entries, it would still execute in approximately the same time as the original unwound loop. The increase in code size is only about 108 bytes even if there are thousands of entries in the array.

Similar techniques can of course be used where multiple instructions are involved, as long as the combined instruction length is adjusted accordingly. For example, in this same example, if it is required to clear the rest of each array entry to nulls immediately after the 100 byte field copied, an additional clear instruction, codice_3, can be added immediately after every MVC in the sequence (where codice_4 matches the value in the MVC above it).

It is, of course, perfectly possible to generate the above code &quot;inline&quot; using a single assembler macro statement, specifying just four or five operands (or alternatively, make it into a library subroutine, accessed by a simple call, passing a list of parameters), making the optimization readily accessible.

=== C example ===
The following example demonstrates dynamic loop unrolling for a simple program written in C. Unlike the assembler example above, pointer/index arithmetic is still generated by the compiler in this example because a variable (i) is still used to address the array element. Full optimization is only possible if absolute indexes are used in the replacement statements.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* The number of entries processed per loop iteration. */
/* Note that this number is a &#x27;constant constant&#x27; reflecting the code below. */
enum {
 BUNCHSIZE = 8

int main(void)
 int i = 0; /* counter */
 int entries = 50; /* total number to process */ 
 /* If the number of elements is not divisible by BUNCHSIZE, */ 
 /* get repeat times required to do most processing in the while loop */

 int repeat = (entries / BUNCHSIZE); /* number of times to repeat */
 int left = (entries % BUNCHSIZE); /* calculate remainder */

 /* Unroll the loop in &#x27;bunches&#x27; of 8 */ 
 while (repeat--) 
 printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i );
 printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 1); 
 printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 2); 
 printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 3); 
 printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 4); 
 printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 5); 
 printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 6); 
 printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 7);

 /* update the index by amount processed in one go */ 
 i += BUNCHSIZE;

 /* Use a switch statement to process remaining by jumping to the case label */ 
 /* at the label that will then drop through to complete the set */ 
 switch (left) 
 case 7 : printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 6); /* process and rely on drop 
 through */
 case 6 : printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 5); 
 case 5 : printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 4); 
 case 4 : printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 3); 
 case 3 : printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 2); 
 case 2 : printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i + 1); /* two left */
 case 1 : printf(&quot;process(%d)\n&quot;, i); /* just one left to process */ 
 case 0 : ; /* none left */
}

Code duplication could be avoided by writing the two parts together as in Duff&#x27;s device.

=== C to MIPS assembly language loop unrolling example ===
Source:

The following example will compute a dot product of two 100-entry vectors A and B of type codice_5. Here is the code in C:
double dotProduct = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
 dotProduct += A[i]*B[i];


==== Converting to MIPS assembly language ====
The following is MIPS assembly code that will compute the dot product of two 100-entry vectors, A and B, before implementing loop unrolling. The code below omits the loop initializations:
* Initialize loop count ($7) to 100.
* Initialize dot product ($f8) to 0.
* Initialize codice_6 pointer ($5) to the base address of codice_7.
* Initialize codice_8 pointer ($6) to the base address of codice_9.
Note that the size of one element of the arrays (a codice_5) is 8 bytes.
 loop3:
 l.d $f10, 0($5) ; $f10 ← A[i]
 l.d $f12, 0($6) ; $f12 ← B[i]
 mul.d $f10, $f10, $f12 ; $f10 ← A[i]*B[i]
 add.d $f8, $f8, $f10 ; $f8 ← $f8 + A[i]*B[i]
 addi $5, $5, 8 ; increment pointer for A[i] by the size
 ; of a double.
 addi $6, $6, 8 ; increment pointer for B[i] by the size
 ; of a double.
 addi $7, $7, -1 ; decrement loop count
 test:
 bgtz $7, loop3 ; Continue if loop count &gt; 0
==== Unrolling the Loop in MIPS ====
The following is the same as above, but with loop unrolling implemented at a factor of 4. Note again that the size of one element of the arrays (a codice_5) is 8 bytes; thus the 0, 8, 16, 24 displacements and the 32 displacement on each loop.
 loop3:
 l.d $f10, 0($5) ; iteration with displacement 0
 l.d $f12, 0($6)
 mul.d $f10, $f10, $f12
 add.d $f8, $f8, $f10

 l.d $f10, 8($5) ; iteration with displacement 8
 l.d $f12, 8($6)
 mul.d $f10, $f10, $f12
 add.d $f8, $f8, $f10

 l.d $f10, 16($5) ; iteration with displacement 16
 l.d $f12, 16($6)
 mul.d $f10, $f10, $f12
 add.d $f8, $f8, $f10

 l.d $f10, 24($5) ; iteration with displacement 24
 l.d $f12, 24($6)
 mul.d $f10, $f10, $f12
 add.d $f8, $f8, $f10

 addi $5, $5, 32
 addi $6, $6, 32
 addi $7, $7, -4
 test:
 bgtz $7, loop3 ; Continue loop if $7 &gt; 0

<text>Balgonie is a town in southeast Saskatchewan, Canada. Situated at the intersection of Highways 10, 46, and the Trans-Canada Highway, the town is part of the White Butte region and neighbours Pilot Butte, White City, and McLean. As well, it is located 25 kilometres east of the province&#x27;s capital city, Regina. As of the 2016 census, Balgonie had a population of 1,765, an 8.3% growth from 2011. The town is governed by the Balgonie Town Council and is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Edenwold No. 158. Balgonie is located in Treaty 4 territory.

Balgonie has a Subway restaurant, two gas stations, an outdoor pool, and an ice arena. It is also home to Greenall School.

==History==
Balgonie was named for Balgonie Castle in Scotland. In 1882, the first train ran through the area on the Canadian Pacific Railway, and a post office was established in 1883. In 1884, Sir John Lister Kaye established a model farm near the railway in Balgonie, with the town being the easternmost point of the old 76 Ranch lands.

A school was built in 1891, and Balgonie was incorporated as a village in 1903 and as a town in 1907.

One of Balgonie&#x27;s most famous residents was William Wallace Gibson (1876–1965), who created the first Canadian-built airplane. Gibson successfully flew his airplane in Victoria in 1910. Gibson was the subject of the 1991 stop-motion animated short &quot;The Balgonie Birdman&quot;, directed by Brian Duchscherer and produced by the National Film Board of Canada.

The town&#x27;s population plummeted during the 1930s and 1940s, but the completion of the Trans-Canada Highway in the late 1950s brought new growth.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Balgonie had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="1052653" wikidata="Q1514198" url="?curid=1052653" title="Aligoté">
<text>Aligoté is a white grape used to make dry white wines, especially in the Burgundy region of France where it was first recorded in the 18th century. Since it is tolerant to cold, this variety is also cultivated in Eastern European countries. In 2004, it was the 22nd most planted vine variety in the world at 45,000 hectares (110,000 acres).

==Description==
Aligoté is used to produce a varietal white wine, and is sometimes included in the blend of Burgundian sparkling wine known as Crémant de Bourgogne. The varietal appellation Bourgogne Aligoté AOC is made exclusively from Aligoté grapes. Traditionally, the cocktail &quot;kir&quot; (also known as &quot;vin blanc cassis&quot; in French) is made by adding cassis to an Aligoté wine. In blends, Aligoté adds acidity and structure to other varieties. It is often blended with Sacy for this purpose.

The grape ripens early with moderate yields and produces wines high in acidity that can be drunk young. Its aroma includes elements of apples and lemons. Clive Coates says it is a variety of secondary importance in Burgundy which produces a light, primeur-style wine with slightly herbal flavour and rather higher acidity than the Chardonnay. The village of Bouzeron is considered to represent the region&#x27;s finest examples of the variety with the appellation Bouzeron-Aligoté AOC restricting the yields to 45 hl/ha compared to the Bourgogne Aligoté AOC limited to 60 hl/ha.

==Regional production==

The grape is the second most popular white grape variety grown in Burgundy after Chardonnay, though it lies a long way behind in terms of planted area, with against . The vines were once inter-planted and field blended with Chardonnay for the benefit of added acidity but the vines have long since been separated. Aligoté often loses territory to more prestigious grape varieties and in some areas is relegated to less productive vineyard sections at the tops and bottoms of the slopes. In Burgundy the grape can be found along the fringe edges of the Côte-d&#x27;Or along Route Nationale 74, as well as in Mâconnais and Côte Chalonnaise. There are also small plantings just east of the Rhone Valley around the city Die and in the commune of Pierrevert in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. It has its own AOC&#x27;s, Bourgogne Aligoté and Bouzeron.

Aligoté is also produced in Eastern European countries, including Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Switzerland and Moldova. In Bulgaria, the grape is prized for its blending qualities and high acid; the quantity of Aligoté planted in Bulgaria is more than twice that in the grape&#x27;s ancestral home of Burgundy. The grape is primarily found in the Stara Zagora Province around Chirpan. In Russia, it is used to make sparkling wines with varietal wines being made along the coast of the Black Sea around Gelendzhik.

Globally, Aligoté can be found in smaller plantings. It has been produced, though in very small quantity, by Australian wineries. In the United States, the wine is grown in Washington State, since it is resistant to the cold weather, and in California, where it is used mostly for blending. There have also been small, experimental plantings in Chile. In Canada, the grape is grown in Niagara by Chateau de Charmes.

==Origins==
DNA fingerprinting has found Aligoté to be a crossing of Pinot noir and Gouais blanc, an ancestry consistent with an origin in Burgundy or nearby areas of eastern France.

==Synonyms==
Synonyms for Aligoté include Aligotay, Alligotay, Alligoté, Blanc de Troyes, Carcairone blanc, Carcarone, Carchierone, Chaudenet, Chaudenet Gras, Giboudot blanc, Griset blanc, Karkarone Blank, Melon de Jura, Muhranuli, Mukhranudi, Pistone, Plant de Trois, Plant de Trois Raisins, Plant gris, Purion blanc, Selon Molon, Selon Odart, Troyen blanc, Vert blanc.

<text>Waldemar Theodor Ager (March 23, 1869 – August 1, 1941) was a Norwegian-American newspaperman and author.

==Early life==
Waldemar Theodor Ager was born at Fredrikstad, in Østfold, Norway. He grew up nearby in Gressvik, just across the Glomma River. He was the son of Martinius Mathisen Ager (1834–1894) and Marie Fredrikke Mathea Johnsdatter Stillaugsen (1835–1913). Today, the street he lived on in Gressvik is named &quot;Waldemar Agers Vei&quot; in honor and in memory of Ager. In 1883, Ager&#x27;s father emigrated to America by himself to start a tailoring shop. In 1885, Waldemar Ager and his family went to join his father in Chicago.

Not long after his arrival in America, Ager and got his start in the newspaper business by becoming involved with &quot;Norden&quot;, Chicago&#x27;s largest-circulation Norwegian-language newspaper. He never held any high position at that newspaper, but it got him his start in the business. When Ager first arrived in America, he encountered a vibrant, thriving Norwegian-American community. Use of the Norwegian language was widespread. Hundreds of small-circulation Norwegian-language newspapers and dozens of large circulation Norwegian-language newspapers were in operation from Michigan to the Dakotas and everywhere Norwegian immigrants were living. At the time, the Norwegian-American community was constantly being reinforced by new immigrants from Norway.

Norwegian-American cultural and linguistic retention were at their height from the 1890s-1910s. Over a million Americans spoke Norwegian as their primary language in those three decades. It is estimated that over 3,000 Lutheran churches in the Upper Midwest used Norwegian as their &quot;sole&quot; language of worship. It is to the retention of this Norwegian-American culture that Waldemar Ager dedicated much of the rest of his life. He also championed many liberal political causes including women&#x27;s suffrage, various farmer and labor movements, and prohibition.

==Prohibitionist==

Prohibition was very popular in the Norwegian-American community and Ager became one of the leaders of the movement. Ager personally helped form hundreds of total abstinence societies and Good Templar lodges across the Upper Midwest. Ager&#x27;s prohibitionist beliefs and his fledgling newspaper career crossed paths for the first time when he became involved with a Norwegian temperance lodge in Chicago in the late 1880s. The lodge had a small-circulation monthly newspaper, and Ager began writing articles for it. Ager remained a teetotaler his entire life, before, during, and after the decade-long period of Prohibition in the United States.

==Newspaper editor and writer==
Ager&#x27;s newspaper career began in earnest when, at the age of 23, he moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, after being offered a job at a Norwegian temperance newspaper called &quot;Reform&quot;. Ager was associated with &quot;Reform&quot; (both the newspaper and literal reform), for the rest of his life. The editor of &quot;Reform&quot; died in 1903 and Ager took over the position. Eventually Ager came to own the paper. &quot;Reform&quot; folded shortly after Ager&#x27;s death in 1941.

In addition to his long newspaper career, Ager penned six novels and numerous collections of short stories. Although he never achieved the commercial success of his friend, Ole Edvart Rølvaag, Ager&#x27;s body of work is thought to be on many levels, comparable with and sometimes superior to that of Rølvaag. A humorist in the tradition of Mark Twain, Ager specialized in character sketches, and dramatizing the tragicomic plight of the Norwegian immigrant. Some of his more important works, translated into English, are &quot;Christ before Pilate&quot;, &quot;On The Way to The Melting Pot&quot;, &quot;Sons of The Old Country&quot;, and &quot;I Sit Alone&quot;.

Ager was also a popular orator, traveling the stump circuit for much of his career, speaking wherever Norwegian-Americans gathered. For &quot;Syttende Mai&quot; in 1916, Ager shared a platform with William Jennings Bryan. The city of Eau Claire meant more to Ager than just a career. It was here that Ager met a Norwegian immigrant girl from Tromsø, Norway, named Gurolle Blestren. Ager and Blestren married and raised nine children in a home that still stands near Half Moon Lake in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The house, now known as the Brady Anderson and Waldemar Ager House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been designated a Literary Landmark by the National Association of Friends of Public Libraries.

<text>Lumsden is a town in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley in south central Saskatchewan, Canada, 31 km northwest of the city of Regina. It is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Lumsden No. 189. The town functions as both a farming community and an unofficial suburb of Regina. Lumsden has an active artistic community, which consists of many writers, painters, and sculptors.

==History==
Settlers first arrived in 1881 and the area came to be commonly known as Happy Hollow. When the Qu&#x27;Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway came through the community in 1889, the name was changed to Lumsden after Hugh Lumsden, a senior engineer with the railway.

The town has repeatedly flooded, with major flood events occurring in 1892, 1904, 1916, 1948, and 1969. In 1974, Lumsden experienced the highest water levels in the town&#x27;s history; volunteers from Regina and all surrounding communities came to help with sandbagging. The town subsequently straightened the Qu&#x27;Appelle River&#x27;s channel and built dikes. The Town was at risk for flooding again in 2011 after a wet fall winter of record snowfall; however, it did not flood.

The community was chosen by Harrowsmith Magazine in 2002 as the &quot;prettiest&quot; town in the province.

=== Centennial ===
Official town centennial celebrations were held in March 2005. In May 2005, Lumsden hosted Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh at the Lumsden Sports Centre. Hundreds of guests were entertained by Marny Duncan-Cary, the Lumsden Community Choir, the Riel Reelers, and the Lumsden &amp; District Band and Jazz Ensemble. The event was held in celebration of both the town and the province&#x27;s centenaries, and was the only engagement of Canada&#x27;s Queen outside urban centres on that visit to Saskatchewan.

== Demographics ==

=== Lumsden Duck Derby ===
Each year since 1987, the Duck Derby Committee hosts a fundraiser in which thousands of numbered plastic ducks are raced down the Qu&#x27;Appelle River. Participants purchase a numbered duck which is entered in the race, and the first ducks across the finish line win their owners cash and prizes. Proceeds from the derby benefit the Lumsden Sports Center (rink) in town. The Duck Derby also hosts a variety of artists, musicians, traders, etc. who perform and sell their wares in town.

=== Lumsden Scarecrow Festival ===
Lumsden hosts an annual Scarecrow Festival in September. Events of the day include a large street market, hay rides, activities for kids, food vendors, garage sales, outdoor movie and fireworks. The event usually draws thousands of people to town.
