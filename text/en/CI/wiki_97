<text>Daniel Mannix Petrie Jr. (born November 30, 1951) is a Canadian-American producer, writer, and director of film and television. He is best known for pioneering the sub-genres of action comedy and buddy cop films through films like &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; and &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch&quot;. He served as President of the Writers Guild of America, West between 1997 and 1999, and then again between 2004 and 2005. He currently serves as the President of the Board of Directors at the Writers Guild Foundation. 

== Life and career ==
Petrie was born in Canada to Daniel Petrie Sr., a film director, and Dorothea, a producer, novelist, and actress. He attended Northfield Mount Hermon School and the University of Redlands, earning degrees in psychology and creative writing. Originally a literary agent, he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and joined the film industry as a screenwriter. His debut screenplay, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, was the result of numerous rewrites and several radically different iterations over the course of a decade. 

At one point, the film was a serious action film starring Sylvester Stallone, a project that Stallone later took with him and developed into &quot;Cobra&quot;. Despite the troubled production history, the film was a massive critical and financial success, grossing over $300 million worldwide from a $15 million budget and earning rave reviews from critics like Janet Maslin and Richard Schickel. In spite of much of the film&#x27;s comedy having been improvised by the actors, Petrie&#x27;s contributions earned him accolades in the form of Academy Award and Edgar Award nominations.

Petrie wrote a number of well-known and well-received films throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including the off-beat crime thriller &quot;The Big Easy&quot; starring Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin. He wrote two films for director Roger Spottiswoode, the 1988 thriller film &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot; and the Tom Hanks comedy &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch&quot;, and produced a third, &quot;The 6th Day&quot;. Much of his work falls under the umbrella of crime fiction. He made his directorial debut with &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;, a 1991 action film revolving around a group of teenagers fighting terrorists that have taken over their prep school. He served as the creator and executive producer of &quot;Combat Hospital&quot;, a television war drama series produced in his native Canada.

In addition to his creative pursuits, Petrie has been active in various entertainment industry organizations. He served as Vice President, and later President, of the Writers Guild of America, West, and currently sits on its Board of Trustees. He also served as a member of the Board of Trustees for the American Film Institute; a member of the Board of Governors for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences; and as a member of the Board of Advisers of the Austin Film Festival and Screenwriting Conference. He is co-founder of Enderby Entertainment, an independent film finance and production company.

<text>Bloomington–Normal, officially known as the Bloomington, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area, is a metropolitan statistical area in Central Illinois anchored by the twin municipalities of Bloomington and Normal. At the 2010 census, the municipalities had a combined urban population of 132,600, while the metropolitan area had a population of 169,572.

Prior to 2013, the metropolitan area consisted of only McLean County. In 2013, the Office of Management and Budget revised the delineations of the metropolitan area to include all of DeWitt and McLean counties. Additionally, the Bloomington–Pontiac [[Combined statistical area|Combined Statistical Area]] was created to combine the Bloomington MSA with the &quot;Pontiac, Illinois micropolitan statistical area.&quot; The CSA includes McLean and Livingston counties.

<doc id="1077393" wikidata="Q3265880" url="?curid=1077393" title="Sydling St Nicholas">
<text>Sydling St Nicholas is a village and civil parish in Dorset within southwest England. The parish is northwest of the county town Dorchester and covers most of the valley of the small Sydling Water in the chalk hills of the Dorset Downs. The parish has an area of and includes the hamlet of Up Sydling in the north.

Sydling St Nicholas village was recorded in the 11th-century Domesday Book, though evidence of much earlier human occupation has been found in the surrounding area. Over the last thousand years the village has been owned by Milton Abbey, Sir Francis Walsingham and Winchester College.

The whole of Sydling St Nicholas parish lies within the Dorset National Landscape area. In addition, parts of the parish lie within the Hog Cliff National Nature Reserve and the Cerne and Sydling Downs Special Area of Conservation.

In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 414.

==Toponymy==
&#x27;Sydling&#x27; derives from the Old English &quot;sīd&quot; and &quot;hlinc&quot;, which mean &#x27;broad ridge&#x27; and refer to the hills around the village. In the 10th century the village was recorded as &quot;Sidelyng&quot; and in the Domesday Book of 1086 it was &quot;Sidelince&quot;. The second part of the name comes from the dedicated saint of the parish church.
==History==
People have lived in the area for nearly 5,000 years, though in pre-Roman times human habitation was confined to the hilltops. Early artefacts found in the vicinity include Neolithic hand-axes and Bronze and Iron Age pottery. Evidence of an early village settlement exists at Shearplace Hill, about 0.75 miles (1.25 km) to the south-east of the current village. Remains of Celtic field systems have been found in the north and west of the parish. Saxon settlers arrived in the valley in the 7th or 8th century; evidence of their strip lynchets can still be seen on the surrounding hillsides. In 933 AD land was given to the monks at Milton Abbey, who provided the village with a priest. 

The abbey was the lord of the village at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, which recorded 54 households with a value to the abbey of £25. In subsequent centuries the village has been owned by Sir Francis Walsingham, Secretary of State to Queen Elizabeth, and by Winchester College.

Sir John Smith, 1st Baronet, lived in Sydling St Nicholas and the Smith family remained a leading local family through the 18th and 19th centuries, with a number of memorials in the parish church.

Sydling St Nicholas once constituted a liberty, containing only the parish itself.

==Geography==
Sydling St Nicholas is sited in the valley of Sydling Water, a tributary of the River Frome. The valley is one of several roughly parallel valleys which cut into the dip slope of the Dorset Downs, a line of chalk hills that span the centre of the county. The village lies at an altitude of and the surrounding chalk hills rise to at Gore Hill to the north. The hills and all of the civil parish lie within the Dorset National Landscape area. In the south of the parish and within the Cerne and Sydling Downs Special Area of Conservation are two parts of the three-part Hog Cliff National Nature Reserve (the third part lies within the neighbouring parish of Maiden Newton).

Measured directly, Sydling St Nicholas village is NW of Dorchester, ENE of Bridport and SSE of Yeovil. The A37 Dorchester-Yeovil main road runs along the top of the hills about to the west of the village.

===Sydling Water===
Sydling Water is a chalk stream that rises just to the north of Sydling St Nicholas in the hamlet of Up Sydling. The stream divides upon entering the village, and many cottages are reached across small bridges. The stream used to flow along the High Street in an open course, resulting in occasional floods; after a thunderstorm in June 1889 one local man, Tom Churchill, drowned after having been swept away, and his body was found about a mile downstream. Today Sydling Water is known for its watercress farms.

==Notable buildings==

Within the parish are more than fifty structures listed by Historic England for their architectural or historic interest. In 1905 Sir Frederick Treves described the village as &quot;the most charming in the district&quot;.

The 15th-century parish church of St Nicholas, which is built on slightly higher ground than most of the houses in the village, replaces at least two other buildings previously built on the site. It possesses a Norman font and a fine tower. The tower clock has no face and dates from 1593, making it one of the oldest in England. The south aisle has settled since construction, so the south wall is buttressed and has only a small door. In 1905 Treves described the church as being &quot;quite famous for its numerous and amazing gargoyles&quot;, although seventy-five years later Dorset-based writer Roland Gant noted it instead for being &quot;Light, open, airy, free of restorers&#x27; excesses&quot;, and for possessing a &quot;noble wagon-roof&quot; in the nave. The church is a Grade I listed building. 

Next to the church are Court House and Court Farm. Court House is the village manor house and was the venue for meetings of the local Court leet. Court Farm has a large Elizabethan tithe barn which overlooks the churchyard; it was built in 1590 and constructed from flint, with stone buttresses and oak roof beams. In his 18th-century &quot;History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset&quot;, John Hutchins stated that one of the beams in the barn was inscribed with &#x27;L.V.W. 1590&#x27;, the initials being those of Lady Ursula Walsingham, though searches by subsequent writers have failed to find them, and the beam may have been removed when the roof thatch was removed in the 20th century.

The Old Vicarage is based on an early Tudor building which was expanded and altered in 1640. Adjoining it is the mullioned old bakery, dating from 1733 upon a 17th-century core.

==In literature and film==

Thomas Hardy names the village as Sidlinch or Broad Sidlinch in his story &#x27;The Grave by the Handpost&#x27; (1897) published in &quot;The Changed Man and Other Tales&quot; (1913). These names are reminiscent of previous forms of the village&#x27;s name, such as &#x27;Broadsidlynch&#x27; in 1333 
and &#x27;Brodesedelyng&#x27;, in a legal record, in Latin, dated 1440, where John Tidde was a clerk.

The parish church was used as a location in the 1967 film adaptation of Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot;, in a scene that involved water pouring from one of the church&#x27;s gargoyles onto the grave of Fanny Robin.

The Sydling valley is used as a location within Geoffrey Household&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;Rogue Male&quot;.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census Sydling St Nicholas parish had a population of 414 in 206 dwellings, with 89.8% of households having at least one usual resident. The average age of the population was 46.6, compared to 39.3 for England as a whole; 26.1% of residents were 65 years old or older, compared to 16.4% for England as a whole.

The historic population of Sydling St Nicholas parish from the censuses between 1921 and 2001 is shown in the table below.

<text>Symondsbury () is a village and civil parish in southwest Dorset, England, west of Bridport and west of Dorchester. The A35 road runs through the parish to the south of the village. The village has a pub (the Ilchester Arms), a pottery and a primary school. Symondsbury parish extends from Eype and West Cliff (West Bay) in the south, to the Marshwood Vale in the north. The village is in the Dorset National Landscape area. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 1,059.

==Toponymy==
The name Symondsbury derives from Old English and means the hill or barrow (&quot;beorg&quot;) belonging to a man named &quot;Sigemund&quot;. It was listed in the Domesday Book as &quot;Simondesberge&quot;.

==History and economy==
Symondsbury is recorded in the Domesday Book as having 31 households, with the lord of the manor being Cerne Abbey, which was also the lord at the time of the Norman Conquest.

In historical times the main economy of the village was the production of flax and hemp for Bridport&#x27;s rope and net manufacturing trade.

More recently the main business has been milk, beef, sheep, pigs and arable production and, since the decline of agriculture in the late 20th century, the village has hosted two colleges, many small workshops and several large self-catering holiday lets. The village still has several orchards, two cider presses, one apple juice business, an orchard conservation company, artists, potters, an outdoor toddler group and a primary school. Many of the inhabitants still work in the village on the two business parks and other converted agricultural buildings.
The small River Simene passes through the parish. A tributary stream also wanders through the village itself, coming from a spring that is believed still to have healing properties. In the medieval age, people from miles around came to bathe their eyes, that were then allegedly healed. There is an old road from the sea through the village, that used to take pilgrims to the shrine of St Wite at Whitchurch Canonicorum.

In 2004-05 The Symondsbury Apple Project undertook research into Dorset&#x27;s orchard and cider history discovering that in Symondsbury parish there were over 100 acres of orchard in 1839.

==Governance==
For elections to the UK parliament, Symondsbury is in the West Dorset constituency. , the Member of Parliament is Edward Morello of the Liberal Democrats.

Symondsbury has two-tiers of local government. At the lower level, Symondsbury is a civil parish governed by a parish council with 8 members. At the upper level, Symondsbury is part of Dorset unitary authority. The parish is in the Bridport electoral ward, which elects 3 of the 82 members of Dorset Council.

Historically, Symondsbury was in Bridport Rural District from 1894 to 1974, and then part of West Dorset district from 1974 to 2019.

==Colmer&#x27;s Hill==
The main landmark in the village is the distinctive Colmer&#x27;s Hill, a near-conical sandstone eminence topped by pine trees. It is highly visible from the main street in Bridport, and its significance extends back to around the 11th century. The hill takes its name from the &quot;Colmer Tenement&quot;. The family were tenants of the Dukes of Somerset and Earls of Ilchester in the 17th and 18th centuries and the Rev. John Colmer was the rector from 1805–06.

During World War I 21 Scots Pine trees were planted on the summit by Major W P Colfox MC in memory of those who had died in battle. In 2006, Sir John Colfox planted some additional Monterey Pine. The hill now forms an iconic subject for artists and photographers.

==Church==
The parish church of St John the Baptist is in Early English style and cruciform shape, it has a nave, transepts, south porch and square tower with six small bells and a clock. The registers date from 1558. Records show that the first rector arrived in 1325. In the north and south transept there are spyholes, known as squints, through which the congregation could see the priest at the altar.

The stained glass in a memorial window in the church was designed around 1884 by William Lethaby, who later became Professor of Ornament &amp; Design at the Royal College of Art.

==Principal houses==

The principal houses in the village are Symondsbury Manor, Shutes Farmhouse and the Old Rectory (now known as Oakhayes).

Like many so-called manor houses, this one has not formed the administrative centre of the manorial landholding. It was not until the 20th century when the then owners, the Colfox family, had collected together much of the previously manorial land that the house acquired this title. In 1975 the house was separated from the land and sold to Peter Hitchin. Originally a medieval farmhouse, it was heavily remodelled by Crickmay in the late 19th century for the Symonds Udall family to whom Thomas Hardy and William Barnes were regular visitors.

Shutes Farmhouse, originally a medieval hall house, was built from trees felled in 1449. Symondsbury was held by the Abbey of Cerne until dissolution, whence it passed to the Dukes of Somerset and this was the administrative centre of their manorial landholding. In 1672 the Duchess of Somerset, to clear the debts of the late Duke, sold much of Symondsbury in nearly two dozen lots to various tenants, but retained Shutes Farmhouse (the Colmer tenement) as the centre of the residual manorial holding which along with the Lordship were sold shortly afterwards to the Earl of Ilchester whose heir still holds the title, but no land.

Oakhayes was built in two phases at the beginning and end of the 18th century. It was such a rich living that the rector at the time even boasted his own pack of hounds and the kennels can still be seen. An engraving of the house dated 1799 was published in the &quot;History of Dorset&quot; by John Hutchins.

==Transport==

The village centre is around north of the A35 trunk road. There is no bus service through the village, but the X51 Dorchester-Axminster and X53 Weymouth-Axminster services stop on the main road.

Symondsbury has several footpaths into the surrounding area. The nearby sunken lanes Shute&#x27;s Lane and Hell Lane are a popular local walk.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census the parish had 581 dwellings, 486 households and a population of 1,059.

<text>Blink was one of the earliest and largest online communities in Norway, which operated from 2002 to 2011. Launched by the media lab of the national daily newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot;, at its peak, it had 300,000 users.

The community was finally closed down at the end of 2011, due to a mass flight of users to competitors like Facebook. After this flight, the 4,000 active members were not enough for the community to remain viable and it was therefore closed down.

<text>Paul Jozef Crutzen (; 3 December 1933 – 28 January 2021) was a Dutch meteorologist and atmospheric chemist. In 1995, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry alongside Mario Molina and Frank Sherwood Rowland for their work on atmospheric chemistry and specifically for his efforts in studying the formation and decomposition of atmospheric ozone. In addition to studying the ozone layer and climate change, he popularized the term Anthropocene to describe a proposed new epoch in the Quaternary period when human actions have a drastic effect on the Earth. He was also amongst the first few scientists to introduce the idea of a nuclear winter to describe the potential climatic effects stemming from large-scale atmospheric pollution including smoke from forest fires, industrial exhausts, and other sources like oil fires.

He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and an elected foreign member of the Royal Society in the United Kingdom.

==Early life and education==
Crutzen was born in Amsterdam, the son of Anna (Gurk) and Josef Crutzen. In September 1940, the same year Germany invaded The Netherlands, Crutzen entered his first year of elementary school. His classes moved around to different locations after the primary school was taken over by the Germans; during the last months of the war he experienced the &#x27;winter of hunger&#x27; with several of his schoolmates dying of famine or disease. In 1946 with some special help he graduated from elementary school and moved onto Hogere Burgerschool (Higher Citizens School). There, with the help of his cosmopolitian parents he became fluent in French, English, and German. Along with languages he also focused on natural sciences in this school, graduating in 1951; however his exam results did not qualify him for university scholarships. Instead, he studied Civil Engineering at a Higher Professional Education school with lower costs, and took a job with the Bridge Construction Bureau in Amsterdam in 1954. After completing military service, in 1958 he married Terttu Soininen, a Finnish university student whom he had met a few years earlier and moved with her to Gävle, a tiny city 200 km north of Stockholm where he took a job at a construction bureau. After seeing an advertisement by the Department of Meteorology at Stockholm University for a computer programmer, he applied, was selected, and in July 1959 moved with his wife and new daughter Ilona to Stockholm.

==Beginning of academic career==
In the 1920&#x27;s Norwegian meteorologists began using fluid mechanics in analyse weather, and by 1959 the Meteorology Institute of Stockholm University was at the forefront of meteorology research using numerical modeling. The theories were validated in 1960 by images from Tiros, the first weather satellite.

At that time, Stockholm University housed the fastest computers in the world with the BESK (Binary Electronic Sequence Calculator) and its successor, the Facit EDB. Crutzen was involved with the programming and application of some of those early numerical models for weather prediction, and also developed a tropical cyclone model himself.

Working as a programmer at the university, he was able to take other lectures and in 1963 applied for a PhD program with a thesis combining mathematics, statistics and meteorology.

Although intending to extend his cyclone model for his thesis, around 1965 he was asked to help US scientists with a numerical model for the distribution of oxygen allotropes (atomic oxygen, molecular oxygen and ozone) in the stratosphere, the mesosphere and the lower thermosphere. This involved studies of stratospheric chemistry and the photochemistry of ozone. His PhD awarded in 1968, &quot;Determination of parameters appearing in the &quot;dry&quot; and the &quot;wet&quot; photochemical theories for ozone in the stratosphere&quot;, suggested that nitrogen oxides (NOx) should be studied. 

His thesis was well-received and led to a post-doctoral fellowship at the Clarendon Laboratory of the University of Oxford, on behalf of the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), the precursor of ESA.

==Research career==
Crutzen conducted research primarily in atmospheric chemistry. He is best known for his research on ozone depletion. In 1970 he pointed out that emissions of nitrous oxide (), a stable, long-lived gas produced by soil bacteria, from the Earth&#x27;s surface could affect the amount of nitric oxide (NO) in the stratosphere. Crutzen showed that nitrous oxide lives long enough to reach the stratosphere, where it is converted into NO. Crutzen then noted that increasing use of fertilizers might have led to an increase in nitrous oxide emissions over the natural background, which would in turn result in an increase in the amount of NO in the stratosphere. Thus human activity could affect the stratospheric ozone layer. In the following year, Crutzen and (independently) Harold Johnston suggested that NO emissions from the fleet of, then proposed, supersonic transport (SST) airliners (a few hundred Boeing 2707s), which would fly in the lower stratosphere, could also deplete the ozone layer; however more recent analysis has disputed this as a large concern.

In 1974 Crutzen received a prepublication draft of a scientific paper by Frank S. Rowland, professor of Chemistry at University of California, Irvine, and Mario J. Molina, a postdoctoral fellow from Mexico. It concerned the possible destructive effects of chlorofluoromethanes on the ozone layer. Crutzen immediately developed a model of this effect, which predicted severe depletion of ozone if those chemicals continued to be used at that current rate.
Crutze has listed his main research interests as &quot;Stratospheric and tropospheric chemistry, and their role in the biogeochemical cycles and climate&quot;. From 1980, he worked at the Department of Atmospheric Chemistry at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, in Mainz, Germany; the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego; and at Seoul National University, South Korea. He was also a long-time adjunct professor at Georgia Institute of Technology and research professor at the department of meteorology at Stockholm University, Sweden. From 1997 to 2002 he was professor of aeronomy at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Utrecht University.

He co-signed a letter from over 70 Nobel laureate scientists to the Louisiana Legislature supporting the repeal of that U.S. state&#x27;s creationism law, the Louisiana Science Education Act. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.

, Crutzen had an h-index of 151 according to Google Scholar and of 110 according to Scopus. On his death, the president of the Max Planck Society, Martin Stratmann, said that Crutzen&#x27;s work led to the ban on ozone-depleting chemicals, which was an unprecedented example of Nobel Prize basic research directly leading to a global political decision.

=== Anthropocene ===

One of Crutzen&#x27;s research interests was the Anthropocene. In 2000, in IGBP Newsletter 41, Crutzen and Eugene F. Stoermer, to emphasize the central role of mankind in geology and ecology, proposed using the term anthropocene for the current geological epoch. In regard to its start, they said:

To assign a more specific date to the onset of the &quot;anthropocene&quot; seems somewhat arbitrary, but we propose the latter part of the 18th century, although we are aware that alternative proposals can be made (some may even want to include the entire holocene). However, we choose this date because, during the past two centuries, the global effects of human activities have become clearly noticeable. This is the period when data retrieved from glacial ice cores show the beginning of a growth in the atmospheric concentrations of several &quot;greenhouse gases&quot;, in particular CO2 and CH4. Such a starting date also coincides with James Watt&#x27;s invention of the steam engine in 1784.

=== Geoengineering (Climate intervention)===
Steve Connor, Science Editor of &quot;The Independent&quot;, wrote that Crutzen believes that political attempts to limit man-made greenhouse gases are so pitiful that a radical contingency plan is needed. In a polemical scientific essay that was published in the August 2006 issue of the journal &quot;Climatic Change&quot;, he says that an &quot;escape route&quot; is needed if global warming begins to run out of control.

Crutzen advocated for climate engineering solutions, including artificially cooling the global climate by releasing particles of sulphur in the upper atmosphere, along with other particles at lower atmospheric levels, which would reflect sunlight and heat back into space. If this artificial cooling method actually were to work, it would reduce some of the effects of the accumulation of green house gas emissions caused by human activity, potentially extending the planet&#x27;s integrity and livability.

In January 2008, Crutzen published findings that the release of nitrous oxide () emissions in the production of biofuels means that they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace.

=== Nuclear winter ===
Crutzen was also a leader in promoting the theory of nuclear winter. Together with John W. Birks he wrote the first publication introducing the subject: &quot;The atmosphere after a nuclear war: Twilight at noon&quot; (1982). They theorized the potential climatic effects of the large amounts of sooty smoke from fires in the forests and in urban and industrial centers and oil storage facilities, which would reach the middle and higher troposphere. They concluded that absorption of sunlight by the black smoke could lead to darkness and strong cooling at the earth&#x27;s surface, and a heating of the atmosphere at higher elevations, thus creating atypical meteorological and climatic conditions which would jeopardize agricultural production for a large part of the human population.

In a &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; newspaper article printed in January 1991, along with his nuclear winter colleagues, Crutzen hypothesized that the climatic effects of the Kuwait oil fires would result in &quot;significant&quot; nuclear winter-like effects; continental-sized effects of sub-freezing temperatures.

== Awards and honours==
Crutzen, Mario J. Molina, and F. Sherwood Rowland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 &quot;for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone&quot;. Some of Crutzen&#x27;s others honours include the below:

<text>Javier Carlos Vázquez (born July 25, 1976) is a Puerto Rican former Major League Baseball starting pitcher. He played for the Montreal Expos (–), New York Yankees (, ), Arizona Diamondbacks (), Chicago White Sox (–), Atlanta Braves (), and Florida Marlins ().

==Personal life==
Vázquez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Vázquez is married to Kamille Vázquez. They have three children: Kamila, Javier Josué, and Kariana. Vázquez claims that he dislikes being the center of attention outside of the playing field and describes himself as a &#x27;house man&#x27; spending his free time with his children. Vázquez is also interested in art pieces especially the ones that are produced by Puerto Rican artists and he possesses paintings by Wichie Torres and Iván Rosario. Vázquez has also expressed that he has always been interested in charity work, this interest was fueled by his parents as he states that a Christian upbringing and their support when he began practicing sports were part of this influence.

==Professional career==

===Minor Leagues===
Vázquez was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the fifth round (140th overall) of the 1994 MLB draft. The same year, he began his professional career with the team&#x27;s Rookie-level club in West Palm Beach, Florida, the GCL Expos. In 15 games (11 starts), Vázquez went 5–2 with a 2.53 ERA. He struck out 56 batters while walking 15 in a team-leading innings pitched. In 1995, he was promoted to the Single-A Albany Polecats, where he finished 6–6 with a 5.08 ERA in 21 starts. In innings pitched, he struck out 87 batters, but also walked 47. In 1996, while with the Single-A Delmarva Shorebirds, Vázquez went 14–3 with a 2.68 ERA in 27 starts. He pitched innings with a team-leading 173 strikeouts and 57 walks. The following year, Vázquez started the season with the High-A West Palm Beach Expos, going 6–3 with a 2.16 ERA in 19 starts while striking out 100 and walking 28 in innings. He was later promoted to the Double-A Harrisburg Senators, where he posted a perfect 4–0 record and a 1.07 ERA in six starts. In 42 innings pitched with Harrisburg, Vázquez struck out 47 batters and walked 12.

===Montreal Expos (1998–2003)===
Vázquez made his Major League debut for the Expos on April 3, 1998, against the Chicago Cubs, pitching five innings of three-run ball in the 6–2 loss. He picked up his first win on May 1 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, allowing three earned runs in innings while striking out eight. He finished his rookie season appearing in 33 games (32 starts), compiling a 5–15 record and a 6.06 ERA. Vázquez pitched innings, striking out 139 batters while walking 68.

In , as part of a young Expos rotation of &quot;twentysomething&quot;, &quot;tall&quot;, &quot;power&quot; pitchers Vázquez started the season as the team&#x27;s number three pitcher, but after recording a 6.63 ERA through June, he was sent to the Triple-A Ottawa Lynx. Upon his recall after the All-Star break, Vázquez turned things around, winning seven of his final 11 decisions and prompting ESPN to write that he had &quot;turn[ed] the corner ... dramatically.&quot; On September 14 against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Vázquez tossed his first career shutout. He finished the year with 26 starts, going 9–8 with a 5.00 ERA while pitching innings and recording 131 strikeouts. Vázquez was the losing pitcher when David Cone, of the New York Yankees, pitched a perfect game against the Expos on July 18, 1999.

In , Vázquez again began the season as the Expos&#x27; number three starter. He was thought of as a promising young pitcher, and pitched the team&#x27;s third game on April 5 against the Dodgers, striking out five batters while allowing two earned runs on eight hits across seven innings in a 6–5 Expos win. The Expos would win his following three starts and eight of his first eleven leaving the Expos at 27–23 on June 1. In the wake of injuries to pitchers Matt Blank, Mike Thurman and Hideki Irabu, Vázquez&#x27;s 2.79 ERA, good for fourth-best in the NL, was noted as a key part to their success. After a sweep of the Baltimore Orioles and a win against the New York Yankees, the Expos were at 31–23, good for second place behind the Atlanta Braves in the NL East, and third in the entire National League. During his June 6 start, under pressure, Vázquez struck out seven batters in six innings, but he also walked four and gave up a home run to Bernie Williams in an 8–1 loss to the Yankees. The Expos would go on to lose seven of their next nine leaving them at 33–31, eighth in the National League. The Expos would finish 67–95, and Vázquez finished his season with an 11–9 record and a 4.05 ERA in 33 starts. He pitched innings, striking out 196 while only walking 61. Vázquez was later invited to play in the 2000 Japanese All-Star Series.

By , Vázquez had become the ace of the Expos pitching staff thought of as a &quot;bright young star and an All-Star for years to come.&quot; On April 2, he opened the season in Chicago, pitching innings while striking out five, but he also allowed four earned runs and walked three against the Cubs. The Expos won a close game, 5–4. He pitched better in his next start, the home opener at Olympic Stadium, striking out nine without issuing any walks across seven shutout innings in a 10–0 rout of the New York Mets. Vázquez would finish the season with 16–11 with a 3.42 ERA in 32 starts. In innings pitched, he recorded 208 strikeouts while only walking 44 batters.

In , Vázquez pitched innings, striking out 179 batters while walking 49. He posted a 10–13 record with a 3.91 ERA in 34 starts. Despite this, he lost his arbitration case following the season and was awarded $6 million rather than his requested $7.15 million.

In , Vázquez set career-highs with innings pitched and 241 strikeouts. In 32 starts, he was 13–12 with a 3.24 ERA. Regarded as one of the league&#x27;s top pitchers, he signaled to then GM Omar Minaya that he might not resign with the Expos, a team then threatened with contraction. Later, when asked by &quot;The New York Times&quot; about his experience in Montreal that year, he said it was tough &quot;being over there having no owner. If you needed somebody the last couple years when we were in the hunt, especially last year, we couldn&#x27;t get a player we needed.&quot; The article went on to note that for financial reasons the Expos not only couldn&#x27;t &quot;obtain players from other teams who might have helped the Expos stay in the wild-card race, but the Expos also weren&#x27;t allowed to call up players from the minor leagues.&quot;

===New York Yankees (2004)===
On December 4, 2003, the New York Yankees agreed to acquire Vázquez from the Expos in exchange for Nick Johnson, Juan Rivera and Randy Choate. He later agreed to a four-year, $45 million deal through the season on January 5, 2004. Entering the season, The Hardball Times predicted him as their &quot;consensus pick for the Cy Young&quot;.

After starting the season 9–5 with a 3.50 ERA, Vázquez was named a 2004 All-Star, replacing Oakland Athletics pitcher Tim Hudson. However, he struggled in the second half, and finished the season 14–10 with a 4.91 ERA in 32 starts. His struggles continued in the postseason, including a disappointing performance in Game 7 of the 2004 American League Championship Series, where Vázquez pitched two innings of relief, allowing three runs on two hits (both home runs to Johnny Damon) while walking five batters in a 10–3 loss.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (2005)===
On January 11, 2005, the Yankees traded Vázquez, Brad Halsey, and Dioner Navarro to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for Randy Johnson. Johnson, then a 10-time All-Star, had won the National League Cy Young Award each year from 1999 to 2002 and had finished in second place in Cy Young voting that year (striking out a league high 290 batters with only 44 walks in 245 innings.)

As Arizona&#x27;s Opening Day starter, Vázquez surrendered seven earned runs while striking out two without walking anyone in innings, earning the loss in a 16–6 defeat to the Cubs. In 33 starts overall, he posted an 11–15 record and a 4.42 ERA while striking out 192 batters and walking 46 in innings. In the month of May, he pitched 46 innings without walking a single batter. The stretch was broken at 54 innings in the fifth inning of a June 9 start against the Minnesota Twins.

After pitching the 2005 season with Arizona, Vázquez formally requested a trade from the team, asking for a location which was &quot;easier for his family in Puerto Rico to visit.&quot;

===Chicago White Sox (2006–2008)===

On December 20, 2005, Vázquez was traded to the Chicago White Sox for Orlando Hernández, Luis Vizcaíno, and Chris Young. In his first season with the White Sox, he was 11–12 with a 4.84 ERA in 33 games (32 starts).

Vázquez agreed to play for the Puerto Rico Team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, joining fellow Puerto Rican players Carlos Delgado, Carlos Beltrán, Bernie Williams, amongst others representing the island in a team managed by St. Louis Cardinals third base coach Jose Oquendo.

For the 2007 season, Vázquez finished with a 15–8 with a 3.74 ERA in 32 starts. He struck out 213 and walked 50 in innings pitched. He exceeded the 200-strikeout mark for the third time in his career, with the other two occasions being in and 2003. This season was the seventh season in his career where he had thrown at least 200 innings. The only season that he was not able to work this quantity of innings was in 2004 when Joe Torre, then manager of the New York Yankees decided to jump some turns in the team&#x27;s rotation. Vázquez culminated that year with 198 innings. When asked about Javier&#x27;s performance during the season in an interview, White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén noted that Vázquez had been throwing well for some time but the team had not been able to capitalize on this until it was too late in the season, specifically referring to the team&#x27;s performance during the summer.

In 2008, Vázquez posted a 12–16 record and a 4.67 ERA in 33 starts. In the postseason, he started Game 1 of the 2008 American League Division Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, allowing six earned runs in innings to earn the loss. The White Sox would later lose the series to the Rays in four games.

===Atlanta Braves (2009)===

On December 4, 2008, Vázquez was traded along with Boone Logan to the Atlanta Braves for minor league catcher Tyler Flowers, shortstop Brent Lillibridge, third baseman Jon Gilmore and pitcher Santos Rodriguez. With the Braves in 2009, Vázquez had perhaps his most successful season, as he went 15–10 with a 2.87 ERA in 32 starts to go along with 238 strikeouts and 44 walks in innings. He also led the majors in sacrifice hits, with 20.

Vázquez came in fourth place in the voting for the 2009 NL Cy Young Award after the season.

===Second stint with the New York Yankees===

On December 22, 2009, the New York Yankees re-acquired Vázquez, this time from the Braves with LHP Boone Logan, in exchange for OF Melky Cabrera, LHP Mike Dunn and pitching prospect Arodys Vizcaíno. At this time, he was thought of as &quot;one of the top starters in all of baseball&quot; after what was thought of as being one of the best if not the best statistical seasons by a pitcher in 2009.

On July 21, 2010, Vázquez became the third active pitcher to beat all 30 MLB teams along with Barry Zito and Jamie Moyer. After struggling in August, the Yankees temporarily demoted Vázquez to the bullpen. In his second-to-last appearance of the season on September 23, 2010, he came into the game in relief against the Rays and proceeded to hit three batters in a row (tying a big-league record), while the Rays went on to score two runs on no hits. Vázquez finished the regular season with a 10–10 record and an ERA of 5.32 in 31 games (26 starts).

Due to his struggles in the regular season, the Yankees once again demoted Vázquez to the bullpen for him to be on the postseason roster. The Yankees won the 2010 ALDS against the Minnesota Twins in three games, but lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 ALCS in six games. Vázquez became a free agent after the season.

===Florida Marlins (2011)===
On November 28, 2010, Vázquez reached an agreement on a one-year, $7 million contract with the Florida Marlins. The deal was finalized on December 2. He began the season by going 3–6 with a 7.09 ERA through his first 13 games. After that, he went 10–5 with a 1.92 ERA the rest of the way.

He made his first start for the Marlins on April 3 against the Mets, allowing seven runs (four earned) on six hits while walking five in a shortened 2.1 inning start. In his first interleague start against the Rays, he struck out seven batters in seven innings while walking two in a 5–3 win in what was called his &quot;best start of the year.&quot; Following this start, he continued to pitch well, striking out 20 and walking five (one intentional) in innings in games at Los Angeles, Arizona and Florida. At the end of the season, Vázquez had a 29-inning scoreless streak, the longest in Marlins history, during which he struck out 28 batters while only walking four.

In his final game as a pitcher on September 27, Vázquez went the distance against the Washington Nationals. He allowed five hits and two runs while striking out nine batters on 97 pitches as the Marlins rallied in the ninth to win 3–2. In his final season, Vázquez posted a 13–11 record and a 3.69 ERA in 32 starts.

==Pitching style==
Vázquez threw from a three-quarters arm slot with &quot;good command of a running/sinking fastball&quot; that, according to FanGraphs, overall averaged 91 mph. According to Josh Kalk of The Hardball Times. his fastball was &quot;over 93 mph on average&quot; in his peak. Kalk considered this particularly impressive considering his arm angle noting that &quot;normally pitchers who have a very low release point sacrifice speed and vertical movement for horizontal movement.&quot; Kalk went on to note that Vázquez&#x27;s fastball averaged nine inches of vertical movement &quot;thanks to an exceptionally high spin rate on his fastball.&quot;

He also threw a &quot;tight&quot; slider which averaged 83 mph and &quot;a big breaking curve-ball&quot; which averaged 74 mph. His curveball was thought to be especially difficult to hit; in 2004, Sandy Alomar Jr. called it the &quot;best breaking ball I&#x27;ve seen; Bert Blyleven doesn&#x27;t throw it better [...] you don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s going to land. He changes speeds with the breaking ball. He throws it hard. He throws it at you. He knows how to set you up.&quot; Kalk called it a &quot;slurvy curve with huge horizontal movement and little vertical drop&quot; noting that he &quot;can add and subtract from a pitch that can like anything from one of his better sliders to a 65 mph beast with massive horizontal and vertical movement.&quot; Poet Carson Cistulli once wrote that &quot;Javier Vázquez&#x27;s curvepiece makes me a Better Man&quot;

He featured two types of changeups: &quot;one that darts like a cutter and one that resembles a screwball&quot;. Kalk noted an 11 mph difference between his fastball and changeup, FanGraphs a 10.5 mph average for his career (90.9 mph compared to 80.4 mph).

===Fastball velocity===
Baseball writer Dave Cameron writes in his piece &quot;Javier Vázquez&#x27;s Fastball Is Probably Not Coming Back&quot; that beginning in 2010, Vazquez&#x27;s fastball dropped from 91 mph to 89 mph and that &quot;given his career workload, I wouldn’t bet on Vazquez&#x27;s fastball ever coming back.&quot; In May, 2011, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; noted that while Vázquez&#x27;s velocity had been down, &quot;now it is registering in the low 90s. When one fastball snapped his glove Friday, Buck said he glanced up at the reading on the Dodger Stadium scoreboard and saw 94.&quot; In June 2011, Joe Frisaro confirmed that his velocity had &quot;increased&quot; and that Vazquez&#x27;s fastball was topping out &quot;at a season-high 94 mph&quot;.

This was statistically confirmed in September by Eric Seidman: &quot;from June 11 until now, Vazquez threw his fastball 53 percent of the time, and the pitch averaged 91.1 mph, right in line with his career&quot;.

==Post-baseball career==
Vázquez was hired as an international special assistant to Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Tony Clark on April 30, 2014.

<text>Steak &#x27;n Shake Operations, Inc., doing business as Steak &#x27;n Shake, is an American fast food chain concentrated primarily in the Midwestern United States with locations also in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Western United States, Europe, and the Middle East. The company is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Biglari Holdings. , 628 Steak &#x27;n Shake restaurants were in operation; of those 414 were corporate-owned, and 214 franchised. The company has since attempted to convert to a fully franchised model. 

Restaurant locations have drive-thru, and indoors fast-food dining experience. For in store dining, orders are placed via a self-service kiosk point of sales systems: two options provided Cash or Credit. When the meal is ready, diners pickup their food at a counter in the rear of the dining room. The food is served bagged for take-out or on plastic trays with plastic baskets if dining in. Wait staff and counter service has been eliminated since 2022. In 2021, the company had 536 locations, but the number had dropped to 493 by March 31, 2023, according to Biglari Holdings; not all of those were in operation at that time. The business model had been shifting away from full-service restaurants as well, toward a drive-thru model and to &quot;counter-service ... featuring kiosks&quot;. 

Many locations are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week. The menu features primarily burgers and hand-dipped milkshakes; other entrees, side items, and drinks are also available. The corporation&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Famous for Steakburgers&quot;, refers to its most prominent food item, the Steakburger. The &quot;steak&quot; in the restaurant name comes from the menu item.

==History==
A. H. &quot;Gus&quot; Belt (born in Morrisonville, Illinois) founded Steak &#x27;n Shake in Normal, Illinois, in February 1934, after serving four years in the United States Marine Corps. He converted the combination gas station and chicken restaurant that he owned (Shell&#x27;s Chicken) into a hamburger stand.

Steak &#x27;n Shake&#x27;s slogan, &quot;In Sight, It Must Be Right&quot;, originally referred to Belt&#x27;s practice of wheeling a barrel of T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks into the public area of his restaurant, then grinding them into burgers in front of his customers—it was intended to reassure customers of the product&#x27;s wholesomeness as at the time, ground beef was still viewed with skepticism by the general public, based on the likelihood of its having impurities deliberately added to it. 

It also assured Belt&#x27;s customers of the veracity of his &quot;Steakburger&quot; claim. Later patrons were assured that Steakburgers were still made from these ingredients &quot;at our own commissary&quot; for shipment to the restaurants, where the open grill line remained &quot;in sight&quot; to customers.

After having success, Belt purchased a chain of Goal Post restaurants throughout central Illinois, converting them to Steak &#x27;n Shakes and added curb service.

The original building at the intersection of Main Street and West Virginia Avenue was damaged by a fire in the early 1960s but was repaired and its dining room expanded. In the late 1990s, Steak &#x27;n Shake sold the building to the Monical&#x27;s Pizza company.

===After Gus Belt===
Steak &#x27;n Shake continued to expand throughout Illinois following Belt&#x27;s death on August 20, 1954. Ownership passing through many hands, including Gus&#x27;s wife Edith, who ran the chain until 1969; Longchamps, Inc., an East Coast steakhouse company that owned the chain from 1969 to 1971; and Indianapolis-based Franklin Corporation, led by Robert Cronin, author of &quot;Selling Steakburgers: The Growth of a Corporate Culture&quot;. After the acquisition, Franklin moved Steak &#x27;n Shake&#x27;s headquarters from Normal, Illinois to Indianapolis.

In 1981, Steak &#x27;n Shake and its parent company Franklin were acquired by E. W. Kelley and Associates; the chairman E. W. &quot;Ed&quot; Kelley led the restaurant chain until he died on July 4, 2003.

===Under Sardar Biglari===
Entrepreneur Sardar Biglari took control of Steak &#x27;n Shake in August 2008 after three years of declining same-store sales and losses of $100,000 per day. He led a turnaround which resulted in 24 straight quarters of increases in same-store sales and profits of $100,000 per day. He focused the brand on burgers, fries and milkshakes, reducing the menu from eight pages to a bi-fold. However the chain ran into more problems in 2016 and onward, with revenue declining sharply. Reasons included under-investment in the restaurants after the deep price cuts of 2008; competition from &quot;fast casual&quot; restaurants like Chipotle which aimed for a more high-class experience; and two expensive lawsuits from former managers who accused the chain of misclassifying them as salaried employees and refusing to pay earned overtime.

In 2018, Steak &#x27;n Shake changed its business model to a franchise partner system, with Biglari attempting to turn all of the 400+ company-owned restaurants into franchise operations. Entrepreneurial single-unit operators could take control of an existing Steak &#x27;n Shake for $10,000, an unusually low price, but were required to give the company 50% of the restaurant&#x27;s profits. Even though it offered the new franchise inducement, the firm remained heavily indebted. As of April 2020, its debt was rated as a low C/D &quot;speculative&quot; grade (colloquially known as junk bonds) by bond rating agencies. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; considered the chain to be extremely likely to default with a low likelihood of recovering, with the restaurant closings due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States being an unrecoverable blow to the firm.

In 2021, Steak N&#x27; Shake made a strategic decision to transition away from casual dining and become a fast food restaurant. Steak &#x27;n Shake replaced lunch counters with self-serve kiosks in 2021 to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The chain estimated that remodeling and adding kiosks to each restaurant would cost between $100,000 and $200,000. Changing the service model allowed a significant reduction of store staff. According to management, the old casual dining model faced the challenge of long food preparation time and a cost structure that required paying wait staff. Long term strategy is to empower customers to place and pick up their own orders.

==Controversies==
===Franchise pricing lawsuits===
Between 2010 and 2015, Steak &#x27;n Shake became involved in lawsuits with several of its franchisees concerning mandatory menu prices and mandatory food sourcing. , five lawsuits had been filed. The first lawsuit began in 2010; it was filed by Stuller, Inc., the Illinois franchisee that is the oldest franchisee in Steak &#x27;n Shake&#x27;s history. Stuller won a preliminary injunction that went to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2012. Three more franchisees filed suit in April 2013—Druco Restaurants based in St. Louis, People Sales &amp; Profit Co. based in Georgia, and Scott&#x27;s S&amp;S Inc. in Pennsylvania. A settlement was reached with these franchisees in 2014, but terms of the settlement were not made public.

Steak &#x27;n Shake filed suit against Denver franchisees Larry and Christopher Baerns in July 2013 over the same issues, with a counterclaim soon after. Steak &#x27;n Shake won its lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Baerns when the judge ruled that the Baerns intentionally overcharged customers. The complaints by the franchisees also question whether Steak &#x27;n Shake promised franchise results that could never actually be achieved under its policies.

===Employee classification lawsuits===
286 managers in the St. Louis area filed and won a lawsuit against Steak &#x27;n Shake on grounds that they were misclassified as exempt employees unable to earn overtime. Steak &#x27;n Shake had to pay $7.7 million in damages. They were sued again by an even larger group of 1100+ managers on similar grounds; as of 2019, that case was pending.

<text>George Davis Snell NAS (December 19, 1903 – June 6, 1996) was an American mouse geneticist and basic transplant immunologist.

==Work==

George Snell shared the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Baruj Benacerraf and Jean Dausset for their discoveries concerning &quot;genetically determined structures on the cell surface that regulate immunological reactions&quot;. Snell specifically &quot;discovered the genetic factors that determine the possibilities of transplanting tissue from one individual to another. It was Snell who introduced the concept of H antigens.&quot; Snell&#x27;s work in mice led to the discovery of HLA, the major histocompatibility complex, in humans (and all vertebrates) that is analogous to the H-2 complex in mice. Recognition of these key genes was prerequisite to successful tissue and organ transplantation.

==Life==

George Snell was born in Bradford, Massachusetts, the youngest of three children. His father (who was born in Minnesota) worked as a secretary for the local YMCA; he invented a device for winding induction coils for motorboat engines. Snell was educated in the Brookline, Massachusetts schools and then enrolled at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire where he continued his passion for mathematics and science, focusing on genetics. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Dartmouth in 1926.

On the recommendation of John Gerould, his genetics professor at Dartmouth, Snell did graduate work at Harvard University with William E. Castle, the first American biologist to look for Mendelian inheritance in mammals. Snell earned his PhD from Harvard in 1930. His doctoral thesis was on genetic linkage in mice.

Upon receiving the PhD from Harvard, George Snell was employed as a teacher at Brown University, from 1930 to 1931.

Snell then spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas with H.J. Muller, who pioneered radiation genetics (and was also to win a Nobel Prize). Snell studied the genetic effects of x-rays on mice with Muller.

This experience &quot;served to convince me that research was my real love,&quot; Snell wrote in his autobiography.&quot;If it were to be research, mouse genetics was the clear choice and the Jackson Laboratory, founded in 1929 by Dr. Clarence Cook Little, one of Castle&#x27;s earlier students, almost the inevitable selection as a place to work.&quot; The Jackson Laboratory was (and still is) the world&#x27;s mecca for mouse genetics.

From 1933 to 1934, Snell was a teacher at Washington University in St. Louis.

After brief stints as teachers, in 1935 Snell joined the staff of The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor on Mount Desert Island on the coast of Maine and he remained there for the entire balance of his long career. In Bar Harbor, he met and married Rhoda Carson. Together they had three sons, Thomas, Roy, and Peter. In his leisure time, Snell enjoyed skiing, a passion he developed during his years at Dartmouth, as well as tennis.

Snell received the Cancer Research Institute William B. Coley Award in 1978 for distinguished research in immunology. In 1988, he authored a substantial book, &quot;Search for a Rational Ethic&quot;, on the nature of ethics and the rules by which we live. It includes an evolution-based ethic founded on biological realities that he believed to be applicable to all human beings.

Snell died in Bar Harbor on June 6, 1996. His wife died in 1994.

<text>Tarrant Gunville is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England, situated at the head of the Tarrant Valley on Cranborne Chase northeast of Blandford Forum. The parish covers at an elevation of . In the 2011 census the parish—which includes the settlement of Stubhampton to the north—had 119 dwellings, 108 households and a population of 233.

The parish has three round barrows and an unexcavated Iron Age enclosure with a 15&#x27; deep ditch, which Pevsner suspects was built in a hurry.

The medieval settlements in the parish were Stubhampton and Gunville. The parish church, dedicated to St Mary, is on the edge of Tarrant Gunville. It is on the site of an earlier building which probably dated from around 1100. The present building has a south porch, aisles and tower arch that are partly 14th-century, and a 15th-century west tower that was partly rebuilt in the 16th century, but the chancel and nave were rebuilt in 1843. The architect of the rebuilding was Thomas Henry Wyatt.

Eastbury House, the surviving part of a much larger house designed by John Vanbrugh and built between 1717 and 1738, stands just east of Tarrant Gunville village. The larger part of the house was demolished in 1782. The grounds still display evidence of the original gardens, designed by Charles Bridgeman. It is probable that several of the ashlar and flint houses in the village were built using material taken from the demolished house. The photographer Thomas Wedgwood moved into the surviving part of Eastbury in 1800; his brother, the potter Josiah, had bought nearby Gunville House in 1799, shortly after its construction.

The modern village hall was completed in 2001.

There are 23 structures in the parish that are listed by English Heritage for their special historical or architectural interest. These include Eastbury House (Grade I) and the parish church (Grade II*).

<text>The United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) is the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) for United States Strategic Command and United States Space Command. It was established in 1985 as the Army Strategic Defense Command, responsible for ballistic missile defense. In 1992, it merged with Army Space Command to become Army Space and Strategic Defense Command. In 1997, it became an Army Major Command and was redesignated Army Space and Missile Defense Command.

Army Space and Missile Defense Command is responsible for developing and providing the Army with space, missile defense and high altitude capabilities. It consists of two operational elements: the 100th Missile Defense Brigade and the 1st Space Brigade. The commander of Army Space and Missile Defense Command also serves as the commander of United States Space Command&#x27;s Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense.

Following the Space Force&#x27;s establishment, the Army&#x27;s continued involvement with space has become controversial, with multiple proposals and reports advocating for the Space Force to absorb the Army&#x27;s remaining space forces, as it did with the Navy&#x27;s space forces, or even Space and Missile Defense Command as a whole. The Space Force has absorbed the Army&#x27;s satellite communications mission and the Joint Tactical Ground Stations, while the Army maintains the 100th Missile Defense Brigade and a downsized 1st Space Brigade. The Army is attempting to redefine its role in space operations, focused on integrating and interdicting space capabilities for land forces.

==Structure==
The SMDC is made up of several components, Active Army and full-time Army National Guard, due to the 24-hour a day, 7-day a week, 365-day a year nature of SMDC&#x27;s mission:

==History==

The Army&#x27;s involvement with ballistic missile defense can be traced back to the Nike Zeus program in the late-1950s, being developed to counter the Soviet Union&#x27;s ballistic missiles, however, it was never deployed. This was followed by the Nike-X program, which was replaced by the Sentinel program in 1967 before deployment. The Sentinel program was highly ambitious, intending to operationally deploy 6 Perimeter Acquisition Radars, 17 Missile Site Radars, 480 long-range LIM-49 Spartan missiles, and 220 short-range Sprint missiles. Army support for the Sentinel waned as more resources were required to support its land forces in Vietnam, rather than the secondary mission of ballistic missile defense. Controversy over the Sentinel program led to its suspension in 1969 and it was replaced by the Safeguard program within the year.

Unlike Sentinel, which was intended to protect large areas of the United States, Safeguard was focused on defending the Air Force&#x27;s missile fields and against a more limited nuclear attack from China. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty limited the United States and Soviet Union to two anti-ballistic missile sites, later reduced to on in 1974. Only one Safeguard site, at what is now Cavalier Space Force Station, ever reached full operating capability before the program was canceled under congressional pressure in December 1975. The single operational Perimeter Acquisition Radar was repurposed as part of the NORAD early warning system and transferred to the Air Force in 1977. It currently is operated by the Space Force&#x27;s 10th Space Warning Squadron.
President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1983 announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative reinvigorated the Army&#x27;s missile defense enterprise. The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization was a multi-service organization, consisting of Army, Navy, and Air Force elements. On 1 July 1985, the Army established the Army Strategic Defense Command and served as the lead for ground-based interceptors while the Air Force led the space-based elements of the program.

Following the creation of United States Space Command, the Army was the last of the three services to create a space command. Army Space Command was the smallest, being led by a Colonel. Ultimately, the Army chose to cut Army Space Command staffing by ten percent and merge it with Army Strategic Defense Command to form Army Space and Strategic Defense Command in 1992. Following the Bush and Clinton administrations, the Strategic Defense Initiative was significantly scaled back to focus on protection against limited strikes and the Army began to refocus on theater missile defense.

Army Space Command continued to exist as a specialized sub-command within Army Space and Strategic Defense Command. On 1 May 1995, Army Space Command&#x27;s Military Satellite Communications Directorate, responsible for operating the Defense Satellite Communications System payload became the 1st Satellite Control Battalion. This was the first regular Army unit with an operational space mission. It also began fielding the Joint Tactical Ground Station and Army Space Support Teams.

In 1997, the Army Space and Strategic Defense Command was renamed Army Space and Missile Defense Command and elevated to a full major command. Following the September 11 attacks, the Army was directed to deploy a national missile defense system, which would become the Ground-Based Midcourse Defenses.

The United States Army Futures Command, formed 24 August 2018, gives priority to modernization of air and missile defense. Cross-functional teams were instituted to oversee the modernization effort in the areas of hypersonic systems, maneuver SHORAD (M-SHORAD) and Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS).

==Mission transfers to the United States Space Force==

When the Space Force was established in 2019 it was intended to consolidate the existing military space forces across the Army, Navy, and Air Force. When the Space Force was established, the greatest resistance to transferring its space forces came from the Army. At the time of the Space Force&#x27;s establishment in 2019, the Army had three major space operations units: the 1st Space Brigade, 100th Missile Defense Brigade, and the Army Satellite Operations Brigade. 

On 21 September 2021, the Army and Space Force announced that the Army&#x27;s Satellite Operations Brigade would be transferring into the new service. While the Space Force, and Air Force before it, had operated the Defense Satellite Communications System and Wideband Global SATCOM satellites, the Army had traditionally operated the payloads. Payload operates were conducted by the 53d Signal Battalion since 2005 when it replaced the 1st Satellite Control Battalion, which conducted the mission from 1995 to 2005. In 2019, just prior to the Space Force&#x27;s establishment, the Army established Task Force Eagle, reassigning the 53d Signal Battalion from the 1st Space Brigade and moving elements from Space and Missile Defense Command&#x27;s G-6 headquarters to consolidate Army satellite communications. Task Force Eagle was renamed the Army Satellite Operations Brigade in 2019. On 15 August 2022, the Army&#x27;s satellite communications mission was officially transferred to the Space Force and assumed by Space Delta 8 and the 53rd Space Operations Squadron, which took its number to honor the 53rd Signal Battalion.

The debate over the transfer of missile warning was extremely contentions, leading to debates on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Space Force, and Air Force Space Command before it, had responsibility for global and national missile warning, while the Army had a small element for regional missile warning. The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) was operated by the Army&#x27;s 1st Space Brigade, receiving, processing and disseminating data from the Space Force&#x27;s missile warning satellites. Following the satellite communications&#x27; transfer, the Army and Space Force began negotiating transferring the missile warning mission. In January 2023, the Space Force announced that the Army agreed to transfer the JTAGS mission to Space Delta 4, fully assuming the mission on 1 October 2023 and activating the 5th Space Warning Squadron.

There are still calls for the Army to follow the Navy in transferring all of its space forces to the Space Force. The Heritage Foundation has called for the wholesale transfer of Army Space and Missile Defense Command to the Space Force. The 100th Missile Defense Brigade operates the Ground Based Interceptor system out of Schriever Space Force Base, Vandenberg Space Force Base, and Fort Greely. Former Air Force space officers have called to move this mission to the Space Force and the Center for Strategic and International Studies included moving missile defense into the Space Force. The Army also continues to maintain a cadre of Functional Area 40 space operations officers, although over 85% indicated they would transfer to the Space Force if able. The Army is also maintaining a downsized 1st Space Brigade, however the RAND Corporation has conducted a study calling for the transfer of the Army&#x27;s space control forces to the Space Force.

The Army has attempted to carve out a role in space operations, with its 2024 Army Space Vision outlining the service&#x27;s space mission as integrating space capabilities and interdicting adversary space capabilities, including counter-satellite communications, counter-surveillance and reconnaissance, and navigation warfare in support of land operations. Responsibility for conducting these operations rest with Army Multi-Domain Task Forces and a new space formation called the Theater Strike Effects Group. However, the Army is no longer looking to develop and deploy its own constellations of satellites.

<doc id="1077450" wikidata="Q924510" url="?curid=1077450" title="G. N. Watson">
<text>George Neville Watson  (31 January 1886 – 2 February 1965) was an English mathematician, who applied complex analysis to the theory of special functions. His collaboration on the 1915 second edition of E. T. Whittaker&#x27;s &quot;A Course of Modern Analysis&quot; (1902) produced the classic &quot;Whittaker and Watson&quot; text. In 1918 he proved a significant result known as Watson&#x27;s lemma, that has many applications in the theory on the asymptotic behaviour of exponential integrals.

==Life==
He was born in Westward Ho! in Devon the son of George Wentworth Watson, a schoolmaster and genealogist, and his wife, Mary Justina Griffith.

He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School in London, as a pupil of F. S. Macaulay. He then studied Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge. There he encountered E. T. Whittaker, though their overlap was only two years.

From 1914 to 1918 he lectured in Mathematics at University College, London. He became Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Birmingham in 1918, replacing Prof R S Heath, and remained in this role until 1951.

He was awarded an honorary MSc Pure Science in 1919 by Birmingham University.

He was President of the London Mathematical Society 1933/35.

He died at Leamington Spa on 2 February 1965.

==Works==
His &quot;Treatise on the theory of Bessel functions&quot; (1922) also became a classic, in particular in regard to the asymptotic expansions of Bessel functions.

He subsequently spent many years on Ramanujan&#x27;s formulae in the area of modular equations, mock theta functions and q-series, and for some time looked after Ramanujan&#x27;s lost notebook.

Ramanujan discovered many more modular equations than all of his mathematical predecessors combined. Watson provided proofs for most of Ramanujan&#x27;s modular equations. Bruce C. Berndt completed the project begun by Watson and Wilson. Much of Berndt&#x27;s book &quot;Ramanujan&#x27;s Notebooks, Part 3&quot; (1998) is based upon the prior work of Watson.

Watson&#x27;s interests included solvable cases of the quintic equation. He introduced Watson&#x27;s quintuple product identity.

==Honours and awards==
In 1919 Watson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1946, he received the Sylvester Medal from the Society. He was president of the London Mathematical Society from 1933 to 1935.

He is sometimes confused with the mathematician G. L. Watson, who worked on quadratic forms, and G. Watson, a statistician.

==Family==

In 1925 he married Elfrida Gwenfil Lane daughter of Thomas Wright Lane.

<text>Events from the year 1914 in Ireland.

== Events ==
* 17 January – Edward Carson inspected a parade of the East Belfast Regiment of the Ulster Volunteers.
* 20 February – The Fethard-on-Sea life-boat capsized on service off the County Wexford coast: nine crew were lost.
* 26 February – , designed as the third and largest , was launched at the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyards in Belfast.
* 1 March – Three outbreaks of foot and mouth disease were confirmed in County Cork.
* 9 March – The British Prime Minister proposed to allow the Ulster counties to hold a vote on whether or not to join a Home Rule parliament in Dublin.
* 20 March – Curragh incident: British Army officers stationed in Ireland at the Curragh Camp resigned their commissions rather than be ordered to resist action by Unionist Ulster Volunteers if the Government of Ireland Act (&quot;Third Home Rule Bill&quot;) was passed in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The government backs down and they are reinstated.
* 2 April – Cumann na mBan, the Irish republican women&#x27;s paramilitary organisation, was formed in Dublin as an auxiliary of the Irish Volunteers.
* 6 April – The second reading of the Home Rule Bill was carried in Westminster.
* 24–25 April – Larne Gun Running: 35,000 rifles and over 3 million rounds of ammunition from a German dealer were landed at Larne, Bangor, and Donaghadee for the Unionist Ulster Volunteers and were quickly distributed around Ulster by motor transport.
* 25 May – the House of Commons of the United Kingdom passed the Government of Ireland Bill.
* 23 June—14 July – the Government of Ireland Bill passed through the House of Lords. It allowed Ulster counties to vote on whether or not they wanted to come under Dublin&#x27;s jurisdiction. Because of the outbreak of war in Europe and later developments in Ireland, the Act was never implemented in its original form and the wishes of Fermanagh and Tyrone were eventually ignored.
* 10 July – The Provisional Government of Ulster met for the first time in the Ulster Hall. It vowed to keep Ulster in trust for the King and the British constitution.
* 21 July – A conference (called on 19 July) was opened at Buckingham Palace by the King. It was hoped that unionists and nationalists attending would break the impasse over Home Rule.
* 24 July – The Buckingham Palace conference ended in failure. Nationalists and Unionists present could not agree in principle or in detail.
* 26 July – Howth gun-running: Former British civil servant and novelist Erskine Childers and his wife Molly sailed into Howth in his yacht and landed 2,500 guns for the nationalist Irish Volunteers from a German dealer. Troops of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, returning to Dublin having been called out to assist police in attempting to prevent the Volunteers from moving the arms to the city, perpetrated the Bachelor&#x27;s Walk massacre, firing on a crowd of protestors at Bachelors Walk, killing three; a fourth man died later from bayonet wounds and more than 30 others were injured.
* 4 August – World War I: Declaration of war by the United Kingdom on the German Empire.
* September – The Ulster Division was formed as a division of the British New Army from Ulster Volunteers.
* 18 September – The Government of Ireland Act (the Home Rule Act) received Royal Assent (although George V had contemplated refusing it) but was postponed (as projected on 30 July) for the duration of World War I by the simultaneous Suspensory Act and in practice never came into effect in its original form.
* 20 September – In a speech at Woodenbridge, County Wicklow, John Redmond called on members of the Irish Volunteers to go &quot;wherever the firing line extends&quot;. The majority did so, fighting in the 10th and 16th (Irish) Division alongside their volunteer counterparts from the 36th (Ulster) Division; the rump Irish Volunteers split off on 24 September.
* 2 October – German spy Carl Hans Lody was arrested at the Great Southern Hotel, Killarney.
* 18 October – The British Royal Navy&#x27;s Grand Fleet took shelter in Lough Swilly while Scapa Flow was secured against submarine attack.
* 27 October – World War I: Royal Navy super-dreadnought battleship (23,400 tons), was sunk off Tory Island, north-west of Ireland, by a minefield laid by the armed German merchant-cruiser &quot;Berlin&quot;.

<text>The Division of North Sydney is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

On 12 September 2024 The Australian Electoral Commission announced that the seat would be abolished at the 2025 Australian federal election.

==History==

The Division of North Sydney was proclaimed in 1900 and was one of the original 75 divisions contested at the first federal election. It originally stretched as far as the Northern Beaches, though much of that area became Warringah in 1922.

Second only to the nearby Division of Wentworth, the Division of North Sydney has the nation&#x27;s second-highest proportion (56.4%) of high-income families.

North Sydney and Wentworth are the only two federation divisions in New South Wales to have never been held by Labor. The Liberal hold on the seat was broken in 1990 by &quot;father of the independents&quot; Ted Mack, who had represented much of the area in state parliament from 1981 to 1988. He held the seat for two terms before retiring at the 1996 election, after two terms, for the same reason he previously chose to resign from state parliament after two terms − to avoid receiving a parliamentary pension.

However, during Mack&#x27;s tenure, North Sydney was always on the stronger side of fairly safe for the Liberals in &quot;traditional&quot; two-party-preferred match-ups with Labor, and it was a foregone conclusion that it would revert to the Liberals once Mack retired. Indeed, when Mack retired in 1996, Joe Hockey reclaimed the seat for the Liberals on a swing large enough to revert the seat to its traditional status as a comfortably safe Liberal seat. Hockey held it easily until 2015, serving as Treasurer from 2013 to 2015 in the Abbott government. After Abbott was ousted as Liberal leader and Prime Minister by Malcolm Turnbull in the September 2015 Liberal leadership spill Hockey moved to the backbench, but six days later he announced his intention to resign from parliament, taking effect from 23 October. The 2015 North Sydney by-election was held on 5 December to elect his replacement.

Trent Zimmerman, a former Hockey staffer, retained the seat for the Liberal Party with 48.2 percent of the primary vote after a larger-than-predicted 12.8 percent swing against the Turnbull Coalition government. That was only the second time in North Sydney since federation that the successful Liberal candidate had not obtained a majority of the primary vote and had to rely on preferences. Zimmerman faced a double-digit primary vote swing − more than triple that of the 2015 Canning by-election − even though Labor did not even contest the seat.

The Liberal two-candidate-preferred vote of 60.2 percent against independent Stephen Ruff compares to the previous election vote of 65.9 percent against Labor. The reduction of 5.7 percent could not be considered a &quot;two-party/candidate preferred swing&quot; − when a major party is absent, preference flows to both major parties does not take place, resulting in asymmetric preference flows.

Zimmerman became the first openly LGBTI member of the House of Representatives. He won the seat in his own right in 2016 and 2019. However, in 2022, he lost over 13 percent of his primary vote amid the Liberals&#x27; collapse in the North Shore and other &quot;blue ribbon&quot; areas of metropolitan Australia, and was defeated by teal independent Kylea Tink, the second non-Liberal ever to win it. The swing against the Liberals was large enough to make the seat marginal in a &quot;traditional&quot; two-party contest between the Liberals and Labor for the first time in 60 years; on paper, the Liberal margin over Labor was only 1.2 percent. 

The most notable member for the seat was Billy Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia from 1915 to 1923, and later a minister in the Lyons, Page, Menzies and Fadden governments. Hughes is the longest-serving parliamentarian in Australian history. He transferred to Bradfield after it was carved out of North Sydney&#x27;s northern portion in 1949, and died as that seat&#x27;s member in 1952. Other notable members include Mack, Hockey, and Dugald Thomson, a minister in the Reid Government.

As part of its periodic review of electoral boundaries, the Australian Electoral Commission abolished the division from the 2025 Australian federal election, with its electors distributed across the divisions of Warringah, Bradfield and Bennelong.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

Located along Sydney&#x27;s Lower North Shore, the division is named after the suburb of North Sydney. It also includes the suburbs of Artarmon, Cammeray, Castlecrag, Crows Nest, Greenwich, Henley, Hunters Hill, Huntleys Cove, Huntleys Point, Kirribilli, Lane Cove, Lane Cove North, Lane Cove West, Lavender Bay, Linley Point, Longueville, McMahons Point, Middle Cove, Milsons Point, Naremburn, North Willoughby, Northbridge, Northwood, Riverview, St Leonards, Waverton, Willoughby, Willoughby East, Wollstonecraft, and Woolwich; as well as parts of Chatswood, Chatswood West, Cremorne, Gladesville, Gore Hill and Neutral Bay.

<doc id="1077465" wikidata="Q387320" url="?curid=1077465" title="Cyclohexa-1,3-diene">
<text>Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is an organic compound with the formula (C2H4)(CH)4. It is a colorless, flammable liquid. Its refractive index is 1.475 (20 °C, D). It is one of two isomers of cyclohexadiene, the other being 1,4-cyclohexadiene.

==Synthesis==
Cyclohexadiene is prepared by the double dehydrobromination of 1,2-dibromocyclohexane:
:(CH2)4(CHBr)2 + 2 NaH → (CH2)2(CH)4 + 2 NaBr + 2 H2

==Reactions==
Useful reactions of this diene are cycloadditions, such as the Diels-Alder reaction.

Conversion of cyclohexa-1,3-diene to benzene + hydrogen is exothermic by about 25 kJ/mol in the gas phase.
:cyclohexane → cyclohexa-1,3-diene + 2 H2 (Δ&quot;H&quot; = +231.5 kJ/mol; endothermic)
:cyclohexane → benzene + 3 H2 (Δ&quot;H&quot; = +205 kJ/mol; endothermic)
:cyclohexa-1,3-diene → benzene + H2 (Δ&quot;H&quot; = -26.5 kJ/mol; exothermic)

Compared with its isomer cyclohexa-1,4-diene, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is about 1.6 kJ/mol more stable.

Cyclohexadiene and its derivatives form (diene)iron tricarbonyl complexes. Illustrative is [(C6H8)Fe(CO)3], an orange liquid. This complex reacts with hydride-abstracting reagents to give the cyclohexadienyl derivative [(C6H7)Fe(CO)3]+. Cyclohexadienes react with ruthenium trichloride to give (Benzene)ruthenium dichloride dimer.

==Occurrence==
Cyclohexa-1,3-diene itself is rare in nature, but the cyclohexa-1,3-diene motif is fairly common. One example is chorismic acid, an intermediate in the shikimic acid pathway. Of the several examples of the terpenoids and terpenes, a prominent example is phellandrene. An unusual derivative is &quot;cis&quot;-1,2-dihydrocatechol.

Coenzyme A-conjugated to the 2-position of cyclohexadiene-2-carboxylic acid is an intermediate in the biodegradation of aromatic carboxylic acids.

<text>Tarrant Hinton is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It is situated in the Tarrant Valley, approximately northeast of Blandford Forum. In 2013 the estimated population of the civil parish was 160.

==History==
The village&#x27;s name appears in medieval sources. In 935, King Æthelstan granted land at Tarrant Hinton to the nuns of Shaftesbury Abbey under condition that they would pray hard for the king.

==Community==

The village no longer has a public house, shop or post office, but it has a medieval parish church and a newly rebuilt village hall. In 2001 the ecclesiastical parish of Tarrant Hinton was grouped with nine other surrounding parishes to form the Chase Benefice in the Anglican Diocese of Salisbury. There is a local church benefice newsletter published regularly called the Tarrant Times.
Tarrant Hinton is well known as the location of the Great Dorset Steam Fair, which is annually visited by some 200,000 people. 
==Governance==
Tarrant Hinton parish falls under the Dorset Council ward of Hill Forts and Upper Tarrants, and the parliamentary constituency of North Dorset. The current MP (since 2015) is Simon Hoare of the Conservative Party.

<doc id="1077474" wikidata="Q3431721" url="?curid=1077474" title="Manjiang dialect">
<text>Manjiang (), also known as Manhua (), is an Eastern Min dialect spoken mainly in Taishun and Cangnan Counties in Wenzhou, as well as parts of Qingyuan County in Lishui, in southeastern Zhejiang province.

As a dialect of Eastern Min, Manjiang is very distant from major Chinese varieties such as Mandarin and Cantonese, and displays very significant elements of a substratal indigenous language, perhaps belonging to the Austroasiatic or Tai–Kadai language families.

<text>K-279 was the first Project 667B &quot;Murena&quot; (also known by the NATO reporting name Delta I) ballistic missile submarine of the Soviet Navy. Development of Project 667B began in 1965. Her keel was laid down in 1971 by Sevmash at the Severodvinsk shipyard. She was launched in January 1972, and commissioned in the Soviet Northern Fleet on 22 December 1972.

The site has been much damaged by ploughing and by the road between Wimborne Minster and Blandford Forum, which crosses the site.

The village&#x27;s parish church has a 15th-century tower, though the rest of the building was rebuilt in 1852 by Thomas Henry Wyatt. The chancel of the earlier building contained an anchorite&#x27;s cell. The Bishop of Salisbury Richard Poore is most likely to have been buried at Tarrant Keyneston in accordance with his wishes.

Almost all of Tarrant Keyneston parish is within the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

<text>The United States Telecom Association (USTelecom) is an organization that represents telecommunications-related businesses based in the United States. As a trade association, it represent the converged interests of the country&#x27;s telecommunications industry. Member companies represent a diverse set of communications-related businesses, including those that provide wireless, Internet, cable television, long distance, local exchange, and voice services. Members include large publicly traded communications carriers as well as small telephone cooperatives that serve only a few hundred customers in urban and rural areas. The organization was founded as the Independent Telephone Association of America in 1897, and represented the telecommunication industry of North America that was not affiliated with the Bell System led by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T).

==History==
The United States Telecom Association (USTelecom) was founded in Chicago, Illinois, on May 17, 1897, when a group of independent telephone company executives convened at the Palmer House to create an organization called the Independent Telephone Association. After the 1894 expiration of Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s principal telephone patent, thousands of independent telephone companies sprouted in the telephone industry in the last decade of the 19th century. These companies organized to promote growth of their industry and develop alliances on issues that crossed state lines. Renamed as the United States Independent Telephone Association in 1915, the organization focused on educational programs for its members, standardization efforts and representing its members on relevant policy issues addressed by the federal government. For instance, as the telephone industry grew, Congress enacted new laws, including the Communications Act of 1934 that established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which among a variety of initiatives, set a universal service goal of connecting all Americans via affordable, accessible telecommunications services. To meet the requirements of the new statutes, telephone companies worked through the association to educate members, develop common policy positions and interface with policymakers in Congress and at the FCC.

In modern times, USTelecom also advocates on behalf of the telecommunications industry to Courts, the White House, and the media.

==Organization and leadership==
As an American not-for-profit corporation, USTelecom is governed by a 19-member Board of Directors and an 18-member Leadership Committee. The Board of Directors is composed of member company executives that have been nominated by members of the Leadership Committee. The Leadership Committee comprises executives from small-to-mid-sized telecom companies that are members of the association. As of October 2023, the Chair is Jason Williams, CEO, Blackfoot Communications, and the Chair of the Leadership Committee is Jennifer Prather, CEO of Totelcom Communications. Since January 2017, Jonathan Spalter has served as President &amp; CEO of USTelecom.

The association offers three different categories of paid membership: 
*Carrier Members - Companies that provide local telecommunications exchange and access services to residential, business and other customers in the United States.
*Supplier Members - Companies that sell goods and services to the telecommunications industry.
*International Members - Companies providing telecommunications services outside the United States and U.S. territories.

USTelecom serves as a forum in which member companies can coordinate advocacy of particular policy issues important to their companies and the telecommunications industry via the association&#x27;s seven standing Committees and other ad hoc Committees.

Standing Committees:
*Regulatory Affairs – Member companies develop policy and engage in advocacy before the FCC and other relevant American federal agencies.
*Governmental Affairs – Member companies collaborate in their advocacy to lawmakers on mutually-beneficial policy issues.
*External Affairs – These committee members develop and execute media and public relations strategies.
*Tax Policy – Members develop the association&#x27;s positions on tax and financial policy relevant to the telecommunications industry.
*Engineering &amp; Technology Policy – Members develop the association&#x27;s position on a variety of technology issues and standards including numbering, IP services, open source software, network neutrality, DPI, and emerging technologies.
*Intellectual Property and Privacy – Members develop the association&#x27;s position on issues surrounding the ownership and distribution of content and protection of consumer information.
*National Security and Public Safety – These committee members gather to inform and shape policies addressing cybersecurity, national security, emergency preparedness, and pandemic planning.

Notable Ad Hoc Committees:
*Universal Service
*Intercarrier compensation
*Consumer protection
*Video competition

==Member education==
Beyond representing member companies&#x27; interests to legislators, the administration, the FCC, and in courts, USTelecom conducts member education programs through webinars, conferences and leadership development programs. Other departments in the association dually support these educational and advocacy programs through the distribution of research briefs and industry-relevant newsletters.

<doc id="1077491" wikidata="Q430880" url="?curid=1077491" title="Collective consciousness">
<text>Collective consciousness, collective conscience, or collective conscious () is the set of shared beliefs, ideas, and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society. In general, it does not refer to the specifically moral conscience, but to a shared understanding of social norms.

The modern concept of what can be considered collective consciousness includes solidarity attitudes, memes, extreme behaviors like group-think and herd behavior, and collectively shared experiences during collective rituals, dance parties, and the discarnate entities which can be experienced from psychedelic use. Rather than existing as separate individuals, people come together as dynamic groups to share resources and knowledge. It has also developed as a way of describing how an entire community comes together to share similar values. This has also been termed &quot;hive mind&quot;, &quot;group mind&quot;, &quot;mass mind&quot;, and &quot;social mind&quot;.

==Historical use of collective consciousness==
The term was introduced by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim in his &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot; in 1893. The French word &quot;conscience&quot; generally means &quot;conscience&quot;, &quot;consciousness&quot;, &quot;awareness&quot;, or &quot;perception&quot;. Given the multiplicity of definitions, translators of Durkheim disagree on which is most appropriate, or whether the translation should depend on the context. Some prefer to treat the word &#x27;conscience&#x27; as an untranslatable foreign word or technical term, without its normal English meaning. As for &quot;collective&quot;, Durkheim makes clear that he is not reifying or hypostasizing this concept; for him, it is &quot;collective&quot; simply in the sense that it is common to many individuals; &quot;cf.&quot; social fact.

Scipio Sighele published ‘La Foule Criminele’ one year before Durkheim, in which he describes emergent characteristics of crowds that don’t appear in the individuals that form the crowd. He doesn’t call this collective consciousness, but ‘âme de la foule’ (soul of the crowd). This term returns in Sigmund Freud’s book about mass psychology and essentially overlaps with Durkheims concept of collective consciousness.

==Theories of collective consciousness==
===Durkheim===
Durkheim used the term in his books &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot; (1893), &quot;The Rules of the Sociological Method&quot; (1895), &quot;Suicide&quot; (1897), and &quot;The Elementary Forms of Religious Life&quot; (1912). In &quot;The Division of Labour&quot;, Durkheim argued that in traditional/primitive societies (those based around clan, family or tribal relationships), totemic religion played an important role in uniting members through the creation of a common consciousness. In societies of this type, the contents of an individual&#x27;s consciousness are largely shared in common with all other members of their society, creating a mechanical solidarity through mutual likeness.

In &quot;Suicide&quot;, Durkheim developed the concept of anomie to refer to the social rather than individual causes of suicide. This relates to the concept of collective consciousness, as if there is a lack of integration or solidarity in society then suicide rates will be higher.

===Gramsci===
Antonio Gramsci states, “A collective consciousness, which is to say a living organism, is formed only after the unification of the multiplicity through friction on the part of the individuals; nor can one say that ‘silence’ is not a multiplicity.” A form of collective consciousness can be formed from Gramsci&#x27;s conception that the presence of a hegemony can mobilize the collective consciousness of those oppressed by the ruling ideas of society, or the ruling hegemony. Collective consciousness can refer to a multitude of different individual forms of consciousness coalescing into a greater whole. In Gramsci&#x27;s view, a unified whole is composed of solidarity among its different constituent parts, and therefore, this whole cannot be uniformly the same. The unified whole can embrace different forms of consciousness (or individual experiences of social reality), which coexist to reflect the different experiences of the marginalized peoples in a given society. This agrees with Gramsci&#x27;s theory of Marxism and class struggle applied to cultural contexts. Cultural Marxism (as distinguished from the right-wing use of the term) embodies the concept of collective consciousness. It incorporates social movements that are based on some sort of collective identity; these identities can include, for instance, gender, sexual orientation, race, and ability, and can be incorporated by collective-based movements into a broader historical material analysis of class struggle.

According to Michelle Filippini, “The nature and workings of collective organisms – not only parties, but also trade unions, associations and intermediate bodies in general – represent a specific sphere of reflection in the Prison Notebooks, particularly in regard to the new relationship between State and society that in Gramsci&#x27;s view emerged during the age of mass politics.” Collective organisms can express collective consciousness. Whether this form of expression finds itself in the realm of the state or the realm of society is up to the direction that the subjects take in expressing their collective consciousness. In Gramsci&#x27;s Prison Notebooks, the ongoing conflict between civil society, the bureaucracy, and the state necessitates the emergence of a collective consciousness that can often act as an intermediary between these different realms. The public organizations of protest, such as labor unions and anti-war organizations, are vehicles that can unite multiple types of collective consciousness. Although identity-based movements are necessary for the progress of democracy and can generate collective consciousness, they cannot completely do so without a unifying framework. This is why anti-war and labor movements provide an avenue that has united various social movements under the banner of a multiple collective consciousness. This is also why future social movements need to have an ethos of collective consciousness if they are to succeed in the long-term.

===Zukerfield===
Zukerfield states that “The different disciplines that have studied knowledge share an understanding of it as a product of human subjects – individual, collective, etc.” Knowledge in a sociological sense is derived from social conditions and social realities. Collective consciousness also reflects social realities, and sociological knowledge can be gained through the adoption of a collective consciousness. Many different disciplines such as philosophy and literature examine collective consciousness from different lenses. These different disciplines reach a similar understanding of a collective consciousness despite their different approaches to the subject. The inherent humanness in the idea of collective consciousness refers to a shared way of thinking among human beings in the pursuit of knowledge.

Collective consciousness can provide an understanding of the relationship between self and society. As Zukerfeld states, “Even though it impels us, as a first customary gesture, to analyse the subjective (such as individual consciousness) or intersubjective bearers (such as the values of a given society), in other words those which Marxism and sociology examine, now we can approach them in an entirely different light.” “Cognitive materialism” is presented in the work by Zukerfeld as a sort of ‘third way’ between sociological knowledge and Marxism. Cognitive materialism is based on a kind of collective consciousness of the mind. This consciousness can be used, with cognitive materialism as a guiding force, by human beings in order to critically analyze society and social conditions.

==Collective consciousness in society==
Society is made up of various collective groups, such as the family, community, organizations, regions, nations which as Burns and Egdahl state &quot;&quot;can be considered to possess agential capabilities&quot;: to think, judge, decide, act, reform; to conceptualize self and others as well as self&#x27;s actions and interactions; and to reflect.&quot;. It is suggested that these different national behaviors vary according to the different collective consciousness between nations. This illustrates that differences in collective consciousness can have practical significance.

According to a theory, the character of collective consciousness depends on the type of mnemonic encoding used within a group (Tsoukalas, 2007). The specific type of encoding used has a predictable influence on the group&#x27;s behavior and collective ideology. Informal groups, that meet infrequently and spontaneously, have a tendency to represent significant aspects of their community as episodic memories. This usually leads to strong social cohesion and solidarity, an indulgent atmosphere, an exclusive ethos and a restriction of social networks. Formal groups, that have scheduled and anonymous meetings, tend to represent significant aspects of their community as semantic memories which usually leads to weak social cohesion and solidarity, a more moderate atmosphere, an inclusive ethos and an expansion of social networks.

===Literary and oral tradition===
In a case study of a Serbian folk story, Wolfgang Ernst examines collective consciousness in terms of forms of media, specifically collective oral and literary traditions. &quot;Current discourse analysis drifts away from the &#x27;culturalist turn&#x27; of the last two or three decades and its concern with individual and collective memory as an extended target of historical research&quot;. There is still a collective consciousness present in terms of the shared appreciation of folk stories and oral traditions. Folk stories enable the subject and the audiences to come together around a common experience and a shared heritage. In the case of the Serbian folk “gusle”, the Serbian people take pride in this musical instrument of epic poetry and oral tradition and play it at social gatherings. Expressions of art and culture are expressions of a collective consciousness or expressions of multiple social realities.

<text>The Royal Small Arms Factory ADEN cannon (ADEN being an acronym for &quot;Armament Development, Enfield&quot;) is a 30 mm revolver cannon used on many military aircraft, particularly those of the British Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm. Developed post-World War II primarily to meet British Air Ministry&#x27;s requirement for increased lethality in aircraft armament, the cannon was fired electrically and is fully automatic once it is loaded.

== Design and development ==
During World War II, the German firm Mauser began development of a radically new 20 mm autocannon using a motorised firing mechanism in order to improve the rate of fire. The weapon was designed for 20mm mine shell rounds (designated the Mauser MG 213 and for 30mm rounds (the Mauser MK 213).
However, production of the MK 213 never commenced due to development problems such as excessive barrel wear, not to mention the Allied Combined Bomber Offensive campaign against German industry. At the end of the war only 5 prototypes (V1 to V5) of either 20 mm MG 213 or 30 mm MK 213 were finished.

In the post-war era, the MK 213 became well known in armament circles, and a number of companies took up development. This included the Armament Development Establishment in the UK and GIAT in France. A common 30×111mm round was developed that offered a dramatic improvement in muzzle velocity from the MK 108&#x27;s 540 m/s to the new design&#x27;s . This was only slightly lower than contemporary 20 mm cannon like the Hispano Mk. V&#x27;s , making the new round suitable for use during dogfights as well as against larger targets. The mechanism improved the rate of fire from the Mk. V&#x27;s 750 rpm to 1,300 rpm, a significant improvement. The new weapon was quickly developed and production was set up at the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield. The name ADEN was created by combining the two first initials of Armament Development Establishment with the first two letters of Enfield, producing ADEN. 

The ADEN cannon entered service on the British Hawker Hunter in 1954, and was subsequently used on every British gun-armed aircraft until the advent of the Panavia Tornado in the 1980s. The last version to see production was the Mk. 4. An improved version, the Mk. 5, incorporates a multitude of small changes to improve reliability and increase rate of fire to 1,500–1,700 rounds per minute. No new Mk 5s were built, but many older weapons were converted, being redesignated &quot;Mk 5 Straden&quot;.

GIAT also introduced their version of the design as the DEFA cannon; the two weapons are very similar.

=== ADEN 25 ===

The ADEN Mk 5 became the basis for the planned ADEN 25, which was to be a somewhat larger weapon at long and weighing firing the new range of 25x137mm NATO STANAG 4173 ammunition (as developed for M242 Bushmaster) at a much higher muzzle velocity of . The lighter ammunition was also to produce a higher rate of fire, 1,650 to 1,850 rounds per minute. 
The ADEN 25 was selected for British Harrier GR.5 aircraft. After initial weight issues and persistent problems integrating the cannon with the pod, and the pod with the Harrier GR.5 aircraft, the MoD considered the cost of fixing the problems excessive, and the project was cancelled in 1999. Harrier GR.7 was cleared for emergency use of the ADEN 25. No attempt apparently having been made to retrofit the older ADEN 30 mm pods. Fleet Air Arm BAE Sea Harriers retained the 30 mm weapon until their retirement in 2006.

<text>Somitogenesis is the process by which somites form. Somites are bilaterally paired blocks of paraxial mesoderm that form along the anterior-posterior axis of the developing embryo in segmented animals. In vertebrates, somites give rise to skeletal muscle, cartilage, tendons, endothelium, and dermis.

==Overview==

In somitogenesis, somites form from the paraxial mesoderm, a particular region of mesoderm in the neurulating embryo. This tissue undergoes convergent extension as the primitive streak regresses, or as the embryo gastrulates. The notochord extends from the base of the head to the tail; with it extend thick bands of paraxial mesoderm.

As the primitive streak continues to regress, somites form from the paraxial mesoderm by &quot;budding off&quot; rostrally as somitomeres, or whorls of paraxial mesoderm cells, compact and separate into discrete bodies. The periodic nature of these splitting events has led many to say to that somitogenesis occurs via a clock-wavefront model, in which waves of developmental signals cause the periodic formation of new somites.

These immature somites then are compacted into an outer layer (the epithelium) and an inner mass (the mesenchyme).

The somites themselves are specified according to their location, as the segmental paraxial mesoderm from which they form it itself determined by position along the anterior-posterior axis before somitogenesis.

The cells within each somite are specified based on their location within the somite. In addition, they retain the ability to become any kind of somite-derived structure until relatively late in the process of somitogenesis.

==Signaling==

===Periodicity===

Once the cells of the pre-somitic mesoderm are in place following cell migration during gastrulation, oscillatory expression of many genes begins in these cells as if regulated by a developmental &quot;clock.&quot; As mentioned previously, this has led many to conclude that somitogenesis is coordinated by a &quot;clock and wave&quot; mechanism.

In technical terms, this means that somitogenesis occurs due to the largely cell-autonomous oscillations of a network of genes and gene products, which causes cells to oscillate between a permissive and a non-permissive state in a consistently timed-fashion, like a clock. These genes include members of the FGF family, Wnt and Notch pathway, as well as targets of these pathways. The wavefront progress slowly in a posterior-to-anterior direction. As the wavefront of signaling comes in contact with cells in the permissive state, they undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition and pinch off from the more posterior pre-somitic mesoderm, forming a somite boundary and resetting the process for the next somite.

In particular, the cyclic activation of the Notch pathway appears to be of great importance in the wavefront-clock model. It has been suggested that the activation of Notch cyclically activates a cascade of genes necessary for the somites to separate from the main paraxial body. This is controlled by different means in different species, such as through a simple negative feedback loop in zebrafish or in a complicated process in which FGF and Wnt clocks affect the Notch clock, as in chicks and mice. However, the segmentation clock model is highly evolutionarily conserved.

Intrinsic expression of &quot;clock genes&quot; must oscillate with a periodicity equal to the time necessary for one somite to form, for example 30 minutes in zebrafish, 90 minutes in chicks, and 100 minutes in snakes.

Gene oscillation in presomitic cells is largely, but not completely, cell-autonomous. When Notch signaling is disrupted in zebrafish, neighboring cells no longer oscillate synchronously, indicating that Notch signaling is important for keeping neighboring populations of cells synchronous. In addition, some cellular inter-dependency has been displayed in studies concerning the protein Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in somitogenesis. Although expression of Shh pathway proteins has not been reported to oscillate in the pre-somitic mesoderm, they are expressed within the pre-somitic mesoderm during somitogenesis. When the notochord is ablated during somitogenesis in the chick embryo, the proper number of somites forms, but the segmentation clock is delayed for the posterior two-thirds of the somites. The anterior somites are not affected. In one study, this phenotype was mimicked by Shh inhibitors, and timely somite formation was rescued by exogenous Shh protein, showing that the missing signal produced by the notochord is mediated by Shh.

===Signaling in separation and epithelialization of somites===

The physical separation of somites depends on the pulling of cells away from each other and the formation of borders and new adhesions between different cells. Studies indicate the importance of pathways involving Eph receptor and the Ephrin family of proteins, which coordinate border formation, in this process. Also, fibronectins and cadherins help the appropriate cells localize with each other.

===Specification and differentiation===

Regarding the paraxial mesoderm from which somites form, fate mapping experiments at the blastula stage show pre-somitic mesoderm progenitors at the site of gastrulation, referred to as the primitive streak in some organisms, in regions flanking the organizer. Transplant experiments show that only at the late gastrula stage are these cells committed to the paraxial fate, meaning that fate determination is tightly controlled by local signals and is not predetermined. For instance, exposure of pre-somitic mesoderm to Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) ventralizes the tissue, however &quot;in vivo&quot;, BMP antagonists secreted by the organizer (such as Noggin and chordin) prevent this and thus promote the formation of dorsal structures.

==Termination of somitogenesis==

It is currently unknown by what particular mechanism somitogenesis is terminated. One proposed mechanism is massive cell death in the posteriormost cells of the paraxial mesoderm so that this region is prevented from forming somites. Others have suggested that the inhibition of BMP signaling by Noggin, a Wnt target gene, suppresses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition necessary for the splitting off of somites from the bands of pre-somitic mesoderm and thus terminates somitogenesis. Although endogenous retinoic acid is required in higher vertebrates to limit the caudal Fgf8 domain needed for somitogenesis in the trunk (but not tail), some studies also point to a possible role of retinoic acid in ending somitogenesis in vertebrates that lack a tail (human) or have a short tail (chick). Other studies suggest termination may be due to an imbalance between the speed of somite formation and growth of the pre-somitic mesoderm extending into this tail region.

==Somitogenesis in different species==

Different species have different numbers of somites. For example, frogs have approximately 10, humans have 37, chicks have 50, mice have 65, and snakes have more than 300, up to about 500.

Somite number is unaffected by changes in the size of the embryo through experimental procedure. Because all developing embryos of a particular species form the same number of somites, the number of somites present is typically used as a reference for age in developing vertebrates.

<text>Tarrant Monkton is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England, situated in the Tarrant Valley about east-northeast of Blandford Forum. Within the parish boundary, over hills to the west, lies the major part of Blandford Camp army base (including the Royal Signals Museum). In the 2011 census the parish—including the army base—had a population of 1,986. The village is centred on the All Saints Parish Church, opposite which is the Langton Arms, a public house and restaurant.

==History==

Evidence of prehistoric human activity within the parish includes three round barrows, traces of a possible Iron Age or Romano-British settlement, a dyke on the SW edge of the army camp and a linear dyke on Luton Down. The barrows previously numbered thirteen; ten others were destroyed after the construction of the army camp in 1914. The Roman road between Badbury Rings and Bath also passed through the parish.

In 1086 in the Domesday Book Tarrant Monkton was recorded as &quot;Tarente&quot;, and by 1280 it was &quot;Tarent Moneketon&quot;, the latter part of the name – derived from the Old English &quot;manne&quot; and &quot;tan&quot; – referring to ownership by the monks of Tewkesbury Abbey. The Domesday entry states that &quot;Tarente&quot; had 28 households, 8 ploughlands, of meadow and one mill. It was in Pimperne Hundred and the lord and tenant-in-chief was Cranborne Abbey.

In the village the River Tarrant is crossed by a packhorse bridge that probably dates from the 17th century. The bridge was part of an old route between Blandford Forum and Moor Crichel.

The Tarrant Valley was agriculturally prosperous in the early 19th century due to high wheat prices and low labour costs. Wealthy farming squires built large farmhouses that survive to this day, though their workers often lived in mud-walled cottages that, according to Dorset-born broadcaster and agriculturist Ralph Wightman, &quot;were no more improvable than old pigsties&quot;, and these generally have not survived.

Until the end of the 19th century the neighbouring parish of Tarrant Launceston was part of Tarrant Monkton parish. All Saints parish church is built of flint and ashlar and has a chancel dating from around 1400, and a 15th-century nave and west tower, though the building was substantially altered in the 18th century and in 1873.

==Governance==

Tarrant Monkton parish—including the army base—is in The Lower Tarrants electoral ward, which also extends south to Tarrant Keyneston. The ward had a population of 3,302 in the 2011 census and is part of the constituency of North Dorset, which is currently represented in the UK parliament by the Conservative Simon Hoare.

==Geography==

Measured directly, Tarrant Monkton village is about ENE of Blandford Forum, SE of Shaftesbury and NNW of Poole. The parish, which covers just over , is based on chalk, at an elevation of about . All of the parish is within the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

==Demography==

In the 2011 census Tarrant Monkton civil parish had 417 dwellings, 400 households and a population of 1,986. 1.8% of residents were age 65 or over (compared to 16.4% for England as a whole).

==Amenities==

Tarrant Monkton has a public house called The Langton Arms and a village hall, which hosts events organised by the Village Hall Committee and is also available for hire.

<text>Johannes Theodor Baargeld was a pseudonym of Alfred Emanuel Ferdinand Grünwald (9 October 1892 – 16 or 17 August 1927), a German painter and poet who, together with Max Ernst, founded the Cologne Dada group. He also used the name Zentrodada in connection with Dada.

Baargeld was born in Stettin (Szczecin), Prussian Pomerania. He studied jurisprudence at Oxford and Bonn. Baargeld was the editor of the periodical &quot;The Fan&quot; (&quot;Der Ventilator&quot;) which Ernst and Hans Arp started in 1919, and he collaborated on many other Dadaist publications such as &quot;Bulletin D&quot; and &quot;Dada W/3&quot;.

==Military service==
When war broke out in 1914, Baargeld enlisted and served as a reserve lieutenant for three years.

==Literary career==
After serving in the army, Baargeld began his literary career in 1917 by writing for Pfemfert&#x27;s journal &quot;Die Aktion&quot;. His contributions were mostly lyrical and political works. A year after he began writing for &quot;Die Aktion&quot;, Baargeld joined the Independent Socialist Party of Germany (USPD). 
Before establishing Dada, Baargeld had been the patron of a leftist periodical, &quot;Der Ventilator&quot;. The journal was the political and artistic means through which the would-be members of Dada, such as Angelika and Heinrich Hoerle, published satirical works. 
==Painting==
Baargeld also collaborated with Max Ernst on some of the collages used in Ernst&#x27;s Fatagaga series.

Baargeld gave up painting in 1921 and in 1927 died in an avalanche while climbing Aiguille de Bionnassay in the French Alps.

<doc id="1077521" wikidata="Q194164" url="?curid=1077521" title="Krujë">
<text>Krujë (; see also the etymology section) is a town and a municipality in north-central Albania. Located between Mount Krujë and the Ishëm River, the city is 20 km north of the capital of Albania, Tirana.

Krujë was inhabited by the ancient Illyrian tribe of the Albani. In 1190 Krujë became the capital of the first Albanian state in the Middle Ages, the Principality of Arbër. Later it was the capital of the Kingdom of Albania, while in the early 15th century Krujë was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, but then recaptured in 1443 by Skanderbeg, leader of the League of Lezhë, who successfully defended it against three Ottoman sieges until his death in 1468.

The Ottomans took control of the town after the fourth siege in 1478, and incorporated it in their territories. A 1906 local revolt against the Ottoman Empire was followed by the 1912 Declaration of Independence of Albania. In the mid-1910s Krujë was one of the battlefields of the conflict between the short-lived Republic of Central Albania, founded by Essad Toptani, and the Principality of Albania. In 1914 Toptani managed to seize the town but during the same year it was reincorporated by Prênk Bibë Doda in the Principality of Albania. During World War II it was the centre of the activities of resistance leader Abaz Kupi.

The museums of Krujë include the Skanderbeg Museum, located in the environs of the Krujë Castle, and the national ethnographic museum.

== Etymology ==

The name of the city is related to the Albanian word &quot;kroi&quot;, &quot;krua&quot;, meaning &quot;fountain&quot; or &quot;water source&quot;, from Proto-Albanian &quot;* krana&quot; &lt; &quot;* krasna&quot;.

The city was attested for the first time as &quot;Kroai&quot; (in Medieval Greek Κροαί) in Byzantine documents of the early 9th century. In medieval Latin it was known as &quot;Croia&quot;, &quot;Croya&quot; and &quot;Croarum&quot;. During the Ottoman era it was also known as &quot;Ak Hisar&quot; or &quot;Akçahisar&quot; from the Turkish words &quot;ak&quot; (white) and &quot;hisar&quot; (castle).

== History ==
=== Early history ===

In ancient times the region of Krujë was inhabited by the Illyrian tribe of the Albani, while the town is located near the Iron Age Illyrian site of Zgërdhesh. Some scholars have identified the site with the main settlement of the Albani, Albanopolis, while others identified Albanopolis with Krujë itself. During the Illyrian Wars the area of Krujë was captured by the Roman Republic.
Early medieval artifacts of Krujë include dress items and weaponry found in fifth- and sixth-century cemeteries, which display the high status and the wealth of the burials. Originally a middle-sized fortress like other urban centers, Krujë expanded to a town probably from the sixth to the ninth century AD. In 1190 Krujë became the capital of the first Albanian state of the Middle Ages, the Principality of Arbër founded by Progon of the House of Progon. During the reign of Gulam of Albania the principality was dissolved and incorporated in the newly founded Kingdom of Albania. The Kingdom of Albania was eventually dissolved between 1363 and 1368, when Karl Topia captured its capital Durrës and incorporated its territories, including Krujë in 1363 in the Princedom of Albania. After 1389 the House of Thopia gradually lost control of the town, which by 1395 had come under Ottoman vassalage. The Ottomans lost control of Krujë in the early 15th century, when it was captured by Niketa Thopia and regained it in 1415. After its recapture it was incorporated in the Sanjak of Albania and formed an administrative unit with the status of Subaşilik as attested in the regional register of 1431. During the Albanian Revolt of 1432–1436 the city was unsuccessfully besieged by Andrea Thopia.

Until 1432, the subaşi (governor) of Krujë had been Zagan Bey, then Hizir Bey, and later during 1437—1438 Skanderbeg was its governor. In November 1438 Hizir Bey was again appointed as subaşi of Krujë until he was replaced in April 1440 by Umur Bey. On 28 November 1443 Skanderbeg gained control over Krujë by deceiving its subaşi with forged sultan&#x27;s letter, and raised the first Albanian flag on the same day. In 1444 Skanderbeg incorporated it in the League of Lezhë, the confederation of the Albanian principalities. From 1450 until 1477 Krujë was defended successfully by the Albanian troops four times against the Ottoman army, which eventually captured it in 1478 during the fourth Siege of the city. During the first siege of Krujë in 1450, the 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers of the League of Lezhë under Vrana Konti and Skanderbeg defeated an Ottoman force of about 100,000 men led by Sultan Murad II, who had tried to bribe Konti to surrender the castle of the town. In the following decade Krujë was first besieged in 1466 and then in 1467 unsuccessfully by Ballaban Pasha and Sultan Mehmed II, whose total troops were about 150,000. After Skanderbeg&#x27;s death in 1468, the city&#x27;s garrison was supplemented by troops of the Republic of Venice. In 1476 the town was once more besieged by a ten-thousand-man army under Gedik Ahmed Pasha; however, the local garrison led by proveditor Pietro Vetturi fended off the Ottoman besiegers, who retreated after the arrival of reinforcements under Francesco Contarini and Nikollë Dukagjini. The city was eventually conquered by the Ottomans in 1478 after being besieged for over a year. This success was viewed by the Ottomans as a good omen that the siege of Shkodra would also be successful.

=== Modern history ===
During the rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire Krujë became the battlefield of various anti-Ottoman rebellions also related with the imposition of new taxes. In 1906 the people of Krujë revolted once more against the Ottoman Empire. The Wāli of Shkodër, Sali Zeki Pasha sent four battalions of the Ottoman army stationed in the city against the rebels of Krujë. After prolonged confrontations the Ottoman officials offered to begin negotiations with the rebels. On 20 September 1906 the leaders of Krujë and the Ottoman diplomats met at the Tallajbe quarter of Krujë to discuss the administrative status of the town, however, the Ottoman army under Şemsi Pasha ambushed the rebel leaders. During the battle that followed, which became known in history after the Tallajbe district, about 30 people died including uninvolved civilians.
Throughout the Albanian Revolt of 1912, that led to the creation of the Albanian Vilayet and later in the Declaration of Independence of Albania Krujë, which was captured on 14 August, was one of the major anti-Ottoman centers. In 1914 Essad Toptani, a member of the notable Toptani family of the region and officer of the Ottoman army, captured the town and incorporated it in the Republic of Central Albania making it a center of his movement, but in June of the same year it was reincorporated by Prênk Bibë Doda in the Principality of Albania. On 20 December 1914 the local anti-Essadists, led by Abdi Toptani and Mehmet Gjinali, formed the Union of Krujë, which quickly extended its authority in central Albania.

Following the Italian invasion of Albania the country became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. Mustafa Merlika-Kruja, a native of Krujë, who became the Prime Minister of the new regime ordered the formation of a 300-man gendarmerie force to defend the town against resistance groups. However, soon afterward, resistance leader Abaz Kupi, another native of the town, created one of the first permanent resistance forces of Albania in Krujë and gradually took control of the region. In 1943 at the assembly of Tapizë Balli Kombëtar proposed to the LNÇ the creation of provisional resistance government, with Krujë as the capital city, but this proposal was rejected by the LNÇ leaders. In the end of November 1944, the last German troops stationed in the area were defeated and LNÇ battalions entered the town.

== Geography ==
Krujë is found at an altitude of 600 m (1,969 ft) on the foot of Mount Krujë (), while south and west of the town is found the plain of the Ishëm River. The town is located in the northern part of the outer Albanides tectonic unit, which consists of anticlines of Mesozoic carbonate platforms. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Krujë, but it also includes the villages of Barkanesh, Brre and Picerragë. The closest cities to Krujë are Tirana and Durrës at a distance of 20 and 37 km respectively.

The municipality was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities Bubq, Cudhi, Fushë-Krujë, Krujë, Nikël and Kodër-Thumanë, that became municipal units. The seat of the municipality is the town Krujë.

The current mayor of Krujë is Artur Bushi, who was elected in the 2015 local elections as a candidate of the Socialist Party of Albania.

=== Climate ===
Krujë has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm summers, cool winters, and abundant precipitation.
== Demography ==
The total population of Krujë is 51,191 as of the 2023 census, in a total area of 339.20 km2. The population of the municipal unit is 8,921.

In 1922 the Director General of Health Services appointed the first director of health services in Krujë, Ihsan Korça while the last to hold the post before the establishment of the Socialist People&#x27;s Republic of Albania was Abdulla Mehmeti. The first hospital and the first polyclinic of Krujë were built in 1946 and 1948 respectively. During 1968–69 a new medical laboratory and a department of surgery were added and expanded. In 1970 the Directorate of Hygiene and Epidemiology of the district was established in the town. In 1977-9 a new hospital and polyclinic were built, while in 1986 the first Obstetrics and gynaecology hospital of the town was opened. In 2008 the first hospital was rebuilt and renamed after its first director Stefan Gjoni.

== Culture ==
=== Religion ===
In antiquity Krujë was a site used for pagan rituals, while after the spread of Christianity a church dedicated to Saint Alexander was built near Mount Krujë. In the late 9th century David of Krujë is mentioned as one of the bishops, who participated in the Fourth Council of Constantinople. In the early 10th century Krujë had an Eastern Orthodox suffragan bishop, subject to the metropolitan bishop of Durrës. The Roman Catholic bishopric of Krujë was established in 1167, when its bishop was consecrated by Pope Alexander III. In 1284 the Byzantine Empire expelled the Catholic bishop of Krujë, while after Stefan Uroš II Milutin captured the town, he also expelled the Catholic bishop Andreas Croensis in 1317.

In &quot;Illyricum Sacrum&quot; Daniele Farlati documented fourteen Catholics bishops of the town from 1286 to 1694, while Konrad Eubel documented four additional bishops. Bektashism was introduced in the region of Krujë in the early 18th century. During the Ottoman era a tekke dedicated to the Bektashi saint Sari Saltik was built near the church of Saint Alexander. In 1789–99 the Dollma tekke was built by the Dollma family near the castle. In 1807 Sheikh Mimi, sent by Ali Pasha to Krujë founded another tekke in the town. However, Sheikh Mimi was executed by Kaplan Pasha, who destroyed the tekke, which was restored by Baba Husayn of Dibër in the mid-19th century. In the early 20th century, Hasluck wrote that the population of Krujë (&quot;Croia&quot;) appeared to be almost entirely Bektashi.

=== Museums ===
The museums of Krujë include the Skanderbeg Museum and the national ethnographic museum. The Skanderbeg Museum, founded in 1982, was built in the environs of the Krujë Castle. Its collection includes mostly 15th century artefacts related to the Albanian-Ottoman wars, during which the castle was besieged four times by the Ottoman army. The national ethnographic museum of Krujë was founded in 1989 and is located in a 15–6-room villa of the Toptani family built in 1764. The main exhibits of the museum are objects of artisanship, whose age varies from 60 to 500 years.

=== Sports ===

Krujë&#x27;s most important football club is KS Kastrioti, founded in 1926 and briefly renamed as &quot;Puna Krujë&quot; in 1951. The club&#x27;s home ground is Kastrioti Stadium, which has a capacity of 8,500 people.

<doc id="1077528" wikidata="Q618760" url="?curid=1077528" title="Cash cow">
<text>A cash cow is a product or service that generates significant revenue over a long period of time for the company that sells it. They also generate more cash than they consume. Revenue “milked” from cash cows is often used to subsidise less profitable parts of a business.

The term cash cow is a metaphor for a dairy cow used on farms to produce milk, offering a steady stream of income with little maintenance.

Cash cows are products or services that have achieved market leader status, provide positive cash flows and a return on assets (ROA) that exceeds the market growth rate. The idea is that such products produce profits long after the initial investment has been recouped. By generating steady streams of income, cash cows help fund the overall growth of a company, their positive effects spilling over to other business units. Furthermore, companies can use them as leverage for future expansions, as lenders are more willing to lend money knowing that the debt will be serviced.

Cash cows can be also used to buy back shares already on the market or increase the dividends paid to shareholders. They usually bring in cash for years, until new technology or shifting market preferences renders them obsolete.

== Disadvantages ==
Cash cows can act as barriers to entry to the market for new products, as entrants need to invest heavily in order to achieve the brand awareness required to capture a significant share of the market away from the dominant players.
A higher pay out rate of earning in the form of share repurchase or cash/share dividend might also increase the risk of future dividend cut and is an indication of lack of growth opportunity.

Since the business unit can maintain profits with little maintenance or investment, a cash cow can also be used to describe a profitable but complacent company or business unit.

In his book &quot;The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, Clayton M. Christensen argues that listening to existing customers&#x27; concerns can prevent a highly successful business from innovating, resulting in smaller competitors eventually producing disruptive innovations. This sentiment is expressed in the business aphorism &quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses&quot;, which is misattributed to Henry Ford, a pioneering manufacturer of the automobile.

== Example cash cows==
Successful products that satisfy the criteria for cash cows include: 

* Amazon Web Services generates revenue which is used to subsidise the less profitable business of online shopping at Amazon
* Apple Inc&#x27;s iPhone lines
* The higher education sector is often reliant on international students as a cash cow to subsidise research, management, administration and teaching of home students.
* Private Market Assets can serve as a cash cow for investors.

<doc id="1077543" wikidata="Q5463186" url="?curid=1077543" title="Fly Like an Eagle (album)">
<text>Fly Like an Eagle is the ninth studio album by American rock band Steve Miller Band, released on May 14, 1976, by Capitol Records in the United States, Canada and Japan and Mercury Records in Europe. The album was a commercial success, spawning three hit singles: the title track, &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; and &quot;Rock&#x27;n Me&quot;, and eventually received a quadruple platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 

&quot;Fly Like an Eagle&quot; was voted number 400 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2012, the album was ranked number 445 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time.&quot; It remains a staple of rock, and its singles remain in constant rotation on classic rock radio stations in the United States and worldwide.

On the album&#x27;s cover, Miller is posing with a black left-handed Fender Stratocaster that Jimi Hendrix had originally ordered, but Miller ended up claiming it from Manny&#x27;s Music and re-strung it right-handed, as Hendrix had died after it was ordered. However, the guitar was stolen after the album&#x27;s release.

== Critical reception ==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine in a retrospective review for AllMusic felt that &quot;the focus brings about his strongest set of songs (both originals and covers), plus a detailed atmospheric production where everything fits.&quot; However, he said that &quot;it still can sound fairly dated&quot;, but concluded the review by saying that &quot;its best moments [...] are classics of the idiom.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; voted it 1976&#x27;s Best Album. Jay Cridlin of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; described &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; as &quot;the best John Denver song John Denver never recorded&quot;.

== Track listing ==


* Contains a brief sample from Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s comedy routine &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot; (from &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Wedding Album&quot;, 1974), inserted after the first verse. The sample includes the words &quot;...c&#x27;mon, don&#x27;t be nervous!&quot;

On the U.K. original vinyl release &quot;Space Intro&quot; does not appear on track listing. A 40-second track called &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; segues into &quot;Wild Mountain Honey&quot;.

== 30th anniversary edition ==

In 2006 the album was re-released to celebrate its 30th anniversary. The CD is digitally remastered and includes three bonus tracks and a bonus DVD features a concert performance at Mountain View, California&#x27;s Shoreline Amphitheatre in 2005 with over two hours of music in 5.1 Surround Sound (Note this surround mix is not based on the QUAD mix as track 1 and 6 are not different from the standard releases).

<text>HCSA - the hospital doctors&#x27; union (Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association) is a nationally recognised professional association and trade union in the UK dedicated solely to hospital consultants, specialty doctors and core/specialty hospital doctors in training and Foundation grades (&quot;junior doctors&quot;), originally established in 1948 as the Regional Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association.

Medical Students can also join as associates.

It was granted national collective bargaining rights for all grades of hospital doctors in England by NHS Employers on 22 December 2016. This is the first time any trade union for doctors other than the British Medical Association has been nationally recognised by the NHS.

In 1974 the association&#x27;s rules were amended to extend membership rights to all senior hospital doctors, and its members voted for a new name, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, to reflect this change.

HCSA has been affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) since 1979. It is also affiliated to the General Federation of Trade Unions (UK).

The association has admitted hospital specialty doctors in training (&quot;junior doctors&quot;) since a rule change announced on 1 May 2013.

On 28 April 2017 members voted for a rule change that extended membership further to encompass all post-graduate hospital doctors, including Foundation grades for the first time.

On 25 June 2013 HCSA attended is first meeting of the NHS Staff Council, a body containing representatives of staff-side unions and NHS employers.

In April 2018, the HCSA AGM endorsed Dr Claudia Paoloni as President-elect. When she took up her post in 2019 she became the first ever woman President in the association&#x27;s history.

The association publishes a bi-monthly magazine for members, Hospital Consultant &amp; Specialist.

==Organisational structure==
Every four years HCSA members elect members to the ruling Council, with representation based on relevant Constituencies as determined by the Council, which meets every six months. Currently there are 13 geographical constituencies, each with the right to elect up to four representatives to the Council. Day-to-day decisions are made by a standing committee, known as the Executive, which meets regularly and is drawn from Council members who are appointed to National Officer roles.

The Executive&#x27;s current membership comprises:
* President Dr Naru Narayanan, FRCOG
* Chair of the Executive Dr Bernhard Heidemann, FRCA
* Immediate Past President Dr Claudia Paoloni, FRCA
* Honorary Treasurer Dr Patrick McGowan, FRCA
* Honorary Secretary Dr Sarah Tennant
* Honorary Secretary Dr Emma Cox
* Honorary Secretary Mr Harish Parmar, FRCS
* Honorary Secretary Dr John West, MD FRCP
* Independent Healthcare Matters Mr Christopher Khoo, FRCS
In addition, HCSA is represented at the TUC and within the NHS Staff Council by its general secretary:

* General Secretary Dr Paul Donaldson

==2014-15 NHS pay dispute==
On 28 July 2014 a consultative ballot of HCSA members was announced over the government&#x27;s decision to ignore a Review Body on Doctors&#x27; and Dentists&#x27; Remuneration (DDRB) recommendation of a 1 per cent pay rise for all NHS staff.

An extraordinary meeting of the HCSA executive met to consider the results of the ballot, which closed on 18 August 2014, after 80 per cent of those voting backed some form of industrial action. The executive subsequently voted to hold a formal ballot on industrial action.

In the wake of the consultative ballot results HCSA President Professor John Schofield said: &quot;&quot;Doctors have only very rarely indicated any willingness to undertake industrial action, and it demonstrates the strength of feeling within our profession. We will continue to listen to our members and represent their views to NHS Employers. I hope that we can encourage further dialogue between the government, employers and unions to avoid the possibility of action.”&quot;

HCSA members mounted industrial action in the form of &quot;work to rule&quot; alongside other health unions in October 2014.

==2015 Consultants&#x27; Contract==
On 16 July 2015 the DDRB published its recommendations following an independent review of the Consultants&#x27; Contract and the Doctors in Training Contract.

In the wake of the report, on 30 July 2015, HCSA stated its position In Favour of A Safe Seven-Day Service, highlighting the need for the principles of safety, fairness and work-life balance to be maintained in any changes.

==2015 Junior Doctors Dispute==
On 5 October 2015, then HCSA General Secretary Eddie Saville set out the association&#x27;s position calling for A Fair Deal for Doctors In Training.

Explaining the HCSA position, he said: &quot;As with our position on the consultant aspect of the DDRB proposals currently being pursued by the government and employers, this stance is guided by the principle that any successful outcome must balance safety, fairness and work-life balance. It must also meet the recruitment and retention test needed to ensure that the health service remains properly staffed. What&#x27;s more any attempt to impose contractual changes on doctors in training is completely unacceptable, flying in the face of the basic tenets of trade unionism - that negotiation not imposition is the way to bring about a positive outcome that delivers for trainee doctors, patients and the health service as a whole.&quot;

<text>Video for Windows was a suite of video-playing and editing software introduced by Microsoft in 1992. A runtime version for viewing videos only was made available as a free add-on to Windows 3.1, which then became an integral component of Windows 95. Video for Windows was mostly replaced by the July 1996 release of ActiveMovie, later known as DirectShow.

==Overview==
Video for Windows was first introduced in November 1992. It was developed as a reaction to Apple Computer&#x27;s QuickTime technology, which added digital video to the Macintosh platform. Costing around $200, the product included editing and encoding programs for use with video input boards. A runtime version for viewing videos only was also made available as a free add-on to Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11; it then became an integral component of Windows 95 and later.

Like QuickTime, Video for Windows had three key aspects: Audio Video Interleave (AVI), a container file format designed to store digital video; an application programming interface (API) that allowed software developers to play or manipulate digital video in their own applications; a suite of software for playing and editing digital video. VfW software suite consisted of:
*Media Player
*VidCap
*VidEdit
*BitEdit
*PalEdit
*WaveEdit

The original version was limited to a maximum resolution of 320 pixels by 240 pixels and a maximum image rate of 30 frames per second.

Video for Windows was mostly replaced by the July 1996 release of ActiveMovie, later known as DirectShow. It was first released as a beta version along with the second beta of Internet Explorer 3. ActiveMovie was released as a free download, either standalone or bundled with Internet Explorer. ActiveMovie, however, did not support video capture. Video for Windows was still used for video capture until the release of Windows Driver Model capture drivers, which only started to become popular in 2000.

Video for Windows became an issue in a lawsuit Apple filed in December 1994 against San Francisco Canyon Company and in 1995 against Microsoft and Intel alleging theft of several thousand lines of QuickTime source code to improve the performance of Video for Windows. This lawsuit was ultimately settled in 1997, when Apple agreed to make Internet Explorer the default browser over Netscape; in exchange, Microsoft agreed to continue developing Microsoft Office and other software for Mac OS for the next 5 years, and purchase $150 million of non-voting Apple stock.

In March 1997, Microsoft announced that ActiveMovie would become part of DirectX 5, and around July started referring to it as DirectShow.

<doc id="1077556" wikidata="Q3286599" url="?curid=1077556" title="Business as Usual (Men at Work album)">
<text>Business as Usual is the debut studio album by Australian new wave band Men at Work, which was released in November 1981 in Australia, and April 1982 in the United States. It spent nine weeks at the top of the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart from December 1981 through to March 1982. The Australian version had a black and white cover design; overseas releases had a similar design, but in a black and yellow colour scheme. &quot;Business as Usual&quot; was one of the most successful albums internationally by an Australian group. It spent an unprecedented 15 weeks at No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 from late 1982 to early 1983; and five weeks at No. 1 in the United Kingdom Albums Chart in early 1983. &quot;Business as Usual&quot; was also one of the highest selling Australian albums in the early 1980s, with 6 million copies shipped in the US.

In February 2010, a Federal Court judge in Sydney found that the flute riff from &quot;Down Under&quot; had been plagiarised from the Australian song &quot;Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree&quot;, written in 1932 by Marion Sinclair. The Federal Court determined that the copyright was still current (Sinclair died in 1988) and had been assigned to Larrikin Music. The judge found that &quot;a substantial amount of the original song&quot; had been reproduced in &quot;Down Under&quot;. Larrikin Music had suggested 60% of the royalties would be appropriate compensation, but the court decreed they shall receive only 5%, and only on mechanical rights for the song since 2002, and on future profits.

In October 2010, &quot;Business as Usual&quot; was listed in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

== Background ==
By early 1981, Australian new wave group Men at Work consisted of Greg Ham on flute, saxophone, keyboards and vocals; Colin Hay on vocals and guitar; John Rees on bass guitar; Jerry Speiser on drums and backing vocals; and Ron Strykert on lead guitar and vocals. Hay was the group&#x27;s main songwriter both on his own, with Strykert, or with other bandmates. The group signed with the Australian branch of Columbia Records, which issued their second single, &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot;, in June that year. As record producer they used United States-born Peter McIan (Franne Golde, Serious Young Insects). The track was one written by Hay alone, and, in August, it peaked at No. 2 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart.

The group had already returned to the studio to continue working with McIan, who produced their debut album, &quot;Business as Usual&quot;, which included the earlier single. The second single from the album, &quot;Down Under&quot;, was released in November and was a reworked version of the B-side to their debut single, &quot;Keypunch Operator&quot;, from the previous year. &quot;Down Under&quot; was co-written by Hay and Strykert, and became the group&#x27;s first number-one hit in December – which stayed at the top for six weeks. The album was released on 9 November 1981, it entered the top 50 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart in December peaking at No. 1 for nine weeks and appearing in the top 50 for 118 weeks.

The non-album B-side, the jam-oriented instrumental &quot;Anyone for Tennis&quot;, was omitted from the 2003 remaster of &quot;Business as Usual&quot; (which contained both the other non-album B-sides from this era). It appears only on the B-side to &quot;Who Can it Be Now?&quot;.

== Reception ==
Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described &quot;Business as Usual&quot;: &quot;Aside from the strength of the music, part of the [its] appeal was its economy. The production sound was low-key, but clean and uncluttered. Indeed, the songs stood by themselves with little embellishment save for a bright, melodic, singalong quality&quot;. Gerry Raffaele for &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; felt &quot;[it] generally stays at a high level, tight and jerky, although I still favour the tracks which have appeared as singles ... There is a delicacy about this music – and that is not a thing you can say about too many rock groups&quot;.

<text>The California State Police (CSP) was the state-level security police agency from 1887 to 1995 for the U.S. state of California. It merged with the California Highway Patrol in 1995. 

Founded on March 15, 1887, the police agency primarily served to protect the State Capitol Building, the governor and other state officials, and other state agencies that did not have their own police force. The CSP also provided services to many different California state agencies, including performing tax seizures for the California Franchise Tax Board and Board of Equalization, as well as patrolling the California Aqueduct. They provided investigative services to elected officials through their Threat Assessment Detail and criminal investigations of crimes committed against the state through the Bureau of Investigative Services. Detectives and line officers routinely conducted investigations with other state agencies and allied law enforcement departments. The California State Police merged with the California Highway Patrol in 1995.

==History==

The agency traces to 1853, when the California State Legislature authorized a law enforcement body called the California Rangers, their primary objective being to capture notorious gang leader Joaquin Murrieta. Following his arrest and execution, however, the rangers were disbanded. On March 15, 1887, the California State Legislature authorized a law enforcement body with former leader of the Rangers, Captain Harry Love, and one other ranger, as its sole members to protect the State Capitol and grounds. They were paid $100 monthly and grew to a force of 12 officers. In 1911 the legislature approved more positions, uniforms, and defined the department giving it the official name of, &quot;California State Capitol Police&quot;. Eventually, as the department grew to approximately 400 personnel and its duties expanded, the word &quot;Capitol&quot; was dropped from the agency&#x27;s name.

===Public awareness===
The California State Police (CSP) Division was a small agency, with its official title being a division of the California Department of General Services. Officers and patrol cars of this division were rarely seen outside of the state’s larger metropolitan areas, with its largest presence being situated in the areas of Sacramento (State Capitol Division), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Redding, and San Diego. Its aircraft could be seen flying along the California Aqueduct.
Some of the most visible personnel of the CSP were its State Security Officers (SSOs) who were peace officers while on duty. SSOs held powers of arrest as regular police officers under the California Penal Code (CPC), but were not full-time peace officers. Their powers of arrest were only while on duty performing their specific assignments. SSOs were usually at fixed locations at state buildings on foot beats. SSOs sometimes performed patrol (automobile) duties in very limited geographical areas such as Exposition Park in Los Angeles.

Despite the California State Police presence in large metropolitan cities, at the State Capitol, at busy State office buildings, on foot beats, on patrol in fully marked police vehicles on the streets and highways, there were many Californians who were still unaware that California had its own State Police. This public knowledge of the California State Police didn&#x27;t fully come to light until its merger with the California Highway Patrol when it received major state news coverage in 1995.
At the time of the merger, the California State Police was the state’s oldest law enforcement agency (1887-1995 (~108 years)), a record that is still held today. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) was founded in 1929 and its officers were classified as &quot;State Traffic Officers&quot; until the merger. After the merger and subsequent charter responsibilities were taken over by the CHP, their official title was simply reduced to &quot;Officer&quot;, thus dropping &quot;traffic&quot; from their current seven-point star badge.

While they did maintain security personnel at major State facilities, they also maintained SCUBA units, Air Patrol Sections with their own fixed wing aircraft, equestrian mounted units, special investigations personnel, EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) bomb techs and equipment, Special Weapons And Tactics teams (SWAT), bicycle patrols, 4WD patrol units, regional detective squads, training personnel, Dignitary Protection Command, which saw to not only the security and safety of State elected and appointed officers, but also often to visiting dignitaries who might not have their own protective staff and provided training for like units from other agencies, Threat Assessment Investigations, armorers, and clerical personnel, as well as routine uniformed patrol officers and vehicles.

CSP sworn personnel were regulated and certified by the State&#x27;s Department of Justice Commission On Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST). CSP officers were expected to, at any time and at any place, perform the same duties of any city, county or other state law enforcement personnel except those relating to custodial duties (jail/prison). As such, they were the State&#x27;s oldest general law enforcement agency. Beyond the previously described duties, CSP personnel regularly served and executed State tax warrants, notices of seizure and maintained the peace (bailiff duties) in thousands of State Administrative Court hearings, meetings and procedures. The CSP regularly provided support personnel to other law enforcement agencies such as the State&#x27;s Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), the State&#x27;s Department of Justice Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement (BNE), State DMV investigations, Department of Health Services investigations, local law enforcement and coordinated State, Federal, Local Joint Agency Task Forces.

==Organization==
The last Chief of the CSP was long-time Sacramento County Sheriff (1971–1983) Duane Lowe. Lowe served as a Deputy Commissioner of the California Highway Patrol (CHP) during the transitional period of the merger of the two organizations. Lowe retired in 1996, a year after the CSP and CHP merged into one agency. 

===Rank structure===

==Penal Code Status==
At the time of the merger into the California Highway Patrol the California State Police received its peace officer authority under the California Penal Code (CPC). California State Police Officers were defined as Peace Officers under CPC section 830.2 and its Security Officers were defined as Peace Officers under CPC section 830.4. California State Police Officers had to attend and pass a California Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST)-certified Academy consisting of up to 23 weeks of instruction depending on academy location.

==Equipment==

In the final years of its existence the CSP fleet consisted of white Dodge Diplomats, then Chevrolet Caprices and finally Ford Crown Victorias with a large green and gold stripe running the length of the car. On the trunk lids in gold with green trim were the words “State Police&quot;. On each driver and front passenger door was a large seven-point gold-star badge with the State Capitol on the center seal. The words &quot;State Police&quot; in gold with green trim were on the front fenders.

Prior to 1983 the CSP fleet consisted of Dodges and Plymouths, also white, with no striping and the State Police shoulder patch as the door insignia.

CSP patrol cars (circa 1975-1983) were Plymouth Volares as part of a state fleet fuel saving directive by Governor Jerry Brown during his first two terms. State University and State Hospital Police downsized their vehicles or utilized Plymouth Fury IIIs with Slant Six engines, known informally as &quot;Campus Police Specials&quot;. The California Highway Patrol by nature of their mission was exempted from this directive.

<text>No. 24 Squadron (also known as No. XXIV Squadron) of the Royal Air Force is the Air Mobility Operational Conversion Unit (AM OCU). Based at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, 24 Squadron is responsible for aircrew training on A400M Atlas and C-17 Globemaster. The squadron also delivers or oversees engineer training for these aircraft.

==History==

===Fighter squadron (1915–1919)===
The squadron was founded as No. 24 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps on 1 September 1915 at Hounslow Heath Aerodrome. It arrived in France equipped with D.H.2 fighters in February 1916. The DH.2 came with a reputation for spinning because it had a rotary engine &quot;pushing&quot; it, but after Officer Commanding Major Lanoe Hawker demonstrated the recently discovered procedures for pulling out of a spin, the squadron&#x27;s pilots came to appreciate the type&#x27;s manoeuvrability.

By early 1917 the DH.2 was outclassed and they were replaced by the Airco DH.5. The DH.5 did not prove suitable as a fighter but the squadron used it in a ground-attack role. One of the first actions was during the Battle of Messines, and they took part later in the Battle of Cambrai. The DH.5 was phased out of operations and the squadron were given the SE.5a in December 1917. After a few months in the ground-attack role the squadron returned to air combat operations. By October 1918 the squadron had destroyed 200 enemy aircraft. With the armistice the squadron returned to England and was disbanded in February 1919.

===As a VIP transport squadron (1920–1968)===

On 1 February 1920 the squadron was re-formed at RAF Kenley as a communications and training squadron. During the General Strike of 1926, because of the lack of a postal services, the squadron was used to deliver government dispatches around the country.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War the squadron acquired civil airliners which were impressed for wartime service. It provided a detachment in France to run courier services, but with the withdrawal of British troops it was soon used to evacuate men back to England. Former British Airways and Imperial Airways aircraft were put to use on a network of communications flights including trips to Gibraltar and later Malta.

The squadron had grown into a large organisation, with a network of routes around the United Kingdom and eventually extended to India. It also operated VIP transports including Sir Winston Churchill&#x27;s personal aircraft. It was decided to break the squadron up: the internal communication flight became 510 Squadron in October 1942. In June 1943 a second squadron, No. 512, equipped with Douglas Dakotas was split off from No 24. This left 24 Squadron to concentrate on the long distance routes using the Avro York.

After many years the squadron had to leave RAF Hendon in February 1946 as the airfield was now too small to operate the larger Yorks and Avro Lancastrians. The squadron was also designated a &quot;Commonwealth&quot; squadron with crews from various Commonwealth countries joining the squadron strength.

===As a Transport Command Squadron (1968–2011)===
In 1968 the squadron moved from RAF Colerne to RAF Lyneham and re-equipped with the Lockheed Hercules. The squadron re-equipped with the new generation Hercules C.4 and C.5 (RAF designations for the C-130J-30 and C-130J respectively) in 2002. It celebrated 40 years of Hercules operation in 2008 and remained at Lyneham until July 2011 when the squadron relocated to RAF Brize Norton.

=== As a Training Squadron (2011–present) ===
In January 2011, 24 Squadron started its transition from a front-line C130J Hercules Squadron to become the Air Mobility Operational Conversion Unit. This transition brigaded the majority of flying and engineer training within the Air Mobility Force under one specialist training unit. 24 Squadron is currently responsible for the provision of training to aircrews flying the C17 Globemaster and A400M Atlas aircraft, and formerly the C130J Hercules until its retirement in 2023.

As a Central Flying School accredited training establishment, 24 Squadron is the professional training body for the Air Mobility Force delivering flying and engineering training. The Squadron also oversees Aircrew Instructor Development delivering initial aircrew instructor courses.

<text>No. 30 Squadron of the Royal Air Force operates the Airbus A400M Atlas transport aircraft and is based at RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire.

The squadron was first formed as a unit of the Royal Flying Corps in 1915, serving through the rest of the First World War in Egypt and Mesopotamia, carrying out reconnaissance, bombing and air-to-air combat duties. After the end of the war, the squadron continued to serve in Iraq, attacking rebels against the British rule in Iraq and later rebels against the Iraqi government.

==History==

===First World War===
In November 1914 the British Royal Flying Corps despatched a flight of aircraft from Britain to Egypt to defend the Suez Canal, as war with the Turkish Empire became increasingly likely. Initial equipment consisted of Farman Longhorn and Shorthorn biplanes, which were soon supplemented by Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s and Farman HF.20s sent from India. The flight, based at Ismailia Airfield, was redesignated No. 30 Squadron on 24 March 1915.

On 24 August 1915, the Mesopotamian Half Flight, a unit of the Australian Flying Corps stationed in Mesopotamia (now Iraq) was formally attached to 30 Squadron. For several months the Half-Flight, under Captain Henry Petre, and equipped with a mixture of Farman Shorthorns, Farman Longhorns and Caudron G.3s had been flying operations in support of the Indian Army, against Turkish ground forces, during the Mesopotamian campaign.

On 26 August 1915, a second flight, equipped with Martinsyde Scouts, arrived at Basrah to join the 30 Squadron forces operating in Mesopotamia. The Martinsydes suffered from poor engine reliability in the heat and dusty conditions encountered. Despite this, a forward deployed detachment of the squadron supported the army&#x27;s advance along the Tigris river, with reconnaissance by the squadron&#x27;s aircraft helping the British and Indian forces to win the Battle of Es Sinn and capture Kut al-Imara in September 1915. In October 1915, the rest of the squadron moved to Mesopotamia, being relieved in Egypt by 14 Squadron. On 7 November, the squadron was reorganised with headquarters and B Flight at Basra and A Flight deployed forward at Azizaya.

The squadron continued to support the British forces as they advanced towards Baghdad, until the advance was stopped by the Battle of Ctesiphon on 22–25 November 1915. An air reconnaissance mission on the eve of the battle carried out by Major H. L Reilly of the squadron spotted that the Turkish positions in front of Ctesiphon had been heavily reinforced, but his aircraft was shot down by ground-fire and Reilly captured. It has been suggested in the Official Histories of the Air War and the Campaign in Mesopotamia, that if Reilly had successfully returned with his intelligence to the British lines, Major General Townshend, commander of the British force, would have aborted the attack. After Ctesiphon, the British column retreated to Kut al-Imara, pursued by the Turkish Army, and Kut was besieged from 7 December 1915. Those aircraft that could evacuate left Kut earlier that day, but most of the personnel of the forward deployed A and B flights of the squadron, along with three unserviceable aircraft, were trapped in the besieged town.

While reduced in serviceable strength to only a single B.E.2, the Squadron provided reconnaissance support to the force sent to relieve the troops trapped at Kut. The squadron was reinforced by four more B.E.2s in February 1916. The relief column failed to break through to Kut, and in April 1916, the squadron, with eight B.E.2s, together with seven RNAS aircraft, carried out one of the earliest air supply mission when it air-dropped food and other supplies to the besieged garrison. While of food was dropped between 15 and 29 April, this was insufficient to feed the trapped troops and the civilian population of the town, and Major General Townshend surrendered on 29 April. The squadron built up its strength over the summer, and by August had 13 B.E.2s, which were supplemented by six Martinsyde Elephant scouts in September 1916. The squadron supported the resumed British offensive that started in December 1916, which resulted in the British capture of Baghdad on 11 March 1917, with the squadron moving to Baghdad airfield later that day. In April 1917, the Ottoman air defences were strengthened by the arrival of Halberstadt fighters from Germany, which outclassed 30 Squadrons B.E.2s. In response, two Bristol Scout fighters joined the squadron, with the promise that more capable Spad VIIs would follow.

In August that year, 63 Squadron arrived in Mesopotamia, so that 30 Squadron was no longer the sole source of air support for the British forces. In September the promised Spads arrived to replace 30 Squadron&#x27;s Bristol Scouts, while from October Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8s arrived to supersede the obsolete BE.2s, which were phased out by February 1918. In December 1917–January 1918, the squadron received two Airco DH.4 bombers, but both had been lost by the end of January 1918.

===1920s &amp; 1930s===

In 1919 the squadron was sent to Iran as part of the Norperforce. In April 1919, the squadron was reduced to a cadre at Baghdad, but not disbanded, and in February 1920, it returned to full strength at Baghdad as an Army co-operation squadron equipped with RE.8s, with these gradually being replaced by Airco DH.9A light bombers, with re-equipment being complete by early 1921. From June 1920, the squadron, along with the rest of the RAF&#x27;s strength in Iraq, was deployed against an Iraqi revolt against British rule. In May–June 1921, 30 and 47 Squadron&#x27;s DH.9As supported the establishing of a permanent Cairo–Baghdad land route, providing an air escort for vehicle convoys creating a visible track across the desert, while from 21 June that year the two squadrons began air-mail runs along the Cairo-Baghdad route.

In early 1924, aircraft from the squadron were deployed to Kirkuk for operations against a revolt led by the Kurdish leader Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji. The city of Sulaymaniyah, the base of Mahmud&#x27;s operations was bombed, and Mahmud withdrew into the mountains. The squadron again saw action in the summers of 1925 and 1926 as Mahmud&#x27;s rebellion reignited, attacking rebel-held villages. In late February 1938, a flight of 30 Squadron aircraft joined &#x27;Akforce&#x27;, a force of aircraft set up to stop Ikhwan nomadic raiders from Saudi Arabia attacking Iraq and Kuwait, these operations continuing until June.

In 1929 the squadron replaced its DH.9As with Westland Wapitis. In September 1930, Mahmud again raised a rebellion against the British and Iraqis, and 30 Squadron supported Iraqi Army operations against the rebels. The campaign against Mahmud continued until May 1931, when Mahmud surrendered. Wapitis of 30 Squadron flew 2204 hours between October 1930 and May 1931 in operations against Mahmud. In March 1932, the Iraqi Army launched an offensive against a revolt by the supporters of Ahmed Barzani in Southern Kurdistan. 30 Squadron initially provided reconnaissance support to the Iraqi Army columns, but after one column was heavily attacked and forced to retreat, the RAF launched a series of air attacks against Barzani&#x27;s forces until Barzani crossed the border into Turkey. In April–August 1935 the squadron received Hawker Hardys (a tropicalised, general purpose version of the Hawker Hart light bomber), being the first squadron to receive the Hardy. In 1936 the squadron moved to the RAFs new base in Iraq, RAF Habbaniya. It re-equipped with modern Blenheim I monoplane bombers in 1938.

===Second World War===

In August 1939, as war loomed, the squadron moved back to RAF Ismailia in Egypt and carried out escort missions in the Western Desert and provided fighter defence of Alexandria. In November 1940, it was sent to Greece to operate its Blenheims in both the bomber and fighter roles, with the first of its Blenheims arriving at Eleusis airfield near Athens on 3 November, with forward deployments of the bombers to an airfield at Paramythia, while the squadron&#x27;s fighter Blenheims remained back at Eleusis to protect Athens. In March 1941 the squadron was redesignated a fighter unit. On 5 April, five Blenheims were detached to Crete, and tasked with maritime reconnaissance, convoy escort and night fighting. More of the squadron&#x27;s Blenheims were sent to Maleme Airfield on Crete on 17 April. By the middle of May German air attacks on Crete had made the squadron&#x27;s operations from the island untenable, and on 15 May the squadrons remaining three airworthy Blenheims were evacuated to Egypt. Despite this, 229 officers and men from 30 and 33 Squadrons remained at Maleme when the Germans launched an attack on the airfield by airborne troops on 20 May. Many of these Airmen, despite being poorly armed took part in the defence of Maleme before the survivors attempted to evacuate via Sfakia. Losses were heavy. After the losses during the fall of Greece and the Battle of Crete the squadron was rebuilt as a fighter unit equipped with Hawker Hurricanes and employed on night defence of Alexandria and shipping protection patrols before moving on to operations in the Western Desert.

When the situation in the Far East worsened the squadron was ordered to reinforce allied forces in Java, but by the time the squadron left Egypt, Java, had already fallen, and the squadron was ferried by the aircraft carrier to Ceylon arriving on 6 March 1942, just in time to assist in resisting the Japanese carrier strike against the island. This raid took place on 5 April 1942 with 21 aircraft being launched from its base at RAF Ratmalana whilst under heavy fire from Japanese aircraft. Seven of the squadron&#x27;s Hurricanes were lost, with five of its pilots being killed or dying later of wounds received during the battle. It claimed 14 Japanese aircraft shot down, together with six probably destroyed and five damaged, out of a total claim for the whole of the island&#x27;s defences of 24 shot down, 7 probables and 9 damaged. In fact, the Japanese lost seven aircraft, with a further 15 damaged.

On 28 January 1944, the squadron left Ceylon for the Burma front, flying escort missions for Dakota and C-46 transports over the Kaladan valley. In March, it added night ground-attack sorties against river craft to its escort duties, and moved to Comilla on 10 April 1944. On 25 May 1944, the squadron was pulled out of the front line back to Yelahanka near Bangalore for re-equipment with American Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. It returned to action in October, carrying out bomber and transport escort, and ground attack with guns, bombs and napalm. It operated in support of 15 Corps until the end of March. Operating from Akyab, the squadron supported Operation Dracula, the Anglo-Indian amphibious landings at Rangoon on 1 May. Following the capture of Rangoon, with a lull of operations, the squadron was pulled out of the front line to prepare for Operation Zipper, the planned British invasion of Malaya, but the Japanese surrender on 15 August meant that the squadron was not needed to support the landings.

===Post-War===

After the Japanese surrender the squadron remained in India and its Thunderbolts were replaced by Hawker Tempest F Mk 2s in March 1946. No. 30 Squadron lost its aircraft on 1 December 1946, before being disbanded on 1 April 1947 at Agra.

On 24 November 1947 the squadron was reformed at RAF Oakington, Cambridgeshire in the transport role, operating as a unit within the Royal Air Force Transport Command. It flew the Dakota on many humanitarian supply flights during the Berlin Airlift. Re-equipment with the Vickers Valetta came in December 1950. The heavier four-engine Blackburn Beverley was flown between April 1957 and September 1967. From November 1959 30 Squadron operated out of RAF Eastleigh in Kenya before moving on to RAF Muharraq in October 1964.

===Hercules and Atlas (1968 – present)===

<doc id="1077576" wikidata="Q1631210" url="?curid=1077576" title="Vicar of Christ">
<text>Vicar of Christ (from Latin ) is a term used in different ways and with different theological connotations throughout history. The original notion of a vicar is as an &quot;earthly representative of Christ&quot;, but it is also used in the sense of &quot;person acting as parish priest in place of a real parson.&quot; The title is now used in Catholicism to refer to the bishops, and more specifically, was historically used to refer to the Bishop of Rome (the pope).
== History and different uses ==

During the history of Christianity, the title of Vicar of Christ was used in different ways, with implications for theological, pastoral or different time.

=== Use for the bishops ===
An early appearance of a similar concept of the Vicar of Christ is mentioned in the Epistle to the Magnesians of St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch (who was possibly a disciple of both John the Apostle and Saint Peter), written between the years AD 88 and 107, which states: &quot;your bishop presides in the place of God&quot;. Although Ignatius did not explicitly use the term Vicar of Christ, he sets out the concept, with regard to local bishops. More recently, the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church &quot;Lumen gentium&quot; noted that bishops are &quot;vicars and ambassadors of Christ,&quot; and the Catechism of the Catholic Church notes that each bishop governs his diocese &quot;[a]s Christ&#x27;s vicar.&quot;

The first recorded use of the term &quot;Vicar of Christ&quot; is found in the epistles of Tertullian in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries, referring to the Holy Spirit, that is, as Christ is not physically performing miracles in the Church, Holy Spirit acts as his Vicar on his behalf, performing miracles and preventing the Church from error. Other roles Tertullian attributed to the Holy Spirit as Vicar were: the direction of discipline, the revelation of the Scriptures, the reformation of the intellect, and the advancement toward the &lt;q&gt;better things.&lt;/q&gt;

=== Use for the popes ===

The third use of the term Vicar of Christ appears in the 5th century, in a synod of bishops to refer to Pope Gelasius I. The theological connotations of the title got a pastoral sense, evoking the words of Christ to the Apostle Peter, regarded by the first Catholic Pope in John 21:16-17, &quot;Feed my lambs [...] Feed my sheep&quot;. Catholics interpret this as Christ making Peter his vicar and pastor with the responsibility to feed his flock (i.e. the Church) in his own place.

However, the use of the title to refer to the popes in the early Church was unstable, and several variants of the use of Vicar were used for the Pope, as &quot;Vicar of Peter&quot;, indicating that they were the successors of St. Peter, &quot;Vicar of the Prince of the Apostles&quot; or &quot;Vicar of the Apostolic See&quot;, among other variants. This title is used by the Roman Missal in their prayers for a dead pope, and the oath of allegiance to St. Boniface to Pope Gregory II. Since 1200, Popes have consistently used this title. Insisting that he — and he alone—had the right to remove bishops from office, Pope Innocent III appealed to the title of Vicar of Christ. Occasionally, Popes like Nicholas III used &quot;Vicar of God&quot; as an equivalent title The 2012 edition of the Annuario Pontificio gives &quot;Vicar of Jesus Christ&quot; as the second official title of the Pope (the first being &quot;Bishop of Rome&quot;). The edition of the same book published on March 25, 2020, included the title of &quot;Vicar of Christ&quot; to the section &quot;Historical titles&quot; section, to indicate its bond with the history of the papacy.

=== Use in caesaropapism ===
Another use of the title, with a different meaning, appeared in the Eastern Churches between the fifth and sixth centuries. The term was used to refer to the Byzantine emperor, showing the apex of caesaropapism. Though decisions on doctrine, liturgy and spirituality were left to the bishops.

<text>Apostrophe (&#x27;) is the fifth solo album and eighteenth in total by Frank Zappa, released in March 1974 in both stereo and quadraphonic formats. An edited version of its lead-off track, &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat the Yellow Snow&quot;, was the first of Zappa&#x27;s three &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 hits, ultimately peaking at number 86. The album itself became the biggest commercial success of Zappa&#x27;s career, reaching number 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Overview==
&quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; remains Zappa&#x27;s most commercially successful album in the United States. It was certified gold by the RIAA on April 7, 1976 and peaked at number 10 (a career-high placement) on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in 1974. Continuing from the commercial breakthrough of &quot;Over-Nite Sensation&quot; (1973), this album is a similar mix of short songs showcasing Zappa&#x27;s humor and musical arrangements. The record&#x27;s lyrical themes are often bizarre or obscure, with the exception of &quot;Uncle Remus&quot;, which is an extension of Zappa&#x27;s feelings on racism featured on his earlier song &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot;.

==Music==
The first half of the album loosely follows a continuing theme. &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat the Yellow Snow&quot; and &quot;Nanook Rubs It&quot; tell of a dream the singer had where he saw himself as an Eskimo named Nanook. It continues into &quot;St. Alfonzo&#x27;s Pancake Breakfast&quot;, which Zappa said was inspired by a television commercial for Imperial margarine.

As was the case with many of Zappa&#x27;s albums, &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; was a melange of archival and recent recordings; side one of &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; and the whole &quot;Over-Nite Sensation&quot; album (released as the immediate predecessor to &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; in 1973) were recorded simultaneously during the spring of 1973. The tracks on side two originate from various 1972 sessions with overdubs recorded in 1973 and 1974, except for &quot;Excentrifugal Forz&quot;, where the drum track (played by Johnny Guerin) originally came from the &quot;Hot Rats&quot; sessions in 1969 (along with the bass and drum tracks for &quot;Lemme Take You to the Beach&quot; on &quot;Studio Tan&quot; (1978) and &quot;Läther&quot; (1996), although in the case of &quot;Excentrifugal Forz&quot; this is not actually noted in either the album liner notes or official correspondence), and &quot;Stinkfoot&quot;, where the basic track, possibly originally known as &quot;The Bass &amp; Drums Song&quot;, dates from the &quot;Chunga&#x27;s Revenge&quot; sessions in early 1970 as the backing track to a cover of Lightnin&#x27; Slim&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m A Rolling Stone&quot;.

&quot;Apostrophe&#x27;&quot; is an instrumental featuring a very fuzzed bass part by Jack Bruce from Cream, and with session drummer Jim Gordon, who was on tour with Zappa&#x27;s band at the time of the session in November 1972. Zappa stated of Bruce in one interview, &quot;Well, that was just a jam thing that happened because he was a friend of (drummer) Jim Gordon. I found it very difficult to play with him; he&#x27;s too busy. He doesn&#x27;t really want to play the bass in terms of root functions; I think he has other things on his mind. But that&#x27;s the way jam sessions go.&quot;

==Release and reception==

&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau wrote in his review: &quot;Disillusioned acolytes are complaining that he&#x27;s retreated, which means he&#x27;s finally made top ten, but that&#x27;s just his reward for professional persistence. If anything, the satire&#x27;s improved a little, and the title piece—an improvisation with Jack Bruce, Jim Gordon, and rhythm guitarist Tony Duran—forays into quartet-style jazz-rock. Given Frank&#x27;s distaste for &#x27;Cosmik Debris&#x27; you&#x27;d think maybe he&#x27;s come up with something earthier than Mahavishnu, but given his distaste for sex you can be sure it&#x27;s more cerebral instead.&quot;

&quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; and &quot;Over-Nite Sensation&quot;, recorded with the same group of musicians, are the subject of a &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series documentary from Eagle Rock Entertainment, released on DVD May 1, 2007.

In July 2016, the Zappa Family Trust released a CD of alternate mixes, different takes and live versions of material from &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; titled &quot;The Crux of the Biscuit&quot;. It includes early versions of &quot;Down in De Dew&quot;, which Zappa considered for &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; but later included on &quot;Läther.&quot;

<text>John Brendan Keane (21 July 1928 – 30 May 2002) was an Irish playwright, novelist and essayist from Listowel, County Kerry.

==Biography==

A son of a national school teacher, William B. Keane, and his wife Hannah (née Purtill), Keane was educated at Listowel National School and then at St Michael&#x27;s College, Listowel. He worked as a chemist&#x27;s assistant for A. H. Jones who dabbled in buying antiques. Keane had various jobs in the UK between 1951 and 1955 working as a street cleaner, and a bar man, living in a variety of places including Northampton and London. It was while he was in Northampton that Keane was first published in an unnamed women&#x27;s magazine for which he received £15.

After returning to Ireland from the United Kingdom, he became a pub owner in Listowel from 1955.

He married Mary O&#x27;Connor at Knocknagoshel Church on 5 January 1955 and had four children: Billy, Conor, John and Joanna.

He was an Honorary Life Member of the Royal Dublin Society from 1991, served as president of Irish PEN and was a founder member of the Society of Irish Playwrights as well as a member of Aosdána. Keane was named the patron of the Listowel Players after the Listowel Drama Group fractured. He remained a prominent member of the Fine Gael party throughout his life, never being shy of political debate.

His nephew is the investigative journalist Fergal Keane. His son John is a journalist with the &quot;Kilkenny People&quot; while his son, Billy regularly writes a column for the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;.

== Influences ==
Keane cited many literary influences including Bryan MacMahon and George Fitzmaurice, fellow Kerry writers and playwrights.

His personal influences were numerous but, most notably he thanked his father and his wife, Mary. Keane was grateful for his father&#x27;s help with early editing, for allowing him access to his personal library, and for encouraging him to continue his work until he was successful.

He was also influenced by the local population and the patrons of his pub, on whom he based some of his characters.

<doc id="1077598" wikidata="Q5232146" url="?curid=1077598" title="David Caplan">
<text>David Richard Caplan (November 15, 1964 – July 24, 2019) was a Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario who represented the ridings of Oriole and Don Valley East from 1997 to 2011 and a cabinet minister in the government of Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty from 2003 to 2009.

==Background==
Caplan was born in Toronto, Ontario, and was educated at the University of Western Ontario. He worked as a commercial real estate agent with the firm of Ernest Goodman Ltd. from 1985 to 1989, and was vice-president of Taurus Metal Trading Ltd. (a recycling company) between 1989 and 1992.

Caplan was elected as a trustee to the North York Board of Education in 1991 and served in this capacity for six years, becoming the board&#x27;s vice-chair in 1993. He also served on the Metropolitan Toronto School Board from 1994 to 1997, becoming its vice-chair shortly before his departure for higher office.

Caplan was the son of Elinor Caplan (née Hershorn), who served as a cabinet minister at the federal and provincial levels. His father, Mayer Wilfred Caplan, was a business person active in politics. He was married to Leigh and had two sons, Benjamin and Jacob.

==Politics==
In 1997, Elinor Caplan resigned her seat in the Ontario legislature to seek election to the House of Commons of Canada. David Caplan contested his mother&#x27;s former riding of Oriole in the subsequent by-election, and defeated his Progressive Conservative opponent, former federal Member of Parliament Barbara Greene, by a significant margin. He subsequently served as the Liberal critic for Youth and Training.

Ontario&#x27;s electoral map was significantly altered in 1996, when Progressive Conservative Premier Mike Harris introduced a bill to reduce the number of members in the legislature from 130 to 103. These changes did not apply to by-elections for the sitting legislature, but came into effect for the provincial election of 1999. As a result, Caplan was forced to face another incumbent Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP), Minister of Education David Johnson, in the new riding of Don Valley East. Johnson had surprised many observers by not running in the safer riding of Don Valley West.

In one of the most closely watched races of the campaign, Caplan defeated Johnson on election night by just over 3,000 votes. There are several public school teachers in Don Valley East, and many suspect that &quot;strategic voting&quot; by this group against the Tories was a leading factor in Caplan&#x27;s victory. The Progressive Conservatives won the election. Caplan became his party&#x27;s Housing Critic and Deputy Whip.

Like his mother, David Caplan was a prominent politician in the Jewish community of the North York area. He did not, however, join with several other politicians from this community (including fellow Liberal MPP Monte Kwinter) to support provincial funding for non-Catholic religious schools in 2001. The initiative was brought forward by the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris, and the Liberal Party opposed it on the grounds that it would divert money from public schools. While Kwinter publicly disagreed with his party&#x27;s position, Caplan supported it and referred to the Harris government&#x27;s plan as &quot;the first step toward a voucher system&quot;.

===2003 session===
Caplan was easily re-elected in Don Valley East in the provincial election of 2003, defeating his Progressive Conservative opponent, former city councillor Paul Sutherland, by over 9200 votes. The Liberals won the general election, and Caplan was appointed to Cabinet on October 23, 2003, as Minister of Public Infrastructure Renewal.

Caplan was responsible for leading the modernization of the province&#x27;s infrastructure and planning for future population and economic growth. He released a long-term $30 billion plus infrastructure investment strategy called ReNew Ontario, which used a private financing model expanding and building new hospitals, schools, colleges and universities, and transit and transportation systems. Caplan was responsible for the Places to Grow Act, 2005, which allows for a better way of accommodating growth across the province through the development of growth plans. The first growth plan under this legislation, the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, was a 25-year strategy to maximize the benefits of growth and maintain a high quality of life for the fastest growing urban region in Canada. Minister Caplan also had responsibility for several major government agencies managing public assets, including: The Ontario Realty Corporation, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, Liquor Control Board of Ontario, Infrastructure Ontario and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation.

Caplan came under heavy criticism after the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation was mired in a scandal which saw retailers were winning a disproportionate number of jackpots. He stayed on despite opposition calls for his resignation.

After a cabinet shuffle on June 29, 2005, Caplan was given the additional position of Deputy Government House Leader.

===2007 session===
On June 20, 2008, Premier Dalton McGuity announced a cabinet shuffle that saw Caplan swapping portfolios with George Smitherman. Caplan was appointed Minister of Health, while Smitherman was appointed both the Minister of Public Infrastructure Renewal and the Minister of Energy (taking over from Gerry Phillips). There was criticism of Caplan&#x27;s new portfolio, as he suffered from weight issues and was formerly a heavy smoker, but he dismissed it, saying &quot;My own conversations between me and my doctor are private matters, (as) they are for all of us, and they&#x27;ll remain private&quot;.

In May 2009, there were opposition calls for Caplan&#x27;s resignation after it was revealed that eHealth Ontario CEO Sarah Kramer had approved about $4.8 million in no-bid contracts during the first four months of the agency&#x27;s operation, while also spending $50000 to refurnish her office, and paying consultants up to $300 an hour. Nine senior eHealth employees were fired, reportedly for challenging the agency&#x27;s tendering practices. eHealth Ontario argued that the no-bid contracts were necessary due to the rapid transition process to eHealth from its predecessor Smart Systems for Health Agency, while Caplan defended Kramer&#x27;s bonus as part of her move from another agency. The opposition noted that the McGuinty government spent five years and $647 million on the Smart Systems for Health Agency, which used 15 per cent of its $225 million annual budget on consultants despite employing 166 people with annual salaries exceeding $100,000, before the project was shut down and restarted as eHealth Ontario. Premier Dalton McGuinty said he was concerned about eHealth&#x27;s spending information and said that he would act upon the auditor general&#x27;s report. McGuinty and Caplan said that it was tough to recruit top experts to build a provincewide electronic health records system.

On October 6, 2009, Caplan resigned his post as Health Minister in advance of a report detailing irregularities in spending and expense accounts related to eHealth Ontario, a government agency tasked with the creation of electronic health records.

He announced on July 14, 2011, that he would not be a candidate in the October 6, 2011 provincial election.

===Cabinet positions===

==Post-political career==
Caplan served as vice-chair of public affairs firm Global Public Affairs in Toronto. In December 2017, he started serving as the chief operating officer of ORBA, Ontario Road Builders Association.

==Return to politics==
Caplan unsuccessfully ran as councillor for Toronto City Council in the 2018 municipal election in Ward 16 – Don Valley East. He was attempting to unseat long-time incumbent Denzil Minnan-Wong who has been referred to as council&#x27;s &quot;staunchest conservative&quot;.

At the time of his death, Caplan was seeking the federal Liberal nomination in Don Valley North for the 2019 Canadian federal election.

==Personal life==
Caplan was married to Leigh with two children, Benjamin and Jacob. They began dating in high school when Caplan was 17.

He died at his home in Toronto on July 24, 2019, at the age of 54, after a &quot;fire accident&quot;, according to his family.

He is the brother of restaurateur Zane Caplansky.

<doc id="1077602" wikidata="Q1944795" url="?curid=1077602" title="Thorncombe">
<text>Thorncombe is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. It was historically, until 1844, an exclave of Devon. It lies five miles (8 km) south east of the town of Chard in neighbouring Somerset. Thorncombe is situated close to the borders of both Somerset and Devon. In the 2011 census the population of the civil parish was 687.

== Description ==
Approximately half of the population of the parish live in the village of Thorncombe, the rest are divided between the hamlets of Holditch, Hewood and Synderford, and outlying farms and houses. The layout of Thorncombe village consists of three roads which meet at a &quot;T&quot; in the middle of the village. These roads are Chard Street, Fore Street and High Street.

Chard Street heads north to the Somerset town of Chard. Chard Street is probably the busiest road with the Village Hall, St Mary&#x27;s Primary School and the housing estates of Gribb View and Tansee Hill. Gribb View breaks from the tradition of most of the village in being mostly brick or rendered buildings, the traditional build of the village being flint-faced cottages, as this stone was readily available from the local area. Tansee Hill, of more recent build, is more in keeping with the village as it consists of both flint-faced and rendered buildings.

Fore Street heads to the east towards Venn and is a more traditional looking part of the village with flint-faced cottages and terraced housing down its length. Along Fore Street are many of the buildings which previously housed village amenities and services such as the village store, a bakery and two pubs; these are all now used for housing.

High Street heads west and towards Sadborrow and Holditch. The housing in High Street presents a traditional appearance. Halfway along High Street is the recent development of Orchard Lane. This development, like Tansee Hill, is in keeping with the look of the village with traditional-looking buildings, some of which are thatched.

== Geography ==
The parish of Thorncombe is over in extent and is principally agricultural land. It lies within the Dorset National Landscape. To the east, across the valley of the River Synderford, is the ridge of Blackdown Hill, traversed by the Jubilee Trail, from which there are extensive views of the village and the area. About to the southeast is Pilsdon Pen, Dorset&#x27;s second highest point.

== History ==
The original church at Thorncombe was dedicated to St Mary by William Brewer, Bishop of Exeter, in 1239. The building of the church, as well as nearby Forde Abbey (founded in 1136), was superintended by Cistercian monks from Waverley, Surrey. Thomas Chard, alias Tyblis, the last Abbot, was Suffragan Bishop to the Bishop of Exeter from 1508 and was appointed Vicar of Thorncombe in 1529, 10 years before he left Forde Abbey at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539.

Local legend has it that Rev. John Bragge, Vicar of Thorncombe from 1644 to 1647, was deprived of his living, probably because he was involved in a royalist plot against Cromwell, and was transported to Barbados. Although this statement appears on several websites, it is incorrect. The truth is less dramatic: Thorncombe’s parish register records John Bragge&#x27;s burial in the churchyard on 5 April 1647. The &quot;Journal of the House of Lords&quot; for 3 November 1647 records the presentation of a ‘Petition of the Inhabitants of Thornecombe’. Now in Lambeth Palace Library, it confirms the date of John Bragge&#x27;s demise. Signed by 62 parishioners, it states that parishioners &#x27;have suffered above these twelve months last past their want of a preaching minister of the Gospel, by reason that John Bragge the last Incumbent by his delinquency agt State was sequestrated unto the time of his death which happened about half a year since&#x27;.

The old church stood about to the south of the present church, where the Wellingtonia tree now stands. In 1770, the church at Thorncombe was not large enough to contain &#x27;the fourth part of the inhabitants&#x27;. Thorncombe&#x27;s population grew from around 885 in 1676 to 1,308 in 1851 and 1,189 in 1871. The present church dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, was built in 1866 to seat 400. There was a significant community of non conformists living in the parish from the late 17th century onwards. In 1689 clothier Robert French registered his Synderford home as a &quot;Protestant Dissenting Meeting Place&quot; and by 1723 there was a Quaker Meeting House and burial ground at Laymore, just outside the parish boundary. 

Historically Thorncombe&#x27;s main industries were spinning, weaving and sheep and cattle breeding. Other small industries included leather production, shoe making and flax processing. During the 18th century there was a weekly market selling &#x27;grain and meat&#x27; and serving &#x27;other wants&#x27; and an annual Easter fair where &#x27;sheep and other horned cattle&#x27; and locally woven &#x27;narrow cloth&#x27; were traded. The market ceased trading in 1773 and the last recorded fair took place in 1885. Following the national decline in small scale weaving during the 19th century due to industrialisation, Thorncombe reverted to agriculture, but this has decreased in recent times. There are still a few farms which survive around the village but most residents work in the local towns of Chard, Crewkerne and Bridport.

Famous past inhabitants of Thorncombe include the Puritan Sir Henry Rosewell; the poet, dramatist and Royalist sermoniser Robert Gomersall; the Commonwealth Attorney General, Edmund Prideaux; Queen Anne&#x27;s Secretary of War Francis Gwyn; the artist Lucien Pissarro; the ethnologist Sir Raymond Firth; the anthropologist Rosemary, Lady Firth; and the art-historian Cecil Gould.

=== Boundary changes ===
Until 1844, the parish of Thorncombe was an exclave of Devon, at which time it was transferred under the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, to Dorset. It was part of Axminster Hundred.

In 1836 the parish, which had been part of the Deanery of Honiton, was transferred ecclesiastically from the Diocese of Exeter to the Diocese of Salisbury. In 1982, the ecclesiastical parish was transferred to the Diocese of Bath and Wells, at which time it became a &#x27;united benefice&#x27; sharing a vicar with the neighbouring (Somerset) parishes of Winsham and Cricket St Thomas. In 1999, the parishes joined with others to form the Chard and District Team Ministry. In 2006 Thorncombe together with Winsham was linked with Tatworth, Chaffcombe and Cricket Malherbie with Knowle St Giles to form the Two Shires Benefice.

== Politics ==
In the UK national parliament, Thorncombe is within the West Dorset parliamentary constituency. As of 2024, the Member of Parliament (MP) is Edward Morello of the Liberal Democrats. He is the first non-Conservative MP since the creation of the constituency in 1885.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Thorncombe is part of the Marshwood Vale ward which elects one member to Dorset Council.

== Church ==
The present church, incorporating a number of items from the old church, was built in 1866–1867 at a cost of £4,000. The foundation stone was laid on 26 April 1866 by Margaret Bragge, widow of Colonel Bragge of Sadborow, and was dedicated by the Bishop of Salisbury on 15 October 1867. It was built in Perpendicular style, the windows being modelled on those of the cloisters of Forde Abbey. Inside the church is a memorial brass commemorating Sir Thomas (died 1419) and Lady Brook (died 1437) of Holditch Manor. This is one of 500 brass memorials recorded in the Lancastrian period 1400–1453.

<text>Cargo is the second studio album by the Australian pop rock band Men at Work, which was released in April 1983. It peaked at No. 1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart, No. 2 in New Zealand, No. 3 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 8 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart. Four singles were released from the album, with &quot;Overkill&quot; being an international top 10 hit in Canada, Ireland, Norway, and US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This was the last Men at Work album to feature the original lineup.

== Background ==

Australian pop rock group Men at Work released their second album, &quot;Cargo&quot;, in April 1983, which peaked at No. 1 – for two weeks – on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. In New Zealand it reached No. 2. The album was recorded and finished by mid-1982 with Peter McIan producing again, but its release was pushed back due to the continued success of their debut album, &quot;Business as Usual&quot;. On the international market, where &quot;Business as Usual&quot; was still riding high, &quot;Cargo&quot; appeared at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 8 in the UK. The lead single, &quot;Dr. Heckyll &amp; Mr. Jive&quot;, was issued in Australia, ahead of the album, in October 1982; it reached No. 6 there in late 1982 and peaked at No. 28 in the US the following year. The second single &quot;Overkill&quot; was released in March 1983 and made it to No. 5 in Australia, and No. 3 in the US. A third single &quot;It&#x27;s a Mistake&quot; followed in June and only reached No. 34 in Australia, but peaked at No. 6 in the US. The much less successful fourth and final single &quot;High Wire&quot; was released in late 1983 and only reached No. 89 in Australia, but reached No. 23 on the US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. The band toured the world extensively in 1983.

== Reception ==
In &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Fred Dellar praised &quot;Cargo&quot; as &quot;an immaculately constructed album of outback pop for in-front people&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Christopher Connelly wrote that &quot;Cargo&quot; &quot;may lack a track with the body-slamming intensity of &#x27;Who Can It Be Now?&#x27; and &#x27;Down Under&#x27;, but song for song, it is a stronger overall effort than &quot;Business as Usual&quot;&quot;. He chiefly praised the album&#x27;s dark, paranoid lyrics. John Mendelssohn of &quot;Record&quot; also felt that none of the tracks measured up to Men at Work&#x27;s early hits, but went further, saying the album in its entirety is inoffensive but forgettable, with &quot;Upstairs in My House&quot; being the only highlight. He found the band&#x27;s instrumental solos particularly dull, and assessed that Men at Work&#x27;s one asset is that &quot;Colin Hay may be the most effortlessly soulful pop singer since Sting&quot;.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised &quot;Overkill&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Mistake&quot; as &quot;demonstrating more depth than anything on the debut&quot;. However, he asserted that the album parallels their debut in that it focuses on two strong singles while it is &quot;weighed down by filler&quot;.

<doc id="1077619" wikidata="Q2382181" url="?curid=1077619" title="Tincleton">
<text>Tincleton is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It is situated near the River Frome, approximately east of the county town Dorchester. The name of the village comes from the Old English &quot;Tin la Ton&quot;, or &quot;farm in a valley&quot;. In 2001 Tincleton had a population of 142. Dorset County Council&#x27;s latest (2013) estimate of the parish population is 150.

The parish manor house, Clyffe House, was rebuilt in the Tudor style in 1842 by Benjamin Ferrey. In 1849 the parish church, which is dedicated to St John the Evangelist, was also built by Ferrey, in a 13th-century style. It replaced an earlier church to the south which was demolished when Ferrey&#x27;s building was finished. Ferrey also designed a school, which was also built in the 1840s. This is now called The Old School House and contains Tincleton Gallery, which has information about the historical setting and the schoolchildren, with photos dating back to 1913.

The artist Simon Gudgeon operates a sculpture park, &quot;Sculpture by the Lakes&quot;, nearby.

== Politics ==
After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Tincleton is part of the Winterborne and Broadmayne ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

<text>Miss Moneypenny&#x27;s is a house music party club, founded in Birmingham, England, in 1986 and is hosted at a purpose-built venue in the Hockley area of the city.

Miss Moneypenny&#x27;s, which styles itself as &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Glamorous Clubbing Brand&quot;, has been hosting parties and events since the 1990s. The club has been featured on BBC Radio 1, in various DJ magazines, and has been voted a top UK dance nightclub since the early 1990s.

==History==
Miss Moneypenny&#x27;s evolved as a weekly club event out of the extravagant, one-off ‘Chuff Chuff’ rave parties, a long-running and hedonistic house music event. Chuff Chuff was founded by Mick, Jim, and Dermot Ryan, and Lee Garrick and was initially held as a fancy-dress boat party.

Miss Moneypenny&#x27;s was started in the summer of 1993 as a weekly Saturday-night event in Bonds nightclub in Birmingham and with resident DJ&#x27;s Russell Salsbury and Simon Owen. The &quot;Miss Moneypennys&quot; name was chosen because of its association with the James Bond theme suggested by the name of the venue where the night was hosted.

Miss Moneypenny&#x27;s began to hold other weekly residencies, at The Canal in Wolverhampton, The Church and Liberty&#x27;s in Birmingham, SKOOL in London, and specialised nights such as MP&#x27;S, which was held at the Academy, Stoke-on-Trent, and a special student night, named Jelly Baby.

==Development outside the UK==
Miss Moneypenny&#x27;s residencies, Chuff Chuff nights, tours and radio broadcasts use the slogan &quot;The Worlds Most Glamorous Clubbing Brand&quot;.

Miss Moneypenny’s has had residencies at venues in a number of European beach-holiday areas including a fourteen-year residency at the BCM superclub in Magaluf, Mallorca, as well as summer residencies in Tenerife, Marbella, Cyprus, Malta, Greece and Turkey. The club also had a 14-year residency at the former El Divino nightclub in Ibiza before it closed in 2009.

==Compilation albums==

Miss Moneypenny&#x27;s has released a series of compilation albums, as well as commercial and underground dance tracks on its own in-house music record label, Miss Moneypenny’s Music.

==Radio==
Miss Moneypenny’s has a syndicated dance music show, presented by Miss Moneypenny&#x27;s Musical Director, and longtime resident DJ, Jim ‘Shaft’ Ryan.

<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Michael Le Fanu (2 August 1913 – 28 November 1970) was a Royal Navy officer. He fought in the Second World War as gunnery officer in a cruiser operating in the Home Fleet during the Norwegian campaign and the Battle of the Mediterranean and then as gunnery officer in a battleship operating in the Eastern Fleet before becoming liaison officer between the British Pacific Fleet and the United States Third Fleet. After the War he commanded a frigate, a training establishment and an aircraft carrier. He served as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in the late 1960s. In that role, in the face of economic difficulties, he worked hard to reshape the Navy as an anti-submarine force operating primarily in the Atlantic Ocean.

==Early life==
Born the son of Captain Hugh Barrington Le Fanu RN (of Huguenot descent) and Georgiana Harriott Le Fanu (née Kingscote), Le Fanu was educated at Bedford School and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.

==Naval career==
Le Fanu joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1926 and was posted to the cruiser in the Atlantic Fleet before being promoted to midshipman on 1 September 1931 and being posted to the cruiser HMS &quot;York&quot;. Promoted to sub-lieutenant on 1 May 1934, he joined the destroyer HMS &quot;Whitshed&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in March 1935 and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 June 1935. He was posted to the destroyer HMS &quot;Bulldog&quot; in the Home Fleet in September 1936 before training as a gunnery specialist during 1938 and then being posted to the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet.
Le Fanu served in the Second World War being posted to the cruiser operating in the Home Fleet as gunnery officer in December 1939. While aboard &quot;Aurora&quot;, he was mentioned in despatches for his services during the Norwegian campaign in Spring 1940 and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions in November 1941 when an Italian convoy was destroyed during the Battle of the Mediterranean.
Promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 June 1942, Le Fanu joined the gunnery staff of the Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet that month and then transferred to the battleship operating as part of the Eastern Fleet as gunnery officer in March 1944. Promoted to commander on 31 December 1944, he was posted as liaison officer between the British Pacific Fleet and the United States Third Fleet in January 1945 and was awarded the United States Legion of Merit for his actions. He was also invited to attend the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender in the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; on 2 September 1945.

After the War Le Fanu served on the experimental staff at the shore establishment HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; and in 1948 he became executive officer in the cruiser HMS &quot;Superb&quot;. He was promoted to captain on 30 June 1949 and became Naval Assistant to the First Sea Lord at the Admiralty. He was given command of the frigate as Captain (F) of the Third Training Squadron in October 1951, and returned to the Admiralty to join the staff of the Chief Scientist in 1952. He attended the Imperial Defence College in 1953 and became commanding officer of the training establishment HMS &quot;Ganges&quot; at Harwich in December 1954. He was given command of the aircraft carrier in February 1957 and was promoted to rear admiral on 7 July 1958 on appointment as Director-General, Weapons at the Admiralty. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1960 Birthday Honours. He became Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet in July 1960 and was promoted to vice admiral on 25 October 1961 on appointment as Controller of the Navy. Advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1963 Birthday Honours and promoted to full admiral on 29 September 1965, he became Commander-in-Chief, Middle East in December 1965. In that role he served as Joint Commander of the three services in the Middle East during the evacuation of British Nationals during the Aden Emergency.

Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1968 New Year Honours, Le Fanu became First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in August 1968. In the face of economic difficulties he worked hard to reshape the Navy as an anti-submarine force operating primarily in the Atlantic Ocean. He was nominated for the post of Chief of the Defence Staff but never held the office because he was suddenly discovered to be terminally ill with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL). He was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 3 July 1970, on his retirement, and died in London on 28 November 1970.

==Family==
In 1943 Le Fanu married Prudence Grace Morgan, daughter of Admiral Sir Llewellyn Vaughan Morgan; they had two sons and a daughter.

<text>Toller Porcorum () is a village and civil parish in Dorset, England, situated in the Toller valley northwest of Dorchester. In the 2011 census the civil parish—which also includes the small settlements of Higher and Lower Kingcombe to the north—had a population of 307.

== Population ==
A rural and slowly growing area with a population of 307, Toller Porcorum is a village of approximately 160 households.

== History ==
Like the other Toller villages of Toller Fratrum and Toller Whelme, the name was taken from the river, which is now known as the Hooke. The addition &quot;Porcorum&quot; means &quot;of the pigs&quot; in Latin; the village was in the past sometimes known as &quot;Swines Toller&quot;, but more often as &quot;Great Toller&quot;.

Toller Porcorum is also an ancient Anglican ecclesiastical parish. The church is dedicated to Saints Peter and Andrew and is remarkable for the &quot;drooping chancel&quot;.

From 1862 to 1975, the village had a railway station on the Bridport Railway.

== The Old Swan ==
The village pub, &quot;The Old Swan&quot;, was closed by the brewery in 1999 and has since been converted into a private dwelling. Skittles was played there.

== Notable people ==
Despite its small size the village has been home to a number of notable people. George of Clarence was at one point the owner of the majority of the village.

<text>The DEFA cannon (&quot;Direction des Études et Fabrications d&#x27;Armement&quot;) is a family of widely used French-made aircraft revolver cannon firing 30 mm caliber NATO standard rounds.

==Design history==
The initial DEFA 551 was developed in the late 1940s. It is based on the German Mauser MG 213C, an experimental revolver cannon developed for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The MG 213 never reached production, but inspired the DEFA, the very similar British ADEN cannon, and the smaller American M39 cannon. As the &quot;DEFA 552&quot; it entered production in 1954. In 1968 an upgraded version, Canon 550-F3, was developed, entering production in 1971 as the &quot;DEFA 553&quot;. The new version provided a new feed system, nichrome plated steel barrel, forged drum casing, and improved electrical reliability.

==Overview==

The DEFA 553 is a gas-operated five-chamber revolver cannon using pyrotechnic cocking and electrical ignition. It fires a range of 30 mm ammunition of various types, and is capable of continuous fire or 0.5-second or 1-second bursts.

The 553 was superseded by the DEFA 554, which incorporates a number of detail improvements. The DEFA 554 uses three, rather than two, of the chambers for reloading, increasing the rate of fire. Barrel life and mechanical reliability are improved, and an electrical control unit allows the pilot to select two rates of fire: 1,800 rounds per minute for air-to-air use or 1,200 rounds per minute for air-to-ground attacks. The 554 also provides three Pyrotechnic cocking charges rather than one, allowing the pilot to cock the weapon after take-off and have two cartridges to re-cock the weapon if necessary in flight.

==Service use==

The DEFA 550 series was the standard cannon armament of all gun-armed French fighters from 1954 until the advent of the Dassault Rafale in the 1980s. A pair of these weapons, with 125–135 rounds per gun, is standard fit on the Brazilian ground-attack aircraft AMX International AMX, the French Dassault MD 450 Ouragan, Dassault Mystere, Mirage III/V, Dassault Étendard IV and Dassault Super Étendard, Sud Aviation Vautour, Mirage F1, SEPECAT Jaguar, and the Mirage 2000 series. It was also used on Israeli Douglas A-4E/F/H/N Skyhawks, IAI Nesher, IAI Kfir, and IAI Lavi, the Italian Fiat G.91Y and Aermacchi MB-326K, the Indonesian A-4, and the South African Atlas Cheetah and Impala Mk.II. Various gun pod installations are available from CASA, Dassault Aviation, and Matra.

The DEFA 550 is very similar to the British ADEN cannon, and can use the same ammunition.

The DEFA 550 series has given way to the GIAT 30 series used on the Dassault Rafale, although it is likely to remain in widespread use for many years.

==Variants==
* DEFA 551 for the Dassault Mystère IV, the Dassault Mystère IIC, and the Sud Aviation Vautour
* DEFA 552 for the Dassault Super Mystère B2, the Dassault Étendard IV, and the Aeritalia G.91Y
* DEFA 552A for the Mirage III/5/50, the Nesher/Dagger/Finger, the IAI Kfir, and the IAI Lavi
* DEFA 553 for the Dassault Mirage F1, the Alpha Jet, the SEPECAT Jaguar, the Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard, the Mirage 2000D RMV, the Aermacchi MB-326K, the CASA C-101, the Atlas Cheetah, the Impala Mk II, the IA-58B/C, and the IA-63
* DEFA 554 for the single-seat Mirage 2000, the AMX A-1, the IA-58D, and the IA-63

<text>Trent is a village and civil parish in northwest Dorset, England, situated in the Yeo valley northwest of Sherborne and four miles northeast of Yeovil. It was in Somerset until 1896. In the 2011 census the parish—which includes the hamlets of Adber and Hummer to the north—had a population of 317.

The parish was part of the Somerset hundred of Horethorne.

Charles II of England stayed at Trent House for several days during his escape to France in 1651.

The Trent Estate is owned by the Ernest Cook Trust, purchased by Ernest Cook in 1935 as the first of a number of English estates he purchased for their protection. The village has good architecture from the Medieval, Tudor, and later periods, with many trees in the background. The church of St Andrew is architecturally interesting and the lateral tower is topped by one of the three ancient stone spires of Dorset. The church was built in the 13th century and enlarged in the 14th and 15th centuries. Restoration and refitting was done about 1840 in a pre-Victorian way. Features of interest include the rood screen, the pulpit of continental origin, the 16th century bench ends and the old painted glass in the east window.

==People==
General Henry Rawlinson, who led the British Army at the Battle of the Somme, was born and is buried in the village.Geoffrey Fisher, former Archbishop of Canterbury, lived at Trent when he served in his retirement from episcopacy as an honorary assisting curate until his death in 1972 and is also buried at Trent. The actresses Kristin Scott Thomas and Serena Scott Thomas spent their childhoods in Trent.

<doc id="1077656" wikidata="Q7859007" url="?curid=1077656" title="Two Hearts (Men at Work album)">
<text>Two Hearts is the third and final studio album by Australian rock group Men at Work, released on 23 April 1985. Drummer Jerry Speiser and bassist John Rees had left the band prior to the album&#x27;s production, while guitarist Ron Strykert left the band during recording sessions. Touring behind the album saw sole remaining members Colin Hay and Greg Ham joined by guest musicians. It peaked at No. 16 in Australia, and No. 50 on the US chart.

==Background==
During 1984 the band took a break as members pursued other interests. Upon reconvening later that year, tensions during rehearsals between Hay and Speiser over songwriting and the band&#x27;s management led to a split in the band. Both Rees and Speiser were told they were &quot;not required&quot;, as Hay, Ham and Strykert used session musicians in their stead: primarily Jeremy Alsop on bass guitar (ex-Ram Band, Pyramid, Broderick Smith) and Mark Kennedy on drums (Spectrum, Ayers Rock, Marcia Hines). Strykert, though credited as a full band member on the finished album, left the group shortly before the album sessions ended, appearing on eight of the ten tracks.

==Reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; said &quot;Australia&#x27;s most successful (in America) pop band returns from a lengthy hiatus with a well-polished and oft times hard rocking effort which lends meat to the Men At Work legacy. Colin Hay&#x27;s quirky and distinctive vocals and lyrics are still intact and the groups&#x27; execution is much improved. Look for a good response to the singles &#x27;Everything I Need&#x27; and &#x27;Man with Two Hearts&#x27;.&quot;

In a brief retrospective review, &quot;Allmusic&quot;&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it &quot;a bland, synthesized variation on mainstream pop, featuring none of the melodic sensibilities or subtle humor of their first two albums.&quot;

==Tour==
Hay and Ham hired new band mates to tour in support of &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, with Alsop and Kennedy joined by James Black on guitar and keyboards (Mondo Rock, The Black Sorrows). Soon after a third guitarist, Colin Bayley (Mi-Sex), was added and Kennedy was replaced on drums by Chad Wackerman (Frank Zappa). Australian singers Kate Ceberano and Renée Geyer had also worked on the album and performed live as guest vocalists.
On 13 July 1985 Men at Work performed three tracks for the Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program)—&quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Overkill&quot;, and an unreleased one, &quot;The Longest Night&quot;. They were broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US. &quot;Maria&quot; and &quot;Overkill&quot; were also broadcast by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) during their Live Aid telecast. Ham left during the band&#x27;s time touring behind the album. The final Men at Work performances during 1985 had jazz saxophonist Paul Williamson (The Black Sorrows), replacing Ham. By early 1986 the band was defunct and Hay started recording his first solo album, &quot;Looking for Jack&quot; (January 1987), which had Alsop and Wackerman as session musicians.

<doc id="1077661" wikidata="Q897736" url="?curid=1077661" title="Division of Brand">
<text>The Division of Brand is an Australian electoral division in Perth, Western Australia. Brand was first created in 1984 and is named after Sir David Brand, Premier of Western Australia 1959-71. Brand governed Western Australia at a time when the state was developing its new mining and industrial base.

According to the 2006 census, Brand is the electorate with the lowest proportion (12.6%) of residents with a university qualification.

The current MP is Madeleine King, a member of the Australian Labor Party. She was first elected in 2016. Brand has remained a Labor stronghold since its inception, having never supported the Coalition.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The seat was created for the 1984 federal election from parts of the Divisions of Fremantle and Canning to cater for substantial population growth in the Rockingham–Mandurah coastal area south of the state capital Perth. Initially it included country areas to the south and southeast, such as agricultural regions in the Shires of Murray, Waroona and Harvey and the mining town of Collie, and was significantly more marginal for Labor—made abundantly clear by Labor&#x27;s near-defeat in the seat at the 1996 federal election. The redistribution for the 1998 election saw the electorate become an entirely urban seat, retreating north of the Peel Estuary to roughly its present boundaries, and the seat has been safe Labor ever since.

Brand has had four members —two of whom had previously been sitting members for other seats. Wendy Fatin had been the member for Canning for a single term prior to the creation of Brand, and went on to win in four successive elections, becoming Minister for the Arts in the early 1990s. Upon her retirement from politics, Kim Beazley, who had been Minister for Defence in the Hawke government until 1990 and had other portfolios before becoming Deputy Prime Minister to Paul Keating in 1995, was preselected for the seat following 16 years as member for the marginal seat of Swan which polling suggested the party was certain to lose. At the 1996 election, Beazley won by just 387 votes against Liberal candidate Penny Hearne, who was later to quit the party and run as an independent against Court minister Doug Shave in the 1996 state election for the seat of Alfred Cove. The third member was Gary Gray, from 2007 to 2016. On 25 March 2013, Gray was appointed to the Australian Cabinet as the Minister for Resources and Energy, the Minister for Tourism, and the Minister for Small Business. From 2010 until 2013, Gray served as the Special Minister of State and the Minister for the Public Service and Integrity.

The redistribution for the 2010 federal election made the seat slightly more secure for Labor by transferring some 12,000 Mandurah voters to the neighbouring Division of Canning. A redistribution ahead of the 2016 election removed the seat&#x27;s share of Mandurah altogether, increasing the Labor majority from 52 percent to 54 percent.

Gray retired in 2016, and Madeleine King retained the seat for Labor on a swing just under 8 percent.

In the 2021 redistribution, the electoral boundaries of Brand were left unchanged. Consequently, the 2016 boundaries continued to apply as of the 2022 election.

<text>The Ennepe () is a river, and a left tributary of the Volme in Northern Sauerland, Germany.

It gave its name to the town Ennepetal, and the district Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis.

==Course of River==
The Ennepe begins in the Märkischer Kreis southeast of Halver, at 422 m above sea level, and continues to the Ennepetalsperre (reservoir, 307 m above sea level).

The river flows through Ennepetal, Gevelsberg, and the western boroughs of Hagen.

It flows into the Volme, near Hagen Central Station (elevation: 99 m above sea level).

Parts of the river are canalized.
