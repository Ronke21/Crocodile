<text>Kinneret () is the name of an important Bronze and Iron Age city situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee, mentioned in the 14th century BC Aqhat Epic of Ugarit, and in the Old Testament and New Testament. Older Bible translations spell the name alternatively Kinnereth or Chinnereth, and sometimes in the plural as Chinneroth. In time the name became Gennesaret and Ginosar (). The remains of Kinneret have been excavated at a site called Tell el-&#x27;Oreimeh (Tell el-‘Orēme) in Arabic and Tel Kinrot in Modern Hebrew.

==Etymology==
===&quot;Kinneret&quot;===
====&quot;Kinnor&quot; instrument====
One theory is that Kinneret is derived from &quot;kinnor&quot;, an ancient Israelite musical instrument, on account of the shape of the lake resembling that of the instrument.

====Talmud====
According to the Jerusalem Talmud (Megillah 1:1), the name Kinneret is derived from the name of the &quot;kinnar&quot; trees which grow in its vicinity, explained by lexicographer M. Jastrow to mean the Christ&#x27;s thorn jujube (Ziziphus spina-christi), and by Moses Margolies to mean cane reeds.

Another Talmud passage says that it is so-called because its fruits are as sweet as those of the &quot;kinnara&quot; (Ziziphus spina-christi).

===&quot;Gennesaret&quot; and &quot;Ginosar&quot;===
Adrian Room sees the origin of &#x27;Ginosar&#x27; in a combination of Hebrew words, (&#x27;valley&#x27;) and either (&#x27;branch&#x27;) or (&#x27;to guard&#x27;, &#x27;to watch&#x27;).

The late-19th-century Easton&#x27;s Bible Dictionary offers a very different etymology, by stating that the initial Hebrew name &#x27;Kinneret&#x27;, in the plural &#x27;Kinnerot&#x27;, was Grecized to Gennesaret, with Ginosar as yet another transformation of the Hebrew name.

==Historical use of the name==
===The lake===
Due to its prominence, the city gave its name to the lake (the &quot;Sea of Galilee&quot;) for long periods of history, as the Sea of Kinneret, Kinnerot, Gennesaret, or Ginosar.

As other places around the lake rose to prominence, such as Tiberias and Qasr al-Minya, the name of the lake also changed to Lake Tiberias or Lake Minya (&quot;Bahr el-Minya&quot; in Arabic).

===The plain===
The name has also been used for the &quot;Plain of Gennesaret&quot;, which stretches south of the ancient city. The plain&#x27;s modern names are Plain of Ginosar in Hebrew and el-Ghuweir in Arabic.

===Modern settlements===
The Israeli Kibbutz Ginosar derives its name from the ancient town, though it is not located on its precise site. The settlements of Moshavat Kinneret and Kvutzat Kinneret are even further south, on the southwestern shore of the lake.

==Biblical and other ancient sources==
===Annals of Thutmose III===
Kinneret is mentioned as Kennartou in the 15th-century BCE Annals of Thutmose III at Temple of Karnak.

===Hebrew Bible===
Kinneret was a town allotted to the tribe of Naphtali (). The name appears in the singular form as &quot;Kinneret&quot; (, ) or in the plural as &quot;Kinneroth&quot; ().

===New Testament (Gospels)===
In the New Testament, the name appears changed to Gennesaret (in Matthew 14:34, Mark 6:53 and Luke 5:1; the latter refers to &quot;the Lake of Gennesaret&quot;). In Matthew and Mark, this city or area is a place where Jesus visited and performed healings. In Luke, he taught the crowds there and appointed his first four disciples.

The Douay-Rheims Bible uses the form &quot;Genesar&quot; in its translation of Matthew 14:34:
:&quot;And having passed the water, they came into the country of Genesar&quot;.

===Josephus and Babylonian Talmud===
Flavius Josephus, as well as the Babylonian Talmud mention the lake by the name &quot;Sea of Ginosar&quot; after the small fertile plain of Ginosar that lies at the foot of Tell el-&#x27;Oreimeh, ancient Kinneret. Josephus refers to the area as having very rich soil.

==Identification and location==
The site of the fortified Bronze and Iron Age city of Kinneret is identified with the mound known in Arabic as Tell el-&#x27;Oreimeh and in modern Hebrew as Tel Kinrot, halfway between Capernaum and Magdala. Situated on an important trade route, its elevated position meant that it also overlooked and guarded the Plain of Ginosar from its northern end.

The site has the ICS Coordinates: 200805-1252830; ca. 32.87000 N, 35.539312 E.

According to Sugimoto (2015), the Iron Age IB (tenth to mid-ninth centuries BC) cities in the northeastern region of the Sea of Galilee, including Tel Kinrot, likely reflect the activities of the Kingdom of Geshur, mentioned in the Bible. Also, the later Iron Age IIA–B cities here are linked with the southern expansion of the Aram-Damascus kingdom.

==History of archaeological exploration==
The tell was first explored by Paul Karge in 1911, with a main focus on prehistoric remains. Robert Köppel was the first to excavate (1932 and 1939), but only few results were published.

The premises of the future Mekorot pumping station and a number of spots at the foot of the hill were surveyed in the 1950s by Israeli archaeologists Gershon Edelstein and Bezalel Rabbani (published by Fritz, 1978). In the 1980s, Shan M. M. Winn of the University of Southern Mississippi and Jak Yakar of the University of Tel Aviv cut a small and deep trench near the shore, where they discovered the expected evidence of Early Bronze Age occupation (Winn &amp; Yakar, 1984). Volkmar Fritz of the University of Mainz/Giessen, Germany, then directed the first systematic and continuous excavations: 1982-1985 at the peak (&quot;acropolis&quot;), and in 1995-1999 and 2001 on the lower part of the southeastern slope of the tell (Fritz &amp; Münger, 2002).

In 2002, the Kinneret Regional Project (KRP) took over, continuing the work initiated by Volkmar Fritz on Tel Kinrot, as well as in the wider region around the site (Pakkala, Münger &amp; Zangenberg, 2004). The KRP is jointly run by the Universities of Berne (Switzerland), Helsinki (Finland), Mainz (Germany) and Leiden (Netherlands), and is directed by Stefan Münger, Juha Pakkala and Jürgen Zangenberg. Since 2008 excavations on Tel Kinrot have been &quot;temporarily halted&quot;, the KRP team dealing with analysis and publication while continuing the exploration of Horvat Kur and its surroundings.

<text>Daggubati Ramanaidu (6 June 1936 – 18 February 2015) was an Indian film producer known for his work in Telugu cinema. He founded Suresh Productions in 1964 which became of one of the largest film production companies in India. He was one of the most influential movie moguls in Indian cinema. He was placed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for the most films produced by an individual, with more than 150 films in all official Indian languages. He also served as a Member of Parliament for the Bapatla constituency in Andhra Pradesh in the 13th Lok Sabha from 1999 to 2004.

In 2012, Ramanaidu was conferred with the third-highest civilian award of India, the Padma Bhushan, in recognition for his contribution to Indian cinema. In 2009, he was conferred with the Dada Saheb Phalke Award, the highest award for films in Indian cinema. He has also received the Raghupathi Venkaiah Award, and the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award – South for his work in Telugu cinema. Ramanaidu contributed a substantial part of his earnings to numerous philanthropic purposes under the &quot;Ramanaidu Charitable Trust&quot; that was founded in 1991.

==Early life==
Daggubati Ramanaidu was born on 6 June 1936 in a Telugu Kamma family in Karamchedu, a village in Prakasam district in the present day Andhra Pradesh. He completed his schooling in the village and had his college education in Chirala and later graduated from Presidency College, Chennai.

He started his career as a rice-mill owner and later got into the transport business. During this time, his father joined with a relative and co-produced the Telugu film &quot;Nammina Bantu&quot; (1958), starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Savitri. He performed the dupe of Nageswara Rao in the film. Nageswara Rao advised him to go to Madras (now Chennai) and work with film-makers. He closed down his rice mill as he was not happy with it, and moved to Madras in 1962. He intended to start a brick business, but later switched to real estate. His frequent visits to the &quot;Andhra Club&quot; got him acquainted with the Telugu film fraternities.

==Film career==
In 1963, Ramanaidu partnered with his friends Tagirisa Hanumantha Rao, Yarlagadda Lakshmaiah Chowdary and co-produced the commercially unsuccessful &quot;Anuragam&quot; (1963). Following that, he established his own production house Suresh Productions, and produced &quot;Ramudu Bheemudu&quot; (1964). Until the early 1970s, he kept to Telugu cinema and made films such as &quot;Pratigna Palana&quot; (1965), &quot;Sri Krishna Tulabharam&quot; (1966), &quot;Shree Janma&quot; (1967), &quot;Paapa Kosam&quot; (1968) and &quot;Sepoy Chinnaiah&quot; (1969). &quot;Ramudu Bheemudu&quot; remained his only box office success during this period. While in Madras, he partnered with B. Nagi Reddy&#x27;s sons and formed a company called &quot;Vijaya Suresh Combines&quot; and made some films under that house.

In 1971, he produced &quot;Prem Nagar&quot;, starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Vanisri. The film went on to become a &quot;blockbuster&quot; and its success prompted Tamil and Hindi remakes entitled &quot;Vasantha Maligai&quot; (1972) and &quot;Prem Nagar&quot; (1974), respectively. Both versions were produced by him and became equally successful. &quot;Namma Kuzhaindagal&quot;, &quot;Tirumangalyam&quot;, &quot;Madhurageetham&quot;, &quot;Kuzhaindaikaga&quot; and &quot;Deiva Piravi&quot; are some of his Tamil productions that were made during the 1970s.

As all the studios were based in Madras at that date, he started &quot;Ramanaidu Studios&quot; in Hyderabad with the help of the state government in 1983. While frequently making films in Telugu and Tamil, he branched out into the Kannada, Hindi, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Oriya film, Gujarati, Bhojpuri, Assamese and Punjabi industries. His Hindi films include &quot;Dildaar&quot;, &quot;Tohfa&quot;, &quot;Anari&quot;, &quot;Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain&quot; and &quot;Aaghaaz&quot;.

As of 2015, he had made more than 130 films in 13 Indian languages. The feat earned him a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; in 2008. Ramanaidu also acted in a few films, mostly his own productions. He played a full-length role for the first time in the 2007 Telugu film &quot;Hope&quot;. The film, which dealt with teenage suicides arising out of educational stress among students, won the award for Best Film on Other Social Issues at the 54th National Film Awards.

==Family and personal life==

Ramanaidu got married in 1958 and had three children, two sons and a daughter. His elder son D. Suresh Babu is a producer and his younger son Venkatesh is an actor in Telugu cinema. He had eight grandchildren, two of whom – Rana and Naga Chaitanya – are actors in Telugu cinema.

Ramanaidu was a member of the Telugu Desam Party and represented Baptala constituency of Guntur district in the 13th Lok Sabha from 1999 to 2004. He lost the 2004 election for the same seat in the 14th Lok Sabha.

<doc id="1075728" wikidata="Q5501938" url="?curid=1075728" title="French Toast Crunch">
<text>French Toast Crunch is a breakfast cereal launched in the mid-1990s, flavored to taste like French toast, by the General Mills company. The cereal pieces originally looked like mini slices of French toast, but General Mills changed the cereal to a style similar in appearance to Cinnamon Toast Crunch; a thin, wavy square sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar flavoring. General Mills later reintroduced the original design.

In 2006, General Mills discontinued French Toast Crunch in the United States. Popular demand led General Mills to reintroduce the product on December 5, 2014.

During this time, French Toast Crunch was, and still is, produced and marketed in Canada as &quot;French Toast Crunch&quot; and &quot;Croque pain doré.&quot; Canadian French Toast Crunch is made in the original recipe and form (mini French toast).

==History==
The product was advertised for sale in the United States at least as early as December 1994, although media coverage suggests it was launched in mid-October or mid-November 1996.

French Toast Crunch has been described as crispy, sweetened corn cereal. The cereal pieces resembled tiny pieces of toast initially, and later became curved square pieces, as in its sister cereal, Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

On the back of the original French Toast Crunch cereal boxes, they discussed how the baking cartoon mascot, Wendell, created French Toast Crunch.
The back of the box reads:

:&quot;New French Toast Crunch - for a taste that will have you flipping! Wendell has cooked up an awesome new cereal with all the stuff you love. Delicious French toast cereal with syrup specially baked onto every crunchy piece. And each scrumptious piece looks and tastes like French toast! Grab your spoon, and discover this crunchy sensation - For a taste that will have you flipping.&quot;

==Advertisement==
TV commercials would ask questions regarding &quot;What makes French Toast Crunch?&quot; This question was answered with the following detailed response: 
:&quot;French Toast Crunch cereal... with a new syrup taste. Sweet syrup flavor over squares that crunch. An outrageous part of a good breakfast. French Toast Crunch... the taste you can see!&quot;

==Discontinuation and relaunch==
In 2006, French Toast Crunch was discontinued in the United States, but remained available in Canada and Australia.

On December 5, 2014, General Mills announced that they would return French Toast Crunch to nationwide production in the United States starting at the end of January 2015, with the cereal being available at selected supermarkets and retailers at this point in time. The design of the cereal flakes was reverted to the original style of miniature pieces of toast rather than plain squares.

In a statement posted on the General Mills website, they had the following to say about the cereal&#x27;s return:
: &quot;We have been overwhelmed by the consumer conversations, requests and passion for the cereal to come back. We value our fans and are so excited to be able to bring it back for them.&quot;

<doc id="1075732" wikidata="Q14711845" url="?curid=1075732" title="Nathan Eldon Tanner">
<text>Nathan Eldon Tanner (May 9, 1898 – November 27, 1982) was a Canadian politician and a leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1935 to 1952 as a member of the Social Credit caucus in government. He served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from 1936 to 1937 and as a cabinet minister in the governments of William Aberhart and Ernest Manning from 1937 to 1952, in various portfolios related to resource industries.

==Early life==
Tanner was born on May 9, 1898, in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Nathan William Tanner and Sarah Edna Brown Tanner. He had seven younger siblings. His family emigrated to Canada and had a farmstead in Aetna, south of Cardston, Alberta, where he grew up and attended grade school. He attended high school at Knight Academy in Raymond and received some postsecondary education at Calgary Normal School.

Tanner began his working life at a grocery store and butcher shop. He obtained a job teaching at a small school in Hill Spring in 1919. He met Sara Isabelle Merrill at the school and married her on December 20, 1919 and they became the parents of five daughters.

Along with teaching, Tanner also established his own general store, which later also became the local post office, to supplement his family income. The store was successful enough that he left his first teaching job in Hill Spring to run the store full-time.

Tanner eventually became a high school teacher and school principal in Cardston. He got his start in politics as a councillor on the Cardston Town Council.

==Political and business career==
Tanner was drafted to run for a seat to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for the first time in the 1935 general election. He ran as a Social Credit candidate in the electoral district of Cardston and defeated the incumbent United Farmers MLA George Stringam.

After the election and despite his complete lack of parliamentary experience, Tanner was chosen to be fifth-ever Speaker of the Alberta Legislature when the first session of the 8th Alberta Legislative Assembly began. He served in that role until January 5, 1937, when Premier William Aberhart appointed Tanner the Minister of Lands and Mines. His time in this capacity and as legislator spanned 16 years.

In the 1940 general election, Tanner defeated the independent candidate S.H. Nelson in a two-way race.

In the 1944 general election, Tanner won a three-way race.

In the 1948 Alberta general election, Tanner easily won a two-way race over the Liberal candidate Briant Stringam to hold his seat.

In 1949, Ernest Manning changed Tanner&#x27;s ministerial portfolio from Lands and Mines to Lands and Forests. Tanner was also appointed Minister of Mines and Minerals and held both portfolios until his retirement from the Legislature at its dissolution in 1952.

In 1952 Tanner left politics and became president of Merrill Petroleums in Calgary. In 1954 Manning and federal Minister of Trade and Industry C. D. Howe asked him to become president of TransCanada PipeLines Limited. During Tanner&#x27;s contract of five years, the TransCanada pipeline was built from Alberta to Montreal.

==LDS Church==
In 1960, Tanner was called as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a full-time LDS Church general authority. He had previous experience in church leadership, having served as a bishop, branch president, and stake president in Canada. In the church, he preferred to be referred to as &quot;N. Eldon Tanner.&quot; In 1962, the death of George Q. Morris created a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which Tanner was called to fill in October 1962. He was still the quorum&#x27;s junior member one year later when he was called into the First Presidency as second counselor to church president David O. McKay. Tanner remained in that position for the church presidency of Joseph Fielding Smith (1970–1972) and then became first counselor to Smith&#x27;s successor, Harold B. Lee and later to Spencer W. Kimball until Tanner&#x27;s death. He thus served as counselor to four church presidents. While Tanner was a member of the First Presidency, the membership numbers of the church grew from 1.7 million to 5 million.

Tanner was presented with the American Academy of Achievement’s Golden Plate Award at a ceremony in 1972 at Salt Lake City.

As the First Presidency, Kimball, Tanner, and Marion G. Romney announced the reception of the Revelation on Priesthood in June 1978, which established that being of black African descent would no longer be a barrier to ordination to the church&#x27;s priesthood. The announcement was canonized as &quot;Official Declaration 2&quot; in the church&#x27;s Doctrine and Covenants. Tanner formally presented the announcement for acceptance by the church at a general conference in October 1978.

Not long afterward, Tanner&#x27;s health deteriorated, and it became impossible for him to continue the duties of his office. Kimball and Romney were also ailing, and the decision was made to add Gordon B. Hinckley as an additional counselor to the First Presidency on July 23, 1981, with Neal A. Maxwell ordained to take Hinckley&#x27;s seat in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Tanner remained first counselor until his death on November 27, 1982, at the age of 84. Because of the appointments of Maxwell and Hinckley the prior year, no additional individuals were added to the First Presidency and no apostles were ordained as a result of his death.

<text>The Hot Shots is a collective name for two closely related Swedish dance companies based in Stockholm, Sweden: The Rhythm Hot Shots and the Harlem Hot Shots. The Hot Shots specialize in faithful reproductions of African-American dance scenes in American films from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s. Dances that they perform include Lindy Hop, Tap dance, Cakewalk, Charleston, and Black Bottom. The members of the Hot Shots are also respected dance instructors and accomplished social dancers. The goals of The Rhythm Hot Shots and the Harlem Hot Shots are the same.

On 6 May 2005, all of the current and previous members of the Hot Shots celebrated 20 years by performing &quot;20 Years With the Hot Shots&quot; at Södra Teatern in Stockholm.

==The Rhythm Hot Shots==
The Rhythm Hot Shots (TRHS, officially The Rhythm Hot Shots Dance &amp; Show Handelsbolag or TRHS Dance &amp; Show HB) is a Swedish performance dance company founded in 1985 and dissolved in 2002. Members of The Rhythm Hot Shots were instrumental in the 1980s and 90s Lindy Hop revival.

==History==

Anders Lind began studying at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden in 1978 and became interested in swing dance as a student. He became a member of the Swedish Swing Society (SSS, formed in 1978), a dance club that originally focused on competition and show. The Swedish Swing Society initially recruited dancers from Lasse Kühlers dance school. So when Lennart Westerlund started to dance at Lasse Kühlers dance school in 1980, he was recruited into the Swedish Swing Society in 1981, where he met Anders Lind. Lennart Westerlund, Catrine Lunggren, Anders Lind, and Lena Ramberg started to dance together in a small performance group as a part of the Swedish Swing Society in 1983.

Anders Lind became interested in searching for the history of the dance and in autumn 1983, he found a copy of &quot;Jazz Dance: The Story of American Vernacular Dance&quot; by Marshall and Jean Stearns in an unknown library in &quot;Dansmuseet&quot; (dance museum). Excited about the discovery, he copied three chapters of the book and handed them out to his fellow SSS members. Prior to finding &quot;Jazz Dance&quot;, everyone believed that Jitterbug was a dance that originated from the 1940s. They learned from the book that Jitterbug was originally called Lindy Hop and originated in Harlem, NY during the end of the 1920s.

At the age of 15, Eddie Jansson and Eva Lagerqvist started dancing at Lasse Kühlers dance school, where they met each other in 1983. After one year at the dance school, they joined the Swedish Swing Society. Eddie and Eva and another couple formed a group called Dance Freaks in spring 1984. Dance Freaks performed together one time before splitting up.

&quot;Jazz Dance&quot; listed several films that included Lindy Hop sequences. When A Day at the Races was shown in a theater in Stockholm, Anders and Lennart went to watch the movie. They found the dance sequences so exciting that they returned with a video camera to record all of the dance scenes. When Hellzapoppin&#x27; was shown at the KTH student theatre, they were in awe by the dancing in the film. The speed, acrobatics, and skill of the dancers was like nothing they had ever seen before. They started discussing a trip to New York City to find someone who could teach them how to dance the same way.

In April 1984, Anders Lind, Lennert Westerlund, and Henning Sörensen (Secretary for the Swedish Swing Society) travelled to New York City seeking Al Minns, a surviving member of Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers that Anders had found in &quot;Jazz Dance&quot;. While in Stockholm, Anders Lind had found a copy of the New York City yellow pages and torn out the pages listing dance schools. When they arrived in NYC, Anders Lind decided to call the dance schools that taught Lindy Hop. As luck would have it, the first dance school he called also happened to be the one that Al Minns taught it. They ended up meeting Al Minns two days later at a nightclub.

Count Basie had just died and his band members as well as the artists and dancers that had worked with him had planned a memorial dance in his honor at The Red Parrot, a nightclub in New York City. Anders Lind learned about the event and the three Swedes showed up at the nightclub and found Al Minns dancing Lindy Hop there. Al Minns had started teaching at Sandra Cameron Dance Center in 1982 and invited them to his dance class. Anders Lind also took the opportunity to take some classes with Norma Miller. When they returned to Sweden, Henning recommended to the board members of the Swedish Swing Society to invite Al Minns to Stockholm to teach and give lectures. Despite having a fear of flying, Al Minns traveled to Sweden in October 1984 for a 5-day workshop and brought a different approach to the dance with him. He told them to &quot;Forget counting, just listen!&quot;.

During the summer of 1984, the Swedish Swing Society arranged for the SSS performance group to perform for a few shows during the Stockholm Jazz Festival. The group asked Eddie and Eva to join them and for their first performance, the three couples performed on the main stage in front of 2000 people while accompanied live by The Harlem Blues &amp; Jazz Band. The performances were very successful and afterwards the three couples considered working together in the future, perhaps at a professional level.

After months of discussion, Lennart Westerlund, Anders Lind, Eddie Jansson, Catrine Ljunggren, Lena Ramberg and Eva Lagerqvist decided to form a dance company in the summer of 1985 when The Harlem Blues &amp; Jazz Band returned to Stockholm. They called themselves The Rhythm Hot Shots. Lennart danced with Catrine, Eddie danced with Eva, and Anders danced with Lena.

Al Minns was invited back to Stockholm in 1985 but he became too ill to travel and died on 24 April 1985. From Al Minns, TRHS learned that Frankie Manning, another surviving member of Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers, was also living in New York City. In 1986, Lennart contacted Frankie Manning and in 1987, invited Frankie to Sweden for the first time to work with the dance company.

Before Frankie Manning visited Sweden, The Rhythm Hot Shots had learned how to Lindy Hop by watching old movies in slow motion, such as Hellzapoppin&#x27; and A Day at the Races. They would spend four hours watching a film clip on TV just to learn one or two dance steps. They trained together intensively six days a week for several hours. When Frankie Manning visited Sweden in 1987, he stayed for two weeks. At that time, Lena had left the dance company and Ewa Staremo partnered Anders. Since two members of TRHS now had first names that were pronounced the same way – Eva Lagerqvist and Ewa Staremo – Frankie nicknamed Ewa Staremo &quot;W&quot; to quickly differentiate the two. The members of TRHS had regular day jobs so during the first week of Frankie&#x27;s visit, they met after work at around 16:00 or 17:00 and worked together for four to five hours every night. During the second week, they moved to Herräng, where the Swedish Swing Society had been holding a small dance camp, the Herräng Dance Camp, since 1982. They stayed and practiced in Folkets Hus, the community center in Herräng. During those two weeks, TRHS learned for the first time how to social dance.

In 1989, TRHS became involved with organizing the Herräng Dance Camp with the Swedish Swing Society. They invited Frankie Manning back to Sweden to teach at the dance camp, where he has returned to every year since then.

During the 1990s, TRHS achieved international fame and traveled worldwide to perform and teach at dance camps and workshops in North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. The Lindy Hop routine from Hellzapoppin&#x27; that they had originally learned in the early 1980s became their hallmark routine that they both performed and taught internationally.

Members of TRHS were the first international instructors to teach Lindy Hop in the former Soviet Union. On 5 April 2000, Lennart Westerlund, Catrine Lunggren, Mattias Lunmark, Åsa Palm, and Hanna Zetterman traveled to St Petersburg, Russia to help introduce Lindy Hop to 15 to 20 Russian dancers during a six-day workshop made possible by a grant from the Swedish Institute. All of the Russian dancers who attended the workshop were then awarded scholarships to attend the Herräng Dance Camp during the summer of 2000. Since then, Lindy Hop has spread to Ukraine and Lithuania.

During the late 1990s/early 2000s, several new members joined TRHS while some older members became inactive and no longer performed or taught classes, but were still members of the dance company. The 2002 Herräng Dance Camp, which TRHS owned, almost ended in bankruptcy. In autumn 2002, The Rhythm Hot Shots dance company was dissolved. The Rhythm Hot Shots Dance &amp; Show Handelsbolag (organisationsnr 969607-7073) was unregistered and in 2004, &quot;The Rhythm Hot Shots&quot; trademark was transferred from The Rhythm Hot Shots Dance &amp; Show Handelsbolag to Lennart Westerlund, Catrine Ljunggren, Eddie Jansson, Ulrika Larsdotter Ericsson, and Eva Lagerqvist Jansson.

The Harlem Hot Shots was formed by active members of TRHS in autumn 2002. Individuals who did not become members of the Harlem Hot Shots – such as Catrine Ljunggren, Eddie Jansson, Eva Lagerqvist Jansson, and Ulrika Larsdotter Ericsson – continue to teach and perform worldwide. For example, in 2006, Catrine Ljunggren helped organize the first international Lindy Hop festival in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The dance camp ran from December 1 to 3 and was so successful that it is planned to be repeated again in December 2007.

==Swedish Swing Society==
The Swedish Swing Society (SSS) is a non-profit dance organization in Stockholm, Sweden that teaches Lindy Hop and other swing related dances. As the major swing dance society in Stockholm, most swing dancers have been a member of the SSS, and the Hot Shots are no exception. The Hot Shots and SSS have had a very close relationship from the beginning of the Hot Shots, with cross-memberships in both organizations. For example, the founders of The Rhythm Hot Shots were also members of the SSS. Almost all of the Hot Shots are either current or past members of the SSS, as well as current or past instructors for the SSS, such as Lena Ramberg, Frida Segerdahl, and Sakarias Larsson.

Some of the Hot Shots have been elected as honorary members of the SSS: Lennart Westerlund (1990-11-14), Anita Kankimäki (1993-11-27), and Anders Lind (1998-11-21). Other honorary SSS members that were important in the history of the Hot Shots include Lasse Kühler and Henning Sörensen (1998-11-21).

==Herräng Dance Camp==

The Rhythm Hot Shots hosted the annual Herräng Dance Camp from 1989 until 2002, a dance camp in Herräng, Sweden that attracts students and teachers from all over the world. Since the 2003 dance camp, Lorenz Ilg (originator of Swing City) and members of the Harlem Hot Shots (Fatima Teffahi, Frida Segerdahl, Daniel Heedman, and Lennart Westerlund) organize and run the Herräng Dance Camp.

==Jesses Jassklubb==

For several years The Rhythm Hot Shots and later the Harlem Hot Shots ran Jesses Jassklubb (also known as Jesses Jazzklubb, Jesses Jazz Club, Jesse&#x27;s Jazz Club), a swing dance party held every Wednesday evening during the autumn and spring months. The autumn program was typically from September to early December and the spring program was from late January to late May. From 18:30 to 19:30, there was a drop-in beginner Lindy Hop dance lesson with members of TRHS/HHS and from 20:00 to 23:00 there was a swing/jazz band with DJed music between band breaks.

Jesses Jassklubb was named after its founder, Jens &quot;Jesse&quot; Lindgren (trombone player in Kustbandet and other bands). According to Jens Lindgren, the word &quot;jazz&quot; was spelled with s instead of z because originally it was spelled &quot;jass&quot; in New Orleans, and it helped emphasize the type of music played at the club.

For more than 11 years, Jesses Jassklubb was located at Mariahissen, Pryssgränd 14 in central Stockholm. The Mariahissen location featured a medium-sized hardwood dance floor, minimal food service, and a beautiful view of Gamla stan. On 14 April 2004 Jesses Jassklubb was held at the Mariahissen location for the last time. On 2 June 2004, Jesses Jassklubb reopened again at Hornsgatan 75, Stockholm, the current location of the Chicago Swing Dance Studio. However, the jazz club had to immediately close again since the Hornsgatan location needed additional sound insulation before another dance could be held. When the Wednesday night dances started again in autumn at a different location, the name changed to Zacke&#x27;s Jazz Corner.

==Zacke&#x27;s Jazz Corner==

On 8 September 2004, the Harlem Hot Shots continued the tradition of Wednesday night swing dances at a new location: Garant festvåning, Varvsgatan 14, Stockholm with Hasse Ling and his Syncopators of Swing. This new dance location become known as Zacke&#x27;s Jazz Corner and was named after Sakarias Larsson, one of the founders of the Harlem Hot Shots. When the dances were moved to Chicago Swing Dance Studio at Hornsgatan 75 on 16 February 2005, they were originally referred to as &quot;Jesses, Zackes, Savoy, or whatever you want to call it.&quot; Zacke&#x27;s Jazz Corner was the name that prevailed and is used today to refer to the Wednesday night swing dances at Chicago.

==Hornsgatan 75==

In March 2004, Lennart Westerlund took over the contract for Hornsgatan 75 in central Stockholm, originally the location of a movie theater by the name of Chicago (from 1907 to mid-1960s). When members of the Harlem Hot Shots took over the locale, they slowly remodeled and created a dance studio with an old-fashioned nightclub atmosphere called Chicago Swing Dance Studio. The locale is 350 m2 with a dance floor that is approximately 180 m2 and includes an office, storage area, kitchen, rest rooms, and a sitting area.

Chicago Swing Dance Studio opened in May 2004 for dance classes in Lindy Hop, tap dance, and classic jazz dance. Other dances that have also been taught include Salsa, Tango Argentino, and West African dance.

The Herräng Dance Camp office moved from Vetegatan 5 to Hornsgatan 75 in the summer of 2004.

When the HHS attempted to move Jesses Jassklubb to Hornsgatan 75 on 2 June 2004, it became apparent that additional sound insulation was needed before more dances could be held there. During the summer and autumn of 2004, the HHS increased the sound insulation, added ventilation, and redesigned the interior of the locale. Jesses Jassklubb, which had during autumn 2004 become known as Zacke&#x27;s Jazz Corner, moved back to Hornsgatan 75 on 16 February 2005.

==Competition results==
The Hot Shots seldom enter dance competitions as their primary objective is dance performances. On occasion, members of the group compete, sometimes with partners that are not members of the Hots Shots. Some members act as judges at Lindy Hop competitions and thus do not compete.

==Trivia==
* Hanna Zetterman grew up in Herräng, the home of the Herräng Dance Camp. One year she decided to find out why so many strange people invaded her home town each summer for the dance camp. She has continued to dance since that time.
* Fatima Teffahi is the first member of the Hot Shots whose specialty, tap dance, is not a partner dance.
* The tallest member of the Harlem Hot Shots, Sakarias Larsson (188 cm), dances with the shortest member, Frida Segerdahl.
* In 2005, Sakarias Larsson and Hanna Zetterman were chosen to appear in the first run of Floor Filler, a Swedish reality TV show with dancers competing to be Sweden&#x27;s most popular dancer. Mattias Lundmark also auditioned but was not chosen as one of the final 24 contestants. Hanna decided to drop out of the show before the first program since the contestants were required to live in a building in downtown Stockholm 24/7 and she instead preferred to continue her education. Sakarias remained in the program for a little longer than four weeks before being eliminated.
* For the 2005 Floor Filler TV show, the competition was judged by the BouncE Streetdance Company, a dance group formed by David Dalmo and other dancers in 1997. Lindy Hop was the second dance featured on Floor Filler and was taught by David Dalmo and Åsa Rickardsson. Not surprisingly, Sakarias and his partner won the Lindy Hop competition and gained immunity from being eliminated from the show that week.
* Members of the Harlem Hot Shots (Frida Segerdahl, Sakarias Larsson, Hanna Zetterman, Mattias Lundmark, Åsa Palm, Daniel Heedman) appeared in the finals of Talang 2007, a Swedish televised talent contest. They revealed during the final episode of Talang 2007 that Hanna and Mattias plus Åsa and Daniel were couples.

<text>Judith Ngaire Tizard (born 3 January 1956) is a former New Zealand politician, and a member of the Labour Party.

==Early life and career==
Tizard was born at Auckland&#x27;s St Helen&#x27;s maternity hospital in Pitt Street in 1956. She was educated at Glendowie College. Born into a political family, her mother, Dame Catherine Tizard, served as Mayor of Auckland and as Governor-General and her father, Bob Tizard, was a prominent Labour Party cabinet minister and Deputy Prime Minister. She followed her parents into politics, joining the Labour Party herself in 1973.

After moving from Auckland to Wellington, when her father became a cabinet minister, Tizard began studying politics at Victoria University and got a job in the Labour Party Research Unit from 1976 to 1977. She became more enthusiastic about her work, spending more time in that than study before returning to Auckland and working as a cook in a restaurant owned by one of her friends. She was elected a member of the Auckland Electric Power Board in 1977, remaining a member until 1983. Her mother commented that it was &quot;...another telling demonstration of the power of a recognisable name on a ticket. As she (Judith) said herself, who in their right mind would elect a 21-year-old barmaid to run a power board? That&#x27;s how she had described herself on the ticket.&quot;

Later, Tizard finished her Bachelor of Arts (BA) in History from the University of Auckland. She became a waitress, restaurant owner, and manager of O&#x27;Connells Restaurant on O&#x27;Connell St in Auckland (1978–1982), and was involved in the catering industry (1981–1984). In 1986 she stood unsuccessfully for a seat on the Auckland City Council in 1986 in the central ward, but narrowly missed out on election. She was elected a member of the Auckland Regional Council in 1988. She was re-elected in 1989 before resigning in 1991.

==Member of Parliament==


Tizard stood unsuccessfully for the safe National seat of in the . She was an electorate secretary in the electorate for Helen Clark from 1984 to 1987. In 1986 Tizard sought the Labour nomination for the seat of , but lost out to Ross Robertson. At the she contested Remuera again. Election night projections suggested she had taken the seat off National; ultimately she reduced the majority of Doug Graham to just 406 votes. She was the only Labour candidate to come remotely close to winning Remuera. From 1987 to 1990 she was an electorate secretary in the electorate for her father. From 1987 to 1989 she was vice-president of the Auckland Regional Council of the Labour Party.

On his retirement she succeeded her father as Labour&#x27;s candidate for Panmure. She entered Parliament at the 1990 election and in November 1990 she was appointed Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for Immigration and Arts &amp; Culture by Labour leader Mike Moore. After being re-elected in 1993, she shifted her candidacy to , which she won in the 1996 election, defeating Sandra Lee. In 1993, Tizard was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. In 1999, Tizard served as the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on Auckland issues, which would develop into the portfolio of Minister for Auckland Issues in 2002.

She became a Minister outside of Cabinet, serving as Minister of Consumer Affairs, Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Associate Minister of Transport, Associate Minister of Commerce, and Minister responsible for Archives New Zealand and the National Library.

Before the 2008 general election Tizard was placed 38th on Labour&#x27;s list, a relatively low one for a minister. She was then defeated in her electorate by National&#x27;s Nikki Kaye by a margin of 1,497 votes. Due to the scale of Labour&#x27;s defeat that year, her list placing was too low to allow her to remain Parliament as a list MP; her only chance of returning would be if Labour list MPs quit.

On 25 March 2011, Labour list MP Darren Hughes resigned from Parliament. Whilst Tizard was next in line, Labour Party president Andrew Little expressed preference for Louisa Wall to replace Hughes as she intended to contest the 2011 general election, unlike Tizard and the four other list candidates preceding Wall (Mark Burton, Mahara Okeroa, Martin Gallagher and Dave Hereora). Tizard, like her lower-ranked colleagues, decided not to take the seat.

Tizard now works in the constituency office of Phil Twyford, incumbent Member for Te Atatū.

==Controversy==

In 2008 Tizard championed an amendment to the Copyright Act, which required internet service providers (ISPs) to develop policies to terminate the Internet account of repeat copyright infringers. She defended this position when meeting Internet lobby groups, saying it is necessary to protect New Zealand artists, and referred to the release of New Zealand film &quot;Sione&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, which, she claimed, was damaged by unlawful distribution on the Internet.

On 16 October 2008, a press release was published by Tizard responding to &quot;alarmist claims made by a small group of IT commentators in the media that recent amendments to the Copyright Act would have ISPs cutting off the accounts of their users based on unsubstantiated accusations of copyright infringement. [...] This is quiet [sic] simply untrue, and I am sure they know it.&quot; That press release seems to have been retracted.

On 23 March 2009, the Prime Minister John Key announced that the law would not take effect and would be re-written.

==Personal life==
In 1993, aged 37, Tizard had a hysterectomy and surgery for uterine cancer from which she recovered.

As a delegate in the frame of cultural exchange, he successfully represented Austria in many countries. Since 1978 he has been married to Haya Heinrich. He has four sons, Nuriel, Elior, Ilan and Nadiv. Since 1980 Samy Molcho has been teaching at the International Summer Academy for Mime and well as the techniques of mime in Israel. He graduated from an actor&#x27;s school as well as from a seminar for directors and drama and was – from 1952 – dancer at the Jerusalem Dance Theatre of Rina Nikowa. From 1956 he was solo dancer for modern dance in Tel Aviv.

He worked as an actor at the Cameri Theatre and at the Israeli National Theatre Habimah. 1960 he had his first one-man mime performance in Tel Aviv.

<doc id="1075803" wikidata="Q1231796" url="?curid=1075803" title="Squirrel-cage rotor">
<text>A squirrel-cage rotor is the rotating part of the common squirrel-cage induction motor. It consists of a cylinder of steel laminations, with aluminum or copper conductors embedded in its surface. In operation, the non-rotating stator winding is connected to an alternating current power source; the alternating current in the stator produces a rotating magnetic field. The rotor winding has current induced in it by the stator field, as happens in a transformer, except that the current in the rotor is varying at the stator field rotation rate minus the physical rotation rate. The interaction of the magnetic fields in the stator and the currents in the rotor produce a torque on the rotor. 

By adjusting the shape of the bars in the rotor, the speed-torque characteristics of the motor can be changed, to minimize starting current or to maximize low-speed torque, for example. 

Squirrel-cage induction motors are very prevalent in industry, in sizes from below up to tens of megawatts (tens-of-thousand horsepower). They are simple, rugged, and self-starting, and maintain a reasonably constant speed from light load to full load, set by the frequency of the power supply and the number of poles of the stator winding. Commonly used motors in industry are usually IEC or NEMA standard frame sizes, which are interchangeable between manufacturers. This simplifies application and replacement of these motors.

==History==
Galileo Ferraris described an induction machine with a two-phase stator winding and a solid copper cylindrical armature in 1885. In 1888, Nikola Tesla received a patent on a two-phase induction motor with a short-circuited copper rotor winding and a two-phase stator winding. Developments of this design became commercially important. In 1889, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky developed a wound-rotor induction motor, and shortly afterwards a cage-type rotor winding. By the end of the 19th century induction motors were widely applied on the growing alternating-current electrical distributions systems. 

== Structure ==
The motor rotor shape is a cylinder mounted on a shaft. Internally it contains longitudinal conductive bars (usually made of aluminium or copper) set into grooves and connected at both ends by shorting rings forming a cage-like shape. The name is derived from the similarity between this rings-and-bars winding and a squirrel cage. 

The solid core of the rotor is built with stacks of electrical steel laminations. The figure shows three of many lamination sets used. The rotor lamination has a larger number of slots than its corresponding stator lamination, and the number of rotor slots should be a non-integer multiple of the number of stator slots to prevent magnetic interlocking of rotor and stator teeth at the starting instant.
The rotor bars may be made of either copper or aluminium. A very common structure for smaller motors uses die cast aluminium poured into the rotor after the laminations are stacked. Larger motors have aluminium or copper bars which are welded or brazed to end-rings. Since the voltage developed in the squirrel cage winding is very low, and the current very high, no intentional insulation layer is present between the bars and the rotor steel.

== Theory ==
The field windings in the stator of an induction motor set up a rotating magnetic field through the rotor. The relative motion between this field and the rotor induces electric current in the conductive bars. In turn these currents lengthwise in the conductors react with the magnetic field of the motor to produce force acting at a tangent orthogonal to the rotor, resulting in torque to turn the shaft. In effect the rotor is carried around with the magnetic field but at a slightly slower rate of rotation. The difference in speed is called &quot;slip&quot; and increases with load.

===Skewing===
The conductors are often skewed slightly along the length of the rotor to reduce noise and smooth out torque fluctuations that might result at some speeds due to interactions with the pole pieces of the stator, by ensuring that at any time the same fraction of a rotor bar is under each stator slot. If rotor bars were parallel to the stator poles, the motor would experience a drop and then recovery in torque as each bar passes the gap in the stator.

The laminations shown in the photo have 36 bars in the stator and 40 bars in the rotor. The greatest common divisor of 36 and 40 is 4, with the result that no more than 4 bars of the stator and rotor can be aligned at any one time, which also reduces torque fluctuations.

The number of bars in the rotor determines to what extent the induced currents are fed back to the stator coils and hence the current through them. The constructions that offer the least feedback use prime numbers of rotor bars.

===Laminations===
The iron core serves to carry the magnetic field through the rotor conductors. Because the magnetic field in the rotor is alternating with time, the core uses construction similar to a transformer core to reduce core energy losses. It is made of thin laminations, separated by varnish insulation, to reduce eddy currents circulating in the core. The material is a low carbon but high-silicon iron with several times the resistivity of pure iron, further reducing eddy-current loss, and low coercivity to reduce hysteresis loss.

===Rotor bars===
The same basic design is used for both single-phase and three-phase motors over a wide range of sizes. Rotors for three-phase will have variations in the depth and shape of bars to suit the design classification. Generally, thick bars have good torque and are efficient at low slip, since they present lower resistance to the EMF. As the slip increases, the skin effect starts to reduce the effective depth and increases the resistance, resulting in reduced efficiency but still maintaining torque.

The shape and depth of the rotor bars can be used to vary the speed-torque characteristics of the induction motor. At standstill, the revolving magnetic field passes the rotor bars at a high rate, inducing line-frequency current into the rotor bars. Due to the skin effect, the induced current tends to flow at the outer edge of the winding. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency decreases and induced current flows at greater depths in the winding. By tapering the profile of the rotor bars to vary their resistance at different depths, or by constructing a double squirrel cage, with a combination of high and low impedance rotor in parallel the motor can be arranged to produce more or less torque at standstill and near its synchronous speed.

==Practical demonstration==
To demonstrate how the cage rotor works, the stator of a single-phase motor and a copper pipe (as rotor) may be used. If adequate AC power is applied to the stator, an alternating magnetic field will revolve around within the stator. If the copper pipe is inserted inside the stator, there will be an induced current in the pipe, and this current will produce a magnetic field of its own in the pipe. The interaction between the stator&#x27;s revolving magnetic field and the copper-pipe-rotor&#x27;s induced magnetic field produces a torque and thus rotation.

== Use in synchronous motors ==
A synchronous motor may have a squirrel-cage winding embedded in its rotor, used to increase the motor starting torque and so decrease the time to accelerate to synchronous speed. The squirrel cage winding of a synchronous machine will generally be smaller than for an induction machine of similar rating. When the rotor is turning at the same speed as the stator&#x27;s revolving magnetic field, no current is induced into the squirrel-cage windings and the windings will have no further effect on the operation of the synchronous motor at steady-state.

The squirrel cage winding in some machines provides a damping effect for load or system disturbances, and in this role may be designated as an amortisseur windings. Large machines may only have amortisseur bars in the individual pole faces, not interconnected between poles. Because the squirrel cage winding is not large enough to dissipate the heat of continuous operation, large synchronous machines often have protective relays to detect when the machine has fallen out of synchronization with the supply voltage.

== Induction generators ==
Three phase squirrel cage induction motors can also be used as generators. For this to work the motor must see a reactive load, and either be connected to a grid supply or an arrangement of capacitors to provide excitation current. For the motor to work as a generator instead of a motor the rotor must be spun faster than its stator&#x27;s synchronous speed. This will cause the motor to generate power after building up its residual magnetism.

<doc id="1075807" wikidata="Q1519203" url="?curid=1075807" title="Battle of Mobile Bay">
<text>The Battle of Mobile Bay of August 5, 1864, was a naval and land engagement of the American Civil War in which a Union fleet commanded by Rear Admiral David G. Farragut, assisted by a contingent of soldiers, attacked a smaller Confederate fleet led by Admiral Franklin Buchanan and three forts that guarded the entrance to Mobile Bay: Morgan, Gaines and Powell. Farragut&#x27;s perhaps apocryphal order of &quot;Damn the torpedoes! Four bells. Captain Drayton, go ahead! Jouett, full speed!&quot; became famous in paraphrase, as &quot;Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!&quot;

The battle was marked by Farragut&#x27;s seemingly-rash but successful run through a minefield that had just claimed one of his ironclad monitors, enabling his fleet to get beyond the range of the shore-based guns. This was followed by a reduction of the Confederate fleet to a single vessel, ironclad . &quot;Tennessee&quot; proceeded to engage the entire Northern fleet. &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s armor enabled her to inflict more injury than she received, but she could not overcome the imbalance in numbers. She was eventually reduced to a motionless hulk and surrendered, ending the battle. With no navy to support them, the three forts also surrendered within days. Complete control of lower Mobile Bay thus passed to the Union forces.

Mobile had been the last important port on the Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi River remaining in Confederate possession, so its closure was the final step in completing the blockade in that region. This Union victory, together with the capture of Atlanta, was extensively covered by Union newspapers and was a significant boost for Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s bid for re-election three months after the battle. This battle concluded as being the last naval engagement in the state of Alabama in the war. It would also be Admiral Farragut&#x27;s last engagement.

==Mobile and Mobile Bay==
 The city of Mobile is situated near the head of Mobile Bay, where a natural harbor is formed by the meeting of the Mobile and Tensaw rivers. The bay is about long; the lower bay is about at its greatest width. It is deep enough to accommodate ocean-going vessels in the lower half without dredging; above the mouth of Dog River the water becomes shoal, preventing deep-draft vessels from approaching the city.

The mouth of the bay is marked on the east by a long narrow peninsula of sand, Mobile Point, that separates Bon Secour Bay, where the Bon Secour River enters the larger bay, from the gulf. The point ends at the main channel into Mobile Bay, and here the United States government erected a pre-war fort to shield Mobile from enemy fleets.

Across the entrance, the line of the peninsula is continued in a series of barrier islands, beginning with Dauphin Island. Northwest of Dauphin Island is Little Dauphin Island, then a series of minor islands that are interrupted by a secondary entrance to the bay, Grant&#x27;s Pass. A few other small islands and shoals lie to the south of Dauphin Island, defining the main channel for as much as south of the entrance.

Rather early in the war, the Confederate government decided not to defend its entire coastline, but rather to concentrate its efforts on a few of its most important ports and harbors. Following the loss of New Orleans in April 1862, Mobile became the only major port in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that needed to be defended.

The city subsequently became the center for blockade running on the gulf. Most of the trade between the Confederacy, Havana, and other Caribbean ports passed through Mobile. A few attempts were mounted to break the blockade, but they were not large enough to have lasting impact. Among the most embarrassing episodes of the war for the U.S. Navy was the passage of the raider through the blockade into Mobile Bay on September 4, 1862; this was followed by her later escape through the same blockade on January 15, 1863.

Although the orders given to Flag Officer David G. Farragut when he was assigned to command of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron had included instructions to capture Mobile as well as New Orleans, the early diversion of the squadron into the campaign for the lower Mississippi meant that the city and its harbor would not receive full attention until after the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863.

Given respite by the Union strategy, the Confederate Army improved the defenses of Mobile Bay by strengthening Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines at the entrance to the bay. In addition, they set up Fort Powell, a smaller work that guarded the Grant&#x27;s Pass channel. Grant&#x27;s Pass was also obstructed by a set of piles and other impediments, which had the effect of diverting the tidal flow to Heron Pass. 

==Confederate defenses==
===Land===
Mobile and Mobile Bay were within the Department of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana, led by Major General Dabney H. Maury. Although Mobile was the site of the department headquarters, Maury did not exercise immediate command of the forts at the entrance to the bay, and he was not present during the battle and ensuing siege. Local command was entrusted to Brigadier General Richard L. Page.

The primary contribution of the Confederate Army to the defense of Mobile Bay was the three forts. Fort Morgan was a masonry structure dating from 1834. The fort mounted 46 guns, of which 11 were rifled. Its garrison numbered about 600.

Across the main channel from Fort Morgan on Dauphin Island was Fort Gaines, containing 26 guns, and with a garrison of about 600. When Page was not present, command of the fort fell to Colonel Charles D. Anderson.

At the western end of the bay was Fort Powell, smallest of the three, with 18 guns and about 140 men. It was commanded in Page&#x27;s absence by Lieutenant Colonel James M. Williams. All three forts were flawed in that their guns were unprotected against fire from the rear; in addition, forts Powell and Gaines lacked adequate traverses.

The raw numbers of troops available do not indicate how effectively they would fight. The war was already winding down, and assertions were made that the morale of the soldiers was bad. The judgment is hard to quantify, but it would explain at least in part the poor performance of the defenders.

The Confederate Torpedo Bureau, directed by Major General Gabriel J. Rains, contributed a passive weapon to the defense. Men of the bureau had planted 67 &quot;torpedoes&quot; (naval mines) across the entrance, leaving a gap on the eastern side of the channel so blockade runners and other friendly vessels could enter or leave the harbor. The minefield was well marked by buoys, which Farragut knew well. Its purpose was not necessarily to sink enemy vessels trying to enter, but rather to force them to steer close to Fort Morgan and its guns.

The Confederate military also began construction in 1862 of two forts in Clarke County that were planned to prevent Union advancement into the interior of Alabama in the event that Mobile was captured. These forts, known as Fort Stonewall and Fort Sidney Johnston, also provided protection to the salt works in Clarke County, the Selma Naval Ordnance Works, and Montgomery.

===Sea===
The Confederate Navy likewise used the time they were given to improve the defense. Three small sidewheel gunboats of traditional type were stationed in the bay: , carrying four guns; , with six guns; and , also with six guns. In addition to these was the ironclad ram , which, though carrying only six guns, was a far more impressive fighting machine by virtue of her armor.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; had been built on the Alabama River near the town of Selma. Her guns were prepared under the direction of Commander Catesby ap Roger Jones, who had commanded (ex-USS &quot;Merrimack&quot;) in her famous duel with on March 9, 1862, the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads. Jones succeeded to command of &quot;Virginia&quot; after her original commander, Franklin Buchanan, was wounded the previous day. Buchanan had been promoted to the rank of admiral for his exploits that day, the first admiral in the Confederacy. Admiral Buchanan was now in command of the small Confederate flotilla at Mobile.

Launched before her machinery and guns were in place, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was towed down to Mobile Bay for completion. Once that was done she had to cross the Dog River Bar to get into the lower bay. &quot;Tennessee&quot; drew , but the bar had only of water at high tide. To get her across, workers had to build a set of caissons, called &quot;camels&quot; by shipbuilders. These were fitted to her sides and pumped out, and barely lifted the ship enough to clear the bar. On May 18, 1864, she finally entered the lower bay.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; was the only armored vessel that the Confederate Navy put into lower Mobile Bay, but there were plans for others. Buchanan hoped that he would have as many as eight, including a pair of floating batteries, with which he could challenge the Union blockade, attack Pensacola and perhaps even recapture New Orleans. The manufacturing and transportation facilities of the South were not capable of this ambitious program, however, some of the projected fleet were completed in time to defend Mobile after the lower bay had been lost, but they were not there when most needed. Nevertheless, they imparted some urgency to Farragut&#x27;s plans to maintain the blockade.

==The United States==
===Union Navy===
The man who led the Union fleet at Mobile Bay was Rear Admiral David G. Farragut, no longer Flag Officer Farragut. The U.S. Navy had undergone an organizational change in the second year of the war, one feature of which was the creation of the rank of rear admiral. The new rank implied that the ships of the navy would be employed as members of a fleet, not simply as collections of vessels with a common purpose.

The ships that made up his attacking fleet were of several distinct types, including some that had not even existed when the war began. Of the 18 vessels selected, eight were conventional wooden-hulled ships carrying large numbers of guns that fired broadside. Four of these had been with the West Gulf Blockading Squadron from the start (flagship , , , and ) and had fought in its battles on the Mississippi. Two smaller gunboats had likewise been with Farragut since the capture of New Orleans: and .

 was now very much like the others, but she had begun life as an experimental ironclad. Her armor had been found to be more hindrance than help, so it was removed. Three were double-enders (, , and ), a type of warship that had been developed during the war to navigate the tortuous channels of the interior rivers. Finally, four were representatives of the New Navy: ironclad monitors. Of these, and were improved versions of the original , armed with two large guns in a single turret. The and were twin-turreted river monitors of light draft; each mounted four guns that were smaller than those carried by the other two.

===Union Army===

Army cooperation was needed to take and hold the enemy forts. The commander of the Military Division of West Mississippi was Major General Edward Richard Sprigg Canby, a career soldier with whom Farragut worked in planning the attack on Mobile. He calculated that 5,000 soldiers could be taken from other responsibilities in the division, enough to effect a landing behind Fort Morgan and cut it off from communication with Mobile. Their plans were undercut, however, when General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant made an urgent call for troops to be sent to the Virginia theater, then entering its critical phase.

Canby then believed that he could spare no more than 2,000, not enough to invest the largest fort but enough to take Dauphin Island and thereby secure contact between the fleet inside the bay and their support in the gulf. Canby and Farragut recognized that they would not be able to threaten Mobile, but possession of the lower bay would be of great enough use to the blockading fleet that the projected attack should not be canceled.

Communication would be necessary between the fleet and the landing force, so Canby suggested that a contingent of his signal corpsmen be distributed among the major ships of Farragut&#x27;s attacking force. Farragut accepted the offer. This almost casual mingling of the services was found quite useful during the battle.

On August 3, 1864, 1,500 men were landed approximately 15 miles west of the fort in preparation for the Siege of Fort Gaines, while under protection from one of Farragut&#x27;s flotillas. The troops consisted of infantry detachments from the 77th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 34th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment, 96th Ohio Infantry, and 3rd Maryland Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, with General Gordon Granger as commander. The troops then marched toward Fort Gaines. On the evening of August 4, they entrenched and formed their skirmish line less than a half mile away.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===
===Confederate===
==Battle and siege==
The army landing force under Granger was ready to launch the attack on August 3, but Farragut wanted to wait for his fourth monitor, , expected at any moment but delayed at Pensacola. The admiral almost decided to proceed with only three monitors, and the army went ashore on Dauphin Island, acting under a misapprehension of naval intentions. The fleet was not ready to move yet, so the defenders were able to rush additional forces to Fort Gaines. After the battle, Farragut concluded that the delay had actually worked to the advantage of the Federal forces, as the reinforcements were not great enough to have any effect on the battle, but they were included in the surrender.

While the army was going ashore, &quot;Tecumseh&quot; made her belated appearance and Farragut made his final dispositions for the fleet. The 14 wooden-hulled vessels would be lashed together in pairs, in a reprise of a tactic that the admiral had used earlier at the Battle of Port Hudson at Port Hudson, Louisiana. The intent was that, if a ship were to be disabled by battle damage to her engines, her partner would be able to keep her moving.

The monitors would form a column and lead the way into the bay, moving in close to Fort Morgan on the right side of the channel as they went in. The other ships would form a separate double column and pass on the port side of the monitors, so that the armored ships would shield their wooden sisters from the guns of the fort. When the Confederate fleet made its expected appearance, the monitors would move to attack the armored &quot;Tennessee&quot;, while the rest of the fleet would fight the faster gunboats.

===Passing the forts===
At dawn on August 5, conditions were nearly ideal for the attack. The tide was running in, so Farragut had his ships reduce steam pressure in order to minimize damage if their boilers were hit; he relied on the current to give them speed. The southwest breeze that sprang up would carry smoke from the guns away from the fleet and into the faces of the artillerymen in Fort Morgan.

The fleet approached the fort with &quot;Tecumseh&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Winnebago&quot;, and &quot;Chickasaw&quot; in order leading the way. The second column was led by &quot;Brooklyn&quot; lashed to &quot;Octorara&quot;. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; had the lead because she carried four chase guns that could fire forward, while the other large ships had only two. She was also fitted with a device for removing mines, referred to as a &quot;cowcatcher&quot; by Farragut in his reports. Following were &quot;Hartford&quot; and &quot;Metacomet&quot;, &quot;Richmond&quot; and &quot;Port Royal&quot;, and , and &quot;Kennebec&quot;, and &quot;Itasca&quot;, and &quot;Oneida&quot; and &quot;Galena&quot;.

The Confederate ships were ready for the attack, and they moved into position to intercept the Union fleet just beyond the minefield. At 6:47 a.m., &quot;Tecumseh&quot; fired the first shot, the forts replied, and the action became general. The ships in the second column (except for &quot;Brooklyn&quot;) could not reply to the guns of the Confederate vessels, so they had to concentrate on the fort. Much of the damage done to the Federal fleet was caused by the enemy ships, perhaps because the fire from the fort was suppressed.
Shortly after the start of the action, monitor &quot;Tecumseh&quot; moved past the fort and toward &quot;Tennessee&quot;, apparently in obedience to that part of her orders. Commander Tunis A. M. Craven either disregarded or forgot the instruction to stay to the east of the minefield, so he took his ship directly across. Almost immediately, a torpedo went off under her hull, and she filled with water and sank in two or three minutes. Only 21 of her crew of 114 were saved. Craven was among those lost, so he could not explain his decisions.

Captain James Alden of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was apparently confused by conflicting orders, to stay on the port side of the monitors and to stay to the right of the minefield, so he stopped his ship and signaled Farragut for instructions. Farragut would not stop his flagship. Recognizing hesitation from his subordinate commanders, he took the bold action of ordering Captain Percival Drayton to send &quot;Hartford&quot; around &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and into the lead of the column and giving the order, “Damn the torpedoes, Full speed ahead!”. This took the ship into the torpedoes that had just sunk &quot;Tecumseh&quot;, but Farragut was confident that most of them had been submerged too long to be effective. His gamble paid off, and the entire column of 14 warships passed through unharmed. Several Union sailors reported hearing clicks of torpedo detonators when passing through.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; lacked the speed needed to ram the Union vessels as they passed, allowing Farragut to order some of his small, faster gunboats to attack the three Confederate gunboats. &quot;Metacomet&quot;, unleashed from &quot;Hartford&quot;, captured &quot;Selma&quot;. Fire from the gunboats holed &quot;Gaines&quot;, and she would have sunk had she not been beached; she was then burned by her crew. &quot;Morgan&quot; put up no resistance, but fled to the protection of the guns of Fort Morgan; next night she crept through the anchored Union fleet and escaped to Mobile.

===Clash with CSS &quot;Tennessee&quot;===
Farragut expected &quot;Tennessee&quot; to take shelter under the guns of Fort Morgan while he rested his ships and assessed battle damage in the middle of the bay, but Buchanan instead decided to take on the entire Federal fleet single-handed. Possibly he hoped to repeat the ramming tactics that had been so successful at Hampton Roads two years earlier; Buchanan did not explain his reasoning.

This time, the ships that he was facing were in motion, and he had to contend with three monitors, not one. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was so slow that she became the target of ramming rather than her opponents. Several of the Federal sloops managed to ram, including &quot;Monongahela&quot;, which had been fitted with an iron shield on her bow for just this purpose. None of the collisions harmed the ironclad; in every case, the ramming vessel suffered more. Shots from Farragut&#x27;s fleet bounced off &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s armor, but &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s fire was ineffective due to inferior powder and multiple misfires.

The balance was tilted finally when two monitors arrived. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was already almost motionless, her smokestack shot away and so unable to build up boiler pressure. Her rudder chains were parted so that she could not steer. Furthermore, some of the shutters on her gun ports were jammed, rendering the guns behind them useless. &quot;Chickasaw&quot; took up position at her stern, and &quot;Manhattan&quot; began to pummel the ram with her guns. The heavy shot bent in the iron shield and shattered its oak backing.
Fragments killed or wounded some of the crew; one of the casualties was Admiral Buchanan himself, who suffered a badly broken leg. No longer able to fight, Commander James D. Johnston, captain of &quot;Tennessee&quot;, requested and received permission from the wounded admiral to surrender. A little more than three hours had elapsed since &quot;Tecumseh&quot; had fired the first shot.

===Forts Powell and Gaines===

With the fleet no longer facing opposition from the Confederate Navy, Farragut could pay some attention to the forts. He dispatched monitor &quot;Chickasaw&quot; to throw a few shells at Fort Powell and then to assist the troops ashore at Fort Gaines. Although neither fort suffered significant casualties or damage, the bombardment was sufficient to reveal the vulnerability of each to fire from the rear.

At Fort Powell, Lt. Col. Williams asked for instructions from Brig. Gen. Page. Page responded with ambiguous orders that may have been appropriate for spirited troops, but were disastrous when issued to men as seemingly demoralized as those at Fort Powell: &quot;When no longer tenable, save your garrison. Hold out as long as you can.&quot; Williams was convinced that resistance was futile, so he spiked his guns and blew up his magazines; then he and his garrison waded to the mainland and made their way to Mobile.

Col. Anderson at Fort Gaines held out longer, although he faced a more formidable foe. Granger&#x27;s soldiers vastly outnumbered his own, no matter whose figures for the garrison are accepted. The Union troops could bring their artillery up to close range with impunity, being shielded behind the sand dunes of Dauphin Island. In position, they were able to take in reverse two guns that fired on Farragut&#x27;s fleet when it was entering the bay.

In the judgment of an engineering officer who inspected the fort after the Union army had taken possession, &quot;It was utterly weak and inefficient against our attack (land and naval), which would have taken all its fronts in front, enfilade, and reverse.&quot; Recognizing that his situation was hopeless, Anderson opened communication with Granger and Farragut under a flag of truce; ignoring orders from Page forbidding him to do so (and eventually removing him from command), he surrendered the fort on August 8.

===Siege of Fort Morgan===

As soon as the surrender of Fort Gaines was completed, Granger moved his force from Dauphin Island to the narrow strip of mainland behind Fort Morgan, where they were landed without opposition about away, well out of range of its guns. The fort was thus immediately invested, cut off from all communication with Mobile.

Granger set about taking the fort by regular approaches — that is, establishing a sequence of trenches or other protective lines drawn ever closer to the objective, until finally its walls could be breached and it could be taken by assault. His first line was a gift, a line of trenches from the fort that had been prepared by the garrison of the fort and then for some reason abandoned. It was a little farther than he would have liked, but it served quite well. Additional parallels were built with little interference, as the laborers could work behind the sand dunes.

While this was going on, monitors &quot;Winnebago&quot;, &quot;Chickasaw&quot;, and &quot;Manhattan&quot; were engaging in occasional bombardment. They were later joined by the former CSS &quot;Tennessee&quot;, captured on August 5, since repaired, and now renamed USS &quot;Tennessee&quot;. The most serious hindrance to the advance in this period was the weather; a storm on August 20 halted work for a while, and left standing water in low places. The fort was subjected to a day-long bombardment on August 22 from 16 siege mortars, 18 guns of various sizes, and the fleet, the monitors and &quot;Tennessee&quot; at short range and the rest of the ships at long range.
Inside the fort, Brig. Gen. Page feared that the bombardment would endanger his magazines, which contained of powder. To avoid the risk, he had the powder brought out and flooded. That night, the magazines were indeed threatened when the woodwork of the citadel caught fire. The fire brought an increase in the rate of bombardment, and was extinguished only with great effort.

Feeling now that further resistance was useless, on August 23 Page ordered his remaining guns spiked or otherwise destroyed as far as possible. At 6 AM, he ordered the white flag raised, and the siege was over.

==Incidents of the Battle of Mobile Bay==
===Farragut lashed to the rigging===
An anecdote of the battle that has some dramatic interest has it that Farragut was lashed to the mast during the passage of Fort Morgan. This event came about after the battle had opened and smoke from the guns had clouded the air. In order to get a better view of the action, Farragut climbed into &quot;Hartford&quot;″s rigging and soon was high enough that a fall would certainly incapacitate him and could have killed him. Seeing this, Captain Drayton sent a seaman aloft with a piece of line to secure the admiral. He demurred, saying, &quot;Never mind, I am all right,&quot; but the sailor obeyed his captain&#x27;s orders, tying one end of the line to a forward shroud, then around the admiral and to the after shroud.

Later, when CSS &quot;Tennessee&quot; made her unsupported attack on the Federal fleet, Farragut climbed into the mizzen rigging. Still concerned for his safety, Captain Drayton had Flag Lieutenant J. Crittenden Watson tie him to the rigging again. Thus, the admiral had been tied to the rigging twice in the course of the battle.

===&quot;Damn the torpedoes&quot;===

Most popular accounts of the battle relate that &quot;Brooklyn&quot; slowed when &quot;Tecumseh&quot; crossed her path, and Farragut asked why she was not moving ahead. The reply came back that naval mines (then called &quot;torpedoes&quot;) were in her path—to which he allegedly replied, &quot;Damn the torpedoes.&quot; The story did not appear in print until several years later, and some historians question whether it happened at all.

Some forms of the story are highly unlikely; the most widespread is that he shouted to &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Damn the torpedoes! Go ahead!&quot; Men present at the battle doubted that any such verbal communication could be heard above the din of the guns. More likely, if it happened, is that he said to the captain of &quot;Hartford&quot;, &quot;Damn the torpedoes. Four bells, Captain Drayton.&quot; Then he shouted to the commander of &quot;Metacomet&quot;, lashed to &quot;Hartford&quot;″s side, &quot;Go ahead, Jouett, full speed.&quot; The words have been altered in time to the more familiar, &quot;Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!&quot;

===Army signals===
Prior to the battle, the Army and Navy used completely different signals. The Navy used a cumbersome system of colored flags that would impart messages that had to be decoded, whereas the Army was experimenting with a far simpler wigwag system, recently developed by Col. Albert J. Myer. In order to communicate with Army forces ashore after the fleet was safely inside Mobile Bay, several members of the fledgling Signal Corps were put on the major ships of Farragut&#x27;s fleet. They were expected to stay out of the way until they were needed; those on &quot;Hartford&quot;, for example, were assigned to assist the surgeon, so they were stationed below decks.

When &quot;Brooklyn&quot; encountered her difficulties with &quot;Tecumseh&quot; and the minefield, Captain Avery of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; wanted clarification of his orders more rapidly than could be done with navy signals, so he asked his army representatives to relay his question to the flagship. In order to read the message, the signal corpsmen on &quot;Hartford&quot; were brought up from below, and they stayed up through the rest of the fight. Their contribution was acknowledged by Farragut.

===Court martial of Page===
After General Page surrendered Fort Morgan, the victors found that all of the fort&#x27;s guns had been spiked, and gun carriages and other supplies destroyed. Some believed that much of the damage had been done while the white flag was flying, in violation of the rules of war as they were then understood. The belief was so strong that Canby made a formal accusation, and Page was tried in New Orleans by a three-man council of war to consider the charges. After reviewing the evidence, the court found him not guilty of the charges.

==Aftermath==

The Battle of Mobile Bay was not bloody by standards set by the armies of the Civil War, but it was by naval standards. It was only marginally, if at all, less bloody than the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip and the Battle of Hampton Roads. The Federal fleet had lost 150 men killed and 170 wounded; on the Confederate ships, only 12 were dead and 19 wounded. Union Army losses were very light; in the siege of Fort Morgan, only one man was killed and seven wounded. Confederate losses, though not stated explicitly, seem to have been only slightly greater.

The continued presence of a Union Army force near Mobile constrained the Confederate Army in its last desperate campaigns. Maury realized that the numbers opposite him were inadequate for an attack, but the loss of Mobile would have been such a severe blow to the public mood that he would not send his guns or spare troops to support other missions.

This was particularly important to Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, who was at that time engaged in the Atlanta campaign. Because Mobile remained unconquered, the significance of Farragut&#x27;s victory initially had little effect on Northern public opinion. As time passed and a sequence of other Union victories seemed to show that the war was winding down, the battle began to loom larger.

When Atlanta fell, in the words of historian James M. McPherson, &quot;In retrospect the victory at Mobile Bay suddenly took on new importance as the first blow of a lethal one-two punch.&quot; The dispersal of Northern gloom assured President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s re-election in what was regarded as a referendum on continuation of the war.

With the capture of Fort Morgan, the campaign for the lower Mobile Bay was complete. Canby and Farragut had already decided before the first landings on Dauphin Island that the army could not provide enough men to attack Mobile itself; furthermore, the Dog River Bar that had impeded bringing &quot;Tennessee&quot; down now prevented Farragut&#x27;s fleet from going up. Mobile did come under combined army-navy attack, but only in March and April 1865, after Farragut had been replaced by Rear Adm. Henry K. Thatcher. The city finally fell in the last days of the war.

A number of Civil War-era shipwrecks from the battle and its aftermath remain in the bay into the present, including &quot;American Diver&quot;, , , , , , , and .

<doc id="1075810" wikidata="Q2920241" url="?curid=1075810" title="Margaret Wilson">
<text>Margaret Anne Wilson (born 20 May 1947) is a New Zealand lawyer, academic and former Labour Party politician. She served as Attorney-General from 1999 to 2005 and Speaker of the House of Representatives from 2005 to 2008, during the Fifth Labour Government.

==Early life and career==
Born in Gisborne, Wilson was raised in Morrinsville where her parents Bill and Patricia (Paddy) ran a small store. She was the eldest of four children. As a seven-year-old, she spent several months living in Auckland with her great-aunt and great-uncle after her father had a nervous breakdown. Wilson&#x27;s family were Catholic and Labour-voting; Bill&#x27;s father&#x27;s cousin was the Labor Party Premier of New South Wales, Bob Heffron.

Wilson returned to Auckland to receive secondary education at St Dominic&#x27;s College, and completed her final year as the only female student at Morrinsville College. She had a leg amputated due to cancer at the age of 16, which cut short her plans to be a physical education teacher. Instead, she studied law and graduated LLB(Honours) from the University of Auckland in 1970. Briefly, she worked as a law clerk and solicitor in Auckland from 1970 to 1972 (in 1971 she was secretary of the legal employees&#x27; union), before a master&#x27;s in jurisprudence on workers&#x27; participation in management in New Zealand was completed in 1974. In her memoir, Wilson reports that only seven in her undergraduate class of 200 were women; her female classmates included future Chief Justice of New Zealand Sian Elias and future judge of the Hong Kong Court of First Instance Clare-Marie Beeson. Future members of Parliament David Lange and Jim McLay were also in the cohort. Wilson began lecturing in the University of Auckland law faculty in 1972 and continued in lecturing roles until 1990 (latterly in a part-time capacity as she became more politically active).

Wilson campaigned for Eddie Isbey, the Labour Party candidate in Grey Lynn, in 1969 and 1972. In 1975, she spent a year studying for a doctorate at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto, Ontario, which she did not complete. Before her overseas studies, Wilson had begun to campaign for women&#x27;s rights; she returned to these aims in 1976 and joined the Labour Party as a means to those ends. She stood unsuccessfully for the Auckland City Council on a Labour Party ticket in both 1977 and 1980. In her memoir, Wilson reflected that future Prime Minister and her then-University of Auckland colleague Helen Clark encouraged her candidacy.

In the 1980s, Wilson was a senior figure in the extra-parliamentary Labour Party. She was elected as a women&#x27;s representative on the Labour Party Council for two one-year terms in 1980 and 1981 and to the vice-presidency in 1982. From 1984 to 1987, she was president of the Labour Party, the first woman to do so. She contributed to the party&#x27;s manifesto commitments on women&#x27;s equality, which included the establishment of the Ministry for Women&#x27;s Affairs, for the 1984 general election. It was suggested that Wilson stand for Parliament in 1987; she declined. Following her term as Labour president, she chaired the government&#x27;s working group on equal employment opportunities and equal pay, served on the Law Commission, and was appointed as a director of the Reserve Bank. Between 1989 and 1990, she worked as chief political advisor to the Prime Minister, Geoffrey Palmer.

Wilson established the University of Waikato School of Law as New Zealand&#x27;s fifth law school in 1990. She was its first Professor of law and founding Dean until 1999 when she became a Member of Parliament. Wilson was the first female Dean of a law school in New Zealand.

In 1993, Wilson was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

==Member of Parliament==

After nine years of a National-led Government, including three years of testing coalition arrangements, Labour anticipated forming a government after the 1999 election. Wilson&#x27;s former Auckland University colleague Helen Clark, now leader of the Labour Party, invited Wilson to stand for election on the Labour Party list, with a view to being the Attorney-General should Labour successfully form a new government. Wilson agreed and also stood for election in the Tauranga electorate, displacing Labour&#x27;s expected candidate, union organiser and former Tauranga Labour electorate committee chairman Terry Hughes. She placed third behind New Zealand First leader Winston Peters and National candidate Katherine O&#x27;Regan in a close race. Wilson sought a judicial recount as since New Zealand First won less than five percent of the party vote they would have no seats in parliament in at all if Peters lost the electorate (allowing Labour to govern solely with the Alliance and not needing the Greens). Peters criticised the recount as a waste of money. The recount resulted in Peters&#x27; majority increasing by one vote from 62 to 63.

As the ninth candidate on the Labour list, Wilson entered Parliament as a list MP and immediately gained election to the Cabinet. In addition to being appointed Attorney-General, she was additionally made Minister of Labour, Minister in charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, and associate minister for justice and state services. In the justice portfolio, she had delegated responsibility for constitutional and electoral policy, human rights, privacy and the Māori–Crown relationship.

Across her portfolios, Wilson had a strong focus on women&#x27;s equality. She established the position of Equal Employment Opportunities commissioner at the Human Rights Commission and progressed reform to matrimonial property law. She also oversaw the replacement of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 with the Employment Relations Act 2000 and, as Attorney-General, revived and completed previous governments&#x27; attempts to cease using the Privy Council as the New Zealand&#x27;s court of last resort and establish an independent Supreme Court of New Zealand.

Wilson remained a list MP after the 2002 election and, over the term, gained a more varied set of portfolios. She initially continued as Attorney-General, Minister of Labour, Minister in charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations and Associate Minister of Justice. She was Minister for Courts until May 2003, until that role was reassigned to Rick Barker with Wilson as the associate minister. In February 2004, Wilson became Minister of Commerce (Paul Swain picked up the labour portfolio) and in November 2004, Wilson became the first Minister for Building Issues.

===Speaker of the House===
In December 2004, the Government announced that it would nominate Wilson for the post of Speaker of the House of Representatives, a position which would become vacant with the pending retirement of Jonathan Hunt. Previous speculation had focused on Mark Burton, the Minister of Defence. In her memoir, Wilson recalled advising Prime Minister Helen Clark toward the end of 2004 that she could not see herself doing a third term as a minister and that she intended to retire at the 2005 election. Clark suggested that Wilson consider the speakership instead.

On 3 March 2005, Parliament elected Wilson as its new speaker over candidacies by Clem Simich from the New Zealand National Party and Ken Shirley from the ACT Party. Wilson became New Zealand&#x27;s first female speaker. After the 2005 election, she was re-elected to the position unopposed.

On 21 June 2005, Wilson ejected the Prime Minister Helen Clark from Parliament&#x27;s Chamber for interjecting while National&#x27;s Nick Smith was speaking.

Her style was noticeably different from her predecessor. In July 2006, National attempted a vote of no confidence in Wilson, after she refused to send a report on Labour MP Taito Phillip Field to the Privileges Committee, but Labour blocked the move. The most serious challenge to her authority as speaker came on 26 August 2008, when Act leader Rodney Hide initially refused her order to leave the debating chamber, saying, &quot;I actually won&#x27;t go now, Madam Speaker.&quot; She told him to &quot;think carefully&quot;, but did not apply to have Hide named after he left. Wilson oversaw the launch of Parliament TV in July 2007.

Wilson announced in February 2008 that she would not be standing for re-election in 2008, and was considering academia rather than a diplomatic posting. She finished her role by closing the 48th Parliament.

In the 2009 New Year Honours, Wilson was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, in recognition of her services as a Member of Parliament and as Speaker. Following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government later in 2009, Wilson declined re-designation as a Dame Companion.

==Political views==
Wilson strongly promotes various social causes such as feminism and multiculturalism, and opponents often painted her as Labour&#x27;s most &quot;politically correct&quot; minister. She was the Minister responsible for the introduction of the new Supreme Court, which was controversial at the time, as well as changing the law on dividing property between partners after a separation, known now as relationship property law.

Wilson, alongside Helen Kelly, were noted opponents of neoliberalism and tried to support the union movement whilst in Government. However, Wilson acknowledged that the Labour Relations Act 1987 was a &quot;an awkward compromise&quot; between neoliberal economic values, and the rights of organised labour.

==Return to academia==
After leaving Parliament, she resumed her academic career at the Waikato University law school, being appointed Professor of Law and Public Policy (2009). In September 2020 she was awarded the title of Emeritus Professor by the University of Waikato.

Wilson published her memoir &quot;Activism, Feminism, Politics and Parliament&quot; in 2021.

<doc id="1075815" wikidata="Q909690" url="?curid=1075815" title="Brent oilfield">
<text>The Brent field was an oil and gas field operated by Shell UK Limited. It was located in 470ft of water, in the East Shetland Basin of the North Sea, north-east of Lerwick in the Shetland Islands, Scotland. 

The field was discovered in 1971 with the 211/29-1 well which was drilled by the Shell owned &#x27;Staflo&#x27; semi-submersible drilling rig. At the time, this was the world&#x27;s most northerly well ever drilled. Appraisal of the discovery was not possible until 1972 due to the severe winter weather conditions of the Northern North Sea and the limited capabilities of contemporary drilling rigs. A total of 6 appraisal wells were drilled to allow the full potential of the field to be evaluated. The original oil/condensate-in-place and wet gas-in-place were estimated at 3.8 billion barrels and 7.5 trillion cubic feet respectively.

The field was developed with 4 large fixed platforms: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, which were installed between 1975 and 1978. First oil was achieved in 1976. A total initial investment of £3 billion was required to develop the field, install the infrastructure, drill the wells and bring the oil and gas to shore.

Brent was once one of the most productive parts of the UK&#x27;s offshore assets but has now been fully decommissioned after reaching the end of its economic life. All four platforms were removed from the field between 2017 and 2024 by &quot;Pioneering Spirit&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest vessel by tonnage.

==Name==
Shell initially named all of its UK oil fields after seabirds in alphabetical order by discovery – Auk, Brent, Cormorant, Dunlin, Eider, Fulmar and so on. Brent refers to the brent goose, and in turn gave its initials to the geologic subdivisions of the Middle Jurassic-age Brent Group that make up the field: Broom, Rannoch, Etive, Ness and Tarbert formations, with each name representing a loch in the Scottish Highlands.

==Geology==

Situated in the East Shetland Basin, the Brent is the archetype for many of the fields in the area, consisting of a tilted fault block exposing the eponymous Brent formation, next to bounding faults which allowed migration from deeper adjacent &quot;kitchen&quot; areas where the Kimmeridge Clay Formation becomes fully mature and releases hydrocarbons. Unusually on a worldwide scale (but common in this basin), the seal or cap rock for the reservoir (which stops the hydrocarbons from migrating further towards the surface) is also the Kimmeridge Clay, or technically the Heather Formation immediately below.

The reservoir depth is .

==Production==

Production started on 11 November 1976, and on 13 December 1976 the first tanker was loaded. The Brent field oil was extracted by four platforms in an irregular SSW-NNE line. The first in place was the concrete-legged &quot;Condeep&quot; Brent Bravo, built by Norwegian Contractors in Stavanger, in August 1975. This was followed by the steel-jacket Brent Alpha built by Redpath Dorman Long in Methil and installed in May 1976; the concrete-legged Brent Delta, again built by Norwegian Contractors in Stavanger, in July 1976; and the concrete-base Brent Charlie, built by McAlpine/Sea Tank in Ardyne Point, installed in June 1978. As of 2004, the field was still producing oil through a manifold (all Brent Alpha fluids are produced across to Brent Bravo). A fifth installation, the floating Brent Spar, served as a storage- and tanker-loading buoy and was installed early in the field&#x27;s construction. The &quot;spar&quot; design of this installation led to the name by which it became the best known of the Brent installations (outside the oil industry). The field also included a remote flare, the &quot;Brent Flare&quot;, which was used to flare off excess gas before gas handling and export facilities were installed in the field, also used as a vent in winter 1995–96. This unit was decommissioned and removed using a heavy lifting barge in 2005.

The topsides for Brent Charlie were designed by Matthew Hall Engineering which was awarded the contract in January 1974. Initially there were facilities for 19 oil production wells, nine water injection wells, six gas injection wells and three spare slots. The production capacity was per day and 8.5 million standard cubic metres of gas per day. There were three production trains each with four stages of separation with the first stage separators operating at a pressure of 9.6 bar. The 14 subsea storage cells had a capacity of . Electricity generation was powered by three 12 MW Rolls-Royce Avon gas turbines. The topside accommodation was for 120 people. There were 14 topsides modules and the topsides weight was 34,000 tonnes.

The initial design parameters of the Brent installations is summarised in the table.
The field supplied oil via the Brent System pipeline to the terminal at Sullom Voe, while gas was piped through the FLAGS pipeline ashore at St Fergus on the north-east coast of Scotland. The production of oil from the field (in 1000s barrels) was:&lt;graph&gt;{

}&lt;/graph&gt;The field underwent a £1.3 billion upgrade project in the mid-1990s, which involved depressurising the entire reservoir and making extensive modifications to three of the four Brent platforms. This converted them to low-pressure operation, which unlocked significant quantities of natural gas from the reservoir and extended the field life beyond 2010.

The field&#x27;s peak production capacity reached 504,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in 1982 and it produced a total of approximately three billion barrels of oil equivalent as of 2008.

The Brent field decommissioning project was initiated in 2006. Brent Delta was the first platform to cease production in December 2011, while the Brent Alpha and Bravo platforms stopped production in November 2014, Brent Charlie in March 2021.

==Decommission==
The Brent pipelines decommissioning programme was approved by the UK government in March 2020. As per the decommissioning plan, the gravity-based structures (GBS) of Delta, Charlie, and Bravo platforms, the jacket footings of Alpha platform, drill cuttings, and the GBS cell contents will not be removed from the field. The GBS subsea storage cells were used to temporarily store crude oil before pumping to tankers or pipeline.

The Brent field is being decommissioned in a phased manner. The Brent Delta topside decommissioning programme was approved by the UK government in July 2015, while that for the Alpha, Bravo, and the Charlie platforms were approved in August 2018. The topsides of the Brent Delta platform, weighing approximately 24,200 t, was removed in a single-lift in April 2017 and transported to Hartlepool for recycling. The topside was completely dismantled by February 2019.

The topsides of the Brent Bravo platform, weighing approximately 25,000 t, was removed in a single-lift in June 2019. The topside is currently being dismantled and recycled.

The legs of the Brent Bravo and Delta platforms remain in place with their GBS subsea storage cells. This will also apply to the Brent Charlie platform when decommissioned. The contents of the GBS storage cells are likely to be residual hydrocarbons and radioactive toxic elements.

==Air incidents involving workers==
On 31 July 1979, a Dan Air fixed wing aircraft crashed attempting to take off from Sumburgh Airport. The flight was returning Brent Field workers to Aberdeen. There were 17 fatalities. The aircraft was an ex Aerolineas Argentinas HS 748 manufactured in 1962. The main cause was found to be a faulty gust lock. The co-pilot was found to have tranquillisers in his system. It is not known if he was in control as he had less than 100 hours on this type of aircraft.

On 6 November 1986, a Boeing Vertol BV234 Chinook helicopter G-BWFC crashed on approach to Sumburgh airport. The flight was returning from the Brent Field. There were 45 fatalities and 2 survivors one of whom was the pilot. The cause was found to be faulty transmission, which caused the twin rotor blades to collide.

On 25 July 1990, a Sikorsky S61-N helicopter G-BEWL crashed while attempting to land on Brent Spar. There were 6 fatalities including both pilots. The cause was found to be pilot error and design of the helideck.

<text>Jean-Gaspard Deburau (; born Jan Kašpar Dvořák; 31 July 1796 – 17 June 1846), sometimes erroneously called Debureau, was a Bohemian-French mime. He performed from 1816 to the year of his death at the Théâtre des Funambules, which was immortalized in Marcel Carné&#x27;s poetic-realist film &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; (1945); Deburau appears in the film (under his stage-name, &quot;Baptiste&quot;) as a major character. His most famous pantomimic creation was Pierrot—a character that served as the godfather of all the Pierrots of Romantic, Decadent, Symbolist, and early Modernist theater and art.

==Life and career==
Born in Kolín, Bohemia (now Czech Republic), Deburau was the son of a Czech servant, Kateřina Králová (or Catherine Graff), and a former French soldier, Philippe-Germain Deburau, a native of Amiens. Philippe became a showman and performed at the head of a nomadic troupe. In 1814 he took the company to Paris and they were hired in 1816 by the manager of the Funambules.

Cast-lists indicate that he appeared as Pierrot right away, although it was not until 1825 that he became the sole actor to claim the role. He attained a certain fame in 1828, when the influential writer Charles Nodier published a panegyric about him. The journalist Jules Janin published a book of effusive praise, entitled &quot;Deburau, histoire du Théâtre à Quatre Sous&quot;, in 1832. By the middle of the 1830s, Deburau was widely known. Théophile Gautier wrote of his talent with enthusiasm (&quot;the most perfect actor who ever lived&quot;); Théodore de Banville dedicated poems and sketches to his Pierrot; Charles Baudelaire praised his style of acting.

In 1832, when he took his pantomime to the Palais-Royal, he failed spectacularly. The occasion was a benefit performance of a pantomime performed earlier—with great success—at the Funambules. Louis Péricaud, the chronicler of the Funambules, wrote that &quot;never was there a greater disaster, a rout more complete for Deburau and his fellow-artists&quot;. Deburau himself was hissed, and he vowed to play thereafter before no other public than those &quot;naïfs and enthusiasts&quot; who were habitués of the Boulevard du Crime.
In 1836, Deburau was charged with murder after killing a boy who called him &quot;Pierrot&quot; on the street. 

When he died, his son Jean-Charles (1829–1873) took over and later founded a &quot;school&quot; of pantomime, which flourished first in the south of France and then, at the end of the century, in Paris.

Jean-Gaspard Deburau is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris (see photo at right).

==Pantomime==
===Character roles===
Pierrot was not Baptiste&#x27;s only creation. As Robert Storey has pointed out, Deburau performed in many pantomimes unconnected with the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;:
He was probably the student-sailor Blanchot in &quot;Jack, l&#x27;orang-outang&quot; (1836), for example, and the farmhand Cruchon in &quot;Le Tonnelier et le somnambule&quot; ([The Cooper and the Sleepwalker] late 1838 or early 1839), and the goatherd Mazarillo in &quot;Fra-Diavolo, ou les Brigands de la Calabre&quot; ([Brother Devil, or The Brigands of Calabria] 1844). He was certainly the Jocrisse-like &quot;comique&quot; of &quot;Hurluberlu&quot; (1842) and the engagingly naïve recruit Pichonnot of &quot;Les Jolis Soldats&quot; ([The Handsome Soldiers] 1843).
Like Chaplin&#x27;s various incarnations, all of whom bear some resemblance to the Tramp, these characters, though singular and independent creations, must undoubtedly have struck their audiences as Pierrot-like. For Deburau and Pierrot were synonymous in the Paris of post-Revolutionary France.

===Pierrot===
Deburau&#x27;s Pierrot was more aggressive in his acrobatics (his &quot;superabundance&quot;, in Péricaud&#x27;s words, &quot;of gestures, of leaps&quot;) than Baptiste&#x27;s &quot;placid&quot; creation, and much less aggressive in his audacity and daring. Deburau dispensed with Pierrot&#x27;s coarseness and emphasized his cleverness. As theater historian Edward Nye writes, &quot;Pierrot had somehow intellectually matured and learnt to moderate his worst excesses, or even to turn them into relative virtues.&quot; The poet Gautier reproached him for having &quot;denaturalized&quot; the character. Part of this may have been due to what Rémy calls the vindictiveness of Deburau&#x27;s own personality; Deburau forged a role with a commanding stage presence.

The expressivity of his acting was abetted by his alterations in Pierrot&#x27;s costume. His overlarge cotton blouse and trousers freed him from the constraints of the woolen dress of his predecessors, and his abandoning the frilled collar and hat gave prominence to his expressive face. A black skullcap, framing that face, was his only stark adornment.

But his real innovations came in the pantomime itself. His biographers, as well as the chroniclers of the Funambules, contend that his pantomimes were all alike. The &quot;naive scenarios&quot; that &quot;limited&quot; his acting, according to his Czech biographer, Jaroslav Švehla, &quot;did little more than group together and repeat traditional, threadbare, primitive, and in many cases absurd situations and mimic gags (&quot;cascades&quot;), insulting to even a slightly refined taste.&quot; And Adriane Despot, author of &quot;Jean-Gaspard Deburau and the Pantomime at the Théâtre des Funambules&quot;, agrees: &quot;most of the pantomimes are essentially the same; they share the atmosphere of light, small-scale, nonsensical adventures enlivened with comic dances, ridiculous battles, and confrontations placed in a domestic or otherwise commonplace setting.&quot; But Despot was familiar only with a handful of the scenarios, those few in print; by far the greater number, which present a picture of the pantomime rather different from Despot&#x27;s, are in manuscript in the Archives Nationales de France and in the library of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques. And Švehla is proceeding along misguided lines by assuming that Deburau &quot;longed to represent a better character&quot; than Pierrot: Deburau was apparently proud of his work at the Funambules, characterizing it to George Sand as an &quot;art&quot; (see next section below). &quot;He loved it passionately&quot;, Sand wrote, &quot;and spoke of it as of a grave thing.&quot;

The fact is that four distinct kinds of &quot;commedia&quot;-related pantomime held the stage at the Funambules, and for each Deburau created a now subtly, now dramatically different Pierrot.
*The Rustic Pantomime: gesturing towards Pierrot&#x27;s roots outside the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, to the peasant Pierrot of bucolic tradition (such as Molière&#x27;s Pierrot of &quot;Don Juan&quot; [1665]), the action of these scenarios is set in a hamlet or village. Pierrot is the hero: he is honest, good-hearted, but poor (and egotistically, comically naïve). Through an act of courage, he is able to overcome the scruples of the father of his beloved—a Lisette, or Finetta, or Babette—and win her at the dénouement. Examples: &quot;The Cossacks, or The Farm Set Ablaze&quot; (1840); &quot;Pierrot&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1845).
*The Melo-Pantomime: finding their inspiration in the popular boulevard melodramas having no connection with the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, these scenarios present Pierrot, not as a hero, but as a subaltern—often a soldier, sometimes a retainer working in the employ of the hero of the piece. They are set in exotic locales—Africa, America, Malta, China—and the action is (or is meant to be) thrillingly dramatic, fraught with villainous abductions, violent clashes, and spectacular rescues and reversals of fortune, often brought about by Pierrot&#x27;s cleverness and daring. Examples: &quot;The Enchanted Pagoda&quot; (1845); &quot;The Algerian Corsaire, or The Heroine of Malta&quot; (1845).
*The Realistic Pantomime: these are the pieces with which Despot seems most familiar. They are set in commonplace urban locales (shops, salons, public streets) and are usually peopled with the Parisian bourgeoisie (shopkeepers, merchants, valets). Pierrot is the center of attention in these scenarios, but it is a Pierrot that is often very different from the character thus-far described. &quot;Libidinous and unscrupulous&quot;, writes Robert Storey, &quot;often spiteful and cruel, he is redeemed only by his criminal innocence.&quot; He steals from a benefactress, takes outrageous advantage of a blind man, kills a peddler to procure the garments in which he presumes to court a duchess. This is the Pierrot described by Charles Nodier as a &quot;naive and clownish Satan&quot;. (only when the pantomime has been written by Deburau himself, such as &quot;La Baleine&quot; [The Whale] of 1833, do we encounter, predictably, a less devilish Pierrot—one in fact deserving of Columbine&#x27;s hand). Examples: &quot;Pierrot and His Creditors&quot; (1836); &quot;Pierrot and the Blind Man&quot; (1841).
*The Pantomimic Fairy-Play: the grandest and most popular class of pantomimes—it occupied a third of the Funambules&#x27; repertoire—of which there are three subclasses:
**The Pantomimic Pierrotique Fairy-Play: Pierrot is the only &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; character (except Cassander, who sometimes puts in an appearance). Like the action in the other subclasses, the plot here unfolds in fairyland, which is populated by sorcerers and sorceresses, ogres and magicians, fairies and enchanters. Pierrot is usually sent on a quest, sometimes to achieve an amatory goal (for himself or his master), sometimes to prove his mettle, sometimes to redress an injustice. The settings are fantastic and gothic, the action bizarre and frenetic, and the comedy very broad. Examples: &quot;The Sorcerer, or The Demon-Protector&quot; (1838); &quot;Pierrot and the Bogeyman, or The Ogres and the Brats&quot; (1840).
**The Pantomimic Harlequinesque Fairy-Play: the basis for the pantomimes still performed at Bakken in Denmark. In the landscape described above (and populated by the same warring spirits), Harlequin, the lover, carries Columbine off, triggering a pursuit by her papa, Cassander, and his serving-man Pierrot. The end of their adventures is, of course, their union, reluctantly blessed by their pursuers. Examples: &quot;Pierrot Everywhere&quot; (1839); &quot;The Three Hunchbacks&quot; (1842).
**The Pantomimic Harlequinesque Fairy-Play in the English Style: borrows the &quot;opening&quot; of early nineteenth-century English pantomime: at the rise of curtain, two suitors are in dispute for the same young lady, and her father, a miser, chooses the richer of the two. A fairy appears to protect the sentimentally more deserving (Harlequin, after his transformation)—and to change all the characters into the &quot;commedia&quot; types. Then begins the chase. Examples: &quot;The Ordeals&quot; (1833); &quot;Love and Folly, or The Mystifying Bell&quot; (1840).

==Myths about Deburau==
===The people&#x27;s Pierrot===
If Deburau is known today, he is known as the Deburau of &quot;Children of Paradise&quot;. There he is an exemplar of the common people, a tragic long-suffering lover, a friend of the pure and lonely and distant moon. In Reality neither Deburau nor his Pierrot was such a figure. The myth was the product of clever journalism and idealizing romance. George Sand noted, after Deburau&#x27;s death, that the &quot;titis&quot;, the street boys of the Funambules, regarded Pierrot as their &quot;model&quot;.

===The tragic Pierrot===
In 1842, a pantomime was performed at the Funambules in which Pierrot meets a tragic end. At the final curtain of &quot;The Ol&#x27; Clo&#x27;s Man&quot; (&quot;Le Marrrchand d&#x27;habits!&quot;), Pierrot dies on stage. It was an unprecedented dénouement and one not to be repeated, at least at Deburau&#x27;s theater (imagine the Little Tramp expiring at the end of one of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s films). It was also an anomaly for which his romantic admirers were responsible. This pantomime had been invented by Théophile Gautier in a &quot;review&quot; that he had published in the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot;. He conceived it in the &quot;realistic&quot; vein described above: Pierrot, having fallen in love with a duchess, kills an old-clothes man to secure the garments with which to court her. At the wedding, however, &quot;à la&quot; the Commander of &quot;Don Juan&quot;, the ghost of the peddler—the murdering sword protruding from his chest—rises up to dance with the bridegroom. And Pierrot is fatally impaled.

The temptation to use such material, devised by such an illustrious poet, was irresistible to the managers of the Funambules, and the &quot;review&quot; was immediately turned into a pantomime (probably by the administrator of the theater, Cot d&#x27;Ordan). It was not a success: it had a seven-night run, a poor showing for one of Baptiste&#x27;s productions. If he indeed appeared in the piece—the matter is under dispute—he did so very reluctantly. It was never revived at the Funambules.

But like Banville&#x27;s deathless prose, it was Gautier&#x27;s &quot;review&quot; that survived—and prospered. Gautier&#x27;s ex-son-in-law, Catulle Mendès, refashioned it into a pantomime in 1896, and when Sacha Guitry wrote his play &quot;Deburau&quot; (1918) he included it as the only specimen of the mime&#x27;s art. Carné did the same. 

===The moonstruck Pierrot===
Deburau&#x27;s Romantic admirers often made the association with the clown and the moon. Banville&#x27;s poem &quot;Pierrot&quot; (1842) concludes with these lines: &quot;The white Moon with its horns like a bull / Peeps behind the scenes / At its friend Jean Gaspard Deburau.&quot; As the century progressed, the association grew stronger. Albert Giraud&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; (1884) marked a watershed in the moon-maddening of Pierrot, as did the song-cycle that Arnold Schoenberg derived from it (1912).

<doc id="1075818" wikidata="Q738158" url="?curid=1075818" title="Gretna F.C.">
<text>Gretna Football Club was a Scottish professional football club based in the town of Gretna, Dumfries and Galloway, close to the border between England and Scotland, that last competed in the Scottish Premier League, the then top flight of Scottish football. Nicknamed the Black and Whites or the Anvils, the club was founded in 1946, and enjoyed rapid and continual success in the mid-2000s, reaching the Scottish Cup Final in 2006. However, the club fell into severe financial difficulties when its main financial backer, businessman Brooks Mileson, withdrew funds due to ill health, leading the club to dissolve in 2008.

Despite being based in Scotland, the club participated in amateur and semi-professional leagues in English football from 1947 until they were elected to the Scottish Football League at the third attempt in 2002. Relying heavily on substantial financial support from Mileson, the club were promoted through the Scottish leagues from the Third Division to the Scottish Premier League in less than five years. The club also reached the 2006 Scottish Cup Final, losing in a penalty shoot-out to Hearts.

Gretna struggled badly in the SPL and the club were placed in administration after Mileson withdrew his support due to illness. At the end of the season, all of the club&#x27;s staff were made redundant and the club were initially relegated to the Third Division due to their inability to guarantee fulfilment of their forthcoming fixtures. After this demotion, the one remaining offer to buy the club was withdrawn. The club resigned their place in the Scottish Football League on 3 June 2008 and were formally liquidated on 8 August.

The club&#x27;s supporters&#x27; trust then decided to establish a new club, Gretna 2008, who were accepted into the East of Scotland Football League on 11 July 2008. Whilst sharing the same fanbase and a similar name, the new club has no legal connection with the original Gretna Football Club.

==History==

===Formation===
An amateur club called Gretna Green had existed in the town in the 19th century, but were bankrupt by the 1920s. This left the area without a team until Gretna Football Club was founded in 1946 by local workers and servicemen returning from the Second World War. Former professional footballer James Kerr was one of the club&#x27;s founders and as part of the club&#x27;s committee, his opinion held sway when picking the team. The club initially played in the Dumfries and District Junior League.

===Period in English football===
The following year, the club moved to the Carlisle and District League. This was despite the club being based in Scotland, albeit very close to the Anglo-Scottish border. They remained in this league for all but one season until 1982, when the club moved to the newly created Second Division of the Northern League. The club won this league and were promoted immediately, before back-to-back championship wins in the First Division, in 1990–91 and 1991–92, resulted in their promotion to the first division of the Northern Premier League.

During this period, the club featured in the FA Cup, becoming the first club based in Scotland to appear in the competition proper since Queens Park in 1887. They managed to take Rochdale to a replay in 1991 and gave Bolton Wanderers a scare in 1993 before being beaten.

The club saw its future in Scottish football and applied twice to join the Scottish League in 1993 and 1999. To help boost their later application, they played a Rangers XI in a game to raise money for victims of the Lockerbie bombing. Gretna won 2–1 against a strong team.

===Period back in Scottish football===

====Rapid rise through the leagues====
In 2002, Gretna were elected to the Scottish Football League at the third attempt, taking the place of Airdrieonians. The club was soon taken over by Brooks Mileson and with his financial input Gretna&#x27;s on-field fortunes improved. Gretna won the Division Three, Division Two and Division One titles in successive seasons from 2005 to 2007. During their seasons of successive promotions they scored 297 goals, 130 in the 2004–05 season alone.

Gretna were also runners-up in the 2006 Scottish Cup. Gretna&#x27;s 3–0 win in the semi-final against Dundee made them the first team from the third tier of Scottish league football to reach the final. Gretna lost to Heart of Midlothian in the final on penalties after a 1–1 draw. As Hearts had finished second in the Scottish Premier League and had therefore qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Gretna became the first team from the third tier of the Scottish league to qualify for the UEFA Cup. Gretna faced League of Ireland side Derry City in the second qualifying round, but lost 7–3 on aggregate, losing the first leg 5–1 at Fir Park, Motherwell (Raydale Park was deemed unsuitable for European football).

Gretna had also been promoted to the First Division in 2006, and for much of the 2006–07 season, they led the division, with a margin of 12 points at one stage. Manager Rowan Alexander was forced to step down in March 2007 due to unspecified health problems, though he later claimed that he had had no medical issues and had been asked to take time away by the club chairman. Coach Davie Irons stepped up to the manager&#x27;s position and Gretna&#x27;s form dipped; second-placed St Johnstone went on a good run, leaving Gretna with only a one-point lead going into the final day of the season. Gretna beat Ross County 3–2 with a last-minute goal by James Grady, ensuring promotion to the Scottish Premier League.

====Gretna in the Scottish Premier League====
During the 2007–08 season, Gretna had to play all their home games at Motherwell&#x27;s home ground of Fir Park because Raydale Park did not meet SPL standards. Their first game in the SPL was against Falkirk which ended in a 4–0 defeat for Gretna. They continued to struggle, only gaining four points in their first 12 games and having to wait until 22 September 2007 for their first win in the SPL, defeating Dundee United 3–2 at Fir Park.

Far worse news was that during this time the club&#x27;s financial situation became dire. The club had accumulated debts of nearly £4m, and owner Brooks Mileson fell ill and withdrew his financial support for the club (Mileson never fully recovered from his health problems and died on 3 November 2008). A confused management situation did not help. Whilst Rowan Alexander was officially still manager, Davie Irons was in control of the team. On 6 November 2007, Gretna officially sacked Alexander as manager and formally installed Irons in his position.

On 18 February 2008 it was revealed that Gretna staff, including players, had not received their wages on time. Irons and assistant manager Derek Collins both resigned from their posts the following day. Gretna director of football Mick Wadsworth, assisted by Iain Scott and Andy Smith, took charge of first-team affairs. The club went into administration on 12 March 2008 after Mileson&#x27;s withdrawal of support. Under SPL regulations, this resulted in an automatic ten point deduction, meaning they had a total of only six points from 28 games on the date of entering administration. The SPL agreed to pay the players&#x27; wages until the end of the 2007–08 season, ensuring that the club were able to complete its fixtures in the SPL.

Administration led to cost-cutting and redundancies; club captain Chris Innes was made redundant on 25 March 2008, with the club explaining that he had &quot;attracted interest from other clubs&quot;. The following day, 22 players, including eight members of the senior squad, along with coaching staff and the former owner&#x27;s son were also made redundant. Gretna were mathematically relegated from the SPL on 29 March 2008 after being defeated 2–0 by St Mirren at Love Street, and broke the SPL&#x27;s low attendance record on 5 April 2008 in their game against Inverness, when just 431 turned up for the match. They won their final SPL game, a home match against Hearts 1–0 with a goal from Gavin Skelton, which meant they finished the season with 13 points, narrowly avoiding setting a record low points total for the Scottish top-flight. Even without the point deduction, Gretna would have still been relegated by a 17-point margin behind Kilmarnock.

===Liquidation===
In early 2008 it was revealed by the administrator, Wilson Field of Sheffield, that Gretna had creditors of nearly £4m and assets (Raydale Park) of £812,000. HM Revenue and Customs was owed nearly £600,000 in total, and it was their threat to wind up the company that precipitated Gretna&#x27;s move into administration. On 8 May, the administrator set a deadline of 17 May for a buyer to be found, or the club would be liquidated.

After that deadline passed without a buyer making a firm offer, all the remaining employees were made redundant, but it was reported that the club were still negotiating with an interested buyer. On 29 May, Gretna were relegated to the Third Division due to their financial struggles, with the Scottish Football League threatening expulsion should a takeover not be completed within a week. After a takeover bid fell through on 1 June, the administrators confirmed the following day that they would look to sell Raydale Park to someone who will use the site for something other than football.

Gretna resigned from the Scottish Football League on 3 June. Near neighbours Annan Athletic won the vote to replace Gretna in the Scottish league. With no ground, staff, players or a competition to play in, the club&#x27;s dissolution was inevitable and the club was formally liquidated by the administrators on 8 August.

====Successor club====
The Gretna Supporters Society, (a Supporters&#x27; trust) formed a new club, Gretna 2008 on 2 July 2008 and applied to join both the East of Scotland Football League and the South of Scotland Football League. They were accepted into the East of Scotland League, though they initially played their matches at the Everholm Stadium in Annan. The club returned to Raydale Park in May 2009 which it now leases from the Raydale Partnership, a community group of which Gretna Supporters Society is a member.

==Seasons==

==European record==
Gretna qualified for a UEFA club competition on one occasion. In 2006, Gretna reached the final of the Scottish Cup whilst competing in the Scottish Second Division and were beaten by Heart of Midlothian. The winner of the Scottish Cup would normally qualify for the UEFA Cup, but because Hearts had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League through their league ranking in the Scottish Premier League, the place was passed to Gretna as runners-up. They were eliminated in the second qualifying round by Derry City, representing the Republic of Ireland, in a two-legged tie.

<text>Dianne Fae Yates (born 29 November 1943) is a former New Zealand politician. She was a Labour Party Member of Parliament from 1993 to 2008.

== Early life and career ==
Yates was born in 1943 to parents Joy (née Hinton) and Frederick Yates, a builder, and raised on a farm outside Hamilton. She has one brother.

Yates trained as a teacher and also completed a Bachelor of Arts at Victoria University of Wellington and a Master of Education at Howard University in Washington, D.C. She worked as a teacher and education administrator in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Zimbabwe. In the 1970s, she worked on the television programme &quot;Country Calendar&quot;. Before entering Parliament, she worked as a continuing education officer at the University of Waikato.

Yates is divorced and has no children.

==Member of Parliament==



Yates joined the Labour Party in the 1970s. She was selected as the party&#x27;s candidate in the marginal Hamilton East electorate for the 1993 election, where she defeated Tony Steel, who had won the seat for National three years prior, by an 80-vote margin. Yates and Steel were electoral rivals for four elections, trading Hamilton East between them until Steel&#x27;s retirement upon defeat at the 2002 general election (Yates won the electorate by 614 votes). Although she was unsuccessful in Hamilton East in 1996, 1999, and 2005, she was returned as a list MP each time.

Yates sat on the justice and law reform committee from 1993 to 1999. She was not appointed a minister in the Fifth Labour Government, which held power in Yates&#x27; final three terms, but was highly active as a legislator with five private member&#x27;s bills—mostly related to women&#x27;s rights—considered by Parliament during her career. She held three select committee chairs: government administration from 1999 to 2005; foreign affairs, defence and trade from 2005 to 2008; and education and science in 2008. She was also deputy chair of the regulations review committee from 1999 to 2005 and a member of the health committee from 2002 to 2005.

=== Women&#x27;s rights advocacy and legislation ===
In the Labour Party opposition led by Helen Clark, Yates was Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for women&#x27;s affairs. She was outspoken on some issues regarding technology, such as cloning and in vitro fertilisation, because of their potential impact on women and children. In her maiden statement, given on 15 March 1994, she stated: &quot;We may be successful in breeding sheep and cattle for sale, but we must not breed human babies for sale... We could breed a nation of muscle-bound athletes; we could even classify our babies for various field events prior to their birth. If we are able to alter the muscle-to-fat ratio of cattle, what might we do to humans?&quot; 

Yates promoted a private member&#x27;s bill &quot;to ban cloning&quot; and regulate assisted reproductive procedures in 1996, which was eventually passed as the Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004. The bill was based on the British Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Yates said she came to the issue from a &quot;radical feminist&quot; perspective; while speaking on the bill in Parliament, she suggested the bill could do away with sexual intercourse for reproductive, but not recreational, purposes and that New Zealand needed &quot;at most eight fit human males with high sperm counts&quot; to replenish its population. She also advocated for a national register of to give children conceived through donation information about their genetic parents.

Yates was a supporter of paid parental leave and drafted legislation to provide a new parent with six weeks of paid time off. Ultimately her bill was not required as a more generous bill from Laila Harré, proposing twelve weeks, was supported by parliament in 1997. She was also active on alcohol safety reform for pregnant people. In 1999, she proposed amendments to government legislation that would have required all alcohol containers to carry warning labels including &quot;Women should not drink liquor during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects.&quot; The amendments lost by a single vote. Yates brought the amendments again, as a private member&#x27;s bill, the following year. The wording of the warnings were criticised by Attorney-General Margaret Wilson as being broader in wording and application than strictly necessary. Yates&#x27; bill was defeated at its first reading on 11 October 2000.

Electoral reform, and the potential for this to support the election of women, was another focus of Yates&#x27; career. She was a member of the Women&#x27;s Electoral Lobby and Electoral Reform Coalition prior to her election as a Labour MP and supported the adoption of proportional representation. In her second term, she inherited the Local Elections (Single Transferable Vote Option) Bill from her defeated colleague Richard Northey. The bill proposed letting local authorities choose the single transferable vote electoral system for their elections. In the final parliament elected under the first-past-the-post voting system, the bill had been sent to the electoral reform subcommittee, which unanimously recommended its passage. However, the bill was eventually defeated in the first mixed-member proportional parliament, 57–63, in August 1998. The bill was later revived by Rod Donald and incorporated into the Local Electoral Act 2001.

Yates was a strong opponent of prostitution reform, describing prostitution as exploitation and the Prostitution Reform Bill that was debated between 2000 and 2003 as a tool to &quot;protect brothels, brothel-keepers and the clients [and to] provide nice, clean brothels so that clients can go home to their wives undetected as to where they spent the night.&quot; During consideration of the bill, she unsuccessfully proposed an amendment seeking to criminalise clients rather than prostitutes. The bill passed by a single vote; after it was enacted, Yates lobbied Hamilton City Council to create a local bylaw banning prostitution in the city&#x27;s suburbs.

Yates also sought to progress legislation on date rape drugs (which was incorporated into government legislation) and the practice of docking dogs&#x27; tails (which was abandoned after support for the change dissipated between the bill&#x27;s first and second readings). As chair of the government administration committee, she led inquiries into the leaky building crisis and hate speech in New Zealand. She voted in favour of civil union legislation in 2004 and retaining or restoring an alcohol purchase age of 20 years in 1999 and 2006. She has a mixed record on euthanasia: voting in favour of a &quot;death with dignity&quot; bill in 1995 and against another in 2003. She was an opponent of the compulsory retirement savings scheme proposed by Winston Peters and defeated by a referendum in 1997, saying the way the scheme had been designed was &quot;paternalistic.&quot;

Yates contested Hamilton East for the fifth time in the 2005 election, but lost the seat to new National candidate David Bennett by a significant 5,298 votes. She was returned as a list MP. In August 2007, she announced that she would retire from Parliament by the end of the year in order to stand for the Hamilton City Council. She was unsuccessful in the election, finishing 7th—the top-polling unsuccessful candidate in her ward. 

Yates&#x27; loss deferred her planned parliamentary retirement by several months. She gave her valedictory statement to Parliament on 19 March 2008 and left Parliament on 29 March 2008. Although Louisa Wall had been previously reported as Yates&#x27; replacement as a Labour Party list MP, Wall had entered Parliament early as a replacement for Ann Hartley. Instead, William Sio was named Yates&#x27; successor.

Following her retirement from Parliament, Yates was appointed to four government boards: Food Standards Australia New Zealand, Trust Waikato, Learning Media and Waikato Institute of Technology.

<text>Charles Paul Telford Hutchison, known as Paul Hutchison (born 1947) is a New Zealand politician, health professional, and current Honorary Consul in New Zealand for Papua New Guinea. He is a member of the National Party, which he represented in the House of Representatives from 1999 to 2014.

==Early years==
Hutchison was born in Wellington, and attended Khandallah School and Onslow College. He is a graduate of the University of Otago with an MB ChB in 1970, and was a consulting specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology with his pre parliament medical career spanning almost 30 years. 

==Member of Parliament==






Hutchison was first elected to Parliament as the MP for Port Waikato in the 1999 election, and was re-elected in the 2002 election and 2005 election, and for in the 2008 and 2011 elections, with increasing majorities each time.

As an MP he has held a number of health-related roles, including opposition Spokesperson for Health, and Chairperson of the Health Committee. He was one of only two National Party MPs to support the successful Smokefree Environments Amendment Act 2003. He voted against the Death with Dignity euthanasia bill, also in 2003.

He was seen reading while driving by a motorist in September 2009, prompting Acting Prime Minister Bill English to warn MPs to adhere to driving regulations.

As Chairman of the Health select committee ( 2009 to 2014), Hutchison steered five significant inquiries, including on Immunisation, prostate cancer, and &quot;Improving Child health outcomes and preventing child abuse from preconception until 3 years of age.&quot; The latter had strong bipartisan support and a special parliamentary debate was held to emphasise its importance.

Hutchison announced in October 2013 that he was going to retire from Parliament at the 2014 general election. 

Following his retirement Dr Hutchison was honoured by the New Zealand Medical Association with the chairman&#x27;s award for making ,&quot;an outstanding contribution to health in New Zealand&quot;, and for his services as chair of the Health Select Committee.

Hutchison was succeeded as the MP for by Andrew Bayly also of the New Zealand National Party.

<doc id="1075838" wikidata="Q1151947" url="?curid=1075838" title="The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou">
<text>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is a 2004 American adventure comedy-drama film written by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach and directed by Anderson. It is Anderson&#x27;s fourth feature-length film and was released in the United States on December 25, 2004.

The film stars Bill Murray as Steve Zissou, an eccentric oceanographer who sets out with his crew to exact revenge on the &quot;jaguar shark&quot; that ate his partner Esteban. Zissou is both a parody of and homage to French diving pioneer Jacques Cousteau, to whom the film is dedicated.

The film also features Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston, and Bud Cort. Seu Jorge has a minor part, but contributes heavily to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. It was filmed in and around Rome, Naples, Ponza, and the Italian Riviera.

The film was released to mixed reviews and was a box office flop. In the decade following its release it has garnered a cult following, and is now viewed more positively by both critics and fans. It was also since remastered and re-released by The Criterion Collection in 2014.

==Plot==
While oceanographer Steve Zissou is working on his latest documentary at sea, his best friend and chief diver, Esteban du Plantier, is devoured by a 10-meter-long, spotted creature Zissou describes as a &quot;jaguar shark&quot;. For his next project, Zissou is determined to document the shark&#x27;s destruction.

The crew aboard Zissou&#x27;s aging research vessel &quot;Belafonte&quot; includes his estranged wife Eleanor, chief strategist and financial backer; Pelé dos Santos, a safety expert and Brazilian guitarist who sings David Bowie songs in Portuguese; and Klaus Daimler, the German first mate who views Zissou and Esteban as father figures. Other crew members include Vikram Ray, cameraman; Bobby Ogata, frogman; Vladimir Wolodarsky, physicist and soundtrack composer; Renzo Pietro, sound man; and Anne-Marie Sakowitz, a script girl. Also included is a recent group of unpaid interns from the University of North Alaska. However, the &quot;Team Zissou&quot; venture has hit a decline, having not released a successful documentary in nine years.

Ned Plimpton, a longtime Zissou fan whose mother has recently died, believes that Zissou is his father. After they meet at Zissou&#x27;s latest premiere, Ned takes annual leave from his job as an airline pilot in Kentucky to join his crew. As Oseary Drakoulias, Zissou&#x27;s producer, cannot find a financier for their latest documentary, Ned offers his inheritance. Eleanor feels her husband is manipulating Ned and leaves.

Pregnant reporter Jane Winslett-Richardson comes to chronicle the voyage. Both Ned and Zissou are attracted to Jane and a love triangle develops between them. Klaus becomes jealous of the attention Zissou pays to Ned.

On their mission to find the jaguar shark, the &quot;Belafonte&quot; steals tracking equipment from a remote station owned by more successful oceanographer (also Eleanor&#x27;s ex-husband and Zissou&#x27;s nemesis), Alistair Hennessey. They then sail into unprotected waters and are attacked by Filipino pirates, who steal Ned&#x27;s money and kidnap Bill Ubell, &quot;a bond company stooge&quot; assigned to the project. They are then rescued by Hennessey and towed to Port-au-Patois. Sakowitz, along with all but one of the interns, jumps ship once they reach port.

Zissou persuades Eleanor to rejoin the &quot;Belafonte&quot; and then leads the crew on a rescue mission. They track Bill to an abandoned hotel on a remote island, saving him along with Hennessey, whom the pirates have also kidnapped. Ned and Zissou make one last search for the shark in the ship&#x27;s helicopter, but the aircraft malfunctions and they crash. Ned dies from his injuries and is buried at sea. Prior to Ned&#x27;s death, Eleanor revealed to Jane that Zissou is sterile and therefore Ned could not have been his son.

Zissou finally tracks down the shark in a submersible but decides not to kill it, both because of its beauty and being out of dynamite. He ponders, &quot;I wonder if it remembers me,&quot; and is overcome with emotion. Eleanor silently comforts him, as does Jane and the rest of the crew. At the premiere of the finished documentary (which is dedicated to Ned, who is acknowledged as Zissou&#x27;s son), Zissou receives a standing ovation while waiting outside the theater for the premiere to finish. The crew returns triumphantly to the ship.

==Production==

===Literary inspiration===
Though the characters were inspired by such American novels as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons,&quot; the plot has been compared to &quot;Moby-Dick.&quot;

Writing about the metaphorical aspects of the film&#x27;s setting—somewhere in the Mediterranean—film critic Elena Past says that the underwater scenes, because they are central to the storyline, make &quot;The Life Aquatic&quot; similar in some ways to &quot;Respiro.&quot; Both films set out a &quot;Mediterranean state of being&quot; where &quot;having left the security of land, the characters in both films are suddenly confronted with the precarious nature of human existence, as the films that depict them tackle the challenges of representing the submarine world.&quot;

===Casting===
James Gray originally signed on to play Wolodarsky but he left when he learned that he was going to spend five months in Italy.

===Exotic lifeforms===
In addition to the luminescent-spotted jaguar shark, other fictional lifeforms (some stop-motion-animated) are cited and appear throughout the film, such as the rhinestone bluefin, crayon ponyfish, wild snow-mongoose, electric jellyfish, and sugar crabs. The animation work was done by Henry Selick.

===Music===

The soundtrack to &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; contains a style typical of other Wes Anderson films. Mark Mothersbaugh, a member of Devo, composed the score, as he has for many of Anderson&#x27;s other films. The film also features many rock songs from the 1960s-1980s, and several instrumental pieces composed by Sven Libaek for the underwater documentary television series &quot;Inner Space.&quot; Additionally, the film and soundtrack feature Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs in Portuguese on the acoustic guitar. Jorge, who also plays the character of Pelé dos Santos, performs some of these cover songs live, in character during the film, mostly with modified lyrics reflecting Jorge&#x27;s own experiences working on the film. The ending scene depicting the beauty of the shark features the song &quot;Starálfur&quot; by Sigur Rós.

&quot;The Life Aquatic&quot; is Anderson&#x27;s first film not to feature a Rolling Stones song.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film grossed a total of $24,020,403 domestically after twelve weeks in release, less than half its $50 million production budget. It took in a further $10,788,000 internationally, bringing the total gross to $34,808,403.

===Critical response ===
Initial reviews of the film were mixed. The film has a 57% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 226 reviews, with an average rating of 6.10/10; the website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Much like the titular oceanographer, &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;″s overt irony may come off as smug and artificial – but for fans of Wes Anderson&#x27;s unique brand of whimsy, it might be worth the dive.&quot; The film has a 62/100 weighted average score on Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;D&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Anthony Lane, a film reviewer for &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; agreed with the conventional criticism of Anderson&#x27;s deadpan style: that the underreaction of Anderson&#x27;s characters used to be &quot;hip&quot; but has now become &quot;frozen into a mannerism.&quot; He said that &quot;some stretches of action&quot; in the film are being &quot;lightly held within quotation marks,&quot; with an &quot;unmistakable air of playacting&quot; in even the most violent scenes. He also criticized the film&#x27;s deliberately &quot;weird&quot; set ups, which leave the viewer with &quot;the impression of having nearly drowned in some secret and melancholy game.&quot;

In the years since its initial release it has developed a cult following, and it underwent a critical reevaluation. Many critics view it more favorably, and some, such as Mike D&#x27;Angelo of &quot;The A.V. Club,&quot; consider the film to still be &quot;undervalued&quot; when compared to the rest of Anderson&#x27;s filmography.

===Accolades===
==Home media==
The DVD of the film was released by the Criterion Collection on May 10, 2005 as its 300th title, in both 1-disc version and a 2-disc versions. This is Anderson&#x27;s third film to be released in the collection, after &quot;Rushmore&quot; and &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums.&quot; The Criterion Blu-ray was released on May 27, 2014.

==In popular culture==
* The name of Mexican rock band Belafonte Sensacional is inspired, in part, by the film.
* Austin Tofte, of American electronica band Swimming With Dolphins, has listed &quot;The Life Aquatic&quot; as his favorite film.
* &quot;Epic Rap Battles of History&quot; released a rap battle between Jacques Cousteau and Steve Irwin. In one of Cousteau&#x27;s flex bars, he references &quot;The Life Aquatic&quot; saying, &quot;I&#x27;m so cool, Bill Murray played me in the movie.&quot;
* The title of an episode of the animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;, is a reference to the film.
* The song &quot;Alan Forever&quot; on Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s album &quot;DROGAS WAVE&quot; imagines an alternate reality for Alan Kurdi, in which he survived his emigration from Syria and &quot;might be the next Steve Zissou or maybe Jacques Cousteau.&quot;
* The ocean-themed 13th major update released for the video game &quot;Minecraft&quot; was titled &quot;Update Aquatic&quot; in reference to the film.

<doc id="1075847" wikidata="Q7768612" url="?curid=1075847" title="The Thanatos Syndrome">
<text>The Thanatos Syndrome (1987) was Walker Percy&#x27;s last novel. It is a sequel to &quot;Love in the Ruins&quot;. Set in the near future in Feliciana, it tells the story of an imprisoned psychiatrist who is freed and returns to his town with the active members demonstrating new mysterious behaviors. He suspects that something or someone is making everyone in his town crazy and reversing them to be like primitive apes.

==Plot==
After two years in prison for selling prescription drugs, Tom More, a Louisiana psychiatrist and lapsed Catholic, comes home to his virtually defunct practice and marriage. He notices that people in his town are different, many of his patients have a strange speech to them. Many faculties are dulled but some are enhanced, particularly memory and sexual appetite.

Teaming up with his cousin Lucy, an epidemiologist who also has an independent mind, they discover that the authorities, a consortium of scientists, have been running secret trials on the population of the town. Through the addition of sodium ions to the water supply, the active population is gradually being made more chimpanzee-like, while the inactive, the old and the sick, are being euthanized. To Tom&#x27;s particular disgust, the leaders of the trials are found to engage in sexual abuse of children, for which he takes his revenge by forcing them to drink high concentrations of sodium and so that they regress to apes.

A parallel plot involves a Catholic priest, Father Smith, who like Tom has hit rock bottom and almost totally failed in his calling. Together, with difficulty, the two men rediscover the hope hidden in their shaky Catholic faith.

== Themes ==

* The flawed hero. Unlike his namesake Thomas More, the physician Dr Tom More “is a far cry from the saint, drinks too much, and watches reruns of M*A*S*H on TV.” Father Smith, the priest he helps, is equally fallible in the book.
* Existential anxiety. Western medicine cannot cure the ills of its citizens: “The first character you encounter … the woman who lives at the country club and thinks she has everything and yet is in the middle of a panic attack. She is also the last person you encounter ... at the end confronting her anxiety. She is about to listen to herself tell herself something.” Existential anxiety, also known as existential angst, tends to be defined as having the regular characteristics of anxiety, but with the thought process based on our existence and purpose in life. `
* Ecological degradation linked to human regression. Natural beauty is ruined by human activity: “ … the Louisiana of the novel is an ecological mess …. it shows the peculiar indifference of the strange new breed of Louisianians in the novel. After all, chimp-like creatures do not generally form environmental protection societies.”
* A world gone mad. Humans in Western countries have lost their grip on reality: “But the world is also deranged … The looniness …. of the &#x27;normal&#x27; denizen of the Western world who …. doesn’t know who he is, what he believes, or what he is doing.”
* Breakdown of communication. People consistently fail to understand each other: “... some literary critics, philosophers, and semioticians … seem hell-bent on denying the very qualities of language and literature that have been held in such high esteem in the past: namely, that it is possible to know something about the world, that the world actually exists, that one person can actually say or write about the world and that other people can understand him. That, in a word, communication is possible.”
* Decline of the West. Mentally, Western society is moribund. Percy sees the USA “gradually subside into decay through default and be defeated ... from within by weariness, boredom, cynicism, greed, and in the end helplessness before its great problems” while the West is “losing by spiritual acedia”.
* Devaluation of humanity by science. In the book, Percy is angered by “the widespread and ongoing devaluation of human life in the Western world” which he ascribes to two mindsets: “ Thou shalt not find anything unique about the human animal even if the evidence points to such uniqueness” and “Thou shalt not suggest that there is a unique and fatal flaw in &#x27;Homo sapiens sapiens&#x27; or indeed any perverse trait that cannot be laid to the influence of Western civilization”. He contends that humans are unique in being both God-like and tainted by original sin.
* Bad faith leads to bad outcomes. Percy portrays fatal errors in both religious fundamentalists and secular humanists, commenting: “It is easy to criticize the absurdities of fundamentalist beliefs like &#x27;scientific creationism&#x27; — that the world and its creatures were created six thousand years ago. But it is also necessary to criticize other dogmas parading as science and the bad faith of some scientists who have their own dogmatic agendas to promote under the guise of &#x27;free scientific inquiry&#x27;. Scientific inquiry should in fact be free. The warning: If it is not, if it is subject to this or that ideology, then do not be surprised if .. history … is repeated. Weimar leads to Auschwitz. The nihilism of some scientists in the name of ideology or sentimentality and the consequent devaluation of individual human life leads straight to the gas chamber.” 

== List of characters ==

* Thomas More: The main character of the novel. He was put in jail for the distribution of pharmaceutical drugs for two years, once he is released on parole he goes back to the city to find things are different, specifically the behavior of the individuals. He is a psychiatrist and a failed Catholic. His female patients began trying to make sexual advances with him, which he considered to be strange and bizarre. He witnesses his wife change from a dull conservative to a really good contract bridge player.

* Ellen Oglethorpe More: She is Thomas More’s longstanding wife and nurse, her personality changes drastically throughout the novel due to the sodium ions in the water supply that is affecting the individuals in the population. She is someone you see change during the text to a more ape-like existence. She is essential to Thomas More’s epiphany about the situation going on in their town. Ellen and his patients were the key to this realization.

* Lucy Lipscomb: She is Thomas More’s cousin and for this reason he gets in contact with her about the problems he sees. She is an epidemiologist and because of this she feels she could be useful in the investigation of the absurdities happening in the town. His work in figuring out who is behind the scheme in the town heavily relied on her access to government locked information. She also felt something was morally incorrect about the forced reduction of crimes rates, along with other things, through the addition of sodium ions.

<text>The Champions is a British espionage thriller/science fiction/occult detective fiction adventure television series. It was produced by Lew Grade&#x27;s ITC Entertainment production company, and consists of 30 episodes broadcast in the UK on ITV during 1968–1969. The series was broadcast in the US on NBC, starting in summer 1968.

==Plot==
Agents Craig Stirling, Sharron Macready and Richard Barrett work for a United Nations law enforcement organization called &#x27;Nemesis&#x27;, based in Geneva. Barrett is a codebreaker, Stirling a pilot, and Macready a recently widowed scientist and doctor.

In the pilot episode, the team is escaping by air from a spying mission in China. Their stolen plane, damaged by gunfire during the getaway, crashes in the Himalayas. They are rescued by the residents of Shangri-La, an advanced civilization living secretly in the mountains of Tibet, who save their lives, granting them enhanced abilities, including extrasensory powers to communicate with one another over distances (telepathy) and to foresee events (precognition), enhanced versions of the ordinary five senses, and intellectual and physical abilities reaching the fullest extent of human capabilities.

Many stories feature unusual villains, such as fascist regimes from unspecified South American countries, Nazis (a common theme of ITC 1960s and 1970s TV, in part owing to both the writers and the domestic audience having been of the war generation) or the Chinese. The villains&#x27; schemes often threaten world peace; Nemesis&#x27; brief is international, so the agents deal with threats transcending national interests. The main characters have to learn the use of their new powers as they go along, keeping what they discover secret from friend and foe alike. Each episode begins with a close-up shot of a map, showing the region in which the story is to take place, followed by a teaser sometimes prefaced by stock footage; this is followed by the title sequence. Immediately following that is a post-title vignette, in which one or more of the Champions demonstrates exceptional mental or physical abilities, often astonishing or humiliating others. In one example Stirling participates in a sharpshooting contest. In another, Macready&#x27;s car is blocked in, two laughing passing drunks try to lift it out but she goes round to the other side and pulls it out of the parking space one-handed. Paradoxically, the narration during these often-public demonstrations usually mentions the need to keep the powers a secret. The narration involved in these particular scenes is spoken by American-born actor David Bauer, who also appeared as a foreign-accented villain in the episode &quot;The Experiment&quot;.

The only other series regular is the Champions&#x27; boss, Tremayne. He does not know that his agents have special abilities, although he does ask innocent questions about just how on their missions they managed to carry out certain tasks about which their reports were vague.

==Cast==
===Main cast===
* Stuart Damon as Craig Stirling
* Alexandra Bastedo as Sharron Macready
* William Gaunt as Richard Barrett
* Anthony Nicholls as W.L. Tremayne

===Guest cast===
* George Murcell as El Gaudillo
* Eric Pohlmann as Barka
* Joseph Fürst as Chislenkan
* David Lodge as Filmer
* Ric Young as Burmese Police Captain
* Michael Mellinger as Embassy Official
* Edward Brayshaw as Del Marco
* Peter Wyngarde as Dr. John Hallam

==Production==
&quot;The Champions&quot; was created by Dennis Spooner and its episodes were written by individuals who had worked on other British spy series, including &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Danger Man&quot;. An unfilmed script originally intended for &quot;Danger Man&quot; was used for one episode.

The series was produced by Monty Berman, who had co-produced &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot; and numerous B movies of the 1950s. Berman used many of the same writers, directors and crew on other ITC series, including &quot;Department S&quot;, &quot;Jason King&quot;, &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; and &quot;The Adventurer&quot;.

Owing to budget constraints, many sets were reused: three episodes were set on a submarine and three in the Arctic. Stock footage was often used. As with other ITC productions, much of the exterior action took place in and around the studio lot – in the case of &quot;The Champions&quot;, around Associated British Studios in Elstree, England. For at least one episode, &quot;Desert Journey&quot;, foreign filming did take place, but with a second unit, and extras standing in for the main cast.

The theme music of the series was written by Tony Hatch, with Albert Elms and Edwin Astley supplying incidental music.

==Episodes==
==Broadcast==
The series had three repeat runs in the UK across the ITV regions up to 1976, with additional repeats in September–October 1984 and May–August 1985. It was also regularly repeated on ITV&#x27;s digital channel ITV4 until January 2011.
&quot;The Champions&quot; was broadcast on BBC2 in 1995, at about the time when Gaunt was appearing in the sitcom &quot;Next of Kin&quot;, and it had at least three further repeat runs after that.

On 7 March 2021, the series began a rerun on Talking Pictures TV. The episode &#x27;Desert Journey&#x27; was not screened in this run.

From 4 May 2021, the series was being repeated again on ITV4, the first time in 10 years. It ended on 15 June, with only 27 of the 30 episodes shown (leaving out ‘Desert Journey’, ‘The Gun Runners’ and ‘Autokill’). It was repeated again on ITV4, later in the year, this time showing 29 out of 30 episodes (yet again, leaving out &#x27;Desert Journey&#x27;).

==Home media==
Episodes of this series were released on DVD in North America by A&amp;E Home Entertainment (under licence from Granada International Media Limited) and in the UK, where the full series has been released twice, with the most recent edition seeing Damon, Bastedo and Gaunt reunite to provide a commentary for several episodes. (Damon&#x27;s role on US series &quot;General Hospital&quot; meant that Bastedo and Gaunt had to be flown to America for it.)

The series was shown in Italy in the early 1980s in syndication, under the title (Three Aces) and, more recently, in the 1990s on Canal Jimmy (Sky) but an Italian DVD collection has never been released because in that country &quot;The Champions&quot; is an almost forgotten show, remembered only by few loyal fans.

In 2010, Network DVD re-released &quot;The Champions: The Complete Series&quot; as a complete DVD Region 2 box set of all episodes on nine discs (including the rare &#x27;bookends&#x27; version of the first episode). (Additionally, it released the music from the series on three CDs.)
== Adaptations ==
===&quot;Legend of the Champions&quot;===
In 1983, ITC edited the episodes &quot;The Beginning&quot; and &quot;The Interrogation&quot; into &quot;Legend of the Champions&quot;, a feature-length film intended for overseas markets.

ITC had released several such films before (notably with &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;), however in this case the two episodes were not simply joined, but substantially re-edited. &quot;The Interrogation&quot; formed the framing story; its original broadcast form some flashback sequences (mainly from &quot;The Beginning&quot;) had been used. These were expanded to contain almost the whole of the earlier episode. Additionally, new credits were filmed, not using any of the original actors but instead their photographs, taken at the time of the original production.

A plot change was the renaming of a character from the original version of &quot;The Beginning&quot; to accommodate a plot device in &quot;The Interrogation&quot;. In &quot;The Interrogation&quot;, Craig Stirling is ostensibly being quizzed on a character called Julius Retford, who remains unseen. For the film, the opening credits explicitly identify Retford as the character who in &quot;The Beginning&quot; was named Ho Ling (played by Ric Young). This allows the germ warfare theme of &quot;The Beginning&quot; to interlink with the sequences in &quot;The Interrogation&quot;. Confusingly, in the end credits Young is credited as playing &#x27;Ho Ling&#x27;, a name never used in the film version.

This release credited Stuart Damon as the star, with Alexandra Bastedo and William Gaunt receiving co-star credits. This was partly because Damon was a familiar face in U.S. daytime television by this time, and partly because &quot;The Interrogation&quot; is essentially a two-hander between Damon and Colin Blakely, with the rest of the regular cast appearing only briefly.

&quot;Legend of the Champions&quot; was released on DVD as part of the Network box-set.

Note: &#x27;Bookend&#x27; sequences were shot for the first episode &quot;The Beginning&quot; showing Richard Barrett (William Gaunt) recording the story on to a tape recorder in Tremayne&#x27;s office; this was done so that the episode could be shown out of order on repeat runs without causing any continuity problems. Both sequences were included as extras on the Network DVD box set.

===Film===
In November 2007, it was reported that Guillermo del Toro would produce and write a film adaptation of &quot;The Champions&quot; for United Artists. In 2008, Christopher McQuarrie was signed to co-write and co-produce the film. In 2021, it was announced that Ben Stiller would star in and direct a feature film adaptation with Cate Blanchett co-starring. The film will be produced by New Republic Pictures, ITV Studios America and Dirty Films.

Ultimately nothing came of these film projects.

<text>The Rebecca Riots () took place between 1839 and 1843 in West and Mid Wales. They were a series of protests undertaken by local farmers and agricultural workers in response to levels of taxation. The rioters, often men dressed as women, took their actions against toll-gates, as they were tangible representations of taxes and tolls. The rioters went by the name of which translates directly from Welsh as &#x27;Rebecca&#x27;s Daughters&#x27;. The riots ceased prior to 1844 due to several factors, including increased troop levels, a desire by the protestors to avoid violence, and the appearance of criminal groups using the guise of the biblical character Rebecca for their own purposes. In 1844 an act of Parliament to consolidate and amend the laws relating to turnpike trusts in Wales was passed.

==History==

===Events leading to the riots===
In the late 1830s and early 1840s, the agricultural communities of west Wales were in dire poverty. In 1837 and 1838 the whole country suffered from poor harvests, worse in the south west, where atrocious seasons of rain forced farmers to buy corn at famine prices to feed themselves, their animals and their families, which further eroded what little capital they had. Grain harvests collapsed, but the price of butter between 1837 and 1841, and sheep between 1839 and 1841, was relatively high, and even the low cattle prices of 1839 recovered by 1841. But by 1842 a general fall in prices occurred throughout the agricultural markets that continued into 1843. Cattle prices slumped sharply in 1842, and the blame was placed on the government, and in particular Robert Peel&#x27;s tariff measures which eased importation of foreign cattle and meat. In 1842, the harvest was one of the most successful in years, and that, combined with the contraction in demand from the Glamorgan ironworks, led to a slump in corn prices.

The farmers&#x27; economic position had therefore shifted from that of dire grain harvests with life supported by sheep and butter sales, to one where the price of their corn, when the weather was favourable, was very low. The diminution of the Glamorgan ironworks, coupled with the new tariff, also had an adverse effect on the prices of butter, cheese, pigs, horses, sheep and lean cattle, impacting harshly on the Welsh pastoral farmer.

The farmers were faced with a drastic reduction in their income, but had no financial relief in similar reductions in their outgoings, mainly rents, tithes, county rates, poor rates and the turnpike tolls. Farm rents were mainly static, but the tithes, tolls and poor rates increased. Seeing themselves as victims of &#x27;tyranny and oppression&#x27;, the farmers and their workers took the law into their own hands to rid themselves of these taxes. The first institutions to be attacked were the hated toll-gates.

In the early 19th century many toll-gates on the roads in Wales were operated by trusts which were supposed to maintain and improve the roads, funding this from tolls. However, many trusts charged high tolls but spent the money on other things. Even where this was not done, the toll-gate laws imposed an additional financial burden on poor farming communities. The &#x27;oppression&#x27;, felt by the farmers, began in the late 1830s, when a group of toll-renters bought the right to collect tolls in the region&#x27;s trusts (a common practice for turnpike trusts), who then tried to aggressively tried to recoup their investment. This group was led by Thomas Bullin, who was hated by those who paid his tolls. The main reason for his dislike was the exacting method of the toll collection and the big toll increases of side-bars. The side-bars were simple toll-gates, away from the main trunk roads, placed strategically on by-roads to catch any traffic that had tried to bypass the main toll booths via side lanes. These side-bars dramatically increased the cost of farmers&#x27; carting lime to their fields to fertilize or to reduce acidity in the soil. It was said that it cost ten times as much as the lime itself to cart it from Cardiff docks to a farm in the hills.

===Rebecca===

The first appearance of Rebecca or Beca, as the members called themselves, occurred in 1839. Although this precedes the economic events of 1842, the early appearances of Rebecca were sporadic isolated outbursts, with the true body of rioting not beginning until the winter of 1842. Although these early &#x27;uprisings&#x27; were few and uncommon, they were the first appearance of mobs dressed in the guise of Rebecca. These gangs became known as (Welsh for &quot;Rebecca&#x27;s Daughters&quot;) or merely the &quot;Rebeccas&quot;. The origin of their name is said to be a verse in the Bible, Genesis 24:60 - &#x27;And they blessed Rebekah and said unto her, Thou &quot;art&quot; our sister, be thou &quot;the mother&quot; of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them&#x27;. This verse was shouted many a time by religious townsfolk.

Before destroying the toll-gates, &#x27;Rebecca&#x27; would call to his followers who were also dressed as women and perform a scene which involved the following words:

The toll-gates would then be destroyed. Although not all members of the mob would wear women&#x27;s clothes, those that did, often in white gowns, would also blacken their faces or wear masks. The attacks were accompanied by much noise; and in the earliest, a mock trial would also take place.

The accepted leader of the first protests, Thomas Rees (), wore women&#x27;s clothes when leading attacks. Some versions of the story say that these were borrowed from a woman called Rebecca living near his home at the foot of the Preseli Hills. The story states that this woman was an old maid and her clothes were borrowed because she was the only woman tall enough and large enough in the village. Local records do not bear this out—and the wearing of women&#x27;s clothes was an established part of traditional Welsh justice (the , &#x27;wooden horse&#x27;), of which is remembered as a notoriously enthusiastic participant.

The bears many similarities to the Rebeccas, with men wearing female clothing, blackening their faces and conducting mock trials; and was on a significant increase in the late 1830s in Wales. The was a way of frightening and punishing members of a community, of whom wrongdoing was suspected, but little will or evidence existed to bring the person to justice. Normally &#x27;crimes&#x27; punished by the included marital infidelity or informing on a neighbour. Other examples of rebels cross-dressing, destroying toll booths, and adopting shared pseudonyms can be found in British history going back at least as far as the Western Rising.

===The riots===

The Rebecca Riots were a response not only against the toll-gates, but also other factors affecting Welsh farming communities. The toll-gates were chosen as the most tangible representation of the system the rioters so despised. Their only other option would have been the union workhouses, as the Poor Law was as hated as the toll roads; but these could be easily defended and were often garrisoned by troops.

The first protests led by &quot;Rebecca&quot; destroyed the toll-gates at Yr Efail Wen in two attacks in Carmarthenshire in 1839. These were believed to be led by Twm, though he did not appear to participate in further riots when the attacks flared again three years later. Other communities later adopted the name and disguise, and other grievances besides the toll-gates were aired in the riots. Anglican clergymen from the established Church of England (now the disestablished Church in Wales) were targets on several occasions. The Church of England could demand tithes and other ecclesiastical benefits even though most of the population of Wales were Nonconformists. Other victims were petty local villains such as the fathers of illegitimate children.

The next time the Rebeccas assembled was roughly three years later, when Tom Bullin was allowed to raise a toll-gate by the Mermaid Tavern near St Clears. This was an obvious &#x27;trap&#x27; side-bar, and angered the locals, who destroyed it and two other gates. Other toll-gates to be target included the Bolgoed toll-gate on the outskirts of Pontarddulais. On 6 July 1843 the Bolgoed toll-gate was attacked and destroyed by a group of some 200 men.

In mid-July 1843, letters were sent from representatives of the Rebeccas, targeting the landlords of farmers, and thus reflecting a shift away from a focus on tollgate alone towards more general grievances against the landlord class. These threatening letters warned the landlords to make reductions in the rent of their tenant farmers. The summer of 1843 also saw farmers conducting open meetings demanding a lowering of rent by at least a third. The threats came to little and the meetings had no effect, and the rents remained the same, though by August farmers had changed tactics to calling for an independent assessment of the regulations of rents.

The riots resulted in at least one murder, in the small village of Hendy on 7 September 1843, in which a young woman and gate keeper named Sarah Williams was killed. She had been warned beforehand that the rioters were on their way but refused to leave. On the night of her death she could be heard shouting &quot;I know who you are&quot; by a family living up the road who had locked their doors from the rioters. Williams called for help at the house of John Thomas, a labourer, to extinguish a fire at the toll-gate, but when she returned to the toll house, a shot was heard. Williams returned to the house of John Thomas, and collapsed at the threshold of the house. Two minutes later she was dead.

From August 1843, local and open protest meetings were taking the place of riots, partly due to the farmers scaling back on violent activity, and also due to the increasing presence of troop numbers. Another major factor that saw the riots reduce were the activities of a group of petty criminals masquerading as Rebecca operating from Five Roads near Llanelli. This group, led by known trouble-maker John Jones (Shoni Sguborfawr) and his associate David Davies (Dai&#x27;r Cantwr), who were eventually convicted and transported to Australia, turned more respectable people away from Rebecca. Jones, unlike Davies, was not convicted of crimes during the riots, but for a later assault charge.

==Aftermath==

By late 1843, the riots had stopped. Although Rebecca had failed to produce an immediate effect on the lives of the farmers she had sought to serve, the very nature of a leaderless uprising of the downtrodden peasantry in an attempt to obtain justice from an unfair system, was an important socio-political event within Wales. In the aftermath of the riots, some rent reductions were achieved, the toll rates were improved (although destroyed toll-houses were rebuilt) and the protests prompted several reforms, including a royal commission into the question of toll roads, which led to the (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 91). This act consolidated the trusts, simplified the rates and reduced the hated toll on lime movement by half. More importantly, the riots inspired later Welsh protests. These included opposition to the privatisation of salmon reserves on the River Wye in the 1860s and 70s, which became known as &#x27;the second Rebecca riots&#x27;, and the formation in the 1970s of the radical arts collective known as the Beca group.

As late as December 1910, the historic horn used to gather the Rebeccaites was sounded during the general election campaign to signify the arrival of the car carrying Liberal candidate John Hinds for a meeting at Bethania Chapel, Talog.

The toll house near Porthmadog, at the south-eastern end of the Cob, was built for collection of the tolls which were introduced when the long embankment opened in 1811. A tariff of toll charges from the 19th century is still to be seen on the front of the building. The Cob’s private operator was authorised by an 1807 act of Parliament, Madocks&#x27; Estate Act 1807 (47 Geo. 3 Sess. 2 c. xxxvi), to levy tolls on road vehicles which crossed. In April 1978 the rights were purchased by a local body called the Rebecca Trust, which continued to levy a 5p toll per vehicle for 25 years. Surplus funds were distributed annually to local good causes. Tolls ended on 29 March 2003, after the Welsh Government bought the Cob from the trust.
==In popular culture==
=== Literature ===
The Rebecca Riots were the setting for the novel &quot;Hosts of Rebecca&quot; by Alexander Cordell.

One of the earliest novels about the Rebecca Riots was written by Welsh author Amy Dillwyn, who wrote &quot;The Rebecca Rioter&quot;, first published in 1880. 

The Rebecca Riots play an important part in the plot of the novel &quot;The Sheep-stealers&quot; by Violet Jacob, first published in 1902.

A more recent novel is &quot;Children of Rebecca&quot; by Vivien Annis Bailey, published by Honno in 1995.

A later crime thriller by Alis Hawkins &quot;None So Blind&quot; published by Canelo in 2021, , describes the fight of a blind lawyer against Rebeccas who probably murdered his youthful enamourata.

Mary Balogh&#x27;s historical romance &quot;Truly&quot; deals in great detail with the causes and actions of Rebecca Riots. Her story is told from the perspective of residents of one small community but references the poverty, violence and punishments associated with this movement. 

=== Film ===
In 1948 Dylan Thomas wrote the screenplay for a film, &quot;Rebecca&#x27;s Daughters&quot;, which was published as a novel of the same name in 1965. The film was not released until 1992, and starred Peter O&#x27;Toole, Paul Rhys and Joely Richardson. The 44 years between the writing of the screenplay and the release of the film is the longest on record.

=== Music ===
The name Rebecca is also mentioned in the context of the Merthyr Rising of 1831 in the song &quot;Ironmasters&quot; by the British folkpunk band The Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang on their album &quot;Night of a Thousand Candles&quot;. The phrase &quot;The Rebeccas ride at dawn, petticoat ghost and Tom. Working to reclaim the land for no reward&quot; is found in the song &quot;Newtown Jericho&quot; from rock band The Alarm. A song called &quot;Rebecca Run&quot;, written and performed by the duo (Daniel and Mandy) is completely about the Rebecca Riots.

<doc id="1075854" wikidata="Q5158815" url="?curid=1075854" title="Concord Hymn">
<text>&quot;Concord Hymn&quot; (original title &quot;Hymn: Sung at the Completion of the Concord Monument, April 19, 1836&quot;) is a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson written for the 1837 dedication of an obelisk monument in Concord, Massachusetts, commemorating the battles of Lexington and Concord, a series of battles and skirmishes on April 19, 1775 which sparked the American Revolutionary War. The poem was the origin of the phrase &quot;shot heard round the world&quot;.

==History== 
In October 1834, Emerson went to live with his step-grandfather Ezra Ripley in Concord, at what was later named The Old Manse— less than a hundred paces from the spot where the battle took place. In 1835, he purchased a home on the Cambridge and Concord Turnpike and quickly became one of Concord&#x27;s leading citizens. That same year he was asked to give a public lecture commemorating the town&#x27;s 200th anniversary.

The &quot;Concord Hymn&quot; was written at the request of the Battle Monument Committee. At Concord&#x27;s Independence Day celebration on July 4, 1837, it was first read, then sung as a hymn by a local choir using the then-familiar tune &quot;Old Hundredth&quot;.

The poem elevates the battle above a simple event, setting Concord as the spiritual center of the American nation, removes specific details about the battle itself, and exalts a general spirit of revolution and freedom— a spirit Emerson hoped would outlive those who fought in the battle. One source of the hymn&#x27;s power may be Emerson&#x27;s personal ties to the subject: his grandfather William Emerson Sr., witnessed the battle at the North Bridge while living at the Old Manse.

Emerson&#x27;s poem was widely published in newspaper accounts of the dedication. In contrast there is no record of Congressman Samuel Hoar&#x27;s speech that day. The poem, originally printed as a broadside for distribution at the monument&#x27;s dedication, was republished as the last poem in Emerson&#x27;s first edition of &quot;Poems&quot; in December 1848 (the book, however, was dated 1847). In that edition the poem appeared with the three line title &quot;HYMN: / SUNG AT THE COMPLETION OF THE CONCORD MONUMENT, / April 19, 1836.&quot; Emerson apparently confused the date of the 1837 dedication a decade earlier, July 4, Independence Day, with the anniversary of the battle, April 19, Patriots&#x27; Day and the inscription on the obelisk mentions that it was &quot;erected&quot; in 1836.

Emerson&#x27;s line &quot;the shot heard round the world&quot; is a fixture in the lore of the American Revolution, and the opening stanza is inscribed beneath the Daniel Chester French &quot;The Minute Man&quot; statue dedicated (along with a replica of the Old North Bridge) at the 1875 commemoration of the original battle. &quot;Concord Hymn&quot; established Emerson as a poet; he was previously known as a lecturer and essayist. Emerson biographer Robert Richardson notes the phrase has since become the most famous line he ever wrote. Concord&#x27;s centennial celebration of Emerson&#x27;s birth in 1903 ended with a singing of the hymn.

==Text==

&lt;poem&gt;
By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,
Here once the embattled farmers stood,
And fired [the?] shot heard round the world

The foe long since in silence slept;
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;
And Time the ruined bridge has swept;
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.

On this green bank, by this soft stream,
We set today a votive stone;
That memory may their deed redeem,
When, like our sires, our sons are gone.

Spirit, that made those heroes dare,
To die, and leave their children free,
Bid Time and Nature gently spare
The shaft we raise to them and thee.
&lt;/poem&gt;

(Note: This version is from &quot;The Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson&quot; (1904), edited by Edward Waldo Emerson, who noted, &quot;From a copy of this hymn as first printed on slips for distribution among the Concord people at the celebration of the completion of the monument on the battle-ground, I note the differences from the poem here given as finally revised by Mr. Emerson in the &quot;Selected Poems&quot;.&quot;)

<text>Ana González González (January 7, 1908 – February 18, 1997) better known as Ana G. Méndez was a Puerto Rican educator who founded the Ana G. Méndez University System in Puerto Rico.

== Early years ==
Méndez was one of eight children born to Francisco González Monje and Ana González Cofresí in Aguada, Puerto Rico. She was a direct descendant of the Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresí, on her mother&#x27;s side. In 1935, Méndez graduated from high school in Santurce; she earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in commercial education from the University of Puerto Rico in 1940. It was during the 1940s that she realised that students should have the option of having a short term college for a commercial or technical career, this led in 1941, to her founding the Puerto Rican High School of Commerce with 3 teachers and nine students.

== Personal life ==
She got married when she was 15 years old to José Méndez Rivera and they had three children together named, Dora Méndez González, Grecia Méndez González and José Méndez González.

== Founder of Puerto Rico Junior College ==
In 1948, Méndez graduated from New York University with a master&#x27;s degree. In 1948, she founded the Puerto Rico Junior College in Río Piedras with 19 students; this became the first educational institution in Puerto Rico to offer an associate degree (2 year college). An educational visionary, Méndez founded universities, television stations, college classes by mail and as mentioned above the associate degree.

== Universities founded by Méndez ==
Among the universities founded by Méndez are:

* The University of Turabo, which is located in Caguas, Puerto Rico with branches in Cayey, Isabela, Ponce, Yabucoa, Barceloneta and Naguabo.
* The Universidad del Este (University of the East), which is located in Carolina, Puerto Rico with branches in Santa Isabel, Cabo Rojo, Barceloneta, Utuado and in Yauco;
* The Metropolitan University, which is located in Cupey with branches in Bayamón, Aguadilla, Jayuya, and in Comerío.

== Ana G. Méndez Foundation ==
Méndez also founded the &quot;Ana G. Méndez Foundation&quot; which grants scholarships to outstanding students and she also found TV Channel 40 &quot;The Ana G. Méndez Educational Channel&quot;. What today is known as the &quot;Ana G. Méndez University System&quot; and started with only nine students, now has over 17,000 students, 800 professors and 500 administrative employees.

== Legacy ==
In 1965, Méndez became the &quot;first&quot; and only Puerto Rican woman amongst the Board of Directors of Eastern Air Lines. In 1975, the Catholic University of Puerto Rico awarded to Méndez an honorary doctoral degree in humanities.
Ana G. Méndez died on 18 February 1997 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico honored her memory by naming an avenue in San Juan after her. On 10 July 2003, Mayor Buddy Dyer of Orlando, Florida, announced the opening of the &quot;Ana G. Méndez Metro Orlando University&quot;.

<doc id="1075859" wikidata="Q7762903" url="?curid=1075859" title="The Second Coming (Percy novel)">
<text>The Second Coming is a 1980 novel by Walker Percy. It is a sequel to &quot;The Last Gentleman&quot;. It tells the story of middle-aged Will Barrett and his relationship with Allison, a young woman who has escaped from a mental hospital. The book was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1980.

The novel spends much of its content in unspoken but printed dialog of Will Barrett (the principal character) with himself and/or people he has dealt with in his past. He talks his way through his memories and realizes he is a character who suffers from the affliction that his father had: the belief that life – as most people (including him) live it – is worse than death. His father&#x27;s solution was to kill himself (as did Percy&#x27;s own father and grandfather), but his father also opted to try to kill him (Will), in order to save him from the life of despair that his father knows will befall him. He reflects on these occurrences throughout the book.

Barrett decides he will put God to the test. He will enter a cave near his home in North Carolina, telling no one what he is doing but leaving notes in case he does not return, and take barbiturates until God proves His existence and love by saving him, or he dies, thus demonstrating God does not exist. After a literal dark night of the soul at the end of which he is brought out of his drugged stupor by shooting pain from an abscessed tooth, he is figuratively reborn, falling out of the cavern and into the care of a woman who is a refugee from an insane asylum. Whereas he cannot escape the past, she can only live in the present, bereft of memory by prior electroshock therapy. Two maimed and incomplete people come together and somehow make each other whole, and Will Barrett is, however briefly, redeemed through love of and with another. The book represents a remarkable depiction of the human struggle with faith.

This work contains Percy&#x27;s musings on &quot;ravening particles,&quot; a reference to the alienation and anomie the individual feels from both within and without in the absence of faith.

==Film adaptation==
In March 2023, it was announced that Aaron Magnani optioned the screen rights for a film adaptation, with Magnani as producer and Peter Arneson adapting the script.

<doc id="1075862" wikidata="Q7016195" url="?curid=1075862" title="2004 New Zealand local elections">
<text>Triennial elections for all 74 cities, districts, twelve regional councils and all district health boards in New Zealand were held on 9 October 2004. Most councils were elected using the first-past-the-post method, but ten (of which Wellington City was the largest) were elected using the single transferable vote (STV) method. It was the first time that the STV method was available; the change came through successful lobbying by Rod Donald.

==District health board elections==
Elections for the 21 district health boards (DHBs) were first held alongside the 2001 local elections. The government had hoped to use the STV voting method from the start but this could not be achieved and in 2001, first-past-the-post voting (FPP) was used based on local wards. For the 2004 elections, the STV method was used. From 2004 onwards, DHB candidates have been elected at large (i.e. across the whole voting area).

==STV voting method==
Apart from the district health boards, ten district or city councils used the STV method for the 2004 local elections: Kaipara, Papakura, Matamata-Piako, Thames-Coromandel, Kāpiti Coast, Porirua, Wellington, Marlborough, Dunedin, and the Chatham Islands.

A private company, elections.com and its subsidiary Datamail, had been engaged by seven councils, eighteen DHBs, and one licensing trust with operating the STV elections. During the weekend of the elections, it was discovered that when voting papers were transferred to computer-readable data, not all data were correctly recorded. The Office of the Auditor-General became involved and tasked with confirming the election results. The final results for these elections became available in early November, nearly one month after the local election. The government initiated a select committee inquiry.

<text>USS &quot;Kingfish&quot; (SS-234), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the kingfish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Kingfish&quot; was laid down on 29 August 1941 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 2 March 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Harry A. Stuart, wife of Rear Admiral Harry A. Stuart, and commissioned on 20 May 1942, with Lieutenant Commander Vernon L. &quot;Rebel&quot; Lowrance in command.

== First war patrol, September – November 1942 ==
&quot;Kingfish&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor from New London 31 August 1942, and sailed on her first war patrol from there 9 September. Patrolling close to Japan&#x27;s coast, &quot;Kingfish&quot; sighted a three-ship convoy and fired a three-torpedo spread at the last freighter, scoring one hit. Unable to determine the extent of the damage due to an uncomfortably efficient barrage of depth charges (lasting 18 hours), &quot;Kingfish&quot; successfully outwitted her attackers and cleared the area.

Sighting freighter &quot;Yomei Maru&quot; 1 October, &quot;Kingfish&quot; fired a three torpedo spread which sent her to the bottom. Going deep for the inevitable depth charging, &quot;Kingfish&quot; reloaded her tubes and continued scouting shipping lanes. Four days later she sighted and torpedoed a freighter off Muroto Zaki but could not verify the sinking. Two weeks of frustration followed due to lack of targets. On 23 October the freighter &quot;Seiko Maru&quot; was sighted and sent to the bottom by two torpedoes. Completing her first war patrol, &quot;Kingfish&quot; arrived Midway Atoll 3 November.

== Second and third war patrols, November 1942 – April 1943 ==
After refit &quot;Kingfish&quot; sailed 25 November to Chichi-jima on her second war patrol. Entering the South China Sea 5 December, she sighted freighter &quot;Hino Maru No. 3&quot; and sank it two days later. Then, on 28 December, she sent another freighter, &quot;Choyo Maru&quot;, to the bottom. Two trawlers were attacked by gunfire early in January. The first target was riddled and set afire, and the second sunk by gunfire. &quot;Kingfish&quot; ended this patrol at Pearl Harbor 23 January 1943.

&quot;Kingfish&quot; was underway for her third war patrol 16 February. On the sub&#x27;s passage to Formosa, she sank a trawler off the Bonin Islands and torpedoed a passenger freighter. Damage to this ship could not be ascertained as the submarine was immediately attacked by enemy bombs and depth charges. On 17 March, a freighter was tracked and a precise torpedo spread damaged it considerably. Two days later &quot;Kingfish&quot; sighted, tracked, and sank a troop transport as enemy troops scrambled down her sides.

On 23 March, &quot;Kingfish&quot; was subjected to a severe depth charge attack. The attack was so intense and the damage so great that secret codes and material were burned in preparation for abandoning ship. The last string of depth charges bashed in the main induction piping, allowing a huge bubble to escape to the surface; this apparently caused the enemy to think the ship had sunk. &quot;Kingfish&quot; cautiously surfaced, cleared the area and set course for Pearl Harbor, arriving 9 April with a grateful crew. The submarine then proceeded to Mare Island Navy Yard, where entire sections of the boat were rebuilt and installed.

== Fourth and fifth war patrols, July – November 1943 ==
Battle damage repaired, &quot;Kingfish&quot; sailed back to Pearl Harbor, arriving 23 June 1943. Eight days later he sailed for her fourth war patrol, this one to the Babuyan Channel, north of the Philippines, off southern Formosa, and near Manila. &quot;Kingfish&quot; was ordered to depart the patrol area due to lack of enemy activity and to report to Fremantle, Australia, for refit.

Assigned the South China Sea for her fifth patrol area, &quot;Kingfish&quot; cleared Fremantle 24 September. She was assigned two special missions for this patrol. The first entailed planting mines in enemy shipping lanes; the second involved the secret and successful landing of a party of Allied personnel and equipment on the northeast coast of Borneo. Continuing on her patrol, &quot;Kingfish&quot; sank a gunboat by gunfire and damaged a tanker with torpedoes 9 October off Sibutu Islands. She sank cargo ship &quot;Sana Maru&quot; off Cape Varella 20 October. Her patrol a success, &quot;Kingfish&quot; sailed into Fremantle 14 November 1943.

== Sixth, seventh, and eighth war patrols, December 1943 – June 1944 ==
&quot;Kingfish&quot; departed Fremantle on 16 December 1943 with a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander H. L. Jukes. Threading her way in the South China Sea, she made first contact on 3 January when she sent tankers &quot;Ryuei Maru&quot; and &quot;Bokuei Maru&quot; to the bottom, and sank tanker &quot;Fushimi Maru No. 3&quot; 7 January. Having navigated brilliantly through extremely dangerous waters and having outwitted the enemy escort vessels, &quot;Kingfish&quot; headed for Pearl Harbor with a proud record, arriving 26 January 1944.

&quot;Kingfish&quot;&#x27;s seventh war patrol was in the Mariana Islands area from 19 February – 9 April 1944. The submarine made no attacks during this patrol, although the boat underwent a bombing and depth charge attack. &quot;Kingfish&quot; departed her patrol area, arriving Majuro, Marshall Islands, 9 April for refit.

The submarine&#x27;s eighth war patrol was made in the Bonins. Since this patrol was also unfruitful due to the lack of worthwhile targets, &quot;Kingfish&quot; received orders to return to Midway, arriving there 19 June. While there she was ordered to Mare Island, for overhaul.

== Ninth and tenth war patrols, October 1944 – February 1945 ==
Her overhaul completed, and with a new commanding officer, (Commander T. E. Harper, &quot;Kingfish&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor on her ninth war patrol 12 October. On 24 October, the day &quot;Kingfish&quot; entered her patrol area, she spotted freighter &quot;Ikutagawa Maru&quot; and sent her to the bottom off Chichi Jima Retto. Three days later she sank the cargo ship &quot;Tokai Maru No. 4&quot; and a landing craft transport off Kita, Iwo Jima. Changing patrol areas to Okinawa, &quot;Kingfish&quot; tracked a convoy but was unable to attack. The submarine completed her patrol at Guam 28 November.

On 23 December 1944 &quot;Kingfish&quot; steamed out of Guam toward the Japanese home islands for her tenth war patrol. A convoy was sighted 2 January 1945, but heavy weather prevented the submarine from attacking. The following night she made up for lost time, sending the freighter &quot;Yaei Maru&quot; and the passenger/cargo ship &quot;Shibozono Maru&quot; to the bottom. For the remainder of the patrol &quot;Kingfish&quot; was assigned the additional task of &quot;lifeguard&quot; duties for carrier air strikes. She returned to Guam 1 February.

== Eleventh and twelfth war patrols, March – August 1945 ==
The submarine refitted at Guam and sailed 6 March, operating in a coordinated attack group with and . Despite thorough coverage, no targets worthy of torpedo fire were encountered. However, late in March &quot;Kingfish&quot; experienced the great pleasure of rescuing four downed aviators from a British task force. Leaving the area, &quot;Kingfish&quot; debarked the British aviators at Saipan and set course for Pearl Harbor, arriving 25 April.

Departing Hawaii 17 June with a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander T. D. Keegan, the submarine sailed via Guam for the Japanese island of Honshū. In smartly executed night gun attacks, she sank two sampan picket boats off Honshū 5 August. She also exploded several drifting mines during this patrol. Having completed her 12th and last war patrol, &quot;Kingfish&quot; arrived Midway 2 hours before the war ended.

== Post-war service ==
&quot;Kingfish&quot; got underway for Galveston, Tex., 27 August &quot;via&quot; Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal, arriving 23 September. She sailed to Orange, Tex., 25 October for Navy Day.
&quot;Kingfish&quot; sailed 30 October to New London, Conn., arriving 5 November. There, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve 9 March 1946. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 March 1960. On 6 October 1960, she was sold for scrap to Albert Heller.

 made 12 war patrols, sinking 14 enemy ships totaling 48,866 tons, and was awarded 9 battle stars for World War II service.

<text>The Washington State Legislature is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Washington. It is a bicameral body, composed of the lower Washington House of Representatives, composed of 98 Representatives, and the upper Washington State Senate, with 49 Senators plus the Lieutenant Governor acting as president. The state is divided into 49 legislative districts, each of which elect one senator and two representatives.

The State Legislature meets in the Legislative Building at the Washington State Capitol in Olympia.

As of January 2025, Democrats control both houses of the Washington State Legislature. Democrats hold a 59–39 majority in the House of Representatives and a 30–19 majority in the Senate.

==History==
The Washington State Legislature traces its ancestry to the creation of the Washington Territory in 1853, following successful arguments from settlers north of the Columbia River to the U.S. federal government to legally separate from the Oregon Territory. The Washington Territorial Assembly, as the newly created area&#x27;s bicameral legislature, convened the following year. The legislature represented settlers from the Strait of Juan de Fuca to modern Montana.

===The Female Voting Franchise===
From nearly the start of the territory, arguments over giving women the right to vote dogged legislative proceedings. While some legislators carried genuine concerns over women deserving the right to vote, most legislators pragmatically believed that giving women suffrage would entice more Eastern women to immigrate to the remote and sparsely populated territory. In 1854, only six years after the Seneca Falls Convention, the issue was brought to a vote by the legislature. Women&#x27;s suffrage was defeated in a tied vote of 9 to 9 (an absolute majority, or 10 votes, was needed to pass laws). This was due to one legislator voting against this bill because he had an American Indian wife and only white women would have been able to vote.

A decade later, the Wyoming Legislature would become the first body in the United States to grant women&#x27;s suffrage in 1869.

The issue over female suffrage did not diminish. In 1871 Susan B. Anthony and Thurston County Representative Daniel Bigelow addressed the legislature on the issue. In 1883, the issue returned to the floor, this time with the Territorial Assembly successfully passing universal suffrage for women. It quickly became one of the most liberal voting laws in the nation, giving female African-American voters the voting franchise for the first time in the United States. However, in 1887, the territorial Washington Supreme Court ruled the 1883 universal suffrage act as unconstitutional in &quot;Harland v. Washington&quot;. Another attempt by the legislature to regrant universal female suffrage was again overturned in 1888.

After two failed voter referendums in 1889 and 1897, activism led by Emma Smith DeVoe and May Arkwright Hutton, among others, led the state legislature to approve the state constitutional amendment granting full female voting rights, which Washington&#x27;s (male) voters ratified in 1910 by a vote of 52,299 to 29,676.

===Statehood===
With more than two decades of pressure on federal authorities to authorize statehood, on February 22, 1889, the U.S. Congress passed the Enabling Act, signed into law by outgoing President Grover Cleveland, authorizing the territories of Washington, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana to form state governments. The Territorial Assembly set out to convene a constitutional convention to write a state constitution.

Following its successful passage by the legislature, Washington voters approved the new document on October 1. On November 11, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison authorized Washington to become the 42nd state of United States. It was the last West Coast state of the Continental U.S. to achieve statehood. The modern Washington State Legislature was created.

==Meetings==
The bicameral body is composed of legislators, beginning the legislative session annually on the second Monday in January. In odd-numbered years, when the state budget is debated upon, the State Legislature meets for 105 days, and in even-numbered years for 60 days. The Governor of Washington can call legislators in for a special 30-day session at any time. Legislators also can call themselves into special session by a two-thirds vote by both the House of Representatives and the State Senate.

===Television coverage===
Debates within both the House and Senate, as well as committee meetings and other special events within or relating to the legislature are broadcast throughout Washington on TVW, the state public affairs network. Debates can also be found on the web at TVW.org.

==Vacancies==
Unlike some state legislatures, the Washington State Legislature does not hold a special election between general elections if a seat becomes vacant in the middle of a term. Instead, the county central committee of the political party that last held the seat in the county that contains the district nominates three candidates and the board of county commissioners chooses among them. A special election is then held alongside November general elections. Where a district spans counties, the state central committee of the party selects the candidates and the boards of county commissioners of all the counties jointly choose one.

==Compensation==
As of July 2022, legislators receive an annual salary of $57,876. The Speaker of the House and Senate majority leader receive salaries of $66,016, while the House and Senate minority leaders receive salaries of $61,946. Per diem is set at 89% of the federal per diem rate and is $185 as of 2022.

<doc id="1075877" wikidata="Q5948431" url="?curid=1075877" title="Hurricane shutter">
<text>Hurricane coverings, commonly known as shutters, are used in hurricane mitigation to protect houses and other structures from damage caused by storms. Hurricane shutters are used to prevent windows from being broken by flying objects during a storm. Although the negative pressure caused by high-speed wind flowing over a building roof can cause the roof to fail with the building envelope intact, broken windows allow the air pressure to rise inside a building, creating an even greater pressure difference and increasing the likelihood of roof failure.

Shutters are frequently constructed from steel or aluminium, but homeowners sometimes use the low-cost alternative of plywood. The shutters are affixed to the outside of the building with screws, hurricane clips, or a track system. Advanced shutters may be motorized, and they may fold away when not in use.

==Types of hurricane coverings==

Three major types of shutters are known alternatively as panel systems. They are usually made of plywood, metal (aluminium or steel), or polycarbonate plastic. Lexan panels are transparent, and may be flat or have been heat-formed into a corrugated shape to further increase impact resistance. Panels must be attached to the structure via screws in a direct mount or on tracks. When not in use, storm panels are stored in an easy to reach location. Newly constructed homes sometimes have an assigned area for storage of storm panels.

Another type of shutter is an accordion shutter which is made from interlocking vertical blades which slide into place horizontally.

Another type is the roll-up or rolling shutter, consisting of a series of slats that form a curtain with both sides of the curtain being inserted into guide rails. The curtain is then rolled onto an axle which is covered by a housing. Rolling shutters can be operated manually by gear, by pull strap or can be motorized independently or in conjunction with a manual override. Motorized shutters can be operated by either a switch or remote and can be controlled either individually or in groups. 

On loss of power caused by hurricanes, motorized shutters must be operated manually, requiring either access to the motor (which can be difficult) or a pre-installed manual override. Most often, a manual override is operated using a gear. When deployed, all hurricane shutters require special techniques for firefighters to gain access to the interior of a structure.

Other types are the Bahamas, Colonials, and Tapco Hurricane Screens. Bahama shutters are mounted above the window creating shade when they are open, and when in use, they are brought down and secured over the window. Colonials are similar to the wooden shutters, but are made of aluminum. They hinge on the side of the windows and swing shut to protect the opening. Tapco Hurricane Screens are powder coated and made out of heavy-duty aluminum frames with stainless steel mesh used for the screening material.

Also used are awning shutters, with a horizontal hinge above the opening being protected.

Hurricane fabric coverings are a newer, relatively lower cost type of shutter. Tested and approved systems are made from polypropylene fibers, polyamide fibers or from laminated or cast PVC.

In 2011, a flat hurricane shutter system developed by UltraTek Worldwide was approved by Florida Building Code. The unique system uses a synthetic rubber bracket to absorb hurricane forces, allowing a panel that is completely clear while weighing 11.3 oz/square foot, nearly half the weight of a traditional metal panel.

==Building codes for hurricane shutters==
Both the International Building Code (IBC) and the International Residential Code use the criteria set forth in ASTM E1886 &amp; E1996 with regards to hurricane building material product approval. These test method norms describe the standardized tests to measure the impact resistance of a shutter and its resistance to cyclic wind pressure. The IBC&#x27;s requirements are adaptable to all levels of required wind speed.

The term impact resistant is defined as shutters, windows, and doors that have been proven to resist the impact from large windborne debris (defined by the test standards as a 9-pound 2x4 lumber missile striking end on at 34 mph).

The Florida Building Code (FBC) is in most aspects similar to the IBC in regard to the testing and approval of hurricane shutters. According to the code, shutters are required for home built since 2001 unless the windows use impact-resistant glass. The Miami-Dade County norms, often considered the most stringent requirements for hurricane shutters, rely on self-developed testing methods TAS201, 202 and 203. Passing the tests prescribed by the TAS norms is required only for shutters approved for use in the Florida HVHZ (High Velocity Hurricane Zone). The Florida Building Code will accept testing performed by TAS methods for inclusion in the FBC Database of approved building products.

Both Miami-Dade County and the State of Florida maintain web-searchable databases of products approved for use as hurricane protection. These typically include not only actual test results from certified independent testing laboratories, they also contain &quot;Product Approval Drawings&quot; or &quot;Installation Instructions&quot; which provide specifications for hurricane shutter assembly and installation. Both the product and installation method must be shown to be in compliance with these drawings in order for a shutter to be considered &quot;code-rated&quot;.

Besides the Florida Building Code and Miami-Dade County, there is also the Code from the Texas Department of Insurance commonly known as TDI. The Code from the Texas Department of Insurance is in many aspects similar to the International Building Code.

<doc id="1075886" wikidata="Q6149043" url="?curid=1075886" title="Jan Hellriegel">
<text>Jan Hellriegel is a singer/songwriter based in Auckland, New Zealand.

Her first recorded appearances were with Dunedin band Working With Walt in the mid-1980s when she studied at the University of Otago in Dunedin. She then formed all-woman band Cassandra&#x27;s Ears, moving back to Auckland and going solo in the early 90s.

Hellriegel has released four solo studio albums, &quot;It&#x27;s My Sin&quot; 1992, &quot;Tremble&quot; 1995, &quot;All Grown Up&quot; 2009, and &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; in 2019.

==History==

===Early===
Hellriegel was born and raised in West Auckland with her three brothers and attended Henderson High School. She famously worked in her father&#x27;s panel beating shop, though only in the office. Nonetheless, the combination of her birthplace and early employment led to her being branded a &quot;Westie&quot; by the New Zealand media.

Hellriegel took vocal training in speech and singing at St Mary&#x27;s College, Auckland under Sister Mary Leo. She then moved to Dunedin in the 1980s to attend the University of Otago, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.

While in Dunedin, she joined her brother Rob Hellriegel&#x27;s band, Working With Walt. She performed backing vocals, piano and guitar on their 1984 7&quot; LP &quot;The Prophet&quot; and wrote and performed the song &quot;Christina&quot; on the band’s 1985 LP &quot;4 Sides&quot;.

In 1988, Hellriegel performed backing vocals on the Leonard Cohen song &quot;So Long Marianne&quot;, performed by Straitjacket Fits.

===Cassandra’s Ears===
In the late 1980s Hellriegel formed the band Cassandra&#x27;s Ears with Dunedin bandmates Flick Rhind (bass), Zan Wright (backing vocals), Vanessa Anich (drums) and Leanne Ibell (guitar). She wrote music and lyrics and performed vocals, guitar and keyboards.

Their first release was the song &quot;Replacements&quot; for the National Student Radio 1986 compilation, &quot;Weird Culture Weird Custom&quot;. The band played local gigs, toured New Zealand, wrote more material, and eventually released two EPs, &quot;Private Wasteland&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Your Estimation&quot; in 1990.

Cassandra&#x27;s Ears reformed in November 2010 for a one-off show in Auckland to support the release of &quot;The Cassandra&#x27;s Ears Story&quot;.

===Solo career===
Hellriegel signed with Warner Records New Zealand in 1990. Her first album, &quot;It’s My Sin&quot;, was recorded between December 1991 and January 1992. Her second album, &quot;Tremble&quot;, was recorded at Sing Sing in Melbourne and Studios 301 in Sydney in 1995. In 1996 she was awarded Most Promising Female Vocalist at the New Zealand Music Awards, and Top Female Vocalist and Single of the Year (for Manic) at the Music and Entertainer Awards of New Zealand. She left Warner Brothers

Hellriegel subsequently parted ways with Warner Records, and her single &quot;Melusine&quot;, recorded at Beaver Studios (Auckland), was released by Universal Records in 1998. 

In 1999, she joined the Alan Duff Charitable Foundation Duffy Books in Homes programme as a celebrity spokesperson. She co-wrote the theme song &quot;Read About It&quot; with Dave Dobbyn and Toi Iti. During that year she played a non-musical acting role on &quot;Shortland Street&quot;, playing Jackie, an abused wife.

In 2000, she appeared in the New Zealand television show &quot;Street Legal&quot; and in 2001 she became involved in a collaboration with Tom Blaxland called Project Runway. In 2002, she wrote and recorded the song &quot;Star Baby&quot; for children’s clothing label Pumpkin Patch.

In early 2009 Hellriegel went into Roundhead Studios in Auckland to record a third album with a line-up of musicians including producer Wayne Bell, Nick Gaffaney on drums, Brett Adams and Ben Fulton on guitar, Eddie Rayner and Michael Larsen on piano/keyboards, and Mark Hughes on bass. &quot;All Grown Up&quot; was released on her own record label, Blind Date Records, in October 2009. The album &quot;Lost Songs&quot; was released in April 2013. The album is a collection of previously unreleased materialdemos, live sessions and studio work from 1990–2000 which Hellriegel had remastered from DAT and cassette recordings.

<doc id="1075887" wikidata="Q57783" url="?curid=1075887" title="John Key">
<text>Sir John Phillip Key (born 9 August 1961) is a New Zealand retired politician who served as the 38th prime minister of New Zealand from 2008 to 2016 and as leader of the National Party from 2006 to 2016. 

Following his father&#x27;s death when he was eight, Key was raised by his single mother in a state-house in the Christchurch suburb of Bryndwr. He attended the University of Canterbury and graduated in 1981 with a Bachelor of Commerce. He began a career in the foreign exchange market in New Zealand before moving overseas to work for Merrill Lynch, in which he became head of global foreign exchange in 1995, a position he would hold for six years. In 1999 he was appointed a member of the Foreign Exchange Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York until leaving in 2001. 

Key entered the New Zealand Parliament representing the Auckland electorate of Helensville as one of the few new National members of parliament in the election of 2002 following National&#x27;s significant defeat of that year. In 2004, he was appointed Finance Spokesman for National and eventually succeeded Don Brash as the National Party leader in 2006. After two years as leader of the Opposition, Key led his party to victory at the November 2008 general election. He was subsequently sworn in as prime minister on 19 November 2008. The National government went on to win two more general elections under his leadership: in November 2011 and September 2014. Key was expected to contest for a fourth term of office at the 2017 general election, but on 5 December 2016 he resigned as prime minister and leader of the National Party. He was succeeded by Bill English on 12 December 2016. After resigning from both posts in December 2016 and leaving politics, Key was appointed to the board of directors and role of chairman in several New Zealand corporations.

As prime minister, Key led the Fifth National Government of New Zealand which entered government at the beginning of the late-2000s recession in 2008. He was described as supporting both socially liberal and economically liberal policies. Key was worth an estimated USD$35 million in 2016, making him the wealthiest individual ever to assume the premiership. In his first term, Key&#x27;s government implemented a GST rise and personal tax cuts, while enacting several austerity measures. His government refused to renew license agreements for multiple television channels, including TVNZ 6, TVNZ 7, Kidzone and Heartland, while reducing funding for Radio New Zealand in real terms. In February 2011, after a major earthquake in Christchurch the nation&#x27;s second largest city significantly affected the national economy, the government formed the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. In its second term, Key&#x27;s government implemented a policy of partial privatisation of five state-owned enterprises, while voters in a citizens-initiated referendum on the issue were 2 to 1 opposed to the policy. He also faced a severe housing crisis, especially in Auckland, and was widely criticised for a perceived lack of action. In foreign policy, Key withdrew New Zealand Defence Force personnel from their deployment in the war in Afghanistan, signed the Wellington Declaration with the United States and pushed for more nations to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

==Early life and education==
Key was born in Auckland to George Key (1914–1969) and Ruth Key (née Lazar; 1922–2000) on 9 August 1961. His father was an English immigrant and a veteran of the Spanish Civil War and World War II, who died of a heart attack when his son was eight years old. Key and his two sisters were raised in a state house in the Christchurch suburb of Bryndwr by his mother, an Austrian-Jewish refugee who escaped the Holocaust. Key is the third prime minister or premier of New Zealand to have Jewish ancestry, after Julius Vogel and Francis Bell.

He attended Aorangi School, and then Burnside High School from 1975 to 1979, where he met his wife, Bronagh. He went on to attend the University of Canterbury and earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree in accounting in 1981. He also attended management studies courses at Harvard University, in the United States.

==Career before politics==
Key&#x27;s first job was as an auditor at McCulloch Menzies in 1982. He then became a project manager at Christchurch-based clothing manufacturer Lane Walker Rudkin for two years. He began working as a foreign exchange dealer at Elders Finance in Wellington, and rose to the position of head foreign exchange trader two years later, then moved to Auckland-based Bankers Trust in 1988.

In 1995, he joined Merrill Lynch as head of Asian foreign exchange in Singapore. That same year he was promoted to Merrill&#x27;s global head of foreign exchange, based in London, where he may have earned around US$2.25 million a year including bonuses, which is about NZ$5 million at 2001 exchange rates. Some co-workers called him &quot;the smiling assassin&quot; for maintaining his usual cheerfulness while sacking dozens (some say hundreds) of staff after heavy losses from the 1998 Russian financial crisis. He was a member of the Foreign Exchange Committee of the New York Federal Reserve Bank from 1999 to 2001.

In 1998, on learning of his interest in pursuing a political career, National Party president John Slater began working to recruit him. Former party leader Jenny Shipley describes him as one of the people she &quot;deliberately sought out and put my head on the line–either privately or publicly–to get them in there&quot;.

==Early political career==


===Early years in Parliament===
Auckland&#x27;s population growth led to the formation for the 2002 general election of a new electorate called Helensville, which covered the north-western corner of the Auckland urban area. Key beat long-serving National MP Brian Neeson (whose own Waitakere seat had moved on paper to being a Labour seat through the boundary changes) for the National Party Helensville selection. At the 2002 general election Key won the seat with a majority of 1,705, ahead of Labour&#x27;s Gary Russell, with Neeson, now standing as an independent, coming third.

The National Party was heavily defeated in the 2002 election, receiving only 20.9% of the party vote – the party&#x27;s worst-ever election result. Following the fallout, a leadership coup against the incumbent Bill English was launched by Don Brash, another of the 2002 recruits, in October 2003. English and his supporters offered Key the finance spokesman position for his vote and were confident they had the numbers with him on their side. Brash narrowly won 14 votes to 12 and at the time it was thought Key had changed his support to Brash. The votes were confidential, although later Key stated that he did vote for English.

Key won re-election at the 2005 general election, garnering 63% of votes cast. He increased his majority again in , gaining 73% of the electorate vote.

===Finance spokesman===
The low numbers in the National caucus meant Key was given more opportunities and responsibilities than most new Members of Parliament would. After serving as deputy finance spokesman under Brash, Key was promoted to the Opposition front benches in 2004 as party spokesman for finance. Key was up against Michael Cullen, the Minister of Finance and a veteran of 23 years in parliament. There was concern he would be out of his depth going up against Cullen in his first term and there was talk among the party of trying to &quot;protect&quot; Key. During the 2005 election campaign political commentators felt Key matched Cullen in the debates, although he may have benefited from Labour focusing their campaign on discrediting Brash.

Although Brash lost the election, Key remained as finance spokesman. He was promoted to number four on the list, partly due to his success at selling the party&#x27;s tax package during the campaign. While Keys ambition to become leader had been telegraphed from early in his political career, he was now beginning to rate highly on preferred prime minister polls. Rumours that Key was looking to take over the leadership circulated and there was an unofficial agreement between Brash and Key that he would be the natural successor.

Things came to a head earlier than expected. In November 2006 Brash resigned as leader, citing damaging speculation over his future as the reason. Brash&#x27;s resignation followed controversies over an extramarital affair, and over leaked internal National Party documents that were later published in the book &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;. After months of speculation, Key stood for leadership of the party and was elected unopposed.

==Leader of the Opposition==
On becoming leader Key convinced Gerry Brownlee, deputy leader under Brash, to step aside and promoted his main rival English to deputy leader and finance spokesman. He showed a ruthless streak by unceremoniously pushing Brash out and refusing to allow another one of the 2002 recruits, Brian Connell, back into the caucus. In his maiden speech as National Party leader, Key spoke of an &quot;underclass&quot; that had been &quot;allowed to develop&quot; in New Zealand, a theme which received a large amount of media coverage. Key followed up on this speech in February 2007 by committing his party to a programme which would provide food in the poorest schools in New Zealand.

In opposition he was instrumental in promoting National&#x27;s change of policy regarding keeping superannuation and Kiwibank. He also supported interest-free student loans and early childhood education funding. He relented on his stance in opposition to Sue Bradford&#x27;s Child Discipline Bill, which sought to remove &quot;reasonable force&quot; as a defence for parents charged with &quot;prima facie&quot; assault of their children. Key and Prime Minister Helen Clark agreed a compromise – giving police the discretion to overlook smacking they regarded as &quot;inconsequential&quot;.

In August 2007 Key came in for criticism when he changed his position regarding the Therapeutic Products and Medicine Bill. At the same time Labour&#x27;s Trevor Mallard hinted in Parliament that Labour would try to link Key to the 1987 &quot;H-Fee&quot; scandal, which involved Key&#x27;s former employer Elders Merchant Finance and a payment to Equiticorp Chief Executive Allan Hawkins. Hawkins and Elders executive Ken Jarrett were later jailed for fraud. Key declaring that he had left Elders months before the event, that he had no knowledge of the deal, and that his interview with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) during the investigation into the affair could only have helped to convict the people involved. Then-SFO director Charles Sturt publicly supported Key&#x27;s statement.

Labour MPs criticised Key for not releasing specific policy information at their annual conference. Key responded that National would set its own policy agenda and that there was adequate time before the next election for voters to digest National Party policy proposals.

==Prime Minister (2008–2016)==

===First term: 2008–2011===
Key became prime minister following the general election on 8 November 2008, which signalled an end to the Labour-led government of nine years under Clark. The National Party won 45% of the party vote and 58 of the 122 seats in Parliament, overtaking the incumbent majority Labour Party.

National negotiated with smaller parties to form a minority government with confidence and supply from the classical-liberal ACT Party, the centrist United Future and the indigenous-rights-based Māori Party.

Key was sworn in as Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism and also appointed as a member of the Executive Council on 19 November 2008, along with his nominated cabinet. He chose Bill English as his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. During his first term in office National remained high in the polls and one commentator described support for Key as &quot;stratospheric&quot;. In 2011 he was nicknamed &quot;Teflon John&quot; in the popular media, as nothing damaging to his reputation seemed to &quot;stick&quot; to him.

Key&#x27;s government introduced several bold economic policies in response to the global economic downturn that began shortly after he took office. The government introduced a plan of personal tax cuts, reducing taxes on all income; the top personal tax rate was lowered from 39% to 38% and then 33%. In its first budget the government raised the rate of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 12.5% to 15%, despite Key previously stating that an increase would not happen under a National government. Key&#x27;s government also enacted several austerity measures. His government declined to renew license agreements for multiple television channels, including TVNZ 6, TVNZ 7, Kidzone and Heartland, while reducing funding for Radio New Zealand in real terms.

In January 2009, after addressing Chinese New Year celebrations at the Greenlane ASB Showgrounds, Key tripped after coming down a small set of stairs in front of cameras, leaving him with a broken right arm and &quot;embarrassed&quot;. Later that year, when arriving at the Ngāpuhi Te Tii Waitangi Marae the day before Waitangi Day, Key was briefly shoved and grabbed by two protesters before diplomatic protection officers pulled them off. He told reporters he was &quot;quite shocked&quot; but continued onto the marae and spoke, while police took the two men away and charged them with assault.

Key was tied with the National Cycleway Project since its conception at the national Job Summit in early 2009. He proposed it, and as Minister for Tourism, was instrumental in getting NZ$50 million approved for initial construction work.

Key launched New Zealand&#x27;s campaign for a Security Council seat at the UN General Assembly meeting in September 2009. He met briefly with US President Barack Obama and former US President Bill Clinton. While in New York City, Key appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. He read out the Top Ten list, &#x27;Top Ten Reasons You Should Visit New Zealand&#x27;.

In foreign policy, Key supported closer relations with the United States, an ANZUS defence partner. On 4 November 2010, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully signed the Wellington Declaration. The agreement signalled an increase in the strategic partnership between the two nations and covered areas of co-operation including nuclear proliferation, climate change and terrorism. This was followed in June 2012 by a companion document, the Washington Declaration. Since 2008 Key has also engaged in Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations with the United States and other Asia-Pacific economies.

On 22 February 2011 a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck Christchurch, causing widespread damage to the city region and significantly affecting the national economy. It was New Zealand&#x27;s third deadliest natural disaster, killing 185 people. Addressing the nation, Key said that the disaster &quot;...may well be New Zealand&#x27;s darkest day&quot;. On 29 March 2011, Key created the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) to manage the earthquake recovery, co-operating with the government, local councils and residents.

On 8 March 2011, John Key advised Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand to appoint Jerry Mateparae as the next Governor-General of New Zealand. The Queen made the appointment later that day.

In October 2011, Key was caught up in a controversy over the replacement of 34 three-year-old Government BMW limousines with new ones at a time of economic restraint. Initially, Key denied any knowledge of the plan, although reports later surfaced showing that his office was aware of the deal. Political opponents accused Key and his government of hypocrisy; he later apologised, calling it a &quot;sloppy&quot; deal, effectively placing most of the blame on his chief of staff.

Shortly before the general election in November 2011, a recording was made of a conversation between Key and ACT Party candidate John Banks that they considered private – though the conversation took place in a public cafe. Key made a complaint to the police and compared the incident to illegal phone hacking in the &quot;News of the World&quot; scandal in Britain. The recording allegedly concerned the leadership of ACT and disparaging remarks about elderly New Zealand First supporters. Journalists and opposition parties demanded the release of the tapes and the affair was nicknamed &#x27;teapot tape&#x27;. A senior barrister criticised Key, stating that the comparison of the recording to the phone hacking scandal was a &quot;cheap shot&quot;.

Statements made by Key regarding New Zealand&#x27;s national credit rating proved controversial. In October 2011 he claimed that Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s (S&amp;P) had said that &quot;if there was a change of Government, that downgrade would be much more likely&quot;. S&amp;P contradicted the claim, bringing Key&#x27;s credibility into question. National won the election, but New Zealand&#x27;s credit rating was subsequently downgraded anyway – by two different agencies – Standard and Poor&#x27;s and Fitch Group.

===Second term: 2011–2014===

The general election on 26 November 2011 saw National increase its share of the vote and gain a seat, while Labour suffered further losses. Key called the election a &quot;very happy night&quot; and a &quot;strong and solid win&quot; for his party. The Prime Minister re-negotiated confidence and supply agreements with United Future, the ACT Party and the Māori Party, to secure a second term of government.

In 2012, Key was implicated in the arrest of Kim Dotcom and the subsequent revelations that the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) had illegally spied on Dotcom. As prime minister, Key was directly responsible for the GCSB, which is not allowed to spy on New Zealand citizens – and Dotcom had been granted permanent residency. Three days later, Key apologised for the illegal spying. &quot;I apologize to Mr Dotcom. I apologize to New Zealanders because every New Zealander…is entitled to be protected from the law when it comes to the GCSB, and we failed to provide that appropriate protection for him.&quot; It subsequently came to light that Deputy Prime Minister Bill English had been asked by the GCSB to sign a &quot;ministerial certificate&quot; suppressing details of the bureau&#x27;s involvement in the case while Key was overseas – the only time this had been done in the last ten years.

The fallout from Dotcom&#x27;s arrest continued in December when the High Court ordered the GCSB to &quot;confirm all entities&quot; to which it gave information, opening the door for Dotcom to sue for damages – against the spy agency and the police. Later that month, Key&#x27;s rating as preferred PM dropped to 39% – the first time in his four years as prime minister that his rating had slipped below 40%. It emerged that Key had known Ian Fletcher, head of the GCSB, since they were at school, but Key denied he had &#x27;shoulder-tapped&#x27; Fletcher for the role. Later Key&#x27;s office released a statement saying he rang Fletcher and recommended he apply for the position at GCSB. Key said he hadn&#x27;t originally mentioned the phone call because he &quot;forgot&quot;. Political commentator Bryce Edwards called it the &quot;most appalling political management since he became Prime Minister back in 2008&quot;.

Key continued New Zealand&#x27;s push for a spot on the UN Security Council while in New York in 2013. There he accused rival candidates Spain and Turkey of using aid money to buy votes from small African countries, and said New Zealand would not be spending its way onto the Council. While in New York, Key suddenly fell ill, but recovered in time for meetings with representatives from other countries ahead of the General Assembly.

In April 2013, whilst visiting Chinese president Xi Jinping in Beijing, Key made headlines by suggesting New Zealand would back any United States or Australian military action against North Korea. The following day he backtracked, saying the chance of New Zealand troops entering North Korea was &quot;so far off the planet&quot;.

===Third term: 2014–2016===

The general election on 20 September 2014 saw the National Government returned again. National won a plurality with 47.0% of the party vote and 60 of the 121 seats. On election night counts the party appeared to hold the first majority since 1994 with 61 seats, but lost a list seat (for Maureen Pugh) to the Green Party on the official count (including special votes) of the party vote. National re-entered a confidence and supply arrangement with United Future, the ACT Party and the Māori Party.

In October, Key created a new ministerial portfolio called the Minister of National Security and Intelligence to serve the newly established Cabinet National Security Committee. The Prime Minister assumed the new portfolio while the Attorney General Christopher Finlayson became Minister Responsible for the GCSB and Minister in Charge of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS), portfolios which have traditionally been held by a prime minister. Key was elected Chairman of the International Democrat Union (IDU), an international alliance of centre-right political parties. The National Party was a founding member party in 1983.

In April 2015, Key acknowledged that he had pulled a waitress&#x27; ponytail multiple times over several months; when Key learnt she had taken offence, he apologised. International media reported the incident as &quot;ponytail-gate&quot;.

Key had long supported changing the flag of New Zealand, and during the 2014 general election campaign promised a referendum on the issue. Following the election win, two New Zealand flag referendums were held in November/December 2015 and March 2016. The second resulted in the retention of the current flag. Critics (both national and international) charged that the referendums were unnecessary, expensive and a &quot;wasteful vanity project&quot;.

The New Zealand housing crisis took hold substantially following Key&#x27;s third term. From the time Key took office until the year he left, average housing prices had more than doubled. Key repeatedly refused to call the property bubble a crisis, claiming it instead was a &quot;challenge&quot;. The prime minister was challenged over his criticism of Helen Clark&#x27;s government&#x27;s response to the housing crisis during the 2008 campaign, but reluctance to take a stand now it had worsened considerably. A &quot;Newshub&quot; poll released in May 2016 showed that 76% of New Zealanders felt the government was not doing enough to control the housing market, while only 20% thought it had housing under control.
International trade and the negotiation of free-trade agreements were a priority in Key&#x27;s third term. He was a leading advocate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), also supporting the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (TPSEP). Both agreements provide for a multilateral free-trade area in the Asia–Pacific region. In a September 2016 speech to the Council of Foreign Relations, Key said &quot;[TPP] will boost our economy by at least $2.7 billion a year by 2030. It will help diversify our economy and create more jobs and higher incomes for New Zealanders&quot;. Key was particularly intent on securing the participation of the United States in the agreement; to this end, he discussed TPP with President Barack Obama in April 2016, and hosted Secretary of State John Kerry in Wellington, 9–13 November 2016. The finalised TPP proposal was signed on 4 February 2016 in Auckland, concluding seven years of negotiations. In January 2017, US President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum to withdrawing the United States&#x27; signature from the agreement, making its ratification virtually impossible.

In February 2016, Key reached an agreement with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to grant New Zealanders living in Australia a pathway to citizenship if they were earning five times over the average wage. As a result of this agreement, the Australian Government introduced the &quot;Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189)&quot; in July 2017 to fast-track the Australian citizenship naturalisation process for New Zealanders living in Australia. New Zealanders living in Australia for at least five years and earning an annual income over A$53,900 were eligible for the visa. By late February 2018, 1,512 Subclass 189 visas had been issued. However, this visa scheme was criticised by the &quot;Ozkiwi lobby&quot; since two-thirds of New Zealanders living in Australia did not meet the qualifying wage.

In March 2016, Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, approved the appointment of Dame Patsy Reddy as the next Governor-General of New Zealand, for a five-year term starting in September 2016, on the advice of John Key.

Key resigned as prime minister and leader of the National Party effective from 12 December 2016, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He expressed interest in spending more time with his family, stating that he had &quot;never seen [himself] as a career politician&quot; and that &quot;this feels the right time to go&quot;. Media reports described the decision as unexpected, and noted the popularity of Key and his party. Bill English won the 2016 New Zealand National Party leadership election to succeed Key.

==Post-prime ministerial career==
Following his resignation, Key stated that he would leave Parliament before the 2017 general election. However, he stated that he would resign within six months of the election so as to not trigger a by-election in the electorate. He gave his valedictory speech in Parliament on 22 March 2017 and formally resigned the following month, on 14 April.

In May 2017, Key was appointed to the board of directors of Air New Zealand, and took up the position on 1 September 2017. He was also appointed chairman of ANZ Bank New Zealand, taking up the position on 18 October 2017. On 31 March 2020, Key stood down as a director of Air New Zealand. He joined the board of American cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks in 2019.

==Political and social views==

Key&#x27;s views were largely aligned with his own party&#x27;s view. However, he noted that his differences from his predecessor are more of style and focus rather than view. 

===Alcohol regulation===
In 2008 Key voted for an attempt to raise the legal drinking age from 18 back to 20, but ignored a Law Commission recommendation to increase levies on alcohol. He claimed there was &quot;no appetite&quot; for such a move. A report on public attitudes to alcohol law reform was later discovered, which indicated that in 2010, when he made this claim, 56% of New Zealanders supported a price increase.

===Climate change===
Key says that global warming is a real phenomenon, and that the Government needed to implement measures to reduce human contribution to global warming. Key committed the National Party to working towards reducing greenhouse emissions in New Zealand by 50% within the next fifty years. Commentators note that as late as 2005, Key made statements indicating that he was sceptical of the effects and impact of climate change.

===COVID-19===
In September 2021, Key criticised the Labour Government&#x27;s elimination-based lockdown policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, likening it to making New Zealand a hermit kingdom like North Korea. He also accused the Government of ruling by fear and lacking a post-lockdown strategy. To speed up COVID-19 vaccination, he recommended boosting funding for Māori and Pasifika health providers, introducing financial incentives for young people, and allowing only vaccinated people into licensed premises. TVNZ journalist Jack Tame described Key&#x27;s views on the Government&#x27;s handling of COVID-19 as provocative but praised his five-point plan as a &quot;collection of sensible ideas worthy of consideration.&quot;

===Euthanasia===
During the 2020 New Zealand euthanasia referendum, Key publicly expressed support for the End of Life Choice Act 2019, saying that his mother&#x27;s struggle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease prior to her death convinced him to support the decriminalisation of euthanasia.

===Foreign policy issues===

As a first-term MP in 2003, Key criticised the Labour-led government&#x27;s stance on the Invasion of Iraq, claiming that New Zealand was &quot;missing in action&quot; by failing to support its ANZUS allies, the United States and Australia. In August 2007 Key claimed that he would have taken a similar position to Clark and not sent troops to Iraq. In response, the Labour-led government argued that his comments from 2003 suggest that Key would have deployed troops had he been prime minister at the time.

In August 2022, Key described Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s visit to Taiwan as &quot;reckless&quot; and provocative towards China during an interview with TVNZ journalist Jack Tame. Since Beijing regarded the visit as a violation of the One China Policy, China had downgraded bilateral relations with the United States. During his premiership, Key had cultivated a close relationship with President of China Xi Jinping, describing Xi as &quot;extremely trustworthy, very open, consistent.&quot;

In early October 2024, Key opined that Donald Trump was better for the economy while expressing disagreement with his &quot;isolationist&quot; America First foreign policy during the leadup up to the 2024 United States presidential election. During an interview with Stuff, Key said: he&#x27;s [Trump] likely to embrace a bit more market. He&#x27;s likely to have less red tape and he&#x27;s certainly going to have lower taxes. So that bit is good.&quot; Key also described the Democratic Party candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris&#x27; economic policies as &quot;radically left-wing&quot; and more aligned with Senator Bernie Sanders than President Joe Biden.

===Māori issues===
In early August 2024, Key spoke at the National Party&#x27;s national conference and urged the National-led government to thread carefully on Māori issues including the Treaty Principles Bill (which had been introduced by coalition partner ACT), the planned repeal of section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989 and National&#x27;s decision to overrule a court ruling on the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011. He said: 

===Marriage===
Key had a mixed voting record on social issues. In 2004 he voted against the bill creating civil unions, stating that, while he personally supports such unions, he acted in accordance with his electorate&#x27;s views. However, in 2005, Key was part of a large bloc of MPs voting to defeat a bill that defined marriage as being between a man and a woman. 

Key stated in 2008 that he did not oppose same-sex couples adopting children. In 2013 he expressed support for same-sex marriage and voted for the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013.

===Monarchy vs Republic===
Like his predecessor Helen Clark, Key views a New Zealand republic as &quot;inevitable&quot;, although probably not for another decade. He said: Key later stated that he was a monarchist, and that a New Zealand republic would &quot;Not [happen] under my watch&quot;. In 2009 Key&#x27;s government restored titular honours, including knighthoods and damehoods — the abolishment of these titles in 2000 had been seen as an advancement towards republicanism.

===Privatisation===
Key noted others&#x27; concern at the pace of asset sales, but stated that the arguments against selling assets in the 1980s were largely irrational. In a 2002 interview, he said that &quot;some form of orientation towards privatisation&quot; in health, education and superannuation, such as giving firms tax breaks for employer super schemes, made sense. After his party won a plurality in the 2011 election, Key rejected claims that the National Government lacked a mandate to partially privatise state-owned assets.

==Personal life==
===Personal wealth===
On 25 July 2008, Key was added to the New Zealand &quot;National Business Review&quot; (NBR) Rich List for the first time. The list details the wealthiest New Zealand individuals and family groups. He had an estimated wealth of NZ$50 million, which made him the wealthiest New Zealand Member of Parliament, and the wealthiest prime minister ever. In the 2016 NBR Rich List, Key had an estimated wealth of NZ$60 million. Most of his financial investments are held in a blind trust.

===Family===
Key married Bronagh Irene Dougan in 1984; they met when they were both students at Burnside High School. She has a BCom degree, and worked as a personnel consultant before becoming a full-time mother. They have two children, Stephie and Max. Max is a night-time radio host for George FM, and is also a singer. Stephie is a performance artist.

===Religious views===
In 2008, Key stated that he attended church frequently with his children, but was an agnostic. He has said that he does not believe in an afterlife, and sees religion as &quot;doing the right thing&quot;.

=== Private pilot licence ===
In October 2024, Key revealed that he began studying for helicopter license during the COVID-19 lockdowns in New Zealand and has since logged 280 hours of flight time. Key owns a Guimbal Cabri G2, which he has customised with the proposed alternative New Zealand flag design, three white rabbit emblems for good luck, and his personal callsign, ZK-IJK. Key stated in the news that he mostly flies his helicopter to golf courses.

==Honours==

On 3 August 2010, Key gained the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. Previously, as he was not a privy councillor, he had not been entitled to use the style—his predecessor ended the appointment of New Zealanders to the Privy Council. However, in 2010 the Queen approved the use of the style by prime ministers, governors-general, speakers of the House, and chief justices.

Key was appointed a Knight Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, in recognition of &quot;services to the State&quot;, in the 2017 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. Later Key was appointed an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia, for &quot;eminent service to Australia-New Zealand relations&quot;, by the Governor-General of Australia on the personal recommendation of the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull.

On 7 August 2017, Key was awarded an honorary doctorate by his alma mater, the University of Canterbury, to become a doctor of commerce.

<text>Ira James Murchison (February 6, 1933 – March 28, 1994) was an American athlete, winner of the gold medal in 4 × 100 m relay at the 1956 Summer Olympics.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, he attended Phillips High School. Murchison was noted for his exceptional speed from the starting block, which earned him a nickname &quot;Human Sputnik&quot;.

Before the Melbourne Olympics, Murchison equalled twice the 100 m world record of 10.2 and ran in Berlin a new world record of 10.1, thus becoming one of the favourites to win the 100 m Olympic gold medal. But at Melbourne, Murchison managed to finish only in a disappointing fourth place. He also ran the leadoff leg of the 4 × 100 m relay team for the United States, and helped the American team to a gold medal in a world record time of 39.5.

He attended the University of Iowa, but later transferred to Western Michigan. In 1957, Murchison repeated the world record of 9.3 and, as a Western Michigan University student, won the 1958 NCAA championships in . At the 1963 Pan American Games, Murchison finished third in the 100 m and helped the American 4 × 100 m relay team to win a gold medal.

During the 1970s, Murchison was the coach of a women&#x27;s track team in Chicago. One of the women he coached was 1976 Olympic sprinter, Rosalyn Bryant.

Ira Murchison died of cancer in Harvey, Illinois, aged 61.

<text>Wayne Daniel Mapp (born 12 March 1952) is a former New Zealand National Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament for North Shore from 1996 to 2011. In the first term of the Fifth National Government, he served as Minister of Defence. Prior to his political career Mapp was in the New Zealand Territorial Army and worked as a lawyer and university lecturer.

==Early years==
He gained his LLB (Hon) at University of Auckland. This was followed by his LLM from University of Toronto and his PhD in International Law from Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1988.

He served as an infantry Major in 3rd Auckland (Countess of Ranfurly&#x27;s Own) and Northland Regiment Royal New Zealand Territorial Army, later specialising in military intelligence.

Mapp was initially a member of the Labour Party and in 1981 he put himself forward for the Labour candidacy for the Roskill electorate. One of 14 contenders he lost out to Phil Goff.

Before entering politics, Mapp practised law and was an associate professor in commercial law at the University of Auckland.

==Member of Parliament==



Mapp was elected MP for the North Shore seat at the 1996 general election. He was re-elected in that electorate four more times until he retired from Parliament at the 2011 general election.

=== Early political career ===
In Mapp&#x27;s first term, the National Party formed a coalition government with New Zealand First and Mapp was appointed to the Justice and Foreign Affairs select committees. After the 1999 election, National spent nine years in Opposition. Mapp held various party spokesperson roles including Defence, Justice, Foreign Affairs, Industrial Relations and &quot;political correctness eradication.&quot;

In a September 2003 house sitting, Mapp criticised the incumbent government&#x27;s lack of support for the US-led invasion of Iraq. His comment pertained to New Zealand being &quot;missing in action&quot; in Iraq, John Key echoed support for his statements and this was used in Labour&#x27;s election advertising in the 2008 New Zealand general election.

=== Fifth National Government ===
Following National&#x27;s victory in the 2008 general election, Mapp was appointed Minister of Defence, Minister of Research, Science and Technology (later titled Minister of Science and Innovation), Associate Minister for Economic Development and Associate Minister for Tertiary Education.

While Minister of Defence, Mapp oversaw Operation Burnham, a joint military operation undertaken in Afghanistan by the New Zealand Special Air Service with elements of the Afghan Crisis Response Unit and International Security Assistance Force in October 2010. The 2017 book by Nicky Hager and Jon Stephenson, &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot;, alleged that New Zealand forces had committed war crimes against civilians in the Naik and Khak Khudday Dad villages. Mapp announced that he had been a source for the book. In 2020, a Government Inquiry found that a child had been killed in Operation Burnham but that the military operation was justified under international law.

On 15 December 2010, Mapp announced he would retire from Parliament at the 2011 general election.

==Post-Parliament==

On 15 December 2011, in recognition of his term as a Member of the Executive Council of New Zealand, Mapp was granted the right to retain the title The Honourable for the rest of his life.

On 28 February 2012, Mapp was appointed to the New Zealand Law Commission.

In the 2013 New Year Honours, Mapp was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for services as a member of Parliament.

<text>The Western Bloc, also known as the Capitalist Bloc, was an unofficial coalition of countries that were officially allied with the United States during the Cold War of 1947–1991. While the NATO member states, in Western Europe and Northern America, were pivotal to the bloc, it included many other countries, in the broader Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa with histories of anti-Soviet, anti-communist and, in some cases anti-socialist, ideologies and policies. As such, the bloc was opposed to the political systems and foreign policies of communist countries, which were centered on the Soviet Union, other members of the Warsaw Pact, and usually the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The name &quot;Western Bloc&quot; emerged in response to and as the antithesis of its communist counterpart, the Eastern Bloc. Throughout the Cold War, the governments and the Western media were more inclined to refer to themselves as the &quot;Free World&quot; or the &quot;First World&quot;, whereas the Eastern bloc was often referred to as the &quot;Communist World&quot; or less commonly the &quot;Second World&quot;.

<doc id="1075901" wikidata="Q58291" url="?curid=1075901" title="Murray McCully">
<text>Murray Stuart McCully (born 19 February 1953) is a former New Zealand politician. He is a member of the National Party, and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2008 to 2017.

==Early life==
Born in Whangārei, McCully was educated at Arapohue Primary School, Dargaville High School, the University of Auckland, and Victoria University of Wellington. He has a Bachelor of Laws degree and is a qualified barrister and solicitor, working as a lawyer before entering politics. He had a long-term relationship with political journalist and columnist Jane Clifton, with whom he had two sons, which ended in the 2010s.

==Member of Parliament==




McCully first stood for Parliament in 1975 in Auckland Central, reducing Richard Prebble&#x27;s majority to 289. He next stood for East Coast Bays in 1984, coming second to Gary Knapp.

In 1987, McCully defeated Knapp and entered Parliament as MP for East Coast Bays on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore. He held that seat at three general elections.

At the 1996 election he became MP for the new seat of Albany before returning, in the 2002 election, as MP for the reconstituted East Coast Bays seat. McCully retired from parliamentary politics in 2017.

Over his career, McCully held senior ministerial appointments in both the Fourth and Fifth National Governments. He had a reputation as a party strategist, &quot;fix-it man&quot; and &quot;Machiavellian Dark Prince.&quot;

=== Fourth National Government, 1990–1999 ===
McCully&#x27;s first ministerial appointment was as Minister of Customs and Associate Minister of Tourism in 1991. He held later appointments under the premierships of Jim Bolger and Jenny Shipley as Minister of Housing, Minister of Immigration and Minister for Sport, Fitness and Leisure.

As Sport and Tourism Minister, McCully reportedly &quot;headhunted&quot; future Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to head up the new Office of Sport and Tourism.

Murray McCully resigned from his Tourism portfolio in April 1999 after questions were raised regarding his handling of the resignation and subsequent payout of members of the Tourism board. These questions culminated in a report of the Controller and Auditor General that deemed these payouts &quot;unlawful,&quot; although the report accepted that all involved had proceeded on the basis of advice and &quot;their genuine perception of what was in the best interests of New Zealand’s tourism industry.&quot;

=== Opposition, 1999–2008 ===
The National Party lost government at the 1999 general election and did not regain the treasury benches until 2008. During nine years of opposition, McCully held various opposition spokesperson roles including in the local government, housing, sport, state services, immigration, foreign affairs and defence portfolios.

McCully is understood to have been a key player in many of the leadership changes the National Party experienced while in opposition. McCully supported Bill English to replace Jenny Shipley as National Party leader in the 2001 New Zealand National Party leadership election, Don Brash to replace English in 2003, and Gerry Brownlee to replace Nick Smith as deputy leader in 2003. McCully was appointed &quot;parliamentary assistant&quot; to Brash and was reportedly the only MP Brash told about his decision to stand down in 2006.

=== Fifth National Government, 2008–2017 ===
After the National Party won the 2008 election, McCully was sworn in as a Cabinet Minister on 19 November 2008. McCully was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister for Sport and Recreation, and Minister for the Rugby World Cup by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key.

In November 2015, McCully was off work after surgery for removal of a growth that was found to be benign.

On 15 December 2016, following the announcement that Key would retire from politics and the appointment of Bill English as Prime Minister, McCully announced that he would not stand for parliament in 2017 (in that year&#x27;s general election). English and McCully had previously had a fractious relationship, relating to when McCully orchestrated the removal of English as party leader in 2003. Reflecting on his time as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, McCully said his most challenging and rewarding work was New Zealand&#x27;s role in the Pacific: &quot;I’ve put a lot of my personal effort into ensuring that we actually live up to the expectations our neighbours have of us and the responsibilities we should carry.&quot; He continued as Minister of Foreign Affairs under English until 2 May 2017, when he was succeeded by Gerry Brownlee.

In December 2016, McCully played a critical role in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334.

=== Political views ===
In 2004, McCully voted against a bill to establish civil unions. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill 2005, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman.

In 2013, McCully voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry in New Zealand.

== Awards and honours ==
While still a Member of Parliament, McCully was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to foreign policy in the 2015 New Year Honours.

In 2019, McCully was appointed an Honorary Companion of the Order of Fiji, for services to relations between Fiji and New Zealand.

<text>Walter Thane Baker (born October 4, 1931) is an American former sprinter and winner of the gold medal in the 4x100 m relay at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, with a new world record of 39.5 seconds. At those Olympics Baker also won a silver medal in the 100-meter and a bronze in the 200-meter. At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, he won a silver medal in the 200-meter.

==Biography==
Baker was born in Elkhart, Kansas. In 1953, as a Kansas State University student, Baker won the NCAA championship in the , and in 1956 he won the AAU championships in 200 m. Baker also won numerous conference titles at Kansas State, and was a four-time All American.

Before the Melbourne Olympics, Baker equaled Jesse Owens&#x27;s long-standing 100 m world record time of 10.2 seconds, and also twice equaled the 200 m world record of 20.6. He tied the world record in the 100 yd in 9.3 seconds, twice tied the world record in 60 yd indoor events at 6.1 seconds, and set the world record in the 300 yd at 29.4 seconds. He co-held several world records in relays.

After turning forty, Baker participated in the Masters Track and Field program and held numerous world records in the 100 yd, 100 m, 220 y, 200 m, and several relays in the age groups categories of 40–44, 45–49, and 50–54 years of age. Baker is enshrined in the USATF Masters Hall of Fame and the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame. He is also in the Kansas State University Sports Hall of Fame and the Kansas State High School Activities Hall of Fame. In 1978, he was named a &quot;Silver Athletics Top Ten&quot; for personal achievement.

He began as a track meet &quot;starter&quot; in 1959 and has started NCAA National Championships and National Federation Championships. The year 2010 was his forty-fourth year of serving at the Texas Relays. He was selected &quot;Outstanding Official&quot; by the Texas Relays Committee in 2010 and inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame, Class of 2011. He also has the track named after him in his home town of Elkhart, Kansas.

He retired in 1983 as a colonel from the United States Air Force after serving thirty years of active and reserve status. Additionally, in 1992, he retired from Mobil Research and Development after thirty-nine years of employment. His civic involvement included serving as president of a Rotary Club chapter, a member of the Cotton Bowl Athletic Association board of directors, the United States Olympians board of directors, and volunteered on other boards and associations.

Thane Baker&#x27;s daughter, Catherine Baker Nicholson JD, wrote a book about his first Olympics called Running in Borrowed Shoes: Thane Baker and the 1956 Summer Games, which Texas Christian University Press published in Summer 2024. Because he did not expect to make the 1952 Olympic team, Baker competed in the Men&#x27;s 200 meters and won a silver medal wearing borrowed socks and borrowed shoes.

BYUtv produced a video about Thane Baker&#x27;s experiences in 2024.

Baker is the oldest living United States Olympic medalist in track, and ranks third in the world in the same category.

<doc id="1075910" wikidata="Q441839" url="?curid=1075910" title="Nana Plaza">
<text>Nana Plaza (formerly Nana Entertainment Plaza) is an entertainment complex and red-light district in Bangkok, Thailand. Originally built as a shopping center, Nana Plaza occupies a three-story commercial building in the Khlong Toei District of Bangkok about from the BTS Skytrain&#x27;s Nana Station. It describes itself as the &quot;worlds largest adult playground&quot;. Its name originates from the influential, property-holding Nana family, Lek Nana being the most prominent member.

Along with Soi Cowboy and Patpong, Nana Plaza is one of Bangkok&#x27;s three most concentrated red-light districts. All attract primarily tourists.

==History==
The plaza&#x27;s U-shaped building is roughly square-shaped, with a single opening on the west side, and consists of a ground floor and two additional floors arranged around a courtyard. It started as a restaurant and shopping center in the late-1970s. During the early-1980s, a few go-go bars appeared and gradually replaced the shops and restaurants. By the mid-1980s around twenty go-go bars had opened in the three-level court, taking advantage of the expansion of tourist hotels in the area.

In 2012 Nana Plaza was sold to a Thai JVC company Nana Partners Co Ltd., co-owned by Fico corporation and Panthera Group (formally known as Eclipse group)one of Thailand&#x27;s largest bar and nightclub operatorsfor a rumored US$25,000,000 after the land was inherited by seven sisters who wanted nothing to do with a red-light area. Panthera Group renovated the complex, becoming the landlord and providing the management and security services.

==Facilities==
Three short-time hotels, one of which has been renovated, operate on the top floor. Short-time hotels rent out rooms by the hour or more to patrons to take a bargirl for sex. Most bar girls in Nana Plaza will leave with customers upon payment of a bar fine. Smoking is banned indoors. There are two elevators, one on the north side of the building and one on the south. The building closes at 03:00 and lies dormant until the following evening. In 2016 two waitresses in the plaza&#x27;s &quot;Bangkok Bunnies&quot; go-go bar said that they received monthly wages equivalent to £130 (US$165) and daily tips equivalent to £11–16 (US$14–20). This compares with a 2016 average monthly wage in Thailand of around 13,800 baht (US$388).

As of July 2019, Nana Plaza housed 30 bars and three &quot;hotels&quot;.

As of July 2019, there were seven kathoey (&quot;ladyboy&quot;) bars in Nana Plaza; Several other bars have a few ladyboys in their line-ups mixed with their regular go-go dancers.

<doc id="1075911" wikidata="Q16182" url="?curid=1075911" title="Maurice Williamson">
<text>Maurice Donald Williamson (born 6 March 1951) is a New Zealand politician and former diplomat.

Williamson had a 30-year career as the National Party Member of Parliament for Pakuranga in the New Zealand House of Representatives. During this period, he was a minister in both the Fourth and Fifth National Governments, including as Minister of Transport, Minister of Broadcasting, Minister of Local Government, Minister of Customs and Minister of Statistics. 

After retiring from Parliament, Williamson was New Zealand consul-general in Los Angeles from 2017 to 2021. He returned to politics in 2022, successfully contesting the Howick ward of Auckland Council. 

==Member of Parliament==




Williamson was a member of Parliament for the National Party, a centre-right political Party in New Zealand, as MP for Pakuranga since the 1987 general election. He held a number of ministerial posts, including Minister of Communications, Minister of Broadcasting, Minister of Transport, and Minister of Research, Science and Technology, and associate Minister of Health (1990–96). He was a strong supporter of reform of prostitution law.

His 2005 election campaign saw one of the strongest results for National across New Zealand.

=== Suspensions ===
He was suspended from caucus on 22 July 2003, after refusing to curtail his criticism of the National Party leader, Bill English, who he blamed for poor performance in the polls. After English was replaced by Don Brash, Williamson was reinstated. After his return from suspension, Williamson played an active role in National and was elevated up the ranks to eighth position in the National lineup in 2008.

On 1 May 2014, he resigned his ministerial portfolios after making what the Prime Minister, John Key, called, &quot;A serious error of judgement.&quot; The Prime Minister was referring to a phone call Mr Williamson had made to the police enquiring about a charge they were laying against businessman and National Party donor Donghua Liu over domestic violence allegations. Williamson had told police he was not trying to interfere with the process – he just wanted to make sure somebody had reviewed the matter to ensure the police were on solid ground as &quot;Mr Liu is investing a lot of money in New Zealand&quot;.

=== Candid remarks ===
Williamson became known for his candid remarks and humor which often attracted controversy. In 2011, he attracted controversy for making crude jokes during a speech addressing a conference audience. Speaking to a Samoan speaker, he joked about whether his &quot;papers were in order&quot;. Later he said: &quot;What is the difference between Muslims and Kiwis? Muslims get to commit adultery and get stoned, Kiwis get stoned and commit adultery&quot;. In 2015, Prime Minister John Key defended him as a &quot;flamboyant&quot; person with a &quot;strong sense of humour&quot; after Williamson was accused of making &quot;sexist&quot; remarks during another speech. He later apologised. Earlier in 2007, Williamson was slammed for an email he sent in response to a TV report on obesity: &quot;If some people can&#x27;t lose weight no matter what ... how come there were no fat people in the Nazi concentration camps?&quot;

=== 49th and 50th New Zealand Parliaments ===
After the 2008 general election the National Party formed a minority government with three confidence and supply partners. Despite his high list placing, Williamson was not selected for cabinet due in part to a series of gaffes during the election campaign relating to the party&#x27;s policy on road tolls. He was given ministerial responsibilities outside of cabinet for Customs, Building and Construction, Statistics and Small Business. One of the major matters under his governance was the ongoing leaky homes crisis, which he noted as having the government &quot;stumped&quot; due to its enormity.

In June 2009, Richard Worth left Parliament after Prime Minister John Key lost confidence in him as a minister over sexual allegations. Williamson was made the acting minister of Worth&#x27;s portfolios of Internal Affairs, National Library and Archives New Zealand which were subsequently passed on to Nathan Guy.

After the election of the 50th Parliament of New Zealand Williamson was returned to his seat and re-appointed as a minister in the second term of the National-led government. Williamson retained his 2008 portfolios of Customs, Land Information and Building and Construction but lost the role of Minister for Small Business to John Banks as part of the new National-ACT Confidence and Supply deal. Williamson remained a minister outside of Cabinet, along with Jo Goodhew, Chester Borrows and Chris Tremain, until his resignation from all ministerial portfolios on 1 May 2014.

He announced that he would not stand for Parliament in the 2017 election.

=== Transport advocacy ===
In 2003, Williamson suggested that &quot;cities have squandered fortunes upgrading their public transport only to find the car remains the mode of choice for most&quot; and said local government subsidies should be axed for roading maintenance and public transport.

As a one-time Transport Minister and a local MP, Williamson has long supported and advocated for more motorway and roading projects. In 2005, he advocated for the Eastern Transport Corridor motorway to expand Auckland&#x27;s motorway network, saying that the city was &quot;grossly short&quot; of motorways. As the National Party&#x27;s transport spokesperson in the 2008 general election, he prompted controversy for supporting significant road tolls to enable new motorway construction projects. 

In 2015, he advocated for two local roads in his Pakuranga electorate to be redesignated as state highways, as he felt Auckland Transport was prioritising public transport infrastructure too heavily in planning.

=== &#x27;Big gay rainbow&#x27; speech ===
In April 2013, Williamson voted in favour of the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill which legalised same-sex marriage, delivering a memorable speech prior to the third reading vote.

The speech was soon being referenced worldwide by news outlets and was chosen as 2013&#x27;s quote of the year by Massey University. With Williamson&#x27;s sarcastic and honest approach, the speech was viewed hundreds of thousands of times over the next few days, and featured on high-profile news sites like The Huffington Post and Gawker. Williamson said he had an offer to go on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, but had to turn it down due to rules around ministers accepting gifts. Williamson was later given approval by the prime minister to go on the show as long as he donated any money received to charity. Williamson&#x27;s speech was praised by Opposition politicians and left-wing media commentators.

==Later career and return to politics==

After he announced his intention to leave parliament at the 2017 election, Williamson was appointed the New Zealand consul-general in Los Angeles in 2016. He took up the post the following year.

Williamson returned to the New Zealand political scene in 2022 by running for Auckland Council as one of the two councillors for the Howick Ward, which encompasses all of Williamson&#x27;s former Pakuranga parliamentary electorate. Williamson ran on a ticket with sitting councillor Sharon Stewart, and in October 2022 Williamson and Stewart were both elected, defeating sitting Howick councillor Paul Young.

Auckland mayor Wayne Brown appointed Williamson to the chair of the expenditure control and procurement committee, charged with identifying cost savings. As a councillor, Williamson attracted criticism for his comments characterising posters promoting the use of te reo Māori as &quot;objectionable&quot; and for making comments &quot;of a sexual nature&quot; in relation to Wellington mayor Tory Whanau.

<doc id="1075914" wikidata="Q2280882" url="?curid=1075914" title="Alexandria Eschate">
<text>Alexandria Eschate (, , &quot;Furthest Alexandria&quot;) was a city founded by Alexander the Great, at the south-western end of the Fergana Valley (modern Tajikistan) in August 329 BC. It was the most northerly outpost of Alexander&#x27;s Empire in Central Asia. Alexandria Eschate was established on the south bank of the river Jaxartes (Syr Darya), at or close to the site of modern Khujand (Хуҷанд; خجند), in present-day Tajikistan. According to the Roman writer Curtius, &quot;Alexandria Ultima&quot; retained its Greek culture as late as 30 BC.

==History==
This region where Alexandria Eschate would be founded was ruled over by Persia starting with Xerxes I, and began to be populated by Greeks starting at that time. When Greeks in other parts of the Persian empire rebelled or otherwise were troublesome, they would be exiled to the far northeast of the Persian empire, the most distant segment from their homelands. This was not uncommon, because the coastline of Asia Minor was populated by many Greek cities. By the time of the fall of Persia to Alexander the Great, many had been exiled to this region north of India, so Greek villages, language, and culture were therefore all common in that area. Cyrus the Great founded a city there as his northeastern-most outpost, known as Cyropolis, which may have later become the site of Alexandria Eschate, simply renamed.

===Alexander the Great===
Alexander, during his years of conquest, would regularly establish long-term outposts to support his advance, either renaming and permanently securing an existing city, or creating a long-term, albeit non-permanent, outpost built up like a town. According to Greek essayist Plutarch, Alexander named seventy of these bases after himself, though this may be an exaggeration; only a couple dozen are known today.
In order to secure Sogdiana, the northeastern corner of the Persian empire, Alexander targeted Cyropolis and a half dozen other cities in 329 BC.

Alexander first sent Craterus to Cyropolis, the largest of the towns holding Sogdiana against Alexander&#x27;s forces. Craterus&#x27; instructions were to &quot;take up a position close to the town, surround it with a ditch and stockade, and then assemble such siege engines as might suit his purpose...&quot; The idea was to keep the inhabitants focused on their own defenses and to prevent them from sending assistance out to the other towns. Starting from Gazza, Alexander went on to conquer the other surrounding towns. Five of the seven towns were taken in two days. Many of the inhabitants were killed. Alexander then arrived at Cyropolis, which was the best fortified of the towns and had the largest population. It also had reputedly the best fighters of the region. Alexander battered Cyropolis&#x27; defenses with the siege engines. While the bombardment went on, Alexander ordered certain of his troops to sneak through a dried-up water course that went under the town&#x27;s wall. Alexander also joined on this mission and once inside his troops opened the town&#x27;s gate to admit his attacking force. Once the natives saw that the town was taken, they fell violently upon the attackers. Alexander received a violent blow from a stone that landed upon his head and neck. Craterus was wounded by an arrow. But the defenders were driven off. Arrian puts the defender&#x27;s force at about 15,000 fighting men and claims that 8,000 of them were killed in the first phase of the operation. The rest apparently sought refuge inside the town&#x27;s central fortress, but surrendered after one day for lack of water.

Accounts of how the battle went down differ among authors. Arrian cites Ptolemy as saying Cyropolis surrendered from the start, and Arrian also states that according to Aristobulus the place was stormed and everyone was massacred.

One, probably Cyropolis, came to be called Alexandria Eschate, his northeastern-most outpost. As with most other cities founded by Alexander, a group of retired and/or wounded veterans from his army was settled there, joining the large population of Greek exiles settled in the area by Persia in previous generations.

===Hellenistic period===
Because Alexandria Eschate was surrounded by Sogdian tribes, and was about north of the nearest Greek settlement, at Alexandria on the Oxus in Bactria, the Greeks built a wall around the city which, according to the ancient authors, was completed in about 20 days. It experienced numerous conflicts with the local population.

From 250 BC, the city likely had greater contact with Bactria, after the Greco-Bactrian king Euthydemus I extended his control into Sogdiana.

Alexandria Eschate was also located around west of the Tarim Basin (now Xinjiang, China), where other Indo-European peoples, like the Khotanese, Tocharians, Wusun and/or Yuezhi were established. There are indications that Greek expeditions travelled as far as Kashgar. The historian Strabo claims that the Greeks &quot;extended their empire even as far as the Seres and the Phryni .

&quot;Seres&quot; meant either China proper – in which case the Greeks achieved the first direct contact between China and a European society, some time around 200 BC – or the peoples of the Tarim. In any case, a city known to the Chinese as Dayuan, which was mentioned by scholars from the Han dynasty (1st century BC to 2nd century AD), is speculated to refer to Alexandria Eschate. The prefix &quot;da&quot; meant &quot;Great&quot;, while the suffix &quot;Yuan&quot; was the Chinese rendition of Ionians.

Chinese embassies were established in Dayuan, beginning with Zhang Qian opened around 130 BC. Soon the city and the rest of Dayuan were conquered completely by the Han after winning the War of the Heavenly Horses. This contributed to the opening up the Silk Road from the 1st century BC. &quot;Dayuan&quot; means &quot;Great Ionians&quot; in the Chinese language, Greeks generally being known in Asia by some variant of &quot;Ionians&quot;. &quot;See&quot; Names of the Greeks: Ionians, Yunani, and Yavan &quot;for more information.&quot;

==Archaeological remains==
The remains of Alexander&#x27;s town lie in the tell of the old citadel in Khojand. Although the oldest surface remains of the walls date only to the 10th century, Soviet and Tajik excavations of the site have revealed that below the modern surface are medieval, Hellenistic and Achaemenid layers. These layers have revealed fortifications dating to around the 4th century BC.

Other remains include household utensils, armaments and building materials which are exhibited in the Museum of Regional Studies in Khojand. The site has also revealed numerous Hellenistic coins and pottery.

In the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot;, below the city there is a rhetorical question in Latin: &quot;Hic Alexander responsum accepit: usque quo Alexander?&quot; () — referencing both his insatiable appetite for conquest and a legend from the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; in which &quot;celestial creatures&quot; admonished Alexander to not pursue further explorations, which would ultimately lead to his untimely death.

==In fiction==
Alexandria Eschate is the final destination of Euxenus, son of Eutychides of the deme of Pallene, the protagonist of &quot;Alexander at the World&#x27;s End&quot; by Tom Holt.

&quot;Horses of Heaven&quot;, by Gillian Bradshaw, is set in Alexandria Eschate, c. 140 BCE.

<text>Sparse binary polynomial hashing (SBPH) is a generalization of Bayesian spam filtering that can match mutating phrases as well as single words. 

SBPH is a way of generating a large number of features from an incoming text automatically, and then using statistics to determine the weights for each of those features in terms of their predictive values for spam/nonspam evaluation.

<text>Within signal processing, in many cases only one image with noise is available, and averaging is then realized in a local neighborhood. Results are acceptable if the noise is smaller in size than the smallest objects of interest in the image, but blurring of edges is a serious disadvantage. In the case of smoothing within a single image, one has to assume that there are no changes in the gray levels of the underlying image data. This assumption is clearly violated at locations of image edges, and edge blurring is a direct consequence of violating the assumption. 

==Description==

Averaging is a special case of discrete convolution. For a 3 by 3 neighborhood, the convolution mask &quot;M&quot; is:

The significance of the central pixel may be increased, as it approximates the properties of noise with a Gaussian probability distribution:

<text>Sir Alexander Lockwood Smith (born 13 November 1948) is a New Zealand politician and diplomat who was High Commissioner of New Zealand to the United Kingdom from 2013 to 2017 and Speaker of the House of Representatives from 2008 to 2013.

Smith is a member of the New Zealand National Party and served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1984 until his retirement to pursue diplomatic roles in 2013. He represented the Kaipara and Rodney electorates and was briefly a list MP. In the Fourth National Government, he served as Minister of Education from 1990 to 1996 and later as Minister of Agriculture, Minister for International Trade, and Associate Minister of Finance.

==Early years==
Smith attended Auckland Grammar School in 1961. He has a PhD in Animal science from the University of Adelaide. Before entering politics he lectured at Massey University, worked as a television quizmaster for the children&#x27;s quiz shows &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; and &quot;The W 3 Show&quot;, and was Marketing Manager at the New Zealand Dairy Board.

==Member of Parliament==




Smith was first elected in 1984 as the MP for Kaipara. He represented this electorate until it was abolished in 1996 during the shift to mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation. Following the election he was the representative for Rodney until the election where he stood as a list-only candidate and was elected as a list MP.

== Minister in the Fourth National Government ==
Smith served as Minister of Education from 1990 until 1996 in the Fourth National Government of New Zealand. During this period he implemented a number of changes to the tertiary education sector (universities and technical institutions). One high-profile change involved a radical increase in student fees, as recommended by the Todd Report, which the government had commissioned to address issues of funding.

As opposition education spokesman in 1990, Smith promised to remove the Labour Government&#x27;s tertiary tuition fee of $1250, if elected. Once in office, he kept this promise on a technicality: he shifted the burden of charging fees for courses from the government to the institutions, who then had to charge even higher tuition fees due to decreased government funding.

Smith&#x27;s term as Education Minister also saw the introduction of means-testing for student allowances, with the effect that students of middle-class parents became ineligible for allowances until they reached 25 years of age.

In 1996 Smith took up the Agriculture and Trade Negotiation portfolios: Wyatt Creech succeeded him as Education Minister. Smith also became Minister for International Trade and for Tourism, as well as holding responsibilities as Associate Minister of Finance, Associate Minister of Immigration (International Access and Processing), and Minister Responsible for Contact Energy Ltd.

As Trade Minister, Smith spearheaded New Zealand&#x27;s efforts at the 1999 APEC negotiations. He successfully negotiated New Zealand&#x27;s free-trade agreement with Singapore, which became the NZ – Singapore Closer Economic Partnership. At the WTO Ministerial in Seattle, he took part in efforts which later lead to the Doha Development Round.

==Opposition, 1999–2008==
In opposition, Smith held a number of spokesperson roles for the National Party, including those of Foreign Affairs, Commerce, and Immigration. In his role as Immigration spokesman, Smith challenged Mangere MP Taito Phillip Field over alleged impropriety in Field&#x27;s dealings with constituents.

During the 2008 election campaign, on 22 October 2008, Smith made some comments in an interview with &quot;The Marlborough Express&quot; concerning seasonal Asian and Pacific workers that caused controversy. Regarding Pacific workers he said that some employers &quot;are having to teach them things like how to use a toilet or shower...&quot; And he said that for pruning trees: &quot;some of the Asian workers have been more productive... because their hands are smaller.&quot; Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia described these remarks as &quot;racist&quot;, and the Prime Minister Helen Clark characterised them as &quot;absolutely daft&quot;. Smith later stated that the media had presented his comments out of context, and that he had repeated the views of employers whom he had talked to; he expressed regret at any unintended offence taken. The parliamentary leader of the National Party, John Key, subsequently referred to this statement as an apology.

== Speaker of the House ==
Following the National Party&#x27;s successes in the 2008 election, Members of Parliament unanimously elected Smith as Speaker of the House. Smith took a rather different approach from his predecessor, being more active in requiring ministers to provide answers to oral questions. Smith was re-elected as Speaker of the House again on 20 December 2011.

Smith was expected to retire from Parliament and to be appointed High Commissioner of New Zealand to the United Kingdom later in 2012, but stayed on until February 2013. He gave his valedictory speech on 13 February 2013; this was in fact his first speech in Parliament in four years, as Speakers perform an apolitical role. Reflecting on his nearly 30 years in Parliament, he listed voting against the Homosexual Law Reform Bill in 1986 as his biggest regret:

I faced the classic dilemma of voting according to my own judgement or the opinion of those I was elected to represent. As a new member, I opted for the latter and I&#x27;ve always regretted it.

Smith was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services as a Member of Parliament and as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

==High Commissioner to the United Kingdom==
Smith began his term as High Commissioner of New Zealand to the United Kingdom on 25 March 2013, with a pōwhiri at New Zealand House in London. He stepped down from the role on 25 March 2017. He was replaced by Sir Jerry Mateparae, the former Governor-General.

==Personal life==
On 4 July 2009 he married longtime partner, Alexandra Lang, in the Legislative Council Chamber of Parliament.

<text>Bernd Cullmann (11 October 1939 – 13 January 2025) was a West German sprinter who won a gold medal in 4×100 m relay at the 1960 Summer Olympics. The German team finished second behind the American team, equaling its own world record of 39.5, but the Americans were later disqualified for an incorrect exchange.

Cullmann was gem cutter by profession and a national champion in the 50 m indoor in 1960, and in the 60 m indoor in 1961. He was part of the German relay teams that set two world records. His brother Hans was a middle distance runner.

Cullmann died on 13 January 2025, at the age of 85.

<doc id="1075926" wikidata="Q410125" url="?curid=1075926" title="Crown ether">
<text>In organic chemistry, crown ethers are cyclic chemical compounds that consist of a ring containing several ether groups (). The most common crown ethers are cyclic oligomers of ethylene oxide, the repeating unit being ethyleneoxy, i.e., . Important members of this series are the tetramer (&quot;n&quot; = 4), the pentamer (&quot;n&quot; = 5), and the hexamer (&quot;n&quot; = 6). The term &quot;crown&quot; refers to the resemblance between the structure of a crown ether bound to a cation, and a crown sitting on a person&#x27;s head. The first number in a crown ether&#x27;s name refers to the number of atoms in the cycle, and the second number refers to the number of those atoms that are oxygen. Crown ethers are much broader than the oligomers of ethylene oxide; an important group are derived from catechol.

Crown ethers strongly bind certain cations, forming complexes. The oxygen atoms are well situated to coordinate with a cation located at the interior of the ring, whereas the exterior of the ring is hydrophobic. The resulting cations often form salts that are soluble in nonpolar solvents, and for this reason crown ethers are useful in phase transfer catalysis. The denticity of the polyether influences the affinity of the crown ether for various cations. For example, 18-crown-6 has high affinity for potassium cation, 15-crown-5 for sodium cation, and 12-crown-4 for lithium cation. The high affinity of 18-crown-6 for potassium ions contributes to its toxicity. The smallest crown ether still capable of binding cations is 8-crown-4, with the largest experimentally confirmed crown ether being 81-crown-27. Crown ethers are not the only macrocyclic ligands that have affinity for the potassium cation. Ionophores such as valinomycin also display a marked preference for the potassium cation over other cations.

Crown ethers have been shown to coordinate to Lewis acids through electrostatic, σ-hole (see halogen bond) interactions, between the Lewis basic oxygen atoms of the crown ether and the electrophilic Lewis acid center.

==History==
In 1967, Charles Pedersen, who was a chemist working at DuPont, discovered a simple method of synthesizing a crown ether when he was trying to prepare a complexing agent for divalent cations. His strategy entailed linking two catecholate groups through one hydroxyl on each molecule. This linking defines a polydentate ligand that could partially envelop the cation and, by ionization of the phenolic hydroxyls, neutralize the bound dication. He was surprised to isolate a by-product that strongly complexed potassium cations. Citing earlier work on the dissolution of potassium in 16-crown-4, he realized that the cyclic polyethers represented a new class of complexing agents that were capable of binding alkali metal cations. He proceeded to report systematic studies of the synthesis and binding properties of crown ethers in a seminal series of papers. The fields of organic synthesis, phase transfer catalysts, and other emerging disciplines benefited from the discovery of crown ethers. Pedersen particularly popularized the dibenzo crown ethers.

Pedersen shared the 1987 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of the synthetic routes to, and binding properties of, crown ethers.

==Affinity for cations==
Due to the chelate effect and macrocyclic effect, crown ethers exhibit stronger affinities for diverse cations than their divided or acyclic analogs. Hereby, the cation selectivity for alkali metal ions is mainly dependent on the size and charge density of the ion and the cavity size of the crown ether. 

Affinities of a given crown ether towards the cations of lithium, sodium, and potassium can change by multiple magnitudes, which is attributed to the high differences in their charge density. Between the cations of potassium, rubidium, and cesium changes in affinities are less notable, as their charge density varies less than the alkali metals in earlier periods.

Apart from its high affinity for potassium cations, 18-crown-6 can also bind to protonated amines and form very stable complexes in both solution and the gas phase. Some amino acids, such as lysine, contain a primary amine on their side chains. Those protonated amino groups can bind to the cavity of 18-crown-6 and form stable complexes in the gas phase. Hydrogen-bonds are formed between the three hydrogen atoms of protonated amines and three oxygen atoms of 18-crown-6. These hydrogen-bonds make the complex a stable adduct. By incorporating luminescent substituents into their backbone, these compounds have proved to be sensitive ion probes, as changes in the absorption or fluorescence of the photoactive groups can be measured for very low concentrations of metal present. Some attractive examples include macrocycles, incorporating oxygen and/or nitrogen donors, that are attached to polyaromatic species such as anthracenes (via the 9 and/or 10 positions) or naphthalenes (via the 2 and 3 positions). Some modifications of dye ionophores by crown ethers exhibit extinction coefficients that are dependent on the chain lengths of chained cations. 

== Pharmaceutical applications ==
Crown ethers have been investigated as excipients in pharmaceutical applications, demonstrating potential to improve the solubility of poorly soluble drugs and enhance their permeability across mucosal membranes. Evaluation of antibacterial activities of some thia crown ethers indicated that they can be considered as inhibitors for S. aureus methicillin resistance and P. aeruginosa. In addition, some of these compounds were screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activity on &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphilococcus aureus, Pseudomanas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Candida albicans&quot;. Despite these promising properties, their broader application remains limited due to concerns over the toxicity associated with crown ethers.

<text>The Brae field is a Scottish oil field. The name comes from a Scots language word for hillside. 
The field was discovered in 1974 by well 16/7-1 drilled by a semi-submersible rig Odin Drill for operator Pan Ocean.

The Fields are operated by TAQA Bratani and are located in UKCS block 16/7a. Three accumulations total about 70 million tonnes of oil liquids and a further 22 cubic kilometres of gas. The main platforms currently produce from underlying reserves, with regular infill drilling to identify and exploit undrained pockets in the Brae stratigraphy. A number of subsea tieback fields in the area produce through facilities on the platforms, extending their viability into the future. Gas is exported to St Fergus, Scotland via the SAGE pipeline system and oil is exported via the Forties system.

== Field reservoirs ==
The hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Brae field have the following properties.
== Topside facilities ==
The topsides for Brae Alpha (Brae South) were designed by Matthew Hall Engineering which was awarded the contract in August 1979. Initially there were facilities for 19 oil production wells, 14 water injection wells, two gas injection wells and 11 spare slots. The production capacity was 100,000 barrels of oil per day, 12,000 barrels of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) per day and 4.25 million standard cubic metres of gas per day. There are two production trains each with three stages of separation with the first stage operating at the exceptionally high initial pressure, for that time, of 248 bar. Electricity generation was powered by four 25 MW Rolls-Royce SK-30 gas turbines. The topside accommodation was for 240 people. There were 14 topside modules and the topsides weight was 31,000 tonnes.

The topsides for Brae Bravo (Brae North) were designed by Matthew Hall Engineering which was awarded the contract in October 1983. Initially there were facilities for 12 oil production wells, three gas injection wells and 19 spare slots. The production capacity was 75,000 barrels of liquid hydrocarbons per day, and 11.3 million standard cubic metres of gas per day. There is a single production train with four stages of separation with the first stage operating at a pressure of 103. Electricity generation was powered by three 24 MW Rolls-Royce/GEC ERB-124C gas turbines. The topside accommodation was for 240 people. There were 21 topside modules and the topsides weight was 33,000 tonnes.

The topsides for East Brae were designed by Matthew Hall Engineering which was awarded the contract in October 1988. Initially there were facilities for 13 oil wells, and four gas injection wells and 13 spare slots. The production capacity was 120,000 barrels of liquid hydrocarbon per day, and 17.6 million standard cubic metres of gas per day. There is a single production train with three stages of separation with the first stage operating at a pressure of 102 bar. Electric power is provided from Brae A and Brae B by subsea cable. The topside accommodation was for 160 people. The topsides weight was 18,500 tonnes. Fabrication details are shown in the table.

<doc id="1075932" wikidata="Q658547" url="?curid=1075932" title="Louis Walsh">
<text>Michael Louis Vincent Walsh (born 5 August 1952) is an Irish music manager and television personality. He has managed Johnny Logan, Boyzone, Jedward and Westlife, four of Ireland&#x27;s most successful pop acts in the 1990s and 2000s. He has also served as a judge on television talent competition shows, including (2001–2002), &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot; (2003–2004), &quot;The X Factor&quot; (2004–2014; 2016–2017), and &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2018–2019). In 2024, Walsh was a contestant on the twenty-third series of the reality show &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

==Early life==
Michael Louis Vincent Walsh was born in Kiltimagh on 5 August 1952, the son of Maureen and Frank Walsh. He is the second of eight children. He was raised Roman Catholic.

==Music manager==
Walsh moved to Dublin in the late 1970s to start his music industry career. In 1993 he created an Irish version of Take That, which the papers picked up on when he advertised open auditions. The end result was Boyzone, whom he managed to international success with 16 top three singles, six of which were number ones, as well as four number one albums, selling more than 20 million copies worldwide. When Ronan Keating announced he wanted to take a break from Boyzone, Walsh continued to manage his career. Keating achieved a number one hit with &quot;When You Say Nothing At All&quot; in 1999 and also &quot;Life Is a Rollercoaster&quot; in 2000, while his album sold 4.4 million copies. Keating and Walsh later agreed to part company as Keating&#x27;s solo career reached an all-time high.

Walsh then went back to the boy band formula to create Westlife, which Keating co-managed with Walsh for the first couple of Westlife&#x27;s number one singles and albums. Westlife were an Irish boy band, formed in Dublin in July 1998. They sold over 50 million records worldwide, a total that included studio albums, singles, video releases, and compilation albums. The group accumulated 14 number-one singles in the United Kingdom. They achieved a total of 26 UK top ten singles over their 14-year career, and achieved the first number one on the UK Singles Downloads Chart with &quot;Flying Without Wings&quot; in September 2004. Despite an earlier bitter feud, Walsh had a public reconciliation with Boyzone on the ITV2 programme &quot;Ghosthunting With...&quot; in which they explored a network of subterranean streets beneath Edinburgh. In December 2012, he became Union J&#x27;s manager.

==Television career==
Walsh&#x27;s first television work was in 2001, in the Irish version of &quot;Popstars&quot;. The following year Walsh appeared as a judge on the UK ITV show &quot;&quot; with Pete Waterman and Geri Halliwell. Walsh went head-to-head with Waterman on the show with his girlband Girls Aloud battling it out with Waterman&#x27;s boy band One True Voice. Girls Aloud&#x27;s debut single &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; reached number one in the UK. Walsh managed the band to achieve a million singles sales while their debut album went platinum.

Walsh also frequently appears on various talent shows on Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ), the most recent being &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot;. He covered for Simon Cowell as a judge on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; during series four&#x27;s Birmingham auditions in February 2010, due to Cowell being ill. He again filled in for David Hasselhoff at the London auditions in the following series when Hasselhoff was unavailable due to appearing in pantomime. 

In January 2012, Walsh appeared on the ITV documentary series &quot;The Talent Show Story&quot; where he was interviewed about being a judge on &quot;The X Factor&quot; and &quot;Popstars The Rivals&quot;. Fellow &quot;Popstars&quot; judge Pete Waterman also appeared on the programme as well as past and present &quot;X Factor&quot; judges, including Dannii Minogue, Simon Cowell, Kelly Rowland and Gary Barlow.

===&quot;The X Factor&quot;===

Walsh appeared from 2004 as a judge, along with Simon Cowell and Sharon Osbourne, on ITV talent show &quot;The X Factor&quot;. In 2004, Walsh found chart success with G4, who went on to have a chart-topping album and completed two tours of the UK. In 2005, Walsh managed the winner Shayne Ward, whose debut single &quot;That&#x27;s My Goal&quot; spent four weeks at UK number one.

In November 2005, Walsh quit the show mid-series out of protest regarding his treatment on the show; the most explicit example being Osbourne&#x27;s drenching him with water during a live recording. Walsh returned on the Saturday evening&#x27;s live show, stating that he could not abandon his remaining competitor and eventual winner, Shayne Ward. Ward went on to win the competition with over 10 million votes in the final. Walsh then went on to win &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot; with actress Lucy Benjamin.

ITV announced in March 2007 that Walsh would not return as a judge on &quot;The X Factor&quot;, but would remain behind the scenes managing some acts from the show. According to UK tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;, the decision to be replaced with two other judges came as a shock to him. He was replaced on the panel by American choreographer Brian Friedman. Osbourne, Cowell, Friedman and new judge Dannii Minogue appeared at the London auditions; however, after the first few days, Cowell decided to re-hire Walsh to the panel and hire Friedman as a choreographic instructor for the live show stages. On 22 June 2007, Walsh confirmed he would be returning as a judge for the fourth series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;. Friedman then became the show&#x27;s creative director. Walsh mentored the Over 25s category in series four. In the &#x27;Judges Houses&#x27; stage of the competition, Walsh took his acts to Dublin and invited guest Kian Egan to help him decide whom to take through to the live shows.

Cowell reportedly told Walsh off for his comments about the Spice Girls. Walsh had said that the girl group were &quot;past their sell-by date&quot; and lacking in talent, but Cowell already had plans to book the girls on the show.

In 2008, Walsh returned for the fifth series along with Cowell, Minogue and Cheryl Cole, who was hired after Osbourne quit the previous June. In this series, Walsh mentored the groups, choosing JLS, Girlband and Bad Lashes to represent him in the live shows. Walsh took his acts to Castle Leslie in Ireland during the judges houses stage where he was aided by Westlife star Shane Filan. Bad Lashes and Girlband were the first two acts to be eliminated over the first two weeks, but JLS finished as runners-up.

Walsh returned to the sixth series show in 2009, again mentoring the groups for the fourth time in six years. During the judges houses stage, the Groups and Walsh flew to Lake Como in Italy where Boyzone singer Ronan Keating helped Walsh pick his final three. Walsh took Kandy Rain, Miss Frank and John &amp; Edward to the live shows. Kandy Rain were eliminated in the first live results show, from which Walsh was absent due to the sudden death of Boyzone member Stephen Gately. Walsh was absent again on the Saturday and Sunday of the second week of live shows due to Gately&#x27;s funeral on 17 October. In week three, Miss Frank were eliminated from the competition, while John &amp; Edward were eliminated in week seven, though went on to have successful careers in the industry.

In 2010, Walsh mentored the Over 28s category on the seventh series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;. In the judges houses stage, Walsh took his acts to Adare in Ireland. Walsh was helped by former judge, Sharon Osbourne. His last surviving act, Mary Byrne, was a semi-finalist who finished fifth overall. 

Walsh returned to the show in 2011 for series eight. He joined new panellists Gary Barlow, Kelly Rowland and Tulisa, who replaced former judges Cowell, Minogue and Cole, all of whom left the show after series seven. This meant that, following Cowell&#x27;s departure, Walsh became the only original judge left on the programme. During the Bootcamp stages it was announced that he would mentor the Over 25s category for the rest of the competition. 

In the Judges Houses stage, Walsh took his acts to Barcelona in Spain where he was aided by Cowell&#x27;s former assistant judge Sinitta. Walsh chose Kitty Brucknell, Sami Brookes, Johnny Robinson and Jonjo Kerr to go through to the live shows. His most successful act of the competition was Brucknell who made it to week six of the live shows before she was eliminated.

During the live shows of series eight, in an interview with former judge Minogue, Walsh stated that he did not know whether he would return as a judge in 2012. However, on 3 May 2012, Walsh confirmed he would return for his ninth series alongside Tulisa and Barlow. Former American &quot;X Factor&quot; judge Nicole Scherzinger who replaced Kelly Rowland joined Walsh, Contostavlos and Barlow as the new full-time judge for ninth series.

Walsh filled in for Cowell at the Kansas City auditions for season two of the American version while Cowell was recovering from bronchitis. He joined the other season two judges: L.A. Reid, Demi Lovato and Britney Spears, and was introduced with the line, &quot;When Simon needs an opinion from someone he trusts, I&#x27;m the man he calls&quot;. His episode broke ratings records for the series.

Walsh returned for the tenth series and was joined by Barlow, Scherzinger and fellow original judge Osbourne, who replaced Tulisa. Due to being the only judge to remain for the whole ten years, he was awarded by being assigned the Boys category, instead of the Overs and Groups he was assigned to every year, since mentoring Shayne Ward in 2005. His category consisted of Nicholas McDonald, Luke Friend, and Sam Callahan. McDonald finished in second place to Sam Bailey, mentored by Osbourne. Despite not winning, this was still by far Walsh&#x27;s most successful year as a judge on the show due to going 5 weeks (breaking a record) without having any of his acts in the bottom two and had two of them (Friend and McDonald) in the final.

In 2014, Walsh returned for the eleventh series, while Barlow, Osbourne and Scherzinger were replaced by former judges Cowell and Cole, and new judge Mel B. In 2015, Walsh stated that he was considering not returning to the twelfth series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, citing his desire to return to full-time music management. After rumours circulated that he had been fired from the show, Walsh announced his decision to quit the show, stating that he had not been fired, but he was not &quot;hanging around for them this year.&quot;

In 2016, Walsh returned as a judge to replace Nick Grimshaw for the thirteenth series, alongside Cowell, Osbourne (who replaced Cheryl) and Scherzinger (who replaced Rita Ora). The same judges returned for the fourteenth series. On 7 June 2018, Walsh announced he had decided not to return for the fifteenth series, in order to focus on music management and other commitments. &quot;The show needs a change and I&#x27;m ready to leave,&quot; said Walsh in a statement. Walsh was replaced by Louis Tomlinson.

In 2019, Walsh along with Cowell and Scherzinger returned to &quot;The X Factor&quot; as judges in the newly created format &quot;The X Factor: Celebrity&quot;. He was mentor of the winner Megan McKenna, marking Walsh&#x27;s third overall victory on the show.

===&quot;Ireland&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;===
In May 2015, it was announced that Walsh, would be launching a new Irish talent show, produced by Cowell, as a judge, set to premiere in 2017 or 2018. Walsh stated that he would like to broadcast an Irish edition of &quot;Got Talent&quot;, though he stated that the untitled talent show was only in early development. Walsh later confirmed himself on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; as head judge on the show, &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, alongside judges Michelle Visage, Denise van Outen and Jason Byrne. The show launched on 3 February 2018 on TV3 and ran for two series before being cancelled in July 2019.

===Junk Kouture===
Walsh has been a judge on sustainable fashion programme Junk Kouture since 2014 and has been joined by celebrities such as Rosanna Davison, Vogue Williams and Michelle Visage on the judging panel in recent years.

===Other television===
In July 2011, he raced the &quot;Reasonably Priced Car&quot;, a Kia Cee&#x27;d, during series 17 of Top Gear On 1 September 2014, Walsh appeared on an episode of &quot;Who&#x27;s Doing the Dishes?&quot; In January 2016, ITV announced that Walsh would appear in &quot;Drive&quot;, a new show which pitted eight celebrities against each other in a series of races in different vehicles. Hosted by Vernon Kay, the show began airing on 5 April 2016 In 2023 he was a guest on Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Eurovision: 30 Unforgettable Moments&quot; a chart countdown based on the song contest which also featured contributions from David and Carrie Grant, The Fizz and Johnny Logan, with footage from the 1980s&#x27; contest showing Walsh cheering on Logan included in the run time. In March 2024, Walsh entered the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; house as a housemate on the twenty-third series. During his stint in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, Walsh revealed that he had survived a diagnosis of Waldenström macroglobulinemia, a rare form of blood cancer, in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. He reached the final and finished in fourth place.

==Groups and performers managed by Walsh==
==Controversies==
===Ronan Keating===
When Ronan Keating announced he wanted to take a break from Boyzone, Walsh continued to manage his career. Keating achieved a number one hit with &quot;Life is a Rollercoaster&quot; in 2000 while his album sold 4.4 million copies. Keating and Walsh later agreed to part company, and then had a bitter falling out. Walsh told the press, &quot;[Keating] wasn&#x27;t the most talented one – he&#x27;s not a great singer and he&#x27;s got no personality.&quot; Keating later told &quot;Closer&quot; magazine, &quot;That man absolutely tried to ruin me and if he thinks we can ever hug and make up he can forget it. I haven&#x27;t heard from him in three years and I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem if I never saw him again. He&#x27;s not a nice character.&quot; The feud between the two men had apparently ended by March 2008, and they helped select the finalists in the Groups category in &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

===&quot;Louis Walsh v News Group Newspapers&quot;===
Walsh sought access to documents which allegedly showed that &quot;The Sun&quot; UK tabloid paid €700 to a man who made a false sexual assault accusation against him. The man was later imprisoned for the false accusation. The senior counsel for Walsh told Ireland&#x27;s High Court on 14 May 2012, &quot;&quot;The Sun&quot; directed the operation to take out Louis Walsh as a public person.&quot; On 10 August 2012, the High Court ordered &quot;The Sun&quot; to give all documents and information to Walsh relating to the preparation of an article in &quot;The Sun&quot; entitled &quot;Louis Probed Over &#x27;Sex Attack&#x27; on Man in Loo&quot;. The article was published both in &quot;The Sun&quot; and their website on 23 June 2011. Walsh sued for defamation of character resulting from the false and malicious allegations and the case was settled out of court. Walsh was awarded damages of €500,000 and €180,000 costs on 28 November 2012. Despite winning the legal case, the false accusations had a &quot;lasting effect&quot; on Walsh who was, as of 2015, suffering from paranoid thoughts and panic attacks as a result of the ordeal.

===Stephen Gately===
Walsh was unaware of Stephen Gately being gay when he selected him for Boyzone and said in 2008 that, had he known, he would have thought twice before picking him. He elaborated that he might not have picked Gately because &quot;it wasn&#x27;t cool then to have a gay guy in a band&quot;.

=== Mel B===
During an interview conducted by Sarah-Jane Crawford on &quot;The Xtra Factor&quot; during the semi-final results show in 2014, Walsh groped Mel B by her buttocks. Visibly irritated, she scolded and moved away from Walsh, who said he was only &quot;looking after her&quot;. Crawford and the other judges, Cowell and Cheryl, tried to reassure her that she was &quot;safe&quot; while laughing off the gesture. After resurfacing on social media in July 2018, a few months after the Me Too movement began, the clip amassed millions of views on social media; it prompted discussion on the treatment of women by men and drew condemnation of Walsh and the responses of Crawford, Cowell and Cheryl. Some viewers defended Walsh based on his alleged homosexuality and the justification that he was unaware of what he was doing, while others pointed out that, if it can happen so openly in a public setting, there is a correlation to how frequently it may happen behind closed doors. Walsh stated on 21 July 2018 that he grabbed Mel B&#x27;s buttocks as a joke, but conceded that the gesture was no longer &quot;politically correct&quot; due to social media reaction.

=== Misha B===
Misha B, a contestant from the 2011 series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, stated in June 2020 that she had been a victim of racism and accusations made by Walsh and Tulisa, who were judges on the show at the time. She says that the producers and screenwriters created a narrative to make her appear to be a bully. The &quot;X Factor&quot; team announced that they would look into the matter.

<text>Susan Jane Kedgley (born 1948) is a New Zealand politician, food campaigner and author. Before entering politics Kedgley worked for the United Nations in New York for 8 years and for a decade as a television reporter, director and producer in New Zealand.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Kedgley stated she had a sheltered upbringing being given a &#x27;proper&#x27; girls upbringing and was a debutante. Along with her twin sister Helen Kedgley, she went to Samuel Marsden Collegiate School and later Victoria University. While studying at Victoria she became interested in politics. Kedgley became involved in student politics and was a member of the Victoria University of Wellington Students&#x27; Association from 1967 to 1969. She then studied at the University of Auckland and in 1971, while still a student, she joined Women&#x27;s Movement for Freedom, a group formed in 1970 by Patricia Enting. In 1971, Enting handed over the leadership of the group to Kedgely, who renamed it Women&#x27;s Liberation. That same year she stood for the Auckland City Council as a Labour Party candidate. Kedgley&#x27;s Master of Arts thesis in political science was submitted to the University of Otago in 1972.

Kedgley was employed as a researcher on the show &quot;Checkpoint&quot;. She was unable to become a presenter, being told at the time that women couldn&#x27;t because their voices &quot;aren&#x27;t deep enough and they lack authority&quot;. Kedgley has written a number of books on feminist issues, and was one of the founding leaders of the women&#x27;s liberation movement in New Zealand. Her book, titled &quot;Eating Safely in a Toxic World&quot;, set the scene in New Zealand for a new movement of &#x27;safe-food campaigners&#x27;.

Her autobiography &quot;Fifty Years a Feminist&quot; was published in 2021.

===Political career===
====Local body politics====
In 1992 Kedgley, having left Labour to join the incipient Green Party, was elected the Wellington City Council (WCC). She remained a member for 7 years and was the founder and co-convenor of the New Zealand Safe Food Campaign. While on the WCC, Kedgley held the roles of chairperson, Consultation Committee, 1996–1998 and chairperson, Transport and Infrastructure Committee, 1998–1999. She resigned from the council in December 1999 after winning a parliamentary seat, saying it would be impossible to carry out both roles successfully at once. Before leaving she pushed for a by-election to be held to replace her rather than an appointment. The Green Party did not stand a candidate and both the party and Kedgley endorsed independent candidate Ray Ahipene-Mercer, an environmentalist, who won the seat.

====Member of Parliament====


Kedgley represented the Green Party in the New Zealand Parliament since first becoming a Member of Parliament as a list MP in the 1999 election until 2011. She won re-election in the 2002, 2005 and 2008 general elections. Particular political interests include health, food safety, animal welfare, consumer affairs, transport and women&#x27;s issues.
In 2005 her Employment Relations (Flexible Working Arrangements) Amendment Bill, granting employees with dependants the right to request part-time or flexible hours, was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot. The bill was eventually passed as the Employment Relations (Flexible Working Arrangements) Amendment Act 2007.

In 2006 her Consumer&#x27;s Right to Know (Food Information) Bill was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot, but was defeated at its first reading.

Kedgley was the Chairperson of the New Zealand Parliament Health Committee from 2005 to 2008 and was the Deputy Chair for 6 years prior.

In September 2010 she announced that she would not be standing for re-election in the 2011 general election. She gave her valedictory speech on 27 September.

====Return to local government====
In July 2013, Kedgley announced that she would be running for the Greater Wellington Regional Council on a Green Party ticket in the Wellington ward. She won a position on the Regional Council as well as the Capital and Coast District Health Board in the October elections. She announced that she would not stand for re-election to the Regional Council in 2019, but will contest the District Health Board. She was re-elected to the District Health Board at the 2019 elections.

As of 2021 Kedgley is on the board of Consumer NZ having been elected in 2013.

== Honours and awards ==
In 2016, Kedgley received the New Zealand Women of Influence Award for Diversity in recognition of her work towards greater gender diversity in the workplace. In the 2020 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to women and governance.

== Personal life ==
In 1990 she married Wellington lawyer and former Wellington City and Regional Councillor, Denis Foot, and they have one son.

Foot was a Wellington City Councillor from 1971 to 1977 representing the Citizens&#x27; Association when he stood down. In 1980 he was elected for another spell on the city council as well as to the Wellington Regional Council, stepping down in 1983. At the he stood in the electorate as the Green Party candidate, placing third. At the 1992 local elections he stood successfully again for the regional council, this time for the Green Party, and was re-elected in 1995 before retiring in 1998.

<doc id="1075934" wikidata="Q7621291" url="?curid=1075934" title="Strandloper (novel)">
<text>Strandloper is a novel by English writer Alan Garner, published in 1996. It is loosely based on the story of a Cheshire labourer, William Buckley. The historical figures of Edward Stanley and John Batman also appear as characters. An English epileptic is transported to Australia, where he escapes and becomes the holy man of the Beingalite people. Many years later he returns to England, and walks his home landscapes like an Aboriginal. Reaching the village church, he smears his body with clay and performs a spirit dance.

Critics found the book private, idiosyncratic, and difficult; Jenny Turner admired its Buntingesque construction but disliked its biblical tone. The Tolkien scholar Jason Fisher likened it to a baptism of folklore that demanded work from the reader, but found that worth the effort.

==Plot==

In 1803, a farmer&#x27;s son from Cheshire, William Buckley, participates in folk rituals which coexist with the local Christian church. An epileptic, William is prone to visions which contain patterns. He is being taught to read by the son of a local land-owner, Edward Stanley, who sees him as both friend and test subject. Both men have a close relationship with William’s fiancée, Esther. Edward’s father, Sir John, sees working-class literacy and community rituals as threats, and gets William convicted on a charge of trespass. William is transported to Australia.

On arrival in Australia, William escapes, surviving in the outback, and collapses on the grave of an Aboriginal shaman. He is discovered by some Beingalite people, who regard him as the reincarnation of their shaman, Murrangurk. William learns the Beingalite language; his epilepsy enables him to become their shaman. Taking Murrangurk’s name, he stays for thirty years, becoming a &quot;feather-foot&quot; - arbitrating in disputes, carrying out justice, and performing the &quot;dreaming&quot; rituals. The patterns he saw in his youthful visions are revealed as Aboriginal.

Many years later, he intervenes to prevent the slaughter of some newly-arrived English soldiers. He mediates between the Aboriginal tribes and the British sheep-farmers led by John Batman. For this, he is granted a governmental pardon, but remains as Murrangurk with his rituals. The aims of the settlers and Aborigines soon prove incompatible, as the Beingalite slaughter the settlers&#x27; sheep. In reprisal, the Beingalite are massacred, and the remnants of the tribe are forcibly Europeanised. Realizing his efforts have failed, he performs one last ritual in which he sees Bungil, the Beingalite ancestor. Bungil tells him that the Dreaming has been preserved: it is William&#x27;s role to take it to his own home, for another person to take up later. As a token, Bungil gives William a ritual woomera spear-thrower. 
Back in Cheshire, William finds that the old community ritual has been destroyed. He meets Edward and gives him the woomera. Esther is a married woman; she has named her son after William, but it seems the actual father is Edward. Though heartbroken, William accepts these events as part of &quot;the Dance&quot;. Bidding Esther goodbye, he leaves to ritually walk the landscapes of Cheshire as he once walked Australia. His walk ends in the church. Taking off his clothes and painting his body with clay, he dances a spirit dance.

== Reception ==

The literary critic Jenny Turner, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, notes that &quot;Strandloper&quot; has been described as Garner&#x27;s &quot;first ever adult book&quot;. She praises the novel as &quot;constructed like a Buntingesque prose poem of continuity and rupture, environment and myth&quot;, commenting that the dialogue &quot;is stunningly harsh and bare, forcing the reader to work and think and learn&quot;. She criticizes the &quot;Aboriginal episodes&quot; as &quot;the usual anthropological nonsense, dotted with that giveaway primitive-peoples linguistic marker, the biblical cadence.&quot; In short, she finds the work &quot;disappointingly precious&quot; and &quot;a bit embarrassing to read&quot;, even if &quot;patches of the writing are lovely&quot;. 

The author and folklorist Neil Philip, writing in &quot;Signal&quot;, states that Garner &quot;clearly regards&quot; the real-life William Buckley as his &quot;spiritual ancestor&quot;. He notes that Aboriginal &quot;churinga&quot; are totemic artefacts that &quot;record sacred details of the eternal Dreamtime&quot;, in a form that only initiates can understand. In Philip&#x27;s view, that makes &quot;Strandloper&quot; heavy with private meaning, and accordingly &quot;hard to gauge&quot;: he supposes that the first page will cause many readers to give up, and that this was intentional on Garner&#x27;s part. He summarizes the book&#x27;s theme as that &quot;Aboriginal spirituality offers a balance of individual and community, and man and landscape, of a kind that we [Westerners] need&quot;. 
The novelist Brian Attebery, writing in &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction&quot;, admires Garner&#x27;s handling of the story. 
In his University of Oxford PhD thesis, the scholar of Welsh mythology Felix Taylor writes that &quot;Garner’s depiction of aboriginal cultures, first in Australia in &quot;Strandloper&quot; and then back in Cheshire in &quot;Boneland&quot;, develops ideas of rootedness in a local landscape which also connects him to the spirit of his ancestors.&quot; Taylor notes that Garner had studied Welsh mythology in relation to his native Cheshire, and had then expanded his &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; understanding of this &quot;into a wider conception of a universal mythic consciousness&quot;. In Taylor&#x27;s view, Garner portrayed in the novel &quot;what he saw as the psychologically restorative powers of mythological narratives and imagery.&quot;

The Tolkien scholar Jason Fisher, reviewing the book for the Mythopoeic Society&#x27;s &quot;Mythprint&quot;, calls it &quot;a remarkable, luminous, difficult book&quot;, and &quot;the most purely mythopoeic of all Garner’s novels&quot;. Fisher warns that the work &quot;is not for all readers&quot;, and not like Garner&#x27;s other novels, either. In Fisher&#x27;s view, it depicts &quot;Garner&#x27;s deep, almost baptismal immersion&quot; into folklore and then an &quot;alien mythology&quot;. The reader, he states, has to work actively to unravel &quot;its abstruse layers&quot;. He found it &quot;very much worth the effort&quot;. Another Tolkien scholar, Patrick Curry, lists &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot;, &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;, and &quot;Out of Africa&quot; as among the few works of &quot;mythic fiction&quot; that could be considered comparable to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, commenting that most of these were their authors&#x27; life&#x27;s work. He wrote in 1997 that &quot;Strandloper&quot; might perhaps find a place alongside those books, but that it was too early to tell.

<doc id="1075937" wikidata="Q7364115" url="?curid=1075937" title="Ron Mark">
<text>Ron Stanley Mark (born 29 January 1954) is a New Zealand politician of the New Zealand First party, and former soldier, who served as Minister of Defence between October 2017 and November 2020. He served as mayor of Carterton from 2010 to 2014, and again from 2022 defeating incumbent Greg Lang.

==Early life and family==
Mark was born in Masterton on 29 January 1954, the son of Apiti Stanley Maaka and Te Aroha Maaka (née Grace). He was fostered with six Pākehā foster families in Pahiatua, saying &quot;I wouldn’t have survived without them&quot;. He was educated at Tararua College from 1968 to 1970. Mark&#x27;s first wife was Gail (née Berry) Mark, and the couple had four children. On 12 February 2012, Mark told &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; that his partner of seven years, Christine Tracey, had made a leap year proposal. Marama Fox, formerly a Māori Party MP, is a cousin of Mark.

==Military and professional careers==
Mark pursued a military career between 1971 and 1990, initially serving in the New Zealand Army. His first unit was the Royal New Zealand Electrical and Mechanical Engineers before moving to 2/1 Battalion, 3 and 10 Tpt Regiments and Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Mounted Rifles before passing New Zealand Special Air Service selection. Mark served a 13-month tour of duty in the Sinai with the Multinational Force and Observers in 1982–83. After being refused entry into the NZSAS, he was contracted to the Sultanate of Oman as a technical staff officer from 1985 to 1986, and then joined the Sultan of Oman&#x27;s Armed Forces becoming an electrical and mechanical engineering officer in the Sultan&#x27;s Special Force Electrical and Mechanical Engineers between 1986 and 1990.

Between 1990 and 1996, Mark was a commercial consultant, ran an import and export business, and was an amusement park operator.

==Member of Parliament, 1996–2008==



In the 1993 election he was the Labour candidate for the Selwyn electorate. He was later involved in the discussions about the formation of the New Zealand Democratic Coalition.
When these failed, he joined New Zealand First.
He was a list MP from the 1996 election until his party&#x27;s failure to retain any seats in the 2008 election. During the (1996–98) coalition between New Zealand First and the National Party, he was the government&#x27;s Senior Whip.

The New Zealand television channel TV3 was banned for three days from filming in Parliament in August 2006 for showing Mark repeatedly giving the finger to another MP.

In 2009, Mark told media that while he still had a subscription with New Zealand First, he was &quot;not active&quot;, and that he would not rule out standing for Parliament with another party.

==Mayor of Carterton, 2010–2014==
In 2010, Mark was elected Mayor of Carterton in the Wairarapa. He succeeded outspoken mayor Gary McPhee who retired after two terms. In the 2013 local elections, Mark was returned as mayor unopposed.

==Return to Parliament, 2014–2020==
===Fourth term, 2014–2017===
Mark stood as a New Zealand First candidate at the 2014 general election, finishing third in the Wairarapa electorate. However, his ninth placing on the New Zealand First list saw him returned to Parliament, and he resigned as Mayor of Carterton, and was replaced by John Booth.

When the new Parliament was sworn in on 20 October 2014, Mark was one of two MPs nominated for the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. He received 13 votes, coming second to incumbent Speaker David Carter.

In Parliament, Mark was noted for being critical of attacks on private military contractors like himself, and critical of what he considered terrorist organizations like the African National Congress and those who fought against the government of Southern Rhodesia.

On 3 July 2015, he replaced Tracey Martin as deputy leader of New Zealand First.

In November 2015, Mark told National MP Melissa Lee to Go Back to Korea in parliament.

===Fifth term, 2017–2020===
During the , Mark contested Wairarapa, finishing third place. However, he was re-elected into Parliament on New Zealand First&#x27;s party list.

Following the 2017 general election, Mark was appointed Minister of Defence and Veterans following the formation of a coalition government consisting of the Labour Party, New Zealand First, and the Green Party. Mark was succeeded as New Zealand First deputy leader by Fletcher Tabuteau on 27 February 2018.

During the 2020 general election held on 17 October, Mark contested the Wairarapa electorate, coming third place behind Labour&#x27;s candidate Kieran McAnulty and National&#x27;s candidate Mike Butterick. He and his fellow NZ First MPs lost their seats after the party&#x27;s vote dropped to 2.6%, below the five percent threshold needed to enter Parliament.

On 9 November 2020, Mark was granted retention of the title &quot;The Honourable&quot; for life, in recognition of his term as a member of the Executive Council.

==After politics, 2020–present==
Mark and other former New Zealand First MPs were approached by the media ahead of the party&#x27;s AGM in June 2021. He said that he would not be attending the meeting or renewing his party membership, as he was finished with politics and not interested in returning to Parliament. Mark travelled to Ukraine to assist with humanitarian efforts during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===Mayor of Carterton, 2022–present===
Mark was re-elected as Mayor of Carterton in the 2022 New Zealand local elections. He ran on a campaign for more scrutiny of council operations to avoid previous &quot;cost blowouts&quot;, also drawing attention to what he described as &quot;some political parties...pushing for central control over everything, whether by asset stripping first or imposing more and more legislative requirements&quot;. He later clarified his concerns that this was [an]...&quot;ideological drive to centralise and put everything under the control of the government&quot;, citing the Three Waters reform programme as an example of this &quot;collectivism&quot;. Mark also expressed some concerns about the voting process due to high numbers of people not receiving their voting papers, or votes going missing in the mail, stating that &quot;constitutionally...[this]...is open to questioning by every court of law.&quot;

In August 2023, Mark expressed concern that a government review recommending that New Zealand&#x27;s 67 city and district councils and 11 regional councils be reorganised into 15 regional groupings could &quot;to a more centralised socialist viewpoint, disempowering our people.&quot; While serving as Mayor of Carterton between 2010 and 2014, Mark had supported the amalgamation of local government bodies. In April 2021, the Minister of Local Government Nanaia Mahuta had commissioned a review into the future of local government in New Zealand. A draft report was released on 28 October 2022 while the final report was released in July 2023. 

In early July 2024, Mayor Mark urged other local councils to consider amalgamating into larger entities due to the financial costs of the Sixth National Government&#x27;s &quot;Local Water Done Well&quot; programme, stating &quot;there was no room for &quot;fiefdoms doing their own thing in the future.&quot; Mayor of South Wairarapa Martin Connelly expressed disagreement with Mark, saying that &quot;it is far too early to know what the long-term effects will be.&quot;

===Waitangi Tribunal===
In mid January 2025, Mark was appointed to the Waitangi Tribunal by Minister for Māori Development Tama Potaka.

<text>Geoffrey William &quot;Geoff&quot; Bullock (born 6 November 1955) is an Australian singer-songwriter and pianist. He helped pioneer the Hills Christian Life Centre, which later became Hillsong Church. He was appointed as the church&#x27;s worship pastor and was also the convenor of their annual conferences from 1987 to 1995, before leaving Hillsong in late 1995.

Bullock has recorded over 20 albums and written two books, &quot;Hands of Grace&quot; (1998) and &quot;The power of your love... Jesus the unexpected God&quot; (2000).

== Early life and career ==

Geoffrey William Bullock was born on 6 November 1955 in Sydney. His father is Peter and his mother is Beth; and he grew up with a younger sister, Jane. Bullock was raised as a Presbyterian and attended Knox Grammar School from 1964 to 1972. He completed tertiary studies at North Sydney TAFE in 1976 for a Television Operator&#x27;s Certificate II. From 1975 to 1984 he worked as a cameraman at ABC Television in Gore Hill, including work on &quot;The Marcia Hines Show&quot;, &quot;Farnham and Byrne&quot; (see John Farnham, Debra Byrne), &quot;Mastermind&quot;, &quot;Parkinson&quot;, &quot;The Norman Gunston Show&quot; and &quot;Play School&quot; as well as news and current affairs programs. During the early 1970s he played in &quot;garage band after garage band&quot; and by mid-decade was in a rock group, Arnhem, which toured the east coast of Australia.

In November 1978, at the age of 23, Bullock became a committed Christian. He said that &quot;it was in that real charismatic, pentecostal awakening that was happening... I grew up with a bunch of teenagers and they started getting saved into what has become the Hillsong Church and eventually I went along and that was it.&quot; He was on the team, led by Brian Houston, that pioneered the Hills Christian Life Centre (later part of Hillsong Church) in August 1983. Aside from Bullock and Houston the initial pastors were Pat Mesiti, Mike Murphy, Donna Quinn and Michael Smith. Bullock was appointed the worship pastor for Hillsong Church in Sydney and was the convenor of their annual conferences from 1987 to 1995. Tanya Levin described him in her book &quot;People in Glass Houses: An insider&#x27;s story of a life in and out of Hillsong&quot; (2007) writing that &quot;[he] was our Piano Man. Short and stock, with blue eyes that pierced you like laser beams.&quot;

Bullock was a pastor at the Hillsong Conference in July 1995. He left Hillsong Church in October that year. In August 2004 he told David Adams and Lloyd Harkness of &quot;Sight&quot; magazine, &quot;I burnt out, I suppose. At the time I was so convinced that God was asking me to leave and (now) I’m just not so sure... I just knew I had to go and I think, in a way, it was escaping a damaging spirituality that I&#x27;d allowed to happen. I don&#x27;t want to blame those guys for it – it was my problem. Now I have become a very different person and so you can see that there was a divergence of style and theology and concept that came from it.&quot;

During Bullock&#x27;s time at Hillsong Church, six albums were recorded and released by Hillsong Music for which he wrote many songs, including &quot;The Power of Your Love&quot;, &quot;Refresh My Heart&quot; (both July 1992), &quot;Have Faith in God&quot;, &quot;You Rescued Me&quot; (both July 1994), &quot;I Will Never Be the Same Again&quot; (1996) and &quot;This Kingdom&quot; (July 1995). He co-produced some of the albums with Russell Fragar and / or Darlene Zschech. He also wrote articles for various religious journals.

In 2006 Angelica Del Vasto of &quot;Worship Leader Magazine&quot; wrote about Bullock&#x27;s song &quot;The Power of Your Love&quot; that it &quot;encompasses the listener with... the empowering conviction that the Creator of the universe has done, and is doing, everything to convey His love to us. It compels us to face our own weaknesses and then fall into the arms of God.&quot; She noted that the &quot;musical feel of the song [is due] to the use of minor chords to break up the major chords, a typical approach in his writing.&quot; Bullock acknowledged its influence on his later life, saying &quot;so many of the songs that I had written [earlier] were given new meaning as I had to live out their inspiration. It is far easier writing a song than having to live out its words.&quot;

In January 1997 Bullock released the solo album &quot;You Rescued Me: The First Ten Years Anthology 1987-1997&quot;, a double CD album on the Breedon Hill Music label which collected his works written while a member of Hillsong. In 1998 he issued &quot;Hands of Grace – Face to Face Worship&quot; on the Kingsway label, of which &quot;Cross Rhythms&quot;″ Trevor Kirk said that &quot;[his] recent work has noticeably veered toward the middle of the road. This project goes further, and infringes on the ambient. Loads of swirling synths and elaborate (and lengthy) arrangements.&quot; Bullock also wrote his first book, &quot;Hands of grace: Jesus, God&#x27;s symphony of hope&quot;, printed by Strand Publishing, in 1998. His album &quot;A Symphony of Hope&quot; was released on 21 May 1999, which was recorded with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and has Paul Terracini as conductor and arranger. It had been recorded in Prague on Good Friday and included two tracks written by Terracini.

In 2000 Bullock&#x27;s second book, &quot;Power of your love: Jesus: the unexpected God&quot;, was published. It was followed in early 2001 by another album, &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;, of which Jennifer Brooker of &quot;Cross Rhythms&quot; said that it had a &quot;broad rich sound, immaculately produced; some numbers are arranged for full symphony orchestra&quot; although she also wrote that &quot;Shame the songs aren&#x27;t more memorable, anyone looking for another &#x27;Power of Your Love&#x27; won&#x27;t find it.&quot; In October 2008 Bullock reflected on his songs, saying that they are &quot;about worship, but worship is an entirely different thing. It is a bit like love songs. Love songs aren’t love, they are songs about love. I think worship is far more your response and your meditation and being confronted by what it means to receive grace and forgiveness from God.&quot;

On 22 August 2011 Bullock issued a triple CD compilation album, &quot;The Power of Your Love – The Songs of Geoff Bullock&quot;. He has said about his later work, &quot;All my songs and my whole spiritual journey since [Hillsong] is all about what God has done for me, rather than what I would like to do.&quot;

He was interviewed in 2021 podcast of &quot;I was a teenage fundamentalist&quot; about his faith and his time at Hillsong.

== Personal life ==

Bullock married Janine (born c. 1957, Lithgow) in 1980 and the couple had five children within a decade. Janine was choir master on some of Hillsong Music&#x27;s releases, including &quot;Friends in High Places&quot; (July 1995). The marriage broke down in 1996 and he later recalled that &quot;It was over before I knew it. I was just too busy to even notice what was happening. People say, &#x27;Weren&#x27;t there signs?&#x27; Of course there were signs. But we just thought OK, we&#x27;ll just have to work harder – serve God harder – we&#x27;ll do more for God and he will bless us. We separated within weeks of leaving Hills. It was a very hard time and it got worse as the months went on. I had to face the fact of my failure as a husband and a father.&quot;

Bullock&#x27;s second wife is Victoria, They have raised her two children from a previous marriage.

Bullock has described his mental health issues, including &quot;episodes of mania&quot; and &quot;long periods of depression&quot;. In 2003 he was diagnosed as having bipolar II disorder. In September 2010 he told Terry Allen of Christian Faith website of his condition, &quot;[It] has caused all manner of symptoms in my life which has been confronting. One of the main ones being high levels of anxiety, which has seen me come and go publicly three times. I am now 10 years on and I feel the illness is manageable and the greatest gift, I think, is that I have been forced to learn insight into the way I think and the way that I do. I have learnt that by reflection on my past.&quot;

Geoff Bullock is now retired (since 2016) and lives on Scotland Island.

In December 2009 he was elected a Chairman of the Waitangi National Trust Board, replacing Jeremy Williams. Paraone has been on the board of the Waitangi National Trust since 1997.

In 2014, Paraone was re-elected as a New Zealand First list MP and was his party spokesperson on Māori Affairs, Treaty of Waitangi Issues, Pacific Island Affairs, and the Office of Treaty Settlements. At the 2017 election however, Paraone was ranked 11th on the New Zealand First list and was not returned to Parliament. Paraone publicly encouraged his party to support the formation of Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand. He was appointed chair of the Local Government Commission in November 2018 and held this appointment until his death.

==Death==
Paraone died in Auckland on 26 August 2019. He had undergone cardiac surgery just three weeks prior, but had failed to recover. The incumbent Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Winston Peters, offered his condolences, stating that he was &quot;deeply saddened&quot; by the death.

<text>Malcolm Ian Macdonald (born 7 January 1950) is an English former professional footballer, manager and media figure. Nicknamed &quot;Supermac&quot;, Macdonald was a quick, powerfully built and prolific goalscorer. He played for Fulham, Luton Town, Newcastle United, Arsenal and England. Macdonald is Newcastle&#x27;s fifth-highest goalscorer of all time. He was top scorer in the English First Division with Newcastle in 1975 and with Arsenal in 1977.

==Club career==

===Early years and Fulham===
Born in Finlay Street, Fulham, Macdonald attended the same school (Sloane Grammar school on Hortensia Rd in Chelsea) as former Genesis and GTR guitarist Steve Hackett. Macdonald started his career as a full back before switching to centre forward. He started his career at Barnet. After playing for non-league side Tonbridge, his schoolboy hero Bobby Robson paid £1,000 to sign him for Fulham in 1968 just after their relegation from the Football League First Division.

===Luton Town===
A year later, Macdonald moved to Luton Town. At Luton he scored 58 times in 101 matches.

===Newcastle United===
Newcastle United manager Joe Harvey signed Macdonald for £180,000 in the summer of 1971. He made an immediate impact by scoring a hat-trick on his home debut against Liverpool. It was in this game that MacDonald earned the nickname &quot;Supermac&quot;, which came from a chant by the Newcastle fans to the tune of &quot;Superstar&quot; from &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, namely, &quot;Supermac, superstar, how many goals have you scored so far?&quot;

In his first season Newcastle were bottom of the table on 30 October 1971 after Everton handed them their fifth consecutive defeat of the season. That match was the Newcastle debut of Tony Green. With Green and Macdonald teaming up effectively up front for Newcastle, the team prospered, with an unbeaten run of five wins and two draws, climbing up the table. They finished the league eleventh, with Macdonald scoring 30 goals in 52 games in his first season to be Newcastle&#x27;s top scorer in 1972. He top scored again in 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976. He was also the First Division&#x27;s top scorer for that 1975–76 season.

Macdonald scored twice, defeating Burnley in the 1973–74 FA Cup semi-final. In the 1974 FA Cup final, Newcastle lost 3–0 to Liverpool.

Macdonald set up an equalising goal for Alan Gowling in the 1976 League Cup final at Wembley, but Newcastle went on to lose 2–1 to Manchester City.

===Arsenal===
Macdonald left Newcastle for Arsenal in 1976, for an unusual fee of £333,333.34. In December 1976, he scored a hat-trick for his new club against Newcastle in a 5–3 win at Highbury. He was the club&#x27;s top scorer for two consecutive seasons and was the top scorer for the First Division in 1977. Macdonald, at the time not fully fit, got to the FA Cup final of 1978 after scoring twice in the semi-final against Orient at Stamford Bridge. He earned a runners-up medal in the final after a 1–0 defeat to Ipswich Town. At the start of the 1978–79 season, he suffered a knee injury in a League Cup match against Rotherham, an injury from which he was unable to completely recover.

=== South Melbourne Hellas ===
After completing the English First Division season with Arsenal, Macdonald was lured to Australia in 1977 to play for South Melbourne Hellas in the National Soccer League. 

He played three games during the middle of the 1977 National Soccer League season, scoring on his debut against West Adelaide, playing at home against Brisbane Lions and most notably scoring twice against St George (who fielded former Arsenal star Charlie George), which drew a capacity crowd to Middle Park, providing a rare high point to an otherwise poor season for Hellas. 

=== Djurgården ===
Macdonald spent a couple of months in Sweden with Djurgården, after which he announced his retirement from playing at the premature age of 29 in August 1979. In his footballing career, Macdonald scored a total of 193 goals.

==International career==
While at Newcastle, he made his England debut against Wales at Wembley Stadium. Macdonald was on the England scoresheet for the first time in a friendly 2–0 win over then World Champions West Germany.

On 16 April 1975, in a European Championship qualifier also held at Wembley Stadium, Macdonald scored all five goals in a 5–0 victory for England against Cyprus equalling the record for the most goals scored in a single game by an England player. This feat has not been repeated since by any English footballer. Although three pre-war players, Howard Vaughton, Steve Bloomer and Willie Hall, had previously scored five for England, Macdonald was the first, and remains the only, player to do so in a competitive international. His feat spawned the newspaper headline &quot;SuperMac 5, Cyprus 0&quot;.

In total he played 14 times for England scoring six goals.

==Managerial career==
After retirement from playing, Macdonald returned to Fulham as a manager in 1980. His time at Craven Cottage was initially successful, with promotion to the Second Division being achieved in 1982.

In the 1982–83 season, they appeared certainties for promotion to the First Division for the majority of the season, but a slump in the later stages of the season allowed their lead to wither away and they finished 4th. The following season began as a struggle before a second half turnaround saw them into mid-table safety, with Macdonald, even before the season&#x27;s end leaving the club in April 1984.

He returned to management at Huddersfield Town in 1987, but his time in charge proved unfruitful as the side were relegated from the Second Division in dismal fashion, including a 10–1 defeat to Manchester City.

, Macdonald is the president of North Shields F.C.

==Media career==
Macdonald appeared on the TV show &quot;Superstars&quot; in 1975, where he ran 100m in 10.9 seconds.

Macdonald worked extensively for Real Radio North East, presenting, firstly in 2000, the &quot;Legends Football Phone-In&quot;, alongside Bernie Slaven and Micky Horswill. At the end of the 2011–12 season the programme was axed from Real Radio and then made its way upon Star Radio North East, so continuing in a similar format until 2014. Macdonald also presented an interview series for the Century Radio Network titled &quot;Upfront With Malcolm Macdonald&quot;, in which he talked to famous players such as Ian Wright, Joe Royle and Peter Beardsley among others.

He also writes a regular column for the retro football magazine &quot;Backpass&quot;.

In 2011, Macdonald was strongly critical of Newcastle United&#x27;s decision to change their stadium name from St James&#x27; Park to the Sports Direct Arena. Macdonald said: &quot;It seems antagonistic. It&#x27;s not only part of the football club&#x27;s heritage, but part of the heritage of the city.&quot;

==Outside football==
After a failed business venture and divorcing his second wife, he struggled with the aftermath of his injury. Macdonald said that the pain from his long-standing knee injury led to an increasing dependence on alcohol. He eventually gave up drinking in 1997.

Macdonald is married to Carol, the former wife of Brian Johnson.

<doc id="1075944" wikidata="Q333507" url="?curid=1075944" title="Malcolm MacDonald">
<text>Malcolm John MacDonald (17 August 1901 – 11 January 1981) was a British politician and diplomat. He was initially a Labour Member of Parliament (MP), but in 1931 followed his father Ramsay MacDonald in breaking with the party and joining the National Government. He was consequently expelled from the Labour Party. He was a government minister during the Second World War and was later Governor of Kenya.

MacDonald&#x27;s experience allowed him to take a unique approach to the decolonisation of British colonies in Asia and Africa. He had &quot;done more for Southeast Asia than perhaps any other living person,&quot; according to Harold Macmillan, who also said that &quot;not only Asia, but the whole Western World were indeed grateful to him.&quot; Making imperial control obsolete was his life&#x27;s work, according former Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal. In 1957, he helped Malaya and Singapore get independence as Governor-General and Commissioner-General of Southeast Asia, respectively. In 1963, he helped Kenya achieve independence.

MacDonald served as High Commissioner to Brunei from 1946 to 1948 and as the Commissioner-General in Southeast Asia until 1955, played a significant role in Brunei’s modern history. Despite leaving office, he continued to visit Brunei on official business until 1979, meeting with Sultans Ahmad Tajuddin, Omar Ali Saifuddien III, and Hassanal Bolkiah, and developed a deep affection for Malaya and British Borneo. Unlike traditional colonial ambassadors, he approached local authorities with compassion and empathy, often demonstrating more respect than his London superiors preferred. His amiable relationship with Omar Ali reflected his strategy of &quot;gentle persuasion,&quot; which, while not always successful in advancing Brunei toward federation, ensured a lasting connection leveraged by the British government, despite sometimes hindering democratic reforms advocated by his colleagues.

==Early life and education==
Malcolm John MacDonald, the second son of future Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and Margaret MacDonald&#x27;s six siblings, was born in Lossiemouth on 17 August 1901. Alister, his older sister, was born in 1899, while Ishbel, Davis, and Sheila Lochhead, his three younger siblings, were born in 1903, 1904, and 1910, respectively. He had a peaceful, natural life in Lossiemouth with his family, which served as inspiration for his poetry. He documented his observations of 252 bird species in the Moray Firth and its environs in his first book, &quot;Birdwatching in Lossiemouth&quot;. Margaret, the mother of Malcolm, was active in the Women&#x27;s Industrial Council and the National Union of Women Workers, having grown up in a community-focused setting. He was deeply affected by the death of his mother in 1911 when he was ten years old since his parents had taught him the importance of genuine friendship and community duty.

Educated at Bedales School and earned his degrees in economics and history from Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. He was involved in debating competitions and represented the United Kingdom in conferences held in Honolulu in 1927 and Kyoto in 1929 under the auspices of the Institute of Pacific Relations.

==Political career==
After being elected as a Labor Member of Parliament in the 1929 general election, he backed his father in 1931, just before financial strains caused the Labor Government to collapse. At thirty-four, he was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1935, making him the youngest Cabinet member. As Winston Churchill war cabinet&#x27;s Minister of Health during the World War II, he oversaw the mass evacuation of children from London in order to protect them from German air strikes.

Though there were rumours that MacDonald would be removed from his role as Minister of Health when Winston Churchill established a coalition government, he remained in that role in May 1940. Later, in June 1940, he was dispatched to Dublin to negotiate with Éamon de Valera, proposing to terminate Ireland&#x27;s Partition in return for Ireland&#x27;s involvement in the war. However, de Valera turned down the offer and went in search of weaponry, which the British government refused to provide.

From 1941 to 1946, MacDonald held the post of High Commissioner to Canada, which is akin to an ambassador in diplomatic ties between Commonwealth nations. In accordance with the Alexander Carr-Saunders Commission Report, he signed the bill creating the University of Malaya in 1949. From 1949 to 1961, he presided over the institution as its first Chancellor, assisted by George Vance Allen as the first Vice-Chancellor and Onn Jaafar as one of his Pro-Chancellors. He assumed significant duties throughout Asia with his appointment as Governor-General of Malaya, Singapore, and Borneo following the war. After serving as the High Commissioner in India from 1955 to 1960, he was named chairman of an international conference in Laos. He was instrumental in the founding of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in 1955.

MacDonald later concentrated on serving in Africa, holding positions as High Commissioner to Kenya from 1964 to 1965 as well as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Kenya. Additionally, he participated in a number of diplomatic trips to Nigeria and Rhodesia, among other countries in Africa. He was appointed as the Special Representative to many African Commonwealth nations until his retirement in 1969. Zhou Enlai allegedly hailed him as &quot;the only capitalist we can trust&quot; when on a visit to China.

=== MacDonald White Paper ===
In 1939, MacDonald oversaw and introduced the so-called MacDonald White Paper which aimed at the creation of a unified state in Palestine, with controls on Jewish immigration. The White Paper argued that since over 450,000 Jews had been settled in the Mandate, the terms of the Balfour Declaration had now been met and that an independent Jewish state should not be established. When the White Paper was debated in Parliament on 22–23 May 1939, many politicians objected to its central recommendations. Churchill noted, &#x27;&quot;After the period of five years no further Jewish immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it&quot;. Now, there is the breach; there is the violation of the pledge; there is the abandonment of the Balfour Declaration; there is the end of the vision, of the hope, of the dream.&#x27; The outbreak of the Second World War suspended any further deliberations. 

Opponents of the White Paper pointed out that Jews were suffering from oppression by the Nazi regimes in Germany and Austria but, given that most states, including the United States and Canada, did not accept Jewish refugees, had nowhere other than Palestine to which to emigrate. In a UK Parliamentary debate, David Lloyd George called the White Paper &quot;an act of perfidy.&quot;

In a leader, the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; called it &quot;a death sentence on tens of thousands of Central European Jews&quot;, and the Liberal MP James Rothschild stated during the parliamentary debate that &quot;for the majority of the Jews who go to Palestine it is a question of migration or of physical extinction&quot;.

=== Diplomacy with Brunei ===
Churchill&#x27;s war cabinet planned to unify Malaya and the British Borneo territories and resign afterward, with the goal of securing victory for the Allies in 1944. Part of the reason MacDonald was appointed to a position in Southeast Asia just after the Malayan Union proposal failed was because the Malay community there opposed the Sultans&#x27; ceding of their authority to the British Crown. He warned his government not to interfere in Brunei&#x27;s domestic issues, fearing that similar feelings may emerge there.

Despite its modest size, Brunei was considered a valuable asset for federation plans due to its sudden wealth from the 1929 oil discovery, which was seen as essential for developing a balanced economy in a bigger state in North Borneo. MacDonald promoted a loose federation model that suggested a three states, one country solution, although he also favoured maintaining Brunei&#x27;s sovereignty. He opposed changing the 1905–1906 Supplementary Treaty and recommended the Colonial Office not to associate Brunei with North Borneo or Sarawak as the deadline of 1 July 1946, for the restoration of civilian administration drew near. Rather, he suggested administratively uniting Brunei with a nearby colony without undermining its constitutional standing; as a result, Brunei came under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Sarawak as High Commissioner on 1 May 1948.

Then-Colonial Secretary MacDonald was aware of Brunei&#x27;s problems in 1940, such as the Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin&#x27;s postponed official coronation, which he approved despite reports that British Resident John Graham Black was to blame for the delays. Historian Robert Reece calls MacDonald&#x27;s writings about the Ahmad Tajuddin, &quot;scurrilous,&quot; yet the Sultan was ahead of his time in advocating for more political and financial independence. In his capacities as High Commissioner to Brunei and Governor-General of Malaya, he first visited Brunei on 15 July 1946, and there he experienced nationalist emotions.

MacDonald had to reassure Ahmad Tajuddin during a visit in July 1947 that administrative adjustments would be the only changes brought about by a planned union between Sarawak and Brunei; Brunei would not be merged into the Crown Colony of Sarawak. In September 1949, after the Sultan&#x27;s unwillingness to attend the festivities owing to delays in the completion of his new palace, he returned to Brunei in his capacity as the British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia. After being eventually convinced by Abang Haji Mustapha, the Malay chief of Sarawak, the Sultan attended, was knighted by King George VI, and conveyed his thanks and concerns in a way that MacDonald described as both diplomatically savvy and comically cunning.

When Ahmad Tajuddin and MacDonald finally met, he was traveling to England to renegotiate the 1959 Agreement and oil royalties. The meeting took place at MacDonald&#x27;s home in Singapore. In addition to suggesting that Joseph Conrad&#x27;s Outcast of the Islands be filmed in Brunei, he also pitched a movie on the Sultan, who was well-known for his passion for movies to film director Carol Reed. But soon after the sudden death of the Sultan in 1950, he had to step in and approve the nomination of Omar Ali Saifuddien III, the younger brother of the deceased Sultan, to succeed him.

The British administration&#x27;s accession to the Brunei monarchy was mostly uneventful, but for the obstacle Gerard MacBryan presented. He asserted that the late Ahmad Tajuddin had given him permission to represent his interests. MacBryan had been hired as a political consultant on international matters by the Sultan, with responsibility for negotiating Brunei&#x27;s oil interests with Standard Oil and fighting for the Sultan&#x27;s rights in the United States. But MacBryan&#x27;s ambitions to use his relationship with Ahmad Tajuddin to achieve substantial power were dashed, and his attempt to establish himself as Brunei&#x27;s de facto ruler was quickly abandoned. Despite MacBryan&#x27;s obviously genuine allegations, MacDonald handled the succession crisis by persuading London that MacBryan was nothing more than a scam. He expressed his admiration for Omar Ali Saifuddien III during the new Sultan&#x27;s coronation, stating that he believed he was the best option for Brunei and for fostering closer connections with Britain.

Given that the new Sultan had worked with the British on plans for Brunei and its neighbours, including the 1948 administrative unification of Sarawak and Brunei, MacDonald&#x27;s support for him was calculated. Tensions resulted from local discontent with Sarawak&#x27;s administrative power, even though Omar Ali had initially supported the unification. Historians speculate that Omar Ali eventual resistance to the merger is a reflection of a frequent strategy used by Bruneian Sultans to survive when facing stronger imperial powers.

Records from the British Colonial Office may not always demonstrate MacDonald&#x27;s sincerity in his devotion to Brunei and Omar Ali, necessitating a closer examination of the parties concerned. An important episode that embarrassed him was when, soon after his rise, Omar Ali openly reaffirmed Brunei&#x27;s claim to disputed territory. MacDonald intervened to recast the event, saying it was an error and clearing the Sultan of any culpability, in order to lessen the diplomatic impact and save both the Sultan and British interests. The episode brought to light Sultan&#x27;s long-standing resentment over Brunei&#x27;s lost territory, particularly Labuan Island and Limbang. He publicly disagreed with Sarawak&#x27;s authority and continued to bring up the matter through British diplomatic channels in spite of the passing of time.

In order to further his vision of a federation of the three British provinces in North Borneo, MacDonald had to negotiate his relationship with the newly ascendant Omar Ali. Conflicting interests, especially the Sultan&#x27;s, caused the federation plan to collapse despite MacDonald&#x27;s best efforts; it only became reality as the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, excluding Brunei. With the establishment of the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia in 1948 to supervise communications, defence, and regional development and provide guidance on deeper political integration, British policy sought to promote cooperation among its Southeast Asian holdings, centred around Singapore.

As the initial Commissioner-General, MacDonald vigorously worked toward the establishment of an independent Dominion that included the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo, and Brunei. In order to accomplish his goal of a political federation of Borneo territories ultimately integrating with Malaya, he put cooperative departments, frequent conferences, and officer exchanges into practice. Omar Ali dismissed conjectures on a possible federation, highlighting Brunei&#x27;s independence and sensitivity. The Secretary of State counselled MacDonald to move gradually and refrain from imposing an external federation, letting Brunei become self-governing.

Brunei&#x27;s unwillingness to join a federation that challenged its sovereignty and would potentially dilute its oil wealth was a major factor in the Federation ideas&#x27; failure. Tensions were increased when Brunei refused to share its resources for the development of less developed bordering regions, leading to the Sarawak–Brunei administrative union in 1948. The notion of federation was abandoned in spite of MacDonald&#x27;s efforts and diplomatic endeavours due to his lack of governmental authority and the shifting political climate in Britain, which included Malaya&#x27;s independence movement and changes in British policy. After receiving a warm reception in Brunei and attending important royal ceremonies, his vision began to wane as new political realities surfaced.

Omar Ali gave MacDonald a cordial welcome, but turned down his request for money to help North Borneo. This decision was made in light of Brunei&#x27;s recent $100 million loan to the Malaysian Federation and its unwillingness to support its close neighbours. Disappointed, the Sarawak and North Borneo governors turned their backs on Brunei and concentrated on fortifying their own relationships. When he visited the Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque in December 1958, he was allowed into the Sultan&#x27;s private rooms, where they talked about the possibility of Brunei&#x27;s royal children receiving an education in England. The Raja Isteri Damit&#x27;s unwillingness to part from the children (Princes Hassanal Bolkiah and Mohamed Bolkiah) caused this arrangement, which had been decided upon beforehand, to be abandoned; the kids were thereafter enrolled in a Kuala Lumpur school. British authorities saw this change in education as Omar Ali&#x27;s desire to maintain his ties to Malaya.

British authorities criticised MacDonald for deceiving the Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman about a possible super federation combining Malaya, Singapore, and the Borneo territories during talks with the Sultan of Brunei and Malayan Prime Minister. Omar Ali became concerned about this and in July 1963 rejected the idea for Malaysian Federation, therefore proving his independence and upsetting the objectives of its main proponents. Despite his support for Malaysia, MacDonald was wary of pressuring Brunei, Sarawak, or North Borneo to join, and cautioned the British against putting more pressure on Brunei following Omar Ali&#x27;s denial.

Following his retirement from government employment in July 1969, Harold Wilson&#x27;s administration named MacDonald as a traveling envoy, allowing him to carry on serving Britain&#x27;s interests by resolving diplomatic disputes between the United Kingdom and Brunei. Omar Ali, a close friend of his, stepped down from the Sultan in 1967 but continued to have influence. 1967 constitutional negotiations in London were tense because of a disagreement between the Sultan and Secretary of State Herbert Bowden, who had little regard for the monarch. MacDonald criticised Bowden for his contemptuous behaviour toward the retired Sultan.

Early in 1968, when the new British High Commissioner-designate Arthur Adair was rejected by Omar Ali and the Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, MacDonald was asked to mediate a diplomatic deadlock between Brunei and Britain. The discussions between the United Kingdom and Brunei had come to a standstill for over half a year. After visiting the Brunei palace and learning about Omar Ali&#x27;s complaints, he admitted that the ex-Sultan had not received proper treatment on his last trip to London. He also concurred that by moving the previous High Commissioner without first informing the Sultan, Britain could have violated the terms of the 1959 Agreement. By means of delicate diplomatic manoeuvres, MacDonald managed to win back the trust of the former Sultan and facilitate the restoration of regular ties between the two countries.

MacDonald was instrumental in handling the sensitive issue in reaction to Britain&#x27;s decision to remove its soldiers from Brunei&#x27;s protectorate status by December 1970. He recommended against hastening the notification of troop departure because he was aware of the prospective consequences, which included Brunei&#x27;s potential economic reprisal and the termination of British diplomatic ties. Because of his effective negotiating, the negotiations were postponed and Frank Webber was temporarily reinstated, facilitating a more seamless introduction of Adair to the Sultan. In contrast to people like Anthony Abell, who aimed to modernise Brunei&#x27;s political system, MacDonald concentrated on preserving stability and appeasing the authoritarian inclinations of Omar Ali. This was in contrast to other British officials who were working for democratic reforms in Brunei.

During significant political changes, MacDonald played a crucial role in upholding Brunei&#x27;s independence and the Sultan&#x27;s right to reign. In contrast to Brunei&#x27;s democratic reformers such as Abell, he supported Omar Ali&#x27;s opposition to reform, upholding the Sultan&#x27;s power and opposing ideas such as the Federation of North Borneo and Malaysia. MacDonald, honouring the Sultan&#x27;s desires, successfully postponed Brunei&#x27;s soldier pullout until 1971 in order to prevent instability in the area, even though Britain had intended to remove its troops and abolish Brunei&#x27;s protectorate status by 1970. His efforts eventually resulted in a change of leadership in Britain, which paved the way for a revised 1971 deal that gave Brunei complete internal self-government along with continuous British defence backing.

Despite difficulties brought on by Omar Ali&#x27;s intransigence and Malaysia&#x27;s covert assistance for Brunei&#x27;s former rebels, MacDonald remained an important figure in Brunei&#x27;s affairs under Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. He revived his prior proposal in 1968 and 1974 for a federation of the three northern Borneo states, headed nominally by the Sultan of Brunei. This concept was in stark contrast to Bruneian and British authorities&#x27; antiquated and impossible ideal of a unified &quot;Kalimantan Utara,&quot; which it mimicked. In the end, the idea was rejected as impractical since the Sultan was against being a member of such a federation.

MacDonald persisted in supporting the notion of a looser federation between Brunei and Malaysia despite Brunei&#x27;s choice to avoid Malaysia, acknowledging the potential for eventual economic and cultural similarities to bring the two countries together. Although he thought Brunei would eventually have to join Malaysia, he was against Malaysia having any kind of power over the Sultanate. He cautioned Brunei against being forced to consider a merger and urged against it. His participation at Raja Isteri Damit&#x27;s burial on his last visit to Brunei in 1979 demonstrated the close personal relationships he had formed over the years. He never had the chance to meet Omar Ali and Hassanal Bolkiah in person, but he kept in regular connection with both of them.

=== Malayan Emergency and headhunting scandal ===

During the late 1940s and early 1950s, MacDonald suggested combining Sabah, Sarawak, Singapore, Brunei, and Malaya into a single region known as &quot;Malaya Raya.&quot; He tried to push for this larger federation and had talks with influential people like Onn Jaafar, but the Borneo territories did not embrace the idea, therefore it did not take off. Right up to his relocation to India in 1955, MacDonald kept up his advocacy for the notion of Malaysia. Lord Brassey had proposed in 1887 to unite Malaya, Singapore, and Borneo; he brought this notion back to life. The Borneo provinces&#x27; lack of support prevented the initiative from gaining pace, despite his best efforts.

In 1952, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; published photographs of atrocities committed by Iban mercenaries in the Malayan Emergency, including headhunting and scalping. MacDonald, who had facilitated the deployment of these mercenaries and had previously praised them, became embroiled in the resulting British Malayan headhunting scandal, which featured a controversial photo of him welcoming Iban headhunters. During the Malayan Emergency, he had toured Malaya with American politicians, during which he showcased Ibans to the Americans. Living in Iban settlements, he had many interactions with Ibans and once called an experienced Iban headhunter &quot;one of the greatest men I had ever met&quot;. J. R. Campbell had previously been involved in the political careers of the MacDonald family as he had inadvertantly contibuted to the collapse of the Labour government following the 1924 Campbell Case.

==Later life and death==

After retiring, MacDonald became the President of Overseas Voluntary Service and the Chancellor of Durham University from 1971 to 1980.

MacDonald died on 11 January 1981, at the age of 79. According to his family&#x27;s account to the British Press Association, he died in the grounds of his house close to Sevenoaks, Kent. Medical report is awaited to determine the cause of death. At the time of his death, his wife was on vacation in Canada. His personal collection of significant historical records on the nations he visited, notably Malaysia, is currently held at the National Museum of Singapore, Singapore, Durham University Library, Asian Art Museum, and University of Malaya.

On 9 May 2015, his widow Audrey died of natural causes in Ottawa at the age of 99 years old, three weeks before her 100th birthday.
==Personal life==
MacDonald was a keen ornithologist and, in 1934, published the book &quot;Bird Watching at Lossiemouth&quot; privately. It was, as he noted, in a brief foreword, an expanded version of a paper he read to the London Morayshire Club one evening in the autumn of 1933.

While High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Canada, MacDonald undertook two extensive journeys, in a Grumman Goose, from Ottawa to the far northwest of Canada. He was accompanied by three senior Government officials, in August 1942 and March 1943. He chronicled the trips in a book, &quot;Down North&quot; (Oxford University Press, Toronto, 1943). The trips covered remote areas of Alberta, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon and British Columbia, going as far north as Aklavik. MacDonald&#x27;s book gives a perspective of the history, geography and peoples of Canada&#x27;s northwest.

MacDonald was a prolific art collector in a range of genres, most notably Chinese ceramics. He sold and donated art collections to museums across the world. His Chinese ceramic collections comprise a total of over 500 pieces with a chronological span of 2000 BCE to circa 1940 CE and incorporating representative examples of most styles of domestic and export ceramic wares. These collections are today split between the Durham University Oriental Museum, the Museum of Asian Art, Kuala Lumpur and the NUS Museum in Singapore.

MacDonald married Andrey Marjorie Rowley in December 1946, and they had a daughter called Fiona. Bill and Jane Rowley are the two adoptive children Malcolm MacDonald had from his first marriage.

==Other works==
The painstakingly gathered records of MacDonald&#x27;s travels and career were originally kept in storage at the Royal Commonwealth Society. His family made the decision to give the collection to the University of Durham so that it may be preserved and used for study after his passing. His sister Sheila Lochhead, Durham University librarian A. M. McAulay, and Royal Commonwealth Society librarian D. H. Simpson contributed the collection, which is arranged chronologically and divided into official tasks, correspondence, and personal documents.

The University of Durham&#x27;s MacDonald collection is among the Islamic and Malay World manuscripts that Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA) was entrusted by the Ministry of Education in 2019 to digitise. In keeping with the advances of the digital age, thirty thousand sheets of his records were digitised and uploaded to the UniSZA e-Manuscript System. Under the direction of the Research Institute for Products and Islamic Civilisation (INSPIRE), the initiative aims to preserve and study his personal notes, official papers, photos, and letters pertaining to important historical events in Malaya.

He was an avid birdwatcher and wrote books about his observations on birds.

He authored the following published works:
* 
*

* 
* 
* &quot;Constant Surprise&quot; (unpublished autobiography – held at Durham University Library Archives)

==Honours==
MacDonald rejected titles and medals despite his lengthy service to Labor and Conservative governments until receiving the Order of Merit in 1969. The Order is limited to 24 individuals, most of whom are in the arts and sciences. It is known that he has received many honours:
* Order of Merit (OM)
* Honorary Fellow at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford
* Honorary Doctor of Law and Honorary Doctor of Letters (Durham) Freeman, City of Singapore
* Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University (1973)
* Freeman, Burgh of Lossiemouth

<text>James Leonard Peters (born 1937) is a New Zealand educator and politician. Born in Kawakawa, he is of Ngāti Wai and Clan McInnes descent.

He went to school at Whananaki Primary and Wesley College in Auckland. Further education followed at the University of Auckland (BA in History and Political Studies) and Auckland Teachers Training College (Diploma of Teaching).

He is a member of the New Zealand First party, which is led by his younger brother Winston Peters. Jim Peters entered Parliament as a list MP in the 2002 election, having previously served as the Chairperson on the Northland Regional Council. Before entering politics he was a high school teacher. Formerly he was HOD History, Geography and Social Studies at Mount Albert Grammar School. From 1987 to mid-2002 he was Principal of Northland College in Kaikohe. He lost his list seat in the 2005 election after New Zealand First&#x27;s share of the party vote declined from its 2002 result. He was appointed Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Maori) of the University of Auckland in 2006.

In February 2008 he could have re-entered Parliament as a New Zealand First list MP after the resignation of Brian Donnelly, but stood aside in favour of Dail Jones.

In the 2008 New Year Honours, Peters was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to local-body affairs, education, and the community.

Three members of his family, the others being his brothers Ian Peters and Winston Peters, have been Members of Parliament in New Zealand. Another brother, Ron Peters, stood for New Zealand First in Hobson in 1993, coming third; and for Northland in 1996, coming second.

<doc id="1075950" wikidata="Q320238" url="?curid=1075950" title="Pinova">
<text>&#x27;Pinova&#x27; is a German apple cultivar. It was created in 1965 at the Institut für Obstforschung of Dresden–Pillnitz in Saxony which at that time was in the German Democratic Republic. After Germany was re-united in 1990, the rights to the cultivar passed to the Free State of Saxony.

&#x27;Pinova&#x27; is a hybrid between &#x27;Clivia&#x27; and &#x27;Golden Delicious&#x27;. &#x27;Clivia&#x27; is a hybrid of &#x27;Geheimrat Dr. Oldenburg&#x27; and &#x27;Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin&#x27;. &#x27;Pinova&#x27; may also be called &#x27;Corail&#x27;, Piñata® or &#x27;Sonata&#x27;.

== Characteristics ==
&#x27;Pinova&#x27; has a high fruit yield, with little tendency towards biennial bearing; it has good resistance to scab and is a good pollenizer for many varieties. The fruit stores well. It is juicy and crisp, and has some of the taste of Cox&#x27;s, the coloration of Oldenburg and the shape of &#x27;Golden Delicious&#x27;. The fruit is picked early in October.

&#x27;Pinova&#x27; is planted commercially in Europe. In the United States it is patented, and may be sold under the brand-name &quot;Piñata&quot;.

<text>Fennoscandia (Finnish, Swedish and ; ), or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is a peninsula in Europe which includes the Scandinavian and Kola peninsulas, mainland Finland, and Karelia. Administratively, this roughly encompasses the mainlands of Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia, and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia.

Its name comes from the Latin words &quot;Fennia&quot; (Finland) and &quot;Scandia&quot; (Scandinavia). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898.

Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to adjacent areas in Europe.

The similar term Fenno-Scandinavia is sometimes used for Fennoscandia. Both terms are sometimes used in English to refer to a cultural or political grouping of Finland with Sweden, Norway and Denmark (the latter country is closely connected culturally and politically, but is not part of the Fennoscandian Peninsula), which is a subset of the Nordic countries.

<text>Matthew Peter Robson (born 5 January 1950) is a New Zealand politician. He was deputy leader of the Progressive Party, and served in the Parliament from 1996 to 2005, first as a member of the Alliance, then as a Progressive.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Robson was born in Brisbane, Australia. He attained an MA (Hons) in Political Studies and later studied law, and worked both as a lawyer and a teacher. He also spent three years in the Netherlands as a technical editor.

Robson was originally a member of the Labour Party, holding several positions within the party organisation. In 1981 he became chairman of Labour&#x27;s electorate committee and was campaign manager to Colin Moyle in the seat at the before resigning as chairman and from the party itself in 1989, taking almost 300 members with him. He was deeply opposed to the neo-liberal economic policies of Roger Douglas, the Labour Party&#x27;s Minister of Finance, and when Jim Anderton, a Labour MP, quit the party, Robson followed him. Robson was heavily involved in the establishment of Anderton&#x27;s NewLabour Party (NLP), which later became the core of the Alliance. He was NLP spokesperson for industrial relations and immigration. He contested the electorate for NewLabour in the . At the 1992 local-body elections he put himself forward as a candidate for the Maungakiekie ward of the Auckland City Council. Standing as an Alliance candidate (the NLP was a component party of the Alliance) he was unsuccessful.

In December 1992, following the Wellington Central by-election, Robson was designated NLP spokesperson for defence to replace Keith Locke whom Anderton considered too left-wing. Later he was the Alliance candidate for in the . In 1994 when Anderton briefly resigned as Alliance leader, and co-deputy leader Sandra Lee was temporarily elevated to the leadership, Robson was elected her temporary replacement co-deputy leader beating Democrats leader John Wright for the position. He also became acting president of NewLabour during Anderton&#x27;s absence between May and August 1995.

===Member of Parliament===

Robson was elected to Parliament as an Alliance list MP in the , and again in the , having stood in , and coming in third place at both elections. In the Labour-Alliance coalition government (1999–2002), Robson was Minister of Corrections, Minister for Courts, Minister for Land Information, and Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs (with responsibility for foreign aid). Towards the end of 1999, however, the Alliance began to collapse, with a rift opening between the party organisation and its parliamentary leadership. In this dispute, Robson sided with the parliamentary leader, Anderton. When Anderton finally left the Alliance and established the Progressive Coalition (later renamed as the Progressive Party), Robson followed him and became the new party&#x27;s deputy leader. In the , the Progressives only won 1.7% of the vote. However, Anderton easily held onto his seat, allowing Robson (standing in , where he came fifth), as the 2nd-ranked person on the Progressive list, to return to Parliament. However, the Progressives&#x27; strength was considerably weaker compared to that of the Alliance in 1999, so Robson lost his cabinet posts.

Robson has a relatively high public profile, compared to the size of his party, and is known for his views on foreign affairs and justice. Along with the Green Party&#x27;s Keith Locke, Robson campaigned on behalf of detained asylum-seeker Ahmed Zaoui. In 2002, Robson introduced a Private Member&#x27;s bill providing for four weeks of paid annual leave for all workers, a proposal that the Labour Party initially opposed. Robson&#x27;s legislation, however, ultimately forced Labour to either vote in favour of the bill or risk alienating its trade union supporters, who vociferously advocated it. The legislation was passed into law with Labour&#x27;s support and took effect in 2007. Robson also introduced legislation to raise the minimum alcohol purchasing age to 20, and in Parliament espoused policies to combat drug and alcohol abuse.

In the , the Progressive vote collapsed further, and this time was not enough for Robson to remain in Parliament. He returned to practising law. In the he was again a candidate in , but did poorly, finishing fifth, with 2.22% of the vote. The Progressives received just under one percent of the party vote, not enough for Robson to be returned to Parliament. At the 2009 Mount Albert by-election Robson campaigned for Labour candidate David Shearer.

On 14 July 2022, Robson had the rare distinction of appearing twice, in positions 47 and 72, in the list of politicians, academics, activists promoting Russian propaganda published by the Ukraine Government.

==Personal life==
Despite having achieved high political office in New Zealand, Robson did not become a naturalised citizen until 2000. Under the terms of New Zealand&#x27;s Electoral Act 1993, anyone permanently resident before August 1975 has the right to vote and stand for election. 

Robson is married to Petronella Townsend who was an influential organisational figure in the Alliance and Progressive parties. At the she was a Progressive list candidate and stood in the seat of .

<text>Sequoia Capital Operations, LLC is an American venture capital firm headquartered in Menlo Park, California which specializes in seed stage, early stage, and growth stage investments in private companies across technology sectors. the firm had approximately US$85 billion in assets under management.

Sequoia is an umbrella brand for three different regionally focused venture entities: 
*&quot;Sequoia Capital Operations&quot; on Europe and United States
*&quot;Peak XV Partners&quot; on India and Southeast Asia
*&quot;HongShan&quot; on China

Notable successful investments made by the firm include Apple, ByteDance, and Cisco.

==History==
Sequoia was founded by Don Valentine in 1972 in Menlo Park, California, at a time when the state&#x27;s venture capital industry was just beginning to develop.

Sequoia formed its first venture capital fund in 1974, and was an early investor in Atari the next year. In 1978, Sequoia became one of the first investors in Apple. Partners Doug Leone and Michael Moritz assumed leadership of the firm in 1996.

In 1999, Sequoia established a dedicated investment fund for Israeli startups. In 2005, Sequoia Capital China was established, later followed by Sequoia Capital India.

In 2012, Moritz took a step back from the day-to-day operations of the firm. Leone became Global Managing Partner. Jim Goetz led Sequoia&#x27;s US business from 2012 until 2017, when he was succeeded by Roelof Botha.

In 2016, Sequoia hired Jess Lee, making her the first female investing partner in the United States in the firm&#x27;s history.

In 2019, it was the most active VC fund company in India.

In March 2020, Sequoia announced it would hire Luciana Lixandru as its first partner based in Europe.

In October 2021, Sequoia announced it would implement a new fund structure for its U.S. and European business that would allow it to remain involved with companies after their public market debuts.

In March 2022, &quot;The Information&quot; reported that Sequoia Capital China was raising an $8 billion fund to invest in Chinese tech companies.

Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had backstopped Sequoia&#x27;s $1billion in deposits in the bank.

In June 2023, Sequoia announced plans to break up into three entities citing complications running a decentralized global investment business in the middle of geopolitical tensions. Following the separation, expected to complete by March 2024, the Chinese business led by Neil Shen would be called HongShan (&quot;sequoia&quot; in Mandarin) and the Indian and Southeast Asia arm would be named Peak XV Partners. The U.S. and Europe unit would retain the Sequoia name. In July 2023, Sequoia announced to cut one-third of its talent staff as part of an organizational restructuring. In October 2023, the United States House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party announced a probe into Sequoia Capital&#x27;s investments in China.

As of at least 2024, Sequoia is the largest investor in China&#x27;s consumer internet sector. It has often used a strategy of investing in several competitors in the same sector and then later pushing for their consolidation. According to Chinese media, Sequoia was one of the major influences in mergers between Meituan and Dianping, between Uber China and Didi, and between VShop and Lefenghui.

==Investments==
Investors, referred to as limited partners, contribute money to a fund that the firm&#x27;s general partners then invest in business ventures. Its limited partners have primarily been university endowments, charitable foundations, and other large institutions.

Sequoia specializes in seed stage, early stage, and growth stage investments in private technology companies, including those in the clean tech, consumer internet, crypto, financial services, healthcare, mobile, and robotics sectors. The firm has been often recognized for its strong track record of early investments. The firm has also distinguished itself from other top venture capital firms by diversifying its investments and not just focusing on U.S. early-stage venture capital.

Sequoia is an umbrella brand for three different venture entities: one focused on the U.S. and Europe, another on India and Southeast Asia, and a third on China. Following the June 2023 announcement to make the three entities independent, from 2024 the ventures would no longer share investors or profits.

A notable opportunity missed by Sequoia was the failure to invest in Facebook in its early days c. 2005; John Naughton suggested that this failure led to &quot;fear of missing out&quot; and may have contributed to Sequoia&#x27;s investing heavily in FTX in 2022, prior to its collapse in 2023.

In 2019, Hurun Research Institute identified Sequoia as the world&#x27;s top unicorn investor, noting it had invested in one in five of all private companies valued at $1 billion or more.

In July 2021, Sequoia published a piece about &quot;the Latin American startup opportunity&quot; that signaled it would increase its focus there.

In October 2021, Sequoia announced the Sequoia Capital Fund, a new fund structure for its U.S. and European business. The fund structure is unique for VC funds as they are typically funds with a 10-year fund cycle instead of an open-ended evergreen fund. The Sequoia fund will no longer need to sell or distribute stock as in the usual VC fund cycle. Instead, limited partners who want liquidity can pull money out of the fund. Sequoia also announced it would become a RIA which would allow the firm more flexibility in its investments.

In February 2022, Sequoia raised a $600 million Sequoia Crypto Fund. As one of the first sub-funds of Sequoia Capital Fund, the crypto fund will mainly invest in cryptocurrencies traded on third-party exchanges.

In June 2022, Sequoia announced that it had raised $2.85 billion in additional funds to invest in India and Southeast Asia. The amount of funds raised is also the largest to date for the company in both India and Southeast Asia.

In June 2023, the firm led a Seed round funding of $5.7 million for Defense startup, Mach Industries.

In July 2023, it reduced the size of its cryptocurrency fund from $585 million to $200 million, and shifted focus to young start-ups after an industry crash.

In 2023, Sequoia launched its Open Source Fellowship to fund up to three open source developers annually via an equity-free fellowship.

===Investment in FTX===

Sequoia Capital along with other notable venture capital investors made an investment in the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. Sequoia was very enthusiastic about FTX, and published an article which was a glowing tribute to Bankman-Fried (since deleted) on its website on 22 September 2022.

FTX failed in 2023, with about $8 billion of investors&#x27; money missing, and Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud. The value of Sequoia&#x27;s investment in FTX was ultimately written down to $0; it is estimated that they lost $214 million on their investment. The company released a notice to investors, stating that their stake in FTX represented a small amount of their investment portfolio. They also removed the profile of Bankman-Fried from their website.

==Programs and partnerships==
In 2009, Sequoia launched its scout program, which functions as an individual investor network that provides founders and other individuals with capital to invest in promising early-stage startups. Sequoia Scouts have invested in over 1,000 companies. Sequoia was the first venture capital firm to offer a scout program, and the model has since been emulated by others in the industry.

In 2021, Sequoia partnered on the BLCK VC Scout Network to provide training and education to current and aspiring Black scouts.

In March 2022, Sequoia launched Arc, a structured program in which participants receive $1 million in funding to work with Sequoia partners in both London and Silicon Valley.

<doc id="1075974" wikidata="Q5330550" url="?curid=1075974" title="Eastern University (United States)">
<text>Eastern University (EU) is a private Christian university in the St. Davids, Pennsylvania area, with additional locations in Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The university offers undergraduate, graduate, and seminary programs. Eastern University is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA and has an interdenominational student body, faculty and administration.

== History ==
The university has its origins in the foundation of Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1925 in Philadelphia by six Conservative Baptist pastors from the American Baptist Publication Society. In 1932, a collegiate department was founded. The school became a separate institution in 1952 and moved to its present St. Davids location, taking the name Eastern Baptist College. In 1972, it was renamed Eastern College. In 2001, the Pennsylvania Department of Education granted the institution university status and it was renamed Eastern University. In 2004, the institution&#x27;s Board voted to acquire its previous parent institution and Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary became a subsidiary of Eastern University. The following year, the seminary changed its name to Palmer Theological Seminary in honor of its longest serving president, Gordon Palmer (1936–48).

== Campus ==
The main campus is on 114 acres just west of Philadelphia. It is specifically in Radnor Township. It has a St. Davids postal address, but is outside of (though adjacent to) the St. Davids census-designated place.

It was originally a private estate, named Walmarthon, which was owned by leather tanning businessman Charles S. Walton. The size of the campus has expanded through purchases of surrounding buildings and land. The original buildings on campus were designed by locally renowned architect David Knickerbacker Boyd, in the Mediterranean style. 

Warner Memorial Library is housed in the Harold Howard Center. The Mazie Hall African American History Room contains books and memorabilia from a local educator. The Edison Room houses several drawings and artifacts which belonged to Thomas Edison.

The Bradstreet Observatory consists of twin 14.5-foot diameter domes that house 16” diameter Meade LX200 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. This addition to Eastern’s facilities created opportunities for astronomical work and research done on campus.

In addition to the main campus in St. Davids, Eastern has additional sites in Pennsylvania: Center City, Philadelphia; City Avenue, Philadelphia; and Harrisburg.

== Academics ==
Eastern University offers associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctorate degrees in more than 100 areas of study. The university also offers undergraduate, graduate and noncredit certificates. Academic programs at the institution are housed in seven schools:

* College of Arts and Humanities
* College of Business and Leadership
* College of Education
* College of Health and Sciences
* Palmer Theological Seminary
* Templeton Honors College
* Esperanza College

== Accreditation ==
Eastern University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Several programs are also accredited:

* Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP)
* Association of Theological Schools in the U.S. and Canada
* Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs
* Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education
* Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE)
* Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) for the Baccalaureate Major in Social Work
* Master’s in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC)
* Association for Behavior Analysis International (Verified Course Sequence for Board Certified Behavior Analysts)
* American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB)

==Student media==
The &quot;Waltonian&quot; is Eastern University’s student-run newspaper. It is published monthly, and covers university, national, and international news.
&quot;Inklings&quot; is Eastern University&#x27;s student-run literary magazine. It is published annually and features poetry, short stories, and photography.
&quot;Eastern&quot; is the magazine of Eastern University. It serves as a connection between the campus community of students, faculty, staff and administration and its alumni, trustees, friends, donors, parents and neighbors.

== Athletics ==
The school&#x27;s sports teams are called the Eagles and are Division III members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Eastern University joined the Middle Atlantic Conferences (commonly referred to as the MAC) in 2008.

<doc id="1075978" wikidata="Q922201" url="?curid=1075978" title="Suzuki Alto">
<text>The is a kei car produced by Suzuki since 1979. The model, currently in its ninth generation, was first introduced in 1979 and has been built in many countries worldwide. The Alto originated as a commercial vehicle derivative of the Fronte, but over time the Alto nameplate gained in popularity and by 1988 it replaced the Fronte name completely. The Alto badge has often been used on different cars in Japan and in export markets, where it is considered a city car.

==Nameplate history==
In Japan, the Alto badge was originally meant to be for the commercial use version of the Fronte passenger car. The word &quot;&quot; is a musical term. When introduced, the Alto was only available as a three-door &quot;light van&quot; and with bare-bones equipment. However, Suzuki generally did not use the &quot;Fronte&quot; badge in export, usually calling all versions &quot;Alto&quot; abroad. Most early export Altos were thus technically speaking rebadged Suzuki Frontes. These were exported with changes such as enlarged engines, sometimes modified bodywork. Thus the Japanese SS40 Fronte became the SS80 Alto with a 660 cc engine abroad. The Alto badge gradually took over in Japan as well, as the distinction between kei commercial vehicles and passenger cars was diminished in early 1989. The Fronte line was retired in March 1989. The Alto plate has been used on export versions of various Indian-built derivatives since the early 1990s, as neither cars are restricted by the kei rules and Indian cars are also considerably cheaper than Japanese-built ones.

Thus, the European-market models were actually:
* 1981–1984: SS40 Fronte with a 796 cc three-cylinder engine (SS80F/G).
* 1984–1994: CA/CB91 Alto/Fronte (also referred to as SB308) with the same F8B engine as the SS80.
* March 1994–2002: Maruti Zen (a wider version of the Suzuki Cervo Mode), with a 993 cc engine.
* 2002–2009: Maruti Suzuki Alto (based on the HA12 Alto), with a 1061 cc four-cylinder engine. Sold until 2012 in other markets.
* 2009–2014: Maruti Suzuki A-Star, with a 998 cc engine.

In 2014, the Suzuki Celerio replaced the Alto in Europe and many other export markets. Outside of the Japanese domestic market, the Alto badge remains used on the second generation of Indian-built Maruti Altos which is generally sold as a Suzuki in export markets.

==First generation (1979)==
The first generation (SS30V/40V), introduced in May 1979, is a three-door cargo version of the Fronte passenger car, equipped with a folding rear seat. Front suspension comprised coils struts, with leaf springs at the back. The steering was of the recirculating ball type, and four-wheel drums were used. On introduction, the Alto received the T5B two-stroke (SS30) three-cylinder engine, producing at 5500 rpm. The Alto was a &quot;micro sensation&quot; when introduced, largely due to its rock bottom price of ¥470,000 (circa $1,900 in 1979, at a time when the cheapest Ford Pinto cost $4,999 in the US). This low price was made possible by a number of Japanese special concessions for commercial vehicles: most notably, the engine was subject to less stringent emissions rules and did not require expensive twin catalysts. Two fewer doors provided another saving, as did the exemption from commodity tax. Initially, Suzuki only offered a single model to avoid additional development costs and to avoid making buyers feel short-changed by not buying more expensive variants. In spite of the relentless cost cutting, Suzuki did increase the safety standards with standard equipment not typically found in kei cars at the time, such as three-point belts in front and individually fused headlamps (so that if a fuse were to blow, one headlamp would still work).

The Alto&#x27;s success changed the kei-car market, and other producers such as Subaru (with the &quot;Family Rex&quot;) quickly followed suit with cut-price &quot;commercial&quot; vehicles that were really intended for private use. Suzuki was unable to keep up with demand the first few years, particularly in the home market. The Alto helped Suzuki move into seventh place in Japanese production for cars and trucks. In the last full year of production for this generation, it was still by far the best selling Kei car, with the Alto outselling the passenger-oriented Fronte at a rate of about five to two.

In May 1980, a fully automatic two-speed option was added to the Alto SS30. In January 1981, the F5A four-stroke from the Fronte was also made available for the Alto; although it only had a single-barrel carburettor, it too put out but at 6,000 rpm. Torque was considerably lower, however, down from . 1981 was also when it became available in the United Kingdom, as Suzuki began selling cars there that year.

In export markets, the Alto name was used for the passenger car versions (chassis codes with trailing letter &quot;S&quot;) as well as on commercials (ending in &quot;V&quot;), while the van was marketed as the &quot;Suzuki Hatch&quot; in Australia. The four-doors were not proper hatchbacks, only featuring an opening rear window. Export cars were also available with twelve-inch wheels, unlike the domestic versions which only used ten-inch units until the introduction of the 4WD version in October 1983. The 4WD &quot;Snow Liner&quot; thus gained an extra of ground clearance. Most export Altos were passenger car versions (which used the &quot;Fronte&quot; badge in the Japanese domestic markets), and usually received the F8B engine and the SS80 chassis code. The 800 had better performance, and due to the higher possible gearing it saw an improved fuel mileage as well - by about ten percent according to Suzuki. The SS80 was also built in New Zealand, by South Pacific Suzuki Assemblers at a rate of six per day. It was introduced in New Zealand in March 1980.

While Suzuki held on to the two-stroke engine concept for a half decade longer than any of its Japanese competitors, eventually market pressures and ever tightening emissions regulations spelled its end in the Alto by September 1981. The Jimny, however, did use the same engine (called LJ50 in the Jimny) as late as 1987.

Between 1983 and 1986, this generation Alto was built in India as the Maruti Suzuki 800. By 1984, the 800 cc Alto/Fronte (called &quot;FX&quot;) were introduced in Pakistan and were locally manufactured by Pak Suzuki Motors along with the 1000 cc Jimny (SJ410).

=== Suzuki Hatch (Australia)===
In Australia, the SS40V was sold as the Suzuki Hatch, only available as a two-seat commercial vehicle. This meant it was taxed at 35 percent duty as opposed to 57.5 percent for passenger cars, and sales were not affected by Australia&#x27;s then-quota on import cars. The Hatch originally offered a single-carburetted engine with at 6000 rpm and at 4000 rpm. The side rear windows were covered with fibreglass by default, with a glass panels optional. The only other option was air conditioning. The Hatch was by far the cheapest new car sold in Australia at the time, although equipment was limited: the buyer received standard vinyl seats and mats and cross ply tires, with the only concession to luxury being a push-button AM radio. M. W. Suzuki in Victoria, Suzuki&#x27;s distributor for Southern Australia, introduced the &quot;800 pack&quot; in January 1981 that included the motor. The pack also added steel-belt radial tyres, 12-inch wheels (up from 10-inch), front-wheel disc brakes and bolder bumpers front and rear.
==Second generation (1984)==
The second generation (CA71) was introduced in September 1984. This generation Alto echoed the design of the GM M-platform that underpinned the 1983 Suzuki Cultus. It continued with the F5A engine of the SS40, but also became available with turbocharged and multi-valve engines thereof, mainly in the &quot;Works&quot; series. In December 1984, a four-wheel-drive version (CC71) was added; until it arrived Suzuki had kept the four-wheel-drive version of the first generation Alto (SS41) on offer. Performance versions of the Alto family first appeared in September 1985, when a fuel injected and turbocharged engine with was made available; this could also be had in combination with four-wheel-drive. The Alto Turbo gradually acquired more performance-related modifications until the Alto Works version was introduced in February 1987. This was the first kei car to reach the legal limit of . It acquired considerable popularity, with models of it still made by Fujimi.

A five-door body became available on the Alto in October 1985. This was superficially identical to that of the Fronte&#x27;s, but the rear seat folded flat and it was technically speaking a commercial vehicle. This was the first five-door commercial of its kind in Japan, and was originally a special model introduced to celebrate the one millionth Alto produced. The CB model code was not used on the Alto in Japan, as it signifies the passenger car version which was still sold as a Fronte in the home market.

In July 1986, the CA/CC71 received a rather thorough facelift. New wraparound headlights, a new dash and interior heralded the new available ITL rear suspension (Isolated Trailing Link), a three-link rigid setup. Some lower end models retained the earlier leaf sprung rigid axle; those with ITL received the CA/CC72 chassis code. A &quot;Walkthrough Van&quot; was introduced in January 1987, while at the other end of the spectrum, the personal coupé Cervo on the CA/CC72 base was introduced in 1988 with a new F5B engine. In August 1987, higher spec Altos became available with a three-speed automatic rather than the two-speed unit that had been used before.

===Other markets===
Most export markets received the passenger car version, which would have been badged &quot;Suzuki Fronte&quot; in Japan, but were usually sold as Altos abroad. When equipped with the 543 cc F5A engine, the export model code is SB305. Most cars sold outside of Japan, however, received the larger (0.8 litres) F8B engine and the SB308 model code.

==== Europe====
The 796 cc, F8B-engined CA/CB91 was sold in Europe with either a four-speed manual or two-speed automatic transmission. Export Altos were technically speaking Frontes, as this was the name used for passenger versions in Japan. They received larger bumpers, making them longer and wider. European Altos received the same facelift as the CA/CB72 did in early 1987 (a little later than in Japan), followed by a market specific facelift in January 1988, unveiled at the Brussels Motor Show. This model remained in production (latterly by Maruti Udyog) for the European market until 1993, when it was replaced by an also Maruti-built 1-litre version of the Cervo Mode, which was sold as the Alto until 2002. The Maruti 800 did continue to be available under its own name in Europe until 2004, when it could no longer pass emissions and safety requirements.

==== India ====

The Suzuki Alto was produced and sold in India as the Maruti 800 between late 1986 and 2014, succeeding the previous generation which had been built there since 1983.

====Pakistan====
While the car has been long retired in other markets, it remained in production in Pakistan under the moniker Suzuki Mehran. The Pakistani version is essentially a simplified basic rebadged second-generation Suzuki Alto CA/CB91 which was sold in the Japanese and European market from 1984 to 1988. The Mehran remained in production due to its cost effective nature and cheap parts availability. In March 2019, the moniker Mehran officially ended its production after over 30 years of production, replaced by the eighth-generation Alto.

====China====

Around 1990, the China Ordnance Industries Corporation (COIC, a predecessor company to Norinco) purchased the complete rights and all machinery for manufacturing the SB308 Alto from Suzuki. COIC charged four hitherto military enterprises with manufacturing the Alto: Chongqing Chang&#x27;an, Jilin Jiangbei, Xiangtan Jiangnan, and Xi&#x27;an Qinchuan were all to switch over to civilian manufacture. Chongqing Chang&#x27;an were able to adapt Suzuki&#x27;s just-in-time manufacturing (JIT) methods and were the first to market the car, in 1992. Jilin Jiangbei lost money on each car built and ended up on the brink of bankruptcy; Xiangtan Jiangnan never got production off the ground, while Xi&#x27;an Qinchuan suffered a fire and chose to develop their own design instead (a car called the Qinchuan Flyer; the company was later made part of BYD Auto). Chang&#x27;an ended up without real competition in the segment. Chang&#x27;an&#x27;s productivity set a new standard for the Chinese auto industry.

In 1993, Changan Automobile took over production of the Alto. The Changan Suzuki SC7080 Alto was produced with the same F8B engine as used in other export markets, and was replaced by the facelifted SC7081 Alto/City Baby/Little Prince/Happy Prince in 2001. The top-of-the-line Happy Prince, discontinued in 2007, used the sportier looking front bumper, grille, and bonnet of the Alto Works. Citing lower sales and stating that upgrading the design to meet new regulations would not be cost effective, Chang&#x27;an ended production of the old Alto on 28 July 2008. A total of 504,861 were built by Chang&#x27;an Suzuki between 1993 and 2008.

Another version called JN Auto has been built by Jiangnan Auto. As of December 2010 Zotye&#x27;s Jiangnan Alto is one of the cheapest car in the world, with a price tag of $2830. The entry-level model comes with the F8B three-cylinder . An inline-four engine with a displacement of and an output of was also available. The Jiangnan TT was eventually replaced by the Zotye Z100 in 2010.

== Third generation (1988)==
The third generation (CL/CM11) replaced the CA71 in September 1988. This was the last generation of Alto to have an associated Fronte model. It had strikingly angular styling, with an unusual glazed C-pillar on the 5-door. Another curiosity of this generation was the availability of a version with a sliding door on the driver&#x27;s side, the &quot;Slide Slim&quot;, intended to simplify entering and exiting in tight spaces. It also made egress easier for the old and the infirm. The Slide Slim has two regular doors on the passenger (left) side. This door type wouldn&#x27;t be used for some time until the arrival of the Toyota Porte and Peugeot 1007. When the Fronte name was discontinued in October 1989, the passenger car versions (CN/CP11) became Altos. Initially the CL11 used the 12-valve F5B engine known from the SS71 Cervo, but with an added 6-valve version in lower-spec versions. A DOHC version was also available in the Twin Cam Rl. Passenger car versions had the same engines, but all with 2 PS less due to more stringent emissions controls. The fuel-injected, 6-valve, turbocharged Works models came with an SOHC engine (FF S/X or 4WD S/R) or a DOHC version (FF RS/X or 4WD RS/R). The front-wheel-drive Works&#x27; were available with a 3-speed automatic in addition to the standard 5-speed manual.

This generation was very successful at home, with Suzuki&#x27;s kei car sales tripling in 1989 versus the year before. It was, however, not generally exported, and was never built by Suzuki with engines of more than 660 cc nor with left-hand-drive. Export models arrived late, only by 1993 after the earlier export version had been retired, and it was only seen in a very few places, namely New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In most countries the earlier Alto/Fronte was replaced by an Alto-badged Maruti Zen (an Indian-built Suzuki Cervo Mode). With a 0.8-litre engine the CL11 Alto was built with left-hand-drive in South Korea, Poland, Romania and Uzbekistan as the Daewoo Tico, and also in China by Anchi.

===660cc era===

When the Kei car standards were changed in 1990, the engine was upgraded to the (F6A), and the Alto became the CL/CM/CN/CP21 in the process. The new standards also allowed for a longer car, which meant new bigger front and rear bumper, and new headlights and grille. Lower grade Van versions received a 6-valve engine, while passenger car versions (and the l&#x27;Èpo Van) got a single-cam 12-valve version. This engine was upgraded to in January 1991. 4WD versions with the three-speed automatic transmission were fuel-injected and offered three more horsepower. The F6A-engined Works RS/X and RS/R still claimed the legally limited with of torque, but the lower grade i.e. Turbo (introduced in July) received a 6-valve SOHC-engine producing and of torque (slightly more than the high-revving, twin cam RS). Reflecting decreased tax benefits for commercial Kei cars, the Works series were now classified as passenger vehicles, allowing for a real back seat. The lineup was reorganised in January 1991, with a lot of new engine specifications.

In September 1991, responding to increasing safety demands, the Alto received side impact protection. Also, the vertical door handles (see picture on the right) on three-door versions were replaced by traditional horizontal ones. The re-engineering was extensive enough to necessitate new model codes, with vans becoming CL/CM22 (FF/4WD) and passenger versions (including the Works) now called CR/CS22. While most of the engines remained as they were, the Alto Van&#x27;s engines were updated with power output up to .

This was the model that reached limited exports. The New Zealand version was mostly the same as the Japanese market five-door van model, with a cargo-oriented bare-bones trim combined with the rather soft Japanese suspension settings and light, low-geared steering. Unlike the Japanese models, however, this low spec was coupled to the (carbureted) 12-valve engine with and a standard five-speed transmission. A three-speed automatic was also available. In a period test, this model reached the 0–100 km/h benchmark in 15.9 seconds and a top speed of .

A very limited production version for competition purposes arrived in 1992, called the Alto Works R. This was a lightened, strict two-seater with four-wheel-drive, a close-ratio five-speed transmission, and a tuned engine - although official output remained , as required by the Kei regulations. The car has an adjusted ECU and a free-flow Suzuki Sport RHB31 turbocharger, as well as a different throttle body. Less than a hundred were built, although it continued to be available until the arrival of the next generation Alto. This model, without a backseat and with racing bucket seats in front, was classified as a van and accordingly received the CM22V chassis code, unlike the usual Alto Works. The undercoating and most creature comforts were deleted (although air conditioning remained an option) and the car sat on steel wheels, which made the car about lighter than a regular Works RS/R.

====Alto Hustle====

Suzuki also produced a version of the Alto, known as the Alto Hustle, with a raised roof behind the front seats. This was unusual in that it used a modification of the five-door Alto&#x27;s body rather than a completely new body, allowing Suzuki to market it as part of the Alto family. Its appearance was similar to the Nissan AD Max van. The Hustle was short-lived, only being offered between November 1991 and October 1993.

The engine options were mostly as for other Altos, albeit without the turbocharged offerings. The standard model has , while a 12-valve version has depending on if it was carburetted or fuel injected. The lowest and highest-powered versions were also available with four-wheel-drive, and there was a bare bones two-seater version (Hu-2) on offer.

== Fourth generation (1994)==
The fourth-generation Alto (HA11) appeared in November 1994. The design was marked by simplicity, as Suzuki strived to return to making a more basic car. The Slide Slim model, with its sliding door on one side, was discontinued, as were some of the higher end versions of the third generation Alto such as the Regina. The new Wagon R took over much of the more expensive Alto&#x27;s market share, leaving the Alto to compete at the lower end of the market. The fourth generation was generally not exported, with most foreign markets instead receiving Alto-badged versions of the Indian-built Maruti Zen.

There was also an Alto Van model intended for commercial use, although this section of the market was disappearing as various tax advantages had been gradually whittled away since the beginning of the decade. The Vans received HC11 or HD11 chassis codes, with the latter signifying four-wheel drive. For the sedans, model codes are HA11 or HB11 (HB for four-wheel drive), while the K6A-engined versions are HA21 or HB21.

The 657 cc F6A engines were joined by a new high-performance , 658 cc K6A for the Works RS/Z model. Front-wheel drive or full-time four-wheel drive were offered, in three- or five-door sedans or as a three-door van. The Works model was also reclassified as a sedan, as many advantages for light commercial cars had vanished. The tailgate and rear doors are still fairly angular, but the front was more rounded than previous models.

===Chronology===
In March 1995, the Alto Sv model appeared. This was a special fuel economy model, well equipped with air conditioning, power steering, AM/FM cassette stereo, etc. The &quot;Alto With&quot;, a limited sporty edition based on the well-equipped Sf model (also with four-wheel drive) with a front and rear spoiler, appeared in June 1995. In July 1995, a version of the Works Turbo ie/s called the Limited appeared; this had special stereo equipment and keyless entry and power locks. It was developed by AddZest (Clarion). In November 1995, the Works model received a new grille and front bumper, with a bigger opening. In May 1996, the l&#x27;Èpo model appeared, this three or five-door sedan was based on the Se/Le model and was also available with four-wheel drive. This version received full power equipment, remote key entry, distinctly upholstered full fabric seats (rather than the vinyl backed units of the Se/Le), hubcaps and many other amenities.

The Works Turbo F Limited ie/s version appeared in November 1996, offering a carbon panel, special alloy wheels, and more spoilers. In April 1997, the range received a facelift with side door impact beams and a new front design, with new marker lights beneath the headlights and a redesigned trunklid. The Alto l&#x27;Èpo P2 appeared at the same time, using a fuel injected version of the 12-valve engine with rather than the usual carburetted unit. All 12-valve models fitted with four-wheel drive and automatic transmission received a fuel injected version, as was the case since the third generation Alto. The l&#x27;Èpo models also received a new (optional) airbag. The Works models only received smaller changes at this time, such as white-backed meters in the dashboard. The RS/Z also received 14-inch wheels and fuller equipment. In November 1997, the even better equipped l&#x27;Èpo Limited model appeared, with a more powerful stereo system including a CD player. In January 1998, the Works Sports Limited model appeared, a Works ie/s with 14-inch wheels and special seats. In May the &quot;Alto Beam&quot; special model appeared, with UV reflecting glass and extra large seats.

In March 1995, a second iteration of the Works R arrived, again a limited production vehicle with a close-ratio transmission, built for competition purposes. Like the first Works R it was built in less than one-hundred examples, but this one appeared in two series: The Series 2 had sold out by October 1995 and the third series was available from January until September 1998. Unlike the first Works R, this one was a passenger car version (chassis code HB21S) and received the new, lightweight K6A engine. It was lighter than the regular Works RS/R, and the engine was considerably more powerful - although claimed output remained as per the regulations, torque increased from 10.5 to 11.0 kgm (at 3500 rpm for the Series 2, 4000 rpm for the Series 3). Period sources state that the engine&#x27;s actual output was at least . The engine received considerable changes over the regular Works, many more than the first Works R. The throttle body and camshafts were different, while a larger HT06/RA12 turbocharger was fitted, along with 260 cc injectors and a larger intercooler (necessitating a hood scoop nearly as wide as the bonnet itself). The weight savings were only over the Works RS/Z for this model. This was the end of the Works R series of cars, foreshadowing the end of the Works badge in 2000.

== Fifth generation (1998)==
The fifth-generation Alto (HA12/22) was introduced in October 1998. The styling was generally more rounded, the shape of the cabin showing the Alto&#x27;s relationship with the new Suzuki Kei. Suzuki designed the new Alto with an eye to reducing cost, both for themselves and for the end users. To that end, weight was reduced to a minimum, while four-wheel drive models were able to use the same bottom plate as front-wheel drive models. With sales of the 2-seat commercial versions dropping steadily, those versions (Va and Sc, with four-speed manual transmission) were now only built to order.

The 658 cc K6A engine was now also available without a turbocharger, joining the turbocharged version and the familiar 657 cc F6A engines. The HA12 chassis number was for F6A-engined cars; HA22 denotes cars with the K6A engine. The turbocharged Works models were available with a 60 PS F6A engine (Alto i.e., 5MT/3AT/4AT and FWD or AWD) or a 64 PS VVT K6A (RS/Z, 5MT/4AT and FWD or AWD). The front-wheel-drive RS/Z was sold with a non-VVT K6A engine when in combination with a 4-speed automatic transmission, it too with a claimed 64 PS. Unique to this generation was a five-door version of the Alto Works. With the December 2000 facelift, the Works versions were discontinued, as the Alto family was realigned strictly as an economy version. The Suzuki Kei Sports picked up the Works&#x27; mantle.

Several derivatives were produced from this generation. Suzuki produced two &quot;classic-style&quot; versions: the Alto C with a deep chrome grille and a curious headlamp arrangement by which circular main lamps were joined with ovoid sidelights and indicators, which was shared with the Alto Works; and the later Alto C2 which had separate headlamps and sidelights and a wider grille. Mazda also sold the standard Alto as the Carol, and Mitsuoka used the Carol as a basis for their Ray.

===Facelift===
In December 2000, the fifth generation Alto received a thorough facelift, becoming the HA23. Front- and four-wheel drive models now used the same chassis number. As the Works and all other turbocharged models were discontinued, naturally aspirated versions of the new K6A became the only ones on offer, with either or in an especially efficient lean burn iteration. The K6A met the MLIT requirements to be classified as an &quot;excellent low emissions vehicle&quot;. The retro-style Alto C was also discontinued. In February 2001 a new retro version was introduced, the Alto C2. Unlike the earlier C, this one had the same headlights as other Altos and did not have the chrome detailing of the earlier version.

Front- or four-wheel-drive, manual and automatic transmissions were available (no more CVT), in either a 3- or 5-door hatchback body. A 3-door van version remained available. Passenger model production was discontinued in August 2004 to make room for the succeeding generation, but a decontented Van version was kept in production until January 2005. These forwent the VVT system and the automatic only had three forward speeds rather than four as before.
===In other markets===
This model also entered production in India as the Maruti Suzuki Alto (model code RF) in September 2000 and was built there until 2014. From 2002 until 2009 Maruti-built Altos were exported to Europe as Suzuki Altos; sales continued in Latin America and other markets until the next generation Maruti Alto took over in 2012. The car is powered with 0.8-litre F8D three-cylinder and 1.1-litre F10D four-cylinder engines with fuel injection.

Pakistani production began in 2000 utilizing the old carburetted 1.0-litre F10A four-cylinder engine and also available with CNG variant. The production was halted in 2012.

Beginning in mid-1999, and originally imported from Japan, the car was also sold in Colombia as the Chevrolet Alto. As the market for two-door cars was minimal in Colombia, it was only available with five doors. The Colombian model was equipped with a one-litre, sixteen-valve inline-four engine with at 6500 rpm, an engine it shared with the locally made Chevrolet Wagon R+. GM Colmotores began building it themselves in 2000 and kept it in production until 2003. The Chevrolet Alto was also exported to Ecuador.

== Sixth generation (2004)==

The sixth-generation Alto (HA24) was introduced in September 2004. The bonnet and headlamps curved down at the front, giving a similar effect to the Toyota WiLL Vi or the Citroën C2. The Alto was realigned as a less costly car to accommodate new models such as the Cervo and Alto Lapin. The more powerful engines were moved into the other more upmarket versions like the Suzuki Kei Works and Alto Lapin SS, leaving the Alto with only a version. In Japan, this version of the Alto was not only rebadged as the Mazda Carol, but also by Nissan as the Pino.

==Seventh generation (2009)==
===Japan===
The seventh-generation Alto was first shown at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show alongside its sister car, the Mazda Carol. It is available with a engine, a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic transmission or a CVT, in FWD or 4WD variants. Under the Japanese 10-15 test cycle, the front-wheel-drive with CVT achieves 24.5 km/litre fuel economy.

In 2011, Suzuki launched the Alto Eco variant, that features the R06A engine lifted from the Suzuki MR Wagon and an idling stop function. It is capable of reaching based on Japan&#x27;s JC08 Mode test cycle (32 km/L under 10-15 test cycle). This is .2 km/L higher than the Daihatsu Mira e:S.

In 2013, the Alto Eco was updated with the addition of Suzuki&#x27;s ENE-CHARGE system, first applied on the fifth generation Wagon R. With this technology, fuel economy has now improved to 33.0 km/L based on Japan&#x27;s JC08 Mode test cycle.

===International===
The Suzuki Alto available in international market is known in India as the Maruti Suzuki A-Star (short for &quot;Alto-Star&quot;), but is also known as the Suzuki Celerio in some other countries. It was launched in December 2008 by Suzuki&#x27;s Indian subsidiary Maruti Suzuki.

It is actually a different car from the Japanese market one although they share the same name. The car is manufactured exclusively in Haryana, India and is exported worldwide. It is available in some European markets with a somewhat different front end as the Nissan Pixo. The car was rolled out to the Indian customers in December 2008 and exports began in April 2009.

With a totally new body and engine, Maruti hopes to bring freshness to the Indian car market, of which it already holds a major share. The &quot;K10B&quot; inline-three engine was developed especially for the new car, and is also used for the Nissan Pixo. The A-Star has a fresh new dashboard, with an available unique protruding tachometer besides the usual meter cowl (only in the ZXi trim).

In February 2014, Maruti Suzuki unveiled an all-new Celerio, which replaces the A-Star and Zen Estilo.

The European market version of the Maruti Suzuki A-Star was unveiled at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. It was developed to be a global car and will be made at Maruti Suzuki&#x27;s plant in Manesar, Haryana, India. It is stylistically based on the Suzuki A-Star Concept. The Alto was conceived as a response to high petrol prices and global warming. It was released as an eco-friendly car priced from £6,795 OTR.

====Nissan Pixo====
The Nissan Pixo is the &quot;sister car&quot; to the Suzuki Alto. Mechanically, both cars are very similar; however, there are a few notable exterior differences, including the main grille and headlamps. It was launched at the 2008 Paris Motor Show and was available in Europe from 2009 to 2013. Because it was developed and built cheaply in India, the Pixo was sold for just under £7,000. In the summer of 2013, the Pixo was withdrawn from UK showrooms.

The Nissan Pixo was reviewed, and subsequently mocked, by Top Gear in series 17. The review became a Top Gear challenge where Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond bought cars on the second hand market for the same price as a new Pixo. Clarkson bought a 2002 Mercedes Mercedes CL600 for £6995, and Hammond bought a 1994 BMW 850ci for £6,700. James May defended the Pixo, arguing that it was more modern, reliable and economical than the two luxury cars.

===Suzuki Alto 800===

In 2012, India&#x27;s Maruti introduced a low cost replacement for the original Maruti 800 called the Alto 800. This was also exported to many markets outside of Europe and sold as the Suzuki Alto 800, while some markets simultaneously offered the pricier A-Star as the Suzuki Alto.
==Eighth generation (2014)==
The eighth-generation Alto was introduced in Japan in December 2014. The new Alto was the first Suzuki&#x27;s car designed on lightweight &quot;HEARTECT&quot; platform. It is also the first Alto that using torsion beam model rear suspension, replacing the old 3-link model (except for all-wheel-drive models). The new lightweight platform, lighter body, engine, seats and simpler rear suspension made the car lighter than the outgoing model. This car was also designed to have a very low fuel consumption, achieved using &quot;Suzuki Green Technology&quot; for the body and the engine, and resulted in the car having a claimed fuel consumption of .

The conventional models of the new Alto is available in five trim levels. The passenger variant are called &quot;F&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;S&quot; and &quot;X&quot;, plus a commercial van variant called &quot;VP&quot;. All powered with a naturally-aspirated &quot;K06A&quot; inline-three engine, from previous generation. This engine received major improvement in fuel efficiency by raising the compression ratio and adopting the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system (excludes &quot;F&quot; trim with manual transmission and &quot;VP&quot; van), while enhancing the low-to-mid speed driving performance by newly designing the intake and exhaust systems. The weight also reduced by adopting a cylinder head integrated with an exhaust manifold and simplifying the catalyzer case. It is mated with either a 5-speed manual transmission (&quot;F&quot; and &quot;VP&quot;), a 5-speed automated manual transmission called &quot;Auto Gear Shift&quot; (AGS) by Suzuki (&quot;F&quot; and &quot;VP&quot;), or a CVT (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;S&quot; and &quot;X&quot;). All transmissions are available with all wheel-drive option. The &quot;K06A&quot; engine with manual transmission for &quot;F&quot; and &quot;VP&quot; trims are rated at and , while the rest of the range produces three horsepower and four Nm more because those engines are fitted with VVT.

A sporty variant intended for daily use called &quot;Turbo RS&quot; was introduced in March 2015 which was followed by a more spartan performance-tuned &quot;Works&quot; variant which made a comeback in December after 15 years of absence. The Works had been discontinued as the market had shifted away from performance cars to instead concerning itself with economy and the environment; Suzuki made mention of the high fuel economy even of the Works model. These high performance models are powered with the turbocharged variant of &quot;K06A&quot; engine, producing and - (&quot;Works&quot; has two Nm more than the Turbo RS). It is paired with either a 5-speed manual (not available for &quot;Turbo RS&quot;) or automated manual transmission with taller gear ratios than the less powerful &quot;F&quot; and VP&quot; trims. The handling is also reworked with new wider high performance tires from Bridgestone, shock absorber from KYB, ventilated front disc brakes, strut bar to increase body&#x27;s rigidity, rear stabilizer bar for front wheel-drive models (also available for &quot;X&quot; trim).

For the interior, unlike the previous generation, adjustable front seats head rest and 50:50 foldable back seats (still with adjustable head rest, excluding &quot;VP&quot;, &quot;F&quot; and &quot;L&quot; trims) are deleted. All natural aspirated engined models received two tone black and white colours. In 2018, the seat upholstery was replaced with dark blue colour for &quot;L&quot;, &quot;S&quot; and &quot;X&quot; trims. &quot;Turbo RS&quot; and &quot;Works&quot; trims has black with red accents interior colour, leather wrapped steering wheel, paddle shift for AGS models and tachometer. The &quot;Works&quot; trim added racing front seats from Recaro, stainless steel pedals and turbo boost meter.

In term of exterior, all naturally aspirated models are using halogen headlights as standard and 13 inches steel wheels with hubcaps (except &quot;VP&quot;) and &quot;X&quot; with special two tone colours. The &quot;Turbo RS&quot; and &quot;Works&quot; received more sporty bumpers, side skirts, rear upper spoiler, fog lights, stickers, 15 inches aluminium wheels from Enkei (also available for &quot;X&quot; trim), front brake calipers with red colour for &quot;Works&quot; and HID headlights.

The safety is also upgraded with additional electronic stability control and collision avoidance system. The car achieved 4 of 5 stars in crash tests performed by &quot;JNCAP&quot;.

To celebrate the 40-year anniversary of Alto, a special edition called &quot;L Limited&quot; was launched in June 2019. The car is based on &quot;L&quot; trim with additional accessories and features from higher trims.

The &quot;Turbo RS&quot; trim was discontinued in December 2018, followed by the &quot;X&quot; trim in October 2020, the &quot;VP&quot; commercial van in August 2021, with the entire lineup finally replaced by the ninth generation four months later. The August 2021 discontinuation of the VP also marked the end of the Alto commercial vehicle, as there was no such version planned for the ninth generation.

=== Pakistan ===
The eighth-generation Alto was revealed for the Pakistani market on 12 April 2019 at the Pakistan Auto Show (PAPS). The car is sold in three variants: &quot;VX&quot;, &quot;VXR&quot; and &quot;VXL&quot;. The &quot;VX&quot; being the base model with minimal equipment, no air conditioning and a 5-speed manual transmission; the &quot;VXR&quot; variant gaining twin airbags, power locks, power steering, etc.; while the premium &quot;VXL&quot; model is further equipped with air conditioning, ABS brakes, and an automated manual transmission &quot;AGS&quot;.

The local manufacturing of Alto has made Pakistan one of the few countries in the world that locally manufactures kei cars. Currently, Pakistan is the only country other than Japan to locally manufacture this generation of Suzuki Alto. Pak Suzuki Motors&#x27; second generation Alto looks cosmetically the same as the Japanese-made one and is powered by the same engine. It is rated at and , lower than Japanese model because the lower compression ratio (10 vs 11.5), lack of VVT and several other differences.

==Ninth generation (2021)==
The ninth-generation Alto was introduced in Japan in December 2021. It is continued to be built on lightweight &quot;HEARTECT&quot; platform and powered with the same &quot;R06A&quot; engine for the conventional models. Additionally, the car received new &quot;R06D&quot; engine with mild hybrid system that was also seen in Suzuki Wagon R Smile. CVT is the only transmission that available in this generation and became the first Alto without manual transmission option. The &quot;Auto Gear Shift (AGS)&quot; automated manual transmission is also abolished.

The exterior styling is penned by Alessandro Di Gregorio, designer of Suzuki European Design Center in Italy: aesthetically the whole body presents softer, friendlier and less angular lines while still recalling the design of the previous generation. The windscreen is more vertical to make the passenger compartment more spacious and the total height is increased.

Four trim levels are available, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;L&quot; for conventional model and &quot;S&quot; and &quot;X&quot; for hybrid model.

<text>Janusz Jędrzejewicz (; 21 June 1885 – 16 March 1951) was a Polish politician and educator, a leader of the Sanacja political group, and 24th Prime Minister of Poland from 1933 to 1934.

==Life==
He joined Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s Polish Socialist Party in 1904. After World War I broke out, he joined the Polish Legions and the Polish Military Organization. In 1918 he joined the Polish Army and served as aide to Piłsudski. In 1919, he was transferred to Section II (Intelligence) at the Lithuanian-Belarusian Front Headquarters, and later to the General Staff.

After the Polish–Soviet War, in 1923 Jędrzejewicz became a politician. He was elected a deputy to the Polish Sejm (1928–35) and later a senator. In 1930–1935 he was vice-president of the Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government (BBWR). From 12 August 1931, to 22 February 1934, he served as minister of education. He introduced a reform of Poland&#x27;s educational system that came to be named, after him, &quot;Jędrzejewicz reform.&quot; From 10 May 1933, to 13 May 1934, he was Prime Minister of Poland.

In 1926, he founded the monthly, &quot;Wiedza i Życie&quot;. In 1929, he organized a teachers&#x27; union, &quot;Zrąb&quot;, and other educational societies, including the Polish Academy of Literature. He was also co-author of the 1935 Polish Constitution. After Piłsudski&#x27;s death in 1935, he opposed the Camp of National Unity (OZN, &quot;Ozon&quot;) and the right wing of the Sanacja movement, and retired from political life.

After the Soviet invasion during the Polish Defensive War of 1939, he fled to Romania and later through Palestine to London. In 1948, he was chosen to be head of Liga Niepodległości Polski, a political party in exile. He died in 1951.

He was a brother of Wacław Jędrzejewicz and married Cezaria Baudouin de Courtenay Ehrenkreutz Jędrzejewiczowa, a pioneer of ethnography in Poland.

<text>Thomas Rees (13 December 1815 – 29 April 1885) was a Welsh Congregational minister, who wrote a history of nonconformism. He was twice elected chairman of the Union of Welsh Independents.

==Early life==
The son of Thomas Rees and his wife Hannah William, Rees was born at Pen Pontbren, Llanfynydd, Carmarthenshire, and brought up by his mother&#x27;s family at Banc-y-fer, Llangathen, where he helped his grandfather, Dafydd William, a basket maker. He joined the Independent chapel at Capel Isaac and began to preach in March 1832. He took a job at a colliery at Llwydcoed, Aberdare, but fell ill and then set up a small school. In 1836 he moved to Craig-y-bargod, Merthyr Tydfil, and took charge of a small school there.

==Pastorates==
Rees was ordained a minister on 15 September 1836 and then served as pastor at Craig-y-Bargoed (1836), Trecynon, Aberdare (1840), Llanelli (1842), Cendl (Beaufort), Breconshire/Mon. (1849) and Abertawe (1860). His chapel in Beaufort was Carmel Chapel; Beaufort was in the county of Brecknockshire (Breconshire) until 1879: see photos of Carmel Chapel on the Beaufort website.

==Honours==
Rees was awarded an honorary doctorate of divinity in 1862 by Marietta College, Ohio. He was twice elected as Chairman of the Union of Welsh Independents, in 1873 and 1875, and then as Chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales in 1884, but he died at his home in Swansea on 29 April 1885, before his term of office could begin.

==Writings==
Rees was widely known for his biblical commentaries. He was a co-founder of the first Welsh Independent quarterly, &quot;Yr Adolygydd&quot;. His &quot;History of Protestant Nonconformity in Wales&quot; (1861, 2nd ed. 1883) prepared the ground for a history of Welsh Independent churches, &quot;Hanes eglwysi Annibynol Cymru&quot; (1870 onwards), on the first four volumes of which he worked with John Thomas (1821–1892). He was criticized for denominational prejudice in the work, but made meticulous use of sources, so that it remains an important source work.

<text>A hospital information system (HIS) is an element of health informatics that focuses mainly on the administrational needs of hospitals. In many implementations, a HIS is a comprehensive, integrated information system designed to manage all the aspects of a hospital&#x27;s operation, such as medical, administrative, financial, and legal issues and the corresponding processing of services. Hospital information system is also known as hospital management software (HMS) or hospital management system.

Hospital information systems provide a common source of information about a patient&#x27;s health history, and doctors schedule timing. The system has to keep data in a secure place and controls who can reach the data in certain circumstances. These systems enhance the ability of health care professionals to coordinate care by providing a patient&#x27;s health information and visit history at the place and time that it is needed. Patient&#x27;s laboratory test information also includes visual results such as X-ray, which may be reachable by professionals. HIS provide internal and external communication among health care providers. Portable devices such as smartphones and tablet computers may be used at the bedside.

Hospital information systems are often composed of one or several software components with specialty-specific extensions, as well as of a large variety of sub-systems in medical specialties from a multi-vendor market. Specialized implementations name for example laboratory information system (LIS), Policy and Procedure Management System, radiology information system (RIS) or picture archiving and communication system (PACS).

Potential benefits of hospital information systems include:
*Efficient and accurate administration of finance, diet of patient, engineering, and distribution of medical aid. It helps to view a broad picture of hospital growth
*Improved monitoring of drug usage, and study of effectiveness. This leads to the reduction of adverse drug interactions while promoting more appropriate pharmaceutical utilization.
*Enhances information integrity, reduces transcription errors, and reduces duplication of information entries.

<doc id="1076007" wikidata="Q738680" url="?curid=1076007" title="Pottery of ancient Greece">
<text>Pottery, due to its relative durability, comprises a large part of the archaeological record of ancient Greece, and since there is so much of it (over 100,000 painted vases are recorded in the Corpus vasorum antiquorum), it has exerted a disproportionately large influence on our understanding of Greek society. The shards of pots discarded or buried in the 1st millennium BC are still the best guide available to understand the customary life and mind of the ancient Greeks. There were several vessels produced locally for everyday and kitchen use, yet finer pottery from regions such as Attica was imported by other civilizations throughout the Mediterranean, such as the Etruscans in Italy. There were a multitude of specific regional varieties, such as the South Italian ancient Greek pottery.

Throughout these places, various types and shapes of vases were used. Not all were purely utilitarian; large Geometric amphorae were used as grave markers, kraters in Apulia served as tomb offerings and Panathenaic Amphorae seem to have been looked on partly as &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot;, as were later terracotta figurines. Some were highly decorative and meant for elite consumption and domestic beautification as much as serving a storage or other function, such as the krater with its usual use in diluting wine.

Earlier Greek styles of pottery, called &quot;Aegean&quot; rather than &quot;Ancient Greek&quot;, include Minoan pottery, very sophisticated by its final stages, Cycladic pottery, Minyan ware and then Mycenaean pottery in the Bronze Age, followed by the cultural disruption of the Greek Dark Age. As the culture recovered Sub-Mycenaean pottery finally blended into the Protogeometric style, which begins Ancient Greek pottery proper.

The rise of vase painting saw increasing decoration. Geometric art in Greek pottery was contiguous with the late Dark Age and early Archaic Greece, which saw the rise of the Orientalizing period. The pottery produced in Archaic and Classical Greece included at first black-figure pottery, yet other styles emerged such as red-figure pottery and the white ground technique. Styles such as West Slope Ware were characteristic of the subsequent Hellenistic period, which saw vase painting&#x27;s decline.

== Rediscovery and scholarship ==

The interest in Greek art lagged behind the revival of classical scholarship during the Renaissance and was revived in the academic circle surrounding Nicolas Poussin in Rome in the 1630s. Though modest collections of vases recovered from ancient tombs in Italy were made in the 15th and 16th centuries these were regarded as Etruscan. It is possible that Lorenzo de Medici bought several Attic vases directly from Greece; however the connection between them and the examples excavated in central Italy was not made until much later. Winckelmann&#x27;s of 1764 first refuted the Etruscan origin of what we now know to be Greek pottery yet Sir William Hamilton&#x27;s two collections, one lost at sea the other now in the British Museum, were still published as &quot;Etruscan vases&quot;; it would take until 1837 with Stackelberg&#x27;s to conclusively end the controversy.
Much of the early study of Greek vases took the form of production of albums of the images they depict, however neither D&#x27;Hancarville&#x27;s nor Tischbein&#x27;s folios record the shapes or attempt to supply a date and are therefore unreliable as an archaeological record. Serious attempts at scholarly study made steady progress over the 19th century starting with the founding of the Instituto di Corrispondenza in Rome in 1828 (later the German Archaeological Institute), followed by Eduard Gerhard&#x27;s pioneering study (1840 to 1858), the establishment of the journal in 1843 and the &quot;Ecole d&#x27;Athens&quot; 1846. It was Gerhard who first outlined the chronology we now use, namely: Orientalizing (Geometric, Archaic), Black Figure, Red Figure, Polychromatic (Hellenistic).

Finally it was Otto Jahn&#x27;s 1854 catalogue &quot;Vasensammlung&quot; of the Pinakothek, Munich, that set the standard for the scientific description of Greek pottery, recording the shapes and inscriptions with a previously unseen fastidiousness. Jahn&#x27;s study was the standard textbook on the history and chronology of Greek pottery for many years, yet in common with Gerhard he dated the introduction of the red figure technique to a century later than was in fact the case. This error was corrected when the Archaeological Society of Athens undertook the excavation of the Acropolis in 1885 and discovered the so-called &quot;Persian debris&quot; of red figure pots destroyed by Persian invaders in 480 BC. With a more soundly established chronology it was possible for Adolf Furtwängler and his students in the 1880s and 90s to date the strata of his archaeological digs by the nature of the pottery found within them, a method of seriation Flinders Petrie was later to apply to unpainted Egyptian pottery.

Where the 19th century was a period of Greek discovery and the laying out of first principles, the 20th century has been one of consolidation and intellectual industry. Efforts to record and publish the totality of public collections of vases began with the creation of the &quot;Corpus vasorum antiquorum&quot; under Edmond Pottier and the Beazley archive of John Beazley.

Beazley and others following him have also studied fragments of Greek pottery in institutional collections, and have attributed many painted pieces to individual artists. Scholars have called these fragments &quot;disjecta membra&quot; (Latin for &quot;scattered parts&quot;) and in a number of instances have been able to identify fragments now in different collections that belong to the same vase.

== Uses and types ==

The names we use for Greek vase shapes are often a matter of convention rather than historical fact. A few do illustrate their own use or are labeled with their original names, while others are the result of early archaeologists&#x27; attempt to reconcile the physical object with a known name from Greek literature—not always successfully.
To understand the relationship between form and function, Greek pottery may be divided into four broad categories, given here with common types:
* storage and transport vessels, including the amphora, pithos, pelike, hydria, pyxis,
* mixing vessels, mainly for &quot;symposia&quot; or male drinking parties, including the krater, and dinos,
* jugs and cups, several types of kylix also just called cups, kantharos, phiale, skyphos, oinochoe and loutrophoros,
* vases for oils, perfumes and cosmetics, including the large lekythos, and the small aryballos and alabastron.

As well as these utilitarian functions, certain vase shapes were especially associated with rituals, others with athletics and the gymnasium. Not all of their uses are known, but where there is uncertainty scholars make good proximate guesses of what use a piece would have served. Some have a purely ritual function, for example

Some vessels were designed as grave markers. Craters marked the places of males and amphorae marked those of females. This helped them to survive, and is why some will depict funeral processions. White ground lekythoi contained the oil used as funerary offerings and appear to have been made solely with that object in mind. Many examples have a concealed second cup inside them to give the impression of being full of oil, as such they would have served no other useful gain.

There was an international market for Greek pottery since the 8th century BC, which Athens and Corinth dominated down to the end of the 4th century BC. An idea of the extent of this trade can be gleaned from plotting the find maps of these vases outside of Greece, though this could not account for gifts or immigration. Only the existence of a second hand market could account for the number of panathenaics found in Etruscan tombs. South Italian wares came to dominate the export trade in the Western Mediterranean as Athens declined in political importance during the Hellenistic period.

== Clay ==
The few ways that clay pottery can be damaged is by being broken, being abraded or by coming in contact with fire. The process of making a pot and firing it is fairly simple. The first thing a potter needs is clay. Attica&#x27;s high-iron clay gave its pots an orange color.

=== Manufacture ===
==== Levigation ====
When clay is first dug out of the ground it is full of rocks and shells and other useless items that need to be removed. To do this the potter mixes the clay with water and lets all the impurities sink to the bottom. This is called levigation or elutriation. This process can be done many times. The more times this is done, the smoother clay becomes.

==== Wheel ====
The clay is then kneaded by the potter and placed on a wheel. Once the clay is on the wheel the potter can shape it into any of the many shapes shown below, or anything else he desires. Wheel-made pottery dates back to roughly 2500 BC. Before this, the coil method of building the walls of the pot was employed. Most Greek vases were wheel-made, though as with the Rhyton mould-made pieces (so-called &quot;plastic&quot; pieces) are also found and decorative elements either hand-formed or by mould were added to thrown pots. More complex pieces were made in parts then assembled when it was leather hard by means of joining with a slip, where the potter returned to the wheel for the final shaping or turning. Sometimes, a young man helped turn the wheel.

==== Clay slip ====
After the pot was made, the potter painted it with an ultra fine grained clay slip; the paint was applied on the areas intended to become black after firing, according to the two different styles, i.e. the black figure and the red figure. For the decoration the vase painters used brushes of different thickness, pinpoint tools for incisions and probably single-hair tools for the relief lines.

A series of analytical studies have shown that the striking black gloss with a metallic sheen, so characteristic of Greek pottery, emerged from the colloidal fraction of an illitic clay with very low calcium oxide content. This clay slip was rich in iron oxides and hydroxides, differentiating from that used for the body of the vase in terms of the calcium content, the exact mineral composition and the particle size. The fine clay suspension used for the paint was either produced by using several deflocculating additives to clay (potash, urea, dregs of wine, bone ashes, seaweed ashes, etc.) or by collecting it in situ from illitic clay beds following rain periods. Recent studies have shown that some trace elements in the black glaze (i.e. Zn in particular) can be characteristic of the clay beds used in antiquity. In general, different teams of scholars suggest different approaches concerning the production of the clay slip used in antiquity.
==== Firing ====

Greek pottery, unlike today&#x27;s pottery, was only fired once, using a very sophisticated process. The black color effect was achieved by means of changing the amount of oxygen present during firing. This was done in a process known as three-phase firing involving alternating oxidizing –reducing conditions. First, the kiln was heated to around 920–950 °C, with all vents open bringing oxygen into the firing chamber and turning both pot and slip a reddish-brown (oxidising conditions) due to the formation of hematite (Fe2O3) in both the paint and the clay body. Then the vent was closed and green wood introduced, creating carbon monoxide which turns the red hematite to black magnetite (Fe3O4); at this stage the temperature decreases due to incomplete combustion. In a final reoxidizing phase (at about 800–850 °C) the kiln was opened and oxygen reintroduced causing the unslipped reserved clay to go back to orange-red while the slipped area on the vase that had been sintered/vitrified in the previous phase, could no longer be oxidized and remained black.

While the description of a single firing with three stages may seem economical and efficient, some scholars claim that it is equally possible that each of these stages was confined to separate firings in which the pottery is subjected to multiple firings, of different atmosphere. In any case, the faithful reproduction of the process involving extensive experimental work that led to the creation of a modern production unit in Athens since 2000, has shown that the ancient vases may have been subjected to multiple three-stage firings following repainting or as an attempt to correct color failures
The technique which is mostly known as the &quot;iron reduction technique&quot; was decoded with the contribution of scholars, ceramists and scientists from the mid 18th century onwards to the end of the 20th century, i.e. Comte de Caylus (1752), Durand-Greville (1891), Binns and Fraser (1925), Schumann (1942), Winter (1959), Bimson (1956), Noble (1960, 1965), Hofmann (1962), Oberlies (1968), Pavicevic (1974), Aloupi (1993). More recent studies by Walton et al. (2009), Walton et al. (2014), Lühl et al. (2014) and Chaviara &amp; Aloupi-Siotis (2016) by using advanced analytical techniques provide detailed information on the process and the raw materials used.

=== Vase painting ===
The most familiar aspect of ancient Greek pottery is painted vessels of fine quality. These were not the everyday pottery used by most people but were sufficiently cheap to be accessible to a wide range of the population.

Few examples of ancient Greek painting have survived so modern scholars have to trace the development of ancient Greek art partly through ancient Greek vase-painting, which survives in large quantities and is also, with Ancient Greek literature, the best guide we have to the customary life and mind of the ancient Greeks.

== Development of pottery painting ==

=== Stone Age ===
Greek pottery goes back to the Stone Age, such as those found in Sesklo and Dimini.

=== Bronze Age ===
More elaborate painting on Greek pottery goes back to the Minoan pottery and Mycenaean pottery of the Bronze Age, some later examples of which show the ambitious figurative painting that was to become highly developed and typical.

=== Iron Age ===
After many centuries dominated by styles of geometric decoration, becoming increasingly complex, figurative elements returned in force in the 8th century. From the late 7th century to about 300 BC evolving styles of figure-led painting were at their peak of production and quality and were widely exported.

During the Greek Dark Age, spanning the 11th to 8th centuries BC, the prevalent early style was that of the protogeometric art, predominantly using circular and wavy decorative patterns. This was succeeded in mainland Greece, the Aegean, Anatolia, and Italy by the style of pottery known as geometric art, which employed neat rows of geometric shapes.

The period of Archaic Greece, beginning in the 8th century BC and lasting until the late 5th century BC, saw the birth of the Orientalizing period, led largely by ancient Corinth, where the previous stick-figures of the geometric pottery become fleshed out amid motifs that replaced the geometric patterns.

The classical ceramic decor is dominated mostly by Attic vase painting. Attic production was the first to resume after the Greek Dark Age and influenced the rest of Greece, especially Boeotia, Corinth, the Cyclades (in particular Naxos) and the Ionian colonies in the east Aegean. Production of vases was largely the prerogative of Athens – it is well attested that in Corinth, Boeotia, Argos, Crete and Cyclades, the painters and potters were satisfied to follow the Attic style.
By the end of the Archaic period the styles of black-figure pottery, red-figure pottery and the white ground technique had become fully established and would continue in use during the era of Classical Greece, from the early 5th to late 4th centuries BC. Corinth was eclipsed by Athenian trends since Athens was the progenitor of both the red-figure and white ground styles.

==== Protogeometric styles ====
Vases of the protogeometrical period ( BC) represent the return of craft production after the collapse of the Mycenaean Palace culture and the ensuing Greek dark ages. It is one of the few modes of artistic expression besides jewelry in this period since the sculpture, monumental architecture and mural painting of this era are unknown to us. By 1050 BC life in the Greek peninsula seems to have become sufficiently settled to allow a marked improvement in the production of earthenware. The style is confined to the rendering of circles, triangles, wavy lines and arcs, but placed with evident consideration and notable dexterity, probably aided by compasses and multiple brushes. The site of Lefkandi is one of our most important sources of ceramics from this period where a cache of grave goods has been found giving evidence of a distinctive Euboian protogeometric style which lasted into the early 8th century.

==== Geometric style ====
Geometric art flourished in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. It was characterized by new motifs, breaking with the representation of the Minoan and Mycenaean periods: meanders, triangles and other geometrical decoration (hence the name of the style) as distinct from the predominantly circular figures of the previous style. However, our chronology for this new art form comes from exported wares found in datable contexts overseas.

With the early geometrical style (approximately 900–850 BC) one finds only abstract motifs, in what is called the &quot;Black Dipylon&quot; style, which is characterized by extensive use of black varnish, with the Middle Geometrical (approx. 850–770 BC), figurative decoration makes its appearance: they are initially identical bands of animals such as horses, stags, goats, geese, etc. which alternate with the geometrical bands. In parallel, the decoration becomes complicated and becomes increasingly ornate; the painter feels reluctant to leave empty spaces and fills them with meanders or swastikas. This phase is named horror vacui (fear of the empty) and will not cease until the end of geometrical period.

In the middle of the century there begin to appear human figures, the best known representations of which are those of the vases found in Dipylon, one of the cemeteries of Athens. The fragments of these large funerary vases show mainly processions of chariots or warriors or of the funerary scenes: (; exposure and lamentation of dead) or (; transport of the coffin to the cemetery). The bodies are represented in a geometrical way except for the calves, which are rather protuberant. In the case of soldiers, a shield in form of a diabolo, called &quot;dipylon shield&quot; because of its characteristic drawing, covers the central part of the body. The legs and the necks of the horses, the wheels of the chariots are represented one beside the other without perspective. The hand of this painter, so called in the absence of signature, is the Dipylon Master, could be identified on several pieces, in particular monumental amphorae.

At the end of the period there appear representations of mythology, probably at the moment when Homer codifies the traditions of Trojan cycle in the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Here however the interpretation constitutes a risk for the modern observer: a confrontation between two warriors can be a Homeric duel or simple combat; a failed boat can represent the shipwreck of Odysseus or any hapless sailor.

Lastly, are the local schools that appear in Greece. Production of vases was largely the prerogative of Athens – it is well attested that as in the proto-geometrical period, in Corinth, Boeotia, Argos, Crete and Cyclades, the painters and potters were satisfied to follow the Attic style. From about the 8th century BC on, they created their own styles, Argos specializing in the figurative scenes, Crete remaining attached to a more strict abstraction.

==== Orientalizing style ====
The orientalizing style was the product of cultural ferment in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean of the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Fostered by trade links with the city-states of Asia Minor, the artifacts of the East influenced a highly stylized yet recognizable representational art. Ivories, pottery and metalwork from the Neo-Hittite principalities of northern Syria and Phoenicia found their way to Greece, as did goods from Anatolian Urartu and Phrygia, yet there was little contact with the cultural centers of Egypt or Assyria. The new idiom developed initially in Corinth (as Proto-Corinthian) and later in Athens between 725 BC and 625 BC (as Proto-Attic).

It was characterized by an expanded vocabulary of motifs: sphinx, griffin, lions, etc., as well as a repertory of non-mythological animals arranged in friezes across the belly of the vase. In these friezes, painters also began to apply lotuses or palmettes. Depictions of humans were relatively rare. Those that have been found are figures in silhouette with some incised detail, perhaps the origin of the incised silhouette figures of the black-figure period. There is sufficient detail on these figures to allow scholars to discern a number of different artists&#x27; hands. Geometrical features remained in the style called proto-Corinthian that embraced these Orientalizing experiments, yet which coexisted with a conservative sub-geometric style.

The ceramics of Corinth were exported all over Greece, and their technique arrived in Athens, prompting the development of a less markedly Eastern idiom there. During this time described as Proto-Attic, the orientalizing motifs appear but the features remain not very realistic. The painters show a preference for the typical scenes of the Geometrical Period, like processions of chariots. However, they adopt the principle of line drawing to replace the silhouette. In the middle of the 7th century BC, there appears the black and white style: black figures on a white zone, accompanied by polychromy to render the color of the flesh or clothing. Clay used in Athens was much more orange than that of Corinth, and so did not lend itself as easily to the representation of flesh. Attic Orientalising Painters include the Analatos Painter, the Mesogeia Painter and the Polyphemos Painter.

Crete, and especially the islands of the Cyclades, are characterized by their attraction to the vases known as &quot;plastic&quot;, i.e. those whose paunch or collar is moulded in the shape of head of an animal or a man. At Aegina, the most popular form of the plastic vase is the head of the griffin. The Melanesian amphoras, manufactured at Paros, exhibit little knowledge of Corinthian developments. They present a marked taste for the epic composition and a horror vacui, which is expressed in an abundance of swastikas and meanders.

Finally one can identify the last major style of the period, that of Wild Goat Style, allotted traditionally to Rhodes because of an important discovery within the necropolis of Kameiros. In fact, it is widespread over all of Asia Minor, with centers of production at Miletus and Chios. Two forms prevail oenochoes, which copied bronze models, and dishes, with or without feet. The decoration is organized in superimposed registers in which stylized animals, in particular of feral goats (from whence the name) pursue each other in friezes. Many decorative motifs (floral triangles, swastikas, etc.) fill the empty spaces.

==== Black-figure technique ====

Black-figure is the most commonly imagined when one thinks about Greek pottery. It was a popular style in ancient Greece for many years. The black-figure period coincides approximately with the era designated by Winckelmann as the middle to late Archaic, from to 480 BC. The technique of incising silhouetted figures with enlivening detail which we now call the black-figure method was a Corinthian invention of the 7th century and spread from there to other city states and regions including Sparta, Boeotia, Euboea, the east Greek islands and Athens.

The Corinthian fabric, extensively studied by Humfry Payne and Darrell Amyx, can be traced though the parallel treatment of animal and human figures. The animal motifs have greater prominence on the vase and show the greatest experimentation in the early phase of Corinthian black-figure. As Corinthian artists gained confidence in their rendering of the human figure the animal frieze declined in size relative to the human scene during the middle to late phase. By the mid-6th century BC, the quality of Corinthian ware had fallen away significantly to the extent that some Corinthian potters would disguise their pots with a red slip in imitation of superior Athenian ware.

At Athens researchers have found the earliest known examples of vase painters signing their work, the first being a dinos by Sophilos (illus. below, BM, ), this perhaps indicative of their increasing ambition as artists in producing the monumental work demanded as grave markers, as for example with Kleitias&#x27;s François Vase. Many scholars consider the finest work in the style to belong Exekias and the Amasis Painter, who are noted for their feeling for composition and narrative.

Circa 520 BC the red-figure technique was developed and was gradually introduced in the form of the bilingual vase by the Andokides Painter, Oltos and Psiax. Red-figure quickly eclipsed black-figure, yet in the unique form of the Panathanaic Amphora, black-figure continued to be utilised well into the 4th century BC.

==== Red-figure technique ====
The innovation of the red-figure technique was an Athenian invention of the late 6th century. It was quite the opposite of black-figure which had a red background. The ability to render detail by direct painting rather than incision offered new expressive possibilities to artists such as three-quarter profiles, greater anatomical detail and the representation of perspective.

The first generation of red-figure painters worked in both red- and black-figure as well as other methods including Six&#x27;s technique and white-ground; the latter was developed at the same time as red-figure. However, within twenty years, experimentation had given way to specialization as seen in the vases of the Pioneer Group, whose figural work was exclusively in red-figure, though they retained the use of black-figure for some early floral ornamentation. The shared values and goals of The Pioneers such as Euphronios and Euthymides signal that they were something approaching a self-conscious movement, though they left behind no testament other than their own work. John Boardman said of the research on their work that &quot;the reconstruction of their careers, common purpose, even rivalries, can be taken as an archaeological triumph&quot;.

The next generation of late Archaic vase painters ( to 480 BC) brought an increasing naturalism to the style as seen in the gradual change of the profile eye. This phase also sees the specialization of painters into pot and cup painters, with the Berlin and Kleophrades Painters notable in the former category and Douris and Onesimos in the latter.

By the early to high classical era of red-figure painting ( BC), a number of distinct schools had evolved. The Mannerists associated with the workshop of Myson and exemplified by the Pan Painter hold to the archaic features of stiff drapery and awkward poses and combine that with exaggerated gestures. By contrast, the school of the Berlin Painter in the form of the Achilles Painter and his peers (who may have been the Berlin Painter&#x27;s pupils) favoured a naturalistic pose usually of a single figure against a solid black background or of restrained white-ground lekythoi. Polygnotos and the Kleophon Painter can be included in the school of the Niobid Painter, as their work indicates something of the influence of the Parthenon sculptures both in theme (e.g., Polygnotos&#x27;s centauromachy, Brussels, Musées Royaux A. &amp; Hist., A 134) and in feeling for composition.

Toward the end of the century, the &quot;Rich&quot; style of Attic sculpture as seen in the Nike Balustrade is reflected in contemporary vase painting with an ever-greater attention to incidental detail, such as hair and jewellery. The Meidias Painter is usually most closely identified with this style.

Vase production in Athens stopped around 330–320 BC possibly due to Alexander the Great&#x27;s control of the city, and had been in slow decline over the 4th century along with the political fortunes of Athens itself. However, vase production continued in the 4th and 3rd centuries in the Greek colonies of southern Italy where five regional styles may be distinguished. These are the Apulian, Lucanian, Sicilian, Campanian and Paestan. Red-figure work flourished there with the distinctive addition of polychromatic painting and in the case of the Black Sea colony of Panticapeum the gilded work of the Kerch Style. Several noteworthy artists&#x27; work comes down to us including the Darius Painter and the Underworld Painter, both active in the late 4th century, whose crowded polychromatic scenes often essay a complexity of emotion not attempted by earlier painters. Their work represents a late mannerist phase to the achievement of Greek vase painting.

==== White ground technique ====
The white-ground technique was developed at the end of the 6th century BC. Unlike the better-known black-figure and red-figure techniques, its coloration was not achieved through the application and firing of slips but through the use of paints and gilding on a surface of white clay. It allowed for a higher level of polychromy than the other techniques, although the vases end up less visually striking. The technique gained great importance during the 5th and 4th centuries, especially in the form of small &quot;lekythoi&quot; that became typical grave offerings. Important representatives include its inventor, the Achilles Painter, as well as Psiax, the Pistoxenos Painter, and the Thanatos Painter.
==== Relief and plastic vases ====
Relief and plastic vases became particularly popular in the 4th century BC and continued being manufactured in the Hellenistic period. They were inspired by the so-called &quot;rich style&quot; developed mainly in Attica after 420 BC. The main features were the multi-figured compositions with use of added colours (pink/reddish, blue, green, gold) and an emphasis on female mythological figures. Theatre and performing constituted yet one more source of inspiration.

Delphi Archaeological Museum has some particularly good examples of this style, including a vase with Aphrodite and Eros. The base is round, cylindrical, and its handle vertical, with bands, covered with black colour. The female figure (Aphrodite) is depicted seated, wearing an himation. Next to her stands a male figure, naked and winged. Both figures wear wreaths made of leaves and their hair preserve traces of golden paint. The features of their faces are stylized. The vase has a white ground and maintains in several parts the traces of bluish, greenish and reddish paint. It dates to the 4th century BC.

In the same room is kept a small lekythos with a plastic decoration, depicting a winged dancer. The figure wears a Persian head cover and an oriental dress, indicating that already in that period oriental dancers, possibly slaves, had become quite fashionable. The figure is also covered with a white colour. The total height of the vase is 18 centimeters and it dates to the 4th century BC.

=== Hellenistic period ===
The Hellenistic period, ushered in by the conquests of Alexander the Great, saw the virtual disappearance of black and red-figure pottery yet also the emergence of new styles such as West Slope Ware in the east, the Centuripe ware in Sicily, and the Gnathia vases to the west. Outside of mainland Greece other regional Greek traditions developed, such as those in Magna Graecia with the various styles in South Italy, including Apulian, Lucanian, Paestan, Campanian, and Sicilian.

== Inscriptions ==

Inscriptions on Greek pottery are of two kinds; the incised (the earliest of which are contemporary with the beginnings of the Greek alphabet in the 8th century BC), and the painted, which only begin to appear a century later. Both forms are relatively common on painted vases until the Hellenistic period when the practice of inscribing pots seems to die out. They are by far most frequently found on Attic pottery.

A number of sub-classes of inscription can be distinguished. Potters and painters occasionally signed their works with &quot;epoiesen&quot; and &quot;egraphsen&quot; respectively. Trademarks are found from the start of the 6th century on Corinthian pieces; these may have belonged to an exporting merchant rather than the pottery workfield and this remains a matter of conjecture. Patrons&#x27; names are also sometimes recorded, as are the names of characters and objects depicted. At times we may find a snatch of dialogue to accompany a scene, as in &#x27;Dysniketos&#x27;s horse has won&#x27;, announces a herald on a Panathenaic amphora (BM, B 144). More puzzling, however, are the &quot;kalos&quot; and &quot;kalee&quot; inscriptions, which might have formed part of courtship ritual in Athenian high society, yet are found on a wide variety of vases not necessarily associated with a social setting. Finally there are abecedaria and nonsense inscriptions, though these are largely confined to black-figure pots.

== Figurines ==
Greek terracotta figurines were another important type of pottery, initially mostly religious, but increasingly representing purely decorative subjects. The so-called Tanagra figurines, in fact made elsewhere as well, are one of the most important types. Earlier figurines were usually votive offerings at temples.

== Relationship to metalwork and other materials ==
Several clay vases owed their inspiration to metalwork forms in bronze, silver and sometimes gold. These were increasingly used by the elite when dining, but were not placed in graves, where they would have been robbed, and were often treated as a store of value to be traded as bullion when needed. Very few metal vessels have survived as at some point they were melted down and the metal reused.

In recent decades many scholars have questioned the conventional relationship between the two materials, seeing much more production of painted vases than was formerly thought as made to be placed in graves, as a cheaper substitute for metalware in both Greece and Etruria. The painting itself may also copy that on metal vessels more closely than was thought.

The Derveni Krater, from near Thessaloniki, is a large bronze volute krater from about 320 BC, weighing 40 kilograms, and finely decorated with a 32-centimetre-tall frieze of figures in relief representing Dionysus surrounded by Ariadne and her procession of satyrs and maenads.

The alabastron&#x27;s name derives from alabaster, from which it was originally made. Glass was also used, mostly for fancy small perfume bottles, though some Hellenistic glass rivalled metalwork in quality and probably price.

<doc id="1076010" wikidata="Q312977" url="?curid=1076010" title="Phillip Allen Sharp">
<text>Phillip Allen Sharp (born June 6, 1944) is an American geneticist and molecular biologist who co-discovered RNA splicing. He shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Richard J. Roberts for &quot;the discovery that genes in eukaryotes are not contiguous strings but contain introns, and that the splicing of messenger RNA to delete those introns can occur in different ways, yielding different proteins from the same DNA sequence&quot;. He has been selected to receive the 2015 Othmer Gold Medal.

Sharp&#x27;s current research focuses on small RNAs and other types of non-coding RNAs. His laboratory works to identify the target mRNAs of microRNAs (miRNAs), and has discovered a class of miRNAs that are produced from sequences adjacent to transcription start sites. His laboratory also studies how miRNA gene regulation functions in angiogenesis and cellular stress.

==Biography==
Sharp was born in Falmouth, Kentucky, the son of Kathrin (Colvin) and Joseph Walter Sharp. He married Ann Holcombe in 1964, and they have three daughters.

Sharp studied at Union College and majored in chemistry and mathematics, afterwards completing his Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1969. Following his Ph.D., he did his postdoctoral training at the California Institute of Technology until 1971, where he studied plasmids. Later, he studied gene expression in human cells at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as a senior scientist under James D. Watson.

In 1974, he was offered a position at MIT by biologist Salvador Luria. He was director of MIT&#x27;s Center for Cancer Research (now the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research) from 1985 to 1991; head of the Biology department from 1991 to 1999; and founder and director of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research from 2000 to 2004. In 1995, the FBI confirmed that Sharp received a letter from Ted Kaczynski, insinuating that Sharp would become a target of the Unabomber because of his work in genetics, stating that &quot;it would be beneficial to your health to stop your research in genetics.&quot; 

He is currently MIT Institute Professor and Professor of Biology Emeritus and member of the Koch Institute, and was an Institute Professor, MIT&#x27;s highest faculty rank, since 1999. He is also the chair of the advisory board of the MIT Jameel Clinic. Sharp co-founded Biogen, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, and Magen Biosciences, and has served on the boards of all three companies.

==Awards and honors==

In addition to the Nobel Prize, Sharp has won several notable awards, including the 2004 National Medal of Science, the 1999 Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences of the American Philosophical Society, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1981, and the 1988 Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Thomas R. Cech.

Sharp is an elected member of several academic societies, including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2011. In 2012, he was elected the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is also a Member and Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of Fidelity Biosciences Group; a member of the Board of Advisors of Polaris Venture Partners; chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board and member of the Board of Directors of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals; advisor and investor at Longwood and Polaris Venture Funds; a member of the Boards of Directors at Syros Pharmaceuticals and VIR Biotechnology; and member and Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board at Dewpoint Biotechnology.

He is the subject of the 2025 documentary film &quot;Cracking the Code:Phil Sharp and the Biotech Revolution&quot; directed by Bill Haney. 

Pendleton County, Kentucky, Sharp&#x27;s birthplace, named its current middle school after him.

==Other activities==
In October 2010, Sharp participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students got to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch. Sharp is also a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Advisory Board. In 2011, he was listed at #5 on the MIT150 list of the top 150 innovators and ideas from MIT.

He is an editorial advisor to Xconomy, and is a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. He has also served on the Faculty Advisory Board of the MIT-Harvard Research Journal and MIT Student Research Association.

In 2016, Sharp helped organize the Laureates Letter Supporting Precision Agriculture, written to oppose efforts by Greenpeace to ban GMOs and Golden Rice in particular.

Greytown was first settled on 27 March 1854 under the Small Farms Association Settlement Scheme and was named after Governor Sir George Grey, who arranged for the land to be bought from local Māori. It became a Borough in 1878 and a ward of the South Wairarapa District Council in 1989.

The first Arbor Day celebration in New Zealand was held in Greytown on 3 July 1890. Greytown Beautification Society has done a lot to keep the spirit alive for many years, especially Stella Bull Park and the park bench in the park dedicated to her, which states, &quot;Only God can make a Tree&quot;. The town has many beautiful trees and a register is kept to help protect them. The Tree Advisory Group to the Greytown Community Board actively works to preserve trees and the historic tree register is in the process of being updated in collaboration with the Greytown Community Board and South Wairarapa District Council.

===Marae and Māori Parliament===

Pāpāwai Marae is located east of Greytown. It is affiliated with the Ngāti Kahungunu hapū of Ngāti Kahukuranui o Kahungunu Kauiti, Ngāti Meroiti and Ngāti Moe, and the Rangitāne hapū of Ngāti Meroiti, Ngāti Moe, Ngāti Tauiao and Ngāti Tūkoko.

The marae&#x27;s meeting house, named Hikurangi, dates from 1888 and is unique in that the magnificent carved ancestors that surround the pā face inward. In the late 19th century the wharenui was an important site of Te Kotahitanga, the Māori parliament movement. In the 1890s sessions were held at Pāpāwai, and were reported in &quot;Huia Tangata Kotahi&quot;, a Māori-language newspaper published by Īhāia Hūtana from 1893 to 1895. A large building was constructed at Pāpāwai to house the parliament, used for sessions in 1897 and 1898. The parliament passed a resolution to end the sale of Māori land and was visited by Governor General Lord Ranfurly, and by Premier Richard Seddon. From the 1910s Pāpāwai fell into disrepair, and little was done until the 1960s when conservation work was carried out on the carved figures. In the late 1980s the marae was fully restored, and is again in full use by the community.

The Māori name for Greytown is Hūpēnui, the literal translation of which is &quot;the big snot&quot;, better translated as &quot;the fluid that comes out of your nose at a tangi or funeral&quot;.

In October 2020, the Government committed $2,179,654 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Ngāi Tumapuhia a Rangi ki Okautete, Motuwairaka, Pāpāwai, Kohunui, Hurunui o Rangi and Te Oreore marae. The projects were expected to create 19.8 full time jobs.

== Demographics ==
Greytown covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

== Economy ==

=== Tourism ===
Greytown is a popular weekend and holiday destination. The main street has a number of boutique, antique stores and cafés. The official camping ground next to the soldiers&#x27; memorial park is very popular during long weekends and holidays. Swimming is free at the Greytown Memorial Park which remains a monument to the men of Greytown who gave their lives in both World Wars. Within the park are 117 lime trees, planted in 1922 to commemorate the 117 soldiers from the community who died in WW1. With cycling becoming increasingly popular the Woodside Rail Trail is a regular spot for visitors. The 5 km rail trail winds through quiet farmland, native plantings and heritage trees to Woodside Station, with great views of the Tararua Ranges.

=== Horticulture ===
Greytown was marketed as &quot;The fruit bowl of the Wairarapa&quot; when fruit was grown on the west of the town with orchards like Westhaven and Pinehaven.

The Kidds came to Greytown in 1906 from Wanganui where they had been engaged in fruit growing. In 1910 they bought a twenty-acre farmlet in Udy Street which he planted with a mixture of soft fruits (blackcurrants &amp; gooseberries) and apple trees. They made the improvement to the orchard, their main purpose in life, continually experimenting with propagating new varieties of apples. Their experiments with cross pollination resulted in the fixing of several commercial varieties, the most notable of which are the Kidd’s Orange Red, Freyburg and Gala which is grown worldwide.

== Image and architecture==
The town is proud of its history, claiming to have the most complete main street of Victorian architecture in the country, and of being the first planned inland town. It has played on these assets, creating a revival largely based on its architecture. Retailers like the butcher have changed their 1970s street frontage to a more Victorian one. The town recognises that buildings need to be maintained in order to maintain the town&#x27;s charm and in 2016–2017 six significant building were restored/painted. This formed part of Greytown&#x27;s submission for the most beautiful small town in New Zealand.

Cobblestones Museum, a regional history museum, on 167 Main Street, contains six Historic Places Trust category 2 buildings. In 2014 it opened a new exhibition building which showcases Greytown and Wairarapa history. It has embarked on an ambitious plan to restore all the listed buildings under conservation plans and now ranks as the top thing to see in Greytown on Trip Advisor.

Heritage buildings are recorded by the Greytown Heritage Trust. The Greytown Heritage Trust was formed with the primary object of encouraging and facilitating the preservation of historic buildings in and around Greytown, with particular attention being given to the Greytown Historic Heritage Precinct as defined in the Wairarapa Combined District Plan. The Greytown Hotel claims to be one of New Zealand&#x27;s oldest surviving hotels.

One of the Victorian-style buildings on Main Street is The White Swan Hotel. This building was originally constructed in 1905 as a railways administration block in Woburn, Lower Hutt. In 2002, it was cut into six sections, transported over the Remutaka Hill road, re-assembled and renovated to become a hotel, restaurant and bar.

== Transport ==
The town is linked to Wellington and Masterton by New Zealand State Highway 2, a scenic mountain route peaking at the Remutaka summit.

The town was previously linked to Wellington and Masterton by a branch rail line.

In the 1870s, when the Public Works Department announced that the Wairarapa Line railway between Featherston and Masterton was not going to pass through Greytown, local protests were successful in attaining approval for a branch line from the Wairarapa Line at Woodside, which opened on 14 May 1880. For a few months Greytown was the terminus of the Wairarapa Line, but once the extension from Woodside to Masterton opened on 1 November 1880, the branch was one of the quietest railway lines in the country.

The branch line closed on 24 December 1953, and at the time of closure its revenue was only a tenth of its operating costs. Greytown passengers are now serviced by Woodside Railway Station on the Wairarapa Line.

== Education ==
Greytown has two schools:
* Greytown School is a state full primary (Year 1–8) school with students as of It was established in 1857.
* Kuranui College is a state secondary (Year 9–13) school with students as of It was established in 1960, replacing the district high schools in Carterton, Greytown, Featherston and Martinborough.

== Sport==

Greytown Rugby club, established in 1877, is one of the oldest in the country. New Zealand rugby representatives from the Greytown club were:

* Hart Udy (1884)
* Dan Udy (1901–03)
* Rawi Cundy (1929)
* Clinton Stringfellow (1929)
* Ben Couch (1947–49)
* Marty Berry (1986–93)

Cricket has a long history in Greytown. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1867, festivities at Greytown included men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cricket matches – the first known instance of women&#x27;s cricket in New Zealand. Greytown Cricket Club, established later in 1867, is the second-oldest cricket club in New Zealand, and 10 years older than Test cricket. It has been the powerhouse of the Wairarapa competition, with all three Senior teams winning their competitions in the 2005–06 season, and almost repeating the feat (two out of three) in 2006–07.

There are over 30 sports clubs in Greytown which come under the umbrella of Greytown Community Sport and Leisure Society, a volunteer organisation.

The Wellington Gliding Club operates from the Greytown Soaring Centre in Papawai, approximately 4 km east of Greytown on Tilsons Road.

<text>The Sinclair Executive was the world&#x27;s first &quot;slimline&quot; pocket calculator, and the first to be produced by Clive Sinclair&#x27;s company Sinclair Radionics. Introduced in 1972, the calculator was produced in at least two versions with different keyboard markings; a variant called the Sinclair Executive Memory was introduced in 1973.

Its small size was made possible by pulsing current to the Texas Instruments TMS1802 &quot;calculator on a chip&quot; integrated circuit, reducing the power consumption more than tenfold. The Executive was highly successful, making of profit for Sinclair and winning a Design Council Award for Electronics.

==History==
The Executive was launched in September 1972 at the price of plus VAT, equivalent to £ in when adjusted for inflation. This was around half the price of comparable calculators, but still twice the average weekly wage. It was the first pocket calculator, and the first to be mass-produced, and its introduction to the market coincided with a number of other companies entering the calculator market.

The entrepreneur Clive Sinclair, reckoning that the market for &quot;executive toys&quot; was not especially sensitive to price, ordered components for 100,000 calculators. The Executive was highly successful, and made £1.8million profit for his company Sinclair Radionics. It was well received by both domestic and foreign markets, and worth of Executives were sold in Japan in early 1974 at six times the price of Japanese models. The parts, consisting of the TMS1802 chip, 22 transistors, 50 resistors and 17 capacitors, cost close to , compared with a sale price of almost . The Executive impressed the engineers at Texas Instruments, who had used the same chip to produce a longer and wider calculator that was over three times as thick and a great deal more expensive. In 1974, sales of the Executive exceeded , and Sinclair was producing 100,000 calculators each month, of which 55% were exported.

A Sinclair Executive purchased by a Russian diplomat exploded in his breast pocket, allegedly leading to an official Soviet investigation. It was found that it had been left on by accident, leading to a current drain on the batteries that overheated them until they burst.

==Design==
The calculator was significantly smaller than any of its competitors, and the first that could easily be carried in a pocket. According to a Sinclair executive quoted in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;one must always bear a packet of cigarettes in mind as the ideal size&quot;, possibly a quip on Clive Sinclair&#x27;s smoking habit. The Executive weighed and measured . The case, designed by Iain Sinclair, was made of black injection-moulded polycarbonate and required flexible glue to hold the two halves together.

&quot;Design Magazine&quot; described it as &quot;at once a conversation piece, a rich man&#x27;s plaything and a functional business machine&quot;. One Executive is on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and the futuristic design earned it the Design Council Award for Electronics in 1973. It was the first calculator designed for aesthetic appeal, and &quot;New Scientist&quot; described it as &quot;not so much a professional calculator – more a piece of personal jewellery&quot;.

===Functions===
As well as four-function arithmetic, the Executive could compute squares, reciprocals, and multiply or divide by a fixed constant. The Executive could display results to two, four, or six decimal places, or use a floating decimal point.

===Microprocessor===
The calculator was powered by a Texas Instruments TMC1802NC, a metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit with 7,000 transistors. This CPU normally consumes 350 milliwatts, but by pulsing the power this requirement was reduced to 20 milliwatts. It was discovered that an early prototype continued to work if the batteries were disconnected and then reapplied quickly enough, as the capacitors in the circuit could hold a charge for up to five seconds.

Power is supplied to the chip in 1.7-microsecond pulses as determined by the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kHz between each operation means shut-off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to more than 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1,000 such changes. This extended battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing-aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.

===Screen===
The screen was a monolithic seven-segment gallium arsenide light emitting diode display bought from a Canadian firm. The small screen reduced the power consumption and material costs, but it was revised several times in pursuit of lower power consumption, creating reliability problems.

==Executive Memory==
The Executive Memory was launched in November 1973, with the same dimensions as the original, but with the ability to memorise subtotals from any number of chain calculations. There were at least three versions, including the black and white Type 1, and the Type 2 with a gold keyboard. The Executive Memory sold at the lower price of .

<text>Kazimierz Stanisław Świtalski (; 4 March 1886 – 28 December 1962) was a Polish politician, diplomat, soldier, military officer in the Polish Legions and 18th Prime Minister of Poland between April and December 1929.

==Early life and studies==
Kazimierz Świtalski was born on 4 March 1886 as the son of Albin Świtalski, governor of Rudki and Sanok, and his second wife Marie Antoinette Veith, whose grandfather, by the order of Emperor Francis I, arrived in Austrian Poland in 1834, together with eight other German families. Between 1897 and 1904 Kazimierz attended the Queen Sofia High School located in Sanok (his classmates included Zdzisław Adamczyk, Witold Fusek, Bolesław Mozołowski and Bronisław Praszałowicz). At that time, the school was led by the Organization called &quot;Radius&quot; (also participating in the organization were brothers Stefan and Włodzimierz Mozołowski and Samuel Herzig). On 21 June 1904 Świtalski received a certificate of maturity with honors and began studying at the Faculty of Philology at the Polish Academy in Lwów. After graduation, he received a doctorate of philosophy in 1910. In the same year he became a professor at a local high school called &quot;gymnasium&quot;.

==Polish Legions==
Even in his youth Świtalski belonged to an organization of socialist independence parties called &quot;Flame&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;. Along with Stanisław Kot he directed the work of the Representative Commission of Progressive Youth. In 1910 Świtalski joined the &quot;Związek Walki Czynnej&quot; (ZWC), an underground organisation formed by future Marshal of Poland and chief-of-state Józef Piłsudski and since October 1912 he was a member of the Rifle Association. In ZWC for the first time he met with Józef Piłsudski. Shortly before the outbreak of World War I, he was an adjutant for Marian Kukiel at the Headquarters of the Rifle Associations in Eastern Galicia and Lwów. From 24 August until 27 October 1914 he was a soldier in the Polish Legions. On 4 November 1914, he was appointed to the rank of lieutenant. Since February 1915 he served as a military office clerk in the Military Department.

From 5 January 1916 he was the head of the office of the Legion Brigade Headquarters. He held this position until the Oath crisis. On 9 July 1917, he was arrested, and four days later dismissed from service in the Legions. As a result, he went to Lwów, where on 1 September, he joined the Polish Military Organization. During the Polish–Ukrainian War he became a member of the Polish National Committee, which played a major role in the conflict. Then he managed to escape from the besieged city with an aircraft. He went to a nearby city called Przemyśl, and later to Kraków, where he sought help for Lwów. By mid December 1918 he took part in the work of the Polish Liquidation Committee and the Interim Governing Committee.

==Political and diplomatic career==

During the 1926 May Coup d&#x27;état in Poland, Świtalski supported Marshal Piłsudski, rather than President Stanisław Wojciechowski. Following the Coup, he was given several political posts. In the same year he appointed the Head of the Civil Chancellery of the President and between 1926 and 1928 he was the director of the Political Department of the Ministry of the Interior. In June 1928 Świtalski became Minister of Education and from April to December 1929 he served as Prime Minister of Poland in competition with Kazimierz Bartel. In 1930 he was elected to the Sejm and between 1933 and 1935 he was its Marshal. He was appointed by the President to the Senate in 1935, where he was also Vice-Marshal. In parallel, he was also the Voivode of Kraków from December 1935 until April 1936.

After the Polish Defensive War of 1939 Kazimierz Świtalski was taken prisoner of war and taken to Woldenberg camp, where he spent the entirety of World War II. His only child, Jacek Świtalski, was killed on the first day of the Warsaw Uprising. In 1945 he returned to Poland and was imprisoned by the communist authorities from 1948 to 1956. He died in Warsaw in 1962, following injuries in a tram accident.

==Honours and awards==
Kazimierz Świtalski was awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Virtuti Militari, the Order of Polonia Restituta Classes I and IV, Cross of Independence, the War Memorial Medal 1918 – 1921 and the Decade of Independence Medal, as well as the Estonian Order of the Cross of the Eagle Class I (1934).

<doc id="1076023" wikidata="Q298027" url="?curid=1076023" title="Minna Canth">
<text>Minna Canth (; born Ulrika Wilhelmina Johnson; 19 March 1844 – 12 May 1897) was a Finnish writer and social activist. Canth began to write while managing her family draper&#x27;s shop and living as a widow raising seven children. Her work addresses issues of women&#x27;s rights, particularly in the context of a prevailing culture she considered antithetical to permitting expression and realization of women&#x27;s aspirations. &quot;The Worker&#x27;s Wife&quot; and &quot;The Pastor&#x27;s Family&quot; are her best known plays, but the play &quot;Anna Liisa&quot; is the most adapted to the films and operas. In her time, she became a controversial figure, due to the asynchrony between her ideas and those of her time, and in part due to her strong advocacy for her point of view.

Minna Canth was the first major Finnish-language playwright and prose writer after Aleksis Kivi, the national author of Finland, and the first Finnish-language newspaper woman. She was also the first woman to receive her own flag flying day in Finland, starting on 19 March 2007. It is also the day of social equality in Finland.

==Life and career==
Canth was born in Tampere to Gustaf Vilhelm Johnsson (1816–1877) and his wife Ulrika (1811–1893). Her father worked at James Finlayson&#x27;s textile factory initially as a worker and later as a foreman. Gustaf and Ulrika had four children, Minna included, of whom the eldest, Adolf, died in infancy. Minna&#x27;s surviving siblings were Gustaf (1850–1894) and Augusta (1852–1877). In 1853 her father was given charge of Finlayson&#x27;s textile shop in Kuopio and the entire family relocated there.

Canth received an exceptionally thorough education for a working-class woman of her time. Even before moving to Kuopio she had attended school at Finlayson&#x27;s factory which was intended for the workers&#x27; children. In Kuopio she continued to go to various girls&#x27; schools and as a testament to her father&#x27;s success as a shopkeeper, she was even admitted into a school intended for upper class children. In 1863 she began her studies at the recently founded Jyväskylä Teacher Seminary, which was the first school in Finland to offer higher education for women.

In 1865 she married her natural sciences teacher, Johan Ferdinand Canth (1835–1879), and had to drop out of the Seminary. Between 1866 and 1880 she gave birth to seven children: Anni (1866–1911), Elli (1868–1944), Hanna (1870–1889), Maiju (1872–1943), Jussi (1874–1929), Pekka (1876–1959) and Lyyli (1880–1969); her husband Johan died in 1879 shortly before the birth of the family&#x27;s seventh child. She began her writing career at the newspaper &quot;Keski-Suomi&quot;, where her husband worked as an editor. She wrote about women&#x27;s issues and advocated temperance. In 1876 the Canths were forced to leave the paper because Minna&#x27;s writings had roused some bad blood; they were, however, both employed by the competing Päijänne the following year. Minna published her first works of fiction on the pages of Päijänne: various short stories, which were compiled in her first book, &quot;Novelleja ja kertomuksia&quot;, in 1878.
Canth died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 53 on May 12, 1897 at her home in Kuopio. She was buried in a family grave in Kuopio Cemetery.

==Debate==

Canth stood out when there was public debate about women&#x27;s rights. In 1885 a bishop had argued that God&#x27;s order required that women were not emancipated. The writer Gustaf af Geijerstam then argued that men could only aspire to one day have the purity of women because they were fundamentally different and this was the reason for prostitution and other immorality. Canth objected strongly to this argument as it meant that men could defend their poor morals by reference to their implicit shortcomings, whereas any women involved in prostitution would lack the same defence.

== Most important works==

Minna Canth published a total of ten plays, seven short stories, as well as newspaper articles and speeches. As a central representative of realism of her time, she mainly looked at the ills of society in her works. Canth&#x27;s most important works are the plays &quot;Työmiehen vaimo&quot; (&quot;The Worker&#x27;s Wife&quot;) from 1885 and &quot;Anna Liisa&quot;, penned in 1895.

In &quot;Työmiehen vaimo&quot;, the main character Johanna is married to Risto, an alcoholic who wastes all his wife&#x27;s money. Johanna cannot prevent him – her money is legally his, not hers. The play&#x27;s premiere caused scandal, but a few months later, parliament enacted a new law about separation of property.

&quot;Anna Liisa&quot; is a tragedy about a fifteen-year-old girl who gets pregnant without being married – she manages to hide her pregnancy, and when the child is born, she suffocates it in a fit of panic. Her boyfriend Mikko&#x27;s mother helps her – she buries the baby in the woods, but a few years later, when Anna Liisa wants to marry her fiancé Johannes, she is blackmailed by Mikko and his mother. They threaten her to reveal her dark secret if she does not agree to marry Mikko, but Anna Liisa refuses. In the end, she decides to confess what she has done. She is taken to prison, but is much relieved after owning up and seems to have found peace.

==In popular culture==
A two-part television mini-series about Minna Canth called &quot;Minna&quot;, written by and directed by , was released in 1977. In the mini-series, Minna Canth is played by .

In 2022, an opera called &quot;Minnan taivas&quot; about Minna&#x27;s life and work was staged in Finland, written by Veera Airas with composer Jukka Linkola.

==Tribute==
Canth is remembered in Finland through placenames, publications, medals, commemorative coins, stamps, paintings, plays, exhibitions and events. Many different construction sites and places have been named after her, along with cultural clubs and other communities. The Finnish Fair Foundation (&quot;Suomen Messusäätiö&quot;) has funded the Minna Canth Prize, which is awarded annually to the &quot;shaker of our society&quot; at the Helsinki Book Fair. The prize is 5,000 euros.

Statues of Minna Canth have been erected in Kuopio, Tampere and Jyväskylä; the statue in Kuopio was unveiled on 12 May 1937. The city of Kuopio has also organized Canth&#x27;s anniversaries on several occasions, such as an event called &quot;Minnan päivät&quot; (&quot;Days of Minna&quot;), either during the tenth anniversary of her birth or death; for example, the 21st century has already been celebrated twice, in 2004 and 2007.

On 19 March 2017, Google celebrated her 173rd birthday with a Google Doodle.

<doc id="1076026" wikidata="Q3140966" url="?curid=1076026" title="Angel problem">
<text>The angel problem is a question in combinatorial game theory proposed by John Horton Conway. The game is commonly referred to as the angels and devils game. The game is played by two players called the angel and the devil. It is played on an infinite chessboard (or equivalently the points of a 2D lattice). The angel has a power &quot;k&quot; (a natural number 1 or higher), specified before the game starts. The board starts empty with the angel in one square. On each turn, the angel jumps to a different empty square which could be reached by at most &quot;k&quot; moves of a chess king, i.e. the distance from the starting square is at most &quot;k&quot; in the infinity norm. The devil, on its turn, may add a block on any single square not containing the angel. The angel may leap over blocked squares, but cannot land on them. The devil wins if the angel is unable to move. The angel wins by surviving indefinitely.

The angel problem is: can an angel with high enough power win?

There must exist a winning strategy for one of the players. If the devil can force a win then it can do so in a finite number of moves. If the devil cannot force a win then there is always an action that the angel can take to avoid losing and a winning strategy for it is always to pick such a move. More abstractly, the &quot;pay-off set&quot; (i.e., the set of all plays in which the angel wins) is a closed set (in the natural topology on the set of all plays), and it is known that such games are determined. Of course, for any infinite game, if player 2 doesn&#x27;t have a winning strategy, player 1 can always pick a move that leads to a position where player 2 doesn&#x27;t have a winning strategy, but in some games, simply playing forever doesn&#x27;t confer a win to player 1, so undetermined games may exist.

Conway offered a reward for a general solution to this problem ($100 for a winning strategy for an angel of sufficiently high power, and $1000 for a proof that the devil can win irrespective of the angel&#x27;s power). Progress was made first in higher dimensions. In late 2006, the original problem was solved when independent proofs appeared, showing that an angel can win. Bowditch proved that a 4-angel (that is, an angel with power &quot;k&quot; = 4) can win and Máthé and Kloster gave proofs that a 2-angel can win.

== History ==
The problem was first published in the 1982 book &quot;Winning Ways&quot; by Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy, under the name &quot;the angel and the square-eater.&quot;
In two dimensions, some early partial results included:

* If the angel has power 1, the devil has a winning strategy (Conway, 1982). (According to Conway, this result is actually due to Berlekamp.) This can be read at section 1.1 of Kutz&#x27;s paper.
* If the angel never decreases its y coordinate, then the devil has a winning strategy (Conway, 1982).
* If the angel always increases its distance from the origin, then the devil has a winning strategy (Conway, 1996).

In three dimensions, it was shown that:

* If the angel always increases its y coordinate, and the devil can only play in one plane, then the angel has a winning strategy.
* If the angel always increases its y coordinate, and the devil can only play in two planes, then the angel has a winning strategy.
* The angel has a winning strategy if it has power 13 or more.
* If we have an infinite number of devils each playing at distances formula_1 then the angel can still win if it is of high enough power. (By &quot;playing at distance formula_2&quot; we mean the devil is not allowed to play within this distance of the origin).

Finally, in 2006 
(not long after the publication of Peter Winkler&#x27;s book &quot;Mathematical Puzzles&quot;, which helped publicize the angel problem)
there emerged four independent and almost simultaneous proofs that the angel has a winning strategy in two dimensions.
Brian Bowditch&#x27;s proof works for the 4-angel, while Oddvar Kloster&#x27;s proof and András Máthé&#x27;s proof work for the 2-angel. Additionally, Peter Gacs has a claimed proof which requires a much stronger angel; the details are fairly complex and have not been reviewed by a journal for accuracy. The proofs by Bowditch and Máthé have been published in &quot;Combinatorics, Probability and Computing&quot;. The proof by Kloster has been published in &quot;Theoretical Computer Science&quot;.

== Further unsolved questions ==

In 3D, given that the angel always increases its &quot;y&quot;-coordinate, and that the devil is limited to three planes, it is unknown whether the devil has a winning strategy.

== Proof sketches ==

=== Kloster&#x27;s 2-angel proof ===

Oddvar Kloster discovered a constructive algorithm to solve the problem with a 2-angel. This algorithm is quite simple and also optimal, since, as noted above, the devil has a winning strategy against a 1-angel.

We start out by drawing a vertical line immediately to the left of the angel&#x27;s starting position, down to formula_3 and up to formula_4. This line represents the path the angel will take, which will be updated after each of the devil&#x27;s moves, and partitions the board&#x27;s squares into a &quot;left set&quot; and a &quot;right set.&quot; Once a square becomes part of the left set, it will remain so for the remainder of the game, and the angel will not make any future moves to any of these squares. Every time the devil blocks off a new square, we search over all possible modifications to the path such that we move one or more squares in the right set which the devil has blocked off into the left set. We will only do this if the path increases in length by no more than twice the number of blocked squares moved into the left set. Of such qualifying paths, we choose one that moves the greatest number of blocked off squares into the left set. The angel then makes two steps along this path, keeping the path to its left when moving in the forward direction (so if the devil were not blocking off squares, the angel would travel north indefinitely). Note that when going clockwise around a corner, the angel will not move for one step, because the two segments touching the corner have the same square to their right.

=== Máthé&#x27;s 2-angel proof ===

Máthé introduces the &quot;nice devil,&quot; which never destroys a square that
the angel could have chosen to occupy on an earlier turn. When the angel plays against the nice devil it concedes defeat if the devil manages to confine it to a finite bounded region of the board (otherwise the angel could just hop back and forth between two squares and never lose).
Máthé&#x27;s proof breaks into two parts:

#he shows that if the angel wins against the nice devil, then the angel wins against the real devil;
#he gives an explicit winning strategy for the angel against the nice devil.

Roughly speaking, in the second part, the angel wins against the nice devil by
pretending that the entire left half-plane is destroyed
(in addition to any squares actually destroyed by the nice devil),
and treating destroyed squares as the walls of a maze,
which it then skirts by means of a &quot;hand-on-the-wall&quot; technique.
That is, the angel keeps its left hand on the wall of the maze
and runs alongside the wall.
One then proves that a nice devil cannot trap an angel that adopts this strategy.

The proof of the first part is by contradiction, and hence Máthé&#x27;s proof does not immediately
yield an explicit winning strategy against the real devil.
However, Máthé remarks that his proof could in principle be adapted to give such an explicit strategy.

=== Bowditch&#x27;s 4-angel proof ===

Brian Bowditch defines a variant (game 2) of the original game with the following rule changes:

# The angel can return to any square it has already been to, even if the devil subsequently tried to block it.
# A k-devil must visit a square k times before it is blocked.
# The angel moves either up, down, left or right by one square (a duke move).
# To win, the angel must trace out a circuitous path (defined below).

A circuitous path is a path formula_5 where formula_6 is a semi-infinite arc (a non self-intersecting path with a starting point but no ending point) and formula_7 are pairwise disjoint loops with the following property:

* formula_8 where formula_9 is the length of the ith loop.

(To be well defined formula_10 must begin and end at the end point of formula_11 and formula_11 must end at the starting point of formula_13.)

Bowditch considers a variant (game 1) of the game with the changes 2 and 3 with a 5-devil. He then shows that a winning strategy in this game will yield a winning strategy in our original game for a 4-angel. He then goes on to show that an angel playing a 5-devil (game 2) can achieve a win using a fairly simple algorithm.

Bowditch claims that a 4-angel can win the original version of the game by imagining a phantom angel playing a 5-devil in the game 2.

The angel follows the path the phantom would take but avoiding the loops. Hence as the path formula_14 is a semi-infinite arc the angel does not return to any square it has previously been to and so the path is a winning path even in the original game.

=== 3D version of the problem ===

==== &quot;Guardian&quot; proof ====

The proof, which shows that in a three-dimensional version of the game a high powered angel has a winning strategy, makes use of &quot;guardians&quot;. For each cube of any size, there is a guardian that watches over that cube. The guardians decide at each move whether the cube they are watching over is unsafe, safe, or almost safe. The definitions of &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;almost safe&quot; need to be chosen to ensure this works. This decision is based purely on the density of blocked points in that cube and the size of that cube.

If the angel is given no orders, then it just moves up. If some cubes that the angel is occupying cease to be safe, then the guardian of the biggest of these cubes is instructed to arrange for the angel to leave through one of the borders of that cube. If a guardian is instructed to escort the angel out of its cube to a particular face, the guardian does so by plotting a path of subcubes that are all safe. The guardians in these cubes are then instructed to escort the angel through their respective subcubes. The angel&#x27;s path in a given subcube is not determined until the angel arrives at that cube. Even then, the path is only determined roughly. This ensures the devil cannot just choose a place on the path sufficiently far along it and block it.

The strategy can be proven to work because the time it takes the devil to convert a safe cube in the angel&#x27;s path to an unsafe cube is longer than the time it takes the angel to get to that cube.

This proof was published by Imre Leader and Béla Bollobás in 2006. A substantially similar proof was published by Martin Kutz in 2005.

<text>Juan Manuel Garcia Passalacqua (February 22, 1937 – July 2, 2010) was a lawyer, writer and political analyst from Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Garcia Passalacqua, who was born in the Hato Rey district of San Juan, Puerto Rico, showed interest in studying from a very young age, and he held degrees from Tufts, Tulane and Harvard Law School universities. His father was a professor of literature at the University of Puerto Rico and his uncle was a candidate for governor for the Puerto Rican Independence Party. After obtaining his law degree, he went on to work as aide to governors Luis Muñoz Marín and Roberto Sanchez Vilella, both of the PPD. He was a member of a reformist group, known in Puerto Rico as &quot;The 22&quot;.

==Writer and political analyst==
Garcia Passalacqua later showed discontent with the PPD, eventually leaving the party. He became a television producer in Puerto Rico; one of his most important shows was &quot;Cara a Cara Ante el País&quot; (Face to Face). During the 1980s, Garcia-Passalacqua became one of the most sought after political analysts by other television producers. He became a common figure on Puerto Rican television during election years.

He wrote more than 20 books, in both Spanish and English, mostly on Caribbean affairs and politics. In 1982, he was invited to become a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He was also a member of the Ambassadors Circle of the Carter Center in Atlanta. As part of his duties with the Carter Center, he served as an impartial election observer in more than a dozen countries around the world.

He taught classes as a visiting professor at colleges ranging from Yale University to the Center for Advanced Studies in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean in San Juan. For many years he served as legal counsel for the Ana G. Mendez Foundation. In his role as a political analyst in Puerto Rico, Garcia-Passalacqua was known to give his opinion or criticism of Puerto Rican parties without particularly lining up with or against any of the three major parties there. Over the years, he consistently proposed an associated republic political relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States since he wrote his masters thesis on the topic in 1957 for Professor Carl Friedrich at Harvard University. He wrote columns for such newspapers as &quot;El Nuevo Dia&quot; (The New Day), &quot;El Vocero&quot; (The Spokesperson) and &quot;The San Juan Star&quot;. In 2006, he returned to Puerto Rico&#x27;s most respected news radio station, WKAQ, as an on-air political commentator.

&quot;Juan Ma&quot;, as he was referred by some, participated in a televised program called &quot;Medio Día Puerto Rico&quot; (Midday Puerto Rico), during the lunchtime hours on Televicentro Puerto Rico in a segment called &quot;La Escuelita&quot; (The Small Schoolhouse). After an incident in which he apparently made mention of the daughter of Aníbal Acevedo Vilá (governor of Puerto Rico at the time), he was fired from the show and did not visit the TV station again, only talking via phone from outside when several people, such as La Comay or news reporters, called him for political analysis.

==Later years==
In early 2009, García Passalacqua reduced his level of activities for health reasons and began to be the object of published testimonials. In particular, Governor Luis Fortuño issued a proclamation declaring February 22, 2009 &quot;Juan Manuel García Passalacqua Day&quot; in recognition of his accomplishments in public service, academia, journalism and political analysis. Fortuño, a former neighbor of García Passalacqua, considered the political analyst one of his mentors in his formative years. He later re-joined WKAQ-AM as a political analyst, suggesting that his health had improved. However, on Friday, May 7, 2010 a letter from him was read on WKAQ-AM noon program directed to news director Javier Cosme and the program&#x27;s audience stating that he was leaving the program and the islands of Puerto Rico to be at peace in his remaining time, since he had been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. He resided at the Ohio home of his daughter Ivonne Marie García Acosta, a college professor, during the last months of his life, where he died surrounded by his family, according to his widow, professor and author Ivonne Acosta. On July 2, 2010, García Passalacqua died in Mount Vernon, Ohio

Governor Fortuño declared three days of mourning, July 3, 5 and 6, during which the flags of Puerto Rico and United States will be flown at half-staff. Flags are never flown at half-staff on Independence Day, even though Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory.
