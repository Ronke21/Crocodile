<text>Turnworth is a small village and civil parish in north Dorset, England, situated on the Dorset Downs west of Blandford Forum. It consists of a few cottages and farmhouses scattered around a church and manor house. In 2013 the civil parish had an estimated population of 30.

In 1086 in the Domesday Book Turnworth was recorded as &quot;Torneworde&quot;; it had 19 households, was in Pimperne Hundred and the lord and tenant-in-chief was Alfred of &#x27;Spain&#x27;.

The church, with the exception of the tower, was rebuilt in the 19th century with assistance from Thomas Hardy, who designed the capitals and possibly also the corbels. Hardy described Turnworth&#x27;s position as being &quot;stood in a hole, but the hole is full of beauty&quot;, and he used Turnworth House as the inspiration for Hintock House in his novel &quot;The Woodlanders&quot;.

Nearby is Ringmoor, an ancient settlement on the top of the scarp face of the downs.

The manor house in the area is Turnworth House, which was demolished in 1947.

== Politics ==
For UK general elections, Turnworth is part of the North Dorset constituency.

Locally, Turnworth is part of the Stour and Allen Vale ward for elections to Dorset Council.

<text>Warmwell is a small village and civil parish in south west Dorset, England, situated on the B3390 road about southeast of Dorchester. In 2013 the estimated population of the parish was 80.

Warmwell contains several historic buildings, including a Jacobean manor house, and from May 1937 was the home of RAF Station Woodsford airfield (later renamed RAF Warmwell), which is now a popular holiday site and contains a caravan park and several other small businesses.

On the outskirts of the village is Warmwell Holiday Park, operated by Parkdean Resorts. It was established in its current form in 1987, when the owners of the Warmwell Holiday Village Touring and Camping Park erected 177 timber lodges and guest facilities. It opened under the name Warmwell Leisure Resort in 1988, with facilities including an indoor swimming pool (with wave machine and flume), all-weather ski slope, fishing lake, licensed family club house and sports hall.

<text>Gatecrasher is an international clubbing brand made famous by the &quot;Gatecrasher&quot; (later &quot;Crasher&quot;) dance music events, which were held at the Republic nightclub in Sheffield, UK during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The promoters of the brand were Simon Raine and Simon Oates and, until 2004, Scott Bond. By August 2014, the only Gatecrasher venue remaining was located in the United Kingdom city of Birmingham. This venue was closed down permanently by the authorities on 25 November 2015.

==History==
===Conception===
During the early 1990s, Scott Bond was a DJ for nightclubs in Birmingham. In approximately 1992, Bond met Simon Raine who was the manager of a club called Bakers at the time. Bond subsequently agreed to become the new resident DJ at Bakers, while Raine focused on the promotion of a new club night called Absolutely Ridiculous. In 1993, Bond started his own night at Bakers called Republica and later that year, the pair decided to collaborate on a new one-off event named Gatecrasher.

===Early years===
Gatecrasher was first held as a one-off event in 1993 in the West Midlands at the Tardebigge Engine House. The night originally took its form from similar local clubs such as Fun, Wobble, Miss Moneypenny&#x27;s and C.R.E.A.M. The club later moved to Bakers nightclub on Broad Street, Birmingham but became so popular that larger events were organised in other locations in and around the West Midlands.

Due to a large number of similar nights in the Birmingham area, the event was relocated to the northern city of Sheffield. The event was initially held in the Leadmill, then at The Arches, before moving to The Adelphi.

==Superclub years==
In 1996 Gatecrasher started to use a nightclub in the city centre called The Republic for one-off events such as New Year&#x27;s Eve; in 1997 the event moved to the venue permanently. Gatecrasher bought the venue in Sheffield later that year.

Gatecrasher offered an all-night event, with big-name DJs throughout the night, with Judge Jules as resident DJ. This attracted people from all over the country who liked a style of music that was originally Techno and House oriented. The door admittance policy was notoriously strict, seemingly turning people away for no apparent reason. Instead of discouraging people to attend, this policy only made the event more popular as gaining admittance to the club only added to the sense of excitement. The door policy also ensured that only dedicated and enthusiastic clubbers gained access. This resulted in a clientele and atmosphere that was rare at that time in any club in the UK. The door policy, and fashion at the end of the 1990s, encouraged people to dress in a flamboyant style to ensure entry to the night. The club developed a cult following (Crasher Kids) who in turn developed their own style of fashion, identifiable by fluorescent clothes, dummies, and spiky hair. Scott Bond&#x27;s style of dance music was reflected in the DJs booked for the nights and at the end of the 1990s, Gatecrasher was instrumental in the rise of trance music with the use of DJs like Ferry Corsten.

In 1998, Gatecrasher joined forces with the London nightclub Ministry of Sound and held its first outdoor festival at Lotherton Hall in Leeds, which was also broadcast on BBC Radio 1. In the same year, the event received the Club of the Year award at the Ericsson &quot;Muzik Magazine&quot; Dance Awards, winning it again in 1999, and Gatecrasher CD &quot;Black&quot; was released. Gatecrasher has won other awards, including, &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; Club of the Year award in 1999, BEDA Awards Event of the Year category in 1999, &quot;Mixmag&quot;″s Crowd of the Year award in 1998 and &quot;Ministry Magazine&quot; Club of the Year award in 1999.

The Lotherton Hall event was repeated in 1999, but Gatecrasher organised it alone; the event was again broadcast on BBC Radio 1. During the same year, Gatecrasher began a nine-year relationship with Sheffield&#x27;s Designers Republic studio for the production of the nightclub brand&#x27;s artwork. Gatecrasher also bought the Music Factory nightclub in Sheffield in 1999 and renamed it Bed. The music at Bed was mainly house music, with the club&#x27;s promotion aimed at consumers who were older and more sophisticated than the typical Gatecrasher attendee. American house music DJ Roger Sanchez celebrated his birthday with a seven-hour DJ set at Bed in May 2004.

During a visit to South Africa, Gatecrasher performed to sold-out venues at Wembley Stadium in Johannesburg and The Dockside in Cape Town. Gatecrasher has toured around the world to: Europe, Australia, Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.

Gatecrasher&#x27;s 2000GC Millennium Eve event was held at the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield and attracted 25,000 people. The event was held in a portable structure called Tensile 1, designed by Rudi Enos (given a Guinness World Record for Largest Portable Event Venue) and had ten operational bars, several spanning over 25 metres. According to Gatecrasher promoter Simon Raine, 2000GC was: &quot;ten years of promoting parties, ten years of production knowledge, and ten years of contacts all put into one very special night.&quot;

Gatecrasher relocated its summer festival to Turweston Airfield near Brackley, Northamptonshire. The renamed Summer Sound System event was held in June 2000. Gatecrasher then launched its own record label in 2001, followed by the release of the first album &quot;Digital&quot;.

On 19 May 2001, South Yorkshire Police made a drugs raid on the Republic nightclub, making 13 arrests and seizing &quot;a substantial amount&quot; of drugs. Around 800 clubbers were ejected from the premises after 160 officers entered it.
==Reinventing the brand==
By late 2003, reflecting a widespread decline in UK super club attendance, the Gatecrasher event changed from a monthly event to one held only on special occasions, such as Bank Holidays. In order for Gatecrasher to continue, the company began to focus on the nightclub market and not just single events. In 2003, the company re-branded The Republic, completely refitted the club, and renamed it &quot;Gatecrasher One&quot;, in preparation for another ten new Gatecrasher venues around the UK. At the same time, the actual club night was renamed Crasher and the Bed nightclub was closed.

In September 2005 the company opened a new club in Leeds under the name Discothèque. In 2007, Gatecrasher bought Media nightclub in Nottingham, and after a million pound refurbishment, relaunched the venue as Gatecrasher Nottingham.

On the evening of 18 June 2007, Gatecrasher One caught fire and partially collapsed. Only a small number of staff were in the building at the time and the building was evacuated safely. No official cause or explanation for the fire was released. Further inspections by structural engineers revealed that the building was beyond repair and that any attempt to restore the building would be unsafe, so the buildings were demolished.

Gatecrasher in Leeds was rebranded as Gatecrasher7 in 2007. The downstairs room was fully overhauled and branded as BED. In September 2008, Gatecrasher opened a 5 million pound superclub in Birmingham, UK that was designed by Callin Fortis of Big Time Design Studios. Also in 2009, Gatecrasher Loves Nottingham was re-branded as &quot;Gatecrasher Ultra&quot; and their Watford venue, &quot;Area&quot;, was re-designed.

Since the fire at Gatecrasher One, Gatecrasher have held one-off events at the Magna Centre near Rotherham and Carling Academy in Sheffield.

In 2010, the company announced a new £5 million reopening of Gatecrasher One, subject to planning approval. However, this was later refused by Sheffield City Council. The decision is now being appealed by Gatecrasher.

===Controversy and administration===
Gatecrasher7 in Leeds was shut down on 29 March 2011, after its licence was revoked earlier in the year due to a spate of violence and a stabbing. Gatecrasher successfully appealed its licence revocation and the Leeds club re-opened at the end of 2011. Re-branded as Bed Nightclub, the re-opening was based on the condition that metal detectors were installed, and only plastic glasses were used.

Based in Birmingham, the Gatecrasher company entered administration in August 2013 after amassing debts of more than £3.5 million. Administrators Duff and Phelps published a report in which they explained that under the names &quot;Tiptoptap Ltd&quot; and &quot;Late Night Watford Ltd&quot;, the Gatecrasher owners incurred operating losses of £1.1 million from June 2012, to 31 March 2013. Furthermore, the report stated that in excess of £500,000 was owed to HM Revenue and Customs, while the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; news publication also published another debt of £3 million that was owed to the Barclays banking and financial services company (an August 2014 company statement denied the Barclays debt). Raine explained to the media that over 300 jobs would be retained during the transition to a newly formed limited company called &quot;Gatecrasher (Birmingham) Ltd&quot;, stating:
The transfer of the business to the new company, along with extensive corporate restructuring and refunding of the business, has enabled Gatecrasher to progress on a secure financial footing. The restructuring was the only option available to ensure the continued viability and growth of the business and also preserve jobs.

In September 2013, the Leeds Magistrates Court found Gatecrasher guilty of selling counterfeit alcohol after the West Yorkshire Trading Standards visited the Bed venue on 11 September 2012 in response to complaints. The officers confiscated 656 litres from the premises, the largest seizure of fake alcohol by the Standards Office at the time, and subsequent tests revealed that the alcohol contained isopropanol, tertiary butanol and chloroform. The Court fined Gatecrasher £5000, with costs of £2095.67.

&quot;Redbrick&quot;, the student publication of the University of Birmingham, published an article in October 2013 that provided further information about the University&#x27;s Guild of Students&#x27; boycott of Gatecrasher due to a significant debt that was outstanding at the time. In an official statement, The Birmingham University&#x27;s Guild claimed that the company owed both the Guild and student groups a total amount of around £28,000. the statement concluded: &quot;student groups are no longer able to work with the venue so that we take a collective approach. This decision has been made in the best interests of both students and student groups.&quot; In an August 2014 official statement, Gatecrasher claimed that the Guild declined the &quot;full payment&quot; offered by the company.

Following a reported €3 million refurbishment, the Gatecrasher Ibiza venue was opened in 2014 on Ibiza in the space that was previously the venue for the Eden club. The opening night was held on 29 May 2014 and featured artists such as Aly &amp; Fila and Mistajam.

Gatecrasher Ibiza failed to open on 29 August for what was its flagship night, this following a gradual reduction in opening over the previous weeks.

At the beginning of August 2014, the Beatsmedia music company published an article on its website titled &quot;GATECRASHER: THE GATE THAT FINALLY CRASHED!!!&quot; after it received complaints from anonymous members of the music industry who claimed that they have been mistreated by the company. On its website, Beatsmedia explained that it was borne of &quot;a desire to help link musicians who work hard&quot;, while its article aims to give &quot;a voice to the people affected&quot; by Gatecrashers alleged conduct—Beatsmedia also claim that Gatecrasher ignored the &quot;public&#x27;s outrage&quot;. Complaints against Gatecrasher were also made on social media platforms including comments made by artists; for example, the Super8 &amp; Tab group claimed on Facebook, in response to the cancellation of their Ibiza performance that &quot;they [Gatecrasher] have simply failed to stick to contractual agreements and book travel for the artists&quot;.

Gatecrasher responded with an official statement on its own website, stating that &quot;sensationalist online portals and blogs&quot; had been furthering &quot;their own selfish pursuits&quot;. The statement explains that the Beatsmedia article is &quot;being dealt with&quot;, as it contains &quot;false facts&quot; that are &quot;libelous&quot;. The company responded to the key allegations in the Beatsmedia article and invited anyone who was still owed money from the 2013 administration process to contact Duff and Phelps directly or email Gatecrasher&#x27;s Accounts Department. In terms of Ibiza, the statement explains that the company was forced to make programmatic changes in accordance with what &quot;the market dictates&quot; and claims that all consumers who were entitled to a refund have been paid. Writing for the &quot;TranceFixxed&quot; website, Tim Turner concludes:
For the sake of all parties, I hope that Gatecrasher not only survives this but thrives. But for this to happen, it cannot be at the expense of other people. The music community needs to give Gatecrasher time and encouragement how to turn itself around. Gatecrasher in turn needs to listen to the public dissatisfaction, take on board the constructive criticism, learn from its own past mistakes and work with (and not against) the music community. The public claims and counterclaims and general &#x27;chucking of toys from the pram&#x27; is great entertainment for social media, but a company at war with its customers does not remain a company in business for very long...

Gatecrasher&#x27;s Broad Street Club was shut down on 31 October 2015 the result of a stabbing and alleged brawl involving security staff. This was the second closing in three months. The victim was stabbed in the leg and security staff were accused of using makeshift weapons in a brawl with a group of customers. Superintendent Andrew Beard, of West Midlands Police, said the force would be asking for the full revocation of the licence at a full hearing on 25 November 2015. On 25 November, Birmingham City Council revoked Gatecrasher&#x27;s licence to operate. The Deltic Group is in discussions with Gatecrasher about taking over operations of the venue.

=== Return to Sheffield ===
Gatecrasher has penciled a return to the old site of Kingdom nightclubs on Burgess Street in Q3/4 of 2016. This however is only a temporary lease until the site is fully demolished to make way for redevelopment in line with the council plans for the town centre. This is expected to help Gatecrasher secure a better, more permanent home in Sheffield following the loss of the original venue, Gatecrasher One (formally The Republic) when planning permission is sought.

<doc id="1077688" wikidata="Q415007" url="?curid=1077688" title="Catechin">
<text>Catechin is a flavan-3-ol, a type of secondary metabolite providing antioxidant roles in plants. It belongs to the subgroup of polyphenols called flavonoids.

The name of the catechin chemical family derives from &quot;catechu&quot;, which is the tannic juice or boiled extract of &quot;Mimosa catechu&quot; (&quot;Acacia catechu&quot; L.f).

== Chemistry ==

Catechin possesses two benzene rings (called the A and B rings) and a dihydropyran heterocycle (the C ring) with a hydroxyl group on carbon 3. The A ring is similar to a resorcinol moiety while the B ring is similar to a catechol moiety. There are two chiral centers on the molecule on carbons 2 and 3. Therefore, it has four diastereoisomers. Two of the isomers are in &quot;trans&quot; configuration and are called &quot;catechin&quot; and the other two are in &quot;cis&quot; configuration and are called &quot;epicatechin&quot;.

The most common catechin isomer is (+)-catechin. The other stereoisomer is (−)-catechin or &quot;ent&quot;-catechin. The most common epicatechin isomer is (−)-epicatechin (also known under the names -epicatechin, epicatechol, (−)-epicatechol, -acacatechin, -epicatechol, epicatechin, 2,3-&quot;cis&quot;-epicatechin or (2&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;)-(−)-epicatechin).

The different epimers can be separated using chiral column chromatography.

Making reference to no particular isomer, the molecule can just be called catechin. Mixtures of the different enantiomers can be called (±)-catechin or -catechin and (±)-epicatechin or -epicatechin.

Catechin and epicatechin are the building blocks of the proanthocyanidins, a type of condensed tannin.


Moreover, the flexibility of the C-ring allows for two conformation isomers, putting the B-ring either in a pseudoequatorial position (E conformer) or in a pseudoaxial position (A conformer). Studies confirmed that (+)-catechin adopts a mixture of A- and E-conformers in aqueous solution and their conformational equilibrium has been evaluated to be 33:67.

As flavonoids, catechins can act as antioxidants when in high concentration &quot;in vitro&quot;, but compared with other flavonoids, their antioxidant potential is low. The ability to quench singlet oxygen seems to be in relation with the chemical structure of catechin, with the presence of the catechol moiety on ring B and the presence of a hydroxyl group activating the double bond on ring C.

===Oxidation===
Electrochemical experiments show that (+)-catechin oxidation mechanism proceeds in sequential steps, related with the catechol and resorcinol groups and the oxidation is pH-dependent. The oxidation of the catechol 3′,4′-dihydroxyl electron-donating groups occurs first, at very low positive potentials, and is a reversible reaction. The hydroxyl groups of the resorcinol moiety oxidised afterwards were shown to undergo an irreversible oxidation reaction.

The laccase/ABTS system oxidizes (+)-catechin to oligomeric products of which proanthocyanidin A2 is a dimer.

=== Spectral data ===

== Natural occurrences ==
(+)-Catechin and (−)-epicatechin as well as their gallic acid conjugates are ubiquitous constituents of vascular plants, and frequent components of traditional herbal remedies, such as &quot;Uncaria rhynchophylla&quot;. The two isomers are mostly found as cacao and tea constituents, as well as in &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; grapes.

=== In food ===
The main dietary sources of catechins in Europe and the United States are tea and pome fruits.

Catechins and epicatechins are found in cocoa, which, according to one database, has the highest content (108 mg/100 g) of catechins among foods analyzed, followed by prune juice (25 mg/100 ml) and broad bean pod (16 mg/100 g). Açaí oil, obtained from the fruit of the açaí palm (&quot;Euterpe oleracea&quot;), contains (+)-catechins (67 mg/kg).

Catechins are diverse among foods, from peaches to green tea and vinegar. Catechins are found in barley grain, where they are the main phenolic compound responsible for dough discoloration. The taste associated with monomeric (+)-catechin or (−)-epicatechin is described as slightly astringent, but not bitter.

== Metabolism ==

=== Biosynthesis ===
The biosynthesis of catechin begins with ma 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA starter unit which undergoes chain extension by the addition of three malonyl-CoAs through a PKSIII pathway. 4-Hydroxycinnamoyl CoA is biosynthesized from -phenylalanine through the Shikimate pathway. -Phenylalanine is first deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) forming cinnamic acid which is then oxidized to 4-hydroxycinnamic acid by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase. Chalcone synthase then catalyzes the condensation of 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA to form chalcone. Chalcone is then isomerized to naringenin by chalcone isomerase which is oxidized to eriodictyol by flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase and further oxidized to taxifolin by flavanone 3-hydroxylase. Taxifolin is then reduced by dihydroflavanol 4-reductase and leucoanthocyanidin reductase to yield catechin. The biosynthesis of catechin is shown below

Leucocyanidin reductase (LCR) uses 2,3-&quot;trans&quot;-3,4-&quot;cis&quot;-leucocyanidin to produce (+)-catechin and is the first enzyme in the proanthocyanidin (PA) specific pathway. Its activity has been measured in leaves, flowers, and seeds of the legumes &quot;Medicago sativa&quot;, &quot;Lotus japonicus&quot;, &quot;Lotus uliginosus&quot;, &quot;Hedysarum sulfurescens&quot;, and &quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;. The enzyme is also present in &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; (grape).

===Biodegradation===
Catechin oxygenase, a key enzyme in the degradation of catechin, is present in fungi and bacteria.

Among bacteria, degradation of (+)-catechin can be achieved by &quot;Acinetobacter calcoaceticus&quot;. Catechin is metabolized to protocatechuic acid (PCA) and phloroglucinol carboxylic acid (PGCA). It is also degraded by &quot;Bradyrhizobium japonicum&quot;. Phloroglucinol carboxylic acid is further decarboxylated to phloroglucinol, which is dehydroxylated to resorcinol. Resorcinol is hydroxylated to hydroxyquinol. Protocatechuic acid and hydroxyquinol undergo intradiol cleavage through protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase and hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase to form β-carboxy-&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;-muconic acid and maleyl acetate.

Among fungi, degradation of catechin can be achieved by &quot;Chaetomium cupreum&quot;.

===Metabolism in humans ===

Catechins are metabolised upon uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, in particular the jejunum, and in the liver, resulting in so-called structurally related epicatechin metabolites (SREM). The main metabolic pathways for SREMs are glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation of the catechol group by catechol-O-methyl transferase, with only small amounts detected in plasma. The majority of dietary catechins are however metabolised by the colonic microbiome to gamma-valerolactones and hippuric acids which undergo further biotransformation, glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation in the liver.

The stereochemical configuration of catechins has a strong impact on their uptake and metabolism as uptake is highest for (−)-epicatechin and lowest for (−)-catechin.

=== Biotransformation ===
Biotransformation of (+)-catechin into taxifolin by a two-step oxidation can be achieved by &quot;Burkholderia&quot; sp.

(+)-Catechin and (−)-epicatechin are transformed by the endophytic filamentous fungus &quot;Diaporthe&quot; sp. into the 3,4-cis-dihydroxyflavan derivatives, (+)-(2&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;S&quot;,4&quot;S&quot;)-3,4,5,7,3′,4′-hexahydroxyflavan (leucocyanidin) and (−)-(2&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;,4&quot;R&quot;)-3,4,5,7,3′,4′-hexahydroxyflavan, respectively, whereas (−)-catechin and (+)-epicatechin with a (2&quot;S&quot;)-phenyl group resisted the biooxidation.

Leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) uses (2&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;S&quot;)-catechin, NADP+ and H2O to produce 2,3-&quot;trans&quot;-3,4-&quot;cis&quot;-leucocyanidin, NADPH, and H+. Its gene expression has been studied in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves.

=== Glycosides ===
* (2&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;S&quot;)-Catechin-7-&quot;O&quot;-β--glucopyranoside can be isolated from barley (&quot;Hordeum vulgare&quot; L.) and malt.
* Epigeoside (catechin-3-&quot;O&quot;-α--rhamnopyranosyl-(1–4)-β--glucopyranosyl-(1–6)-β--glucopyranoside) can be isolated from the rhizomes of &quot;Epigynum auritum&quot;.

==Research==
===Vascular function===
Only limited evidence from dietary studies indicates that catechins may affect endothelium-dependent vasodilation which could contribute to normal blood flow regulation in humans. Green tea catechins may improve blood pressure, especially when systolic blood pressure is above 130 mmHg.

Due to extensive metabolism during digestion, the fate and activity of catechin metabolites responsible for this effect on blood vessels, as well as the actual mode of action, are unknown.

===Adverse events===
Catechin and its metabolites can bind tightly to red blood cells and thereby induce the development of autoantibodies, resulting in haemolytic anaemia and renal failure. This resulted in the withdrawal of the catechin-containing drug Catergen, used to treat viral hepatitis, from market in 1985.

Catechins from green tea can be hepatotoxic and the European Food Safety Authority has recommended not to exceed 800 mg per day.

===Other===
One limited meta-analysis showed that increasing consumption of green tea and its catechins to seven cups per day provided a small reduction in prostate cancer. 
Nanoparticle methods are under preliminary research as potential delivery systems of catechins.

== Botanical effects ==

Catechins released into the ground by some plants may hinder the growth of their neighbors, a form of allelopathy. &quot;Centaurea maculosa&quot;, the spotted knapweed often studied for this behavior, releases catechin isomers into the ground through its roots, potentially having effects as an antibiotic or herbicide. One hypothesis is that it causes a reactive oxygen species wave through the target plant&#x27;s root to kill root cells by apoptosis. Most plants in the European ecosystem have defenses against catechin, but few plants are protected against it in the North American ecosystem where &quot;Centaurea maculosa&quot; is an invasive, uncontrolled weed.

Catechin acts as an infection-inhibiting factor in strawberry leaves. Epicatechin and catechin may prevent coffee berry disease by inhibiting appressorial melanization of &quot;Colletotrichum kahawae&quot;.

<text>Sir David Brand KCMG (1 August 1912 – 15 April 1979) was an Australian politician. He was the longest-serving premier of Western Australia, in office from 1959 to 1971, and was state leader of the Liberal Party from 1957 to 1972.

Brand was born in Dongara, Western Australia. He was raised on farms in the Mid West and left school at the age of 14. He moved to the Eastern Goldfields in 1935 and worked as a miner for several years, later serving in the Australian Army during World War II where he was wounded on the Greek campaign. Brand was elected to the Parliament of Western Australia at a 1945 by-election for the seat of Greenough. He served as a cabinet minister under Ross McLarty from 1949 to 1953 and replaced McLarty as leader of the Liberal Party in 1957.

Brand led the Liberal Party to victory at the 1959 state election and won three subsequent terms governing in coalition with the Country Party. His term as premier saw significant population growth and economic development, including the expansion of the Ord River Scheme and the development of the iron ore mining industry in the Pilbara and the bauxite mining industry in the south-west. Brand&#x27;s government was defeated at the 1971 state election and he resigned as Liberal leader in 1972 and from parliament in 1975. The federal Division of Brand and Brand Highway are named in his honour.

==Early life==
Brand was born on 1 August 1912 in Dongara, Western Australia. He was the first of four children born to Hilda () and Albert John Brand. His maternal grandfather was Samuel Mitchell, a Cornish immigrant who was a pioneer of the mining industry in Western Australia and served in both houses of state parliament. His father&#x27;s grandfather George Brand was transported to Western Australia on the convict ship &quot;Stag&quot; in 1855, subsequently settling in the Greenough area.

Brand&#x27;s parents acquired a farm at Northampton shortly after his birth. In 1924 they moved to Mullewa, where he attended the local state school. He left school at 14 to work on the farm, and at Mullewa became secretary of the local branch of the Primary Producers&#x27; Association.

In 1935, Brand moved to Kalgoorlie and worked at the Golden Horseshoe Mine, as a truck driver, treatment hand, filter specialist and shift boss. In February 1938 he discovered the body of a co-worker, Walter Veitch, who had been fatally electrocuted while working alone at a pumping station. He subsequently gave evidence at the inquest into Veitch&#x27;s death.

==Military service==

Following the outbreak of World War II, Brand enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 23 November 1939. As a private, he was assigned to the 2/11th Battalion, part of the 6th Division, which embarked for the Middle East on 20 April 1940. Brand fought in the North African campaign, including the advance on Benghazi, and was promoted to corporal before the 2/11th was sent to the Greek campaign, in which he was seriously wounded on 24 April 1941.

Brand was eventually sent back to Australia for further treatment, arriving in August, and was discharged as medically unfit in April 1942. He was re-mobilised in September, as an instructor with the 7th Battalion, Volunteer Defence Corps, in Geraldton and was promoted to Warrant Officer in January 1943. With the war effort beginning to wind down, Brand was discharged from the army in January 1945.

==Early political career==

After his army discharge, Brand took over the general store at Dongara.

The incumbent Labor member for the State seat of Greenough, John Newton, was killed in action with the RAAF in 1945. Brand won the seat for the Liberal Party in a by-election that year, defeating Newton&#x27;s brother by a narrow margin.

In October 1949, Ross McLarty became Premier and Brand entered the Ministry as Minister for Housing, Forests and Local Government. From April 1950 he was Minister for Works, Water Supply and Housing, working to establish the Kwinana Oil Refinery. Brand would later describe this as one of his greatest achievements. He was also involved in the creation of other major industrial projects.

==Premier of Western Australia (1959–1971)==
===Electoral record===
After the Coalition&#x27;s defeat in 1953, Brand became deputy leader of the Opposition. After McLarty&#x27;s retirement, Brand was elected party leader on 1 March 1957. The Coalition was returned to power in 1959, and Brand was sworn in as Premier on 2 April. His administration retained office at the elections of 1962, 1965, and 1968. This was achieved with the assistance of the West Australian branch of the Democratic Labor Party (DLP) which split the Labor vote in some metropolitan electorates. The DLP was active in Western Australia between 1959 and 1974.

===Economic development===
In 1960, the Federal government lifted its embargo on iron exports, which had been in place since 1938, enabling exploitation of large iron deposits in the Pilbara. The mining of large bauxite deposits in the Darling Scarp also commenced, along with expansion of mineral processing at Kwinana and the South West. Federal finance for the Ord River Scheme was also secured by Brand&#x27;s government. Substantial oil and gas deposits were discovered in the Pilbara. In 1968, Western Australia ceased to be a net recipient of federal financial assistance. Brand was knighted in June of the following year. The mining-pastoral boom of the 1960s played a big part in ensuring for Brand&#x27;s government four successive electoral victories over the ALP opposition (led by Hawke until 1967, and by Tonkin from 1967 to 1971).

===Voting reform===
In 1962, Brand&#x27;s government granted voting rights to Indigenous Australians for state elections, making Queensland the last state to deny Indigenous people the right to vote. His government also significantly liberalised the franchise for the Western Australian Legislative Council, removing the property qualification, reducing the voting age from 30 to 21, and reducing the residency qualification from two years to one. Enrolment and voting for the Legislative Council was also made compulsory. In 1970, the government also legislated to lower the voting age from 21 to 18, the first Australian jurisdiction to do so. The measure enjoyed bipartisan support and Brand stated that &quot;by and large the percentage of responsible youth is much the same as it was in our day or anyone&#x27;s day&quot;.

===Defeat===
The rapid growth of the Perth metropolitan area, and the strain this put on essential services, eroded the government&#x27;s popularity, especially after 1969. In addition, Brand&#x27;s relations with the federal Liberal Party worsened after the retirement of Sir Robert Menzies in 1966. While Brand&#x27;s administration suffered from a series of controversies relating to environmental, heritage, Aboriginal and housing issues, the impact of production quotas for wheat, imposed by Prime Minister Sir John Gorton led to open conflict with the federal Liberal Party.

In the midst of this conflict the Brand government&#x27;s attempt to demolish the remains of the Colonial Barracks (&quot;the Barracks Arch&quot;) immediately opposite the parliament building led to a parliamentary revolt within the Liberal Party. Brand prevented this by dropping the proposal, and agreeing to allow the National Trust to restore the Arch. However, the strains this had caused within the government became evident when Brand collapsed while speaking publicly in 1971. He recovered, but the Coalition lost the election to Labor by one seat, and Tonkin became Premier.

Brand led the Liberals in opposition until his resignation in 1973; Sir Charles Court succeeded him as the party&#x27;s leader. He resigned from parliament in 1975.

==Legacy==
The federal electoral Division of Brand in Western Australia, created in 1984, is named after him, as is the Brand Highway and the Sir David Brand School in Coolbinia. The Sir David Brand Award is the highest award of the West Australian Tourism Awards, in recognition of his work to advance the tourism industry.

==Personal life==

In 1944, Brand married Doris Elspeth McNeill, with whom he had three children. After leaving parliament he retired to his property at Carnamah. Outside of politics he was active in the Methodist Church and was a scoutmaster, later becoming state president of the Boy Scouts&#x27; Association. He was also a long-serving patron of the Spastic Welfare Association.

Brand suffered several strokes in his final years, attributed to hypertensive heart disease. He died in his sleep at his home in Carnamah on 15 April 1979, aged 66.

==In popular culture==
Brand made a guest appearance in the film &quot;Nickel Queen&quot; while Premier of Western Australia.

<doc id="1077699" wikidata="Q7751525" url="?curid=1077699" title="The Mind of God">
<text>The Mind of God is a 1992 non-fiction book by Paul Davies. Subtitled &quot;The Scientific Basis for a Rational World&quot;, it is a whirlwind tour and explanation of theories, both physical and metaphysical, regarding ultimate causes. Its title comes from a quotation from Stephen Hawking: &quot;If we do discover a theory of everything...it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we would truly know the mind of God.&quot;

In the preface, Davies explains that he has been interested in ultimate causes since childhood, having annoyed his parents with unending &quot;why&#x27;s&quot; about everything, with each answer demanding another &quot;why,&quot; and usually ending with the reply, &quot;Because God made it that way, and &quot;that&#x27;s that!&quot;&quot; In the book proper, Davies briefly explores: the nature of reason, belief, and metaphysics; theories of the origin of the universe; the laws of nature; the relationship of mathematics to physics; a few arguments for the existence of God; the possibility that the universe shows evidence of a deity; and his opinion of the implications of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, that &quot;the search for a closed logical scheme that provides a complete and self-consistent explanation is doomed to failure.&quot;

He concludes with a statement of his belief that, even though we may never attain a theory of everything, &quot;the existence of mind in some organism on some planet in the universe is surely a fact of fundamental significance. Through conscious beings the universe has generated self-awareness. This can be no trivial detail, no minor byproduct of mindless, purposeless forces. We are truly meant to be here.&quot;

== Reception ==
In a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Marcia Bartusiak called the book &quot;both stimulating and enlightening&quot;.

<text>Cape Cornwall (, meaning &quot;goose back&quot;) is a small headland in West Cornwall, England. It is north of Land&#x27;s End near the town of St Just. Until the first Ordnance Survey in the early 19th-century, Cape Cornwall was believed to be the most westerly point in Cornwall.

Most of the headland is owned by the National Trust. National Coastwatch has a look-out on the seaward side. The only tourist infrastructure at present is a car park (owned by the National Trust), public toilets, and a refreshments counter during the summer.

The Brisons, two offshore rocks, are located approximately southwest of Cape Cornwall. They mark the starting line of the annual swimming race ending at Priest Cove.

==Etymology==
The name Cape Cornwall appeared first on a maritime chart around the year 1600. The original Cornish name, &quot;Kilgoodh Ust,&quot; dates back to 1580. In English it translates to &quot;goose-back at St Just&quot;, a reference to the shape of the cape. Later versions of the name dropped the &#x27;Ust&#x27;. An alternative name, &quot;Pen Kernow,&quot; is a recent translation back to Cornish of the English.

A cape is the point of land where two bodies of water meet. Cape Cornwall is one of only two capes in the United Kingdom, the other being Cape Wrath in North West Scotland.

==Early history==
Pottery found in cists on the Cape have been dated to the Late Bronze Age. The presence of another cliff castle nearby (Kenidjack) may indicate that the area was important in the Iron Age. On the landward side of the Cape is the remains of the medieval St Helen&#x27;s Oratory, which replaced a 6th-century church. A font now installed in the porch of St Just church may be from this building.

==19th-century to present==
Cape Cornwall Mine, a tin mine on the cape, was operated intermittently between 1838 and 1883. The mine&#x27;s 1864 chimney near the peak of the cape was retained as an aid to navigation. In the early 20th-century, the former ore dressing floors were for a time converted for use as greenhouses and wineries.

In 1987, the mine site was purchased by the H. J. Heinz Company of the United States (and British plants) and donated to the nation. The remains of Cape Cornwall Mine are designated as part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

<text>Orchid is the debut studio album by Swedish progressive metal band Opeth, released on May 15, 1995, in Europe by Candlelight Records and on June 24, 1997, in the United States by Century Black. It was reissued in 2000 with one bonus track, &quot;Into the Frost of Winter,&quot; an early, unproduced rehearsal recording by the band. The recording sessions took place at the old Unisound studio in Finspång, with production handled by Opeth and Dan Swanö. The band did not record a demo to secure a record label deal. Instead, Lee Barrett, the founder of Candlelight Records, was impressed by an Opeth rehearsal tape and decided to sign the band. The album received critical acclaim.

==Background==
Opeth was formed in 1990 in Stockholm, Sweden, by David Isberg. Isberg invited Mikael Åkerfeldt (formerly of the recently disbanded band Eruption) to join Opeth. The other band members objected to this and quit, leaving only Isberg and Åkerfeldt. Anders Nordin, Nick Döring, and Andreas Dimeo were brought in as replacements. They rehearsed in an elementary school using old &#x27;60s equipment they found there. Opeth performed a show in February 1991 alongside Therion, Excruciate, and Authorise in Stockholm. Their set consisted of only two songs. Åkerfeldt later reflected on the performance: &quot;I reckon it was probably the worst appearance one can have witnessed. We were so fucking nervous that we all wanted to cancel the fucking gig and just go back home.&quot;

The band played a second show in Gothenburg. By that time, Döring and Dimeo had left, prompting Opeth to recruit Kim Pettersson and Johan DeFarfalla from the band Crimson Cat to join them onstage. The event also featured performances by At the Gates, Therion, Desecrator, Megaslaughter, and Sarcazm. Following the show, DeFarfalla left to spend time with his girlfriend. Åkerfeldt then invited his friend Peter Lindgren, who was playing in a joke band called Sylt i krysset, to join Opeth as a bassist. Lindgren agreed, wanting a more serious project. Pettersson also left the band, leading Lindgren to switch to guitar. Isberg departed in 1992 due to creative differences. Åkerfeldt became the new vocalist, and he and Lindgren began writing new material. They rehearsed as a three-piece for over a year. Stefan Guteklint joined as bassist but left shortly after the band signed with Candlelight Records in 1994.

Opeth secured a deal with Candlelight Records without recording a demo. For the band, entering a studio to produce a demo was as significant an undertaking as recording an album. Åkerfeldt explained: &quot;We didn&#x27;t have any money to spend on things like that. That would cost us, at least, a couple of hundred bucks... We didn&#x27;t know where to go to record a demo.&quot; Åkerfeldt had sent rehearsal tapes to several labels but received no replies. However, Lee Barrett from Candlelight offered to produce an album, a proposal Åkerfeldt found &quot;quite weird.&quot; Anders Nyström (of Katatonia) revealed that Candlelight&#x27;s interest was sparked by a rumor from Samoth (of Emperor), who had included a few seconds of &quot;The Apostle in Triumph&quot; on a tape of unsigned bands sent to Barrett. Barrett was so impressed that he decided to sign Opeth. Åkerfeldt later received a call from Barrett, who expressed his interest in releasing a full-length Opeth album.

==Recording and production==
&quot;Orchid&quot; was recorded in March 1994 in Finspång, where the old Unisound Studio was located. Opeth relocated from Stockholm to Finspång, where Dan Swanö had arranged an apartment for them. The studio was situated in the cellar of a small house in the middle of a field. The album was produced and mixed by Swanö and the band, with Swanö also serving as engineer. For the recording, the band asked Johan De Farfalla to play session bass guitar. He ultimately joined as a full-time member.

Despite initial nervousness, the recording sessions proceeded smoothly. &quot;We were so ready before we went into the studio, we&#x27;d been rehearsing six or seven times a week, and we&#x27;d even been rehearsing in pitch black darkness in order to play the songs perfectly without even looking,&quot; Åkerfeldt recalled in 2009, speaking to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; However, the band regretted not having enough time to properly record the acoustic piece &quot;Requiem.&quot; Initially recorded at Unisound, the band was dissatisfied with the result. &quot;Requiem&quot; was later recorded in a Stockholm studio with Pontus Norgren as co-producer. 

Due to a mix-up during &quot;Orchid&quot;&#x27;s mastering process, the ending of &quot;Requiem&quot; was mistakenly placed at the beginning of &quot;The Apostle in Triumph.&quot; The band expressed regret over the error, clarifying that it was not their fault. This mistake was later corrected in the 2023 Abbey Road remaster of the album.

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
===Music===
The music on &quot;Orchid&quot; blends elements of progressive rock and acoustic pieces inspired by folk music with black metal screams, death metal growls, and clean vocals. It also features influences from jazz and melodic passages performed on piano and acoustic guitars. Opeth&#x27;s sound stood apart from typical black or death metal bands of the era, and &quot;Orchid&quot; is considered the band&#x27;s closest approach to the black metal genre. Critics described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;unique.&quot; Jim Raggi commented, &quot;If you&#x27;re wanting the more deathy and song-oriented Opeth, skip down to &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; and go from there. If you&#x27;re looking for a unique journey of music built alternately around dual guitar harmonies knocking into sequences when the two guitars and the bass are all playing different parts, stop-start transitions at times and smooth here-to-theres at others, here you go.&quot; Matt Smith observed that &quot;with &quot;Orchid&quot;, the band introduced its blend of intricate, down-tempo acoustic guitar and piano lines and swinging, Celtic-sounding, distorted rhythms.&quot;

Most of the album’s songs exceed nine minutes, though it also features two shorter instrumental tracks: &quot;Silhouette&quot; and &quot;Requiem.&quot; &quot;Silhouette&quot; is a brief piano interlude recorded just hours before the band left the studio. Anders Nordin’s piano skills surprised the production team. Lindgren recalled, &quot;I remember the look on Dan&#x27;s face when we said, &#x27;Our drummer can play the piano.&#x27; He didn&#x27;t believe a word we were saying. Dan can play the piano. Most guys play like shit. When Anders started playing, Dan was actually impressed.&quot; Åkerfeldt later added, &quot;I&#x27;m still quite impressed.&quot; The other instrumental, &quot;Requiem,&quot; is an acoustic composition described by Lindgren as an &quot;epic.&quot; Åkerfeldt borrowed a Spanish acoustic guitar, a Trameleuc, from a local guitar store to record the piece.

The bonus track, &quot;Into the Frost of Winter,&quot; is an early recording from a 1992 rehearsal. This song includes segments that were later reworked into &quot;Advent,&quot; the opening track on Opeth’s second album, &quot;Morningrise&quot;.

===Lyrics===
After the departure of other members, Mikael Åkerfeldt and David Isberg began writing songs for Opeth. Åkerfeldt commented, &quot;As you might understand I was more or less influenced by the occult back then, although in no serious manner. Music-wise I was really into the twisted, dark, and evil-sounding riffs. The lyrics written by both me and David were pure Satanic chantings!&quot; According to Åkerfeldt, &quot;the idea for Opeth was for it to be evil—satanic lyrics and evil riffs. I chose my notes so they sounded evil.&quot; The first two songs they wrote together were &quot;Requiem of Lost Souls&quot; and &quot;Mystique of the Baphomet,&quot; which were later reworked into &quot;Mark of the Damned&quot; and eventually became &quot;Forest of October.&quot; 

When Isberg left the band, Åkerfeldt and Peter Lindgren felt they had discovered a unique approach to playing music. Åkerfeldt remarked, &quot;There were at the time almost no other bands using that many harmonies as we did.&quot; Lindgren called &quot;Forest of October&quot; the best song on the album. Åkerfeldt, however, admitted that he doesn’t remember the song’s meaning, only that he wrote the lyrics to complement the music.

Åkerfeldt noted that &quot;The Twilight Is My Robe,&quot; originally titled &quot;Oath,&quot; was a &quot;satanic song, like an oath to Satan.&quot; He revealed that one section of the song is &quot;a complete rip-off&quot; of Scorpions&#x27; &quot;Fly to the Rainbow.&quot; &quot;Under the Weeping Moon,&quot; described by Lindgren as the album’s most evil track, features lyrics Åkerfeldt called &quot;some kind of satanic worship of the moon,&quot; though he admitted, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t really deal with anything.&quot; Later, on &quot;The Roundhouse Tapes&quot; live album, Åkerfeldt described the song’s lyrics as &quot;absolute black metal nonsense.&quot; He praised the melody of &quot;The Apostle in Triumph&quot; and characterized its lyrics as &quot;a combination of nature and satanic worship.&quot; 

The album’s longest track, &quot;In Mist She Was Standing,&quot; was the last song completed. It was inspired by a nightmare and the film &quot;The Lady in Black&quot;.

==Cover and layout==

===Cover===
When the recordings were completed, the band immediately began working on the cover layout. Åkerfeldt, who had been in contact with photographer Torbjörn Ekebacke for some time, discovered that Ekebacke also worked on graphic layouts. He was asked to create the layout for &quot;Orchid&quot;. The orchid featured on the cover was specially ordered from the Netherlands. 

The first pressing of the album was released without the &quot;Opeth&quot; logo on the front cover. The photographs used on the back of the album were taken in Sörskogen. Åkerfeldt recalled, &quot;We really were lucky as the sunset that evening was probably the most beautiful one I had ever seen. We shot several cool shots that day, but those silhouette ones were the best.&quot;

===Layout===
The band had already encountered one issue with the album regarding the mastering of &quot;Requiem&quot; (see Recording and Production). A second problem arose with the album: the lyric pages were printed in the opposite order from what Opeth had expected. The colors had been reversed, and the CD itself was blue instead of black. The band expressed regret for these mistakes, but fans stated they liked how the colors turned out. After finalizing the layout, the band sent the album to England.

==Reception==
Critical reaction to the album was mostly positive. Critic Matt Smith of &quot;Maelstrom&quot; stated that it was one of the best Opeth albums and &quot;set the tone for the albums to come.&quot; However, before the release of &quot;Orchid,&quot; Åkerfeldt commented:

John Serba of AllMusic said that &quot;Orchid&quot; was &quot;quite an audacious release, a far-beyond-epic prog/death monstrosity exuding equal parts beauty and brutality – an album so brilliant, so navel-gazingly pretentious that, in retrospect, Opeth&#x27;s future greatness was a foregone conclusion.&quot; John Chedsey of &quot;Satan Stole My Teddybear&quot; stated that the album is &quot;one of the more stunning and devastatingly powerful debuts of any metal band in any genre.&quot; Jim Raggi of &quot;Lamentations of the Flame Princess&quot; wrote that &quot;perhaps the most easily recognizable voice in all of extreme metal, Mikael Åkerfeldt really does make some noise in his debut. I can&#x27;t think of very many vocalists in 1994 (when the album was recorded) who used both clean and growled vocals freely. I&#x27;m definitely not going to go so far as to say he was the first (Dan Swanö did beat him on that at least!) but all those years ago, Åkerfeldt did set the standard for what the extreme progressive music vocalist should sound like.&quot; He added, &quot;The fact is this album is a groundbreaking milestone in heavy metal for the progressive elements that are thrown into the more metallic music and the extreme vocals,&quot; and the sound of the album is &quot;completely unique.&quot; Chris Dick of &quot;Decibel&quot; stated in &quot;Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces&quot;:

Not all critics were positive, however. The French magazine &quot;Metallian&quot; called the album &quot;boring and uneventful&quot; and gave it a 1/10. Johan De Farfalla stated, &quot;From the death metal scene, they thought, &#x27;Wow! This is cool!&#x27; From the educated musicians I knew, they said, &#x27;This sucks. The sound is bad. You should re-record this.&#x27; But I think people really liked it, apart from the sound.&quot;

<text>SNCAC (the , sometimes known as ) was a French aircraft manufacturer created by the nationalisation of the Farman Aviation Works and Hanriot firms in 1936.

It was liquidated in 1949, with assets distributed between SNCAN, SNCASO, and SNECMA, all of which were nationalised firms.

<text>The River Bann (from , meaning &quot;the goddess&quot;; Ulster-Scots: &quot;Bann Wattèr&quot;) is the longest river in Northern Ireland, its length, Upper and Lower Bann combined, being 129 km (80 mi). However, the total length of the River Bann, including its path through the 30 km (19 mi) long Lough Neagh is 159 km (99 mi). Another length of the River Bann given is 90 mi. The river winds its way from the southeast corner of Ulster to the northwest coast, pausing in the middle to widen into Lough Neagh. The River Bann catchment has an area of 5,775 km2. The River Bann has a mean discharge rate of 92 m3/s. According to C. Michael Hogan, the Bann River Valley is a settlement area for some of the first human arrivals in Ireland after the most recent glacial retreat.

The river has played an important part in the industrialisation in Northern Ireland, especially in the linen industry. Today salmon and eel fisheries are the most important economic features of the river. The river is often used as a dividing line between the eastern and western areas of Northern Ireland, often labelled the &quot;Bann divide&quot;. Towns, councils and businesses &quot;west of the Bann&quot; are often seen as having less investment and government spending than those to the east. It is also seen as a religious, economic and political divide, with Catholics and Irish nationalists being in the majority to the west, and Ulster Protestants and unionists in the majority to the east; and with the financial and industrial capital of Greater Belfast to the east with the west of the Bann being more agricultural and rural.

The Lough Neagh catchment drains 43% of the landmass of Northern Ireland, as well as some border areas in the Republic of Ireland, all in Ulster. The Rivers Agency manages the water level in the lough using a barrage at Toome. The current drainage scheme was engineered by Major Percy Shepherd and was enabled by the Lough Neagh and Lower Bann Drainage and Navigation Act (Northern Ireland) 1955. The levels are regulated between 12.45 metres and 12.6 metres above Ordnance Datum, as defined in the Lough Neagh (Levels) Scheme 1955 (as amended).

==Upper Bann==

The Upper Bann rises at Slieve Muck in the Mourne Mountains, County Down and flows directly into Spelga Reservoir before continuing through a number of towns until after it joins Lough Neagh at Bannfoot, County Armagh. This stretch is one of the most popular coarse fishing rivers in Europe. At Whitecoat Point near Portadown, it is joined by the Cusher River and connects with the now disused Newry Canal, which once gave access south to the Irish Sea.

Although the Upper Bann was officially abandoned as a navigation in 1954, it is still possible to navigate between Whitecoat Point and Lough Neagh. Entrance to the river from Lough Neagh is not easy, as the river is quite shallow at this point, and there are no navigation markers to assist. Once on the river, the jetties for the Bann Ferry are soon reached. It is possible to moor there, to visit the villages of Columbkille to the west or Bannfoot to the east. Bannfoot was originally called Charlestown after its builder, Charles Brownlow, who built it around 1830. Some from the mouth, the river is crossed by the M1 motorway. The bridge is the lowest on the navigable section, with an air draught of around , although in strong northerly winds, water backs up in the river and the headroom is reduced.

From the bridge it is around to Portadown, and the river passes through pleasant rural scenery. Exploration of the town from the river is difficult, because water levels at Shillington Quay and at the jetty a little further upstream are very shallow. The river is crossed by the railway line from to and then road bridges carrying the A3 road and the A27 road. The junction with the Cusher River and the entrance to the derelict Newry Canal is just over from the final bridge, and navigation of the river is possible for a short distance beyond that point.

==Upper Bann Bridges==
Spelga Bridge, New Bridge, Eight Mile Bridge, Mill Bridge, Cavan Bridge, Mc Combs Bridge, Bannfield Bridge, Tirkelly Bridge, Roughan Bridge, Seafin Bridge, Kates Bridge, Circular Rd Bann Bridge, Mulligans Bridge, Balilievey Bridge, Lisnaree Bridge, Lindsays Bridge, A1 Bypass Bridge, Bannbridge Bridge, Milltown Bridge, Point Bridge, Tullylish Bridge, Gilford Bridge, White Bridge, Dynes Bridge, Bann Bridge 1838, Shillington Bridge 1970, Bann Railway Bridge, M1 Bridge 1967.

==Lower Bann==


The Lower Bann flows from Lough Neagh at Toome to the Atlantic Ocean at Barmouth, located behind Portstewart Golf Club, between Portstewart and Castlerock. The Lower Bann is long and is a canalised waterway, with five navigation locks, at Toome, Portna, Movanagher, Carnroe and Castleroe. The river is very popular with water sports enthusiasts, anglers and cruisers and has minimal commercial traffic. It acts as most of the border between County Antrim and County Londonderry. The only commercial port on the river is at Coleraine. Ships from Londonderry Port and the Port of Belfast transfer coal and scrap metal.
The water level on the Lower Bann is controlled by the Rivers Agency using gates situated at Portna (near Kilrea) and The Cutts at Coleraine.

==Lower Bann tributaries==

Major tributaries include the Clady River Inveroe Burn, Agivey River, Macosquin Rhee River, Ballymoney River and Articlave River.

==Lower Bann Bridges==
The bridges over the Lower Bann are:
* B18 Old Toome Bridge (1860s Old, 1968 New)
* A6 New Toome Bridge (2004)
* A42 Portglenone Bridge (1853)
* B64 Kilrea Bridge (1783)
* B66 Agivey Bridge (1859 Old, 1980 New)
* A29 Sandelford Bridge (1975)
* A2 Coleraine Bridge (1844)
* Millennium Waterside Footbridge (2001)
* Bann Bridge Railway Bridge (1924)

==History==
Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) described a river mouth called Αργιτα (&quot;Argita&quot;, &quot;shining&quot;), referring to the Bann.
The Lower Bann provides the only outlet for Lough Neagh, the largest freshwater lake in the British Isles, which is fed by six major rivers, including the Upper Bann. The ability of the lake to absorb large quantities of flood water is limited, and consequently, the areas around the lake are prone to flooding. The Lower Bann encountered a large shoal of rock at Portna, which reduced the effectiveness of the outflow, and in 1738, Francis Hutchinson, the Bishop of Down and Connor petitioned the Irish Parliament to do something about the shoals, and hence the annual flooding that affected his people. Although Parliament responded encouragingly, no actual work was done, and the problem remained.

In 1822, the Scottish engineer Alexander Nimmo proposed a radical solution. The Newry Canal provided a route southwards from Lough Neagh to Carlingford Lough, but it rose to a summit and then descended again. His proposal was to lower the summit level so that it was below the level of Lough Neagh, remove all the locks, and so provide a second outlet to the sea. Not only would it solve the problems of flooding, but it would also solve the inadequate water supply for the canal, eliminate lock maintenance, and could generate around 2,200 kW as the water would still have to fall by . The plan was a little too ambitious and failed to win support.

In 1842, the Board of Works were authorised by an Act of Parliament to carry out works in the Lough Neagh basin, which would improve navigation, drainage and milling. A series of public meetings were held, and a survey was made of the Lower Bann. The Board of Works then instructed their own engineer to carry out a survey. John McMahon estimated that it would cost £183,775 to improve the Lower Bann from Lough Neagh to the sea, and that the navigation works accounted for less than half of this, with the drainage works making up the rest. Removal of the Portna shoal would reduce the level of the lake surface by some . The plan was well received, and work began in 1847.

Charles Ottley acted as chief engineer but found difficulty in recruiting a labour force. The number of men looking for work had been reduced by famine and emigration, and the railways were competing for workers. The project took eleven years to complete. A double-chambered lock was constructed at Portna, where the shoal was removed, and four other locks were needed to negotiate the difference in levels. Quays and swing bridges were erected, and various alterations had to be made around Lough Neagh to cope with the drop in the surface level. The final lock on the Lagan Canal, the Coalisland Canal and the Ulster Canal had to be rebuilt with a lower cill and deeper lock gates, and the River Blackwater had to be made deeper and wider. The cost of the project overran by £50,000 and the government was asked to make up the shortfall. The Upper Bann Navigation included the River Bann between its junction with the Newry Canal at Whitecoat Point and Lough Neagh, a route across Lough Neagh to the mouth of the Blackwater, and the lower of the Blackwater as far as Blackwatertown.
This was one of four works of navigation part funded by the Treasury during the famine years in Ireland. The other three were the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal linking Lough Erne to the river Shannon across County Leitrim; Loughs Corrib, Mask and Carra in counties Galway and Mayo; and Lough Oughter and Lough Gowna in County Cavan. The Upper Bann Navigation was the only one completed to its full design extent. The Final Award for this scheme was made on 13 April 1859. The finished scheme was not well received by the counties through which it ran. As originally conceived, revenue from tolls and water power on the Lower Bann would finance maintenance work on the Upper Bann. Instead, three separate Trusts were set up. These were the Upper Bann Navigation Trust, the Lower Bann Navigation Trust and the Lough Neagh Drainage Trust. The adjoining counties appointed representatives to each and also financed their continued operation. Those to the south of the lake had to contribute towards the drainage and navigation works which had been completed, and also find £800 per year for ongoing maintenance, with no source of income to cover it. Coleraine was expanded as a port, but even the Lower Bann did not generate the expected revenue, and the adjoining counties had to finance an annual deficit of around £400. A passenger service between Coleraine and Toomebridge was started in 1863, but the increased flow on the river made travel upstream difficult, and the service was abandoned. Like so many schemes that tried to combine drainage and navigation, this one did neither particularly well.

Flooding around the southern shores of Lough Neagh continued to be a problem, and in 1882 the chairman of Portadown Town Commissioners suggested that Alexander Nimmo&#x27;s scheme should be revived. The Upper Bann would be made much deeper near the lough, so that its flow could be reversed, and the amount of water entering the lough reduced correspondingly. The proposal was no better received than when Nimmo had originally made it. Both the Monck Commission, which sat in the early 1880s, and an enquiry into the Board of Works held in 1887, suggested that for the benefit of flood relief, the navigation should be abandoned, and that the three Trusts were counter-productive. No action was taken, and when the President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Sir Alexander Binnie, was asked for his advice in 1906, he came to a similar conclusion. He suggested that a canalised river, which in winter had a flow of between was never going to succeed. Again his advice was ignored, as the navigation works were still relatively new. The counties continued to fund the annual deficit.

A proposal to build a hydro-electric scheme across the Lower Bann in 1925 came to nothing, and four years later, the Lough Neagh Drainage Trust and the Lower Bann Navigation Trust were disbanded, with the Ministry of Finance assuming responsibility for the river. The counties contributing to the Upper Bann Navigation Trust appealed for that to be disbanded too, but the appeal was refused and they had to continue funding it. Some improvements to weirs were made by the Ministry of Finance, and there was some traffic, consisting mostly of sand dredged from Lough Neagh and used by brickworks. Finally, in 1954, responsibility for the Upper Bann was transferred to the Ministry of Commerce, the Trust was disbanded, and the navigation was abandoned. The Lower Bann has seen an increase in use by pleasure craft, and now supports four marinas, two at Coleraine, one at Drumaheglis and one at Portglenone.

<doc id="1077727" wikidata="Q30493" url="?curid=1077727" title="Aiguille de Bionnassay">
<text>The Aiguille de Bionnassay (elevation ) is a mountain in the Mont Blanc massif of the Alps in France and Italy. It has been described as &quot;one of the most attractive satellite peaks of Mont Blanc&quot;, and is located on its western side. The mountain&#x27;s south and east ridges form the frontier between the two countries, and its summit is a knife-edge crest of snow and ice. Reaching it via any route provides a &quot;splendid and serious snow and ice climb&quot;.

==Glaciers==
Three significant glaciers originate on the slopes of the mountain: The Glacier de Bionnassay, the Glacier de Bionnassay Italien, and the Glacier de Miage.

The Glacier de Bionnassay is the most obvious glacial feature, arising on the north and north-west slopes of the Aiguille de Bionnassay as well as from the western side of the Dôme du Goûter and the Aiguille du Goûter. It descends for approximately 4.5 km, flowing north-westwards before turning north at the foot of the Nid d&#x27;Aigle to end some distance above the settlement of Bionnassay, continuing as the Torrent de Bionnassay. This hanging glacier on the north-west face of the Aiguille de Bionnassay provides a route of access for mountaineers with ice-climbing skills.

The Glacier de Bionnassay Italien arises from a cirque between the south eastern side of the Aiguille de Bionnassay, the Col de Bionnassay and the Calotte des Aiguilles Grises. It descends south-south west for 2.5 km below the Col Infranchissable, then turns south-east to merge with other glaciers, thence continuing as the Glacier du Miage (Ghiacciaio del Miage) – a total distance of approximately 9 km, forming the longest glacier in Italy.

The Glacier de Miage – not to be confused with the much larger Glacier &quot;du&quot; Miage on the Italian side (see above) – forms from snows collecting between the Aiguille de Tricot and the south-western face of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. The glacier descends in a south-westerly direction for approximately 2.5 km.

==Alpinism==

===History===

The first ascent of the Aiguille de Bionnassay was undertaken on 28 July 1865 by Florence Crauford Grove, Edward N. Buxton and Reginald S. McDonald, with guides Jean Pierre Cachat and Michel Payot. They ascended the north-west face to reach the ridge above the Aiguille de Tricot, from where they continued to the knife-edged summit ridge, arriving in a thunderstorm. A detailed account is given below.

The mountain&#x27;s south ridge was first climbed on 13 July 1888 by Kaspar Maurer, Andreas Jaun and the Austrian diplomat Georg Gruber.

The east ridge was first climbed in descent as part of a traverse from the Dômes de Miage by Katharine Richardson, Emile Rey and Jean-Baptiste Bich on 13 August 1888.

The long west ridge was first climbed in its entirety from the Col de Tricot in 1911 by Fraulein Eleonore Hasenclever and Freulein H. Wirthl with M. Helff, K.G. von Saar and Richard Weitzenbock.

The complete north-west face route was finally climbed in 1926 by billionaire businessman and art collector, Robert Wylie Lloyd, with his guides Adolf and Josep Pollinger.

The first winter ascent of the Aiguille de Bionnassay was made on 20 March 1929 by A. Charlet, F. Frison Roche, H. Hoerlin, E.Schneider and H. Schroeder.

The north face was first climbed on 30–31 August 1953 by Bertrand Kempf and Claude Laurendeau. It is ranked as one of the most difficult ice walls in the Alps, and is rarely attempted.

===Routes===
* North-West Face: Graded at AD, the route is a steep, glaciated face between 40 and 55 degrees. There are numerous small crevasses in its steep slope providing sufficient resting places to reduce the exposure, but it is a long, demanding route of over 1 km, and can be difficult in times of hard ice. Climbers usually start from the Tête Rousse Hut. It is regarded as the finest route on the mountain, and one of the best of its class in the Alps. After snow it is avalanche prone; in one such incident in 1968 four climbers died.
* South Ridge: An ascent from the Col de Miage (&quot;Durier Hut&quot;) provides the easiest route to the summit. The route consists of snowy ridges, rock ledges and chimneys. It is graded at PD+ with rock pitches of II, often iced. A final steep snow ridge leads to the narrow and exposed summit on the French/Italian border.
* East Ridge: Described as &quot;a superb snow crest which is often precarious and delicate due to large cornices&quot;, the east ridge descends from the summit as an exposed and delicate knife-edge crest to the col de Bionnassay. It is graded AD and can be reached from a traverse of the Bionnassay, or from the Gonella Hut.
* West Ridge: A long 3.4 km ascent from the Col du Tricot over the Aigulle du Tricot, graded at PD.
* Traverse: Crossing the mountain as part of a three-day ascent of Mont Blanc involves climbing up the south ridge of the Aiguille de Bionnassay from the Col de Miage, then descending from the summit down its razor-sharp, icy, and often corniced east (frontier) ridge. From there the route climbs again up the west ridge of the Dome du Gouter, past the Vallot Hut, to reach the Bosses ridge and thence to the summit of Mont Blanc. The route has been described as &#x27;a truly magical expedition of ice and snow aretes at great altitude&#x27;. The Durier Hut on the Col de Miage can either be reached directly from the village of Tresse via an increasingly broken slope of scree in its upper reaches, or via a traverse from the Conscrits Hut over the Dômes de Miage.

<text>Brazil is a live album by Australian band Men at Work, released in 1998. This album was recorded at a live show at Olympia music venue in Brazil, hence the title. It was first released there as Brazil &#x27;96, but for the international release, the year was removed and a new studio recording, &quot;The Longest Night&quot;, was added. &quot;The Longest Night&quot; had long been part of the group&#x27;s live set, being played in concert at least since 1983.

==Reception==
In their retrospective review, AllMusic wrote that: &quot;The new members sound almost identical to the originals, and with a stellar set list composed almost entirely of classic material, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to hear the difference between the Men at Work lineups of 1996 and 1983.&quot;

==Track listing==
Notes:
* All songs recorded live during Men at Work&#x27;s tour of Brazil in May &#x27;96, except &quot;The Longest Night&quot; which was recorded in Secret Garden Studio (Melbourne) in March &#x27;98.

<doc id="1077732" wikidata="Q3059075" url="?curid=1077732" title="Thames Estuary">
<text>The Thames Estuary is where the River Thames meets the waters of the North Sea, in the south-east of Great Britain.

==Limits==
An estuary can be defined according to different criteria (e.g. tidal, geographical, navigational or in terms of salinity). For this reason the limits of the Thames Estuary have been defined differently at different times and for different purposes.

===Western===
This limit of the estuary has been defined in two main ways:

* The narrow estuary is strongly tidal and is known as the Tideway. It starts in south-west London at Teddington Lock and weir, Teddington/Ham. This point is also mid-way between Richmond Lock which only keeps back a few miles of human-made head (stasis) of water during low tide and the extreme modern-era head at Thames Ditton Island on Kingston reach where slack water occurs at maximal high tide in times of rainfall-caused flooded banks. In terms of salinity the transition from freshwater to estuarine occurs around Battersea; east of the Thames Barrier the water is of notable brackishness where fish, particularly in dry summers on the &quot;flood&quot; (the incoming) tide, are estuarine. 

* The head of &quot;Sea Reach&quot;the &quot;Kent / Essex Strait&quot;south of Canvey Island on the northern (Essex) shore. This reach and all more eastern zones (a mixture of channels and shoals) have a width that contributes to the large, archetypal, internal but mainly submerged sandbanks. These come from a combination of silt-borne fluvial and tidal scouring and deposition (silting).

===Eastern===

The transition between the Thames Estuary and the North Sea has been located at various notional boundaries, including:
* The Yantlet Line between the Crow Stone (London Stone) on the northern foreshore at Chalkwell, Westcliff-on-Sea and another London Stone off the Isle of Grain, to the south. (This marked the seaward limit of the river jurisdiction successively of the City of London and the Thames Conservancy).
* A line between Havengore Creek, Essex (to the north), and Warden Point, east Sheppey, Kent (to the south), tallying with the easternmost hazardous point of the Nore sandbank. (This formed the seaward limit of the Port of London Authority on its establishment in 1908).
* A line between North Foreland, Margate, Kent via the &quot;Kentish Knock lighthouse&quot; to Harwich in Essex. Here begin sandbanks of the bight of this shallow sea. Per a Hydrological Survey of 1882–9. (This tallies with the eastern edge of the current seaward limit of the Port of London Authority as defined in 1964).

==Tides==
The estuary just east of the Tideway has a tidal range of 4 metres. Winds excluded, it moves at in bi-monthly spring tides.

==Economy==
===Shipping===
The estuary is one of the largest of 170 such inlets on the coast of Great Britain. It constitutes a major shipping route, with thousands of movements each year, including: large oil tankers, container ships, bulk carriers (of loose materials/liquids), and roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) ferries. It is the accessway for the Port of London (including London Gateway, associated Tilbury and Purfleet) and the Medway Ports of Sheerness, Chatham and Thamesport.

The traditional Thames sailing barge worked in this area, designed to be suitable for the shallow waters in the smaller ports.

===Wind farms===
A 2000s-decade-built wind farm is 8.5 km north of Herne Bay, Kent, on a shoal south-west of Kentish Knock. It is 30 wind turbines generating typically 82.4MW of electricity.

The much larger 630 MW London Array was inaugurated in 2013.

==Greater Thames Estuary==
The term Greater Thames Estuary applies to the coast and the low-lying lands bordering the estuary. These are characterised by the presence of mudflats, low-lying open beaches, and salt marshes, namely the North Kent Marshes and the Essex Marshes. Human-made embankments are backed by reclaimed wetland grazing areas, but rising sea levels may make it necessary briefly to flood some of that land at spring tides, to take the pressure off the defences and main watercourses.
There are many smaller estuaries in Essex, including the rivers Colne, Blackwater and Crouch. Small coastal villages depend on an economy of fishing, boat-building, and yachting. The Isle of Sheppey, the Isle of Grain, Canvey Island, Two Tree Island, Havengore Island, New England Island, Rushley Island, Potton Island, Foulness Island and Mersea Island are part of the coastline.

Where higher land reaches the coast, there are some larger settlements, such as Clacton-on-Sea to the north in Essex, Herne Bay, Kent, and the Southend-on-Sea area within the narrower part of the estuary.

The Thames Estuary is the focal part of the 21st-century toponym, the &quot;Thames Gateway&quot;, designated as one of the principal development areas in Southern England.

The Thames Estuary 2050 Growth Commission report published in June 2018 identified the economic potential of the region. In 2020 the Thames Estuary Growth Board was appointed, led by government-appointed Envoy Kate Willard OBE, to unlock the potential of the UK&#x27;s number one green growth opportunity. 

Entrepreneurs and investors have looked at the greater estuary as a possible place for a new airport, and have expanded Southend Airport in the 2010s, which has a rail link to Liverpool Street station, London among others.

==Salinity==

The Thames flowing through London is an archetypal, well-developed economy urban, upper river estuary with its sedimentary deposition restricted through manmade embankments and occasional dredging of parts. It is mainly a freshwater river about as far east as Battersea, insofar as the average salinity is very low and the fish fauna consists predominantly of freshwater species such as roach, dace, carp, perch, and pike. It becomes brackish between Battersea and Gravesend, and the diversity of freshwater fish is smaller, primarily roach and dace. Euryhaline species then dominate, such as flounder, European seabass, mullet, and smelt. Further east salinity increases and conditions become fully marine and the fish fauna resemble that of the adjacent North Sea, a spectrum of euryhaline and stenohaline types. An alike pattern of zones applies to the aquatic plants and invertebrates.

==Cultural references==
Joseph Conrad lived in Stanford-le-Hope close to the Essex marshes. His &quot;The Mirror of the Sea&quot; (1906) contains a memorable description of the area as seen from the Thames. He refers to this area in the first pages of his novel &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, describing it as both the launching place of England&#x27;s great ships of exploration and colonization and, in ancient times, the site of colonization of the British Isles by the Roman Empire.

;Accent
The form of speech of many of the people of the area, principally the accents of those from Kent and Essex, is often known as Estuary English. The term is a term for a milder variety of the &quot;London Accent&quot;. The spread of Estuary English extends many hundreds of miles outside London, and all of the neighbouring home counties around London have residents who moved from London and brought their version of London accents with them, leading to interference with the established local accents. The term &quot;London Accent&quot; is generally avoided, as it can have many meanings. Forms of &quot;Estuary English&quot;, as a hybrid between Received pronunciation and various London accents, can be heard in all of the New Towns, all of the coastal resorts, and in the larger cities and towns along the Thames Estuary.

== Channels==

For commercial shipping rounding the Nore sandbank and thus accessing Greater London, main deep-water routes were the Princes-Queens Channel and the South Channel to the south, to a lesser extent the Kings Channel and the Swin to the north. The Swin was used by barges and leisure craft from the Essex rivers, and coasters and colliers from the north east. These channels were made up of natural troughs; Yantlet Channel (Sea Reach), Oaze Deep, Knock John Channel, Black Deep/Black Deep Channel which have been much-marked. These are separated by slow-moving sandbanks with names such as the East and West Barrows, the Nob, the Knock, Kentish Knock, the John, the Sunk, the Girdler, and Long Sand/the Long Sands.

Shallow-bottomed barges and coasters would navigate the swatchways at flood tide, and would cross the sand banks at spitways, points where the water was least shallow, and just deep enough at that point of the tide. If they missed the moment they would heave to (lay anchor) and wait for the next tide.

Recreational craft are expected use channels most suited to the size of their vessel.
Their main guide says to use when navigating to or from:
*the north: the Middle Deep, Swin, Warp and Barrow Deep.
*the south/due east: the Horse and Gore and Four Fathom Channels.

To cross the south-east quarter of the estuary large vessels use Fisherman&#x27;s Gat, and small vessels to were expected to use Foulger&#x27;s Gat.

== Navigational marks ==
===History===

Provision of buoys and beacons for the purpose of navigation came relatively late to England (compared to the Netherlands, for example). Instead, coastal navigators and pilots relied on the use of transits (the alignment of prominent structures or natural features on land) for guidance. In 1566 Trinity House of Deptford (which oversaw pilotage on the Thames) was empowered to &#x27;make, erect and set up [...] beacons, marks and signs for the sea&#x27; (albeit at its own expense). Not long afterwards, the decay of the steeple of Margate Church (an important landmark for negotiating &#x27;the Narrows&#x27;, a complex route between sandbanks used by vessels sailing to or from London along the North Kent coast) led to Trinity House marking the Narrows with buoys in the late 16th century. 

In his coastal survey of 1682-93, Greenvile Collins records five buoys around the Narrows, just north of Reculver, on the southern approach to the Thames. The Swin (the northern approach) was marked with buoys at the easternmost points of the Gunfleet, Middle and Buxey sands, and by beacons on the Whitaker, Shoe and Blacktail spits. A buoy marked the easternmost point of the Nore sandbank at this time, and three more buoys marked sandbanks in the middle part of the estuary (Spaniard, Red Sand and the Oaze). 

The Nore Lightship, the world&#x27;s first lightvessel, was established in the Estuary as a private venture in 1732 to mark the &#x27;best position for entering the Thames and Medway, and to clear the Nore Sand&#x27;. The coastwise approach from the north was aided by the establishment of the Sunk lightvessel in 1802 &#x27;to mark the north-east entrance to East Swin, and to guide vessels round Long Sand&#x27;. Later, the Swin channel was further marked by lightvessels at Swin Middle (1837) and Mouse (1838), and by screw-pile lighthouses on the Maplin Sands (1841) and at Gunfleet (1856). Meanwhile, one of the outlying sandbanks of the Estuary was marked by a lightvessel at Kentish Knock (in 1840); and in due course the southern approach was marked by lightvessels at the Tongue (1847) and Girdler (1848) sands, with another being added (between these two) in the Princes Channel (1856). In 1851 two more screw-pile lighthouses were built further upriver, on the northern foreshore of Sea Reach: at Mucking and on the Chapman sands (just off Canvey Island).

Prior to 1684 beacons were set up on the mudflats north of the Swin channel, to help vessels approaching the Thames from the north to navigate the sands. Pan-sand Beacon was set up by Trinity House in 1774 to mark a dangerous sandbank on the southern approach. Similar daymarks were set up on other nearby sandbanks in later years, including on Margate Hook (1843), Middle Ground (1844) and Shingles (1846). Trinity House also maintained beacons further upriver, including at Broadness (established in 1821), Stoneness (1839), Erith (1830) and Tripcock (1832).

In 1864 responsibility for maintaining the navigation lights of the River Thames between London Bridge and Yantlet was transferred by Act of Parliament from the Thames Conservancy to the Corporation of Trinity House; responsibility for buoyage was transferred likewise in 1878. In 1885 the beacons at Broadness and Stoneness were replaced with iron-frame experimental lighthouses, each lit by a novel system which would allow the light to function unattended (except for a twice-weekly visit by a boatman for cleaning and maintenance). Broadness was lit by Pintsch gas, and Stoneness by a Lindberg light (which burned petroleum naphtha). At the same time Trinity House began experimenting with the application of lamps to buoys, using Pintsch&#x27;s oil-gas system, beginning with three in the Thames Estuary (East Oaze, Ovens and Sheerness Middle); the experiment was deemed a success and subsequently further buoys and beacons were lit by Trinity House using the same system, in the Estuary and beyond. 

Today the Port of London Authority&#x27;s Thames Navigation Service (established in 1959) is responsible for buoyage, beaconage and bridge lights on the Tideway. Trinity House remains responsible for aids to navigation in the wider estuary (and beyond).

===Thames estuary navigation marks===

This table shows, from west to east, the principal navigation lights, buoys and other marks to the north (port) and south (starboard) of the main deep-water channels of the River Thames from Gallions Reach to the Sunk Light Float. The Thames is in IALA region A so port buoys are red and starboard buoys are green.

<text>In architecture, a project architect (PA) is an individual who is responsible for overseeing the architectural aspects of the development of a design, production of the construction documents (plans), and specifications, from which actively uses a variety of intellectual disciplines in engineering, law, and business, for the projects of the architectural environment.

== Roles ==
The position generally involves coordinating the needs of a client, designer, technical staff, outside consultants such as structural, civil, and mechanical engineers, as well as interior designers and landscape architects.

The specific tasks of a project architect are usually associated with architectural design, construction materials and methods and the production of construction documents (floor plans, elevations, etc.). Other responsibilities range from client relations to zoning and building code management, material specifications, maintaining quality control by checking and making revisions to shop drawings.

The project architect can also assume the role of the project manager (PM) in a small studio, but typically, the project architect is only responsible for the design management of a building project, assisted by interns and other staff. A project architect is required to be registered as an architect in the state in which they are performing the role. Intern architects may perform the role under the supervision of a registered architect but may not sign or seal legal documents. 

The project architect may, but does not often, sign contracts, or seal construction documents or payment applications, which are most often legally signed and sealed by a state registered owner or partner of the architectural office. This liability is covered by the firm, and the legal responsibility for any architectural design errors and omissions ultimately falls on the registered architect; the owner or partner in an architectural firm.

<text>John Vincent Weber (born July 24, 1952) is an American politician and lobbyist from Minnesota. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1993.

==Early life and education==
Weber was born in Slayton, Minnesota. He attended the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities from 1970 to 1974.

==Career==

Weber was press secretary to Representative Tom Hagedorn from 1974 to 1975 and a senior aide to Senator Rudy Boschwitz from 1977 to 1980. He had been the co-publisher of Murray County, Minnesota newspaper from 1976 to 1978 and the president of Weber Publishing Company. Weber was a delegate to the Minnesota State Republican conventions in 1972 and 1978. In 1980, at the age of 28, he was elected to the U. S. House of Representatives, defeating Archie Baumann, 53% to 47%. Baumann had been an aide to former Representative Rick Nolan.

Weber chose not to run for reelection in 1992 and retired from Congress following the House banking scandal, in which he was implicated for writing 125 bad checks worth nearly $48,000.

As secretary of the House Republican Conference and key adviser to incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich, he was considered one of the architects of the Republicans&#x27; success in 1994. He was a commentator on NPR the following year about developments in Congress after the Republicans took control of the House, providing commentary on the &quot;revolution&quot; he had helped create. Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting reported that Weber frequently offered his opinions on NPR about health care issues, but never revealed that he was a paid lobbyist for several health insurance giants.

Weber was a member of the now defunct Project for the New American Century (PNAC) and was one of the signers of the PNAC Letter sent to US President Bill Clinton on January 26, 1998, advocating &quot;the removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime from power&quot;, along with Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and 29 other notable Republicans.

Weber opened and managed the Washington, D.C. branch of lobbying firm Clark &amp; Weinstock. In 2006, home mortgage giant Freddie Mac paid Weber $360,297 to lobby on its behalf to fend off meaningful regulation in the lead-up to the subprime mortgage crisis. Weber also lobbied for Gazprom, Russia&#x27;s state-owned natural gas company. In 2011, Clark &amp; Weinstock merged with Mercury, and Weber became a partner in the combined firm.

Weber is a prominent strategist in the Republican Party, serving as a top advisor on Dole for President in 1996, the Bush reelection campaign in 2004, and Mitt Romney for President in 2008. Weber is chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy, a private, nonprofit organization designed to strengthen democratic institutions around the world through nongovernmental efforts. He is a senior fellow at the Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota, where he is co-director of the Policy Forum. He also serves on the Advisory Board of the Institute for Law and Politics at the University of Minnesota Law School and the nonprofit radio show America Abroad.

Weber is a board member of several private-sector and nonprofit organizations, including the now-defunct ITT Technical Institute, Department 56, and the Aspen Institute. He also serves on the board of The Council on Foreign Relations and co-chaired the Independent Task Force on U.S. Policy toward Reform in the Arab World with former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. In addition, Weber is a member of the United States Secretary of Energy&#x27;s Advisory Board.

Weber was one of the Republicans who turned against the surprise Donald Trump candidacy, telling &quot;CNBC&quot; on August 3, 2016, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;d remain a Republican if he becomes president.&quot; But in 2019, Weber said that the Trump administration &quot;was not as bad as I thought it would be&quot; and that he would &quot;probably&quot; support Trump for reelection.

On August 17, 2016, the Associated Press reported that Mercury Public Affairs LLC, which Weber heads, had received $1.02 million from Paul Manafort&#x27;s European Centre for a Modern Ukraine to lobby Congress to support pro-Russia Viktor Yanukovych during the Autumn 2012 Ukrainian elections and to block the release from prison of Yanukovich&#x27;s rival, Yulia Tymoshenko. For his lobbying Congress on behalf of pro-Russia entities, Weber received at least $700,000.

Established in 2012, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine had been supported by Yanukovich&#x27;s pro-Russia Party of Regions and continued to pay Mercury for lobbying until February 2014, when Yanukovich fled Ukraine for Russia after the Maidan revolution. From 2012 until February 2014 and directed by Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, Weber, who was the principal for Mercury&#x27;s Ukraine-related lobbying portfolio beginning in 2012, acted as an unregistered agent of a foreign government and foreign political party, a felony offense under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), with a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. On April 28, 2017, Mercury retroactively filed with FARA within the Justice Department that it had been hired by the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. Mercury had filed its lobbying efforts with Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. Files between Mercury and the Manafort and Gates firms connected to Yanukovich and his Party of Regions were subpoenaed by the Mueller special counsel investigation.

In July 2018, New York prosecutors were referred by Mueller to investigate any wrongdoing by Weber and Mercury Public Affairs LLC. The United States Department of Justice dropped the probe of Weber and Mercury Public Affairs LLC in September 2019.

<doc id="1077757" wikidata="Q2973857" url="?curid=1077757" title="Division of Swan">
<text>The Division of Swan is an Australian electoral division located in Western Australia.

Swan is a marginal electorate that has swung between both major political parties in the past two decades. It extends across the Swan River from central Perth, and covers most of the area between the Swan and Canning Rivers.

The seat includes a mix of incomes and housing types, from low-price flats to affluent suburbs with Swan River views. The electorate includes the campus of Curtin University, the Welshpool and Kewdale industrial areas, and Perth Airport. Swan covers 151 sq. kilometres.

The current MP is Zaneta Mascarenhas, a member of the Australian Labor Party. She was elected in the 2022 election.

==History==

The division was one of the original 65 divisions contested at the first federal election in 1901. It was one of five electorates created by the &quot;Federal House of Representatives Western Australian Electorates Act 1900&quot;, an act of the parliament of Western Australia. The original bill introduced by Premier John Forrest provided for the seat to be named &quot;Occidental&quot; rather than Swan.

Historically, the electorate was a country seat extending north to Dongara, east to Merredin and south to the coast. It contracted to an area east of the Darling Range and became a safe Country Party seat. Prior to the 1949 election, its old area became the new seat of Moore, while Swan moved into approximately its present position, although initially extending as far north-east as Midland.

For several decades, Swan has been a marginal seat, extending along the Swan and Canning Rivers from the affluent suburbs in the City of South Perth to the west, which typically vote for the Liberal Party, to the City of Belmont to the east and parts of the City of Canning to the south-east, which are more working-class in orientation and typically vote for the Labor Party. From 2004 to 2007 it was the third most marginal electorate in Australia, after Hindmarsh and Kingston, with the ALP incumbent Kim Wilkie winning 50.08 percent of the two-party-preferred vote in 2004. A redistribution ahead of the 2010 election added the strongly Labor-voting suburb of Langford, which was previously within Tangney, which made it a notionally Labor seat. Langford was redistributed to Burt in 2016.

At the 2007 election, Liberal candidate Steve Irons won the seat with a swing of 0.19 percent. Irons was the only Coalition challenger to unseat a Labor incumbent at the 2007 election. However, the election came at a very bad time for the state Labor government, which was only polling at 49 percent support at the time the writs were dropped. Irons was re-elected with a slightly increased majority in 2010, making it a fairly safe Liberal seat. Following the 2016 election Labor candidate Tammy Solonec managed to return Swan to marginal status.

Steve Irons retained the seat in the 2019 election. Hannah Beazley contested the seat for Labor but ultimately conceded defeat. After Steve Iron&#x27;s retirement at the 2022 Australian federal election, the seat was contested by Kristy McSweeney from the Liberal Party. She was defeated by Zaneta Mascarenhas from the Labor Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

In August 2021, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) announced that Swan would lose the suburb of Wilson to the seat of Tangney and gain the suburbs of Maida Vale and Wattle Grove and the remainder of Forrestfield and High Wycombe from the seat of Hasluck. These boundary changes took place as of the 2022 election.

Swan is bordered by the Swan River in the north and west, the Canning River and the City of Canning in the south, and Roe Highway, Great Eastern Highway and Perth Airport in the east. Suburbs include:

<text>Brogdale is a hamlet in Kent, England, immediately south of the M2 motorway, south of Faversham. It is one of several hamlets making up the civil parish of Ospringe and is in the Borough of Swale. Its western half is in the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==History==
Brogdale was once called Brokedale. This name is shared with the family of John de Brokedale, its lords of the manor of the early middle ages. After no Brokedale sons or other male-line issue remaining, the manor was owned by John Clerk – living in Brogdale in 1383. In 1734, the manor was owned by John Knowler, Mayor of Faversham.

On 10 August 2003 the temperature at Brogdale reached , once a record for the United Kingdom.

==Farm==

Brogdale Farm is home to the National Fruit Collection, one of the largest collections of fruit trees and plants in the world. Spread over it hosts the collection since it moved from Wisley in 1952. In the 1980s, the Government cut funding to the site, with closure threatened by March 1990. In response, the Brogdale Horticultural Trust took over co-ownership of the farm with Wye College. It has been the home of Faversham miniature railway since 2001.

The farm runs regular fruit-themed festivals throughout the summer and autumn:
*the Cherry Festival in July
*the Cider Festival in August
*the Apple Festival in October. 

During the fairs, visitors can explore the orchards and several experts give talks on the produce.

<doc id="1077767" wikidata="Q7043538" url="?curid=1077767" title="No. 47 Squadron RAF">
<text>No. 47 Squadron is an inactive squadron of the Royal Air Force. Formed in 1916, it saw service during the First World War in the UK and in Greece. Between the wars it served in Egypt and Sudan, and at the outbreak of the Second World war undertook bombing operations against Italian positions in Eritrea. Later it was based in Libya and Tunisia, taking part in anti-shipping operations in the Mediterranean. In 1944 the squadron moved to India, and began operations against the Japanese in Burma and elsewhere.

After the end of the war, it became a transport squadron, and returned to the United Kingdom. In 1968 it began a long association with the Lockheed Hercules, becoming part of the Lyneham Transport Wing. Subsequently it was based at RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, until it was disbanded in 2023. 

==History==

===First World War===

No. 47 Squadron Royal Flying Corps was formed at Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire on 1 March 1916 as a home defence unit, protecting Hull and East Yorkshire against attack by German Zeppelins, being equipped with a mix of aircraft, including Armstrong Whitworth F.K.3s, FK.8s and Royal Aircraft Factory BE.12s. After six months training and flying defensive patrols, the squadron was sent to Salonika in Greece, to support forces fighting on the Macedonian Front, arriving on 20 September 1916, although two flights were left behind in Yorkshire, joining 33 Squadron.

Whilst in Greece, it retained a mixture of aircraft, with two flights being used for reconnaissance and bombing while the third flight operated fighters. When the German battlecruiser &quot;Goeben&quot; ran aground in the Dardanelles after the Battle of Imbros, three 47 Squadron aircraft were sent to attack the stranded ship. Despite continual attacks from these and other aircraft little damage was done to the &quot;Goeben&quot; owing to the light bombs used. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Flying Corps became part of the Royal Air Force, and the fighter flights (by now equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5A) of both 47 Squadron and No. 17 Squadron were detached to form 150 Squadron. 47 Squadron, now divested of its fighters, and solely equipped with Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8s, was used mainly in the Corps Reconnaissance role, but were used to bomb the retreating Bulgarian forces following the Allied offensive of September 1918.

===Interwar===
After the end of World War I, in April 1919, the squadron was sent to Southern Russia to help General Denikin&#x27;s White Russian forces in their fight against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War. While the RAF&#x27;s ostensible mission was purely to provide training to Denikin&#x27;s forces, No. 47 Squadron was included in the mission in order to carry out operational sorties. It was equipped with a mixture of aircraft, with flights equipped with Airco DH.9 and DH.9A bombers and Sopwith Camel fighters. The squadron&#x27;s flights operated independently, carrying out bombing and strafing missions against Bolshevik forces. One notable incident occurred on 30 July 1919, when, during an attack by C Flight DH.9s on Bolshevik gunboats at Tcherni-Yar, the DH.9 flown by William Elliot was shot down. On seeing this, the DH.9 flown by Captain Anderson, despite itself receiving damage that required his gunner, Lt Mitchell to climb onto the wing and block a leaking fuel tank with his thumb, landed next to the stricken aircraft to rescue its crew. Anderson and Mitchell were recommended for the Victoria Cross for this action, but in the end they were awarded the Distinguished Service Order. No. 47 Squadron was disbanded on 7 October 1919, being re-designated &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron, Royal Air Force Instructional Mission, South Russia.

Although it was not a fighter unit, the squadron did have at least two aces serve in it: Samuel Kinkead and Charles Green.

On 1 February 1920 the squadron was re-formed at RAF Helwan in Egypt when 206 Squadron was re-numbered. It was a day bomber squadron equipped with the DH.9, re-equipping with Airco DH.9As in 1921. One of the duties was policing in Sudan and the squadron detached aircraft to Khartoum. Another important task carried out during the Squadron&#x27;s early years in Egypt was to help survey and mark out the route of the Cairo to Baghdad air route, and to carry air mail along that route. Between 27 October and 19 November 1925, three aircraft, led by Squadron Leader Arthur Coningham (later an Air Vice Marshal and commander of the Western Desert Air Force during the Second World War), carried out the first RAF round trip flight between Egypt and Kano, Nigeria, covering 6,500 miles in 24 days, with 85 hours flying time.

In October 1927 the squadron moved completely to Khartoum and in December it discarded its aging DH.9As in favour of Fairey IIIFs, becoming the first Squadron to receive this aircraft. The squadron co-operated with the Sudan Defence Force, regularly carrying out border patrols, while a flight of IIIFs was fitted with floats, flying patrols over the River Nile and the Red Sea. It also continued to carry out long range flights, flying from Egypt to The Gambia in 1930, and carrying out four training flights to South Africa. The Squadron replaced its IIIFs with Fairey Gordons (effectively IIIFs powered by a radial engine) in January 1933, continuing its operations in support of the Sudan Defence Force and floatplane patrols over the Red Sea.

In July 1936 the squadron re-equipped with the Vickers Vincent, although some float-equipped Gordons were kept until June 1939. In June 1939 the squadron started to operate the Vickers Wellesley monoplane, retaining a flight of Vincents for Army co-operation purposes.

===Second World War===
====East Africa and the Mediterranean (1939–1944)====
To counter Italian forces entering the war the squadron moved north to Erkowit and flew its first combat mission of the Second World War against Asmara airfield in Eritrea on 11 June 1940. The Vincent equipped D Flight was split off to form No. 430 Flight in August 1940, that flight continuing in support of Orde Wingate&#x27;s Gideon Force. In December 1940, 14 Squadron, which had re-equipped with Bristol Blenheims, passed its old Wellesleys on to 47 Squadron, helping to restore the squadron&#x27;s strength (47 Squadron had already lost 36 Wellesleys to enemy action, accidents or mechanical failure). The squadron was further reinforced in April 1941, when it received Wellesleys from 223 Squadron when that squadron reequipped with Martin Marylands, with 47 Squadron becoming the only Wellesley-equipped unit operating over East Africa. 47 Squadron continued to bomb Italian forces in Eritrea until they surrendered in May 1941, and then flying operations in support of British and Commonwealth forces in Ethiopia, including dropping supplies to allied troops, until the final Italian surrender in Gondar in November 1941.

The squadron moved to Egypt using the now old Wellesleys in anti-submarine patrols in RAF Kasfareet, while in July 1942 it acquired a detachment of Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers from 42 Squadron. It flew its first anti-shipping strikes against enemy convoys supplying the Afrika Korps in Libya on 8 October 1942. It carried on operating Beauforts on anti-shipping as well as convoy escort duties until 1943. In June 1943 the Squadron, by now based in Tunisia, re-equipped with Bristol Beaufighters. Now better equipped at striking against enemy shipping, they carried out armed reconnaissance in different areas of the Mediterranean and Aegean sea looking for shipping to attack.

====India and the Far East (1944–1945)====

The squadron moved with the Beaufighters to India in March 1944, re-equipping with de Havilland Mosquitos in October that year. This was not a success as the Mosquito was almost immediately grounded owing to failures of the wooden structure due to the hot and humid Indian climate, and it re-acquired the Beaufighter in November. They were soon supporting operations in Burma in both day and night attacks with rockets. The squadron partly re-equipped with Mosquitos in February 1945, with both its Beaufighters and Mosquitos being heavily used to support General Slim&#x27;s 14th Army in its attack against Mandalay. It completely re-equipped with Mosquitos in April 1945, continuing operations against Japanese forces until the end of the war. After the war it moved to Java to operate against Indonesian nationalist forces but it was disbanded at Butterworth on 21 March 1946.
===Transport (1946–1967)===

On 1 September 1946 the squadron was re-formed at RAF Qastina in Palestine when 644 Squadron was renumbered. It was now a transport squadron using converted four-engined Handley Page Halifax bombers. It soon returned to the United Kingdom where it flew the Halifax from RAF Fairford in the Army support role. The Squadron moved to RAF Dishforth in September 1948, where it became the first RAF Squadron to receive the Handley Page Hastings four-engined transport. The conversion process was rushed as the aircraft were needed to support the Berlin Airlift, with the Squadron moving to Schleswigland, near Kiel in West Germany on 1 November 1948. The aircraft was mainly used to carry coal, carrying out 3,000 trips to Berlin and carrying 22,000 tons of supplies. When the blockade ended the Squadron returned to the United Kingdom, moving to RAF Topcliffe on 22 August 1949, operating in support of airborne forces, moving to RAF Abingdon in May 1953.

In May 1956 the squadron became the first to re-equip with the Blackburn Beverley heavy-lift transport, the large aircraft were used on Transport Command trooping and freight routes. The squadron also supported operations in Cyprus, Kuwait and East Africa and carried out mercy flights related to floods, droughts and natural disasters. The Beverley was withdrawn and the squadron disbanded on 31 October 1967.

===Hercules (1968–2023)===
====C-130K (1968–2013)====

The squadron was re-formed at RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, on 25 February 1968 to operate the Lockheed C-130K Hercules, moving to RAF Lyneham in September 1971.

During the Falklands War, the squadron airlifted supplies to Ascension Island and, later, air dropped men and supplies to ships of the British task force in the South Atlantic. To make the trip from Ascension to the Falklands, several Hercules were given additional fuel tanks and fitted with refuelling probes. No. 47 Squadron also prepared to fly elements of the Special Air Service to Argentina for the aborted Operation Mikado.

The Hercules C.1/C.3s were withdrawn from service on 28 October 2013.

====C-130J (1999–2023)====
No. 47 Squadron received its first Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules on 21 November 1999.

The squadron was subsequently heavily involved in Operation Telic in Iraq in the 2000s and then in Operation Ellamy in Libya in 2011. The squadron moved to RAF Brize Norton in 2011.

On 25 August 2017, Hercules C4 &quot;ZH873&quot;, operated by the squadron, was seriously damaged in flight operations during Operation Shader. In response to an issue of &quot;crew fatigue&quot; over this incident, the RAF approved an uplift of trained aircrews for the C-130J from 20 to 28.

In March 2020, the squadron was awarded the right to emblazon a new battle honour on its squadron standard, recognising its role in War in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014.

On 4 June 2023, No. 47 Squadron carried out the RAF&#x27;s last Hercules operational flight when Hercules C4 &quot;ZH871&quot; returned from RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, to RAF Brize Norton. On 8 June 2023, No. 47 Squadron held its disbandment parade at RAF Brize Norton, in a service led by the Princess Royal, ahead of its official stand down on 21 September 2023 due to the retirement of the Hercules. On 14 June 2023 No.47 Squadron led a three aircraft flypast round all four nations of the United Kingdom,taking in many sites linked to the history of the Hercules and 47 Squadron. On 23 June 2023, at a farewell party for the Hercules at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, 47 Squadron&#x27;s band performed in front of a Hercules rear cargo ramp, joined by vocalist Bruce Dickinson for songs by Dickinson&#x27;s band Iron Maiden.

The squadron disbanded on 21 September 2023, after the squadron standard was laid up at RAF Cranwell on 31 July 2023.

<doc id="1077771" wikidata="Q5736213" url="?curid=1077771" title="Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr">
<text>Herbrand Edward Dundonald Brassey Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr, (20 June 1900 – 28 January 1976), styled Lord Buckhurst until 1915 (and sometimes nicknamed &quot;Buck De La Warr&quot; after that), was a British politician. He was the first hereditary peer to join the Labour Party and became a government minister at the age of 23.

He was later one of the few Labour politicians to follow Ramsay MacDonald in the formation of the National Government and the National Labour Organisation. However, he ended his political career by serving as Postmaster General in the last Conservative administration of Winston Churchill.

==Background and education==
De La Warr was the son of Gilbert Sackville, 8th Earl De La Warr, and Muriel Agnes, daughter of Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey, eldest son of the railway engineer Thomas Brassey. He was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford. The son of a Conservative father and Liberal mother, he developed trends towards socialism at university. In 1915 his father was killed in the First World War, and he succeeded to the title as a minor. On reaching 18, he refused as a conscientious objector to take part in active combat, but joined the Royal Naval Reserve (trawler section).

==Political career==
De La Warr became the first hereditary peer to join the Labour Party, and in February 1924, then aged 23, was one of the youngest ever ministers when he was appointed Lord in Waiting in the first Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald. He made his maiden speech in the House of Lords the same month.

In the second Labour government of 1929 to 1931 he served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (government chief whip in the House of Lords) and Under-Secretary of State for War between 1929 and 1930, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries between 1930 and 1931 and as a Lord-in-waiting between 1929 and 1931.

In 1931, the Labour government fell and MacDonald formed a National Government. De La Warr was one of only a tiny handful of Labour ministers to join it, and before the 1931 general election was instrumental in the formation of the National Labour Organisation to provide a vehicle of support for MacDonald and other ex-Labour members of the National Government. He resumed office as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, a post he held until 1935, and then served under Stanley Baldwin as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education between 1935 and 1936 and as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies between 1936 and 1937. In 1936, he was sworn of the Privy Council.

In 1937, new Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain gave De La Warr his first cabinet post as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. Like several other younger members of the cabinet, De La Warr found himself disagreeing over the government&#x27;s foreign policy, and contemplated resigning over the Munich Agreement, but decided not to. In the aftermath of the agreement he was transferred in 1938 to be President of the Board of Education. During his time in this post, it was expected that he would oversee legislation for raising of the school leaving age to 15, but the outbreak of World War II deferred all such plans until the end of hostilities.

In April 1940 De La Warr became First Commissioner of Works in a series of ministerial changes by Chamberlain, but was demoted from the cabinet. The following month Chamberlain was replaced by Winston Churchill, who formed an all-party coalition government, and the objections of the Labour Party to National Labour ministers meant that De La Warr was dropped, and he did not return to government for eleven years.

In 1951, in Churchill&#x27;s peacetime Conservative government, De La Warr was appointed Postmaster General, and as such, was in charge at the time of the Eastcastle Street robbery, before leaving office for the final time in 1955. He continued to contribute regularly to the House of Lords until 1966, but from then on until his death ten years later only spoke twice, both times in 1972.

Apart from his career in national politics, De La Warr was Mayor of Bexhill-on-Sea between 1932 and 1934 and a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for Sussex. In 1956 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. The De La Warr Pavilion was built in 1935 in Bexhill-on-Sea and was named after Lord De La Warr. The &quot;De La Warr&quot; in both the pavilion&#x27;s name and the Earl&#x27;s name is pronounced &quot;Delaware&quot; (as in the American state named for his ancestor Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr).

==Family==

Lord De La Warr was twice married. He married firstly Diana Helena, daughter of Henry Gerard Leigh, in 1920. They had two sons and a daughter. Their younger son Thomas Sackville (1922–1943) was killed in action during the Second World War.

After Diana&#x27;s death in March 1966, he married secondly Sylvia, Countess of Kilmuir, in 1968. She was the daughter of Edith and cotton broker William Reginald Harrison, widow of David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir, and the sister of actor Sir Rex Harrison.

One of his sisters was Lady Avice Ela Muriel Sackville (d. 1985). He attended her marriage to Stewart Menzies, (leader of British wartime intelligence or &#x27;C&#x27;), dressed in a lower-deck seaman&#x27;s bell-bottomed uniform.

==Death==
Lord De La Warr died in January 1976, aged 75, and was succeeded in the earldom by his elder and only surviving son, William. The Countess De La Warr died in June 1992.

<text>No. 70 or LXX Squadron RAF operates the Airbus A400M Atlas C.1, to provide strategic air transport worldwide. It is based at RAF Brize Norton.

==History==

===First World War===
The squadron was formed on 22 April 1916 at Farnborough, and was equipped with the Sopwith 1½ Strutter two seat fighter. The shortage of effective fighter aircraft on the Western Front resulted in the squadron being deployed to France piecemeal, with a first flight arriving at Fienvillers in Northern France on 22 April 1916, with the remaining two flights being deployed on 29 June and 30 July respectively. These were the first 1½ Strutters of the RFC, and the first aircraft of the RFC equipped with interrupter gear to arrive in France. In 1917 it re-equipped with Sopwith Camels.

During the First World War, the squadron claimed 287 victories, and had as members nineteen aces, including Frank Granger Quigley, John Todd, Frank Hobson, Oscar Heron, Frank Gorringe, Walter M. Carlaw, George Robert Howsam, Clive Franklyn Collett, Alfred Michael Koch, Kenneth Bowman Watson, Noel Webb, Edward Gribben, and Frederic Laurence.

===Inter-war years===
The squadron briefly disbanded in January 1920, reforming nine days later at Heliopolis, Egypt, by the renumbering of No. 58 Squadron. The squadron was now a bomber-transport unit operating the Vickers Vimy bomber. After transferring to RAF Hinaidi, Iraq in December 1921, the squadron was re-equipped with Vickers Vernons and subsequently by Vickers Victoria in 1926. In addition to providing heavy transport facilities to both air and ground units they were used as air ambulances and were responsible for maintaining the Cairo-Baghdad airmail route. The squadron was commanded by Group Captain Eric Murray DSO MC. In 1929, he flew the first route to the Cape on behalf of Imperial Airways who were seeking routes for the civil flights.

In December 1928, a coup against the Amir of Afghanistan by Habibullah Kalakani supported by Ghilzai peoples led to the first large scale air evacuation, the Kabul Airlift. Over two months Victoria troop-carriers of 70 squadron played central role in the airlift of 586 British and European officials and civilians flying over mountains at a height of up to often in severe weather.

The Vickers Valentia replaced the Victorias in November 1934. 70 squadron is recorded as being based at RAF Habbaniya from 1937–9 and in August 1939, it returned to Egypt.

===Second World War===
At the outbreak of war in September 1939, No. 70 squadron had just moved to RAF Helwan, in a suburb of Cairo, Egypt.
Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940, and on that date the squadron switched to RAF Heliopolis, still in Cairo, and still flying the obsolescent Valentia transport aircraft. On 1 September 1940 the role of the squadron changed when they started to receive modern equipment in the shape of six Vickers Wellington bombers. Later that month they undertook the first bombing mission, beginning operations with an attack on targets in the Dodecanese Islands (Greece).&lt;ref name=&quot;AIR 27/1319/1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 A detachment was sent to Tatoi Airport, just north of Athens, in support of Allied forces defending Greece and in 1941 the squadron was involved in the campaign to conquer Vichy-occupied Syria and the Rashid Ali rebellion in Iraq.

70 Squadron relocated frequently in support of the 8th Army&#x27;s westward advance, first into Libya then Tunisia. In November 1943 it relocated to Djedeida 20 miles west of Tunis, putting industrial targets in the North of Italy within easy reach. Between December 1943 and October 1945 the squadron relocated to Tortorella Airfield, Italy where the Wellingtons were replaced by the long range Liberators.

===Post Second World War===

The squadron disbanded in April 1947 and was reformed in May 1948, at RAF Kabrit, Egypt when No. 215 Squadron was renumbered No. 70 Squadron. The squadron was equipped with Douglas Dakotas until 1950, when it re-equipped with Vickers Valettas. In 1955, the squadron moved to RAF Nicosia, Cyprus and re-equipped with the Handley Page Hastings, Vickers Valetta and later used the Percival Pembroke twin engined communication aircraft. In 1966 the squadron moved to RAF Akrotiri. While there they won the Lord Trophy at RAF El Adem in competition with five other medium range transport squadrons. After a brief period operating Armstrong Whitworth Argosy C.1s, the squadron began conversion to the Lockheed C-130 Hercules in 1970, and moved to RAF Lyneham in 1975, after 55 years overseas. After 35 years of operating the Hercules C1/C3 from Lyneham, the squadron disbanded in September 2010.

The squadron reformed on 1 October 2014 and was officially &quot;stood up&quot; on 24 July 2015 by presentation with a new standard by Princess Anne becoming the Royal Air Force&#x27;s first frontline A400M squadron.

In 2017 the squadron was part of Op Ruman, the humanitarian aid relief after Hurricane Irma.

In August 2021, the squadron was deployed forward Al Minhad Air Base in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, sending two aircraft to assist with Operation Pitting. This was the largest Royal Air Force airlift since the Berlin Airlift, helping to evacuate British Nationals and vulnerable Afghanis from Kabul Airport.

<text>Maurice Vincent Buckley, (13 April 1891 – 27 January 1921) was an Australian soldier serving under the pseudonym Gerald Sexton who was awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War. This is the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Buckley was born at Upper Hawthorn, Melbourne, to Timothy Buckley, brickmaker, and his wife Agnes, née Sexton. His father was a native of Cork, Ireland; his mother was Victorian-born. Maurice Buckley was educated at the Christian Brothers&#x27; School in Abbotsford. He joined the 13th Light Horse Regiment on 18 December 1914 shortly after the outbreak of the First World War at Warrnambool, Victoria. In July 1915, he arrived in Egypt with reinforcements for his regiment, but in Cairo contracted the venereal disease chancroid. The following month he was sent back to Australia with 274 other VD-infected men on the Australian troopship HMAT A18 Wiltshire, and in late September 1915 was admitted to an Australian army medical isolation-detention barracks at Langwarrin, near Melbourne, that had been established earlier in 1915 to receive and treat VD-infected soldiers from Egypt. In January 1916 he escaped from Langwarrin, and was declared a deserter on 20 March.

On 6 May 1916 he enlisted again, this time in Sydney, using the name &#x27;Gerald Sexton&#x27; – comprising his recently deceased younger brother&#x27;s first name and his mother&#x27;s maiden surname. He was sent to France in early 1917, where he fought on the Western Front. Following the award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal he was promoted to sergeant in August 1918 and involved in the advance on the Hindenburg Line.

He was awarded the Victoria Cross in the name &#x27;Gerald Sexton&#x27; for his actions on 18 September 1918, at Le Verguier near Saint-Quentin. His unit was advancing under cover of a creeping barrage but was held up by German machine gun posts. Buckley attacked them with his Lewis gun section and captured 30 German prisoners of war. When the advance was again held up by machine-gun fire, Sergeant Buckley, supported by another platoon, put the enemy guns out of action. Later, he again showed conspicuous initiative in capturing hostile posts and machine-guns. According to the citation, he was &quot;to the fore dealing with enemy machine-guns, rushing enemy posts, and performing great feats of bravery and endurance without faltering or for a moment taking cover&quot;.

The award of the VC was originally gazetted under the name &#x27;Gerald Sexton&#x27;, but he had disclosed his real identity by the time that it was presented to him by King George V at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 29 May 1919. and was discharged in December 1919.

==Death==
He was severely injured in a riding accident at Boolarra, Gippsland on 15 January 1921, and died on 27 January, aged 29. Ten Victoria Cross recipients were pallbearers at his funeral. He is buried at Brighton Cemetery in Melbourne. He was unmarried.

==Medals==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, Australia. Medals: Victoria Cross, Distinguished Conduct Medal, 1914–15 Star, British War Medal, Victory Medal

<text>Tinker or tinkerer is an archaic term for an tinsmith who mends household utensils.

==Description==
&quot;Tinker&quot; for metal-worker is attested from the thirteenth century as &quot;tyckner&quot; or &quot;tinkler&quot;. Some travelling groups and Romani people specialised in the trade, and the name was particularly associated with indigenous Irish Travellers and Scottish Highland Travellers – the name of whose language &quot;Beurla Reagaird&quot; means &quot;metalworkers&quot;. However, this use is considered offensive.

The term &quot;tinker&quot;, in British English, may refer to a mischievous child.

==&quot;Tinker&#x27;s dam&quot; or &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;tinker&#x27;s curse&quot;==
Both phrases and tinker&#x27;s curse can be applied to something considered insignificant. An example: &quot;I don&#x27;t give a tinker&#x27;s curse what the doctor thinks&quot;, sometimes shortened to, &quot;I don&#x27;t give a tinker&#x27;s about the doctor.&quot;

A tinker&#x27;s dam is also reportedly a temporary patch to retain solder when repairing a hole in a metal vessel, such as a pot or a pan. It was used by tinkers and was usually made of mud or clay, or sometimes other materials at hand, such as wet paper or dough. The material was built up around the outside of the hole, so as to plug it. Molten solder was then poured on the inside of the hole. The solder cooled and solidified against the dam and bonded with the metal wall. The dam was then brushed away. The remaining solder was then rasped and smoothed down by the tinker.

In the &quot;Practical Dictionary of Mechanics&quot; of 1877, Edward Knight gives this definition: &quot;Tinker&#x27;s-dam: a wall of dough raised around a place which a plumber desires to flood with a coat of solder. The material can be but once used; being consequently thrown away as worthless&quot;.

It is thought that the use of &quot;tinker&#x27;s dam&quot; as something worthless may have evolved into the phrase &quot;tinker&#x27;s curse&quot;. Although &quot;tinker&#x27;s curse&quot; is attested in 1824, which was thought to be earlier than &quot;tinker&#x27;s dam&quot;, &quot;tinkers damn&quot; is attested in 1823. An alternative derivation is that a tinker&#x27;s curse or cuss was considered of little significance, possibly because tinkers (who worked with their hands near hot metal) were reputed to swear (curse) habitually.

When working with copper, tin, gold, or other low-melting-point metals, the tinker would construct a charcoal furnace out of bricks and mud. At the bottom, he would leave a hole for the molten metal to pour out into a trough that led to a casting or a depression for an ingot. The hole was covered with a temporary &quot;dam&quot; which would be broken when the liquid metal had puddled at the bottom of the furnace. The function of the blockage coined the term &quot;tinker&#x27;s dam&quot; as being something that only lasted temporarily, as it was to be destroyed or made useless in the very near future.

<text>Shawn Travis Kemp Sr. (born November 26, 1969) is an American former professional basketball player who played for the Seattle SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers, Portland Trail Blazers, and Orlando Magic in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed &quot;Reign Man&quot;, he was a six-time NBA All-Star and a three-time All-NBA Second Team member. Kemp is widely regarded as one of the best Slam Dunkers of all time and made the 1996 NBA Finals with the Supersonics.

Kemp was a member of the United States national team at the 1994 FIBA World Championship where he won gold and was named to the All-Tournament team. He was part of a famous Pick And Roll duo with All-Star Teammate Gary Payton and is often associated with Payton.

==Early years==
Kemp attended Concord High School in Elkhart, Indiana. At the prestigious B/C All-Star Camp on his first day, Kemp outplayed highly regarded prep star Terry Mills. A four-year varsity starter, he was considered to be one of the top four or five players nationally his senior year, and led his team to the state championship finals. Kemp ended his high school career as Elkhart County&#x27;s all-time leading scorer and the owner of Concord&#x27;s career, single-game and single-season scoring records. Despite his achievements and accolades, Kemp was bypassed for the title of Indiana Mr. Basketball as Woody Austin won the award that year instead. (Kemp, however, was Gatorade&#x27;s choice for state player of the year.) There has been some speculation that Kemp was purposely passed over for the award because he verbally committed to the University of Kentucky and did not express interest in staying in-state to play college basketball (Austin committed to Purdue University.) Kemp was selected to the 1988 McDonald&#x27;s High School All-American team (considered one of the best classes of all-time), along with such notable players as Alonzo Mourning, Billy Owens, Anthony Peeler, and Malik Sealy. Kemp scored a team-high 18 points for the West in a losing cause. The final score was 105–99 in favor of the East.

During his senior year, Kemp signed a national letter-of-intent to play basketball at the University of Kentucky. However, Kemp failed to score the minimum of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT, and was forced to miss his freshman year under the NCAA&#x27;s Proposition 48 rules. Jim Hahn, Kemp&#x27;s high school coach, did not like the idea of Kemp being in Kentucky without playing basketball, saying &quot;To have Shawn in a college environment without basketball, the one thing he loves, was, I felt, a big mistake. It even crossed my mind to advise him to go right into the NBA and the only thing that stopped me was the fact that so few players have done it.&quot; Kemp decided to enroll at Kentucky. However, he left the team in November 1988 after he was accused of pawning two gold chains that had been reported stolen from his teammate Sean Sutton, the son of then Kentucky head coach Eddie Sutton. Sean Sutton did not press charges but Kemp transferred to Trinity Valley Community College in Texas. After a semester at TVCC, where he did not play, 19-year-old Kemp declared himself eligible for the 1989 NBA draft.

==Professional career==

===Seattle SuperSonics (1989–1997)===
The Seattle SuperSonics drafted Kemp in the first round of the 1989 NBA draft. Although extremely athletic, Kemp was the youngest player in the NBA at that time and struggled to find his place. In his first season in Seattle, Kemp was mentored heavily by teammate Xavier McDaniel. As the season progressed, so did Kemp&#x27;s skills, which propelled him into stardom. Kemp began to find his place in the NBA as a star during his second season with the SuperSonics. Together with Gary Payton, Eddie Johnson, Ricky Pierce and Nate McMillan, they became a highly successful squad.

After Kemp&#x27;s second NBA season, he picked up the nickname &quot;Reign Man&quot; after the SuperSonics&#x27; announcer Kevin Calabro saw a poster with the name and thought it fitting to add to his radio broadcasts.

In 1992 during a playoff game against the Golden State Warriors, Kemp dunked over center Alton Lister, which colloquially became known as &quot;The Lister Blister&quot;.

In 1994, Kemp appeared in the MTV Rock N&#x27; Jock annual celebrity basketball game.

Kemp&#x27;s career peaked in 1995–96, when he and Payton led the SuperSonics to a franchise-record 64 wins and their first NBA Finals appearance since 1979. They faced Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, who were coming off an NBA record 72 wins. The SuperSonics pushed the heavily favored Bulls to six games before losing. In the Finals, Kemp posted per game averages of 23.3 points on 55% shooting from the field, 10.0 rebounds and two blocks. Shawn Kemp finished a close second in Finals MVP voting, almost becoming the second player to win the award despite being from the losing team.

During his time in Seattle, Kemp occasionally played during the offseason on an outdoor court in Seattle&#x27;s Belltown district.

Kemp signed a contract extension with the SuperSonics in 1994. The league&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement (CBA) precluded any adjustment to that contract until October 1997. He was upset by the situation, but his agent, Tony Dutte, understood that no negotiation was permitted. During this time, the SuperSonics signed Jim McIlvaine to a seven-year, $33.6 million contract, exceeding Kemp&#x27;s salary. Kemp threatened to refuse to play in the upcoming 1996–97 season and held out of training camp for 22 days. Despite this absence, Kemp helped lead the SuperSonics to another 50-plus-win season as they dispatched the Phoenix Suns in five games in the first round, only to lose to the Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler and Charles Barkley-led Houston Rockets in a seven-game series in the second round of the NBA Playoffs. Following the 1996–1997 season, Kemp was part of a trade sending him to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Milwaukee Bucks forward Vin Baker to the SuperSonics, and Terrell Brandon and Tyrone Hill from the Cavaliers to the Bucks.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (1997–2000)===
Kemp played three seasons with the Cavaliers where he posted career-high numbers for points per game in 1997–98 and led the Cavaliers to the NBA Playoffs, where they faced the Reggie Miller-led Indiana Pacers. The Cavaliers lost to the Pacers in four games despite Kemp averaging 26 points with 13 rebounds per game in the series.

During the lockout shortened 1998–1999 NBA season, Kemp reportedly showed up to training camp weighing 280 pounds, though Cleveland&#x27;s then general manager Wayne Embry revealed that he was actually 315 pounds.

===Portland Trail Blazers (2000–2002)===
Kemp was then traded to the Portland Trail Blazers after the 1999–2000 season, in a three-team trade involving the Miami Heat; the Cavaliers received Clarence Weatherspoon, Chris Gatling, Gary Grant and draft considerations, while the Heat received Brian Grant. The trade reunited Kemp with Bob Whitsitt, who had originally brought Kemp to Seattle. However, Kemp&#x27;s play began to decline significantly. After two seasons with the Blazers, Kemp was waived prior to the 2002–03 season.

===Orlando Magic (2002–2003)===
Kemp was signed as a free agent by the Magic, and helped the Magic reach the playoffs despite the loss of starting small forward Grant Hill. During his one season in Orlando, Kemp played in his 1000th NBA game. In their first round series, the Magic took an early three games to one lead before losing to the Detroit Pistons in seven games. Following the 2002–03 season, Kemp was replaced by free agent forward Juwan Howard.

===Comeback attempts and retirement===
In April of the 2005–06 NBA season, Kemp&#x27;s NBA comeback chances looked promising. The eventual Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks considered adding Kemp to their roster in time for the NBA playoffs. Mavs&#x27; coach, and former Sonic teammate, Avery Johnson scheduled a personal workout to take place in Houston, where Kemp trained for several months. Kemp failed to appear because of undisclosed reasons. The two parties tried to reschedule a workout but the NBA refused to grant Dallas an injury exception (for a 16th player). Kemp did not get a second chance to join the Mavericks that season.

In June 2006, three months after a drug arrest, the &quot;Denver Post&quot; reported that Kemp had slimmed down to the playing weight of his All-Star days and was determined to join an NBA team, possibly the Denver Nuggets, and finish his career &quot;the right way.&quot; The Nuggets ultimately turned their attention away from Kemp, signing power forward Reggie Evans. Kemp drew some interest from the Chicago Bulls in September 2006, but missed his scheduled workout.

During the half time of the SuperSonics&#x27; game on November 5, 2006, Kemp was announced as one of the 16 members of the SuperSonics&#x27; 40-year anniversary team. After having the longest ovation of all the players, Kemp said after the celebration that he would play with a team in Rome and was still considering a comeback to the NBA. Kemp, however, did not secure a position on an NBA roster during the 2006–07 season.

On August 18, 2008, Kemp signed a one-year contract with Premiata Montegranaro of Italian League. Despite being almost 39, he was said to be in good shape. The Premiata deal came about due to the good relationship between Kemp and Roberto Carmenati, the new Team Director of Montegranaro. Kemp reported to the team, played in three preseason games, then returned to Houston to assess his home for damage from Hurricane Ike. Kemp and Premiata Montegranaro decided to part ways, and the contract was rescinded.

After his active career he tried to bring basketball back to Seattle. Kemp bought a mansion in Seattle in 2003 for $2.4 million, the year he retired from the NBA. In 2008, he listed the property for $3.7 million.

==National team career==
Kemp played for the US national team in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in Toronto, where he won the gold medal and was named to the All-Tournament team along with teammates Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Reggie Miller. For the tournament, he averaged 9.4 points on a 68.9% shooting along with 6.8 rebounds, including 14 points and 9 rebounds in the championship clinching game against Russia.

==Personal life==
Kemp has fathered at least seven children with six different women. His oldest son, Shawn Kemp Jr., played basketball for the University of Washington and another son, Jamon, played basketball at Southeastern Louisiana University.

Kemp appeared on the 2009 season premiere of &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;. A photograph of Kemp dunking over Hakeem Olajuwon appears on the cover of &quot;NBA Jam Extreme&quot;.

Kemp was the owner of a sports bar in Lower Queen Anne, Seattle named Oskar&#x27;s Kitchen. The establishment closed in 2015. Kemp now owns a part of Amber&#x27;s Kitchen on 1st Avenue in Seattle as well as a controlling interest in several Seattle venues.

In October 2020, Kemp was part of a group that opened a cannabis dispensary in Seattle named Shawn Kemp&#x27;s Cannabis. He was joined at the grand opening by former teammate Gary Payton, whose Cookies brand cannabis strain he sells at the shop.

===Legal problems===
On April 4, 2005, Kemp was arrested in Shoreline, Washington, for an investigation of drug possession. Kemp and another man were found with a small amount of cocaine, about 60 grams of marijuana and a semiautomatic pistol, according to the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. On April 29, Kemp was formally charged with drug possession and pleaded guilty. Kemp was again arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession in Houston, Texas, on July 21, 2006.

On March 8, 2023, Kemp was arrested in Tacoma, Washington, in connection with an alleged drive-by shooting. Originally released without being charged, the following month Kemp was charged with first degree assault. Kemp pleaded not guilty to the first degree assault charge during a May 4 arraignment hearing in Pierce County Superior Court in Washington state. Following the hearing, he was released without bail.

===Acting ===
Kemp had a cameo in &quot;Aqua Teen Forever: Plantasm&quot;.

<text>The Gypsy Cob, also known as the Traditional Gypsy Cob, Irish Cob, Romani Cob, Gypsy Horse, or Gypsy Vanner, is a breed of domestic horse from the British Isles. It is a small, solidly-built horse of cob conformation and is usually piebald. It is associated with Irish Travellers and English Romanichal Travellers. There was no stud-book or breed registry for these horses until 1996, but as breeders developed standards and recorded pedigrees, there are now organizations that register qualifying horses..

From about 1850, travelling people in the British Isles began to use this horse to pull their caravans called vardos. The color and look of the breed were refined in the years after the Second World War. Horses of this type were first exported to the United States in 1996.

== Characteristics ==

The Gypsy horse is usually, but not always, piebald. It may also be skewbald or any solid colour; a solid-coloured horse with white splashing on the underbelly is called &quot;blagdon&quot; or &quot;splashed&quot;. There is no coat colour requirement in the breed standard of the Irish Cob Society, Gypsy Cob Register, Gypsy Vanner Horse Society, Gypsy Horse Registry of America, or Australasian Gypsy Horse Society. Since the horse originates in the British Isles, British colour names may be used in registration in the United States. 

There are many breed societies for the Gypsy horse, with variations in their respective breed standards. The range of desired heights is generally from in the United States and Australasia, but in Ireland and continental Europe, the desired height limit goes up to for some types and they permit both lighter-boned as well as larger horses than typically desired by the American organisations. Some stud-books have different categories: The Gypsy Horse Registry of America has two height classifications: Section A for purebred horses under and Section B for purebred horses and over. Its Section C is for Gypsy Crossbred horses. The Netherlands stud-book for Gypsy horses, the Nederlands Stamboek voor Tinkers, identified there as the &quot;Tinker horse,&quot; classifies horses into three groups: &quot;cob,&quot; &quot;vanner,&quot; and &quot;grai,&quot; based on height in metres and degree of refinement. The cob type is approximately , and the vanner . The more refined &quot;grai&quot; may be of any size but is typically within the 14.3- to 16.2-hand range.

Feathering, long hair on the legs, is considered a &quot;characteristic and decorative feature of the Irish Cob&quot;, but is not a requirement for registration.

A Gypsy Horse&#x27;s facial profile should be straight, neither overly dished nor roman nosed. A &quot;sweet&quot; head, more refined than that of most draught horses, is desired. The GHA&#x27;s breed standard states that the head &quot;may&quot; be &quot;sweet&quot;, &quot;a small, tidy pony type head&quot;, meaning without coarseness and in proportion with the body, but the AGHS calls unequivocally for a sweet head, &quot;more refined than a Shire might have ... with broad forehead, generous jaw, square muzzle, and even bite&quot;. According to GVHS, the &quot;forehead must be flat and broad ... with [t]he frontal facial bone ... flat to slightly convex&quot;.

The neck is strong, muscular, and of medium length &quot;with a throat latch slightly deeper than lighter breeds&quot;. The chest should be broad, deep, and well muscled. Withers are &quot;well rounded, not high and fine, i.e., hardly noticeable&quot;. Most standards call for a &quot;well-sloped&quot; shoulder. But the GVHS&#x27;s standard is more precise, specifying a shoulder angle ranging from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. The back is to be short coupled with well sprung ribs and a deep heart girth. The length of line of the belly should be twice that of the topline of the back and the horse should not appear &quot;wasp waisted&quot;. The Dutch breed standard for vanner and cob types requires a strong, well-muscled build with abundant feathering, similar to that of other associations. The &quot;grai&quot; is classified as a lighter and more refined riding type.

Strong hindquarters define the breed as a small draught horse, &quot;designed for strength and power, but with class, presence and style.&quot; They are sometimes described as having an &quot;apple butt&quot; as the croup is well rounded and &quot;very generous, smooth and broad&quot;. Poorly-muscled hindquarters or a too-sloping rump are unacceptable. The line measuring the length of the hip should also be horizontal; if the tailhead falls below the horizontal line intersecting the point of the hip, the horse&#x27;s &quot;hip/croup will be approaching too steep an angle for the Gypsy Vanner&quot;.

Bone in the legs should be heavy, clean, and flat. GVHS&#x27;s standard calls for a length of forearm to cannon ratio of 55% to 45%. The front legs should be clean and flat in joints as well as bone; front pasterns should slope at the same angle as the shoulder and should not be short. A line drawn from the point of the buttock should touch the back of the hock, run &quot;parallel&quot; to the cannon bone, and touch the ground directly behind &quot;the center of the heel&quot;. Pastern and hoof angles of the hindlegs are more vertical than the forelegs, usually over 50 degrees. Hooves have strong walls and a well shaped frog, round and with wide heels.

The hind legs of the Gypsy Horse should display proper angulation for a pulling horse, although not to the degree found in larger feathered draught breeds such as the modern Shire and Clydesdale. Unlike the equine conformational flaw of cow-hockedness, where only the lower leg is turned outward, a Gypsy Horse&#x27;s entire hind leg is set so as to angle outward. As a result, when the hind legs of a horse set up squarely are viewed from the rear, their cannon bones appear parallel.

The Gypsy horse has distinct gaits. According to GHA&#x27;s standard, &quot;The stride should be correct, supple, and powerful. Showing good impulsion from behind, demonstrating powerful drive. Flowing, effortless in appearance&quot;. The horse&#x27;s movement should be &quot;natural, not artificial ... Some have higher knee action than others, it&#x27;s[sic] way of going can vary from short and economical to longer, reaching strides.&quot; GHRA&#x27;s standard requires &quot;[a] steady forward walk with impulsion. Ground covering trot with a slight flick of feather at the point of extension.&quot;

The Gypsy horse should be a &quot;strong, kind, (very) intelligent partner that works willingly and harmoniously with its handler. They are also described as mannerly and manageable, eager to please, confident, courageous, alert, and loyal with a genuine sociable outlook. The Gypsy Horse is renowned for its gentle, tractable nature and sensible disposition.&quot;

The Gypsy Horse is prone to diseases common to feathered draught horses. The most serious of these is chronic progressive lymphedema. This condition may have a genetic component, as is a similar condition in humans. However, studies to date have not identified a causative gene. Of less concern is pastern dermatitis (&quot;greasy heels&quot;). The moist environment under the feathering is an ideal environment for the combination of fungus and mites which are believed to cause it.

== History==

The Gypsy Horse was bred by the Romanichal Travellers of Great Britain to pull the Vardoes in which they lived and travelled. Romanichal Travellers had arrived in the British Isles by 1500 AD, but they did not begin to live in vardoes until the middle of the 1800s. Prior to that, they travelled in tilted carts or afoot and slept either under or in these carts or in small tents. The peak usage of the horse-drawn Gypsy caravan occurred in the latter part of the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th. The advent of the gasoline powered engine and the loss of horses to World War I worked together to bring the horse-drawn era to a close.

Some aspects of training, management, and characteristics of a horse used to pull a Vardo are unique. For example, the horse is trained not to stop until it reaches the top of a hill; otherwise it may not be able to get started again. Training begins at a very early age with the young horse tied &quot;with a short rope from the head to the trace-ring on the collar of the shaft-horse&quot;, and led along on the off side. An old hat is sometimes placed on a fearful horse&#x27;s head so as to keep him from seeing back over the top of his blinkers at the wagon looming at his back. A horse used to pull a vardo which was a permanent home was usually in very good condition due to a combination of exercise, grazing a variety of greens in the hedgerows, and good quality care; the horse was considered part of the family. Since the family&#x27;s children lived in close proximity to the horse, one having &quot;an unreliable temper could not be tolerated&quot;.

The Gypsy Horse was also used to pull the &quot;tradesman&#x27;s cart . . . used in conjunction with the caravan as a runabout and work vehicle and whilst on a journey&quot;.

The Gypsy Horse breed as it is today is thought to have begun to take shape shortly after the Second World War. When the British Roma had first begun to live in vardoes around 1850, they used mules and cast off horses of any suitable breed to pull them. These later included coloured horses which had become unfashionable in mainstream society and were typically culled. Among these were a significant number of coloured Shire horses. Many of these ended up with Romanichal breeders, and by the 1950s, they were considered valuable status symbols within that culture. Spotted horses were very briefly in fashion around the time of the Second World War, but quickly went out of fashion in favour of the coloured horse, which has retained its popularity until the present day. The initial greater height of the breed derived from the influence of both Clydesdales and Shires.

In the formative years of the Gypsy Horse, the Romanichal bred not only for specific colour, profuse feather, and greater bone, but also for increased action and smaller size. To increase action at the trot, they first tried Hackney Pony breeding, but this blood reduced both feather and bone. The Roma therefore turned to the Section D Welsh Cob to add a more animated trot to the breed without loss of other desired traits. Another trend in breeding was a steady decrease in height, a trend still present among many Romani breeders. In the 1990s, the breed&#x27;s average height still was in excess of , but horses of were beginning to be viewed as more desirable, primarily for economic reasons. John Shaw, a carriage painter from Milnrow, Rochdale, Lancaster, was quoted in 1993 as saying, &quot;Very big, hairy coloureds are now in vogue. They are status symbols . . . but they are not really an economical animal. They cost too much to feed, harness and shoe. . . and they don&#x27;t stand up to the work. For that you want the vanner type of &quot;; larger horses require more fodder than smaller ones, as well as larger harnesses and horseshoes.

The breed most used by the Romani breeders to set not only the size but also the type of the future Gypsy Horse was the Dales Pony, described as &quot;thick, strong, . . . active yet a great puller&quot;. The Dales, a draught pony, preserved the bone, feather, and pulling capabilities derived from the Shire and Clydesdale breeds but in a smaller and therefore more economical package. The Dales and, to a lesser extent, the Fell Pony interbred with the Shire and Clydesdale provided the basis of today&#x27;s Gypsy Horse.

Since the Romani people who developed the Gypsy Horse communicated pedigree and breed information orally, information on foundation bloodstock and significant horses within the breed is mostly anecdotal. The two foundation sires of the breed are reportedly known as The Old Coal Horse and Sonny Mays&#x27; Horse. It is said that The Coal Horse goes back to a grey Shire stallion known as Shaw&#x27;s Grey Horse of Scotland. The origins of the breed appear to be Irish, and the name Connors appears prominently in the breed history. In a poorly recorded interview, well-respected breeder Henry Connors gives some of the lineage of the horse. It includes horses with names such as Ben&#x27;s of Bonafay, Jimmy Doyle&#x27;s Horse of Ballymartin, Henry Connors&#x27; White Horse, The Lob Eared Horse, The Sham Horse, and Old Henry.

The Irish cob can be traced to the 18th century but also was long considered a type, not a breed, and varied somewhat in characteristics, though generally was bred for light draught and farm work but was also capable of being ridden. It originated from crossing Thoroughbred, Connemara pony, and Irish Draught horses.
The first known Gypsy Horses to come to America arrived in 1996, imported by Dennis and Cindy Thompson, who created the Gypsy Vanner name and started a breed society.

===Names===

The breed was often referred to simply as a &quot;Cob&quot;, although the term cob defines a short-legged, stout type of horse rather than a breed. Other names are used worldwide for the breed, such as Irish Cob, Gypsy Cob, Gypsy Vanner, and Tinker Cob, alluding to its association with the travelling community.

The first known importers of the Gypsy Horse to North America, Dennis and Cindy Thompson, viewed the breed as unnamed and chose the name &quot;vanner&quot;, calling their association the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society. A &quot;vanner&quot; is a light draught horse suitable for pulling a horse-drawn van. Before the formation of the American society in 1996, the word &quot;vanner&quot; appears in two printed sources in association with these horses. In 1979, Harvey described a Roma-owned horse as &quot;[a] fair-sized vanner, about 15.2hh (15 1/2 hands) high, . . . [c]ross-shire, with a touch of Clydesdale? Lineage is often hard to trace.&quot; Publishing in 1993 in the first known acknowledgment of the Gypsy Horse as a distinct breed outside Romani culture, Hart employs the term three times in reference to a Gypsy Horse, identifying specific Gypsy Horses as vanners.

Founded subsequently in 1998, 2002, and 2003, respectively, the Irish Cob Society, the Gypsy Cob and Drum Horse Association, and the Gypsy Cob Society of America referred to the breed as &quot;Cob&quot;, the name used by its Romani breeders. The Gypsy Horse Association, incorporated in 2008, employed the name &quot;Gypsy Horse&quot; and states on its website that the organisation recognizes all breed names currently in use. Also in 2008, the GCSA renamed itself the Gypsy Horse Registry of America.

Breed associations in Belgium, Sweden, and the Netherlands are listed in the database under the breed names &quot;Tinker Horse&quot; and &quot;Tinker Pony.&quot;

== Registration ==
Among the assorted associations and societies dedicated to the breed, there is some variety in services offered. The Gypsy Horse Registry of America includes size classifications in its stud book. The Gypsy Horse Association provides access to the identifying DNA markers, pedigrees (both anecdotal and DNA verified), and registration photos of most of its registered horses online and free of charge. The Gypsy Horse Association and the Gypsy Horse Registry of America provide online stud-books. The Gypsy Vanner Horse Society provides access to its stud-book for a fee. The GVHS also has inspections for registered horses and provides awards for year end points from approved shows. The Gypsy Cob and Drum Horse Association offers inspections and some shows.

Since registration for the Gypsy Horse has only existed within the last 20 years, most associations require a genetic analysis for registration, to verify identity and identify future offspring. All of the North American Gypsy Horse and Drum Horse societies employ the Animal Genetics Research Laboratory of the University of Kentucky to perform DNA analysis and maintain a database of registered horses&#x27; DNA markers. UKY currently tests markers at 17 loci of a horse&#x27;s genetic makeup. The aim of this analysis is to either exclude or fail to exclude another horse as a parent. In a spirit of co-operation, the five American breed societies have jointly granted the University of Kentucky permission to employ their registered horses&#x27; DNA markers in confirming parentage of horses belonging to other registries. Since information regarding the past histories, including parentage, of many of the Gypsy Horses imported to North America was lost, many owners seek to reclaim the genetic roots of their animals, and services have sprung up to satisfy this desire.

Because many of the horses submitted for registration have never been registered, the American organisations evaluate horses for registration by way of photos and provenance information such as import papers and bills of sale.

Beginning in 2014, GVHS began restricting registration to horses sired by GVHS-registered stallions and out of mares whose DNA markers are available and confirm parentage. Only horses falling between in height are eligible for registration, although the status of animals whose heights fall outside that range can be appealed to GVHS&#x27;s board of directors.

The Netherlands stud book only allows full registration to offspring of horses previously registered with the NSvT; horses identified as Irish Cob, Gypsy Cob, Gypsy Vanner, Coloured Horse, Traveller Pony, Black and White, or Traditional Cob may be evaluated as potential breeding stock and, if suitable, recorded in a secondary register, with their offspring eligible for full registration. Horses must pass an inspection to be registered. The Irish Cob Society also requires an inspection process. The Gypsy Cob Register of the UK &amp; Ireland, a registry run by the Travelling Community, has a DNA database and requires breeding stallions to have a DNA profile.

== Uses ==

Gypsy Cobs are shown and traded at traditional horse fairs, of which the Appleby Horse Fair is the largest in Europe. Many Travellers and Romani travel to the fair in traditional horse-drawn caravans and vardos. American photographer John S. Hockensmith documented such a journey in 2004, travelling with and photographing the Harker family&#x27;s journey to Appleby in bow-top living wagons.

In North America, the first known show classes dedicated to the Gypsy Horse were held at the Colorado Horse Park on 28–29 August 2004, employing the breed standard of the Gypsy Cob Society of America, now the Gypsy Horse Registry of America. The first Gypsy breed show, the Ohio State Fair Gypsy Vanner Horse Show, sponsored by the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society, was held in 2005 in Columbus, Ohio. Currently there are a number of breed shows for the Gypsy Horse in the US and Canada.

In the United States, the Gypsy Horse is used in many equestrian sports, by amateurs and youths. In 2004, the United States Dressage Federation accepted the Gypsy Vanner Horse Society as an affiliate member, allowing horses registered with GVHS to compete in its dressage and dressage-related events. The Gypsy Horse Association was accepted into the USDF programme in 2008; two other coloured horse associations had joined by 2011.

<text>Marie Bountrogianni (born December 10, 1956) is the former dean of The G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education at Ryerson University. She is also the former chief psychologist of the Hamilton Board of Education, the former president and executive director of ROM (Royal Ontario Museum) Governors, and former member of Provincial Parliament. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and a cabinet minister in the government of Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Bountrogianni was born in Hamilton, Ontario, the daughter of Greek immigrants. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Waterloo in 1979, a Master of Education degree from the University of Toronto in 1980, and a Doctor of Education degree from the latter institution in 1983.

She became a registered psychologist in 1985, and was employed in psychological work at the Toronto Board of Education from 1984 to 1988. From 1989 to 1999, she was Chief Psychologist of the Hamilton Board of Education. Bountrogianni also served as an assistant professor at Wilfrid Laurier University from 1985 to 1987, and McMaster University from 1992 to 1999, and was the vice-chair of St. Peter&#x27;s Hospital in Hamilton from 1995 to 1999. In 1997, she was hired by the European Union to evaluate proposals for graduate school funding. Locally, she has also served as an honorary co-chair of &quot;Hamilton &amp; Bay AIDSwalk&quot; and &quot;Grace Haven Capital Campaign&quot;. She was a director at Northland Power Inc. and chair of its Governance Committee until May 2022. Bountrogianni also sits on the board of the Democracy Study Center in Kyiv, Ukraine and on the advisory council of Eurobank’s incubator, the egg, in Athens, Greece.

==Politics==

===Provincial===
Bountrogianni ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, as a Liberal candidate in the riding of Hamilton Mountain. She finished ahead of incumbent New Democrat Brian Charlton, but 1028 votes behind the winner, Progressive Conservative Trevor Pettit.

Bountrogianni ran against Pettit again in the 1999 provincial election. There was some uncertainty in the riding as to whether Bountrogianni or NDP candidate Chris Charlton (wife of Brian) would have a better chance of defeating Pettit. Charlton received some union support but the teachers and the building trades backed Bountrogianni. As it happened, Bountrogianni was able to defeat Pettit by over 2500 votes, with Charlton finishing third. The Progressive Conservatives won the election, and Bountrogianni became the opposition critic for Colleges and Universities as well as Women&#x27;s Issues. In 2002, she was named Woman of the Year in Politics by the &quot;Hamilton Status of Women Committee&quot;.

Bountrogianni was re-elected in the 2003 election, in which the Liberals won a majority. On October 23, 2003, she was named Minister of Children&#x27;s Services and Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.

In October 2004, Bountrogianni introduced and stewarded the passage of the AODA, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act After a cabinet shuffle on June 29, 2005, Bountrogianni was named Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal.

She decided not to run for re-election in 2007, and was succeeded by another Liberal, Sophia Aggelonitis.

====Cabinet positions====

===Federal attempt===
In 2011, she ran as the Liberal candidate in the 2011 federal election, finishing third behind Terry Anderson and the winner, New Democrat incumbent Chris Charlton.

===Federal electoral record===




==After politics==
In 2007, she became president of the Royal Ontario Museum but stepped down in February 2011 (to run for federal parliament). From 2007 to 2012, she served on the Child and Youth Committee for the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC). In 2012, she was a professor at Ryerson’s G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education, where she performed research and taught political psychology courses. On July 1, 2013, she was appointed the interim dean of the Chang School of Continuing Education. On April 23, 2014, she was named Dean of the Chang School of Continuing Education. She served as Dean until May 2019. She was appointed as chair of the board of Help Us Help in 2020, a foundation supporting orphans and vets in Ukraine.

<doc id="1077806" wikidata="Q85814119" url="?curid=1077806" title="Wag the dog">
<text>Wag the dog is a political term for the act of creating a diversion from a damaging issue usually through military force. It stems from the generic use of the term to mean a small and seemingly unimportant entity (the tail) controls a bigger, more important one (the dog). It is usually used by a politician when they are in a scandal, in hopes that people forget about the scandal and focus on the more important issue. The phrase originates in the saying &quot;a dog is smarter than its tail, but if the tail were smarter, then it would wag the dog.&quot; The concept has strong intersections with many other aspects of diversionary foreign policy, particularly the rally &#x27;round the flag effect, as wag the dog actions tend to both distract and seek to bolster support through these actions.

==First usage==

The earliest usage of the phrase in politics found in print is in an article originating in 1871, discussing one Democratic convention. In the article, the author references the popular play &quot;Our American Cousin&quot;, which Abraham Lincoln was watching six years earlier when he was assassinated by actor John Wilkes Booth. In the play, Lord Dundreary is a sympathetic character who constantly utters confused catch phrases known at that time as Dundrearyisms (similar to modern day Yogi-isms of Yogi Berra):

The phrase was used again in the 1960s, as in the economic advice &quot;don&#x27;t let the tax tail wag the investment dog&quot;.

== In fiction ==
While it was first used in 1871, the term did not gain political popularity until the 1990s, with the success of the 1993 novel &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;. In it, a plan is hatched to secure President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s reelection by having Hollywood produce a fake war to improve his popular approval.

In 1997, a film of the same name came out based on that novel. In the film, a sitting US president becomes embroiled in scandal weeks before he is up for re-election, and a spin doctor comes up with the scheme of hiring a Hollywood producer to fabricate military action to save his campaign.

== Real world usage ==
During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, President Clinton ordered missile strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan shortly after the story broke, drawing comparisons with the film and popularizing usage of the phrase. During impeachment proceedings, Clinton also bombed Iraq, drawing stronger &quot;wag the dog&quot; allusions. With the scandal still on the public&#x27;s mind in March 1999, his administration launched a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. These action drew more attention to the phrase, growing its popularity.

It has been used multiple times for former President Donald Trump. First, in April 2017 when he conducted airstrikes against Syria during an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, and again in January 2020, after a U.S. airstrike assassination of Iran&#x27;s General Qasem Soleimani occurred during first impeachment trials of former President Trump.

<text>Linda Pritzker (born September 1953) also known by the name Lama Tsomo is an American lama in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. She is a spiritual teacher, author, philanthropist, and co-founder of the Namchak Foundation and Namchak Retreat Ranch in Missoula, Montana. She is a member of the Pritzker family, known for the Hyatt Hotel fortune.

==Early life==
Pritzker was born in 1953 in Oberlin, Ohio, the second of three children born to Jewish-American businessman Robert Pritzker and Audrey Gilbert. She has two full siblings: Jennifer N. Pritzker (b. James, 1950), a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army and founder of the Pritzker Military Library, and Karen Pritzker (b. 1958).

Her parents divorced in 1979. In 1981, her mother remarried Albert B. Ratner, the co-chairman of Cleveland-based real estate developer Forest City Enterprises. In 1980, her father remarried to Irene Dryburgh with whom he had two children, her half siblings: Matthew Pritzker and Liesel Pritzker Simmons.

==Career==
After earning a master&#x27;s degree in Counseling Psychology and working as a psychotherapist for several years, Pritzker began a spiritual path to Tibetan Buddhism.

Pritzker was ordained a lama in February 2005 by Tulku Sangak Rinpoche, a Tibetan meditation master and world holder of the Namchak Lineage, a branch of the Nyingma path of Tibetan Buddhism. She began studying with Rinpoche in 1995 and became fluent in Tibetan. Her journey to Buddhist practices has been documented by ABC News&#x27; Dan Harris in his podcast 10% Happier.

She is the author of the Ancient Wisdom for our Times Tibetan Buddhist Practice Series, including Book 1 &quot;Why Bother: An Introduction&quot;, Book 2 &quot;Wisdom and Compassion (Starting with Yourself)&quot;, and Book 3 &quot;Deepening Wisdom, Deepening Connection&quot; (to be released on October 11, 2022) She also authored &quot;Why is the Dalai Lama Always Smiling? A Westerner&#x27;s Introduction and Guide to Tibetan Buddhist Practice&quot; and &quot;The Princess Who Wept Pearls: The Feminine Journey in Fairy Tales&quot; and is the co-author of &quot;The Lotus &amp; The Rose: A Conversation Between Tibetan Buddhism &amp; Mystical Christianity&quot; and a contributor to &quot;The Dharma of Dogs: Our Best Friends as Spiritual Teachers&quot; edited by Tami Simon. &quot;Why is the Dalai Lama Always Smiling?&quot; has a foreword written by the Dalai Lama and was a 2016 silver medal winner in the Independent Publisher Book Awards (IPPY Awards).

Today, Lama Tsomo&#x27;s work revolves around the initiatives of the Namchak Foundation. While the Namchak Retreat Ranch is still under construction, Namchak has several offerings for students looking to begin or strengthen their meditation practice including two online courses, guided meditations, Learning Circles, and several live events per year.

As of July 2018, her net worth was estimated to be $1.77 billion.

==Personal life==
Pritzker is divorced and has three children: Rachel, Roland, and Rosemary. She lives in Missoula, Montana. She is a Tibetan Buddhist.

<text>The Division of Banks is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

==History==

The division was created in 1949 and is named for Sir Joseph Banks, the British naturalist and botanist who accompanied James Cook on his voyage to Australia in 1770. It has always been based in the south-western and southern suburbs of Sydney, including the suburbs of Padstow, Panania, Peakhurst and Revesby.

Up until 2013, it was held since its creation by the Australian Labor Party, but has grown increasingly marginal from the 1990s onward. It was almost lost in 2004, but the 2006 redistribution added areas to the west in Bankstown and Condell Park which strengthened the seat for Labor. Those areas were lost in the 2009 redistribution, which pushed Banks into new areas to the east, around Hurstville. Long-term Labor member, Daryl Melham, was defeated at the 2013 federal election by current member David Coleman. Coleman became the first non-Labor member for the seat, breaking a 64-year tradition.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division includes the suburbs of Allawah, East Hills, Hurstville Grove, Lugarno, Mortdale, Oatley, Padstow, Padstow Heights, Panania, Peakhurst, Peakhurst Heights, Picnic Point, Revesby Heights, and South Hurstville; and parts of Bankstown, Bankstown Aerodrome, Beverly Hills, Blakehurst, Carlton, Condell Park, Connells Point, Hurstville, Milperra, Narwee, Penshurst, Revesby, and Riverwood.

<text>The Division of Barton is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

==History==

The division was created in 1922 and is named for Sir Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of Australia. For much of its history, Barton has been a marginal seat, held by the Australian Labor Party for most of the time after 1940, but won by the Liberals (or their predecessors) at &quot;high-tide&quot; elections.

Barton&#x27;s most prominent member has been Dr H. V. Evatt, who was Leader of the Labor Party between 1951 and 1960. After seeing his majority more than halved in 1949, and nearly being defeated in 1951 and 1955, he transferred to the safe seat of Hunter in 1958. A former minister in the Hawke and Keating ministries, Gary Punch, held the seat for Labor between 1983 and 1996. Robert McClelland, Attorney-General in the Rudd and Gillard governments, held the seat for Labor between 1996 and 2013.

Nickolas Varvaris won the seat for the Liberals at the 2013 federal election, achieving a swing of 7.2 percent to finish with a two-party-preferred vote of just 50.3 percent, which made Barton the Coalition government&#x27;s most marginal seat, but was defeated in 2016 by Labor’s former state deputy opposition leader Linda Burney, who has held the seat ever since.

The Division of Barton is linked to one of the more unusual episodes in Australian politics. The first member for Barton, Labor&#x27;s Frederick McDonald, disappeared after his 1925 defeat by Nationalist Thomas Ley, and it is now believed that Ley had him murdered. After being found guilty of an unrelated murder in England in 1947, Ley was declared insane and died in Broadmoor Asylum four months later.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division has always been based in the inner southern suburbs of Sydney, and currently includes the suburbs of Arncliffe, Banksia, Bardwell Park, Bardwell Valley, Bexley, Bexley North, Brighton-Le-Sands, Clemton Park, Earlwood, Kyeemagh, Rockdale, Tempe, Turrella, Undercliffe, and Wolli Creek; as well as parts of Belmore, Beverly Hills, Campsie, Canterbury, Carlton, Dulwich Hill, Hurlstone Park, Hurstville, Kingsgrove, Kogarah, Marrickville, and Penshurst.

<doc id="1077818" wikidata="Q817830" url="?curid=1077818" title="Division of Bennelong">
<text>The Division of Bennelong is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. The division was created in 1949 and is named after Woollarawarre Bennelong, an Aboriginal man befriended by the first Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip. The seat is represented by Jerome Laxale since the 2022 Australian federal election.

Bennelong covers 60 km2 of the Northern Sydney region, including all of the local government areas of Ryde and parts of Hornsby and Parramatta. It includes the suburbs of Denistone, Denistone East, Denistone West, East Ryde, Eastwood, Epping, Macquarie Park, Marsfield, Meadowbank, Melrose Park, North Epping, North Ryde, Putney, Ryde, Tennyson Point and West Ryde; as well as parts of Beecroft, Carlingford, Chatswood West, Dundas, Ermington and Gladesville.

It was represented from 1974 until 2007 by John Howard, who served as the Prime Minister of Australia from 1996 until 2007. As well as his government then being defeated, Howard also became the second sitting Australian Prime Minister to lose his own seat. Though historically a fairly safe Liberal seat, modern-day electoral boundaries and demographic changes have seen Bennelong become an increasingly marginal seat. The 2007 outcome in Bennelong resulted in Labor candidate Maxine McKew winning the seat on a thin 1.4 percent margin after a close contest, making her the first Labor MP for Bennelong. After a single term, McKew was defeated by Liberal candidate John Alexander in 2010, who retained it (not including a short vacancy in 2017) until the 2022 general election.

The seat was vacant from 11 November 2017 when Alexander resigned amid the 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis after confirming he was a dual citizen and therefore ineligible to sit in parliament. Despite a significant swing against him, Alexander was re-elected at the 2017 Bennelong by-election on 16 December.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==Electoral history==

When the Division of Bennelong was created in 1949, it covered mainly the suburbs of Ryde, Hunters Hill and Lane Cove, all of which were (and still are) relatively affluent areas. It was originally created as a notionally marginal Liberal seat. However, the Liberal margin blew out in the Coalition&#x27;s landslide victory that year, and for most of the next half-century it was a fairly safe to safe Liberal seat.

The seat&#x27;s first member was Sir John Cramer, a minister in the Menzies government. In 1974, he handed the seat to John Howard, a minister in the Fraser government, and Leader of the Opposition from 1985 to 1989 and 1995 to 1996 before becoming Prime Minister of Australia from 1996 to 2007.

From 1949 to 1996, the Liberal hold on the seat was only seriously threatened four times; those were the only times that the seat was marginal against Labor. From 1998 onward, Bennelong became increasingly marginal, and this has been attributed to two factors. Firstly, the electoral boundary of Bennelong has been redrawn (&quot;redistributed&quot;) numerous times, pushing it further westward into Labor-friendly territory near Paramatta. Successive redistributions eliminated Lane Cove and Hunters Hill in the east and incorporated Eastwood, Epping, Carlingford and middle-class Ermington in the north and west. Secondly, the demographic has changed as well: since the early 1990s, Eastwood and surrounding suburbs have seen an influx of migrants from China, Hong Kong, South Korea and India, who are relatively affluent and conservative, but are sensitive towards political policies on immigration and multiculturalism.

===1998 election===
In 1998, Prime Minister John Howard finished just short of a majority on the first count in the seat, and was only assured of re-election on the ninth count. He ultimately won a fairly comfortable 56 percent of the two-party-preferred vote.

===2004 election===
In 2004, for the second time since becoming Prime Minister, Howard came up short of a majority in the first count for the seat. He was assured of re-election on the third count, ultimately winning 53.3 percent of the two-party-preferred vote. The two-party-preferred vote for the Liberals declined 3.4% in the 2004 election, contrary to a strong national trend to the Coalition (and a particularly strong one to the Coalition in outer-suburban metropolitan seats), making Bennelong a marginal seat at that time, with a margin of just 4.3%. The 2006 redistribution pushed this margin slightly further into Labor territory, due to the inclusion of the predominantly working-class and public housing suburb of Ermington in Bennelong&#x27;s boundaries. The Greens increased their vote at this election by 12.34% to 16.37% at this election, owing to the pre-selection of the high-profile Andrew Wilkie as candidate.

===2007 election===
 In the 2007 election, the incumbent Member for Bennelong, then-Prime Minister John Howard, lost the seat to Labor candidate Maxine McKew, after holding it for 33 years. This was only the second time in Australian history that an incumbent Prime Minister had been defeated in his own electorate, the first being Stanley Bruce in 1929. The election marked the first time a Labor candidate won, and also the first time a woman won the seat.

After the 2004 election, Howard sat on a margin of four percent, placing Bennelong just barely on the edge of seats that would fall to Labor in the event of a uniform swing that delivered it government.

As expected, the contest was very tight, and many media outlets listed Bennelong as a Labor gain on election night. In his nationwide speech conceding the election, Howard admitted it was &quot;very likely&quot; he had lost his own seat. Following initial reluctance to officially call the outcome (despite confidence of success), McKew declared victory officially on 1 December. At that time, the Australian Electoral Commission showed McKew ahead on a two-candidate-preferred basis, by 43,272 votes to 41,159; however, pre-poll, postal and absent votes were still being counted and could possibly have affected the outcome.

Howard formally conceded defeat in Bennelong on 12 December. The Electoral Commission declared the seat, with 44,685 votes for McKew to 42,251 for Howard. McKew led for most of the night, and ultimately won on the 14th count after over three-fourths of Green preferences flowed to her. Voter turnout in Bennelong was 95%.

====Polls====
===2010–17===
For the 2010 federal election, the Liberal Party pre-selected former tennis professional and tennis commentator John Alexander to contest the marginal seat. McKew recontested the seat for Labor. After a long and high-profile campaign, Alexander won the seat back from Labor; he increased both the Liberals&#x27; two-party-preferred and primary vote for the first time since 2001, and gained the largest swing towards the Liberals since 1996. Alexander defeated McKew with a two-party-preferred swing of 4.52% (cf. the 2.58% national swing in the 2010 federal election), contributing to the Gillard government&#x27;s loss of its parliamentary majority.

McKew said Labor had failed to repeat the professional and targeted campaign of 2007. She also conceded that the removal of Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister had been a factor in the party&#x27;s poor showing, along with the Government&#x27;s dumping of the emissions trading scheme and a lacklustre national campaign.

Alexander picked up a four-percent swing in the 2013 federal election as the Coalition returned to government, returning Bennelong to its traditional status as a safe Liberal seat. He was reelected in 2016 with a small swing in his favour, even as the Coalition barely won a second term. On 11 November 2017, Alexander resigned his seat over questions of his eligibility to stand under section 44 of the Constitution, necessitating a by-election.

===2017 by-election===

Amid the 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, the trigger for the by-election was the resignation of Liberal incumbent John Alexander effective 11 November 2017. A few weeks following the increased clarity which came from the judgment of the High Court of Australia sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns on 27 October 2017 further determining dual citizenship ineligibility under Section 44 of the Constitution, Alexander resigned due to a belief that he may have held British citizenship at the time of his nomination and election, meaning he would be ineligible under Section 44 of the Constitution to sit in the Parliament of Australia. Alexander renounced any British citizenship he may have held, or otherwise been eligible for, in order to nominate for election again.

Alexander won the 2017 Bennelong by-election despite an approximate five percent two-party swing away to Labor candidate Kristina Keneally which made the seat marginal.

===2019 election===
Alexander was not challenged for preselection for the 2019 federal election. With a margin of 9.7% from the 2016 election, Alexander competed against high profile neurosurgeon Brian Owler, who formerly chaired the Australian Medical Association and has worked closely with the NSW Government to be the face of a successful anti-speeding campaign for road safety. Owler&#x27;s eminent persona was aided by several inflammatory remarks from Alexander, ultimately leading to a 2.8% swing away to Labor, which reduced the Liberal Party&#x27;s hold on the seat to a margin of 6.9%. Alexander, who was standing for the 5th time as candidate for Bennelong, is widely regarded to have built a strong personal vote in the seat. This has led to Bennelong having a relatively stable two party preferred result from the last 3 federal elections, in the Coalition&#x27;s favour. Alexander declared victory shortly after counting had passed 50%.

===2022 election===

On 12 November 2021, Alexander revealed that he would not contest the seat at the forthcoming federal election. ABC election analyst Antony Green pointed to the loss of Alexander&#x27;s high personal vote as a vulnerability for the Coalition, giving the Labor Party a strong chance to reclaim the seat after McKew was unseated by Alexander in 2010. Former Ryde mayor and Labor candidate Jerome Laxale took the seat from the Liberals with a 7.9% swing in his favour, making him the second Labor member ever to win it. The loss of the seat has been attributed to the notably large swings against the Liberal Party among Chinese Australian voters which has cost the Liberal Party many key seats.

<text>The International Space University (ISU) is dedicated to the discovery, research, and development of outer space and its applications for peaceful purposes, through international and multidisciplinary education and research programs. ISU was founded in 1987 and is registered in France and in the US as a non profit organisation. The university offers a one or two-year Master in Space Studies (MSS) in Strasbourg and shorter professional development programs across the world. The latter include an itinerant nine-week Space Studies Program (SSP), a five-week Southern Hemisphere SSP in partnership with the University of South Australia, a 6-week Commercial Space graduate certificate in partnership with the Florida Institute of Technology, and one-week Executive Space Courses in Australia, Europe and the United States.

The International Space University Central Campus and global headquarters are located in Illkirch-Graffenstaden which is a suburb of Strasbourg in northeastern France. ISU was founded on the &quot;3-Is&quot; philosophy providing an Interdisciplinary, Intercultural, and International environment for educating and training space professionals and post-graduate students. As of April 2020, there were over 5000 ISU alumni from 109 countries. In November 2017 the International Space University hosted a conference in Strasbourg that led to the formation of the Moon Village Association. The ISU faculty members include astronauts, space agency leaders, space engineers, space scientists, managers, and experts in space law and policy comprising an international collection of experts in technical and non-technical space-related fields.

The Chancellor of the International Space University is Pascale Ehrenfreund, Chair of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Executive Board and President of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). She was preceded by Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who succeeded then–European Space Agency Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain and acclaimed science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, in 2004. The sixth President of the International Space University is Juan de Dalmau who succeeded Prof. Walter Peeters, in September 2018.

==History==
In 1985, three young space enthusiasts created the Space Generation Foundation, dedicated to fostering a sense of identity for those people born since the beginning of the space era. The ISU founders are Peter Diamandis, one of the founders of SEDS and a medical doctor with a Master&#x27;s in aerospace engineering from MIT; Todd Hawley, a graduate from Space Policy Institute at George Washington University; Robert D. Richards, an engineer and physicist, and former assistant of the well-known astrophysicist Carl Sagan. The three men generated a series of novel ideas from which a &quot;Space University&quot; was exceptionally well received. The idea garnered the support of a number of important personalities in the space field, including Prof. U.R. Rao, president of the Indian Space Research Organization; Dr. Harrison Schmitt, an Apollo 17 astronaut and former senator; Dr. Burton Edelson, Associate Administrator of NASA for Space, Science, and Applications; Dr. Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill from the Space Studies Institute; space pioneer Prof. Hermann Oberth; and Arthur C. Clarke, the visionary writer, along with many others.

This initiative was further developed and presented to the Advances in the Astronautical Sciences (AAS) Meeting dedicated to &quot;Aerospace Century XXI&quot; in Boulder, Colorado in 1986. The following year, a three-day Founding Conference convened at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 10 to 12 April 1987. These dates were chosen to commemorate the flight of Yuri Gagarin (12 April 1961), the first human in space. 
With the addition of a fourth founder, Christopher D. Mau, a Cambridge venture capitalist, ISU organizational work began in earnest. The Founding Conference culminated in the formal creation of the International Space University, and established it as a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization in the state of Massachusetts, USA. The first ISU Summer Session Program (SSP) took place at MIT from 20 June to 20 August 1988 with the support of the major space agencies. A significant announcement in an article dating 5 July 1988, in the Christian Science Monitor introduced the four founders and their novel and exciting venture. In a ceremonial gesture, the first international participants in the summer session were led by the four founders in a walk across the Charles River from MIT in Cambridge to Boston. The artwork for the first brochure was made by Pat Rawlings and is still in use today. The original offices of the fledgling ISU were located in a Victorian townhouse overlooking bustling Kenmore Square in Boston.

Following an international competition for a host city for the Central Campus, the ISU home base moved from Massachusetts to Illkirch-Graffenstaden in the Urban Community of Strasbourg, France, in 1994. ISU is now a non-profit association registered in Alsace (France), and is still registered in the US as a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization. The Governing Members of ISU are international organizations, industries, space agencies, academic institutions, and individual members.

The French Ministry of Education formally recognized ISU as an institute of higher education in 2004
The International Space University has had permanent observer status with the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs since 1998. ISU was also granted full membership of the Space Agency Forum (SAF) in 1995. ISU is a member of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) and has been invited to contribute to a number of international activities including the Asia-Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum, the IAF Symposium on &quot;Bringing Space into Education&quot;, the World Space Workshop on Education, and the National Science Week Steering Committee.

==Campus==
ISU originally evolved in a geographically decentralized way, with summer sessions convened in a different country each year. In 1994 the Central Campus was established in Strasbourg, Alsace, France, because of its central European location and unique character. During the first years, the Master of Science classes took place in the Pôle API of the École Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Strasbourg.

Since 2002 ISU has had its own building, thanks to the support of the local authorities. The Central Campus is now located in the &quot;Parc d&#x27;Innovation&quot; of Illkirch-Graffenstaden just south of Strasbourg.

==Organization and administration==
ISU&#x27;s organizational structure includes a Board of Advisors, chaired by the Chancellor, and a board of trustees elected by the Governing Membership of the ISU. The Board of Trustees determines ISU&#x27;s overall objectives, oversees the university&#x27;s affairs and appoints the ISU President. The President is supported by an executive committee, Academic Staff (who prepare and deliver ISU programs) and Administrative Staff (responsible for the daily operation of the Institution). The Academic Staff are led by the Dean, who is supported by staff responsible for ISU&#x27;s academic programs (Masters and SSP) and library services. The Academic Council of ISU is responsible for ensuring the academic quality of ISU&#x27;s teaching and research activities. ISU academic staff include a number of Resident Faculty, augmented by other Faculty and Lecturers as needed for the programs.

==Academic facilities==

===Library===
Since 1995, the collection of the ISU Library has grown to reach about 9,000 space-related documents. The collection supports the interdisciplinary aspects of the courses and includes subjects like space-related business and management, space policy and law, international cooperation, remote sensing and Earth observation, telecommunication, space engineering, space mission design, astronomy, space life sciences, and space medicine. The Library also features news about space, information from space agencies and research institutes around the world, and awareness and alerting services from journals. RSS feeds can be used to follow the library&#x27;s new acquisitions. Interested people may subscribe to the feeds for receiving regular updates about books, electronic documents, or Team Projects reports that are added to the online catalog.

<text>The Division of Berowra () is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. The Division covers the northern parts of the Greater Sydney area with the local government areas of the Hornsby Shire and the Hills Shire.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1969 and is named for the suburb of Berowra.

Its boundaries have changed little since it was created, and it includes the suburbs of Annangrove, Arcadia, Berowra, Berowra Creek, Berowra Heights, Berowra Waters, Berrilee, Brooklyn, Canoelands, Cheltenham, Cherrybrook, Cowan, Dangar Island, Dural, Fiddletown, Fishermans Point, Forest Glen, Galston, Glenorie, Hawkesbury River, Hornsby Heights, Kenthurst, Laughtondale, Maroota, Middle Dural, Milsons Passage, Mount Kuring-gai, Pennant Hills, Round Corner, Sackville North, Singletons Mill, South Maroota, Thornleigh, and Westleigh; as well as parts of Asquith, Beecroft, Carlingford, Castle Hill, Cattai, Glenhaven, Hornsby, Leets Vale, Lower Hawkesbury, Lower Portland, Maraylya, Mount Colah, Normanhurst, West Pennant Hills, and Wisemans Ferry.

The seat has always been viewed as a safe seat for the Liberal Party, but has become slightly more marginal in 2022. The seat is currently held by Liberal Julian Leeser. Leeser served as shadow Attorney-General and shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians from the 2022 election until resigning from both positions on 11 April 2023 due to the Liberals formally announcing their opposition to the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum.

<text>The Division of Blaxland is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

Blaxland runs from the M4 motorway line in the north to Marion Street and the Bankstown railway line and M5 motorway in the south, between Woodville Road in the west and Stacey Street in the east, covering 61 square kilometres of Labor heartland in the Cumberland and Canterbury-Bankstown local government areas in Sydney&#x27;s west, with strong Middle Eastern and East Asian communities.

==History==

The division was created in 1949 and is named after Gregory Blaxland, a farmer and an early Australian explorer of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. The division has been a comfortably safe seat for Labor since its creation; western Sydney has been a Labor &quot;heartland&quot; for over a century. Initially created as a notional Lang Labor seat, the official ALP narrowly won it over former NSW Premier Jack Lang. This is the only election at which (official) Labor has won less than 56 percent of the two-party vote, as well as the only one in which it did not win an outright majority on the first count.

Its most notable member has been Paul Keating, who was Prime Minister of Australia from 1991 until 1996 after having previously served as Treasurer of Australia from 1983 until 1991. In 2007, Keating&#x27;s successor, Michael Hatton, lost preselection for this seat to current member Jason Clare, who was a staffer for former New South Wales Premier Bob Carr.

In 2017, the division had the highest percentage of &quot;No&quot; responses in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, with 73.9% of the electorate&#x27;s respondents to the survey responding &quot;No&quot;. The Survey had strong opposition from Muslim communities in the electorate.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division is based in the western suburbs of Sydney, and includes the suburbs of Bass Hill, Berala, Birrong, Chester Hill, Georges Hall, Lansdowne, Lansvale, Potts Hill, Regents Park, Sefton, and Yagoona; and parts of the business park and airport at Bankstown Airport; as well as parts of Auburn, Bankstown, Canley Vale, Carramar, Condell Park, Guildford, Lidcombe, Merrylands, South Granville, Villawood, and Yennora.

== Demographics ==
Blaxland is a socially conservative and historically working-class electorate which includes sizable immigrant populations from China, Vietnam, and the Middle East. It has one of the highest Muslim populations in Australia at 29.2%. According to the 2016 census, 20.1% of electors spoke Arabic at home, the highest percentage in Australia. The electorate remains an electoral stronghold for the centre-left Labor Party.

<text>The Division of Bradfield is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

==History==

Bradfield was created in the 1949 expansion of Parliament, and was named in honour of John Bradfield, the designer and builder of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Its first member was Billy Hughes, a former Prime Minister of Australia and the last serving member of the first federal Parliament. The bulk of the seat was carved out of North Sydney, which Hughes represented from 1923 to 1949. After Hughes, its best-known member was Brendan Nelson, a minister in the third and fourth Howard governments and the federal Leader of the Opposition from 2007 to 2008. The current Member for Bradfield, since the 2009 Bradfield by-election, is Paul Fletcher, a member of the Liberal Party of Australia.

Located in the traditional Liberal stronghold of Sydney&#x27;s North Shore, Bradfield has been in Liberal hands for its entire existence, and for most of that time has been reckoned as a very safe Liberal seat. Most of the territory covered by the seat has been represented by centre-right MPs since Federation. 

While Labor historically runs dead in the North Shore, Bradfield is particularly hostile territory for Labor; the party has never come anywhere close to winning the seat. The Liberal hold on the seat has only been even remotely threatened twice. At a 1952 by-election triggered by Hughes’ death, the Liberals were held to 58 percent of the two-party vote. Even then, the Liberals still won more than enough primary votes to retain the seat without the need for preferences.

In the 2022 federal election, Voices of Bradfield-endorsed independent candidate Nicolette Boele slashed the Liberal margin in the seat from 16.56% to 4.23%, turning Bradfield into a marginal seat on a two-candidate preferred basis for the first time in its history, amid the collapse of Liberal support in the North Shore. The swing against the Liberals was enough to drop the Liberal margin in a &quot;traditional&quot; two-party contest with Labor to 56 percent, the first time the seat has been marginal against Labor. The Liberal primary vote plummeted to 45.05%, the first time the Liberal Party received less than 50% of the primary vote in Bradfield. The Liberals lost 15.28% of their primary vote, the largest swing in the country.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The electorate is located in the upper North Shore and covers an area of approximately 101 km2, covering the suburbs Castle Cove, East Killara, East Lindfield, Gordon, Killara, Lindfield, North Turramurra, North Wahroonga, Pymble, Roseville, Roseville Chase, South Turramurra, St Ives, St Ives Chase, Turramurra, Wahroonga, Waitara, Warrawee, and West Pymble; as well as parts of Asquith, Chatswood, Chatswood West, Hornsby, Mount Colah, and Normanhurst. The electorate has undergone minor boundary changes, with the redistribution in 2016 shifting slightly south, gaining Castle Cove and parts of Chatswood from North Sydney while losing parts of Thornleigh, Normanhurst and Hornsby. The 2025 redistribution saw the electorate once again move south, gaining most of the City of Willoughby, while losing Asquith, Normanhurst, Hornsby, Waitara, as well as Hornsby Shire parts Wahroonga to Berowra. Small Ku-ring-gai Council parts of Wahroonga (Only North of the Coups Creek) were also moved to Berowra

<text>The Division of Calare ( or ) is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was first contested at the 1906 election; created to replace the abolished Division of Canobolas, and is named for the local Aboriginal name for the Lachlan River, which runs through the western part of the division. The Aboriginal name is pronounced Kal-&quot;ah&quot;-ree, but the pronunciation Kul-&quot;air&quot; is established for the division.

The division originally encompassed Forbes, Orange and Parkes. Subsequent boundary changes moved it eastwards to encompass Bathurst, Lithgow and Oberon. On these boundaries it was notionally a marginal seat between the Australian Labor Party (which held it 1983–96) and the National Party, but it was held comfortably by an independent, Peter Andren, from 1996 to 2007. Andren was not a candidate for the 2007 election: he intended to run for a Senate seat but was diagnosed with cancer in 2007 and died during the election campaign.

A redistribution in 2006 moved the boundaries west to take in Cowra, Grenfell and the vast north-west of New South Wales from Brewarrina to Menindee, making Calare New South Wales&#x27;s largest electorate. Lithgow, Bathurst and Oberon, which tend to favour Labor, were transferred to the neighbouring seat of Macquarie. At the 2007 federal election, Calare was won by the Nationals&#x27; representative John Cobb on a margin of 12.1 percent. Cobb had previously represented the Division of Parkes, parts of which were redistributed into Calare in 2006.

The 2009 redistribution of NSW moved the boundaries back east, to again include Lithgow, Bathurst and Oberon. Most of the northwestern area of the division was transferred to the neighbouring Division of Parkes. The changes took effect at the 2010 election.

The division currently stretches from Mudgee, Gulgong, Dubbo, Wellington in the north-west, to Orange, Bathurst, Lithgow and Oberon in the south-east and Canowindra in the south-west.

The current Member for Calare, since the 2016 federal election, is Andrew Gee, an Independent member who was originally elected as a member of the National Party.

<doc id="1077832" wikidata="Q1074192" url="?curid=1077832" title="Division of Charlton">
<text>The Division of Charlton was an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. The division was created in 1984 and is named for Matthew Charlton, who was Leader of the Australian Labor Party 1922–28.

The division was located in the Hunter region of New South Wales, including the coal-mining towns of Cardiff and Wallsend as well as Toronto, Morisset, Cooranbong, Brightwaters, Windermere Park, Sunshine, Glendale and Warners Bay.

The division was renamed Division of Hunter in the 2016 federal election, while the previous Division of Hunter was abolished in the same election. The last Member for Charlton, from the 2013 federal election, was Pat Conroy, a member of the Australian Labor Party.

==History==
Charlton was first created in 1984. Much of its territory came from Hunter, which Matthew Charlton held from 1910 to 1928. From its inception, it had been a safe seat for Labor. The Hunter Region is one of the few areas outside capital cities where Labor has consistently done well.

The most prominent members were Bob Brown, a minister in the Hawke and Keating governments, and Greg Combet, a former secretary of the ACTU from 2000 to 2007, and a minister in the Gillard and Rudd governments.

During the 2013 federal election campaign, the Liberal Party of Australia endorsed Kevin Baker as their candidate for the division. However, Baker was forced to end his campaign on 21 August 2013 due to controversy over inappropriate content on a car enthusiasts&#x27; website that he hosted. The Australian Electoral Commission had closed candidate nominations by the time Baker abandoned his campaign. The Liberals did not field a replacement candidate in the election. However, Baker was still listed on ballot papers as the Liberal candidate, as they had already been printed at the time of Baker&#x27;s resignation from the campaign; in excess of electors gave him their first preference vote.

Under the original proposed redistribution for the 2016 federal election, the Division of Hunter was to be abolished. Since Hunter is an original Federation electorate, the Australian Electoral Commission&#x27;s guidelines for redistributions required it to make every effort to preserve the Hunter name. To that end, the Commission proposed renaming Charlton to Hunter. Effectively, this meant that Charlton was abolished, and Hunter pushed slightly eastward to absorb much of Charlton&#x27;s former territory. Although most voters of the new Hunter division came from the former Charlton division, Conroy stood down in favour of the member for the old Hunter division, Joel Fitzgibbon. Conroy contested and won the neighbouring seat of Shortland.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

<text>Auen is an &quot;Ortsgemeinde&quot; – a municipality belonging to a , a kind of collective municipality – in the Bad Kreuznach district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Bad Sobernheim, whose seat is in the like-named town. Auen is a tourism-oriented community and a state-recognized recreational area.

==Geography==

===Location===
Auen lies in the southern Hunsrück between the Soonwald’s heights and the river Nahe. The municipal area measures 271 ha and the countryside is characterized by woodland and vineyards.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Auen borders in the north on the town of Bad Sobernheim, in the south on the municipality of Monzingen and in the west on the municipality of Langenthal.

===Constituent communities===
Also belonging to Auen is the outlying homestead of Gosenhof.

===Geology===
It is rather easy even for those outside the field of geology to make out the geological composition in Auen and its outlying countryside. The Saar-Saale Depression runs almost down the middle of the Auener Tal (dale) from northeast to southwest, forming a clear boundary between the Rotliegend geology lying to the south and the Devonian geology lying to the north, which began in the framework of the Variscan orogeny and continued through the Pennsylvanian and into the Cisuralian. During this time, the depression was filled with thick sediments of terrestrial-limnic facies, which today can be seen as thrust sheets and streams. The bores (5 × 50 m deep) drilled to supply the municipal hall with geothermal heat showed the same mix of minerals. The groundwater that feeds the Kneipp wading basin in the village has a constant temperature in both summer and winter, with almost the same rate of flow, of 110 °C. There is no danger of volcanic eruption. The sandstone layers that formed in the Rotliegend were formerly important to employment in Auen. From the roughly eight sandstone quarries opened here, dressed stones and capitals were delivered to Cologne between 1842 and 1863 for cathedral building. Also unearthed at some of these quarries (Triftweg, Duschied, Bohnebruch) was petrified wood from the Permian. From the Devonian came fossilized plants here and there (Cordaitales leaves) and also small, fossilized creatures. These once existed in a collection, but this has unfortunately disappeared. A coal seam has also been observed north of Auen, but this has never been exploited because it is too thin to be commercially recoverable.

==History==

===Archaeology===
Auen was until after the Second World War a blank on the map of archaeological finds in the Bad Kreuznach district. A few find sites were already known, but there were still no digs or listings available. Through constant observation and subsequent digs, however, 22 find sites have now been identified. All digs were carried out under supervision of the Office for the Care of Buried Monuments (&quot;Amt für Bodendenkmalpflege&quot;) in Mainz. Listed here are some of the finds that have been brought to light in Auen, or locations where finds have turned up:
* Stone hatchets and ceramics from roughly 3500 to 2000 BC
* Two burnt-out wooden wells from Celtic times
* Millstone from Celtic times
* Grape seeds, wheat and barley corns from La Tène times
* Great clay vessel from Hallstatt times
* Finds near Saint Willigis’s Chapel from Gallo-Roman times
* Four Roman watermains
* Top of a Roman amphora
* Roman house with sewerpipe
* Roman coin from roughly AD 200
* Various places with Roman potsherds
* Ivory cross from roughly 1300
* Two places with Roman vessels
* Eight sandstone quarries
* Two limekilns
* One coal pit and further prospecting

===Middle Ages===
Auen&#x27;s history, which is marked by an unusual wealth of documentary material for a place of its size, thus seeming almost exaggerated, can be explained by the village&#x27;s time as a landhold of Sponheim Abbey and Saint Willigis’s Chapel’s time as a landhold of Disibodenberg Abbey. The formerly held assumption that Auen arose in the time of the Frankish taking of the land about AD 900 no longer bears up against the latest knowledge that has come to light. Archaeological finds now show that there had been human habitation here, some of it permanent, in earlier times. Furthermore, all digs undertaken at Roman sites have yielded Celtic finds as well, leading to the conclusion that the dale was settled as far back as the New Stone Age. In 1128, Auen had its first documentary mention in a confirmation document issued by Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz in connection with the building of Saint Willigis&#x27;s Chapel, itself having been mentioned about 980 or 990. As early as 1044 and 1048, the village was listed in donation documents from Count Eberhard of Sponheim kept at the church at Sponheim (in Auen, the landhold in question amounted to four &quot;Huben&quot;). In 1203, Auen, along with its land and people, was donated as a payment to Sponheim Abbey, as the abbot had kept such good watch over the County of Sponheim during the Count&#x27;s crusade. Auen&#x27;s long allegiance to Sponheim Abbey is confirmed by the 1488 &quot;Auener Weistum&quot; (a &quot;Weistum&quot; – cognate with English &quot;wisdom&quot; – was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times) and by Abbot Johannes Trithemius’s homage about 1500; it might have lasted until 1570.

===Modern times===
This allegiance brought Auen into the &quot;Oberamt&quot; of Kreuznach. This was mentioned in a 1601 description of the &quot;Amt&quot;, which said that, among other things, the lordship of Sponheim Abbey and the outlying village of Auen both belonged to the &quot;Oberamt&quot; of Kreuznach. By this time, Auen was already an exclave between the other &quot;Ämter&quot;. Also mentioned was that Auen lay within the range of the &quot;Amt&quot; of Böckelheim but was nonetheless otherwise strictly subject to the &quot;Oberamt&quot; of Kreuznach. At the same time, the inhabitants of Auen were subject ecclesiastically to the parish of Geh in Kirche, which was in turn subject to Disibodenberg Abbey. This arrangement worked out quite well for the inhabitants of Auen. About 1550, the Reformation was introduced. The last priest left the parish of Getzbach and became the first Protestant minister in Pferdsfeld (a now vanished village). In 1575, the Getzbacher Wald (forest) was sold, thus stripping Auen of lands that had hitherto reached up to the Hummerstuhl, which amounted to almost half the municipal area. In 1707, Auen passed to Electoral Palatinate while remaining in the &quot;Oberamt&quot; of Kreuznach until Napoleonic times.

====Recent times====
After belonging for some years under French rule to the &quot;Mairie&quot; (“Mayoralty”) of Monzingen, Auen passed under the terms of the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to the Prussian &quot;Amt&quot; of Monzingen, which governed it for 154 years. Although Auen is a very old village, it was only in the 19th century that it blossomed into one of the Nahe region&#x27;s agricultural and winegrowing hubs. The planting of vineyards promised a good secondary income earner, although a grape seed from about 1500 BC had already been found in the municipality along with some grain. The stonemason&#x27;s craft, too, flourished at the quarries around Auen. In the mid 19th century, finished capitals and stones were delivered from these to Cologne Cathedral. Thirty-nine small farms grew what was needed. New farm lanes that afforded readier access were laid to make farmwork easier. A few farmers received certificates about 1900 for good yields. Beginning in 1770, 31 inhabitants emigrated. Out of 180 inhabitants, eight fell in the First World War and two went missing in action. In the Second World War, of the 56 soldiers from Auen, 23 fell and 4 went missing. In the course of the 1969 administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, Auen was grouped into the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Bad Sobernheim. In 1993, the &quot;Auener Chronik&quot;, the village chronicle, was published. In recent years, Auen has grown into a residential community fit for tourism that has still not lost its rustic character.

===Municipality’s name===
Auen is a placename that describes a settlement or a homestead. Only beginning in the mid 18th century did the current spelling “Auen” establish itself as the customary one. In Modern High German, the name literally means “floodplains” or “riverside flats”, and indeed this would seem to be its derivation. Thus it is Germanic, but from Celtic &quot;dhwö&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European &quot;akua&quot; (“water”), &quot;a(z)wjö&quot; (“island”). It is akin to the Latin &quot;aqua&quot; (“water”) and the Old High German &quot;auw(i)a&quot; (“land at, in or near water”). Over the ages, Auen has borne the following names:
* 1047: &quot;Auwen&quot;
* 1124: &quot;Auwen&quot;
* 1488: &quot;dorff Awen&quot;
* 1588: &quot;Awen&quot;
* 1601: &quot;Dörflein Awen&quot;
* 1720: &quot;Gemeind Awen&quot;
* 1731: &quot;Auwen&quot;
* 1758: Auen
* 1761: Auen

===Population development===
Auen has always been a small village that has never emerged from the shadows. In 1437/1438, the village&#x27;s population was recorded as 8 hearths (for which read “households”). Between 1580 and 1600, there were 81 inhabitants living at 18 hearths, and in 1808 there were 152 inhabitants in Auen. The table shows Auen&#x27;s population development since Napoleonic times. The figures in the table from 1871 to 1987 are based on censuses:
==Religion==
As at 31 August 2013, there are 193 full-time residents in Auen, and of those, 96 are Evangelical (49.741%), 55 are Catholic (28.497%), 3 (1.554%) belong to other religious groups and 39 (20.207%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.

==Politics==

===Municipal council===
The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

===Mayor===
Auen&#x27;s mayor is Torsten Baus.

===Coat of arms===
The German blazon reads: &quot;Schild durch silbernen Schrägbalken geteilt, der mit einem Schwarzen A belegt ist. Oben blau-goldenes Schach, unten in Blau eine goldene Abtskrümme.&quot;

The municipality&#x27;s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: A bend argent charged with the letter A sable between chequy of twelve azure and Or and azure an abbot&#x27;s staff bendwise couped in base of the fourth.

The bend (slanted stripe) with the letter A – for “Auen”, of course – goes back to a court seal from 1731. The charge below this, the abbot&#x27;s staff, refers to Archbishop Bardo of Mainz, who in 1044 listed, among other places, Auen in a donation document. The “chequy” pattern recalls the County of Sponheim, to which Auen belonged until the late 18th century.

==Culture and sightseeing==

===Buildings===
The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate’s Directory of Cultural Monuments:
* Hauptstraße 2 – house, Late Classicist sandstone-block building, about 1850
* Zur Feuchten Ecke 1 – former school, town hall; Late Classicist sandstone-block building, about 1850
* In the forest – Saint Willigis’s Catholic Chapel (&quot;St. Willigiskapelle&quot;), formerly “Go-To-Church” (&quot;Geh-in-Kirche&quot;); quire of Romanesque church, converted to Early Gothic, which had been in ruins since the 17th century, but reconstructed in 1912

====Saint Willigis’s Chapel====
The Chapel was formerly known as the &quot;Geh in Kirche&quot; or the &quot;Getzbach/Götzbach Kirche&quot;. Archbishop and Chancellor Willigis from Mainz saw on his inspectional and informational journeys through his rather vast and extensive region that there was already good and eager religious activity, yet there was also a certain lack of gathering places such as churches and other centres of worship to shore up and foster the consolidation of Christian life, especially in outlying areas. On the river Nahe at the bigger centres, the odd church could already be found, but of course, these were simply not enough to serve all believers. It is clear that wherever the former monastery could draw income, there rose, too, the first churches, as in Meckenbach, Hundsbach and Bollenbach. Disibodenberg Abbey, which had risen once again, and which is said to have been Willigis&#x27;s favourite monastery, was richly furnished with estates, income and tithes. It was up to the canons to spread their influence out from this hub, and thus every thread of their dealings now ran from their monastic seat. In the wild and untamed outlands of the Soon, no income from the old monastic landholds was forthcoming that Willigis could have used. He therefore sought a suitable place, finding it within the limits of the old royal estate of Monzingen, near the village of Auen, owned by a cleric named Wizelin. From this secular priest, Willigis bought an oxgang of land, which he must have found very convenient. In the 1128 document that first mentions Auen, the text does not go into church buildings on the newly acquired lot. It does, however, make clear that there was such a sale. It can be assumed, indeed it is likely, that Willigis found that there were still buildings or ruins on the land from Roman times and he thus had no great difficulty building a church. Furthermore, there were quarries right nearby. It is known today that these buildings that the archbishop would have found here would have been of Roman origin. Perhaps, too, in this outlying area, they had survived the upheavals of the intervening time and had not sustained any serious damage. New knowledge came to light at the time of the renovation in 1978-1979, which yielded rich, informative finds that left no doubt but that the existing foundations are partly of Roman origin. It seems clear that even Willigis would have had qualms about coming to this forsaken land to build a church when even by the 16th century, records were still being made about how dangerous it was there for clergymen on their way to services. Willigis, so the story goes, consecrated this church in which he had put such great hope and named it &quot;Geh-in-Kirche&quot; (or &quot;Gehinkirche&quot;, but either way, meaning “Go-To-Church”) as an everlasting reminder to attend church assiduously, wanting as he did to deepen the Soonwald people&#x27;s understanding of Christian teaching (it should perhaps be pointed out that the verb form, &quot;Geh&quot;, is in the imperative mood). On the other hand, differing opinions have it that this name is not original, but rather that it came from the local dialect, somehow linked to the name &quot;Getzbach&quot; or &quot;Götzbach&quot;, as the local brook was called. Anyone from outside or who was otherwise unfamiliar with the area would not quite gather anything meaningful from either of those names when applied to a church, for a name ending in &quot;—bach&quot; (“brook”), while it might suit a village or a homestead – and would certainly suit a brook – did not quite go with a church. Whatever the old name&#x27;s genesis was, when the chapel was reconstructed early in the 20th century – by which time it had fallen into ruin – it was realized in 1913 that no church had ever been consecrated to Willigis (it is true, though, that although he is often called “Saint Willigis”, he has never actually been canonized). So, the two Catholic dioceses concerned, Trier and Mainz, agreed to give the chapel its new name: &quot;Willigis-Kapelle&quot; (Saint Willigis&#x27;s Chapel), after its builder. The new name, if it can still be called “new” after more than a century, is of the three names mentioned here still not the most widely used, which goes to show that new names do not always quickly sweep old ones away. “Getzbach”, despite any confusion that it may have caused earlier, is still the preferred name for the chapel among locals (“&quot;Ich gehe auf die Getzbach&quot;” – “I’m going to the Getzbach”). The new and thus far only church was the hub of a great spiritual guidance area that stretched far across the Soonwald, all the way to Gehlweiler, taking in the centres of not only Auen and Gehlweiler but also Daubach, Eckweiler (forsaken in the late 20th century), Pferdsfeld (likewise), Winterburg, Ippenschied, Seesbach, Kellenbach and further places that later vanished. Churchgoers had to walk for hours to reach the chapel for services. The dead were buried at the church, too. There was a lichway (a path along which the dead were taken to the church and/or graveyard) running from the Soon to the church. The church soon became too small and Willigis had another church built near Seesbach, the &quot;Sementis-Kapelle&quot;. It had been assumed that the church stood alone, away from the village of Auen. However, given what was found during excavations for the retention basin, which brought to light ample material, it is now believed that a few houses and buildings stood on the other side of the brook. This is also seen in the water supply for the Kneipp wading basin that formerly served people over there. Many documents are on hand dealing with the chapel&#x27;s history. A timeline has been constructed out of some of them here:
* 1128 — Founding of the &quot;Geh in Kirche&quot;
* 1259 — Archbishop Gerhard reserves the right to appoint the parish priest
* 1273 — Sir Philipp, called Paffe, forgoes tithes
* 1339 — Foundation of the Mass
* 1400 — Willigis&#x27;s building supposedly burns down; reconstructed with nave in the Gothic style
* 1501 — Synodic &quot;Weistum&quot;
* 1515 — Synodic court
* 1552 — Last priest, Venter, departs (Reformation); becomes first Reformed pastor in Pferdsfeld, after selling everything off with the Schultheiß of Auen
* 1560 — Reformation is introduced
* 1564 — Niklas von Schmittburg has the right to appoint the pastor and is “collator”
* 1568 — Parish seat is moved to Eckweiler when the rectory burns down
* 1602 — Complaint about the church building&#x27;s bad condition
* 1608 — Church is on the point of collapse
* 1630 — Reconstruction or renovation
* 1685 — Copies of the 1501 &quot;Weistum&quot; by Gehlweiler, which instigated secession
In the graveyard, people from Eckweiler, Daubach, Auen and the Soonwald were henceforth also buried. Now and then, a funeral sermon was still delivered in the ruin, as it was for Friedrich Wilhelm Utsch (“the Hunter from Electoral Palatinate”), as was a yearly sermon. The church, however, kept on falling further into disrepair. People removing the stone for their own building projects also did not help. A listing from 1876 gives a clear indication of how heavy the damage to the church was, and slowly, efforts arose to reconstruct it once again. In a relatively short time, this was finally done and the church was consecrated on 15 September 1912. The building work proceeded without much care taken as to old relics, and certainly a certain amount of destruction of important things resulted. Now, though, there were once more weekly services, weddings, christenings and burials. Through both world wars, little importance was placed on maintaining the building, and so considerable disrepair began to show up once more. In 1977 and 1979, a general overhaul by the parish of Rehbach and make-work measures were carried out. During this work, finds from early history were made, some of them important, including proof that the church stood on Roman foundations; even Celtic material was unearthed. At the &quot;Priorhof&quot; (Bad Sobernheim’s town museum) an exhibit of the most important finds is on loan. Lying buried at the little forest graveyard are Friedrich Wilhelm Utsch, called “the Hunter from Electoral Palatinate”, and his wife and two children.

====Evangelical church====
The &quot;Lapis Primarius&quot; (“Foundation Stone”) Evangelical church has an end window by Röhrig/Bensberg

===Clubs===
The following clubs are active in Auen:
* &quot;Feuerwehr&quot; — fire brigade
* &quot;Landfrauen&quot; — countrywomen&#x27;s club
* &quot;Verschönerungsverein&quot; — beautification club

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Economic structure===
Auen has a small balneotherapeutic facility where one can “take the waters”, although visitors do not drink the water, but rather wade through it. It is a Kneipp facility, complete with a wading basin. Auen also has a number of inns offering the local wine and home-style cooking. There are also private lodging providers.

===Transport===
To the south runs &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 41. Serving nearby Monzingen is a railway station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen–Saarbrücken).

<doc id="1077843" wikidata="Q351405" url="?curid=1077843" title="Yutaka Taniyama">
<text>was a Japanese mathematician known for the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture.

==Life==
Taniyama was born on 22 November 1927 in Kisai, a town in Saitama. He was the sixth of eight children born to a doctor&#x27;s family. He studied at Urawa High School (present-day Saitama University) after graduating from Fudouoka Middle School. He suspended his college for two years due to his medical condition, but finally graduated in 1950. During Taniyama&#x27;s college years, he aspired to be a mathematician after reading Teiji Takagi&#x27;s work.

In 1958, Taniyama worked as an Associate Professor after years of assistant at the University of Tokyo. He also obtained his doctorate from the University in May. In October, Taniyama was engaged to be married to , while the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey offered him a position.

On 17 November 1958, Taniyama committed suicide by poisoning himself with gas. He left a note explaining how far he had progressed with his teaching duties, and apologizing to his colleagues for the trouble he was causing them. The first paragraph of his suicide note read (quoted in Shimura, 1989):
Until yesterday I had no definite intention of killing myself. But more than a few must have noticed that lately I have been tired both physically and mentally. As to the cause of my suicide, I don&#x27;t quite understand it myself, but it is not the result of a particular incident, nor of a specific matter. Merely may I say, I am in the frame of mind that I lost confidence in my future. There may be someone to whom my suicide will be troubling or a blow to a certain degree. I sincerely hope that this incident will cast no dark shadow over the future of that person. At any rate, I cannot deny that this is a kind of betrayal, but please excuse it as my last act in my own way, as I have been doing my own way all my life.

Although his note is mostly enigmatic it does mention tiredness and a loss of confidence in his future. Taniyama&#x27;s ideas had been criticized as unsubstantiated and his behavior had occasionally been deemed peculiar. Goro Shimura mentioned that he suffered from depression.

About a month later, Suzuki also committed suicide by gas, leaving a note reading: &quot;We promised each other that no matter where we went, we would never be separated. Now that he is gone, I must go too in order to join him.&quot;

After Taniyama&#x27;s death, Goro Shimura stated that:
He was always kind to his colleagues, especially to his juniors, and he genuinely cared about their welfare. He was the moral support of many of those who came into mathematical contact with him, including of course myself. Probably he was never conscious of this role he was playing. But I feel his noble generosity in this respect even more strongly now than when he was alive. And yet nobody was able to give him any support when he desperately needed it. Reflecting on this, I am overwhelmed by the bitterest grief.

==Contribution==
Taniyama was best known for conjecturing, in modern language, automorphic properties of L-functions of elliptic curves over any number field. A partial and refined case of this conjecture for elliptic curves over rationals is called the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture or the modularity theorem whose statement he subsequently refined in collaboration with Goro Shimura. The names Taniyama, Shimura and Weil have all been attached to this conjecture, but the idea is essentially due to Taniyama.

Taniyama&#x27;s interests were in algebraic number theory. His work has been influenced by André Weil, who had met Taniyama during the symposiums on algebraic number theory in 1955, in which he became famous after proposing his problems at it.

Taniyama&#x27;s problems proposed in 1955 form the basis of a Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, that &quot;every elliptic curve defined over the rational field is a factor of the Jacobian of a modular function field&quot;. In 1986, Ken Ribet proved that if the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture held, then so would Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, which inspired Andrew Wiles to work for a number of years in secrecy on it, and to prove enough of it to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. Owing to the pioneering contribution of Wiles and the efforts of a number of mathematicians, the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture was finally proven in 1999. The original Taniyama conjecture for elliptic curves over arbitrary number fields remains open.

Goro Shimura stated:
Taniyama was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes. But he made mistakes in a good direction and so eventually he got right answers. I tried to imitate him, but I found out that it is very difficult to make good mistakes.

<text>The Division of Cook is an Australian electoral division in the State of New South Wales.

==History==
Cook was created in 1969, mostly out of the Liberal-leaning areas of neighbouring Hughes. It was thus a natural choice for that seat&#x27;s one-term Liberal member, Don Dobie, to transfer after the creation of Cook erased his majority in Hughes. The division was originally named in honour of James Cook, who mapped the east coast of Australia in 1770. In 2006, the Australian Electoral Commission&#x27;s Redistribution Committee for New South Wales proposed that the division be jointly named for Joseph Cook, Prime Minister of Australia from 1913 to 1914, but this did not eventuate at the time. In 2024, the namesake was finally altered to be joint between both men, to give recognition to Joseph Cook and have a division named after him like other former Prime Ministers.

For most of the first quarter-century of its existence, Cook was a marginal to fairly safe Liberal seat; it has been in Liberal hands for all but two terms. The Liberal majority ballooned with the party&#x27;s national landslide victory at the 1996 general election, and since then Cook has been a &quot;blue ribbon&quot; safe seat for the Liberal Party. As of the 2019 federal election, it is the safest metropolitan Coalition seat, with a 19-point swing needed for Labor to win it.

The most prominent members were Dobie, who held the seat from its 1969 creation until his retirement in 1996 (with a brief break from 1972 to 1975); Bruce Baird, a former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of New South Wales before his move into Federal politics; and Scott Morrison MP, former Prime Minister of Australia 2018–2022.

In 2007, following news of Baird&#x27;s impending retirement, the seat attracted significant media attention, thanks to the controversial preselection of Liberal candidate Michael Towke. Allegations surfaced to the effect that Towke had engaged in branch-stacking and had embellished his curriculum vitae; although these allegations were subsequently proven false, the damage was done. In August 2007, Towke was disendorsed as the Liberal candidate and was replaced with Morrison, a former director of the New South Wales Liberal Party. Morrison won the seat at the election.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division is located in the southern suburbs of Sydney, including Beverley Park, Burraneer, Caringbah, Caringbah South, Carss Park, Cronulla, Dolans Bay, Dolls Point, Greenhills Beach, Gymea Bay, Kangaroo Point, Kogarah Bay, Kurnell, Kyle Bay, Lilli Pilli, Miranda, Monterey, Port Hacking, Ramsgate, Ramsgate Beach, Sandringham, Sans Souci, Sylvania Waters, Taren Point, Woolooware, and Yowie Bay; as well as parts of Blakehurst, Connells Point, Gymea, Kogarah, and Sylvania.

<text>West Knighton is a village and civil parish in Dorset, England, situated southeast of the county town Dorchester. It has an 11th-century church and a village pub. In the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 375.

The village name derives from the Old English &quot;cniht&quot; and &quot;tūn&quot;, meaning the village or farmstead of the young men or retainers. At Little Mayne Farm southwest of the village is the site of a deserted medieval village, which was recorded in the Domesday Book as Maine and in 1201 was known as Parva Maene.

West Knighton parish historically developed out of the amalgamation of four medieval settlements within the ancient hundred of Cullifordtree: the existing main village, the previously mentioned Parva Maene, another medieval settlement at Friarmayne to the south—also deserted and now within neighbouring Broadmayne civil parish—and the fourth at Lewell to the north (now just a farmhouse).

<doc id="1077858" wikidata="Q2021920" url="?curid=1077858" title="William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet William Henry Dudley Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork and 12th Earl of Orrery, (30 November 1873 – 19 April 1967) was a British Royal Navy officer and peer. He served as a junior officer on the China Station during the Boxer Rebellion and went on to serve in the First World War initially as a staff officer during the Dardanelles Campaign and as then commander of the Red Sea Patrol: in that capacity, he led a six-day bombardment of the Turkish held port of Jeddah and worked closely with T. E. Lawrence in support of the Arab Revolt. In the inter-war years he was Commander-in-Chief, Reserve Fleet, President of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich and Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet. After succeeding a cousin and becoming Earl of Cork in 1934, he became Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth.

Boyle also served in the Second World War, first as head of planning for Operation Catherine, an abortive naval offensive in the Baltic Sea proposed by Winston Churchill which aimed to cut off the flow of iron ore from Sweden. He then became commander designate of a planned Anglo-French expedition to assist the Finns in the Winter War they were waging against a Soviet attack: this expedition was also called off. Finally, he was given command of a naval force with a mission to retake the strategic port of Narvik in Norway from the Germans: although Narvik was briefly captured, all allied troops were eventually withdrawn.

==Naval career==
===Early years===
Born the second of four sons of Colonel Gerald Edmund Boyle (a grandson of the Edmund Boyle, 8th Earl of Cork) and to Lady Elizabeth Theresa Pepys (daughter of Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham), &quot;Ginger&quot; Boyle joined the training ship HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; as a cadet on 15 January 1887. He was assigned to the turret battleship HMS &quot;Monarch&quot; in the Channel Squadron in December 1888 and, following promotion to midshipman on 15 June 1889, appointed to the battleship HMS &quot;Colossus&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in March 1890.

Boyle transferred to the corvette HMS &quot;Active&quot; in the Training Squadron in July 1892 and, having been promoted to sub-lieutenant on 1 July 1894, he joined the gunboat HMS &quot;Lizard&quot; on the Australia Station in September 1894. Promoted to lieutenant on 1 October 1895, he transferred to the cruiser HMS &quot;Furious&quot; in the Channel Squadron in July 1898 and then became first lieutenant in the sloop HMS &quot;Daphne&quot; on the China Station in November 1898: in this capacity, he saw action during the Boxer Rebellion. He was appointed First Lieutenant in the torpedo gunboat HMS &quot;Hazard&quot; on 2 July 1902, before becoming commanding officer in the destroyer HMS &quot;Haughty&quot; on 28 August 1902. He went on to be Executive Officer in the cruiser HMS &quot;Astraea&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1904 and, having been promoted to commander on 31 December 1906, he was reassigned as Executive Officer in the battleship HMS &quot;Hibernia&quot; in the Channel Fleet in January 1907. He joined the Naval Intelligence Division at the Admiralty in January 1909 before becoming Executive Officer in the armoured cruiser HMS &quot;Good Hope&quot; in the Atlantic Fleet in 1911. He went on to be commanding officer of the scout cruiser HMS &quot;Skirmisher&quot; in the Home Fleet in January 1912 and was promoted captain on 30 June 1913. He was appointed British naval attaché in Rome in July 1913 and in that capacity was involved as an observer during the Second Balkan War. For this work he was appointed a Commander of the Italian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus.

===First World War===

Boyle served in the First World War initially as a staff officer on the staff of Rear-Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss during the Dardanelles Campaign. He was given command of the light cruiser HMS &quot;Fox&quot; in the Red Sea in September 1915 and went on to be commander of the Red Sea Patrol in January 1916. In that capacity he led a six-day bombardment of the Turkish-held port of Jeddah in June 1916 and worked closely with T. E. Lawrence in support of the Arab Revolt. For his services to Egypt, he was awarded the Order of the Nile, 3rd Class on 4 December 1916. He went on to be Flag Captain to Admiral Sir Henry Oliver, commanding the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron in the Grand Fleet, in the battlecruiser HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; in November 1917. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1918 and, for his services to Jordan, he was awarded the Order of El Nahda, second class on 23 April 1920.

===Inter-war years===
Boyle became commanding officer of the battlecruiser HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; in the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919 and commanding officer of the naval barracks at Devonport in July 1921. He was appointed a naval aide-de-camp to the King on 8 November 1922. Promoted to rear admiral on 1 November 1923, he became second-in-command of the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet with his flag in the battleship HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; in May 1924. After attending the senior officers&#x27; war course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, he became commander of the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet with his flag in the cruiser HMS &quot;Frobisher&quot; in September 1926. After a tour with his squadron on the China Station and promotion to vice admiral on 12 June 1928, he became Commander-in-Chief of the Reserve Fleet with his flag in the light cruiser HMS &quot;Constance&quot; in December 1928 and President of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich in April 1929. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 3 June 1931. Promoted to full admiral on 1 November 1932, he became Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet flying his flag in the battleship HMS &quot;Nelson&quot; in March 1933. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 16 July 1935.

Boyle succeeded his cousin as Earl of Cork and Orrery and Baron Boyle of Marston in 1934 and attended the funeral of King George V in January 1936. He was appointed First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to the King on 12 July 1936 and attended the coronation of King George VI in May 1937. He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth in July 1937 and, having been promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 21 January 1938, was still &quot;...exceedingly fit and full of energy and drive.&quot;

===Second World War===

Lord Cork served in the Second World War initially as head of planning for Operation Catherine, a naval offensive in the Baltic Sea proposed by Winston Churchill which aimed to cut off the flow of iron ore from Sweden and isolate Germany from Scandinavian trade. The operation was intended to take place in the spring of 1940 but was abandoned in January 1940.

Cork then became commander designate of a planned Anglo-French expedition to assist the Finns in the Winter War they were waging against a Soviet attack: Finland agreed to Soviet terms in March 1940 and this expedition was also called off.

In April 1940 Cork was given command of a naval force with a mission to retake the strategic port of Narvik in Norway from the Germans: he flew his flag from the cruiser, HMS &quot;Aurora&quot;. Cork was in favour of an immediate storming of Narvik using both military and naval forces, but the more cautious army commander, Major General Pierse Joseph Mackesy, had orders not to attempt an opposed landing. Cork bombarded Narvik and then abandoned the mission in the face of strong German opposition. Cork provided covering fire for the landing of troops of the French Foreign Legion at Bjerkvik in May 1940 and, although Narvik was briefly captured, he was asked to support the withdrawal of all allied troops in June 1940. He was awarded the Norwegian Order of St. Olav for this operation on 13 October 1942.

===Later years===
Churchill was outraged at Admiral Sir James Somerville for not continuing the pursuit of the Italian Navy after the Battle of Cape Spartivento in November 1940 and dispatched Cork to conduct an inquiry, but Cork found that Somerville had acted entirely appropriately.

Cork served in the Home Guard during the final years of the Second World War and became President of Shaftesbury Homes and Arethusa, a training school for homeless boys in London, in 1942. He attended the funeral of King George VI in February 1952. He died in his home in London on 19 April 1967. He is buried in the graveyard of the Church of St Leonard, Marston Bigot in Somerset, near Marston House, the family seat.

==Family==
Boyle married, at St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Chelsea, on 24 July 1902 Lady Florence Keppel (1871–1963), youngest daughter of the William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle. They had no children.

<doc id="1077865" wikidata="Q1540261" url="?curid=1077865" title="Verdelho">
<text>Verdelho is a white wine grape grown throughout Portugal, though most associated with the island of Madeira, and also gives its name to one of the four main types of Madeira wine. At the turn of the 20th century it was the most widely planted white grape in Madeira.

==Madeira==
The grape has traditionally been one of the most popular grapes planted on the small island of Madeira since vines were first planted there in the 15th century. It was however badly affected by the Phylloxera plague and the number of vines has decreased greatly in the century since then. Since 1993 any Madeira wine labeled as Verdelho must contain at least 85 percent of the grape, which was not previously required.
The variety of Madeira wine known as Verdelho lies between those of Sercial and Bual in style, being drier than Bual but not as dry as Sercial. The variety is known for its high acidity when aged, but if drunk young generally possesses more fruit flavor than the other Madeiras. Some producers are experimenting with making a table-style wine by allowing the grapes to ripen more prior to harvesting and blending with the grape Arnsburger to balance Verdelho&#x27;s naturally high acidity.

==Other regions==
Verdelho is one of the three traditional varieties grown on Pico Island in the Azores, which exported it to mainland Europe (most notably the cellars of Czar Nicholas II) before the variety was all but wiped out in the phylloxera plague. Returning to their roots, the islands of the Azores have been planting the grape again, which is made into fortified wines like Lajido.

The grape is also grown in the Douro valley, where it is sometimes confused with the Gouveio grape. It is also a small component of some Vinho do Dão.
Portuguese Verdelho is noted for its higher sugar content compared to what is typically achieved in the warmer climate of Madeira.

Verdelho can also be found in Argentina, with at least one producer marketing a varietal called simply Verdelho.

In Spain Verdelho is grown under the synonym Verdello. (Not be confused with the Italian grape Verdello).

The grape has been successful in the vineyards of Australia, particularly the South Burnett wine region in Queensland, Hunter Valley, Langhorne Creek, Cowra and the Swan Valley. Australian versions of Verdelho are noted for their intense flavors with hints of lime and honeysuckle and the oily texture that the wines can get after some aging.

As one of the few heat-loving white grapes, Verdelho is well adapted to the California Sierra foothills. By the 1870s the grape was extensively grown in what is now Amador County. Currently Verdelho is grown in Amador and Solano counties, near Lodi, as well as one vineyard in Napa Valley. Approximately 200 acres in California are devoted to the grape. California Verdelho wines are noted for floral and citrus aromas.

==Viticulture==
Verdelho is a moderately vigorous vine that produces small bunches of small oval berries with a high skin to juice ratio. The skins of the berry can be thick and taste &quot;hard&quot; when eaten. The grapes ripen early but can be prone to powdery mildew. The vines can also be susceptible to frost during the spring.

==Confusion with other grapes==
Verdelho is often confused with Verdelho Tinto, a red grape also grown in Madeira. The grapes are related but still different, similar to how Pinot noir and Pinot gris are related (as crosses which exhibit new characteristics and become a new varietal and the originating grapes trackable in DNA as the &quot;parents&quot;). Verdelho is also confused with the similarly named Verdelho Feijão and the Gouveio of Portugal, the Italian grape Verduzzo and the Verdejo white grape grown in Spain.

<text>The Internet Stream Protocol (ST) is a family of experimental protocols first defined in Internet Experiment Note IEN-119 in 1979, and later substantially revised in RFC 1190 (ST-II) and RFC 1819 (ST2+).
The protocol uses the version number 5 in the version field of the Internet Protocol header, but was never known as IPv5. The successor to IPv4 was thus named IPv6 to eliminate any possible confusion about the actual protocol in use.

==History==
The Internet Stream Protocol family was never introduced for public use, but many of the concepts available in ST are similar to later Asynchronous Transfer Mode protocols and can be found in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). They also presaged voice over IP.

ST arose as the transport protocol of the Network Voice Protocol, a pioneering computer network protocol for transporting human speech over packetized communications networks, first implemented in December 1973 by Internet researcher Danny Cohen of the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) as part of ARPA&#x27;s Network Secure Communications (NSC) project.

First specified in 1979, ST was envisioned as a connection-oriented complement to IPv4, operating on the same level, but using a different header format from that used for IP datagrams. According to IEN-119, its concepts were formulated by Danny Cohen, Estil Hoversten, and James W. Forgie. The protocol was notable for introducing the concepts of packetized voice (as used by voice over IP), a talkspurt (a continuous segment of speech between silent intervals), and specified delay and drop-rate requirements for packet services. It was implemented in the Voice Funnel.

Its second version, known variously as ST-II or ST2, was drafted by Claudio Topolcic and others in 1987 and specified in 1990. It was implemented in the Terrestrial Wideband Network and its successor, the Defense Simulation Internet, where it was used extensively for distributed simulations and videoconferencing. This version later formed the core technology for transporting voice calls and other realtime streams within Canada&#x27;s Iris Digital Communications System. 

The final version of ST2, which was also known as ST2+, was drafted by the IETF ST2 Working group and published in 1995 as RFC 1819.
ST2 distinguishes its own packets with an Internet Protocol version number 5, although it was never known as IPv5.

ST uses the same IP address structure and the same link layer protocol number (ethertype 0x800) as IP.

In datagram mode, ST packets could be encapsulated with IP headers using protocol number 5.

<text>Boal (Galician-Asturian: &quot;Bual&quot;) is a municipality, a civil parish and a town in the Autonomous Community of the Principality of Asturias (Spain). It borders north with El Franco and Coaña, south with Illano, west with Castropol and east with Villayón.

The main way of access to the municipality is the regional road AS-12, which connects Navia with Grandas de Salime. The whole municipality has a population of 1,632 inhabitants, whereas there are about 496 inhabitants in the capital town.

==Etymology==
Etymologically, it is usually considered that &quot;Boal&quot; comes either from the Indo-european languages, *bod- (stream, ditch), or from the Latin, bove or *bovale (ox). Although some authors believe that &quot;Boal&quot; could be understood as the expression of an old anthroponym or person name, Bovali (iler) or Baudiliu (adducing the form Baudali), it is common to consider its original meaning either as &quot;terreno frecuentado y apropiado para el pasto del ganado vacuno&quot; (&quot;land frequented and appropriate for the grazing of cattle&quot;) or as &quot;corral de bueyes o dehesa boyal&quot; (&quot;corral for oxen or ox pasture&quot;). In fact, Corominas mentions in Aragonese &quot;boalage, boalar, &quot;dehesa boyal&quot;&quot; (&quot;ox pasture&quot;) as derivatives of &quot;boal&quot;, which would be at the same time a variant of &quot;boyal, &quot;perteneciente al buey o al ganado vacuno&quot;&quot; (&quot;belonging to ox or to cattle&quot;) .

==History==

===Ancient times===
There still remain traces proving the existence of settlements in this municipality in a time prior to the arrival of Romans. Although it is supposed that there were already populated enclaves in the area during the Paleolithic, there are no remains of this time, so such a supposition could not be demonstrated. Nevertheless, remains of the Neolithic have reached up to the present day. For example, several burial mounds were found in the mountain range of Penouta in what is one of the vastest burial mound fields in the whole Asturias, with 72 catalogued tombs. Likewise, dolmens near Llaviada (nowadays disappeared) are supposed to date from this time, together with the oscillating granitic mass known as Penedo Aballón (located near Penouta, and knocked down in 2004, probably by a few vandals).

From the Bronze Age (approximately 1500-1100 b.C) are believed to date the anthropomorphic paintings (both masculine and feminine) found in the Cova del Demo (&quot;Cave of Devil&quot; in English), located near the hamlet of Froseira, in the civil parish of Doiras.

All the preceding facts, together with the signals of mining work devoted to the extraction of metals and, especially the Celtic fortifications of Pendia, Los Mazos and La Escrita also prove the aforementioned pre-Roman settlements.
The subsequent Roman presence, after the conquest carried out by the legions under command of General Publio Carisio (the X Gemina and the V Alaudae), left imprints such as several coins and ceramics fragments, as well as probably the origin of the names of some small villages such as Vega de Ouria, likely due to the presence of some river gold working in that time. In those days, it is believed that the area corresponding to the civil parish of Castrillón was populated by the astur tribe of Pesicos, whereas the area located western from the Navia River would have been inhabited by the gallaeci tribe of Albions.

After about four centuries of Roman domination, the barbarians entered the Iberian Peninsula, and Suebi settled down in the western area of Asturias, reaching their maximum expansion about the year 450. It is known that later arrived Visigoths, that occupied the whole territory about 584. However, there are very little archaeological remains of all those populations.

===Middle Ages===
Little is known about the history of Boal at the beginning of the Middle Ages, during the asturian monarchy. The fights between the bishops of Oviedo and Lugo for the territories located between the rivers Navia and Eo came to an end by means of an agreement promoted by the king Alfonso VII. Thus, all those territories and Boal included among them were submitted to the bishop of Oviedo by donation in the year 1154, under the generic denomination of territory of Castropol.

In 1368, the bishop D. Gutierre, appointed Alvar Pérez Osorio as &quot;governor&quot; of the Tierra de Ribadeo y Grandas, which comprised the current municipalities of Boal, Castropol, Coaña, El Franco, Grandas de Salime, Illano, Pesoz, San Martín de Oscos, Santa Eulalia de Oscos, Tapia, Taramundi and Vegadeo, having up to 41 parishes. This was a time of many violent uprisings because of the high taxes Pérez Osorio obliged the inhabitants of the area to pay.

Subsequently, bishops created several villages and municipalities, so at the beginning of the 16th century, the Tierra de Ribadeo was divided into five municipalities: Castropol, Piantón, Barres, El Franco and Grandas, with Boal belonging to the municipality of El Franco.

===Modern Ages===
This system of municipalities was in force until the arrival of King Felipe II, who obtained permission from Pope Gregory XIII to divide and sell any town, place and jurisdiction, which allowed him to obtain financing for wars and to pay the great debt he had. There were attempts of buying jurisdictions by some individuals (with the intention to advance in the social scale), but the most usual was the buying by the people.

This favored that in those years Boal disassociated from the Church. In 1579, Alonso López de Navia y Bolaño, an inhabitant of the town of Navia, gave power to Pedro Bermúdez to arrange with Alonso de Camino, who initially registered the parishes of Serandinas, Boal, Doiras, Pesoz, Coaña, Trelles, Villacondide, etc., expecting to buy them, for shortly after transferring the parishes of Boal, Serandinas and Doiras to Rui Garcia de Cangas in order to reduce expenses.

The fears of the people of villages to depend on the lords, considering the abuses they committed against their inhabitants, led them to &quot;buy themselves&quot; and to incorporate into the Crown. Thus, the parishes of Boal, Serandinas and Doiras were redeemed in 1580, starting to have the jurisdictional status of &quot;realengo&quot; (directly depending on the King).

The definitive independence of Boal as a municipality took place in 1584, when representatives of the inhabitants of its parishes met, drawing up the first local regulations and agreeing on the way to choose the offices of town councilors, mayor, constables, attorneys, etc. Thus, parishes became towns with civil and criminal jurisdiction, and representatives would meet once a year to choose the aforementioned offices. At this time, the capital of the municipality changed and it was held in several of its villages (Prelo, Armal, Castrillón, and the town of Boal), but it definitely returned to Boal in 1791.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, in which the clearly predominant activities in Boal were agriculture and cattle farming, beautiful family seats and palaces were built in the municipality, but at present most of them are almost completely disappeared, although with some exceptions such as the Palace of Miranda, in the village of Prelo. There is no doubt that the 18th century was the most prosperous for the municipality because, in addition to the fundamental farming activities, the craftwork industries became noticeably important too, and by the middle of this century there were 4 fulling mills, 8 mallets to stretch iron, one forge, and 42 mills for grain.

===19th century===
It is also known that during the Spanish War of Independence the French troops occupied Boal in the belief that the town hosted a weapons factory. A group of inhabitants of Boal took part in the &quot;Alarma del cerezal&quot; (a group of people who met to avoid an invasion or to defend from the enemy), but they could not avoid Maurice Mathieu’s soldiers to invade the town on March 19, 1809, establishing a camp in Llaviada, and causing numerous deaths, plundering and damages.

A few years later, in 1814 and 1820, Serandinas unsuccessfully tried to become a municipality independent of Boal. Furthermore, in July 1823 noticeable damages were caused by a group of about 24 robbers commanded by Miguel Álvarez Samartino de la Trapa, who stole money from the taxes income and tore documents of the municipal secretary’s office. It is believed that two inhabitants of Armal could have taken part in these happenings, but they could not be captured as people in their village would have covered them up.

During the Carlist Wars the municipality was invaded again: in 1836, a guerrilla group commanded by San Breixo entered in Boal, but he was captured in the following year and subsequently executed by firing squad in the cemetery of Piantón by a militia formed in Boal. Shortly after, in 1837, it was inaugurated the parish church devoted to Santiago Apóstol, and in 1842, the town hall and the jail.

The cholera epidemic of 1854 and 1855, took place in this municipality, although it was not excessively virulent. That was not the case with the smallpox epidemic of 1870, much more serious and deadly.

Also in the 19th century, Boal saw the birth of one of its most distinguished figures, Bernardo Acevedo y Huelves, whose name was later given to the municipal library. Among his works it is worth highlighting &quot;Boal y su concejo&quot; (&quot;Boal and its municipality&quot;), a very clarifying picture of the way of life and the customs in the municipality at the end of the 19th century, which also shows the importance the industry of iron forge (at present disappeared) had by that time.

In connection with this, it is worth mentioning the uprising that took place in 1895, in which the forgers of the municipality destroyed all the machines for making tacks that Víctor Sánchez, a local businessman, was installing in the village of Armal with the aim to start a strong tacking industry able to face the great external competition, especially that English one, which finally made unfeasible the traditional means of working iron in the municipality.

===20th century===
The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th were years of important migratory flows, especially to the Americas. From these years date several large houses, property of emigrants who had made fortune in the Americas, such as for example Villa Anita. In addition, the money furnished by many emigrants contributed decisively to the construction of various schools in several villages of the municipality and the elementary school of the capital town, known as &quot;Las Graduadas&quot;, in 1934, which was promoted by the &quot;Sociedad de Instrucción Naturales del Concejo de Boal&quot; (&quot;Association for the Education Natives of the Municipality of Boal&quot;) in La Habana (Cuba). Also in these years several public washing houses were built in the municipality.

Some other infrastructures of capital relevance for Boal were built at the beginning of the 20th century. That was the case of the road connecting Navia and Grandas de Salime, with the construction of the stretch from Navia to Boal. Furthermore, in 1934 it was built the dam of Doiras, and in the year 1951 it was started the large-scale exploitation of the tungsten mines near Penouta, although they closed in 1961.

The decadence of tungsten mining, which had employed up to 254 workers, and the end of the construction of the big reservoirs along the Navia River, together with the gradual abandonment of cattle farming (still at present the main economic activity of the municipality) led to new migratory flows, especially from the 1950s on, but in this case they were directed preferentially to other regions of Spain (the industrialized center of Asturias, Madrid, etc.) or to Europe (Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, etc.), giving rise to a progressive depopulation that still continues at present.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
Being located in the middle basin of the Navia River, the municipality of Boal is crossed by that river from south/south-east to north-east, where its course acts as a natural border with the neighboring municipality of Villayón. On its way through this municipality, the Navia River is dammed first in Doiras, and later, downstream, by that of Arbón, already located in Villayón. Two noticeable tributaries pouring their water on the Navia River in the municipality of Boal are the Urubio River (in the reservoir of Doiras) and the Pendia River (in the reservoir of Arbón).

The main elevation of the terrain is located already bordering with the municipalities of Illano and Castropol: it is the range of La Bobia, of 1,201 m above sea level. It is also worth mentioning La Cristaleira (1,036 m) in the southern area of the municipality, Pena Queimada (921 m) in the north-western area, Penouta (899 m) in the northern zone (from there it is possible to see a wide panoramic view of the coast from the municipality of Navia to the environs of Foz, in the province of Lugo) and Penácaros (732 m) in the central area. The capital town of the municipality is located relatively far away from the main valley of the Navia River, in the headwaters of the Pendia River and surrounded by the three aforementioned mountains, at about 450 m above sea level.

===Civil parishes===
The municipality of Boal is divided in 7 civil parishes:
*Boal (in Eonavian: &quot;Bual&quot;): 966 inhabitants.
*Castrillón (in Eonavian: &quot;Castriyón&quot;): 182 inhabitants.
*Doiras: 153 inhabitants.
*Lebredo (in Eonavian: &quot;Llebredo&quot;): 13 inhabitants.
*La Ronda (in Eonavian: &quot;A Ronda&quot;): 63 inhabitants.
*Rozadas: 176 inhabitants.
*Serandinas (in Eonavian: &quot;Serandías&quot;): 223 inhabitants.
===Main populated places===
*Boal: 526 inhabitants.
*Armal: 154 inhabitants.
*Doiras: 98 inhabitants.
*Miñagón: 94 inhabitants.
*Rozadas: 79 inhabitants.
*Serandinas: 69 inhabitants.
*Prelo: 61 inhabitants.
*Los Mazos: 49 inhabitants.
*Sampol: 41 inhabitants.
*Castrillón: 39 inhabitants.
===The parish of Boal===

The parish of Boal is in size with a population of 1,137 (INE 2007).

The town of Boal is the head of this civil parish and also the capital of the homonymous municipality. It is located in the south-eastern mountainside of the Penouta range near the headwaters of the Pendia River, at about 450 m above sea level. It has a population of 588 inhabitants, being they distributed among the three main districts which the town consists of:

*Boal de Arriba (Upper Boal): this is the historical nucleus of the village, with narrow streets (Alonso Rodríguez Street and Buenos Aires Avenue) where the older houses are located, together with the fairground that hosts the cattle market, and the cemetery.
*Zona central (Central area): includes the &quot;Plaza de la Iglesia&quot; (Church Square), where the parish church devoted to Santiago Apóstol is located, the &quot;Plaza del Ayuntamiento&quot; (Town Hall Square) and the Asturias Avenue, where the &quot;Casa de Cultura&quot; (House of Culture) that hosts the municipal library, and most of the shops and bars, restaurants and hotels are located. This area includes also the Everardo Villamil Street and the Republic of Cuba Avenue.
*Boal de Abajo (Lower Boal): it has grown along the AS-12 road (Melquiades Álvarez Street and Isidoro Fontana Street) and the Rosalía de la Cruz Street, hosting some interesting examples of the architecture of those emigrants who had made fortune in the Americas, among which we can stress the Casa de Damiana (1919) and, already on the road out of the village in direction to Grandas de Salime, Villa Anita (1926), decorated with glazed tiles in all its façades. Moreover, the elementary school (Escuelas Graduadas, nowadays called Centro Público de Educación Básica Carlos Bousoño) and the high school, together with the municipal sports center and pool are located in this area.

====Villages of the parish of Boal====
==Demography==

During the first decades of the 19th century, the municipality of Boal kept a slow increase of population that was noticeably accelerated with the construction of the dam of Doiras in 1930, reaching in that year its historical maximum of 7,365 inhabitants. The relatively high levels of population remained until 1960, not just because of the dam but also because of the tungsten mining near Penouta and because of the existence of traditional agriculture requiring a lot of labor. Thanks to all these factors, the municipality of Boal could be once the most populous one in the middle course of the Navia River. Nevertheless, from 1960 on and due to the closing of mines and to the changes experienced by the traditional agriculture, a very important migratory flow started.

Emigration has marked the municipality in different ways. By the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th one, the migratory flow went overseas, to the Americas, especially to Argentina and Cuba, from where emigrants kept their influence in the municipality. Proof of that is the very important money transferences they made and which allowed the construction of different buildings, as well as their promoting of the education of the remaining youth in Boal. All this flow of money was interrupted by the Cuban Revolution.

By the middle of the 20th century emigration started again and strongly, but this time it was directed to different destinations: to the centre of Europe, France, Germany, and also to the main industrial towns and cities of Asturias, especially Gijón and Avilés, etc.

All these facts have brought a dramatic change in the demographic figure of the municipality, to the point that, as it can be observed from its representation, at present people over 60 years old constitute up to 42,7% of the total population, whereas people below 20 years old represent just as low as 8,4%.


==Economy==
Although the percentage of workers is clearly a majority in the service sector (see table), its weight is quite lower than the regional mean, and it is not crazy to state that still at present, economy in Boal is based to a large extent on cattle farming, which employs almost one third of the working population, and is mainly destined to milk production, being Boal the main producer among the western municipalities in Asturias.

In recent years apiculture has experienced a noticeable growth, becoming honey one of the most typical products in the municipality. In spite of this, this activity is usually in a secondary place, constituting an extra-earnings source for many families, but not the main one. Nevertheless, as a proof of the importance of apiculture for the municipality, it is worth mentioning the famous Feria de la Miel (Honey Fair). Moreover, a few years ago it started working the company Boal Apícola, which markets about 20 tons of honey a year.

==Politics==
The political party that has been ruling during more time in the municipality of Boal since 1979 has been the PSOE. The current mayor is the socialist José Antonio Barrientos, who is in his office since 1999, having been re-elected three times.

==Gastronomy==
In this mainly agricultural and farming municipality we can taste infinity of natural products, among which it is worth mentioning its excellent vegetables, beans and the great quality potatoes. Thus, Boal’s traditional cooking makes use of all those resources to have among its most typical dishes the stock with &quot;cimois&quot; (rapini) or collard greens.

Being this municipality rich in meat, such as veal, pork, kid, lamb and mutton, etc., it is not surprising other dishes such as the meat or sausages pie, the lacón with rapini and &quot;cachelos&quot; (pieces of cooked potato) or the corn &quot;rapa&quot; (similar to a pie but using corn and bacon) have a prominent place too. Game constitutes another important chapter in Boal’s cooking, being frequent pieces such as roe deer and wild boar, apart from partridge, Eurasian woodcock and hare.

Regarding sweets and pastry, it is worth mentioning &quot;cocadas&quot;, &quot;venera&quot; (a kind of almond-based marzipan) and &quot;cereixolos&quot;. Moreover, honey has a huge variety of applications on the local cooking, which is not surprising taking into account that it is a typical product in the municipality having widely recognized quality. And, of course, it is possible in Boal to enjoy the rest of asturian typical dishes.

==Tourism==
Its most ancient signs are the cave paintings in the Cova del Demo. They are male, female and zoomorphic paintings. We can also find different architectural examples: palaces, large houses and churches, among which it is worth mentioning the following:

*The Miranda Palace in Prelo, built during the 15th and 16th centuries and declared &quot;well of cultural interest&quot; in 1982. At first it consisted in a square tower with three floors that was subsequently extended. It had small openings that were later enlarged. The main body of the palace has two floors in the back side and one floor in the front side, due to the unevenness of the terrain. Above the entrance door it is placed a big coat of arms belonging to the family González de Prelo y Castrillón. Between the tower and the chapel there is an extra body, with corridors supported by stone columns. The chapel dates from 1776, having rectangle floor with two loopholes in both wings, and two Rococo-inspired altarpieces painted in black and white. The wooden sculptures from the 17th and 18th centuries were removed because of the bad situation of the ceiling.
*The Berdín Palace in Doiras, from the 18th century, which attracts the attention because of its great size and its walls without any kind of decoration. It is constructed with masonry, with blocks of stone. Its floor has a U shape, and in the façade of the central courtyard there is a gallery above monolithic columns.

*The Palace of Armal, with the typical structure of the rural large houses: rectangular floor, built with masonry and slate, and having very little decoration.
*Villa Anita: it was built in 1926 by an emigrant to Cuba. It is a villa with a T-shaped floor, with three floors, in which English influences can be observed, together with Japanese ones and others from the Middle Ages. The façade is decorated with white ceramics (glazed tiles from Talavera) on its wings, having the main façade plant patterns. There is a glazed balcony on the first floor. The roof has two wings and it is covered with slate, and over the eaves it has some wooden decoration made of cut borders. The inside is as rich and well-preserved as the outside.
*Villa Damiana, built in 1919, is also a wonderful example of the historically-inspired architecture.
*Old Elementary School &quot;Escuelas Graduadas&quot; in Boal: this school was built between 1930 and 1934, promoted as other public works in the municipality by the &quot;Sociedad de Instrucción Naturales del Concejo de Boal&quot;, founded in La Habana, Cuba (this was due to the high number of emigrants from Boal who had gone to that country in search of fortune) although it had also money contribution from the state and from emigrants in Buenos Aires. It is a great building constructed with stone, with large windows and two entrances framed by big porchs, because boys entered by one wing whereas girls entered by the opposite one. All the roofs have big wooden eaves.
*The Church of Santiago Apóstol in Boal, built between 1831 and 1837, with a Latin cross-shaped floor and a lateral porch built of granitic blocks of stone.
*The public Washing House in Boal, built thanks to the money sent by emigrants to the Americas and inaugurated in 1928. It has been recently restored and transformed into the Center for the Interpretation of the Washing Houses in the municipality of Boal. The building exhibits an important constructive wealth with a functional style, having mouldings and pinnacles, and it is a good example of the charitable anxiety for their native villages and for the poorest people of the returning emigrants.
* Casa de la Apicultura is an apiculture museum.

The municipality of Boal hosts a great number of festivities and fairs. Among the most important ones we can stress the following:

*On July 24, 25 and 26: the feast in honor of Santiago Apóstol, in Boal. On July 21 and 22, the feast in honor of the Virgen de la Magdalena in Doiras.
*On August 25: the feast in honor of San Luis in the homonym village.
*In October/November: the Feria de la Miel (Honey Fair) at the last weekend of October or the first one of November.
It is also worth mentioning the fortnightly market that takes place in Boal, hosted on every alternate Mondays. In addition, there are also several cattle markets during the year. Two of them are hosted in the fairground of Boal on the second Saturday of October and on the last one of April, and other two are hosted in the La Bobia range: on May 29, that of San Fernando and on June 26 that of San Pelayo.

<text>Niesobia, is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several old szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
This coat of arms has its origins in Moravia, in what is today Czech Republic, along with the 45 noble families that bore this coat of arms. The earliest written document mentioning the Niesobia coat of arms dates back to 1424. Some of the families bearing this coat of arms later became incorporated into the Russian nobility.

==Blazon==
A shield crossed in red and gold, on which is a silver arrow with a black eagle&#x27;s tail at the end; in the crest are three ostrich feathers on top of the helmet.

<doc id="1077884" wikidata="Q57535" url="?curid=1077884" title="Sebastian Haffner">
<text>Raimund Pretzel (27 December 1907 – 2 January 1999), better known by his pseudonym Sebastian Haffner, was a German journalist and historian. As an émigré in Britain during World War II, Haffner argued that accommodation was impossible not only with Adolf Hitler but also with the German &quot;Reich&quot; with which Hitler had gambled. Peace could be secured only by rolling back &quot;seventy-five years of German history&quot; and restoring Germany to a network of smaller states.

As a journalist in West Germany, Haffner&#x27;s conscious effort &quot;to dramatize, to push differences to the top&quot;, precipitated breaks with editors both liberal and conservative. His intervention in the Spiegel affair of 1962, and his contributions to the anti-fascist rhetoric of the student New Left, sharply raised his profile.

After parting ways with &quot;Stern&quot; magazine in 1975, Haffner produced widely read studies focussed on what he saw as fateful continuities in the history of the German Reich (1871–1945). His posthumously published pre-war memoir, &quot;Geschichte eines Deutschen: Die Erinnerungen 1914–1933&quot; (&quot;History of a German&quot;, published in English as &quot;Defying Hitler: A Memoir&quot;) (2003) won him new readers in Germany and abroad.

==Early life==
===School years===
Haffner was born in 1907 as Raimund Pretzel in Berlin. During war years, 1914–18, he attended the primary school (&quot;Volkschule&quot;) of which his father Carl Pretzel was the principal. Of these years he recalls not the privations, but the army bulletins read with the excitement of a football fan following match scores. Haffner believed that it was from this experience of war by a generation of schoolboys as a &quot;game between nations&quot;, more enthralling and emotionally satisfying than anything peace could offer, that Nazism was to draw much of its &quot;allure&quot;: &quot;its simplicity, its appeal to the imagination, and its zest action; but also its intolerance and its cruelty towards internal opponents&quot;.

After the war Haffner attended first a city-centre grammar school, the Königstädtisches Gymnasium Berlin in Alexanderplatz. Here he befriended children of the city&#x27;s leading Jewish families in business and the liberal professions. They were precocious, cultivated and left-leaning. His adolescent politics, however, took a turn rightward after he moved, in 1924, to the Schillergymnasium in Lichterfelde heavily subscribed to by families in the military. Haffner was later to remark that: &quot;My whole life has been determined by my experiences in these two schools&quot;.

===Hitler and exile===
After January 1933, Haffner witnessed as a law student the deployment of the SA as an &quot;auxiliary police force&quot; and, after the March Reichstag fire, their hounding of Jewish and democratic jurists from the courts. What shocked him most in these events was the complete absence of &quot;any act of courage or spirit&quot;. In the face of Hitler&#x27;s ascent it seemed as if &quot;a million individuals simultaneously suffered a nervous collapse&quot;. There was disbelief, but no resistance.

Doctoral research allowed Haffner to take refuge in Paris, but unable to gain a foothold in the city he returned to Berlin in 1934. Having already published some shorter fiction as a serial novelist for the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot;, he was able to make a living writing &quot;feuilletons&quot; for style magazines where &quot;a certain cultural aesthetic exclusivity was tolerated&quot; by the Nazis. But the tightening of political controls and, more immediately, the pregnancy of his journalist girlfriend, classed as Jewish under the Nuremberg Laws, urged emigration. In 1938 Erika Schmidt-Landry (née Hirsch) (1899-1969) was able to join a brother in England, and Haffner, on a commission from the Ullstein Press, was able to follow her. They married weeks before the birth of their son Oliver Pretzel.

Britain&#x27;s declaration of war against Germany on 3 September 1939 saved Haffner from deportation. As enemy aliens Haffner and his wife were interned, but in August 1940 they were among the first to be released from camps on the Isle of Man. In June, George Orwell&#x27;s publisher Fredric Warburg had released &quot;Germany, Jekyll and Hyde&quot;, Haffner&#x27;s first work in English and the first for which, to protect his family in Germany, he used the names he was to retain: Sebastian (from Johann Sebastian Bach) and Haffner (from Mozart&#x27;s Haffner Symphony). In the House of Commons questions had been asked as to why the author of so important a book was being detained. Lord Vansittart described Haffner&#x27;s analysis of &quot;Hitlerism and the German problem&quot; as &quot;the most important [...] that has yet appeared&quot;.

==Political émigré==
===&quot;Germany: Jekyll and Hyde&quot;===
In a polemic that rehearsed the themes of his later historical work, Haffner argued that Britain was naïve in declaring its &quot;quarrel&quot; to be with Hitler only and not with the German people. Hitler had &quot;gained more adherents in Germany and come nearer to absolute power than anyone before him&quot;, and had done so by &quot;more or less normal means of persuasion and attraction.&quot; This did not mean that &quot;Hitler is Germany&quot;, but it was rash to assume that beneath Germany&#x27;s vaunted unity there existed nothing but &quot;discontent, secret opposition and repressed decency&quot;.

Germans had entered the war divided. Less than one in five were true devotees, the &quot;real Nazis&quot;. No consideration, not even the &quot;Bolshevik menace&quot;, could reconcile this &quot;morally inaccessible&quot; section of the New Germany to a stable Europe. The anti-Semitism that is their &quot;badge&quot; had outrun its original motive: the venting of Hitler&#x27;s private resentments, the scapegoating of a minority as a safety valve for anti-capitalist sentiment. It functions rather as &quot;a means of selection and trial&quot;, identifying those who are prepared, without pretext, to persecute, hunt and murder and thus be bound to the Leader by &quot;the iron chains of a common crime&quot;. Hitler, in turn, (a &quot;potential suicide &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;) recognises only devotion to his own person.

A greater number of Germans—perhaps four in ten—wish only to see the back of Hitler and the Nazis. But &quot;unorganised, dispirited and often in despair&quot;, very few identified with the submerged political opposition, itself divided and confused. Side-by-side they live with a roughly equal number of Germans who, dreading a further Versailles, bear &quot;the surrender of personality, religion and private life&quot; under Hitler as a &quot;patriotic sacrifice&quot;. Through their generals, these Reich loyalists might eventually seek terms with the Allies, but Haffner urged caution. Anything less than a decisive break with the &quot;status quo ante&quot; would merely return to &quot;a latent and passive state&quot; the Reich&#x27;s animating spirit of aggrandisement and &quot;vulgar worship of force&quot;.

For there to be security in Europe, Haffner insisted (in original italics) that &quot;[The] &quot;German Reich must disappear, and the last seventy-five years of Germany history must be erased. The Germans must retrace their steps to the point where they took the wrong path--to the year 1866&quot; (the year when, on the battlefield of Königgrätz, Prussia removed Austrian protection from the smaller German states). Articulating a thesis he was to defend at length in his last (dictated) work, &quot;Von Bismarck zu Hitler&quot; (1987), Haffner maintained that &quot;No peace is conceivable with the Prussian Reich which was born at that time, and whose last logical expression is no other than Nazi Germany&quot;&quot;. Germany should be returned to an historical pattern of regional states bound by confederal arrangements that are European and not exclusively national.

At the same time, Haffner admitted that part of the attraction for Germans would be that, repurposed as Bavarians, Rhinelanders and Saxons, they might escape Allied retribution. &quot;We cannot&quot;, he reasoned, &quot;both get rid of the German Reich and, identifying its &#x27;Succession States&#x27;, punish them for its sins&quot;. If the Allies wished the Reich mentality to die--&quot;of which there was every possibility after the catastrophe of Nazism&quot;—then the new states had to be given &quot;a fair chance&quot;.

===Churchill===
There was a story that Churchill ordered every member of his war cabinet to read Haffner&#x27;s book. If true, the regard would have been mutual. Of all his subsequent works, Haffner was to say that his short biography, &quot;Winston Churchill&quot; (1967), was his favourite. When in 1965 Churchill died, Sebastian Haffner wrote &quot;it seemed as if not a mere mortal was buried, but English history itself&quot;.

Yet Haffner was disappointed that Churchill did not take up his ideas for a German Freedom Legion, a German academy in exile and a German committee. The Prime Minister was prepared to use anti-Nazi Germans as advisors, technical experts and agents in the special forces, but there was to be no London equivalent of the Moscow-based &quot;National Committee for a Free Germany&quot;. Neal Ascherson nonetheless believes it possible that some of Churchill&#x27;s ideas about post-war Germany had &quot;roots in sections of Haffner&#x27;s book&quot;.

==Post-war journalism==
===Germany&#x27;s division===
In 1941 David Astor invited Haffner to join &quot;The Observer&quot; as political correspondent, while Edward Hulton recruited him as contributor to the popular &quot;Picture Post&quot;. &quot;The Observer&#x27;s&quot; foreign editor and an influential opinion former in England, in 1948 Haffner became a naturalised British citizen. Through the so-called Shanghai Club (named after a restaurant in Soho), he associated with left-leaning and emigre journalists, among them E. H. Carr, George Orwell, Isaac Deutscher, Barbara Ward and Jon Kimche

On his return from war service, David Astor took a more active part in editorial matters, and there were clashes of opinion. Following a McCarthy-era trip to the United States, Haffner had soured on the North Atlantic alliance, and (with Paul Sethe of ) he was unwilling to dismiss as bluff the March 1952 Stalin Note with its offer of Soviet withdrawal in return for German neutrality. In 1954 he accepted a financially generous offer to transfer to Berlin as &quot;The Observer&#x27;s&quot; German correspondent.

In Germany, Haffner also wrote for the conservative national &quot;Die Welt,&quot; then edited by the Kapp Putsch veteran, Hans Zehrer. The publisher Axel Springer permitted discussion of neutrality (the &quot;Austrian solution &quot;) as the basis for a final German settlement, a prospect not definitively dismissed until the construction in September 1961 of the Berlin Wall. Haffner joined Springer in railing against the ineffectiveness of the western allied response to the sealing of the Soviet Bloc in Germany, a stance that occasioned his final break with Astor and &quot;The Observer&quot;.

Consistent with his post-Reich vision of 1940, Haffner was not, in principle, opposed to the existence of a second German state. In 1960 he had speculated on the future of the GDR as a &quot;Prussian Free State&quot; giving play, perhaps, to the National Bolshevist ideas of Ernst Niekisch. After the consolidation of the wall, and in a break with Axel Springer, Haffner was to see no alternative but to formally recognise a Soviet-Bloc East Germany. From 1969 he supported the &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; of the new Social-Democratic Chancellor, Willy Brandt.

===The Spiegel affair===

On 26 October 1962, the Hamburg offices of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; were raided and closed by police. The publisher, Rudolf Augstein, along with the weekly&#x27;s two editors-in-chief and a reporter were arrested. Defence minister Franz Josef Strauss levelled accusations of treason (&quot;Landesverrat&quot;) in respect of an article detailing a NATO projection of &quot;imaginable chaos&quot; in the event of a Soviet nuclear strike and criticising the Government&#x27;s lack of preparedness. In a statement he was later obliged to recant, Strauss denied himself initiating the police action.

Springer offered its presses, teletypes and office space so &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; could keep on publishing. But it was at the cost of any further access to Die Welt that Haffner, in the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; (8 November 1962), pronounced on the violation of press freedom and constitutional norms. Invoking the spectre of the republican collapse in 1933, Haffner argued that German democracy was in the balance. Identified with what was to be seen a key turning point in the culture of the Federal Republic away from deference demanded by the old &quot;Obrigkeitsstaat&quot; (authoritarian state) Haffner found a new, and more liberal, readership with the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,&quot; and with the weeklies &quot;Die Zeit&quot; and &quot;Stern&quot; magazine.

===Student protest and anti-Springer campaign===
Together with young writers and activists of a new post-war generation, Haffner believed that the Federal Republic was paying a price for Adenauer&#x27;s pragmatic refusal to press for an accounting of Nazi-era crimes. With implicit reference to these, in &quot;Stern&quot; Haffner denounced as &quot;a systematic, cold-blooded, planned pogrom&quot; a police riot in West Berlin in which a student protester, Benno Ohnesorg, was shot dead.

On June 2, 1967, rallied by Ulrike Meinhof&#x27;s exposure in the New Left journal &quot;konkret&quot; of German complicity in the Pahlavi dictatorship, students had demonstrated against the visit of the Shah of Iran. When Iranian counter-demonstrators, including agents of the Shah&#x27;s intelligence service, attacked the students, the police joined the affray beating the students into side street where an officer fired his side arm. Contributing himself to &quot;konkret&quot; (later revealed to have been subsidised by the East Germans) Haffner wrote that &quot;with the Student pogrom of 2 June 1967 fascism in West Berlin had thrown off its mask&quot;.

Increasingly focussed on the war in Vietnam (&quot;the Auschwitz of the young generation&quot;), many, including Haffner&#x27;s daughter Sarah, directed their anger at his former employer, Axel Springer. After the attempted assassination of the socialist student leader Rudi Dutschke on April 11, 1968, Springer titles (&quot;Bild&quot; : “Students threaten: We shoot back&quot;, &quot;Stop the terror of the Young Reds-Now!&quot;) were again accused of incitement. The &quot;Morgenpost&quot; responded to a protest blockade of its presses by itself proposing parallels to &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;: &quot;back then the Jews were robbed of their property; today it is the Springer concern that is threatened&quot;.

===Ulrike Meinhof===
Haffner&#x27;s contribution to this pushing of &quot;differences to the top&quot; (&quot;Zuspitzung&quot;) was not appreciated by Brandt&#x27;s Social Democrats or by &quot;Stern&quot;, and especially not after Meinhof took what she regarded as a next logical step in a struggle with &quot;fascism&quot;. &quot;Protest&quot;, she wrote, &quot;is when I say I don’t like this. Resistance is when I put an end to what I don’t like.” On 19 May 1972, the Red Army Faction (the &quot;Baader Meinhof Gang&quot;) bombed Springer&#x27;s Hamburg headquarters injuring 17 people. A week before they had claimed their first victim, an American officer killed by a pipe-bomb at U.S. military headquarters in Frankfurt am Main.

Like the novelists Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass, Haffner did not resist the temptation, in placing Meinhof&#x27;s deeds in perspective, of a further swipe at Bild; &quot;no one&quot;, he argued, had done more to plant &quot;the seeds of violence&quot; than Springer journalism. Yet Haffner expressed dismay at the number of people on the left he believed might, if asked, offer a fugitive Ulrike a bed for the night and breakfast. Nothing, he warned, could serve to discredit the left and a commitment to reform more than romanticising terrorism.

===Celebrating the new liberalism===
Haffner did not agree with the stringency of some of the security measures endorsed by the Brandt government. He objected to the 1972 &quot;Radikalenerlass&quot; (Anti-Radical Decree) that instituted a &quot;Berufsverbot&quot; barring certain public-sector occupations to persons with &quot;extreme&quot; political views. Marxists, he argued, must be able to be teachers and university professors &quot;not because they are liberals, but because we are liberals&quot; (&quot;Stern,&quot; 12 March 1972). However, Haffner no longer referred to police &quot;pogroms&quot; or to regime neo-fascism. In the 1960s the police may have beaten demonstrators on the streets, but no one, he countered, ever &quot;heard of them having tortured them&quot;.

West Germany had changed. It may not have done enough to come to terms with the history of the Reich, but it had, in Haffner&#x27;s view, &quot;distanced itself from it with a light-footedness that no one had expected&quot;. The old authoritarianism, the sense of being a &quot;subject&quot; of the state, was &quot;passé&quot;. The atmosphere had become &quot;more liberal, more tolerant&quot;. Out of a nationalist, militaristic &quot;Volk&quot; there had emerged a comparatively modest, cosmopolitan (&quot;weltbürgerlich&quot;) public.

Yet for some of Haffner&#x27;s readers, there was to be a further, and &quot;absurd&quot;, &quot;volte face&quot;.

===&quot;Hands off&quot; Franco&#x27;s Spain===
In October 1975, the editorial board of &quot;Stern&quot; refused a submission from Haffner on the grounds that it violated the magazine&#x27;s commitment to a &quot;democratic constitutional order and to progressive-liberal principles&quot;.

In what was to prove its last use of capital punishment, on 27 September 1975 (just two months before Franco&#x27;s death) Spain executed two members of the armed Basque separatist group ETA and three members of the Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front (FRAP) for the murder of policemen and civil guards. Not only did Haffner refuse to join the general international condemnation, he appeared positively to defend the Spanish dictatorship. In a piece provocatively titled &quot;Hands off Spain&quot;, he argued that Spain had not done badly in its thirty-six years under Franco. There may not have been political freedom, but there had been economic modernisation and progress.

To many it appeared that Haffner had overplayed his reputation as a &quot;provocateur&quot;, an &quot;enfant terrible&quot;. His readership was reportedly falling: he had already dropped from the Allensbach Institute&#x27;s list of leading West-German journalists.

Haffner allowed that he may have been moving right while &quot;Stern&quot; was moving left. In his last piece in &quot;Stern&quot; in October 1975, Haffner maintained he had no regrets in supporting Brandt&#x27;s Ostpolitik or the regime change from Christian Democrat to Social Democrat. These had been &quot;necessary&quot;. But he confessed to some disillusionment. The relaxation of Cold-War tensions had brought little in its wake (the GDR, if anything, had hardened &quot;since we have been nice to them&quot;) and internally the BRD, the Federal Republic, had seen better times.

==From Bismarck to Hitler==
At age 68 Haffner decided to devote himself to his popular commentaries on German history. Already some of his serialisations in &quot;Stern&quot; had been worked into best sellers. &quot;Die verratene Revolution&quot; (1968), Haffners indictment of Social Democrats in the collapse of 1918 as Reich loyalists, ran into thirteen editions. Like all his work, it remained without footnotes, written for a popular audience (Haffner claimed to hate books you couldn&#x27;t take to bed). &quot;Anmerkungen zu Hitler&quot; (1978) (published in English as &quot;The Meaning of Hitler&quot;) sold a million copies. (Golo Mann called it a &quot;witty, original and clarifying book... excellently suited for discussion in the upper classes of schools&quot;) Enlarging on his wartime &quot;psychogram of the Führer&quot; in &quot;Germany: Jekyll and Hyde&quot;, the book placed Hitler in the shadow of the revolution Ebert and Noske betrayed.

Hitler, Haffner conceded, was no Prussian. Prussia had been &quot;a state based on law&quot;, and its nationality policies had always &quot;displayed noble toleration and indifference&quot;. But summarised in Haffner&#x27;s final book, &quot;Von Bismarck zu Hitler&quot; (1987), the broader thesis remained. Through the &quot;revolutions&quot; of 1918 and of 1933, the Prussian-created Reich had endured with the same animating conviction. Born partly out of its geo-political exposure, it was that the Reich would either be a great power or collapse. Given their experience of this Reich, Haffner was confident that Germany&#x27;s neighbours never would allow a successor: &quot;alarm bells would go off if a new 80-million-strong power bloc were to rise up again at their borders.”

==Death and family==
In 1989/90, as Gorbachev scrambled his calculations and the Wall fell, Haffner reportedly feared that the Germans had been tempered less by the traumas of 1945the lessons of which he had tried to draw outthan by consequences of their country&#x27;s division. He was unsure whether the Germans might not again be gripped by national megalomania. According to his daughter Sarah, the peaceful course of unification pleased him but, perhaps, made him feel more keenly that he had outlived his time. Haffner died on January 2, 1999, at the age of 91.

Christa Rotzoll, a journalist whom Haffner had married after he had been widowed in 1969, predeceased him in 1995. Haffner was survived by his two children with Erika Schmidt-Landry. Sarah Haffner (1940–2018) was a painter and a feminist documentary-film maker. She believed that her own political involvement may have played some part in her father&#x27;s engagement with the student movement in the 1960s. His son, Oliver Pretzel (1938- ), was Professor of Mathematics at Imperial College London. After his father&#x27;s death he collated the memoir started early in 1939 but abandoned for the more urgent propaganda value of &quot;Germany: Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;, and arranged for its publication as &quot;Geschichte eines Deutschen&quot;/&quot;Defying Hitler&quot; (direct translation of the title: History of a German).

===In the recollection of Marcel Reich-Ranicki===
Haffner&#x27;s close friend, the Holocaust-survivor and literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki (1920–2013), remarked that Haffner&#x27;s books were not only as instructive as his conversation, they were as entertaining. German journalists or historians who lived in exile in England or the United States worked for the press there, Reich-Ranicki suggested, wrote differently than before. Even after their return they wrote in a &quot;clearer, more spirited&quot; style that could be at once more factual and wittier. This, they found out, was a combination &quot;also possible in German&quot;.

<text>This is a list of people who have been video jockeys on the music channel MTV.

Originally hired to represent a wide array of musical tastes and personal ethnicities, VJs eventually became famous in their own right. Initially, they were nothing more than on-air personalities, but as the popularity of MTV grew, they began to branch out past just introducing music clips. Soon, they were considered by many to be full-fledged music journalists, interviewing major music celebrities and hosting their own television shows on the channel.

<text>West Stafford is a village and civil parish in southwest Dorset, England, situated in the Frome valley east of Dorchester. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 291. The village contains the public house &#x27;The Wise Man Inn&#x27;, and St Andrew&#x27;s Church. The river Winterbourne runs beside the village and 2 miles south lies the village of West Knighton. Thomas Hardy, when training as an architect, assisted in the design of Talbothays Lodge and the cottages opposite. The village is also accepted as the setting for part of Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Tess or the D&#x27;Urbevilles&quot;, during the period when Tess works at the Talbothays Dairy.

Reginald Bosworth Smith, schoolmaster, author and President of the Oxford Union, was born in West Stafford on 28 June 1839. His father, Reginald Southwell Smith, was the fourth son of Sir John Wyldbore Smith, Baronet, of Sydling St Nicholas, Dorset.

<text>West Moors is a village in Dorset, England, on the northern fringe of the Poole-Bournemouth conurbation, just outside the larger settlements of Ferndown and Verwood. The parish of West Moors had an estimated population of 7,400 in 2004, increasing to 7,561 for both the parish and electoral ward at the 2011 Census. The parish council was renamed West Moors Town Council in 2020.

West Moors rose to local prominence with the building of the Southampton and Dorchester and Salisbury and Dorset Junction railway lines in the late 19th century and although main line services were later diverted via Bournemouth, West Moors railway station was served by a branch line railway until 4 May 1964. The only remnants of these lines through the village are the original level crossing gatekeeper&#x27;s cottage on Station Road, and the Castleman Trailway footpath following the original trackbed leading to Ringwood to the east and Poole to the west. This however, was recently resurfaced and the central reservation was removed, rendering the southernmost of the two tracks largely unusable, and causing it to lose its former authentic look.

The village expanded with the development of the military fuel depot located outside the village but within the West Moors civil parish. The depot is home to the Defence School of Petroleum, and also to the Dorset &amp; Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service Training Centre. In April 2017 the Royal Air Force relocated their Fuels Training school from RAF Halton to MoD West Moors. In July 2018 it was announced that after over 80 years the Military would move from West Moors, under project Wellsley the RAF would relocate to MoD Worthy Down in January 2019 and the Army would have moved by April 2020. In the past many military families were housed in their own housing estates, however most jobs are now undertaken by civilian personnel and the military housing sold off. More recent population increases have been due to the influx of commuters, both to Bournemouth and Poole, and to more remote destinations such as Southampton, and London.

West Moors has a mixed population, with a relatively high proportion of elderly people. There are two first schools, one middle school, two youth clubs; including the west moors scout group, and a skatepark.

There are various shops including one butcher, one baker and two pubs. There is also the West Moors Social Club which has entertainment nights. Moors Valley Country Park is just outside the parish boundary (3 miles from the village), and is easily accessible from the Castleman Trailway.

The village&#x27;s sports facilities include two football pitches (Fryers Playing Field). The tennis courts have recently been refurbished into an artificial floodlit grass football facility and a multi-use area that can be used as two tennis courts (tarmacadam surface) or other sports. There is also a playpark on Fryer’s field and on the other side of the village (Shaftesbury Road) there is another slighter smaller play park.

== Politics ==
After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, West Moors is part of the West Moors and Three Legged Cross ward which elects 2 members to Dorset Council.

<text>West Parley is a village and civil parish in south-east Dorset, England, situated on the River Stour between Bournemouth and Ferndown and off of the B3073 road. The parish of West Parley covers an area of . It is also about to the closest major town of Bournemouth. West Parley has a primary school, a post office, a garden centre and a church. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 3,585. 


== History ==
West Parley is older than both Bournemouth and Ferndown, it features in the Domesday Book when it had 60 inhabitants. At that time it had a Saxon Church, replaced by the present All Saints Church in the 12th century. There is evidence of West Parley being much older as Dudsbury Rings, to the South West of West Parley is the remains of a hill fort dated to the Iron Age, it can be seen as a defensive site that overlooks the River Stour. The walls of the fort can still be seen today.

In 1870–1872 West Parley was described by John Marius Wilson in the &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; as &quot;The living is a rectory in the diocese of Salisbury. The church is ancient; and there is an Independent chapel&quot;. In the 1800s the main source of materials were gravel and clay and these were important in helping build within West Parley, the materials enabled the local community to create tracks that were passable and the clay meant that the workers could use the bricks to build houses within West Parley as well as supplying the city of Bournemouth with bricks for the construction.

On 16 January 2023, a fire broke out in the roof of the West Parley Memorial Hall.

== Demographics ==

=== Population ===
Over the last 200 years the population of West Parley has changed dramatically, In 1801 the population of West Parley was 180, since then the population has mainly increased, the total population decreased three times since then, once where the population went from 180 in 1801 to 175 in 1811. The second time went from 336 in 1881 to 334 in 1891, the largest increases were during the Baby Boom from 1921 to 1951, this was when everyone was procreating tenfold due to welfare benefits and due to lower income jobs. From 1921 to 1931 the population rose from 1,130 to 1,671 and then from 1931 to 1951 the population rose to a huge 2,947, this may also be due to the fact that children were also moved to small areas in the countryside and this can also account for the drop to 2,002 people in 1961.

=== Housing ===
There is a total of 1,562 houses, the largest house is with 8 residents and there is only one of these, the majority of the housing is for 2 people and there is 733 of these households and the second amount is one person per household with 377 people.

=== Age Structure ===
Information published by the 2011 census shows that 22.1% of the population was aged between 45 and 59, this means that it is the largest age group in West Parley, the second largest group in the area was 65–79 which equated to 17.1% of the total population, 79.7% of the population are aged 25 and over and the largest age group remaining out of the 20.3% is 10–14 which equates to 4.4% of the total population and so the population of West Parley is an ageing population as there are fewer younger residents.

=== Employment ===
In 1881 the main employment for males was agriculture with 45 people, during this era this was the common practice and therefore this is not peculiar, however 37 females had an unknown occupation, the main occupation for females at this date was for domestic services or offices and this only had a total of 8 women which shows the inequality at the time.

According to the 2001 census the number of full-time employees aged 16–74 years of age was 733 people, the number of part-time workers was 316 and the self-employed workers equated to 290 people The main industry of employment was wholesale &amp; retail trade; repair of motor vehicles with 283 people with the second largest being real estate with 170 people. In comparison, the 2011 census shows that there was 758 full-time employees, 408 part-time workers and 335 self-employed people. Wholesale and retail trade was still the main industry of employment in 2011 with 304 people and the second largest was in fact Human health and social work activities with 174 people.

=== Ethnicity ===
In the 2001 census of the total population of 3,532 the largest ethnicity of West Parley was White British with 3,438 people, this only leaves 94 residents that are not White British, 76 of these residents are also white which means that there are only 18 people of other ethnicities and this means that there is not many different ethnicities such as 5 Chinese and 13 mixed ethnicities in West Parley during 2001. In contrast in the 2011 census there was 3,460 White British out of a total population of 3,585, there are a further 78 white residents leaving 22 mixed race and 22 Asian residents as well 3 other ethnic group, this shows that there has been an increase in ethnic diversity since 2001.

== Politics ==
After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, West Parley is part of the West Parley ward which elects 2 members to Dorset Council.

<doc id="1077909" wikidata="Q1345802" url="?curid=1077909" title="Al Jackson Jr.">
<text>Albert J. Jackson Jr. (November 27, 1935 – October 1, 1975) was an American drummer, producer, and songwriter. He was a founding member of Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, a group of session musicians who worked for Stax Records and produced their own instrumentals. Jackson was affectionately dubbed &quot;The Human Timekeeper&quot; for his drumming ability. He was posthumously inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2015, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s in 1992.

==Early life==
Jackson&#x27;s father, Al Jackson Sr., led a jazz/swing dance band in Memphis, Tennessee. The young Jackson started drumming at an early age and began playing on stage with his father&#x27;s band in 1940, at the age of five. He later played in producer and trumpeter Willie Mitchell&#x27;s band and at the same time was holding down a chair in the popular Ben Branch Band.

In an interview with &quot;Drum!&quot; magazine, Mitchell recalled,
Al Junior was about 14 years old then. I said to his father, &#x27;Hey, let&#x27;s use your son!&#x27; He said, &#x27;Oh, man, he can&#x27;t play this stuff!&#x27; But he did make the gig. He set up his kit – a cymbal, a snare drum, and a bass drum – and I kicked the thing off. And, man, that thing went off at 20 tempos!
But that was around 7:00 o&#x27;clock. And by the time Al Senior came in an hour later, at 8:00 o&#x27;clock, Al Jackson Jr. was swinging that damn band like a pro.
Future bandmates Steve Cropper and Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn first heard Jackson playing in Mitchell&#x27;s band at the Flamingo Room, and the all-white Manhattan Club. Mitchell had also hired Booker T. Jones for his band. It was Jones who suggested Jackson be brought to Stax. He said, &quot;You guys need to know about Al.&quot; Dunn said that Jackson almost caused his wife to divorce him, because after finishing his own gig at one o&#x27;clock, he would stop by a club to hear Jackson and would get home at four or five in the morning; &quot;He was that good!&quot; said Dunn. At first, Jackson was reluctant to join Stax. He felt he could make more money playing live than doing session work. He wanted a guaranteed regular salary to come over to Stax (although he continued to play on sessions produced by Mitchell for Hi Records). And so he became the first Stax session musician to be on a weekly salary.

==Career==
At Stax, Jackson formed the M.G.&#x27;s with Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper and Lewie Steinberg (later to be replaced by Duck Dunn). During his tenure at Stax, he became one of the most influential drummers in the history of recorded music, providing an instantly recognizable backbeat behind the label&#x27;s artists, including Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, Eddie Floyd, Sam &amp; Dave, Otis Redding and blues guitarist Albert King (whose work Jackson also produced).

In the 1970s, he co-wrote and played on several hits by Al Green, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Still in Love with You&quot;, at Hi, and he was also a session drummer for many artists, such as Elvis Presley, Bill Withers, Wilson Pickett, Leon Russell, Jerry Lee Lewis, Eric Clapton, Jean Knight, Aretha Franklin, Major Lance, Ann Peebles, Rod Stewart, Shirley Brown, Donny Hathaway and Herbie Mann.

In 1975, four years after the release of their last album, &quot;Melting Pot&quot;, the members of Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s decided to wrap up their individual projects and devote three years to a reunion of the band. A few months later, Jackson was murdered in his home.

==Death==
On September 30, 1975, Jackson was scheduled to fly from Memphis to Detroit, to produce a Major Lance session, when he supposedly heard a reminder on the radio about the Joe Frazier–Muhammad Ali fight that night. Jackson called Detroit to delay the session, saying he was going to watch the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot; on the big screen at the Mid-South Coliseum.

Though still legally married, Jackson was estranged from his wife, Barbara Jackson. In July 1975, his wife had shot him in the chest, but he decided to not press charges. He was in the process of filing for a divorce and intending to move to Atlanta, so that he could begin working with Stax singer and songwriter William Bell.

Jackson attended the screening with Eddie Floyd and Terry Manning. After the screening, he returned home to find intruders in the house. Reportedly, he was told to get down on his knees, and was fatally shot five times in the back. Around 3 A.M. on October 1, Barbara Jackson ran out in the street, yelling for help. She told police that burglars had tied her up and shot her husband when he had returned home. Police found nothing out of place in the house, and Jackson&#x27;s wallet and jewelry were still on him.

The man believed to have pulled the trigger had reportedly known someone in Memphis. After robbing a bank in Florida, that person told the alleged triggerman to meet him at Al Jackson&#x27;s house. Tracked through Florida, to Memphis, and to Seattle, Washington, the suspected murderer, the boyfriend of Barbara Jackson&#x27;s friend Denise LaSalle, was killed by a police officer on July 15, 1976, after an unrelated gunfight.

==Equipment==
For recording Jackson typically used various combinations of Ludwig and Rogers drums and Zildjian cymbals. Two studio kits played by Jackson are on display in museums; a Ludwig kit (with a Rogers Powertone snare drum) from Stax Records in the Musicians Hall of Fame &amp; Museum, and a Rogers kit (with a Ludwig Acrolite snare drum) from Hi Records in the Stax Museum.

According to Steve Cropper, as quoted in &quot;Give the Drummer Some!&quot; by Jim Payne, a grey pearl Rogers floor tom was used in the mix &#x27;n&#x27; match kit at Stax.

<doc id="1077911" wikidata="Q4693128" url="?curid=1077911" title="Agnes Varis">
<text>Agnes Varis (&quot;née&quot; Koulouvaris; January 11, 1930 – July 29, 2011) was an American businesswoman and philanthropist who was the founder and president of Agvar Chemicals Inc. and Aegis Pharmaceuticals.

==Early life and family==
Varis was born Agnes Koulouvaris to Dionysis and Demetroula Koulouvaris on January 11, 1930, in Lowell, Massachusetts. She was the youngest of eight children. Her parents, both Greek immigrants, moved the family to the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York, where her father, who worked as an ice cream vendor, died when she was 14. Her mother could neither read nor write and was left to raise the family alone on the income she earned sewing buttons in a garment factory. Varis was the only child of eight to attend college. She earned her degree in chemistry and English from Brooklyn College. After attending New York University&#x27;s Stern School of Business, she shortened her surname to &quot;Varis&quot; in preparation for entering the business world.

Varis was married to the late Karl Leichtman. Ted Leonsis, owner of the Washington Capitals NHL franchise and Washington Wizards NBA franchise, was her cousin.

==Career==
In 1970, aged 40, she started Agvar Chemicals and co-founded Marsam Pharmaceuticals in 1985. She became the founder and President of Aegis Pharmaceuticals in 1992. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Varis maintained a close relationship with Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton. Varis was appointed by President Barack Obama to the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities, which encompassed 26 leading citizens from the private sector with an interest in and commitment to the humanities and the arts, as well as 12 heads of federal agencies which had cultural programs.

Varis also advocated for prescription drug reform. She helped draft the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, intended to ease generics&#x27; passage to market. She also helped draft the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act, which was co-sponsored by Senators Charles Schumer and John McCain and passed as part of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Varis helped found the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, an industry group, in 2000, and chaired the organization.

==Humanitarian causes==
In 2004, Varis became involved with the Jazz Foundation of America. Her work with the Jazz Foundation included providing funding and creating employment opportunities for America&#x27;s elderly jazz and blues musicians.

Through her work in response to Hurricane Katrina, in 2006 the Jazz Foundation of America established the Agnes Varis/Musicians in the Schools Program, first reaching out to displaced New Orleans musicians and subsequently employing more than 1,000 musicians in eight states, including some 120 elderly jazz and blues musicians performing free concerts in New York City public schools, hospitals and nursing homes. There is a New Orleans street named the Dr. Agnes Varis Way, dedicated to Varis in 2011. In 2009, then Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana Mitch Landrieu presented Varis with the coveted &quot;Saint of the Century&quot; Award at the Jazz Foundation of America&#x27;s annual benefit concert, &quot;A Great Night in Harlem&quot;, at the Apollo Theater.

As managing director for the New York Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s Board of Directors, Varis implemented the Rush Ticket Program funded by a $2 million contribution from her and her husband. The program enabled operagoers, senior citizens in particular, to purchase tickets at an 80 percent discount two hours prior to the show.

She was a resident of New York City and active in Democratic political campaigns. In 2004, she was the 24th largest individual contributor to 527 groups, donating more than $2,000,000 to pro-Democratic groups. She became known as the Fairy Godmother of the Democratic Party during the 2000s, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; published article in October 2003.

Varis made numerous contributions to Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, sponsoring graduate research fellowships as well as facilities throughout the school, among them the Agnes Varis Lecture Hall, the Agnes Varis Campus Center and Auditorium, and the Varis Cat Ward in the Foster Hospital for Small Animals. She also donated the Agnes Varis University Chair in Science and Society, dedicated to exploring scientific discovery and its impact on humankind. Varis maintained that one of her main reasons for making her name visible was to inspire other women, showing them that they, too, could achieve great success in their endeavors. In 2003, Tufts president Larry Bacow awarded her an honorary Doctorate of Public Service for her commitment to active citizenship. Varis later served as a member of the veterinary school&#x27;s board of overseers and the university&#x27;s board of trustees from 2004 until 2009.

In 2009, Varis also started the Zeus Varis Fund, a fund used to help treat animals with diseases for those who cannot afford it. The Zeus Varis Fund is established by Frankie&#x27;s Friends, and operates in Manhattan NYC.

After Varis was diagnosed with cancer and met other patients in the radiation therapy waiting room, she decided to do something special for them. She worked with her Oncologist, Dr. Gabriel Sara at Roosevelt Hospital in NYC and funded Cleopatra&#x27;s Touch. It consists of providing women with cancer the opportunity to be beautified by specialists during the course of their therapy. It includes a haircut, makeup, nail polishing, and a massage—a true Agnes touch.

The Rush Ticket Program at Met Opera in NYC initiated in 2006 by Dr. Agnes Varis and her husband, Karl Leichtman, is supported by generous grants from the Agnes Varis Trust among other donors.

==Death==
Agnes Varis died at her home in New York City on July 29, 2011, aged 81. The cause of death was cancer.

The lower portion of Central Park is dedicated to Varis. Embedded there is a plaque, with a Pericles quote, &quot;What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone, but what is woven into the lives of others.&quot;

<doc id="1077919" wikidata="Q1217609" url="?curid=1077919" title="Whitchurch Canonicorum">
<text>Whitchurch Canonicorum () is a village and civil parish in southwest Dorset, England, situated in the Marshwood Vale west-northwest of Bridport. In the 2011 Census the parish – which includes the settlements of Morcombelake, Ryall and Fishpond Bottom – had a population of 684.

In the 899 will of King Alfred the Great it was left to his youngest son Æthelweard, and in 1086 in the Domesday Book, the village was recorded as &quot;Witcerce&quot;.

On the northern edge of the village is the Church of St Candida and Holy Cross. It is noteworthy as containing the only shrine in Britain to have survived the Reformation with its relics intact, apart from those of Saint Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey and St Eanswythe in Folkestone. The saint in question is the somewhat obscure Saint Wite (Latinised as Saint Candida) after whom the church and the village are named. She is thought to be either a Christian martyred by the Danes or alternatively a West Saxon anchoress. Nothing more is known of her. The shrine of St Wite in the north wall of the transept is &quot;foramina&quot;-style, with three large vesica-shaped apertures for pilgrims to insert heads, hands, arms or feet. When the shrine was opened in 1900 it was found to contain a lead casket with the inscription +HIC. REQUIESCT. RELIQU. SCE. WITE (Here rest the relics of Saint Wite). The flag of Dorset makes dedication to St Wite.

Sir George Somers (1554–1610) was the Mayor of Lyme Regis and later Governor of The Somers Isles (Bermuda). He died &quot;of a surfeit in eating of a pig&quot;, on 9 November 1610 in Bermuda. His heart was buried in Bermuda but his body, pickled in a barrel, was landed on the Cobb at Lyme Regis in 1618. A volley of muskets and cannon saluted his last journey to the church at Whitchurch Canonicorum where his body is buried. It is also the burial place of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov and Sir Robin Day.

The hamlet of Fishpond Bottom contains St John&#x27;s Church, which was built in 1852 as a chapel of ease to the parish church at Whitchurch Canonicorum.

== Politics ==
In the UK national parliament, Whitchurch Canonicorum is within the West Dorset parliamentary constituency. As of 2024, the Member of Parliament (MP) is Edward Morello of the Liberal Democrats.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Whitchurch Canonicorum is part of the Marshwood Vale ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

<text>USS &quot;Atlanta&quot; (SSN-712), a , was the fifth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Atlanta, Georgia. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 1 August 1975 and her keel was laid down on 17 August 1978. She was launched on 16 August 1980 sponsored by Mrs. Sam Nunn, and commissioned on 6 March 1982, with Commander Robin J. White in command.

On 29 April 1986 &quot;Atlanta&quot; ran aground in the Strait of Gibraltar, damaging her sonar gear and puncturing a ballast tank in the bow section. The boat proceeded to Gibraltar under her own power. After a week, the Atlanta returned to Norfolk, VA under its own power, and was repaired in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia.

During &quot;Atlanta&quot;&#x27;s brief career, she completed six deployments to the Mediterranean Sea and three deployments to the western Atlantic. She was the first submarine certified to employ the Mark 48 torpedo and both Harpoon missiles and Tomahawk missiles. She was also the first nuclear-powered submarine assigned to directly support an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG).

&quot;Atlanta&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 December 1999. She was berthed at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, awaiting entry into the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington.

<doc id="1077947" wikidata="Q1803058" url="?curid=1077947" title="Roberto Ardigò">
<text>Roberto Felice Ardigò (28 January 1828 – 15 September 1920) was an Italian philosopher. He was an influential leader of Italian positivism and a former Roman Catholic priest.

== Biography ==
Ardigò was born in Casteldidone, in what is now the province of Cremona, in Lombardy, and trained for the priesthood. He resigned from the Church in 1871 after abandoning theology and faith in 1869. He was appointed as a professor of theology at the University of Padua in 1881, at a time when a reaction to idealism had taken place in philosophical circles.

Ardigò&#x27;s &quot;positive philosophy&quot; was a synthesis of various philosophical and scientific theories, including positivism, evolutionism, and spiritualism. He also held controversial beliefs that women are subordinate to men and that homosexuality is a mental disorder. 

Inspired by Auguste Comte, Ardigò differed from Comte in that he considered thought more important than matter and insisted on psychological disquisition. He believed thought was dominant in every action and the result of every action, and that it disappears only in a state of general corruption.

He died by suicide at Mantua in 1920, at the age of 92.

<doc id="1077950" wikidata="Q1780798" url="?curid=1077950" title="Little Tokyo, Los Angeles">
<text>Little Tokyo (), also known as Little Tokyo Historic District, is an ethnically Japanese American district in downtown Los Angeles and the heart of the largest Japanese-American population in North America. It is the largest and most populous of only three official Japantowns in the United States, all of which are in California (the other two are Japantown, San Francisco, and Japantown, San Jose). Founded around the beginning of the 20th century, the area, sometimes called Lil&#x27; Tokyo, J-Town, , is the cultural center for Japanese Americans in Southern California. It was declared a National Historic Landmark District in 1995.

==History==

=== Origins: 1880s ===
The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 played a pivotal role in the first large wave of Japanese Immigration to the United States as the Japanese were heavily recruited to serve as &#x27;cheap labor&#x27; in place of the now excluded Chinese laborers. 

One of the people influenced by this first wave of Japanese Immigration was Hamanosuke Shigeta, a Japanese seaman who settled in southeast Los Angeles, an area which would eventually become Little Tokyo. There Shigeta established the first Japanese-owned business in LA, Kame Restaurant, along the East First Street. Attracted by the restaurant and nearby demands for labor, other Japanese immigrant men followed suit as they settled along East First Street in nearby boarding houses. 

The first Japanese boarding house in Los Angeles was established by Sanjuro Mizuno, who opened the Santa Fe Boarding House in 1898 to cater to Japanese laborers. To house the wave of new immigrants coming to Little Tokyo, early immigrants also opened more of them.

=== Initial development: Late 1890s to 1930s ===
By the early 1900s, the Japanese population in Little Tokyo had reached a population of around 3,000. It jumped to 10,000 following the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, which convinced many Japanese to move from San Francisco to Los Angeles. 

In 1907, The Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement was signed between Japan and the United States in which Japan voluntarily restricted the emigration of Japanese laborers, allowing only families of current residents to immigrate, in exchange for the United States to ensure no discrimination against the Japanese people in the US. The implementation of the agreement led to an influx of women who joined family or husbands as new brides in Little Tokyo. As a result, Little Tokyo saw a growth in community and the establishment of a commercial district. By 1908, around 90 Japanese-run boarding houses could be found throughout Los Angeles.

In 1909, Little Tokyo was described as &quot;bounded by San Pedro, First and Requena Streets and Central Avenue. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; added: &quot;It has a population of about 3,500 Japanese ... there are 10,000 Japanese in the city who make this section their rendezvous.&quot;

The area was a magnet for immigrating Japanese until the Exclusion Act of 1924 halted any further migration. Shops were along First Street, and vegetable markets were along Central Avenue to the south. Japanese Americans were a significant ethnic group in the vegetable trade, due to the number of successful Japanese American truck farms across Southern California.

==== Institutions, associations, and establishments ====
The East First Street area is where the first Japanese institutions, associations, and establishments were founded in Los Angeles as &quot;Issei&quot; (first generation Japanese immigrants) began to congregate in the area. The first Japanese religious institution founded in Little Tokyo was the Japanese Episcopal Mission of Los Angeles, now Century United Methodist Church, founded in June 1896 by a group of 5 &quot;issei&quot; from southern Japan. Other religious institutions continued to be founded: the Koyasan Buddhist Temple (1912), Japanese Union Church (1923), and Hompa Hongwaji Buddhist Temple (1925).

The growing population in Little Tokyo was supplemented by the establishment of primary, secondary, and trade schools. A large amount of trade schools in Little Tokyo were sewing schools. The largest was the &quot;Rafu Yossai Gakuen&quot; which taught sewing skills to &quot;Issei&quot; women.

During this time period various newspapers catered towards Japanese Americans in Los Angeles were founded. The first Japanese newspaper in the United States was &quot;Rafu Shimpo&quot;, founded in Little Tokyo in 1903 and which continues to operate.

Founded during this time were rotating savings and credit associations known as tanomoshiko, which provided funding towards emerging business ventures in Little Tokyo.

Community Leaders in the 1920s and 1930s established local entities of prominent Japanese American associations such as the Central Japanese Association, Japanese American Citizen&#x27;s League (JACL), and the Japanese American Chamber of Commerce. Concurrently, these leaders worked with Japan to establish &quot;kenjinkai&quot; or mutual aid societies each associated to one of the Japanese Prefectures. These associations would provide mutual aid and social opportunities to Japanese families that had immigrated from the same prefecture represented by the association. By 1940, the breadth of &quot;kenjinkai&quot; covered 40/46 Japanese Prefectures.

=== World War II ===
In 1941, Little Tokyo reached its peak population with approximately 30,000 Japanese Americans living in Little Tokyo. The 1941 Pearl Harbor bombing brought an end to the increase in Japanese American population in Little Tokyo. The incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II emptied Little Tokyo. 

Beginning in 1942, after the city&#x27;s Japanese population was rounded up and &quot;evacuated&quot; to inland concentration camps, a large number of African Americans from the South moved to Los Angeles to find work in the labor-starved defense industry. Its share in the Second Great Migration almost tripled Little Tokyo&#x27;s pre-war population, with some 80,000 new arrivals taking up residence there. For a brief time, the area became known as Bronzeville, as African Americans and also Native Americans and Latinos moved into the vacated properties and opened up nightclubs, restaurants, and other businesses. Prohibited from buying and renting in most parts of the city by restrictive covenants, the area soon became severely overcrowded. A single bathroom was often shared by up to 40 people and one room could house as many as 16 occupants; people frequently shared &quot;hot beds,&quot; sleeping in shifts. Poor housing conditions helped spread communicable illnesses like tuberculosis and venereal disease. Crimes like robberies, rapes, and hit-and-run accidents increased, and in May and June 1943 Latino and some African American residents of Bronzeville were attacked by whites in the Zoot Suit race riots. 

In 1943, officials bowed to pressure from frustrated residents and proposed building temporary housing in nearby Willowbrook, but the majority-white residents of the unincorporated city resisted the plans. In 1944, 57 Bronzeville buildings were condemned as unfit for habitation and 125 ordered repaired or renovated; approximately 50 of the evicted families were sent to the Jordan Downs housing complex. In 1945, many defense industry jobs disappeared and the workers moved elsewhere in search of new employment. Others were pushed out when Japanese Americans began to return and white landlords chose not to renew leases with their wartime tenants.

=== Post World War II ===
Following the War, many previous Japanese residents returned to Little Tokyo to continue managing businesses by purchasing Bronzeville business leases. Albeit smaller, a commercial core still managed to exist in Little Tokyo. Due to lack of housing in Little Tokyo, many Japanese Americans returning from the camps moved into apartments and boarding houses in the neighborhoods surrounding downtown Los Angeles. Notably, Boyle Heights, just east of Little Tokyo, had a large Japanese American population in the 1950s (as it had before the internment) until the arrival of Mexican and Latino immigrants replaced most of them. The post-war Japanese-American population in Little Tokyo had become only one-third of its pre-war population.

Many &quot;Issei&quot; and &quot;Nisei&quot; who had previously owned large businesses or were heavily involved in agriculture now returned with little resources to work in civil service or other simple jobs. Concurrently, a large redevelopment plan was put in place to be enacted in the early 1950s, but due to a lack of state funding and wealth in the Japanese-American community following three years of internment, the plan fell to stagnation.

Following the construction there of the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters in 1953, Little Tokyo&#x27;s commercial area shrunk by one fourth from its original size. 1,000 residents were displaced to other parts of Los Angeles. The current site of Parker Center, the LAPD&#x27;s former headquarters, was the original site of the Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist Temple. The south edge of the block where Parker Center stands was part of the First Street business strip of shops. The warehouses and new condominiums to the east of Little Tokyo were once residential areas of the district.

Similar urban development would continue in the 1960s and 1970s, further shrinking the extent of the coverage of Little Tokyo.

=== 1970s to present ===
In the 1970s, a redevelopment movement started as Japanese corporations expanded overseas operations and many of them set up their U.S. headquarters in the Los Angeles area. Named the Little Tokyo Project, this movement resulted in the opening of several new shopping plazas and hotels opened, along with branches of some major Japanese banks. Although this redevelopment resulted in many new buildings and shopping centers, there are still some of the original Little Tokyo buildings and restaurants, especially along First Street. The Little Tokyo Project would transform Little Tokyo into its present version: an area bounded by Los Angeles Street, Alameda Street, Third Street, and half a block north from First Street.

During the 1970s and 1980s, artists began to move into nearby aging warehouse spaces in the area, forming a hidden community in the industrialized area. Al&#x27;s Bar, Gorky&#x27;s, the Atomic Cafe and LA Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) are some well-known sites.

Land use has been a contentious issue in Little Tokyo due to its history, the proximity to the Los Angeles Civic Center neighborhood, the role of Los Angeles as a site of business between Japan and America, and the increasing influx of residents into the Arts District. Unlike a traditional ethnic enclave, there are relatively few Japanese residents in the area. Even so, the Japanese-American community was politicized by the internment and redress effort, which, along with the global and local growth of overseas Japanese investment, has assured that Little Tokyo has continued to exist as a tourist attraction, community center, and home to Japanese-American senior citizens and others.

During its inception in 1980, the Weller Court mall was opposed by some people in the community because it redeveloped a strip of family-owned small businesses. Community activists established First Street as a historic district in 1986. In 2004, they helped reopen the Far East Cafe, an acknowledged community hub.

Little Tokyo continues to develop and change with the general development of the greater Los Angeles Area through ordinances, construction, coalitions, etc. The 2024 announcement of First North Residences and the Go For Broke Plaza, promises to provide essential housing units while serving as a permanent home for the Go For Broke National Education Center, a nonprofit dedicated to educating the public about the courage and sacrifices of Japanese-American soldiers.

==Description==
At its peak, Little Tokyo had approximately 30,000 Japanese Americans living in the area. Little Tokyo is still a cultural focal point for Los Angeles&#x27;s Japanese American population. It is mainly a work, cultural, religious, restaurant and shopping district, because Japanese Americans today are likely to live in nearby cities such as Torrance, Gardena, and Monterey Park, as well as the Sawtelle district in the Westside of Los Angeles. However, the recent boom in downtown residential construction is changing the nature of Little Tokyo.

What is left of the original Little Tokyo can be found in roughly five large city blocks. It is bounded on the west by Los Angeles Street, on the east by Alameda Street, on the south by 3rd Street, and on the north by First Street, but also includes a substantial portion of the block north of First and west of Alameda, location of the Japanese American National Museum, the Go For Broke Monument, and a row of historic shops which lines the north side of First Street. A timeline has been set into the concrete in front of these shops, using bronze lettering, showing the history of each of the shops from the early 20th Century until the renovation of the district in the late 1980s. More broadly, Little Tokyo is bordered by the Los Angeles River to the east, downtown Los Angeles to the west, L.A. City Hall the Parker Center to the north, and Skid Row to the south.

==Attractions==

===Museums and galleries===

Museums include the Japanese American National Museum and an extension of the Museum of Contemporary Art, formerly called the Temporary Contemporary and now known as the Geffen Contemporary (named after David Geffen). Additionally, the visual arts are represented by the arts non-profit, LAArtcore which devotes itself to creating awareness of the visual arts through 24 exhibitions each year along with educational programming. An art gallery called 123 Astronaut is housed within a kiosk on Astronaut Ellison Onizuka Street and contains a monument to Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka, a Japanese American from Hawaii who was a mission specialist on the Space Shuttle Challenger when it disintegrated during takeoff in 1986.

=== Public art ===
Little Tokyo has a variety of public art, including a memorial statue of Chiune Sugihara, Japanese consul to Lithuania before World War II and Righteous among the Nations.

=== Events ===
The Nisei Week festival is held every August, and includes a large parade, a pageant, athletic events, exhibits of Japanese art and culture, a taiko drum festival, the Japanese Festival Street Faire, a car show, and other events.

=== Gardens ===
There are also two Japanese gardens in the area open to the public: the James Irvine garden in the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center and a rooftop garden in the Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens, formerly the New Otani Hotel. The Go for Broke Monument commemorates Japanese Americans who served in the United States Military during World War II.

===Performing arts===

With its proximity to Hollywood and its concentration as a focal point for the Pan Asian American community, Little Tokyo Los Angeles has long served as an incubator for Asian American and Pacific Islander artists and performers sporting a high concentration of legacy institutions.

East West Players, one of the nation&#x27;s first Asian American theater companies and the longest continuously running theatre of color in the nation, specializing in live theater written and performed by Asian American artists, is located in Little Tokyo, performing in the David Henry Hwang Theater, a 230-seat venue in the Union Center for the Performing Arts.

The Japanese American Community and Cultural Center (JACCC) runs the 800 seat Aratani Theater, which features theatre, dance, concerts as well as cultural performances and events.

Visual Communications, an Asian Pacific American media arts organization that annually presents VC FilmFest (Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival), in several venues around Little Tokyo.

Tuesday Night Project is the longest running Asian American open Mic event in the nation running every 1st and 3rd Tuesday from April through October in the public courtyard of the Union Center for the Arts

Cold Tofu Improv was founded in 1981 as the nation&#x27;s first Asian American Improv &amp; Comedy Group. Teaching classes in short form and long form improv.

Kollaboration founded in 2000, is an organization focusing on advancing Asian, Pacific Islander, and Desi Americans (APIDA) in the Music and entertainment industries. With affiliates in San Francisco, Atlanta, Hawaii, Houston, Boston and throughout the country, the organization hosts its annual national culmination &quot;KOLLABORATION STAR&quot; event at the Aratani Theatre, as well as their EMPOWER conference as incubator events for APIDA artists in the music industry.

With the proximity of these organizations and Arts non-profit organizations, many notable actors, musicians and entertainers of AAPI descent have either begun their careers here, or continue to maintain a presence. East West Players saw the early careers of actors such as Daniel Dae Kim, John Cho, Reggie Lee, Amy Hill, Lucy Liu, Isa Briones, as well as playwrights Qui Nguyen. Lauren Yee, and David Henry Hwang. In 2018, actor George Takei returned to Little Tokyo for the first Post Broadway staging of the musical Allegiance by Jay Kuo &amp; Lorenzo Thione co-produced by East West Players and the JACCC at the Aratani Theatre. The Aratani has also served as a home venue to the Grammy Nominated Jazz fusion group Hiroshima (band) founded by Dan Kuramoto &amp; June Kuramoto. Actress Tamlyn Tomita began her career when she was crowned &quot;Nisei Week Queen&quot; in 1984 which led to her breakout casting in The Karate Kid Part 2. Filmmakers such as Justin Lin, Quentin Lee, and Justin Chon have premiered some of their early career making films at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival. Actor Dante Basco has been a mainstay performing his poetry alongside many others at Tuesday Night Project. Musicians such as AJ Rafael, Jane Lui, MC Jin and more have long relationships with Kollaboration since before the &quot;youtube-boom&quot; that saw many AAPI artists and musicians find an internet based audience.

Little Tokyo continues to be a major convening point for AAPI artists in the entertainment industry, and a central incubator for the nation having twice before hosted the National Asian American Theatre Conference and Festival put on by the Consortium of Asian American Theatre Artists. Little Tokyo has also seen the rise of many adjacent movements in the AAPI entertainment world such as Asian American theater companies Teada, Lodestone Theatre, Artists at Play, Hereandnow Theatre, Asian AF Comedy shows, and the Comedy Comedy Festival.

===Shopping and dining===
There are numerous Japanese restaurants, catering to both Japanese and non-Japanese clientele. Many of them specialize in one type of Japanese cuisine, such as donburi, Japanese noodles (soba, ramen and udon), shabu-shabu (which translated from Japanese means &#x27;swish-swish&#x27;, referring to the motion of dipping meat and vegetables in a communal bowl of boiling water), Japanese curry, sushi, or yakitori. There are also a number of yakiniku restaurants, where meat is often cooked on a small grill built into the center of the table. Little Tokyo is the birthplace of the California roll, invented by a chef named Ichiro Mashita at the Tokyo Kaikan sushi restaurant.

Two &quot;wagashi&quot; (Japanese sweets) shops located in Little Tokyo are among the oldest food establishments in Los Angeles. Fugetsu-do, founded in 1903, appears to be the oldest still-operating food establishment in the city and the first one to celebrate a centennial; its best-known offerings include mochi and manjū, and it claims to be an inventor of the fortune cookie. Mikawaya was founded in 1910, but is now well known as the company that introduced mochi ice cream to the United States in 1994.

Little Tokyo has several shops that specialize in Japanese-language videos and DVDs, while other shops specialize in Japanese electronics and video games. These are a great way to find Japanese video games that were either never translated into English, or were never domestically released in North America. There are also several stores that sell manga and anime related products.

====Japanese Village Plaza====

The Japanese Village Plaza is located roughly in the center of Little Tokyo on the east side of San Pedro Street. There are several restaurants in the plaza, plus a number of shops geared towards tourists. First Street and Second Street border Japanese Village Plaza and have a number of restaurants that are open later than those in the court.
====Weller Court====

The Weller Court shopping mall is located along Astronaut Ellison S Onizuka St., backing up to 2nd St. on the south and what was originally the New Otani Hotel, now the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles Downtown, along Los Angeles Street, to the north and west. It has several restaurants, karaoke clubs, and a Bubble Tea cafe. For tourists visiting from Japan, there are a number of shops specializing in expensive name brand products such as Coach handbags. There is also a large bookstore, Kinokuniya, that is part of a well-known Japanese chain. They have a large selection of Japanese-language books, magazines, music CDs, manga, and anime, as well as a selection of English-language books on Japanese subjects and translated manga and anime.

Weller Court was the second major project of the East West Development Corporation in association with the Community Redevelopment Agency, after the $30 million New Otani. Groundbreaking was held in November 1978, to be completed in 1979 with of gross leasable area. The architect was Kajima Associates.

In the 1920s, the southeast corner of First Street was the beginning of Little Tokyo. At this corner was the Tomio Building, home to the Japanese-American Tomio Department Store, and two more Japanese-American department stores, the Asia Company and Hori Brothers.

==Education==
The area is served by the Los Angeles Unified School District.
* 9th Street Elementary School
*Hollenbeck Middle School
*Belmont High School

Los Angeles Public Library operates the Little Tokyo Branch.

The main office of the Asahi Gakuen, a part-time Japanese school, was formerly in room 308 on the third floor of the Japanese American Cultural &amp; Community Center (JACCC, 日米文化会館 &quot;Nichibei Bunka Kaikan&quot;) building, located in Little Tokyo. Since then, it moved to Harbor Gateway, near Torrance.

==Religion==
There are several Buddhist temples in or near Little Tokyo, representing many major schools of Japanese Buddhism: Jodo Shinshu, Jodo Shu, Shingon, Nichiren, and Soto Zen. They are Zenshuji Soto Mission, Los Angeles Hompa Hongwanji (usually called Nishi Hongwanji), Higashi Honganji, Koyasan Buddhist Temple, Nichiren Shu Beikoku Betsuin, and the Jodo Shu North America Buddhist Missions. Together they form the Los Angeles Buddhist Temple Federation (Jodo Shinshu temples in Long Beach and near USC are also members).

Little Tokyo is also home to Japanese American Christian communities. Centenary United Methodist Church was founded in 1896 by first-generation Japanese American immigrants. Union Church of Los Angeles, founded in 1918, represents a long tradition of Japanese American Presbyterianism.

St. Francis Xavier Chapel and Japanese Catholic Center (also known as &quot;Maryknoll&quot;) has been the base of the Japanese Catholic community in Los Angeles since 1912. Fr Albert Breton, a Japanese-speaking missionary of the Paris Foreign Mission Society, with the support of Bishop Thomas Conaty of the Diocese of Los Angeles, established the community on December 25, 1912. The first Japanese Mass was celebrated at the Bronson House on Jackson Street near the current Fukui Mortuary on Temple Street. The center also formerly housed the Maryknoll School, administered by the Maryknoll Fathers from the early 1920s until the mid-1990s. Currently, Masses are offered in Japanese and English at St. Francis Xavier each Sunday.

One of the roots of Pentecostalism started in Little Tokyo. Where the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center Plaza is now located was once the home of the First Pentecostal Church, a multiracial congregation called the Azusa Street Mission. This is where the Azusa Street Revival started in 1906. Earlier, it was also the site of First African Methodist Episcopal Church.

The former Catholic Cathedral of Saint Vibiana is just to the west of Little Tokyo. After being heavily damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the archdiocese moved to a new site (now the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels) and the old site was redeveloped. The former cathedral was converted into a performing arts space and non-historic buildings on the site demolished and replaced with a new Little Tokyo Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library.

==Transportation==

The community is served by the Metro A Line and Metro E Line at Little Tokyo/Arts District station at the northeastern perimeter of Little Tokyo and is also walkable from the Metro B and D subway lines at either Civic Center/Grand Park station or Union Station – with connections to Amtrak, Metrolink, Metro J Line BRT, and Foothill Transit&#x27;s Silver Streak BRT service. When the A and E Lines connected to the former L Line, via the Regional Connector, the original Little Tokyo/Arts District station was moved underground and across the street. This required demolition of two modest, one-story brick buildings. The two structures played an important role in the cultural life of the neighborhood for decades with one of the structures dating back at least to 1898.

Metro Local lines 30 and 330 serve Little Tokyo. In March 2020, Metro selected a development firm responsible for constructing the new Regional Connector station. Community representatives from the Little Tokyo Business Association, the Japanese American National Museum, and former U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta expressed their concerns about Metro&#x27;s decision. Matters regarding the selection process, community needs, and design aesthetics delayed the project. The Little Tokyo/Arts District station was completed and reopened on June 16, 2023.

==In popular culture==
The district appears in the films &quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Ninja&quot; and &quot;The Crimson Kimono&quot;. When the Japanese anime series was localized in English as &quot;Samurai Pizza Cats&quot;, the series&#x27; main setting &quot;Edoropolis&quot; was renamed Little Tokyo.

<text>Winfrith Newburgh (), commonly called just Winfrith, is a village and civil parish in Dorset, England. It is about west of Wareham and east of the county town Dorchester. It was historically part of the Winfrith hundred. In the 2011 Census the civil parish – which includes the hamlet of East Knighton to the northeast – had 300 households and a population of 669. An electoral ward simply named &quot;Winfrith&quot; exists but extends northwards to Briantspuddle. The total population of this ward was 1,618.

==Description==
The name Winfrith derives from the river Win, which runs through the village. In 1086 in the Domesday Book it was recorded as &quot;Winfrode&quot;, and Bolla the priest held the manor. It was later granted to Robert de Neubourg, whose descendants were Lords of the Manor until the death of Sir Roger Newburgh in 1514. The family name is incorporated into the village&#x27;s name. The lordship then passed, along with the Newburghs&#x27; foundation of Bindon Abbey, to the Marney family, and then to the Poynings and the Howards, before being purchased by the Weld family in 1641.

The ancient road from Dorchester to Wareham ran through the centre of the village. However this was replaced by a turnpike (now the A352 road) in the 18th century, and the village is now south of the main road. The Red Lion Inn marks the turn to the village. North of the road is the hamlet of East Knighton. The hamlet of East Burton, further east, was formerly in the parish of Winfrith Newburgh, but is now part of Wool.

Also to the north of the village is the Dorset Green Technology Park, on the site of the former UKAEA Winfrith Atomic Energy Establishment. The latter was in service from the 1950s to early 1990s, and the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor was developed there. The surrounding heathland is a Dorset Wildlife Trust nature reserve, Tadnoll and Winfrith Heath.

The Church of England parish church of Saint Christopher was extensively restored and enlarged in 1854. At this time the north aisle was added, however some Norman architectural features still remain, the most notable being the north doorway. The parish registers date from 1585. The parish was merged with those of Chaldon Herring, East Lulworth and West Lulworth in 1979.

The village has a Church of England Primary School (now merged with that at West Lulworth), a post office, a football team, a cricket club, a drama club, a swimming pool, and a basketball court. Knighton Heath, the Five Marys and Maggot Wood (Coombe Wood) are used for horse riding.

==The Winfrith Riot==

Winfrith was the scene of an initially peaceful protest by agricultural workers on Monday 29 November 1830 during the Swing riots. The Riot Act was read by the local magistrate, James Frampton of Moreton, however the protesters failed to disperse and three men were arrested. The events were described by Frampton&#x27;s sister, Mary Frampton, in her journal:

November 28th [1830] – Notice was received of an intended rising of the people at the adjacent villages of Winfrith, Wool, and Lulworth – the latter six miles off – which took place on the 30th [actually the 29th, the date given in the Dorchester prison registers]. My brother, Mr Frampton, was joined very early on that morning by a large body of farmers etc. from his immediate neighbourhood, as well as some from a distance, all special constables, amounting to upwards of 150, armed only with a short staff, the pattern for which had been sent by order of Government to equip what was called the Constabulary force. The numbers increased as they rode on towards Winfrith, where the clergyman [George Ingram Fisher] was unpopular, and his premises supposed to be in danger. The mob, urged on from behind hedges etc. by a number of women and children, advanced rather respectfully, and with their hats in their hands, to demand increase of wages, but would not listen to the request that they would disperse. The Riot Act was read. They still urged forwards, and came close up to Mr Frampton&#x27;s horse; he then collared one man, but in giving him in charge he slipped from his captors by leaving his smock-frock in their hands. Another mob from Lulworth were said to be advancing, and as the first mob seemed to have dispersed, Mr F[rampton] was going, almost alone, to speak to them, when he was cautioned to beware, as the others had retreated only to advance again with more effect in the rear. The whole body of the constabulary then advanced with Mr Frampton, and, after an ineffectual parley, charged them, when three men were taken, and were conveyed by my brother and his son Henry, and a part of the constabulary force, to Dorchester, and committed to gaol. I was at Moreton that day with Lady Harriot F[rampton]. Our gentlemen returned about six o&#x27;clock; they described the mob they had encountered as being in general very fine-looking young men, and particularly well-dressed, as if they had put on their best clothes for the occasion.

The treatment of the three men arrested was fairly lenient by the standards of the day: one was imprisoned for three months and all three were bound over to keep the peace for two years. The underlying causes of the Swing Riots – low pay and increased mechanisation – remained however, and in 1832 a group of agricultural workers from Tolpuddle – eight miles north of Winfrith – formed a Friendly Society to protest against these same issues. In 1834 the same James Frampton who had read the Riot Act at Winfrith invoked an obscure law against oath-swearing to prosecute what became known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs.

<text>Edward Zane Carroll Judson Sr.a.k.a. Ned Buntline (March 20, 1821 – July 16, 1886), was an American publisher, journalist, and writer.

==Early life and military service==
Judson was born on March 20, 1821 in Harpersfield, New York. He moved with his parents to Bethany, Pennsylvania in 1826, then to Philadelphia in 1834. His father Levi Carroll Judson was a lawyer and wanted his son to be a clergyman.

In November 1834, Judson ran away to sea as a soldier, and the next year he shipped on board a Navy vessel. A number of years later, he rescued the crew of a boat that had been run down by a Fulton Ferry in New York&#x27;s East River. As a result, he received a commission as a midshipman in the Navy from President Martin Van Buren on February 10, 1838, and he was assigned to the USS &quot;Levant&quot;. He later served on the USS &quot;Constellation&quot; and the USS &quot;Boston&quot;.

As a seaman, he served in the Seminole Wars, but he saw little combat, and he resigned after four years. During the Civil War, he enlisted in the First New York Mounted Rifles and rose to the rank of sergeant before he was dishonorably discharged for drunkenness.

==Early literary efforts==
Judson&#x27;s first publication was an adventure story in &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot; in 1838. He spent several years in the East starting up newspapers and story papers, only to have most of them fail. An early success that helped launch his fame was &quot;The Mysteries and Miseries of New York&quot;, a gritty serial story of the Bowery and slums of New York City. He was an opinionated man and strongly advocated nativism and temperance; he also became a leader in the Know Nothing movement. In 1844, he adopted the pen name &quot;Ned Buntline&quot;. &quot;Buntline&quot; is the nautical term for a rope that attaches to the bottom of a square sail.
In 1841, Buntline&#x27;s father, Levi Carroll Judson, his wife, and his daughter moved to Pittsburgh, where Levi set up a law practice and his wife and daughter Irene opened a select school in the basement of the First Baptist Church. Here, the Judson and Allen families became acquainted. Rebecca Allen and Irene Judson were teaching at the time and became social friends. Through this connection, William and George Allen, Rebecca&#x27;s brothers, became friends with Buntline when he arrived in Pittsburgh in December 1843, ostensibly to study law with his father, but in reality to start a literary magazine. Buntline published just two issues of &quot;Ned Buntline&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in Pittsburgh in 1844 before it failed.

William and George were a co-owners of the steamboat &quot;Cicero&quot; and they invited Ned to go along on a January 1844 voyage to Cincinnati. On this cruise, Buntline told the Allen brothers of his recent marriage in St. Augustine, Florida, to Seberina Escudero, whom he described to the two brothers in glowing terms. Escudero joined her husband in Pittsburgh in May 1844. In August 1844, Buntline and Escudero relocated to Cincinnati, where Ned partnered with Lucius Hine and Hudson Kidd in an effort to purchase the &quot;Western Literary Journal&quot;. This magazine also failed.

Estranged from his family and in financial straits, Buntline borrowed money from the Allen brothers and pawned his wife&#x27;s jewelry to meet living expenses. In October, William Allen hired Buntline as a hand on his steamboat, where Ned accepted a counterfeit $10 note and lost a barrel of whiskey. While her husband was steam-boating, Escudero was sewing shirts in Cincinnati for 12 1/2 cents each. In October 1844, the &quot;Knickerbocker&quot; published an article of Ned&#x27;s titled &quot;Running the Blockade&quot; in which the hero of the story was William Allen. In January 1845 with the assistance of the Allen brothers, Buntline relocated to Nashville, where Hudson Kidd secured temporary living quarters for Escudero while her husband went off to St. Louis for a time. By January 1846, she was living in the Gower House in Smithland, Kentucky.
Buntline started a third magazine, &quot;Buntline&#x27;s Own&quot;, at this time. It was usually said to have been published in Nashville, but the Allen brothers&#x27; journals suggest that the early issues at least were printed in Smithland. George Allen&#x27;s journal of January 25, 1846, said that upon his return to Smithland, he went to visit Escudero and learned that she had died there days earlier. William Allen later stated she was buried in Smithland.

In 1845, his Cincinnati venture, &quot;Western Literary Journal and Monthly Magazine&quot;, was facing bankruptcy, and he fled from Ohio. In Eddyville, Kentucky, he collected a $600 bounty for single-handedly capturing two murderers. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and used the money to start a magazine, &quot;Ned Buntline&#x27;s Own&quot;.

Judson had a romance with the teenaged wife of Robert Porterfield in Nashville in 1846. On 14 March 1846, Porterfield challenged Judson to a duel, and Judson killed him. At his trial for murder, Judson was shot and wounded by Porterfield&#x27;s brother, and during the chaos, escaped from custody. He was subsequently captured by a lynch mob and hanged from an awning, but was rescued by friends. A Tennessee grand jury refused to indict him for murder.

In 1847, the Boston publisher and dime-novel author Maturin Murray Ballou paid Judson $100 to write &quot;The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main: or, The Fiend of Blood&quot;, a melodramatic and violent pirate novel. This was followed the same year with &quot;The Red Revenger; Or, The Pirate King of the Floridas&quot;. Buntline moved &quot;Ned Buntline&#x27;s Own&quot; to New York City in 1848.

Through his columns and his association with New York City&#x27;s notorious gangs of the early 19th century, Buntline was one of the instigators of the Astor Place Riot, which left 23 people dead. He was fined $250 and sentenced to a year&#x27;s imprisonment in September 1849.

After his release, he devoted himself to writing sensational stories for weekly newspapers, and his income purportedly amounted to $20,000 a year. In 1852 he was involved in a nativist riot in St. Louis, while he was a member of the Know Nothing Party. He eluded the authorities but was arrested in 1872 while touring and promoting his play in the city.

Although a heavy drinker, he traveled around the country giving lectures about temperance. He was an ardent Republican until the election of 1884, when he refused to support James G. Blaine. On one of his temperance lecture tours, he met William F. &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody.

==Buffalo Bill==
Buntline was traveling through Nebraska when he heard that Wild Bill Hickok was in Fort McPherson. Buntline had read a popular article about Hickok and hoped to interview him and write a dime novel about him. He found Hickok in a saloon and rushed up to him, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s my man! I want you!&quot; By this time in his life, Hickok had an aversion to surprises. He threatened Buntline with a gun and ordered him out of town in 24 hours. Buntline took him at his word and left the saloon. Still looking to get information on his subject, Buntline took to finding Hickok&#x27;s friends. This is likely how he first met Buffalo Bill.

Buntline took a train in 1869 from California to Nebraska, where he had been lecturing on the virtues of temperance. There, he met William Cody, who was with a group of men who had recently participated in a battle against the Sioux and Cheyenne.

Traveling with the gregarious Cody, Buntline became friends with him and later claimed that he created the nickname &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; for the hero of his serial novel &quot;Buffalo Bill, the King of the Border Men&quot;, published in the &quot;New York Weekly&quot; beginning 23 December 1869.

Originally, Buntline was going to cast Cody as a sidekick of &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok, but he found Cody&#x27;s character more interesting than Hickok&#x27;s. Buntline presented Cody as a &quot;compendium of cliches&quot;; however, this did not stop the New York playwright Frank Meader from using Buntline&#x27;s novel as the basis of a play about Cody&#x27;s life in 1872. In the same year, Buntline and James Gordon Bennett Jr. invited Cody to New York City, where Cody saw the play at the Bowery Theater. In December of that year, Buntline also wrote a Buffalo Bill play, &quot;Scouts of the Prairie&quot;, which was performed by Cody himself, Texas Jack Omohundro, the Italian ballerina Giuseppina Morlacchi, and Buntline.

For some time, 6-year-old Carlos Montezuma also was featured in the show as &quot;Atzeka, the Apache-child of Cochise&quot;, being the only genuine American Indian on stage, while his adoptive father, the Italian photographer Carlo Gentile, was hired to produce and sell promotional &quot;cartes de visite&quot; of the cast members.

Cody at first was a reluctant actor, but came to enjoy the spotlight. &quot;Scouts of the Prairie&quot; opened in Chicago in December 1872 and starred Cody. It was panned by critics, but was a success nonetheless. It was performed to packed theaters across the country for years. Cody served as a scout for the Army in the summer; when campaigning stopped for the winter, he would head to the stage. Buntline&#x27;s play served as training for Cody&#x27;s later Wild West show.

==Later work and death==
Buntline continued to write dime novels, but none was as successful as his earlier work. Later in life, he embellished his military career, claiming to have been chief of scouts in the Indian Wars with the rank of colonel, and to have received 20 wounds in battle. He also used these pseudonyms: Captain Hal Decker, Scout Jack Ford, and Edward Minturn. He settled into his home in Stamford, New York, where he died of congestive heart failure on July 18, 1886. He was once one of the wealthiest authors in America, but his wife had to sell his home the &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; to pay his debts.

Buntline&#x27;s novels may have had unintended consequences. Some readers became thrilled with the exploits of western outlaws, and the novels glamorized crime in their eyes. Female bandits Little Britches and Cattle Annie, for instance, read dime novels, which allegedly aroused their interest in the Bill Doolin gang and may have propelled them into a life of crime.

==The Buntline Special==
Stuart N. Lake wrote in &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot; (1931) that Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Bill Tilghman, Charlie Bassett, and Neal Brown each received a Colt Single Action Army revolver as a gift from Buntline in thanks for their help in contributing local color to his Western yarns. The revolvers were said to be chambered in .45 Colt with 12-inch barrels, removable shoulder stocks, standard sights, and wooden grips into which the name &quot;Ned&quot; was ornately carved. These revolvers came to be known collectively as the Buntline Special. According to Lake, Earp kept his at the original 12-inch length, but the four other recipients cut their barrels down to 7½ inches. Modern researchers have not found any evidence in secondary sources or primary documents of the guns&#x27; existence prior to the publication of Lake&#x27;s book.

Lake expended much effort trying to track these guns through the Colt company, Masterson, and Earp&#x27;s contacts in Alaska. Researchers have not found any record of an order received by Colt, and Buntline&#x27;s alleged connection with Earp has been largely discredited by William B. Shillinberg, who presented a detailed case to confute the Buntline Special legend.

Massad Ayoob stated in &quot;Greatest Handguns of the World&quot; that &quot;historians debate whether Wyatt Earp owned a &#x27;Buntline Special&#x27; (author is inclined to believe that he did), but Colt manufactured many in the latter half of the 20th century&quot;.

==Portrayals in popular culture==
Dick Elliott played &quot;Major Ned Buntline&quot; in the 1935 film &quot;Annie Oakley&quot; with Barbara Stanwyck in the title role. Thomas Mitchell played him in the 1944 film &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;. Lloyd Corrigan played him in six episodes of the ABC Western series &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot; from 1955 to 1958. Burt Lancaster played him (referred to as &quot;the Legend Maker&quot;) in Robert Altman&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;Buffalo Bill and the Indians&quot;.

<doc id="1077984" wikidata="Q76516" url="?curid=1077984" title="Richard Avenarius">
<text>Richard Ludwig Heinrich Avenarius (19 November 1843 – 18 August 1896) was a German-Swiss philosopher. He formulated the radical positivist doctrine of &quot;empirical criticism&quot; or empirio-criticism.

==Life==
Avenarius attended the Nicolaischule in Leipzig and studied at the University of Zurich, Berlin, and the University of Leipzig. At the University of Leipzig, he received the Doctor of Philosophy in 1868 with his thesis on Baruch Spinoza and his pantheism, obtained the habilitation in 1876 and taught there as &quot;Privatdozent&quot;. One year later, he became professor at the University of Zurich. He died in Zürich in 1896.

==Work==
Avenarius believed that scientific philosophy must be concerned with purely descriptive definitions of experience, which must be free of both metaphysics and materialism. His opposition to the materialist assertions of Carl Vogt resulted in an attack upon empirio-criticism by Vladimir Lenin in the latter&#x27;s &quot;Materialism and Empirio-criticism&quot;.

Avenarius&#x27; principal works are the famously difficult &quot;Kritik der reinen Erfahrung&quot; (&quot;Critique of Pure Experience&quot;, 1888–1890) and &quot;Der menschliche Weltbegriff&quot; (&quot;The Human Concept of the World&quot;, 1891) which influenced Ernst Mach, Ber Borochov and, to a lesser extent, William James.

He taught Anatoly Lunacharsky and was also influential on Alexander Bogdanov and Nikolai Valentinov.

==Family==
Avenarius was the second son of the German publisher Eduard Avenarius and Cäcilie née Geyer, a daughter of the actor and painter Ludwig Geyer and a (step-)sister of Richard Wagner. However, there is speculation that her father was the biological father of Richard Wagner too. Richard Avenarius&#x27;s brother, Ferdinand Avenarius, led the cultural organization Dürerbund and belonged to the initiators of a culture reform movement in Germany. Wagner was Avenarius&#x27;s godfather.

<doc id="1077986" wikidata="Q1568947" url="?curid=1077986" title="SNHU Arena">
<text>The SNHU Arena (Southern New Hampshire University Arena) is an indoor events arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, and seats 9,852 for ice hockey, 11,140 for basketball and up to 11,770 for concerts.

The facility was originally known during construction as Manchester Civic Arena, and this name still appears on most of the directional signs around town. Its naming rights were sold prior to opening in 2001 and was called Verizon Wireless Arena.

On February 2, 2016, Southern New Hampshire University announced that it had purchased the naming rights from the then SMG property management. The specific amount of money involved was never revealed, but it is known that the deal provides for student internships at the arena, and that the school will be able to use the arena for its own sporting and other events. The partnership between SMG and the university will run for a period of at least ten years after the arena officially changed its name on September 1, 2016.

In October 2019, SMG property management company merged with AEG Facilities, creating ASM Global.

The arena contains 542 club seats, 34 luxury suites, and five party suites.

==Design==
The SNHU Arena is located in downtown Manchester on Elm Street (U.S. Route 3) at the corner of Lake Avenue. The arena was built on the site of a former Zayre&#x27;s department store and is located on an irregular block, surrounded by Elm Street (west), Lake Avenue (north), Chestnut Street (east) and Auburn Street (south), with Cedar (north) and Willow (east) streets taking a corner off the southwestern corner of the block.

The arena&#x27;s exterior includes its notable curved blue roof, which helps heavy New Hampshire snowfall to slide off. The top half of the arena&#x27;s facade is a steel oval, the western side of which is lit during events and is visible from the west side of the city and from Interstate 293. The lower half of the building is red brick (similar to that found on Manchester&#x27;s iconic mills). The main entrance on the western side of the arena is entirely glass.

The floor of the arena is at ground level in the west side of the building. The Manchester Monarchs Pro Shop was formerly located at the entrance. The main concourse is on the second floor, and wraps around the entire arena: the concessions are all on that concourse aside from a bar on the third floor. There are two levels of seating: loge seats around three sides of the area and a balcony around all four sides. The arena has several luxury boxes, with a second level of boxes on the east and west sides of the interior. The arena has a standard four-sided scoreboard along with several video ribbons, located along the facades of the end zone upper decks. The arena floor level is expandable for larger events by movable seats, and events using an end zone staging area typically use the eastern end zone for the stage.

There are only a handful of onsite parking spaces, all of which are reserved for the handicapped: most patrons park on the street or in one of several large parking lots in downtown Manchester.

==Sporting events==
===Minor league ice hockey===
The arena was home to two iterations of the Manchester Monarchs, one from 2001 to 2015 in the American Hockey League and another from 2015 to 2019 in the ECHL. Both the AHL and ECHL Monarchs franchises were Los Angeles Kings farm teams. After the 2014–2015 season, Manchester and Ontario, California, were two of several markets affected by a &quot;franchise swap&quot; between the ECHL and AHL. The AHL Monarchs franchise moved to Southern California, and the ECHL&#x27;s Ontario Reign moved to Manchester. The AHL Monarchs and ECHL Reign were both owned by the same company who owned the Kings. A year later, after the 2015–2016 season, the Kings sold the newly relocated ECHL Monarchs to an entity known as PPI Sports LLC. PPI was unable to make the team profitable at the ECHL level, and abruptly closed down the team at the end of the 2019 season after failing to find another buyer. The arena is actively seeking a new tenant.

The AHL Monarchs won the Calder Cup at the end of their last season before moving to Ontario, California.

The arena has hosted the 2005 AHL All-Star Game.

===Boxing===
On November 19, 2021, SNHU Arena was the site of Demetrius Andrade vs Jason Quigley, a fight on Matchroom Boxing. This was SNHU Arena&#x27;s first boxing fight.

===Indoor football===
From 2004 to 2009, the arena was the home of the Manchester Wolves of the now disbanded AF2, the Arena Football League&#x27;s minor league.

In 2016, a women&#x27;s team, the New England Liberty of the Legends Football League, played their home games at the arena, although the Liberty played only one home game during their existence. The Liberty&#x27;s LFL schedule was only four games long. After losing their first two games on the road, the Liberty lost their first home game 77–7 to the Chicago Bliss, and subsequently opted to forfeit their second and final regular season home game.

===Basketball===
The Boston Celtics of the NBA sometimes play preseason games at the arena. The Harlem Globetrotters will occasionally go to the arena.

===Collegiate===
The University of New Hampshire men&#x27;s hockey team occasionally plays some home games at the arena, annually for several years against Dartmouth College in the Battle for the Riverstone Cup, and against the University of Maine Black Bears in the Border War. UNH has not scheduled any games at the arena since the 2015–2016 season, when UNH beat Maine 7–0 on December 30, 2015.

Since 2004, Manchester has been a regular site in the rotation for the Regional tournaments, hosting almost every two years. UNH has been the host institution for the Northeast Regional in 2004, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019. UNH played regional tournament games in Manchester every one of those years except 2017 and 2019, when the Wildcats failed to qualify for the national championship. UNH is slated to be a Regional host again in 2021.

Even though the institution&#x27;s name is on the facility, none of SNHU&#x27;s athletic programs play any home games at the arena.

===Professional wrestling===
The World Wrestling Entertainment has held events at the arena almost every year since 2002, including a pay per view WWE Backlash show in 2005. The most recent WWE event at the arena was on July 9, 2019, when Manchester hosted the weekly WWE Smackdown and WWE 205 series. WWE held a live event on June 4, 2023, with Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins defending the World Heavyweight Championship vs The Miz

===Other===
State high school basketball and hockey championships have been held in the arena.

The Professional Bull Riders Unleashed the Beast tour has made a few stops at the arena since 2020, when Jess Lockwood won the inaugural event in January 2020.

==Concerts==
SNHU Arena is one of New Hampshire&#x27;s biggest concert venues, after Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion. SNHU Arena has hosted many concerts concerts by major performers, many of whom have visited the Manchester venue on multiple occasions. Both Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and Boston Pops Orchestra have performed several times at SHNU Arena, with both groups frequently visiting in December to put on holiday-oriented performances.

On October 26, 2010, the Vermont-based jam band Phish performed a concert at this venue, which was subsequently released as part of their &quot;Live Phish&quot; series.

==Other events==

Hillary Clinton appeared at the arena in June 2007, to speak at the Manchester Central High School graduation.

In December 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) and TV icon Oprah Winfrey appeared at a campaign rally at the arena, drawing over 8,000 people. Obama also appeared at the arena in May 2007 to speak at the Southern New Hampshire University commencement.

Adam Sandler, a Manchester native, has given three graduation speeches at the arena: in both 2003 and 2010 he addressed the graduates of his alma mater Manchester Central High School, and he also spoke at the 2008 Manchester Memorial High School graduation.

2012 Republican presidential nominee Gov. Mitt Romney delivered his final speech before election day at the arena on November 5, 2012. The event drew nearly 18,000 people and was the largest political event in New Hampshire&#x27;s history. Overflow supporters were forced to watch the speech on large outdoor televisions because the arena ran out of space. The event included a concert performed by Kid Rock in support of Gov. Romney.

The night before the 2016 New Hampshire Presidential Primary, on February 8, 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump closed out his New Hampshire campaign with an evening rally at the Verizon Wireless Arena. The night before the general election, on November 7, 2016, Republican presidential nominee Trump returned to the newly renamed SNHU Arena to address a raucous overflow crowd, beginning his speech by saying &quot;there are thousands of people outside trying to get in.&quot; Trump rallies for the 2020 election were held at the arena on August 15, 2019, and on February 10, 2020. Both drew large crowds.

The New Hampshire Democratic Party held its annual convention at the arena in the 2015 and plans to do so again in September 2019. 

The FIRST Robotics Competition holds its regional competition, the BAE Systems Granite State Regional, in the arena every year.

JoJo Siwa&#x27;s D.R.E.A.M. tour made a stop at SNHU Arena on February 22, 2022.

On March 6, 2022, SNHU Arena hosted Journey, with special guest Toto.

<text>Eric Sheridan Prydz (, ; born 19 July 1976), also known by his many aliases including Pryda () and Cirez D (), is a Swedish DJ and record producer. He rose to prominence with his 2004 hit single &quot;Call on Me&quot;, and saw continued chart success with &quot;Proper Education&quot; in 2007, &quot;Pjanoo&quot; in 2008, and &quot;Opus&quot; in 2015. In 2016, he released his debut studio album, &quot;Opus&quot;.

In 2017, he won DJ of the Year at the Electronic Music Awards and was also nominated for Live Act of the Year.

==Career==
===2004–2008: &quot;Call on Me&quot; and Swedish House Mafia===
Prydz is perhaps best known for his 2004 hit single &quot;Call on Me&quot;. It topped the UK singles chart for five weeks and was number one on the German Top 100 for six consecutive weeks. Although this track made him immensely popular, Prydz has stopped playing it in his shows in an attempt to distance himself from it. In some respects he has succeeded, and with his newer songs, Prydz has gained recognition from both underground and mainstream fans. In 2006, he released a remixed version of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2&quot;, titled &quot;Proper Education&quot;, with a video.

In 2008, Prydz released the critically acclaimed single &quot;Pjanoo&quot;, which topped the UK Dance Chart.

Together with Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso and Steve Angello, Prydz formed a group of DJs that informally referred to themselves as the Swedish House Mafia. When the group with the same name officially formed in late 2008, Prydz decided not to join his friends. He has collaborated with Axwell under the name Axer and with Angello as A&amp;P Project.

===2009–2013: &quot;Eric Prydz Presents Pryda&quot;===
In 2009, Prydz released &quot;Miami to Atlanta&quot;, where the &quot;Pryda snare&quot; was first used. The Pryda snare is a popular technique in house and trance music consisting of using a compressed and sustained snare sample at the end of a bar. Commonly used to mark progressions in a song structure, it has been widely sampled in the electronic dance music world, notably by producers such as Martin Garrix, Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike, and W&amp;W.

On 21 May 2012, Prydz released his debut artist album, &quot;Eric Prydz Presents Pryda&quot;, as a 3-disc album on Virgin Records (Astralwerks in the USA). Disc 1 is made up of new unreleased Pryda productions, which some fans may have heard as works in progress (including Shadows, Agag, Mighty Love, Allein and the intro edit of Pjanoo). Discs 2 and 3 bring together many of the classic tracks from the Pryda catalogue, sequenced and continuously mixed by the man himself, including some of his special re-edits.

The Ministry of Sound club in London hosted the launch of &quot;Eric Prydz Presents Pryda&quot; on 14 April 2012, where Prydz played some of the tracks from the album. Inserting the CD in a computer and visiting Prydz&#x27;s Facebook page provides access to a download of &#x27;Tijuana&#x27;, a track previously known as &#x27;Space Miami ID&#x27; in .WAV format.

His 2013 &quot;Essential Mix&quot; was named Essential Mix of the Year by Pete Tong.

===2014–present: &quot;PR(10)DA&quot;, &quot;PR(15)DA&quot; EPs and &quot;Opus&quot;===
2014 was the 10th year of Prydz&#x27;s label Pryda Recordings, and as a result, on 9 January 2014, Prydz announced a special upcoming artist album which was initially due for release later that year. On 4 May 2015, Prydz announced PR(10)DA, a collection of unreleased tracks from January 2004 to December 2014. PR(10)DA was released over three EPs, leading up to an album release in February 2016.

On 19 May 2014, Prydz announced via social media the third installment of his concert, Eric Prydz in Concert, titled EPIC 3.0. Promising the &#x27;world&#x27;s largest indoor hologram&#x27;, new music, and new visuals, the show was to be held at Madison Square Garden during the Fall. Prydz performed his EPIC 3.0 show on 27 September 2014, playing a large range of new and unreleased material. The show incorporated a 20m, 4K hologram, and 32 lasers.

On 4 July 2015, Prydz was the first DJ with a set featured as a &quot;One Mix&quot; on Beats 1, the worldwide radio station on Apple Music.

On 5 February 2016, Prydz released his debut studio album &quot;Opus&quot;.

On 28 June 2016, Prydz collaborated with Luke Versalko from Mashable to produce a short documentary that details the making of his Epic 4.0 show. In June 2016, he also appeared on Insomniacs Night Owl Radio.

To celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Prydz&#x27; Pryda alias, on 10 April 2019 he announced the release of &quot;PR(15)DA&quot;, a collection of 27 songs.

On 19 July 2019, Prydz announced EPIC 6.0. This instalment of his EPIC series involved a multi-story eight-meter-wide transparent LED holosphere, which surrounded Prydz during his performance at Tomorrowland festival. The sphere was made up of seventy-two interlocking handmade panels, which contained over 2.4 million LEDs to illuminate with galaxies, darts of electricity, and alien planets.

Prydz presented a HOLO performance at the 22nd Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2023.

Aside from producing music, Prydz also runs the record labels Pryda, Pryda Friends, Pryda Presents and Mouseville, which release most of his own music. On Pryda, he releases music as Pryda. On Mouseville Records, started in 2002, he releases techno tracks as Cirez D.

==Personal life==
Prydz has a fear of flying, which means he mainly tours on a bus. He moved from London to Los Angeles in 2012, where he lived until his return to Sweden in 2021 after getting divorced from his former wife Sofie, with whom he has two children.

<text>Winterborne Houghton is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England. It is situated in a winterbourne valley on the Dorset Downs, southwest of Blandford Forum. In the 2011 census the parish had 82 households and a population of 183. In 2001 the population was 195.

The name derives from the River Winterborne, which has its source here.
The river only flows overground during the winter, hence the name. To the east is Winterborne Stickland and the river flows on to this village, eventually joining the River Stour. To the southwest is Milton Abbas.

Residents of Winterborne Houghton used to be known as &quot;Houghton Owls&quot;, in reference to the story of a villager who, when calling for help having got lost in the woods, mistook the calls of owls for answering human voices. In his book &quot;Dorset Villages&quot; Roland Gant posits the theory that Thomas Hardy used this tale as inspiration for the scene where Joseph Poorgrass gets lost in Yalbury Wood in &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;.

==Church==
The Church of St Andrew, grade II listed since 1955, was designed by Thomas Henry Wyatt and built during 1861–62. It is in the Perpendicular style and faced with flint with a tiled roof. It has a simple plan with nave, chancel, north aisle and south porch. The tower is on the west end and is built in two stages with a battlemented parapet. Internally, the nave has a hammer beam roof and the chancel a wagon roof. The fifteenth century font has a carved octagonal bowl on an octagonal stem, and the other fittings are nineteenth century.

==Higher Houghton==
Higher Houghton is a hamlet located at the top of Winterborne Houghton. There is a horse stable in Higher Houghton which is only used for special events (this was open to the public until 2020). Fields that are adjacent to said stables are occasionally used for &#x27;cross country&#x27; horse races.

==Houghton Down==
Houghton Down is a series of fields located towards the west of Winterborne Houghton. It is accessible from the Bridleway (nicknamed &#x27;The Grovers Track&#x27;) leading to Milton Abbas.

==Amenities==
There used to be a post office in the village with a shop but this closed in the 1990s.

There is a fish farm in the village called &#x27;Houghton Springs Fish Farm&#x27;, which provides fish to many restaurants and companies around the UK. 

To the east of the village there is a small pond, Millennium Pond, which was completed in 2000 in time for the new millennium hence why it is called the &#x27;millennium&#x27; pond. In 2004, the pond won an award for &#x27;the best millennium project&#x27;.

Towards the north of the village there is an orchard named the &#x27;Jubilee Orchard&#x27; which was placed on the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2012.

<text>United Nations Security Council resolution 497, adopted unanimously on 17 December 1981, declared that the Israeli Golan Heights Law, which effectively annexed the Golan Heights, is &quot;null and void and without international legal effect&quot; and further calls on Israel to rescind its action.

The council requested the secretary-general to report to the council within two weeks on the implementation of the resolution, and in the event of non-compliance by Israel, the council would reconvene, not later than 5 January 1982, to discuss further action under the United Nations Charter.

Israel did not comply with the resolution. After lengthy discussions on 20 January 1982, the USA vetoed a Chapter VII resolution that called for action by the international community against Israel. Then on 5 February 1982, an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly adopted by 86 votes to 21 a resolution calling for a boycott of Israel (the US and many other Western states voted against).

<doc id="1078003" wikidata="Q5735499" url="?curid=1078003" title="Herbert Sandler">
<text>Herbert Sandler (November 16, 1931 – June 5, 2019) was a co-CEO (with his wife, Marion Sandler) of Golden West Financial Corporation and World Savings Bank. He died on June 4, 2019, at the age of 87. Golden West Financial&#x27;s lending practices had &quot;Time&quot; magazine include Sandler and his wife Marion in their list of the &quot;25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis&quot;.

== Early life ==
Herbert Sandler was born on November 16, 1931, in New York City. He grew up in a Jewish family in the Bronx.

== Education ==
Sandler graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York City and the City College of New York in 1951. He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1954.

==Career==
In 1963, the Sandlers created Golden West Financial Corporation, a savings and loan holding company, to acquire Golden West Savings and Loan Association, the predecessor to World Savings Bank. Since that time, Golden West grew into one of the largest thrifts in the U.S. with assets of approximately $125 billion, deposits of $60 billion, and 12,000 employees. Under the Sandlers&#x27; management, Golden West generated a 19 percent average annual compound growth in earnings per share over a 39-year period. The company was described as &quot;one of the most efficient and productive money machines on the planet&quot;, and was included 10 times in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual list of the United States&#x27; most admired companies. The Sandlers were also named &quot;2004 CEOs of the Year&quot; by Morningstar, Inc.

In an article on the death of Marion Sandler, Ryan Mac of &quot;Forbes&quot; notes that Golden West &quot;instituted borrowing practices that were largely blamed for the housing market collapse&quot;.

Golden West was sold in 2006 for $24 billion to Wachovia Bank and the acquisition was completed in October 2006. The Sandlers owned about 10% of the company at the time of the sale, making their share of the sale price worth about $2.4 billion. Of this the Sandlers gave $1.3 billion to the Sandler Foundation.

==Role in subprime mortgage crisis==

Sandler and his wife have throughout their public life denounced predatory lenders and the poor underwriting practices of other lenders. However, the actual practices of their firm especially in the 2000s, undermined their conservative lending principles and reputations, especially in the wake of the housing crash in 2008.

The Sandlers are credited with the invention of the &quot;Pick-A-Pay&quot; mortgage that allowed borrowers to pay less than the interest due on their loan each month—which increased the total amount owed by the borrower. Analysts place the blame on the near failure of Wachovia in the fall of 2008 on the &quot;Pick-A-Pay&quot; mortgage portfolio they acquired from the Sandler&#x27;s firm.

Martin Eakes, the director of the Center for Responsible Lending, said that prepayment penalties would make it hard for cash-poor borrowers to refinance a loan for one with more manageable terms, and helped to get a law passed in North Carolina prohibiting such charges. The Sandlers supported prepayment penalties, acknowledging that lenders used the penalties to lock borrowers into “absolutely awful” loans, but saying that his firm used the penalties to fend off unethical brokers who enticed borrowers with low-interest-rate loans that often had hidden fees. Sandler described independent brokers as &quot;the whores of the world”, nonetheless by 2006 independent brokers generated 60 percent of World Savings&#x27; loan business, and he claimed that he was compelled to do so because of brokers were a dominant force in the mortgage industry. World Savings was supposed to telephone applicants to ensure that they understood the terms of their loan, as a check on the representations that brokers made to borrowers, but these calls reached only about half of the borrowers.

== Philanthropy ==
The Sandlers helped found and are among the largest benefactors of the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization fighting predatory mortgage lending, payday loans, and other products that prey on consumers; the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank; ProPublica, an investigative reporting newsroom; and the American Asthma Foundation.

The Sandlers established the Sandler Foundation in 1991, which has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to various causes, primarily focusing on scientific research, civil liberties, and social justice. In 2006, the Sandlers made a contribution of $1.3 billion to the foundation, which was the second largest American charitable contribution of that year.

<doc id="1078007" wikidata="Q1105339" url="?curid=1078007" title="Cocktail shaker">
<text>A cocktail shaker is a device used to mix beverages (usually alcoholic) by . When ice is put in the shaker, this allows for a quicker cooling of the drink before serving.

==Usage==
A shaken cocktail is made by putting the desired ingredients (typically liquor, fruit juices, syrups, liqueurs and ice cubes) in the cocktail shaker. Then it is shaken vigorously for around 10 to 18 seconds, depending upon the size and temperature of the ice.

==Varieties==
There are at least three varieties of cocktail shaker:

* The Boston Shaker: A two-piece shaker consisting of a 28 imp fl oz (800 ml) metal bottom and a 16 imp fl oz (450 ml) mixing container made of plastic, metal or (more traditionally) glass. The mixing container and bottom are inserted into each other for shaking or used separately for stirring or muddling. A separate strainer, such as a Hawthorne or Julep strainer, is required for this type of shaker if crushed ice is used. Without such a strainer, some bartenders may instead strain by narrowly separating the two pieces after shaking and pouring the drink through the resulting gap. Smaller versions, containing 18 imp fl oz (510 ml) and 20 fl oz (570 ml) are now also available. Beginning in the late 1870s and early 1880s, versions of the Boston Shaker appeared with the metal bottom piece containing integral strainer mechanisms.
* The Cobbler Shaker: A three-piece cocktail shaker that has tapers at the top and ends with a built-in strainer and includes a cap. The cap can often be used as a measure for spirits or other liquids.
* The Parisian or French Shaker: A two-piece shaker consisting of a metal bottom and a metal cap. A strainer is always required for this type of shaker, barring the separation method mentioned above.

== History ==
The cocktail shaker can be traced to 7000 BCE in prehispanic Mexico and South America, where the jar gourd was used as a closed container. In 1520, Hernán Cortés wrote to King Charles V of Spain of a drink made from cacao, served to Montezuma with much reverence, frothy and foaming from a golden cylinder. Egyptians as long ago as 3500 BCE added spices to their fermented grain concoctions before serving to make them more palatable.

By the mid-19th century, the cocktail shaker as we now know it was in wide use, invented by an innkeeper who, while using two containers to pour drinks back and forth between, noticed that one container&#x27;s mouth was smaller than the other&#x27;s and held the two together and shook them &quot;for a bit of a show&quot;. Rapid design advancement occurred during the late 19th century, with several patent improvements occurring during the 1870s and 1880s (see Patent history below), including the addition of integral strainer mechanisms to shakers.

During the 1920s prohibition era in the United States, cocktail shakers were produced in many different shapes and designs, including shakers that looked like penguins, zeppelins, lighthouses and airplanes. Cocktail shaker skills and drink rituals became as important in the Jazz Age lifestyle as knowing the latest dance step. It was after prohibition, however, that cocktail shakers really reached their zenith of popularity. They appeared in movies, and were associated with the glamorous lives of movie stars. Cocktail shakers became de rigueur symbols of sophistication and symbols of the good life.

In 1941, the era of the cocktail shaker faltered seriously, as the United States entered World War II and all non-essential uses of metal were redirected towards the war effort. The same companies and equipment formerly used to manufacture cocktail shakers were used to make artillery shells and other war materials.

In the early 1950s, cocktail shakers enjoyed a brief resurgence as soldiers familiar with them returned and became part of the housing boom featuring rec rooms with bars. By the later part of the decade, though, shakers were quickly giving way to modern electric appliances that either added a mixing unit to the shaker&#x27;s lid or did away with the shaker entirely, with the introduction of the electric blender.

By the mid-1860s, the use of a pair of tumblers to mix drinks was common practice. The patent history involves improvements on this practice:

<doc id="1078014" wikidata="Q1833647" url="?curid=1078014" title="Winterborne Kingston">
<text>Winterborne Kingston is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It lies south of the town of Blandford Forum and northeast of the large village of Bere Regis. It is situated in a winterbourne valley on the edge of the dip slope of the Dorset Downs. In the 2011 census the parish had 282 households and a population of 643. In 2001 it had a population of 613.

==Description==
Winterborne Kingston consists of Kingston, which is two thirds of the western area of the parish, and Turberville (later called Abbots Court Farm) to the east. Still further east is the hamlet of Winterborne Muston. The River Winterborne which flows through the village is a tributary of the River Stour. As the name implies, the river tends to flow only in winter. Kingston means the King held land here and bourne is an old Dorset word meaning River, thus the name of the village can be translated as Kings Land by the Winter River. Amenities in the village include the Greyhound Inn, the Church of St Nicholas, The Dunbury Academy School, the village hall and a recreational ground (including a children&#x27;s playpark).

==History==
Icknield Street, a prehistoric route later used by the Romans, passes through the village, and Roman artefacts have been revealed here in ploughed fields.

Dorset historically had many cottage industries related to the clothing trade. Button making (buttony) developed in the 1680s in the villages with Blandford the main centre. The 1851 census shows that many of the women in Winterborne Kingston were button makers. Most of the men in this area worked as agricultural labourers. The farms in this area were small dairy farms, which supplied dairy products to the London markets. There were also limekilns, which were an important part of the agricultural scene as they produced lime for spreading on the land. Barley was one of the main crops, and was used in the production of malt for the brewing of beer in Dorsetshire and London Breweries. Other trades in the area were carpenters, bricklayers, blacksmiths and shoemakers.

==Parish church==
The village church is named after St Nicholas. It is in the Decorated style and faced with flint. The Victorian architect George Edmund Street remodelled the church in 1872.

==Notable residents==
The chemist and botanist Humphry Bowen (1929–2001), author of &quot;The Flora of Dorset&quot; (2000), lived near the village during his retirement when he wrote the Flora.

==Prehistory: Duropolis and Celtic finds==

In July 2015, archeologists discovered the Iron Age remains of what is believed to be Britain&#x27;s oldest planned town near Winterborne Kingston.

In 2025, archeologists described the &quot;women-centric society&quot; of the Durotriges, a Celtic tribe, in the area dated from about 100 B.C. to A.D. 100. Under a system called matrilocality, women remained in their ancestral communities and men migrated for marriage. The scientists had &quot;a bit of a shock&quot; when they identified &quot;such a strong signature of matrilocality,&quot; said Lara Cassidy, an assistant professor in genetics at Trinity College Dublin who led the study. They found maternal lineages typical of matrilocality when they analysed the genomes of 57 Durotrigan people. It was the first time this system had been identified in European prehistory.

<text>Trinity was an electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada, 1935 to 1988. It covered a portion of western Toronto, Ontario. Its name comes from the Trinity–Bellwoods area where Trinity College, Toronto was located.

==History==

This district was formed in 1933 from portions of Toronto Northwest, Toronto West Centre, and Toronto South ridings. Its boundaries changed repeatedly over the years; when created, it stretched far north to the edge of the city boundaries. As this northern portion became more populated, it was split off into other ridings. Its eastern and western boundaries were fairly consistent, stretching from Bathurst Street in the east to Atlantic Avenue in the West. In 1987, due to the relative decrease in the population of downtown Toronto compared to other areas, this district was merged with Spadina to form Trinity—Spadina. Some portions also went to the western riding of Davenport.

==Members of Parliament==

Trinity elected the following members of Parliament:

<doc id="1078016" wikidata="Q18611" url="?curid=1078016" title="Morningrise">
<text>Morningrise is the second studio album by Swedish progressive metal band Opeth. It was released on 24 June 1996 in Europe by Candlelight Records and on 24 June 1997 in the United States by Century Black. The recording sessions took place at Unisound studio, in Finspång, during March and April 1996. &quot;Morningrise&quot; was the last Opeth release with drummer Anders Nordin and bassist Johan De Farfalla, as well as the last Opeth album to be produced by Dan Swanö.

&quot;Morningrise&quot; showcases Opeth&#x27;s signature style, exploring the dynamics between the combination of black metal and death metal vocals, and guitar parts with lighter progressive and acoustic elements.

==Recording and production==
After touring, Opeth returned home to rehearse frequently, and booked Unisound Studio again to record the album.

&quot;Morningrise&quot; was recorded during March and April 1996 at Unisound in Finspång. They stayed at the residence of the family of Peter Lindgren&#x27;s girlfriend. Opeth again produced and mixed along with Dan Swanö, similar to how the previous album, &quot;Orchid&quot;, was recorded. Swanö also engineered the album. This was the last album that Swanö worked on with Opeth. It was also the last album that was recorded with Johan De Farfalla and Anders Nordin.

As the release of the first album was delayed, they had already written most of &quot;Morningrise&quot; when &quot;Orchid&quot; was released. Although some parts of the material recorded date back to 1991, Mikael Åkerfeldt said, &quot;the material we had been writing felt really fresh and new.&quot;

According to Åkerfeldt, recording &quot;Morningrise&quot; was &quot;quite boring&quot; because of &quot;the endless drum takes, click track and shit like that&quot;. The band spent most of the time in the studio smoking. During the downtime, Åkerfeldt and Nordin wrote a guitar/piano duet, which would have been the album&#x27;s instrumental track, but they did not have enough time to finish it.

&quot;Morningrise&quot; includes Opeth&#x27;s longest song ever recorded, &quot;Black Rose Immortal&quot;, with a length of 20:15, and is the band&#x27;s only album where every song eclipses the ten minute mark in length.

==Artwork==
Åkerfeldt said that the head of Candlelight went on holiday to Bath, England, and &quot;he actually walked on the bridge or whatever it is&quot;. Later, he sent Åkerfeldt a postcard with a color version of the same picture that appears on the cover. The picture is of a Palladian bridge, located in Prior Park. The first pressing was released without the &quot;Opeth&quot; logo on the front cover.

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
Along with &quot;Orchid&quot;, &quot;Morningrise&quot; shows a sound that is influenced by progressive rock, folk, black metal and death metal, but with more clean vocals than that of the previous record. Despite the singing, Murat Batmaz of &quot;Sea of Tranquility&quot; magazine said that the song &quot;Black Rose Immortal&quot; &quot;ends with one of Akerfeldt&#x27;s most violent and longest screams in his career which could only be rivaled by his guesting on Edge of Sanity&#x27;s &quot;Crimson&quot; album&quot;, and that Opeth created a &quot;dark atmosphere on this album, which is simply unique.&quot; The album has a &quot;dark melancholic&quot; sound, and features acoustic and jazz styles. However, according to William York of AllMusic, &quot;&quot;Morningrise&quot; is, as far as the metal scale goes, possibly their least heavy album&quot;.

Mikael Åkerfeldt has stated that following the success of this album, he became tired of its style and the number of &quot;copycat&quot; bands using the counterpoint melodies found in this album and its predecessor. He also says that he finds certain sections of &quot;Morningrise&quot; &quot;unlistenable&quot; and was compelled to change Opeth&#x27;s sound for &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; accordingly.

Lyrically, the song &quot;The Night and the Silent Water&quot; is about the grandfather of vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt, who had died shortly before the recording of the album. &quot;To Bid You Farewell&quot;, the album&#x27;s final song, was notable at the time for having a lighter sound and featuring only clean vocals. This album also features Opeth&#x27;s longest recorded song, &quot;Black Rose Immortal&quot;, which lasts over 20 minutes. The reissue bonus track &quot;Eternal Soul Torture&quot; is a demo that was recorded in 1992, and includes some sections that were reused in the studio track &quot;Advent&quot;, as well as &quot;In Mist She Was Standing&quot; from the previous album &quot;Orchid&quot;.

==Reception==
The album was well-received critically. Vincent Eldefors of &quot;Tartarean Desire&quot; stated &quot;ever since I first heard my first Opeth song &quot;To Bid You Farewell&quot; ... they have been among my favorite bands&quot;. &quot;Dan Swanö helped record this epic piece&quot;, said John Chedsey of &quot;Satan Stole My Teddybear&quot; in his review, and also mentioned that &quot;generally the songs flow well from one part to the next, though individual songs are not immediately noticeable. The twin guitars work well with each other, creating some great melodies in the guitars, and often lapsing into very tasteful acoustic moods. In my opinion, it&#x27;s difficult to write on guitar intricate songs that fully involve the listener, but Opeth manages to keep your attention.&quot; Murat Batmaz of &quot;Sea of Tranquility&quot; wrote that &quot;the melodies, both on this song [&quot;Advent&quot;] and the entire album, are immortal.&quot; He also wrote, &quot;Though I prefer their current lineup, I don&#x27;t believe &quot;Morningrise&quot; would have been so amazing without Johan De Farfalla and Anders Nordin adding their touches. They both incorporate subtle jazz harmonies in their playing enriching the psychedelic passages on the album.&quot; He was also impressed with the guitar riffs, saying &quot;it is almost shocking how many godlike riffs Opeth are using in their songs. They literally employ tens of changing riff patterns and incomparable melodies on a single track, with which other bands could more than likely write two full albums&quot; and claimed that the song &quot;Black Rose Immortal&quot; is a &quot;magnum opus&quot;.

William York of AllMusic wrote, &quot;the tracks here could best be described as miniature audio movies.&quot; Christian Renner of &quot;Metal Crypt&quot; praised the album as being &quot;overall another excellent album worthy of extremely high praise and what would be a masterpiece for most bands turns out to be just another great album from the genius that is Opeth.&quot; Jim Raggi of &quot;Lamentations of the Flame Princess&quot; said that &quot;this is still the most perfect album ever recorded.&quot; He also stated &quot;the more personal nature of the lyrics on &quot;Morningrise&quot; are another thing that make it a much more intense listen than the stories that would follow. It&#x27;s incredible how everything changed after this album. The lineup, the style, the lyrics ... Opeth has never released less than an excellent album. But they have only released one perfect album.&quot; Drew Schinzel of &quot;Chronicles of Chaos&quot; said that the songs are &quot;melodic and well played, with great vocals and the occasional guitar solo&quot;. However, he also commented, &quot;maybe I&#x27;m just not in touch with my inner-acoustic-child, but the acoustic sections are too numerous, and get old fast.&quot;

<doc id="1078017" wikidata="Q1759639" url="?curid=1078017" title="Paraibuna">
<text>Paraibuna is a municipality (&quot;município&quot;) in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. The population is 18,263 (2020 est.) in an area of 809.58 km². The elevation is 635 m. The SP-99 highway passes through the town.

The municipality contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraíba do Sul river.

== History ==

The city was founded on June 13, 1666, with the construction of a hut and a chapel in honor of St. Anthony. On June 3, 1773 Manuel Antonio assumed the administration of the settlement Santo Antonio da Barra de Paraibuna. In 1812 the parish was established by the Prince Regent, and made a village, which was raised to a town in 1857. From 1830 to 1870 the area was known for its coffee plantations, and many farms, including the Fazenda São Pedro, were created for that purpose. With the decline of coffee plantations, farmers started to grow cotton. During this time Paraibuna began its financial decline.

A fresh impetus came to the county with the initiation of dairy-cattle breeding since 1922. Other economic progress derived from the construction of the President Dutra Freeway (Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo) and the Tamoios Highway. Construction of the Paraibuna-Paraitinga Dam in the 1960s brought new difficulties to the community: the inundation of prime land and the exodus of agricultural workers. Today the county invests in tourism in order to improve its economy.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia de Telecomunicações do Estado de São Paulo until 1975, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1078024" wikidata="Q347350" url="?curid=1078024" title="Pavel Axelrod">
<text>Pavel Borisovich Axelrod (; 25 August 1850 – 16 April 1928) was an early Russian Marxist revolutionary. Along with Georgi Plekhanov, Vera Zasulich, and Leo Deutsch, he was one of the members of the first organization of Russian Marxists, Emancipation of Labor. After the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, he was part of the Menshevik faction, with which he was identified until his death.

==Early life and career==

Pavel Axelrod was the son of a Jewish innkeeper. His parents lived in the Jewish poorhouse. He was forced to work for a living from a young age; though while still in his early teens, he produced his first political essay, on the condition of the Jewish poor in the Mogilev Region, in modern-day Belarus. At the age of 16, he discovered the writings of the German socialist Ferdinand Lasalle, which had a major influence on him. Later, he obtained a place at Kiev University, with financial help from wealthy Jews, and organised a political discussion group, based on the ideas of P.L.Lavrov.

In 1874, he was one among hundreds of idealistic students who left the cities to work among the peasants. When that experiment failed, he emigrated to Geneva, where he was converted to anarchism and joined a circle of Russians who followed the ideas of Mikhail Bakunin. He returned to Ukraine briefly later in 1875, joined the Land and Liberty (&quot;Земля и Воля&quot;) party. He devoted himself to propaganda work among factory workers in Kiev, where in 1879, he and Yakov Stefanovich, founded the Workers&#x27; Union of South Russia. Unlike other anarchist groups, as well as aiming for the eventual transformation of society on anarchist foundations, they also advocated immediate reforms such as democratic freedoms, shorter working hours etc.

The Union disintegrated when Axelrod moved to St Petersburg, at the time when Zemlya i Volya split over the issue of whether to assassinate the Tsar Alexander II. He was a founder the populist Black Repartition group, another of whose leading members was Georgi Plekhanov. Axelrod was a &#x27;moderate&#x27; within the Russian revolutionary movement, with an instinctive dislike of revolutionary violence. In 1878, he warned against the possibility of the movement degenerating into Jacobinism. He was &quot;indignant&quot; when two members of Black Repartition, Elizaveta Kovalskaya and Nikolai Schedrin told him that they planned to kill a factory owner in Smolensk who locked his workers in the factory overnight, with a result that many of them were burned to death when the building caught fire. He argued in the journal &quot;Vol&#x27;noe Slovo&quot; that the Kiev pogrom was damaging to the proletariat.

Axelrod emigrated to Switzerland again in June 1880, remaining in exile for 37 years.

=== Family ===
In 1875 in Geneva, Axelrod married his former private student Nadezhda Ivanovna Kaminer, daughter of Isaac Kaminer. A student himself, Axelrod was Kaminer&#x27;s and her sister&#x27;s tutor. Despite severe financial hardship during the first years, the marriage proved to be successful. They had three children: Vera (born 22 November 1875), Alexander (born 18 July 1879) and Sofia (born 14 November 1881). Nadezhda Ivanovna Axelrod-Kaminer died in 1906.

To provide income for his family while in exile, Axelrod raised milk cows and produced his own kind of buttermilk which he then would sell and deliver himself to his customers. Axelrod would argue politics over his milk cans. His home was a place of refuge for fugitives from Russia, who were fed there; some were fitted out with new clothes.

In the mid-1880s Axelrod established his own small company producing kefir. By the end of the 1890s, Axelrod&#x27;s company had offices in Zürich, Geneva, and Basel, which provided steady income and allowed him to support revolutionaries. In 1908, Axelrod sold his company in exchange for the retirement payments to him from the new owner.

==Marxist revolutionary==
In Switzerland, in September 1883, Axelrod joined Plekhanov, Vera Zasulich and Leo Deutsch in Emancipation of Labor (Освобождение Труда), the first Russian Marxist group. He wrote several essays which laid out the differences between marxists and the traditional Russian populists, or Narodniks, who believed that a peasant revolution would overthrow the Russian monarchy and introduce socialism, bypassing capitalism – &quot;The Workers&#x27; Movement and Social Democracy&quot; (Рабочее движение и социальная демократия) (1885) and &quot;Letter to Russian workers on the movement for the liberation of the proletariat&quot; (Письма к русским рабочим об освободительном движении пролетариата) (1889).

In 1900, Axelrod, Plekhanov, and Zasulich joined with the younger revolutionary Marxists Julius Martov, Vladimir Lenin, and Alexander Potresov to form the editorial board of &quot;Iskra&quot;, a Marxist newspaper, from 1900 to 1903. When &quot;Iskra&quot; supporters split at the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1903, Axelrod sided with the Menshevik faction.

Originally, he was seen as the leader of the Mensheviks, before he ceded that position to the younger Martov. Axelrod fundamentally disagreed with Lenin&#x27;s concept of the party as a disciplined organisation of professional revolutionaries who led the workers. He believed that the revolutionaries would eventually take instructions from organised labour, and during the 1905 revolution, he was the author of a proposal to hold a mass workers&#x27; conference. After that failure, his influence within the Menshevik party diminished, but he continued to be a spokesman for the Menshevik in international conferences, particularly after the outbreak of war in 1914, when he was part of the Russian delegation at the anti-war Zimmerwald Conference. 

In 1917, after the February Revolution, Axelrod returned to Russia. By then some Mensheviks had already joined Kerensky&#x27;s Provisional Government and supported government war policy. Despite all his efforts, Axelrod failed to gain Mensheviks&#x27; support for a policy of immediate peace negotiations with the Central Powers. After the Bolshevik victory, which Axelrod called a &quot;historical crime without parallel in modern history&quot;, he toured the world rallying socialist opposition to the Bolsheviks.

==Death==
Axelrod died in exile in Berlin in 1928.

<text>Parapuã is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 10,949 (2020 est.) in an area of 366 km². The elevation is 486 m. It was founded by Luiz de Souza Leão in 1934.

In the 1970s the county was called &quot;Capital of the Coffee&quot; because there were 12,500,000 coffee plants. But in 1975 a frost destroyed most of them. In spite of this, coffee is still important for the local economy, along with sugar cane and corn.

==History==
The municipality was created by state law in 1944.
== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

== Religion ==

Christianity is present in the city as follows:

=== Catholic Church ===
The Catholic church in the municipality is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marília.

=== Protestant Church ===
The most diverse evangelical beliefs are present in the city, mainly Pentecostal, including the Assemblies of God in Brazil (the largest evangelical church in the country), Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others. These denominations are growing more and more throughout Brazil.

<doc id="1078027" wikidata="Q910300" url="?curid=1078027" title="Spectral color">
<text>A spectral color is a color that is evoked by monochromatic light, i.e. either a spectral line with a single wavelength or frequency of light in the visible spectrum, or a relatively narrow spectral band (e.g. lasers). Every wave of visible light is perceived as a spectral color; when viewed as a continuous spectrum, these colors are seen as the familiar rainbow.
Non-spectral colors (or extra-spectral colors) are evoked by a combination of spectral colors.

== In color spaces==
In color spaces which include all, or most spectral colors, they form a part of boundary of the set of all real colors. When considering a three-dimensional color space (which includes luminance), the spectral colors form a surface. When excluding luminance and considering a two-dimensional color space (chromaticity diagram), the spectral colors form a curve known as the spectral locus. For example, the spectral locus of the CIEXYZ chromaticity diagram contains all the spectral colors (to the eye of the standard observer).

A trichromatic color space is defined by three primary colors, which can theoretically be spectral colors. In this case, all other colors are inherently non-spectral. In reality, the spectral bandwidth of most primaries means that most color spaces are entirely non-spectral. Due to different chromaticity properties of different spectral segments, and also due to practical limitations of light sources, the actual distance between RGB pure color wheel colors and spectral colors shows a complicated dependence on the hue. Due to the location of R and G primaries near the &#x27;almost flat&#x27; spectral segment, RGB color space is reasonably good with approximating spectral orange, yellow, and bright (yellowish) green, but is especially poor in reproducing the visual appearance of spectral colors in the vicinity of central green, and between green and blue, as well as extreme spectral colors approaching IR or UV.

Spectral colors are universally included in scientific color models such as CIE 1931, but industrial and consumer color spaces such as sRGB, CMYK, and Pantone, do not typically include any spectral colors. Exceptions include Rec. 2020, which uses three spectral colors as primaries (and therefore only includes precisely those three spectral colors), and color spaces such as the ProPhoto RGB color space which use imaginary colors as primaries.

In color models capable of representing spectral colors, such as CIELUV, a spectral color has the maximal saturation. In Helmholtz coordinates, this is described as 100% purity.

===In dichromatic color spaces===
In dichromatic color vision there is no distinction between spectral and non-spectral colors. Their entire gamut can be represented by spectral colors.

== Spectral color terms ==

The spectrum is often divided into &quot;color terms&quot; or names, but aligning boundaries between color terms to a specific wavelength is very subjective.

The first person to decompose white light and name the spectral colors was Isaac Newton. Early in the study of radiometry, Newton was not able to measure the wavelength of the light, but his experiments were repeated contemporarily to estimate wavelengths where his color term boundaries probably lay. Newton&#x27;s color terms included red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet; this color sequence is still used to describe spectral colors colloquially and a mnemonic for it is commonly known as &quot;Roy G. Biv&quot;.

In modern divisions of the spectrum, indigo is often omitted and a blue-green color is sometimes included. Some have argued that Newton&#x27;s indigo would be equivalent to our modern blue, and his blue equivalent to our blue-green. However, his nonintuitive choices can be better explained. In the table below, note how wavelength is not proportional to hue (which is approximately perceptually uniform). Color systems such as ISCC-NBS attempt to divide the spectrum into sections that appear perceptually uniform. On the other hand, Newton&#x27;s sections are approximately uniform in size as they would have physically appeared in the diffracted spectrum, i.e. each about 40nm &quot;wide&quot;. In this theory, the sections were divided without influence of his own perception, and each section was then given a name that best suited its &quot;average&quot; color. In contrast, the sections in the ISCC-NBS spectrum vary greatly in wavelength range, but are more consistent in the hue degree range. Both instances deviate from the basic color terms used in English, only some of which are spectral colors.

The table below includes several definitions where the spectral colors have been categorized in color terms. The hue that a given monochromatic light evokes is approximated at the right side of the table.

==Extra-spectral colors==

Among some of the colors that are spectral colors are:

* Grayscale (achromatic) colors, such as white, gray, and black.
* Any color obtained by mixing a gray-scale color and another color (either spectral or not), such as pink (a mixture of a reddish color and white), or brown (a mixture of orange and black or gray).
* Violet-red colors, which include colors in the line of purples (such as magenta and rose), and other variations of purple and red.
* Impossible colors, which cannot be seen under normal viewing of light, such as over-saturated colors or colors that are seemingly brighter than white.
* Metallic colors which reflect light by effect.

<text>The Killip classification is a system used in individuals with an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), taking into account physical examination and the development of heart failure in order to predict and stratify their risk of mortality. Individuals with a low Killip class are less likely to die within the first 30 days after their myocardial infarction than individuals with a high Killip class.
==The study==
The study was a case series with unblinded, unobjective outcomes, not adjusted for confounding factors, nor validated in an independent set of patients. The setting was the coronary care unit of a university hospital in the USA.

250 patients were included in the study (aged 28 to 94; mean 64, 72% male) with a myocardial infarction. Patients with a cardiac arrest prior to admission were excluded.

Patients were ranked by Killip class in the following way:
* Killip class I includes individuals with no clinical signs of heart failure.
* Killip class II includes individuals with rales or crackles in the lungs, an S3, and elevated jugular venous pressure.
* Killip class III describes individuals with frank acute pulmonary edema.
* Killip class IV describes individuals in cardiogenic shock or hypotension (measured as systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg), and evidence of peripheral vasoconstriction (oliguria, cyanosis or sweating).

==Conclusions==
The numbers below were accurate in 1967. Nowadays, they have diminished by 30 to 50% in every class.

Within a 95% confidence interval the patient outcome was as follows:
The Killip-Kimball classification has played a fundamental role in classic cardiology, having been used as a stratifying criterion for many other studies. Worsening Killip class has been found to be independently associated with increasing mortality in several studies.

Killip class 1 and no evidence of hypotension or bradycardia, in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome, should be considered for immediate IV beta blockade.

<text>Mark Edward Petersen (November 7, 1900 – January 11, 1984) was an American news editor and religious leader. He was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. He served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1944 until his death. He became managing editor of the church-owned &quot;Deseret News&quot; in 1935 and then editor in 1941. He filled the vacancy in the Quorum caused by the excommunication of Richard R. Lyman. 

==Early life==
As a young boy, Petersen was a newspaper carrier, and he also helped in his father’s construction business. Later, he attended the University of Utah and served a mission for the LDS Church in Nova Scotia. In pursuing a career, he became a reporter for the &quot;Deseret News&quot; and continued working for the paper for sixty years, advancing to the position of president and chairman of the board. Petersen wrote numerous editorials and published more than forty books and many pamphlets used in the church&#x27;s missionary effort.

==LDS Church service==
In April 1944, while serving as general manager of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, Petersen was called to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In his calling as an apostle, he directed the church’s public information programs and served on the Military Relations Committee. He was an adviser to the church&#x27;s Relief Society, Indian Affairs Committee, and Music Committee. He served as president of the West European Mission for more than six years. Petersen was also involved in many community affairs. He was closely associated with the Boy Scouts of America and was a recipient of the Silver Antelope Award. In 1959, in response to a rash of arrests of gay men in Utah and Idaho, church president David O. McKay assigned apostles Spencer W. Kimball and Petersen to work on curing gays within the church.

===Controversial teachings===
At Brigham Young University on 27 August 1954, at the Convention of Teachers of Religion on the College Level, Petersen delivered the speech, &quot;Race Problems—As They Affect the Church&quot;. The speech outlined the religious underpinnings of racial segregation and supported its continued practice as it related to intermarriage between blacks and whites. Particularly, he reaffirmed the LDS Church&#x27;s teaching at that time that those with dark skin had been less valiant in their lives before coming to earth. He also reiterated the idea that blacks were to be servants to righteous white people after the resurrection, as was the case with Jane Manning James who was sealed to Joseph Smith to be his servant in the next life. Petersen said:

In spite of all he did in the pre-existent life, the Lord is willing, if the Negro accepts the gospel with real, sincere faith, and is really converted, to give him the blessings of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. If that Negro is faithful all his days, he can and will enter the celestial kingdom. He will go there as a servant, but he will get a celestial resurrection. He will get a place in the celestial glory.
In the 1940s, Petersen coined the term &quot;Mormon fundamentalist&quot; to describe people who had left the LDS Church to practice plural marriage.

==Death==
Petersen died from longstanding complications of cancer after entering Cottonwood Hospital in Murray, Utah, and undergoing surgery. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

==ARIA Hall of Fame inductee==
*Little River Band

1970s members of Little River Band: Beeb Birtles, David Briggs, Graeham Goble, George McArdle, Derek Pellicci and Glenn Shorrock, were inducted into the Hall of Fame. The later members including fellow Australian, John Farnham, and US-based musicians, were not included in this induction. Due to a 2002 legal ruling on their right to use the band&#x27;s name—two US-based members held the trademark—they performed as Classic Lineup of the Little River Band or Little River Band – Classic Lineup (sources vary). Shorrock had already been inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1991 and Farnham was inducted, for his solo work, in 2003.
