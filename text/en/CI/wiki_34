<text>In civil engineering (more specifically highway engineering), grade separation is a method of aligning a junction of two or more surface transport axes at different heights (grades) so that they will not disrupt the traffic flow on other transit routes when they cross each other. The composition of such transport axes does not have to be uniform; it can consist of a mixture of roads, footpaths, railways, canals, or airport runways. Bridges (or overpasses, also called flyovers), tunnels (or underpasses), or a combination of both can be built at a junction to achieve the needed grade separation.

In North America, a grade-separated junction may be referred to as a &quot;grade separation&quot; or as an &quot;interchange&quot; – in contrast with an &quot;intersection&quot;, &quot;at-grade&quot;, a &quot;diamond crossing&quot; or a &quot;level crossing&quot;, which are not grade-separated.

==Effects==
===Advantages===
Roads with grade separation generally allow traffic to move freely, with fewer interruptions, and at higher overall speeds; this is why speed limits are typically higher for grade-separated roads. In addition, reducing the complexity of traffic movements reduces the risk of accidents.

=== Disadvantages ===
Grade-separated road junctions are typically space-intensive, complicated, and costly, due to the need for large physical structures such as tunnels, ramps, and bridges. Their height can be obtrusive, and this, combined with the large traffic volumes that grade-separated roads attract, tend to make them unpopular to nearby landowners and residents. For these reasons, proposals for new grade-separated roads can receive significant public opposition.

Rail-over-rail grade separations take up less space than road grade separations: because shoulders are not needed, there are generally fewer branches and side road connections to accommodate (because a partial grade separation will accomplish more improvement than for a road), and because at-grade railway connections often take up significant space on their own. However, they require significant engineering effort, and are very expensive and time-consuming to construct.

Grade-separated pedestrian and cycling routes often require modest space since they do not typically intersect with the facility (such as a highway) that they cross. However, grade-separated pedestrian crossings with steps introduce accessibility problems. Some crossings have lifts, but these can be time-consuming to use.

Grade-separated roads that permit for higher speed limits can actually reduce safety due to &#x27;weaving&#x27; (see below) as well as a perceived sense of safety.

==Roads==
===Overview ===
The term is most widely applied to describe a road junction in which the direct flow of traffic on one or more of the roads is not disrupted. Instead of a direct connection, traffic must use &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off ramps&quot; (United States, Australia, New Zealand) or &quot;slip roads&quot; (United Kingdom, Ireland) to access the other roads at the junction. The road which carries on through the junction can also be referred to as &quot;grade separated&quot;.

Typically, large freeways, highways, motorways, or dual carriageways are chosen to be grade separated, through their entire length or for part of it. Grade separation drastically increases the capacity of a road compared to an identical road with at-grade junctions. For instance, it is extremely uncommon to find an at-grade junction on a British motorway; it is all but impossible on a U.S. Interstate Highway, though a few do exist.

If traffic can traverse the junction from any direction without being forced to come to a halt, then the junction is described as &quot;fully grade separated&quot; or &quot;free-flowing&quot;.
===Types===
==== Fully separated ====
These junctions connect two freeways:

*Stack interchange (two-level, three-level, or four-level stack, depending on how many levels cross at the central point)
*Cloverleaf interchange
*Trumpet interchange
*Cloverstack interchange
*Directional T
*Semi-directional T
*Turbine (whirlpool) interchange
*Windmill interchange
*Various incarnations of spaghetti junction

====Partially separated ====
These junctions connect two roads, but only one is fully grade-separated, i.e. traffic on one road does not have to stop at yield lines or signals on one road, but may have to do so when switching to the other:

*Diamond interchange
*Partial cloverleaf interchange
*Single-point urban interchange
*Roundabout interchange
*Compact grade-separation, whereby the two roads are linked by a compact &quot;connector road&quot;, with major-minor priority junctions at each of its ends; usually a variant of the cloverleaf type interchange, but only involving two quadrants rather than four

===Weaving===

On roadways with grade-separated interchanges, &quot;weaving&quot; is a result of placing an exit ramp a short distance after an entry ramp, causing conflicts between traffic attempting to leave the roadway at the next junction and traffic attempting to enter from the previous junction. This situation is most prevalent either where the junction designer has placed the on-slip to the road before the off-slip at a junction (for example, the cloverleaf interchange), or in urban areas with many close-spaced junctions. The ring road of Coventry, England, is a notorious example, as are parts of the southern M25, the London orbital motorway, the M6/M5 junction north-west of Birmingham, and the A4/M5 junction west of Bristol. Weaving can often cause side-on collisions on very fast roads with top speeds of up to 200 kilometres per hour, as well as the problem of blind spots.

Where junctions have unusual designs weaving can be a problem other than on the main road. An example of this can be found at Junction 7 of the M6, where traffic joining the roundabout from the M6 Eastbound off-slip must weave with the traffic already on the roundabout wishing to use the M6 Westbound on-slip. This is as a result of the slip roads on the west side of the junction connecting to the roundabout on the inside of the eastern arc rather than the outside of the western arc as is normal. The two slip-roads are connected by a single lane on the inside of the roundabout, which traffic wishing to use the Westbound on-slip must join, and traffic from the Eastbound off-slip must leave.

Weaving can be alleviated by using collector/distributor roads or braided ramps to separate entering and exiting traffic.

==Railways==
=== With roads and footpaths ===

In railway construction, grade separation also means the avoidance of level crossings by making any roads or footpaths crossing the line either pass under or over the railway on bridges. This greatly improves safety and is crucial to the safe operation of high-speed lines. The construction of new level crossings is generally not permitted, especially for high speed railway lines and level crossings are increasingly less common due to the increase of both road and rail traffic. Efforts to remove level crossings are done in the UK by Network Rail and in Melbourne as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project.

The London Extension of the Great Central Railway, built between 1896 and 1899, was the first fully grade-separated railway of this type in the UK. This also applies to light rail and even to street cars.

=== Flying junction ===
Attempts have been made to increase the capacity of railways by making tracks cross in a grade-separated manner, as opposed to the traditional use of flat crossings to change tracks. A grade-separated rail interchange is known as a flying junction and one which is not a level junction.

In 1897, the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) made use of a flying junction at Worting Junction south of Basingstoke to allow traffic on the Salisbury and Southampton routes to converge without conflicting movements; this became known as &quot;Battledown Flyover&quot;. Also in Britain, the Southern Railway later made extensive use of flying junctions on other parts of its busy former LSWR main line.

Today in Britain, the tightly grouped nest of flying junctions to the north of Clapham Junction railway station—although technically a combination of many junctions—handle more than 4,000 trains per day (about one train every 15 seconds).

Virtually all major railway lines no longer cross (forming an &#x27;X&#x27; shape) at flat level (although many diverge - i.e. &#x27;Y&#x27; shape).

=== High-speed railways (+) ===
On almost all high-speed railway lines, the faster speed requires grade separation. Therefore, many high speed lines are elevated, especially in Taiwan and Japan, where population density alongside high speed lines is higher than in France, Italy or Germany.

In the United States, a flying junction on the Nickel Plate Road through Cleveland, Ohio, United States was completed in 1913. The most frequent use was later found on the former Pennsylvania Railroad main lines. The lines are included as part of the Northeast Corridor and Keystone Corridor now owned by Amtrak. The most complex of these junctions, near Philadelphia Zoo, handles railway traffic for Amtrak, SEPTA, New Jersey Transit, Norfolk Southern, CSX Transportation, and Conrail.

In what is known as &quot;area 1520&quot;, which includes the former Soviet Union and other regions using the same gauge, the most complicated grade-separation railpoint is found at Liubotyn in Ukraine.

==Footbridges and subways==
Footbridges and subways (called underpasses in North America as well as in the United Kingdom when referring to roads) may be employed to allow pedestrians and cyclists to cross busy or fast streets. They are often used over and under motorways since at grade pedestrian crossings are generally not permitted. Same can be said for railways. Though introduced to Central Park in New York City in the 1860s, subways are far more common today in Europe, especially in countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark where cycling is strongly encouraged. Long underpasses may be called tunnels.

<doc id="1055016" wikidata="Q750262" url="?curid=1055016" title="Suzuki Swift">
<text>The is a supermini car (B-segment) produced by Suzuki. The vehicle is classified as a B-segment marque in the European single market, a segment referred to as a supermini in the British Isles. Prior to this, the &quot;Swift&quot; nameplate had been applied to the rebadged Suzuki Cultus in numerous export markets since 1984. The Swift became its own model in 2004. Currently, the Swift is positioned between Ignis and Baleno in Suzuki&#x27;s global hatchback lineup.

== Predecessors ==
=== International (1983–2003) ===
The Suzuki Swift nameplate began in 1984 as an export name for the Suzuki Cultus, a supermini/subcompact car manufactured and marketed worldwide since 1983 across two generations and three body configurations—three/five-door hatchback, four-door sedan and two-door convertible—and using the Suzuki G engine family.

The Swift was marketed in the Japanese domestic market (JDM) as the Cultus and elsewhere as the Suzuki SA310, Suzuki Swift, Suzuki Forsa, Chevrolet Swift, Chevrolet Sprint/Sprint Metro, Geo Metro, Pontiac Firefly, Maruti 1000, Holden Barina and Subaru Justy. The Swift-badged Cultus ended its production in Hungary in 2003.


=== Japan (2000–2006) ===

In Japan, the Swift nameplate was introduced in 2000 as a replacement for the Suzuki Cultus. Outside Japan, the &quot;Suzuki Ignis&quot; name was used. Both three- and five-door hatchback body styles were offered, although the three-door was not offered as part of the regular lineup in Japan.

The Swift was powered by a new generation of Suzuki inline-four gasoline engines, the M family. Engine displacements of 1.3- and 1.5-liters were offered, both with a five-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed automatic. The vehicle was available with either front- or four-wheel drive. Vehicles fitted with the 1.3-liter engine were designated &quot;HT51S&quot;, with the 1.5-liter version assigned &quot;HT81S&quot;.

The three-door body variant formed the basis of the Swift Sport in Japan, or Ignis Sport in export markets. Introduced in 2003, it featured redesigned bumpers and was fitted with a higher-output version of the 1.5-liter engine, producing . The Sport ceased production in 2005, with the regular Swift (1.3-liter SE-Z trim) remaining until 2006 and sold side by side with the first generation global version Swift since November 2004.

== First generation (RS; 2004) ==
=== RS413/413D/415 ===
The global version of the first generation Swift was debuted at the Paris Motor Show in September 2004. The design of the Swift was previewed on the Concept S and Concept S2 concept cars at auto shows, in the years leading up to its launch. This generation of the Swift marked a significant departure with the previous Cultus-based models, with Suzuki redesigning the vehicle as less of a &quot;low price alternative&quot; subcompact and more of a &quot;sporty&quot; subcompact. The Swift&#x27;s design and driving characteristics focused on the European market with its chassis refined through a road-testing program across Europe.

The first generation Swift has received four stars out of five ratings in the Euro NCAP crash tests. It also was awarded 2006 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland.

Since its global launch in 2005, which was kicked off with a marketing campaign fronted by the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo in many European countries, the Swift has recorded above forecast sales in most markets. In Japan, sales figures reached twice the numbers forecast.

The Swift was available with 1.3- and 1.5-liter gasoline engines, rated at and , respectively. It was produced in Hungary, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan and by Chang&#x27;an Motors in China. In most markets, only the five-door body is available, and a four-wheel drive is an option for the 1.3- and 1.5-liter gasoline engines. A 1.25-liter engine fitted with an automatic continuously variable transmission (CVT) was offered in front-wheel drive only. In Europe, the Swift was launched in three- and five-door hatchback forms, with 1.3- and 1.5-liter gasoline engines, and a 1.25-liter (marketed as 1.3-liter) &quot;DDiS&quot; turbodiesel engine supplied by Fiat. Both the 1.3-liter and 1.5-liter gasoline models are available with four-wheel drive; these models receive the ZD11S and ZD21S chassis numbers.

In Taiwan, Suzuki&#x27;s local partner Prince Motors began building the Swift in September 2005. Only offered with five-door bodywork, it was available in 1.5 GL or GLX trim; the 1.5-liter engine develops , equivalent to . After a falling out over Prince assembling Chinese cars, local assembly of Suzukis by Prince was halted in 2009. Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited started producing the first generation Swift in November 2009 and only available with 1.3-liter M13A gasoline engine and paired with either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmissions. The first generation Swift was discontinued in Pakistan in August 2021.

In Indonesia, the earlier Swift was imported from Japan and from 2007 to 2011, it was assembled locally at Suzuki Indomobil Motor&#x27;s production plant in Bekasi, West Java. It was only offered with a 1.5-liter M15A gasoline engine, mates with either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmissions. There were several special editions with Swift Sport bumpers, sold as GT (2007), GT2 (2009) and GT3 (2010), respectively. There was also a special edition called GTS with body kits launched in July 2009.

The Maruti Suzuki Swift was launched in India on 25 May 2005 with the familiar 1.3-liter SOHC 16-valve G13BB gasoline engine seen in Maruti Esteem. Later, in early 2007, Maruti introduced the Swift with a Fiat-sourced 1.25-liter D13A DDiS turbodiesel engine. In 2010, due to the new BS-IV emission norms, Maruti replaced the 1.3-liter gasoline engine with the more modern 1.2-liter DOHC (later model has VVT) K12M engine.

=== Changan Suzuki Swift ===
Suzuki&#x27;s joint venture in China, Changan Suzuki, started producing Swift for the Chinese domestic market in Chongqing from July 2005. Two gasoline engines were available; 1.3-liter SOHC G13BB engine producing and 1.5-liter DOHC VVT M15A engine producing . Both engines are mated with a 5-speed manual transmission, while the later was available with a 4-speed automatic transmission option. A limited edition Swift with new sporty bumpers called Champion Edition was introduced in June 2010.

While the new generation Swift was prepared for the global market, Changan Suzuki continued producing this generation by giving its first facelift by using Swift Sport bumpers and rear lights in October 2010, skipped the 2007 facelift for the global market model. Suzuki did testing the new generation Swift in China but decided only offered the Japanese imported high performance Swift Sport instead.

The second facelift occurred in 2013 and it has similar front bumper styling as the refreshed second generation Swift.

Sales ended when Suzuki decided to withdraw from Chinese market to focus in India in September 2018. Over 350,000 units Swift were sold in China from 2005 to 2019.

=== Swift Sport (RS416/ZC31S) ===

<doc id="1055028" wikidata="Q700946" url="?curid=1055028" title="Miyako Island">
<text>is the largest and the most populous island among the Miyako Islands of Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Miyako Island is administered as part of the City of Miyako Island, which includes not only Miyako Island, but also five other islands.

==Geography==
Miyako Island lies approximately southwest of Okinawa Island. With an area of , Miyako is the fourth-largest island in Okinawa Prefecture. The island is triangular in shape and is composed of limestone. Miyako Island is subject to drought and is frequently struck by typhoons.
Miyako Island is well known for its beauty, particularly the , a nationally designated Place of Scenic Beauty at the southeasternmost point of Miyako Island. It is considered by many as one of the most beautiful spots in Japan. Other notable locations include Yonaha Maehama beach, Sunayama beach, Painagama Beach and the sights on Irabu-jima. There are three islands nearby which are connected by bridges to Miyako Island, Irabujima (as of early 2015), , and .

Ikema Bridge connects Miyako Island and Ikema Island. It is -long and was completed in February 1992. Yonaha Maehama beach can be viewed from the opposite side on Kurima Island. The Miyako language, one of several Ryukyuan languages spoken there to some degree.

===Climate===
Miyako Island has a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification), because all twelve months have a mean temperature of at least . 



==Culture==
On Miyako Island, Miruku-potoke (the local name for the Maitreya Buddha) is traditionally believed to be an ugly god who arrives from China to create humans, animals, and crops. The handsome god Saku-potoke (the historical Shakyamuni Buddha, founder of Buddhism) then challenges him to a flower contest and steals the flower while the other sleeps. Miruku-potoke is thus defeated and forced to return to China, which is why China is a prosperous country while Miyako is not. Nearly identical creation myths are found in Korea.

Miyako is home to a unique festival called Paantu (パーントゥ), which occurs in the ninth month of the cultural (lunar) calendar. Three men dressed in grass, leaves and mud walk around town smearing the mud on houses, cars and people. They carry sticks in one hand and an expressionless mask in the other. Legend holds that those who have been muddied by the Pantu will have a year of protection and good fortune. Owners of new homes will also invite Pantu to give a muddy &#x27;blessing&#x27; to their homes.

Miyako has its own version of soba. Otōri is a custom of drinking awamori, a distilled beverage native to Okinawa, Japan. It is performed by people sitting (usually around a table). One offers a toast, drinks from a small glass, and then offers some to each person at the table making a round, and usually going to the right. When the toaster makes their way back to their spot, the person who passed the otori before pours them another glass. They then announce &quot;tsunagimasu&quot; and drink their second glass. After a brief interval, it is then the turn of the next person to pass the otori, which continues until the celebration is ended.

==Economy==
Miyako is home to sugarcane cultivation, and produces brown sugar. &quot;Miyako jōfu&quot; is a locally produced hand-woven textile made from ramie fiber. It was formerly known as &quot;Satsuma jōfu&quot;. The textile traces its production to the Tensho period, 1573–92.

A large tourism boom in Miyako, starting with locals and Taiwanese visitors in the early 2010s, has been steadily growing with the annual number of tourists reaching over 1 million in both 2018 and 2019. The city has been struggling to cope with cruise megaships from mainland China– currently, the central port in Hirara can only handle ships as large as 50,000 tons but port officials hope to service ships as large as 200,000 tons. The effects of this growing tourist industry may change the character of the island as its population is small and rural.

==Defense==
The Miyako Strait has strategic significance. Chinese warships&#x27; passage through the straits is monitored by Japanese forces.

In late April 2015, it was confirmed that the Japanese Ministry of Defense was in advanced planning regarding the permanent deployment of a GSDF &quot;security unit&quot; to Miyako Island, to begin sometime in fiscal year 2016. This is part of ongoing efforts to improve the defenses of the Nansei Islands. A GSDF security unit is a battalion sized force, of up to 500 personnel, whose role on Miyako Island will include providing the initial response to large-scale disasters in the area as well as acting as a rapid response force to counterattacks on remote islands within its area of responsibility.

The Miyako Island security unit&#x27;s exact composition is unclear as of April 2015, though given its known taskings, it is likely that the TOE will include both the Komatsu LAV and soft skinned vehicles with all terrain capability.

Consideration is also currently being given to deploying GSDF units equipped with anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles to the island.

Tokyo has currently earmarked ¥21.2 billion yen ($205 million USD) in FY2021 to build new Japan Coast Guard patrol boats and helicopters for the region, with plans to assign 22 ships of over 1,000 tons in the region by 2024. Miyako Island&#x27;s Coast Guard station is home to 9 &quot;Shimoji-class&quot; small patrol vessels and a &quot;Tokara-class&quot; medium patrol vessel.

Positioned in between the larger commercial ports of Ishigaki and Naha, Coast Guard facilities on Miyako&#x27;s neighbor islands can provide 3 &quot;Tsugarus&quot;, a &quot;Kunigami&quot;, and a &quot;Hateruma&quot; class patrol vessel based at the 11th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters in Naha and 11 &quot;Kunigami-class patrol vessels&quot; and 2 &quot;Hateruma-class patrol vessels&quot; homeported at Ishigaki should the need arise. Along with facilities for housing up to 600 crew, Ishigaki is now JCG&#x27;s largest base, surpassing even that of Yokohama.

<doc id="1055053" wikidata="Q473128" url="?curid=1055053" title="Terra Lliure">
<text>Terra Lliure (, &quot;Free Land&quot;), sometimes referred to as TLL, was a far-left, Marxist-Leninist and separatist paramilitary group active in Catalonia, Spain. Formed in 1978, the group carried out hundreds of attacks that left many people injured and five dead (four of them members of the organization after the explosion of the artifact they were manipulating in three separate incidents).

Terra Lliure, became known to the public with a protest at a mass meeting at the Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona in 1981. An important police raid in 1991 and the renunciation of violence by some of the group members led to the dissolution of Terra Lliure in 1995. After disbanding, many members joined the political party Republican Left of Catalonia. During the most active period of its activity it was considered a terrorist organization by Spanish and European courts, Spanish press, and at least parts of the Catalan press.

==Ideology==
Terra Lliure was described as a Marxist, nationalist and a separatist organization that sought to establish an independent Catalan state. Founded during the period of Spanish transition to democracy, Terra Lliure decried what it considered to be a persistence of anti-Catalan discrimination and state violence. It was placed on the far-left fringe of Catalan political forces and sought to be an imitation of Basque Euskadi Ta Askatasuna and became a bridge between Catalan anarchists and nationalists. In its 1981 Declaration of Principles, Terra Lliure described itself as a movement that &quot;fights to defend the land, the language, national sovereignty, the interests of workers and against the Spanishization of Catalan society&quot;.

Similarly to Basque ETA, Terra Lliure was also influenced by the far-left liberation theology and had a faction directly dedicated to it. This is in line with the Basque ETA that Terra Lliure aspired to become a Catalan equivalent of; ETA was founded in the Benedictine seminary in Lazkao and was supported by Basque clergy, which harboured separatist and nationalist tendencies, especially at local level. Pro-ETA Basque priests accepted violent actions of ETA, considering it justified as part of the oppressed people&#x27;s aspiration for freedom and independence. One of the most prominent supporters of ETA amongst the Basque clergy was José María Setién, the Archbishop of San Sebastián. In case of Catalonia, despite the fact that Catalonia was a heavily anti-clerical nation prior to WW2, the nationalist movement became increasingly &quot;Catholicized&quot; between 1940s and 1960s, as the Catholic Church became the only institution that the Francoist regime was unable to persecute for its usage and promotion of the Catalan language. Following Vatican II, Catalan clergy would increasingly emerge as a vocal opponent of the Francoist regime, and many parishes provided refugee and aid to anti-Francoist groups. In 1963, Catalan abbot Aureli Maria Escarré went as far as arguing that the Francoist regime &quot;does not obey the basic principles of Christianity&quot;. The commitment of the Catholic Church to preserve the Catalan language and aid anti-Francoist resistance earned the respect of Catalan Communists who abandoned the traditional Catalan anti-clericalism and instead &quot;began to see the Church as a potential ally&quot;. Terra Lliure sought to continue the link between Catalan socialists and the Catholic clergy, seeing the post-Francoist Spain as merely a continuation of Francoism and its repressive structures.

Politically, Terra Lliure emerged from a split in the Socialist Party of National Liberation (, PSAN), a pro-independence party with a Marxist-Leninist ideology created in 1969 and based in Catalonia and the Valencian Community, and the Independentists of the Catalan Countries (, IPC) party, which emerged in Catalonia and was the result of a split in the PSAN in 1979. In July 1984, the Movement for Defence of the Land (, MDT) was formed, another Catalan pro-independence left-wing party that integrated these two parties and became the political arm of Terra Lliure. Terra Lliure&#x27;s objectives, made explicit and explained in its internal bulletins called Alerta, were: independence, socialism and the reunification of the &quot;Països Catalans&quot;, a cultural entity comprising the Principality of Catalonia, the Valencian Country, the Balearic Islands, as well as its bordering areas (the so-called &quot;Catalunya Nord&quot; to the north and the &quot;Franja&quot; to the west). Terra Lliure argued that only Catalan independence can protect its culture and bring about socialism, while rejecting &quot;autonomismo&quot; (autonomism) and &quot;sucursalismo&quot; (&quot;sectionalism&quot;, a regional political party&#x27;s dependence on the central party).

Despite calling for &quot;Països Catalans&quot;, Terra Lliure envisioned that Greater Catalonia would be further separated, either through federalization or subsequent separatism, into regions &quot;with different languages&quot;, with the Valencian language being cited as an example. According to Terra Lliure, these languages were forced to communicate in Spanish, and Spanish assimilationist policies resulted in fragmentation of Catalan society, where the &quot;Catalan working people&quot; (&quot;poble treballador català&quot;) were now alienated in their own homeland by privileged Spanish speakers. In its program, Terra Lliure also decried the decline of traditional Catalan industries, environmental destruction, and state-sanctioned repression. Through this, the organization also had protectionist, environmentalist and anarchist overtones (with anarchism being represented by some of the factions within Terra Lliure). It also called for the defence of Catalan territory, language and national sovereignty from &quot;espanyolistas&quot; and anti-nationalist, along with &quot;protecting the interests of workers&quot; against &quot;the forces of occupation&quot;.

In a 1982 letter released by Terra Lliure, the organization wrote: &quot;Ever since the French and Spanish states conquered the Països Catalans, we have walked towards our destruction as a people.&quot; Terra Lliure described Catalonia as &quot;subject to continued aggression from the Spanish and French oligarchies and the regional bourgeoise, that endanger everything that constitutes our national heritage: land, work, language, customs. Not only do they call into question our national identity, but also our survival as [the] people who [make up] Catalan society.&quot; Terra Lliure argued that class and national liberation were inextricable from each other and could only be achieved through armed struggle. The party accused Spain of &quot;attempted annihilation of the Catalan nation&quot; and warned of the loss of national consciousness and replacement of Catalan cultures through the hegemonic culture of Spain. It warned that disappearance of Catala language from public use meant that the &quot;Catalan culture was reduced to catacombs&quot;. Terra Lliure also argued that democratized Spain continues &quot;attempts at cultural and national genocide&quot; and stated its belief that the prevalence of Spanish language in Catalonia must be prevented and fought against, writing: &quot;We do not accept the existence of two communities or two languages as a perpetual fact, as this can only lead to the disappearance of our language and our community and to an artificial division of our working people.&quot;

==History==
In the 1960s, a new generation of anti-Franco activists reshaped Catalanism and separatism. In 1968, the Socialist Party of National Liberation (, PSAN) was founded, which combined Marxist revolutionary ideology with Catalan separatism. PSAN took anti-colonial struggles and third-world anti-imperialist nationalism as its model for Catalan separatism. The party grew increasingly divided during the Spanish transition of democracy, with many left-wing radical, revolutional socialist, but also moderate and reformist currents emerging. Terra Liure was founded in 1978 by a small faction of PSAN that endorsed violent tactics despite the end of Francoism, arguing that a &quot;symbolic&quot; damage is necessary in order to assist and bring about national and class liberation.

As small Catalan terrorist cells coalesced around Terra Liure and started its activities in 1979, the movement struggled with lack of support and popularity as the sociopolitical conditions were no longer favorable to violent tactics. The exiled regional government of Catalonia officially returned in late 1977 and was the transitional Catalan government until the 1980 Catalan regional election. Unlike in Basque Country, in Catalonia voters overwhelmingly approved of the new constitution in 1978, with 61% voting in favour with a turnout of 68% - in comparison, only 31% of Basque voters voted in favour with a turnout of 45%. The 1979 Spanish local elections showed that the Catalan movement had great potential to become a powerful force in Spanish politics and take power in the upcoming regional elections, leading many Catalan nationalists to embrace reformist and Spanish democracy. The Catalan statute of autonomy also proved popular, with 53% of voters supporting it in October 1979 (with a 60% turnout).

In the 1980 Catalan elections, the centrist Convergence and Union (CiU) unexpectedly won with 28% of the vote, ahead of the socialist PSC and communist PSUC. This allowed Terra Lliure to gain some support for its tactics and to escalate violence as radical nationalists grew disillusioned with CiU governments, resulting in some support for terrorism. The foundation of the Movement for Defence of the Land in 1984 marked the best period in the history of Terra Lliure, as a known political front and terrorist organization shifted towards more radical actions. The organization was then severely weakened in late 1985 as its leadership was arrested and its political front suffered splits along strategic issue. The separatist Republican Left of Catalonia (, ERC) also attracted the members of Terra Lliure into its ranks by negotiationg individual solutions for jailed activists, resulting in separatist voters and militants embracing ERC, which became the third largest party in Catalan parliament.

In May 1981, Terra Lliure kidnapped Spanish cultural activist and teacher Federico Jiménez Losantos who helped organizing and then signed the Manifesto of the 2,300, which decried legal protections given to the Catalan language. The manifesto alleged that Spanish speakers are discriminated against in Catalonia, and warned against &quot;Catalanization&quot; of Catalan schools and public spaces. After verifying his identity and locating him, Terra Lliure members tied Jiménez to a tree and shot him in the knee, but allowed him to be rescued. Terra Lliure called their attack a &quot;retaliation for activities against the Catalan language&quot;.

Despite struggling to gain widespread approval for its radical militancy amongst the Catalan public before, Terra Lliure&#x27;s attack on Jiménez was not met with outrage as the overwhelming majority of Catalans were strongly critical of the Manifesto of the 2,300 signed and organized by Jiménez. The Catalan public vehemently rejected the claim that Spanish speakers were discriminated against, and Catalan newspapers unanimously condemned the manifesto. The University of Barcelona organized a counter-declaration &quot;in defense of the Catalan language, culture, and nation&quot;, which was endorsed by over 1300 Catalan institutions and voluntary associations. This sparked the foundation of a Catalan organization Crida a la Solidaritat en Defensa de la Llengua which organized a rally at Camp Nou in June 1981, with the slogan “Som una nació” (). The rally had around 100,000 attenders and sparked a political and cultural movement in favor of Catalanization and Catalan autonomy, and against Spanish centralization. Terra Lliure also attended the event and distributed its leaflets, gaining recognition and new recruits.

In the autumn of 1982, in September and November, the first assembly was held in the south of France. It established the strategy of &quot;armed propaganda&quot; to achieve its objectives, consisting of violent actions, not with the intention of causing personal injury, but rather with the aim of provoking fear and intimidation, as well as seeking maximum media coverage. In its documents, the Terra Lliure organisation always described its activity as &quot;armed propaganda&quot;. This concept was used as a euphemism to express the low intensity of the organisation&#x27;s actions, implying that it did not seek to attack human lives or carry out indiscriminate armed actions. Shortly after this assembly, the police discovered a cache of explosives and weapons in the Collserola mountain range outside Barcelona, which led to the imprisonment of Terra Lliure members Carles Benítez and Xavier Monton. These arrests provoked a crisis in the organisation&#x27;s leadership that led to the expulsion of some dissident militants who questioned the armed route as a tool for political and social change.

The third assembly was held in July 1988, at which Terra Lliure&#x27;s leadership wanted to assess the social support that the organisation really had in Catalan society. It also approved a plan of action in view of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, which was not approved by all members of the organisation due to the deep crisis that already existed within the Catalan pro-independence movement and which led the organisation to enter a period of less combativeness from the 1990s onwards, carrying out very few armed actions. The year 1987 was a turning point because of the actions of ETA and Terra Lliure itself - that year, Terra Lliure caused its only civilian fatality in an attack on 10 September 1987, when the explosion of a device in the courthouse in Les Borges Blanques (Lleida) caused a wall of an adjacent house to collapse, killing a 62-year-old woman, Emilia Aldomà, who was sleeping at the time. The second reason was the attack by Basque ETA in the garage of the Hipercor shopping centre in a predominantly working-class neighbourhood of Barcelona on 19 June 1987, which killed 21 people and injured 45, making it the bloodiest attack in the history of ETA and the second most serious in the history of Spain after the attack of 11 March 2004 in Madrid. The Hipercor attack, together with the subsequent attack on the Civil Guard barracks in Vic (Osona) on 29 May 1991, in which 10 people died, had a double effect for Terra Lliure. ETA&#x27;s car bombings made it increasingly difficult to continue justifying the &#x27;armed struggle&#x27; and reduced social and political support for home-grown violence.

Reflecting on the failure of the organization, Terra Lliure leader Jaume Fernàndez argued that a resilient Catalanist challenge to Spanish government was dependent on the nationalist constituency turning away from the transition process. Because most nationalist Catalans remained loyal to the new regime and trusted the electoral process, Terra Lliure was unable to gain strength. In 1991, Terra Lliure announced a ceasefire with the Spanish government and stated that its members would join the Catalan Republican Left to fight for independent Catalonia through non-violent means. Despite this, the Spanish government continued to hunt members of the organization, and Spanish authorities organized Operation Garzón in 1992, a preventine manhunt that was criticized for human rights activists for &quot;indiscriminate arrests and extensive tortures that brought back the ghost of Francoist repression in Catalan society&quot;. Terra Lliure was officially disbanded in 1995, and most of its former members joined the ERC. On 8 March 1996, the Spanish government pardoned the 18 members convicted in the 1995 trial and ordered their immediate release from prison.

===1978–1990===
Most of Terra Lliure&#x27;s original members converged into the group around 1980, arriving from other armed organizations such as the &quot;Catalan People&#x27;s Army&quot; (EPOCA), the &quot;Catalan Liberation Front&quot; (FAC) or political organizations such as the &quot;Socialist Party of National Liberation&quot; (PSAN) and Catalan Countries&#x27; Independentists. In 1979, Terra Lliure started its armed activities and two of its members died that year, one in a shootout with Civil Guard members and another one blew up himself.

Terra Lliure&#x27;s best known action was the kidnapping of journalist Federico Jiménez Losantos on 21 May 1981 in Barcelona, for having signed the &quot;Manifesto of the 2,300&quot;. This manifesto was a document signed by more than 2,300 intellectuals and professionals living and working in Catalonia and published on 25 January 1981. In it, they defended the co-official status of Catalan and Spanish as the vehicular languages of public education in Catalonia; expressed their concern about the exclusive use of Catalan as the &quot;only official language&quot;; and criticised the policy of the Catalan government to progressively introduce education only in Catalan. After being shot in the knee by Terra Lliure member Pere Bascompte and left tied to a tree, Jiménez Losantos was found by the police the same day. In June, the group published its first statement, called &quot;Free Land Calling&quot;, in a mass meeting at the Camp Nou stadium.

In 1982, Terra Lliure held its first assembly, while it continued its armed campaign against Spanish and French interests, bank offices and other administrations. A second assembly was held in 1984 and the group started publishing official statements and claimed actions that they carried out through the Alerta magazine. In 1985 and 1985, two more members died while carrying explosive devices.

Between 1984 and 1989 some of Terra Lliure&#x27;s leaders were arrested, nevertheless the group maintained its structure and capacities and a parallel political movement was developing, the &quot;Solidarity Committee with the Catalan Patriots&quot; (CSPC) and the &quot;Movement for the Defense of the Land&quot; (MDT). During these years, starting from 1985, both the MDT and Terra Lliure would receive bomb attacks from &quot;Milícia Catalana&quot; (MC), a right-wing Spanish nationalist armed group. In 1987, the group committed its only killing, with a bomb attack in Les Borges Blanques, Lleida. Terra Lliure admitted the killing was an error. The group also committed several attacks, mainly against American interests, together with the Catalan Red Liberation Army. In 1988, Terra Lliure held its third assembly and developed three documents to describe the theoretical framework and analyze the social reality of the Catalan National Liberation Movement.

===1991–1995===
In July 1991, Terra Lliure announced it was declaring a ceasefire and that some of its members would start joining the Republican Left of Catalonia. Despite that, some cells kept carrying out attacks, especially due to the proximity to the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992. Also in 1991, a former member of Terra Lliure, who had joined ETA, was killed in a police raid after a bomb attack in Vic, Barcelona.

In July 1992, under an order of judge Baltasar Garzón, police arrested around 40 of members of the group. Years later, the European Court of Human Rights ordered the Spanish government to compensate some of the arrested people for failing to investigate allegations of torture during the raid. The following years, the group did not commit any attack and announced its dissolution on the 1995 National Day of Catalonia.

<doc id="1055069" wikidata="Q7096825" url="?curid=1055069" title="Operation Blowdown">
<text>Operation Blowdown was an explosives test carried out in the Kutini-Payamu jungle of Australia&#x27;s Cape York Peninsula in 1963, to simulate the effects of a nuclear weapon on tropical rainforest. It was conducted by the Australian Army, the Department of Supply, and the Defence Standards Laboratory with participation from the United Kingdom, Canada and United States. In addition, blast effects on military material, field fortifications, supply points, and foot and vehicle movement were examined in a rainforest environment.

A spherical charge of of TNT was detonated on a tower above ground level and above the rainforest canopy. After the explosion, troops were moved through the area (which was now covered in up to a metre of leaf litter), to test their ability to transit across the debris. In addition, obsolete vehicles and equipment left near the centre of the explosion were destroyed.

Although never officially stated, there is speculation that the test intended to determine the feasibility of using nuclear weapons in clearing the jungles of Vietnam, at a time of Australia&#x27;s increasing involvement in the Vietnam war starting in 1962.

United States participation included the establishment of pressure measurement equipment and the loan of photographic and instrumentation equipment, some of which had been used in the 1962 Project Plowshare.

==Preparations==

The construction of the base camp and test area was provided in part by the 24th Construction Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers. At ground zero, a straight sided tower was constructed to suspend a sphere of TNT charges. The charges were tins of 41 pounds of remelted and cast TNT from 155-mm shells. The final sphere contained a total of 2,438 TNT and 70 CE/TNT booster canisters resting on 408 support blocks with a diameter of approximately . Extreme care needed to be taken during construction since damage or air gaps might have caused jetting or deformation of the blast wave.

The section of rainforest selected was typical of North Queensland and contained 70 different tree species of varying sizes. Four lanes centred on the tower were set up with instrumentation and one 200-foot wide lane was cleared of vegetation except for select trees to study the impact with varying distances from ground zero. Furthermore, approximately 17,000 trees were catalogued to determine the effects of the blast. Military equipment including light and heavy weapons, mortar pits, ammunition, trenches, aerial masts, wireless communication equipment and cables were also positioned around the blast site, complete with simulated troops.

==Blast effects==
At 8:30 am Eastern Australian time, were detonated flattening a considerable area of the test site. Observers were located on a nearby hill away and above ground zero. Destruction was total within , severe within and stopped around . The effects of overpressure are summarized by the following table. For reference, 5.0 psi is enough to destroy city areas while instruments at the blast site recorded 83 psi at approximately . To understand the destructive forces, such an overpressure would correspond to wind speeds greater than , and would be equivalent to a 1.0 megaton blast at . This also helps in understanding how a test of 50 tons could be used to evaluate nuclear weapons which may be in the kiloton and megaton ranges by reducing the distance to ground zero for greater effect.

<doc id="1055072" wikidata="Q175036" url="?curid=1055072" title="Guernica (Picasso)">
<text>Guernica is a large 1937 oil painting by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. It is one of his best-known works, regarded by many art critics as the most moving and powerful anti-war painting in history. It is exhibited in the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid.

The grey, black, and white painting, on a canvas tall and across, portrays the suffering wrought by violence and chaos. Prominently featured in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, a dead baby, a dismembered soldier, and flames.

Picasso painted &quot;Guernica&quot; at his home in Paris in response to the 26 April 1937 bombing of Guernica, a town in the Basque Country in northern Spain, by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Upon completion, &quot;Guernica&quot; was exhibited at the Spanish pavilion at the 1937 Paris International Exposition and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief. The painting soon became widely acclaimed, helping to bring worldwide attention to the Spanish Civil War that took place from 1936 to 1939.

It is widely thought that Surrealist photographer and anti-fascist activist Dora Maar, Picasso&#x27;s romantic partner at the time, had a significant influence on the style and politicized theme of &quot;Guernica&quot;. Unlike Picasso, Maar was deeply involved in left-wing political activism when they met. Amar Gallery owner states, “She ­influenced Picasso to paint &quot;Guernica&quot; – he had never entered political painting before,”. Additionally, as a photographer, Dora Maar introduced Picasso to darkroom techniques during the year he created &quot;Guernica&quot;. Her oeuvre of black-and-white photography likely influenced his decision to forgo his characteristic use of color, rendering &quot;Guernica&quot; in stark monochrome.

==Commission==
In January 1937, while Pablo Picasso was living in Paris on Rue des Grands Augustins, he was commissioned by the Spanish Republican government to create a large artwork for the Spanish pavilion at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne, a 1937 Paris International Exposition. Picasso, who had last visited Spain in 1934 and would never return, was the Honorary Director-in-Exile of the Prado Museum.

Picasso worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April on the project&#x27;s initial sketches, which depicted his perennial theme of an artist&#x27;s studio. Then, immediately upon hearing reports of the 26 April bombing of Guernica, poet Juan Larrea visited Picasso&#x27;s home to urge him to make the bombing his subject. Days later, on 1 May, Picasso read George Steer&#x27;s eyewitness account of the attack, which originally had been published in both &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 28 April, and abandoned his initial idea. Acting on Larrea&#x27;s suggestion, Picasso began sketching a series of preliminary drawings for &quot;Guernica&quot;.

==Historical context==
===Bombing of 26 April 1937===

During the Spanish Civil War the Republican forces, made up of communists, socialists, anarchists, and others with differing goals, united in their opposition to the Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco, who sought to establish a fascist dictatorship. The Nationalists perceived Guernica, a quiet village in the province of Biscay in Basque Country, as the northern bastion of the Republican resistance movement and the center of Basque culture.

On Monday, 26 April 1937, warplanes of the Nazi Germany Condor Legion, commanded by Colonel Wolfram von Richthofen, bombed Guernica for about two hours. In his 30 April 1937 journal entry von Richthofen noted that when the squadron arrived &quot;there was smoke everywhere&quot; from the attack by three aircraft, and since nobody could see the roads, bridges, and suburbs &quot;they just dropped everything right into the center. The 250s toppled a number of houses and destroyed the water mains. The incendiaries now could spread and become effective. The materials of the houses: tile roofs, wooden porches, and half-timbering resulted in complete annihilation.&quot;

Monday was Guernica&#x27;s market day, and since most of its men were away fighting on behalf of the Republicans, at the time of the bombing the town was populated mostly by women and children, many of whom were congregated in the center of town. When the main bombardment began the roads were already full of debris and the bridges leading out of town destroyed, and the residents were unable to escape.

Guernica, the capital of Biscay, was 10 kilometers from the front lines and in-between the front lines and Bilbao. A Republican retreat towards Bilbao, or an advance towards it, had to pass through Guernica. Richthofen&#x27;s 26 April 1937 diary entry states the town was targeted &quot;...to halt and disrupt the Red withdrawal which has to pass through here.&quot; The following day, Richthofen wrote in his diary, &quot;Guernica burning&quot;. The nearest military target, a war product factory on Guernica&#x27;s outskirts, went through the attack unscathed, so the attack was widely condemned as a terror bombing.

===Aftermath===

&quot;The Times&quot; journalist George Steer propelled this event onto the international scene, and brought it to Pablo Picasso&#x27;s attention, in an eyewitness account published on 28 April in both &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. On the 29th it appeared in &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;. Steer wrote:

Picasso lived in Paris during its World War II German occupation. A widely repeated story is that a German officer saw a photo of &quot;Guernica&quot; in Picasso&#x27;s apartment and asked, &quot;Did you do that?&quot;, and Picasso responded, &quot;No, you did.&quot;

Referring to Picasso&#x27;s painting, art theorist Rudolf Arnheim writes:

==Creation and the influence of Dora Maar on the painting==

Dora Maar found a large enough studio for Picasso to paint &quot;Guernica&quot; in. Through her connections in the left-wing community, she gained access to a space on Rue des Grands-Augustins, near Notre-Dame. This building had previously served as the headquarters of the ‘Contre-Attaque’ group, of which Maar was a dedicated member. Having listened to anti-fascist speeches there, she recognized it as the ideal location for Picasso&#x27;s monumental protest artwork. Not only did she find the studio large enough for Picasso to paint &quot;Guernica&quot; in, she also had exclusive access to photograph the work in progress.

“Maar’s practice of photography influenced the art of Picasso – she had a great influence on his work,” said Antoine Romand, a Dora Maar expert. “She contested him. She pushed him to do something new and to be more creative politically. Some argue that Picasso borrowed from Maar&#x27;s photographic oeuvre by painting &quot;Guernica&quot; in stark black and white, which was a departure from his usual colorful style. At Picasso’s request, Maar painted part of the dying horse in &quot;Guernica&quot;. Maar accompanied Picasso in the studio, giving her the opportunity to observe each phase of &quot;Guernica&quot;’s creation over 36 days. While Picasso painted, she took photographs, turning Picasso into her photographic subject. Scholars and art critics argue that the black and white photographic style of the painting can be attributed to Maar&#x27;s own black and white photographs, in stark contrast to Picasso&#x27;s usual colorful style.

&quot;Guernica&quot; was painted using a matte house paint specially formulated at Picasso&#x27;s request to have the least possible gloss. American artist John Ferren assisted him in preparing the monumental canvas, and photographer Dora Maar, who had been working with Picasso since mid-1936 photographing his studio and teaching him the technique of cameraless photography, documented its creation. Apart from their documentary and publicity value, Maar&#x27;s photographs &quot;helped Picasso to eschew color and give the work the black-and-white immediacy of a photograph&quot;, according to art historian John Richardson.

Picasso, who rarely allowed strangers into his studio to watch him work, admitted influential visitors to observe his progress on &quot;Guernica&quot;, believing that the publicity would help the antifascist cause. As his work on the mural progressed, Picasso explained: &quot;The Spanish struggle is the fight of reaction against the people, against freedom. My whole life as an artist has been nothing more than a continuous struggle against reaction and the death of art. How could anybody think for a moment that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ... In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call &quot;Guernica&quot;, and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death.&quot;

Picasso worked on the painting for 35 days, and finished it on 4 June 1937.

==Composition==

The scene occurs within a large room. On the left, a wide-eyed bull, with a tail suggesting rising flame and smoke as if seen through a window, stands over a grieving woman holding a dead child in her arms. The woman&#x27;s head is thrown back and her mouth is wide open. A horse falls in agony in the center of the room, with a large gaping hole in its side, as if it had just been run through by a spear or javelin. The horse appears to be wearing chain mail armor, decorated with vertical tally marks arranged in rows.

A dead and dismembered soldier lies under the horse. The hand of his severed right arm grasps a shattered sword, from which a flower grows. The open palm of his left hand contains a stigma, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the stigmata of Christ. A bare light bulb in the shape of an all-seeing eye blazes over the suffering horse&#x27;s head.

To the horse&#x27;s upper right a frightened woman&#x27;s head and extended right arm reach through a window. As she witnesses the scene she carries a flame-lit lamp in her right hand, and holds it near the bare bulb. Below her a woman in shock staggers from the right towards the center while looking into the blazing light bulb with a blank stare.

Daggers that suggest screaming have replaced the tongues of the horse, the bull, and the grieving woman. To the bull&#x27;s right a dove appears on a cracked wall through which bright light from the outside shines.

On the far right of the room there is a fourth woman, her arms raised in terror. Her wide-open mouth and thrown back head echo the grieving woman&#x27;s. She is entrapped by fire from above and below, her right hand suggesting the shape of an airplane.

A dark wall with an open door defines the right side of the room.

A &quot;hidden&quot; image formed by the horse appears in &quot;Guernica&quot;: the horse&#x27;s nostrils and upper teeth can be seen as a human skull facing left and slightly downward.

Another hidden image is of a bull that appears to gore the horse from underneath. The bull&#x27;s head is formed mainly by the horse&#x27;s entire front leg which has the knee on the ground. The leg&#x27;s knee-cap forms the head&#x27;s nose. A horn appears within the horse&#x27;s breast.

==Symbolism and interpretations==
Interpretations of &quot;Guernica&quot; vary widely and contradict one another. This extends, for example, to the mural&#x27;s two dominant elements: the bull and the horse. Art historian Patricia Failing said, &quot;The bull and the horse are important characters in Spanish culture. Picasso himself certainly used these characters to play many different roles over time. This has made the task of interpreting the specific meaning of the bull and the horse very tough. Their relationship is a kind of ballet that was conceived in a variety of ways throughout Picasso&#x27;s career.&quot;

When pressed to explain the elements in &quot;Guernica&quot;, Picasso said,

In &quot;The Dream and Lie of Franco&quot;, a series of narrative sketches Picasso also created for the World&#x27;s Fair, Franco is depicted as a monster that first devours his own horse and later does battle with an angry bull. Work on these illustrations began before the bombing of Guernica, and four additional panels were added, three of which relate directly to the Guernica mural.

According to scholar Beverly Ray, the following list of interpretations reflects the general consensus of historians: &quot;The shape and posture of the bodies express protest&quot;; &quot;Picasso uses black, white, and grey paint to set a somber mood and express pain and chaos&quot;; &quot;flaming buildings and crumbling walls not only express the destruction of Guernica, but reflect the destructive power of civil war&quot;; &quot;the newspaper print used in the painting reflects how Picasso learned of the massacre&quot;; &quot;The light bulb in the painting represents the sun&quot;; and &quot;The broken sword near the bottom of the painting symbolizes the defeat of the people at the hand of their tormentors&quot;.

Alejandro Escalona said, &quot;The chaos unfolding seems to happen in closed quarters provoking an intense feeling of oppression. There is no way out of the nightmarish cityscape. The absence of color makes the violent scene developing right before your eyes even more horrifying. The blacks, whites, and grays startle you—especially because you are used to see war images broadcast live and in high-definition right to your living room.&quot;

In drawing attention to a number of preliminary studies, the so-called primary project, that show an atelier installation incorporating the central triangular shape which reappears in the final version of &quot;Guernica&quot;, Becht-Jördens and Wehmeier interpret the painting as a self-referential composition in the tradition of atelier paintings such as &quot;Las Meninas&quot; by Diego Velázquez. In his &quot;chef d&#x27;oeuvre&quot;, Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, &quot;Guernica&quot; should be seen as Picasso&#x27;s comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, violence and death.

==Exhibition==
===1937 Paris International Exhibition===
&quot;Guernica&quot; was unveiled and initially exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris International Exposition, where Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union had huge pavilions. The Pavilion, which was financed by the Spanish Republican government at the time of civil war, was built to exhibit the Spanish government&#x27;s struggle for existence contrary to the Exposition&#x27;s technology theme. The Pavilion&#x27;s entrance presented an enormous photographic mural of Republican soldiers accompanied by the slogan:

: We are fighting for the essential unity of Spain.
: We are fighting for the integrity of Spanish soil.
: We are fighting for the independence of our country and for the right of the Spanish people to determine their own destiny.

The display of &quot;Guernica&quot; was accompanied by the poem &quot;The Victory of Guernica&quot; by Paul Éluard, and the pavilion displayed &quot;The Reaper&quot; by Joan Miró and &quot;Mercury Fountain&quot; by Alexander Calder, both of whom were sympathetic to the Republican cause.

At &quot;Guernica&quot;″s Paris Exhibition unveiling it garnered little attention. The public&#x27;s reaction to the painting was mixed. Max Aub, one of the officials in charge of the Spanish pavilion, was compelled to defend the work against a group of Spanish officials who objected to the mural&#x27;s modernist style and sought to replace it with a more traditional painting that was also commissioned for the exhibition, &quot;Madrid 1937 (Black Aeroplanes)&quot; by Horacio Ferrer de Morgado. Some Marxist groups criticized Picasso&#x27;s painting as lacking in political commitment, and faulted it for not offering a vision of a better future. In contrast, Morgado&#x27;s painting was a great success with Spanish Communists and with the public. The art critic Clement Greenberg was also critical of &quot;Guernica&quot;, and in a later essay he termed the painting &quot;jerky&quot; and &quot;too compressed for its size&quot;, and compared it unfavorably to the &quot;magnificently lyrical&quot; &quot;The Charnel House&quot; (1944–1948), a later antiwar painting by Picasso.

Among the painting&#x27;s admirers were art critic Jean Cassou and poet José Bergamín, both of whom praised the painting as quintessentially Spanish. Michel Leiris perceived in &quot;Guernica&quot; a foreshadowing: &quot;On a black and white canvas that depicts ancient tragedy ... Picasso also writes our letter of doom: all that we love is going to be lost...&quot; Jean Cocteau also praised the painting and declared it a cross that &quot;[General] Franco would always carry on his shoulder.&quot;

Possibly as a riposte to Picasso&#x27;s painting, the Nazis in June or July 1937 commissioned their official war artist Claus Bergen to produce a patriotic painting of &quot;The Bombardment of Almeria by the &#x27;Admiral Scheer&quot;&#x27; (National Maritime Museum, London). The work, done in a realistic style, was completed quickly for display in the Great German Art Exhibition in Munich, 1937.

===European tour===
&quot;Guernica&quot;, for which Picasso was paid 150,000 francs for his costs by the Spanish Republican government, was one of the few major paintings that Picasso did not sell directly to his exclusive contracted art dealer and friend, Paul Rosenberg. However, after its exhibition Rosenberg organised a four-man extravaganza Scandinavian tour of 118 works by Picasso, Matisse, Braque, and Henri Laurens. The tour&#x27;s main attraction was &quot;Guernica&quot;.

From January to April 1938 the tour visited Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Göteborg. Starting in late September &quot;Guernica&quot; was exhibited in London&#x27;s Whitechapel Art Gallery. This stop was organized by Sir Roland Penrose with Labour Party leader Clement Attlee, and the painting arrived in London on 30 September, the same day the Munich Agreement was signed by the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. It then travelled to Leeds, Liverpool, and, in early 1939, Manchester. There, Manchester Foodship For Spain, a group of artists and activists engaged in sending aid to the people of Spain, exhibited the painting in the HE Nunn &amp; Co Ford automobile showroom for two weeks. &quot;Guernica&quot; then returned briefly to France.

===American tour===
After Francisco Franco&#x27;s victory in Spain, &quot;Guernica&quot; was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. It was first shown at the Valentine Gallery in New York City in May 1939. The San Francisco Museum of Art (later renamed the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) gave the work its first museum appearance in the United States from 27 August to 19 September 1939. New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) then mounted an exhibition from 15 November until 7 January 1940, entitled: &quot;Picasso: 40 Years of His Art&quot;. The exhibition, which was organized by MoMA&#x27;s director Alfred H. Barr in collaboration with the Art Institute of Chicago, contained 344 works, including &quot;Guernica&quot; and its studies.

At Picasso&#x27;s request the safekeeping of &quot;Guernica&quot; was then entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art, and it was his expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country. Between 1939 and 1952, &quot;Guernica&quot; traveled extensively in the United States. Between 1941 and 1942, it was exhibited at Harvard University&#x27;s Fogg Museum twice.

Between 1953 and 1956 it was shown in Brazil, then at the first Picasso retrospective in Milan, Italy, and then in numerous other major European cities before returning to MoMA for a retrospective celebrating Picasso&#x27;s 75th birthday. It then went to Chicago and Philadelphia. By this time, concern for the state of the painting resulted in a decision to keep it in one place: a room on MoMA&#x27;s third floor, where it was accompanied by several of Picasso&#x27;s preliminary studies and some of Dora Maar&#x27;s photographs of the work in progress. The studies and photos were often loaned for other exhibitions, but until 1981, &quot;Guernica&quot; itself remained at MoMA.

During the Vietnam War, the room containing the painting became the site of occasional anti-war vigils. These were usually peaceful and uneventful, but on 28 February 1974, Tony Shafrazi—ostensibly protesting Second Lieutenant William Calley&#x27;s petition for habeas corpus following his indictment and sentencing for the murder of 109 Vietnamese civilians during the My Lai massacre—defaced the painting with red spray paint, painting the words &quot;KILL LIES ALL&quot;. The paint was removed with relative ease from the varnished surface.

==Establishment in Spain==
As early as 1968, Franco had expressed an interest in having &quot;Guernica&quot; come to Spain. However, Picasso refused to allow this until the Spanish people again enjoyed a republic. He later added other conditions, such as the restoration of &quot;public liberties and democratic institutions&quot;. Picasso died in 1973. Franco, ten years Picasso&#x27;s junior, died two years later, in 1975. After Franco&#x27;s death, Spain was transformed into a democratic constitutional monarchy, ratified by a new constitution in 1978. However, MoMA was reluctant to give up one of its greatest treasures and argued that a monarchy did not represent the republic that had been stipulated in Picasso&#x27;s will as a condition for the painting&#x27;s delivery. Under great pressure from a number of observers, MoMA finally ceded the painting to Spain in 1981. The Spanish historian Javier Tusell was one of the negotiators.

Upon its arrival in Spain in September 1981, it was first displayed behind bomb-and bullet-proof glass screens at the Casón del Buen Retiro in Madrid in time to celebrate the centenary of Picasso&#x27;s birth, 25 October. The exhibition was visited by almost a million people in the first year. Since that time there has never been any attempted vandalism or other security threat to the painting.

In 1992, the painting was moved from the Museo del Prado to a purpose-built gallery at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, both in Madrid, along with about two dozen preparatory works. This action was controversial in Spain, since Picasso&#x27;s will stated that the painting should be displayed at the Prado. However, the move was part of a transfer of all of the Prado&#x27;s collections of art after the early 19th century to other nearby buildings in the city for reasons of space; the Reina Sofía, which houses the capital&#x27;s national collection of 20th-century art, was the natural place to move it to.
At the Reina Sofía, the painting has roughly the same protection as any other work.

Basque nationalists have advocated that the picture be brought to the Basque Country, especially after the building of the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum. Officials at the Reina Sofía claim that the canvas is now thought to be too fragile to move. Even the staff of the Guggenheim do not see a permanent transfer of the painting as possible, although the Basque government continues to support the possibility of a temporary exhibition in Bilbao.

==Tapestry at the United Nations==

A full-size tapestry copy of Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;, by Jacqueline de la Baume Dürrbach, hangs at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City at the entrance to the Security Council room. It is less monochromatic than the original and uses several shades of brown.

The &quot;Guernica&quot; tapestry was first displayed from 1985 to 2009, and returned in 2015. Originally commissioned in 1955 by Nelson Rockefeller, since Picasso refused to sell him the original, the tapestry was placed on loan to the United Nations by the Rockefeller estate in 1985.

On 5 February 2003 a large blue curtain was placed to cover over the work at the UN, so that it would not be visible in the background during press conferences by Colin Powell and John Negroponte as they were arguing in favor of war on Iraq. On the following day, UN officials claimed that the curtain was placed there at the request of television news crews, who had complained that the wild lines and screaming figures made for a bad backdrop, and that a horse&#x27;s hindquarters appeared just above the faces of any speakers. Some diplomats, however, in talks with journalists claimed that the Bush administration pressured UN officials to cover the tapestry, rather than have it in the background while Powell or other US diplomats argued for war on Iraq. In a critique of the covering, columnist Alejandro Escalona hypothesized that &quot;Guernica&quot;″s &quot;unappealing ménage of mutilated bodies and distorted faces proved to be too strong for articulating to the world why the US was going to war in Iraq&quot;, while referring to the work as &quot;an inconvenient masterpiece&quot;.

On 17 March 2009, Deputy Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Marie Okabe announced that the &quot;Guernica&quot; tapestry had been moved to a gallery in London in advance of extensive renovations at UN Headquarters. The &quot;Guernica&quot; tapestry was the showcase piece for the grand reopening of the Whitechapel Gallery. It was located in the &#x27;Guernica room&#x27; which was originally part of the old Whitechapel Library. In 2012 the tapestry was on loan from the Rockefeller family to the San Antonio Museum of Art in San Antonio, Texas. It was returned to the UN by March 2015. Nelson A. Rockefeller Jr., the owner of the tapestry, took it back in February 2021. In February 2022, it was returned to the wall outside the UN Security Council.

==Significance and legacy==

During the 1970s, &quot;Guernica&quot; was a symbol for Spaniards of both the end of the Franco regime following Franco&#x27;s death and of Basque nationalism. The Basque left has repeatedly used imagery from the picture. An example is the organization Etxerat, which uses a reversed image of the lamp as its symbol. &quot;Guernica&quot; has since become a universal and powerful symbol warning humanity against the suffering and devastation of war. There are no obvious references to the specific attack, making its message universal and timeless.

Art historian and curator W. J. H. B. Sandberg argued in &quot;Daedalus&quot; in 1960 that Picasso pioneered a &quot;new language&quot; combining expressionistic and cubist techniques in &quot;Guernica&quot;. Sandberg wrote that &quot;Guernica&quot; conveyed an “expressionistic message” in its focus on the inhumanity of the air raid, while using &quot;the language of cubism&quot;. For Sandberg, the work&#x27;s defining cubist features included its use of diagonals, which rendered the painting&#x27;s setting &quot;ambiguous, unreal, inside and outside at the same time&quot;. In 2016, the British art critic Jonathan Jones called the painting a &quot;Cubist apocalypse&quot; and stated that Picasso &quot;was trying to show the truth so viscerally and permanently that it could outstare the daily lies of the age of dictators&quot;.

Works inspired by &quot;Guernica&quot; include Faith Ringgold&#x27;s 1967 painting &quot;The American People Series #20: Die&quot;; Goshka Macuga&#x27;s &quot;The Nature of the Beast&quot; (2009–2010), which used the Whitechapel-hosted United Nations &quot;Guernica&quot; tapestry; &quot;The Keiskamma Guernicas&quot; (2010–2017); and Erica Luckert&#x27;s theatrical production of &quot;Guernica&quot; (2011–2012). Art and design historian Dr Nicola Ashmore curated an exhibition, &quot;Guernica Remakings&quot;, at the University of Brighton galleries from 29 July 2017 to 23 August 2017.

<text>St Leonards-on-Sea (commonly known as St Leonards) is a town and seaside resort in the borough of Hastings in East Sussex, England. It has been part of the borough since the late 19th century and lies to the west of central Hastings. The original part of the settlement was laid out in the early 19th century as a new town: a place of elegant houses designed for the well-off; it also included a central public garden, a hotel, an archery, assembly rooms and a church. Today&#x27;s St Leonards has extended well beyond that original design, although the original town still exists within it.

==History==
The land that is now St Leonards was once owned by the Levett family, an ancient Sussex gentry family of Norman origin who owned the adjacent manor of Hollington, and subsequently by their descendants, the Eversfields, who rose to prominence from their iron foundries and widespread property holdings during Tudor times. Eversfields served as sheriffs of Surrey and Sussex in the 16th and 17th centuries and were later baronets before the family became extinct.

James Burton, a successful London property developer who had developed large areas of Bloomsbury and the houses around Regent&#x27;s Park, purchased land from the Eversfield estate to put into being his concept of a seaside resort. The land was part of Gensing Farm, and included a small wooded valley leading down to the sea. Work on the plan started in early 1826. It included a house for himself (West Villa: now 57 Marina); service areas were provided, such as shops and laundering (&quot;Mercatoria&quot; and &quot;Lavatoria&quot;), as well as public buildings for entertainment and the picturesque siting of villas amongst the wooded slopes and water of the central gardens, to be paid for by subscription.

In addition he persuaded the Turnpike Commissioners to have the road leading to St Leonards included in the scheme, and arranged for the road through Silverhill to be built so as to give access. Before he died in 1837 St Leonards (Royal Victoria) Hotel, the South Colonnade, an archway marking the town boundary with Hastings, and tall seafront houses (as far as 71 Marina) had also been completed. His grave is marked by a pyramid in the churchyard above St Leonard&#x27;s Church. In 1850 his son Decimus (1800–1881) started the second phase of building, by acquiring more land and extending the development westward. He lived in the town for the remainder of his life.

Decimus Burton became a Commissioner of the new town in 1833. He leased a triangle of land bounded by Mercatoria, St John&#x27;s Church, Maze Hill and Kenilworth Road. Here he built The Cottage (now St Leonards Lodge), Maze Hill House (demolished), The Mount (13 houses), The Uplands (6), The Lawn (10), and six semi-detached houses which later became a school (later part of the college but now closed for redevelopment). Later, in Upper Maze Hill he built Baston Lodge, Tower House and Clone House (now Healey House). He gave some land in Mercatoria for a National School, and completed his father&#x27;s seafront terrace by building 72 to 82 Marina. Modern (2006) photographs give a flavour of this development.

St Leonards became a fashionable seaside destination. Princess Sophia of Gloucester stayed at Gloucester Lodge on Quarry Hill in 1831. The building was formerly named the Castellated Villa but changed to Gloucester Lodge in honour of her. Princess Victoria and her mother the Duchess of Kent, stayed in the town for the winter of 1834–1835, occupying a residence since renamed Victoria House. In 1837 Queen Adelaide passed the winter there.
The popularity of St Leonards, however, was not lost upon the town of Hastings. It had already begun to expand westwards, through Pelham Place and Wellington Square, and further building began. The Eversfield Estate, from whom the Burtons had bought land, saw the potential and it too began to sell off more space, having obtained an Act of Parliament opening the way for speculative builders beyond the Burton boundaries. As a result, the area between the two towns began to fill with properties. In 1875, the two towns merged into the County Borough of Hastings, and by then the total seafront had reached some . Soon after that, the Warrior Square and Upper St Leonards areas were being developed.

By now the railways had arrived: the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway reached West Marina in 1845, although it was not until 1852 that the station later named St Leonards Warrior Square was opened by the South Eastern Railway.

Construction of the pier began in March 1888, and it was opened by Lord and Lady Brassey on 28 October 1891. Positioned almost opposite the Royal Victoria Hotel, the shore end had a pavilion constructed of intricate ironwork at the entrance so that visitors could drive straight to the door and avoid the seafront weather. There was also a tollhouse to the left of the entrance that was demolished by a storm on 12 February 1899. The far end of the pier had a building used for dancing, and later as a roller hockey rink. During the 1920s the pier was modernised and finally cut in half during the Second World War as protection against invasion. The remains were removed in 1951.

In 1901 the civil parish called Hastings St Leonards had a population of 7693. On 1 April 1909 the parish was abolished and merged with Hastings.
On the seafront stands an ocean liner shaped art-deco building known as &quot;Marine Court&quot;, which upon completion in 1937 was the tallest block of flats in the United Kingdom, comprising some 153 flats and 3 restaurants. Despite this claim to fame, entries to a competition to name the building show that it was not universally popular. Now a listed building, it has recently been bought by the residents after many years of neglect and is in the process of being fully restored.

St Leonards Golf Club, Hastings, (now defunct) was founded in 1902/3. The club closed in 1960.

==Geography==
The town of St Leonards today occupies, firstly, the fairly steeply climbing land immediately adjacent to the west of Hastings, leading up towards Silverhill and Hollington; and secondly, an area to the west where the land is lower lying. The latter part of the town – Bulverhythe – is thought to be the original site of the port of Hastings, since cut off by longshore drift of pebbles. Within the higher land there are some small valleys: that through which the Priory stream flows through Alexandra Park being the main one.

In November 2023, the steep land between Marina on the sea front and the West Hill Road was affected by a series of landslips, leading to local homes being evacuated.

==Demographics==
==Healthcare==
In 1840 the Royal East Sussex Hospital was opened to provide care for the sick poor, this was renamed in 1887 as the Hastings, St Leonards and East Sussex Hospital. In 1923 it was rebuilt in Cambridge Road and renamed the Royal East Sussex Hospital. In 1993 this closed when the Conquest Hospital, was opened. This is managed by the East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust. In 2021 a new medical centre which houses two GP surgeries and a pharmacy, located next to West St Leonards Community Centre, was opened. It is intended to act as a modern health hub for up to 20,000 patients.

==Transport==
The principal roads in St Leonards are the seafront (Grand Parade and Marina) part of the A259 coastal route; and London Road. Two of the three railway stations remain open: St Leonards (West Marina) was closed in 1967. Today&#x27;s bus and train services provide the public transport for the town.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from either the Heathfield or Hastings TV transmitters. 

The town’s local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex on 104.5 FM, Heart South on 102.0 FM and More Radio Hastings on 107.8 FM.

Local newspapers are the Hastings &amp; St Leonards Observer and Hastings Independent Press.

==Parks and gardens==
Warrior Square Gardens – The site was opened as a subscription garden in 1852. The Council purchased a strip of land at the southernmost tip to erect a statue of Queen Victoria which was unveiled on 31 December 1902. All but the uppermost rose garden was acquired by the Council in 1920 with the upper garden being donated to the Council in 1930. Recent improvements include major re-landscaping and wall restoration, completed in 2001. The lower section was completely re-laid following extensive excavation by Southern Water.

St Leonards Gardens – Originally laid out as a private garden for the Burton family, St Leonards Gardens was bought by the town for £9,000 in 1879. The gardens had two ponds and a maze, which proved very popular and gave Maze Hill its name. Gothic-style buildings were built around the wooded valley. The gateway to St Leonards Gardens is an imposing Burton building. The garden was purchased by the Council in 1880 and opened to the public; it consists of trees, shrubs and grass areas with a central pond. The Council applied for a Heritage Lottery Grant for the restoration of this garden and work is now complete.

Gensing Gardens – The garden was purchased by the Council in 1872 and landscaped by the then Borough Surveyor, William Andrews. Little is recorded of the history of the site, although the name comes from the original farm. The garden has been subject to numerous improvements during the last 10 years and consists of shrub and flower beds, trees, grass areas, and an equipped playground suitable for children up to 14 years old. It is located within a priority ward and is a rare and valuable open space within its neighbourhood.

Markwick Gardens – The Gardens were formed in the 1860s primarily for the use and pleasure of the residents of Markwick Terrace, which was built in the 1830-40s. At that time, the land was owned by the Eversfield Trust, which no longer exists and the gardens are now owned, privately, by the Eversfield Estates. (Markwick was the surname of one branch of Eversfield family descendants.)
Since the war the gardens have been run by a Committee of local residents as the Estate now takes no part in the running. Access to the gardens is by membership of the Markwick Gardens Association.

==Notable residents==
Queen Adelaide (1792–1849), consort of William IV, lived in St Leonards as a widow. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) lived at 117 Marina in the summer of 1864, in order to be near his ailing wife Jane Carlyle, who was in possession of caretakers. Elizabeth Eiloart (1827–1898), novelist, retired to St Leonards, and &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; author Henry Rider Haggard came to live at North Lodge, Maze Hill, the house built across the road at the entrance to old St Leonards; this remained his home until 1923. Robert Tressell, author of &quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot;, lived at 241 London Road from 1907. Summerfields School produced the alumnus Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. 

George Bristow was the taxidermist at the centre of the Hastings Rarities ornithological fraud; his business address was 15 Silchester Road. Fred Judge FRPS founded the local picture postcard manufacturer Judges Postcards.

George Monger was awarded a VC during the Siege of Lucknow in 1857, and after leaving the army, he lived in Tower Road, St Leonards where he died in 1887. Historian Prof Roy Porter (1946–2002) retired to St Leonards. Dr Thomas Duncan Greenlees FRSE retired here in 1922 and died here in 1929.

Archibald Belaney (b 1888 d 1938) &quot;Grey Owl&quot; achieved fame as a conservationist during his life, after his death the revelation of his non-Native origins and other autobiographical fabrications negatively affected his reputation. Born in England and migrating to Canada in the first decade of the 20th century, Belaney rose to prominence as a notable author, lecturer, and one of the &quot;most effective apostles of the wilderness&quot;

<text>Indiana Jones Adventure is an enhanced motion vehicle dark ride attraction based on the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series, located at Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea. Guests accompany intrepid archaeologist Dr. Indiana Jones on a turbulent quest, aboard military troop transport vehicles, through a dangerous subterranean lost temple guarded by a supernatural power.

The attraction premiered as Temple of the Forbidden Eye at Disneyland in Anaheim, California on March 3, 1995, and opened to the general public on March 4, 1995. A second, and nearly identical, version of the ride opened as Temple of the Crystal Skull on September 4, 2001, at Tokyo DisneySea in Chiba, Japan, unrelated to the 2008 film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;. On August 10, 2024, it was announced at the D23 Expo that as Temple of the Feathered Serpent will replace Dinosaur at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, featuring a different story, involving Indiana Jones hunting a mythical creature in a Mayan temple.

==History==

Because of the success of &quot;Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!&quot; at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in Bay Lake, Florida, Walt Disney Imagineering and George Lucas collaborated once again to create a new &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;-themed attraction for Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California. Unlike the previous collaboration, this attraction was created with a backstory &quot;set in the Lost Delta of India, circa 1935&quot;. Indiana Jones Adventure is the fourth collaboration between Disney and Lucasfilm, after the Disneyland attractions Captain EO, Star Tours, and &quot;Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!&quot; and prior to Disney buying Lucasfilm (and thus the Indiana Jones franchise).

Several early concepts were considered, including a walk-through adventure and a high-speed mine car adventure within a temple. To avoid a long queue, Imagineers considered using Jungle Cruise launches to shuttle guests to the loading area.

The team tested key show elements in a Burbank warehouse on a full-sized elevated track that resembled a freeway. This enabled the team to test set pieces, lighting, effects, transport clearances, and motion profiles.

Groundbreaking for the &quot;Temple of the Forbidden Eye&quot; occurred in August 1993, with more than 400 Imagineers working on its design and construction. Tony Baxter led a core project team of nearly 100 Imagineers. To create space for the queue area and the show building, an area of the former &quot;Eeyore&quot; parking lot was demolished, and the Monorail and Jungle Cruise attractions were rerouted. Disney filed for patent on the ride-system on November 16, 1995. Harrison Ford was asked to reprise his role as Indiana Jones, but ultimately negotiations to secure Ford&#x27;s participation broke down in December 1994 for unknown reasons. Instead, Dave Temple provided the voice of Jones. Ford&#x27;s physical likeness, however, has nonetheless been used in subsequent audio-animatronic figures.

The Temple of the Forbidden Eye premiered on March 3, 1995. Among the invited celebrity guests were George Lucas, Michael Eisner (Disney CEO at the time), Dan Aykroyd, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Brendan Fraser, Wayne Gretzky, Elliott Gould, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Dennis Miller, Lindsay Wagner, Tony Danza and Carrie Fisher. To promote the opening of the attraction, the Disney Channel produced a half hour-long TV program entitled &quot;Indiana Jones Adventure&quot; featuring Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies reprising their roles from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Forty days prior to the attraction&#x27;s opening, a &quot;Forty Years of Adventure&quot; promotion giveaway of 40 unique annual trading cards began. Guests with valid paid admission received a voucher at the main gate turnstile to exchange for the card of the day, each in a series featuring the landmark attraction of the year starting with 1955. The last card was distributed on March 2, 1995. A special &quot;41st&quot; card of larger issue featured the Indiana Jones Adventure on March 3. Artist Drew Struzan produced a one-sheet poster in the same theme as the films, using permission from Ford to use his likeness. The adventure opened to general admission on March 4.

AT&amp;T Corporation sponsored construction of the attraction and the first seven years of operation, from 1995 to 2002. One of three styles of Marabic decoder cards was distributed to each guest, advertising their promotional campaign on the back. &quot;It’s great to have AT&amp;T as presenting sponsor,&quot; said then-Disneyland President Paul Pressler. &quot;With Disneyland celebrating its 40th Anniversary and preparing to open its most exciting attraction, we welcome the opportunities this relationship is sure to create.&quot; The attraction currently has no sponsor.

The ride was temporarily closed on September 4, 2012 for an extensive refurbishment and re-opened on December 7, 2012. Scheduled modifications included enhancements to lighting, paint, figure animation and other effects. In 2013, the idol of Mara that appears in the Hall of Promise scene was updated with projection mapping effects.

On November 19, 2019, Disney announced a $300,000 refurbishment that would happen sometime in early 2020.

On January 9, 2023, the version at Disneyland went through another refurbishment, and re-opened on March 17, 2023, which included a freshening up of the audio-animatronics and projections, and a new projected scene of a tunnel collapsing replacing the original rat cave scene.

===Ride system===
Guests board an Enhanced Motion Vehicle (EMV) intended to appear as a battered military troop transport. EMVs ride on neoprene-filled tires for operational precision. The tires are driven by hydraulic rotors that provide forward motion, and hydraulic pressure is applied onboard each vehicle at using DC pressurizers. The vehicle has four-wheel steering atop the surface of a slotted roadbed. The track has only three switches: a left/right split switch just before loading/unloading, a left/right combine switch just after safety check station/dispatch and a compound switch to swap vehicles in/out of the maintenance bay, behind the mirrors. Beneath the slot a tubular guideway guides the front wheelset and a damper for the rear wheelset, and three electrical buss bars provide the EMV 480 volts AC. The power is divided among the two motion systems, control, safety, and audio systems. Each transport can accommodate twelve guests with three rows of four seats each, with the front-left seat behind a non-operational steering wheel.

Each troop transport is a motion simulator which travels at a maximum speed of just over atop a slotted roadbed / guiderail track. The transport car body is attached by three hydraulic rams to the frame of the chassis, which allows the shell to articulate independently. A guest&#x27;s physically intense experience is programmed to achieve the illusion of greater speed and catastrophic mechanical failure using the enhanced-motion vehicle&#x27;s ability to add several feet (metres) of lift then rapidly descend, shudder and tremble, and intensify cornering with counterbank and twist. The intensity of each experience varies as the on-board computer constantly chooses between pre-programmed intensity versions already stored in its memory as it traverses the show building with its load of guests.

This ride system was invented specially for the Indiana Jones Adventure and has only been implemented in one other attraction: Dinosaur, located at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom (opened as CTX: Countdown to Extinction). 

Heavy or light traffic within the ride system can cause speed variations as the vehicles try not to enter the specified safety distance between one another. On busy days, each vehicle may slow to a crawl at intervals within the ride path in order to allow the vehicle ahead to gain distance, then suddenly jerk back into higher speed. Because of these unexpected variations in speed, the soundtrack to the ride is not of a specific length, in fact, each scene of the attraction has a pre-selected score to play which is already of a certain length. If the vehicle finds itself remaining in one scene for an extended period of time, the score will play in full or until the vehicle leaves the scene. If the vehicle remains in a scene longer than the length of the score, then an exaggerated soundtrack of the vehicle&#x27;s engine will fade-in and play to keep riders from experiencing awkward silence. Due to safety reasons, vehicles on the ride path cannot reverse. Contrary to the finale scene when the vehicle reverses away from the boulder, the vehicle is actually stationary while the motion base tilts backwards and the cave walls accelerate past the riders to give the illusion of reversing.

The safety systems of the Indiana Jones Adventure are very sensitive and can lead to a ride stop several times in a day, leaving guests to believe that the attraction &quot;broke down&quot;. Many variables can cause a ride stop: a vehicle may hit an obstacle on the path such as guest items dropped from the vehicle ahead, the vehicle wheels might slip or skid on a wet or damp section of track, or if a vehicle experiences conditions where it must quickly accelerate followed by a sudden stop, the vehicle may overshoot its target or move very slightly backwards causing it to shut down.

===Audio-Animatronics===

The attraction features four Audio-Animatronics, three of which are animatronics of Indiana Jones, one of a larger-than-life cobra. Prior to the 2010 refurbishment, the Indiana Jones figure in front of the Gates of Doom had his back pushed against the gates. During the refurbishment, he was replaced with a more advanced figure that now is leaning his full body weight into the right door.

==Disneyland version==

===Story===

&quot;Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye&quot; is told through twelve letters and telegrams scattered throughout the queue as well as three newsreels shown before guests board the attraction.

In 1935 India, Indiana Jones reunites missing fragments of a map documenting the precise location of an ancient temple believed to have been buried in a flood over two thousand years ago. According to legend, the temple was built to honor the deity Mara, who offers one of three gifts to all who come to the hallowed site (eternal youth, earthly riches, or visions of the future) on the condition that they never gaze into the eyes of Mara.

Although the discovery, dubbed the &quot;Temple of the Forbidden Eye&quot; by the media, sets the archaeological community abuzz, funding quickly runs out. Sallah begins conducting guided tours to raise money so the excavation can continue. Good fortune comes to many tourists, while others do not return at all.

Jones eventually ventures inside to find the missing tourists and uncover the temple&#x27;s power source, known as the &quot;Jewel of Power,&quot; which Abner Ravenwood believes is located within an immense cavern beyond the Gates of Doom. One week later, with Jones yet to reappear, Marcus Brody requests Sallah continue conducting the tours in the hopes they may locate Jones.

===Queue===

The attraction&#x27;s immersive and carefully detailed queue leads guests through dimly lit temple chambers and eerie passageways containing booby-trapped sections reminiscent of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies.

The queue begins outside, winding past a 2.5 short ton () Mercedes-Benz troop transport truck. This is the actual vehicle used in the desert chase scene in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. A small mining car near the truck is a movie prop as well, used in the mine scene in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;. Guests also walk by a noisy &quot;hit-and-miss&quot; engine/generator set piece, which appears to power the lights strung deep into the temple.

Much of the queue is inside the temple itself. Throughout the bowels of the temple, petroglyphs in &quot;Marabic&quot; warn temple visitors of the rewards and perils that can be found further within. The glyphs can be translated into English using a simple character substitution encoding. In the early months of the attraction&#x27;s existence, guests were given decoder cards; the cards are now only distributed during special events or when made available. If unable to receive a decoder card, the code is easily solvable as each symbol bears a strong resemblance to its corresponding letter in the English alphabet. The sole exception is the letter I, which, appropriately, resembles an eye. Where the text is painted, vowels appear in red.

The queue contains several interactive features. In the “spike room”, the ceiling appears to be retained by several upright bamboo poles. When the key supporting pole is pushed or pulled, guests are startled by sounds of the ceiling dropping as the spikes begin to descend slowly toward them. In the next area, large stone blocks released from the ceiling (triggered by the diamond-shaped stones below) are barely kept in place by wooden wedges and supports. Further on, in the Rotunda Calendar, pulling on a rope triggers responses from Dr. Dunfor Pullit, an out-of-sight archeologist supported by the rope beneath the sarcophagus stone. Various crates throughout the queue contain some significant features; one marked with the number &quot;990 6753&quot; refers to the number on the crate holding the Ark of the Covenant in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Another crate is marked &quot;Deliver to Club Obi Wan&quot;, referring to a fictional club at the beginning of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, itself a reference to the character Obi-Wan Kenobi from &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Eventually, guests encounter a projection of a newsreel of the discovery, followed by safety instructions delivered by Sallah. Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse appear on the cover of a copy of &quot;Life Magazine&quot; in Professor Jones&#x27; office.

=== Ride experience ===

At the loading area, guests board the troop transport. Through the radio, Sallah (voiced by Bob Joles) reminds the tourists to fasten their seat belts and points out a problem with the brakes (in earlier versions of the ride, there would alternatively be problems with the gas pedal or the steering wheel). The transport takes off, past a cluster of mirrors concealing the maintenance dock entrance, and turns a corner into the Chamber of Destiny, where guests are presented with three doors. One of the three doors begins to glow more brightly than the other two, and Mara (voiced by James Earl Jones) announces which gift the passengers have chosen to receive. The doors open, and the passengers enter the Hall of Promise, where the idol of Mara resides at the end of the hall.

As originally built, the Chamber of Destiny only had one actual operating door and corridor. Since the ride&#x27;s opening, the room&#x27;s walls and ceiling were designed to rotate across the working doorway and a set of four façades (two on each side of the real doorway) so that three &quot;doors&quot; are always visible at any given time. Each of the doors are lit differently based on which particular chamber has been randomly chosen, and decoy tracks leading to the other doors have been used to enhance the effect. In 2013, new projection mapping effects were added for the Hall of Promise. The Chamber of Destiny’s doors was also updated with projection mapping effects in 2015. , the machinery used to rotate the room has been deactivated and is no longer used. Instead, the transport always enters the second door in the center, and the effect of entering a specific room is accomplished using projectors hidden on either side of the chamber, which shuffle through various video effects that are superimposed onto all three doors to create the illusion that the transport is entering a specific room.

* If the transport gets to the Chamber of Earthly Riches, Mara says, &quot;You seek the Treasure of Mara? Glittering gold — it is yours.&quot; The vault, in the doors, begin to unlock as gold coins appear to rain down from above as they swing open. Inside the Hall of Promise, piles of gold, bronze statues, and priceless carvings fill vestibules on each side with a massive gold face of Mara at the far end of the hall. The room is illuminated with shimmering golden light behind the backlit scrims where images of gold and other treasures are visible, with sounds of coins echoing through the hall. Front-lit scrims along the walls are painted to depict true believers surrounded with hoards of treasures, symbolizing riches and wealth, beyond their wildest dreams.
* If the transport gets to the Fountain of Eternal Youth, Mara says, &quot;You have chosen wisely. This path leads to timeless youth and beauty.&quot; The rusted, corroded doors of that chamber are rinsed clean by a sheet of purifying water pouring from the relief above, revealing their pristine, metallic nature as they swing open. Inside the Hall of Promise, where the painted murals on the walls show the timeless beauty of Mara&#x27;s chosen ones as everyone around them ages, the walls reflect the light on the water. At the far end of the hall, a massive stone face of Mara, with flowering vines scaling the surrounding walls. The room appeared illuminated with shimmering aqua blue light with sounds of water drops echoing through the hall. Front-lit scrims along the walls are painted to depict true believers drinking mystic water, discarding their withered skin and emerging young and beautiful.
* If the transport gets to the Observatory of the Future, Mara says, &quot;You seek the future. I will lift the curtain of time. It is your destiny.&quot; The doors are sealed by an iced web that clouds its carved reliefs. But upon Mara&#x27;s announcement, the all-seeing eyes above glow, whisking away the icy wall as shooting stars illuminate the newly unlocked pathway as they swing open. Once inside, the Hall of Promise is lit by innumerable glowing stars, and the temple&#x27;s open roof reveals the endless night sky above, with a glowing, ethereal face of Mara at the far end of the hall. The room is illuminated dimly lit purple, and the ceiling above twinkles with 5,000 fiber optic stars. The transport vehicle tilts upward, directing the passengers’ eyes away from the dark scrims and towards the dazzling starfield.

As the guests approach the idol, Mara suddenly opens his eyes. Inevitably, as someone looks into them, the idol immediately scowls at the guests and, using projection mapping, shows the idol’s face &#x27;bleeding&#x27; with colors as he rescinds each of his gifts.

* For the Chamber of Earthly Riches, his gold metal face begins to corrode rapidly with acid, tarnishing and rusting it until his face turns into red copper.
* For the Fountain of Eternal Youth, his marble stone face begins to crack and &quot;age&quot; as the surrounding vines shrivel and their petals fall. Chillingly, Mara&#x27;s eyes faded to a deep, endless black.
* For the Observatory of the Future, his ethereal face begins to be engulfed in a raging storm filled with lightning and, eventually, his face into a giant fireball.

During his rescinds, Mara cries out, &quot;You looked into my eyes! Your path now leads to the Gates of Doom!&quot; (For the &quot;Observatory of the Future&quot; scene, Mara&#x27;s last line is changed to, &quot;&quot;Your destiny now lies beyond the Gates of Doom!&quot;)&quot;

The transport momentarily appears to head toward an exit before making a sharp left turn into a large crumbling corridor. Using the hydraulic systems, the transport is given the effect of being lifted off the ground as it floats towards the Gates of Doom. Lightning flashes along the walls, illuminating large cobra statues overhead as the transport continues forward. The Gates of Doom pulsate with green mist, and an audio-animatronic Indiana Jones (voiced by Dave Temple) struggles to keep the doors closed. Jones pushes the doors shut, making the transport drop to the ground, and scolds the tourists for looking into the idol&#x27;s eyes. He instructs them to proceed up the steps to the left. The transport then accelerates up the flight of stairs.

The transport emerges from the passage and teeters on the edge of a vast pit of lava. If timed correctly, another transport can be seen attempting to cross a rickety rope bridge that spans the pit under a crumbling ceiling. On the far side of the cavern, there is a stone face of Mara that periodically shoots green rays at both transports, causing flames to erupt from where the beam hits the cavern. Formerly, there was an effect in place within this scene where the light beams would hit the ceiling, causing dyed ice cubes to rain down, simulating the rubble of the caving temple, but it was removed due to operational issues. However, the sound effect for the rubble can still be heard upon entering the room. The transport then turns left and enters catacombs of false pathways lined with skeletons, some of which pop out toward the guests.

Suddenly, the transport veers to the left, and all is dark. The transport&#x27;s headlights flicker back on, illuminating walls swarming with thousands of beetles. Hissing sounds are heard, and riders are blasted with puffs of air. The transport heads out of the darkness and onto the bridge which spans the pit. The transport stalls for a moment as another oncoming transport can be seen about to cross the bridge (depending on the transport&#x27;s timed arrival), which turns away just before reaching it. The transport then accelerates across the bridge, which sways and jostles under its weight. The massive stone face of Mara shoots beams from its eye, attempting to destroy the bridge. The transport makes it safely across, then turns sharply to the right.

Hundreds of snakes cover the walls and ground, and a large audio-animatronic cobra appears to the right of the vehicle, striking at the riders. The transport heads back to return across the rope bridge and flashes its headlights at an oncoming transport about to cross (again, depending on the transport&#x27;s timed arrival). The transport turns sharply to the right, traveling behind the giant stone carving of Mara&#x27;s face, and enter a room full of skulls (the number of skulls is 1,995, a reference to the year of the ride&#x27;s opening), and Mara roars at the riders from above. The transport turns towards the left and dips underneath the main bridge as a fireball erupts ahead from the laser beam. The vehicle nearly gets hit by the deadly laser blast from the &quot;Broken Nose Of Mara&quot; as the transport travels across a mini wooden bridge and veers into a pitch-black tunnel. Shocks of electricity suddenly chase the transport before it stalls for a brief moment. All of a sudden, the transport starts up again and it heads towards an empty corridor leading towards a way out of the temple when, suddenly, the electrical shocks blasts the corridor, causing it to collapse and block the tunnel. The transport careens through another dimly lit tunnel with paintings of spear-wielding skeletal warriors adorning the walls. Blasts of air hit the riders, and darts are heard striking the transport as it rolls over the trigger stones between the skeletal warriors.

The transport then approaches a dark area and stops. Indiana Jones suddenly appears above the vehicle hanging on a rope in a shaft of light. He welcomes the adventurers&#x27; rescue and bids for them to turn on the headlights and allow him to board. As the lights flicker on, they illuminate a massive boulder rolling toward the transport. The transport seems to back up as the boulder threatens to crush Jones and the tourists (this effect is achieved by moving the walls of the room forward, not moving the transport backward). At the last possible second, the transport accelerates, and suddenly the floor seems to give way, sending the transport into the chamber below. An impact resonates through the chamber as if the boulder has crashed down, nearly striking the transport.
The transport plunges down into darkness and swerves right to see Jones standing in front of the boulder, which has been cracked by its impact. An exhausted Jones wipes his forehead and says one of the following:
*&quot;Not bad, for tourists.. Now, stay out of trouble will ya?&quot;
*&quot;There! That wasn&#x27;t so bad, was it?&quot;
*&quot;Next time, you&#x27;re on your own!&quot;
*&quot;Now, next time, you wear blindfolds, okay?&quot;
*&quot;Now, don&#x27;t tell me that wasn&#x27;t big fun!&quot;
*&quot;Tourists... Why&#x27;d it have to be tourists?&quot;
*&quot;You were good in there. You were very, very good.&quot; 

A final triumphant refrain of music ushers the guests back into the station. Sallah welcomes back the tourists and tells them to remain seated as the transport reaches the loading area.
==Tokyo DisneySea version==
===Story===

Set in an unspecified region of Mexico during the 1930s, Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull takes place in the Temple of the Crystal Skull, an Aztec temple guarded by a Crystal Skull. Hosted by a character named Paco (portrayed by Katsuhisa Hōki), the story features Indiana Jones (voiced by Kunio Murai) searching for the Fountain of Youth. While the name is similar to that of the fourth &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film, the design of the titular skull is entirely different and the scenarios in the attraction are unrelated to the film.

===Queue===
The Temple of the Crystal Skull building exterior resembles a large Aztec pyramid and temple, set in the South American port &quot;Lost River Delta&quot; at Tokyo DisneySea. The design is influenced by ancient South American architecture and art. There is a large room in the first pyramid with elaborate, South American-inspired frescoes on the walls; skeletons litter the floor around the queue walkway. The queue subsequently passes through a series of smaller, intricately themed chambers. Paco, a South American tour guide, hosts a black-and-white safety film, which plays on a continuous loop.

=== Ride experience ===
Everyone is seeking the Fountain of Youth. There is a single carved door with pools of water to the side, complemented by mist and what appears to be endless hallways.

All guests enter the same hallway, seeking the Fountain of Youth. This single hallway contains effects from all three variations seen in “Forbidden Eye”: fiber optic stars, statues holding glowing treasure, and water effects. At the end of the hall awaits the Crystal Skull. It glows demonically, signaling that the journey is about to take a turn toward the Gates of Doom.

The transport momentarily appears to head toward an exit, before making a sharp turn into a large corridor. Lightning flashes along the walls, illuminating large cobra statues overhead as the transport seems to &quot;float&quot; through the room using the EMV technology.

The Gates of Doom pulsate with green mist as Indiana Jones struggles to keep the doors closed. Jones, speaking in Japanese, scolds the tourists for waking the Crystal Skull and instructs them to proceed up the steps to the left. The triumphant musical theme from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; is heard as the transport accelerates up the flight of stairs, entering a room with a rope bridge and a large stone face resembling the Crystal Skull.

Blues and greens are the colors that fill this room. There is a large tornado effect near the bridge. The eye of the large skull is crystal and emits lasers and other lighting effects.

The transport turns left and enters another chamber filled with skeletons, some of which pop out toward the guests.

Suddenly, all is dark; the music tinkles with chaotic violin pizzicatos. The transport&#x27;s headlights flicker on, illuminating walls swarming with thousands of beetles. Hissing sounds are heard, and riders are blasted with puffs of air.

The transport finally heads out of the darkness and onto the bridge which spans the pit. The transport stalls for a moment as another oncoming transport can be seen across the pit (if the transport&#x27;s arrival is timed correctly), but it turns out of the way before reaching the bridge. The transport then accelerates across the bridge which sways and jostles under its weight. The massive stone skull shoots beams from its eye at the bridge, attempting to destroy it. The transport safely makes it across and makes a right turn.

Thousands of snakes line the walls and ground and a gigantic audio-animatronic version of the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl, with glowing red eyes, appears to the right of the vehicle, striking at the riders.

The transport heads back to return across the rope bridge and flashes its headlights at an oncoming transport about to cross (again, if the transport&#x27;s arrival is timed correctly). The transport turns sharply to the right, entering behind the giant stone skull. The transport slides past hundreds of human skulls which decorate the walls, as the crystal skull on a plinth radiates light. Turning left, out of the massive stone skull, the transport continues downward, passing under the rope bridge.

Encountering a carved skull-like face in the wall in front of the vehicle, the transport pauses for a moment as a fireball (a large ring of harmless orange colored smoke) suddenly emerges from the face&#x27;s mouth, heading straight towards the transport. The transport swerves to the right driving through the smoke and onto the next corridor.

A hall lined with sculptures of gaping skulls along the walls. The vehicle lurches forward over the pressure plates in the floor activating the booby trap. From the mouth of each skull shoots a dart (air jets that emit sudden swift puffs of air). The transport rolls to the end and makes a sharp right into the Boulder Room.

Jones hangs from a vine above. As the transport pulls up underneath him he shouts (In Japanese) one of several phrases cautioning the riders. As the boulder rolls towards the transport and falls, the transport plunges and a photograph of the entire car of riders is taken. The photograph may be purchased after the ride.

The transport drops suddenly, then turns right sharply in a dark tunnel and comes out to see Jones standing in front of the crushed boulder. Jones wipes his forehead and says one of several pre-recorded phrases. A final triumphant refrain of the music ushers the guests back into the station. While waiting to disembark, the mobile radio transceiver announces one of several &quot;please remain seated&quot; messages.

==Music==
In addition to dialogue and sound effects, an orchestral soundtrack plays through the speakers built into the troop transports. This medley contains segments and motifs of John Williams&#x27; original scores for the first three &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies, re-scored and re-recorded to sync up with the perils of the adventure. Richard Bellis was responsible for this adaptation process. &quot;The Raiders&#x27; March&quot; and Ark theme both feature prominently at various points.

The following list is a breakdown of the different passages heard in the attraction, and the track times at which the original versions can be found on the soundtracks for the films.

<doc id="1055083" wikidata="Q3183558" url="?curid=1055083" title="Jonesville, Florida">
<text>Jonesville is an unincorporated community in Alachua County, Florida, United States. It is located roughly at the intersection of County Road 241 and State Road 26 (Newberry Road). Jonesville has no city government but is an informal name for a region on Newberry Road between Gainesville and Newberry.

While no clear delineation has been made for what includes Jonesville, its eastern boundary is 122nd street (colloquially known as Parker Road), due to the City of Gainesville owning up to the eastern side of the road. All the other limits are vague. Jonesville may extend as far west as to 170th St. Approximate northern and southern markers for the region are NW 39th Avenue and SW 8th Avenue, respectively.

Jonesville is named for John Joseph Jones, a young Alabama farmer who moved to this area in the early 1850s, and owned a farm on the south side of the old Newnansville Road. During the Civil War he enlisted as private and later served as 1st lieutenant in the Alachua Rangers, which became C Company of the 7th Florida Volunteer Infantry. After the war he returned to farming. When a post office opened in Jonesville in 1875, John Jones became the first postmaster and this is how the community received the official name of &quot;Jonesville&quot;.

==Growth==
Over the past 40 years, Jonesville has become more populated as the city of Gainesville has continued to grow and residents have moved west towards less dense communities. Coinciding with the growth in the area population, Jonesville has seen an increase in both commercial developments and residential developments.

===Commercial development===
Commercial development has rapidly occurred in the 2010s, with new businesses in and around the Steeple Chase shopping plaza. Large-scale commercial developments have included the Town of Tioga development on pre-existing empty fields around the Steeple Chase Shopping Center, and the Arbor Greens center. Additional businesses are expected to move to the area as the population grows. Current agendas include the development of commercial/office space at the intersection of Newberry Road and NW 140th Terrace as well as expansion of commercial land in Town of Tioga.

===Residential development===
Many subdivisions have sprung up in the past decade or so in and around the Jonesville area. Older residential neighborhoods have been built since the 1970s. Some of these include Villages of West End, West End Golf View Estates, and Jockey Club. Large, more recent subdivisions include Amelia Fields, Town of Tioga, Arbor Greens, Turnberry Lake, Belmont, Strawberry Fields, and Wyndsong. Apartments and condos are also in the region.

==Infrastructure==
Jonesville is primarily served by Florida State Road 26, Alachua County Road 241, and SW 8th Avenue.

The Jonesville Park provides local residents with baseball fields, a mile-long track, a disc golf course, tennis courts, soccer fields, and regular play. Future development of the park promises to include a nature center, an event lawn with numerous activities, a BMX track, nature trails, picnic areas, an amphitheater, and a recreation center with gymnasium, weight room and multipurpose rooms.

Alachua County Fire Rescue Station 24 is located just north of Jonesville Park on County Road 241. The station serves the local area, but can be dispatched elsewhere as needed. A new station was built in 2011, and the old station has been abandoned since.

<doc id="1055085" wikidata="Q7144546" url="?curid=1055085" title="Paternal bond">
<text>A paternal bond is the human bond between a father and his child.

==Father-infant bonding==
Infants can become attached to their fathers. Mother-infant bonding has been a common focus in household research; however, more studies in the United States and Europe have been focused on the details of father-children attachments. In the book, &quot;Gender in cross-cultural perspective,&quot; Barry Hewlett showed that infants do create bonds with their fathers. She explained how recently born children bond with their fathers at similar ages during development. Researchers question how father-infant bonding occurs because fatherhood has many different roles in various cultures. Questions arise about how fathers have the ability to bond with children if they do not have the same kind of role that mothers do in the baby&#x27;s development.

The father of a child can develop the bond during the pregnancy of his partner, feeling attachment to the developing child. Research indicates that this may have some biological basis. Statistics show that fathers&#x27; levels of testosterone tend to decline several months before the birth of the child. Since high testosterone levels are linked to more aggressive behaviour, low levels may enhance the ability to develop a new relationship bond.

Fathers also have an important bonding role after the child is born. Fathers find many ways to strengthen the father-child bond with their children, such as soothing, consoling, feeding (expressed breast milk, infant formula, or baby food), changing diapers, bathing, dressing, playing, and cuddling. Carrying the infant in a sling or backpack or pushing them in a baby transport can build the bond, as can participating in the baby&#x27;s bedtime routine. These are broad activities that fathers share to develop their father-infant bond. Fathers also have specific bonding roles that develop from their different cultures and societies.

===European and American culture===
European and American fathers are seen to have more of an aggressive and vigorous relationship with their child. This does not mean harmful; however, it means there is physical and highly stimulating interaction between the father and child. This gave the child emotions that reflected an exhilarating and fun-loving experience that allowed them to create a father-infant bond different from a mother-infant bond. It is shown that an infant&#x27;s facial expressions and emotions towards their father is significantly different from their emotions towards their mothers, even at a very young age. This shows that a father being present gives the child a variety in the way they interact with different people. The roughhousing does not just have importance towards the bonds the children make with the father, but also helps to teach them life lessons. Rough play helps to teach self control, helps children understand appropriate social roles, helps them realize when certain emotions should be used, and helps them understand others emotions and facial expressions. This form of bonding between the father and infant creates a bond that is unique. It allows the child to learn valuable lessons, while also being in an environment that enhances all of their senses and allows them to intensify their relationship with their father.

===Aka culture===
The Aka are a hunter-gatherer society in the southern Central African Republic and northern Congo-Brazzaville. The way they form their father-infant bond is very different from that of the Europeans and Americans. While Europeans and Americans focus on rough playing, the Aka&#x27;s do not allow this high stimulating environment to develop with their children. Aka fathers are always around their infants when they are born. They always sleep with their infants and are always in close proximity of them for more than half a day. Overall, Aka fathers are more relaxed and intimate during fatherhood than those in the United States.

The four factors that are key for Aka father-infant bonding:
# Understanding the infant: Aka fathers are around the child more than most cultures. They hold the child often; therefore, they learn important signs the child shows that most fathers would not. For example, they understand signs that show when the child is hungry or sick.
# Understanding fatherhood practices: Fathers understand when to be more playful, when to be more physical, how to correctly hold a child, and how to calm them down. They understand all of the interactions that are needed to take good care of a child.
# Connecting with the infant: The father understands how to make a bond with the infant. They know if the infant needs more rough play or soothing. They play large roles in caretaking, so they understand the infants needs at another level.
# Representing the culture and fatherhood goals: The Aka&#x27;s are hunter-gatherers; therefore, animal hunting is not a sufficient or main way that they obtain food. This means that the males do not play a main role in going out and hunting for the tribe or their own families. This allows the father to be able to spend more time with the infant and really create a bond with them. This makes a father&#x27;s role in child upbringing an important aspect of the Aka culture.

The Aka foragers in the Central African Republic do not hunt with bows. Their main source of hunting is through nets. In Hillary N. Fouts cross-cultural research, she had statistical data that supported the claim that different roles in foraging populations had an impact on the amount of time a father spent with their children. Fouts took different foraging populations in Africa and compared their type of hunting and the percentage of time these fathers were seen holding their child. Her first foraging group was the Aka population. They were a net hunting group that held their children aged 1–4 months 22% of the day, held their children 8–12 months 11.2% of the day, and held their children 13–18 months 14.3% of the day. The other net hunting population was the Bofi. They had fathers hold babies aged from 36-47 and 48–59 months for 5.4% of the day.

In contrast, the foraging groups that participated in bow hunting had fathers hold babies for significantly less time. The Hadza foraging population had fathers hold babies from the ages 0–9 months for only 2.5% of the day. The other bow hunting foragers, the !Kung, had fathers hold babies from 0–6 months for 1.9% of the day and babies 6–24 months 4.0% of the day.

This statistical data shows that different roles in a society influences how much time the father spends holding and interacting with his children. This is important because it shows that each culture is different regarding father upbringings and father bonding.

==Legal paternity==
===United States===
In the U.S., legal paternity is presumed for the husband of the mother unless a separate action is taken; an unmarried man may establish paternity by signing a voluntary recognition of paternity or by taking court action. Paternity may also be established between a man and a younger person, commonly in adoption, without the two being biologically related.

<doc id="1055089" wikidata="Q1004531" url="?curid=1055089" title="Bullets Over Broadway">
<text>Bullets Over Broadway is a 1994 American black comedy crime film directed by Woody Allen, written by Allen and Douglas McGrath, and starring an ensemble cast including John Cusack, Dianne Wiest, Chazz Palminteri and Jennifer Tilly. Set in 1920s New York City, the film centers around a struggling playwright who is urged to cast the talentless girlfriend of a notorious mobster in his newest play in order to get it produced.

The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including 
Allen for Best Director, Allen and McGrath for Best Original Screenplay, Palminteri for Best Supporting Actor, and both Tilly and Wiest for Best Supporting Actress, with the latter winning for her performance, the second time Allen directed her to an Academy Award. Considered one of his best works, &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; is the most recent film directed by Allen with a shared writing credit.

==Plot==
In 1928, David Shayne is an idealistic young playwright newly arrived on Broadway from Pittsburgh. Desperate to gain financing for his play, &quot;God of Our Fathers&quot;, he is persuaded by producer Julian Marx to cast actress Olive Neal, the girlfriend of gangster Nick Valenti, in a minor role.

Compensating for his frustration with the demanding and talentless Olive, David is thrilled to cast alcoholic faded star Helen Sinclair in the lead role, along with the dieting British thespian Warner Purcell. Rehearsals are soon thrown into chaos when Olive shows up escorted by Cheech, a mob henchman, who insists on watching rehearsals.

Eventually Cheech starts giving notes on the script to David, who is initially angered by the intrusion but quickly realizes the ideas are excellent. Cheech, who barely learned to read before burning down his school, has a natural talent for playwriting, but is not interested in taking any credit. The cast members herald the revised script as genius, disparaging his initial draft as dull and pompous.

Buoyed by their imminent success, David and the actors succumb to their vices. His partner, Ellen, catches him cheating on her with Helen. Warner indulges in overeating and begins an affair with Olive, which he attempts to break off when Cheech threatens his life. Growing increasingly frustrated with Olive&#x27;s poor acting, Cheech tries to have her fired from the production. After David reminds him he cannot get rid of Olive, Cheech murders her and dumps her body in a river.

Olive&#x27;s murder is widely assumed to be part of an inter-gang conflict, but David immediately senses the truth and argues with Cheech. Regretting his mistakes, David is dismayed to learn that Ellen is leaving him for his hedonistic Marxist friend Sheldon Flender.

On opening night, Valenti accuses Cheech of Olive&#x27;s murder, which he denies. Henchmen Rocco and Aldo chase Cheech backstage while the play is being performed, shooting him. With his dying words, Cheech gives David a new final line for the play. The play is a critical and commercial success, but David skips the after-party to confront Flender. He confesses his lack of talent and proposes marriage to Ellen, who accepts his newfound desire to leave high society and move back to Pittsburgh.

==Production==
The film&#x27;s locales include the duplex co-op on the 22nd floor of 5 Tudor City Place in Manhattan.

The film&#x27;s title may have been an homage to a lengthy sketch of the same title from the 1950s television show &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;; one of Allen&#x27;s first jobs in television was writing for Sid Caesar specials after the initial run of the show.

The film featured the last screen appearance of Benay Venuta. Allen cast her in a cameo role as a well-wishing wealthy theatre patron. She died of lung cancer in September 1995.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; received a positive response from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A gleefully entertaining backstage comedy, &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; features some of Woody Allen&#x27;s sharpest, most inspired late-period writing and direction.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;a bright, energetic, sometimes side-splitting comedy with vital matters on its mind, precisely the kind of sharp-edged farce [Allen] has always done best.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; similarly called it &quot;a backstage comedy bolstered by healthy shots of prohibition gangster melodrama and romantic entanglements&quot; and wrote, &quot;In its mixing of showbiz and gangsters, this is a nice companion piece to Allen&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;, and about as amusing.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised, &quot;&quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; shares a kinship with a more serious film by Allen, &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, in which a man committed murder and was able, somehow, to almost justify it. Now here is the comic side of the same coin. The movie is very funny and, in the way it follows its logic wherever it leads, surprisingly tough.&quot;

The film grossed $13.4 million in the United States and Canada and $24.1 million internationally for a worldwide total of $37.5 million.

==Stage musical==
Allen adapted the film as a stage jukebox musical, titled &quot;Bullets Over Broadway the Musical&quot;.

<doc id="1055090" wikidata="Q2999575" url="?curid=1055090" title="Maternal bond">
<text>A maternal bond is the relationship between a biological mother/caregiver and her child or baby. While typically associated with pregnancy and childbirth, a maternal bond may also develop in cases later on in life where the child is unrelated, such as in the case of an adoptee or a case of blended family.

Both physical and emotional factors influence the mother-child bonding process. In separation anxiety disorder a child becomes fearful and nervous when away from a loved one, usually a parent or other caregiver. New mothers do not always experience instant love toward their child. Instead, the bond can strengthen over time, or fail to develop. Bonds can take hours, days, weeks, or months to develop.

==Pregnancy==
The maternal bond between a woman and her biological child usually begins to develop during pregnancy. The pregnant female often adapts her lifestyle to suit the needs of the developing infant, for example by eating or retaining from eating certain foods or undertaking or avoiding certain activities. At around 18 to 25 weeks, the mother begins to feel the fetus moving. Similar to seeing her child for the first time in an ultrasound scan, this experience often leads the mother to feel more attached to her child .

Once sufficiently developed, the developing fetus has some awareness of the mother&#x27;s heartbeat and voice and can respond to touch or movement and hear sounds from the surrounding environment. By the seventh month of pregnancy, two-thirds of women report a strong maternal bond with their unborn child.

Some mothers who did not want the pregnancy may not have a close relationship with their child due to a sense of foreigness/unfamiliarity. They are more likely to suffer from post-partum depression or other mental health problems and less likely to breastfeed.

==Childbirth and post pregnancy==
Childbirth is an experience that can strengthen the mother and child bond. Factors such as a traumatic birth, the mother&#x27;s childhood, medical stress, lack of support and the influence of a spouse or partner/family or socioeconomic factors like poverty can weaken the bond.

Physical contact between infants and caregivers is very important to building, and bonding is still possible for infants which require hospital care which reduces the opportunities for physical contact, for example those infants who are born prematurely. Parents and premature infants can still bond by cuddling and hugging, by touching in and around incubators, and by playing, with skin to skin like firms of contact particularly effective.

Emotional &quot;bonding theory&quot; first appeared in the mid-1970s and bonding theories outlining descriptions and causes of good bonding and poor bonding were established understandings by the mid 1980s.

==Oxytocin==
Production of oxytocin during childbirth and lactation increases parasympathetic activity. Thus, anxiety is theoretically reduced. Maternal oxytocin circulation is said to predispose women to bond and show bonding behavior, although this has been disputed.

Breastfeeding is also strongly believed to foster the bond, via touch, response and mutual gazing as it stimulates the experience with the baby gazing up and down the mother and drinking from the mother&#x27;s nipples.

==Maternal separation anxiety==
Beginning at 9–10 months of age when infants begin to crawl and then when they begin to walk around 12 months of age, they begin to develop capacities to physically explore the world away from their mother. These capacities bring with them separation anxiety as the infant becomes more vulnerable away from mother. This newly acquired motor development parallels infants&#x27; intellectual curiosity, and cognitive and language development as they begin to point and name, and jointly attend with mothers to their environment beginning by 9–10 months. Most parents welcome these explorations and this increased independence. However, in the context of maternal depression, trauma or disturbed bonding in her own early life, some mothers have significant difficulty in tolerating the exploration and-or the infant&#x27;s anxiety.

This separation anxiety increases when infants and toddlers feel threatened or socially reference their mothers for reassurance. The research claimed out that mothers, for example, with histories of violence exposure and post-traumatic stress show less activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, a brain area that helps to temper and contextualize fear responses, and thus are likely unable to extinguish their fear response upon watching a videotaped mother-toddler separation scene in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner.

== Child separation anxiety ==
Inevitably, children who have rarely been separated from their mother become anxious when separated for extended periods. This is most commonly experienced when starting to attend school. Separation anxiety can cause children to be unable to be open to new experiences such as attending school regularly. There is a relationship between child separation anxiety and school refusal.

Attachment happens after childbirth and does not form and is likely more fluid as you go further in later in life, this anxiety can reoccur if mothers have to leave their family unit to work. In both cases, the child&#x27;s anxiety (and that of the parents) can be reduced by priming, i.e. preparing the child for the experience before its occurrence and by creating and maintaining dialogue and connection between the absent parent and child during the separation. Many children may experience such anxiety in various forms. Child separation anxiety may be a learned behaviour which can occur over time initiating from innate fears of separation or trauma.

<text>Bateman&#x27;s is a 17th-century house located in Burwash, East Sussex, England. It was the home of Rudyard Kipling from 1902 until his death in 1936. The house was built in 1634. Kipling&#x27;s widow Caroline bequeathed the house to the National Trust on her death in 1939. The house is a Grade I listed building.

== History ==
Bateman&#x27;s is a Jacobean Wealden mansion constructed in 1634. There is debate as to the original builder. Historic England follows the tradition favoured by Kipling of ascribing the construction to a Sussex ironmaster, John Britten. The historian Adam Nicolson reports the tradition in the National Trust&#x27;s guidebook, but notes that Britten was a dealer in iron, rather than a manufacturer. Pevsner attributes the construction to a lawyer, William Langham.

By the early twentieth century, the house had descended to the status of a farmhouse, and was in a poor state of repair. The Kiplings first saw it in 1900, on returning to England from America, following the death of their daughter Josephine in 1899 and a disastrous falling-out between them and Carrie Kipling&#x27;s brother, Beatty Balestier. Enchanted by the house, they were too slow in making an offer and it was let for two years. In 1902, they were able to purchase it, with 33 acres of land, from a wealthy stockbroker, Alexander Carron Scrimgeour.

In 1900, Kipling was the most famous author in England, and was earning £5,000 per year; the cost of Bateman&#x27;s, £9,300, was thus entirely affordable. Kipling wrote some of his finest works at the house including: &quot;If—&quot;, &quot;The Glory of the Garden&quot;, and &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot;, named after the hill visible from the house. The house&#x27;s setting and the wider local area features in many of his stories. Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Land&quot; is inspired by the Bateman&#x27;s estate.

Kipling&#x27;s only son, John, was killed at the Battle of Loos on 29 September 1915. Kipling died on 18 January 1936, of peritonitis. Carrie died three years later, in 1939. Under the terms of her will the house passed to the National Trust.

== Architecture and description ==
The house is built of sandstone to a double-pile plan, and is of two storeys with gables above. The eastern entrance, front may once have been symmetrical with a northern wing matching the southern one. Historic England&#x27;s listing states that the wing was constructed but later torn down, while Pevsner suggests that it may never have been built. The windows are mullioned and the roof has an &quot;impressive row of six diamond-shaped red brick chimney stacks&quot;.

The interior is retained as it was in the time of the Kiplings. The study is almost as Kipling left it, although without the &quot;pungent aroma&quot; of his forty-a-day Turkish cigarette habit. The house contains a significant collection relating to Kipling, amounting to nearly 5,000 individual pieces, including his Nobel Prize, his Rolls-Royce Phantom I, many oriental items he purchased while living in India or touring in the East and paintings he collected by Edward Poynter, Edward Burne-Jones and James Whistler.

The garden was created by Kipling from 1907, using the prize money from his award of the Nobel Prize in Literature. The house is a Grade I listed building, the highest grade reserved for buildings of &quot;exceptional interest&quot;.

== Park Mill ==

There is a water mill on the estate, powered by water from the River Dudwell. The earliest reference to a mill relates to its construction between 1246 and 1248, and first mentioned with the name &#x27;Park&#x27; in 1618. The present mill was built between 1751 and 1753, and extended in the 1830s. It became part of the Bateman&#x27;s estate in the late 19th century. By Kipling&#x27;s time, the mill was no longer in operation and he installed an electric turbine in it to provide power for the house. The mill was restored by the Trust in 1975, and again between 2017 and 2020. The mill is itself Grade II listed.

<doc id="1055099" wikidata="Q3066463" url="?curid=1055099" title="Maulets (history)">
<text>The Maulets () were a partisan group of Valencian supporters of Archduke Charles, who claimed the Spanish throne as Charles III during the War of the Spanish Succession. They were antagonists to the Botiflers camp, the supporters of competing claimant and eventual winner of the war, Philip, Duke of Anjou (Philip V).

Maulets is also the name of a present-day political organisation for youths supporting Catalan independence from Spain.

==Historical context==
As a compensation for having lost the Moor workforce which was expelled from Spain in 1492, the King gave the nobility all the right on the lands that these people had farmed before leaving. This allowed them to impose on the newly arrived Christian population taxes and partitions of lands which in some counties became a very high expense for the peasants. Probably, the hunger for land amongst those poor families led them to accept the conditions, and during 50 years there were no known protests.

Towards the end of the 17th century, a part of these new peasant population profited from the prosperity arising from cultivating and exporting mainly wine and its derivatives, brandy and prunes, and to a lesser extent, silk. Then, they started to question the high payments demanded by the nobility, which considerably reduced their profits, and tried by all means, from legal suits, to armed revolt, to end this system. But the judiciary path, being fully under the control of the nobles, proved useless; and the armed revolt, called nowadays (Second Brotherhood), was crushed by the Vice-Chancellor and armies of the nobles in the year 1693, at the &quot;battle&quot; of .

The peasants in this revolt claimed more or less the same as the Maulets would a few years later. They refused the right of the Lords on the former Moorish lands, and called on the Medieval rights given by James I of Aragon during the conquest of the Kingdom, to denounce an alleged lack of legality of the exploitation by the lords, &quot;who treated them like Moors&quot;, given the case that the Laws of the Kingdom banned these kind of taxes and tributes to the Christians. The nobles alleged that King Philip III, having expelled the Moriscos, had given them those lands in property, on which they then had every right to regulate.

After their military defeat, the peasants&#x27; unrest loomed. New clashes were ready to start in 1700 when Charles II of Spain died with no sons or clear heir, setting the conditions for the War of the Spanish Succession.

When Philip V of Spain took possession of the Kingdom of Valencia (one of the component kingdoms of the larger Spanish Kingdom) as a Felip IV of Valencia, there were already many supporters of the archduke Charles of Austria in this territory, as well as in the Principality of Catalonia and Majorca. Their reasons were various, ranging from loyalty to the Austrian Habsburg dynasty, hate towards the French by a part of the merchants and the industrials, and distrust for the suspected centralist attitude of Philip V of Spain, as seen by the Bourbon rule in France.

Merchants and exporters of wine, brandy, silk, and other farming products, which were politically and economically very important, contacted a key person for their cause: General Joan Baptista Basset. General Basset was a Valencian, probably born in Alboraia in an artisan family, who spoke the people&#x27;s language and knew very well their claims and needs. He had served during the wars in Italy and Hungary under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, a German noble who had previously been viceroy in Catalonia.
The War of the Spanish Succession had a double nature. On the one hand, it was a Spanish internal issue; on the other hand, it was a major European war for international hegemony. England and the Netherlands (the so-called &quot;Maritime powers&quot;, traditional destinations of the Valencian merchants&#x27; exports) sided against the Bourbon claimant, Philip V. As a part of a blockade, Valencian exports to these countries stopped, which meant a total downfall for merchants and the peasants that sold them their Valencian products. The exports to France, a land that produced and exported the same products, did not compensate them in any way for the losses.

== Successful rebellion ==
From 1704, Francesc Davila, who was probably a leader of the Segona Germania who had escaped persecution, toured all the southern counties of Valencia explaining to the peasants that the Austrian pretender was ready to abolish all the rights of the nobles to higher taxes than the ones imposed by James I. When Joan Baptista Basset disembarked in Altea in August 1705, a new revolt commenced and spread out everywhere.

Basset rode to Valencia, via Dénia, Gandia and Alzira without meeting any real resistance. When the mostly Bourbon-supporting nobles or the fortresses tried to resist, it was the armed villagers who forced them to flee. Together with the viceroy, Duke Gandia, a long list of Nobles and &quot;botiflers&quot; siding with Philip V of Spain fled, not to Valencia, but to Castile; they did not trust the resistance of the capital, and with reason.

The city of Valencia opened its doors to the Maulet army without resistance. On the contrary, it was received with popular enthusiasm. At the same time, news from the uprising in the Principality of Catalonia arrived, where a rebelling had expelled the &quot;Felipist&quot; military and where Charles III himself had triumphantly disembarked in Barcelona. This news was enough to spread the uprising through in the rest of the Kingdom of Valencia, especially in its northern part, from Vinaròs and Benicarló to Vila-real and Castelló, where the Maulets were specially strong.

Once Basset was established in Valencia, practically exercising the function of Viceroy, and with most of the country under control of the Maulets (meaning, of the armed villagers), the first thing was to abolish all taxes to the nobles. Basset even went further and with the doubtful legality of his high office, stopped paying any kind of tax to the tax collectors of the King. He also abolished the &quot;right of doors&quot;, a hated tax on products coming from the colonies into Valencia. He also tolerated, and even stimulated, a real persecution, expulsion and arrest of French citizens, mainly merchants, who were seen by the population as enemies and by the native merchants as dangerous competitors. Relationships with the maritime powers allied to Charles III were re-established, and the harbours were again opened to Dutch and English ships, resuming trade as before. At the same time, Basset and the Maulets arrested and ousted the most notorious &quot;botiflers&quot;, and seized their possessions.

== Clash amongst allies ==
Basset, now in control of the Valencian country, had to organize armed resistance against Bourbonic attacks. He realized quickly that his peasant army of Maulets was no match for the professional Bourbonic army, let alone their French allies.

Basset asked Charles III for military help. The help came, in the form of the Earl of Peterborough and his English soldiers. Even though his arrival saved the delicate situation from enemies&#x27; attacks, it also meant the creation of another political power led by Count Cardona, with a military force independent from the Maulets and with no intention of allowing what they considered &quot;plebeian excesses&quot;.

It all points to the fact that count Cardona and the English general had instructions, probably from the King, to end the &quot;excesses&quot; of Basset and the Maulets, in this way trying to gain back the support of the nobles, most of them siding with the Bourbons.

Sure enough, Charles III, as an owner of royal lands and main lord of the Order of Montesa, had experienced a reduction in his income, by the Maulets&#x27; refusal to pay. This money was absolutely necessary to keep the very expensive army together with which he hoped to win the war. In consequence, it was necessary to stop the Maulets and their chief, General Basset, but it was necessary to do it wisely and with indulgence.

Cardona and Peterborough then started an offensive centred at some of Basset&#x27;s collaborators, pointing to the illegal confiscation and loot for personal use of the goods from the French and the Botiflers, and imprisoned them awaiting trial. Meanwhile, Basset was lured away from Valencia, first to Alzira and later on to Xàtiva, encouraging him to take part in the fighting. They awaited an opportunity to imprison him, but were fearful of his great popularity amongst the people and feared a rebellion of the Maulets if that ever happened.

The occasion came when Charles III had defeated the Bourbons in Castile and had managed to enter Madrid on June 27, 1706. In between the popular celebrations, Peterborough secretly sent troops to Xàtiva, with the order to arrest Basset and imprison him in a fortress in English hands. When news came out, effectively the people revolted.

In Valencia the shouts of &quot;Long live to Basset, before than Charles III&quot; proved the real allegiances of the Valencian Maulets. In fact, Peterborough had to turn around those cannons meant to defend Valencia from the Bourbons to aim at the revolting population, to drive them off. During days there were demonstrations of protest, letters sent to Charles in Barcelona and all kind of public declarations in favour of Basset and his reforms. But a renewed Maulet revolt, this time against one whom they considered their legitimate King, all with a Bourbon army at the doors of the Kingdom ready for war, would have been suicidal. A victory of the Bourbons would have meant the return of the Botiflers, and the previous state of affairs. Consequently, Maulets resigned and stopped their protests, believing that the pretender Charles, in coming to Valencia shortly, would repair the injustice and would free Basset.

== Defeat and retreat ==
Meanwhile, the Maulets continued refusing to pay the &quot;door rights&quot;, or any other taxes. Charles III demanded from the authorities from Valencia to call for its payment, without much success. But time was running out. Charles had already been forced to abandon Madrid and suffered a crushing defeat in the hands of the Duke of Berwick in the Battle of Almansa. Charles withdrew towards Barcelona, and with him the Viceroy, the whole administration and surviving troops.

The people and the Maulets were left at the mercy of the Bourbon advance. King Philip never hid his intentions to overrun the Furs (the Valencian laws) &quot;by the just right of conquest&quot;. The Valencian kingdom disappeared as a legal structure, and was only left as a name, empty of meaning.

The Maulets resisted, especially in Xàtiva, a town which had to be taken by the Bourbonics after a fierce battle, and was afterwards razed and set on fire as a reprisal. In Valencia, the Maulets tried in vain to hinder the entrance of the Bourbonic army, but Berwick and Asfeld managed their way in.

When, in 1710, the war seemed to turn back in favor of Charles III, the city of Valencia raised again in anti-Bourbon revolt. The Maulets appeared on the streets again, awaiting in vain an Austriacista fleet that had to disembark troops at the harbour. A few remaining Valencian Maulets withdrew towards Catalonia still in the hands of Charles III.

== Barcelona 1714, the last stand ==
Thousands of Valencian refugees concentrated in Barcelona and other cities of the Principality of Catalonia. But the international events made clear the futility of carrying on the struggle. Charles III himself had signed a peace treaty with Philip V of Spain and went back to Austria. The maritime powers had accepted Philip V as king of Spain and had evacuated their troops from Barcelona over sea. The Catalans and the Valencian Maulets carried on fighting for their cause devoid of international allies.

When the Bourbon armies, led by Berwick himself, laid siege on Barcelona two regiments of Valencians were formed, the and the &quot;Sant Vicent Ferrer&quot;, to fight along their comrades in Catalonia.

On September 11, 1714, when Barcelona fell into Bourbon hands after a determined fight, many Maulets were counted among the fallen. Many others, amongst them General Basset, who had directed the artillery of the resistance, were arrested and imprisoned. Others, who managed to escape from the Bourbon troops via Majorca, or who were later on freed, ended up exiled in Vienna, at the court of &quot;their&quot; Charles III, now emperor of Austria.

<text>Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), also called malresorptive hydrocephalus, is a form of communicating hydrocephalus in which excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the ventricles, leading to normal or slightly elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The fluid build-up causes the ventricles to enlarge and the pressure inside the head to increase, compressing surrounding brain tissue and leading to neurological complications. Although the cause of idiopathic (also referred to as primary) NPH remains unclear, it has been associated with various co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and hyperlipidemia. Causes of secondary NPH include trauma, hemorrhage, or infection. The disease presents in a classic triad of symptoms, which are memory impairment, urinary frequency, and balance problems/gait deviations (note: this diagnosis method is obsolete). The disease was first described by Salomón Hakim and Raymond Adams in 1965.

The treatment is surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to drain excess CSF into the lining of the abdomen where the CSF will eventually be absorbed. NPH is often misdiagnosed as other conditions including Meniere&#x27;s disease (due to balance problems), Parkinson&#x27;s disease (due to gait) or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (due to cognitive dysfunction).

==Signs and symptoms==
NPH exhibits a classic triad of clinical findings (known as the Adams triad or Hakim&#x27;s triad). The triad consists of walking difficulty, reduced attention span, and urinary frequency or incontinence. Symptoms present insidiously over the course of 3–6 months. The triad is considered obsolete for diagnostic purposes and newer guidelines are available.

Gait deviations/balance problems are present in nearly all NPH patients and are typically the first presenting symptom. This is caused by expansion of the lateral ventricles, which can impinge on the corticospinal tract motor fibers. The typical gait abnormality in NPH is a broad-based, slow, short-stepped, &quot;stuck to the floor&quot;, or &quot;magnetic&quot; movement. The gait abnormalities in NPH may bear resemblance to a gait associated with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The gait deviation can be classified as mild, marked, or severe: &quot;marked&quot; is when the patient has difficulty walking because of considerable instability; &quot;severe&quot; is when it is not possible for the patient to walk without aids (such as a cane or a wheeled walker). An associated tremor of the hands, legs, or feet can be seen in up to 40% of NPH patients.

Dementia presents as progressive cognitive impairment which is present in 60% of patients at time of treatment. This is caused by distortions predominantly at the frontal lobe and the subcortex. Initial deficits involve planning, organization, attention, and concentration. Further deficits include difficulty managing finances, taking medications, driving, keeping track of appointments, daytime sleeping, short-term memory impairments, and psychomotor slowing. Late-stage features include apathy, reduced drive, slowed thinking, and reduced speech.

Urinary incontinence appears late in the illness and is present in 50% of patients at time of treatment. Urinary dysfunction begins as increased frequency often at night and progresses to urge incontinence and permanent incontinence.

==Pathogenesis==
Every day, the body makes roughly 600–700 ml of CSF, and about the same amount is reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between the amount of fluid produced and its absorption rate. Enlarged ventricles put increased pressure on the adjacent cortical tissue and cause myriad effects in the patient, including distortion of the fibers in the corona radiata. This leads to an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). The ICP gradually falls but remains slightly elevated, and the CSF pressure reaches a high normal level of 15 to 20 cm H2O. Measurements of ICP, therefore, are not usually elevated. Because of this, patients do not exhibit the classic signs that accompany increased intracranial pressure such as headache, nausea, vomiting, or altered consciousness, although some studies have shown pressure elevations to occur intermittently.

The exact pathogenesis is unknown, but consensus on some mechanisms include:
* An imbalance exists between production and resorption of CSF.
* The resistance to CSF outflow is often elevated.
* The disease is not caused by overproduction of CSF or obstruction of CSF flow at the ventricles.

The syndrome is often divided into two groups, primary (also called idiopathic) and secondary, based on cause. The underlying etiology of primary NPH has not yet been identified. Primary NPH affects adults age 40 years or older, most commonly in adults over 60. Secondary NPH can affect persons of any age and occurs due to conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, brain surgery, brain radiation, or traumatic brain injury. These conditions are thought to lead to increased inflammation of the arachnoid granulations, which further leads to decreased CSF reabsorption and therefore enlargement of ventricles.

Symptoms of gait deviation, neurological impairment, and urinary incontinence seen in NPH are due to compression of the corresponding regions of the brain that control these functions. Gait abnormalities are thought to be due to compression of the corticospinal tract fibers in the corona radiata that coordinate motor movements of the legs. Compression of the brainstem as well as poor perfusion of the periventricular white matter in the prefrontal cortex are also thought to contribute to gait deviations in NPH. Dementia in NPH is most likely caused by ventricular enlargement compressing the calvarium, which further leads to tearing of currently unidentified nerve fibers. Lastly, urinary incontinence is thought to be caused by stretching of the periventricular sacral fibers of the corticospinal tract fibers leading to loss of voluntary bladder contraction.

==Diagnosis==

Patients with suspected idiopathic NPH should have at least one of the symptoms in Hakim&#x27;s triad (gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment) in addition to ventricular enlargement on neuroimaging. An extensive and detailed patient history is required in order to exclude other diseases that may explain the patient&#x27;s symptoms. Known causes of secondary NPH (head injury, meningitis, hemorrhage) should be ruled out prior to further investigation of idiopathic NPH.

The international evidenced-based diagnostic criteria for primary, or idiopathic, NPH are:
* Gradual onset after age 40 years, symptoms duration of ≥ 3–6 months, clinical evidence of gait or balance impairment, and impairment of cognition or urinary incontinence
* Imaging from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) is needed to demonstrate enlarged ventricles and no macroscopic obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow. Imaging should show an enlargement to at least one of the temporal horns of lateral ventricles, and impingement against the falx cerebri resulting in a callosal angle ≤ 90° on the coronal view, showing evidence of altered brain water content, or normal active flow (which is referred to as &quot;flow void&quot;) at the cerebral aqueduct and fourth ventricle.

MRI scans are the preferred imaging. The distinction between normal and enlarged ventricular size by cerebral atrophy is difficult to ascertain. Up to 80% of cases are unrecognized and untreated due to difficulty of diagnosis. Imaging should also reveal the absence of any cerebral mass lesions or any signs of obstructions. Although all patients with NPH have enlarged ventricles, not all elderly patients with enlarged ventricles have primary NPH. Cerebral atrophy can cause enlarged ventricles, as well, and is referred to as hydrocephalus &quot;ex vacuo&quot;. For these reasons it&#x27;s utmost important to note that Evan&#x27;s index although commonly used in imaging is not very specific for NPH. One recent systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that callosal angle has high diagnostic performance and is commonly used together with Evan&#x27;s index.

The Miller Fisher test involves a high-volume lumbar puncture (LP) with removal of 30–50 ml of CSF. Gait and cognitive function are typically tested just before and within 2–3 hours after the LP to assess for signs of symptomatic improvement. The CSF infusion test can also be used to aid in diagnosis of NPH. During the CSF infusion test, a ringer lactate solution is infused into a spinal needle while another spinal needle is used to record numerous CSF pressure variables including ICP, outflow resistance, and CSF formation rate. The tests have a positive predictive value over 90%, but a negative predictive value less than 50%. The LP should show normal or mildly elevated CSF pressure. CSF should have normal cell contents, glucose levels, and protein levels.

==Treatment==

=== Ventriculoperitoneal shunts ===

For suspected cases of NPH, CSF shunting is the first-line treatment. The most common type used to treat NPH is ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, which drain CSF fluid to the peritoneal cavity. Adjustable valves allow fine-tuning of CSF drainage. NPH symptoms reportedly improve in 70–90% of patients with CSF shunt. Risk-benefit analyses have shown beyond any doubt that surgery for NPH is far better than conservative treatment or the natural course. VP shunt is less likely to be recommended in those who have severe dementia at time of NPH diagnosis, regardless of findings found on MRI or CT.

Gait symptoms improve in ≥ 85% patients. Cognitive symptoms improve in up to 80% of patients when surgery is performed early in the disease course. Urgency and incontinence improve in up to 80% of patients, but only in ≤ 50–60% of patients with shunt implanted late in disease course. The most likely patients to show improvement are those who show only gait deviation, mild or no incontinence, and mild dementia. The risk of adverse events related to shunt placement is 11%, including shunt failure, infections such as ventriculitis, shunt obstruction, over- or under-drainage, and development of a subdural hematoma.

=== Medications ===
No medications are effective for primary NPH. Lasting reductions in ICP have not been demonstrated with acetazolamide. Transient reduction in ICP after administration of an acetazolamide bolus has been shown to be a positive predictor for good response after VP shunt placement in NPH patients.

Research is currently aimed at finding other medication options for the management of NPH symptoms. Steroids have demonstrated decreased production of CSF in animal studies on healthy rabbits and dogs, however further testing is required to determine if this is an effective treatment option in humans. A trial of triamterene in adults with chronic hydrocephalus has also shown improvement of symptoms within 12 weeks, however further research is needed to support this as a non-surgical option for NPH.

== Outcomes and Prognosis ==
The prognosis for patients with NPH varies depending on cause, severity of symptoms, and time to diagnosis. If left untreated, symptoms of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence may continue to worsen and ultimately lead to death. Patients with a successful VP shunt can live a typically normal life with no restrictions to activities of daily living. According to a recent study, gait imbalance appears to be the symptom that improves the most for patients after placement of a VP shunt.

==Epidemiology==
Approximately half of all cases are primary (or idiopathic) NPH. Incidence is estimated to 0.3–3% in patients older than 60 years and raising with older age. Its prevalence is reported to be less than 1% in persons under the age of 65, and up to 3% for persons aged 65 or older. No difference in incidence is seen between men and women or amongst differing ethnicities. Among individuals with dementia, the incidence of NPH is thought to be between 2 and 6%.

== History ==
NPH was first described by neurosurgeon Salomón Hakim in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios, located in Bogotá, Colombia. Hakim was contacted by the family of a 16-year-old male patient who, after suffering from severe head trauma in a motor vehicle accident, remained semi-comatose after surgery to relieve pressure from a subdural hematoma. Hakim soon discovered ventricular enlargement on imaging of the patient, however, the patient&#x27;s intracranial pressure remained within normal limits. Hakim decided to remove CSF for laboratory testing and later implanted a ventriculoatrial shunt, after which the patient showed significant improvement to Hakim&#x27;s surprise. These findings were later published as a case report by Hakim in 1964 in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;. Hakim continued to research and work with patients found to have NPH and later published his findings detailing the classic triad of gait disturbance, neurological impairment, and urinary incontinence.

<doc id="1055121" wikidata="Q4788642" url="?curid=1055121" title="Area codes 819, 873, and 468">
<text>Area codes 819, 873, and 468 are overlay telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for central and western Quebec, Canada, including the Quebec portion of the National Capital Region, and the Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay coastlines of Quebec. Major cities in the territory include Gatineau, Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivières, Drummondville, Shawinigan, Victoriaville, Rouyn-Noranda, Val-d&#x27;Or, Magog and Mont-Laurier.

The incumbent local exchange carriers for the numbering plan area are Bell Canada, Bell Aliant, Telus, as well as Télébec and other independent companies. From 1992 to 1997, Northwestel was also an incumbent carrier in 819, as it included former Bell Canada areas in the Northwest Territories.

== History==

Ontario and Quebec were the only Canadian provinces that received assignments of multiple area codes from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) when the original North American area codes were created in 1947.

The eastern part of Quebec received area code 418, while the western part, from the US border to Hudson Strait, was assigned area code 514. After assignment of area code 819 in 1956, a 1957 flash cut split the 514 area into three segments. The southern region (including Montreal) retained 514; the middle region received 819, and the northern region, which had no telephone services, was added to 418.

Area code 819 thus bordered area code 613 and the new area code 705 in Ontario, area code 418 in the east and the north of Quebec, and the remainder of area code 514 in the south of Quebec.

When telephone service was introduced in the eastern Northwest Territories (most of which is now the territory of Nunavut, created in 1999), in Frobisher Bay in 1958, Bell Canada nominally made it part of area code 418. In the 1960s and the 1970s, telephone service was introduced by Bell Canada at other locations in the eastern Northwest Territories and along the Quebec Arctic coastline, as well as by Sotel, an independent company, in the James Bay region. Those non-diallable locations also became part of area code 418.

In the late 1970s, the northern parts of area code 418 served by Sotel and Bell along James, Hudson and Ungava Bays and Hudson Strait, as well as the eastern Northwest Territories, were assigned to area code 819 as exchanges in that area began to receive direct distance dialling. Thus, area code 819 now also bordered area code 709 of Newfoundland in the Torngat Mountain area and area code 403 where Bell Canada and Northwestel service areas met, as well as area code 204 (Manitoba) and area code 807 (northwestern Ontario). Also, from the late 1970s to 1997, area code 819 extended one eighth of the way around the world, from the 45th parallel north at Stanstead, Quebec, to the North Pole, including much of the Northwest Territories along with most of western Quebec. Northwestel used Alberta&#x27;s area code 403 for its services in Yukon and the Northwest Territories.

In 1997 and 1998, the portions of 819 in the Northwest Territories, as well as the portions of 403 in the Northwest Territories and Yukon, were transferred to area code 867, which was newly created to unite all of the Canadian territories, including Nunavut. Area code 819 was cut back to western Quebec, and area code 403 was reduced to serve only Alberta. Thus, borders with area codes 403, 204, and 807 were replaced with the single border on area code 867. Area code 514 was split shortly afterward, which changed area code&#x27;s 819&#x27;s border with 514 to a boundary with Area code 450, the new area code for the off-island suburbs of Montreal.

Until 2006, it was possible to make calls between Ottawa and Hull with only seven digits since Ottawa and Hull are a single local calling area. Central office code protection prevented the same seven-digit local number from being assigned in both Ottawa and Hull; thus if an exchange in 819-77x (819-PRovince) was in use in Hull, the corresponding 1-613-77x exchange could not be used anywhere in Eastern Ontario. Conversely, if an exchange in 613-23x was used in Ottawa, the corresponding 819-23x exchange could not be used anywhere in western Quebec, even in areas a safe distance from the National Capital Region such as Mauricie and Estrie.

In Canada, even tiny hamlets are a rate centres, with multiple competitive local exchange carriers being issued 10,000-number blocks, each of which corresponds to a single three-digit prefix. Larger cities had multiple rate centres, most of which were not amalgamated during the creation of &quot;megacities&quot; in Quebec in 2002 and still remain separate. For instance, Hull was in 2002 merged into the &quot;megacity&quot; of Gatineau. However, the megacity has five separate rate centres, which have never been amalgamated. The city centre exchange (serving the former cities of Hull and Pointe-Gatineau) is still named &quot;Ottawa-Hull&quot;, and the &quot;Gatineau&quot; exchange serves only the pre-merger city of Gatineau. The Gatineau and Aylmer exchanges, despite being part of the amalgamated municipality of Gatineau, remained long-distance calls to each other until a 16 August 2007 expansion of their local calling area, five years after the merger.

Many smaller rate centres do not need anywhere near 10,000 numbers to serve their customers, but a number cannot be assigned elsewhere once it has been allocated to a carrier and rate centre. That resulted in thousands of &quot;wasted&quot; numbers, and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers have exacerbated the problem. By 2006, area code 819 was effectively exhausted except for central office codes that theoretically could have been assigned in Hull but only by breaking seven-digit dialling between Ottawa and Hull.
Ten-digit dialling became mandatory in both area codes, 819 and 613, on October 21, 2006, and exchange protection was largely ended. Seven-digit local calls in centres far from the area code boundary (such as Trois-Rivières and Belleville, with no local calling into any other area code at the time) were failing, with intercept messages demanding customers to &quot;dial the area code&quot;.

The only legacy of the old system is a &quot;dual dialability&quot; scheme for federal government numbers in the National Capital Region. All federal government offices on the Quebec side have duplicated their entire allocation of multiple exchanges on the Ontario side.

Originally to be introduced in 2015, the CRTC on July 20, 2011 brought forward the introduction of the new area code 873 to September 15, 2012 after a report stated that the current area code 819 would be exhausted by then. Area code 873 had never been assigned as a local exchange in 1-819 because the tiny border village Beebe Plain is divided between 1-819-876 Rock Island and 1-802-873 Derby Line, an international local call that had been given exchange code protection to permit seven-digit local dialling.

There is no number pooling in Canada, and redundant telephone exchange rate centres are not merged when the underlying municipalities are amalgamated.

In February 2017, area code 468 was reserved as a third area code in the region. This area code became active on October 20, 2022.

<text>The Victoria Salmon Kings were a professional ice hockey team based in Victoria, British Columbia, and members of the ECHL. The team debuted in the 2004–05 season and folded after the 2010–11 season. The Chilliwack Bruins of the major junior Western Hockey League relocated to become the Victoria Royals and the two teams could not simultaneously operate. They played at the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre. For most of their history, they were affiliated with the Vancouver Canucks.

== History ==
Despite its long and distinguished hockey history (the Victoria Cougars won the Stanley Cup in 1925) Victoria was the largest Canadian city without either professional or major junior hockey when the major junior Western Hockey League&#x27;s Victoria Cougars moved to Prince George in 1994. This left the Tier II Junior &#x27;A&#x27; Victoria Salsa (later called the Victoria Grizzlies) as the highest level of hockey in Victoria.

By this time, it had become evident that the 50-year-old Victoria Memorial Arena, seating only 4,000 for hockey, would have to be replaced if Victoria was to attract a new hockey club. After several years of discussion, the construction of a new arena was approved by Victoria voters in a 2002 referendum, with one key condition being that its construction was dependent on Victoria securing a Western Hockey League (WHL) team.
When the private-sector partner, RG Properties, was unable to secure a WHL club, the company bought the franchise rights to the defunct Baton Rouge Kingfish of the minor professional ECHL and announced that Victoria&#x27;s new team would be named the Salmon Kings to mixed reactions. The acquisition of the franchise meant that construction of the new arena could begin, but many were troubled by the perception that they would be receiving hockey that was inferior to the major junior WHL. In addition, the ECHL was virtually unknown in Canada; Victoria was to be the first Canadian team in league history. The Salmon Kings responded by marketing the team and the league as high quality.

As the 2004–05 ECHL season approached, Victoria&#x27;s new arena, the Save-on-Foods Memorial Centre, was not going to be ready by the start of the season. In response, the ECHL scheduled the Salmon Kings to begin their inaugural season with a 14-game road trip. This was still not enough time for the arena to be completed, and the Salmon Kings were forced to secure ice time in the Bear Mountain Arena in the suburban community of Colwood, which had been constructed for the junior &#x27;A&#x27; Victoria Salsa and the Victoria Shamrocks box lacrosse teams.

Despite the preseason difficulties, the Salmon Kings played their first regular-season game on October 22, 2004, in Bakersfield, California, against the Bakersfield Condors. Former University of Alberta player Ryan Wade scored the first goal in Salmon Kings history in a 7–2 loss. The Salmon Kings would struggle during their 14-game road trip, winning three games while losing 10 games in regulation time and one in a shootout. Their first victory was against the Fresno Falcons on October 24, which the Salmon Kings won 5–0. David Brumby, the Kings&#x27; starting goaltender at the time, turned away 37 shots for the shutout.

As the 2004–05 NHL lockout continued, Dale Purinton and Dan Blackburn of the New York Rangers and Mark Smith of the San Jose Sharks played for the Salmon Kings. Purinton, an enforcer, was suspended twice by the league, the first for a career-ending check into the boards of Condors player Krzysztof Wieckowski and the second for returning to the ice to fight after being ejected during a bench-clearing brawl involving the Kings and the Falcons. After the latter suspension, Purinton was suspended indefinitely by the Salmon Kings and did not play again that season.

The Salmon Kings finally played their first home game on December 5, 2004, at Bear Mountain Arena, losing 4–3 in overtime. They finished the regular season with a 15–52–5 record, setting an ECHL record for a continuous winless streak by going 0–18–2 between December 31, 2004 and February 4, 2005.

After another losing season in 2005–06, during which the team had four different coaches behind the bench, the Salmon Kings became the ECHL affiliate of the nearby Vancouver Canucks. The Salmon Kings then had their first winning season in the 2006–07 season. Under head coach, Mark Morrison, the Salmon Kings would finish with a nine-game winning streak for an overall record of 36–32–1–3, good enough for seventh place in the National Conference. They faced the Alaska Aces in their first playoff appearance, winning the opening game by a score of 3–2, but losing the series by four-games-to-two.

The 2007–08 season was the Salmon Kings&#x27; best regular season in the ECHL with a 91-point season and winning 42 of 72 games. The Salmon Kings won the West division and took the number two seed into the Kelly Cup playoffs. In the playoffs, the Salmon Kings won their first-ever playoff round by eliminating the Bakersfield Condors in six games. In the second round, the Salmon Kings were eliminated by the Utah Grizzlies in five games.
The 2008–09 season started with head coach Mark Morrison adding the general manager&#x27;s title to his position with the organization. Morrison then promoted Jeff Harris to the team&#x27;s assistant general manager and hired the newly retired Ryan Wade as the team&#x27;s assistant coach. The team continued their strong play from the previous season and had a 15-game winning streak between December 8, 2008 and January 10, 2009, then second all-time in ECHL history, and had the team in first place within the division. However, the team went 12–19–0–4 afterwards and dropped to third place, which ensured a Kelly Cup playoff first round match-up again the Idaho Steelheads. In the playoffs, the Salmon Kings swept the series and eliminated the Steelheads in round one in four straight games. In the second round, the Salmon Kings were eliminated from the playoffs by the Alaska Aces in five games. Their lone win was a 4–0 shutout on home ice, their second shutout of the playoffs.

Despite their second straight second round elimination, the 2008–09 season saw a number of team records. Dylan Yeo became the first Salmon King player to win a league award with ECHL Defenseman of the Year. Team captain Wes Goldie set a new team record with 48 goals, while also becoming the first Salmon King to collect 200 points with the team. Finally, the team broke their previous attendance record with an average of 4,923 fans per game, up from 4,871 the previous year and 4,248 in 2006–07.

The following year, general manager and head coach Morrison returned for his third full season as bench boss. The Salmon Kings struggled in their first ten games going 1–9–0–0, placing them in last place of the National Conference standings and caused changes to their roster. However, on November 11, the Salmon Kings went on a 22–6–3–0 run in their next 31 games heading towards the ECHL All-Star break, which made Victoria the hottest team in the ECHL by accumulating the most wins and points through the 67-day stretch. The streak also included a 12-game overall winning streak and tying their previous club record with a 12-game home winning streak. The goaltending in the middle of season would see Glenn Fisher, along with three Abbotsford Heat netminders – David Shantz, Matt Keetley, and Leland Irving rotating starts, while Chad Painchaud, Olivier Latendresse and Wes Goldie led the offensive attack during the stretch run. At the 2010 ECHL All-Star Game, goaltender, David Shantz was named as the starting goaltender for the National Conference, while defenceman and Victoria native, Taylor Ellington joined the roster. After the All-Star break, the Salmon Kings&#x27; hot streak would come to an end when the team encountered several injuries and call-ups in the second half of the season. The Salmon Kings would complete the season with a 10–17–0–2 run and barely made the playoffs, finishing with a 34–32–4–2 overall record and placing seventh in the National Conference standings. In the Kelly Cup playoffs, the Salmon Kings played against the Bakersfield Condors in the first round of the best-of-five series. Victoria would win games one and three to take a 2–1 series lead but lost in the fifth-and-deciding game with the game-winning goal coming in the final minute of regulation at Rabobank Arena.

The 2009–10 season produced some highlight moments and individual accomplishments. On January 15, the Salmon Kings played in their 400th game in club history. The next night, the trio of Adam Taylor, Scott Howes, and Dirk Southern combined for a highlight-reel goal vs. Bakersfield at Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre, which became known as &quot;The Goal&quot; and made TSN&#x27;s Highlight of the Night. In addition, the Salmon Kings also set franchise records such for most goals in a game (9) and fastest two goals (eight seconds apart). On February 11, team captain Wes Goldie passed Ryan Wade&#x27;s club record for most games played for the Salmon Kings at 266 games. During this season, Chad Painchaud and Jimmy Sharrow broke a five-year-old club record by scoring points in 14 and 12 straight games respectively. Painchaud would tie the franchise record goal scoring streak by scoring goals in five straight games, while veteran Olivier Filion would break the all-time club record with most games registering an assist in seven games. Lastly, Jimmy Sharrow was named as in the ECHL All-Second Team honors at the end of the season.

<doc id="1055125" wikidata="Q2971821" url="?curid=1055125" title="Fort Grey">
<text>Fort Grey, colloquially known as the &quot;cup and saucer&quot;, is a Martello tower located on a tidal rock in Rocquaine Bay in Saint Peter, Guernsey on the west coast of the island.

== Château de Rocquaine ==
The French name of the rock is the &quot;Château de Rocquaine&quot; (Castle of Rocquaine); in Guernésiais &quot;Châté dé Rocquoïne&quot; probably built in the Late Middle Ages, there was a small fort, referred to in the 1620s as used by the militia, not being in a fit state to withstand assault. In the 16th century the site of local witches&#x27; Sabbaths and in 1617 there was reported a meeting between a local girl, Isabel Becquet and the devil. Marie de Callais from St Martin, was also convicted for belonging to the coven and burnt at the stake on 17 October 1617.

== Fort Grey ==
The existing fort was built on the remnants of the old Chateau. Its white tower was originally built as a defence by the British in 1804 during the Napoleonic Wars, the builder was a local man, Thomas Henry from Clos du Valle The fort was named after Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey, who was Governor of Guernsey from 1797 to 1807. It was made one of three locations in the island where a warning gun would be fired in case of invasion.

The Fort Grey tower, like the other two Guernsey Martello towers, Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet, was intended as a keep for the battery in which it was placed. The Guernsey Martellos are smaller than the British towers, with the Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet towers being smaller than the Fort Grey tower. Each mounted a 24-pounder carronade on the roof to protect the battery. Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet also have exterior staircases up to the second floor.

The connection between St Peter Port and the fort were improved with an upgrade of the road to military standard around 1808, using money arising from the sale of land from the reclaimed Braye du Valle.

== WW2 ==

The War Office in London sold Fort Grey to the States of Guernsey in 1891 for £185. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands in World War II, the Germans occupied the fort, as they did most of the other fortifications in Guernsey. The fort was given the name &quot;Widerstandsnest Graur Turm&quot; (resistance nest Gray Tower) armed with a mobile 3.7 cm Pak 36 anti tank gun and machine guns.

== Museum ==

More recently Fort Grey has been adapted for other more peaceful uses and now operates as a local shipwreck museum, housing a number of items of marine salvage from famous wrecks, including the and &quot;Elwood Mead&quot;. The items also include a cannon from that points towards the nearby Hanois rocks where &quot;Boreas&quot; sank in 1807 with the loss of her captain, at least half her crew, and possibly the captain&#x27;s wife. An additional exhibit of the timbers from a 3rd-century Roman ship, nicknamed &quot;Asterix&quot;, found in St Peter Port harbour in 1982 will shortly be on display close by, having taken decades to preserve the 1,700 year old timbers.

==Protection==
The whole of Fort Grey and the slipway at Rocquaine was listed as a Protected Monument on 26 March 1938, reference PM238.

<text>Malik Buari (born 21 January 1984) is a former professional football midfielder and left-sided defender. He has represented England in international youth squads.

==Club career==
Buari was formerly at Fulham, making his debut in the Premier League against Everton on 23 August 2003. He failed to score in the five first team games he played for Fulham before moving to Woking on a free transfer.

===New Zealand Knights===
Buari was one of the many signings made by new coach Paul Nevin intended to help improve on the disastrous inaugural A-League season. Buari impressed in pre-season but he really made a name for himself in Round Two. The Knights had held Adelaide United at 0–0 for the whole match when in the 88th minute, Buari released a 25-metre thunderbolt which went straight into the top corner to win the game and also secure the Knights first home win ever.

==International career==
Buari made a handful of appearances for England under-15s and under-16s.

<doc id="1055129" wikidata="Q235478" url="?curid=1055129" title="Shelley Duvall">
<text>Shelley Alexis Duvall (July 7, 1949 – July 11, 2024) was an American actress and producer. Known for her collaborations with Robert Altman and for playing eccentric characters, she won a Cannes Film Festival Award and was nominated for a British Academy Film Award and two Emmy Awards. Four of her films are preserved in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

Born in Texas, Duvall was discovered by Altman, who was impressed by her upbeat presence and cast her in the black comedy film &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; (1970). Though hesitant to become an actress, she continued to work with him, acting in the Western film &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971), the crime film &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; (1974), the musical film &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), and drama film &quot;3 Women&quot; (1977), the later of which earned her the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress. That same year she had a supporting role in Woody Allen&#x27;s romantic comedy film &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977).

Duvall gained further prominence for her leading roles as Wendy Torrance in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s horror film &quot;The Shining&quot; and Olive Oyl in Altman&#x27;s adventure film &quot;Popeye&quot;, both in 1980. She furthered this success appearing in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), Tim Burton&#x27;s short comedy horror film &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; (1984), and Fred Schepisi&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Roxanne&quot; (1987). Duvall then ventured into producing and creating television programs aimed at children and youth, such as &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; (1982–1987), &quot;Tall Tales &amp; Legends&quot; (1985–1987), &quot;Nightmare Classics&quot; (1989) and &quot;Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Bedtime Stories&quot; (1992–1994).

From the 1990s, Duvall acted sporadically, playing supporting roles in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s thriller film &quot;The Underneath&quot; (1995) and Jane Campion&#x27;s drama film &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996). After appearing in Gabrielle Burton&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Manna from Heaven&quot; (2002), she left acting until returning for her final role in the horror film &quot;The Forest Hills&quot; (2023). Her mental health in the interim was covered by the media, briefly turning her private life public. Duvall died of diabetes complications on July 11, 2024.

==Early life==
Shelley Alexis Duvall was born on July 7, 1949, in Fort Worth, Texas, the first child of Bobbie Ruth Crawford (née Massengale, 1929–2020), a real estate broker and in the legal field, and Robert Richardson &quot;Bobby&quot; Duvall (1919–1994), a cattle auctioneer-turned-lawyer. Her younger brothers were Scott, Shane, and Stewart.

For her first few years, Duvall lived in various locations throughout Texas due to her father&#x27;s work, before the family settled in Houston when she was five years old. She was in a choir. She was an artistic and energetic young child, eventually earning the nickname &quot;Manic Mouse&quot; from her mother. Growing up, Duvall&#x27;s only exposure to acting was when she forgot her lines to Joyce Kilmer&#x27;s poem &quot;Trees&quot; in a sixth-grade talent show. She became interested in science at a young age; as a teenager she aspired to become a scientist. After graduating from Waltrip High School in 1967, she sold cosmetics at Foley&#x27;s, a department store; she attended South Texas Junior College and majored in nutrition and diet therapy. Duvall dropped out of college shortly after when she witnessed a monkey vivisection.

== Career ==

=== 1970s ===
On April Fool&#x27;s Day 1970, Duvall was hosting a party in Houston for her artist boyfriend, Bernard Sampson, when three crew members in town for Brewster McCloud (1970) pre-production arrived. Intrigued by Duvall&#x27;s offbeat looks and hyper-enthusiasm, they invited her to pitch Bernard’s paintings the next day to &quot;art patrons&quot;. In a surreptitious casting call led by Altman, Bert Remsen, and Lou Adler, they asked her to be part of the feature instead. Altman reflected on casting Shelley: &quot;I was really quite mean to her, as I thought she was an actress. But she wasn’t kidding; that was her. She was an untrained, truthful person. She was very raw in Brewster but quite magic.&quot; Filmed in the summer of 1970, Duvall appeared in the film as Suzanne Davis, an Astrodome tour guide and the free-spirited love interest to Bud Cort&#x27;s reclusive Brewster. Beatrice Loayza of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; said the character &quot;would&#x27;ve seemed innocuous enough were it not for the actor&#x27;s hypnotic charms&quot;. After filming ended Duvall left Texas for the first time flying across the country with duties to promote the film, appearing in several publications and photoshoots such as Vogue and Show Magazine. Following Brewster McCloud, Duvall became a protégé of Altman. He chose Duvall for roles as an unsatisfied mail-order bride in &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot;, released in 1971, and the daughter of a convict in &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;, released in 1974. It was her role as the forlorn Keechie in &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; that made her want to take acting seriously. Duvall reflected on this turning point: “Until then it had been a piece of cake. Then I began realizing about technique, began learning, began being a little scared.&quot; Duvall had her breakthrough for playing a spaced-out groupie in Altman&#x27;s 1975 ensemble comedy &quot;Nashville&quot;, which was a critical and commercial success. Keith Carradine, who collaborated with Duvall on &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; and &quot;Nashville&quot;, told &quot;Variety&quot;: &quot;She had that fascinating physical appearance, there was something slightly off-center and hauntingly beautiful about her. And then she had that extraordinary personality; she was quirky and just utterly enchanting. What you saw on screen, that&#x27;s just who she was.&quot; In 1976, she played the First Lady, wife of Grover Cleveland, in &quot;Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull&#x27;s History Lesson&quot;. The same year, Duvall starred as Bernice, a wealthy girl from Wisconsin in PBS&#x27;s adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s short story &quot;Bernice Bobs Her Hair&quot;. During this time, she became close friends with other budding stars: Dennis Christopher and Gary Springer. 

In 1977, Duvall gave what some critics considered to be one of her best performances in Altman&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;3 Women&quot;, portraying Mildred &quot;Millie&quot; Lammoreaux, a woman living in a dreary California desert town. Although there was a written screenplay, Duvall, like other cast members, improvised many of her lines. In spite of the film not being a major box-office success, it received critical acclaim. &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; critics Marie Brenner and Jesse Kornbluth praised Duvall for giving an &quot;extraordinary performance&quot;. Michael Sragow of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called her &quot;brilliant: she coins a brand-new caricature of the confident yet clueless single female, then suggests a real person underneath.&quot; Robbie Freeling of &quot;IndieWire&quot; believed the film succeeded because of Duvall: &quot;it&#x27;s one of the finest films of the seventies, and Duvall deserves a lion&#x27;s share of the credit.&quot; Her performance garnered the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, as well as a British Academy Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role nomination. That same year, she appeared in a minor role in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977), and hosted an evening of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, appearing in five sketches: &quot;Programming Change&quot;, &quot;Video Vixens&quot;, &quot;Night of the Moonies&quot;, &quot;Van Arguments&quot;, and &quot;Goodnights&quot;.

=== 1980s ===
Duvall&#x27;s next role was portraying Wendy Torrance in the horror film &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980), directed by Stanley Kubrick. Jack Nicholson said in the 2001 documentary &quot;Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures&quot; that Kubrick was great to work with but that he was &quot;a different director&quot; with her. Because of his methodical nature, principal photography took a year to complete. The film&#x27;s script was changed so often that Nicholson stopped reading each draft. Kubrick antagonized his actors, and he and she argued frequently. He intentionally isolated her and went through exhausting shoots, such as the baseball bat scene, which she had performed 127 times. Afterward, she presented Kubrick with clumps of hair that had fallen out due to the extreme stress of filming. For the last nine months of shooting, she said that the role required her to cry twelve hours a day, five or six days a week, and &quot;it was so difficult being hysterical for that length of time&quot;. In an interview with Roger Ebert, Duvall said that making the film was &quot;almost unbearable. But from other points of view, really very nice, I suppose.&quot; In a 2001 interview, she later said &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t trade the experience for anything. Why? Because of Stanley. And it was a fascinating learning experience, it was such intense work that I think it makes you smarter. But I wouldn&#x27;t want to go through it again.&quot; In a 2021 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Duvall spoke openly of the emotional toll of the role and the challenges of long days on the set, but said that Kubrick was &quot;very warm and friendly&quot; to her.

Despite positive reviews of her performance, she was controversially nominated for Worst Actress at the Golden Raspberry Awards&#x27; inaugural ceremony; it was rescinded on March 31, 2022, and Golden Raspberries cofounder Maureen Murphy said she regretted nominating Duvall. Anne Billson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;Duvall&#x27;s horrified reactions as her husband reveals himself to be a mortal threat provide the film with many of its iconic moments.&quot; Bilge Ebiri of &quot;Vulture&quot; wrote: &quot;Looking into Duvall&#x27;s huge eyes from the front row of a theater, I found myself riveted by a very poignant form of fear. Not the fear of an actor out of her element, or the more mundane fear of a victim being chased around by an ax-wielding maniac. Rather, it was something far more disquieting, and familiar: the fear of a wife who&#x27;s experienced her husband at his worst, and is terrified that she&#x27;ll experience it again.&quot; Jessica Jalali of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked it the best performance of her career, calling her &quot;the heart of the film; she is out of her depth in dealing with her husband&#x27;s looming insanity while trying to protect her young son, all while being fearful of the malevolence around her&quot;. Tim Grierson of RogerEbert.com similarly called it one of her best performances, writing that &quot;This is no simple &quot;scream queen&quot; performance as Duvall makes Wendy&#x27;s terror and determination grippingly, movingly real. Did Kubrick push her to extremes to reach such heights? Perhaps, but the accomplishment is Duvall&#x27;s, full stop.&quot;
While Duvall was in London shooting &quot;The Shining&quot;, Robert Altman cast her to portray Olive Oyl in his big-screen adaptation of &quot;Popeye&quot;, opposite Robin Williams. The film was a commercial success despite negative critical reviews, while Duvall was praised for her performance. Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;Duvall is like a precious piece of china with a tinkling personality. She looks and sounds like almost nobody else, and if it is true that she was born to play the character Olive Oyl (and does so in Altman&#x27;s new musical &quot;Popeye&quot;), it is also true that she has possibly played more really different kinds of characters than almost any other young actress of the 1970s.&quot; Duvall&#x27;s role of Pansy in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981) followed. In 1982, Duvall narrated, hosted, and was executive producer of the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;. She starred in seven episodes of the series; &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; (1982), &quot;Rapunzel&quot; (1983), &quot;The Nightingale&quot; (1983), &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1984), &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (1985), and &quot;Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp&quot; (1986). Before the program&#x27;s first episode &quot;The Frog Prince&quot;, which starred Robin Williams and Teri Garr, Duvall produced 27 hour-long episodes of the program. In 1985, she created &quot;Tall Tales &amp; Legends&quot;, another one-hour anthology series for Showtime, which featured adaptations of American folk tales. As with &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;, the series starred well-known Hollywood actors with Duvall as host, executive producer, and occasional guest star. The series ran for nine episodes and garnered Duvall an Emmy nomination.

While Duvall was producing &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;, it was reported that she was to star as the lead in the film adaptation of Tom Robbins&#x27;s &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;, which was also to star Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, Cindy Hall, and Sissy Spacek. The project was delayed and when finally released in 1993, starred an entirely different cast. She landed roles in films and television series: the mother of a boy whose dog is struck by car in Tim Burton&#x27;s short film &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; (1984), and as Laura Burroughs in &quot;Booker&quot; (also 1984), a biographical television short based on the life of Booker T. Washington, directed by Stan Lathan. Of her role in &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;, Jacob Slankard of &quot;Collider&quot; described Duvall as &quot;the most persuasive tool&quot; Burton had, and believed he succeeded in &quot;calling on an actress who can signal to the audience that she&#x27;s much more than her initial bearings make her out to be, and that was Duvall&#x27;s specialty.&quot; Next, Duvall appeared as a lonely and timid woman who receives a message from a flying saucer in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Once and Future King/A Saucer of Loneliness&quot;, and the friend of Steve Martin&#x27;s character in the comedy &quot;Roxanne&quot; (1987).

In 1988, Duvall founded a new production company called Think Entertainment to develop programs and television movies for cable channels. She had started another production company, Platypus, in 1982. She created &quot;Nightmare Classics&quot; (1989), a third Showtime anthology series, which featured adaptations of well-known horror stories by authors including Edgar Allan Poe. Unlike the previous two series, &quot;Nightmare Classics&quot; was aimed at a teenage and adult audience. It was the least successful series that Duvall produced for Showtime and ran for only four episodes.

=== 1990s ===

In 1990, she played Little Bo Peep in &quot;Mother Goose Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Rhyme&quot;, which she also produced. In 1991, Duvall portrayed Jenny Wilcox, the wife of Charlie Wilcox (Christopher Lloyd) in the Hulk Hogan action-adventure film &quot;Suburban Commando&quot;. In October of the same year, Duvall released two compact discs, &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Shelley Duvall... Sweet Dreams,&quot; which feature Duvall singing lullaby songs and &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Shelley Duvall... Merry Christmas&quot;, on which Duvall sings Christmas songs. In 1992, Think Entertainment joined the newly formed Universal Family Entertainment to create Duvall&#x27;s fourth Showtime original series, &quot;Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Bedtime Stories&quot;, which featured animated adaptations of children&#x27;s storybooks with celebrity narrators and garnered her a second Emmy nomination. Duvall produced a fifth series for Showtime, &quot;Mrs. Piggle Wiggle&quot;, before selling Think Entertainment in 1993 and retiring as a producer.

Duvall landed a 1992 guest spot on the television series &quot;L.A. Law&quot; as Margo Stanton, a show dog owner and breeder who presses charges against the owner of a Welsh Corgi that mated with her prize-winning Afghan Hound. She next appeared as the vain, over-friendly, but harmless Countess Gemini—sister to the calculating Gilbert Osmond (John Malkovich)—in Jane Campion&#x27;s 1996 adaptation of the Henry James novel &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;. In 1997, she played a beatific nun in the comedy film &quot;Changing Habits&quot; and a besotted, murderous, ostrich-farm owner in Guy Maddin&#x27;s fourth feature &quot;Twilight of the Ice Nymphs&quot;. In the same year, she played Chris Cooper&#x27;s character&#x27;s gullible wife who yearns for a better life in Horton Foote&#x27;s made-for-television film, &quot;Alone&quot;.

Duvall continued to make film and television appearances throughout the late-1990s. In 1998, she played Mrs. Jackson in the comedy &quot;Home Fries&quot; and Gabby in the direct-to-video children&#x27;s film &quot;Casper Meets Wendy&quot;. Near the end of the decade, she returned to the horror genre with a minor role in &quot;Tale of the Mummy&quot; (1998), co-starring Christopher Lee and Gerard Butler, and &quot;The 4th Floor&quot; (1999), co-starring Juliette Lewis. In 1994, Duvall relocated from Hollywood to her home state of Texas.

=== 2000s ===
In the 2000s, Duvall accepted minor roles, including as the mother of Matthew Lawrence&#x27;s character in the horror-comedy &quot;Boltneck&quot; (2000) and as Haylie Duff&#x27;s aunt in the independent family film &quot;Dreams in the Attic&quot;, which was sold to the Disney Channel but was never released. After a small role in the 2002 independent film &quot;Manna from Heaven,&quot; Duvall took an extended hiatus from acting and public life. In an interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine, Duvall said of her retirement: &quot;It&#x27;s the longest sabbatical I ever took, but it was for really important reasons—to get in touch with my family again.&quot; During this time, she kept her personal life private, which nonetheless received media coverage.

=== 2020s ===

After a 20-year absence, it was announced in October 2022 that Duvall would be acting in &quot;The Forest Hills&quot;, an independent horror-thriller film directed and written by Scott Goldberg. The film is about a man &quot;tormented by nightmarish visions after experiencing head trauma in the Catskill woods.&quot; Initially playing a cameo role, Duvall joined the ensemble after expressing interest in performing more scenes. She described her acting comeback as &quot;so much fun&quot; and joked that &quot;Jessica Tandy won an Oscar when she was 80. I can still win.&quot; To &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Goldberg described Duvall as &quot;an amazing actress to work with, and I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to direct her.&quot;

A trailer for &quot;The Forest Hills&quot; was released in November 2022, and it premiered at Smodcastle Cinemas in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey in March 2023. A second trailer was released in September 2024, and the film was digitally released in October 2024.

== Personal life and death ==

=== Relationships ===
Duvall married artist Bernard Sampson in 1970, but their marriage disintegrated as Duvall&#x27;s acting career accelerated, leading to their divorce in 1974. She met 24-year-old tobacco heir Patrick Reynolds in a Hollywood nightclub. Duvall invited Reynolds to the set of Nashville, where director Robert Altman cast him in the film. Reynolds and Duvall lived together until 1976.

While she was shooting &quot;Annie Hall&quot; in New York in 1976, Duvall met singer-songwriter Paul Simon. The couple began a relationship and lived together for two years. Their relationship ended when Duvall introduced Simon to her friend, actress Carrie Fisher, and the two began dating. Duvall briefly dated singer Ringo Starr in 1978. 

Duvall was in a relationship with musician and former Breakfast Club lead vocalist Dan Gilroy from 1989 through the remainder of her life. The pair began their relationship after she cast him in &quot;Mother Goose Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Rhyme&quot;. She had no children, but always had a menagerie of pets.

After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Duvall and Gilroy moved from Benedict Canyon in Los Angeles to Blanco, southwest of Austin, Texas. She decided to return to her home state in 1994, while shooting the Steven Soderbergh film &quot;The Underneath&quot;. She told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that her reasons for moving were the health of one of her brothers and the earthquake. In 2002, Duvall retired from acting for 21 years. 

=== Mental health ===
In November 2016, Duvall was interviewed by Phil McGraw on his daytime talk show, &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, about her mental illness. The segment received significant criticism from the public,&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk/2019/10/30/shelley-duvall&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with some claiming she was exploited. Vivian Kubrick, daughter of director Stanley Kubrick, posted an open letter to McGraw on Twitter, while actress Mia Farrow tweeted that it was &quot;upsetting and unethical to exploit Shelley Duvall at this vulnerable time in her life&quot;.

Director Lee Unkrich located Duvall in 2018 to interview her for his Taschen book on The Shining. Unkrich noted that Duvall remained very proud of her career. In 2021, Seth Abramovitch, writer for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, found Duvall for an interview saying, &quot;I only knew that it didn&#x27;t feel right for McGraw&#x27;s insensitive sideshow to be the final word on her legacy.&quot; The article noted that her memory was &quot;sharp and full of engrossing stories&quot;.

=== Death ===
After several months in hospice care, Duvall died due to complications from diabetes at her home in Blanco, on July 11, 2024 a few days after celebrating her 75th birthday. Her death was announced by Gilroy to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. Several tributes were posted to Duvall, including messages from Stephen King and the Stanley Kubrick estate.

== Legacy ==

Duvall was known for her charismatic, upbeat presence, and is considered one of the most successful actresses of the 1970s. Four of her films have been inducted in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;: &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971), &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980). For her role in the lattermost, she was established as a scream queen by several publications. &quot;MovieWeb&quot; ranked Duvall as the fifth-best scream queen of all time, writing that her performance in &quot;The Shining&quot; was &quot;a thing of glory&quot;.

Beatrice Loayza of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; said that Duvall was &quot;made for the screen&quot; and called her &quot;a gravitational force&quot;. Günseli Yalcinkaya of &quot;Dazed&quot; dubbed her the &quot;queen of awkward beauty&quot; and &quot;one of the most magnetic on-screen presences of the last century.&quot; Robert Lang of &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; deemed Duvall as the 1970s &quot;cinema&#x27;s new darling&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described her as &quot;unique and often misunderstood&quot; and said she &quot;was intensely modern, the very face of the New American Cinema, but was also in her slender grace and wide-eyed charm, and her way with a cigarette, a neo-flapper, a kind of 20s or 30s woman reborn long after the second world war which also made her an excellent casting choice in period movies.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her a &quot;fixture&quot; of Hollywood, and wrote: &quot;With her gossamer frame and toothy smile, she was one of the biggest film stars of the 1970s.&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; critic Pauline Kael once called her the &quot;female Buster Keaton&quot; and believed she was &quot;bizarrely original… able to be herself on the screen in a way that nobody has ever been before.&quot; Giacomo Aricò of &quot;Vogue&quot; deemed her &quot;bewitching&quot; and a &quot;master of cinema&quot;.

Jamie Lee Curtis cited Duvall as an influence, writing: &quot;She showed that you could change and grow and develop and, of course, now we see so many wonderful actresses and actors become producers and directors and creators. Thank you, Shelley Duvall. You are a legend.&quot; Julianne Moore called Duvall &quot;one of the women that made me want to become an actress. She was fascinating, original, vulnerable and inscrutable all at once.&quot; Others who have praised her work in tributes include Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, Daryl Hannah, Michael Palin, Malcolm McDowell, and Paul Simon.

In the 2020s, clips of Duvall hosting &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; went viral on social media, such as TikTok, where the phrase &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Shelley Duvall&quot; has frequently been sampled. The resurgence of &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; helped introduce her to Generation Z. Since 2021, Sarah Lukowski of the online Shelley Duvall Archive has been documenting Duvall&#x27;s extensive career and post-Hollywood life as a fan-turned-friend of the reclusive star.

Duvall&#x27;s death spurred several tribute screenings in theaters around the United States. In August and September 2024, several of Duvall&#x27;s films were shown at the Brattle Theatre. The Brooklyn Academy of Music screened Duvall&#x27;s films in November 2024. In December 2024, the Austin Film Society hosted a four-day series in celebration of Shelley&#x27;s achievements in film and television. The 2024 Primetime Emmy Awards attracted controversy after Duvall and others were omitted from the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment, instead being placed on a memoriam list on the Television Academy website.

<doc id="1055132" wikidata="Q1921686" url="?curid=1055132" title="Meridian 59">
<text>Meridian 59 is a 1996 video game developed by Archetype Interactive and published by The 3DO Company. It was the first 3D graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) and one of the longest running original online role-playing games. The development team included John Hanke, who later founded Niantic, Inc. and codeveloped Google Earth and &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;.

The game was launched online in an early form on December 15, 1995, and released commercially on October 7, 1996, with a flat-rate monthly subscription. &quot;Meridian 59&quot; was later released as open source software, run by original developers Andrew Kirmse and Chris Kirmse.

== Development ==

&quot;Meridian 59&quot; (abbreviated &quot;M59&quot;) was developed by Archetype Interactive and published in September 1996 by 3DO. &quot;Meridian 59&quot; is the only product Archetype Interactive ever released, and the company was acquired by 3DO in June 1996. Archetype was run by Steve Sellers, Mike Sellers, and John Hanke, with Andrew Kirmse and Chris Kirmse filling key technical roles. Damion Schubert contributed to the design along with a team totaling 22 employees and contractors. The game&#x27;s technological base was initially inspired by &quot;Scepter of Goth&quot;.

The game was in an early beta stage in April 1996 when it was noticed by Kevin Hester and other game developers at 3DO. Trip Hawkins, CEO of 3DO, recognized the forward-looking value of the game and the company, and 3DO bought Archetype in June 1996.

The characters were structured so that faces are presented in the highest resolution, while the less important torso and legs use a lower resolution in order to increase access speed. Approximately 17,000 players joined the game&#x27;s public beta that lasted up until its worldwide commercial launch on October 7, 1996, beating its next major rival, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, by approximately a year. The servers divided players into parallel game worlds, each populated by a few hundred people, in order to keep each world from being overly crowded.

Prior to its release, the term &quot;massively multiplayer&quot; and the acronym &quot;MMPRPG&quot;, &quot;Massively Multi-Player Role-Playing Game&quot;, emerged in meetings within 3DO (beating out other monikers such as &quot;large-n game&quot;), as did the now-ubiquitous monthly subscription model. At the time, AOL was still charging per minute for online access, though a change to flat fees was anticipated. The game has received various updates throughout its life, each adding new monsters, spells, and areas. In its early years it was commonly conceived of as a graphical MUD, though this term, and &quot;Meridian 59&quot;&#x27;s preferred &quot;MMPRPG&quot;, was eventually displaced by the now-ubiquitous &quot;massively multiplayer online role-playing game&quot;, a term coined by Richard Garriott of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; in 1997.

3DO shut down the game on August 31, 2000 and it was re-released by Near Death Studios, Inc. in 2002. Near Death Studios was co-founded by former &quot;Meridian 59&quot; developers Rob &quot;Q&quot; Ellis and Brian &quot;Psychochild&quot; Green. A new rendering engine was added to the game in the &quot;Evolution&quot; expansion in October 2004, offering an alternative to its &quot;Doom&quot;-esque graphics. This expansion also includes features like dynamic lighting, rebindable keys, mouselook, and other visual improvements.

Shortly after 3DO shut the game down on August 31, 2000 a developer of the game leaked the server software and the files for Meridian 59: Renaissance to a player, and since then there has been a thriving community of free-to-play servers.

Near Death Studios announced that the company would be ceasing operations on January 6, 2010, after which &quot;Meridian 59&quot; would continue running, but not as a commercial concern of Near Death Studios. In February 2010, &quot;Meridian 59&quot; was turned over to the original technical developers, Andrew and Chris Kirmse. On September 15, 2012, the team released the game to the public as freeware and most of the source code under the GPLv2 license. For a while, &quot;Meridian 59&quot; had an international presence, with servers operating in Germany, run by the company MDO (active 2002-2009), and Russia, in addition to a &quot;Sacred Haven&quot; (non-PvP) server operated by Skotos. These are no longer operational.

==Gameplay==
The game is now aimed primarily at fans of PvP (Player vs Player) combat, as it is virtually lag free and has a player-run justice system implemented to mediate killing of other players. Unlike many online RPGs, it is not based around character levels and classes. Instead, each individual skill and attribute, including health, develop independently of one another. Hit points (health) are acquired by killing monsters that are a challenge for the player. Mana (magic points) is acquired by exploring and finding mana nodes in the game world. All base attributes except karma are static, but they can be adjusted with certain items and spells temporarily.

Players can develop their character by obtaining proficiency in skills from seven schools. There is a school of weaponcraft and six schools of magic based on patron gods in the game world&#x27;s mythos: Shal&#x27;ille, Qor, Kraanan, Faren, Riija, and Jala. Each school has a different focus and application in gameplay. Unlike character classes in other MMORPGs, players need not limit themselves to a single school: the rate of learning and total number of proficiency levels across all schools a player can attain is limited by their intelligence stat.

The game contains many features that modern games duplicated later: guilds have a dynamic voting system for changing leadership, customized sigils that appear on shields, and guild halls that can be won or lost. There are also in-game bulletin board systems (called newsglobes), a personal mail system that both players and NPCs can use to send messages, a political meta-game, and frequent expansions that expand the world and gameplay options.

===Setting===
&quot;Meridian 59&quot; is a typical sword and sorcery setting where adventurers go out and fight monsters. In the game, there are few NPCs, with most of them static and unchanging. Most of the focus is on the activities of the players as they fight against the monsters in the land.

The game is set in the 59th provincial colony of an ancient empire which explored the universe through portals in a magical nexus. However, several hundred years ago, something went wrong and the young frontier colonies in &quot;Meridian 59&quot; were separated from the Empire. Now the land is in turmoil. Political factions fight for territory and power, monsters, trolls, orcs, and the undead threaten to destroy all life, and the magical nexus is in a flux, causing disasters across the land. &quot;Meridian 59&quot; features six cities and towns: the rebellious mining town of Jasper, the royal city of Barloque, the thriving but troubled Tos, the peaceful farming village of Marion, the crossroads lake-side university town of Cor Noth, and the independent jungle island settlement of Ko&#x27;Catan.

===Schools===
Weaponcraft - Physical combat, including dodging, parrying, weapons skills, archery, shields, and disarming.

Shal&#x27;ille - Based on the patron goddess of rain and peace. Healing, protection, uncursing, harming evil, curing, resurrecting, and making truces.

Qor - Based on the patron goddess of evil and darkness. Damage, blindness, curses, and other ailments to control or harm opponents, as well as invisibility.

Kraanan - Based on the patron god of war and valor. Combat &quot;buffs&quot;, resistance to various kinds of spells, attribute modifiers, and miscellaneous other utilitarian spells with practical applications in combat.

Faren - Based on the god of the earth and the elements. Mostly Area of Effect and Direct Damage spells based on lightning, ice, wind, fire, and other natural forces. This school also contains spells to resist the elements.

Riija - Based on the patron god of illusion and trickery. Spells used to deceive players or confuse monsters, including hiding information, summoning illusory minions, and spells to manipulate the mind. Riija is also home to the most powerful teleportation spell in &quot;Meridian 59&quot;.

Jala - Based on the patron goddess of music and artistry. The School of Jala consists of songs and jingles which have magical effects on all entities in the area, including negation of the effects of the other schools of magic, creation of potions and enchanted magical items, and mana and health regeneration.

===Organizations===
Players can join one of three political factions: Jonas D&#x27;Accor&#x27;s rebels, the throne of Princess Kateriina, or that of her rival in Tos, Duke Akardius. Each faction offers certain bonuses to specific types of players. The rebels are seated in Jasper, Kateriina in Barloque, and Akardius in Tos. Players fight one another in the name of their respective factions either for territory or for control of tokens of power which may be used to sway the votes of the councilors of the land.

Players can also join player-created guilds. These are typically just small groups of friends who help each other out and socialize together, but sometimes they are more elaborate than that. There are often guild wars, in which multiple guilds fight one another in mortal combat to seize resources such as a Guild Hall or to declare total dominance of the server.

Previously, players could ally themselves with the warring Necromancer and Hunter factions. These factions each drastically altered the way the game was played for their members, and there were great rewards for killing members of the opposite faction. When Near Death Studios took over control of the game, this element was disabled. Instead, this PvP scenario has been reworked into faction wars. Players take on the role of soldiers under one of the three factions, and each faction gives its soldiers special benefits. Soldiers receive a shield indicating their factional allegiance and gain additional stat rewards when they kill opposing faction members.

==Reception==
Reviewing the &quot;Revelation&quot; update, &quot;Next Generation&quot; described the game as &quot;second-best&quot; next to &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. They particularly commented that while the update expanded the game world by 50%, it still felt small and overcrowded with too little to do in it.

By June 1999, &quot;Meridian 59&quot;″s retail sales in the United States had reached 14,359 units, according to PC Data. A writer for GameDaily called these numbers &quot;minuscule&quot;, and remarked that it had &quot;clearly fizzled on store shelves&quot;. However, the publication noted that 3DO had changed its business model to rely on online shopping and microtransactions, and had seen monetary success despite its poor sales in stores. &quot;Next Generation&quot; columnist Christian Svensson commented that despite the game&#x27;s monthly pricing being roundly derided by a panel consisting of the heads of seven leading online gaming services at the September 1996 Online Game Developer&#x27;s Conference, who said any flat rate system was unsustainable and &quot;naive&quot;, &quot;Since that time, we have seen the official launch of many online gaming services, and most have learned what consumers and the press have been telling them all along: A fair flat rate is the only way services will get subscribers.&quot;

The game received multiple awards, including the fantasy-role-playing game of the year for 1996. It was a finalist for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1996 &quot;Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall&quot;. However, it won CNET Gamecenter&#x27;s award in this category. The editors called it &quot;arguably one of the truest role-playing games ever.&quot; The &quot;Dark Auspices&quot; expansion was named as a finalist by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences for &quot;Online Role-Playing Game of the Year at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, which ultimately went to &quot;Ultima Online: The Second Age&quot;.

The game is known as the first 3D graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) and stands as one of the longest running original online role-playing games.

<text>USS &quot;Pomodon&quot; (SS-486), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the &quot;Pomodon&quot; (an obsolete synonym for &quot;Hemilutjanus&quot;) genera of snapper.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Pomodon&quot;′s keel was laid down on 29 January 1945 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 12 June 1945 sponsored by Mrs. Lorena Neff, and commissioned on 11 September 1945.

==Departure==
Departing Portsmouth 6 January 1946, &quot;Pomodon&quot; slipped through the Cape Cod Canal and set her course for the Panama Canal Zone for further training. By May the submarine was back north to New London, Connecticut, for several days operations before an availability and upkeep period at New London.

Slipping out of the Submarine Base at New London, &quot;Pomodon&quot; set her course southward again; transited the Panama Canal arriving San Diego, California, on 12 October, and joined Submarine Squadron 3. After alterations at Mare Island from 25 October 1946 to 26 July 1947 had made &quot;Pomodon&quot; the first Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY) submarine in the Pacific Fleet, the submarine returned to San Diego on 28 July and began operations in the area as part of Task Forces 52 and 56.

==Korean hostilities==
At the outbreak of hostilities in Korea in July 1950, &quot;Pomodon&quot; was deployed to Pearl Harbor. In January 1951, &quot;Pomodon&quot; was again modernized at Mare Island Naval Shipyard and in May 1951 she returned to service as the most modern and advanced GUPPY submarine in the Submarine Force.

&quot;Pomodon&quot; departed San Diego in November 1951 for a six-month deployment with the United Nations Forces in Korea, followed by operations in the San Diego area. During the next decade, the submarine made six more WestPac deployments.

==Explosion==
On 21 February 1955, while recharging batteries in the San Francisco Naval Yard, a build-up of hydrogen gas caused an explosion and fire, damaging the submarine and killing five men. TM1(SS) Charles E. Payne earned the Navy Commendation Ribbon with Metal Pendant (later renamed as the Navy Commendation Medal) by his actions in fighting the fire and rescuing the injured. Pasquale Talladino EnD2(SS) received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal. After the third explosion he entered the control room through the conning tower in an attempt to rescue anyone who might still be alive.

==Final deployments==
On 16 November 1962, &quot;Pomodon&quot; sank the hulk of ex-&quot;Aspro&quot; (SS-309).
&quot;Pomodon&quot;’s eighth deployment with the Seventh Fleet, 6 June to 30 November 1966, took her to Vietnamese waters and she operated with American destroyers and antisubmarine aircraft carrier on Yankee Station. Training operations on the West Coast and overhaul at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, filled 1967. She again headed west across the Pacific for her ninth deployment on 22 March 1968. She operated in Japanese waters, off Okinawa, and in the Philippines before entering the Vietnam combat zone 13 August. &quot;Pomodon&quot; returned to San Diego 17 October 1968.

==Disposal==
Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1970, &quot;Pomodon&quot; was sold on 28 December 1971.

<text>&quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot; (originally &quot;My Girl Sloopy&quot;) is a 1964 song written by Wes Farrell and Bert Berns. Rhythm and blues vocal group the Vibrations were the first to record the tune in 1964. Atlantic Records released it as a single, which reached No. 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The song is associated with Ohio State University and is Ohio&#x27;s official rock song.

The song became standard fare for garage bands and, in 1965, it became one of the first songs recorded by the Yardbirds with guitarist Jeff Beck. A version by the rock group the McCoys was the most successful, when it reached number one in the singles chart. Recordings by additional artists also reached the charts, including versions in Spanish and Portuguese.

By one account, the inspiration for the song was Dorothy Sloop, a jazz singer from Steubenville, Ohio, and a student at Ohio University.

==McCoys version==
In early 1965, the Strangeloves, a New York City rock band, wanted to make the song the follow-up to their hit single &quot;I Want Candy&quot; and began performing it in concert. However, the Dave Clark Five, with whom they were touring, told the Strangeloves that they were going to record their own version when they returned to England, copying the Strangeloves&#x27; arrangement. The Strangeloves realized that the Dave Clark Five&#x27;s cut would likely be a hit, but they were not yet ready to release a new single because they were still enjoying the success of &quot;I Want Candy&quot; from a few months earlier.

The answer presented itself when a young rock group named Rick and the Raiders opened (and provided backing) for the Strangeloves in July in Dayton, Ohio. The Strangeloves, three writer-producers from Brooklyn, New York City, recruited Rick and the Raiders to record the song under their name. Their 16-year-old leader, Rick Zehringer, was flown to Bell Sound Studios in New York to record his lead vocal over the Strangeloves&#x27; already-recorded backing tracks. It was decided to change the name of Rick&#x27;s group to the McCoys to avoid confusion with another popular band at the time, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, and Rick began using the stage name Rick Derringer. The single was issued on Bang Records and entered the chart on August 14, 1965. It reached the top position on October 2. Contrary to the Strangeloves&#x27; expectations, the Dave Clark Five version was never even released.

Originally written and recorded with three verses, the retitled &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot; was edited down to two verses for the single and resulting &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot; album. &quot;Record World&quot; responded positively: &quot;Teens will hang on to this new Bang slice, since the rhythmic song about a hard luck girl is riveting.&quot; The unedited three-verse version, at 3 minutes, 50 seconds, first appeared on the 1970 Bang various artists compilation &quot;Bang &amp; Shout Super Hits&quot; (BLPS-220), then again on the 1991 Rhino Records various artists compilation &quot;Grandson of Frat Rock! Vol. 3&quot; and the 1995 Legacy Recordings compilation &quot;Hang On Sloopy: The Best of the McCoys&quot;.

==Legacy==
===The Yardbirds===
In 1964, Eric Clapton, who was then lead guitarist for the Yardbirds, introduced the group to the Vibration&#x27;s &quot;My Girl Sloopy&quot;. Before they could record the tune, however, Clapton left the group. During his second recording session on April 13, 1965, with the Yardbirds, new guitarist Jeff Beck and the group recorded the song at the Advision Studios in London. Their 5:36 rendition was considered unusual for a studio recording at the time; AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder called it &quot;the first extended jam to emerge on record from a band on the British blues scene&quot;. Group chronicler Greg Russo also commented on the group&#x27;s &quot;humorous take [in which they] used out of control vocal buildups&quot;, which was part of their live performances, such as at the fifth Richmond National Jazz and Blues Festival on August 6.

When looking for material for the Yardbirds&#x27; first American album, manager Giorgio Gomelsky included &quot;My Girl Sloopy&quot; and two other tracks recorded at Advision with Beck. The hastily produced album was released on July 5, 1965, to generate interest for the group&#x27;s upcoming first US tour. On August 11, the three songs formed the Yardbirds&#x27; first extended play (EP) release in the UK, where it reached number two on the record chart.

===Other charting versions===
* Little Caesar and the Consuls released a version of the song in 1965 that reached No. 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart and No. 3 in Canada. 
* The Ramsey Lewis Trio recorded the song for their 1965 live album &quot;Hang On Ramsey!&quot;; it reached No. 6 on the US R&amp;B chart, No. 11 on the US pop chart, No. 18 on the US adult contemporary chart, No. 37 on the Canadian pop charts, and No. 2 on the Canadian AC charts.
* &quot;Es Lupe&quot;, a Spanish-language cover version by Los Johnny Jets, was released in 1965. It topped the Mexican charts for 13 weeks.
* Leno e Lílian, a Brazilian vocal duo, released a cover version in Portuguese (“Pobre Menina”) in January 1966 that topped the Brazilian charts.
* The Lettermen released a version of the song in 1970 that reached No. 18 on the US adult contemporary chart and No. 93 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
* Rick Derringer released a version of the song in 1975 that reached No. 94 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 81 in Canada. The 1975 version, a track on his &quot;Spring Fever&quot; album and also a 45 RPM single, omitted some of the original lyrics and added steel drums and vibes. This 1975 release was also made into an early music film/video featuring a blond dancing girl, identified in 2021 as Lisa Leonard Dalton. Nineteen years of age at the time, she had been the 1974 dance champion at Gazzarri&#x27;s nightclub on the Sunset Strip. 
* The Sandpipers released a version of the song in 1976 that reached No. 32 on the UK Singles Chart.
===Other cover versions===
Svenne &amp; Lotta (Sven Hedlund and Charlotte Walker) on their LP album &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; (Polar Records 1978, POLS 281, produced by Michael B. Tretow).

===The Ohio State University===
The song gained an association with Ohio State University after its marching band began playing it at football games. It first played the song October 9, 1965, after a staff arranger, John Tatgenhorst, begged the director to try playing it. After finally convincing the director, Tatgenhorst prepared an arrangement and the band played the song in front of the stadium. After the crowd reaction, the band began to play it at every game. The song is traditionally played during the transition from the 3rd quarter to the 4th quarter at Ohio Stadium. Since then, &quot;Sloopy&quot; has been appearing on the band&#x27;s CDs and was available as a free download on its website. A vocal performance excerpt is also available for download on the university&#x27;s website.

Home games of professional sports teams throughout Ohio also feature the song. As is the case at Ohio State, fans usually chant the letters &quot;O, H, I, O&quot; during the pauses in the chorus while mimicking the shape of the letters with their arms.

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band covered this song live in concert at the university&#x27;s Schottenstein Center in 1999. When the Rolling Stones played Ohio Stadium on May 30, 2015, as part of their Zip Code Tour, they also performed the song.

When the marching band performed the song pregame during the 2016 College Football Playoff semifinal, then-band announcer Dave Carwile introduced the song by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s just a part of who we are.&quot;

===Official rock song of the State of Ohio===
Later it became the official rock song of the State of Ohio and Ohio State University. In April 1985, Joe Dirck, columnist for the &quot;Columbus Citizen-Journal&quot;, saw a wire service story about a proposal to designate &quot;Louie, Louie&quot; as the official State song of Washington, and he subsequently wrote a series of tongue-in-cheek columns. He even registered as a lobbyist for the resolution. Dirck played bass guitar in rock bands and knew the McCoys, particularly Rick Derringer. He said it was a good fit because the McCoys were from the Dayton area, and Ohio State marching band had adopted it as an unofficial anthem. Both the public and its elected officials—most importantly, the 116th Ohio General Assembly became aware their State lacked an official song as a result of the exposure from his commentary. They designated &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot; as the state rock song by House Concurrent Resolution 16 on November 20, 1985, with clauses including:
::and
===Professional sports===
&quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot; is also a signature song for Major League Baseball&#x27;s Cleveland Guardians, who play at Progressive Field in Cleveland, Ohio, typically played during the middle of the 8th inning. The song also plays at the end of the 3rd quarter at FirstEnergy Stadium during every Cleveland Browns game, and is also played at Cleveland Cavaliers games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. During games it is common for fans to yell &quot;O-H-I-O!&quot; following the chorus.

<doc id="1055146" wikidata="Q349591" url="?curid=1055146" title="Adam Green (musician)">
<text>Adam Green (born May 28, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter, artist and filmmaker.

Green is well known for his involvement in the anti-folk music movement and as one half of the band the Moldy Peaches, alongside fellow singer-songwriter Kimya Dawson. Green has found success as a solo artist, enjoying increasing popularity in the United States as well as a number of European countries, particularly Germany.

==Career==
===Music===
Green attended Emerson College for one semester in 1998 before leaving to concentrate on his music, going on to co-found the Moldy Peaches with Kimya Dawson. In 2002, the Moldy Peaches went on hiatus, and both Green and Dawson embarked on solo careers.

Green released several albums on Rough Trade Records. Among his better known songs are &quot;Jessica&quot; (about singer Jessica Simpson), &quot;Novotel&quot;, &quot;Friends of Mine&quot;, &quot;Dance with Me&quot;, &quot;Carolina&quot; and &quot;Emily&quot;, and in the UK, his cover of The Libertines track &quot;What a Waster&quot;. &quot;Jessica&quot; (#63, 2004) and &quot;Emily&quot; (#53, 2005) both appeared in the UK Singles Chart.

Prior to &quot;Jacket Full of Danger&quot; in 2006, all of Green&#x27;s albums had been released on the 22nd of the month.

In January 2008, the Moldy Peaches began having a resurgence in popularity, due to their music being included in the hit indie film, &quot;Juno&quot;. Most notably, a duet between Green and Dawson, the Moldy Peaches song &quot;Anyone Else But You&quot; was featured in the film, and also in a scene which featured the film&#x27;s lead actors, Michael Cera and Elliot Page performing the song together. The soundtrack album reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on its third week of release.

In January 2010, Green released his sixth solo album, &quot;Minor Love&quot;, which was a slight departure from his previous works. Green says he wrote many of these songs in a clearer style so they were easier for the listener to understand. He also says the album was slightly more produced, creating a more offsetting sound, rather than being raw, and simple like his earlier work. Later in 2010, he also released another album, Musik for a Play, which was a collection of instrumentals made for a play soundtrack. For his next album, Green expressed interest in making a heavy metal-like album.

Following the release of these albums, Green took time off from making music, and focused his work as an artist and filmmaker. But he still performed during this time, even doing some shows with singer Binki Shapiro. In 2012, Green made references to an upcoming duet album with Shapiro, which was eventually announced in October 2012 on Green&#x27;s website. The song &quot;Here I Am&quot; from the album was also made available for download online. The album was released on January 29, 2013. Green is recording his next album, the soundtrack to his film &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

In September 2019 Green released the album &quot;Engine of Paradise&quot; via Danger Mouse&#x27;s record label 30th Century Records.

===Art===
In 2005, Green entered the professional art world with his exhibition of a series of drawings titled &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; at Loyal Gallery in Stockholm. Green&#x27;s art exhibition &quot;Teen Tech&quot; was displayed at New York&#x27;s Morrison Hotel Gallery for 10 days in April 2010 and consisting of twelve plaster sculptures, eighteen watercolor and acrylic large-scale (30&quot; x 40&quot;) paintings, nineteen drawings, twenty collages and papier-mâché and mixed-material works. A portion of &quot;Teen Tech&#x27;s&quot; proceeds went to benefit Artists for Peace and Justice, an effort to re-create and cultivate sustainability in Haiti. On June 9, 2012 Green&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Cartoon &amp; Complaint&quot; opened at Dustin Yellin&#x27;s art center and gallery The Intercourse in Red Hook, Brooklyn. In August 2012 The Hole Gallery in New York City announced that it would be showing a summer exhibition of Green&#x27;s work titled &quot;Houseface&quot;, a collection of works inspired by De Stijl and the architecture of Friedensreich Hundertwasser and Antoni Gaudí. Green&#x27;s Houseface paintings and sculptures were featured in a Stuart Weitzman shoe advertisement directed by James Franco entitled &quot;Walking After Midnight&quot;. Afterwards he formed an art collective named 3MB with Macaulay Culkin and Toby Goodshank. Their first exhibit Leisure Inferno opened at Le Poisson Rouge Gallery in October 2012. Green kicked off 2013 with &quot;Medieval Businessmen,&quot; an exhibit of drawings and paintings at Loyal Gallery in Sweden. In July he showed his visual art for the first time in Italy with &quot;The Yellow Show&quot;, a solo-exhibition that opened at Motel Salieri in Rome. The next month he had a show in Zurich with &quot;From A Darker Time,&quot; a show composed of older works. In September 2013 Green took part in a collaborative artshow with Pete Doherty and Fionn Regan entitled &quot;Noise Kids. In November Green exhibited in Vienna at the Viertelneun Gallery showing “A Land Recombined&quot;. His most recent show was at The Hole Gallery for his show &quot;Hot Chicks&quot;.

===Film===
On April 4, 2011, Green released his first film, entitled &quot;The Wrong Ferarri&quot;. The project, shot entirely on iPhone, was written, directed, and performed in by Green who claims to have conceived it under the influence of ketamine. Others appearing in the film included BP Fallon, Alia Shawkat, Devendra Banhart, Pete Doherty, Dev Hynes, Jeffrey Lewis, Sky Ferreira, Cory Kennedy and Macaulay Culkin.

In August 2013, Green announced that his next film would be a version of Aladdin, entitled Adam Green&#x27;s Aladdin. The film was successfully crowdfunded through Kickstarter in the spring of 2014. Filmed largely over the summer of 2014.

==Personal life==
Although Green was brought up in a secular Jewish home, his grandparents were very religious. His great-grandmother, Felice Bauer, was engaged to Franz Kafka; her family fled the Nazis in the late 1930s and relocated to New York.

Green&#x27;s brother Joel, an astronomer, has appeared as an accompanying musician on several recordings.

Green was married on July 4, 2013, to Yasmin Dolatabadi. They have two daughters.

Green is a friend of the musician Carl Barât, appearing in a documentary with him in 2005. It followed the pair on a night out in London, for the European television culture channel Arte.

<text>Warren DeWitt Clinton Hall (1794–1867), also called D.C. Hall, was an American and Texan lawyer, pioneer, and soldier. He was active in the Texas Revolution and acted as Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas in 1836. His brother was George Braxton Hall, part of the original 300 settlers in Texas. He was a Mason in Louisiana, and in the Republic of Texas, a Masonic symbol is on his gravestone. He was an active Masonic supporter.

Hall spent his later years at his plantation, known as Three Trees, in southwestern Brazoria County, Texas, and died there on April 8, 1867. He is buried in the Trinity Episcopal Cemetery at Galveston. Hall County, Texas, was named in his honor.

<text>Adam Green (born 12 January 1984) is an English semi-professional footballer who plays for Leatherhead as a defender.

==Career==
Green joined the academy at Fulham in August 1999, gradually working his way through the age groups before breaking into the reserve side in the 2002–03 season. In June 2003, Green signed his first professional contract with the club. Green made his debut for Fulham in September 2003, in a 1–0 defeat by Wigan Athletic in the Football League Cup. His home debut came in January 2004, impressing in a win over Cheltenham Town in the FA Cup. In June 2004, after making his breakthrough into the first team and winning the fans Young Player of the Season award, Green signed a new two-year contract. Green started the 2004–05 season as back-up to Carlos Bocanegra, but was soon given his chance with five appearances during September and October. In January 2005, he joined Football League One side Sheffield Wednesday on a one-month loan deal. Green made three appearances for the Owls, impressing on his debut against Milton Keynes Dons. In the subsequent two games, he featured in a left wing role. In March 2005, Green was on the move again, joined League One side AFC Bournemouth on a one-month loan, making his debut against Walsall. In total, he made three appearances for the Bournemouth before returning to Fulham in April. Green&#x27;s final appearance for Fulham came in September 2005, a 5–4 win over Lincoln City in the League Cup. In January 2006, he joined League One side Bristol City on loan until the end of the season. He struggled to make an impact at the club and only made two appearances during his loan spell. In May 2006, Green was released by Fulham due to the expiration of his contract.

In June 2006, Green dropped into the non-league game and signed for Conference National side Grays Athletic, as one of manager Frank Gray&#x27;s first signings. He made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 2006–07 season in a 1–1 draw with Stafford Rangers. He went on to make twenty appearances for Grays scoring twice, away at Tamworth and St Albans City. In January 2007, he was released from his contract. In the same month, Green joined fellow Conference National club Woking on a free transfer, making his debut against Altrincham in a 2–0 win. He spent a year and a half at the club and made 48 appearances, before joining fellow Conference Premier side Hayes &amp; Yeading United in the summer of 2009. He was almost an ever-present in his first season with the club making 45 appearances. In his second season with the club Green failed to nail down a regular place in the side, deciding to leave the club in May 2011 after feeling he needed a change.

In June 2011, he dropped into the semi-professional game with Conference South side Dartford, signing a one-year contract. He impressed in his first season with the club scoring seven times as the club gained promotion to the Conference Premier via the play-offs. In the summer of 2012, Green signed a new one-year contract with the club. In December 2012, he was sent out on loan to Isthmian League Premier Division side Kingstonian on a one-month deal, after failing to hold down a regular place in the first team. Green returned to Dartford in January 2013, having made four appearances. At the end of the season, he was offered a new contract by Dartford but opted to drop down a division to join Conference South side Basingstoke Town. He was a first team regular throughout his career with Basingstoke, making 46 appearances in his only season as the club finished in mid-table. In May 2014, he opted to rejoin recently relegated Conference South side Dartford on a free transfer. However, Dartford were granted a reprieve from relegation due to Salisbury City&#x27;s expulsion from the league and he made his debut in the opening day defeat by Wrexham at Princes Park. He started the season as first-choice left back for Dartford, but following the arrival of Tom Bender in September, Green lost his place in the side. In October 2014, he joined Isthmian League Premier Division side Leatherhead on a one-month loan deal, making his debut - and getting sent off - in a 2–0 win over Wingate &amp; Finchley. He stayed with the club on loan until January 2015, making ten appearances scoring once in a 3–1 win over Grays Athletic. In January 2015, his contract with Dartford was cancelled by mutual consent having made eleven appearances in his second spell for the club. Later in the month he rejoined Leatherhead on a permanent deal, signing a two-year contract.

<doc id="1055154" wikidata="Q957293" url="?curid=1055154" title="Mircea II of Wallachia">
<text>Mircea II (1428–1447) was the Voivode, or prince, of Wallachia in 1442. He was the oldest son of Vlad II Dracul and brother of Vlad Țepeș and Radu the Handsome. He was the grandson of his namesake Mircea cel Bătrân.

== Early life ==
Mircea was the eldest son of Vlad Dracul, the future voivode (or prince) of Wallachia. According to the Burgundian crusader, Walerand of Wavrin, Mircea was about 15 years old in 1443, suggesting that Mircea had been born around 1428. The first document to mention Mircea (and his younger brother, Vlad Dracula) was issued on 20 January 1437. In that charter, their father (who was already the ruler of Wallachia) referred to Mircea and Vlad as his &quot;first born sons&quot;. According to a widely accepted scholarly theory, &quot;Cneajna&quot; from Moldavia (a daughter of Alexander I of Moldavia) was Mircea&#x27;s mother.

== Reign ==
The Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, summoned Vlad Dracul to Edirne to do homage to him in March 1442. Before leaving Wallachia, Vlad Dracul appointed Mircea to rule Wallachia during his absence. The sultan accused Vlad Dracul of treachery and ordered his imprisonment. He also sent a force of 12,000 to invade Wallachia.

In 1436, Mircea II&#x27;s father Vlad Dracul succeeded in regaining the throne of Wallachia following the death of his half-brother Alexandru I Aldea. Mircea II ruled in his father&#x27;s absence beginning in 1442 when his father was away at the Ottoman court. His father&#x27;s allied stance with the Ottoman Empire made him an enemy of John Hunyadi. In 1443, Hunyadi launched an attack on Wallachia, defeating both the Ottoman forces and those loyal to Vlad Dracul, forcing the latter to negotiate with the Ottoman court for support, with Mircea II fleeing and going into hiding. However, Mircea II had a strong following and retained a strong army during this period. Hunyadi placed Basarab II on the throne, but with the support of the Ottomans, Vlad Dracul would regain the throne shortly thereafter. Mircea II supported his father but did not support his stance of siding with the Ottomans. Vlad Dracul signed a treaty with the Ottomans, which stated he would pay the usual annual tribute, as well as allowing two of his sons, Vlad Țepeș and Radu the Handsome (Fair), to be held as captives.

In October 1444, Vlad Dracul arrived near Nicopolis and tried to dissuade Vladislav III, king of Poland and Hungary, from continuing the Crusade of Varna. Polish historian Callimachus tells that the leaders of the crusade would not listen, so Vlad II went back to Wallachia, but not before he had left Mircea II in command of an auxiliary unit of 4,000 Wallachian cavalrymen. The unit participated in the Battle of Varna on 10 November 1444 and after the defeat, Mircea led the remainder of his unit and the Christian forces across the Danube. An able military commander, he successfully recaptured the fortress of Giurgiu in 1445. However, in yet another treaty with the Ottomans, his father allowed the Ottomans to again have control of the fortress in an effort to retain their support of his having the throne and in an effort to keep his two captive sons safe. In 1447, Hunyadi launched yet another attack against Wallachia, once more defeating the armies supporting Vlad Dracul and Mircea II, forcing Vlad Dracul to flee. Mircea II, however, was captured by Saxon elite, which were part of the ruling council in Târgoviște, and was blinded with a red-hot poker, then buried alive. His father was captured and killed shortly thereafter.

Following their deaths, his brother Vlad Țepeș was placed on the throne by the Ottomans but was soon forced out. Vlad Țepeș would regain the throne in 1456, and would also carry out vengeance against the Saxon elite, whom he held responsible for his father and brother&#x27;s deaths. Vlad Țepeș would also fight successfully against the Ottomans for a number of years. Vlad&#x27;s skilful political maneuverings, his capable administration skills and great tactical thinking, made him a very dangerous opponent to his enemies, which in turn would paint him as a ruthless, tyrannical leader.

==Popular culture==
* In Karen Chance&#x27;s Cassandra Palmer series and Dorina Basarab series, Mircea Basarab features as the love interest of the former and father of the latter. He is also the North American Vampire Senate&#x27;s chief negotiator. (Novels)
* In the comic strip &quot;Alley Oop&quot;, Mircea Ţepeş, a direct descendant of Mircea, appears in a series of strips published during 1981.
* In David Weber&#x27;s novel &quot;Out of the Dark&quot;, there is a Romanian soldier named Mircea Basarab, who eventually reveals himself to be Vlad Ţepeş, who chose to take his brother&#x27;s name after renouncing his vampiric nature.

<doc id="1055155" wikidata="Q14520484" url="?curid=1055155" title="Würm glaciation">
<text>The Würm glaciation or Würm stage ( or &quot;Würm-Glazial&quot;, colloquially often also &quot;Würmeiszeit&quot; or &quot;Würmzeit&quot;; cf. ice age), usually referred to in the literature as the Würm (often spelled &quot;Wurm&quot;), was the last glacial period in the Alpine region. It is the youngest of the major glaciations of the region that extended beyond the Alps themselves. Like most of the other ice ages of the Pleistocene epoch, it is named after a river, in this case the Würm in Bavaria, a tributary of the Amper.

The Würm ice age can be dated to about 115,000 to 11,700 years ago. Sources differ about the dates, depending on whether the long transition phases between the glacials and interglacials (warmer periods) are allocated to one or other of those periods. The average annual temperatures during the Würm ice age in the Alpine Foreland were below −3 °C (today +7 °C). That has been determined from changes in the vegetation (pollen analysis), as well as differences in the facies.

== Corresponding glaciations worldwide ==


The corresponding ice age in North and Central Europe is known as the Weichselian glaciation, after the German name for the Vistula river. Despite the global changes in climate that were responsible for the major glaciations cycles, the dating of the Alpine ice sheet advances does not correlate automatically with the farthest extent of the Scandinavian ice sheet. In North America the corresponding &quot;last ice age&quot; is called the Wisconsin glaciation.

== Temporal classification ==

In the Gelasian, i.e. at the beginning of the Quaternary period around 2.6 million years ago, an ice age began in the northern hemisphere which continues today. Characteristic of such ice ages is the glaciation of the polar caps. After the Gelasian followed the Early, Middle and Late Pleistocene with a succession of several warm and cold periods. The latter are often called &quot;ice ages&quot; or &quot;glacials&quot;, the former term often being confused with the overarching ice age period. The warm periods are called &quot;interglacials&quot;. 

Glaciers repeatedly advanced from the Alps to the northern molasse foreland and left moraines and meltwater deposits behind that are up to several hundred metres thick. Today, the Pleistocene epoch in the Alps is divided into several phases: the &quot;Biber&quot;, &quot;Danube&quot;, &quot;Günz&quot;, &quot;Haslach&quot;, &quot;Mindel&quot;, &quot;Riss&quot; and &quot;Würm&quot; glaciations. The greatest ice advance into the Alpine Foreland took place during the Riss glaciation, cf. the Saale glaciation in northern Europe. 

The most recent foreland glaciation, the Würm, did not have such an extensive and solid glacial front. Nevertheless, its terminal moraines, which indicate the perimeter of the ice sheet, extend as a single tongue well into the foreland. Whilst they were hemmed in by the high mountainsides of the Alps, once these rivers of ice entered the foreland they often combined to form huge glaciers.

The moraines and gravel beds formed in the Würm glaciation are the best preserved, because since then there have been no more similar geological processes. Traces of the ice sheet have not been scoured out by later glaciers or overlaid by their sediments. This allows a more precise dating for the Würm glaciation than for earlier ice ages.

The Würm glaciation was preceded by the Eemian, which began about 126,000 years ago and lasted 11,000 years. Then there was a significant slowdown, characterized by occasional fluctuations of several degrees in average temperatures. The various advances and retreats of glaciers associated with these temperature fluctuations, are called &quot;stadials&quot; (periods of relatively low temperatures) and &quot;interstadials&quot; (relatively higher temperatures).

The Würm Glacial ended around 11,700 years ago with the beginning of the Holocene. The cold period was followed by another warming which continues today and during which the glaciers are retreating. However, even in the Holocene there have been variations in temperature and ice advances, the last one in the modern era being the so-called Little Ice Age. The Holocene is considered an &quot;interglacial&quot; of a larger ice age, since the poles and the high mountain areas are still glaciated.

<text>Kikuyu or Gikuyu ( ) (also known as Gĩgĩkũyũ) is a Bantu language spoken by the Gĩkũyũ (&quot;Agĩkũyũ&quot;) of Kenya. Kikuyu is mainly spoken in the area between Nyeri, Nairobi and Nakuru. The Kikuyu people usually identify their lands by the surrounding mountain ranges in Central Kenya, including Mount Kenya, which they call &quot;Kĩrĩnyaga&quot;.

==Dialects==
Kikuyu has four main mutually intelligible dialects. The Central Province districts are divided along the traditional boundaries of these dialects, which are Kĩrĩnyaga, Mũrang&#x27;a, Nyeri and Kiambu.

The Kikuyu from Kĩrĩnyaga are composed of two main sub-dialects – the Ndia and Gichugu who speak the dialects &quot;Kĩndia&quot; and &quot;Gĩgĩcũgũ&quot;. The Gicugus and the Ndias do not have the &quot;ch&quot; or &quot;sh&quot; sound (same as in Mũrang&#x27;a) and will use the &quot;s&quot; sound instead (Kikuyu has no letter S), hence the pronunciation of &quot;Gĩcũgũ&quot; as opposed to &quot;Gĩchũgũ&quot;. To hear Ndia being spoken, one needs to be in Kerugoya, the largest town in Kirinyaga County. Other home towns for the Ndia, where &quot;purer&quot; forms of the dialect are spoken, are located in the tea-growing areas of Kagumo, Baricho, Kagio, and the Kangaita hills. Lower down the slopes is Kutus, which is a bustling town with so many influences from the other dialects that it is difficult to distinguish between them. The dialect is also prevalent in the rice growing area of Mwea.

The unmistakable tonal patterns of the Gichũgũ dialect (which sounds like Meru or Embu, sister languages to Kikuyu) can be heard in the coffee-growing areas of Kianyaga, Gĩthũre, Kathũngũri, Marigiti. The Gichugu switch easily to other Kikuyu dialects in conversation with the rest of the Kikuyu.

==Phonology==
Symbols shown in angle brackets replace the IPA symbols which are not in the orthography.

===Vowels===
===Consonants===
The prenasalised consonants are often pronounced without prenasalisation, and thus are often realised as .

===Tones===
Kikuyu has two level tones (high and low), a low-high rising tone, and downstep.

==Grammar==
The canonical word order of Gĩkũyũ is SVO (subject–verb–object). It uses prepositions rather than postpositions. Nouns are followed by possessive and demonstrative pronouns, which can coexist in that order, and subsequently adjectives, quantifiers, and numerals, which have no order among themselves.

===Noun classes===
Gĩkũyũ has 17 noun classes.

Class 1 (prefix mũ-) comprises animate/human nouns and is singular, while class 2 (prefix a-) comprises animate/human nouns but is plural. Kinship terms and some other words belong to these classes but take no prefixes.

Class 3 (prefix mũ-) comprises nature/landscape words and others that are not semantically related, and is singular. Class 4 (prefix mĩ-) comprises the same words, but is plural.

Class 5 (prefix rĩ- if stem is vowel initial, i- if consonant-initial) comprises plant/landscape words and others that don&#x27;t fix the pattern, and is singular. Class 6 (prefix ma-) comprises the same words, but is plural. Occasionally, class 6 nouns have the prefix marĩ-, perhaps because the class 5 form is reanalyzed as the stem. Nouns of classes 1, 9, 11, 12, 14, and 15 can be pluralized with the class 6 form.

Class 7 (prefix gĩ- if stem is t, k, c, or th initial, kĩ- otherwise) is an augmentative class with some inherent, not especially augmented members. Class 8 (prefix ci- if stem is vowel initial, i- if consonant initial) is the same, but plural. These classes&#x27; prefixes can be used to augment nouns of other classes.

Class 9 comprises most animals, most loanwords, a few body parts, and semantically unrelated others. Class 10 is the same, but plural. Because words of these classes begin with nasal or unnasalizable consonants, and lose their nasality when marked with a different class prefix, the proposed prefix is nasalization. This prefix cannot always be applied to loanwords.

Class 11 (prefix rũ-) comprises long, thin, or string-like nouns, as well as others that don&#x27;t fit the pattern. Its default plural is class 10, with occasional class 6 forms. It is hypothesized that if the prefix rũ- is added to a stem that already begins with rũ, the prefix is deleted. The class 6/11 plurals vary just as the Class 5/6 plurals do: the Class 6 prefix, ma-, attaches sometimes to the noun stem itself, and sometimes to the class 11 form.

Class 12 (prefix ga- if stem is t, k, c, or th initial, ka- otherwise) is a diminutive class with some inherent, not especially diminutive members. Class 13 (prefix tũ-) is the same, but plural. These classes&#x27; prefixes can be used to diminutize nouns of other classes.

Class 14 (null prefix) comprises abstract concepts and semantically unrelated others, and is pluralized by class 6.

Class 15 (prefix gũ- if stem is t, k, c, or th initial, kũ- otherwise) comprises &quot;only&quot; body parts and verbal infinitives—more semantically and syntactically motivated than other classes. It is pluralized, when possible, by class 6.

Class 16 (prefix ha-) is a definite locative class. Class 17 (prefix kũ-/gũ-) is an indefinite locative class. These classes can be singular or plural based on context.

===Adjectives and pronouns===
Adjectives agree with the noun via adjective class prefixes (usually identical to the noun class prefixes). Other modifiers do so via agreement class prefixes, which are often simply the vowel of the noun class prefix. 

Personal pronouns may take the place of a noun or a noun phrase. Since person and noun class are marked on verbs, they are usually only used emphatically or in response to questions. Except for those of classes 3 and 14, the pronouns are formed by adding agreement class prefixes to the stem o.

The dependent pronoun - &#x27;and/with X&#x27; - is formed by adding comitative preposition to the relevant personal pronouns.

The possessive pronoun is formed by adding the relevant possessive stem to the agreement class prefix of the possessed noun.

Relative pronouns are formed by adding the relevant agreement class prefix to the relative stem. 

Demonstrative pronouns come in distal, proximal, and anaphoric forms. Relative pronouns are written identically to distal demonstratives, but are distinguished by vowel length - the first syllable of a relative pronoun is short, while the first syllable of a distal demonstrative is long.

Adjectives are comparatively rare, and don&#x27;t cover even every color. Qualities are usually expressed instead as associative constructions, which connect two nouns or noun phrases where the first noun (head) is modified by the second. The associative is formed by prefixing the stem a with the agreement class prefix of the head noun. It can also denote possession, location, and ordinal numerals.

===Numbers===
Numerals 11-19 are formed with the construction &#x27;ten and X&#x27;. The final numeral, if it inflects, agrees with the noun being counted. However, if the final numeral is 1, it agrees with the singular class of the noun being counted, because 1 is singular, even if the overall number being formed is not.

===Verbs===
Verbs can be marked for focus, noun class agreement, negation, reflexivity, reciprocality, causativity, intensive meanings, reversive meanings, applicative (valency increasing) meanings, tense, and aspect. Tenses include past, present, or future; and remote, near, or current. Aspects include habitual/imperfective, completive, perfect, and progressive, which is unmarked. Sequential, a subtype of progressive, denotes events that occur in a sequence. There is also a marker for persistive events, which occur continuously until the time of speaking. Special subject agreement particles exist for 1st and 2nd person, the discourse participants, but subject agreement is otherwise based on noun class. A verb can exhibit noun class agreement for all arguments, but agrees less commonly with non-human nouns.

In addition to active and passive voices, there is a middle voice with an intermediate connotation.

==Alphabet==
Kikuyu is written in a Latin alphabet. It does not use the letters &quot;l f p q s v x z&quot;, and adds the letters &quot;ĩ&quot; and &quot;ũ&quot;. The Kikuyu alphabet is:
:a b c d e g h i ĩ j k m n o r t u ũ w y

Some sounds are represented by digraphs such as ng for the velar nasal .

==Sample phrases==
== Sample texts ==
==Literature==
There is notable literature written in the Kikuyu language. For instance, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o&#x27;s &quot;Mũrogi wa Kagogo&quot; (&quot;Wizard of the Crow&quot;) is the longest known book written in Kikuyu. Other authors writing in Kikuyu are Gatua wa Mbũgwa and Waithĩra wa Mbuthia. Mbuthia has published various works in different genres—essays, poetry, children stories and translations—in Kikuyu. The late Wahome Mutahi also sometimes wrote in Kikuyu. Also, Gakaara wa Wanjaũ wrote his popular book, Mau Mau Author in Detention, which won a Noma Award in 1984.

== In popular culture ==
In the 1983 movie &quot;Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi&quot;, the character Nien Nunb speaks in the Kikuyu language.

The 2023 song, &quot;Mwaki&quot;, by the Brazilian DJ, Zerb, features the Kenyan artist, Sofiya Nzau, singing in Kikuyu.

<text>Darren Antony Pratley (born 22 April 1985) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for and captains club Leyton Orient.

==Club career==
===Fulham===
Starting his career at Fulham after signing from local rivals Arsenal, Pratley signed his first professional contract with the club in 2002. He made his professional football debut in a League Cup match at Wigan Athletic on 23 September 2003, coming on as a substitute for Andrejs Stolcers, as Fulham went on to lose 1–0. Pratley made his league debut against Charlton Athletic on 8 November 2003, again as a substitute, this time for Barry Hayles, as the club went on to lose 3–1. These turned out to be the only two matches he would play for Fulham. At the end of the 2003–04 season, Pratley signed a two-year contract with the club, which will keep him until 2006.

====Brentford (loans)====
Having spent the latter parts of the 2004–05 season on loan at Brentford, on 30 August 2005 Pratley moved back to the Bees until January 2006 on a loan period that was subsequently extended until the end of the 2005–06 season.

===Swansea City===
On 8 June 2006, Pratley was sold by Fulham to Swansea City for a fee of £100,000. Upon joining the club, manager Kenny Jackett said: &quot;Darren&#x27;s a player I&#x27;ve admired for some time, so it&#x27;s pleasing to have finally got him. A year ago he was hoping to impress Fulham enough to figure in their first-team plans, but he now realises he has got to move on in order to progress his career. Recently, we&#x27;ve been trying to sign young, athletic players who we view as good investments and Darren falls into that category. A hundred thousand pounds is a lot of money, but I certainly feel he&#x27;s worth it.&quot;

On 7 November 2009, Pratley scored a brace against their arch-rivals Cardiff City. Pratley had not scored for 26 matches since the previous season&#x27;s corresponding fixture at the Liberty Stadium but he proved Swansea&#x27;s hero on the hour to seal the win. Pratley went on to score a further three times before the end of 2009, against Sheffield Wednesday (twice) and Reading. He started off the 2010–11 season well, however a string of poor performances saw him dropped by manager Brendan Rodgers. Pratley came back into the team performing well and getting vital goals against Reading, Crystal Palace a double against Bristol City and the third goal in the Championship play-off semi-final second leg against Nottingham Forest which he scored from the halfway-line into an empty goal. On 9 June 2011, it was confirmed that Pratley would leave Swansea City having rejected a new contract.

===Bolton Wanderers===
Pratley signed for Bolton Wanderers on 1 July 2011 on a four-year deal. He made his debut when coming on as a substitute for Nigel Reo-Coker in Bolton&#x27;s match at Queens Park Rangers on 13 August and scored his first goal for the club in their 2–1 victory over his former club Swansea City in the FA Cup on 28 January 2012. He scored his first Premier League goal in the match against Queens Park Rangers at the Reebok Stadium on 10 March in Bolton&#x27;s 2–1 win. On 3 August 2013, the first day of the 2013–14 season, Pratley scored the equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Burnley. He then also scored in a 1–1 draw with Reading a week later. On 1 July 2015, Pratley signed a new-three-year contract that will keep him at Bolton Wanderers until the summer of 2018.

A few weeks later Pratley was appointed as the new club captain of Bolton, replacing Matt Mills who had departed earlier that summer for Nottingham Forest. He played the first match of the 2016–17 season, picking up an injury that ruled him out for seven months. When he was due to return in January, a further setback ruled him out for the rest of the season. Pratley managed to return earlier than expected and started in Bolton&#x27;s 4–2 win over Fleetwood Town on 11 March. He was released by Bolton at the end of the 2017–18 season.

===Charlton Athletic===
On 17 July 2018, Pratley signed a two-year deal with Charlton Athletic. In the 2018–19 League One season, he played an important part in Charlton&#x27;s playoff promotion winning campaign, scoring a crucial late goal in the Playoff Semi-final against Doncaster Rovers. At the end of the 2020–21 season, Pratley was not offered a new contract. On 18 May 2021, it was announced that he would leave Charlton Athletic at the end of his contract.

===Leyton Orient===
On 9 June 2021, Pratley agreed to join League Two side Leyton Orient, signing a one-year deal with the club active from the end of his contract with Charlton. Having previously worked with manager Kenny Jackett at Swansea City, Pratley was appointed captain.

Pratley&#x27;s contract was extended in 2022 and on 13 May 2024, the club announced he had agreed another one-year deal.

==International career==
On 16 January 2009, Pratley was called up to the Jamaican squad by coach John Barnes to face Nigeria on 11 February 2009. Pratley qualifies for Jamaica through his grandparents but is yet to represent the Reggae Boyz after pulling out of the squad for the Nigeria friendly through injury after he broke his shoulder in a 4–1 win over Preston North End, although he did return earlier than expected from his injury.

<text>[[Malaria]] has had a significant impact on the history of the Caribbean, due to its effects on the colonization of the islands and the corresponding impact on society and economy.

Malaria was not found in the Americas prior to the discovery of the New World by Europeans. There was therefore even less immunity among the native populations than there was among Europeans. Due to their genetics, African slaves had greater immunity to falciparum malaria, and this was one reason why slaves were brought in great numbers from Africa. 

Creoles felt that diseases such as malaria were tools preventing their territories being invaded by Europeans.

The Caribbean countries most affected by malaria were the Greater Antilles islands and other humid islands like Martinique and Trinidad and Tobago. Anopheles mosquitoes thrive mostly in areas of humidity and fresh water, so the disease was not found on islands such as the Bahamas and Antigua.

As of 2019, several cases of malaria occur each year in Trinidad and Tobago.

<doc id="1055167" wikidata="Q1629619" url="?curid=1055167" title="Diamond Dogs">
<text>Diamond Dogs is the eighth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 24 May 1974 through RCA Records. Bowie produced the album and recorded it in early 1974 in London and the Netherlands, following the disbanding of his backing band the Spiders from Mars and the departure of the producer Ken Scott. Bowie played lead guitar on the record in the absence of Mick Ronson. &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; featured the return of Tony Visconti, who had not worked with Bowie for four years; the two would collaborate for the rest of the decade. Musically, it was Bowie&#x27;s final album in the glam rock genre, though some songs were influenced by funk and soul music, which Bowie embraced on his next album, &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975).

Conceived during a period of uncertainty over where his career was headed, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; is the result of multiple projects Bowie envisaged at the time: a scrapped musical based on &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; (1972); an adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949); and an urban apocalyptic scenario based on the writings of William S. Burroughs. The title track introduces a new persona named Halloween Jack. The Belgian artist Guy Peellaert painted the controversial cover artwork depicting Bowie as a half-man, half-dog hybrid, based on photos taken by the photographer Terry O&#x27;Neill.

Preceded by the lead single &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; was a commercial success, peaking at number one in the UK and number five in the US. It has received mixed reviews since its release, many criticising its lack of cohesion; Bowie&#x27;s biographers consider it one of his best works and, in 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it one of the greatest albums of all time. Bowie supported the album on the Diamond Dogs Tour, which featured elaborate and expensive set-pieces. Retrospectively, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; has been cited as an influence on the punk revolution in the years following its release. It has been reissued several times and was remastered in 2016 for the &quot;Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)&quot; box set.

David Bowie released his seventh studio album &quot;Pin Ups&quot; in the summer of 1973. At the time, he was unsure of where to take his career. Not wanting Ziggy Stardust to define him, he disbanded his backing band the Spiders from Mars and parted ways with producer Ken Scott. According to biographer David Buckley, Scott&#x27;s departure marked an end to Bowie&#x27;s &quot;classic &#x27;pop&#x27; period&quot; and brought him to more experimental territory and &quot;arguably greater musical daring&quot;.

During the &quot;Pin Ups&quot; sessions, he told reporters that he wanted to create a musical, using various titles such as &quot;Tragic Moments&quot; and &quot;Revenge, or The Best Haircut I Ever Had&quot;. His guitarist Mick Ronson recalled: &quot;[Bowie] had all these little projects... [and] wasn&#x27;t quite sure what he wanted to do.&quot; As Ronson began work on his solo album &quot;Slaughter on 10th Avenue&quot;, Bowie and his wife Angie moved out of Beckenham&#x27;s Haddon Hall because of harassment by fans. They moved initially into an apartment in Maida Vale, rented to them by the actress Diana Rigg, before moving into a larger house on Oakley Street, Chelsea. According to Buckley, David Bowie&#x27;s manager Tony Defries prevented this move initially, citing the house as &quot;too extravagant&quot;. Despite RCA Records estimating Bowie&#x27;s album and single sales in the UK at over two million copies combined, Defries said that sales did not provide Bowie with enough income to afford the house. In spite of Defries, Bowie bought the house and it was here the Bowies spent time with Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood of the Faces, Mick Jagger and his then-wife Bianca, and the American singer and model Ava Cherry, with whom Bowie had an affair during this time.

Along with recording &quot;Pin Ups&quot;, Bowie participated in other musical ventures in 1973. He co-produced and played on Lulu&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, which was released as a single in January 1974, contributed to Steeleye Span&#x27;s &quot;Now We Are Six&quot;, and formed a trio called the Astronettes, comprising Cherry, Jason Guess and Geoff MacCormack. The group recorded sessions at Olympic Studios in London but the project was ultimately shelved in January; a compilation album titled &quot;People from Bad Homes&quot; (later &quot;The Astronettes Sessions&quot;) was released in 1995. Bowie reworked songs from these sessions in subsequent years. Buckley writes that the songs he recorded featured a blend of glam rock and soul, which proved to be the direction Bowie took in 1974.

==Writing==

According to the biographer Chris O&#x27;Leary, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; is a combination of numerous projects Bowie envisioned at the time. In November 1973, Bowie conducted an interview with the writer William S. Burroughs for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Published in February 1974, the interview gave insight into Bowie&#x27;s current ambitions. An admirer of Burroughs&#x27;s working methods and his 1964 novel &quot;Nova Express&quot;, Bowie revealed he had begun using Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;cut-up&quot; technique as a way for inspiration. He spoke of a musical based on &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, saying: &quot;Forty scenes are in it and it would be nice if the characters and actors learned the scenes and we all shuffled them around in a hat the afternoon of the performance and just performed it as the scenes come out.&quot; He also casually mentioned adapting George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, a Bowie favourite, for television. He had wanted to create a theatrical production of the novel and began writing material after completing sessions for &quot;Pin Ups&quot;. Neither of these projects came to fruition.

The &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; musical fell through, but Bowie salvaged two songs for &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; he had written for it—&quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll with Me&quot;. At the end of 1973, George Orwell&#x27;s widow, Sonia Orwell, denied Bowie the rights to use the novel. The rejection annoyed Bowie, who lambasted her for it in &quot;Circus&quot; magazine a few years later. She refused to allow any adaptation of her late husband&#x27;s work for the rest of her life. No adaptations were possible until after her death in 1980. Unable to adapt the novel, Bowie decided to create his own apocalyptic scenario inspired by the works of Burroughs. Songs from this scenario included what would become the album&#x27;s title track and &quot;Future Legend&quot;.

==Recording==

Buckley writes that the album was the first time Bowie used a recording studio as an instrument. With Scott&#x27;s departure, Bowie produced the album himself. Keith Harwood, who had worked previously with the Rolling Stones, and on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;, handled engineering duties. Nicholas Pegg writes that despite Bowie and Harwood&#x27;s previous collaborations on Mott the Hoople&#x27;s &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; and the original version of &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot; (both 1972), &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; was Harwood&#x27;s first credit on a Bowie album. Bowie described being &quot;in awe&quot; of Harwood because of his work with the Stones. With the departure of the Spiders from Mars, Bowie handled lead guitar duties. He recalled in 1997 that he practised every day knowing &quot;the guitar playing had to be more than okay&quot;. This surprised &quot;NME&quot; critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, producing what they described as a &quot;scratchy, raucous, semi-amateurish sound that gave the album much of its characteristic flavour&quot;. 

The pianist Mike Garson and the drummer Aynsley Dunbar returned from the &quot;Pin Ups&quot; sessions, Tony Newman also played drums while Herbie Flowers, who had played previously on &quot;Space Oddity&quot; (1969), was recruited to play bass. Alan Parker of Blue Mink played guest guitar on &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;augmented&quot; Bowie&#x27;s riff on &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, although he was only credited for &quot;1984&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s longtime friend Geoff MacCormack, now known as Warren Peace, sang backing vocals. &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; reunited Bowie with Tony Visconti, who provided string arrangements and helped mix the album at his studio in London. Visconti would go on to co-produce much of Bowie&#x27;s work for the rest of the decade.

Before the &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; project was denied, Bowie worked on &quot;1984&quot;, recording it on 19 January 1973 during the sessions for &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;. Initial work on &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; began in late October 1973 at Trident Studios in London, where Bowie and Scott recorded &quot;1984&quot; in a medley with &quot;Dodo&quot;, titled &quot;1984/Dodo&quot;; once they had mixed the track, this session marked the final time the two worked together. According to O&#x27;Leary, this session was also the last time Bowie worked with Ronson and Bolder. The medley had already made its public debut on the American television show &quot;The 1980 Floor Show&quot; recorded in London on 18–20 October 1973. A cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Growin&#x27; Up&quot;, with Ronnie Wood on lead guitar, was also recorded during this time. Recording for the album at Olympic officially began at the start of 1974. Bowie had started to work on &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; during a solo session at Trident following Christmas 1973. On New Year&#x27;s Day, the group recorded &quot;Candidate&quot; and &quot;Take It In Right&quot;, an early version of &quot;Can You Hear Me&quot; from &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975). Following the final sessions with the Astronettes, recording continued from 14 to 15 January, with the group recording &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll with Me&quot;, &quot;Candidate&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Take It In Right&quot; and the title track. The following day, Bowie recorded &quot;We Are the Dead&quot;, after which he contacted Visconti for mixing advice. &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; was finished around this time. Recording was finished at Ludolph Studios in the Netherlands, where the Stones had just finished recording &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; (1974).

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; was Bowie&#x27;s last album in the glam rock genre. Buckley writes: &quot;In the sort of move which would come to define his career, Bowie jumped the glam-rock ship just in time, before it drifted into a blank parody of itself.&quot; The album has often been regarded as an &quot;English proto-punk&quot; record, according to the cultural studies academic Jon Stratton, who calls it &quot;post-glam&quot;. The pop culture scholar Shelton Waldrep describes it as &quot;wonderfully dark proto-punk&quot;, while the music journalist C. M. Crockford says it is &quot;the goofy, abrasive place where punk and art-rock meet, dance a little, and depart&quot;. In the opinion of &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Adam Sweeting, while &quot;the music still has one foot in the glam-rock camp&quot;, the album marks the point in Bowie&#x27;s career where he &quot;began exploring a kind of Weimar soul music with lavish theatrical packaging&quot;, featuring Broadway-style ballads such as &quot;Big Brother&quot; and &quot;Sweet Thing&quot;. Nicholas Pegg describes the album as having &quot;manic alternations between power-charged garage rock and sophisticated, synthesiser-heavy apocalyptic ballads&quot;. The biographer Christopher Sandford writes that beyond the overall concept, many of the songs delve into R&amp;B. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Barry Walters wrote that although the album is still primarily glam rock, it also contains elements of &quot;Blaxploitation funk and soul, rock opera, European art song, and Broadway.&quot;

===Side one===

The opening track, &quot;Future Legend&quot;, is a spoken word track that depicts a post-apocalyptic urban landscape. The writings of Burroughs, especially &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; (1971) inspire the visions of decay. The author Peter Doggett notes that unlike the opening of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, which announces the world will end in five years, the apocalypse of &quot;Future Legend&quot; could happen at any time. Bowie begins the title track by announcing, &quot;This ain&#x27;t rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll – this is &quot;genocide&quot;&quot;. The track introduces Bowie&#x27;s newest persona, Halloween Jack, described as &quot;a real cool cat&quot; who &quot;lives on top of Manhattan Chase&quot; in the urban wasteland depicted in &quot;Future Legend&quot;. He rules the &quot;diamond dogs&quot;, who O&#x27;Leary describes as &quot;packs of feral kids camped on high-rise roofs, tearing around on roller skates, terrorizing the corpse-strewn streets they live above&quot;. Although Jack is commonly identified as one of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;identities&quot; like Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, Doggett notes that Jack occupies &quot;little more than a cameo role&quot;. The riff and saxophone are inspired by the Rolling Stones. The biographer Marc Spitz notes that it is the same &quot;jaded commentator&#x27;s voice&quot; Bowie had used on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;.

Multiple biographers cite the suite of &quot;Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (Reprise)&quot; as the album&#x27;s highlight. Pegg describes Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance, which he believes to be one of his finest, as a croon. &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; paints pictures of decay, with sex being a &quot;drug-like commodity&quot; while &quot;Candidate&quot; contains references to Charles Manson and Muhammad Ali, with Bowie being &quot;consumed by the fakery of his own stage creations&quot;. &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, cited by Pegg as Bowie&#x27;s most covered track, is based around a distinctive guitar riff reminiscent of the Rolling Stones and was his farewell to the glam rock era. According to Pegg, Parker &quot;added the three descending notes at the end of each loop of the riff&quot;. The song features a character who predates 1970s punk rock and gender-bending lyrics (&quot;You got your mother in a whirl / She&#x27;s not sure if you&#x27;re a boy or a girl&quot;). Some commentators praised the song itself but felt it did not contribute to the overall theme of the album. Doggett, however, writes that the song acts as the &quot;musical continuation&quot; of the &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; suite.

===Side two===
Bowie and MacCormack co-wrote &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll with Me&quot;; it was Bowie&#x27;s first co-writing credit on one of his own albums. MacCormack said his contribution was minimal—he played the chord sequence on piano. A power ballad, the song explores the relationship between the audience and an actor. When asked whether fans considered him a leader, Bowie described &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll with Me&quot; as his response, saying: &quot;You&#x27;re doing it to me, stop it!&quot; Buckley writes the song foreshadowed the soul direction that Bowie would take on &quot;Young Americans&quot;. The lyrics of &quot;We Are the Dead&quot; reflect the characters of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, Winston and Julia&#x27;s, love for each other. They establish a world fraught with danger that mirrors the rest of the album. Buckley describes the lyrics as &quot;gothic&quot; and the music as &quot;creepy&quot;. Although it quotes &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; directly, O&#x27;Leary and James Perone argue the song owes more to the writings of Burroughs.

&quot;1984&quot; was the signature number for Bowie&#x27;s planned adaptation of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. It has been interpreted as representing Winston Smith&#x27;s imprisonment and interrogation by O&#x27;Brien. The lyrics also bear some similarities to Bowie&#x27;s earlier song &quot;All the Madmen&quot; (1970)—&quot;They&#x27;ll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Donald A. Guarisco wrote: &quot;Bowie&#x27;s recording of &quot;1984&quot; fully realizes the song&#x27;s cinematic potential with a dramatic arrangement that utilizes skittering strings and a throbbing wah-wah guitar line that effectively mirrors the song&#x27;s clipped, militaristic rhythms.&quot; Originally recorded during the &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; sessions, the rerecording&#x27;s wah-wah guitar is reminiscent of Isaac Hayes&#x27;s &quot;Theme from &quot;Shaft&quot;&quot;. Guarisco and Pegg felt the song&#x27;s funk and soul nature fully predicted the direction Bowie would take on &quot;Young Americans&quot;.

According to Pegg, the theme of &quot;Big Brother&quot; is &quot;the dangerous charisma of absolute power and the facility with which societies succumb to totalitarianism&#x27;s final solutions&quot;. It was a possible contender to close Bowie&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Featuring synthesisers and saxophones, the track builds to a climax that Buckley considers reminiscent of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;. The track segues into &quot;Chant of the Ever Circling Skeletal Family&quot;, a variation on &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; from &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. It is a chant in 5/4 and 6/4 time, with a distorted guitar loop. On the original LP, the word brother repeats in a &quot;stuck-needle effect&quot;, similar to the ending of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967).

==Artwork and packaging==

The cover artwork depicts Bowie as a striking half-man, half-dog grotesque. He sports his Ziggy Stardust haircut and two &quot;freak-show&quot; dogs surround him shown against a backdrop of New York City. The artwork originated from a photo session with the photographer Terry O&#x27;Neill. Bowie opted not to use any of his previous cover artwork photographers and instead requested the services of the Belgian artist Guy Peellaert, whose recently published &quot;Rock Dreams&quot; catalogue, featuring numerous airbrushed and exploited photographs, was growing in popularity. Bowie invited Peellaert to the photoshoot where he posed as a dog and with a Great Dane brought to the session. Bowie asked Peellaert if he would like to develop a painting for the artwork, based on a storyboard idea where he appeared as a half-man, half-dog, stylistically similar to Peelleart&#x27;s artwork for the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;. Peellaert agreed, basing the backdrop on a book he owned about Coney Island&#x27;s Pleasure Park. The two dogs behind Bowie were based on the Island&#x27;s Cavalcade Variety Show performers Alzoria Lewis (known as &quot;the Turtle Girl&quot;) and Johanna Dickens (known as &quot;the Bear Girl&quot;).

The artwork was controversial as the full image on the gatefold sleeve showed the hybrid&#x27;s genitalia. RCA had the genitalia airbrushed from the sleeve used for most releases. Some original uncensored copies made their way into circulation at the time of the album&#x27;s release. According to the record-collector publication &quot;Goldmine&quot; price guides, these albums have been among the most expensive record collectibles of all time, selling for thousands of US dollars for a single copy. Other changes to the artwork included the substitution of the freak show badge &quot;Alive&quot; with the word &quot;Bowie&quot;; Bowie was credited simply as &quot;Bowie&quot;, continuing the convention established with &quot;Pin Ups&quot;. Rykodisc/EMI restored Peelaert&#x27;s original uncensored artwork for the album&#x27;s re-release in 1990. Subsequent reissues have included a rejected inner gatefold image featuring Bowie in a sombrero cordobés holding onto a ravenous dog with a copy of Walter Ross&#x27;s novel &quot;The Immortal&quot; at his feet. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the cover the 51st best album cover of all time in 2024.

==Release and promotion==

In the UK, RCA released the lead single, &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, on 15 February 1974, backed by the &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; track &quot;Queen Bitch&quot;. The same day, Bowie recorded a lip synced performance of &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; at Hilversum&#x27;s Avro Studio 2 for the Dutch television programme &quot;Top Pop&quot;. Broadcast two days later, it featured Bowie donning what Pegg calls his short-lived &quot;pirate image&quot;—an eyepatch and a spotted neckerchief. Bowie changed this costume after the performance in favour of the &quot;swept-back parting and double-breasted suits&quot; of the Diamond Dogs Tour. For its US release, Bowie recorded a new mix in April 1974. Dubbed the &quot;Latin dub mix&quot; by Doggett, this mix was released in New York in May 1974, with &quot;Lady Grinning Soul&quot; as the B-side. The single was a commercial success, peaking at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart and number 64 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It further became a glam anthem, the female equivalent of Bowie&#x27;s earlier hit for Mott the Hoople, &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;.

RCA issued &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; on 24 May 1974 with the catalogue number APLI 0576. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. A $400,000 advertising campaign featuring billboards in Times Square and Sunset Boulevard, magazine ads, subway posters declaring &quot;The Year of the Diamond Dogs&quot; and a television commercial, one of the first of its kind for a pop album according to Pegg, boosted its sales in the US. In Canada, it repeated its British chart-topping success, hitting number one on the &quot;RPM 100&quot; national albums chart in July 1974, remaining there for two weeks. RCA released the second single, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;, on 14 June 1974, with a rerecorded version of Bowie&#x27;s 1971 single &quot;Holy Holy&quot; as the B-side. It was Bowie&#x27;s least-successful single in two years, peaking at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart and failing to chart in the US. In July, &quot;1984&quot; was released as the third single in the US and Japan, but failed to chart. Reviewing the single the following month, &quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;1984&quot; as Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most commercial cut ... in a long time&quot;.

===Tour===
Bowie supported the album on the Diamond Dogs Tour, whose first leg lasted from 14 June to 20 July 1974. Co-designed and constructed by Chris Langhart, it featured elaborate set-pieces and cost $250,000. Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) and Robert Wiene&#x27;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920) influenced the tour&#x27;s design, primarily due to Bowie&#x27;s interest in German expressionism. The tour&#x27;s second leg, from 2 September to 1 December 1974, has been nicknamed the Soul Tour, because of the influence of the soul music Bowie had begun recording for &quot;Young Americans&quot; in August. The shows were altered heavily, and no longer featured elaborate set-pieces, partly because Bowie had tired of the design and wanted to explore the new sound he was creating. Bowie dropped songs from the previous leg, while he added new ones—some from &quot;Young Americans&quot;.

In early September, director Alan Yentob filmed a documentary that depicts Bowie on the tour in Los Angeles, using a mixture of sequences filmed in limousines, hotels and concert footage, most of which was taken from a show there at Universal Amphitheatre on 2 September. Broadcast on BBC1 in the UK on 26 January 1975, &quot;Cracked Actor&quot; is notable as a primary source of footage of the Diamond Dogs Tour, and for showing Bowie&#x27;s declining mental state during this period because of his growing cocaine addiction. After seeing an advanced screening of the film, the director Nicolas Roeg immediately contacted Bowie to discuss a role in &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; (1976).

Bowie played all of the album&#x27;s songs except &quot;We Are the Dead&quot; on the tour, performances of which have been released on three live albums: &quot;David Live&quot; (1974), &quot;Cracked Actor&quot; (2017) and &quot;I&#x27;m Only Dancing (The Soul Tour 74)&quot; (2020). &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; featured on almost every later Bowie tour, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; was performed for the Isolar, Outside and A Reality Tours, and &quot;Big Brother/Chant of the Ever Circling Skeletal Family&quot; was resurrected in 1987 for the Glass Spider Tour, which itself was heavily influenced by the Diamond Dogs tour. The Diamond Dogs Tour has had a lasting legacy. Sandford says the tour turned Bowie from a &quot;novelty act&quot; into a &quot;superstar&quot;. Spitz writes it was highly influential on future tours with large and elaborate set pieces, including Parliament-Funkadelic&#x27;s Mothership Connection tour, Elvis Presley&#x27;s Vegas period, the 1990s tours of U2 and Madonna, and &#x27;N Sync, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and Kanye West&#x27;s 2008 Glow in the Dark Tour.

==Critical reception==
The album received mixed reviews from music critics on release. &quot;Disc&quot; magazine compared the album to &quot;the greatly underrated&quot; &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, believing it to contain some of Bowie&#x27;s best-written songs and &quot;without doubt the finest [LP] he&#x27;s made so far&quot;, while &quot;Rock Magazine&quot; found it &quot;a strong and effective album, and certainly the most impressive work Bowie&#x27;s completed since &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;&quot;. Martin Kirkup of &quot;Sounds&quot; wrote, &quot;where &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; seemed like a series of Instamatic snapshots taken from weird angles, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; has the provoking quality of a thought-out painting that draws on all the deeper colors&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; saw a &quot;subtler, more aesthetic Bowie&quot; than his previous records on an album &quot;which should reinforce his musical presence in the 70&#x27;s&quot;. Peter Harvey of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; was disappointed regarding the absence of the Spiders and wished the lyrical themes were more upbeat, but predicted the record would make a good stage production.

&quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Chris Charlesworth called the album &quot;really good&quot; and compared it to Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound method of production and noting the similar level of excitement and praise Bowie&#x27;s albums were beginning to receive as the Beatles did in the 60s. Robert Christgau was more critical in &quot;Creem&quot;, suggesting that Bowie performs a pale imitation of Bryan Ferry&#x27;s &quot;theatrical vocalism&quot;. He also dismissed the lyrical content as &quot;escapist pessimism concocted from a pleasure dome: eat, snort and bugger little girls, for tomorrow we shall be peoploids – but tonight how about $6.98 for this piece of plastic? Say nay.&quot; Ken Emerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album an extremely negative review, calling it, &quot;Bowie&#x27;s worst album in six years&quot;. He criticised Bowie&#x27;s choice of direction, the absence of Ronson, describing Bowie&#x27;s guitar playing as &quot;cheesy&quot; adding &quot;the music exerts so little appeal that it&#x27;s hard to care what it&#x27;s about&quot;. Despite the album&#x27;s mixed reception, John Rockwell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found it inoffensive and &quot;surrealisticnihilistic&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==
&quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;″ raw guitar style and visions of urban chaos, scavenging children and nihilistic lovers (&quot;We&#x27;ll buy some drugs and watch a band / Then jump in a river holding hands&quot;) have been credited with anticipating the punk revolution that would take place in the following years. According to the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Mark Kemp, the album&#x27;s &quot;resigned nihilism inspired interesting gloom and doom from later goth and industrial acts such as Bauhaus and Nine Inch Nails&quot;. O&#x27;Leary writes that Bowie&#x27;s appearance in the promotional video for &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; provided inspiration on future punks&#x27; styles and attitudes. He continues that initial British punks were former fans of Bowie and Roxy Music, and &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; stands as both Bowie&#x27;s goodbye and tribute to them. Crockford further acknowledges the album&#x27;s influence on punk, stating: &quot;Bowie&#x27;s violent, amateruishly scraping guitar playing here would be echoed in the late-70&#x27;s post-punk bands and Diamond Dogs&#x27; concept of street gangs roaming London was echoed in the gleeful nihilism of the Sex Pistols.&quot; Considering Bowie&#x27;s direction afterwards through the punk and disco eras, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Derek Miller says, &quot;&quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; should be remembered not only as one of glam’s last great full-lengths but more importantly as a gap-record that somehow manages to cohesively storyboard Bowie&#x27;s crude conceptual surrealism while also expanding his sound.&quot;

===Retrospective appraisal===

Retrospective appraisals have been mixed. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that, because Bowie did not completely retire the character of Ziggy Stardust, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; suffers from him being unsure how to move forward. Although he praised &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, he further criticised the exclusion of Ronson and ultimately concluded &quot;it is the first record since &quot;Space Oddity&quot; where Bowie&#x27;s reach exceeds his grasp&quot;. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the album a mixed review, calling it &quot;an overproduced concept album inspired by Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot;&quot;. Eduardo Rivadavia was also mixed in &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, questioning the presence of Ziggy, whom Bowie supposedly retired the year before. Despite the album&#x27;s commercial success, Rivadavia concluded: &quot;with decades of hindsight, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; now seems more like the gateway from the &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; era to his Thin White Duke blue-eyed soul period, and beyond&quot;.

The record has attracted positive reviews. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Barry Walters described the album as &quot;a bummer, a bad trip, &#x27;No Fun&#x27; – a sustained work of decadence and dread that transforms corrosion into celebration&quot;. He also believed it foreshadowed Bowie&#x27;s Thin White Duke persona. For punknews.org, C. M. Crockford wrote that &quot;Diamonds Dogs&quot; is Bowie&#x27;s &quot;utterly most distinctive work: melodramatic, raw, challenging, and ambitious even when crammed with catchy songs&quot;. Crockford ultimately called it one of Bowie&#x27;s essential releases and argued that he would &quot;never make an album that was so obviously his own again&quot;. In a 2013 readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; was voted Bowie&#x27;s fifth-greatest album.

In subsequent decades, Bowie biographers have described &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; as one of Bowie&#x27;s greatest works. Cann writes: &quot;&quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; is arguably [Bowie&#x27;s] most significant album, a pivotal work and the most &#x27;solo&#x27; album he has ever made.&quot; Although Spitz calls it &quot;no fun&quot;, he states it was Bowie&#x27;s &quot;best-sounding, most complex record to date, and it still pulls you into its romantic and doomed world three and a half decades on&quot;. Trynka calls it &quot;a beautiful mess&quot;, while Buckley says the album proved that Bowie could still produce work of &quot;real quality&quot; without Scott or the Spiders. Doggett writes it anticipated the &quot;sonic audacity&quot; of &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot;, while it simultaneously &quot;capsized the vessel of classic rock&quot;. Perone argues that &quot;Chant of the Ever Circling Skeletal Family&quot; predated Talking Heads&#x27; exploration of African rhythms and experimentation in the late 1970s. Pegg writes that with tracks like &quot;We Are the Dead&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&quot; and the &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; suite, the album contains &quot;some of the most sublime and remarkable sounds in the annals of rock music&quot;. He further states that Bowie&#x27;s new voice on the record, a &quot;basso profundo&quot;, particularly evident on &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; and &quot;Big Brother&quot;, was a major influence on gothic rock bands in the 1980s. It ranked number 447 in &quot;NME&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and number 14 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 74 Best Albums of 1974.

===Reissues===

&quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; has been reissued several times. Although the original 1974 vinyl releases featured a gatefold cover, some later LP versions such as RCA&#x27;s 1980 US reissue presented the album in a standard non-gatefold sleeve. The album was first released on CD in the mid-1980s by RCA, with censored cover art. The German (for the European market) and Japanese (for the US market) masters, sourced from different tapes, are not identical. Dr. Toby Mountain at Northeastern Digital, in Southborough, Massachusetts, remastered &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; from the original master tapes for Rykodisc in 1990, released with two bonus tracks and the original, uncensored, artwork. It was again remastered in 1999 by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios for EMI and Virgin Records, and once more released with no bonus tracks.

In 2004, a 2-disc version was released by EMI/Virgin. The third in a series of &quot;30th Anniversary 2CD Editions&quot; (along with &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;), this release included a remastered version of the album on the first disc. The second disc contains eight tracks, five of which had been released previously with the &quot;Sound + Vision&quot; box set in 1989 or as bonus tracks on the 1990–92 Rykodisc/EMI reissues. In 2016, the album was remastered for the &quot;Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)&quot; box set. It was released on CD and vinyl, and in digital formats, both as part of this compilation and separately.

Later, in 1907, a group of people from the area, wanting a post office, made an application for one. As a name had to be given to the post office, the group dedicated it to the town&#x27;s most senior settlers, the Roses. As the name &quot;Rose&quot; was already taken, the group added &quot;town&quot; to it to create &quot;Rosetown&quot;. The post office opened on September 7, 1907.

A Jewish colony was established near Rosetown after 1906.

Rosetown became a village on August 29, 1909, after Wilrod Bifair sold his homestead for $12 an acre to the Canadian Northern Railway.

<doc id="1055174" wikidata="Q246651" url="?curid=1055174" title="Ian Pearce (footballer)">
<text>Ian Anthony Pearce (born 7 May 1974) is an English football coach and former professional footballer who is the head of recruitment at West Bromwich Albion.

As a player he was defender from 1990 until 2012, notably in the Premier League for Blackburn Rovers where he won the title in 1995. He also played top flight football for Chelsea, West Ham United and Fulham. He played in the Football League for Southampton and Lincoln City, as well as for non-league sides Oxted &amp; District, Kingstonian and Lingfield. He was capped three times by the England U21 team in 1995.

Since retiring he has since worked on the coaching staff at Lincoln City and worked as a scout for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion before taking up his current role with West Brom.

==Club career==
===Chelsea===
Pearce started his career at Oxted &amp; District FC before signing for Chelsea during the 1991–92 season. He made his debut on 11 May 1991 in a 2–2 draw with Aston Villa. He made five substitute appearances in three seasons for the west London club, before moving to Blackburn Rovers in October 1993 for a fee of £300,000.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Pearce&#x27;s Blackburn debut was in a League Cup third-round replay against Shrewsbury Town on 9 Nov 1993, in which Pearce scored the winning goal in extra time. He scored his first League goal in April 1994 after coming on as a substitute in a 2–1 win at West Ham United, a result which guaranteed Rovers a place in Europe for the first time in their history. He moved to centre-half the following season, forming a formidable partnership with Colin Hendry, and won a Premier League medal in the 1994–95 season.

===West Ham United===
Pearce moved to West Ham United for £2.3 million on 9 October 1997. After playing regularly in his first two seasons with the club, and being named as runner-up in the 1999 Hammer of the Year award, he played just 37 minutes in 1999–2000 after injuring knee ligaments in a clash with teammate Stuart Pearce. Pearce was out for 14 months, returning on 28 October 2000 against Newcastle United. He failed to find his true fitness, and only made 17 appearances in the 2000–01 season. He was able to take part in pre-season training for the first time in five years in 2002–03, and despite some further niggling injuries, made 33 appearances in all competitions. He continued his form into the 2003–04, registering 26 starts in the First Division, before moving to Fulham in the January transfer window.

===Fulham===
Pearce signed for Fulham in January 2004 in a deal which involved an undisclosed transfer fee and Andy Melville moving to West Ham. He started nine games of that season as Fulham&#x27;s first choice centre back. He made his debut in a match against Tottenham Hotspur at Loftus Road on 31 January 2004.

However, in his 2004–05 season, he was hampered with a back injury sustained in December 2004. He did manage to play a few reserve games at the end of the season, but did not play for the first team. In August 2005, he was close to signing for Norwich City, but pulled out because of family reasons.

Pearce was praised as &#x27;Best player in pre season&#x27; by then Fulham manager Chris Coleman. His admirable resolve was demonstrated when in a 1–1 draw against Portsmouth he played through a painful foot injury only to score an equaliser before time and secure a critical point for Fulham.

On 22 February 2008, he joined Southampton on a 30-day loan deal. Injury restricted him to one appearance, in a 1–1 draw against Scunthorpe United.

Pearce had a trial for Brentford and played against Staines Town in a 3–0 win.

===Later career===
Pearce joined Surrey South Eastern Combination side Oxted &amp; District, the club where his career began, in September 2008 and scored on his debut. Pearce signed for Kingstonian of the Isthmian League Premier Division on 21 August 2009 as an attacking midfielder and forward and made his competitive debut for the club against Aveley. He left the club on 27 September.

On 9 October 2009, in addition to his contract as assistant manager, Pearce signed a playing contract with Lincoln City. On 17 October, Pearce made his playing debut for Lincoln, coming on as a substitute in their 1–0 away defeat to Northampton Town. He was sent off as an unused substitute in a match against Cheltenham Town on 14 November 2009. He returned for Kingstonian on 19 March 2011, in the 2–0 win over Lowestoft Town. He also played for Lingfield in 2011, where he linked up with fellow ex-pro Nicky Forster.

==International career==
Pearce was part of the England under-20 team that came third in the 1993 FIFA World Youth Championship, playing in all six matches and scoring one goal. He was capped three times for England at under-21 level in the mid-1990s, but never made the senior national side.

==Coaching career==
On 30 September 2009, Pearce signed for Lincoln City as the club&#x27;s assistant manager to newly appointed Chris Sutton, a former teammate at Blackburn Rovers. He left when Sutton resigned on 29 September 2010.

In 2014, he joined Brighton &amp; Hove Albion as a scout. On 1 November 2018, he joined West Bromwich Albion as head of recruitment.

<text>Mariusz Krzysztof Czerkawski (pronounced ; born 13 April 1972) is a Polish former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Boston Bruins, Edmonton Oilers, New York Islanders, Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs. In addition to playing in the NHL, Czerkawski played for several different European-based teams. A consistent scorer, Czerkawski was the first player born and trained in Poland to play in the NHL. Internationally, Czerkawski represented Poland at several international tournaments, including the 1992 Winter Olympics and the 1992 and 2002 World Championships.

==Playing career==
Czerkawski first played hockey when he was 8-years-old, and from a young age was part of the GKS Tychy program. After a strong season with GKS Tychy in 1990–91, where he scored 40 points in 24 games, the Boston Bruins drafted him in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft in the fifth round, 105th overall. Czerkawski joined Djurgårdens IF of the Elitserien for the 1991–92 season. He was the first foreign player to play for Djurgårdens since Canadian Steve Cardwell in 1976–77. Czerkawski did not play often during his first season, and finished with 13 points in 39 games. Loaned to Hammarby of the second-tier Division 1 for 1992–93, Czerkawski greatly improved, and was brought back to Djurgårdens for 1993–94, recording 34 points in 39 games.

After the season ended Czerkawski went to North America, making his National Hockey League (NHL) debut at the end of the 1993–94 NHL season with the Bruins, playing his first game on April 9 against the Tampa Bay Lightning. He scored his first goal on April 13, his third game, against the Ottawa Senators, and finished the season with two goals and one assist in four games. Though previous NHL players had been born in Poland, Czerkawski was the first Polish-trained NHLer. The next season, he played 47 games with the Bruins, collecting 12 goals and 14 assists in a lockout-shortened season.

In 1996, Czerkawski was traded to the Edmonton Oilers. He played season and a half there before another trade sent him to the New York Islanders, where he would have his most productive years, including two 30-goal plus seasons and being named to the 2000 NHL All-Star Game. However, after being traded to the Montreal Canadiens in 2002, he found himself sent to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs. His contract was then bought-out by Montreal, after which he signed a one-year contract with the Islanders in 2003, recording another 25-goal season.

The 2004–05 NHL lockout saw the NHL not play in 2004–05, so Czerkawski joined Djurgårdens for the season, where he had 24 points in 46 games. Returning to the NHL, he signed as a free agent with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He played 19 games for the Maple Leafs, scoring 5 points, before being put on waivers and being claimed by the Boston Bruins on 7 March 2006. He played 16 games with the Bruins, scoring four goals and one assist.

Czerkawski joined the Rapperswil-Jona Lakers of the Swiss National League A (NLA) in 2006. He played two seasons for the club, collecting respectively 41 and 53 points. He retired in 2008, though returned to play one final match for Tychy in January 2009.

==International play==
Czerkawski&#x27;s first international tournament with the Polish national under-18 team was at the 1989 European U18 Division B Championship, where he recorded 11 points in 5 games and helped Poland earn promotion to the top level for 1990. Joining the team at the 1990 tournament, he had 12 points in 6 games. He also played for Poland at the 1990 World Junior Championship, scoring one goal in seven games. Poland was relegated to Pool B (the second tier) for 1991, where Czerkawski had 12 goals and 3 assists, for 15 points, in 7 games. He also made his debut for the Polish senior team that year, playing in Pool B at the 1991 World Championships and scoring 8 points in 7 games and helping Poland earn promotion to the top tier for the following year.

At the 1992 Winter Olympics Czerkawski played five games, and had one assist. He played a further 6 games at the 1992 World Championships, but did not score any points. It would not be until 1998 that Czerkawski again played internationally, joining Poland at the renamed Group B of the World Championships, where he had 3 points in 3 games. He would return again in 2000 and had 11 points in 7 games. Poland had earned promotion to the 2002 World Championship and Czerkawski scored 4 points in 3 games, though Poland was relegated back to the second tier (then known as Division I). His final tournament would be at the 2006 World Championship Division I, where he had 7 points in 5 games.

==Personal life==
Czerkawski was married from 1996 to 1998 to Polish actress Izabella Scorupco, and they have a daughter. Since 1 September 2007, he has been married to Emilia Raszyńska, with whom he has a son. After retiring from ice hockey, he took up golf.

For his contribution to the development of Polish ice hockey, Czerkawski received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (5th Class) in 2004.

<text>William James Alexander McKinlay (born 22 April 1969) is a Scottish football manager and former professional footballer who is currently assistant manager of Everton.

As a player, he was a midfielder who notably played in the Premier League for Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City, Bradford City and Fulham. He also played in the Scottish Premiership for Dundee United, the Football League for Preston North End and the Scottish Football League for Clydebank. McKinlay appeared 29 times for Scotland and played at Euro 1996 and the 1998 World Cup.

As a coach, he has worked for Fulham, the Northern Ireland national team and Watford. He was appointed Watford head coach in September 2014 but left the post after eight days. After a spell as assistant head coach with Real Sociedad in Spain, he joined Norwegian club Stabæk in November 2015, before being sacked in July 2016. He has since worked at Sunderland, Stoke City and West Ham United.

In January 2025, McKinlay joined Everton as assistant head coach, working alongside head coach David Moyes.

==Club career==
A product of Dundee United&#x27;s scouting and coaching network in the west of Scotland, Glasgow-born McKinlay was signed from Hamilton Thistle in 1986. He played in the 1988 Scottish Cup final side at the age of 19, after only twelve Scottish Football League appearances. He went on to play over two hundred matches for United, but missed out on the club&#x27;s 1994 Scottish Cup win due to suspension. He was named in the SPFA Team of the Year for 1994.

Following Dundee United&#x27;s relegation in 1995, McKinlay requested a transfer. He was sold to English Premier League champions Blackburn Rovers in October 1995 for a fee of £1.75 million. After leaving Blackburn in 2000, McKinlay had brief spells with Bradford City, Preston North End and Clydebank. In 2002, he joined Leicester City, scoring his only goal for them against Coventry City. In 2004, Fulham manager Chris Coleman signed McKinlay, primarily to assist the reserve squad.

==International career==
McKinlay represented Scotland at under-21 and B international level before making his full debut in 1993. He made 14 appearances for Scotland while with Dundee United, the last two as a First Division player. He is one of only three players from that division to play at full international level for Scotland since 1975. In total he played 29 times for Scotland between 1993 and 1998, scoring four goals.

<text>Digne-les-Bains (; Occitan: &quot;Dinha dei Banhs&quot;), or simply and historically Digne (&quot;Dinha&quot; in the classical norm or &quot;Digno&quot; in the Mistralian norm), is the prefecture of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region of Southeastern France. As of 2018, the commune had a population of 16,333. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Dignois&quot; (masculine) and &quot;Dignoises&quot; (feminine).

==Geography==
===Site and location===
Located on the edge of the Digne Prealps and on both sides of the river Bléone, which flows southwest through the middle of the commune and crosses the town; it forms part of the commune&#x27;s northeastern and southwestern borders.

Digne-les-Bains is the capital of the Department of Alpes de Haute-Provence. Placed in the geographical centre of the Department, the commune is home to 17,400 inhabitants, making it one of the smaller prefectures of France by its population. The town centre is at altitude.

Digne is a sprawling commune in the plain formed around the Bléone Valley, given that the terrain that surrounds it is very rugged. The old town is built on a hill between the Bléone and the torrent of the hot springs, but the town has gradually extended in the three directions of the valleys, especially downstream. Its geographical location is quite remarkable, given that it lies at the edge of the Prealps, on a thrust fault that bears its name. A part of the town is completely enclosed in the Bléone Valley, while the town extends widely, on a gentler relief, downstream. With the annexation of neighbouring towns, especially downstream, the town extends over in length.

===Neighbouring communes===
The communes surrounding Digne-les-Bains are La Robine-sur-Galabre, Le Brusquet, Marcoux, Archail, Tartonne, Clumanc, Chaudon-Norante, Châteauredon, Le Chaffaut-Saint-Jurson, Aiglun, Champtercier and Thoard.

===Climate===
Digne-les-Bains features a mid-latitude humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;), with mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;) and oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;) influences. Summers are hot and relatively dry, and winters are mildly cold and relatively wet, with air frosts being regular in the winter months.

===Geology and terrain===
The commune, which is at the heart of the geology, has its specificities related to the ancient town built upstream of the cluse which the Bléone has worn into the &quot;Nappe de Digne&quot; to emerge into the tertiary basin of Valensole.

The districts of the town cover the alluvium of the streams which converge upstream of the Cluse. The most eastern suburbs joined a line of limestone hills with flint of the Carixian age, forming russet cliffs oriented to the south-west. The hot springs were captured, since ancient times, to the point where these carixian limestones are cut by the hack of the southernmost valley, descending from Entrages. Their healing powers are linked to their ascent along the gypsiferous Triassic levels of the sole thrust of the &quot;Nappe de Digne&quot;.

The most visible mountain of the commune is Le Cousson at ; the Bigué rises to .

Many reliefs lie around Digne and are objectives for hikers.

*The Rocher de Neuf Heures [Rock of Nine o&#x27;clock]
*Three chapels (the Chapel of our Lady of Lourdes, the Chapel of Saint-Vincent, and the Chapel La Croix)
*The right bank of the Bléone (Park of the Haute-Provence Geological Reserve, along the Caguerenard path, paths to access the top of the slope (over above the town) and the crest of Andran - Martignon - La Bigue.
*Trails to access the Basses Bâties de Cousson, and then Le Cousson
*The Chapel of Saint Pancrace
*Barre des Dourbes

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of its &#x27;world famous and outstanding accumulation of fossils from a lower Jurassic marine environment&#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the &#x27;Ammonite Slab of Digne-les-Bains&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

===Hydrography===
In the Eaux-Chaudes Valley, there is one cold and eight hot springs used for hydrotherapy. Some are radioactive, and contain sulfides, chlorobromides, and arsenic.

The town is also crossed by the Bléone and the Mardaric rivers.

===Channels of communication and transport===

====Road network====
====Railway network====

The town is served by Chemins de fer de Provence via the Nice–Digne line, a narrow gauge line which operates daily. It is the &quot;Train des Pignes&quot;, which allows the railway to serve little inhabited places with many stations.

====Public transport====
Bus - Since 1992, Digne has the TUD (Urban Transport Digne), which manages the public transport. Initially with six buses, this service increased its vehicle fleet in 1998 with the acquisition of two buses powered by natural gas.

Currently, six bus routes are available to the people of Digne.

===Natural and technological risks===
None of the 200 communes of the Department is in the zero seismic risk zone. Digne townships are located in zone 1b (low seismicity) of the 1991 deterministic classification, based on the historic earthquakes, and in zone 4 (medium risk) according to the EC8 probabilistic classification 2011. The town of Digne is also exposed to three other natural risks:

*Forest fire
*Flooding (in the Bléone Valley) and in those of its tributaries;
*Land movement: all the western part of the municipality is covered by a medium to strong hazard.

The town of Digne is also exposed to a risk of technological origin, that of transport of dangerous goods, by rail, road and pipeline. With regard to the railway, the is disused and has no traffic; the line from is used by passenger transport. and the RD 900 (former ) can be used for the road transport of dangerous goods. Finally, the pipeline to supply natural gas is an additional risk factor to Digne.

The foreseeable natural (PPR) of the town was approved in 2008 for the risks of flooding, movement of land and earthquakes and the has existed since 2009.

The commune has been the subject of several orders of natural disaster: in 1984 for an earthquake, and many times for floods, landslides and mudslides, and landslides due to drought. Also included is a flood disaster prior to the orders: The waters of the Mardaric and Eaux-Chaudes which flooded the town in 1928, and the Bléone in 1973 which partially destroyed the bridge. This destruction was caused by the breakdown of a jam created in the bed of the , causing a wave of flooding. Similarly, several massive landslides have happened in the history of the commune, for example on 24 December 1916, which caused the collapse of part of Courbons, and 2002–2003 at Villard-des-Dourbes. Earthquakes have a long history in Digne. Retaining those macro-seismic events felt higher than level V on the MSK scale (sleepers awake, falling objects), we obtain the following list (the specified intensities are those felt in the town, the intensity may be stronger at epicentre):

*The earthquake of 31 August 1684, an intensity felt Digne of V.5 and whose epicentre was located at Digne
*The earthquake of 2 December 1872, an intensity felt V and whose epicentre was located at Digne
*The earthquake of 20 September 1876, an intensity felt V.5 and whose epicentre was located at Digne
*The earthquake of 23 February 1887, an intensity felt VII and whose epicentre was located in Bussana Vecchia (Liguria)
*The earthquake of 27 September 1911, an intensity felt V and whose epicentre was located at Barrême
*The earthquake of 16 February 1915, an intensity felt V and a half and whose epicentre was located at Digne
*The earthquake of 19 June 1984, of an intensity felt V and whose epicentre was located in Aiglum

==Toponymy==
The toponym &quot;Dinia&quot; is known from the 1st century AD (Ptolemy, Pliny the elder). Various hypotheses have been advanced. According to Papon, the name is formed by the hydronym &quot;Din&quot; (Gaulish water), with the suffix &quot;-ia&quot;. According to other scholars, the name is derived from a Roman proper noun, Din(n)ius.

The current name of Digne-les-Bains was formalised on 25 June 1988, following the decree of 21 June 1988 published on 24 June of the same year in the &quot;Official Journal&quot;. Previously, the commune was simply called Digne, still a frequent appellation in the current language.

The Vivaro-Alpine Occitan , is written as &quot;Dinha&quot; in the . The Provençal , is written as &quot;Digno&quot; in the Mistralian norm.

==History==
===Prehistory and antiquity===
Digne-les-Bains dates back to the Neolithic era. The presence of three rivers, the Bléone, the &quot;Mardaric&quot;, and the &quot;Eaux-Chaudes&quot;, made the place ideal for human settlement. Before the Roman conquest, it was the capital of the Bodiontici (or &quot;Brodiontii&quot;), whose name is found on the Tropaeum Alpium at La Turbie. The town then became a Roman town named &quot;Dinia&quot; in the 1st century, and became a frequent commercial stop during the Roman era. Following the Romans, it was known as &quot;Digna&quot; by 780, and was appreciated for its thermal waters.

There are a few rural settlements near to the town, such as the Hôtelleries de Gaubert, southeast of the town, where the excavated building was occupied from the beginning of the 1st century to the end of the 4th century. In this area, at the foot of Le Cousson, the soil has been cultivated continuously, from antiquity right up to the recent reforestation.

===Middle Ages===
Two separate districts were formed: The town and the city. The town, an ancient site, was surrounded with the &quot;castrum&quot; of the episcopal chateau built on the Rock. The two neighbourhoods functioned as two independent entities from each other and from their inception. The town remained under the supervision of the provost of the chapter while the city or &quot;castrum&quot; was of the bishop. The arrival of the Angevins at the head of the County of Provence in 1246 accelerated the recovery process of the comital rights usurped during the previous period by lay or ecclesiastical lords.

The return of the comtal power in the city led to a change in the relationship between local authorities and community: In 1260, the city of Digne was given the right to appoint cominaux responsible for ensuring the management of the city. The consolidation of the two sites was done administratively in 1385 by institutional trustees, replacing the cominaux, responsible for representing both the city and the village. The institution evolved with administrative rationalisation at the beginning of the 15th century.

From 1475, preaching by Franciscans caused several murderous anti-Jewish riots.

===Early Modern era===
Like the rest of France, Digne was taken in the Wars of Religion. In 1562, the Huguenots broke into the cathedral, shredded the tables and smashed statues, removed relics and ornaments and burnt them with the choir on the forecourt. The town was attacked by Protestants in 1574. In 1575, it was the Church of Saint-Jérôme which was sacked. In the following years, the city remained under pressure. In 1579, the captain of Archal occupied the surrounding countryside.

In 1589, with the advent of Henry IV, the ultra-Catholics in the Catholic League controlled the town, until 1591. The same year, the town fell before the Royal armies of Lesdiguières. The cathedral, guarded by the defenders, was attacked, bombarded with catapults and then stormed. It is also during this period that the inhabitants seized the château of the bishops, on Le Rochas, destroying it to prevent it from falling into the hands of one party or another.

===French Revolution and the First Empire===
The news of the storming of the Bastille was welcomed, this event announced the end of royal arbitrariness and, perhaps, more profound changes in the organization of the France. Immediately after the arrival of the new, a great phenomenon of collective fear seized France, the fear of an aristocratic conspiracy wishing to recover their privileges. Rumors of troops in arms, devastating everything in their path, propagated at high speed, causing shots of weapons, the organization of militias and anti-aristocratic violence. This great fear, arrived in Seyne on 31 July and belonging to the current &quot;fear of the Mâconnais&quot;, reached Digne and its region on 31 July 1789 the day before spreading to Riez, where it arrived during the day, and Moustiers and Castellane.

The city was established as the capital of the Basses-Alpes from March 1790, to the creation of the departments. The of Digne was founded in September 1790 (the second Department by seniority); it was affiliated with the Jacobins in June 1791, and became a relay of the club in the Department, accepting the affiliations of many clubs in the Basses-Alpes. It also received the request of affiliation of Carpentras. First called &quot;Bourgeois Alcove&quot;, it then took the name of &quot;Patriotic Club&quot;, then on 9 October 1792, &quot;Société des amis de la Constitution, de la Liberté, de l’Égalité&quot; [Society of friends of the Constitution, of freedom, of equality]. It established a committee of correspondence responsible for relations with other societies affiliated on 14 November 1792. On 10 and 11 January 1793, performed a descent from Marseilles, supported by the Marseille club-goers with weapons. He took revenge because he was unable to obtain the post of attorney general trustee, two departmental administrators were removed and a fine of 13,000 livres paid to the Marseille club.

In 1792–1793, the section of Digne was controlled by the . In connection with the section of Marseille, it disseminated the ideas of the Girondists, until their proscription on 31 May 1793 and the crushing of the federalist insurrection in July, which resulted in a sentence to death in Digne.

On 5 frimaire year III, the Représentant en mission purified the society.

Digne welcomed the prefecture under the Consulate. The prefect Lameth (1802–1805), created a shaded promenade between Pré de Foire and the banks of the Bléone and planted plane trees on the boulevard Gassendi.

In early March 1815 Napoleon Bonaparte passed through Digne-les-Bains on his way from imprisonment on the island of Elba, gathering support as he moved north. This was early in his Hundred Days which ended with his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.

===Contemporary era===
In 1851, the announcement of the coup d&#x27;état of 2 December caused uplift in rural areas, and peasants installed a provisional government in Digne.

As many municipalities of the Department Digne acquired schools well before the Jules Ferry laws. However, no instruction was given to girls in 1861, only the Falloux Laws (1851) required the opening of a girls school in the communes with more than 800 inhabitants (and that Courbons and Gaubert, small neighbouring rural communes, have a girls school). It was only in the 1860s that the town of Digne chose to open a school for girls (plus the Gaubert and Courbons schools for girls). It was with the Ferry laws that all girls of Digne and the attached villages were regularly educated.

In 1862, Digne absorbed the neighbouring areas of Courbons, Gaubert and Les Sieyes. These connected communes also had their schools, each a school for boys, with Courbons and Gaubert furthermore possessing a school for girls. The commune of Dourbes had two schools for boys (at Dourbes and at Villard), and none for girls.

210 people of Digne died for France during World War I. The hospital took care of the soldiers injured in the fighting, including nearly seventy who died of their injuries, and are buried in the military cemetery of the village square. This square also includes the bodies of two soldiers who died during the Second World War.

====WWII====
The first resistance fighters were a group organized around Simone Pellissier who distributed the journal &quot;Combat&quot;, from 1941. On 1 May 1942, she laid a wreath at the war memorial, during a demonstration; she was arrested the next day with six other protesters.

Digne was occupied by Italy, then by the German army, following the invasion of the free zone, after the landing of the Allies in North Africa on 8 November 1942. Thirty-four Jews were arrested in Digne before being deported.

With the dissolution of the , Commandant Chaumont of the began to structure the local Organisation de résistance de l&#x27;armée (ORA).

===Liberation===
On 16 August 1944, the city was bombed by P-47 Thunderbolts, which took off from field close to Bastia in Corsica. Their goal was the great bridge of Digne, crossing the Bléone, but only a single bomb reached the bridge, impeding the passage of vehicles for only a few hours. Several buildings were damaged. The bombing killed twenty-four civilians and two Germans (25 in total according to Jean Garcin).
The city was liberated on 19 August 1944 by Taskforce Butler, a motorized detachment of armoured elements, infantry and artillery from the 36th U.S. &quot;Texas&quot; infantry division and the 45th U.S. infantry division, assisted by the forces of the Resistance.

The release of Digne was part of a movement of circumvention of the Rhône Valley, across the Alps, by the Route Napoléon, entrusted to Taskforce Butler and which aimed to cut the retreat of the German army stationed in Provence. In Aspres-sur-Buëch, the column moved westward, in the direction of the Rhône and Crest (Battle of Montelimar). The fighting was in the day, with six killed and eleven wounded on the Allied side and at least 21 killed on the German side. German soldiers who fell during the fighting for the liberation of Digne were buried in the German military square of the cemetery of the village, with the other soldiers killed during the occupation, during various battles against the forces of Resistance. In March 1958, their bodies were exhumed and transferred to the German military cemetery of Dagneux in Ain.

Immediately after the Liberation, the cleanup began. Executions after trials (with a judge, but without lawyers) took place.

The German prisoner of war camp had up to 2,700 prisoners. One of them participated in the rescue expedition after the double air disaster of the in 1948.

===The end of the war===
From the beginning of 1945, new convoys of troops moved through the town, in the direction of the pockets of German resistance around the Ubaye.

===From 1945 to the early 21st century===
In 1974, the neighboring village of Dourbes was attached to Digne. The municipality changed its name to Digne-les-Bains in 1988. Nowadays, the town of Digne-les-Bains continues to expand, mainly along the banks of the Bléone. It forms, with Entrages, Marcoux, La Robine-sur-Galabre, and Mezel, the (CC3V). The areas of Le Pigeonnier and Barbejas have been classified as Sensitive urban zones.

On 24 March 2015 Germanwings Flight 9525, carrying 150 people (including six crewmembers), had a rapid descent from cruising altitude approximately 45 minutes after takeoff. It crashed a few miles from the city, en route to Düsseldorf from Barcelona.

The commune maintains a southern aspect and has remarkable heritage items including two cathedrals, an archaeological crypt under the Cathedral of Notre-Dame-du-Bourg [Our Lady of the City], the chapels (Saint Pancrace, Our Lady of Lourdes, etc.)

The , an historical monument, is a Romanesque cathedral whose foundations date back to the 9th century. Victim of numerous attacks and looting, it was renovated at the beginning of the 13th century. Parts from the 11th and 12th centuries still exist. Its white marble altar is of the Merovingian era.

An archaeological crypt in the basement of the cathedral aids in the discovery of the history of Digne-les-Bains. In the crypt is the exact location of the origins of the city, attested by the presence of ancient walls from the 1st century AD. This corresponds to an urban space and implementation of three buildings of Christianity from the 5th century to the 11th century.

The Saint-Jérôme Cathedral, also an historical monument, is a Gothic cathedral from the 15th and 16th centuries. The facade is from the 19th century.

The Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes Church was built in 1870 on the Mountain of the Cross, north of Digne, though at the bottom of the slope. The brick walls are its main feature, with its large size.

The chapel of Saint-Vincent belonged to an abbey or priory. It is still in good condition. The Chapel of the Cross, located nearby, is gradually becoming a ruin.

There are numerous churches in the connected communes.

In Courbons, the parish church is Notre-Dame-des-Anges (13th-14th century). It was dedicated to St. Clair in the 17th century. Its single nave consists of three arched barrel bays, and emerges into a square choir. There is also a chapel of Saint-Pierre, south of the village, an establishment which may be very old.

The Church of Dourbes is under the name of Saint-Genest, and the oldest parts are from the 12th and 13th centuries. In Villard, the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Chapel probably dates from the 17th century.

In Gaubert, the parish church of Saint-Étienne was built in Romanesque style at the end of the 16th and 17th century. Grand-Saint-Martin farm incorporates some remains of a medieval priory. The chapel of St. Sebastian is situated on the ridge east of the village.

In Sieyès, the Church of Sainte-Marie-Madeleine remains along with the Church of Saint-Véran, between the stadium and the cemetery. A more recent chapel was built next to the town hall and school.

There are also two chapels on the mountain which overlooks the ravine of Eaux-Chaudes to the north, Saint-Pons which is in ruins, and the Chapel of Saint-Pancrace. The latter dates from the 17th century and is being restored. It has the distinction of having its bells suspended in a flat metal campanile. The pilgrimage of 12 May, when the priest blessed the sources, remained into the 1950s, and has recently resumed.

====Civil and military architecture====
*The remains of fortifications can be recognised if one pays attention to the plan of the old town around the central district, built on the heights. Some of the walls and some towers which surrounded the city from the 14th century can still be seen. These remains of ramparts are currently based in the landscape of the dwellings.
*Hotel Thoron de la Robine from the 17th century
* from 1829, which is an historical monument

Its rolling course, measured at according to the protocols of the French Athletics Federation, goes through the most spectacular sites of the , some of which are world-renowned. Examples of these include the clues of Barles and Péouré, the &quot;Vélodrome d’Esclangon&quot; [Velodrome of Escanglon], &quot;Voile de Facibelle&quot; [Veil of Facibelle], the Demoiselles coiffées, the Ichthyosaur, and the Dalle à ammonites.

Free racing and animations for children as well as heritage walks are also organized parallel to sports competitions. The event also fits into an exemplary sustainable development policy which gives it national recognition.

===Heraldry===

These arms are not attested before the 17th century and the above composition is only one variant among many others existing. The &quot;L&quot; can be gold and can be replaced by silver lions. There are also versions without the golden &quot;L&quot; or lion: &quot;&quot;azure to a fleur de lis of gold, accompanied at head by a cross of silver with a letter &quot;D&quot; of the same at the point&quot;. The latest version is &quot;azure to a cross of gold at head and a &quot;D&quot; of the same at head&quot;&quot;. The cross is an evocation of the episcopal see, and the &quot;L&quot;, perhaps, is a souvenir of a concession of Louis II of Anjou, from the beginning of the 15th century.

Gabriel Gillybœuf proposed in the early 1980s to replace the capitalised &quot;D&quot; with a fountain expressed in heraldic terms by &quot;a bezant fess, wavy silver and azure&quot; (while maintaining the cross, fleur-de-lis, and capitalised &quot;L&quot; respectively).

The city was jointly owned by the Counts of Provence and the Bishops of Digne. Hence the arms: The cross symbolises the bishopric, the fleur-de-lis as Charles of Anjou, Count of Provence. The letter &quot;D&quot; is the letter of the city. The letters &quot;L&quot; have been added under Louis XIV, King of France, Count of Provence and Forcalquier.

<text>Lorraine () is an affluent off-island suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada on the north shore of the Rivière des Mille-Îles in the Thérèse-De Blainville Regional County Municipality. There are no industries and only a very limited commercial district (comprising one medical centre, one shopping mall, a golf course, a gym, a supermarket and arena); almost all houses are of the detached type. Furthermore, a large portion of the town territory is set aside as wild forest (Forêt du Grand Côteau); some bike/ski trails run through it. The town is divided into two areas, Uptown and Downtown (or &quot;Lorraine en haut&quot; and &quot;Lorraine en bas&quot;, colloquially, because the northern area is on higher ground). These two areas are also delimited by Quebec freeway A-640, and are only joined together by the main street (Boulevard de Gaulle) overpass.

Lorraine has earned a reputation for high-end homes with pristine lawns. Due to the heat and humidity of summers in the region, many of these properties have in ground swimming pools in backyards. The town prides itself with completely underground utility networks apart from a small older section of the town (Avenue Fraser, Mey and Bruyeres in particular). The absence of telephone and electric poles contributes to the aesthetic appeal of the municipality.

The town was founded February 4, 1960 and is named for the French region of the same name.

The town is the territory of the Roman Catholic parishal community of Charles-de-Foucault (old parish), part of the (new) Saint-Luc parish of the Terrebonne pastoral region of the Saint-Jérôme diocese. The town is now part of the Thérèse-De Blainville federal electoral district (Marc-Aurèle-Fortin federal electoral district) and Blainville provincial electoral district. It makes district 22 of the Seigneurie-des-Milles-Îles French school board and is part of district 8 of the Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier English school board. Lorraine is also a member of the Montreal Metropolitan Community.

The town has three elementary schools: École Le Carrefour and École Le Tournesol, which are very close to each other but separated by Parc Lorraine, as well as École du Ruisselet.

==History==
This town was founded in 1960 on the Garth estate, land which would have served as the headquarters of the British army during the Patriote rebellion in 1837. Maison Garth, built-in 1833, is listed as a historic monument, although still in use. This model residential community was founded as part of a federal program of the defunct Ministry of Urban Affairs, which encouraged the creation of “new towns”.

==Education==
The Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Îles (CSSMI) operates Francophone public schools.

Francophone primary schools:

<doc id="1055193" wikidata="Q859748" url="?curid=1055193" title="Madagascar subhumid forests">
<text>The Madagascar subhumid forests are a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion that covers most of the Central Highlands of the island of Madagascar. They are included in the WWF&#x27;s Global 200 list of outstanding ecoregions. Most of the original habitats have been lost due to human pressure.

==Geography==
The Madagascar subhumid forests ecoregion covers Madagascar&#x27;s highlands, which extend north and south along the length of the island, above approximately elevation on the east and above meters elevation on the west. 

The Central Highlands is the largest highland region on the island, extending from approximately 16º to 23º south. The Central Highlands include Ankaratra and the Andringitra Massif, which is home to Pic Boby (2,658 m), the Central Highlands&#x27; highest peak.

The Northern Highlands includes the Tsaratanana Massif in the north, home to Maromokotro (2,876 m) Madagascar&#x27;s highest peak, and the massifs of Marojejy to the northeast and Manongarivo to the northwest. It is separated from the Central Highlands by the Mandritsara Window, an east–west-running gap in the mountains with elevations below 800 meters.

The Southern Highlands include the Anosyenne Mountains and adjacent uplands in the southern part of the island. It is separated from the Central Highlands by the Menaharaka Window, another gap below 800 meters elevation, at approximately 23°S latitude. The highest peak in the Southern Highlands is Pic d&#x27;Andohahela at 1,959 meters.

The ecoregion includes some smaller outlying peaks, notably Montagne d&#x27;Ambre near the northern tip of Madagascar, the Makay Massif in west-central Madasgascar, and the Isalo and Analavelona massifs in the southwest of the island.

The subhumid forests extend to the northwest coast in the Sambirano region, including the island of Nosy Be. Most of that area is now covered by secondary grasslands and agriculture, with forest reduced to fragmented patches. The Sambirano region, also known as the Sambirano Domain, is a particular centre of endemism.

The ecoregion has an area of approximately . The highlands catch the wet northeast trade winds, and the eastern slopes generally receive more rainfall. The ecoregion includes the headwaters of most of Madagascar&#x27;s rivers, and wetlands like Lake Alaotra. Areas to the south, west, and north lie in the drier rain shadow of the highlands. The subhumid forests are bounded at lower elevations by the humid Madagascar lowland forests along the coastal strip to the east, by the Madagascar dry deciduous forests to the north and west, and by the sub-arid Madagascar succulent forests and Madagascar spiny thickets to the southwest and south. In four areas above elevation, the subhumid forests transition to the montane Madagascar ericoid thickets.

Montagne d&#x27;Ambre near the northern tip of the island, contains a significant pocket of subhumid forest, surrounded at lower elevations by dry deciduous forest, as do Ankaratra, upland near Tsaratanana, Andringitra Massif, Ambohitantely Reserve, and the Ambohijanahary area. The subhumid forests ecoregion also includes the disjunct Analavelona and Isalo massifs to the southwest, surrounded by succulent forests at lower elevations.

==Flora==
The ecoregion is home to several distinct plant communities, which differ with elevation, rainfall, and soils. These include moist montane forest, sclerophyllous montane forest, tapia forest, rupicolous shrubland, and grassland.

The original flora of the ecoregion has been much altered by human use; extensive areas have been cleared for agriculture, grazing, and rice cultivation, and some exotic species such as &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; have been introduced. Moist evergreen forests are less susceptible to fire than the sclerophyll forests and ericoid thickets. Frequent human-set fires have transformed some of the ecoregion&#x27;s former forests into savannas and grasslands. Grassland now covers much of the highlands, but the extent to which the grasslands are the result of human intervention is still subject to debate.

Moist montane forest occurs between 600–800 and 1300 meters elevation, and occasionally as high as 1800 m in sheltered locales. The mature tree canopy is generally closed, and 20 to 25 meters high. Trees are typically evergreen, and species of &quot;Tambourissa, Pterophylla&quot;, &quot;Symphonia, Dombeya, Dilobeia, Dalbergia, Canarium, Diospyros, Eugenia, Protorhus, Grewia, Brachylaena, Astropanax, Polyscias&quot;, and &quot;Vernonia&quot; are most common. The conifer &quot;Podocarpus madagascariensis&quot; is also present. Trees of the genus &quot;Ephippiandra&quot; are largely confined to moist montane forest and some higher-elevation plant communities. There is a plentiful understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants. Epiphytes grow in large numbers on the canopy trees, including mosses, lichens, ferns, orchids (particularly species of &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot;), and species of &quot;Medinilla, Kalanchoe, Rhipsalis&quot;, and &quot;Peperomia&quot;.

Sclerophyllous montane forest is low sclerophyllous (hard-leaved) forests and open-canopied woodlands from 1300 to 2000 meters elevation, dominated by small-leaved trees. The canopy is generally no higher than 10 to 13 meters, and can resemble a thicket. Common canopy trees include &quot;Dicoryphe viticoides, Tina isoneura, Razafimandimbisonia minor&quot;, and &quot;Baronia taratana&quot;. Gymnosperms, including species of &quot;Podocarpus&quot;, and bamboo can form pure stands. The trees and the ground are covered in mosses and lichens.
Tapia forest is found on the drier western slopes, which are in the rain shadow of the central uplands, between 600 and 1,600 meters elevation. Tapia (&quot;Uapaca bojeri&quot;) is a characteristic canopy tree, together with &quot;Leptolaena pauciflora, L. bojerana&quot;, and &quot;Sarcolaena oblongifolia&quot;. The trees have gnarled branches and small leaves, forming a mostly closed canopy 10 to 12 meters high which provides light shade on the forest floor. Other trees include &quot;Asteropeia densiflora, Agarista salicifolia, Pterophylla&quot; spp., &quot;Dodonaea madagascariensis, Faurea forficuliflora, Brachylaena microphylla, Dicoma incana, Baronia taratana, Abrahamia buxifolia, Neocussonia bojeri, Alberta&quot; spp., and &quot;Enterospermum&quot; spp. The understory is typically shrubs, including species of &quot;Erica, Vaccinium&quot;, Asteraceae (&quot;Senecio, Vernonia, Psiadia, Conyza&quot;, and &quot;Helichrysum&quot;), Rubiaceae, and Leguminosae. Tapia is fire-resistant, and where fires have been frequently set they form open woodlands or savannas with a grassy understory.

Rupicolous shrubland grows on rock outcrops and sandstone and granite inselbergs. Vegetation grows in crevices and on thin mats of coarse soil, and is often sparse and rarely more than two meters high. Common plants include the sedge &quot;Coleochloa setifera&quot;, the shrub &quot;Myrothamnus moschata&quot;, and species of &quot;Euphorbia&quot;. The shrublands are home to many endemic species including succulents in the genera &quot;Aloe&quot;, &quot;Kalanchoe&quot;, and &quot;Pachypodium&quot;. Revivescent plants, which periodically dry out and then revive when rains return, include the moss-like &quot;Selaginella echinata&quot; and the ferns &quot;Pellaea, Actiniopteris&quot;, and &quot;Notholaena&quot;. 

Sambirano forests. The Sambirano region, also known as the Sambirano Domain, is a coastal region of northwestern Madagascar, lying west of the Tsaratanana and Manongarivo massifs. The region has higher rainfall than the rest of the west coast, and is home to distinctive forests. The Sambirano forests are predominantly evergreen, with some deciduous species characteristic of the dry forests to the north and south, which form a mature canopy 25 to 30 meters high. The Sambirano forests are home to several endemic species of plants and animals. Lowland primary forest has been reduced to small patches.

Secondary grasslands cover broad areas of the highlands. They are typically species–poor. &#x27;Tanety&#x27; grasslands are low, sparse grasslands between 1,200 and 1,500 meters elevation, where &quot;Aristida rufescens&quot; is the characteristic species. &#x27;Tampoketsa&#x27; grasslands cover the plateaus north and northeast of Antananarivo, between 1,600 and 1,900 meters elevation. The Madagascar endemic grass &quot;Loudetia simplex&quot; subsp. &quot;stipoides&quot; is predominant, interspersed with small patches of remnant forest. Low grasslands have also replaced most of the former tapia forests on the western slopes, between 800 and 1,600 meters elevation.

Above 2000 meters the sclerophyll forests transition to the high-elevation ericoid thickets, which are considered a distinct subalpine ecoregion.

==Fauna==

Endemic species include a number of birds, reptiles and mammals including the Alaotra gentle lemur (&quot;Hapalemur alaotrensis&quot;) and a number of shrews, tenrecs, and rodents. The subhumid forests were formerly home to the island&#x27;s distinct megafauna, including giant lemurs, some of them larger than modern gorillas, the elephant birds (Aepyornithidae), and giant tortoises.

The Sambirano mouse lemur (&quot;Microcebus sambiranensis&quot;), Sambirano woolly lemur (&quot;Avahi unicolor&quot;), and Sambirano fork-marked lemur (&quot;Phaner parienti&quot;) are endemic to the Sambirano region.

The ecoregion is home to several endemic and limited-range species of birds. The rufous-headed ground roller (&quot;Atelornis crossleyi&quot;), grey-crowned tetraka (&quot;Xanthomixis cinereiceps&quot;) and forest rock thrush (&quot;Monticola sharpei&quot;) are largely endemic to the ecoregion. The yellow-bellied sunbird-asity (&quot;Neodrepanis hypoxantha&quot;), Madagascar yellowbrow (&quot;Crossleyia xanthophrys&quot;), and cryptic warbler (&quot;Cryptosylvicola randrianasoloi&quot;) are native to the subhumid forests and to the higher-elevation ericoid thickets. The Madagascar serpent eagle (&quot;Eutriorchis astur&quot;), short-legged ground roller (&quot;Brachypteracias leptosomus&quot;), Madagascar red owl (&quot;Tyto soumagnei&quot;), and Pollen&#x27;s vanga (&quot;Xenopirostris polleni&quot;) live in both the subhumid forests and the lowland moist forests. The brown emu-tail (&quot;Bradypterus brunneus&quot;) lives in the lowland and subhumid forests and the ericoid thickets.

Lake Alaotra and its wetlands were once home to two endemic water birds, the Madagascar pochard (&quot;Aythya innotata&quot;) and Alaotra grebe (&quot;Tachybaptus rufolavatus&quot;). Both have disappeared from the lake. The Alaotra grebe is thought extinct, and the Madagascar pochard was thought extinct until a small population was sighted at Lake Matsaborimena.

Two dry forest species, Coquerel&#x27;s coua (&quot;Coua coquereli&quot;) and Schlegel&#x27;s asity (&quot;Philepitta schlegeli&quot;) also inhabit the humid forests of Sambirano.

==Threats and conservation==
The central highlands are the most densely populated region of Madagascar, and includes the country&#x27;s capital and largest city, Antananarivo. The highlands&#x27; population is growing. 

Madagascar&#x27;s high plateau forests have been altered by humans in most places. There has been extensive slash-and-burn activity by native peoples in the central highlands, eliminating most forest. Other impacts include land clearing for agriculture, overexploitation, introduced species, and pollution.

7.68% of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include:

* Marojejy National Park
* Isalo National Park
* Ranomafana National Park
* Andohahela National Park
* Andringitra National Park
* Lokobe National Park
* Montagne d&#x27;Ambre National Park
* Befotaka Midongy National Park

<text>Liam James Rosenior (born 9 July 1984) is an English professional football manager and former player who is the current head coach of Ligue 1 club Strasbourg.

As a player, he played either as a full-back or winger. He played for Bristol City, Fulham, Torquay United, Reading, Ipswich Town, Hull City and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. He is a former England U20 and England U21 international with a combined total of 11 caps and 1 goal.

Rosenior was interim manager at Derby County in 2022 and managed Hull in the EFL Championship from November 2022 to May 2024. He was then named as manager of Strasbourg.

==Club career==
===Bristol City===
Born in Wandsworth in London, Rosenior started his career with Bristol City as a midfielder. He made his debut in the Football League Second Division on 20 April 2002, coming on as a 66th-minute substitute for Joe Burnell and seconds later assisting the equaliser for Aaron Brown in a 1–1 home draw with Stoke City.

On 28 December 2002, Rosenior scored his first goal in a 4–1 win away to Stockport County, having earlier assisted Danny Coles. He scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory for Bristol City against Carlisle United in the 2003 Football League Trophy final at the Millennium Stadium. In the first round of Bristol City&#x27;s cup run they defeated Queens Park Rangers on penalties, and Rosenior scored the winning penalty in the shootout.

===Fulham===
On 12 November 2003, Rosenior joined Premier League club Fulham for a £55,000 fee. In 2004 he was loaned to Torquay United of the Football League Third Division, managed by his father Leroy Rosenior.

Rosenior made his debut for Fulham on 22 September 2004 in a League Cup game away to Boston United, being sent off in the last minute of a 4–1 win for diving in the hope of winning a penalty. He made his league debut for Fulham on 13 December in a 1–1 home draw with Manchester United, earning the Sky Sports Man of the Match award. On 7 May 2005, his season ended with another dismissal in a 3–1 win at Blackburn Rovers for pushing Robbie Savage in response to the Welshman&#x27;s foul on Luís Boa Morte.

Rosenior scored once for Fulham, in a League Cup tie against Lincoln City at Craven Cottage on 21 September 2005, netting in extra time of a 5–4 win. He signed a four-year extension to his Fulham contract in July 2006.

===Reading===
Rosenior joined fellow Premier League team Reading on 31 August 2007 for an undisclosed fee on a three-year contract, with Seol Ki-Hyeon going the other way. His debut for Reading came in a 2–1 defeat to Sunderland on 15 September, and he scored his first goal for Reading in a 7–4 defeat to Portsmouth two weeks later, although it was initially awarded to Stephen Hunt.

On 2 September 2009, Rosenior joined Championship club Ipswich Town on loan for the remainder of 2009–10 season, under manager Roy Keane. He scored once in 31 games for the Portman Road club, equalising in a 2–1 loss at Barnsley on 3 October.

===Hull City===

On 29 October 2010, Rosenior joined Hull City on a short-term agreement until 1 January 2011. He made his debut the following day in the away match at Barnsley. He signed a -year deal with Hull on 21 December 2010. Saying &quot;I&#x27;m delighted, It&#x27;s something that we kind of half agreed when I first came here, but it relied on the takeover being completed for me to stay.&quot;

On 22 March 2014, Rosenior scored his only goal for Hull City when heading the rebound in from a Nikica Jelavić penalty that was saved by West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster. On 17 May 2014, he started in the 2014 FA Cup final against Arsenal.
On 28 May 2015, Hull City released Rosenior and five other players who were out of contract at the end of the 2014–15 season.

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
On 23 June 2015, Rosenior signed for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on a three-year deal following his release from Hull City. He retired from playing on 30 July 2018.

==International career==
Rosenior was born in England, and is of Sierra Leonean descent through his father, Leroy Rosenior, who was an international footballer for Sierra Leone. Rosenior was called up to the England U21 squad in March 2005, and made his debut in a 2–2 draw with Germany U21 on 25 March 2005, closely followed by a second cap in a 2–0 win over Azerbaijan U21 on 29 March 2005 His performances earned him a call up to the England U20 squad for the Toulon Tournament in June 2005, where he played three times and scored one goal.

However, it would be over a year and a half before he would add to his England U21 caps, with the next one coming against Netherlands U21 on 14 November 2006. Rosenior made it into the squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, but only made one appearance, as a substitute in the semi-final against Holland U21. He took part in the shootout in this game, scoring his penalty as England lost 13–12. Due to his age, this would prove to be his seventh and last appearance for the England U21 team.

==Coaching career==
===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
Following his retirement from playing, Rosenior remained at Brighton, taking up the position of assistant coach with Brighton&#x27;s under-23 team, which he combined with appearing as a pundit on Sky Sports.

===Derby County===
On 10 July 2019, Rosenior was appointed as specialist first team coach to Phillip Cocu at Derby County. He was appointed assistant manager of the club on 15 January 2021 following the appointment of Wayne Rooney as manager.

Following Rooney&#x27;s resignation on 24 June 2022, Rosenior took over as interim manager. He was relieved of his duties as manager on 21 September 2022 while still employed by the club as Derby sought a permanent manager. Following the appointment of Paul Warne, Rosenior left the club.

===Hull City===
On 3 November 2022, Rosenior was appointed head coach at Hull City on a two-and-a-half-year deal, returning to the club where he made 161 appearances between 2010 and 2015.

On 17 December 2023, Hull City announced that Rosenior had signed a new three-year contract, keeping him at the club until 2026.

In April 2024, Rosenior suffered racist abuse after being nominated for the EFL Championship Manager of the Season award.

On 7 May 2024, after a seventh-place finish for Hull City caused the team to narrowly miss out on the play-offs, Rosenior was sacked. Hull City owner, Acun Ilicali said that Rosenior had been sacked over a difference on football philosophy between the two with Ilicali wanting attacking football and Rosenior unable to offer that as a manager.

===Strasbourg===
On 25 July 2024, Rosenior was appointed as the new head coach of Ligue 1 club Strasbourg, joining the BlueCo club on a three-year deal. He replaced Patrick Vieira, who had left by mutual consent after finishing 13th. Rosenior&#x27;s debut on 18 August saw him field the French top flight&#x27;s first starting XI in which all outfield players were under 23, in a 1–1 draw at Montpellier.

==Personal life==
He is the son of fellow manager and former player Leroy Rosenior.

<doc id="1055198" wikidata="Q603162" url="?curid=1055198" title="Paper Moon (film)">
<text>Paper Moon is a 1973 American road comedy-drama film directed by Peter Bogdanovich and released by Paramount Pictures. Screenwriter Alvin Sargent adapted the script from the 1971 novel &quot;Addie Pray&quot; by Joe David Brown. The film, shot in black-and-white, is set in Kansas and Missouri during the Great Depression. It stars the real-life father and daughter pairing of Ryan and Tatum O&#x27;Neal as protagonists Moze and Addie.

Tatum O&#x27;Neal received widespread praise from critics for her performance as Addie, earning her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, making her the youngest competitive winner in the history of the Academy Awards.

==Plot==
In Gorham, Kansas, circa 1936, itinerant con man Moses Pray meets nine-year-old Addie Loggins at her mother&#x27;s graveside service, where the neighbors suspect he is Addie&#x27;s father. He denies this, but agrees to deliver the orphaned Addie to her aunt&#x27;s home in St. Joseph, Missouri.

At a local grain mill, Moses convinces the brother of the man who accidentally killed Addie&#x27;s mother to give him $200 for the newly orphaned Addie. Addie overhears this conversation and, after Moses spends nearly half the money fixing his old Model A convertible and buying her a train ticket, she demands the money as rightfully hers, whereupon Moses agrees to let Addie travel with him until he has raised back the full $200 to give to her. Thereafter, Moses visits recently widowed women, pretending to have previously sold expensive, personalized Bibles to their deceased husbands, and the widows pay him for the Bibles inscribed with their names. Addie joins the scam, pretending she is his daughter, and exhibits a talent for confidence tricks, such as selling Bibles and the quick change scam. As time passes, Moses and Addie become a formidable team.

One night, Addie and &quot;Moze&quot; (as Addie addresses him) stop at a local carnival, where Moze becomes enthralled with an &quot;exotic dancer&quot; named Miss Trixie Delight and leaves Addie at a photo booth to have her photograph taken alone (of herself sitting on a crescent moon, to suggest the film&#x27;s title). Much to Addie&#x27;s chagrin, Moze invites &quot;Miss Trixie&quot;—and her downtrodden teenage maid, Imogene—to join Addie and him. Addie soon becomes friends with Imogene and jealous of Trixie. Imogene reveals that Trixie works, at least occasionally, as a prostitute, and it is suggested she has a venereal disease causing her a frequent need to urinate. When Addie subsequently discovers that Moze has spent their money on a brand-new Model 48 convertible to impress Miss Trixie, she and Imogene devise a plan. They convince a clerk at the hotel where the group is staying to visit Trixie. Addie then sends Moze up to Trixie&#x27;s room, where he discovers the clerk and Trixie having sex. Moze promptly leaves Miss Trixie and Imogene behind, with Addie leaving Imogene enough money to pay for her own passage home.

While staying at another hotel in a rural area, Moze uncovers a bootlegger&#x27;s store full of whiskey, steals some of it, and sells it back to the bootlegger. Unfortunately, the bootlegger&#x27;s twin brother is the local sheriff, and he quickly arrests Addie and Moze. Addie hides their money in her hat, steals back the key to their car, and the pair escape. To elude pursuit, they trade their new car for a decrepit Model T farm truck after Moze beats a hillbilly, Leroy, in a &quot;rasslin&#x27; match&quot;.

Moze and Addie make it across the state line to Missouri, where Moze sets up another swindle, only to be caught again by the sheriff and his deputies; outside their jurisdiction and unable to make an arrest, they beat Moze and rob him of his and Addie&#x27;s savings. Humiliated and defeated, Moze drops Addie at the house of her aunt in St. Joseph, but a disappointed Addie rejoins him on the road. When he refuses her company, she reminds him that he still owes her $200 and points out that his truck has just rolled away without him. They catch the truck and leave together.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Director===
The film project was originally associated with John Huston and was to star Paul Newman and his daughter, who was a child actor at the time named Nell Potts. However, when Huston left the project, the Newmans became dissociated from the film as well. Peter Bogdanovich had just completed &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; and was looking for another project when his ex-wife and frequent collaborator Polly Platt recommended filming Joe David Brown&#x27;s script for the novel &quot;Addie Pray.&quot; Bogdanovich, a fan of period films, and having two young daughters of his own, found himself drawn to the story, and selected it as his next film.

===Casting===
At the suggestion of Polly Platt, Bogdanovich approached eight-year-old Tatum O&#x27;Neal to audition for the role, although she had no acting experience. Bogdanovich had worked with Tatum&#x27;s father Ryan O&#x27;Neal on &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;, and decided to cast them as the leads.

===Screenplay===
Various changes were made in adapting the book to film. Addie&#x27;s age was reduced from twelve to nine to accommodate young Tatum, several events from the book were combined for pacing issues, and the last third of the novel, when Moses and Addie graduate to the big leagues as con artists after going into partnership with a fake millionaire, was dropped. The location was also changed from the rural south of the novel–primarily Alabama—to midwestern Kansas and Missouri.

===Filming locations===
The film was shot in the small towns of Hays, Kansas; McCracken, Kansas; Wilson, Kansas; Dorrance, Kansas, and St. Joseph, Missouri. Various shooting locations include the Midland Hotel at Wilson, Kansas; the railway depot at Gorham, Kansas; storefronts and buildings on Main Street in White Cloud, Kansas; Hays, Kansas; sites on both sides of the Missouri River; Rulo Bridge; and St. Joseph, Missouri.

===Props===
The car Moses is driving when he agrees to take Addie home is a 1930 Ford Model A convertible; the car Moses buys to impress Miss Trixie is a 1936 Ford V8 De Luxe convertible. The whiskey being sold by the bootlegger shown toward the end of the film is Three Feathers blended whiskey, a label introduced by Oldtyme Distilling Corp. in 1882 and still produced up to the 1980s. The bottle of soda pop Addie drinks is from Nehi Soda, by a company founded as Chero-Cola in 1910, in 1925 renamed Nehi Corporation, which became Royal Crown Company and later Dr Pepper/Seven Up, then Dr Pepper Snapple Group.

===Title===
Peter Bogdanovich also decided to change the name of the film from &quot;Addie Pray&quot;. While selecting music for the film, he heard the song &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot; by Billy Rose, Yip Harburg, and Harold Arlen. Seeking advice from his close friend and mentor Orson Welles, Bogdanovich listed &quot;Paper Moon&quot; as a possible alternative. Welles responded: &quot;That title is so good, you shouldn&#x27;t even make the picture, you should just release the title!&quot; Bogdanovich added the scene in which Addie has her picture taken in a paper moon solely so the studio would allow him to use the title.

===Cinematography and editing===
Director of photography László Kovács used a red filter on the camera on Orson Welles&#x27;s advice. Bogdanovich also used deep focus cinematography and extended takes in the film.

==Release==
The film was released on April 9, 1973 in Hollywood and May 9 in the United States.

===Home media===
The film released on VHS in 1980, re-released 1984, and re-released again in 1995. The LaserDisc released on 1982 and Director Series on May 7, 1995. The DVD released on August 12, 2003. The Criterion Collection released the film on 4K and Blu-ray on November 26, 2024.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
The film earned an estimated $13 million in North American theater rentals in 1973 (equivalent to $ million in ).

=== Critical response ===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised &quot;two first-class performances&quot; from Ryan and Tatum O&#x27;Neal but found the film &quot;oddly depressing&quot; and unable to &quot;make up its mind whether it wants to be an instant antique or a comment on one&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film his top four-star rating and commented that &quot;a genre movie about a con man and a little girl is teamed up with the real poverty and desperation of Kansas and Missouri, circa 1936. You wouldn&#x27;t think the two approaches would fit together, somehow, but, they do, and the movie comes off as more honest and affecting than if Bogdanovich had simply paid tribute to older styles&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that Tatum O&#x27;Neal &quot;is more than cute. Her role is something special in the well-established tradition of children on film.&quot;

Arthur D. Murphy in &quot;Variety&quot; called Tatum O&#x27;Neal &quot;outstanding&quot; and added, &quot;Alvin Sargent&#x27;s screenplay is a major contributor to the overall excellent results&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Tatum O&#x27;Neal was &quot;just plain marvelous and &quot;Paper Moon&quot; is a tough, funny, beautifully calculated diversion&quot;. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;may prove a keen disappointment if you go with high expectations. At its best the film is only mildly amusing, and I&#x27;m not sure I could come up with a few undeniable highlights if pressed on the point&quot;. Tom Milne in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called the film &quot;very easy to take, especially as Alvin Sargent&#x27;s dialogue has a nice edge of wit. The trouble is that the film covers all the ground it is going to cover in the scene in the restaurant near the beginning when we, with Ryan O&#x27;Neal, first realise that the sweetly awful child is going to be more than a match for him as far as wits are concerned&quot;.

 Metacritic assigned a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 based on eight critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==

At the Academy Awards, Tatum O&#x27;Neal won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, making her the youngest competitive Academy Award winner (at age 10).

==Other media==
In September 1974, a television series called &quot;Paper Moon&quot;, based on the film, premiered on the ABC television network, with Jodie Foster cast as Addie and Christopher Connelly (who had appeared as O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s brother in the earlier ABC series, &quot;Peyton Place&quot;) playing Moses. It was not a ratings success, and its thirteenth and last new episode aired in December 1974.

A stage musical adapted from the film and &quot;Addie Pray&quot; was produced at the Paper Mill Playhouse in 1993. The show featured a book by Martin Casella, music by Larry Grossman, and lyrics by Ellen Fitzhugh and Carol Hall, and was directed by Matt Casella. The cast included Gregory Harrison, Christine Ebersole, Brooks Ashmanskas, and Christopher Sieber.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Great Money Caper&quot;, Homer and Bart conduct a series of cons, initially to pay to repair the family car. Their attempt to con Ned Flanders by claiming delivery of a personalised Bible ordered by his late wife Maude and requesting reimbursement unravels when Ned realises the con&#x27;s similarity to that in the film &quot;Paper Moon&quot;, at which point Homer and Bart bolt.

==Legacy==
The head writer of the television series &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;, Joby Harold, looked at the films &quot;Paper Moon&quot; and &quot;Midnight Run&quot; as influences for Obi-Wan Kenobi and Leia Organa&#x27;s relationship after the latter&#x27;s rescue. Director David Fincher named &quot;Paper Moon&quot; as one of his favorite films and the film that had impact on his career.

<doc id="1055202" wikidata="Q3558201" url="?curid=1055202" title="Graves (wine region)">
<text>Graves (, &quot;gravelly land&quot;) is an important subregion of the Bordeaux wine region. Graves is situated on the left bank of the Garonne River, in the upstream part of the region, southeast of the city Bordeaux and stretches over . Graves is the only Bordeaux subregion famed for all three of Bordeaux&#x27;s three main wine types (reds, dry whites and sweet wines) although red wines dominate the total production. Graves AOC is also the name of one &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) that covers most but not all of the Graves subregion.

The area encompasses villages including Sauternes, Pessac, Talence, Léognan, Martillac, Saint-Morillon, and Portets.

The name &quot;Graves&quot; derives from its intensely gravelly soil. The soil is the result of glaciers from the Ice Age, which also left white quartz deposits that can still be found in the soil of some of the top winemaking estates.

== History ==
The Graves is considered the birthplace of claret. Its wine production for export dates back to Eleanor of Aquitaine, who married Henry II, King of England, creating a flourishing trade between both countries: wine versus coal and iron. In the Middle Ages, the wines that were first exported to England were produced in this area. At that time, the Médoc subregion, north of Bordeaux, still consisted of marshland unsuitable for viticulture though Graves were naturally better drained.

Château Pape Clément, which was founded at the turn of the 14th century by the future Pope Clement V, was the first named chateau in all of Bordeaux. In 1663, Samuel Pepys&#x27;s mention of Château Haut-Brion was the first recorded mention of French claret in London.

After Médoc was drained by the Dutch in mid-17th century, Médoc gradually took over the role as the source of the most prized Bordeaux wines. In the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, only one Graves property, Château Haut-Brion, one of the four original First Growths, was included among the red wines, with all the rest being Médoc properties. All the sweet wines of the 1855 classification were from Sauternes, which is a part of Graves.

A classification of Graves wine was carried out in 1953 for its red wine producers. Dry white wines were included in an updated 1959 classification. In 1987, the part of Graves containing most of the producers of its most expensive wines, closest to the city of Bordeaux itself, created a separate AOC under the name Pessac-Léognan. This has had the effect of devaluing the name and price of wines simply labeled with the Graves appellation.

== Wine styles ==

As with Médoc, Cabernet Sauvignon is the predominant grape, but a somewhat greater proportion of Merlot is typically used in the blend, with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. The dry white wines are a blend of Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon.

A well-known sweet white dessert wine is made in the commune of Sauternes, which is located in the southeast corner of the Graves region.

== Appellations in Graves ==
The Graves subregion contains the following &quot;Appellations d&#x27;origine contrôlées&quot; (AOCs).

=== Graves AOC ===
Graves AOC is the basic appellation of the Graves subregion, and can be used for both red and dry white wine. of vineyards were dedicated to this appellation in 2004.

=== Graves Supérieures AOC ===
Graves Supérieures AOC is an appellation for sweet white wine covering the same area as Graves AOC. The wines are generally considered as simpler than those of Cérons AOC. About of vineyards were dedicated to the production of Graves Supérieures in 2004.

=== Pessac-Léognan AOC ===
This part of the Graves, located just south of the city of Bordeaux, is home to the first growth estate Château Haut-Brion, as well as all the 1953 classified Graves Growths, including Château La Mission Haut-Brion and Château Laville Haut-Brion. In addition to wine production, the area is known for its crops of pine trees, and vineyards are often separated by rows of forest trees. The soil of Pessac-Léognan is composed of gravel terraces with sediments from different geological eras.

Pessac-Léognan received appellation status in 1987, and produces both red and white wines. All of the estates named in the 1959 Graves classification are located in this appellation. Cabernet Sauvignon is the dominant grape variety, followed by Merlot and the white wine grapes Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. The white wines of this area are barrel fermented and aged on their lees.

=== Sauternes AOC and Barsac AOC ===
Sauternes is an appellation of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as the &quot;Premier Cru Supérieur&quot; classified Château d&#x27;Yquem.

Wines produced in the commune of Barsac, such as &quot;Premiers Crus&quot; Château Climens and Château Coutet, are allowed to be labeled with the commune name (as Barsac AOC) or with Sauternes. The intense sweetness is the result of the grapes being affected by &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;, a fungus commonly known as noble rot. In the autumn, the Ciron river produces mist that descends upon the area and persists until after dawn. These conditions are conducive to the growth of the fungus, which desiccates the grape and concentrates the sugars inside. The three main grapes are of this are Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle.

Production costs for this area&#x27;s botrytized wines are comparatively high. The evaporation and fungus affections produces low yields, which are one fifth to one sixth of that in other Bordeaux regions. The berries are normally harvested individually from the bunch, with pickers going through the vineyards several times between September and November to ensure the berries are picked at their optimal points. The wine is then fermented in small oak barrels, further adding to the cost. Even with half bottles of the First Growths priced at several hundred dollars, these wines still have difficulties turning a profit, and in the mid 20th century, a string of bad vintages drove many growers in the region out of business.

=== Cérons AOC ===
Cérons AOC is an appellation for sweet white wines of similar style as Sauternes but with no producers as noted as the classified Sauternes properties and therefore with lower prices. On the other hand, the wines are considered superior to those of Graves Supérieures AOC of which Cérons effectively is an enclave.

<text>Matthew Jeffrey Collins (born 31 March 1986) is a Welsh footballer who plays for Hungerford Town. He has represented Wales at Under-17, Under-19 and Under-21 levels, and plays as a central midfielder and also as a right back.

==Career==
Born in Merthyr Tydfil, Collins started his career at Swindon Town but Jean Tigana and his Fulham scouts were impressed by him and he signed for the club in the summer of 2001 for a fee in excess of £250,000. Two years later, Collins signed his first professional contract with the club. During a pre season tour to Germany in the 2005–06 season, Collins sustained a hamstring injury, this was a start of a nightmare season as he had recurring hamstring tears which kept him out for an 18-month period. He did not break into the first team at Fulham and signed for League One side Swansea City on a free transfer in May 2007 on a two-year deal. In his first season, he was part of the squad that gained promotion to the Championship winning the League One Title. He joined League Two side Wrexham on a one-month loan deal in November 2007. He made his debut against Shrewsbury Town, playing a full 90 minutes. He returned to Swansea after playing four times for the Dragons. Following an impressive pre-season Roberto Martínez started Collins in Swansea&#x27;s first Championship match of the 2008–2009 campaign and the following two matches. Collins was rewarded for his good performances by John Toshack as the Welsh manager put the 22-year-old on the bench for the international friendly against Georgia. On 11 August 2010, Collins left Swansea City by mutual consent in a search for regular football.

After leaving Swansea, Collins joined Welsh Premier League side Haverfordwest County. He was only with the Pembrokeshire outfit for 6 months and Collins was transferred to big spending Neath to join up with former Swansea colleagues Lee Trundle and Kristian O&#x27;Leary. In his first season at Neath he was part of the side that won the Welsh Premier League play-off final. Collins went on to play in the UEFA Europa League against top flight Swedish side Aalesunds FK, however Neath were unsuccessful progressing to the next stage of the competition.

In June 2012 he joined Aberystwyth Town following the liquidation of Neath. Since joining Aberystwyth Collins has scored 5 goals in 13 games.

<text>Rock Creek is a tributary of the Potomac River, in the United States, that empties into the Atlantic Ocean via the Chesapeake Bay. The creek drains about . Its final quarter-mile (400 m) is affected by tides.

==Geography==

=== Course ===

The creek rises from a culvert under Dorsey Road at the north edge of Laytonsville Golf Course in Montgomery County, Maryland. A dam forms a small lake near its source. After exiting the golf course, Rock Creek flows between residential developments until it meets Agricultural History Farm Park, where the Upper Rock Creek Trail starts. It flows underneath the Intercounty Connector, which crosses it on a large arch bridge visible from the trail.

It then flows into Lake Needwood at Rock Creek Regional Park in Maryland&#x27;s Derwood–Rockville area. South of the Lake Needwood Dam, Rock Creek flows in a deep gorge and is paralleled by the main Rock Creek Trail, and is joined by the North Branch Rock Creek. It exits the gorge near the Twinbrook neighborhood of Rockville and the Parklawn Memorial Cemetery.

At North Kensington, Beach Drive begins to parallel the creek. The creek eventually crosses the Capital Beltway and later reaches the Washington, D.C., border.

The creek flows for about through Rock Creek Park in Washington, where it is fed by several small creeks (Piney Branch, Pinehurst Branch, Broad Branch, Soapstone Branch, and Luzon Branch) and numerous storm sewers.

The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal joins Rock Creek in Georgetown; the creek&#x27;s mouth is the canal&#x27;s eastern terminus. Just below this confluence, the Canal Company in 1831 completed a mole, causeway, and waste weir. This area, which the company dubbed &quot;Rock Creek Basin&quot;, silted up and was dredged several times for the Canal&#x27;s use. The creek (and the canal) empty into the Potomac River at the Tidewater Lock near the Watergate complex.

=== Watershed ===
The Maryland portion of the watershed comprises the second-largest watershed in Montgomery County, about . About 21 percent of the creek&#x27;s watershed is in Washington. Total land usage in the watershed is of wetlands or water, of residential and commercial areas, of forest or grasslands, and of agricultural areas. The creek has a fairly steep gradient, with rapid changes in elevation. The man-made Lake Needwood is located on the creek, north of Rockville.

The conditions of Rock Creek are monitored by the United States Geological Survey.

==Water quality and restoration==

In Maryland, most of the northern Rock Creek watershed has good to excellent water quality, according to studies conducted by the county government. In 2004, to preserve water quality in partially developed areas, the county imposed restrictions on development (i.e., designation of &quot;Special Protection Areas&quot;) in parts of this sub-watershed. The southern portion of the Maryland watershed is highly urbanized. Most of this portion of the creek and its tributaries have poor water quality. As of 2018, the county has completed several stream restoration projects throughout the watershed, and has additional projects planned or under construction.

The D.C. segment of Rock Creek also has poor water quality. In addition to typical urban stormwater pollution problems such as runoff from streets and other impervious surfaces, the creek has high bacteria levels due to leaking sewer pipes and combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The D.C. government, which has a stormwater discharge permit from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, is improving its stormwater management to raise water quality in Rock Creek. In 2009, the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority began a planned two-year effort to replace portions of the combined sewer with separate storm sewers, and so eliminate CSO-related problems in the creek.

As of 2021, the bacteria levels in the creek remained dangerously high due to the leaking sewer pipes, even during dry weather, and the public has been warned not to wade into the creek.

Fish species observed in Rock Creek and its tributaries include eastern blacknose dace, bluntnose minnow, yellow bullhead, satinfin shiner, swallowtail shiner, longnose dace, and American eel.

===Restoration projects===

In 2006, the National Park Service finished a project to remove or bypass eight fish barriers in the creek by adding a fish ladder to bypass the 1905 Peirce Mill Dam, modifying historic fords, and removing abandoned sewage lines and fords. The effort was designed to restore American shad, river herring, and other migratory fish to the creek and their historic upriver spawning grounds. An estimated two million fish migrate up the creek each year.

The D.C. government completed a restoration project on the Milkhouse Run and Bingham Run tributaries in 2013. As of 2014, ongoing restoration projects in the watershed include the Broad Branch and Klingle Run tributaries.

<text>Jeremiah Alfred LeConey (November 3, 1901 – November 11, 1959) was an American athlete, winner of the gold medal in the 4x100 meter relay race at the 1924 Summer Olympics.

LeConey was raised in Moorestown, New Jersey, where he first started showing his ability as a sprinter at Moorestown High School. In 1922, LeConey won the AAU championships in the 220 yard race and, as a Lafayette College (Class of 1923) student, the IC4A championships in both the 100 and 220 yard races.

At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Al LeConey ran the anchor leg for the American 4x100 meter relay team which won the gold medal with a world record time of 41.0 seconds.

After the Olympics, LeConey covered the 100 yard distance in 9.4 seconds, but the effort was later disallowed when judges ruled that the time was wind-aided. In 1932, LeConey received an unusual honor when a picture of him at the 1924 Olympics was used by the U.S. Post Office in developing a commemorative stamp.

<doc id="1055229" wikidata="Q40107" url="?curid=1055229" title="Omar Ali Saifuddin II">
<text>Omar Ali Saifuddin II (died 18 November 1852) was the 23rd Sultan of Brunei. During his reign, Western powers such as the United Kingdom and the United States visited the country. His reign saw the British adventurer James Brooke becoming the White Rajah of Sarawak.

==Early life==
When his father, Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam I, died in 1804, he was still a minor followed by a physical deformity of an extra thumb on his right hand. Therefore, his grandfather, Paduka Seri Bega&#x27;wan Muhammad Tajuddin ascended the throne for the second time. Due to the advanced age of Sultan Muhammad Tajuddin, his younger brother, &quot;Pengiran Di-Gadong&quot; Pengiran Muda Muhammad Kanzul Alam acted as regent. When Muhammad Tajuddin died in 1807, the regent became the sultan of Brunei and was known as Sultan Muhammad Kanzul Alam. Kanzul Alam then appointed his own son, Pengiran Muda Muhammad Alam as heir to the throne of Brunei.

In 1825, when Pengiran Muda Omar Ali Saifuddin had come of age, he asserted his claim to the throne. Pengiran Muda Omar Ali Saifuddin was supported by most nobles as he was the rightful heir according to Brunei&#x27;s royal traditions. The Kris Si Naga was in the possession of his mother, thus strengthened his claim. To end the succession crisis, Muhammad Alam stepped down from the throne and was sentenced to death. In 1828, Pengiran Muda Omar Ali Saifuddin ascended the throne as the 23rd Sultan of Brunei, taking the title Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II.

==Reign==

=== Accession and struggle for Kuching ===
After his succession to the throne, he appointed his uncle Pengiran Muda Hashim as the Bendahara (Prime Minister) as a sign of compassion to heal their family relations after the Second Civil War. Pengiran Bendahara Pengiran Muda Hashim was also the late Sultan Muhammad Alam and Queen Noralam&#x27;s brother.

During Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II&#x27;s reign, he tried to establish absolute control over the economic importance of Kuching. Before this, only the Pengirans who acted on behalf of the Sultan, were in charge of collecting taxes and revenues from the local people. Especially after the discovery of antimony ore in Kuching, the Sultan became more ambitious in gaining control of Kuching&#x27;s economy. The Governor of Sarawak at that time, Pengiran Indera Mahkota, also used forced labour to run the antimony mines. A disturbance occurred in Sarawak where an uprising against Brunei rule led by Datu Patinggi Ali, who was one of the ruling chiefs in Kuching. Due to the worsened situation in Sarawak, Pengiran Muda Hashim was ordered to restore order in the area.

=== Pengiran Muda Hashim and James Brooke ===
At the time of chaotic situation in Kuching, a British explorer, James Brooke, came on his schooner &quot;Royalist&quot; looking for trade opportunities in 1839. Brooke came to Kuching from Singapore as he had heard about Kuching&#x27;s economic potentials. Also, at this time, Brooke met Pengiran Muda Hashim, who was the uncle of Omar Ali Saifuddin, and the two became close friends. Pengiran Muda Hashim asked for Brooke&#x27;s assistance to help him to suppress the disturbances in Kuching, in return, Pengiran Muda Hashim ensured the appointment of Brooke as the new Governor, after the Governor Raja Pengiran Indera Mahkota had been deposed.

Muda Hashim later appointed James as the temporary governor in 1841 and in 1842, he sailed to Brunei to be given the title of Tuan Besar (Great Lord) and again appointed as the representative in charge of affairs in Old Sarawak by the Sultan. After the disturbances in Sarawak successfully quelled, Brooke met Pengiran Muda Hashim in Kuching to ensure his promises were kept. Pengiran Muda Hashim agreed to honour his promise. In 1842, Omar Ali Saifuddin reluctantly confirmed the appointment of James Brooke as the Governor of Sarawak in a treaty. The treaty officially recognised James Brooke as the Raja of Sarawak and the Sultan had to cede Kuching to James Brooke. 

For a yearly payment of $2,500, Brooke obtained the rich in antimony region of Sarawak in July 1842. This meant that Brooke seized control of half of Brunei during this period. Following Sarawak&#x27;s formal transfer to him in 1847 from Omar Ali Saifuddin, Brooke extended its boundaries (from one location to another), typically at Brunei&#x27;s cost. The cession of Kuching to Brooke marked the beginning of further cessation of territories to the Brooke family and later, the British North Borneo Company (BNBC).

The rapid loss of Brunei&#x27;s territories caused severe economic weakness. Because of Britain&#x27;s colonial policies, which limited Britain&#x27;s intervention, Brooke was able to extend its territory and cause Brunei to lose its land. Since Britain could exert indirect authority over new territories that were strategically and financially significant to them, they did not object at this time to private initiatives by British residents or trade corporations under their sponsorship to own towns in Northern Borneo.

=== Treaty of Labuan and death ===
In October 1843, the Sultan offered the island of Labuan to Britain. Notably on 6 April 1845, the relations between Brunei and the United States first began when the warship USS &quot;Constitution&quot; visited and anchored off Brunei Bay. In July 1846, James Brooke and Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane together began a naval attack on Brunei Town and depose the Sultan. The Sultan reluctantly pledged loyalty towards Queen Victoria after he was reinstated.

That same year on 18 December, Omar Ali Saifuddin was forced to cede Labuan to the British Government under the Treaty of Labuan after threats of attack made by the Royal Navy. In 1847, the Sultan signed the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with Britain which provide them with full control over Brunei&#x27;s trade, and on 23 June 1850, he signed the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with the United States.

Due to significant foreign pressure on him, towards the end on his life, Omar Ali Saifuddin&#x27;s health began rapidly deteriorating. He chose to distance himself from ruling the state but he never abdicated the throne. At the moment, his son-in-law Abdul Momin was appointed a regent. Omar Ali Saifuddin II died in 1852 and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Sultan Abdul Momin as the 24th Sultan of Brunei. Abdul Momin&#x27;s succession was regarded as a temporary fill-in on the throne before &quot;Temenggong&quot; Hashim, the son of the late Sultan would succeed to the throne in 1885. He was buried at the Royal Mausoleum, Bandar Seri Begawan.

== Legacy ==
=== Reputation ===
By all accounts, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II was an unimpressive figure with a second thumb on his right hand and a dull mind. He owed his position to the ambition and political savvy of his mother rather than to any personal talents. He is sometimes referred to as a fool by Western observers, but it&#x27;s more likely that he was simply not particularly intelligent, making him a target of plots and a tool of his advisers, whoever they happened to be at the moment. He was never officially installed as the Sultan of Brunei and hence remained a sort of &quot;acting sultan&quot; due to his weakness and the persistence of the disagreements among Brunei&#x27;s governing class. The solemnization of other ranking posts was also limited. Because the nominal leadership lacked the moral and traditional power conferred by the ceremonies involved with the complete coronation and installation, the overall impact was to weaken the government of Brunei.

<text>Bathtub racing is a competition that involves the use of bathtub boats, small powered watercraft designed around bathtubs or close facsimiles.

==Boat design==
Early boats were whimsical and crafted from a variety of materials. Today, most racing bathtub boats are monohull planer types with outboard motors. A form resembling a roll-top tub must be an integral part of the structure. Most tubbers make their &quot;tub&quot; by using a bathtub as the model to lay down a fiberglass mold. 

The rules restrict the engine to 9.9 hp (7.3
 kW), and the weight to a minimum of 350 lb (159 kg) including driver. 
There are three classes of bathtub boats: Stock, Modified, and Super-Modified. 
Stock motors must be an unmodified stock engine, but can be tuned by adjusting the timing. Modified motors can only modify the lower leg and propeller. Super Modified can modify the entire engine as long as factory parts are used.

==History==
Bathtub racing started in Nanaimo, British Columbia. The idea was conceived to showcase Nanaimo to the world, with the first races beginning with the &quot;Nanaimo to Vancouver Great International World Championship Bathtub Race&quot; in 1967.

Frank Ney, Nanaimo&#x27;s mayor at the time, was one of the largest supporters and promoters of the annual race from its establishment until his death in 1992, and was an avid participant. He would regularly dress as a pirate and tour the town and surrounding communities.

Until the 1990s, the race was held as a part of Vancouver&#x27;s annual Sea Festival, aka Sea Fest, when tubbers raced from Nanaimo to Vancouver&#x27;s Kitsilano Beach. With the demise of the Vancouver Marine Festival in the mid-1990s, the race now involves a course beginning and ending in Nanaimo Harbour. 

The current course takes the tubbers into the open waters of Georgia Strait and is currently 58 kilometres in length. The race is held the last weekend of July every year.

Other cities, like Auckland&#x27;s North Shore with its Englefield Bathtub Derby, and Bremerton, Washington with the US-Canadian Friendship race now hold bathtub races, but the Nanaimo event continues to be the most widely known.

<doc id="1055255" wikidata="Q677971" url="?curid=1055255" title="Altazimuth mount">
<text>An altazimuth mount or alt-azimuth mount is a simple two-axis mount for supporting and rotating an instrument about two perpendicular axes – one vertical and the other horizontal. Rotation about the vertical axis varies the azimuth (compass bearing) of the pointing direction of the instrument. Rotation about the horizontal axis varies the altitude angle (angle of elevation) of the pointing direction.

These mounts are used, for example, with telescopes, cameras, radio antennas, heliostat mirrors, solar panels, and guns and similar weapons.

Several names are given to this kind of mount, including altitude-azimuth, azimuth-elevation and various abbreviations thereof. A gun turret is essentially an alt-azimuth mount for a gun, and a standard camera tripod is an alt-azimuth mount as well.

==Astronomical telescope altazimuth mounts==
When used as an astronomical telescope mount, the biggest advantage of an alt-azimuth mount is the simplicity of its mechanical design. The primary disadvantage is its inability to follow astronomical objects in the night sky as the Earth spins on its axis. On the other hand, an equatorial mount only needs to be rotated about a single axis, at a constant rate, to follow the rotation of the night sky (diurnal motion). Altazimuth mounts need to be rotated about both axes at variable rates, achieved via microprocessor based two-axis drive systems, to track equatorial motion. This imparts an uneven rotation to the field of view that also has to be corrected via a microprocessor based counter rotation system. On smaller telescopes an equatorial platform is sometimes used to add a third &quot;polar axis&quot; to overcome these problems, providing an hour or more of motion in the direction of right ascension to allow for astronomical tracking. The design also does not allow for the use of mechanical setting circles to locate astronomical objects although modern digital setting circles have removed this shortcoming.

Another limitation is the problem of gimbal lock at zenith pointing. When tracking at elevations close to 90°, the azimuth axis must rotate very quickly; if the altitude is exactly 90°, the speed is infinite. Thus, altazimuth telescopes, although they can point in any direction, cannot track smoothly within a &quot;zenith blind spot&quot;, commonly 0.5 or 0.75 degrees from the zenith. (i.e. at elevations greater than 89.5° or 89.25° respectively.)

===Current applications===
Typical current applications of altazimuth mounts include the following.

====Research telescopes====
In the largest telescopes, the mass and cost of an equatorial mount is prohibitive and they have been superseded by computer-controlled altazimuth mounts. The simple structure of an altazimuth mount allows significant cost reductions, in spite of the additional cost associated with the more complex tracking and image-orienting mechanisms. An altazimuth mount also reduces the cost in the dome structure covering the telescope since the simplified motion of the telescope means the structure can be more compact.

====Amateur telescopes====
* Beginner telescopes: Altazimuth mounts are cheap and simple to use.
* Dobsonian telescopes: John Dobson popularized a simplified altazimuth mount design for Newtonian reflectors because of its ease of construction; Dobson&#x27;s innovation was to use non-machined parts for the mount that could be found in any hardware store such as plywood, formica, and plastic plumbing parts combined with modern materials like nylon or teflon.
* &quot;GoTo&quot; telescopes: It has often proved more convenient to build a mechanically simpler altazimuth mount and use a motion controller to manipulate both axes simultaneously to track an object, when compared with a more mechanically complex equatorial mount that requires minimally complex control of a single motor.

<text>Frank Clifford Wykoff (October 29, 1909 – January 1, 1980) was an American athlete, a triple gold medal winner in 4 × 100 m relay at the Olympic Games.

==Career==

Born in Des Moines, Iowa, Frank Wykoff has a place in track and field history by being the first man to ever win three Olympic relay gold medals, all in world record time.

Wykoff made his debut at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, where he finished fourth in the 100 m and ran an opening leg in the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which equaled the world record of 41.0 seconds in the final.

After the Olympics, in 1929, Wykoff enrolled at Glendale Community College. He enrolled for one year to be able to train one more season with his Glendale High School coach, Normal Hayhurst. He was close to death the previous fall with a severe throat infection but recovered enough in the spring to tie the world record four times as a sprinter for Glendale. He then transferred to the University of Southern California where he came under the tutelage of the famous coach Dean Cromwell. He won the AAU championships in 100 yd in 1928 and 1931 and the NCAA championships in 100 yd in 1930 and 1931. He ran a new world record in 100 yd of 9.4 s in May, 1930 and repeated it a month later. In 1931, as an anchor of the University of Southern California 4 × 100 m relay team, he helped set a new world record of 40.8. While at USC, Wykoff became a member of the Kappa Alpha Order national fraternity.
At the 1932 Summer Olympics, Wykoff ran the anchor leg for the American relay team, which set a new world record of 40.0 seconds. At the 1936 Summer Olympics he again finished fourth in 100 m and again anchored the American 4 × 100 m relay team to gold with a new world record of 39.8.

Following his graduation from USC in 1932 Wykoff earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1936 and became a teacher and administrator. Wykoff worked for the Los Angeles County school system until retiring in 1972. He died in Altadena, California, aged 70.

A slogan of Wykoff&#x27;s, &quot;Clean Speech, Clean Sport, Clean Scholarship, Clean Life&quot;, was adopted by the YMCA in 1938.

His medals can be viewed by contacting the LA84 Foundation in Los Angeles, California.

<text>Ammonium sulfate precipitation is one of the most commonly used methods for large and laboratory scale protein purification and fractionation that can be used to separate proteins by altering their solubility in the presence of a high salt concentration.

== Properties ==

Ammonium sulfate is an inorganic salt with a high solubility that disassociates into ammonium () and sulfate () in aqueous solutions. Ammonium sulfate is especially useful as a precipitant because it is highly soluble, stabilizes protein structure, has a relatively low density, is readily available, and is relatively inexpensive.

== Mechanism ==

Ammonium sulfate, as well as other neutral salts, will stabilize proteins by preferential solvation. Proteins are usually stored in ammonium sulfate because it inhibits bacterial growth. With the addition of ammonium sulfate, proteins unfolded by denaturants can be pushed into their native conformations. This can be seen with the folding of recombinant proteins.

The solubility of proteins varies according to the ionic strength of the solution, thus according to the salt concentration. At low ion concentrations (less than 0.5 mol/L), the solubility of proteins increases with increasing salt concentration, an effect termed &quot;salting in&quot;. As the salt concentration is further increased, the solubility of the protein begins to decrease. At a sufficiently high ionic strength, the protein will precipitate out of the solution, an effect termed &quot;salting out&quot;. When the ammonium () and sulfate () ions are within the aqueous solution they are attracted to the opposite charges evident on the compound that is being purified. This attraction of opposite charges prevents the water molecules from interacting with the compound being purified, leading to the precipitation or &quot;salting out&quot;.

Proteins differ markedly in their solubilities at high ionic strength, therefore, &quot;salting out&quot; is a very useful procedure to assist in the purification of the desired protein. Ammonium sulfate is commonly used for precipitation because of its high solubility, additionally, it forms two ions high in the Hofmeister series. Because these two ions are at the end of Hofmeister series, ammonium sulfate can also stabilize a protein structure. The ammonium sulfate solubility behavior for a protein is usually expressed as a function of the percentage of saturation. A solubility curve can be determined by plotting the log of the experimentally determined solubility, expressed as mg/mL, versus the percentage saturation of ammonium sulfate.

With the mechanism of salting-out, there is an omission of the salt from the layer of water, which is closely associated with the surface of the protein, known as the hydration layer. The hydration layer plays a vital role in sustaining solubility and suitable natural conformation. There are three main protein-water interaction: ion hydration between charged side chains, hydrogen bonding between polar groups and water, and hydrophobic hydration. Once salt is added to the mixture, there is an increase in the surface tension of the water, thus increasing hydrophobic interactions between water and the protein of interest. The protein of interest then reduces its surface area, which diminishes its contact with the solvent. This is shown by the folding and self-association, which ultimately leads to precipitation. The folding and self-association of the protein pushes out free water, leading to an increase in entropy and making this process energetically favorable.

== Procedure ==

Typically, the ammonium sulfate concentration is increased stepwise, and the precipitated protein is recovered at each stage. This is usually done by adding solid ammonium sulfate; however, calculating the amount of ammonium sulfate that should be added to add to a solution to achieve the desired concentration may be difficult because the addition of ammonium sulfate significantly increases the volume of the solution. The amount of ammonium sulfate that should be added to the solution can be determined from published nomograms or by using an online calculator. The direct addition of solid ammonium sulfate does change the pH of the solution, which can lead to loss of enzyme activity. In those cases, the addition of saturated ammonium sulfate in a suitable buffer is used as an alternative to adding solid ammonium sulfate. In either approach, the resulting protein precipitate can be dissolved individually in a standard buffer and assayed to determine the total protein content.

The ammonium sulfate concentration added should be increased to a value that will precipitate most of the protein of interest whilst leaving the maximum amount of protein contaminants still in the solution. The precipitated protein of interest can subsequently be recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in standard buffer to prepare the sample for the next stage of purification.

In the next stage of purification, all this added salt needs to be removed from the protein. One way to do so is using dialysis, but dialysis further dilutes the concentrated protein. The better way of removing ammonium sulfate from the protein is mixing the precipitate protein in a buffer containing a mixture of SDS, Tris-HCl, and phenol and centrifuging the mixture. The precipitate that comes out of this centrifugation will contain salt-less concentrated protein.

== Applications ==

Ammonium sulfate precipitation is a useful technique as an initial step in protein purification because it enables quick, bulk precipitation of cellular proteins. It is also often employed during the later stages of purification to concentrate protein from dilute solution following procedures such as gel filtration. The drawback of this method is that oftentimes different substances can precipitate along with the protein, and other purification techniques must be performed, such as ion chromatography or size-exclusion chromatography.
