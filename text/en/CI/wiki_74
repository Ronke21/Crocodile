<text>RTML is a proprietary programming language used exclusively by Yahoo!&#x27;s Yahoo! Store and Yahoo! Site web hosting services.

==History==
The language originated at Viaweb, a company founded in 1995 by Paul Graham and Robert T. Morris, as the template language for their e-commerce platform. RTML stands for &quot;Robert T. Morris Language&quot;. The RTML editor was offered as an option for customers (usually small businesses) who wanted to customize their online stores more than the built-in templates allowed. The built-in templates were also written in RTML, and provided the starting point for most people who used the language.

In 1998, Yahoo! bought Viaweb for $49.6 million and renamed the service Yahoo! Store. Yahoo! later offered the RTML-based content management system in a hosting platform without a shopping cart, under the name Yahoo! Site.

In 2003, Yahoo! renamed the Yahoo! Store service Yahoo! Merchant Solutions (part of Yahoo! Small Business), and at the same time began offering new customers the choice of a more standard PHP/MySQL web hosting environment instead of the RTML-based Store Editor. , many new Yahoo! Merchant Solutions sites and legacy Yahoo! Stores continue to be built using the Store Editor and RTML. 

==Language==
Although Yahoo!&#x27;s documentation does not mention it, RTML is actually implemented on top of a Lisp-based system. The language is somewhat unusual in that the programmer cannot edit the source code directly as text. Instead, keywords are presented as hyperlinks in a browser-based HTML interface. Clicking on a keyword selects it, and its attributes can be edited. Blocks of code can be pushed and popped from a clipboard, using the stack metaphor. The editor maintains the code&#x27;s s-expression structure automatically, and visually represents it in the web interface using indentation instead of Lisp&#x27;s parentheses.
Most of the keywords correspond to HTML elements, but there are also conditionals, recursion, and other control flow features that make it a &quot;real&quot; programming language.

RTML templates are evaluated dynamically for each pageview during editing, but for the live site a &quot;publish&quot; process generates static HTML files from them.

==Abbreviation==
Yahoo!&#x27;s documentation used to say that RTML was an acronym for &quot;Real Time Markup Language&quot;, but Graham admitted that &quot;we made up various explanations for what RTML was supposed to stand for, but actually I named it after Robert Morris, the other founder of Viaweb, whose username is rtm.&quot;

<doc id="1069563" wikidata="Q890651" url="?curid=1069563" title="Lake Bogoria">
<text>Lake Bogoria (formerly Lake Hannington) is a saline, alkaline lake that lies in a volcanic region in a half-graben basin south of Lake Baringo, Kenya, a little north of the equator. Lake Bogoria, like Lake Nakuru, Lake Elementeita, and Lake Magadi further south in the Rift Valley, and Lake Logipi to the north, is periodically home to one of the world&#x27;s largest populations of lesser flamingos. The lake is a Ramsar site and Lake Bogoria National Reserve has been a protected National Reserve since November 29, 1973.

== History ==
The lake was formerly named after Bishop James Hannington who visited in 1885.

== Description ==

Lake Bogoria is located in Baringo County, about 120 km north of Nakuru city and 240 km north of Nairobi. It is in the Gregorian Rift Valley.

It was once part of a larger freshwater lake, joined with the current Lake Baringo.

As shown on the satellite picture at the top of this page, it is divided in three lobes: a large center one and two smaller ones at the north and south extremities. The two narrower areas separating these lobes are shallow, tectonically controlled sills at Nyalibuch and Mwanassis.

There are contradictions regarding its altitude. Unesco&#x27;s Ramsar gives . More precise — and more prudent —, give &quot;c.&quot; 990 m as of August 1977, but also indicate that the lake&#x27;s level fluctuates seasonally by 50 to 100 cm; and that it can vary by several meters for short periods, having fluctuated between c. 988 and c. 996 m during the 20th century. Lake-shore terraces around the shoreline, made of coarse angular gravel and angular orthoconglomerates, mark higher lake levels from the Pleistocene and Holocene. They are visible on 45% of the present level, and some are about 9 m above the present shoreline.

In 1991 the maximum length is and its width ranges from to .

The drainage basin is . The lowest point of the drainage divide is at 999 m near Loboi village; when the level of the lake reaches that altitude, its waters flow northward in lake Baringo drainage basin.

In 1978 its maximum depth was recorded as or , and precise that this was in the largest sub-basin or lobe; and that the two smaller parts at the north and south extremities were deep at that time.
In 2003 its maximum depth is just over in an area of . This is relatively shallow, but nevertheless deeper — and therefore hydrologically more stable — than the other endorheic lakes in Kenya. 
The Rift Valley lakes undergo regular (and cyclic) changes in water levels mostly in response to precipitation, which is unreliable and unpredictable.
In this region, lake Bogoria is the only alkaline lake that has minimal lake water fluctuations, and is used as a refuge for flamigos and other animals when other relatively shallow lakes dry out.

Its surface is generally but this fluctuates, essentially according to the amount of rainfall. Most of the rain falls between April and November, and precipitation ranges average about 700 mm on the Loboi plain and 1200 mm on the adjacent highlands. But El Nino years bring increased rainfall and flooding of the lake shores. For example, in 2020 its area increased to about : 2020 was one of the hottest years on record, but despite depressed rainfall in the short-rains season (October to December, or OND) it also saw a wetter than normal January and February because of the strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole index during that period, and enhanced rainfall during the long-rains season (March to May, or MAM) (that year, Lake Victoria rose to a new record level).

However, evaporation rate is above 2500 mm, thus inducing a water deficit and creating semi-arid conditions over most of the lower parts of the Bogoria basin.

=== Wetlands ===

Although the lake is in a semi-arid part of Kenya Rift Valley, it is surrounded by numerous and varied wetlands along its shorelines, along faults where hot, warm and cold springs have developed, and along rivers that run across the rift floor.

==== Types of wetlands ====

Six major types of wetland have been defined around lake Bogoria:
* proximal hot springs, with small streamlets, exposed ground (carbonate and/or siliciclastics), high water temperatures over 40 ◦C that reach up to 99 ◦C at vents, and microbial mats of bacteria and less common diatoms; These are associated with:
** hot spring marshes, found downstream of the proximal hot springs and adjacent to spring streamlets, and dominated by thick clusters of short reeds, mainly &quot;Cyperus laevigatus&quot;, that stand through a water layer 2 cm high or less and with temperatures ranging between 30–40 ◦C; 
* artesian blister wetlands associated with cool springs (30–33 ◦C). The circular blister mounds are about 15 m diameter and 1 to 2 m high. They are formed by cool artesian springs that emerge at the surface, creating a sort of water blister of about 1m3. They are capped with an arched semi-permeable cover of short graminoids (mostly less than 10 cm high) such as &quot;Cyperus laevigatus&quot;, &quot;Pycreus mundtii&quot; and &quot;Leersia hexandra&quot;. The edges of these &#x27;blister mounds&#x27; are dominated by Leersia hexandra mixed with other grasses and sedges. Further around are some &quot;Sporobolus spicatus&quot;, and downslope of these mounds and of other water seeps are often found small patches of &quot;Typha&quot; and wet meadows plants. 
the graminoid vegetation is interspersed with cyanobacterial and algal mats. Water from the blister mounds, and other seeps and springs, support wet meadows and &quot;Typha&quot; swamps. The blister mounds and Typha swamps have a more or less neutral pH, low conductivities and total alkalinity.
* &quot;Typha&quot; and &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot; swamps, fed by a mix of surface streams, groundwater seeps or warm springs (25 °C to 30◦C). Where water is shallow and ephemeral, these are dominated by tall &quot;Typha domingensis&quot; (2 m tall or taller); where water is permanent — usually in broad depressions —, the dominant vegetation is floating &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot;; 
* floodplain marshes, with seasonal flooding and populated by short grasses; 
* hypersaline lake littoral wetlands, found on the lake shores: they are flooded (by more than 10 cm of water), gently sloping, siliciclastic delta margins, often modified by flamingo nesting. Their pH is around 10, with an alkalinity &quot;ca.&quot; 1000 meq l−1. Hot springs may also feed into some of these sites. There are no macrophytes and few diatoms: cyanobacteria dominate (mainly &quot;Spirulina platensis&quot;); 
* freshwater lake littoral wetlands, forming narrow to extensive fringes around the relatively fresh water Lake Baringo (pH ~8.9, alkalinity &quot;ca.&quot; 13 meq l−1), dominated by a variety of wetland vegetation.

==== Wetlands areas ====

The marshes to the north of the lake do not feed any river outlet. They are linked to both Lake Bogoria and adjacent Lake Baringo; both lakes are fed by the Waseges river (or Sandai river), the latter bringing a small permanent flow of the diverted Loboi river. These wetlands are fed by ephemeral or perennial streams, and by springs. &lt;br&gt;
In the south, two freshwater springs supply permanent streams. All three (the Wasenge river and the two streams) are used extrensively for drinking, as well as the water from some hot springs streams — some of these being substantially less salty than the lake water. Other streams, such as the Emsos to the south and the Parkirichai to the west, are ephemeral: they flow only after heavy rains.

; The Loboi Swamp

This swamp is to the north of the lake. It hugs the base of a horst block (raised fault block bounded by normal faults) oriented north-south. According to radiocarbon datation, it was created only 700 years ago in a former floodplain environment — possibly as a consequence of faulting. In 1969, it spread over 6 km in length; but water was diverted from the Waseges river and by 2001 it was only 3.5 km long and about 0.5 km wide. At least three warm springs, and groundwater inputs, feed it. The Loboi river also contributes to it but that river periodically shifts its bed (avulsions) and that modifies its relative role regarding the swamp. This river is cool and only slightly alkaline. The springs have a similar chemistry but they are warmer, have a higher nitrate content, and are slightly acidic. The resulting waters of the Loboi Swamp are also slightly alkaline, and generally reflect the mixing of fluvial, spring and groundwater inflows. &lt;br&gt;
Its areas of semi-permanent or seasonal standing water are dominated by &quot;Typha domingensis&quot; and also have some &quot;Leersia hexandra&quot;, &quot;Ipomoea aquatica&quot;, and other taxa. These areas surround a wetter area populated by near pure stands of &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot; that are rooted or floating in water up to 1.5 m deep. Acacia scrub occurs on an adjacent horst block to the west, with grasses such as &quot;Sporobolus spicata&quot; on adjacent plains.

; The Kesubo floodplain marshes

These are also to the north of the lake, east of the Loboi swamp. They rest at the southern end of an extensive alluvial fan formed by the Sandai river. The Kesubo Floodplain Marshes are seasonally flooded and lie between the rift valley boundary faults, to the east, and a small horst block, to the west. The river waters are slightly alkaline, cool, and have a low total alkalinity. The marshes are similar in their general water chemistry, but are slightly acidic and have a distinctly lower NO3 content. Short grasses are the dominant vegetation type and cattle graze the area.

; The Campground Wetlands

These lie near the Lake Bogoria National Reserve entrance, to the south of the Loboi swamp, and at the limit dividing faulted volcanic uplands and colluvial-alluvial sediments. They contain several types of habitats. defined them as an &#x27;Artesian Blister Wetland&#x27; (see Types of wetlands above), and that wetland also includes slightly acidic, nitrate enriched, warm springs. 

; The Loburu Delta

This is on the western shore of Lake Bogoria. It is composed of silts and gravels, and shows a variety of fluvial, deltaic, and beach settings. It has active hot springs that feed a series of marshes dominated by &quot;Cyperus laevigatus&quot;. The springs are alkaline, of the Na-HCO3 type, contain a lot of silica and nitrate, and the temperature near the vents is extremely hot (more than 96◦C). The areas immediately adjacent to the vents and in nearby streamlets commonly include microbial mats of Phormidium, Pseudanabaena, Spirulina, &quot;Synechococcus&quot; and &quot;Calothrix&quot;, but are devoid of macrophytes. &lt;br&gt;
the Cyperus marshes, which have similar water chemistries, are dominated by short reeds less than 20 cm high. Temperatures range from about 32◦C to about 60◦C near the hot spring streamlets that cross the marshes. There are also algal and cyanobacterial mats. The lake shoreline at Loburu (and other shorelines) does not present many aquatic macrophytes. The lake brine is of Na-CO3-HCO3-Cl composition, with a pH range of 9.3–10.6. Some shallow marginal lagoons have salinities exceeding 100 g l−1. Temperature at the time of sampling ranged between 28 and 33 ◦C, but exceed 60 ◦C at sublacustrine hot spring vents. However, cyanobacteria — mainly &quot;Spirulina platensis&quot; — are abundant and support up to 2 million flamingoes.

=== Geysers and hot springs ===

Lake Bogoria is in a geothermally active part of the Kenya Rift Valley, 
and is famous for geysers and hot springs along the bank of the lake and in the lake. 
There are about 200 hot springs, most of which are distributed along the shoreline.
In four locations around the lake can be observed at least 10 geysers, which erupt up to 5 m high. Geyser activity is affected by the fluctuations of lake level, which may inundate or expose some geysers.


== Geology ==

Lake Bogoria occupies an asymmetric basin approximately 20 km long and 10 km wide, bordered by faults. 
The east and south borders are marked by a major fault, with steep slopes that prevent wetland development (the Siracho Escarpment, to the east). 
To the west, trachyphonolites (uncommon extrusive igneous rock) are cut through by numerous gently sloping tilt-blocks; rivers oriented north-south feed delta lobes, where spring-fed wetlands have developed.
The north opens on a basin with Quaternary silts, sands and gravels; there, the gently sloping Sandai and Loboi plains gradually rise to a drainage divide that separates lake Bogoria and lake Baringo.

The faults control over 200 hot and cold springs and seeps, which bring a significant water input.

Core analysis of the lake floor has revealed two types of sedimentation: a shallow fan–deltaic clastic zone; and a deeper zone where Organic matters alternate with evaporites. The organic muds were formed during periods of relatively high lake level and high microbial productivity; whereas the evaporites were formed during drier periods. The cores attest of many environmental fluctuations during the past 30 000 years, linked to regional climatic changes and to local tectonic and hydrological conditions.

== Chemistry, hydrology ==

Lake Bogoria is a soda lake: it has no surface outlet, its waters are strongly alkaline (pH:10.5). High salt concentrations are also given (40‰) and this increases when the total amount of water decreases (evapoconcentration). Thus, following an extreme draught from March to October 2009, salt saturation reached 48‰. Soda lakes are highly productive ecosystems.

Its waters contain large concentrations of Na+, HCO3−, CO32− et Cl− ions. They originate from inflow from the Sandai and Emsos rivers, and from about 200 alkaline hot springs that are present at three onshore sites: Loburu, Chemurkeu, and a southern group (Ng&#x27;wasis, Koibobei, Losaramat). Other springs discharge directly from the lake floor. Lake Bogoria also contains the highest concentration of true geysers in Africa (at least 18 have been active in the 35 years before 2008).

The lake is meromictic (stratified) with less dense surface waters lying on a denser more saline bottom waters.

The lake has not always been saline. Sediment cores from the lake floor have shown that freshwater conditions existed for several periods during the past 10,000 years.

Of the &quot;&quot; 60 hot springs that discharge on Loburu delta plain on the western margin of the lake, travertine appears at 20% of them. Carbonate is actively precipitating at several of these, as shown by calcite-encrusted artefacts. This is unusual, in that this precipitation most probably occurs at temperatures over 80 °C.

The geysers are believed by some to have medicinal value.

== Ecology ==

The terrestrial vegetation that immediately surrounds the lake is mainly a thorny bushland dominated by &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Salvadora&quot;, &quot;Balanites&quot; and &quot;Commiphora&quot; species. There are also patches of riverine woodland with &quot;Ficus capensis&quot;, &quot;Acacia xanthophloea&quot; and &quot;Acacia tortilis&quot;.

=== Phytoplankton ===

One species dominates the phytoplankton: &quot;Arthrospira fusiformis&quot;, a cyanobacterium &quot;spirulina&quot;. But all these wetlands see the occurrence of diatoms in at least parts of them; these diatoms vary in diversity, abundance and species composition. The main factors directing these variables are pH, temperature, and specific conductivity; secondary factors are Si and nitrate.
Hot springs generally have a low diversity of diatoms, with variable abundance; they commonly include &quot;Anomoeoneis sphaerophora&quot; var. &quot;guntheri&quot;, 
&quot;Navicula tenella&quot;, &quot;Navicula cuspidata&quot;, and &quot;Nitzschia invisitata&quot;. 
In other wetland types, distinctive diatom floras variously include &quot;Fragilaria brevistriata&quot;, &quot;Gomphonema parvulum&quot;, &quot;Navicula tenelloides&quot;, &quot;Nitzschia communis&quot;, &quot;N. latens&quot;, &quot;N. sigma&quot;, &quot;Rhopalodia gibberula&quot;, and &quot;Stauroneis anceps&quot;.

The flamingoes feed on &quot;Arthrospira fusiformis&quot;.
The monogonont rotifer species &quot;Brachionus&quot; sp. &quot;Austria&quot; (belonging to the &quot;Brachionus plicatilis&quot; cryptic species complex) is found in high densities.

A new alkaliphilic purple nonsulfur bacterium was discovered in lake Bogoria; it has been named &quot;Rhodobaca bogoriensis&quot;.


=== Birds ===

The lake supports more than 300 waterbird species. It is an important stopover site for a population of up to 1.5 million migratory birds, notably for the lesser flamingo (&quot;Phoeniconaias minor&quot;).

In the 1990s, two episodes of mass deaths occurred among flamingos, all starting from Lake Bogoria. The first episode, in 1993–1995, saw about 35,000 flamingos dying between August and November 1993 and about 15,000 dying in August 1995. The second episode occurred in 1999–2000; the number of deaths for 2000 was estimated at around 100,000. In both cases, flamingos were the only water bird species falling victim to this unknown phenomenon. The studies on these events were not conclusive as to the main cause of death. Heavy metal poisoning was suggested but such poisoning does not have a periodic effect: its effect are continuous, and in these cases not compatible with the periodic dying; nor was it coherent with that birds of all ages were concerned, whereas such poisoning affects older individuals more than younger ones (ther older ones have had more time to accumulate poison in their bodies). Food poisoning has also been cited. the main food for lesser flamingo is &quot;Spirulina platensis&quot;, which is abundantly produced in the lakes of that region; but around the years that saw this heavy mortality toll, there had been an important increase of toxic cyanobacteria, especially during periods of algal blooms; and the symptoms of dying flamingos were similar to those of algal toxicity.

=== Other animals ===

Its immediate surroundings are a critical habitat for vulnerable species such as the common hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus amphibius&quot;) and African lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;); another important species is the greater kudu (&quot;Tragelaphus strepsiceros&quot;). The lake&#x27;s stable water level makes it doubly important during periods of drought, when water levels in other East African lakes drop.

== Nature protection ==

The Site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2011 and an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA). The Ramsar site, designated on August 27, 2001, covers the entire National Reserve, with an area of , shared between the 3,300 ha lake and 7,400 ha of riparian and terrestrial habitats.

== Human rights: the Endorois people ==

The lake area was the traditional home of the Endorois people, who were forced to leave the area in the 1970s and are now challenging their removal at the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights. In 2009 the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights (ACHPR) made a landmark ruling, ordering the Kenyan government to restore the Endorois to their historic land, compensate them from losses and sharing with them the profits from the Lake Bogoria game reserve. But in 2022, Minority Rights Group reported that that decision had not yet been implemented and has many Endorois were still consigned to &#x27;severe poverty, illiteracy, poor health and a life of destitution.&#x27; &lt;br&gt;
In 2024 the Endorois allied with the Ogiek people — who have themselves been initially evicted in 1920 from their ancestral grounds in the Mau Forest (south-west Kenya) by the British colonial government. In 2017 the Ogiek also won a court case against the Kenian government, whereby the latter was supposed to restitute the Ogiek ancestral land and pay a compensation of 157,000 Kenyan shillings ($1,026) per person. As of 2024, not only the government has so far failed to implement the court&#x27;s orders as in the case of the Endorois, but has persisted in further evictions imposed in November 2023 by the Kenyan authorities during the visit of Britain&#x27;s King Charles III. &lt;br&gt; 
On 6 February 2024, both ethnies demonstrated together in Nairobi with the support of the International Network for Economic, social and cultural rights to demand the government implement the rulings.

The area is inhabited by Tugen and Jemps pastoralists, and livestock grazing is the main land use in the area.

== Tourism ==

The lake and its surroundings attract 200,000 tourists per year, due to the wildlife, the hot springs, the spectacular cliffs and escarpments and the rich indigenous culture.

Hotel accommodation is available near Loboi village at the north end of the lake. Camping is permitted at the southern end of the lake.

<text>Matthew Bulloch Dymond, (September 24, 1911 – February 21, 1996) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1955 to 1975 who represented the riding of Ontario. He served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Leslie Frost and John Robarts.

==Background==
Dymond was born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and emigrated to Canada in his teens, where he completed his high school education. He received his Doctor of Medicine, from Queen&#x27;s University in 1941 and he did post-graduate work in Kingston and Toronto before joining the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. He served in Canada, England, and Western Europe with the Surgical Division of Number 10 Canadian General Hospital. After the war, he set up general practice in Port Perry, Ontario, in 1946. Dymond was married to Phyllis Jeanne (January 28, 1903 - March 25, 2002) and they had two daughters, Beverley (Livesay) and Nancy Dymond.

==Politics==
Dymond started his political career as a Councillor in Port Perry, in 1948, and he later served on the School Board. Dymond won the Progressive Conservative provincial nomination in May 1955 on the fifth ballot, with 3,500 people voting. He won election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the June 1955 provincial election representing the riding of Ontario. He soon joined Leslie Frost&#x27;s cabinet as Minister of Reform Institutions in 1957. He briefly served as Minister of Transportation before becoming Minister of Health in 1958.

When Frost retired in 1961, Dymond ran in the PC leadership convention, coming in sixth place. He remained Minister of Health in the government of Frost&#x27;s successor, John Robarts, until his resignation from cabinet in 1969. He oversaw the implementation of the Ontario Health Insurance Plan which is Ontario&#x27;s version of Medicare. After leaving cabinet, Dymond remained a backbench Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) until the 1975 election when he retired from politics and returned to his medical practice in Port Perry.

<text>The Boilermaker Special is the official mascot of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. It resembles a Victorian-era railroad locomotive and is built on a truck chassis. It is operated and maintained by the student members of the Purdue Reamer Club. It is often incorrectly assumed that Purdue Pete is the official mascot of the university.

==Inspiration for the Boilermaker Special==

Purdue University is a land-grant university (or Agricultural and Mechanical (A&amp;M) university) created through the Morrill Act of 1862. In the 1890s, Purdue became a leader in the research of railway technology. For many years Purdue operated the &quot;Schenectady No. 1&quot;, &quot;Schenectady No. 2&quot;, and the &quot;Vauclain&quot; on a dynamometer in an engineering laboratory on the West Lafayette campus. The Schenectady No. 1 and 2 were &quot;American&quot;-type steam locomotives manufactured by (and named for) the Schenectady Locomotive Works of Schenectady, New York. They were typical U.S. steam locomotives of the 1890s, a period both of rapid change in the technology of steam locomotives and of the intense interest in understanding their performance that inspired the creation of Purdue&#x27;s locomotive testing program. Purdue even operated its own railroad to connect the campus powerplant to a main rail line. The American Railway Association Building, which stands on the West Lafayette campus to the southwest of the Mechanical Engineering Building, is one of the few remaining vestiges of the railroad testing which occurred on the campus. It was constructed in 1926 to test railroad car draft gears. Locomotive research ended in 1938 when the Vauclain&#x27;s boiler was declared unsafe and the dynamometer was decommissioned. 

==Creation of the mascot==
For many years Purdue did not have a mascot. In 1939, Purdue pharmacy student Israel Selkowitz suggested the school adopt an official mascot to represent Purdue&#x27;s engineering heritage. He originally proposed a &quot;mechanical man&quot;. After much debate, it was decided to build a locomotive on an automobile chassis. This choice allowed the mascot to build on Purdue&#x27;s engineering and railroading heritage, as well as represent the school&#x27;s nickname &quot;Boilermakers&quot; in a meaningful way.

The &quot;Boilermaker&quot; nickname came about during the early years of Purdue football. There had been rumors the university enrolled burly boilermakers from the Monon Railroad shops in Lafayette, Indiana as students/football players to help beef up the scrawny football team after a 44-0 victory over Wabash College in 1891. When a railroad operated an extra train independent of the scheduled timetable, it was known as a &quot;special&quot;. Thus, the trains which carried Purdue&#x27;s sporting teams and their fans to other cities for athletic contests were known as &quot;Boilermaker Specials&quot;. 

Financial support and encouragement to build the first Boilermaker Special were provided by key members of the Purdue University graduating class of 1907, and members of the Purdue Reamer Club from the graduating classes of 1940 and 1941.

==Boilermaker Special I==

The Boilermaker Special I was introduced in 1940. The locomotive body was constructed by the Baldwin Locomotive Works and installed on a 1939 &quot;Champion&quot; automobile chassis donated by the Studebaker Corporation (South Bend, Indiana). The chassis had a 6-cylinder in-line gasoline engine and a three-speed manual transmission. The gearshift was on the steering column.
The cab contained a single bench seat for the driver and one passenger. Although the coal tender area was not designed for passengers, one passenger could sit on top each of the wheel fenders. The cab had two sheetmetal doors, one on each side, each of which had an open window. Although the cab had a windshield, the back only had a window opening with no glass. This meant the wind and weather would enter the cab from the back.

The bell and the whistle on the boiler are believed to have been donated by the Monon Railroad shops in Lafayette. The whistle used exhaust from the engine as its source of compressed gas. Although the cab had marker lights, the only driving light was the single &#x27;cyclops&#x27; light mounted high on the front of the boiler. Due to the high placement of the single headlight and a minimal number of other exterior lights, Boilermaker Special I was not driven at night for safety reasons. In honor of the Purdue students and alumni who contributed to the project, the numbers &quot;074041&quot; were later installed in the sides of the headlight.

==Boilermaker Special II==

In 1953, the Boilermaker Special II was created by installing the original Baldwin body from the Boilermaker Special I on an International Harvester truck chassis. This meant that the Boilermaker Special II was visually identical to the Boilermaker Special I. 

After the Boilermaker Special III was introduced, the Boilermaker Special II was scrapped in a Lafayette IN salvage yard. This was personally witnessed by Reamer Club member Roger Brunstrum so that no one could later claim it was purchased from the scrap yard.

==Boilermaker Special trailer==
A matching trailer was introduced in 1956 to provide seats for about 30 passengers. Passengers boarded the trailer by a set of stairs at the rear of the trailer. One member of the Reamer Club rode the trailer at the stairs to prevent anyone from boarding or exiting the trailer while the trailer was in motion and to communicate with those towing the trailer.

The trailer was similar to a wagon in that the front wheels were steered by a towing yoke. The trailer also had pneumatic brakes which received compressed air from the Boilermaker Special via pneumatic connections adjacent to the trailer hitch. The brakes on the trailer were remotely actuated independently from the brakes on the Boilermaker Special by a hand-operated lever mounted to the right side of the Boilermaker Special&#x27;s steering column. When it was desired to stop the train, the Pilot had to simultaneously operate the foot brake for the Boilermaker Special and the hand brake for the trailer.

While the trailer did provide additional passenger seating, it was difficult to tow. The brakes worked best when the trailer was fully loaded. When the trailer was lightly loaded, the braking action was excessive, which resulted in the wheels locking and skidding when the brakes were applied. Since the trailer brakes were remotely operated by a hand lever, and the Pilot always had to be ready to operate the brakes, the Pilot had to keep one hand on the trailer brake lever at all times while the Boilermaker Special was moving in the event an emergency stop had to be executed. This meant the Pilot was always driving with only one hand on the steering wheel when the trailer was in use. If the Pilot forgot to operate the trailer brakes when the Boilermaker Special&#x27;s foot brake was operated, the trailer might jack-knife, particularly if more passengers were seated on one side of the trailer. Also, the steering action of the front trailer wheels was not damped, so the towing speed of the trailer was limited to 25 miles per hour. If the trailer hit a bump when above 25 mph, a stable, rapid, side-to-side oscillation was induced in the front of the trailer that could only be stopped by slowing the trailer below 20 mph. This oscillating motion was very uncomfortable and disturbing to the passengers. Finally, since the front wheels were steered by the towing yoke, the trailer could not be pushed backwards by the Boilermaker Special. It always had to be towed in a forward direction. If it was necessary to move the trailer backwards, the trailer had to be completely disconnected from the Boilermaker Special and manually pushed backwards while being manually steered with the towing yoke.

In later years the trailer was infrequently used. It was retired and scrapped in 1993 when the Boilermaker Special V was introduced. Beginning with Boilermaker Special III, the Boilermaker Special had sufficient seating capacity in the &quot;coal tender&quot; area to accommodate most groups. Boilermaker Special V was neither equipped with a trailer hitch nor pneumatic connections to supply the trailer&#x27;s brakes. As a result, the trailer could no longer be towed and was no longer needed.

==Boilermaker Special III==

In 1960, the Boilermaker Special III was introduced. It was built in Detroit by the General Motors Corporation on a 2-ton GMC school bus chassis. It was initially powered by a Buick 6-cylinder gasoline engine connected to a two-speed manual transmission. A single rear axle with dual wheels and a manual-shift, two-speed differential rounded out the drive train. It also featured a pneumatic brake system. A trailer hitch and pneumatic fittings were at the rear of the vehicle to tow the trailer introduced in 1956.

Boilermaker Special III featured an all-new body that was much larger and visually different than the Baldwin-manufactured body used on Boilermaker Specials I and II. The cab and coal tender were constructed of plywood with facings of sheet steel on each side. Forward of the cab, the body was heavy sheet steel and steel plate. The brass bell originally installed on Boilermaker Specials I and II was installed on the boiler. A new headlight was installed at the front of the boiler. It featured a standard automotive 12-volt marker bulb reflected by a large parabolic mirror. It was so bright it could only be used during parades. A locomotive air horn was installed on the top left side of the cab. When the horn was sounded, the Boilermaker Special III could be heard from miles away. To complete the locomotive theme, &quot;steam&quot; could be sprayed from the smokestack. The steam was actually carbon dioxide released by the driver from a fire extinguisher cylinder within the cab and plumbed to a nozzle just below the top of the smokestack.

The body featured a full 12-volt negative ground electrical system powered by an alternator. It supplied power to concealed four-beam headlights, parking/marker lights, brake lights, backup lights, instrument lights, electric windshield wipers, a single-speed heater blower, and a radio/public address system. With this equipment, the Boilermaker Special III was capable of day or night operation on most improved roads, including highways. The original headlight from Boilermaker Special I was initially installed on the back of the coal tender as a rear-facing safety light. It was later removed and installed as the headlight of the Boilermaker IV in 1979 (see below). A white block P was displayed on the front of the boiler directly below the large front headlight. The block P was mounted to a metal mesh screen which allowed external cool air to be drawn through the radiator by the engine&#x27;s radiator fan.

In the 1970s, the original engine and transmission were replaced with a carbureted Chevrolet 350 cubic inch V-8 and a three-speed automatic transmission. The two-speed differential was locked in high gear and shift mechanism removed. A power steering pump and steering assist cylinder were installed to reduce steering effort. In the early 1980s, a brass whistle was installed next to the brass bell and used the same source of compressed air as the large train horn.

In this final configuration, the Boilermaker Special III weighed about 9,300 pounds (4,218 kg). When it was retired in 1993, it had traveled over 110,000 miles (177,027 km).

==Boilermaker X-tra Special IV==

In 1979, a small version of the Boilermaker Special was introduced. The Boilermaker Special IV, or &quot;X-tra Special&quot; as it became known, was built on an E-Z-GO electric golf cart chassis. This allowed the mascot to be displayed at indoor functions or on softer surfaces (i.e. a turf athletic field) where its massive gasoline-powered, and later diesel-powered big brother could never go. The headlight was the original headlight used on Boilermaker Special I and II. The top of the smokestack could be removed to allow the X-tra Special to fit inside freight elevators and move through standard height, side-by-side walk-through doors. The IV also featured a white block P on the front of the boiler directly below the headlight, just like the Boilermaker Special III.

==Boilermaker Special V==

Boilermaker Special V was introduced on September 25, 1993. It was built on a Navistar Low-Profile 4600 chassis and powered by a non-turbocharged V-8 diesel engine. The Navistar chassis was donated by the Navistar International Corporation (formerly International Harvester). The body was primarily constructed of aluminum which was donated by Alcoa, which has an aluminum processing factory in Lafayette, Indiana. The aluminum body was fabricated and installed on the chassis by the Wabash National Corporation, also of Lafayette, Indiana. Like the Boilermaker Special III, the Boilermaker Special V had pneumatic brakes. However, there was neither a trailer hitch nor pneumatic brake fittings at the rear of the vehicle. As a result, the trailer introduced in 1956 could no longer be towed.

The brass bell from Boilermaker Special I and the brass whistle from Boilermaker Special III were installed on the boiler. A five-chime freight train horn from a Norfolk Southern locomotive was installed on the body. The coal tender was large enough to seat up to 14 passengers. The Special was able to &quot;kneel&quot;, which allowed children and the elderly easier access to the coal tender. Despite the extensive use of aluminum in the body, the Boilermaker Special V weighed 10,800 pounds (4,900 kg), nearly 1,500 pounds (680 kg) more than the previous version. The Boilermaker Special V was the first to feature an Arabic number &quot;5&quot; on the front of the boiler directly below the headlight.

==Boilermaker X-tra Special VI==

X-tra Special IV was later disassembled to make way for X-tra Special VI. Joe Peñaloza, a Purdue University graduate, designed the VI. It was built on a Club Car golf cart chassis, which was donated by Angel Hills Golf Course in Rossville, Indiana. The exterior body was made of a fiberglass composite, donated by Brunswick Tech. The structural work was done mainly at Wabash National. The fiberglass body was formed by Dr. Ray Thompson and his aviation composite materials class at the Purdue Airport. The paint was applied by West Coast Customs and donated by Valspar Corp. Pyramids Sign and Design completed all the detail paintwork. Many of the other materials used in the creation of VI were donated. These items include the brass, which was donated by ABC Metals Inc., bagging material was donated by Decomp, specialty foams donated by Diab, resin used before painting donated by Resin Services, and the lights and safety devices were donated by TSD.

The X-tra Special VI was dedicated Saturday October 19, 1996 at the homecoming game against Ohio State at the end of the half time show. The X-tra Special VI was used in both basketball and football games. The last public appearance by the Boilermaker Special VI was on October 7, 2017 at the Minnesota-Purdue football game in West Lafayette Indiana. The VI led the football team onto the field for the start of the game with its replacement, the Boilermaker Special VIII (see below).

==Boilermaker Special VII==

In 2011, the Boilermaker Special V underwent a significant overhaul with the help of the Wabash National corporation. With over 200,000 miles (321,868 km), it was in need of a new engine, transmission and chassis. In June 2011, the university confirmed the overhauled mascot would indeed be branded as Boilermaker Special VII, which is reflected by the number &quot;7&quot; displayed on the front of the train&#x27;s boiler. The new design was made by Reamer Alumna Beth (Smart) Miller (F&#x27;06). The body was changed slightly to adjust to the new parts, as well as a slight change in the paint scheme. New whistles and bells were also installed, while retaining the original brass bell from Boilermaker Special I. Much to the delight of many Reamer Club Alumni, the Special is outfitted with modern LED lighting on both its running boards as well as its cyclops. Boilermaker Special VII was presented to the university on September 3, 2011 at halftime of the Middle Tennessee State-Purdue football game. It was dedicated on October 1, 2011 at a luncheon which preceded the Notre Dame-Purdue football game.

==Boilermaker X-tra Special VIII==

On June 16, 2017, the Reamer Club announced the Boilermaker Special VI would be retired and replaced by the Boilermaker Special VIII. The VIII was assembled from a new, heavy-duty Caryall Turf 2 golf cart donated by Club Car and a new body designed and fabricated by the Wabash National corporation. The smokestack on the VIII is shorter than those on the IV and VI so that it no longer needs to be disassembled to drive into freight elevators or pass through doorways. The new X-tra Special made its first public appearance in West Lafayette Indiana at the Minnesota-Purdue football game on October 7, 2017 alongside the Boilermaker Special VI, which was making its final public appearance. The VIII led the football team onto the field, and was later featured in an announcement at the stadium during the third media time-out of the first quarter. The Purdue All-American Marching Band also played a tribute to the Boilermaker Special during their pregame performance. The band formed an image of the X-Tra Special on the field, then played &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot; as the formation moved across the field. The performance included band members discharging fire extinguishers at the top of the smokestack. A private dedication followed the football game at the Purdue Memorial Union. In attendance were active and honorary members of the Reamer Club, recent pledges, university advisors, Wabash National employees, and Reamer Club alumni representing six decades of membership.

==Boilermaker Special IX==
On September 15, 2023, after a dinner to celebrate the Reamer Club&#x27;s 100th anniversary, the Reamer Club announced that a new Boilermaker Special IX will be developed with a goal to be ready for service in the summer of 2025. As with recent new Boilermaker Specials, Wabash National and Navistar International are expected to contribute to the design and construction.

==Remnants of retired Boilermaker Specials==
Only a few small pieces of Boilermaker Specials I, II, III, and IV remain in existence. The majority of their bodies and chassis were scrapped when they were retired, primarily to prevent any person or group from later claiming ownership of what was once the Boilermaker Special. The fate of Boilermaker Special VI has not yet been disclosed.

The brass bell from the Boilermaker Special I is the same bell that was used on Boilermaker Specials II, III, and V. It is currently installed on Boilermaker Special VII. Pieces of sheetmetal from the Boilermaker Special I body containing the painted words &quot;Purdue&quot; and &quot;Boilermaker Special&quot; were saved when the body of Boilermaker II was scrapped in 1960 and remained on display in the Boilermaker Special garage for many years. The cyclops headlight from Boilermaker Special I was saved by the Reamer Club after it was removed from Boilermaker Special II in 1960. Photographs from the 1960s show it installed on the back of Boilermaker Special III. It was later installed on the front of Boilermaker Special IV in 1979. This headlight was not used Boilermaker Special VI or VIII and has been archived.

Some parts of Boilermaker Special III were saved before it was scrapped. The locomotive headlight&#x27;s parabolic reflector and trim were installed in a new headlight box and placed at the front of Boilermaker Special V. The single-flute steam whistle, which was installed in the 1980s, was transferred to the Boilermaker Special V as well. Sheetmetal bearing the painted words &quot;Purdue&quot; and &quot;Boilermaker Special&quot; were saved and archived. Finally, a heavy brass plaque, which was installed inside the cab above the windshield to commemorate the 1960 dedication of the Boilermaker Special III, was removed and archived.

The chassis and drive train of Boilermaker Special V were scrapped, while the body was modified and restored and became the body of Boilermaker Special VII.

The cowcatcher from the BMS V is on display in the Purdue Boilermaker Station Welcome Center. 

==Operation and maintenance==
Although it is owned by Purdue University and the State of Indiana, the Boilermaker Special has been operated, maintained, and funded by the members of the Purdue Reamer Club since the mascot&#x27;s introduction in 1940. The club&#x27;s membership consists entirely of independent Purdue students (those who are not members of a social fraternity or sorority) who represent a wide cross-section of the student body. Within the Reamer Club, a Boilermaker Special Chairperson and a separate X-tra Special Chairperson are elected each semester to oversee the operation and maintenance of the mascots. Only men and women of the Reamer Club may serve as Pilots (engineers) or Co-pilots for the mascots after passing a rigorous training period. The Boilermaker Special is frequently seen around the main campus, at athletic contests, and at local community events where it is used to promote the university. From May through August, it can also be seen around the state of Indiana in various parades and festivals. It spreads school spirit by blowing its train whistle and horn. It also has an external sound system that plays family-friendly music. The members of the Purdue Reamer Club travel with the train to nearly every football game, including bowl games. During the football season, caps bearing the logos of defeated opponents are attached to the Boilermaker Special&#x27;s cow-catcher.

<text>Recklinghausen (; Westphalian: &quot;Riäkelhusen&quot;) is the northernmost city in the Ruhr-Area and the capital of the Recklinghausen district. It borders the rural Münsterland and is characterized by large fields and farms in the north and industry in the south. Recklinghausen is the 60th-largest city in Germany and the 22nd-largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia.

==History==
First mentioned in 1017 as &quot;Ricoldinchuson&quot;, in 1150 the city was the center of the surrounding Vest Recklinghausen. In 1236, Recklinghausen received town privileges. There is record of Jews in the city as early as 1305. As part of the County of Vest, ownership of Recklinghausen changed several times in the 15th and 16th century, and in 1576, the entire county was pawned to the Elector of Cologne. In 1582–83, again in 1586, and again in 1587, the city was plundered by partisan armies during the Cologne War, a feud over religious parity in Electorate of Cologne and electoral influence in the Holy Roman Empire.

Recklinghausen was also the site of more than 100 witchcraft trials (1514–1710). The trial activity reached a climax twice: In the time period of 1580/81 and again in 1588/89. The last person to be convicted of witchcraft was Anna Spickermann; after spending 16 months in prison, she was sentenced to death by sword and burned afterward.

, the administration of the Vest Recklinghausen was divided into two parts, with the eastern part administered by Recklinghausen. The town of Recklinghausen including the parish of Recklinghausen and the parishes Ahsen, Datteln, Flaesheim, Hamm-Bossendorf, Henrichenburg, Herten, Horneburg, Oer, Suderwich, Waltrop and Westerholt. In 1803-1811 became the capital of a sovereign Principality of the Dukes of Arenberg who retain the title. , the Vest was made a Bürgermeisterei, with the town becoming the seat. In 1819, Herten joined the Recklinghausen Bürgermeisterei, and Erkenschwick followed in 1821.

During World War II, in December 1939, the Stalag XX-B prisoner-of-war camp was founded in the city, however, it was relocated after a few days, and from 1941 to 1943, a forced labour camp was operated in the city. As a target of the Oil Campaign of World War II, oil production at Recklinghausen/Forstezung was bombed by the RAF on 15 January 1945; and South Recklinghausen (&quot;Recklinghausen Süd&quot;) was captured by the US 137th Infantry on 1 April 1945.

==Main sights==
Recklinghausen is home to a museum of icons, which includes more than 1,000 Orthodox works from Russia, Greece and the Balkan countries, as well as early Coptic Christian art from Egypt. The icon museum – the largest outside the Orthodox world – was founded in 1956 and reopened after renovation in February 2006 for its 50th anniversary.

The Ruhrfestspielhaus (Ruhr Festival Theatre), whose remodeling in 2001 won the German Architecture Award is home of &quot;Die Liegende Nr 5&quot;, a famous sculpture by Henry Moore. At the Lohtor in front of a memorial for the victims of World War I, there is a large sculpture made of more than 30,000 bricks by Per Kirkeby.

==Annual events==
Recklinghausen hosts the annual Ruhrfestspiele (Ruhr Festival), a cultural festival with an international reputation. Every year there is a cultural programme with many national and international theatrical productions starting on 1 May. In 2008 the programme included the play &quot;Speed the Plow&quot; starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Goldblum as one of the major productions. The main theatrical stage is the Ruhrfestspielhaus but other theatres in and around Recklinghausen participate.

==Transport==
The two major motorways crossing the area of the city are the A2 and the A43. The city is connected to the larger waterways by the Rhein-Herne-Kanal. Recklinghausen has two railway stations. The &quot;Central Station&quot; (Recklinghausen Hauptbahnhof), which is served by Intercity and EuroCity services, and the &quot;South Station&quot; (Recklinghausen Südbahnhof).

There are two Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn lines - S 2 to Dortmund via Herne - Castrop-Rauxel and S 9 to Hagen via Gladbeck - Bottrop - Essen - Velbert - Wuppertal.

<doc id="1069576" wikidata="Q1135655" url="?curid=1069576" title="Lake Magadi">
<text>Lake Magadi is the southernmost lake in the Kenyan Rift Valley, lying in a catchment of faulted volcanic rocks, north of Tanzania&#x27;s Lake Natron. During the dry season, it is 80% covered by soda and is known for its wading birds, including flamingos.

Lake Magadi is a saline, alkaline lake, approximately 100 square kilometers in size, that lies in an endorheic basin formed by a graben. The lake is an example of a &quot;saline pan&quot;. The lake water, which is a dense sodium carbonate brine, precipitates vast quantities of the mineral trona (sodium sesquicarbonate). In places, the salt is up to 40 m thick. The lake is recharged mainly by saline hot springs (temperatures up to 86 °C) that discharge into alkaline &quot;lagoons&quot; around the lake margins, leaving little surface runoff in this region. Most hot springs lie along the northwestern and southern shorelines of the lake. During the rainy season, a thin layer (less than 1 m) of brine covers much of the saline pan, but it evaporates rapidly, leaving a vast expanse of white salt that cracks to produce large polygons. A single species of fish, a cichlid &quot;Alcolapia grahami&quot;, inhabits the hot, highly alkaline waters of this lake basin and is commonly seen in some of the hot spring pools around the shoreline, where the water temperature is less than 45 °C.

Lake Magadi was not always so saline. Several thousand years ago (during the late Pleistocene to mid-Holocene in the African humid period), the Magadi basin held a freshwater lake with many different fish species, whose remains are preserved in the High Magadi Beds, a series of lacustrine and volcaniclastic sediments preserved in various locations around the present shoreline. Evidence also exists for several older Pleistocene precursor lakes that were much larger than the present Lake Magadi. At times, Lake Magadi and Lake Natron were united to form a single larger lake.

Lake Magadi is also well known for its extensive deposits of siliceous chert. There are many varieties including bedded cherts that formed in the lake and intrusive dike-like bodies that penetrated through overlying sediments while the silica was soft. The most famous is the &quot;Magadi-type chert&quot;, which formed from a sodium silicate mineral precursor magadiite that was discovered at Lake Magadi in 1967.

Magadiite, a rare hydrous sodium-silicate mineral [NaSi7O13(OH)3·4(H2O)], was discovered about 50 years ago in sediments around Lake Magadi, a hypersaline alkaline lake fed by hot springs in the semi-arid southern Kenya Rift Valley. Today, this harsh lacustrine environment excludes most organisms except microbial extremophiles, a few invertebrates (mostly insects), highly adapted fish (&quot;Alcolapia&quot; sp.), and birds including flamingos. Burrows discovered in outcrops of the High Magadi Beds (~25–9 ka) that predate the modern saline (trona) pan show that beetles and other invertebrates inhabit this extreme environment when conditions become more favorable. Burrows (cm-scale) preserved in magadiite in the High Magadi Beds are filled with mud, silt and sand from overlying sediments. Their stratigraphic context reveals upward-shallowing cycles from mud to interlaminated mud-magadiite to magadiite in dm-scale units. The burrows were formed when the lake floor became fresher and oxygenated, after a period when magadiite precipitated in shallow saline waters. The burrows, probably produced by beetles, suggest that trace fossils can provide evidence for short-term (ranging from years to decades) changes in the contemporary environment that might not otherwise be recognized or preserved physically or chemically in the sediment record.

Magadi township lies on the lake&#x27;s east shore, and is home to the Magadi Soda factory, owned by Tata India since December 2005. This factory produces soda ash, which has a range of industrial uses.

The lake is featured in Fernando Meirelles&#x27;s film &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;, which is based on the book of the same name by John le Carré, and is used as a stand-in for Lake Turkana in the north of Kenya, where the book and film are set.

A causeway that crosses the lake provides access to the area west of the lake (Nguruman Escarpment). Recently accommodation for tourists is provided in air conditioned canvas tents.

<doc id="1069577" wikidata="Q550381" url="?curid=1069577" title="Dick Wolf">
<text>Richard Anthony Wolf (born December 20, 1946) is an American film and television producer, best known for his &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise. Since 1990, the franchise has included six police/courtroom dramas and four international spinoffs. He is also co-creator and executive producer of the &quot;Chicago&quot; franchise, which since 2012, has included four Chicago-based dramas and the co-creator and executive producer of the &quot;FBI&quot; franchise, which since 2018, has also become a franchise after spinning off two additional series.

Wolf has also written four books. The first, the non-fiction volume &quot;Law &amp; Order: Crime Scenes&quot;, is a companion to the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; television series. &quot;The Intercept,&quot; &quot;The Execution,&quot; and &quot;The Ultimatum&quot; are works of fiction in a thriller series featuring an NYPD detective named Jeremy Fisk.

Wolf has won numerous awards, including an Emmy Award, being inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame and receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Wolf was born in Manhattan to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother of Irish descent. As a boy, he was an altar server at the local Catholic parish.

Wolf attended Saint David&#x27;s School, The Gunnery, and Phillips Academy, Andover. He subsequently attended the University of Pennsylvania (class of 1969), where he was a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity.

==Career==
===Advertising===
Wolf worked as an advertising copywriter at Benton &amp; Bowles creating commercials for Crest toothpaste, including the slogan &quot;You can&#x27;t beat Crest for fighting cavities.&quot; He is also credited with the campaign &quot;I&#x27;m Cheryl, fly me&quot; for National Airlines. Yet despite his success in copywriting, all the while he was writing screenplays in the hopes of a film career. It was at this time that he briefly collaborated on a screenplay with Oliver Stone, who was a struggling screenwriter at the time.

===Initial screenwriting success===
He moved to Los Angeles after a few years and had three screenplays produced; one of these films, &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1988), featuring Rob Lowe and Meg Tilly, gained notable acclaim. He started his television career as a staff writer on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and was nominated for his first Emmy Award for the episode &quot;What Are Friends For?&quot;, on which he was the only writer. While working on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, Wolf became close friends with Tom Fontana, then writing for the series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, produced in the same building, at the same time. Wolf moved from &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; to &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, where he was a writer and co-producer for the third and fourth seasons.

===&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise===
Wolf&#x27;s original series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; ran from 1990 to 2010, and was revived in 2022. It has surpassed &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; as longest-running dramatic show in American television history, making it one of television&#x27;s most successful franchises. It has been nominated for the most consecutive Emmy Awards of any primetime drama series. Wolf serves as creator and executive producer of the current &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; drama series from Wolf Entertainment and NBCUniversal Television – &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; ((which as of September 5, 2024 is the longest-running scripted primetime drama, having aired 551 episodes, breaking the original &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; count of 456) now 501 through the twenty-third season, and beating both the original &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in number of seasons)) . 

Wolf also was creator and executive producer for the four spinoff shows in the franchise that have been canceled – &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order: LA&quot;. Along with Kevin Arkadie, he co-created the police drama &quot;New York Undercover&quot;, which ran on the Fox Broadcasting Company Network from 1994 to 1999. He also served as executive producer of the series. He was the creator and executive producer of NBC&#x27;s courtroom reality series &quot;Crime &amp; Punishment&quot;, which chronicled real-life cases prosecuted by the San Diego District Attorney&#x27;s office. Many of Wolf&#x27;s series have intersected with the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise in some fashion, and the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; series have been adapted into several foreign versions. Wolf&#x27;s company also produced &quot;Twin Towers&quot;, the 2003 Academy Award–winning Short Documentary about two brothers, one a policeman and the other a fireman, who were killed in the line of duty on September 11, 2001. Wolf was also involved with &quot;When You&#x27;re Strange&quot;, the production of a theatrical documentary about the rock band The Doors.

==== &quot;Organized Crime&quot; ====
On March 31, 2020, Wolf announced that a spin-off series was ordered by NBC to launch in the 2020–21 season, with Christopher Meloni reprising his role as Elliot Stabler from &quot;SVU&quot; after a nine-year absence. The initial series order was for 13 episodes. On June 2, 2020, it was announced that the series would be called &quot;Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime&quot; and that showrunner Craig Gore had been fired.

==== &quot;Hate Crimes&quot; ====
Wolf announced that NBC placed an order of 13 episodes for &quot;Law &amp; Order: Hate Crimes&quot;, a new installment of the franchise. On March 4, 2019, NBC announced that the series would be redeveloped to flesh out the concept and would not be spun out of &quot;SVU&quot; as announced. On June 5, 2020, the series of &quot;Hate Crimes&quot; was moved to NBC&#x27;s streaming service, Peacock, at least partly due to language concerns.

==== &quot;For the Defense&quot; ====
On May 3, 2021, Wolf announced that NBC ordered yet another installment of the franchise, &quot;Law &amp; Order: For the Defense&quot;, and that its showrunner would be Carol Mendelsohn. It was later announced that the show would not move forward.

===&quot;Chicago&quot; franchise===
Wolf developed &quot;Chicago Fire,&quot; a drama about a group of men and women working at the Chicago Fire Department. The series was picked up by NBC in May 2012, and premiered on October 10, 2012, with meek numbers in the ratings and minimal reviews in the first few weeks before spiking to NBC&#x27;s #2 scripted drama series, under &quot;Revolution.&quot; In March 2013, NBC announced intentions for a spin-off of &quot;Chicago Fire&quot; revolving around the Chicago Police Department. When that series &quot;Chicago P.D.&quot; premiered, Derek Haas, Michael W. Brandt, and Matt Olmstead became executive producers, under Wolf. Two subsequent shows, &quot;Chicago Med&quot; which premiered in 2015, and &quot;Chicago Justice&quot; whose one season began and ended in 2017, followed in &quot;Chicago P.D.&#x27;s&quot; wake.

=== &quot;FBI&quot; franchise ===

In 2018, Wolf became executive producer of the CBS drama &quot;FBI&quot;, starring &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; cast members Jeremy Sisto and Alana de la Garza and also Sela Ward. &quot;FBI&quot; has since had two spinoffs (&quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;), giving Wolf his third franchise.

Beginning in the 2021-2022 TV season, all three of Wolf&#x27;s franchises have their own night of programming: &quot;FBI&quot; Tuesdays on CBS (original series, &quot;Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;International&quot;), &quot;Chicago&quot; Wednesdays on NBC (&quot;Med&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;P.D.&quot;), and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; Thursdays on NBC (original series revival, &quot;SVU&quot; and &quot;Organized Crime&quot;).

===Other work===
In 2012, Wolf developed the unscripted show &quot;Cold Justice&quot;, a documentary drama, for TNT. He also has written three novels whose central character is NYPD Detective Jeremy Fisk: &quot;The Intercept&quot;, &quot;The Execution&quot;, and &quot;The Ultimatum&quot;. In 2024, Wolf released a documentary miniseries with Netflix called &quot;Homicide: New York&quot;. 

In May 2021, NBC ordered a docuseries &quot;LA Fire and Rescue&quot;. The series followed the firefighters of the Los Angeles County Fire Department and will be executive produced by Wolf. This series was cancelled by NBC after one season.

===Future projects===
Wolf&#x27;s future projects for NBC are an American adaption of the United Kingdom psychological legal drama series &quot;Injustice&quot; as well as a drama series revolving around a satanic cult, tentatively titled &quot;The Church&quot;. Wolf is writing the latter project with Howard Franklin. Wolf also has an untitled pilot about an insurance investigator on USA Network.

With Wolf pursuing projects other than &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, he and current &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; showrunner/executive producer Warren Leight sometimes discuss the future of the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise and revitalizing it; Leight commenting &quot;(Dick Wolf and I) sometimes talk in general terms of where (the franchise) could go. I&#x27;m curious to see if there&#x27;s another iteration somewhere down the line.&quot;

=== Art collecting ===
In December 2023, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced the promised gift of over 200 works of art from Wolf, including Old Master paintings, sculptures and drawings, as well as funds to endow two galleries with his name. Wolf reported that his appreciation for art started when he was a child visiting Met on his way home from school.

==Honors==
Wolf&#x27;s personal honors include the Award of Excellence from the Banff Television Festival, the 2002 Creative Achievement Award from NATPE; the Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s Distinguished Entertainment Industry Award, the Leadership and Inspiration Award from the Entertainment Industries Council, the Governor&#x27;s Award by the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, the 1997 achievement award from the Caucus for Producers, Writers, and Directors, the 1998 Television Showman of the Year Award from the Publicists Guild of America, the 2002 Tribute from the Museum of Television and Radio, and a 2003 Special Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America. On March 29, 2007, Wolf received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7040 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2013, Wolf was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame. Wolf is also an Honorary Consul general of Monaco and is actively involved in the principality&#x27;s prestigious annual Television Festival.

==Political involvement==
It was reported that Wolf contributed to Fred Thompson&#x27;s campaign for the Republican nomination for president in 2008. The two had worked together since 2002, when Thompson joined the cast of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; playing a district attorney.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Community&quot;, a sitcom on NBC from 2009 to 2014 had an episode which parodied Dick Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, with the title &quot;Basic Lupine Urology&quot; being a play on his name. Wolf is given a special thanks credit at the end of the episode.

<doc id="1069583" wikidata="Q850805" url="?curid=1069583" title="Dattatreya">
<text>Dattatreya (, ), Dattā or Dattaguru, is a paradigmatic Sannyasi (monk) and one of the lords of yoga, venerated as a Hindu god. He is considered to be an avatar and combined form of the three Hindu gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, who are also collectively known as the Trimurti, and as the manifestation of Parabrahma, the supreme being, in texts such as the Bhagavata Purana, the Markandeya Purana, and the Brahmanda Purana, though stories about his birth and origin vary from text to text. Several Upanishads are dedicated to him, as are texts of the Vedanta-Yoga tradition in Hinduism. One of the most important texts of Hinduism, namely Avadhuta Gita (literally, &quot;song of the free soul&quot;) is attributed to Dattatreya. Over time, Dattatreya has inspired many monastic movements in Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism, particularly in the Deccan region of India, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himalayan regions where Shaivism is prevalent. His pursuit of simple life, kindness to all, sharing of his knowledge and the meaning of life during his travels is reverentially mentioned in the poems by Tukaram, a saint-poet of the Bhakti movement.

According to Rigopoulos, in the Nath tradition of Shaivism, Dattatreya is revered as the Adi-Guru (First Teacher) of the Adinath Sampradaya of the Nathas, the first &quot;Lord of Yoga&quot; with mastery of Tantra (techniques), although most traditions and scholars consider Adi Nath to be an epithet of Shiva. According to Mallinson, Dattatreya is not the traditional guru of the Nath Sampradaya but instead was co-opted by the Nath tradition in about the 18th century as a guru, as a part of Vishnu-Shiva syncretism. This is evidenced by the Marathi text &quot;Navanathabhaktisara&quot;, states Mallinson, wherein there is syncretic fusion of the Nath Sampradaya with the Mahanubhava sect by identifying nine Naths with nine Narayanas.

An annual festival in the Hindu calendar month of Mārgaśīrṣa (November/December) reveres Dattatreya and is known as Datta Jayanti.

In Sikh Religion, Guru Gobind Singh has written life history of Dattatreya in his composition called Rudra Avtar including Birth, Spiritual journey includes 24 Gurus and Realization of Akal Purakh.

== Life ==
In the Puranas, he was born in an Indian hermitage to Anasuya and her husband, the Vedic sage, Atri who is traditionally credited with making the largest contribution to the Rigveda. It is said that they lived in Mahur, Nanded District, Maharashtra. Another states that his father lived in the western Deccan region. A third claims he was born in the jungles of Kashmir near the sacred Amarnath Temple. A fourth legend states he was born along with his brothers Durvasa and Chandra, to an unwed mother named Anusuya, In a fifth myth, sage Atri was very old when young Anusuya married him and they sought the help of the &quot;trimurti&quot; gods for a child. As the trinity were pleased with them for having brought light and knowledge to the world, instantly granted the boon, which led Dattatreya to be born with characteristics of all three.

While his origins are unclear, stories about his life are clearer. He is described in the Mahabharata as an exceptional Rishi (sage) with extraordinary insights and knowledge, who is adored and raised to a Guru and an Avatar of Vishnu in the Puranas. Dattatreya is stated in these texts to having renounced the world and leaving his home at an early age to lead a monastic life. One myth claims he meditated immersed in water for a long time, another has him wandering from childhood. and Dattatreya made a &quot;tapa&quot; for 12,000 years there. The &quot;Tripura-rahasya&quot; refers to the disciple Parasurama finding Dattatreya meditating on Gandhamadana mountain, near Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu.

Dattatreya is said to have his lunch daily by taking alms at a holy place Pithapuram, Andhra Pradesh, where he was born as Sripada Sri Vallabha (his first avatar).

=== Self-education: The 24 Gurus of Dattatreya ===
The young Dattatreya is famous in the Hindu texts as the one who started with nothing and without teachers, yet reached self-awareness by observing nature during his &quot;Sannyasi&quot; wanderings, and treating these natural observations as his twenty four teachers. This legend has been emblematic in the Hindu belief, particularly among artists and Yogis, that ideas, teachings and practices come from all sources, that self effort is a means to learning. The 24 teachers of Dattatreya are:

== Iconography ==
Dattatreya is typically shown with three heads and six hands, one head each for Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva who represent the Trimurti, the 3 main gods in Hinduism, and one pair of hands holding the symbolic items associated with each of these gods: Japamala and Kamandalu of Brahma, Shakha and Sudarshana Chakra of Vishnu, Trishula and Damaru of Shiva. He is typically dressed as a simple monk, situated in a forest or wilderness suggestive of his renunciation of worldly goods and pursuit of a meditative yogic lifestyle. In paintings and some large carvings, he is surrounded by four dogs and a cow, which symbolise the four Vedas and mother earth who nourishes all living beings.

In very few older medieval temples of Dattatreya show him with just one head, such as the one in Mahur, one at Narayanpur on Pune Satara Road, Near Pune, and another in Pandharpur, both in southern Maharashtra. Very few texts such as Agni Purana describe the architectural features for building murti, and for Dattatreya, it recommends him with one head and two hands. In Varanasi, Nepal, north Himalayan foothill states of India, 15th-century Nath temples of Dattatreya show him with just one face. In most parts of India and world, the syncretic six armed and three faced iconography is more common.

He is the motif of the &#x27;&quot;honey bee&quot; Yogin who has realized advaita knowledge. Dattatreya as the archetypal model of syncretism:

Another distinctive aspect of Dattatreya iconography is that it includes four dogs and a cow. The four dogs represent the Vedas, as trustworthy all-weather friends, company and guardians, while the cow is a metaphor for mother earth who silently and always provides nourishment.

=== Alternate iconography ===
Dattatreya&#x27;s sculptures with alternate iconography have been identified in 1st millennium CE cave temples and archaeological sites related to Hinduism. For example, in the Badami temple (Karnataka), Dattatreya is shown to be with single head and four hands like Vishnu, but seated in a serene Yoga posture (&quot;padmasana&quot;). Carved with him are the emblems (&quot;lañchana&quot;) of the Trimurti, namely the swan of Brahma, the Garuda of Vishnu and the Nandi of Shiva. The right earlobe jewelry and hair decoration in this art work of Dattatreya is of Shiva, but on his left the details are those of Vishnu. Rigopoulos dates this Badami sculpture to be from the 10th to 12th century.

A sculpture similar to Badami, but with some differences, has been discovered in Ajmer (Rajasthan). The Ajmer art work is a free statue where Dattatreya is standing, has one head and four hands. In his various hands, he carries a &quot;Trishula&quot; of Shiva, a &quot;Chakra&quot; of Vishnu, a &quot;Kamandalu&quot; of Brahma, and a rosary common to all three. Like the Badami relief work, the Ajmer iconography of Dattatreya shows the swan of Brahma, the Garuda of Vishnu and the Nandi of Shiva carved on the pedestal with him.

Some scholars such as James Harle and TA Gopinatha Rao consider iconography that presents Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva together as &quot;Hari Hara Pitamaha&quot; to be synonymous with or equivalent to Dattatreya. Antonio Rigopoulos questions this identification, and suggests that &quot;Harihara Pitamaha&quot; iconography may have been a prelude to and something that evolved into Dattatreya iconography.

=== Symbolism ===

The historic Indian literature has interpreted the representation of Dattatreya symbolically. His three heads are symbols of the Gunas (qualities in Samkhya school of Hinduism). The three Gunas are Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. The six hands have ethical symbolism, namely Yamas, Niyama, Sama, Dama, Daya and Shanti (axiology in Yoga and Vedanta school of Hinduism).

The &quot;Kamadhenu&quot; cow is symbolic &quot;Panchabutas&quot;, the four dogs are inner forces of a human being: Iccha, Vasana, Asha and Trishna. In these interpretations, Dattatreya is that yogi Guru (teacher) who has perfected all these, rules them rather than is ruled by them, and is thus the Guru Dattatreya is beyond them.

== Texts ==

The &quot;Dattatreya Upanishad&quot; (tantra-focussed), &quot;Darshana Upanishad&quot; (yoga-focussed) and particularly the &quot;Avadhuta Upanishad&quot; (advaita-focussed) present the philosophy of the Dattatreya tradition. Dattatreya is also mentioned in the classic text on Yoga, the Shandilya Upanishad.

Other Upanishads where Dattatreya&#x27;s name appears in lists of ancient Hindu monks revered for their insights on renunciation are &quot;Jabala Upanishad&quot;, &quot;Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad&quot;, &quot;Bhikshuka Upanishad&quot; and &quot;Yajnavalkya Upanishad&quot;. Of these, his mention in the &quot;Jabala Upanishad&quot; is chronologically significant because this ancient text is dated to have been complete between the 3rd century BCE and 3rd century CE.

&quot;Tripura Rahasya&quot; is also an important ancient text attributed to Dattatreya.

Dattatreya is mentioned in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;

Dattatreya is mentioned in the ancient chapter 9 of the &quot;Sattvata Samhita&quot; and chapter 5 of the &quot;Ahirbudhnya Samhita&quot;, both among the oldest layer of texts in the Vaishnava Agama tradition (Pancaratra). Schrader states these texts and the chronology of Dattatreya are older than the Mahabharata, but Rigopoulos disagrees with him on the chronology.

In the Hindu tradition, Dattatreya is the author of &quot;Avadhuta Gita&quot;, or the &quot;Song of the free&quot;. The text&#x27;s poetry is based on the principles of Advaita Vedanta, one of the subschools of Hindu philosophy.

The extant manuscripts have been dated to approximately the 9th or 10th century, but it may have existed earlier as part of an oral tradition. It consists of 289 &quot;shlokas&quot; (metered verses), divided into eight chapters.

P.P. Vasudevanand Saraswati Tembe Swami Maharaj has written an extensive literature on Lord Dattatreya and his incarnations including Sripada Srivallabha of Pithapur, Andhra Pradesh and Shri Nrusimhsaraswati Swami Maharaj of Ganagapur, Karnataka.

== Dattatreya traditions ==
Several Hindu monastic and yoga traditions are linked to Dattatreya:

* Nath sampradaya: The Nath yogis, that metamorphosed into a warrior ascetic group, consider Dattatreya as their theological founder. This group grew and became particularly prominent during the Islamic invasions and Hindu-Muslim wars in South Asia, from about the 14th to 18th century, although the Dattatreya roots of the peaceful Nath yogis go back to about the 10th century. The group was most active in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Nepal. The tradition believes that the legendary Nath sampradaya yogi and Hatha Yoga innovator Gorakshanath was inspired and shaped by Dattatreya. Regional efforts and texts of the Nath tradition such as &quot;Yogi sampradaya vishkriti&quot; discussed Dattatreya.
* Avadhuta sampradaya: The nine &quot;Narayanas&quot; of the Avadhuta sampradaya are attributed to Dattatreya, an idea also found in the Natha sampradaya. A panth started by Pantmaharaj Balekundrikar of Balekundri near Belgavi is related to this. Also a saint named Shri Prabhakar Keshavrao motiwale follows the same path from years, and also Datt sampradaya is followed in his ashram located at Kanadia, Indore (Madhya Pradesh).
*Dasanami sampradaya and Shakti pithas: Dattatreya is revered in Dasanami and goddess-oriented Shaktism traditions.
* Bhakti traditions: Dattatetreya&#x27;s theology emphasizing simple life, kindness to all, questioning the status quo, self pursuit of knowledge and seeking spiritual meaning of life appealed to Bhakti sant-poets of Hinduism such as Tukaram and Eknath, during an era of political and social upheaval caused by Islamic invasion in the Deccan region of India. They reverentially mentioned Dattatreya in their poems. The use of his symbolism was one of the many syncretic themes of this period where the ideas of Vaishnavism and Shaivism holistically fused in popular imagination.
* Mahanubhava tradition: Along with Krishna, the Mahanubhava tradition considers Dattatreya as their divine inspiration. The Mahanubhava Panth, propagated by Sri Chakradhar Swami, has five Krishnas, of which Dattatreya is one as their Adi Guru (the original Guru), as well as the early teachers in their tradition (Chakradhar, Gundam, Changdev). They worship Dattatreya as single headed with two arms. He has a temple dedicated in Mahur by this tradition.
*Gurucharitra tradition: This tradition is named after the Marathi text &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; consisting of 51 chapters, containing the life stories of 14th-century Datta Avatar Sripada Srivallabha and 15th-century Datta Avatar Narasimha Saraswati. The text was composed by Sarasvati Gangadhara, consists of three sections called Jnanakanda (chapters 1–24), Karmakanda (25–37) and Bhaktikanda (38–51), and is considered a sacred mantra-filled text in the Gurucharita tradition in parts of Maharashtra, north Karnataka and Gujarat. Ganagapur in kalaburagi north Karnataka is an important pilgrimage center in this tradition.
*Manik Prabhu (Sakalamata) Sampradaya: In this tradition, Dattatreya is worshipped with his Shakti, known as Madhumati. This tradition was started by the 19th century saint Shri Manik Prabhu, who is considered an Avatar of Dattatreya. Manik Nagar is the spiritual headquarters of this Sampradaya. Shri Manik Prabhu also established a Guru Parampara at Maniknagar for the spiritual guidance of devotees. Shri Manik Prabhu and his successors have written many abhangas and bhajans in Marathi and Kannada in praise of lord Dattatreya which are regularly sung at Manik Nagar.
* Lal Padris: another Hindu yogi group from western India with roots in the 10th-century and with ideas similar to Nath and Kanphata sampradaya, traces Dattatreya as the basis of their spiritual ideas.
* Around 1550 CE, Dattatreya Yogi taught the Dattatreya philosophy to his disciple Das Gosavi in Marathi. Das Gosavi then taught this philosophy to his two Telugu disciples Gopalbhatt and Sarvaved who studied and translated Das Gosavi&#x27;s book of &quot;Vedantavyavaharsangraha&quot; into Telugu language. According to Prof. R. C. Dhere, Dattatreya Yogi and Das Gosavi are the original gurus in the Telugu Dattatreya tradition. Prof. Venkata Rao states that &quot;Dattatreya Shatakamu&quot; was written by Paramanandateertha who is equally important in his contributions to the Telugu tradition of Dattatreya. He was a proponent of Advaita philosophy and dedicated his two epics, &quot;Anubhavadarpanamu&quot; and &quot;Shivadnyanamanjari&quot; to Shri Dattatreya. His famous &quot;Vivekachintamani&quot; book was translated into Kannada by Nijashivagunayogi and Lingayat saint Shanatalingaswami translated this into Marathi.

<text>The Ford HSC engine is an automobile gasoline engine from the Ford Motor Company, sold from 1984 until 1994. &quot;HSC&quot; stands for High Swirl Combustion. It was made in two displacements: 2.3 L and 2.5 L, and used in only two model lines: the Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz and the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable.

==Development==
In the late 1970s Ford began planning a new smaller front wheel drive (FWD) compact car that became the Ford Tempo. The Tempo was designed to use a four-cylinder engine, but all production of Ford&#x27;s 2.3 L Lima OHC four was committed to other product lines. At the same time, the 1983 end of life of Ford&#x27;s 200 cubic inch Thriftpower Six inline six left unused capacity at the Lima Engine plant. Ford developed a four-cylinder engine that shared some features of the Thriftpower six, topped with a new cylinder head and using other new technologies, while repurposing as much tooling as possible at the Lima plant. To maximize use of existing tooling the new engine shared spindle spacing where possible with the Thriftpower six, resulting in similar cylinder, crankshaft, and tappet bores, as well as crankshaft journal diameters.

Reliability and durability were key design goals for the engine. It was designed for use with an automatic transmission, and was optimized to deliver most of its power at low engine speeds. Extensive efforts were made to reduce losses due to valvetrain friction.

To accelerate development of the combustion chamber shape, a test engine was created using an engine block from a 1980 model year Thriftpower six that was cut, shortened, and brazed together again, resulting in a four-cylinder engine displacing . Since the Tempo&#x27;s front chassis member spacing was the same as the first generation North American Ford Escort, the engine&#x27;s transverse package length had to be minimized, which was done by reducing the deck length between the end cylinder bores and ends of the block.

Camshafts, crankshafts, and connecting rods for the engine were produced at Ford&#x27;s Cleveland Engine Plant #2. Engine assembly took place at Ford&#x27;s Lima plant, suitably upgraded. A new state-of-the-art engine assembly line was built at Ford&#x27;s Chihuahua Engine facility in Chihuahua, Mexico.

When the Tempo was released, a turbocharged version of its new engine was said to be in development, but this configuration never became available.

==Features==
The HSC engine has a cast iron block and head, with a single cam-in-block and two overhead valves (OHV) per cylinder with pushrods and rocker arms.

The cylinder head is a reverse flow design that puts the intake and exhaust ports on the same side of the head. For heat control, the exhaust was mounted on the firewall side of the engine, along with the intake. This left the spark plugs, distributor, fuel pump, oil filter and starter on the front side of the engine, for ease of servicing.

The engine&#x27;s name derives from it being the first &quot;fastburn&quot; engine offered by Ford. The definition of fastburn in the HSC is that 90% of the intake charge is burned within 15° of crankshaft rotation. To accomplish this, Ford put the spark plug in the center of the combustion chamber to minimize flame-propagation distance, and partially shrouded the intake valves, which accelerated and swirled the intake charge to more quickly fill the combustion chamber. These features were borrowed from Ford&#x27;s programmed combustion (PROCO) engine research project.

To reduce weight the intake manifold, water pump, and front cover are aluminum. A die-cast aluminum sump stiffens the entire engine assembly to reduce noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH).

For its first year of production all HSCs used a carburetor. Later model year changes added a series of progressively more sophisticated fuel injection systems. All versions of the HSC engine, including the carbureted ones, are managed by Ford&#x27;s EEC-IV engine control unit (ECU). This model controller added Keep Alive Memory (KAM), which enabled the engine to use adaptive control and self-diagnostics.

From 1985 to 1992 the HSC engine was available in a &quot;High Specific Output&quot; (HSO) version producing and , compared to the regular 1985 version&#x27;s and . To increase power Ford enlarged the ports, reshaped both the ports and combustion chambers, and unshrouded the valves. A camshaft with higher lift and longer duration was added. The intake manifold received larger runners and the air cleaner and exhaust system were redesigned to improve flow. The HSO engine is denoted by an &quot;S&quot; in the VIN.

==2.3 L==
The 2.3 L HSC was introduced in 1984 in the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz. Bore and stroke are , for a total displacement of . This engine produced and of torque.

For 1984 HSC engines for US 50 state cars were fitted with a 1-barrel Holley 6149 carburetor, while cars for Canada received a non-feedback Holley Model 1949. In 1985 American-market engines received Central Fuel Injection (CFI), which reduced power to . Ford addressed the power decrease in the base engine by releasing the HSO version for performance-oriented variants of the Tempo (GLS) and Topaz (LTS/XR5). A switch to multi-port fuel injection in 1988 raised horsepower to . Sequential fuel injection was added for 1992, increasing horsepower to . That same year the HSO variant was dropped, as the sportier versions of the Tempo/Topaz received the 3.0 L Vulcan as standard equipment.

Applications:
* 1984–1994 Ford Tempo
* 1984–1994 Mercury Topaz

==2.5 L==
A 2.5 L HSC version appeared in 1986. Its displacement resulted from its longer stroke. The engine block&#x27;s deck height was raised to from the of the 2.3 L. The extra displacement was deemed necessary for it to serve as a four-cylinder engine option for fleet customers of the new Ford Taurus. This engine used the head and camshaft from the HSO engine and produced and . It sold in low volumes (less than 15% of the HSC engines built) and was costly due to the tooling changeover required for the taller deck height. The earliest 2.5 L came standard with electronic multi-port fuel injection. It received sequential fuel injection in 1991, raising output to and of torque.

Applications:
* 1986–1991 Ford Taurus
* 1986 Mercury Sable

<doc id="1069590" wikidata="Q619632" url="?curid=1069590" title="Aponeurosis">
<text>An aponeurosis (; : aponeuroses) is a flattened tendon by which muscle attaches to bone or fascia. Aponeuroses exhibit an ordered arrangement of collagen fibres, thus attaining high tensile strength in a particular direction while being vulnerable to tensional or shear forces in other directions. They have a shiny, whitish-silvery color, are histologically similar to tendons, and are very sparingly supplied with blood vessels and nerves. When dissected, aponeuroses are papery and peel off by sections. The primary regions with thick aponeuroses are in the ventral abdominal region, the dorsal lumbar region, the ventriculus in birds, and the palmar (palms) and plantar (soles) regions.

==Anatomy==
===Anterior abdominal aponeuroses===
The anterior abdominal aponeuroses are located just superficial to the rectus abdominis muscle. It has for its borders the external oblique, pectoralis muscles, and the latissimus dorsi.

===Posterior lumbar aponeuroses===
The posterior lumbar aponeuroses are situated just on top of the epaxial muscles of the thorax, which are multifidus spinae and sacrospinalis.

===Palmar and plantar aponeuroses and extensor hood===
The palmar aponeuroses occur on the palms of the hands. The extensor hoods are aponeuroses at the back of the fingers.
The plantar aponeuroses occur on the plantar aspect of the foot. They extend from the calcaneal tuberosity then diverge to connect to the bones, ligaments and the dermis of the skin around the distal part of the metatarsal bones.

===Anterior and posterior intercostal membranes===
The anterior and posterior intercostal membranes are aponeuroses located between the ribs and are continuations of the external and internal intercostal muscles, respectively.

===Scalp aponeuroses===
The epicranial aponeurosis, or galea aponeurotica, is a tough layer of dense fibrous tissue which runs from the frontalis muscle anteriorly to the occipitalis posteriorly.

===Pennate muscles and aponeuroses===
Pennate muscles, in which the muscle fibers are oriented at an angle to the line of action, typically have two aponeuroses. Muscle fibers connect one to the other, and each aponeurosis thins into a tendon which attaches to bone at the origin or insertion site.

== Function ==
Like tendons, aponeuroses attached to pennate muscles can be stretched by the forces of muscular contraction, absorbing energy like a spring and returning it when they recoil to unloaded conditions. Also serving as an origin or insertion site for certain muscles e.g latissimus dorsi.

<text>The Degtyaryov machine gun ( literally: &quot;Degtyaryov&#x27;s infantry machine gun&quot;) or DP-27/DP-28 is a light machine gun firing the 7.62×54mmR cartridge that was primarily used by the Soviet Union, with service trials starting in 1927, followed by general deployment in 1928.

Besides being the standard Soviet infantry light machine gun (LMG) during World War II, with various modifications it was used in aircraft as a flexible defensive weapon, and it was equipped on almost all Soviet tanks in WWII as either a flexible bow machine gun or a co-axial machine gun controlled by the gunner. It was improved in 1943 producing the DPM, but it was replaced in 1946 with the RP-46 which improved on the basic DP design by converting it to use belt feed. The DP machine gun was supplemented in the 1950s by the more modern RPD machine gun and entirely replaced in Soviet service by the general purpose PK machine gun in the 1960s.

==Design==
The DP-27 is a light machine gun designed for the Soviet Red Army in the 1920s under the leadership of Vasily Degtyaryov (1880–1949), the first test model being the DP-26. Two test guns were manufactured and fired 5,000 rounds each from September 27–29, 1926, during which weaknesses were discovered in the extractor and firing pin mechanisms. After design improvements, two more guns were made and tested in December 1926, firing 40,000 rounds under adverse conditions, resulting in only .6% stoppages. However, changes to the bolt carrier and the chamber locking mechanism were still required. After this redesign the improved gun, now called the DP-27, was tested by the Red Army at the Kovrov plant on January 17–21 of 1927, passing all tests and being approved for manufacture. A full year of service testing followed, after which the primary requested change was the addition of the large flash suppressor that is now considered one of the recognition features of the design. With further refinements, the DP was to be the primary light machine gun of the Red Army during WWII.

The DP-27 was designed to fire the same 7.62×54mmR (&quot;R&quot; indicating &quot;rimmed&quot;) ammunition as the main Soviet infantry rifle, the Mosin-Nagant, much simplifying ammunition logistics for Soviet infantry units. Of typical Russian design philosophy, the DP-27 was a sturdy and simple gun that was easy and cheap to manufacture, and could be relied upon to perform even in the most adverse conditions; it was capable of withstanding being buried in dirt, mud, or sand and still operating consistently. However, being magazine fed, it had a rate of fire similar to other light machine guns, like the Bren light machine gun, but low when compared to its main wartime rivals, the German MG 34/MG 42 series, firing at a rate of 550rpm as compared to the 800–1,500rpm of the German general-purpose machine guns.

The operating mechanism of the DP-27 is gas-operated, using a Kjellmann-Friberg flap locking design to lock the bolt against the chamber until the round had left the barrel, aided by a recoil spring. Ammunition came in the form of a 47-round circular pan magazine that attached to the top of the receiver. Because of the shape of its magazine, the DP-27 was nicknamed the &quot;record player&quot;.

Its main parts were a removable barrel with an integrated flash suppressor and gas cylinder, a receiver with the rear sight, a perforated barrel shroud/guide with the front sight, the bolt and locking flaps, the bolt carrier and gas piston rod, a recoil spring, stock and trigger mechanism group, a bipod for firing from prone positions, and the previously mentioned pan magazine. In total, the first versions contained only 80 parts, indicating both the simplicity and ease of manufacture of the design. Early versions had 26 transverse cooling fins machined into the barrel, but it was found that these had little cooling effect and so were deleted in 1938, further easing manufacture.

The design had weaknesses that would eventually be addressed in later variants. The pan magazines were prone to damage, while also being difficult and time-consuming to reload. The bipod mechanism was weak and likely to fail if not handled with care. Replacing the barrel was not a quick operation due to a lack of handle and the amount of disassembly needed, though a well trained crew could do so in 30 seconds under ideal conditions. The open gas chamber and bolt frame could accumulate dust in sandy conditions, clogging the gas piston. The recoil spring&#x27;s location near the barrel led to overheating, causing it to lose proper spring temper.

==Designation==
The Degtyaryov machine gun was accepted for Red Army service in 1927 with the official designation 7,62-мм ручной пулемет обр. 1927 г (7.62mm Hand-Held Machine Gun Model 1927). It was called the ДП-27 (DP-27), although some western sources refer to it as the DP-28.

==Service use==
Despite its numerous problems, the DP had a reputation as a relatively effective light support weapon. It was nicknamed the &quot;Record player&quot; (proigryvatel&#x27;) by Red Army troops because of its rotating disc-shaped pan magazine.

The first uses of the DP-27 in war where with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. On 25 October 1936 the SS Kursk docked at Cartegena, delivering 150 Degtaryov machine guns along with 9,000 Winchester Model 1895 rifles. The Cabo Palos delivered 3 DT tank machine guns on 7 May 1937. On 7 February 1938 the SS Bonafacio arrived in Bassens and included numerous weapons in its cargo delivery, including DP &amp; DT machine guns.

Many were captured by the Finnish army in the Winter War and the Continuation War and partially replaced the Lahti-Saloranta M/26. The DP received the nickname &quot;Emma&quot; in Finnish service after a popular waltz, again due to the magazine&#x27;s resemblance to a record player. In the summer of 1944, the Finnish army had about 3400 Finnish-made Lahti-Salorantas and 9,000 captured Soviet-made Degtyarevs on the front. Captured examples were operated by the Volkssturm, the late-war German militia, and in German service the Degtyarev received the designation &quot;Leichtes Maschinengewehr&quot; 120(&quot;r&quot;).

The Chinese Nationalists received 5,600 DPs from the USSR and used them in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War. The North Korean and Chinese Communists used the DP in the Korean War and copied the DPM as the Type 53.

Examples of all variants of the DP machine gun were given or sold to the Viet Minh in the First Indochina War by the USSR and Chinese Communists. Similarly, in the Vietnam War to the NVA and Vietcong.

DPMs have also been recovered from Taliban fighters during the War in Afghanistan while DPs or DPMs have been spotted in 2014 in the Northern Mali conflict. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a few of the backline Ukrainian forces were issued surplus DPMs.

==Variants==

* DPM, modernized version adopted in 1943–44, with a more robust bipod fastened to the cooling jacket and the recoil spring housed in a tube projecting from the rear of the receiver which necessitated a pistol grip for this model of the weapon (manufactured in China as the Type 53)
* DA, for mounting and loading in aircraft (Дегтярёва авиационный, &quot;Degtyaryova Aviatsionny&quot;; ДА). Also used in tandem mounts known as DA-2. Employed in the early versions of the Tupolev TB-3 bomber and in the Polikarpov R-5 and Polikarpov Po-2 army cooperation aircraft. The DA weighed 7.1 kg empty and 11.5 kg with standard ammunition load. Its rate of fire was 600 rounds per minute. It was built between 1928 and March 1930 with 1,200 units delivered. It was soon superseded by the ShKAS, which had a much higher rate of fire.
* DT and DTM, for mounting and loading in armoured fighting vehicles (Дегтярёва танковый, &quot;Degtyaryova Tankovy&quot;; ДТ and ДТМ)
* DTM-4, (ДТМ-4) quad mounted variant.

* RP-46 ( - company machine gun): metallic-belt fed version adopted in 1946 with a heavier barrel to allow prolonged sustained fire. About 500 rounds could be fired continuously before the barrel had to be swapped or allowed to cool down. Also had a user-adjustable gas system, with three holes of varying diameters provided, to cope with varying environmental conditions and residue buildup. Although the empty weight of the RP-46 exceeded that of DP by 2.5 kg, when considered together with a single ammo box of 250 rounds, the RP-46 weighed 10 kg less than the DP together with the same amount of ammunition in DP pans. The RP-46 remained in Soviet service for 15 years before it was replaced (together with the SGM) by the PK machine gun. The RP-46 was later manufactured in China as the Type 58 and in North Korea as the Type 64. The RP-46 could still fire from DP-style magazines by removing its belt-feeding system.

<text>The Potamogetonaceae, commonly referred to as the pondweed family, is an aquatic family of monocotyledonous flowering plants. The roughly 110 known species are divided over six genera. The largest genus in the family by far is &quot;Potamogeton&quot;, which contains about 100 species.

The family has a subcosmopolitan distribution, and is considered to be one of the most important angiosperm groups in the aquatic environment because of its use as food and habitat for aquatic animals.

==Taxonomy==

The Potamogetonaceae are currently placed in the early diverging monocot order Alismatales by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. Their concept of the family includes the plants sometimes treated in the separate family Zannichelliaceae, but excludes the genus &quot;Ruppia&quot;. So circumscribed, the family currently consists of six genera: &quot;Althenia&quot;, &quot;Groenlandia&quot;, &quot;Lepilaena&quot;, &quot;Potamogeton&quot;, &quot;Stuckenia&quot;, and &quot;Zannichellia&quot;, totalling about 120 species of perennial aquatic plants.

Marine grasses families: Zosteraceae, Cymodoceaceae, Ruppiaceae and Posidoniaceae. Related families: Potamogetonaceae, Zannichelliaceae (not consistently).

==Characteristics==

The plants are all aquatic perennial herbs, often with creeping rhizomes and leafy branches. Their leaf blades can be either floating or submerged, and their stems are often joined. No stomata are present on the leaves. The flowers are tetramerous: the floral formula (sepals; petals; stamens; carpels) is [4;0;4;4]. The flowers have no petals. The fruit consists of one to four drupelets or achenes.

==Genera==
*&quot;Althenia&quot;
*&quot;Groenlandia&quot;
*&quot;Lepilaena&quot;
*&quot;Potamogeton&quot;
*&quot;Pseudalthenia&quot;
*&quot;Stuckenia&quot;

<doc id="1069594" wikidata="Q494249" url="?curid=1069594" title="TT pistol">
<text>The TT-30, commonly known simply as the Tokarev, is a Soviet semi-automatic pistol. It was developed during the late 1920s by Fedor Tokarev as a service pistol for the Soviet Armed Forces and was based on the earlier pistol designs of John Moses Browning, albeit with detail modifications to simplify production and maintenance. The Soviet Union ceased production of the TT in 1954, although derivatives of the pistol continued to be manufactured for many years in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

==Development==

Before 1930, the Soviet Union used a large variety of foreign-made semi-automatic pistols including: FN M1900, FN M1903, FN M1905, M1921 &quot;Bolo&quot; Mauser, and the Colt M1911, besides the Nagant M1895 revolver. In an attempt to simplify production, the Soviet Artillery Committee (which also oversaw small arms designs) decided to adopt a 7.62 mm pistol caliber, allowing Mosin-Nagant rifle barrels to be cut down to make pistols and submachine gun barrels. In 1930, the Red Army conducted trials to select a new standard-issue pistol and Tokarev&#x27;s design was tested against upscaled versions of the Korovin pistol, and Sergei Aleksandrovich Prilutsky&#x27;s 1920−1921 self-loading design as well as foreign pistols. Tokarev&#x27;s design, considered to be lighter, more accurate and reliable than its competitors (despite being harder to disassemble), was adopted as the Tula-Tokarev Model 1930, even though the pistol would only be officially adopted on the next year.

After being accepted for service, the TT-30 was modified, primarily to simplify the manufacturing process, such as making the back strap an integral part of the frame instead of being a separate piece, reducing machining time. The newly improved pistol received the designation TT-33.

== Design details ==

Externally, the TT-33 is very similar to John Browning&#x27;s blowback operated FN Model 1903 pistol, and internally it uses Browning&#x27;s short recoil tilting-barrel system from the M1911 pistol. In other areas the TT-33 differs more from Browning&#x27;s designs—it employs a much simpler hammer/sear assembly than the M1911. This assembly is removable from the pistol as a modular unit and includes machined magazine feed lips, preventing misfeeds when a damaged magazine is loaded into the magazine well. The magazines themselves can be disassembled for cleaning, another measure to prevent malfunctions.

The pistol lacks an external safety and is usually carried with a round loaded and the hammer half-cocked. The safest method for carrying the TT-33 is to leave the chamber empty, though it requires the slide to be manually pulled back and released to ready the gun for use, which takes some effort due the relatively stiff recoil spring.

The TT-33 is chambered for the 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridge, which was itself based on the similar 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge used in the Mauser C96 pistol. The 7.62×25mm cartridge is powerful, has an extremely flat trajectory, and is capable of penetrating thick clothing and soft body armor. Despite the power of the 7.62 mm round, the TT-33 has a relatively mild recoil.

Although the Tokarev was mass produced for the Red Army, the Soviet Union continued producing Nagant 1895 revolvers during World War II due the material demands of the war and the shortcomings of the TT-33, such as being less suitable to fire through a tank viewport, the magazines could be released accidentally, stress on the firing pin decreased the pistol service life. Due the lack of an external safety, cavalry units including Cossacks carried Nagants as sidearms instead.

As early as 1938, the Soviets mulled on a replacement for the TT-33, and trials were conducted. After testing several designs, including a submission from Tokarev, a 18-round design chambered for the 7.62 mm round by Pavel V. Voyevodin was chosen, but development was halted after the Germans launched Operation Barbarossa.

Early production TTs have a high-quality black or dark blue finish, while wartime models (1942−1945) have rougher finish and wooden grips instead of rubber, while in some examples the lanyard ring on the bottom of the magazine was omitted. A total of 1,059,687 pistols were built during World War II, while approximately 46,000 were built post-war: these pistols have improved finish and grips similar to pre-war models. They also feature a slightly taller rear sight and narrow serrations on the rear of the slide.

== Variants ==
===Soviet Union / Russia===

*TT-30: Original model, adopted by the Soviet Union as stardard military pistol in 1931 it is estimated that 93,000 pistols were built until 1936.
*TT-33: A modified and simplified version of the TT-30, it was replaced by the Makarov pistol. A civilian version of the T-33 was offered in the 2010s by the Molot Machine Building Plant. These pistols are externally similar to the original, but are chambered for 10×33mm cartridges containing a single rubber ball of diameter for self-defense purposes.
*TT-3: Training pistol chambered for .22 long rifle, it apparently never got past prototype stage.
*TT-4: Virtually identical to the TT-4, but with a longer barrel. Apparently never got past prototype stage.

===China===
*Type 51: A virtually identical copy of the TT-33, except for the Chinese markings on the left rear of the frame or on the top of the slide. According to Thompson, the barrels aren&#x27;t chrome-lined. Over 235,000 were produced between 1951 and 1954.
*Type 54: Replaced the Type 51 in 1954. Roughly 420,000 were produced until 1985. Up to 50,000 Type 54s were exported to North Vietnam.
*M20: Basically a Type 54 with no markings for clandestine operations. At least some were supplied to the Viet Cong and the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN). It&#x27;s estimated that less than 50,000 were made.
*TU-20
*Model 213: Export model by Norinco, it&#x27;s a Type 54 fitted with an external safety and chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum round.
*Model 213A: A Model 213 with a 14-round box magazine.
*Model 213B: A Model 213 with a wrap-around grip to improve ergonomics.
*NP-10: Export model with interchangeable barrels. It can fire 7.62×25mm, 9×19mm, and .38 Super cartridges.
*NP-15: Export 9×19mm model with three white dot sights and a black rubber grip.
*NP-17: Export target-shooting 9×19mm pistol with a barrel and muzzle brake.

===Hungary===

*M48: Also commonly known as the 48M, the Pisztoly 48 Minta is a licensed copy of the TT-33 produced by Fegyver- és Gépgyár (FÉG) from 1948 until 1958. They can be identified by the Rákosi or Kádár crest on the grips. About 100,000 were manufactured.
*Tokagypt 58: An export version for Egypt chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum round which was widely used by police forces there. After receiving less than half of the 30,000 pistols ordered, Egypt cancelled its order. The remaining pistols were sold commercially by FÉG. They were purchased by American arms dealers who planned to resell them under the &quot;Firebird&quot; brand, but after the United States government rescinded the import licenses, the Firebirds ended up being sold in the European market instead, finding their way to Middle Eastern insurgent groups, the Baader-Meinhof Group, ETA, and FP-25. Tokagypts differ from the M48 by an external thumb safety, an ergonomic wraparound grip, and a magazine with a finger rest.

===North Korea===
*Type 66/68: also known as the M68, it was produced at the Chongyul Arms Plant and can be distinguished from the TT-33 by the shorter barrel, and the serrations on the rear of the slide, intended to give the shooter a grip while the gun is being cocked. Other differences include a magazine catch on the base of the grip, a tilting-barrel system similar to the Browning Hi-Power, a modified firing pin and reinforced slide stop. TT-33 magazines can be used on the Type 68, but not vice versa. During the 1980s the Type 68 was gradually replaced by the Baek Du San pistol, a North Korean copy of the Czechoslovak CZ 75 pistol.

===Pakistan===

*Khyber Pass copy: Both legal and illegal TT pistols are still manufactured in various Pakistani Khyber Pass factories. Quality greatly varies, with some individual copies being almost indistinguishable from the original. These copies usually can be identified by the incorrect markings or crude finish. Due the high pressure generated by the 7.62×25mm cartridge and the often poor quality of the steel and heat treatment of these copies, they can be dangerous to fire.

===Poland===

*wz. 1933: A licensed copy designated as Pistolet wzór 1933, about 225,500 pistols were produced by FB &quot;Łucznik&quot; Radom from 1948 until 1955 following a limited production run in 1946−1947. It was replaced by the FB P-64 in 1967, though the wz. 1933 remained in limited service until the 1990s.
*TT Sportowy: .22 caliber training pistol

===Romania===

*TTC: Designated as the Tula Tokarev Cugir, it was produced by the Cugir Arms Factory. The first prototype was made in 1951, with mass production continuing until 1957. The TTC was adopted by the Romanian military in 1952 and remained in service (alongside with police units) until the late 1990s. 155,648 pistols were produced in total. Of these, about 30,000 were exported to Syria and Iraq, while a few thousand more were sold to other foreign customers.

===Vietnam===
*K-54VN: A locally produced copy made by Z111 Factory to replace and refurbish the aging Type 54 (designated as K-54 by the Vietnamese) pistols in service.
*K14: An upgraded version of the K-54VN also made by Z111 Factory, it has a barrel longer, an increased capacity of 13 rounds, with a wider grip to incorporate a double stack magazine. In early October 2014, the PAVN received 50 pistols for trials.

=== Yugoslavia / Serbia ===

*M57: The Zastava Model M57 is an improved copy of the TT-33 made by Zastava Arms, with a longer grip to accommodate a 9-round magazine (as opposed to the TT&#x27;s eight), and a magazine safety, though the bore is not chromed. Around 260,000−270,000 pistols were produced between 1963 and 1982, with a separate run of pistols made for Croatia. 
*M70: Not to be confused with the blowback M70 pistol also produced by Zastava, it&#x27;s a M57 chambered for the 9×19mm cartridge. It uses a six-groove rifling instead of four.
*M70A: An improved version of the M70, it features a slide-mounted safety catch which locks the firing pin.
*M70: A blowback-operated pistol chambered for the .32 ACP cartridge, it features a manual safety to lock the firing mechanism and an automatic safety that blocks the sear when the magazine is removed.
*M70(k): A blowback pistol identical to the M70, but chambered for the .380 ACP cartridge.
*M88: A compact and modernized version of the M70 9×19mm pistol with a 8-round magazine. While it largely retains the Tokarev operating mechanism, externally it bears little resemblance to the TT-33. It features a frame-mounted safety.
*Zastava M88A: Virtually identical to the M88, but with a safety catch mounted on the rear of the slide, which not only blocks the firing pin, but also interrupts the link between trigger and hammer as well.

==Service history==

The TT-33 was primarily issued to officers, though some enlisted non-commissioned officers and specialists (such as snipers) were also issued with handguns as well. Cavalry units carried the Nagant 1895 revolver instead, since the lack of an external safety on the TT pistol presented a risk to both horse and rider.

While the TT-33 was used in small numbers during the Spanish Civil War, the first major use of the Tokarev pistol was during the Winter War against Finland. The Finns managed to capture a number of TT-33 pistols and PPD submachine guns, which they used until they run out 7.62 mm Tokarev ammunition.

During World War II, both the Germans and the Finns made use of captured TT-33 pistols, though the former had the advantage of making use of the 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge, which can be loaded in TT pistols (though the 7.62×25mm Tokarev cannot be fired in weapons chambered for the 7.63 mm round due the increased pressure of the Soviet cartridge). Captured pistols were re-issued to German troops as the Pistole 615(r).

After the war, the TT-33 was gradually replaced in Soviet military and police service by the Makarov pistol, though some pistols remained in use into the 21st century. China, North Korea, and Vietnam received substantial number of TT-33s and used them alongside Chinese-made copies during the Korean War and Vietnam War. Surplus Soviet pistols were also supplied in quantity to African countries as military aid. According to Thompson, over 60 countries used TT-33 pistols, with eight countries mass producing TT-33 copies or pistols based on the Tokarev design. Some insurgent groups in the Middle East also managed to obtain a large number of pistols, including some Hungarian-made Tokagypt 58s originally intended to arm the Nasser regime after the Eisenhower administration refused to sell arms to Egypt. Tokagypt 58s were a staple of the Red Army Faction arsenal, and founding members Ulrike Meinhof and Andreas Baader were taught how to shoot at an Arab training camp in Jordan with Tokagypts. Spanish and Portuguese armed groups such as the ETA and FP-25 also obtained a large number of Tokagypts.

During the Soviet-Afghan War, the Afghan mujahideen made use of pistols captured from the Soviets and Khyber Pass copies of the Tokarev and Makarov obtained from Pakistan as well.

<text>Sir David Ferrier FRS (13 January 1843 – 19 March 1928) was a pioneering Scottish neurologist and psychologist. Ferrier conducted experiments on the brains of animals such as monkeys and in 1881 became the first scientist to be prosecuted under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876 which had been enacted following a major public debate over vivisection.

==Life==

Ferrier was born in Woodside, Aberdeen, and educated at Aberdeen Grammar School before studying for an MA at Aberdeen University (graduated 1863). As a medical student, he began to work as a scientific assistant to the influential free-thinking philosopher and psychologist Alexander Bain (1818–1903), one of the founders of associative psychology. 

Around 1860, psychology was finding its scientific foundation mainly in Germany, with the rigorous research of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894), who had trained as a physicist, and of Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920). They focused their work mainly in the area of sensory psychophysics. Both worked at the University of Heidelberg. In 1864, Bain prompted Ferrier to spend some time in their laboratories.

On returning to Scotland, Ferrier graduated in medicine in 1868 at the University of Edinburgh. A few years later, in 1870, he moved into London and started work as a neuropathologist at the King&#x27;s College Hospital and at the National Hospital for Paralysis and Epilepsy, Queen Square. The latter – now the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery – was the first hospital in England to be dedicated to the treatment of neurological diseases and has a David Ferrier ward named in his memory.

At that period, the great neurologist John Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911) worked in the same hospital as Ferrier. Jackson was refining his concepts of the sensorimotor functions of the nervous system, derived from clinical experience. Jackson proposed that there was an anatomical and physiological substrate for the localization of brain functions, which was hierarchically organized.

Influenced by Jackson who became a close friend and mentor, Ferrier decided to embark on an experimental program. It aimed to extend the results of two German physiologists, Eduard Hitzig (1838–1907) and Gustav Fritsch (1837–1927). 

In 1870, they had published results on localized electrical stimulation of the motor cortex in dogs. Ferrier wanted also to test Jackson&#x27;s idea that epilepsy had a cortical origin, as it was suggested by his clinical observations.

Coincidentally, Ferrier had received a proposal to direct the laboratory of experimental neurology at the Stanley Royd Hospital, a psychiatric hospital located in Yorkshire. The hospital&#x27;s director was the psychiatrist James Crichton-Browne (1840–1938). Working under good material conditions and having an abundance of animals for experimentation (mainly rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs), Ferrier started his experiments in 1873, examining experimental lesions and electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex. Upon his return to London, the Royal Society sponsored the extension of his stimulation experiments to macaque monkeys, work he undertook at the Brown Institution in Lambeth. By the end of the year, he had reported his first results to local and national meetings and had published an account in the enormously influential &quot;West Riding Lunatic Asylum Medical Reports&quot;.

Ferrier had succeeded in demonstrating, in a spectacular manner, that the low intensity faradic stimulation of the cortex in both animal species indicated a rather precise and specific map for motor functions. The same areas, upon being lesioned, caused the loss of the functions which were elicited by stimulation. Ferrier was also able to demonstrate that the high-intensity stimulation of motor cortical areas caused repetitive movements in the neck, face and members which were highly evocative of epileptic fits seen by neurologists in human beings and animals, which probably were due to a spread of the focus of stimulation, an interpretation very much in line with Jacksonanian thought.

These – and other investigations in the same line – resulted in international fame for Ferrier and assured his permanent place as one of the greatest experimental neurologists. 

In June 1876, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society at the age of 33 and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians the following year. He was also the first physiologist to make an audacious (if scientifically incorrect) transposition of cortical maps obtained in monkeys to the human brain. This proposal soon led to practical consequences in neurology and neurosurgery. 

A Scottish surgeon, Sir William Macewen (1848–1924), and two English physicians (clinical neurologist Hughes Bennett, and Rickman J. Godlee) demonstrated in 1884, that it was possible to use a precise clinical examination to determine the possible site of a tumor or lesion in the brain, by observing its effects on the side and extension of alterations in motor and sensory functions. This method of functional neurological mapping is still used today. Jackson and Ferrier were present at the first operation performed by Godlee on 25 November 1884. Godlee was a nephew of the eminent physician Sir Joseph Lister (1827–1912), the discoverer of surgical antisepsis.

Practical results of animal research were used to justify Ferrier before a noisy public persecution carried out by antivivisectionist societies against him and other scientists, who were accused of inhumane use of animals for experimental medicine. In 1892, Ferrier was one of the founding members of the &quot;National Society for the Employment of Epileptics&quot; (now the National Society for Epilepsy), along with Sir William Gowers and John Hughlings Jackson.

==Death==

He died of pneumonia on 19 March 1928 in London. He left a widow, Constance (née Waterlow, sister of painter Ernest Albert Waterlow), and a son and daughter. His son Claude was a well-known architect.

==Works==

Of Ferrier&#x27;s publications, two books are particularly notable. The first one, published in 1876, &quot;The Functions of the Brain&quot;, describes his experimental results and became very influential in the succeeding years, in such a way that today it is considered one of the classics of neuroscience. 

In 1886, he published a new edition, considerably expanded and reviewed. The second book, which was published two years later – &quot;The Localization of Brain Disease&quot; – had as its subject the clinical applications of cortical localization. 

Together with his friends Hughlings Jackson and Crichton-Browne, Ferrier was one of the founders of the journal &quot;Brain&quot; in 1878, which was dedicated to the interaction between experimental and clinical neurology and is still published today. In that year Ferrier delivered the Goulstonian Lecture to the Royal College of Physicians on &quot;The localisation of cerebral diseases&quot;.

<text>Siegen () is a city in Germany, in the south Westphalian part of North Rhine-Westphalia.

It is located in the district of Siegen-Wittgenstein in the Arnsberg region. The university town (nearly 20,000 students in the 2018–2019 winter semester) is the district seat, and is ranked as a &quot;higher centre&quot; in the South Westphalian urban agglomeration.

In 1975, municipal reforms and amalgamations lifted Siegen&#x27;s population above the 100,000 mark.

==Geography==

===Location===
The city of Siegen lies in the basin of the upper reaches of the river Sieg. From there, lateral valleys branch off in many directions. The heights of the surrounding mountains, wherever they are not actually settled, are covered in coppice. To the north lies the Sauerland, to the northwest the Rothaargebirge and to the southwest the Westerwald.

The nearest cities to Siegen, taking into account average travelling distances, are Hagen to the north , Frankfurt am Main to the southeast , Koblenz to the southwest and Cologne to the west .

As the crow flies the distances to these places are, however, (Hagen), (Frankfurt), (Koblenz) and (Cologne).

The city lies on the German-Dutch holiday road called the Orange Route, joining towns, cities and regions associated with the House of Orange.

===City area===

The city&#x27;s total land area is roughly . Its greatest east-west span is about , and its greatest north-south span is about . City limits are long. Siegen lies at a median elevation of above sea level. The city&#x27;s greatest elevation is the peak of the Pfannenberg at above sea level at southern city limits. Siegen&#x27;s lowest point is above sea level at Niederschelden at southwestern city limits, which there also forms the state boundary with Rhineland-Palatinate. Roughly 60% of the city&#x27;s land is wooded, making Siegen one of Germany&#x27;s greenest cities.

The city area is divided into six zones, called &quot;Bezirke&quot; in German and comparable to boroughs in some cities, which themselves are further divided into various communities (&quot;Ortsteile&quot; and &quot;Stadtteile&quot;). Each &quot;borough&quot; has a borough board consisting of 15 voting and 15 non-voting members who are appointed by city council with regard to each party&#x27;s share of the vote in the municipal elections in the borough in question. The borough boards decide on matters particular to their respective boroughs. These matters are laid down in Siegen&#x27;s city charter.

====Administrative division====
Siegen&#x27;s six boroughs and communities belonging to each boroughs are:
*District I (Geisweid): Birlenbach, Meiswinkel, Langenholdinghausen, Geisweid, Dillnhütten, Sohlbach, Buchen, Niedersetzen, Obersetzen
*District II (Weidenau):
*District III (Ost): Kaan-Marienborn, parts of Alt-Siegen (Giersberg), Bürbach, Volnsberg, Breitenbach, Feuersbach
*District IV (Mitte): Alt-Siegen &quot;(parts not belonging to borough III or V)&quot;
*District V (West): Seelbach, Trupbach and parts of Alt-Siegen (Wellersberg, Fischbacherberg, Achenbach, Rothenberg)
*District VI (Süd): Oberschelden, Gosenbach, Niederschelden, Eiserfeld, Eisern

Along with the boroughs and communities into which the city is divided, as mandated by law, there are also further subdivisions within the communities, each with its own name, but none with distinctly clear borders. They are called &quot;Quartiere&quot;, which can be rendered as &quot;quarters&quot; or &quot;neighbourhoods&quot;. Examples of these include the Unterstadt, the Oberstadt, Hammerhütte, Lindenberg, Charlottental, Haardter Berg (with the university) and the Alte Dreisbach. Some neighbourhoods even straddle community boundaries, like Sieghütte, parts of which can be found in both Siegen-Mitte and Weidenau. Moreover, some neighbourhoods even overlap each other. Unlike the boroughs (&quot;Bezirke&quot;) or communities (&quot;Ortsteile&quot; and &quot;Stadtteile&quot;), the &quot;Quartiere&quot; have no statistical or administrative importance. They do, however, serve some function as to their inhabitants&#x27; identity, but more practically than that, they are also useful for finding one&#x27;s way with a city map and using in bus route names and on public notices and traffic signs. Many of the &quot;Hüttentalstraße&quot; city Autobahn&#x27;s exits are also named after the &quot;Quartiere&quot; that they serve.

The communities of Weidenau, Geisweid, Birlenbach, Langenholdinghausen, Buchen, Sohlbach, Dillnhütten, Niedersetzen, Obersetzen and Meiswinkel formed from 1 July 1966 to 31 December 1974 the town of Hüttental. The communities of Eiserfeld, Eisern, Gosenbach, Niederschelden and Oberschelden formed the town of Eiserfeld between those same two dates.

===Neighbouring communities===
The city of Siegen borders in the north on the town of Kreuztal and the community of Wenden, in the east on the town of Netphen, in the southeast on the community of Wilnsdorf, in the south on the community of Neunkirchen, in the west on the community of Mudersbach (Altenkirchen in Rhineland-Palatinate) and in the northwest on the town of Freudenberg.

==History==
&lt;section begin=SiegenHistory /&gt;
The name Siegen comes from the possibly Celtic river name Sieg. It is, however, unclear whether there is any relation between this name and the Celtic-Germanic Sicambri (Ger. &quot;Sugambrer&quot;) people, who in pre-Christian times lived in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia. The first documentary mention of the place called &quot;Sigena&quot; dates from 1079. The city&#x27;s history is markedly shaped by mining, which locally began as far back as La Tène times. Bearing witness to this longtime industry are the many mines that can be found within city limits.

In 1224, Siegen is mentioned as a newly built town whose ownership was shared by the Count of Nassau, Heinrich the Rich, and Engelbert II of Berg, Archbishop of Cologne after the latter transferred one half of the ownership to the former. Moreover, there is proof that the &quot;Oberes Schloss&quot; (&quot;upper stately home&quot;) was already standing at this time. On 19 October 1303, the town was granted &quot;Soester Stadtrecht&quot;, or Soest town rights. The town remained under the two overlords&#x27; joint ownership until 1 February 1381, only then passing fully into Nassau hands.

In the 16th century, the town of Siegen bore a formidable defensive look. It was surrounded by mighty walls with 16 towers and three town gates, and was home to a great castle. The town was stricken several times by townwide fires. Documents record such fires in 1592, and from 10 to 20 April 1695.

In 1536, Heinrich the Rich built a &quot;paedagogium&quot; in the buildings that had once housed a Franciscan Monastery. It later grew into today&#x27;s Gymnasium at Siegen&#x27;s &quot;Löhrtor&quot; (gate). John VII of Nassau-Siegen (&quot;John the Middle&quot;) built the &quot;Unteres Schloss&quot; (&quot;lower stately home&quot;) on the site of an old Franciscan Monastery. In 1616, John VII founded a knightly war school in the still standing old armoury on Burgstraße, &quot;expressly to produce an officer corps for Calvinism&quot;.

His son John VIII (&quot;The Younger&quot;) returned in 1612 to the Roman Catholic Church, and wanted to use force to make the townsfolk also convert back to Roman Catholicism. In 1632, Nassau-Siegen was conquered by the Swedes, after which his half-brother John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, the Dutch commander in Brazil, re-introduced Protestantism. John VIII died in 1638 and was succeeded by his only son Johan Frans Desideratus, who had to cede part of Nassau-Siegen (north of the Sieg river) to the Protestant branch of the family.

John Maurice&#x27;s leadership served in 1650–1651 to bring about a split in the Siegerland along denominational lines. Under Wilhelm Hyacinth of Nassau-Siegen, violence broke out between the two denominational groups. When on 29 March 1707 townsman Friedrich Flender was killed, Wilhelm Hyacinth was himself unseated and furthermore driven out of the town. Wilhelm Hyacinth was the last in the line of Nassau-Siegen&#x27;s Catholic rulers, dying in 1743. Already in 1734, though, the Reformed line had died out, too, with Friedrich Wilhelm&#x27;s death, leading Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor to transfer power in the territory to the Prince of Orange and the Prince of Nassau-Diez. Under their leadership, mining, the main source of wealth, blossomed, along with agriculture and silviculture. When Prince William of Orange refused to join the Confederation of the Rhine, founded by Napoleon, he found himself unseated by the French leader and the Siegerland passed to the Grand Duchy of Berg. After Napoleon&#x27;s downfall in 1813, however, William I regained his former German inheritances, but in 1815 he ceded them to the Kingdom of Prussia for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Siegen was assigned to the Siegen district, first in the Koblenz region, and as of 1817 in the Arnsberg region within the Prussian Province of Westphalia.

Under Prussian rule, Siegen developed into the South Westphalian centre that it is today. On 1 March 1923, Siegen was set apart from the district bearing its name, and became a district-free town, while still keeping its function as seat of the district of which it was no longer part, and which was itself merged with Wittgenstein district under district reform in 1975. Siegen also lost its district-free status at this time, becoming part of the new Siegen-Wittgenstein district, the name that the district has borne since 1984.

During World War II, Siegen was repeatedly bombed by the Allies owing to a crucial railroad that crossed through the town. On 1 April 1945, the US 8th Infantry Division began the Allied ground assault against Siegen and the dominating military-significant high ground north of the river. The battle against determined German forces at Siegen continued through 2 April 1945, until organized resistance was finally overwhelmed by the division on 3 April 1945.&lt;section end=SiegenHistory /&gt;

===Religion===
The town of Siegen belonged in the beginning to the Archbishopric of Mainz, or more precisely to its deaconry of Arfeld. There was a White Nun convent in town that folded in the 15th century. Furthermore, there was a Franciscan Monastery that was dissolved in 1533 after the Nassau overlords had introduced the Reformation in 1530. After that, the town was first Lutheran, but in 1550, the Principality of Nassau converted to the Reformed Church. Subsequently, Siegen was a predominantly Protestant town, but not so strongly that the Counterreformation could not gain ground in 1623, with one fifth of the townsfolk and those living in the surrounding area becoming Catholic once again. As of 1626, there was once more a monastery in town, this time a Jesuit one. After passing to Prussia in 1815, the union between Lutheran and Reformed churches was introduced in Siegen, as it was throughout Prussia, but the town&#x27;s parishes kept their Reformed emphasis. As part of the Westphalian Provincial Church (now the Church of Westphalia), Siegen became the seat of a Superintendency. A similar entity still exists in Siegen, known as the &quot;Kirchenkreis&quot;, or church district, to which all the city&#x27;s parishes nowadays belong, unless they are Free Church parishes. This church district encompasses the whole of South Westphalia all the way to Olpe.

The town&#x27;s Catholics, even after the Reformation, still belonged to the Archbishopric of Mainz. With the restructuring of the Catholic Church early in the 19th century, Siegen was assigned to the Archbishopric of Paderborn and became the seat of a district synod, today a deaconry, to which all the district&#x27;s Catholic parishes belong. Paderborn was raised to Archbishopric in 1929.

Besides the Roman Catholic Church, Siegen also has a Greek Orthodox parish and a Romanian Orthodox parish.

Moreover, there are various free churches established in Siegen, among them several Evangelical Free Church parishes (Baptists), an Evangelical-Methodist Church, an Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church (SELK), a Seventh-day Adventist parish, several Free Evangelical parishes (FeG), the Achenbach Christian Community, the Christian Assembly, Calvary Chapel and the Siegen-Meiswinkel Mission Community.

Further religious communities in Siegen are the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the New Apostolic Church, the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, an Original Christianity community and Baháʼí. Moreover, owing to a great number of Turkish and Arab migrants in Siegen, the Muslim community is also very much in evidence there and there are several mosques in Siegen run by Turkish, Arab and Albanian communities. There are said to be more than 15,000 Muslims out of Siegen&#x27;s total population.

===Municipal reform===
The following communities and rural areas have been amalgamated with Siegen:

*1902 and 1912: parts of Buschgotthardshütten
*1934: parts of Achenbach
*1937: parts of Achenbach and Buschgotthardshütten
*1966: Trupbach, Seelbach, Breitenbach, Bürbach, Kaan-Marienborn and Volnsberg
*1969: Feuersbach
*1974: towns of Hüttental and Eiserfeld

===Population development===
In 1897, Siegen had 20,000 inhabitants. By 1939, this figure had doubled to 40,000. In the World War II, the town lost roughly 30% of its inhabitants (12,000). The population had fallen to 28,000 by 1945 and only in 1952 did it once again reach prewar levels.

On 1 January 1975, Siegen&#x27;s population surpassed 100,000 through the amalgamation of Hüttental (38,867 inhabitants in 1974) and Eiserfeld (22,354 inhabitants in 1974), making it a city. With 117,224 inhabitants it also at the same time reached its all-time highest population. At the end of June 2005, according to the North Rhine-Westphalia State Office for Data Processing and Statistics (&quot;Landesamt für Datenverarbeitung und Statistik Nordrhein-Westfalen&quot;), 105,328 people made Siegen their main abode. Since 1975, the population has fallen by roughly 10% (12,000).

The following chart shows population figures for Siegen&#x27;s municipal area, however big it was at each given time. Up to 1833, most figures are estimates, and thereafter census figures (¹) or official estimates by the statistical office of the time or the town/city administration itself. The given figures indicate from 1843 the &quot;population present in the town&quot; (&quot;Ort Anwesende Bevölkerung&quot;), from 1925 the &quot;dwelling population&quot; (&quot;Wohnbevölkerung&quot;), and since 1987 the &quot;Population in the place of main residence&quot; (&quot;Bevölkerung am Ort der Hauptwohnung&quot;). Before 1843, population figures come from irregular surveying procedures.

At the city&#x27;s helm since the 13th century, there have been several mayors of whom evidence survives. In 1304 and 1305, a council (&quot;consules&quot;) was mentioned for the first time. As early as 1224, however, documents mention &quot;Burgmänner&quot; (&quot;Castle Men&quot;) as well as three &quot;Bürgermeister&quot; (&quot;Mayors&quot;) who were changed yearly. As of 1500, only two mayors were chosen every year. In the 18th century, the guilds were achieving ever greater influence in the town. Thereafter the &quot;ruling&quot; or &quot;office-holding&quot; old shoemaking master represented the &quot;common townsfolk&quot; on the council. The mediaeval town charter was kept right up until 1809, and parts of it even held until 1815, but that year there was a self-endorsing council with 12 members, over which presided the mayor. As of 1824, the suburbs got their own chief administrator who was subordinate to the mayor of Siegen. In 1836, the Prussian municipal system was introduced. After the town was separated from Siegen district in 1923, the mayor was given the title &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; (roughly equivalent to Lord Mayor). The mayor who came to office in 1919 kept his position right through the time of the Third Reich, whereas some mayors in other German and Austrian towns, whose political views were at odds with the Nazis&#x27;, were removed forcibly.

After the Second World War, the military government of the British Zone of Occupation installed a new mayor, and in 1946 it introduced a new town charter based on a British model, leading to a &quot;Council of the town&quot; elected by the people, whose members were called &quot;Stadtverordnete&quot; (town councillors). In the beginning, the council chose one from its midst as the mayor as the town&#x27;s head and representative, which was an honorary function. Furthermore, as of 1946, the council also began choosing a full-time &quot;Oberstadtdirektor&quot;, or Higher Town Director, to lead the town&#x27;s administration.

After Siegen was reunited with the district of the same name in 1975, these two officials bore the titles &quot;Bürgermeister&quot; and &quot;Stadtdirektor&quot; respectively. In 1999, this two-headed arrangement was forsaken in favour of a single city leader, with the title &quot;Bürgermeister&quot;, who serves as chairman or chairwoman of city council, leader of city administration and city representative. The mayor is directly elected.

===Coat of arms===
Siegen&#x27;s civic coat of arms might be described thus: Argent a town wall embattled gules with an open gateway argent, therein in an inescutcheon azure a lion rampant Or armed and langued gules, issuant from the wall a bishop in robe and mitre azure (trimmed in argent) holding in his hand dexter a crozier argent with crook Or sinister, in his hand sinister, upraised, an open book argent with pages edged gules.

The bishop in the city&#x27;s arms is the Bishop of Cologne. The wall symbolizes the city itself, and the inescutcheon in the gateway shows the Lion of Nassau in blue and gold (or yellow), which are Nassau&#x27;s colours. The arms are based on the oldest known town seal, from 1248. The inescutcheon once also had gold billets (upright rectangles) around the lion, but these do not appear in what became the town&#x27;s (and later city&#x27;s) coat of arms in 1875.

==Sights==


Although the town was about 80% destroyed in the World War II, Siegen has kept a number of buildings worth seeing, such as the two stately homes, the &quot;Oberes Schloss&quot; and the &quot;Unteres Schloss&quot;.

===Oberes Schloss===

The castle on the Siegberg was first mentioned in a document in 1259 and was the family seat of the House of Nassau. Since 1905, the Siegerland Museum has been here. Alongside regional exhibits – among them an artificial demonstration mine – are many paintings. The centrepiece of this collection is made up of works by the man who is arguably the best known native, Peter Paul Rubens. There is also quite a comprehensive collection of portraits of members of the Houses of Nassau and Orange. The top floor is devoted to 19th-century home décor. A kitchen from the Siegerland, a bedroom and many pieces of furniture from the Biedermeier era give one an impression of life in the region in bygone days.

===Unteres Schloss===
Late in the 17th century, the Lower Stately Home came into being in its current form, somewhat like an open rectangle. The Protestant line of the House of Nassau-Siegen resided here. Also belonging to the &quot;Schloss&quot; is the &quot;Dicker Turm&quot;, or &quot;Fat Tower&quot; with a carillon. In 1959, the then town of Siegen built a memorial for victims of war and tyranny. Inside the &quot;Schloss&quot; is also found the crypt of the Evangelical branch of the Nassau princely house.

Today, the &quot;Schloss&quot; serves as a state authority building in which the North Rhine-Westphalia Building and Property Establishment, the State Environment Office, the Office for Occupational Health and Safety and the Attendorn Correctional Facility (Siegen Branch Facility) are all housed. By the city&#x27;s plans, a university is supposed to move into the &quot;Unteres Schloss&quot; within the next few years, but at this time, the plan is failing to find any financial backing.

===Churches===
Two churches in downtown Siegen are to be brought to the visitor&#x27;s attention: The &quot;Martinikirche&quot; dating from the 11th century and the &quot;Nikolaikirche&quot; at the marketplace with its unusual eight-sided shape and its golden &quot;Krönchen&quot; (&quot;coronet&quot;) – the city&#x27;s landmark – on the church tower, which is a prominent feature of Siegen&#x27;s skyline (Siegen is sometimes called &quot;Krönchenstadt&quot; for this unusual feature). Another church is the &quot;Marienkirche&quot;, built by the Jesuits between 1702 and 1729. Also worth seeing are Siegen&#x27;s Old Town and several museums in the city core.

===Gasometer===

In the southwest of the city core, at the foot of the Ziegenberg, is a spherical gas holder, or gasometer, which is protected by law as a monument. It is one of the oldest spherical gas holders still preserved. Another peculiarity is its riveted casing. Only three other such gas holders are known to exist worldwide (all in Germany, in Schwerte, Offenburg and Bielefeld). The holder had to be moved a few metres owing to construction on the municipal Autobahn, the &quot;Hüttentalstraße&quot;, and in the residential area of Ziegenberg, and it now forms the symbolic sun as part of a scale model of the planets above the gas holder.

===Cemeteries===
Within Siegen&#x27;s city limits are 36 municipally run cemeteries. Ten of them are already closed and are available for burials only because of existing laws. The cemeteries have a total area of 730 000 m2 with roughly 65,000 graves. Characteristic of regional cemeteries are hillside graves and a green, parklike layout that even affords wildlife a chance at reoccupying the land.

Cemeteries within city limits are:
*Lindenbergfriedhof
*Hermelsbacher Friedhof
*Stockfriedhof
*Geisweider Friedhof
*Haardter Friedhof
*Gilbergfriedhof
*Friedhof Kaan-Marienborn
*Neuer Friedhof Niederschelden

==Culture==

===Theatre===

In the Apollo-Theater (a downtown former 1930s cinema that underwent remodelling and opened in mid-2007), Siegen has one of the current decade&#x27;s most important newly built theatres. A controlling interest in this venture is held by TheaterSiegen intendant Magnus Reitschuster.

Since 1992, the media and cultural house Lÿz has been a venue for cabaret, music and theatre in Siegen. On the two stages, roughly 150 events appear every season.

Bigger events take place at the &quot;Bühne der Stadt&quot; (&quot;City&#x27;s Stage&quot;, with about 820 seats), the Siegerlandhalle (1 800 m2, 2,300 seats) or the Bismarckhalle. As well, there are regular open-air concerts and productions in the inner yard at &quot;Unteres Schloss&quot;.

===Orchestras and choirs===
*Philharmonie Südwestfalen
*Evangelische Kantorei Siegen
*Bach-Chor Siegen
*Sängerkreis Siegerland

===Museums===
The main centre of art in Siegen are the Museum for Contemporary Art and the &quot;Haus Seel&quot; – city gallery.

The Siegerland Museum is dedicated to regional history. The Oranienstraße House, built at 1900 in the Italian country house style, is attached to the Siegerland Museum since 1993 as an exhibit forum. There is a varied program of temporary exhibitions of all kinds, from archaeological excavations to contemporary avant-garde art. Poet and author readings are also part of the program, such as classic concerts.

In Geisweid is found the Beatles Home Museum, run by Harold Krämer. According to the 2000 Guinness Book of Records, the 27 m2 museum is the smallest public museum in the world devoted to the four Liverpudlian musicians. The collection holds more than 17,000 recordings, souvenirs, film posters, and autographs and other memorabilia.

===Regular events===
*Early in the year: SILA (&quot;Siegerlandausstellung&quot; – Siegerland Exhibition), even-numbered years only
*March to November, first Saturday in each month: Flea market in Siegen-Geisweid (since 1970), no new goods
*June to August: &quot;Mittwochs in&quot; different bands every Wednesday in Siegen-Weidenau
*June: &quot;Johannimarkt&quot;, a fair held for some 400 years
*June/July: &quot;Siegener Sommerfestival&quot;, plays, cabaret, theatre, music and cinema since about 1990. (In 2006, instead of the traditional summer festival, a World Cup festival was held)
*July: &quot;Stadtfest&quot; (City Festival), even-numbered years only
*July: &quot;Rubensfest&quot;, odd-numbered years only
*August: Siegen Open-Air Cinema
*August: Christopher Street Day (CSD), since 2000
*August: &quot;Siegtal-Pur&quot; All streets only opened for bikes (the HTS (local Motorway) too)
*Summer: Street Festival at the Corn Market
*October: 2nd Sunday: &quot;Bürgerfest Geisweid&quot;
*November: &quot;Geisweider Adventsmarkt&quot;, since about 1985
*December: Christmas market, since about 1980

===Dialect===
The city and its surrounding region speak in addition to standard German also have a characteristic local dialect: Siegerländisch.

===Tales and legends===
The &quot;Dilldappe&quot; is an old mythical creature from the Siegerland. It lives mainly in the Siegerland &quot;Hauberg&quot; (coöperatively managed woodlots). Early in the 1980s, the writer and cartoonist Matthias Kringe first published a calendar about the creature, written in the local dialect of German.

===The Rubens Prize of the City of Siegen===
The Rubens Prize of the City of Siegen, founded in 1955, is awarded every five years to a painter or graphic artist whose life&#x27;s work has been groundbreaking on the European stage. The title recalls the painter-diplomat Peter Paul Rubens, who expressed in his life&#x27;s work the thought of European unity, long before it could become a political reality. Peter Paul Rubens – who was born in Siegen, grew up in Cologne and Antwerp, trained in art in Italy, was esteemed in France and acted as a diplomat in Spain and England – as the main master of European Baroque painting set those artistic and European standards to which the awarding of the prize has been bound since 1957–1958.

Past prizewinners:

*Hans Hartung (1957/1958)
*Giorgio Morandi (1962)
*Francis Bacon (1967)
*Antoni Tàpies (1972)
*Fritz Winter (1977)
*Emil Schumacher (1982)
*Cy Twombly (1987)
*Rupprecht Geiger (1992)
*Lucian Freud (1997)
*Maria Lassnig (2002)
*Sigmar Polke (2007)
*Bridget Riley (2012)
*Niele Toroni (2017)
==Sport==
The city sport league includes 160 sport clubs in which roughly 37,000 members are active. National importance was achieved in 2005 by the Sportfreunde Siegen men&#x27;s football team at Leimbachstadion when they rose from the &quot;Regionalliga Süd&quot; up to the 2nd Bundesliga, although the next year they dropped back down again. As six-time German Champions, the TSV Siegen women&#x27;s football team was very successful in the 1990s.

==Transport==

===Air transport===
In the south of the district in the community of Burbach lies the Siegerland Airport. There are no scheduled services to other German cities. The airport is mainly used for general aviation and parachuting.

===Bicycle transport===
The city of Siegen lies on European long-distance path E1 running from the middle of Sweden to Umbria in Italy. There is, however, no organized cycling trail network in Siegen. Riding in bus lanes is sporadically allowed. Bicycle transport is generally poorly developed in Siegen. Owing to dual carriageways within the city and nearby, as well as transport planning that rather favours cars, bicycle transport has been somewhat thwarted. Together with the partly hilly topography, there is therefore little in the way of bicycle transport in Siegen.

===Rail transport===
Siegen station lies at the junction of the following railway lines:
* The two-track electrified Ruhr–Sieg line &quot;(Ruhr-Sieg-Strecke)&quot; is used for regional services, usually hourly, of the &quot;Ruhr-Sieg-Express&quot; (RE 16) and the &quot;Ruhr-Sieg-Bahn&quot; (RB 91).
* The Rothaar Railway &quot;(Rothaarbahn)&quot; is served, usually hourly by &quot;Rothaar-Bahn&quot; (RB 93) services, connecting in Erndtebrück to &quot;Obere Lahntal-Bahn&quot; (RB 94/RMV Line 43) services, usually two-hourly, on the Upper Lahn Valley Railway &quot;(Obere Lahntal-Bahn)&quot;.
* The two-track electrified Dill Railway &quot;(Dill-Strecke)&quot; is served, usually two-hourly, by the &quot;Rhein-Sieg-Express&quot; (RE 9) and the &quot;Main-Sieg-Express&quot; (RE 99) and hourly by the &quot;Sieg-Dill-Bahn&quot; (RB 95) (only to and from Dillenburg).
* The mostly two-track electrified Sieg line &quot;(Siegstrecke)&quot; is served, usually hourly, by the &quot;Rhein-Sieg-Express&quot; (RE 9) and &quot;Sieg-Dill-Bahn&quot; (RB 95) services (only to and from Au).

===Bus transport===
On 18 March 1895, the &quot;Netphener Omnibusgesellschaft&quot; opened the world&#x27;s first busline using a petrol-powered omnibus, running a service from its base in Netphen to Siegen and Deuz. Today, local road transport offers many regional, express and local buses, along with a night bus service connecting Siegen with its outlying communities and neighbouring towns. They are run by the South Westphalia Transport Services (&quot;Verkehrsbetriebe Westfalen-Süd&quot;; VWS) whose headquarters are in Siegen.

For the whole of local public transport, the tariff of the South Westphalia Transport Community (&quot;Verkehrsgemeinschaft Westfalen-Süd&quot;; VGWS) applies, regardless of the North Rhine-Westphalia tariff.

===Roads===
With regard to long-distance roads, the city of Siegen is connected to Autobahnen A 45 (Dortmund – Aschaffenburg) and A 4 (Cologne – Olpe), and to Federal Highways (&quot;Bundesstraßen&quot;) 54, 54n, 62 and 62n.

Siegen is home to the tallest bridge of the A 45 and one of the highest in Germany, the Siegtalbrücke. Built from 1964 to 1969, it is approximately 96 m high and 1 050 m long.

The shape that the city takes has much to do with the &quot;Hüttentalstraße&quot; (HTS) (Federal Highways 54n and 62n) which serves as a municipal Autobahn – much of it elevated – that runs through the city area.

The A 4 between Wenden and Kreuztal has been newly built. In the heights over Kreuztal&#x27;s outlying community of Krombach, it now joins with the HTS. On this 12-kilometre stretch of highway are eight valley bridges as well as ten under- and overpasses. This new part was opened on 1 December 2007.

==Economy==

Siegen is South Westphalia&#x27;s service and administrative centre. Much of its industry is based on metalworking.

Pedestrian precincts in Bahnhofsstraße (&quot;Railway Station Street&quot;) and Kölner Tor (&quot;Cologne Gate&quot;), both downtown, have made shopping in Siegen very convenient, as have the shopping centres City-Galerie (opened in 1998) and &quot;Sieg Carré&quot; (opened in 2006, both downtown) and &quot;Siegerlandzentrum&quot; (Siegen-Weidenau), and the Marburger Straße shopping street (downtown). In 2005, an IKEA store and a Peek &amp; Cloppenburg location opened.

===Public institutions===
Siegen is home to the Siegen-Wittgenstein district administration and location of a Chamber of Industry and Trade (&quot;Industrie- und Handelskammer&quot;, or IHK, one of 81 such regional institutions in Germany) for the districts of Siegen-Wittgenstein and Olpe.

Home to the Siegen State Court, a local court and a labour court, the city is also an important court centre.

===Media===
In Siegen, the &quot;Westdeutscher Rundfunk&quot; (WDR) maintains a studio where regional radio and television news for South Westphalia is produced. The daily broadcast goes out in the &quot;South Westphalia&quot; regional window following the programme &quot;Aktuelle Stunde&quot; (a newsmagazine show) on WDR&#x27;s third channel. Moreover, WDR also runs a transmission facility for VHF radio and television (once also medium wave) at the Giersberg.

Daily newspapers in Siegen include not only the &quot;Siegener Zeitung&quot; but also local editions of the &quot;Westfälische Rundschau&quot; and the &quot;Westfalenpost&quot;. All three appear in the morning, although the first was until 2000 an afternoon paper. Furthermore, at the &quot;Obergraben&quot; is found the regional, Radio-NRW-connected Radio Siegen&#x27;s studio building.

==Education==
In the early decades of the 17th century, the Herborn Academy temporarily relocated to Siegen, in the buildings of the &quot;Unteres Schloss&quot;, which came to an end when the Plague broke out.

<text>Leslie Egerton Blackwell (9 November 1897 – 20 October 1959) was a Canadian politician, soldier, lawyer, and land developer.

==Background==
He was born in Lindsay, Ontario in 1897, but moved to Toronto when he was young. He grew up and was educated in the Parkdale area of Toronto. He joined the Canada Army as a private in 1916, during the First World War. His unit, the 204th Battalion of the Canadian Infantry, was commanded by future Ontario Attorney General, Lieutenant-Colonel William Price. He was severely injured in the war, losing a leg during the Battle of Cambrai in 1918. He came back to Canada and eventually graduated from the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall law school.

==Politics==
During the 1937 Ontario general election Blackwell was a candidate in Toronto&#x27;s Eglinton electoral district; where he came in second on election night. He ran again in Eglinton, and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1943 election that brought George Drew&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario to power with a minority government. Blackwell was immediately put into Drew&#x27;s cabinet as Attorney General.

After Drew&#x27;s departure from provincial politics, Blackwell was a candidate to replace him in the 1949 Conservative leadership election, placing second to Leslie Frost. He did not join Frost&#x27;s cabinet and served his remaining time as a backbencher in the legislature, and did not run in the 1951 election.

===Cabinet positions===

==Later life==
He went back to his private law practice and became involved in land development. He was working on the Thorncliffe Park housing development, in Toronto, when he was hospitalized in early October 1959. He finally succumbed to complications due to pneumonia on 20 October 1959.

<text>Thomas McNally, Baron McNally (born 20 February 1943) is a British politician and a former Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords.

==Early life==
McNally was born in Blackpool. A Catholic of Irish descent, he attended St Joseph&#x27;s College, Blackpool. He later attended University College London, where he was elected president of the Debating Society as well as Students&#x27; Union President.

==Professional career==
He later worked for the Fabian Society, and then as a full-time employee of the Labour Party, becoming its international secretary. He served as a political advisor to Foreign Secretary James Callaghan during the conflict in Cyprus in the 1970s, before becoming head of the Prime Minister&#x27;s political office at Downing Street in 1976 when Callaghan succeeded Harold Wilson.

==Political career==
Elected to the House of Commons in 1979 as a member of the Labour Party for the constituency of Stockport South, in 1981 he was one of the later defectors to the new Social Democratic Party (SDP). Following constituency boundary changes for the 1983 general election McNally was the SDP candidate for the new constituency of Stockport, but finished in third place behind Labour and the Conservative victor, Anthony Favell.

From 1993 he was Head of Public Affairs at Shandwick Consultants, and later non-executive vice-chairman of its successor Weber Shandwick.

On 18 November 1995 it was announced McNally would receive a life peerage. The Letters Patent were issued on 20 December and he took the title Baron McNally, of Blackpool in the County of Lancashire.

After being elected unopposed to succeed Baroness Williams of Crosby, he took office as Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords at the beginning of the 2004/05 session of Parliament.

In January 2006, McNally was linked to the resignation of Charles Kennedy as leader of the Liberal Democrats, with critical comments regarding Kennedy&#x27;s leadership of the party, and the effect that infighting was having on their electoral prospects in the upcoming local elections in May. McNally criticised Kennedy, suggesting that his style and content were lacklustre. Also in January 2006, McNally revealed in an interview that he had himself been alcohol dependent in the 1980s. He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the passing of a more boozy, ill-disciplined, ill-researched type of politics is to be regretted at all.&quot;

He has been President of the Stockport Liberal Democrat Constituency Party since 2007. In May 2010, following the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition Government, Lord McNally was appointed Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice, under Kenneth Clarke.

In 2012 McNally justified the absence of an official pardon of mathematician Alan Turing on indecency charges, saying that Turing was rightly prosecuted under the UK&#x27;s 1950s laws.

On 2 October 2013, Lord McNally announced he would be stepping down as leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords, saying it had been &quot;an enormous privilege to serve as Leader of a Group which, by its discipline and cohesiveness has constantly punched above its weight&quot;.

Lord McNally resigned as Minister of State for Justice on 18 December 2013 following his appointment as Chair of the Youth Justice Board. He is a vice-president of the Debating Group.

==Family==
Lord McNally is married with two sons and one daughter.

<text>Elisabeth Sara &quot;Elly&quot; Ameling (born 8 February 1933) is a Dutch soprano, who is particularly known for lieder recitals and for performing works by Johann Sebastian Bach. Performing with distinguished pianists and ensembles around the globe, she was awarded various honours and recording prizes.

==Career==
Ameling was born in Rotterdam where she grew up. She later sang with Pierre Bernac. She won the first prize during the International Vocal Competition &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands (1956) and the &quot;Concours International de Musique&quot; in Geneva (1958). After her professional début as a concert singer in Rotterdam in 1953, she performed for more than forty years in virtually every major cultural centre in the world. She appeared with most of the leading international orchestras and conductors, including Seiji Ozawa, André Previn, Wolfgang Sawallisch, Neville Marriner, Karl Münchinger and Edo de Waart.

She made her career mainly as a concert and lieder singer with some excursions into opera, and became world-renowned for her recitals of French and German songs and for her superlative interpretive gifts. She has been equally at home in chamber music, orchestral music, operas, and oratorios. Her operatic roles included Ilia in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, Fiordiligi in his &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; in 1958, Jacqueline in Messager&#x27;s &quot;Fortunio&quot; in 1959, and the Marchesa in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot; in 1974, She made her U.S. recital debut at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center in 1968 and her opera debut in 1974 as Ilia in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; in Washington, D.C. In 1974, Ameling also performed for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston.

Contemporary works, particularly by her countrymen and Robert Heppener, are also part of her large repertoire. Ameling has recorded more than 150 albums and has won many recording prizes, including The Edison Award, the Grand Prix du Disque and the Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik. When she retired in 1995, she was regarded as one of the most admired and recorded female lieder singers. She now teaches at the Franz Schubert Institut alongside Julius Drake, Helmut Deutsch, Roger Vignoles, and Cynthia Hoffmann.

== Awards ==
For her services to music, Ameling has been awarded four honorary degrees and has been knighted, in 1971, by Her Majesty the Queen of The Netherlands to the Order of Orange-Nassau. In 2008, she received the highest civil decoration in the Netherlands, the Order of the Netherlands Lion. In 2015, she was awarded the Hugo Wolf Medal of the in Stuttgart.

== Recordings ==
Ameling&#x27;s recordings focus on lieder, with pianists and orchestras. She recorded two songs from Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; with the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Benjamin Britten at the 1969 Aldeburgh Festival. In 1970, she recorded Beethoven&#x27;s Mass in C major with the New Philharmonia Chorus and Orchestra, conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini, alongside Janet Baker, Theo Altmeyer and Marius Rintzler. She recorded in 1979 Mahler Second and Fourth Symphony with the Netherlands Radio Chorus and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Bernard Haitink, the Second alongside Aafje Heynis. In 1985, she recorded the Schubert&#x27;s complete incidental music to &quot;Rosamunde&quot; with the Rundfunkchor Leipzig and the Gewandhausorchester, conducted by Kurt Masur. In 1974 she made, with pianist Dalton Baldwin, the first complete recording of Mozart&#x27;s lieder for Philips Records. This is still considered to be the reference recording of these works, despite the existence of other cycles.

<text>The Norma Cluster (ACO 3627 or Abell 3627) is a rich cluster of galaxies located near the center of the Great Attractor; it is about distant. Although it is both nearby and bright, it is difficult to observe because it is located in the Zone of Avoidance, a region near the plane of the Milky Way. Consequently, the cluster is severely obscured by interstellar dust at optical wavelengths. Its mass is estimated to be on the order of 1015 solar masses.

ESO 137-001, an example of a jellyfish galaxy, is located in Abell 3627.

<doc id="1069627" wikidata="Q3131038" url="?curid=1069627" title="2004 American League Championship Series">
<text>The 2004 American League Championship Series was a semifinal series in Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2004 postseason deciding the American League champion earning the privilege to play in the 2004 World Series. A rematch of the previous year’s ALCS, it was played between the Boston Red Sox, who had won the AL wild card and defeated the Anaheim Angels in the American League Division Series, and the New York Yankees, who had won the AL East with the best record in the AL and defeated the Minnesota Twins. The Red Sox became the first team in MLB history to force a Game 7 after going down 3–0 in a series (which only one other team, the Houston Astros in the 2020 ALCS, has done since), and they remain the only team in MLB history to come back from a 3–0 series deficit to ultimately win a best-of-seven series. 

In Game 1, Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina pitched a perfect game through six innings, while the Red Sox recovered from an eight-run deficit to close within one run before the Yankees eventually won. A home run by John Olerud helped the Yankees win Game 2. The Yankees gathered 22 hits in Game 3 on their way to a blowout win. The Yankees led Game 4 by one run in the ninth inning, but a steal of second base by Red Sox base runner Dave Roberts and a single by Bill Mueller off Yankees closer Mariano Rivera tied the game. David Ortiz hit a home run in extra innings for the Red Sox win. In Game 5, the Red Sox overcame an eighth inning deficit, and Ortiz hit a 14th inning walk-off single for the Red Sox for their second consecutive extra-innings victory. Curt Schilling pitched seven innings in Game 6 for the Red Sox, during which time his right foot sock became soaked in blood due to an outstanding ankle injury. Game 7 featured the Red Sox paying back New York for their Game 3 blowout with a dominant performance on the road, anchored by Derek Lowe and bolstered by two Johnny Damon home runs including a grand slam. David Ortiz was named the Most Valuable Player of the series.

The Red Sox went on to sweep the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, winning their first World Series championship in 86 years and ending the so-called Curse of the Bambino.

==Route to the series==

===Boston Red Sox===

The Red Sox ended their 2003 season in the previous American League Championship Series with a game seven loss to the Yankees, on a walk-off home run by Yankees third baseman Aaron Boone in the bottom of the 11th inning. During the offseason, they traded Casey Fossum, Brandon Lyon, Jorge de la Rosa, and a minor leaguer to the Arizona Diamondbacks for ace starting pitcher Curt Schilling. Manager Grady Little was also fired and replaced with Terry Francona due to poor decisions that Little made during the previous season&#x27;s playoffs. The Red Sox also signed a closing pitcher, Keith Foulke, to a three-year contract.

Going into the all-star break, the Red Sox were seven games behind the Yankees for the division lead with a record of 48–38, but led the wild card. In an attempt to improve the team and solidify a playoff decision and in anticipation for a showdown against the New York Yankees, general manager Theo Epstein traded well-liked shortstop Nomar Garciaparra to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz and shortstop Orlando Cabrera in a four-team deal on the trading deadline (July 31). The team fell behind up to games in the division during the month of August, but managed to come back in September to within two games. However, the Yankees held strong and won the division, finishing three games ahead of the Red Sox. The Red Sox won the AL Wild Card (the best record among three second-place teams) to obtain a spot in the playoffs. Entering the postseason, first baseman Kevin Millar was asked to compare the team with the previous season&#x27;s team, to which he responded, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;re five outs better than last year.&quot; It was a reference to the 2003 American League Championship Series, in which the Red Sox held a 5–2 lead over the Yankees with one out in the eighth inning of Game 7, only to blow the lead and lose the series.

The Red Sox would sweep the Anaheim Angels in three games, but at a cost. In the first game of the series, Schilling would be hurt by a line drive hit off his foot, leaving the rest of his postseason play in doubt.

===New York Yankees===

The 2004 Yankees began the season in Tokyo with a split against the Rays. Playing a much-anticipated game against the Red Sox, the team lost the game 6–2 and 6 out of the first 7 games to their rivals. After falling as many as games behind the Red Sox on April 25, the team would make up the deficit in less than 2 weeks, including an 8-game win streak. By the end of June, they had a commanding game lead in the AL East over the Sox after sweeping them with a dramatic 5–4 walk-off 13-inning victory. After the All-Star break, the Yankees traded José Contreras to the White Sox for Esteban Loaiza. Contreras was signed away from the Red Sox before the 2003 season, but he failed to live up to expectations. With a game lead in the second week of August, the team struggled and watched their lead dwindle to only games on September 3. The team held off the Red Sox to claim the division and set up a playoff rematch with the Twins. The results were pretty much the same, as the Yankees took the Division Series in 4 games, setting up the rematch.

==Series build-up==

The Red Sox and Yankees had met 45 times in the previous two years, with Boston holding a 23–22 lead. The Red Sox held an 11–8 advantage over New York in 2004, but eight of the games were decided in one of the teams&#x27; final at-bats. Boston outscored New York, 106–105. and this was the fifth time that the two teams were on the doorstep of a World Series, with the Yankees winning the previous four, in 1949, 1978, 1999, and 2003.

The Series was widely anticipated, especially given the outcome of the previous October, when the Yankees beat the Red Sox in seven games when Aaron Boone hit the home run off of Tim Wakefield in the bottom of the 11th inning to send the Yankees to the World Series. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said that &quot;the two teams in the American League facing each other in this series are the two best teams, period.&quot; Fox commentator Joe Buck said as the series began: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s hard to believe, it was almost exactly one year ago tonight that Aaron Boone hit that 11th inning home run to beat the Red Sox...yet for some reason it seemed predetermined that we would be right back here a year later for a rematch of sort.&quot;

Dan Shaughnessy of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that &quot;one year after they (Yankees) jousted to the (Sox&#x27;s) finish in the Bronx last October in an epic seventh game that appeared to take the clash to its zenith they go at it again...&quot; In this series, Alex Rodriguez seemed to answer the Sox&#x27; acquisition of Curt Schilling, as the two veteran stars faced each other, &quot;wearing the uniforms of the ancient rivals in an October game...&quot; Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina summed up the build-up: &quot;This is what everyone was hoping for...It&#x27;s a rematch of last year, with the best two teams in the American League.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; said that this was the showdown the Yankees anticipated the entire season, while the Red Sox craved it an entire year. This was the reason why the Red Sox fired Grady Little, traded Nomar Garciaparra, and added Curt Schilling. Outfielder Johnny Damon said of Boone&#x27;s home run: &quot;If we do advance to the World Series and win, it&#x27;s a better story that we went through New York. We needed to get back here. This is where a lot of hearts were broken, and we&#x27;re in a perfect seat to stop the hurting.&quot; The Red Sox&#x27; Theo Epstein agreed, saying &quot;Now that it&#x27;s here, we can admit that if we&#x27;re able to win a World Series and go through New York along the way, it will mean that much more.&quot;

Initially, Game 4 was scheduled for the afternoon. However, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig had moved the starting time of Game 4 to primetime, due to the rematch, and Fox had a triple-header, first the Seattle Seahawks–New England Patriots game at Gillette Stadium at 1:00 pm ET, then Game 4 of the NLCS between the St. Louis Cardinals and Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park at 4:30 pm ET.

==Summary==

===New York Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox===
==Game summaries==

===Game 1===
Tuesday, October 12, 2004, at Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York
Game 1 pitted the Red Sox&#x27;s star pitcher Curt Schilling against Yankees ace Mike Mussina. Schilling entered the game with a 6–1 postseason career record, but the expected pitchers&#x27; duel quickly became a one-sided exhibition. Schilling had sustained a torn tendon sheath in his right ankle during Game 1 of the American League Division Series against the Angels, and proved to be ineffective. In the first, Gary Sheffield doubled with two outs before Hideki Matsui drove him in with a double, then Matsui scored on Bernie Williams&#x27;s single. In the third, the Yankees loaded the bases with no outs on two singles and a walk before Matsui cleared them with a double. After moving to third on a groundout, Matsui scored on Jorge Posada&#x27;s sacrifice fly. In the sixth, Kenny Lofton hit a leadoff home run off of knuckleballer Tim Wakefield. Sheffield doubled with two outs before scoring on a single by Matsui, giving him an ALCS record-tying five RBIs in the game.

Mussina, meanwhile, retired the game&#x27;s first 19 Red Sox batters. Mark Bellhorn ended Mussina&#x27;s bid for a perfect game with a one-out double in the seventh. After David Ortiz singled with two outs, Kevin Millar&#x27;s double to left scored two runs. Millar moved to third on a passed ball before scoring on Trot Nixon&#x27;s single. Tanyon Sturtze relieved Mussina and allowed a home run to Jason Varitek that made it 8–5 Yankees. Next inning, Tom Gordon allowed singles to Bill Mueller and Manny Ramirez before Ortiz&#x27;s two-out triple cut the Yankees lead to 8–7. The Yankees called upon closer Mariano Rivera, who induced a pop out by Kevin Millar to end the inning. In the bottom half, Alex Rodriguez and Sheffield singled off of Mike Timlin before Williams&#x27; two-run double made it 10–7 Yankees. The Sox hit two singles in the top of the ninth inning off of Rivera, but the game ended when Bill Mueller grounded into a double play.

===Game 2===
Wednesday, October 13, 2004, at Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York
Game 2 featured Pedro Martínez of the Red Sox facing Yankees pitcher Jon Lieber. Again, the Yankees struck first, as Gary Sheffield drove in Derek Jeter, who walked, in the first inning. The 1–0 score held up for several innings, as Lieber and Martinez put together a classic pitchers&#x27; duel.

Martinez got himself in and out of trouble through several innings, but, shortly after making his 100th pitch of the night, walked Jorge Posada and allowed a John Olerud home run, giving New York a 3–0 lead.

Again, the Red Sox rallied. Trot Nixon singled to lead off the eighth off of Lieber, who was replaced by Tom Gordon. A double by Jason Varitek moved Nixon to third before Orlando Cabrera&#x27;s RBI groundout closed the gap, 3–1. With two outs and a runner on third, however, the Yankees again turned to Rivera, who struck out Johnny Damon to end the inning. Rivera shut down the Red Sox in the ninth by inducing a groundout by Mark Bellhorn, and, after giving up a double to Manny Ramírez, striking out David Ortiz and Millar, ending the game.

===Game 3===
Saturday, October 16, 2004, at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts
With the series moving to Fenway Park, Game 3 was originally scheduled for October 15, but was postponed a day due to rain. The starting pitchers were Kevin Brown for the Yankees and Bronson Arroyo for the Red Sox.

As in the first two games, the Yankees began by scoring in the first. Derek Jeter walked and scored from first on a double by Alex Rodríguez. Two batters later, Hideki Matsui hit a home run to right field, giving the Yankees a 3–0 lead. The Red Sox answered in the second inning with a leadoff walk by Jason Varitek and a Trot Nixon home run to right field. A double by Bill Mueller, an infield RBI hit by Johnny Damon (his first hit of the series), and a Derek Jeter error led to two more runs. The Red Sox led for the first time in the series, 4–3.

This lead was short-lived, as Alex Rodríguez led off the third inning with a home run over the Green Monster. Gary Sheffield then walked and Hideki Matsui doubled, prompting Bronson Arroyo to be replaced on the mound by Ramiro Mendoza, who immediately allowed a Bernie Williams RBI single and then balked, allowing Matsui to score from third, which gave the Yankees a 6–4 lead. The Red Sox, however, responded in the bottom of the inning, scoring two runs on an Orlando Cabrera bases-loaded double off Yankees reliever Javier Vázquez to tie the game.

In the fourth inning, the Yankees took the lead on a three-run home run to left by Gary Sheffield after a walk and hit-by-pitch. After another double by Hideki Matsui, the Red Sox put in pitcher Tim Wakefield, who volunteered to forgo his scheduled Game 4 start in order to preserve Boston&#x27;s battered bullpen. Wakefield got Bernie Williams to pop out and then intentionally walked Jorge Posada. Rubén Sierra then tripled to score Matsui and Posada, giving the Yankees an 11–6 lead.

From that point on the Yankees were in total control, with the New York offense continuing to hit and score runs long into the night. In the fifth, Jeter walked with one-out before back-to-back RBI doubles by Rodriguez and Sheffield made it 13–6 Yankees. In the seventh, Miguel Cairo and Sheffield singled off of Wakefield, who was relieved by Alan Embree. Matsui&#x27;s single scored a run, Williams&#x27;s double scored two, and Jorge Posada&#x27;s double scored another. The Red Sox scored their last runs of the game in the bottom of the inning off of Vazquez on Jason Varitek&#x27;s two-run home run after a leadoff single. Matsui also hit a two-run home run in the ninth off of Mike Myers.

When the game was over, the Yankees had set a team record for postseason runs scored. Rodríguez, Sheffield, and Matsui had prolific hitting nights. Matsui had five hits and five RBIs, tying LCS records. He and Rodríguez both tied the postseason record for runs scored with five. The two teams combined for 37 hits and 20 extra-base hits, both postseason records. At four hours and 20 minutes, the contest was the longest nine-inning postseason game ever played up to that time.

Although the final score was 19–8, Dan Shaughnessy of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said &quot;nineteen to eight. Why not &#x27;19–18&#x27;?&quot; He was referring to the Red Sox not having won a World Series since , and demeaning chants of that year echoed at Yankee Stadium.

Bob Ryan wrote about the Red Sox in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;: &quot;They are down, 3–0, after last night&#x27;s 19–8 rout, and, in this sport, that is an official death sentence. Soon it will be over, and we will spend another dreary winter lamenting this and lamenting that.&quot; However, this would turn out to be the Yankees&#x27; last win in this series.

===Game 4===
Sunday, October 17, 2004, at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts
Game 4 featured Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernández, the 1999 ALCS MVP against Boston&#x27;s Derek Lowe. For the first time in the series, the Yankees did not score in the first inning. However, they eventually did score first. With two outs and nobody on in the third inning, Derek Jeter singled. Alex Rodríguez then hit a two-run home run over the Green Monster. This hit resembled a home run he hit in Game 3, as it also came in the third inning and went out of the park onto Lansdowne Street. This would be followed by the ball being thrown back into the outfield by fans on the Street, Johnny Damon tossing the ball back over the fence, and the ball once again being tossed back before being pocketed by Umpire Joe West.

Hernández, who had not pitched in two weeks, cruised through the first four innings giving up just one hit and two walks. In the fifth inning, he pitched himself into a jam, walking two of the first three batters. With two men on and two out, Orlando Cabrera singled to right field, scoring Bill Mueller. Manny Ramírez walked to load the bases, and then David Ortiz hit a single to center field, scoring Cabrera and Johnny Damon and giving the Red Sox a 3–2 lead, only their second lead in the series.

The lead lasted less than an inning. Hideki Matsui hit a triple with one out in the sixth, after which Mike Timlin relieved Lowe. Bernie Williams hit an infield single to score Matsui and tie the game 3-3. After Jorge Posada walked, Williams attempted to advance to third on a passed ball but was thrown out by Jason Varitek. However, Rubén Sierra hit another infield single, moving Posada to third. Tony Clark then hit the third infield single of the inning, to score Posada and give the Yankees a 4–3 lead. Miguel Cairo then walked to load the bases for Jeter, but Timlin induced a groundout to escape the inning.

Massachusetts native Tanyon Sturtze pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Hernández. Mariano Rivera, the Yankees star closer, entered the game in the eighth for a two-inning save attempt. In the ninth inning, Rivera allowed a lead-off walk to Kevin Millar, which ultimately turned out to be the turning point of the series. Dave Roberts was then chosen to pinch-run for Millar. With the Red Sox down to their final three outs, Rivera checked Roberts at first base three times before throwing a pitch to Bill Mueller.

On Rivera&#x27;s first pitch to Mueller, the speedy Roberts stole second, putting himself in scoring position. Mueller&#x27;s single (through Rivera and into centerfield) allowed Roberts to score, resulting in Rivera blowing the save and the game going into extra innings, tied at four runs apiece.

Both teams threatened for more runs in the 11th inning, but the game remained tied until the bottom of the 12th. Ramírez led off with a single against new pitcher Paul Quantrill, who had relieved Tom Gordon, and Ortiz hit a two-run walk-off home run to right field. Ortiz became the first player with two walk-off homers in the same postseason; his first capped a Red Sox sweep of the Anaheim Angels in the American League Division Series. Red Sox pitcher Curtis Leskanic got the win in relief after being called on to stop the Yankees&#x27; 11th inning threat and had pitched the 12th and allowed no runs.
===Game 5===
Monday, October 18, 2004, at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts
Game 5 began at 5:11 pm EDT on Monday, October 18, just 16 hours after Game 4 had ended. Mike Mussina led the Yankees against Boston&#x27;s Pedro Martínez. The Red Sox drew first blood this time, as David Ortiz drove in a run with an RBI single after two one-out singles and Jason Varitek walked with the bases loaded in the first inning to give Boston a 2–0 lead. Bernie Williams homered in the second inning to close the gap to 2–1, a score which would hold up for several innings.

Despite seven strikeouts by Martínez, in the top of the sixth inning, Jorge Posada and Rubén Sierra singled with one out. After Miguel Cairo was hit by a pitch to load the bases, Derek Jeter cleared the bases with a double, giving the Yankees a 4–2 lead. The Red Sox threatened again in the seventh inning but came up empty. For the second straight night, however, the Yankee bullpen could not keep the lead. Ortiz led off the eighth inning with a home run off former Red Sox reliever Tom Gordon, making it a one-run game. Kevin Millar followed with a walk and was again replaced by pinch runner Dave Roberts, who went to third on Trot Nixon&#x27;s single. Gordon was replaced by Mariano Rivera with the lead still intact, but Jason Varitek&#x27;s sacrifice fly tied the game. The Yankees threatened in the top of the ninth when former Red Sox player Tony Clark hit a ball to deep right with two outs, but the ball took a hop over the short right-field wall for a ground-rule double, forcing Rubén Sierra to stop at third base, where he was stranded to set up another extra-inning marathon.

Each team got its share of base runners in extra innings. Boston&#x27;s Doug Mientkiewicz doubled in the tenth and moved to third, but did not score. Two Red Sox led off the 11th with singles, but Esteban Loaiza, who had struggled since being acquired by the Yankees mid-season, came in to pitch with one out and got Orlando Cabrera to ground into a double play. Knuckleballer Tim Wakefield came on in relief once again for the Red Sox in the 12th. He allowed a single to Miguel Cairo, who went to second on a Manny Ramírez error, but Cairo was eventually stranded. In the top of the 13th, Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek, who did not normally catch for Wakefield (backup catcher Doug Mirabelli usually did) and who admitted to being poor at catching knuckleballs, allowed three passed balls, but the Yankees stranded runners on second and third when Sierra struck out. Loaiza pitched well over his first two innings, but, in the bottom of the 14th, Damon and Ramírez walked, bringing up Ortiz with two outs. The previous night&#x27;s hero did his job again, singling to center on the 10th pitch of the at-bat to bring home Damon and setting off another celebration at Fenway. Ortiz&#x27;s heroics prompted Fox TV announcer Tim McCarver to gush shortly afterwards, saying, &quot;He didn&#x27;t do it again, did he? Yes he did.&quot; The late inning heroics of Ortiz also gave the Red Sox fans a chance to create their own chant, &quot;Who&#x27;s your Papi?&quot; (Ortiz being known affectionately as &quot;Big Papi&quot;), in rebuttal to the &quot;Who&#x27;s your daddy?&quot; chant used by Yankees fans in reference to a quote by Pedro Martínez.

The game set the record for longest duration of a postseason game at 5 hours, 49 minutes, a record which was broken the next year by Game 4 of the 2005 National League Division Series between the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves, which was only one minute longer even though it was 18 innings instead of 14. The current record for longest postseason game is Game 3 of the 2018 World Series between the Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers, which was also 18 innings but lasted seven hours and 20 minutes.

Game 5 of the National League Championship Series began at 8:54 pm EST on the same night and was intended to be the second part of FOX&#x27;s two-game telecast. However, that game proceeded quickly and, despite starting 3 hours and 43 minutes after ALCS Game 5, ended only 24 minutes after the final pitch of this game.

This victory by the Red Sox forced a Game 6. Before this, the 1998 Atlanta Braves and 1999 New York Mets were the only baseball teams ever to be down 0–3 in a seven-game series and force a Game 6, but neither of those teams won that game.

The 8th inning of Game 5 eventually turned out be the last time that the Red Sox would trail at any point during in a game in their 2004 postseason run.

===Game 6===
&quot;The Bloody Sock Game&quot;
Tuesday, October 19, 2004, at Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York
Game 6 was held on Tuesday, October 19 at Yankee Stadium. The starting pitchers were Curt Schilling of the Red Sox and Jon Lieber of the Yankees. Schilling pitched with a torn tendon sheath in his right ankle, which was sutured in place in an unprecedented procedure by Red Sox team doctors. The teams played the first few innings scoreless as cold, windy conditions, combined with a light drizzle, kept many hard hit balls in the field of play. Lieber, who had been brilliant in Game 2, was the first of the starters to falter, to the surprise of many given Lieber&#x27;s Game 2 outing and Schilling&#x27;s injured state. Lieber surrendered a two-out single to Jason Varitek, driving in Kevin Millar. Then Orlando Cabrera singled to left field and Mark Bellhorn, who had struggled the entire series, drove a line drive into the left field stands. The ball struck a fan in the hands in an attempted catch and dropped back onto the field, after which left field umpire Jim Joyce signaled the ball to be still in play, prompting Boston manager Terry Francona to run onto the field and argue the ruling. The officiating crew huddled and ultimately overruled the call. Bellhorn had a three-run home run, and the Red Sox had a 4–0 lead.

Schilling, still injured from the ALDS and Game 1, pitched seven strong innings, allowing only one run on a Bernie Williams home run. To help stabilize the tendon in his ankle, Red Sox doctors had placed three sutures connecting the skin with ligament and deep connective tissue next to the bone, effectively creating a wall of tissue to keep the peroneal tendon from disrupting Schilling&#x27;s pitching mechanics. Schilling was only forced to field his position once and visibly limped to first base to field the toss from Millar. Nonetheless, the Yankees did not bunt for the duration of Schilling&#x27;s outing, something Joe Torre later explained as not playing out of the normal character of his team. Torre also admitted that had he known beforehand how bad the injury really was, it might have changed his mind. By the end of his performance, Schilling&#x27;s white sanitary sock was partially soaked in blood, and he stated later that he was completely exhausted.

Bronson Arroyo took the mound for Boston in the eighth and, with one out, allowed a Miguel Cairo double. Derek Jeter singled him in to close the gap to 4–2, leading up to the series&#x27; most controversial play. Alex Rodriguez grounded a ball to Arroyo, who picked up the ball and ran to the baseline to tag Rodriguez out, but Rodriguez slapped Arroyo&#x27;s arm, knocking the ball loose. While the ball rolled down the baseline, Rodríguez went to second and Jeter scored. After another long conversation among the umpires, Rodríguez was called out for interference and Jeter was ordered back to first, thus wiping out the score. The call further incensed the Yankee fans, already irate over the home run call in the fourth. As Torre and Rodríguez continued to frenetically argue with the umpires, many fans began to throw balls and other debris onto the field. Boston manager Terry Francona pulled his players from the field to protect them. After a delay, order was restored, and Arroyo got out of the inning unscathed. In the top of the ninth, after a leadoff single by Jason Varitek, his third hit of the night, off Paul Quantrill (the game 4 loser), the Yankees attempted to turn a double play. However, on a very close play, Orlando Cabrera was called safe at first base. This was the third time in the game that the frustrated New York fan base had a close call go against their team, and they again showered the field with debris. As the Yankees made a pitching change to insert Tanyon Sturtze into the game to relieve Quantrill, home plate umpire Joe West conversed with New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, MLB security director Kevin Hallinan, and various NYPD officials. Shortly after this, Sturtze was told to stop his warmup, and NYPD officers began streaming out of the dugouts, and took the field in full riot gear. The police remained on the field, near the first and third base walls, for the remainder of the top of the ninth. When the game resumed, Sturtze did get out of the inning, stranding Cabrera. The police vacated the field during the break between innings. Red Sox closer Keith Foulke came in for the bottom of the ninth and allowed a walk to Matsui, striking out Bernie Williams, getting Jorge Posada to pop out to third, and walking Ruben Sierra, bringing Tony Clark to the plate as the potential pennant-winning run, but Clark struck out swinging on a full count to end the game.

Five previous teams had managed to win one game after going down 3–0 in a post-season series. Of these five, two made it to a Game 6. But now the Red Sox, the 26th team in Major League Baseball playoff history to face a 3–0 series deficit, became the first to force a Game Seven.

After the game, Schilling proudly wore his shirt with the Red Sox&#x27;s motto, &quot;Why Not Us?&quot; in the locker room and during the press conferences.

===Game 7===
Wednesday, October 20, 2004, at Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York
For inspiration for their ALCS comeback, the Red Sox gathered in Yankee Stadium&#x27;s visitors&#x27; clubhouse prior to Game 7 to watch &quot;Miracle&quot;, the movie chronicling the 1980 U.S. men&#x27;s gold-medal hockey team. The Yankees meanwhile, had Bucky Dent, the hero of the Yankees&#x27; one-game playoff against Boston in 1978, throw out the ceremonial first pitch.

Game 7 began at 8:30 p.m. The starting pitchers were Derek Lowe for the Red Sox and Kevin Brown for the Yankees. Johnny Damon led off the game with a single to left and stolen base, but was thrown out at home trying to score on a Manny Ramirez base hit. The very next pitch, however, was lined into the right-field bleachers by David Ortiz to give Boston a 2–0 advantage. After the Yankees went down in order in the first inning, Brown retired Trot Nixon on a groundout to begin the top of the second, but Kevin Millar singled to center field before Brown walked Bill Mueller and Orlando Cabrera to load the bases. Torre then replaced Brown with Javier Vázquez to face Johnny Damon, who hammered his first pitch into the right-field seats for a grand slam to make the score 6–0 Boston. Lowe, meanwhile, on two days rest, pitched six innings, allowing only one run on one hit when Miguel Cairo was hit by a pitch in the third, stole second, and scored on Derek Jeter&#x27;s single. Vazquez walked Cabrera to lead off the fourth before Damon again homered on his first pitch to make it 8–1 Boston and give him three hits and six RBIs in this game. After walking two batters, Vazquez was relieved by Esteban Loaiza, who allowed a single to Jason Varitek to load the bases before retiring Trot Nixon and Kevin Millar to end the inning. Loaiza then threw three shutout innings, allowing three hits.

Pedro Martínez relieved Lowe in the seventh inning, receiving loud chants of &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Daddy?,&quot; which intensified as he gave up a 
leadoff double to Hideki Matsui, who scored on Bernie Williams&#x27;s double. After Jorge Posada grounded out, Williams scored on Kenny Lofton&#x27;s single, but John Olerud struck out and Cairo flew out to end the inning. In the eighth, Mark Bellhorn homered for the second night in a row off of Tom Gordon to make it 9–3 Boston. Next inning, Nixon hit a leadoff single, advanced to second on a Doug Mientkiewicz single, then went to third on a Mueller fly out before scoring on a sacrifice fly by Cabrera. Mariano Rivera relieved Gordon and retired Damon to end the inning.

Mike Timlin pitched a scoreless eighth and started the 9th for the Red Sox, but allowed a leadoff single to Matsui and walked Lofton with two outs. Alan Embree was brought in to finish the game for Boston. At 12:01 am, on October 21, Rubén Sierra hit a groundball to second baseman Pokey Reese, who threw to first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz to finish the unprecedented comeback. It was their first pennant since 1986. The Red Sox won 10–3 and became the third team in sports history and the first since the 1975 NHL&#x27;s New York Islanders to win a seven-game series after losing the first three games. For the Yankees, this was their first time losing an ALCS in eight appearances (their last ALCS elimination was in 1980). David Ortiz was named the series MVP.

This was the last ALCS game at the Old Yankee Stadium.

==Records==
*The Red Sox became the first Major League team to win eight straight postseason games in the same postseason (four straight in the ALCS and four consecutive games in the World Series). The Oakland Athletics had won ten straight postseason games, but they were spread out over two postseasons (the 1989 ALCS and World Series, and the 1990 ALCS). The New York Yankees won 11 straight games also over two consecutive postseasons (the 1998 ALCS and World Series through the 1999 ALDS and into the 1999 ALCS). The 2005 Chicago White Sox repeated this feat, as did the 2014 Kansas City Royals and 2019 Washington Nationals.
*The Red Sox became the third team in North American sports history to lose the first three games of a best-of-seven series and win the last four, joining the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and 1975 New York Islanders of the NHL. Boston&#x27;s NHL franchise, the Bruins, would find themselves on the wrong side of the feat in 2010, losing to the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference semifinals.
*At 4 hours and 20 minutes Game 3 was, at the time, the longest nine-inning postseason game in MLB history. That record stood until Game 5 of the 2016 National League Division Series between the Dodgers and Nationals, which took 4:32. The current Red Sox record is Game 4 of their 2018 American League Championship Series against the Houston Astros, which took 4:33; the MLB record is now held by the Cleveland Indians and Yankees in Game 2 of the 2020 American League Wild Card Series, which lasted 4:50.
*In Game 3, Yankee left fielder Hideki Matsui had five hits and five RBIs, tying an American League Championship Series record.
*Game 5, at 5 hours and 49 minutes, was the longest Major League postseason game in history at the time. The record stood until Game 4 of the 2005 National League Division Series between the Astros and the Atlanta Braves, an 18-inning game that lasted 5:50. The current MLB record is held by Game 3 of the 2018 World Series between the Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers, which also lasted 18 innings and took 7:20 to play.
*David Ortiz became the first player to hit two walk-off HRs in the same postseason, 2004 American League Division Series Game 3 and 2004 ALCS Game 4.

==Aftermath and Legacy==
A riot broke out near Fenway Park in Boston following the series win, in which Victoria Snelgrove, an Emerson College journalism student, was accidentally shot and killed by police with an FN 303 pepper spray crowd-controlling projectile round.

After dominating much of baseball since 1996, this would be the closest that the Joe Torre-led Yankees would get to going back to the World Series. They would not get back until 2009 (by which point Joe Girardi had taken over the manager position) when they beat defending champion Philadelphia Phillies in six games.

The Yankees signed Johnny Damon away from the Red Sox after the 2005 season. In an interview with Jomboy Media in 2021, Damon stated he wanted to stay in Boston, but he believed Red Sox management weren&#x27;t interested in keeping him due to the emergence of top prospect Jacoby Ellsbury, who scouts compared to Damon. Ironically, Ellsbury would sign with the Yankees as a free agent after a long and successful career in Boston, like Damon.

This series is often seen as a turning point of the Yankees–Red Sox rivalry, which was almost entirely dominated by the Yankees up until this point. From the time the Red Sox&#x27;s owner Harry Frazee traded Babe Ruth to the Yankees for cash on January 5, 1920, through October 2004, the Yankees were the premier team in baseball, winning a record 26 World Series and 39 pennants in between then. On the other hand, the Red Sox, who were Major League Baseball&#x27;s most successful franchise until the Ruth trade in 1920, only won a handful of pennants, losing every World Series they played in. However, since 2004, the Red Sox have won four World Series compared to just one Yankees World Series (the Yankees still have superior regular season winning percentage than the Red Sox). The 2010s was the first ever decade the Yankees franchise did not play in the World Series since the 1910s, and the first in which they did not win a World Series since the 1980s. In the same decade, the Red Sox won a World Series in 2013 and 2018. On their way to a championship in 2018, the Red Sox defeated the Yankees, now led by Aaron Boone as manager, in four games in the American League Division Series, which was the first postseason match-up between the two rivals since the 2004 AL Championship Series.

There have been many books and documentaries about the 2004 Red Sox and the 2004 ALCS. Shortly after their World Series win, authors and Red Sox fans Stephen King and Stewart O&#x27;Nan published &quot;Faithful&quot;, a book chronicling the 2004 Boston Red Sox season, beginning with an e-mail in the summer of 2003, and throughout the 2004 season, from spring training to the World Series. Sportswriter Bill Simmons wrote &quot;Now I Can Die in Peace&quot; in 2006. In the book, Simmons&#x27; recalled being teased by Yankees fans growing up in Stamford, Connecticut about how the Red Sox never won anything. In 2010, ESPN&#x27;s 30 for 30 featured a documentary named &quot;Four Days in October&quot;, which went into depth of the Red Sox&#x27;s triumph over the Yankees in the 2004 AL Championship Series over the course of 4 days. Netflix released a documentary on the Red Sox comeback in 2024, titled &quot;The Comeback: 2004 Boston Red Sox&quot;. 

In 2020, the Houston Astros nearly came back from a 3–0 series deficit, but lost in Game 7 of the AL Championship Series to the Tampa Bay Rays. It was the closest a team in Major League Baseball had come to pulling off this feat since the 2004 Red Sox. In the National Hockey League, the 2010 Philadelphia Flyers became the first NHL team to comeback from a 3–0 deficit since the New York Islanders did it in 1975 (they coincidentally beat a team from Boston, the Bruins, in the 2010 Eastern Conference Semifinals to accomplish the feat) en route to the Stanley Cup Finals. Four years later in 2014, the Los Angeles Kings came back from 3–0 in a series with the San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference First Round en route to winning the Stanley Cup. To date, no NBA team has ever come back from a 3–0 postseason deficit. However, the Boston Celtics nearly came back from a 3–0 hole against the Miami Heat in the 2023 NBA playoffs before losing Game 7 at TD Garden. In the lead up to decisive Game 7 of that series, David Ortiz offered words of advice to the Celtics.

In 2021, the Red Sox and Yankees would once again face off in the postseason, with the Red Sox winning the American League Wild Card Game by a score of 6–2. 

In the 2022 American League Championship Series, prior to Game 4 against Astros, Boone had the team mental skills coach show clips from the 2004 series to the team as an attempt at motivating the Yankees, who were down 3-0 in the 2022 series; the Yankees promptly lost Game 4 and were thus eliminated.

The 2004 ALCS and the subsequent World Series has often been described as the &quot;greatest comeback in sports history&quot;.

<text>There are currently 38 [[law school]]s in [[Australia]]. Only one of the 39 member institutions of Universities Australia has no law school: Federation University.

==Current law schools==
There are currently 2 non-university providers who offer accredited law degrees:

*Legal Profession Admission Board
*Top Education Institute - Sydney City School of Law

== Australian Law Schools Mooting Ranking ==
Moot court rankings are a key indicator of a law school&#x27;s commitment to practical legal education. They reflect the school&#x27;s ability to train students in essential skills such as advocacy, legal reasoning, and oral argument. High rankings in moot court competitions suggest a strong focus on experiential learning, which is crucial for producing competent and competitive legal professionals. These rankings can serve as a benchmark for the quality of legal education and the school&#x27;s ability to prepare students for real-world legal challenges.

The averages are calculated based on the available rankings from 2014 to 2023, available from the NICA Law School Rankings for Mooting Competitions. 

The NICA rankings evaluate law schools based on their performance in moot court competitions. The rankings consider two factors: the weight of the competitions, determined by the number participating law schools, and the advancement of teams within these competitions. 

UQ Law School has performed the best out of all of the law schools in Australia with respect to Moot court competitions averaging a World ranking of 27.2, and an Australia ranking of 3 from 2014 to 2023.

<doc id="1069648" wikidata="Q156025" url="?curid=1069648" title="Alismataceae">
<text>The water-plantains (Alismataceae) are a family of flowering plants, comprising 20 genera (17 extant and 3 fossil) and 119 species. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, with the greatest number of species in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Most of the species are herbaceous aquatic plants growing in marshes and ponds.

==Description==
Most Alismataceae are robust perennials, but some may be annual or perennial, depending on water conditions — they are normally perennial in permanent waters, annual in more seasonal conditions but there are exceptions. The stems are corm-like or stoloniferous. Juvenile and submerse leaves are often linear, whilst more mature and emerse leaves can be linear to ovate or even sagittate. Most have a distinct petiole, with a sheathed base.

The inflorescence is usually compound with whorls of branches, though some are umbel-like, and others have solitary flowers. The flowers are regular, bisexual or unisexual. There are three sepals which usually persist in the fruit. Three petals, usually conspicuous, white, pink, purple, occasionally with yellow or purple spots. The petals rarely last more than one day. In &quot;Burnatia&quot; and &quot;Wiesneria&quot; the petals are minute and even occasionally absent in female flowers. Stamens are 3, 6, 9 or numerous. The ovary is superior, comprising 3 - numerous free carpels in one whorl or in a clustered head. Each carpel contains 1 (-2) anatropous ovules.

Fruit is a head of nutlets (except in &quot;Damasonium&quot;). The seeds have no endosperm and a curved or folded embryo.

==Classification==
Under the APG III system, the Alismataceae includes three genera formerly members of the Limnocharitaceae. Altogether, there are 17 extant genera and two fossil genera assigned to the Alismataceae:

==Cultivation and uses==

Several species, notably in the genus &quot;Sagittaria&quot;, have edible rhizomes, grown for both human food and animal fodder in southern and eastern Asia. They were eaten as food by the indigenous peoples of North America. Most have value as food for wildlife. Some are grown as ornamental plants in bog gardens, ponds and aquariums. The leaves and flower buds of &quot;Limnocharis flava&quot; are eaten in Southeast Asia as &quot;poor people&#x27;s vegetable&quot;.

<doc id="1069666" wikidata="Q8025094" url="?curid=1069666" title="Wing Luke">
<text>Wing Chong Luke (February 18, 1925 – May 16, 1965; ) was a Chinese-American lawyer and politician from Seattle.

Luke served as an assistant attorney general of Washington for the state civil rights division from 1957 to 1962. He was later a member of the Seattle City Council for position 5 from 1962 until his death in 1965 in a plane crash. The Wing Luke Museum is named in his honor.

The first Asian-American to hold elected office in the state, Luke was cited as an inspiration by Gary Locke, the first Chinese-American governor of Washington.

== Early life and education ==

=== Family background and upbringing ===
Luke was born on February 18, 1925, in a small town near Canton (modern Guangzhou). His grandfather had run a laundry in Seattle, but exclusion laws forced Luke&#x27;s father to return to China. When Luke was five, his family moved to the United States, but he did not settle in Seattle until 1931, at the age of six. Upon their arrival in Seattle, the family saved to open a modest laundry and grocery store in the University District. Luke was the oldest of six children.

While in school, Luke was often teased for his Chinese origins and on multiple occasions got into physical confrontations with bullies. After the outbreak of World War II, Luke&#x27;s family was evicted from their apartment by their landlady for looking Japanese, which would instill in Luke a fire for social activism for the rest of his life. However, he eventually became the Roosevelt High School student body president. In 1944, his grades and civic activities earned him an invitation as a high school consultant for a White House Conference on juvenile problems, though Luke&#x27;s induction into the army would prevent him from attending. 

=== Military service ===
Only halfway through his senior year of high school, Luke was inducted into the U.S. Army. Initially in the Army Specialized Training Program, he then joined the infantry and field artillery and was acting first sergeant and regimental S-1 sergeant in the 40th division Field Artillery. He served in Guam, Korea, New Guinea, New Britain and the Philippines, where he received the Bronze Star Medal and six combat stars.

=== Higher education ===
Following his service, Luke entered the University of Washington. As in high school, Luke was a prominent leader. He was President of his sophomore class, the U.W. YMCA, the Baptist-Disciples&#x27; Student Center, the U.W. Red Cross, U.W. Young Democrats, and the committee chairman of A.S.U.W. Publications. He graduated from the university with a B.A. in political science and public administration. He did graduate work in the same fields at the American University in Washington, D.C. He then attended the UW School of Law to earn an LL.B.

== Legal and political career ==

Luke was appointed Assistant Attorney General of the State of Washington, in the Civil Rights Division and served in that capacity from 1957 to 1962. In 1962, Luke decided to run for an open seat on the Seattle City Council. Running on the slogan &quot;You are not electing a platform, but a Councilman,&quot; Luke maintained a pragmatic position on the issues and proved successful at mobilizing young volunteers. Despite having to defend against criticism of &quot;fence sitting,&quot; accusations of communism, and racial slurs, Luke won the council seat with a landslide of 30,000 votes and was sworn in on March 13, 1962. He became the first Asian American to hold elected office in the Pacific Northwest as well as the first person of color to hold a Seattle City Council seat.

As a Councilmember, Luke focused on urban renewal, historical preservation, and civil rights. The latter focus proved controversial, and Luke&#x27;s open-housing ordinance (created to prevent discrimination in the sale or rent of Seattle real estate) faced heavy resistance, though it eventually passed. For support in his community renewal efforts, Luke turned to a variety of local organizations he was active in, such as the Urban League, the Chinese Community Service Organization, the Japanese American Citizens League, and the Jackson Street Community Council.

Generally diplomatic and optimistic in his approach, Luke was notably skilled at appealing to diverse communities, having once learned to sing Norway&#x27;s entire national anthem in preparation for an address to the local Norwegian community. His political successes and general popularity led to speculation over a potential congressional or mayoral run.

==Death and legacy==

On May 16, 1965, Luke was killed in a plane crash with two others on Merchant Peak in Snohomish County, while returning from a fishing trip in Okanogan County. The wreckage was not found in the Cascade Mountains for more than three years. 

Luke is the namesake of multiple institutions. Friends and other supporters of Luke who raised money to search for him started the Wing Luke Memorial Foundation. The money went to the founding of the Wing Luke Museum in 1966 to present the histories and cultures of Asian immigrants and present-day issues of Asian Americans. Luke had reportedly mused about founding such a museum after observing how Chinese American culture in Seattle was so often swept under the rug. The museum remains located in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. 

In 2013, the United States Department of the Interior designated the Wing Luke Museum as being affiliated with the National Park Service. Rhea Suh, an Assistant Secretary of the Interior, stated &quot;As a first-generation Asian American and a senior appointee of the Obama Administration, I am humbled and inspired by the public service legacy of Wing Luke&quot;.

The Seattle school South Van Asselt School was renamed the Wing Luke Elementary School in 1969. In 2015, the Washington state attorney general&#x27;s office created the Wing Luke Civil Rights Unit to investigate issues related to discrimination and civil rights.

Gary Locke, the first Chinese-American governor of Washington and U.S. Ambassador to China, has cited Luke as an inspiration.

== Views ==
Luke saw many of his contemporaries forced to live in racialized pockets of Seattle like Beacon Hill (largely Asian Americans) and the Central District (largely African Americans), and felt strongly that the ability to decide where one lived should be a basic right of all citizens. Having firsthand awareness of the effects of racial discrimination, Luke was instrumental in Seattle&#x27;s passing of an Open Housing Ordinance in 1963 with punitive provisions against racial discrimination in the selling or renting of real estate. 

He also fought for civil rights, Indian fishing rights, urban renewal and historic preservation. Luke was particularly concerned with the preservation of Seattle&#x27;s Central Waterfront, Pioneer Square, and Pike Place Market.

<doc id="1069677" wikidata="Q723555" url="?curid=1069677" title="Aseity">
<text>Aseity (from Latin &quot;from&quot; and &quot;self&quot;, plus &quot;-ity&quot;) is the property by which a being exists of and from itself. It refers to the monotheistic belief that God does not depend on any cause other than himself for his existence, realization, or end, and has within himself his own reason of existence. This represents God as absolutely independent and self-existent by nature. While commonly discussed in Christian theology, many Jewish and Muslim theologians have also believed God to be independent in this way. This quality of independence and self-existence has been affirmed under various names by theologians going back to antiquity, though the use of the word &#x27;aseity&#x27; began only in the Middle Ages.

==Meaning==
Aseity has two aspects, one negative and one positive: absolute independence and self-existence. W. N. Clarke writes:

In its negative meaning, which emerged first in the history of thought, it [aseity] affirms that God is uncaused, depending on no other being for the source of His existence. In its positive meaning, it affirms that God is completely self-sufficient, having within Himself the sufficient reason for His own existence.
The first concept derives from &quot;the God of philosophers&quot; (a concept first described by Xenophanes), while the second one derives from &quot;the living God of Revelation&quot; (&quot;I Am Who I Am&quot;: Exodus ).

As a part of this belief, an aseitous God is said to be incapable of changing (see Hebrews 13:8) Changing implies development. Since God was, and is, and is to be the Absolute Perfection, there is no need to change: he is αὐτουσία (unchanged: Gregory of Nyssa), &quot;actus purus&quot; and &quot;ipsum esse subsistens&quot; (Thomas Aquinas).

Many (Thomas Aquinas, for instance) have also thought that aseity implies divine simplicity: that God has no parts of any kind (whether spatial, temporal, or abstract), since complexes depend on their individual parts, with none of which they are identical. Classical theists have often drawn a further implication: that God is without emotion or is &quot;impassible&quot;: because, it is said, emotion implies standing as patient (pass-) to some agent – i.e., dependence. This is so because, although God has created everything, he is not in dependence on his creation.

==Philosophical considerations==
Whether this being should be described as God turns on whether the label &#x27;Creator&#x27; is a rigid designator of God. Given that most theists believe all that is not God to be brought about by God, and that many (for example, St. Thomas Aquinas) argue from the non-aseity of the universe to the existence of God, this problem is highly theoretical. There is also a possible threat to divine aseity by the existence of abstract objects, a threat that philosopher William Lane Craig attempts to provide reconciliations for in his book, &quot;God Over All&quot;. John states that &quot;All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being&quot;. The aorist tense implies that everything that exists (other than God) came into being at some time in the past. This verse carries the weighty metaphysical implication that there are no eternal entities apart from God, eternal either in the sense of existing atemporally or of existing sempiternally. Rather everything that exists, with the exception of God Himself, is the product of temporal becoming.

Aseity has also been criticized as logically incompatible with the concept of God as a being or with God as existing. Furthermore, it can be argued that for the notion of aseity not to be logically circular or inconsistent, the supposed entity to which it applies would have to be identified with its properties, instead of instantiating, exemplifying or having its properties, and would therefore be a nonsentient force or potential of indeterminate vitality (see monad). This seems to contradict the notion that God is a person or a causal agent, for persons or agents are not properties (or complexes of properties).
Schopenhauer attributes Aseity (self-dependent) to will, as the only being by and of itself, apart from causal relationships.

<doc id="1069678" wikidata="Q849826" url="?curid=1069678" title="Cognitive restructuring">
<text>Cognitive restructuring (CR) is a psychotherapeutic process of learning to identify and dispute irrational or maladaptive thoughts known as cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking (splitting), magical thinking, overgeneralization, magnification, and emotional reasoning, which are commonly associated with many mental health disorders. CR employs many strategies, such as Socratic questioning, thought recording, and guided imagery, and is used in many types of therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT). A number of studies demonstrate considerable efficacy in using CR-based therapies.

==Overview==
Cognitive restructuring involves four steps:
# Identification of problematic cognitions known as &quot;automatic thoughts&quot; (ATs) which are dysfunctional or negative views of the self, world, or future based upon already existing beliefs about oneself, the world, or the future 
# Identification of the cognitive distortions in the ATs 
# Rational disputation of ATs with the Socratic method
# Development of a rational rebuttal to the ATs

There are six types of automatic thoughts:
# Self-evaluated thoughts
# Thoughts about the evaluations of others
# Evaluative thoughts about the other person with whom they are interacting
# Thoughts about coping strategies and behavioral plans
# Thoughts of avoidance
# Any other thoughts that were not categorized

==Clinical applications==
Cognitive restructuring has been used to help individuals experiencing a variety of psychiatric conditions, including depression, substance abuse disorders, anxiety disorders collectively, bulimia, social phobia, borderline personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and problem gambling.

When utilizing cognitive restructuring in rational emotive therapy (RET), the emphasis is on two central notions: (1) thoughts affect human emotion as well as behavior and (2) irrational beliefs are mainly responsible for a wide range of disorders. RET also classifies four types of irrational beliefs: dire necessity, feeling awful, cannot stand something, and self-condemnation. It is described as cognitive-emotional retraining. The rationale used in cognitive restructuring attempts to strengthen the client&#x27;s belief that (1) &quot;self-talk&quot; can influence performance, and (2) in particular self-defeating thoughts or negative self-statements can cause emotional distress and interfere with performance, a process that then repeats again in a cycle. Mood repair strategies are implemented in cognitive restructuring in hopes of contributing to a cessation of the negative cycle.

When utilizing cognitive restructuring in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), it is combined with psychoeducation, monitoring, &quot;in vivo&quot; experience, imaginal exposure, behavioral activation, and homework assignments to achieve remission. The cognitive behavioral approach is said to consist of three core techniques: cognitive restructuring, training in coping skills, and problem solving.

==Applications within therapy==

There are many methods used in cognitive restructuring, which usually involve identifying and labelling distorted thoughts, such as &quot;all or none thinking, disqualifying the positive, mental filtering, jumping to conclusions, catastrophizing, emotional reasoning, should statements, and personalization.&quot; The following lists methods commonly used in cognitive restructuring: 
*Socratic questioning
*Thought recording
*Identifying cognitive errors
*Examining the evidence (pro-con analysis or cost-benefits analysis)
*Understanding idiosyncratic meaning/semantic techniques
*Labeling distortions
*Decatastrophizing
*Reattribution
*Cognitive rehearsal
*Guided imagery
*Listing rational alternatives
*Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) includes awfulizing, when a person causes themselves disturbance by labelling an upcoming situation as &#x27;awful&#x27;, rather than envisaging how the situation may actually unfold, and Must-ing, when a person places a false demand on themselves that something &#x27;must&#x27; happen (e.g. &#x27;I must get an A in this exam&#x27;.)

==Criticism==

Critics of cognitive restructuring claim that the process of challenging dysfunctional thoughts will &quot;teach clients to become better suppressors and avoiders of their unwanted thoughts&quot; and that cognitive restructuring shows less immediate improvement because real-world practice is often required. Other criticisms include that the approach is mechanistic and impersonal and that the relationship between therapist and client is irrelevant. Neil Jacobson&#x27;s component analysis of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), claims that the cognitive restructuring component is unnecessary, at least with depression. He argues that it is the behavioural activation components of CBT that are effective in giving therapy, not cognitive restructuring, as delivered by cognitive behavioural therapy. Others also argue that it&#x27;s not necessary to challenge thoughts with cognitive restructuring.

<text>Jacob ben Meir (1100 – 9 June 1171 (4 Tammuz)), best known as Rabbeinu Tam (), was one of the most renowned Ashkenazi Jewish rabbis and leading French Tosafists, a leading &quot;halakhic&quot; authority in his generation, and a grandson of Rashi. Known as &quot;Rabbeinu&quot; (our teacher), he acquired the Hebrew suffix &quot;Tam&quot; meaning straightforward; it was originally used in the Book of Genesis to describe his biblical namesake, Jacob.

== Biography ==

Jacob ben Meir was born in the French country village of Ramerupt, today in the Aube département of northern-central France, to Meir ben Shmuel and Yocheved, daughter of Rashi. His primary teachers were his father and his brother, Shmuel ben Meir, known as Rashbam. His other brothers were Isaac, known as the Rivam, and Solomon the Grammarian. He married Miriam, the sister of Rabbi Shimshon ben Yosef of Falaise, Calvados, who may have been his second wife.

His reputation as a legal scholar spread far beyond France. Avraham ibn Daud, the Spanish chronicler of the sages, mentioned Rabbeinu Tam in his &quot;Sefer HaKabbalah&quot;, but not Rashi. The Italian Mishnaic exegete, Rabbi Isaac ben Melchizedek of Siponto, maintained a written correspondence with Rabbeinu Tam. Rabbeinu Tam&#x27;s work is also cited by Rabbi Zerachya HaLevi, a Provençal critic. He maintained a scholarly correspondence with Aaron ben Joseph of Beaugency and received questions from students throughout France and from the Italian communities of Bari and Otranto.

Rabbeinu Tam gave his Beth Din the title of &quot;the generation&#x27;s [most] significant court&quot;, and indeed, he is known for communal enactments improving Jewish family life, education, and women&#x27;s status. At times, he criticised Halakhic opponents, notably in his controversies with Meshullam of Melun and Efraim of Regensburg.

In or around 1160, a synod was held in Troyes as part of the &quot;Takkanot Shum&quot;. This synod was led by Rabbeinu Tam, his brother, the Rashbam, and Eliezer ben Nathan (the Ra&#x27;avan). Over 250 rabbis from communities all over France attended as well. A number of communal decrees were enacted at the synod covering both Jewish-Gentile relations as well as matters relating internally to the Jewish community.

==Halakhic disputes==
===Phylacteries===
Legend has it that when Rashi was holding his infant grandson, the baby touched the phylacteries (&quot;tefillin&quot;) that were on Rashi&#x27;s head. Rashi predicted that this grandson would later disagree with him about the order of the scripts that are put in the head tefillin. Regardless of the episode&#x27;s veracity, Rabbeinu Tam did disagree with the opinion of his antecedent. Today, both &quot;Rashi tefillin&quot; and &quot;Rabbeinu Tam tefillin&quot; are produced: the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; requires wearing Rashi&#x27;s version and recommends that God-fearing Jews wear both in order to satisfy both halakhic opinions. However: 

However, many Sephardic and chasidic Jews wear Rabbeinu Tam&#x27;s Tefillin (in addition to wearing Rashi&#x27;s) per opinions presented in the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; and its extensive commentaries authored throughout the early-modern and modern era. The rise and articulation of chasidic philosophy has conflated the kabbalistic and halakhic aspects of Rabbeinu Tam&#x27;s position, popularizing the custom to wear both pairs every day. Wearing Rabbeinu Tam tefillin is an almost universal custom among the many and diverse communities that follow the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov and his students.

===Mezuzah===
Another halakhic disagreement between Rabbeinu Tam and Rashi concerns the placement of the mezuzah. Rashi rules that it should be mounted on the doorpost in a vertical position; Rabbeinu Tam holds that it should be mounted horizontally. In a compromise solution, many Ashkenazi Jews place the mezuzah on the door in a slanted position. Sephardi Jews mount the mezuzah vertically, per the opinions of Rashi, Maimonides, and the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;.

== Liturgical poet ==

In the field of Hebrew poetry the importance of R. Tam is not slight. He was influenced by the poetry of the Spaniards, and is the chief representative of the transition period, in Christian lands, from the old &quot;payyeṭanic&quot; mode of expression to the more graceful forms of the Spanish school. According to Zunz, he composed the following pieces for the synagogue: (1) several poems for the evening prayer of Sukkot and of Shemini Atzeret; (2) a hymn for the close of Sabbath on which a wedding is celebrated; (3) a hymn for the replacing of the Torah rolls in the Ark on Simchat Torah; (4) an &quot;ofan&quot; in four metric strophes; (5) four Aramaic &quot;reshut&quot;; (6) two &quot;selichot&quot; (the second is reproduced by Zunz in &quot;S.P.&quot; p. 248, in German verse). It must, however, be remarked that there was a synagogal poet by the name of Jacob ben Meïr (Levi) who might easily have been confounded with the subject of this article, and therefore Tam&#x27;s authorship of all of these poems is not above doubt.

The short poems which sometimes precede his &quot;responsa&quot; also show great poetic talent and a pure Hebrew style (see Bacher in &quot;Monatsschrift&quot;, xliv.56 et seq.). When Abraham ibn Ezra was traveling through France R. Tam greeted him in verse, whereupon Ibn Ezra exclaimed in astonishment: &quot;Who has admitted the French into the temple of poetry?&quot; (&quot;Kerem Ḥemed&quot;, vii.35). Another work of his in metric form is his poem on the accents, which contains forty-five strophes riming in; it is found in various libraries (Padua, Hamburg, Parma), and is entitled &quot;Maḥberet.&quot; Luzzatto has given the first four strophes in &quot;Kerem Ḥemed&quot; (vii.38), and Halberstam has printed the whole poem in Kobak&#x27;s &quot;Jeschurun&quot; (v.123).

== Gravesite ==

Rabbeinu Tam and his brothers, the Rashbam and the Rivam, as well as other Tosafists, were buried in Ramerupt. The unmarked, ancient cemetery in which they are buried lies adjacent to a street called Street of the Great Cemetery. In 2005, Rabbi Yisroel Meir Gabbai, a Breslover Hasid who renovates and repairs neglected gravesites of Jewish leaders around the world, helped to determine the exact boundaries of the cemetery. In addition, a member of the Jewish religious community in Paris bought a house at the site and converted it into a beth midrash.

== Works ==

Rabbeinu Tam&#x27;s best known work is &quot;Sefer HaYashar&quot;, which contained both &quot;novellae&quot; and &quot;responsa&quot;, its main purpose to resolve Talmudic textual problems without resorting to emendations of the received text. Even the best editions show considerable corruption of the original work, and all present editions of &quot;Sefer HaYashar&quot; are fragments collected from it. &quot;Responsa of Rabbeinu Jacob of Ramerupt&quot; (Hebrew) was published by Rabbi Yosef Kafih in 1968. Tam also authored a much-cited work of Biblical philology, &quot;Rulings of Rabbeinu Tam,&quot; in which he weighed in on the debates of Menahem b. Saruq and Dunash b. Labrat.

<text>The Wing Luke Museum is a museum in Seattle, Washington, United States, which focuses on the culture, art and history of Asian Pacific Americans. It is located in the city&#x27;s Chinatown-International District. Established in 1967, the museum is a Smithsonian Institution affiliate and the only pan-Asian Pacific American community-based museum in the country. It has relocated twice since its founding, most recently to the East Kong Yick Building in 2008. In February 2013 it was recognized as one of two dozen affiliated areas of the U.S. National Park Service.

==Collections==
The Wing Luke Museum&#x27;s collections have over 18,000 items, including artifacts, photographs, documents, books, and oral histories. Parts of the museum&#x27;s collections are viewable through its online database. There is an oral history lab inside the museum for staff and public use.

==Exhibits==
The Wing houses temporary and permanent exhibitions related to Asian American history, art, and cultures. The museum represents over 26 ethnic groups.

The museum uses a community-based exhibition model to create exhibits. As part of the community-based process, the museum conducts outreach into communities to find individuals and organizations to partner with. The museum then forms a Community Advisory Committee (CAC) to determine the exhibit&#x27;s direction. Staff at the museum conduct research, gather materials, and record relevant oral histories under the guidance of the CAC. The CAC also determines the exhibit&#x27;s overall design and content. This process can take 12 to 18 months.

In 1995, the Wing Luke Museum received the Institute for Museum and Library Services National Award for Museum Service for its exhibit process. Award-winning exhibits by the museum include Do You Know Bruce?, a 2014 exhibit on Bruce Lee. The Association of King County Historical Organizations awarded Do You Know Bruce? the 2015 Exhibit Award.

==History==
The museum is named for Seattle City Council member Wing Luke, the first Asian American elected to public office in the Pacific Northwest. Luke suggested the need for a museum in the Chinatown-International District in the early 1960s to preserve the history of the rapidly changing neighborhood. After Luke died in a small plane crash in 1965, friends and supporters donated money to start the museum he envisioned. The Wing Luke Memorial Museum, as it was first named, opened in 1967 in a small storefront on 8th Avenue.

Initially, the museum focused on Asian folk art, but soon expanded its programming to reflect the diversity of the local community. The museum exhibited the work of emerging local artists, and by the 1980s pan-Asian exhibits made by community volunteers became central to the museum.

In 1987, the Wing Luke Museum moved to a larger home on 7th Avenue and updated its name to Wing Luke Asian Museum. It achieved national recognition in the 1990s under the direction of local journalist Ron Chew, a pioneer of the community-based model of exhibit development that placed personal experiences at the center of exhibit narratives.

In 2008, the museum moved to a larger building at 719 South King Street, in the renovated 1910 East Kong Yick Building. The Museum continued addressing civil rights and social justice issues, while preserving historic spaces within the building including the former Gee How Oak Tin Association room, the Freeman SRO Hotel, a Canton Alley family apartment, and the Yick Fung Mercantile.

In 2010, the museum changed its name to the Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience, informally &quot;The Wing&quot;. 

Nine of the museum&#x27;s windows along Canton Alley were destroyed on September 14, 2023, in a crime that was described as &quot;racially motivated&quot;. In response, the Washington State Department of Commerce and City of Seattle made financial donations to the museum, and the broken windows were replaced with a decorative mural.

In May 2024, around half of the museum&#x27;s employees walked out to protest a new exhibit titled &quot;Confronting Hate Together&quot;, claiming that part of the exhibit &quot;conflate[s] anti-Zionism with antisemitism&quot; and demanding in writing that &quot;We really want the museum to take a pro-Palestinian stance&quot;.

==Location==

===Building===
The East Kong Yick Building, where the Museum is located, along with the West Kong Yick Building, were funded by 170 Chinese immigrants in 1910. In addition to storefronts, the East Kong Yick Building contained the Freeman Hotel, which was used by Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino immigrants until the 1940s. The museum&#x27;s galleries now share the building with re-creations of the Gee How Oak Tin Association&#x27;s meeting room, kitchens, and apartments that were inside the hotel. The museum also preserves the contents of a general store, Yick Fung Co., which the owner donated in its entirety.

===Neighborhood===
The museum is in Seattle&#x27;s Chinatown-International District next to Canton Alley, historically a residential, commercial, and communal area. The Wing runs Chinatown Discovery Tours, a tour service founded in 1985 that takes visitors to significant sites within the neighborhood.

<text>Stratiotes is a genus of submerged aquatic plant commonly known as water soldiers, described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753. Several specific names have been coined within the genus, but at present only one is recognized: &quot;Stratiotes aloides&quot;. native to Europe and NW Asia.

;formerly included in genus
moved to other genera: &quot;Enhalus Hydrocleys Ottelia&quot; 
# &quot;Stratiotes acoroides - Enhalus acoroides&quot; 
# &quot;Stratiotes alismoides - Ottelia alismoides&quot; 
# &quot;Stratiotes nymphoides - Hydrocleys nymphoides&quot; 
# &quot;Stratiotes quinquealatus - Ottelia alismoides&quot;

==Description==

The leaves are serrate and very brittle, breaking easily when handled. Reproduction is generally by offsets, which may number five or more per plant. In the UK, male plants have rarely if ever been recorded, although some hermaphrodite flowers have been recorded from more southerly locations. Sexual reproduction is not known to occur. A characteristic of the genus is the habit of the plants rising to the surface at flowering time.
==Ecology==

The plant appears to be associated with calcareous waters and there is a suggestion that changing levels of calcium carbonate on the leaves may explain the floating and submerging behaviour.

The rare dragonfly, the Norfolk hawker (&quot;Aeshna isosceles&quot;), relies on the presence of &quot;Stratiotes aloides&quot; as a food source for the smaller insects on which it feeds.
The plant is very winter hardy.

==Fossil record==
Several fossil seeds of †&quot;Stratiotes kaltennordheimensis&quot; have been extracted from borehole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland.

==Uses==

&quot;Stratiotes aloides&quot; is commonly used in cool water ponds and aquariums in Europe.

<doc id="1069701" wikidata="Q2557709" url="?curid=1069701" title="Spring Snow">
<text>is a novel by Yukio Mishima, the first in his Sea of Fertility tetralogy. It was published serially in &quot;Shinchō&quot; from 1965 to 1967, and then in book form in 1969. Mishima did extensive research, including visits to Enshō-ji in Nara, to prepare for the novel.

==Plot==
The novel is set in the early years of the Taishō period with the reign of the Emperor Taishō, and is about the relationship between Kiyoaki Matsugae, the son of a rising up and coming rich family, and Satoko Ayakura, the daughter of an aristocratic family fallen on hard times. Shigekuni Honda, a schoolfriend of Kiyoaki&#x27;s, is the main witness to the events. The novel&#x27;s themes centre on the conflicts in Japanese society caused by westernization in the early 20th century.

The main action stretches from October 1912 to March 1914. Kiyoaki&#x27;s family originated in Kagoshima, where his dead grandfather, the former Marquis, is still revered. The family now lives in grand style near Tokyo, with wealth acquired very recently.

===Kiyoaki&#x27;s world===
The novel opens with images from Kiyoaki&#x27;s childhood, in the years after the Russo-Japanese War: including a torchlight procession witnessed by Honda, a photograph of memorial services at Tokuri-ji on 26 June 1904, a lyrical description of the Matsugae estate near Shibuya, a visit by Emperor Meiji, and an account of Kiyoaki&#x27;s role as a page for Princess Kasuga during New Year&#x27;s Festivities at the Imperial Palace. We are introduced to his mother, Tsujiko, and grandmother, to Shigeyuki Iinuma, his tutor, and to the serious Honda, a friend from the Peers School.

On Sunday, 27 October 1912, the 18-year-old Kiyoaki and Honda are talking on an island in the ornamental lake on the estate when they see Kiyoaki&#x27;s mother, her maids, and two guests: Satoko Ayakura, the 20-year-old daughter of a count, and her great-aunt, the Abbess of Gesshu. The Ayakura family is one of twenty-eight of the rank of &quot;Urin&quot;, and they live in Azabu. Kiyoaki is aware that Satoko has a crush on him, and pretends indifference to her. Shortly after they all meet, there is a bad omen: they see a dead black dog at the top of a high waterfall. The Abbess offers to pray for it. Satoko insists on picking flowers for the dog with Kiyoaki. While Satoko is alone with Kiyoaki, she blurts out: &quot;Kiyo, what would you do if all of a sudden I weren&#x27;t here any more?&quot; He is discomfited by the inexplicable question, and resents the fact that she has startled him with it.

Back at the house, the Abbess delivers a sermon on the doctrine of &quot;Yuishiki&quot; or the consciousness-only theory of Hosso Buddhism, telling the parable of Yuan Hsiao, the man who, in pitch darkness, drank from a skull by accident. She argues the significance of an object is bestowed by the observer.

Ten days later, on 6 November, Kiyoaki has dinner with his parents; they discuss his , that had been held on 17 August 1909, and mention that Satoko has just rejected an offer of marriage. This explains her mysterious question. Kiyoaki and his father play billiards, then go for a stroll that reminds Kiyoaki of his father&#x27;s former womanising. The marquis tries to persuade him to go with him to a brothel and he walks away in disgust. Later he cannot sleep, resolving to take revenge on Satoko for deliberately perplexing him. We are shown Kiyoaki&#x27;s bedroom: a screen bearing poems of Han Shan, and a carved jade parrot. We can also see that Kiyoaki has three moles in a row on the left side of his back.

===The Siamese princes, Iinuma and Tadeshina===
In December, two princes arrive from Siam to study at the Peers School, and are given rooms by the Matsugaes. They are Prince Pattanadid (a younger brother of the new king, Rama VI) and his cousin, Prince Kridsada (a grandson of Rama IV), nicknamed &quot;Chao P.&quot; and &quot;Kri&quot;, respectively. Chao P is deeply in love with Kri&#x27;s sister, Princess Chantrapa (&quot;Ying Chan&quot;), and wears an emerald ring she gave him as a present. They ask Kiyoaki if he has a sweetheart and he names Satoko, although he has just sent her a &quot;wildly insulting letter&quot; the day before, in which he claims falsely that he has recently visited a brothel for the first time and has lost all respect for women, including her. To save the situation, he telephones Satoko and makes her promise to burn any letter she receives from him, and she agrees.

Chapter 7 describes Honda&#x27;s stuffy household, and includes his musings on the Laws of Manu, which he has been required to study, and an anecdote about a second cousin, Fusako, who was caught making a pass at him at a family gathering.

The two princes meet Satoko at the Imperial Theatre in Tokyo. She is courteous, and Kiyoaki concludes that she has burnt the letter. Chapter 9 portrays Shigeyuki Iinuma, a reactionary 23-year-old from Kagoshima, who has been Kiyoaki&#x27;s tutor for the last six years. He bemoans his ineffectiveness, and the decadent state of Japan, while worshipping at the Matsugae family&#x27;s shrine. Shortly after the new year, Kiyoaki reveals to him that he knows of his affair with a maid, Miné, and blackmails him into concealing his own trysts with Satoko. Satoko&#x27;s maid, old Tadeshina, promises to help.

In Chapter 11, we are given an extract from Kiyoaki&#x27;s dream-diary.

===Kiyoaki and Satoko===
One day in February, Satoko&#x27;s parents travel to Kyoto to see a sick relative; taking advantage of this, she persuades Kiyoaki to skip school and join her on a rickshaw ride through the snow. They kiss for the first time. When they pass the parade ground of the Azabu 3rd Regiment he has a vision of thousands of ghostly soldiers standing upon it, reproducing the scene in the photograph described in Chapter 1. Miles away, Honda has a similar premonitory shudder, seeing his friend&#x27;s empty desk in the schoolroom. The next morning, they meet very early in the school grounds and have a long conversation in which Honda expresses his conviction of the reality of fate and inevitability.

In Chapter 14, it is revealed that Kiyoaki has rewarded Iinuma for his cooperation by giving him the key to the library so that the tutor can meet Miné there secretly. Iinuma hates him for this but accepts the arrangement. Satoko writes her first love letter, and Kiyoaki, torn between his morbid pride and his genuine passion for her, finally replies to it sincerely.

On 6 April 1913, the Marquis Matsugae holds a cherry blossom viewing party for his friend Prince (Haruhisa) Toin, inviting only Satoko and her parents, the two princes, and Baron Shinkawa and his wife. The guests are depicted as ludicrously half-Westernised. During a private moment, Satoko and Kiyoaki embrace, but suddenly Satoko turns away and spurns him, calling him childish. Infuriated, Kiyoaki tells Iinuma what has happened, and the tutor responds with a story which makes him realise that Satoko did indeed read the letter she was supposed to burn. He concludes that she has been leading him on all along in order to humiliate him.

Breaking off all contact, he eventually burns a letter from her in front of Iinuma.

===Prince Harunori and Satoko===
Towards the end of April, the Marquis tells Kiyoaki that Satoko is being considered as a wife for Prince Toin&#x27;s third son. Kiyoaki responds with indifference. The Marquis then announces to his son&#x27;s surprise that Iinuma is to be dismissed: the affair with Miné has been discovered. The same night, Kiyoaki has another dream.

In early May, Satoko visits the Toinnomiya villa by the sea and meets Prince Harunori. Formal proposals quickly follow by mail. Kiyoaki is filled with satisfaction to see Satoko, Tadeshina and Iinuma drift out of his life; and he takes pride in his lack of emotion when Iinuma tearfully takes his leave, later comparing his own ultra-correct conduct with the elegant progress of a beetle on his window-sill. The absence of Iinuma makes that year&#x27;s &quot;omiyasama&quot; festival, commemorating Kiyoaki&#x27;s grandfather, more perfunctory than ever.

In the meantime, the Thai princes have moved from the Matsugae household to private dormitories on the grounds of the Peers School. Chao P. asks Kiyoaki to return him his emerald ring from the marquis&#x27;s safe-keeping; he has not received a letter from Ying Chan in months, and is pining for her. Kiyoaki tears up the one last letter he receives from Satoko. One day, his mother leaves for the Ayakura villa in order to congratulate the family, casually informing him that the marriage to Prince Harunori will now definitely go ahead. All of a sudden he feels emotionally shattered, and spends the next few hours in a daze. At the end of it, he realizes he is in love with Satoko. This is the turning point of the novel.

===Kasumicho and Kamakura===
He takes a rickshaw to the Ayakura villa, and, making sure his mother has left, sends for Tadeshina. Astonished, she takes him to an obscure boarding-house in Kasumicho where he threatens to show Satoko&#x27;s last letter (which he tore up) to Prince Toin if she does not arrange a meeting. Three days later, he returns to the boarding-house and encounters Satoko; they make love; to Tadeshina&#x27;s despair, he demands another encounter.

Kiyoaki goes directly to Honda and gives a full account of everything that has happened. His friend is amazed, but supportive; not long afterwards, a visit to the district court solidifies his decision not to involve himself in the drama of other people&#x27;s lives.

At this time, Chao P loses his emerald ring at the Peers School. Kri insists that it has been stolen, but the prefect forces the pair to search through 200 square yards of grass in the rain. This incident prompts them to leave the school. The Marquis Matsugae, fearing that they will leave Japan with unpleasant memories, asks them not to return to Siam immediately but to join his family at their holiday villa at Kamakura for the summer. It is there that the subject of reincarnation is brought up for the first time, in conversations between Kri, Chao P, Honda and Kiyoaki. The liaison between Kiyoaki and Satoko is maintained by Honda, who arranges for a Ford Model T to transport Satoko between Tokyo and Kamakura in secret. Kiyoaki has a third major prophetic dream.

The Thai princes receive a letter informing them of the death of Ying Chan by illness. Devastated, they return to Siam a week later.

===Discovery===
Tadeshina learns from the Matsugaes&#x27; steward that Kiyoaki does not possess Satoko&#x27;s last letter, but continues to cover for them. In October, she realises that Satoko is pregnant, a fact they both hide from Kiyoaki. At the restaurant of the Mitsukoshi department store, they inform him that there can be no further contact. Kiyoaki and Honda, while discussing this, stumble across another bad omen: a dead mole on the path in front of them. Kiyoaki picks it up and throws it in a pond.

After a long period of no news, Kiyoaki is summoned to the billiard-room by his father. Tadeshina has attempted suicide, leaving a confidential note to the Marquis revealing the affair to him. At first, the Marquis talks calmly, but when Kiyoaki is unapologetic he beats his son with his billiard-cue. Kiyoaki is rescued by his grandmother; the household immediately starts to focus on limiting the damage.

Count Ayakura is strongly tempted to punish Tadeshina, but she knows too much about his secret resentment of the upstart Matsugaes, and he cannot afford to give her any encouragement to reveal it—in particular, the instruction he gave her (in 1905) that Satoko should lose her virginity before any bridegroom chosen by the Marquis should touch her.

The Marquis Matsugae meets Count Ayakura and they arrange an abortion for Satoko in Osaka. On the way back to Tokyo, Satoko and her mother stop at the Gesshu Temple to see the Abbess. Satoko slips away and hides from her mother, who later discovers that she has cut off her hair and resolved to become a nun. The Abbess, who suspects that a plot against the Emperor is unfolding, hopes to thwart it by shielding Satoko. Baffled as to what to do, the weak-willed Countess returns to Tokyo for help. But neither the Count nor the Marquis succeed at removing Satoko from the convent.

===Final events===
The betrothal is cancelled with a forged medical certificate, backdated a month, declaring Satoko to be mentally ill. In February 1914, Honda gives Kiyoaki money to travel to the convent in an effort to meet Satoko. He turns up at the front door repeatedly but is always rebuffed, and his health declines as he forces himself to trudge through the snow from the inn in Obitoke to the convent and back again as a form of penance. Eventually Honda comes looking for him after receiving a telegram, and is shocked to see how ill he is; concluding that a meeting with Satoko is vital, he goes to the convent alone on February 27, but the Abbess firmly refuses to allow any such meeting, and on the same night Honda and Kiyoaki leave for Tokyo.

During the train journey, the deathly sick Kiyoaki tells Honda: &quot;Just now I had a dream. I&#x27;ll see you again. I know it. Beneath the falls.&quot; He has written a note to his mother, asking her to give Honda his dream-diary. Two days after his return, on 2 March 1914, Kiyoaki dies at the age of 20.

== Reception ==
A writer for &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote, &quot;Mishima&#x27;s novel begins slowly but picks up momentum in the second half along with episodes of sly humor as well as the tragedy of its finale.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hortense Calisher stated that &quot;Spring Snow&quot; is praiseworthy for &quot;its marvelous incidentals, graphic and philosophic, and for its scene-gazing [...] no doubt partially researched, but the author&#x27;s vitality and native omniscience are triumphant.&quot; Charles Solomon wrote in 1990 that &quot;the four novels remain one of the outstanding works of 20th-Century literature and a summary of the author’s life and work.&quot;

In 2014, Yasser Nasser of &quot;The Bubble&quot; lauded &quot;Spring Snow&quot; as easily the best of the &quot;Sea of Fertility&quot; tetralogy, as well as &quot;one of those novels of the last century that is almost perfectly written, capturing a sense of tragedy that Japanese literature has always been so wont to do. [...] Mishima manages to deftly avoid any entanglement in the melodramatic.&quot; Nasser said the book is tonally consistent and that the novelist sticks to narrative &quot;without getting lost in dream-like descriptions&quot; like Yasunari Kawabata. A writer for &quot;The Quill&quot; stated that in &quot;Spring Snow&quot; Mishima &quot;shows the sheer beauty and power that Japanese poetry can carry&quot;, and the reviewer described a speech about changing history as &quot;perhaps [...] comparable to Shakespeare&#x27;s &#x27;To be, or not to be&#x27;&quot; soliloquy. In 2014, the novel was ranked in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; as one of the 10 all-time greatest Asian novels.

The David Bowie song &#x27;Heat&#x27; from &quot;The Next Day&quot; (2013) makes reference to the dog scene from the book in the song&#x27;s opening.

<text>Northwest Seaport Maritime Heritage Center is a nonprofit organization in Seattle, Washington dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of Puget Sound and Northwest Coast maritime heritage, expressed through educational programs and experiences available to the public aboard its ships. The organization owns three large historic vessels docked at the Historic Ships&#x27; Wharf in Seattle&#x27;s Lake Union Park; the tugboat &quot;Arthur Foss&quot; (1889), Lightship 83 Swiftsure (1904), and the halibut fishing schooner &quot;Tordenskjold&quot; (1911). These vessels are used as platforms for a variety of public programs, ranging from tours and festivals to restoration workshops and vocational training.

Northwest Seaport is adjacent to the Center for Wooden Boats and the Museum of History and Industry on the south shore of Lake Union in downtown Seattle. These organizations have partnered in many public programs and events at Lake Union Park but are not affiliated with each other. Northwest Seaport also is not affiliated in any way with the Northwest Seaport Alliance, the joint port authority for the cities of Seattle and Tacoma, newly formed in 2015.

==History of the organization==
Northwest Seaport was founded in the early 1960s as the Save Our Ships project to save the 1897 Pacific schooner &quot;Wawona&quot;. Save Our Ships purchased &quot;Wawona&quot; in 1964, followed by Lightship 83 &quot;Relief&quot; in 1966 (subsequently changed to &quot;Swiftsure&quot; lightship station), and received the tugboat &quot;Arthur Foss&quot; as a donation from the Foss company in 1970.

Save Our Ships was based in Kirkland, on Lake Washington, throughout the 1970s, eventually changed its name to Northwest Seaport, and then relocated to its current site on Lake Union (on the edge of downtown Seattle) in the early 1980s.

Northwest Seaport has been a primarily volunteer organization throughout its half century of service. The decline of its flagship by the early 2000s, however, prompted the board of directors to focus on hiring professional staff to manage the ships and the organization.

==Programs==

Northwest Seaport offers programs ranging from public tours, festivals, and story times for toddlers to vocational training in the marine trades and traditional maritime music sing-alongs.

==Historic fleet==
The historic fleet at Lake Union Park&#x27;s Historic Ships Wharf includes four vessels on the National Register of Historic Places: Two of these belong to Northwest Seaport. The other two belong to other non-profit organizations. Northwest Seaport&#x27;s third vessel on the wharf is in the process of being nominated for NHL status.

===Tugboat &quot;Arthur Foss&quot;===
The tugboat &quot;Arthur Foss&quot;, built in 1889, is the oldest wooden-hulled tugboat afloat in the United States. In 1898, in response to the Klondike Gold Rush, she transported barges full of gold-seeking miners and supplies up the Inside Passage to Alaska. There are no other Alaska gold rush vessels still operating today. She was cast by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie studio to play in its 1933 production &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot;. In World War II, &quot;Arthur Foss&quot; journeyed south to join the war effort. Before the Battle of Wake Island began in December 1941, she was the last vessel to escape. After the war she was used in the timber industry until retirement in 1968.

The &quot;Arthur Foss&quot; has a six-cylinder, diesel engine. Her top speed is . The vessel is long with a beam of and a draft of . When last operated the vessel was owned by Foss Launch and Tug (now Foss Maritime) who donated her to Northwest Seaport in 1970. The vessel was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989 and is a city landmark as well.

===Lightship 83 &quot;Swiftsure&quot; (previously known as &quot;Relief&quot;)===
&quot;Lightship #83&quot;, known to most by its station name, &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, is a lightvessel launched in Camden, New Jersey, in 1904. It served with the United States Lighthouse Service from 1904 to 1939 and then the United States Coast Guard from 1939 to 1960. The ship is now a museum vessel and is moored in Seattle, Washington.

In 1904–1905, LV-83 steamed around the tip of South America to her first station at Blunts Reef in California, where she saved 150 people when their ship ran aground in dense fog. In 1929, LV-83 was transferred to the San Francisco lightship station, changing the lettering on its side. It served as an armed patrol boat in WWII, then returned to lightship duty, and then in 1951 was transferred to Seattle and assigned the station name &quot;Relief&quot;, operating as the alternate, or relief vessel, for the newer primary lightships on the Columbia River bar, Umatilla Reef, and Swiftsure stations. &quot;Swiftsure&quot; refers to the Swiftsure Bank near the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca separating Washington and Vancouver Island.

&quot;Swiftsure&quot; is one of the oldest lightships in the country and the only one to have her original steam engine. She is 129 feet long, with a beam of 28 feet, six inches and a draft of 12 feet, six inches. Her displacement is 668 tons. Her aids to navigation include a 1,000 watt primary light, a 140-decibel Diaphone foghorn, and a 1,000 pound foredeck fog bell.

The ship was decommissioned in 1960, and purchased by Northwest Seaport in 1966. She is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989, and is on the Washington State Heritage Register. She is moored on Lake Union, in Seattle, Washington, for restoration.

=== Halibut Schooner &quot;Tordenskjold&quot; ===
The 1911 halibut schooner, &quot;Tordenskjold&quot;, joined the Northwest Seaport fleet in February 2017. It was built in Seattle&#x27;s Ballard neighborhood by renown boatbuilder, John Strand, in 1911. &quot;Tordenskjold&quot; fished the North Pacific and Bering Sea for over 100 years, never missing a season. From 1911 to 1934 its crew of 14 used dories to longline for halibut and cod. Then, after dories were outlawed, longlines were deployed off the boat itself. In 1939 its second captain, Carl Serwold, rerigged the boat as a trawler. Sometimes fishing for himself and sometimes fishing under charter to the International Pacific Halibut Commission, Washington Fish and Game, or other entities, &quot;Tordenskjold&quot; caught shrimp, king crab, and shark. In 1979 the boat was purchased by Marvin Gjerde and Per Odegaard (owner &amp; captain of the F/V &quot;Vansee&quot;). They re-rigged &quot;Tordenskjold&quot; as a longliner again and for the next three-and-a-half decades, Marvin Gjerde fished halibut and black cod again. &quot;Tordenskjold&quot; retired from active fishing at the end of the 2012 summer season. Gjerde and Odegaard donated &quot;Tordenskjold&quot; to Northwest Seaport in 2017. The boat is kept in operational condition and visits regional boat shows as Northwest Seaport&#x27;s mobile ambassador.

===Fishing troller &quot;Twilight&quot;===
&quot;Twilight&quot; is a fishing vessel. Launched from Seattle&#x27;s Fishermen&#x27;s Terminal in 1933, she trolled in the Pacific until the 1980s, and came to Northwest Seaport in 2000. &quot;Twilight&quot; is currently stored on shore while funds are raised for its restoration.

===Schooner &quot;Wawona&quot;===
The three-masted, fore-and-aft schooner &quot;Wawona&quot; sailed from 1897 to 1947 as a lumber carrier and later as a fishing vessel based in Puget Sound. The schooner was built in Fairhaven, on California&#x27;s Humboldt Bay, by H.D. Bendixsen, one of the most important West Coast shipbuilders of the late 19th century. From 1897 to 1913, she carried lumber from Grays Harbor and Puget Sound ports to California. One of her captains, Ralph E. &quot;Matt&quot; Peasley, inspired a series of popular novels.

&quot;Wawona&quot; was long on deck with a beam. Her masts, stood from the keel.

She was berthed at South Lake Union Park in Seattle adjacent to the Center for Wooden Boats. She was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Washington State Heritage Register, and the vessel was an official city landmark. However, after efforts to restore the decaying ship failed, she was dismantled in March 2009. After conferring with many experts in the maritime heritage field, locally and across the nation, Northwest Seaport created a plan to preserve key artifacts from the vessel. Graduate students from East Carolina University&#x27;s program in nautical archaeology documented the &quot;Wawona&quot; during the Wooden Boat Festival on 4–6 July 2008. In March 2009, the vessel was carefully deconstructed in a local shipyard and artifacts (including wooden knees, beams, and paneling) removed for storage and later display in on-land exhibits and memorials. Some parts of the &quot;Wawona&quot; were donated to be used on the &quot;C.A. Thayer&quot; in San Francisco.

<text>Pontederiaceae is a family of flowering plants.
The APG IV system of 2016 (unchanged from the APG III system of 2009, the APG II system of 2003 and the APG system of 1998) places the family in the order Commelinales, in the commelinid clade, in the monocots. It is a small family of heterostylous aquatic plants, occurring in tropical and subtropical waters. Charles Darwin was interested in the specialized form of heterostyly found in the family, known as tristyly. Not all of the species are heterostylous. The family contains two genera with around 40 known species.

It is best known for the water hyacinth (&quot;Pontederia crassipes&quot;), which is an invasive species in many waterways. The highly modified &quot;Heteranthera gardneri&quot; is a submerged aquatic with a two-flowered pseudanthium.

<text>Cherry Marmalade is the first solo album by Kay Hanley, released in 2002 (see 2002 in music).

==Critical reception==
Linda Laban of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; considered &quot;Cherry Marmalade&quot; one of the top ten CDs released in 2002. Laban described it as &quot;sexy, clever, catchy pop&quot;.

John Wirt of &quot;The Advocate&quot; said, &quot;Hanley&#x27;s versatile voice runs from reedy and tough to airy and vulnerable. Her singing&#x27;s fully exploited through multi-tracking. Hanley&#x27;s music and lyrics, either written by her alone or with Eisenstein, are as fetching and varied as anything Letters to Cleo did.&quot;&quot; Wirt described &quot;Cherry Marmalade&quot; as &quot;one of the more pleasing pop-rock CDs of 2002.

Craig S. Simon of the Worcester Telegram and Gazette described &quot;Cherry Marmalade&quot; a &quot;joyous collection of the kind of smart and spunky pop tunes that seem to be few and far between these days.&quot;

Chuck Campbell of the &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot; said the album &quot;often sounds like it&#x27;s lacking a focal point&quot; and &quot;that Hanley struggles for a sense of purpose as she works her way through the enervating muddiness&quot;.

Elysa Gardner of &quot;USA Today&quot; called &quot;Cherry Marmalade&quot;, &quot;insubstantial and bland&quot;.

After &quot;Cherry Marmalade&quot; did not make a large commercial impact, Hanley said, &quot;I have to remind people all the time (especially my mom) that my goal is not to reach a mass audience but to consistently put out my own version of good pop music to as many, or few, people who want to hear it. Letters to Cleo never made massively popular records, and I probably never will either, but I&#x27;ll always make music, so if you want to hear it, I&#x27;ll keep making it.&quot;

<doc id="1069723" wikidata="Q5141399" url="?curid=1069723" title="Cohomology ring">
<text>In mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, the cohomology ring of a topological space &quot;X&quot; is a ring formed from the cohomology groups of &quot;X&quot; together with the cup product serving as the ring multiplication. Here &#x27;cohomology&#x27; is usually understood as singular cohomology, but the ring structure is also present in other theories such as de Rham cohomology. It is also functorial: for a continuous mapping of spaces one obtains a ring homomorphism on cohomology rings, which is contravariant.

Specifically, given a sequence of cohomology groups &quot;H&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;X&quot;;&quot;R&quot;) on &quot;X&quot; with coefficients in a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; (typically &quot;R&quot; is Z&quot;n&quot;, Z, Q, R, or C) one can define the cup product, which takes the form

:formula_1

The cup product gives a multiplication on the direct sum of the cohomology groups

:formula_2

This multiplication turns &quot;H&quot;•(&quot;X&quot;;&quot;R&quot;) into a ring. In fact, it is naturally an N-graded ring with the nonnegative integer &quot;k&quot; serving as the degree. The cup product respects this grading.

The cohomology ring is graded-commutative in the sense that the cup product commutes up to a sign determined by the grading. Specifically, for pure elements of degree &quot;k&quot; and ℓ; we have

:formula_3

A numerical invariant derived from the cohomology ring is the cup-length, which means the maximum number of graded elements of degree ≥ 1 that when multiplied give a non-zero result. For example, a complex projective space has cup-length equal to its complex dimension.

== Examples ==
*formula_4 where formula_5.
*formula_6 where formula_5.
*formula_8 where formula_9.
*formula_10 where formula_9.
*formula_12 where formula_13.
*formula_14 where formula_13.
*By the Künneth formula, the mod 2 cohomology ring of the cartesian product of &quot;n&quot; copies of formula_16 is a polynomial ring in &quot;n&quot; variables with coefficients in formula_17.
*The reduced cohomology ring of wedge sums is the direct product of their reduced cohomology rings.
*The cohomology ring of suspensions vanishes except for the degree 0 part.

<text>Independent Labour Publications is a left-wing pressure group inside the British Labour Party. It is the successor to the Independent Labour Party and is mostly known simply as &quot;The ILP&quot; in order to maintain that link with its predecessor organisation.

==Brief history==
Since its re-establishment in 1975, the ILP has been a campaigning organisation rather than an electoral group (its constitution prevents full members from standing for elective office). Before entering parliament, former Labour Member of Parliament Harry Barnes was a member of the ILP. As an MP, he was obliged to resign and join a supporters group, Friends of the ILP.

It has been involved with opposition to various workfare schemes imposed by the British Conservative government of the 1980s, and has argued for open democratic structures within the Labour Party, and an emphasis on co-operative systems of organising economic activity.

With a headquarters in Leeds, the ILP meets in Scarborough annually to discuss political issues, and its internal administration is overseen by a National Administrative Council (NAC).

== Positions ==
In common with much contemporary left-wing thinking, the ILP&#x27;s approach rejects both contemporary capitalism and the command economy. But unlike much of the left, it accepts the idea of a market economy as part of democratic socialist thinking. The ILP has been out of line with many traditional leftist positions, for instance in its rejection of a simple &quot;troops out&quot; approach to the conflict in Northern Ireland, and was critical of what it saw as knee-jerk anti-Americanism on the left following the US&#x27;s reaction to the September 11, 2001 attacks.

==Publications==
The organisation publishes occasional pamphlets on contemporary issues. The paper &quot;Labour Leader&quot; (published 1975–86) and the &quot;ILP Magazine: for socialist renewal&quot; (published 1987–92) were successors to the Independent Labour Party&#x27;s &quot;New Leader&quot; (1922–46) and &quot;Socialist leader&quot; (1946–75). A newsletter called &quot;Democratic Socialist&quot; was the belated successor to the &quot;ILP Magazine&quot;.

<text>This is a list of [[pals battalions]] (also called &quot;service&quot; or &quot;locally raised&quot; battalions) of the British Army during the First World War. Pre-war Territorial Force (T.F.) battalions have not been included, although they too usually recruited from a specific area or occupation. The 69 line infantry regiments formed 142 &quot;locally raised&quot; battalions and 68 &quot;local reserve&quot; battalions. The Guards Regiments and the regiments formed only from Territorial Force battalions did not form pals battalions.

==History==
Lord Kitchener was one of the few people in 1914 to realise that the First World War was not going to be a short one; he believed that it would last three years and would require an army of 70 divisions. He eschewed the Territorial Forcepartly due to the limitations imposed by its terms of service but also due to the poor impression he formed when observing the French Territorials in the Franco-Prussian Warand did not make use of the framework envisioned by Haldane&#x27;s Reforms. He launched his appeal for 100,000 volunteers on 7 August 1914 to form a first New Army of six divisions (and support units) and within a few days this target had been reached; by the end of September, half a million volunteers had come forward to form the New Armies.

Each of the 69 line infantry regiments raised one battalion for the First (K1) and for the Second New Armies (K2) designated as &quot;service&quot; battalions and numbered after the existing Territorial Force battalions of their parent regiments. This rigid structure did not take account of the differing ability of regiments to raise troops based upon the population of their recruiting areas. Therefore, the Third New Army (K3) had a much higher proportion of battalions from the more populous north of England, notably Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Durham and Northumberland. The Fourth New Army (K4) was formed from men of the Reserve and Special Reserve battalions which were over establishment. Originally formed into the 30th35th Divisions, these were broken up so the battalions could train recruits and send drafts to the first three New Armies.

While the first four New Armies were being raised, a number of &quot;service&quot; battalions were also being raised by committees in cities and towns, and by other organizations and individuals. These units were recruited on a more narrow basis than usual, such as men who worked in a specific occupation or at a certain business, and were popularly known as &quot;pals battalions&quot;. These were housed, clothed and fed by their committees until the War Office took them over in 1915 and the raisers&#x27; expenses were refunded. These units formed the Fifth and Sixth New Armies (later called the new Fourth and Fifth New Armies when the original Fourth New Army was broken up).

The locally recruited battalions also formed depot companies and in 1915 these were grouped into &quot;reserve&quot; battalions to provide reinforcements for their parents. They became part of the Training Reserve on 1 September 1916.

===Units===

The recruitment of pals battalions was confined to the 69 line infantry regiments of the British Army. The Guards Regiments and regiments formed only from Territorial Force battalions did not form any pals battalions. Amongst the line infantry regiments, there was considerable variation in the number of battalions recruited, depending upon the population of the regiment&#x27;s recruiting areas. No pals battalions were raised in the more rural areas of England, the Scottish Highlands, or Ireland.

The Northumberland Fusiliers raised the largest number of pals battalions (twelve) of any regiment, followed by ten raised by the Royal Fusiliers, nine for the Welch Regiment, nine for the Middlesex Regiment, and nine for the Manchester Regiment. The Royal Irish Rifles had nine battalions raised in a similar fashion from the Ulster Volunteer Force.

In all, 142 &quot;service&quot; battalions and 68 &quot;reserve&quot; battalions were formed.

===Formations===

The pals battalions formed the bulk of the infantry for the divisions of the Fifth New Army (30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th, and 35th) and the Sixth New Army (36th (Ulster), 37th, 38th (Welsh), 39th, 40th, and 41st). The exceptions were:
* the 37th Division was made up of 13 Army Troops battalions from the First (2), Second (2) and Third (9) New Armies.
* the 14th (Service) Battalion, Princess Louise&#x27;s (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) was raised as part of the original 33rd Division of the Fourth New Army. When the Fourth New Army was broken up, it was reassigned to the 118th Brigade, 39th Division.

A handful of battalions served away from the Fifth and Sixth New Army divisions:
* 10th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (Stockbrokers) was initially an &#x27;Army Troops&#x27; battalion attached to the 54th Brigade, 18th (Eastern) Division (Second New Army), and then served with 37th Division on the Western Front
* 25th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) (Frontiersmen) served in the East African Campaign from May 1915 to the end of 1917
* 21st (Service) Battalion, Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own (West Yorkshire Regiment) (Wool Textile Pioneers) as Pioneers in the Regular 4th Division
* 11th (Service) Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment (Midland Pioneers) as Pioneers in the Regular 6th Division
* 13th (Service) Battalion, Cheshire Regiment was locally raised but was assigned to the 74th Brigade, 25th Division (Third New Army)
* 13th (Service) Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment (Severn Valley Pioneers) as Pioneers in the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division
* 10th (Service) Battalion, Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry (Cornwall Pioneers) as Pioneers in the Regular 2nd Division
* 23rd (Service) Battalion, Welsh Regiment (Welsh Pioneers) as Pioneers in the Regular 28th Division
* 26th (Service) Battalion, Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own (Middlesex Regiment) (3rd Public Works Pioneers) as Pioneers in the Regular 27th Division
* 20th (Service) Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (British Empire League Pioneers) as Pioneers in the Regular 3rd Division
* 22nd (Service) Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (3rd County Pioneers) as Pioneers in the Regular 8th Division

<doc id="1069758" wikidata="Q1197013" url="?curid=1069758" title="The Toy (1982 film)">
<text>The Toy is a 1982 American comedy film directed by Richard Donner. The film stars Richard Pryor as a janitor at a department store owned by a businessman played by Jackie Gleason. The owner&#x27;s son, played by Scott Schwartz, is told that he may have anything in the toy department. He chooses the janitor, who the owner pays to spend a week with the boy. The film also stars Ned Beatty, Teresa Ganzel, and Virginia Capers. It is an adaptation of the 1976 French comedy film &quot;Le Jouet&quot;. It was a box office success, despite being pilloried by film critics.

== Plot ==
Jack Brown is an unemployed writer in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in danger of having his house repossessed. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to get a job working for the local paper, the &quot;Bugle&quot;, he becomes so desperate that he ends up taking a job as a janitor for the wealthy and ruthless businessman U.S. Bates, who owns the paper, a department store and many other businesses. Brown is humiliated as he clumsily attempts to serve food at a luncheon. He is fired by Bates but still shows up to work that evening at the department store. &quot;Master&quot; Eric Bates, the spoiled son of the boss, sees Jack while looking through Bates&#x27; department store. Amused at seeing Jack goof around in the store&#x27;s toy section, Eric informs his father&#x27;s long-suffering right-hand man, Sydney Morehouse, that what he wants is Jack himself.

Morehouse fails to convince Eric that human beings cannot be owned. In exchange for a generous financial settlement to stave off repossession, Jack agrees to be Eric&#x27;s live-in friend during Eric&#x27;s one-week spring break from military school.

Emotionally estranged from his father, Eric takes a liking to Jack but still manages to humiliate him with numerous pranks. After a particularly humiliating incident in the mansion incited by Bates&#x27; ditzy trophy wife Fancy, who introduces him at a dinner party as Eric&#x27;s new &quot;toy&quot;, Jack grows tired of the situation and leaves. He agrees to return only when Bates (with Morehouse as his proxy) offers Jack enough money to pay off the full mortgage.

Jack returns, determined to teach Eric how a friend is supposed to be treated. They bond while participating in mini-cart racing, video games, and fishing. The pair decide to start a newspaper of their own. After witnessing multiple examples of Bates&#x27; cruelty to his employees, they dig up dirt on him, such as a story of how he won his butler, Barkley, in a game of billiards. They publish their paper and distribute it throughout the city. When Morehouse finds a copy and presents it to his boss, Bates is outraged, but keeps his anger in check and calls Jack and Eric for a private meeting at his office.

To prove to his son that money can buy loyalty, he offers Jack a reporting job with his newspaper in exchange for shutting their newspaper down, which is what Jack wanted all along. When he accepts, Eric is upset because he thinks Jack is selling out. Jack tells Eric that most men need jobs, just as his priority is to support himself and his wife.

An outdoor party is later held at the Bates estate, attended by prominent citizens who are supporters of a senator. They are unaware that members of the KKK are also in attendance. Jack&#x27;s wife, Angela, tries to bring attention to this with her anti-Klan group, but Jack convinces her to leave. He learns the true reason for the party is to get the KKK Grand Wizard and the senator together in a picture, which Bates would then use to blackmail the senator. Jack and Eric team up to disrupt the party, which is witnessed from afar by Angela and her group. Jack informs the senator of Bates&#x27; intentions and he leaves the party in outrage. Jack then proceeds to embarrass the Grand Wizard by causing him to fall into a bowl of chocolate fudge. The Grand Wizard throws a pie at Jack, but hits a policeman instead, leading to his arrest. Bates chases after Jack in a golf cart but ends up crashing into the pool. Jack saves him from drowning and Bates thanks him while confessing that he feels Eric doesn&#x27;t love him. Jack then tells Bates that he must tell Eric that he loves him and show him that he loves him. Jack then leaves for home.

The next day, while driving Eric to the airport to return to military school, Bates tries desperately to have a heart-to-heart talk. Eric runs off to Jack&#x27;s house. Jack refuses to let Eric live with him and gently admonishes the boy to give his father a chance. Bates arrives and confesses to his son how much he truly does love him and Eric finally accepts it and the two embrace. As he and Eric depart for the airport, Bates says his offer for the newspaper job stands and promises Eric that next year he will have two weeks of spring vacation: one with Jack and one with himself, much to Eric&#x27;s joy.

==Production==
The film was made by Rastar, the company of Ray Stark, then under the head of a production Guy McElwaine, who had been an agent of clients including Pryor before being enticed to join Rastar.

In his autobiography &quot;Pryor Convictions&quot;, Pryor wrote that he and Gleason got along like &quot;kindred souls&quot;. He stated the stories Gleason told between setups were funnier than the film itself. Moreover, in a 1982 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interview Pryor stated he had &quot;loved Jackie Gleason for years.&quot; A national talent search was held to find an actor to play Gleason&#x27;s son.

Pryor cast Annazette Chase to portray Angela after they worked together in &quot;The Mack&quot; (1973). The film was shot on location in Baton Rouge, Louisiana during the summer of 1982.

In May, during filming, Pryor was hospitalized with pneumonia. He was released after a week and resumed filming. Donner blamed this on the air pollution in Baton Rouge which he said was the worst he had ever experienced. The director said he would &quot;never&quot; work in the city again.

Michael Jackson attempted to write a theme song for the film and a possible soundtrack in 1981, but did not complete it due to his commitments working on the &quot;Thriller&quot; album. Jackson would continue to rework the track throughout his career, renaming it &quot;I Am Your Joy&quot;, and eventually, &quot;Best of Joy&quot;. A version recorded in 2008 was remixed by Theron &quot;Neff-U&quot; Feemster and Brad Buxer, being released posthumously on the &quot;Michael&quot; album in 2010. In 2022, Jackson&#x27;s original demo was released on &quot;Thriller 40&quot; under the title &quot;The Toy&quot;.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film opened in the United States the same weekend as &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot; and &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; and finished at number one for the weekend with a gross of $6,322,804 from 1,381 screens. Despite the bad reviews, the film was a financial success and grossed $47,118,057 in the United States and Canada.

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Toy&quot; was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 3% based on reviews from 30 critics, with the consensus reading: &quot;A muddled and unfunny collision of two comedic titans, &quot;The Toy&quot; is unsuitable for children -- or anyone else seeking entertainment.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 16 based on 8 reviews, indicating an &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;.

Vincent Canby gave the film a negative review, stating &quot;My mind wasn&#x27;t simply wandering during the film—it was ricocheting between the screen and the exit sign.&quot;

<text>Pontederia is a genus of tristylous aquatic plants, members of which are commonly known as pickerel weeds. &quot;Pontederia&quot; is endemic to the Americas, distributed from Canada to Argentina, where it is found in shallow water or on mud. The genus was named by Linnaeus in honour of the Italian botanist Giulio Pontedera.

&quot;Pontederia&quot; plants have large waxy leaves, succulent stems and a thick pad of fibrous roots. The roots give rise to rhizomes that allow rapid colonization by vegetative reproduction. Species are perennial, and produce a large spike of flowers in the summer. There is a species of bee (&quot;Dufourea novaeangliae&quot;) that exclusively visits &quot;Pontederia cordata&quot;; waterfowl also eat the fruit of the plant.

&quot;Pontederia cordata&quot; and &quot;Pontederia crassipes&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Eichhornia crassipes&quot;), have become invasive in many tropical and temperate parts of the globe, but are, on the other hand, efficient biological filters of polluted water in constructed wetlands.

<text>Betty Mahmoody (née Lover; born June 9, 1945) is an American author and public speaker best known for her book, &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot;, which was subsequently made into a film of the same name. She is the President and co-founder of &quot;One World: For Children&quot;, an organization that promotes understanding between cultures and strives to offer security and protection to children of bi-cultural marriages.

==&quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot;==
Her book, &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot;, is an account of her experiences in 1984–1986 when she left Alpena, Michigan to go to Iran with her husband and daughter for what she was promised would be a short visit. Once there, she and her daughter were held against their will. The book was made into a 1991 film starring Sally Field as Betty.

According to the book, she and her husband, Sayyed Bozorg “Moody” Mahmoody, and their daughter, Mahtob Mahmoody, traveled to Iran in August 1984 for what her husband said would be a two-week visit with his family in Tehran. Once the two weeks were over, however, he refused to allow his wife and child to leave. When she protested, Moody struck Betty. It was the first time Mahtob had seen her father hit her mother. After Moody broke the news to Betty, she got extremely sick with dysentery. Mahtob sat at her side day after day, watching her fade in and out of consciousness. Betty asked Mahtob to make sure Moody, a medical doctor, didn’t give her an injection as she feared it may have been lethal. Mahtob sat there and made sure her mother was safe. Betty was trapped in a nation hostile to Americans, with in-laws who were hostile to her, and an abusive husband. According to the book, her husband separated her from her daughter for weeks on end. He also assaulted her and threatened to kill her if she tried to leave.

She eventually escaped with her daughter. The book details her escape over the snowy Zagros Mountains into Turkey, and the help she received from many Iranians. These claims, however, have not been verified by any resources. After returning to the USA in 1986, she filed for divorce.

==Other books==
Mahmoody compiled stories of other parents whose foreign spouses estranged them from their children in the book &quot;For the Love of a Child&quot; (1992).

==Personal life==
Mahmoody is a devout member of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod like her daughter Mahtob. In 1992 she was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa, the National Leadership Honor Society, by Ferris State University as an &quot;honoris causa&quot; initiate.

She has two sons from a previous marriage, Joseph and John, who are 13 and nine years older than Mahtob, respectively.

<text>Hugh Garner (February 22, 1913 – June 30, 1979) was a British-born Canadian novelist.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hugh Garner was born on February 22, 1913, in Batley, Yorkshire, England. He came to Canada in 1919 with his parents, and was raised in Toronto, Ontario where he attended Danforth Technical High School.

During the Great Depression, he rode the rails in both Canada and the United States, and then joined the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. During World War II he served in the Royal Canadian Navy.

===Career===
Following the war, Garner concentrated on his writing. He published his first novel, &quot;Storm Below&quot;, in 1949. Garner&#x27;s most famous novel, &quot;Cabbagetown&quot;, depicted life in the Toronto neighbourhood of Cabbagetown, then Canada&#x27;s most famous slum, during the Depression. It was published in abridged form in 1950, and in an expanded edition in 1968. &quot;The Intruders&quot;, a sequel depicting the gentrification of the neighbourhood, was published in 1976.

Later in his career, he concentrated on mystery novels, including &quot;Death in Don Mills&quot; (1975) and &quot;Murder Has Your Number&quot; (1978).

His background (poor, urban, Protestant) is rare for a Canadian writer of his time. It is nevertheless, the foundation for his writing. His theme is working-class Ontario; the realistic novel his preferred genre. &quot;Cabbagetown&quot; is the best-known example of his style. His focus on the victimization of the worker reflects his socialist roots.

In 1963, he won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for his collection of short stories entitled &quot;Hugh Garner&#x27;s Best Stories.&quot; Garner struggled much of his life with alcoholism, and died in 1979 of alcohol-related illness. A housing cooperative in Cabbagetown is named in his memory.

===Death===
He died on June 30, 1979.

<text>Macquarie Business School (MQBS) is a constituent body of Macquarie University, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

MQBS is a business school originally established as the Faculty of Business and Economics. The School is the focal point for all business, management, economics research and education at Macquarie University.

== History of Macquarie Business School ==
Macquarie Business School began life as the Centre for Management Studies (CMS) within the school of Economic and Financial Studies at North Ryde, Sydney, Australia in 1969. CMS began offering a Graduate Diploma in Business Administration in 1970 and in 1972 it offered a three-year, part-time Master of Business Administration (MBA). In early 1980, CMS developed its own identity as the Graduate School of Management (GMS); it remained within the School of Economic and Financial Studies.

In the mid-1980s the GSM Advisory board recommended GSM should have a separate identity and its own separate dedicated teaching facility. Funds were raised to build the campus from the late 1980s and during the 1990s.

GSM moved to a 40-week teaching term, four-term year in 1989–1990 and this enabled the development of a 16-unit MBA which could be completed in two years&#x27; part-time. Master of Arts programmes were developed and later replaced by Master of Management programmes. GSM went offshore and began delivering programmes in Singapore in 1992 and in Hong Kong in 1994.Until 1998, MGSM consisted of two institutions, the GSM and MGSM. At this time the board decided to integrate the school and the new entity became known as MGSM.
The Sydney CBD campus was opened in 2000. MGSM launched its Online Interactive Study option in Term one of 2013.

In early 2009, the Deputy Vice Chancellor Macquarie University undertook a major review process of MGSM which decided that the school should retain its autonomy. A later review merged the MGSM into the Macquarie Business School from 2019.

== Programs ==
Macquarie Business School offers a diverse selection of programs catering to undergraduate and postgraduate students, along with Master of Business Administration (MBA) and executive courses and higher degree research. The school ranked number 1 in Australia for Master of Marketing: QS Business Masters Rankings 2023, ranked number 1 in Australia for Master of Applied Finance: QS Business Masters Rankings 2023 and is in the top 100 MBA&#x27;s worldwide.

<doc id="1069835" wikidata="Q2825615" url="?curid=1069835" title="Aerocar 2000">
<text>The Aerocar 2000 was a proposed flying car under development in the early 2000s in the United States. The Aerocar 2000 was designed by Ed Sweeney, who was inspired by Moulton Taylor&#x27;s Aerocar of the 1950s (and is the owner of the only still-flying example of this vehicle). The Aerocar 2000 consisted of a removable wings, tail, and powerplant &quot;flight module&quot; added to a modified Lotus Elise roadster.

==Comparison to original Aerocar==

In conception, this was far closer to the AVE Mizar of the early 1970s than to Taylor&#x27;s designs, the vehicle portions of which were purpose-designed and built. Another difference with the original Aerocar (and similarity to the Mizar) is that the flight module is not designed to be taken away from the airfield. Finally, while the Aerocar used the one engine to drive both the road wheels and the propeller, the Aerocar 2000 (again like the Mizar) uses two separate engines. In the Aerocar 2000&#x27;s case, the flight engine is a twin-turbocharged V-8 motor from a Lotus Esprit. A far lighter three-cylinder engine and gearbox from a Chevrolet Sprint is to be installed in the road module to power the vehicle on the ground.

<text>The Goliad Campaign was the failed 1836 Mexican offensive to retake the Texas Gulf Coast during the Texas Revolution. Mexican troops under the command of General José de Urrea ambushed Groups of Texians in the Mexican province of Texas, known as Mexican Texas, in a series of clashes in February and March.

When Mexico transitioned to a centralized government in 1835, supporters of federalism took up arms. Texians in Texas, primarily from the towns of Gonzales and Columbia, revolted in October 1835 and by the end of the year had expelled all Mexican troops from their province. With hostilities temporarily suspended, Frank W. Johnson and James Grant gathered volunteers for a planned invasion of the Mexican port town of Matamoros. James Fannin commanded troops stationed at Fort Defiance in Goliad.

Unbeknownst to the Texians, on February 18 Urrea led a large contingent of troops from Matamoros into Texas to neutralize the rebels gathered along the coast. His troops easily defeated Johnson&#x27;s small force at the Battle of San Patricio on February 26. Several days later, informants revealed Grant&#x27;s location, and on the morning of March 2, 150 Mexican troops ambushed Grant&#x27;s men at the Battle of Agua Dulce. The Mexican army then turned northward, headed towards Goliad. On March 12, they encountered a group of Texian soldiers, under the command of William Ward at Refugio. The Texians repulsed Mexican attacks for several days. On March 15, as their ammunition ran short, Texians retreated from Refugio. Many were killed or captured.

Fannin ordered the bulk of his army to retreat from Goliad on March 19, in the hopes of joining the forces of General Sam Houston. That afternoon, Urrea&#x27;s troops surrounded the Texians on an open prairie. The Battle of Coleto ended with a Texian surrender on March 20. Urrea marched the Texians back to Fort Defiance, where they were held under guard. One week later, under the orders of Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna, the Texians were marched outside the fort and shot.

News of the Goliad Massacre spread outrage, resentment, and fear among the population of the fledgling Republic of Texas and abroad.

== Background ==
Under President Antonio López de Santa Anna, the Mexican government began to shift away from a federalist model to a more centralized government. His increasingly dictatorial policies, including the revocation of the Constitution of 1824 in early 1835, incited federalists throughout the nation to revolt. The Mexican army quickly put down revolts in the Mexican interior, including a brutal suppression of militias in Oaxaca and Zacatecas. Unrest continued in the Mexican state Coahuila y Tejas. The area that bordered the United States, known as Texas, was populated primarily by English-speaking settlers, known as Texians. In October, the Texians took up arms in what became known as the Texas Revolution. The following month, Texians declared themselves part of a state independent from Coahuila and created a provisional state government based on the principles of the Constitution of 1824. By the end of the year, all Mexican troops had been expelled from Texas.

Determined to quash the rebellion, Santa Anna began assembling a large force to restore order; by the end of 1835 his army numbered 6,019 soldiers. In late December, at his behest, the Mexican Congress passed the Tornel Decree, declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops &quot;will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag&quot;. In the early nineteenth century, captured pirates were executed immediately. The resolution thus gave the Mexican Army permission to take no prisoners in the war against the Texians. Santa Anna personally led the bulk of his troops inland to San Antonio de Béxar and ordered General José de Urrea to lead 550 troops along the Atascocita Road toward Goliad.
In Goliad, Colonel James Fannin commanded the Texan force of nearly 500 trained soldiers and militia. Fannin had chosen to keep his troops at Goliad mainly because it had a fort, from which he believed it would be easier to fight than out in the open. Fannin also believed that by occupying Goliad, he could prevent Mexican commander Antonio López de Santa Anna from drawing supplies from the Gulf of Mexico, but Fannin was called to assist Colonel William Travis at the Alamo. On February 26, 1836, he attempted to march to San Antonio but turned back at the San Antonio River because of the inability to travel with the artillery and arms. Meanwhile, Mexican forces under General José de Urrea were quickly reaching Goliad, and they defeated three Texan forces at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27, the Battle of Agua Dulce on March 2, and the Battle of Refugio on March 12.

== Battle of Refugio ==
Fannin sent Captain Amon B. King on a mission to Refugio on March 11, to remove several noncombatant families out of the path of Urrea&#x27;s army. On March 13, King was surrounded by elements of the Mexican army and sent out a plea for help to Fannin, who sent Lieutenant-Colonel William Ward and the Georgia Battalion to reinforce him. Urrea, meanwhile, heard of their presence and marched a flying column of 300 Mexican troops to Refugio, hoping to overtake the Texians. On March 14, Ward defended his position at the Refugio Mission, while King&#x27;s men fought from a stand of trees. The two sides clashed and fought until dark with Urrea&#x27;s soldiers suffering heavy casualties, when Colonel Ward received word from Fannin to rendezvous at Victoria. That night, King led his men in an independent escape attempt. They were overtaken shortly and surrendered for lack of munitions. Captain King and all but one man were executed in short order.

Ward and the Georgia Battalion attempted to escape to Victoria, where they expected to link up with the balance of Fannin&#x27;s command. After wandering on the coastal prairie for several days, the Georgia Battalion reached Victoria, only to find it in the possession of the Mexican army. They then headed for Lavaca Bay, where they would end up surrounded. Short on munitions and supplies, with no hope of rescue, the majority of Ward&#x27;s men voted to surrender under good terms. Only then were they made aware that Colonel Fannin and his men had already surrendered following the Battle of Coleto. They were marched back to Goliad to face the same fate as the rest of Fannin&#x27;s command.

== Fannin&#x27;s retreat and the Battle of Coleto ==

Fannin was ordered by General Sam Houston on March 11, 1836, to abandon Goliad and retreat to the Guadalupe River near Victoria. However, he had sent most of his carts and horses with Ward to Refugio and had no cavalry. He sent couriers to Ward, but most of them were intercepted by Urrea&#x27;s cavalry. Fannin hoped to retreat to Victoria, but he hesitated for several days. Urrea, meanwhile, sent cavalry to surround and isolate Goliad. He linked up with several more units of Mexican infantry, bringing the total number of Mexican troops in the area to 1,500.

===Coleto Creek===

On March 18, Urrea&#x27;s advance scouts were viewing Goliad. Not until the morning of March 19 did Fannin finally begin his retreat from Goliad. Weighted down with cannon and 500 extra guns, Fannin burned his extra supplies in an attempt to lighten the load. The Texians had traveled only six miles (10 km) from their fort when, on March 19, the Mexican army engaged the Texians on an open prairie. The Texians were less than one mile (1.6 km) from the safety of the tree line of Coleto Creek. That afternoon, Urrea&#x27;s cavalry encircled the Texians. After several hours of fighting, the Mexicans had suffered an estimated 200 casualties and the Texians nine killed and about sixty wounded. Fighting was halted that day at dark. Fannin could have probably cut his way to safety, but he refused to abandon the wounded. The next morning, seeing Urrea receive one hundred more men and three more artillery pieces, Fannin agreed to surrender. Fannin met to discuss terms with Colonel Juan José Holzinger (&quot;Holsinger&quot;). Fannin was unaware General Santa Anna had decreed execution for all rebels. General Urrea negotiated surrender &quot;at the disposal of the Supreme Mexican Government&quot;, falsely stating that no prisoner taken on those terms had lost his life.

== The Massacre ==

The Texians were marched back to Goliad and held as prisoners at Fort Defiance, each believing that they were going to be set free in a matter of weeks. Knowing the prisoners&#x27; probable fate, General Urrea departed Goliad, leaving command to Colonel Jose Nicolas de la Portilla, and later writing to Santa Anna to ask for clemency for the Texians. Urrea wrote in his diary that he &quot;...wished to elude these orders as far as possible without compromising my personal responsibility.&quot; On March 26, 1836, 19:00, Portilla received orders from Santa Anna in triplicate to execute the prisoners. At around 8 a.m. on Palm Sunday, March 27, 1836, Colonel Portilla had the able bodied of 342 Texians marched out of Fort Defiance into three columns on the Bexar Road, San Patricio Road, and the Victoria Road.

Once the columns reached their selected location, the Mexican &quot;soldados&quot; formed into two ranks on one side of the captives. The Texians were then fired on at point-blank range only a few hundred yards from the fort. The wounded and dying were then clubbed and stabbed. Those who survived the initial volley were run down by the Mexican cavalry. Fannin&#x27;s men wounded in the Battle of Coleto were shot or bayoneted where they lay, inside the presidio.

Colonel Fannin was the last to be executed, after seeing his men butchered. He was taken by Mexican soldiers to the courtyard located in front of the chapel along the north wall, blindfolded, and seated in a chair due to his leg wound received in battle. Before his execution he made three requests. He asked for his personal possessions to be sent to his family, to be shot in his heart and not his face, and that he be given a Christian burial. His personal possessions were taken by Mexican soldiers, he was shot in the face, and Fannin&#x27;s body was burned along with the many other Texians who died that day.

Twenty-eight Texians managed to escape by feigning death and other means. Three known survivors escaped to Houston&#x27;s army and participated in the Battle of San Jacinto. In some accounts of the Goliad Massacre, a Mexican woman, Francisca (Francita, Panchita or Pancheta) Alavez, sometimes referred to by other names (Alvarez or Alavesco), rescued about 20 Texian soldiers and became known as &quot;The Angel of Goliad.&quot; Other people known to have rescued some prisoners were: Juan Holzinger (saved two German Texians captured among Capt. Amon B. King&#x27;s men and at Victoria he saved twenty-six of Lt. Col. William Ward&#x27;s troops by claiming to need them to transport cannons across the San Antonio River), Colonel Garay, Father Maloney (also referred as Molloy), Urrea&#x27;s wife and an unnamed girl.

==Written account==
One survivor of the massacre, a young German named H. Von Ehrenberg, wrote an account of the murders on December 3, 1853. He said the Texan prisoners and American volunteers numbered about 400, while the Mexican captors totaled 700, in addition to cavalry and smaller groups of Mexican soldiers he saw gathered on the prairie. He described the slaughter:

Another written account can be found in &quot;Early Times in Texas&quot; (serial form, 1868–71; book, 1892) by John Crittenden Duval.

<text>Pistia is a genus of aquatic plants in the arum family, Araceae. It is the sole genus in the tribe Pistieae which reflects its systematic isolation within the family. The single species it comprises, Pistia stratiotes, is often called water cabbage, water lettuce, Nile cabbage, or shellflower. Its native distribution is uncertain but is probably pantropical; it was first scientifically described from plants found on the Nile near Lake Victoria in Africa. It is now present, either naturally or through human introduction, in nearly all tropical and subtropical fresh waterways and is considered an invasive species as well as a mosquito breeding habitat. The specific epithet is derived from a Greek word, στρατιώτης, meaning &quot;soldier&quot;, which references the sword-shaped leaves of some plants in the &quot;Stratiotes&quot; genus.

==Description==

&quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; is a perennial monocotyledon with thick, soft leaves that form a rosette. It floats on the surface of the water, its roots hanging submersed beneath floating leaves. The leaves can measure 2 – 15 cm long and are light green, with parallel venations and wavy margins. The surface of the leaves is covered in short, white hairs which form basket-like structures that can trap air bubbles and increase the plant&#x27;s buoyancy. The spongy parenchyma with large intercellular spaces in the leaves also aids the plant in floating. The flowers are dioecious, lack petals, and are hidden in the middle of the plant amongst the leaves. &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; has a spadix inflorescence, containing one pistillate flower with one ovary and 2–8 staminate flowers with two stamens. The pistillate and carpellate flowers are separated by folds in the spathe, where the male flowers are located above the female flowers. Oval, green berries with ovoid seeds form after successful fertilization. The plant undergoes asexual reproduction by propagating through stolons, yet evidence of sexual reproduction has also been observed in the ponds of Southern Brazil.

&quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; are found in slow-moving rivers, lakes, and ponds. The species displays optimal growth in the temperature range of  22–30 °C, but can endure extreme temperatures up to 35 °C. As a result, &quot;Pistia&quot; &quot;stratiotes&quot; do not grow in colder temperatures, beyond the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The species also require slightly acidic water in the pH range of 6.5–7.2 for optimal growth.

==Invasion==
Water lettuce is among the world&#x27;s most productive freshwater aquatic plants and is considered an invasive species. The species can be introduced to new areas by water dispersal, fragmentation, and hitchhiking on marine transportation or fishing equipment. The invasion of &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; in the ecosystem can lead to environmental and socio-economic ramifications to the community it serves. In waters with high nutrient content, particularly those that have been contaminated with human loading of sewage or fertilizers, water lettuce can exhibit weedy overgrowth. It may also become invasive in hydrologically altered systems such as flood control canals and reservoirs. The severe overgrowth of water lettuce can block gas exchange in the surface water, creating hypoxic conditions and eliminating or disrupting various native marine organisms. Blocking access to sunlight, large mats of water lettuce can shade native submerged plants and alter communities relying on these native plants as a source of food. The growth of these mats can also get tangled in boat propellers and create challenges for boaters or recreational fishermen.

&quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; feature in the life cycles of certain insect vectors for malaria and filariasis. Mosquitoes of the genus &quot;Mansonia&quot; can lay their eggs under the leaves of aquatic plants, such as &quot;Pistia stratiotes.&quot; Twenty-four hours later, the emerging larvae attach to the plant&#x27;s roots using its siphon tube for respiration. Within a week, larvae can develop into adult mosquitos, making &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; a potential breeding ground for vectors of infectious disease. The moth &quot;Samea multiplicalis&quot; also uses &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; as its primary host plant. Eggs are laid among leaves and stems of the host plant and larvae hatch and feed intensively as they develop.

===Control===

# Chemical control: Herbicides have been effective in controlling &quot;Pistia stratiotes:&quot; diquat, glyphosate, terbutryn, 2,4-D, among many others. Yet, the use of herbicides must be critically assessed to prevent negative environmental impacts and possible toxic effects on marine life and human health.
# Physical control: &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; can be controlled with mechanical harvesters that remove the water lettuce from the infested waters and transport it to disposal onshore. Larger infestations can be removed with the aid of hydraulic excavators and tractors. To prevent the re-growth of &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; colonies, a long-term maintenance program should be implemented.
# Biological control: Two species of insects are also being used as a biological control. Adults and larvae of the South American weevil &quot;Neohydronomous affinis&quot; feed on &quot;Pistia&quot; leaves, as do the larvae of the moth &quot;Spodoptera pectinicornis&quot; from Thailand. Both are proving to be useful tools in the management of &quot;Pistia&quot; &quot;stratiotes&quot; through the experimental recovery of benthic communities with hypoxic conditions.
The species is set to be banned in the EU from August of 2024 to prevent spreading.

==Range==
The center of origin of &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; has long been a source of debate. Nativity to northern Africa is indicated by Egyptian hieroglyphics and reports of plants meeting the description of &quot;Pistia&quot; by Greek botanists, Dioscorides and Theophrastus in the Nile River. In addition, the co-evolution of &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; with various insects native to Brazil and Argentina, such as the water lettuce weevil, indicates a long-term native tenure in South America. Fossil specimens dating back to the late Pleistocene (~12,000 BP) and early Holocene (~3,500 BP) period are reported from Florida, indicating a native presence in the southeastern United States. Recent genetic evidence also suggests that &quot;Pistia&quot; is not actually a monotypic genus, as had been long assumed. Instead, &quot;Pistia&quot; appears to be composed of at least three genetically distinct, but morphologically and ecologically similar, species at a global scale. 

===Temperate occurrences===
Though &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; is intolerant of cold temperatures, it has been recorded growing at least temporarily in temperate areas of North America and Europe. In the United States north of the Gulf of Mexico it has been found growing in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
and Wisconsin. One of these occurrences, in Idaho, survives in an area of a river fed by a hot spring. The rest are thought either to be completely eradicated by cold weather or possibly to survive by seed production.

==Fossil record==
&quot;Pistia&quot;-like plants appear in the fossil record during the Late Cretaceous epoch in rock strata from the western interior of North America. They were first described as †Pistia corrugata by Leo Lesquereux in 1876 based on specimens from the Almond Formation of Wyoming (late Campanian age). However, based on more complete specimens from the Campanian Dinosaur Park Formation of southern Alberta, Canada, and other areas, they were redescribed as a separate genus, †Cobbania, primarily due to differences in leaf morphology. Younger fossils attributed to &quot;Pistia&quot; &quot;stratiotes&quot; have described from Eocene strata in the southeastern United States, and 350 fossil seeds of †Pistia sibirica have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark. Fossils of this species have also been described from the Oligocene and Miocene of Western Siberia and from the Miocene of Germany.

A specimen of &quot;Pistia&quot; from the Florida peninsula dating from at least 3,550 years Before Present and a report of Holocene &quot;Pistia&quot; fossils from a lake in south central Florida are consistent with genetic evidence indicating that some varieties of &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; are native to the southeastern United States.

==Uses==
===Consumption===
While considered edible, &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; is not palatable as it is rich in calcium oxalate crystals that are bitter in taste. Nevertheless, there are records of the plant being utilized as famine food in India during the Great Famine of 1876–1878.

The Hausa people of Nigeria used the ash of the plant as a substitute for salt due to its high concentration of potassium chloride, a mineral salt. This salt substitute, also called &quot;zakankau&quot;, was of high importance, especially when imported salt was unavailable.

Caution is advised when consuming &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot;, as the plant is a hyperaccumulator, and can absorb and accumulate toxic heavy metals present in its environment. The presence of high concentrations of calcium oxalate crystals can induce various health concerns, such as inhibited mineral absorption and kidney stones.

In Singapore and Southern China, &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; is commonly grown or collected as animal feed for ducks and pigs. Water lettuce is also considered an alternative for poultry feed in Indonesia due to its high content of crude protein.

=== Medical treatment ===
There are various medical uses of &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; throughout regions in Asia and Africa. In Nigeria, the dried leaves are prepared into a powder form and are applied to wounds and sores for disinfection. A similar use is present in Indian traditional medicine, where the powdered leaf is applied to syphilitic eruptions and skin infections. In Nigeria and Gambia, the leaf is infused in water to create an eyewash to treat allergic conjunctivitis. The eyewash is known to have a cooling and analgesic effect. Therefore, the plant is commonly called &#x27;eye-pity&#x27; in Africa. In addition, the leaves of &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; can be burned into ash, and in Indian and Nigerian traditional medicine, the ash is used in treating ringworm infections of the scalp.

==== Medicinal properties ====

* Anti-inflammatory properties: Extractions of the leaves of &quot;P. stratiotes&quot; reduces mast infiltration and degranulation in allergic reactions and presents anti-inflammatory properties. The ethanolic extracts have also been positively correlated with a reduction in inflammatory disorders, such as arthritis and fevers.
*Antifungal properties: With the popular use of &quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot; as a traditional treatment for ringworms, researchers have tested &quot;P. stratiotes&quot; methanolic extracts on dermatophyte fungi. The results of the studies depicted significant fungicidal activity on &quot;T. rubrum&quot;, &quot;T. mentagrophytes&quot;, and &quot;E. floccosum&quot;.

=== Environmental remediation ===
The high sorption property of water lettuce makes it a great candidate for biodegradable oil sorbents in marine oil spills. Particularly, the leaves of &quot;Pistia&quot; &quot;stratiotes&quot; can efficiently absorb significant amounts of hydrocarbons due to its large surface area and hydrophobicity.

As a hyper-accumulator, &quot;Pistia&quot; &quot;stratiotes&quot; has been studied as a potential candidate for wastewater treatment plants. The roots and leaves of the plant have been found to absorb excess nutrients and heavy metals, such as zinc, chromium, and cadmium in contaminated waters.

&quot;Pistia&quot; &quot;stratiotes&quot; can be grown in water gardens to reduce harmful algal blooms and eutrophic conditions. The plant is able to control the growth of algae by restricting light penetration in the water column and competing for nutrients, with significant uptake of phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen.
