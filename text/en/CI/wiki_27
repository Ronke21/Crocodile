<text>Bicycle lighting is illumination attached to bicycles whose purpose above all is, along with reflectors, to improve the visibility of the bicycle and its rider to other road users under circumstances of poor ambient illumination. A secondary purpose is to illuminate reflective materials such as cat&#x27;s eyes and traffic signs. A third purpose may be to illuminate the roadway so that the rider can see the way ahead. Serving the latter purposes require much more luminous flux and thus more power.

Many jurisdictions require one or more bicycle lights to be fitted to bicycles ridden at night — generally a white light in the front and a red light at the back, like with other vehicles.

== History ==
=== Fire ===

The earliest bicycle lamps were oil-fueled and started to be manufactured in 1876 for the Ordinary (High-Bicycle) and solid-tired tricycles. From 1896, acetylene gas lighting for bicycles started to be introduced and later in 1899, acetylene gas lamps for the motor-car became popular. Their carbide lamps were powered by acetylene gas, produced by combining calcium carbide with water. The light given was very bright, often called artificial daylight but the lamps required regular maintenance.

=== Electricity ===
From as early as 1888, electric-powered bicycle lamps were manufactured but did not become a viable proposition until 1898. They comprised an incandescent bulb and either a lead-acid battery or a dynamo. Lead-acid batteries were replaced by dry cells and later by alkaline batteries. Dynamos improved in efficiency and reliability, recently being incorporated into the wheel hub, for example. Moulding techniques for plastics also improved, allowing lens optics to be improved and cost reduced. Incandescent bulbs were replaced first by halogen lamps and later by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

==== Halogen lights ====
Although these lights were originally designed for off-road use, where they were almost universal, rechargeable halogen lights became popular with commuter cyclists.

The lights used by most halogen rechargeable systems were cheap and bright, but fairly simple: they projected a cone of light (wide and narrow beam options were available) which is good for off-road use but not ideal for road use as it can dazzle oncoming road users. This is why halogen lights do not meet legal requirements in some jurisdictions.

Many systems used standard commercial prefocused optics, making a wide range of power and beam width combinations available. Most systems allowed simultaneous connection of different lamps - for example, a wide and a narrow beam for off-road riding, or a high- and a low-power beam for road riding.

==== HID lights ====

High-intensity discharge (HID) lights were a brighter/more efficient alternative to filament bulbs prior to the widespread adoption of LEDs. Like halogen systems, they were designed primarily for off-road use, having rotationally symmetrical beams which cast as much light up as down. HID lamps were susceptible to damage from repeated strikes, and in many cases did not relight immediately after shutting down. Likewise, should the battery level fall too low, the lamp would shut down rather than dimming. But the longer battery life than halogens tends to negate these problems, as many riders would simply switch the light on and leave it running throughout the ride.

====Xenon strobes====
Xenon strobes were an innovation in bicycle lighting; previously common in industrial applications. They were brighter than LEDs and sometimes used as rear lights.

== Lighting system ==

=== Electrical system ===
Batteries, either rechargeable or disposable, are often used to power electric bicycle lights. Where batteries are unwanted a magneto is used. In cycling circles the device is called a dynamo even though the device does not have a commutator. See section Dynamo systems for details.

==== Voltages ====
3 volt:
Often supplied by 2 AA or C/D cell batteries.

6 volt:
Sometimes 4 AA batteries or lead-acid batteries are used; also supplied from a bottle- or hub dynamo.

9 volt:
Sometimes supplied by a PP3 battery

12 volt:
Mostly supplied by sealed lead-acid batteries. The main advantage with this voltage is versatility of the electric system, such as the ability to charge a cell phone battery, though 5 volt USB is also used for that purpose too. It also allows electric air compressors to inflate tires. Some 12-volt dynamos are available too, though their watt rating is underpowered for medium to high watt applications.

=== Light sources ===
Virtually all bicycle lights on the market today, from the cheapest to the most expensive, are based on LEDs.

=== Legal requirements ===

Under the International Vienna Convention on Road Traffic (1968) of the United Nations, a bicycle is a vehicle. Article 44 of the Convention stipulates that: &quot;Cycles without an engine in international traffic shall: (c) Be equipped with a red reflecting device at the rear and with devices such that the cycle can show a white or selective-yellow light to the front and a red light to the rear.&quot; In some countries, for example France, it may be an offence even to sell a bicycle not fitted with legally compliant lighting system. However, not all countries impose this requirement on cyclists.

Many jurisdictions require bicycles to be fitted with reflectors at the point of sale. In the United States this is regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. CPSC compliant reflectors (also commonly fitted in other markets) have three retro-reflective panels positioned at 30° angles. The standard requires a forward-facing white reflector on the front of the bicycle, sideways-facing white reflectors on each wheel, a red reflector mounted on the rear, and yellow reflectors installed on the front and back of each pedal. Some interpret this as an endorsement of reflector-only night cycling.

Many jurisdictions require the use of a headlight and a rear light or reflector after dark. Most European countries and some US states require front and rear lights at night, while others allow reflectors only at the rear. Some jurisdictions impose requirements on light output and the size of lamp and reflector lenses; some require compliance with standards defined by third parties; some stipulate a minimum distance from which any lighting device should be visible. In some jurisdictions such as Germany and the Netherlands, flashing red tail lights are illegal, in others, they are allowed.

In the UK, the regulations governing bicycle lights are set out in the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 and their subsequent amendments, summarized in the Highway Code. The regulations require a white front light, a red rear light, a red rear reflector,
and amber/yellow pedal reflectors on the front and rear of both pedals.
Reflectors must conform to BS 6102/2 or an equivalent European standard. The situation for lights is more complicated:
* a light with a steady mode is considered approved only if it conforms to BS 6102/3 or an equivalent European standard;
* a light without a steady mode is considered approved only if it flashes at a constant rate of between 60 and 240 flashes per minute and has a luminous intensity of at least 4 candela;
The majority of LED lights available are not approved for UK use since they have steady modes that do not conform to BS 6102/3. It is, however, legal to fit additional lights providing that they are of the correct colour, they do not dazzle other road users and that if they flash, they do so at a constant rate of between 60 and 240 flashes per minute.

National cyclists&#x27; organisations such as LAB (US) or CTC (UK) are a source of lighting information.

=== Safety ===
The use of lights for night riding is generally recommended or required by authorities as a basic safety precaution, even in a well-lit urban context. show a correlation between collisions and failure to use lights even during daytime.

In countries where bicycles are used widely for commuting and short trips, such as the Netherlands and Scandinavia, bicycle head- and tail lighting regulation is strictly enforced by the authorities.
However, a study from 2013
shows that different lighting regulations seem to have little influence on bicycle accident rates, and points out a lack of studies into the safety benefits of bicycle lighting.

== Front lighting ==

White LEDs are available with output ranging from a few lumens to high-powered units producing about as much light as an automotive headlamp, suitable for high speed use on unlit trails.

LED systems often include an option to dim the LEDs, or to provide a flashing light.

Low-cost battery lights can be a good choice for occasional use, and usually meet legislative requirements. However, regular bicycle commuters would probably find it cost-effective to use rechargeable cells. Some headlamps use lithium-ion rechargeable battery packs, which may be recharged from a USB port.

=== Flashlights ===
Flashlights, although not specifically designed for bicycle use, are a viable alternative. They can be fastened to the bicycle handlebars with various mounting devices such as a lock-block. The round light pattern of a general purpose flashlight is inferior to the beam of a bicycle headlamp properly shaped to illuminate the roadway and not provide excess glare to oncoming traffic.

== Rear lighting ==
Most LED lights will work in either flashing or steady modes. Some LED lights have multiple banks of LEDs allowing both flashing and steady light at once. This can also be achieved by having one flashing light and one steady.

In many countries, LED flashers are the norm for rear lights. In others such as Germany and the Netherlands flashing lights are forbidden by law. In the UK flashing LEDs (front and rear) are legal from October 2005, provided that the lights conform to the requirements of the current Road Vehicles Lighting regulations. Many vendors claim EU compliance, however, this provides no consistent safety or legal value across the Union.

The most common power source for rear LEDs is a set of alkaline cells and rechargeable cells. In both cases the battery tends to fail quickly when it goes; it is widely considered a good practice to have two rear lights in case a battery fails en route.

Low power lights are mainly for being seen, or as an emergency backup, and are the dominant choice for rear lights. Rear marker LED lamps may be operated on disposable coin-sized cells.

Some high-end rear lights incorporate turn signal and brake light functions, switched via a handlebar control via radio frequencies.

== Power supplies ==

=== Batteries ===

The introduction of the Low self-discharge NiMH battery (LSD-NiMH) in 2005 made rechargeable AA and AAA sized batteries more viable for powering LED bicycle lights. Previously, the self-discharge effect of NiCAD and NiMH batteries caused the battery to run down over a period of weeks or a few months, even when not in use. This was particularly a problem for low powered LED lights, and for users who only used their bicycle lights occasionally. The LSD-NiMH battery greatly reduced the self-discharge effect, allowing the battery to keep its charge for a year or more.

For higher-powered lights, an external battery pack of 12V VRLA battery is often required. These battery packs usually strap to the top tube of the frame, or come in the shape that fits in a water bottle cage, or can be placed in a basket. A cable connects the battery pack to the light. Another advantage with battery power (especially with 12 volt) is the ability to power other components outside of lighting, as well as all from one battery (as long as they run safe on 12 volts) though wire spaghetti from splicing can be a setback depending on how complicated the electric system is.

Alternatively, Li-ion and LiPo batteries have been becoming more popular with bicyclists due to their higher capacity and lighter weight compared with conventional batteries. More specifically, the 18650 battery, which has been popular with electric car manufacturers (for the same reasons) and are commonly found in laptops and flashlights.

=== Dynamo systems ===
Dynamo systems require no batteries and may be permanently fitted to the bike.

Bicycle dynamos are actually magnetos and produce alternating current.

==== Types ====
There are three main types:

* &quot;Hub dynamos&quot; are built into the front or rear wheel hub. These are generally the most reliable and most efficient of the three types.
* &quot;Bottle dynamos&quot; (or &quot;sidewall dynamos&quot;) attach to the seatstay or fork and are rotated by a small wheel in contact with the tire sidewall. These are easier to retrofit than hub dynamos, but are prone to slipping, especially in wet conditions.
* &quot;Bottom-bracket dynamos&quot; are attached between the chainstays behind the bottom bracket and are powered by a roller against the center of the tire. These do not wear the tire sidewall and do not slip, but are exposed to dirt and spray from the road.

Other types of dynamos exist, but are less common. For example, there are dynamos that are attached to the fork and driven by the wheel&#x27;s spokes.

==== Output and optics ====
Dynamos are generally limited to about 3 W of output power, although the best 12 V hub dynamos can produce 6 W at speed A bottle dynamo is likely to slip if run at twice the nominal power, a hub dynamo does not have this problem.

At speed a dynamo can overpower the lamp, causing it to fail. Historically this was a nuisance, but modern lamps and dynamos often incorporate Zener diodes to prevent overvoltage, and dynamos can be designed to saturate beyond a certain voltage to protect the lamp.

Good dynamos can achieve efficiencies of up to 70% (i.e., under 5 W of the rider&#x27;s output is diverted to produce 3 W of electricity) and provide good light output at low speeds.

To produce light when the bike is stationary, some dynamo lights have a &quot;stand light&quot; facility, usually a single blue-white (front light) or red (rear light) LED powered by a capacitor, which runs for around five minutes.

==== Advantages of dynamo lighting ====
* Usage time not limited by battery life
* No recharging or change of batteries necessary
* More environmentally friendly and inexpensive to run than battery-powered lights
* Typically do not have to be removed when the bicycle is parked

==== Disadvantages ====
* Provide no lighting when the bicycle is moving very slowly or is stopped, unless the system is equipped with capacitors or back-up batteries
* Maximum power output obtainable is lower than with batteries
* Difficult to remove by the owner if this is necessary to thwart theft or vandalism, or to use them on more than one bicycle
* Retrofitting a bicycle is more difficult because mounting is more difficult (due to lamp and power source being separate)
* Cheap or poorly aligned dynamos produce noticeable drag
* Old dynamos and lamps did not limit their output voltage, leading to early failure of the incandescent light bulbs in the lamps. Modern lamps and dynamos contain voltage limiters to solve this problem.
* Not suitable for high-power applications outside of lighting, unless designed to recharge an on-board battery.
* Bottle dynamos may be noisy, can be difficult to adjust, can slip under wet conditions, and may wear the sidewall of the tire

=== Magnetic lights ===

Lights can be self-powered via electromagnetic induction, eliminating the need for batteries or dynamo systems. The advantages are similar to those of dynamo lighting. The most common design includes a magnet on the wheel spoke and lights with a coil in them, mounted on the frame or fork of the bike. More exotic designs also exist; some have frame-mounted magnets and wheel-mounted lights, or a magnet and an inductor in one casing, using eddy currents.

== Supplementary lighting and visibility ==
=== Headlamps ===

Headlamps are a useful adjunct to bicycle lights. They can be pointed without steering the bike, giving useful fill-in lighting especially on poor or very dark roads. They have the added safety benefit of positioning the light higher on the cyclist for increased visibility. They also allow the wearer to read road and directional signs placed on high signposts. However, due to the high position of the light the glare may dazzle oncoming traffic.

Some rechargeable systems offer a headlamp option powered from the main battery pack.

=== Reflective and high-visibility materials ===
Retro-reflective materials, in the form of fixed reflectors, reflective tape, and reflective clothing, are useful in making a cyclist visible to other road users. Reflective materials can be applied to bike, rider, or luggage; also, tires are available with reflective sidewalls. Reflectives are visible only when in the beam of a headlight, and even then only within a narrow locus. Importantly, they &quot;do nothing to light up the road&quot;. Reflectors are &quot;not&quot; a substitute for lights, but are an important supplement to portable lighting.

==== On the bike ====
Reflectors and reflective tape provide additional visibility (especially when applied to moving parts of the bicycle) and are mandatory in many jurisdictions. Pedal reflectors in particular are very visible to following traffic as they move up and down; unfortunately they are not compatible with most clipless pedal systems, although adaptors are available for some, mainly older SPD models, and a few single-sided designs are available with built-in reflectors. In the UK, where front and rear pedal reflectors are compulsory after dark, most cyclists with clipless pedals are therefore riding illegally. The law is rarely if ever enforced, but could potentially be used in court to reduce financial compensation if the cyclist were to be hit by another vehicle. The CTC have suggested that the requirement should be waived if the cyclist fits an additional rear reflector or lighting, but this was not changed in the last revision of the UK vehicle lighting laws (which permitted flashing LEDs). Riders of recumbent bicycles have pointed out that the pedal reflector requirement is nonsensical for them, since the reflectors point straight up and down in use, and are invisible from other vehicles. As of 2008, California law allows white or yellow shoe reflectors (front and back), or reflective ankle bands, in lieu of pedal reflectors.

==== Clothing ====

On dark roads, retroreflective materials such as 3M&#x27;s Scotchlite will show up boldly in car headlights.

The colour of lighting should be checked in the rider&#x27;s surroundings. A single solid colour can disappear under artificial light, particularly yellow sodium vapour lighting, and colour blindness is common; red/green colourblindness can make yellow fluorescent vanish against a green background (hedges or grass), although people with red/green colourblindness dispute this. Vests with both yellow and orange fluorescent areas plus wide strips of reflective may be the best solution.

In recent times electroluminescent clothing has become available to add to the existing array of LED-illuminated armbands and helmet blinkies.

=== Wheel-mounted lights ===

Wheel-mounted lights are used to improve the visibility of a bike from the side. Due to persistence of vision, individual lights mounted on the moving bike’s wheel spokes are perceived as glowing arcs or circles. There are lights controlled with MCU that are capable of rendering colorful patterns or animations. The glowing rims or wheels can isolate the bike from the visual noise of the city lights and help drivers see and immediately recognize a cyclist. Such lights are mainly battery-powered, but battery-free designs also exist.

== Measures of light output ==

=== Electric power consumption in watts ===

The watt (W) is the unit of power, and is usually quoted for the electrical power input, not the light power output. Electrical power is the product of voltage and current (watts = volts × amperes). Input power is only useful when comparing lights of similar technologies.

=== Luminous intensity in a given direction in candelas ===

The candela (cd) is the SI unit of luminous intensity, that is power per unit solid angle in a given direction, weighted according to the sensitivity of the human eye to various colours of light. A typical candle produces light with about 1 candela of luminous intensity in all directions. A lamp can produce higher luminous intensity either by producing more light, or by focusing it tighter. The luminous intensity of a light depends on many factors, including the colour of the light and the eye&#x27;s sensitivity to that colour, the optics involved, reflector and lens. Despite its complexity, it is a more useful measure than watts, because it defines how much usable light is shed in a given place: a dynamo headlight designed for road use and focused for seeing the road makes more efficient use of the power of the lamp than lights using rotationally symmetrical optics.

=== Total luminous flux in lumens ===

The lumen (lm) is the SI unit for luminous flux, the total amount of light emitted by a source, weighted according to the sensitivity of the human eye to various colours of light. Lumens per watt is a common measure of the efficacy of a light source. The luminous flux is of less value for bicycle lighting due to the importance of directionality. Luminous intensity is much more useful, but lumens per watt is a handy way to compare the output of otherwise similar lights.

=== Illuminance at a given distance in lux ===

The lux (lx) is this SI unit for illuminance, that is the amount of light that illuminates a surface (the road, in the case of a bike light) per unit area at a given point, weighted according to the sensitivity of the human eye to various colours of light. Some manufacturers indicate the illuminance their front lights provide to the road at a point located a standard distance right in front of the bicycle.

<text>The &#x27; (French, ) or &#x27; (Dutch, ) is an urban public park in Brussels, Belgium. It lies in the south of the Brussels-Capital Region, in the City of Brussels, and covers an area of , forming a natural offshoot of the Sonian Forest, which penetrates deep into the city in the south-east of Brussels. It is linked to the rest of the municipality by the Avenue Louise/Louizalaan, which was built in 1861, at the same time the park was laid out.

The park consists of two large, slightly oval parts. The northern part is the most wooded and is home to some 19th-century buildings. The southern part comprises a large artificial lake with an island in its centre, called Robinson Island, home to the &quot;Chalet Robinson&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
As an offshoot of the Sonian Forest during the Ancien Régime, the wooded area where the Bois de la Cambre is located today belonged to La Cambre Abbey, located just north of it, and was called the or , an Old Dutch term possibly meaning &quot;seigneurial wood&quot;. In 1840, it was given its current name after the abbey.

On 17 June 1815, on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, English soldiers played a cricket match on a ground located in the area currently covered by the park. Ever since, this area has been called (&quot;The Englishmen&#x27;s Lawn&quot;), although few are aware of the name. In 1965, the then British Ambassador in Belgium planted an oak tree and unveiled a bronze plaque to commemorate the 150th anniversary of this sporting and historical event.

===19th-century development===
From 1846, the Brussels authorities wished to provide the city with a large wooded park and proposed a development plan for La Cambre by converting an area of of the Sonian Forest. The condition was that two-thirds of the trees would be preserved and a zone around the park would remain undeveloped. The decision was prompted by the popularity of the place among well-to-do walkers, who were increasingly less fond of the industrialising / in northern Brussels.

The Bois de la Cambre was laid out starting in 1861 by , a German architect. His project, relating to English landscaping, was characterised by an irregularity in the plantations and roads, by alternating massifs and clearances allowing beautiful visual escapes, and by the creation of picturesque scenes. The park, property of the Belgian State since 1843, was granted through a royal decree issued on 21 April 1864 to the City of Brussels, which is responsible for its development and maintenance. In 1863, the two neoclassical former toll pavilions of the Namur Gate by the architect Auguste Payen from 1836 were moved to the entrance of the Bois de la Cambre. In 1866, the park, largely landscaped, was open to the public and aroused considerable enthusiasm.

The place quickly became a popular recreational area for the people of Brussels, comparable to the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. In addition to its many promenades, it hosted a dairy, a velodrome, a theatre, an artificial boating lake, as well as a racecourse. Queen Marie-Henriette, wife of King Leopold II, often went riding in the park. The horsemen&#x27;s battle bronze sculptural group at the entrance is the work of the Anglo-Belgian sculptor Jacques de Lalaing.

===20th and 21st centuries===
With the rise of motorised traffic in the early 20th century, the Bois de la Cambre&#x27;s avenues were increasingly turned into thoroughfares fragmenting the park. The park was protected as a landscape in 1976 and was designated a special protection zone within the framework of Natura 2000 in 2004. Since 1985, it has also hosted a cycling event every spring for scout groups, the &quot;24 heures vélo du bois de la Cambre&quot;.

Nowadays, the question of the park&#x27;s closure to motorised traffic is regularly raised. The main road around the lake has been closed to traffic on Saturdays and Sundays since the 1990s. In April 2012, a new mobility plan, drawn up at the request of the City of Brussels, proposed a partial closure of the park to motorists, and the requalification of the public space for cyclists and pedestrians. In March 2020, traffic was temporarily banned from the park due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium. At the end of May, cars were allowed again in its northern part. As of 14 December 2020, a new traffic plan has been in effect with access for cars in the northern and southern parts on weekdays, and only in the northern part on Saturdays and during school holidays. The park is car-free on Sundays.

==The &quot;Chalet Robinson&quot;==
In 1877, the &quot;Chalet Robinson&quot;, a tea-room café designed in picturesque Swiss chalet style, was built on the lake&#x27;s island, known as Robinson Island (, ). The chalet was twice destroyed by fire; the first time in 1896, and the second time in 1991. The decision was made in 2006 to rebuild it and it reopened to the public in September 2009. The surface of the wooden building is approximately , with a restaurant on the ground floor and a ballroom on the first floor. An electrical ferry boat links the island to the shores of the lake.

<text>Roger Tonge (30 January 1946 – 26 February 1981) was a British actor.

==Biography==
Tonge was born Anthony Roger Tonge in Birmingham where he attended Lordswood Technical Grammar School. He was working as an £8-a-week post office clerk and performing in amateur dramatics in the evenings when he landed the role of Sandy Richardson, the son of motel owner Meg (Noele Gordon) in the ATV soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;, which he would portray for 17 years. Tonge won the role by accident. Having dropped in at ATV during his lunch break to enquire about acting parts, a cleaner directed him to a meeting where production manager Margaret French handed him a script and invited him to return for an audition. Reg Watson, the producer, had already interviewed several actors for the part but was unsatisfied; after Tonge&#x27;s audition, the producer offered him the role.

&quot;Crossroads&quot; was routinely assailed by TV critics for what they saw as its low quality, and Tonge was one of the members of the cast who was regularly criticised. He was reported as having laughed off the jibes of journalists, by saying: &quot;I&#x27;m allergic to criticism&quot;.

Tonge&#x27;s struggle with Hodgkin&#x27;s Disease impacted his role in the programme. During his tenure in the series, his ill health left him increasingly immobile. To accommodate his disability and not lose an original character, a story was developed in which Sandy became paralysed and a wheelchair user through an accident. Prior to the &#x27;accident&#x27; storyline, Tonge had for many months only been seen in seated scenes, standing rigid or lying in bed. Following the accident, the character of Sandy was predominantly a wheelchair user, though he was able to stand and move upright with the aid of crutches. Tonge thus became the first disabled actor in a soap; however, it was something he always played down and his illness was never talked about. In a 1981 interview with Angela Rippon, Tonge claimed that viewers were often astonished to encounter him off-screen and discover he did not use a wheelchair or crutches, despite him having been a wheelchair user for many years. The claim was not challenged on air.

Although he was a regular in the soap opera, Tonge found time to appear on other television programmes, including &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Nearest and Dearest&quot; and &quot;Detective&quot;. He was also in the film &quot;Catch Me Going Back&quot;.

== Death ==

In 1981, after a long fight with Hodgkin lymphoma, Tonge died aged 35. He had caught chicken pox and died of heart failure, his system unable to cope with the infection.

His absence and death were mentioned in an episode of Crossroads between his character&#x27;s mother Meg and sister Jill and again in the episode featuring Meg leaving for a new life on the QE2.

<doc id="1052670" wikidata="Q3758486" url="?curid=1052670" title="Gary Fencik">
<text>John Gary Fencik (born June 11, 1954) is an American former professional football safety who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons with the Chicago Bears. He played college football for the Yale Bulldogs and was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the tenth round of the 1976 NFL draft. He was a once first-team All-Pro and twice Pro Bowl selection. Fencik is the Bears all-time leader in interceptions and total tackles. He was also part of the 1985 Bears team that won the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl title in the Super Bowl XX.

==Playing career==
He played college football at Yale University, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1976. In 1986, he received an MBA from Northwestern University. John Madden once said in a broadcast that &quot;Gary Fencik played football at Yale; that is like saying clean dirt&quot;. At Yale, Fencik played wide receiver, catching 86 passes for 1,435 yards and 7 touchdowns from 1973 to 1975. In his senior season, Fencik caught 42 passes and led the Ivy League with 729 receiving yards.

Considered too slow to be an NFL receiver, the Miami Dolphins drafted Fencik in the tenth round of the 1976 NFL draft with the 281st overall selection, intending to convert him to defensive back. After rupturing his left lung in a preseason game against the New Orleans Saints, he was released in September and headed home to Chicago, planning to start a banking career until he received a job offer from the Chicago Bears.

In Chicago, he was the team&#x27;s defensive captain through the 1980s including the 1985 Super Bowl championship season. He made two Pro Bowl appearances (1980, 1981). He was also awarded a gold record and a platinum video award for the 1985 &quot;Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;. Fencik and Doug Plank were dubbed &quot;The Hit Men&quot;, a fact referenced by Fencik in &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;.

In September 1986 he was featured on the cover of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine. His picture also appeared on the reverse side of a &quot;Playboy&quot; centerfold, showing him and the December 1982 Playmate Charlotte Kemp, shopping at the Old Town Art Fair. The story promoted Fencik as &quot;the NFL&#x27;s smartest player.&quot;

Fencik finished his career with 38 interceptions, which he returned for 488 yards and a touchdown. He also recorded 4 sacks and recovered 13 fumbles, returning them for 65 yards.

During his playing career, he became the part-owner of the Hunt Club, a popular bar on Chicago&#x27;s North Side.

==Retirement==
Following his football career, Fencik has worked in the finance industry. Fencik worked with Wells Fargo and UBS before joining Adams Street Partners in 1995. He has also worked as a sports commentator, mainly on WGN radio where he was a color commentator on Bears radio broadcasts from 1990 to 1993. During the 1988 NFL season he paired with James Brown as an NFL television commentator on CBS.

During Fencik&#x27;s final NFL season, he was widely speculated as a potential candidate in the then-upcoming 1987 Chicago mayoral election. Donald L. Totten (the chairman of the Cook County Republican Party) attempted to persuade Fencik to run as a Republican. When asked in September 1986 to describe his political ideology, Fencik remarked, &quot;maybe an independent Republican.&quot; In a 2022 radio interview, Fencik said while he believes he would be able to impact positive change if he were to become mayor of Chicago, he currently held no intention of seeking that office.

In October 2012, the Illinois Lottery Board unanimously voted to name Fencik as its chairman.

==Personal life==
Fencik and his wife Sandy have two children, Garrison and Evan. He is of Polish descent.

<doc id="1052674" wikidata="Q14710908" url="?curid=1052674" title="KZTV">
<text>KZTV (channel 10) is a television station in Corpus Christi, Texas, United States, affiliated with CBS. It is owned by SagamoreHill Broadcasting, which maintains a shared services agreement (SSA) with the E. W. Scripps Company, owner of NBC affiliate KRIS-TV (channel 6) and low-power dual Telemundo affiliate/independent station K22JA-D (channel 47), for the provision of certain services. The three stations share studios on Artesian Street in downtown Corpus Christi; KZTV&#x27;s transmitter is located between Petronila and Robstown.

After one of the longest hearing processes for a TV station to that time, channel 10 was founded as KSIX-TV in September 1956 and changed its call sign to KZTV at the end of 1957. For its first 46 years of operation, it was owned by Corpus Christi businessman Vann Kennedy alongside KSIX radio. The station ran as a comparatively bare-bones effort: for 30 years, the newsroom and studio were in separate buildings, and Kennedy consistently underinvested in technology and appearance. It operated as a &quot;teaching affiliate&quot;, with many reporters in their first or second job out of college. The station began broadcasting from its present studios on Artesian Street in 1986, though by that time, it was already a distant third in local news coverage.

Kennedy put KSIX, KZTV, and KVTV in Laredo up for sale in 2001, at the age of 95. The stations were purchased by Eagle Creek Broadcasting, a Michigan-based firm related to the Northwest Broadcasting group. Eagle Creek led a top-to-bottom overhaul of the news department, including new equipment, a news set, and personnel. In 2008, Eagle Creek reached a deal to sell the KZTV physical plant to Cordillera Communications, owner of KRIS-TV, while transferring the license to SagamoreHill. The deal was delayed by objections, but Cordillera began operating KZTV under contract for Eagle Creek in 2009; SagamoreHill became the licensee the next year. Scripps acquired Cordillera in 2018 and continues to provide services to KZTV.

==History==
===A long hearing===
The end of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s multi-year freeze on television station awards set off interest among multiple applicants in bringing stations to Corpus Christi. The FCC allocated two channels in the very high frequency (VHF) band, 6 and 10, and two in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band, educational 16 and 22. Between April 15, when the commission lifted the freeze, and July 1, when it started taking grants, applicants began to prepare bids. On July 1, the commission received a channel 10 filing from radio station KEYS. Later that month, Superior Television filed for the channel; it was owned by Jack Wrather and Helen Alvarez and was related to KOTV in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and KFMB-TV in San Diego. By the time the commission slated comparative hearings in June 1953, there were four applicants. KEYS and Superior were joined by the Corpus Christi Television Company, formed by three Texas oilmen, and K-SIX Television, Inc., a subsidiary of local radio station KSIX. KSIX had been founded in 1946 by Vann Kennedy, a longtime Texas journalist. From 1931 to 1942, Kennedy founded and ran the International News Service bureau in Austin, where he hired a young Walter Cronkite as a reporter; Cronkite worked for Kennedy for a year.

Corpus Christi Television Company dropped out within a month, leaving three applicants to contest the channel. Oral hearings were held by the commission between November 1953 and January 1954. FCC hearing examiner H. Gifford Irion issued his initial decision on January 21, 1955. He recommended K-SIX Television over the KEYS and Superior proposals; both losing parties announced their intention to appeal the examiner&#x27;s findings, which lauded KSIX radio&#x27;s record of community service and its proposed integration of ownership and management. The FCC&#x27;s Broadcast Bureau also objected to the initial decision; it criticized the examiner&#x27;s opinion of KSIX radio&#x27;s local programming and said Superior should not only have been not selected but adversely found against based on statements made by Alvarez. The case, one of the longest in FCC history at the time, accumulated nearly 5,000 pages of testimony by September 1955, when the FCC heard final argument on the various appeals.

During this time, one Corpus Christi station got on the air by opting not for one of the two VHF channels and filing for UHF channel 22: KVDO-TV. However, across the country, UHF stations were having trouble competing in the same markets as VHF outlets. KVDO lobbied the FCC in November 1955 not to award either of the two VHF channels in Corpus Christi until it decided whether to continue mixing VHF and UHF locally or to make local television exist entirely on one band or the other. At the time, radio station KRIS was the only applicant for channel 6 but had yet to receive its permit. On December 7, the commission denied this request and approved KRIS-TV to begin broadcasting on channel 6.

===Vann Kennedy ownership===
On July 13, 1956, the FCC granted channel 10 to K-SIX Television; Kennedy opted to hold off on large construction in case any further appeals were filed. With the grant in hand, Kennedy recognized that a challenge from KVDO-TV was likely forthcoming; the UHF station had filed for relief against the new KSIX-TV, as it had done unsuccessfully against KRIS-TV. The FCC of the day generally did not act favorably on petitions to halt the progress of stations that were already on the air. As a result, beginning in early September, Kennedy resolved to build KSIX-TV as soon as possible. Engineers came from all over Texas and beyond, while tower work took place around the clock. On September 25, KVDO-TV filed a new petition with the commission challenging the KSIX-TV grant. Even though a part was missing from the station&#x27;s tower, KSIX-TV went on the air on September 30, 1956. It took the CBS affiliation from KVDO-TV, which became an independent station as a result; KVDO-TV left the air a year later and did not reappear until 1964, when its backers were successful in a bid to move it to VHF channel 3 as KIII. The very next day, its attorneys informed the FCC that the challenge was moot because the station was on the air.

The station&#x27;s call letters changed to the current KZTV on December 31, 1957, with the new designation debuting on air the next day. Though KZTV was touted as a shorter designation than KSIX-TV at the time, the designation also eliminated confusion with KRIS-TV on channel 6.

KZTV&#x27;s first news director was a woman, Judy Wright; she had been running KSIX&#x27;s radio news operation since 1950 and expanded her responsibilities to include television when channel 10 began. Initially, the news department showed strength; channel 10 had the highest-rated evening newscast in the market for 18 years, and in 1965, the Texas Association of Broadcasters recognized KZTV as having the best large-market newscast in the state.

The Kennedy media group expanded twice in the 1970s. KSIX-FM 93.9 began broadcasting on January 16, 1970; in 1985, the FM station, renamed KEXX-FM, was sold to the American Wireless Company, a Dallas-based investor consortium, and separated from KSIX radio and KZTV. A second television station joined the group in 1973, when KVTV was built in Laredo. The station originally rebroadcast most of KZTV&#x27;s newscasts; the news was read from Laredo, and viewers joined KZTV for weather and sports. In the early 1980s, KVTV introduced full news programs originating in Laredo.

For decades, the station operated from two sites. The offices and newsgathering operation were downtown, first in the Showroom Building and then in the Wilson Building. The studio was at the transmitter site in Robstown, an arrangement that had been described as &quot;temporary&quot; when the station launched but persisted for decades; employees had to drive from Corpus Christi to Robstown to present the newscasts. Kennedy&#x27;s conservative style of news presentation eschewed visuals; consequently, KZTV&#x27;s newscasts began to sink in the ratings as KIII and KRIS offered more engaging newscasts while KZTV continued with its approach of using &quot;less showmanship&quot;. In a 1981 article on changes to the newscasts at KIII and KRIS, Kennedy told the &quot;Corpus Christi Caller-Times&quot;, &quot;We will continue to use our news veterans and keep our efforts on the content of the news rather than the cosmetics.&quot;

In 1986, a new studio and office complex was built in downtown Corpus Christi on Artesian Street. The facility provided two studios for news and commercial production as well as space for KSIX radio and equipment to improve the station&#x27;s picture quality. Even then, little changed at KZTV. The station was the first in town with a satellite truck until Kennedy sold it, finding it was used too infrequently to justify its cost. The news programs lacked substantial local stories and relied on reports from CBS affiliates in other Texas cities. The station&#x27;s logo remained untouched from the early 1980s to 2002; promotions were recycled because of a lack of staff to create new ones. Into the 1990s, the weather presenter read the current condition from dials, shown on the air, instead of a computer readout. Because the station paid less, it typically attracted entry-level employees, such as recent college graduates; it was a &quot;teaching affiliate&quot; for young journalists. The evening ratings reflected these resources: while KIII dominated and later battled KRIS for first, KZTV had one-fourth to one-fifth the viewership. However, the station continued to lead the ratings at noon, when veteran anchor Walter Furley read the news. Former station employees went as far as to tell the &quot;Caller-Times&quot; that they believed Kennedy would drop the news operation if CBS would let him.

In 1993, Kennedy and his counterparts at KIII and KRIS led a months-long dispute with cable systems in the market over retransmission consent payments for their signals, known locally as the &quot;cable wars&quot;. The cable providers were not willing to pay a per-subscriber fee for the stations&#x27; programming: Kennedy told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;To borrow from Ross Perot, that great sucking sound you hear is money being sucked out of this area and sent to Denver&quot;, in reference to the headquarters of Tele-Communications Inc., and characterized the dispute as an intellectual property matter. The dispute lasted six weeks and was the longest of its type after the introduction of retransmission consent; in addition, the Department of Justice brought an antitrust lawsuit against the affiliates, which was settled.

===Eagle Creek ownership and rebuild===
In February 2001, Vann Kennedy—at the age of 95—put his media properties up for sale, citing his advancing age and his wife Mary&#x27;s recent heart attacks. Mary Kennedy died in December 2001. In January 2002, Michigan-based Eagle Creek Broadcasting purchased KZTV, KSIX, and KVTV for $11.5 million. The three-investor consortium included Jim Withers, a partner in local radio station owner Pacific Broadcasting, and Brian Brady, who was president of Northwest Broadcasting. Eagle Creek immediately sold KSIX to Pacific Broadcasting; it had not planned to keep the radio station.

Eagle Creek conducted a top-to-bottom overhaul of KZTV&#x27;s news department. Furley delivered his final newscast on May 31, 2002, ending a 45-year career with the station. The relaunched &quot;CBS 10 News&quot; debuted on October 21, 2002, after a $2 million investment in new equipment and a new news set which featured two levels and a revolving desk. It was the station&#x27;s first set overhaul since moving into the Artesian Street facility. Ratings did not rise: in the February 2003 Nielsen sweeps, KZTV attracted 5% of the 10 p.m. news audience compared to the market leaders, KRIS and KIII, which had 35 and 31 percent. In 2005, the station changed its brand again to &quot;Action 10 News&quot;, though it remained a distant third.

===Operation by KRIS-TV===
On July 28, 2008, Eagle Creek announced that it had sold most of KZTV&#x27;s assets and physical plant to Cordillera Communications. To comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, the license would instead be sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting; the two transactions totaled $20 million. McKinnon Broadcasting, owner of KIII, objected to the sale. This objection held up the deal until August 24, 2009, when Eagle Creek announced a shared services agreement (SSA) with KRIS-TV; Cordillera acquired all station assets with Eagle Creek owning KZTV&#x27;s broadcast license. Several KZTV employees were laid off.

SagamoreHill finally assumed ownership of the KZTV license on May 19, 2010. In September, KRIS-TV moved its newsgathering operations from its prior studios on Staples Street into KZTV&#x27;s building on Artesian, though business functions had been migrating to the KZTV facility since the prior January.

On October 29, 2018, Cordillera announced the sale of its entire station group, including KZTV&#x27;s SSA partner KRIS-TV, to the E. W. Scripps Company; the SSA involving KZTV was included in the deal. The sale was completed on May 1, 2019. As of September 2023, the station aired hours a week of local newscasts.

Beginning in October 2023, the dedicated newscasts for KZTV were replaced by simulcasts or replays of KRIS&#x27;s newscasts.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KZTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 18 to VHF channel 10 for post-transition operations.

<doc id="1052689" wikidata="Q3305650" url="?curid=1052689" title="GHQ India">
<text>General Headquarters, India was the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, who commanded the British military forces in India, including the British Indian Army, after the Kitchener Reforms of 1903. It succeeded Headquarters, India which was the term in use initially after the three Presidency armies had been amalgamated into one force. The Commander-in-Chief answered to the civilian Viceroy of India.

Confusingly, in the official &quot;Volume II: India&#x27;s Most Dangerous Hour&quot;, Major-General Stanley Kirby &quot;et al.&quot;, 1958, the term &quot;India Command&quot; was repeatedly used. &quot;India Command&quot; was not defined, but Stanley Kirby &quot;et al.&quot; appeared to be referring to the British Indian Army in India; the British Army in India; and GHQ India, the three together, as a whole. A more correct term for these three entities together would have been the Army in India.

==Early history==
GHQ India succeeded Headquarters, India which was the term in use initially after the three Presidency armies had been amalgamated into one force in 1895. &quot;The C-in-C India’s HQ was known as the General Headquarters (GHQ India) and acted as the superior HQ for all services to fulfil their requirements.&quot;

The Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s chief of staff was the Chief of the General Staff. It was based in Calcutta and Simla (the winter capital of the Raj) until the seat of power moved to New Delhi in 1911. In addition to India, as the [British] Indian Army garrisoned the waystation Aden Settlement (later Aden Colony) the Commander-in-Chief was also responsible for troops in Aden. Later Indian troops were also sent to Iraq and Persia). 

The 1906 Birthday Honours and 1922 Birthday Honours list officers on the staff of Headquarters, India; by the 1942 New Year Honours the listing had become General Headquarters, India (Colonel, Acting Major-General Rob Lockhart).

For significant periods before the creation of South East Asia Command (SEAC) in 1943, the C-in-C India was also responsible for Ceylon and Burma. The Commander-in-Chief, India, had some 2,000 officers and 2.5 million troops under his command in 1945. GHQ India was redesignated &quot;Army HQ&quot; in 1947 when India was partitioned.

==Second World War==
Following a review by the British Chiefs of Staff in late 1939, operational control of troops in Iraq passed in early 1940 to Middle East Command although the provision of troops and their maintenance remained for the most part GHQ India&#x27;s responsibility. In March 1941, in the period before the Anglo-Iraqi War, the C-in-C Middle East General Archibald Wavell, who was preoccupied with existing problems in his theatre, gained approval for Iraq to come under India&#x27;s operational control again but once hostilities commenced in May Wavell was obliged by London reluctantly to reassume responsibility. In June 1941, after cessation of hostilities, control reverted once more to GHQ India. India finally relinquished responsibility for Persia and Iraq in August 1942 when a separate Persia and Iraq Command was created.

After the dissolution of ABDACOM in February 1942 the C-in-C India also became responsible for Ceylon. During this period, some Chinese and American units also came under C-in-C India. These responsibilities remained unchanged until the creation of South East Asia Command (SEAC) in August 1943. With the creation of SEAC there were three geographic theatres and a further operational command. The China Theatre was under the command of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. SEAC was an Anglo-American command under a Supreme Allied Commander, Lord Mountbatten, who was responsible for operations in Burma, Ceylon, Malaya and Sumatra. General Auchinleck as Commander-in-Chief, India, was responsible for the development of India as a base, for internal security in India, and the defence of India&#x27;s North West Frontier. His responsibility included the training, equipping, maintenance and movement of operational forces assigned to SEAC. The American operational theater, China Burma India (CBI), operated in all three geographic areas. It was not subordinate to SEAC.

On 24 November 1944, G.H.Q.(I) passed on to the Headquarters Allied Land Forces South East Asia &quot;..proposals made by the Burma Government-in-exile for the evaluation of the men released in 1942, either returnees or deserters.&quot; &quot;The Burma Government proposed to raise administrative units to screen personnel who had remained in Burma, and operational units for internal security duties. ..Within General Headquarters, India, the department responsible for the administration of Burma Army units in India and Burma, known as Burma Section, also asked for the immediate raising of a second administrative unit.&quot; A.G. (BURSEC) was an integral part of GHQ India until it was established with Headquarters Twelfth Army.

Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck served as the last C-in-C, India from 1943. He was reappointed on 15 August 1947, and became Supreme Commander of India and Pakistan. He oversaw the division of the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force between the two new countries. In the process, GHQ Pakistan was established to serve the newly independent Pakistan, at Rawalpindi. Auchinleck served in this capacity until November 1948, when the role of Supreme Commander was abolished.

<doc id="1052696" wikidata="Q4860232" url="?curid=1052696" title="Bardufoss Air Station">
<text>Bardufoss Air Station () is a military air station located at Bardufoss in Målselv Municipality in Troms county in Northern Norway. It is the location of the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) 139 Air Wing and two helicopter squadrons; the 337 Squadron operating Lynx MK 86 for the Norwegian Coast Guard and the 339 Squadron equipped with Bell 412SPs. It is also the base for the RNoAF Flight Training School. In addition, helicopter Squadron no. 334 is currently under establishment as it will be operating NH90 NFH helicopters. The delivery of the NH90 helicopters just started. 334 Squadron will only have its command post and maintenance facilities at Bardufoss, as the helicopters will be stationed on the new Fridtjof Nansen class frigates when they arrive. 

The air station is co-located on the same site as the commercial Bardufoss Airport. The airbase is also used by the civilian community: Norwegian Aviation College (NAC) is located at the airport, and there is also a flying club (Bardufoss Flyklubb) and a parachute jumping club. Norwegian Air Shuttle currently operates three daily flights with Boeing 737 aircraft from Bardufoss Airport to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.

==History==
The first plane to land at the air station was a de Havilland Tiger Moth on 26 March 1938, making it the country&#x27;s oldest air station still operational. During World War II, RAF Gloster Gladiators (No. 263 Squadron RAF) and Hawker Hurricanes (No. 46 Squadron RAF) operating from Bardufoss played a vital part in keeping the Luftwaffe at bay during the fighting on the Narvik front in the April–June 1940 Norwegian Campaign. After the Allied withdrawal from Norway, the airbase was taken over by the Germans and mostly used as a base for fighters, bombers and reconnaissance planes operating against the Murmansk convoys. Fighters from Bardufoss also had the task of providing aerial support for naval operations in the area. 

When British Avro Lancasters began to bomb the battleship Tirpitz on 12 November 1944 in Operation Catechism at Håkøya near Tromsø, calls to Bardufoss failed to save the ship. The fighters failed to scramble in time and Tirpitz was sunk in ten minutes by two Tallboy bombs. Luftwaffe ace Heinrich Ehrler was originally stripped of command and sentenced to three years in prison because of this. He later died in combat when he rammed an American B-17 Flying Fortress over Germany.

The 339 Squadron was moved to Bardufoss in 1964 while the 337 Squadron arrived in 1983.

The Royal Norwegian Air Force Flight Training School was moved to Bardufoss from Trondheim Airport, Værnes in 2003.

2024: The Air Force uses the Underground hangar at the air station, after 40 years, to receive F-35 fighter jets.

==Squadrons==
Two squadrons of helicopters are stationed on this airfield: 337 operating Lynx MK 86 (since 1983) and 339 with Bell 412SP (since 1964). 

The 337 Squadron operates six Lynx MK 86 helicopters, which were delivered in 1983. Their purpose is to operate onboard Coast Guard ships. They will be replaced with eight new NH-90&#x27;s. 

The 339 Squadron operates twelve Bell 412SP, primarily used as support for the Royal Norwegian Army. The Bells were delivered in between 1987 and 1990. Previous to their delivery, the squadron operated UH-1&#x27;s bought used from the USA: some of those machines were received with minor battle damages and bullet holes, having seen action in the Vietnam War. The Royal Norwegian Air Force&#x27;s six remaining Bells (making a total of 18) are stationed at the 720 Squadron at Rygge Air Station. 

In addition, the RNoAF Flight Training School is located here. The school operates the Saab Safari.

UK Royal Naval Commando and Royal Marine units and the Dutch korps mariniers have used Bardufoss as a training base for many years. It is also used as a base for cold weather training for Royal Air Force, British Army and Royal Navy helicopter crews. During the Cold War, training was especially concentrated during the winter with repair parties during the Norwegian summer. These operations were given the title of &quot;Clockwork&quot;.

<doc id="1052697" wikidata="Q5431839" url="?curid=1052697" title="Falealupo">
<text>Falealupo is a village in Samoa situated at the west end of Savai&#x27;i island from the International Date Line used until 29 December 2011. The village has two main settlements, Falealupo-Uta, situated inland by the main island highway and Falealupo-Tai, situated by the sea. The road to the coastal settlement is about 9 km, most of it unsealed, from the main highway. The village&#x27;s population is 545.

Due to its location in the west of the country, and because Samoa was just to the east of the International Date Line, Falealupo has been described as &quot;the last village in the world to see the sunset of each day&quot;. This has now changed, as the Samoan government has moved the International Date Line east of the country in 2011.

Families have moved inland for the convenience of living by the main road near public transport, as well as the extensive damage to the coastal village from cyclones in the early 1990s, which left behind old church ruins along the coast. There are rock pools, caves, and sandy beaches in the area. Falealupo-Uta has small shops and facilities for Western Union money transfer while there are beach fale accommodation and a shop at Falealupo-tai.

The settlement is part of Falealupo Electoral Constituency (&quot;Faipule District&quot;) which forms part of the larger political district of Vaisigano.

Roman Catholic Cardinal Pio Taofinu&#x27;u (1923–2006), the first Polynesian bishop and cardinal, was born in Falealupo and attended the village school.

==Myths and Legends==
Falealupo is mentioned in different myths and legends in Samoan mythology.

In the sea at the farthest point of the peninsula, the Fafā-o-Sauali’i, an outcropping of volcanic rocks, is said in legend to be the gateway to the underworld Pulotu, where aitu, the spirits of deceased persons, reside.

The ruler of Pulotu is Saveasi&#x27;uleo, the father of Nafanua, a goddess of war from Falealupo. Another legend tells that Nafanua&#x27;s mother is Tilafaiga, who brought the art of Samoan tattoo with her sister Taema from Fiti. The village is also associated with the legend of Moso.

Nafanua, the goddess of war, fertility, and tattooing, is revered as the protector of her home village of Falealupo in Samoa.

The History of the Tātau
It is believed that the tatau, a traditional form of Samoan tattooing, was introduced to Samoa in the village of Falealupo. The origins of the tatau in Falealupo are steeped in legends and stories, passed down through generations of Samoans. The tatau was introduced to Samoa by two sisters, Taema and Tilafaiga, who brought it over from Fiti. Their story is often recounted in the Tatau Samoa Song, which tells of how they travelled to Samoa and sang a song that emphasized that only women should receive the tatau, not men. However, upon reaching Falealupo, they spotted a large clam and dived to see it. When they resurfaced, their song had changed to indicate that men, not women, should receive the tatau. 

House of Rock
The phrase &quot;e au le inailau a tamaitai&quot; originates from an ancient Samoan legend that tells a story of the village people of Falealupo; a group of women completed the thatching of a fale&#x27;s roof before the men did. This proverb exemplifies the strong work ethic of Samoan women and their resolute commitment to accomplishing their goals, no matter the challenges they may face. It underscores the value and importance that Samoan society places on the contributions of women, portraying them as skilled and determined members of their communities.

==Falealupo Rainforest conservation==
Falealupo land include large tracts of lowland rainforest. Most of Samoa&#x27;s land is locally village owned under customary land governed by family &quot;matai&quot;, the chiefly heads of extended families. In 1990 the Samoan government gave the remote village of Falealupo an ultimatum to build a better school or teachers would be removed and their children would not be educated. Education in Samoa is a partnership between villages and the government, and with most of the land under customary ownership, villages provide land and school buildings with the government providing teachers and the curriculum. Most of the island&#x27;s economy is based on subsistence living from plantations and fishing and with no other source of revenue, the villagers sold logging rights to their rainforests. Before the logging could take place, however, Seacology co-founder and chairman Paul Alan Cox, an American ethnobotanist who had lived with his family in the village, discovered that the pristine rainforests surrounding the village of Falealupo were to be logged. Cox worked with the village chiefs and promised to raise the funds for the school in exchange for a covenant protecting the rainforest.

The Falealupo Rainforest School was constructed, and the village bestowed matai titles on Paul Cox, Ken Murdock, and Rex Maughan. In recognition of his achievement, in 1997 Cox together with the late High Chief Fuiono Senio shared the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize. Cox donated his share of the prize to Seacology, which uses the funds to maintain the Falealupo Rainforest Canopy Aerial Walkway, dedicated in 1997. Seacology funded the walkway, which is owned and operated by the village, in order to help the community generate revenues from eco-tourism. At the ceremonial dedication, it was announced that the village would extend the 50-year covenant and promised to protect the rainforest in perpetuity.

In 1989, Cox was bestowed a &quot;matai&quot; chief title, Nafanua, by Falealupo in honour of his work. The title is registered with the Samoan Lands and Title Court.

In 1999, the village announced that beginning 1 January 2000 monthly tourist revenues from the aerial canopy walkway would be used to fund a modest retirement fund for village elders. In February 2008, the canopy walkway was closed due to rot in the 10m wooden tower leading up to the aerial rope walkway and platforms in a giant banyan tree. Seacology funded and constructed a new aluminium tower which was completed and opened on 10 June 2010.

Entry to the Falealupo rainforest walkway is about 2 km from the main road, on the way to the Falealupo Tai. A modest fee is charged by the village to visitors who wish to ascend the walkway.
==Notable Samoans from Falealupo==

Notable Samoans from Falealupo include;
* John Schuster, a former All Black (rugby union national team of New Zealand).
* Leo Lafaiali&#x27;i, a player for Manu Samoa (rugby union national team of Samoa) and a former Auckland Blues player.
* King Kapisi, a hip hop artist in New Zealand. The chief title of his family in Falealupo is A&#x27;eau. The grave of King Kapisi&#x27;s great grandfather Aeau Fa&#x27;aloaga is behind the new church in Falealupo-tai. In 1999, King Kapisi filmed his music video &quot;Reverse Resistance&quot; at Falealupo as well as Fagamalo, Safotu and at the Taga blowholes in Savaii. The opening shot in the video starts at the old church ruin in Falealupo (now the new church) and the closing shot is a sunset at Falealupo beach with children from his family. The song became the first hip hop song to win the prestigious APRA Silver Scroll Award in New Zealand.
* Aleni Smith - Olympic judoka who competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics.
*Pio Toanfinu&#x27;u - Archbishop of Somoa- Apia, First Somoan Cardinal.

<text>Copac (originally an acronym of Consortium of Online Public Access Catalogues) was a union catalogue which provided free access to the merged online catalogues of many major research libraries and specialist libraries in the United Kingdom and Ireland, plus the British Library, the National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales. It had over 40 million records from around 90 libraries as of 2019, representing a wide range of materials across all subject areas. Copac was freely available to all, and was widely used, with users mainly coming from Higher Education institutions in the United Kingdom, but also worldwide. Copac was valued by users as a research tool.

Copac was searchable through with a web browser or Z39.50 client. It was also accessible through OpenURL and Search/Retrieve via URL (SRU) interfaces. These interfaces could be used to provide links to items on Copac from external sites, such as those used on the Institute of Historical Research website.

Copac was a Jisc service provided for the UK community on the basis of an agreement with Research Libraries UK (RLUK). The service used records supplied by RLUK members, as well as an increasing range of specialist libraries with collections of national research interest. A full list of contributors is available including the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, the Middle Temple library and Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) Library.

In July 2019, Jisc replaced COPAC with Library Hub Discover.

<doc id="1052718" wikidata="Q779233" url="?curid=1052718" title="Moso's Footprint">
<text>According to myth, Moso&#x27;s Footprint in Samoa was made when the giant Moso stepped over to Fiji from Samoa, and the other footprint can be found on Viti Levu of Fiji. It is a 2m long depression in basalt.

The Legend of Moso&#x27;s Footprint: 

Moso was a notorious giant-God of Samoa. Moso had two sons named Filele and Pau of botanical forms. The two sons grew to become valuable native hardwood trees for the Samoan people and are commonly found in the Falealupo area. Tuifiti, a Fijian King traveled from Fiji to Samoa with the intention of marrying Moso&#x27;s children, only to discover they were not females. He returned to Fiji disappointed and his friendship with Moso as a result was severed. In order to restore their friendship, Moso stamped his right footprint in Samoa and his left in Fiji as a symbol of their infinite bond. Today, although very separate cultures with unique languages, Samoans and Fijians still hold a close bond.

How was the footprint actually formed?

This 2m long depression is a bit small for a giant who must have been 1500 km tall but there&#x27;s a natural explanation. Geologists believe the surface outcrop is a thin bed of heavily jointed basalt. A tree has spread roots over the surface with rootlets penetrating basalt joints. When the tree toppled during a cyclone many years ago, the roots dislodged surface blocks, creating the depression or &#x27;footprint&#x27; before you.

<text>George Clift King (April 23, 1848 – July 18, 1935) was the second mayor of the town of Calgary, Alberta.

==Early life==
King was born in Chelmsford, England in 1848. At the age of 26, he left England for Canada, arriving in Toronto, Ontario, in 1874.

==North-West Mounted Police==
King joined the North-West Mounted Police and was part of the first contingent sent west to establish Fort Calgary in 1875. Constable King is often called &quot;Calgary&#x27;s First Citizen&quot;, since he was the first NWMP officer to cross the Bow River and set foot on the future site of Calgary. This title is also sometimes given to Sam Livingston, another Calgary pioneer who arrived in the Calgary area in 1874; however, Calgary&#x27;s first European settler was John Glenn who settled at Fish Creek in 1873. According to his scrip record, Antoine Godin, a Métis, had taken up more-or-less permanent residence in the vicinity of Calgary as early as 1870.

==Life in Calgary==

King left the NWMP in 1877 to manage the first store in Calgary, the I. G. Baker Store. In November 1879, he married Louise Munro. Louise was the daughter of Métis fur trader, Felix Munro, and Louise Laderoute. She was also the granddaughter of famed plainsman Hugh &quot;Rising Wolf&quot; Munro and his Piikani wife. Together, George Clift King and Louise Munro were the first couple married in Calgary. Together they had four children. His son Edward (1885–1970) became a well-known ice hockey player in Calgary, and also played professionally with the Ottawa Senators in 1911–12.

In 1882, King started his own store &quot;G. C. King &amp; Co.&quot; which sold a wide variety of goods including groceries, clothing, drugs, stationery and tobacco. King&#x27;s store housed the local post office, and in 1885, King was appointed postmaster, and held this position for 36 years.

King was the mayor of the town of Calgary in the November 1886 Calgary municipal election, defeating John Lineham and served in the role from November 4, 1886, to January 16, 1888. King was elected following the &quot;Travis Affair&quot; where Mayor George Murdoch along with councillors Issac Sanford Freeze and Dr. Neville James Lindsay were removed from office effective October 21, 1886, by a special Territorial Ordinance issued by Stipendiary Magistrate Jeremiah Travis on allegations that Mayor Murdoch tampered with the voters&#x27; list in the prior election. Travis appointed James Reilly, the runner-up as Mayor, and Calgary was effectively without a local government until Justice Thomas Wardlaw Taylor was dispatched by the federal government to investigate and resolve the issue. King also spent four years as town councillor.

After his retirement as postmaster in 1921, he opened a tobacco and confectionery counter in MacLean&#x27;s Drug Store on Eighth Avenue. King ran this business until his death in 1935. King was inducted into the Order of the British Empire on January 1, 1934, by King George V.

King was laid to rest in Calgary&#x27;s Union Cemetery. On June 22, 2000, a monument was placed at King&#x27;s grave and the grave of James Colvin, as they had been unmarked for several years. This was done as part of the 125-year anniversary celebrations of Calgary.

<text>The ecoregions of Madagascar, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund, include seven terrestrial, five freshwater, and two marine ecoregions. Madagascar&#x27;s diverse natural habitats harbour a rich fauna and flora with high levels of endemism, but most ecoregions suffer from habitat loss.

==Overview==
Madagascar belongs to the Afrotropical realm. With its neighboring Indian Ocean islands, it has been classified by botanist Armen Takhtajan as &quot;Madagascan Region&quot;, and in phytogeography it is the floristic phytochorion &quot;Madagascan Subkingdom&quot; in the Paleotropical Kingdom. Madagascar features very contrasting topography, climate, and geology. A mountain range on the east, rising to at its highest point, captures most rainfall brought in by trade winds from the Indian Ocean. Consequently, the eastern belt harbours most of the humid forests, while precipitation decreases to the west. The rain shadow region in the southwest has a sub-arid climate. Temperatures are highest on the west coast, with annual means of up to , while the high massifs have a cool climate, with a annual mean locally. Geology features mainly igneous and metamorphic basement rocks, with some lava and quartzite in the central and eastern plateaus, while the western part has belts of sandstone, limestone (including the tsingy formations), and unconsolidated sand.

==Terrestrial ecoregions==

Seven terrestrial ecoregions are defined by the World Wildlife Fund for Madagascar. They range from the very humid eastern lowland forests to the sub-arid spiny thickets in the southwest.

==Freshwater ecoregions==
Freshwater ecoregions correspond to major catchment areas with a distinctive assemblage of species. In Madagascar, five ecoregions are distinguished:
* Madagascar Eastern Lowlands includes the lower humid-climate coastal plain of eastern Madagascar.
* Madagascar Eastern Highlands includes the middle and upper catchments of Madagascar&#x27;s eastern coastal rivers.
* Northwestern Madagascar encompasses the westward-flowing drainage basins from the northern tip of Madagascar to the Mahavavy du Sud River, including the Mananjeba, North Mahavavy (Mahavavy du Nord), Sambirano, Ankofia, Sofia, Anjobony, Mahajamba, Betsiboka, and South Mahavavy (Mahavavy du Sud).
* Western Madagascar encompasses the drier western river basins, including the Manambolo, Tsiribihina, Mangoky, and Onilahy rivers.
* Southern Madagascar encompasses the southern drainages of Madagascar, including the Mandrare, Manambovo, Menarandra, and Linta rivers, along with Lake Tsimanampetsotsa.

==Marine ecoregions==

The seas around Madagascar are part of the Western Indian Ocean province in the Western Indo-Pacific realm. They are divided into two marine ecoregions:
* Southeast Madagascar
* Western and Northern Madagascar

<doc id="1052729" wikidata="Q1986994" url="?curid=1052729" title="Sear (firearm)">
<text>In a firearm, the sear is the part of the trigger mechanism that holds the hammer, striker, or bolt back until the correct amount of pressure has been applied to the trigger, at which point the hammer, striker, or bolt is released to discharge the weapon. The sear may be a separate part or can be a surface incorporated into the trigger. Sear mechanisms are also frequently employed in archery release aids.

==Description==
As one firearms manufacturer notes:

Sear: A sharp bar, resting in a notch (or in British: &quot;bent&quot;) in a hammer (or in British: &quot;tumbler&quot;), holding the hammer back under the tension of the mainspring. When the trigger is pulled, the sear moves out of its notch, releasing the hammer and firing the gun.

The term &quot;sear&quot; is sometimes incorrectly used to describe a complete trigger group. 

Within a trigger group, any number of sears may exist. For example, a Ruger Blackhawk single-action revolver contains one for releasing the hammer. A Ruger Redhawk double/single-action revolver contains two, one for single-action release and the other for double-action release. A Browning BLR rifle contains three sears, all used simultaneously for hammer release. On many select-fire weapons, two sears exist, one for semi-automatic fire and the second for full-automatic fire. In this case, the selector switch disengages one over the other.

Trigger sears are a key component for trigger pull characteristics. Larger sears create creep while shorter ones produce a crisp pull. Aftermarket trigger companies, such as Bold, Timney, and Jewell, produce products in which sear contact is adjustable for personal preference. When a gunsmith does a &quot;trigger job&quot; to improve the quality and release of a trigger pull, most often the work includes modifying the sear, such as polishing, lapping, etc.

The sear on many firearms is often connected to a disconnector, which, after a cycle of semi-automatic fire has proceeded, keeps the hammer in place until the trigger is released and the sear takes over. Many firearms, such as the M1911 pistol, use a notch in the slide of the handgun that the top end of the disconnector returns to after the trigger is released. When the trigger is still under pressure by the firearm operator, the disconnector will not retract to its resting position. On other handguns, such as the Series 80 version of the M1911, a firing pin block acts as an internal safety, which is disengaged by the disconnector after the trigger is pulled. However, because of the spring tension placed on the disconnector by the firing pin block, the weight of the trigger pull is significantly increased. 

Trigger pull is related to the interaction of the sear with the trigger and the spring. It can be measured, regulated and adjusted, but it is a complicated mechanical problem.

==History==
The sear has been found on early weapons such as the crossbow. The term may be related to the French verb &quot;serrer&quot;, &quot;to grip&quot;, and the noun &quot;serre&quot;, &quot;claw, talon, grasp.&quot; The term appears in &quot;Hamlet&quot;: &quot;the Clown
shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o&#x27;th&#x27; sear&quot; (i.e. those who have a &#x27;hair-trigger&#x27; laugh reaction).

<text>The Mazingira Green Party of Kenya is a Kenyan green party. It was formerly known as Liberal Party of Kenya (LPK). At the 1997 Kenyan General Elections LPK fielded a presidential candidate, Wangari Maathai, who later became a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Maathai was only a minor candidate. She did not win a parliamentary seat. In 2002, the next general elections were held and the Maathai-led party was part of the victorious NARC coalition. Maathai herself won the Tetu Constituency parliamentary seat.

At the Kenyan general election, 2007, Mazingira was part of the newly created Party of National Unity led by President Mwai Kibaki. However, Mazingira also fielded own candidates. Mazingira won one parliamentary seat at the elections, after Silas Muriuki beat PNU candidate David Mwiraria to clinch the North Imenti Constituency parliamentary seat. Maathai was first outvoted at the PNU primary elections and therefore vied on Mazingira ticket, but at the parliamentary elections lost again to the PNU candidate.

==Terminology==

<text>The Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath!, usually shortened to The Irony of Fate, is a 1976 Soviet romantic comedy television film directed by Eldar Ryazanov and starring Andrey Myagkov, Barbara Brylska, Yury Yakovlev and Lyubov Dobrzhanskaya. The screenplay was written by Emil Braginsky and Ryazanov, loosely based on the director&#x27;s 1971 play, &quot;Once on New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; ().

Filmed at the Mosfilm Studios, &quot;The Irony of Fate&quot; doubles as a screwball comedy and a love story tinged with sadness. It was one of the most successful Soviet television productions and remains a highly popular New Year&#x27;s Eve classic in Russia and the post-Soviet states, with millions tuning in to rewatch it every New Year&#x27;s Eve.

==Plot==
The key subplot is the drab uniformity of Brezhnev-era public architecture. This setting is explained in a humorous animated prologue (directed and animated by cartoonist Vitaly Peskov) in which architects are overruled by politicians and red tape. As a result, the identical, functional but unimaginative multistory apartment buildings found their way into every city, town, and suburb across the Soviet Union.

Following their annual tradition, a group of friends meet at a &quot;banya&quot; (a traditional public &quot;sauna&quot; bathhouse) in Moscow to celebrate New Year&#x27;s Eve. The friends all get very drunk toasting the upcoming marriage of the central male character, Zhenya Lukashin (Andrey Myagkov) to Galya (Olga Naumenko). After the bath, one of the friends, Pavlik (Aleksandr Shirvindt), has to catch a flight to Leningrad and the entire group is going to take him to the airport. By the time the group makes it to the airport, Zhenya and Pavlik are passed out. The remaining friends cannot remember which person from their group is supposed to travel. They mistakenly get Zhenya onto the plane instead of Pavlik.

Zhenya spends the entire flight sleeping on the shoulder of his annoyed seatmate (Eldar Ryazanov in a brief comedic cameo appearance). The seatmate helps Zhenya get off the plane in Leningrad. Zhenya wakes up in the Leningrad airport, believing he is still in Moscow. He stumbles into a taxi and, still quite drunk, gives the driver his address. It turns out that in Leningrad there is an identical address that belongs to an apartment buildings of a design identical to Zhenya&#x27;s building in Moscow. He takes the elevator to &quot;his&quot; apartment and, surprisingly, the key fits in the door (as alluded to in the introductory narration, &quot;...building standard apartments with standard locks&quot;). Inside, even the furniture is nearly identical to that of Zhenya&#x27;s apartment, but Zhenya is too drunk to notice any minor differences.

Meanwhile, the apartment&#x27;s resident, Nadya Shevelyova (Barbara Brylska), comes home and finds Zhenya asleep on her bed. To make matters worse, Nadya&#x27;s fiancé, Ippolit (Yuri Yakovlev), shows up without an advance notice. Ippolit becomes furious, refuses to believe Zhenya and Nadya&#x27;s explanations, and storms out. Zhenya is about to leave to get back to Moscow but circumstances make him return repeatedly. Nadya wants to get rid of Zhenya as soon as possible, but there are no flights to Moscow until the next morning. Additionally, Zhenya tries repeatedly to call Moscow and explain to Galya what has happened. Eventually, he does contact Galya, but she is furious and hangs up on his call. Ippolit also calls Nadya&#x27;s apartment and hears Zhenya answer. Although Zhenya is trying to be available to receive potential calls from Galya, Ippolit also refuses to accept the truth of the situation. Nadya goes to the railway station and buys a train ticket to Moscow for Zhenya, but he drops it out the window and refuses to leave. It seems more and more clear that Zhenya and Nadya are the only two people who understand the night&#x27;s circumstances.

Thus, Zhenya and Nadya are compelled to spend New Year&#x27;s Eve together. At first, they continue to treat each other with animosity, but gradually their behavior softens, and the two fall in love. In the morning, a drunken Ippolit barges into the apartment and amazes Zhenya and Nadia with his erratic behavior (he takes a shower right in his winter coat and hat) and at the same time logical and close to the truth arguments about what happened on this New Year&#x27;s Eve. Ippolit, wet &quot;with tears&quot;, leaves Nadia for good. The duo feel that everything that has happened to them was a delusion, and they make the difficult decision to part. With a heavy heart, Zhenya returns to Moscow. Meanwhile, Nadya reconsiders everything and, deciding that she might have let her chance at happiness slip away, takes a plane to Moscow to find Zhenya. She has no difficulty finding him as their addresses are the same, and her key matches his lock.

==Soundtrack==

After reading the script, composer Mikael Tariverdiev was puzzled by its genre diversity. As a result, he defined it for himself as a Christmas fairy tale, and for musical accompaniment he chose eight romances – &quot;about love, about happiness, about jealousy, about kindness, about the desire to be understood&quot; – which at first sound like a sharp counterpoint to what is happening on the screen, but then &quot;scissors between the sound and the picture converged&quot;.

The soundtrack for &quot;The Irony of Fate&quot; was partly released on Mikael Tariverdiev&#x27;s LP in 1976 by Melodiya. A full soundtrack was released in 2009 by Bomba Music (Russia) and in 2016 by Earth (UK).

Male vocals are mostly performed by Sergey Nikitin, female vocals – by Alla Pugacheva. Initially, Anna German was preparing to perform songs for the film, but the recording did not take place – the funds for the invitation of a foreign singer were not included in the estimate.
==Reception==
The two consecutive episodes of &quot;The Irony of Fate&quot; were originally broadcast by the Soviet central television channel, Programme One, on 1 January 1976, at 18:00. The film was a resounding success with audiences: author Fedor Razzakov recalled that &quot;virtually the entire country watched the show&quot;; the number of viewers was estimated to have been about 100 million. In response to popular demand, the feature had a first re-run on 7 February. By 1978, after several further broadcasts of the picture, the accumulated number of viewers for all of the showings including the first was estimated at 250 million. A shortened 155 minute version was released to cinemas on 16 August 1976; which sold 7 million tickets. The readers of &quot;Sovetskii Ekran&quot;, the official publication of the State Committee for Cinematography, voted &quot;The Irony of Fate&quot; as the best film of 1976, and chose Andrey Myagkov as the best actor of the year. In 1977, Ryazanov, Braginsky, cinematographer Vladimir Nakhabtsev, composer Mikael Tariverdiev and actors Barbara Brylska and Myagkov were all awarded the USSR State Prize in recognition of their participation in making the film.

George Faraday commented that while it was basically a happy ending romantic comedy, &quot;The Irony of Fate&quot; had a &quot;socially critical undertone.&quot; It could be interpreted as an &quot;explicit commentary... On the soulless uniformity of the Soviet urban landscape&quot;. Simultaneously, however, critics accused the director of creating an escapist film which allowed the Soviet audience to turn away from the &quot;unattractive features&quot; of their country&#x27;s reality. In a 1977 issue of &quot;Sovetskii Ekran&quot;, Ryazanov responded that &quot;to reassure, to encourage the viewer – it is not such a sin.&quot; He rejected the claims his pictures were meant to please state authorities, stating their optimistic nature was &quot;spontaneous&quot; rather than &quot;forced&quot;.

In his book &quot;Problems in the Russian House&quot;, Sergey Kara-Murza posted a critical article in which he reproached Ryazanov for the &quot;anti-Sovietism&quot; nature of his heroes, as well as for the formation and cultivation of images of &quot;internal emigrants&quot; by him. In his opinion, the heroes of the film are &quot;typical intelligents of those years with social traits close to this circle,&quot; who, however, are well over thirty but they do not have a family and children, while having energetic mothers [almost implausible for a post-war generation] who care about their comfort and material well-being. The subtle signs of the &quot;far-fetched elitism, aristocracy&quot; of the film&#x27;s characters were picked up and assimilated by a very significant part of the intelligentsia, who eventually &quot;enthusiastically accepted Perestroika and applauded Sakharov&quot;.

In 2019, archdeacon Vladimir Vasilik analyzed several themes of the film – orphanhood and fatherlessness of the Soviet intelligentsia of the Khrushchev-Brezhnev era, love and betrayal, drunkenness, blizzard as an image of Fate and a metaphor of infernal fun for the New Year, – and described the film as &quot;a monument to the era of late socialism with all its greatness and tragedy,&quot; which at the same time &quot;carries the reflection of the love fading on earth from people who have experienced God-abandonment.&quot; Longing for God is transmitted primarily &quot;in songs and poems that serve as a chorus in ancient tragedy.&quot;

==Legacy==
The film is widely regarded as a classic piece of Russian popular culture and is traditionally broadcast in Russia and almost all former Soviet republics every New Year&#x27;s Eve (Andrew Horton and Michael Brashinsky likened its status to that held by Frank Capra&#x27;s 1946 &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; in the United States as a holiday staple). The soundtrack of the film was also highly appreciated and places among the most famous and recognizable music of an era in post-Soviet countries. This tradition was discontinued in Ukraine in 2015 when licence holder STB decided not to broadcast the movie after the actress Valentina Talyzina was banned from entering Ukraine for &quot;statements contradicting the interests of our national security&quot;.

In 2006, The New Year&#x27;s Eve musical film &quot;The First Fast&quot;, shown on Channel One, included a mini-sequel to &quot;The Irony of Fate&quot;. Ippolit and Nadia meet after 30 years. During the heartful conversation, it turns out that Zhenya and Nadia broke up quite quickly and Ippolit is still not married. To Nadia&#x27;s question, &quot;Why?&quot; he answers: &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting for you. And I keep waiting.&quot; Nadia doesn&#x27;t know what to answer and whispers &quot;Don&#x27;t be sad&quot;. Ippolit remains alone. Gleb Kolondo (Vatnikstan) considered: &quot;It seemed to be better than Bekmambetov&#x27;s [film] two years later&quot;.

==Sequel==
A sequel, &quot;The Irony of Fate 2&quot;, was released in December 2007, becoming a box office hit and grossing over $55 million to a production budget of $5 million.

The film starred Konstantin Khabensky and Elizaveta Boyarskaya as the grown-up children of Lukashin and Sheveleva who have managed to get into the same situation as their parents did.

Andrey Myagkov, although he took part in the filming, eventually expressed his regret and dissatisfaction with the final result.

==Remakes==
In 2015, an Indian remake of the film &quot;I Love NY&quot; was released, starring actors Sunny Deol and Kangana Ranaut. The film performed poorly critically and was a box office flop.

In 2022, an American remake of the film &quot;About Fate&quot; was released. It was directed by Maryus Vaysberg and starred Emma Roberts and Thomas Mann in the lead roles.

<text>Aurillac (; ) is the prefecture of the Cantal department, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of France.

== Geography ==
Aurillac is at above sea level and located at the foot of the Cantal mountains in a small sedimentary basin. The city is built on the banks of the Jordanne, a tributary of the Cère. It is south of Paris and north of Toulouse. Aurillac was part of a former Auvergne province called Haute-Auvergne and is only away from the heart of the Auvergne Volcano Park. Access to the commune is by numerous roads including the D922 from Naucelles in the north, the D17 from Saint-Simon in the north-east, Route nationale N122 from Polminhac in the east which continues to Sansac-de-Marmiesse in the south-west, the D920 to Arpajon-sur-Cère in the south-east, and the D18 to Ytrac in the west. Aurillac station, in the centre of town, lies on the Figeac-Arvant railway. It has rail connections to Clermont-Ferrand, Brive-la-Gaillarde and Toulouse. About 50% of the commune is urbanised with farmland to the east and west of the urban area.

Aurillac – Tronquières Airport is located in the south of the commune with its runway extending beyond the commune boundary. It is connected to Paris by two daily flights by the Air France subsidiary HOP!. The commune was awarded three flowers by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.

The Jordanne river flows through the heart of the commune from north to south where it joins the Cère just south of the commune.

=== Localities and districts ===

*Boudieu on the N122, which is called the &quot;Route de Sansac-de-Marmiesse&quot; or &quot;de Toulouse&quot;, is a farm with a farm house from the 1900s and three farm buildings.
*Boudieu-Bas on the N122 is a set of houses built in the 1960s with some buildings used commercially or for crafts.
*Gueret on the N122 is a farm with two houses and two agricultural buildings. This hamlet is traversed by an old country road from a place formerly called &quot;Julien&quot; from which name for the SNCF &quot;Julien Bridge&quot; comes. The former &quot;Julien&quot; is towards the Chateau of Tronquières in the urban area on Avenue Charles de Gaulle opposite the Medico-Surgical Centre (CMC). This farm with its house and barn were absorbed by the city on the creation of a district in the 1970s until the mid 1980s. The agricultural buildings were demolished to make room for a shop.
*La Sablère on the RN122 is a set of dwellings mostly from the 1980s. Originally there was a farm. This place spreads over two communes: Aurillac and Arpajon-sur-Cere with the majority of the buildings in Arpajon-sur-Cere.
*Le Barra near the avenue Aristide Briand, also called the &quot;Ancienne route de Vic&quot; or the old N120. This is a farm and houses.
*Les Quatre Chemins at the intersection of the D120 and the D922 on the borders of Aurillac, Naucelles, and Ytrac. It is a complex of commercial buildings and residences on the crossroads of the two former National highways.
*Tronquières on an avenue. Originally it was a farm with a chateau but the chateau and outbuildings were demolished in 2011. Today it is a grouping of housing units specializing in housing assistance for the integration of disabled people (ADAPEI) and the airport. It is the reception area for travellers to the city and a former landfill and rubbish centre. Before the construction of the airport the meadows were areas for summer grazing for nearby farms such as the Boudieu farm.

===Climate===
Influenced by its altitude, Aurillac features an oceanic climate (Cfb), closely bordering on a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) under the Köppen system. In spite of this, the city enjoys more than 2,100 hours of sunshine per year on average, but also a high amount of precipitations per year on average. The record low temperature was on 9 January 1985 and the record high was on 30 July 1983.

==Toponymy==
The origin of the name &quot;Aurillac&quot; is from &quot;Aureliacum&quot; meaning &quot;Villa of Aurelius&quot; and dates back to the Gallo-Roman era. It is attested in the polygonal &quot;Fanum d&#x27;Aron&quot; which was built in the 1st century and discovered in 1977 at Lescudillier.

==History==
It is thought that in the Gallic era the original site of the city was on the heights overlooking the current city at &quot;Saint-Jean-de-Dône&quot; (&quot;Dône&quot; from &quot;dunum&quot;) and, like most oppida, it was abandoned after the Roman conquest in favour of a new city established on the plain. With the return of instability in the Lower Roman Empire there was a movement towards Encastellation and a new fortified site was established in mid-slope between the former oppidum and the old Gallo-Roman city where the Chateau of Saint-Étienne is today.

The history of the city is really only known from 856, the year of the birth of Count Gerald of Aurillac at the castle where his father, also named Gerald, was lord. In 885 he founded a Benedictine monastery which later bore his name. It was in this monastery that Gerbert, the first French pope under the name of Sylvester II, studied.

The city was made in a &quot;Sauveté&quot; area which was located between four crosses and was founded in 898 by Gerald shortly after the abbey. The first urban area was circular and built close to the Abbey of Aurillac. Gerald died around 910 but his influence was such that over the centuries Gerald was always a baptismal name prevalent in the population of Aurillac and the surrounding area.

It was in the 13th century that municipal conflict began between consuls and abbots. After taking the Chateau of Saint-Étienne in 1255 and two negotiated agreements called the Peace of Aurillac, relations were normalised.

In the 13th and 14th centuries Aurillac withstood several sieges by the English and in the 16th century continued to suffer from civil and religious wars.

The influence of the abbey declined with its secularization and its implementation of orders.

In 1569 the city was delivered by treason to the Protestants: people were tortured and held to ransom and the Abbey was sacked. The library and archives were all burned.

Before the French Revolution Aurillac had a Présidial and carried the title of capital of the &quot;Haute-Auvergne&quot;. In 1790 on the creation of departments, after a period of alternating with Saint-Flour, Aurillac definitively became the capital of Cantal.

The arrival of the railway in 1866 accelerated the development of the city.

At the first census in 1759 there were 6,268 people in Aurillac, it now has about 28,000.

===Military===
Two military units are garrisoned in Aurillac:
*the 139th Infantry Regiment, 1906
*the 2/16 Squadron of riot police which became the 33/5 in 1991 after the creation of legions of riot police then finally the 18/5 in 2011 after the dissolution of the GM group of Clermont-Ferrand.

Aurillac has long been a garrison town with the 139th Infantry Regiment, who are noted for their feats during the Battle of the Somme. They have a remarkable chronology and a cabinet of trophies were displayed in the Hall of Honour of the Departmental Military Delegation who have since moved, forgetting to preserve and safeguard this part of history.

The military square is wide and airy and a feature of military architecture of the time. It is now known as the Zone of Peace and is now converted into a parking lot leaving a clear view of the 3 buildings that surround it. The entrance to the barracks was destroyed and replaced by a modern building. It houses administrative services, treasury, CABA, Mortgages, Cadastre etc. In the 1950s the old military buildings became the &quot;Cité Administrative&quot;.

The &quot;clock building&quot; is called so because of the great clock that adorns this building. It is also commonly called the &quot;House of unions and associations&quot;. Originally these buildings were the former Convent of the Visitation, built in 1682. The Convent was converted into a barracks for infantry in 1792 and occupied half of the buildings until 1922, hence the transformation of buildings to equestrian use. Today the Pierre-Mendès-France Cultural Centre occupies the premises including the Museum of Art and Archaeology, the County Conservatory of Music and Dance, the youth service activities of the town of Aurillac, and a crèche for children. The Stables were then used by the national stud established by Napoleon in 1806; a depot of stallions was created in Aurillac. At the Battle of Austerlitz Napoleon rode &quot;Cantal&quot;, a speckled gray horse which is visible in a painting in the Art and Archaeology Museum. When the National Stud moved the stables were transformed into an exhibition hall / gallery and a range of exhibitions is held every year including the Salon des Métiers d&#x27;Art d&#x27;Aurillac.

<text>Apolima is the smallest of the four inhabited islands of Samoa, in central South Pacific Ocean. It lies in the Apolima Strait, between the country&#x27;s two largest islands: Upolu to the east, and Savai&#x27;i to the west.

The island has one village settlement, Apolima Tai, with a population of 96. The small settlement is situated in the interior&#x27;s flat plateau, on the northern side.

Apolima is the rim of an extinct volcanic crater with a maximum height of 165 m. Its area is slightly less than one square kilometer. The only access to the island is by boat.

The tiny island lies northwest off the westernmost edge of Upolu Island&#x27;s fringing reef and southwest of the island of Savai&#x27;i. The island&#x27;s shape is like an upturned bowl surrounded by steep cliffs. There is a broad opening to the sea on the northern side, which is the main entry point. Entry is only by boat. 

There are two neighbouring islands in the strait, Manono Island, which has a small population, and the smaller, uninhabited islet of Nu&#x27;ulopa.

Apolima island is part of the political district of Aiga-i-le-Tai.

In August 2022 the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment began discussions with local residents about eradicating rats from the island to protect the local environment.

<text>Manono is an island of Samoa, situated in the Apolima Strait between the main islands of Savai&#x27;i and Upolu, 3.4 km west-northwest off Lefatu Cape, the westernmost point of Upolu. By population, as well as by area, it is Samoa’s third largest island.

There are four villages on the island with a total population of 889 (2006 Census). Electricity was only introduced in 1995 and there are several shops with beach fale accommodation for visitors. The boat trip from Upolu island takes about 20 minutes.

The neighbouring islands are Apolima, which has a small village settlement and the islet Nu&#x27;ulopa.

Manono Island is part of the political district Aiga-i-le-Tai. The majority of people in the Aiga-i-le-Tai district live on the &#x27;mainland&#x27; at the west end of Upolu island. Dogs of any kind are prohibited on Manono island.

==Villages==
The four villages and their populations on Manono Island are

#Apai, west (111)
#Faleu, south (354)
#Lepuia&#x27;i, southwest (223)
#Salua, north (201)

Out of the four inhabited islands of Samoa, Manono Island has the third largest population, after the much larger islands of Upolu and Savai&#x27;i. There are no cars or roads. The main thoroughfare is a footpath that follows the coast. Dogs and horses are banned for environmental reasons. However, dogs were sighted on the island in September 2016.

In the early 19th century, the island was sometimes called &quot;Flat Island&quot;, because it consists of a small, flat hill and surrounding low-lying terrain, which is only visible at close approach.

During the 1800s, Manono island was a stronghold for the Methodist church and its early mission in Samoa. At an annual church meeting here on 21 September 1859, a decision was made to establish a training institution on Upolu island which eventually led to the establishment of Piula Theological College in Lufilufi.

==Neighbouring islands==
The other two islands in the Apolima Strait are Apolima with one small village and the tiny uninhabited island of Nu&#x27;ulopa, which is 700 meters west-northwest of the northwestern corner of Manono. Nu&#x27;ulopa is 37 m high and about 100 meters in diameter (0.01 km²).

<text>Gary Olsen (born Gary Kenneth Grant; 3 November 1957 – 12 September 2000) was an English actor. He played Ben Porter on the BBC television sitcom &quot;2point4 Children&quot; from 1991 to 1999.

==Biography==
Olsen was born in London and lived with an aunt and uncle after both his parents, Patricia and Kenny, died when he was young. He attended the Archbishop Tenison&#x27;s Church of England School in Kennington. After school he joined various junior stage groups and toured with fringe theatrical companies, such as Incubus and Lumiere and Son, until late 1976. At this point he immersed himself in the punk rock scene as lead vocalist with the band Swank (alongside future members of the Lurkers, Chelsea, and Cuddly Toys) until returning to theatre in 1978. Later he helped develop the musical production &quot;Up on the Roof&quot;, in which he starred in 1987 at London&#x27;s Donmar and Apollo theatres.

He made his screen debut in 1979 as Rory Storm in &quot;Birth of The Beatles&quot;, and appeared in numerous British films and television programmes. He played PC Dave Litten in the first series of &quot;The Bill&quot;, but achieved mainstream success only with the role of Ben in the sitcom &quot;2point4 Children&quot; (1991–1999). He played a starring film role as Arthur Hoyle alongside Samantha Janus and Neil Morrissey in the rugby league comedy, &quot;Up &#x27;n&#x27; Under&quot;. He appeared in many TV adverts, including a 1996 National Westminster Bank advertising campaign.

In addition to his screen appearances he made numerous stage appearances including &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot;. He also played &#x27;Pope Liberty III&#x27; in the Australian production of the musical &quot;Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom&quot;.

Olsen appeared as Steve in &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; parody of &quot;The Fly&quot;, called &quot;The Yob&quot;. He also starred with Brian Bovell in the 1986 TV series &quot;Prospects&quot; about two young men in the Docklands trying to get ahead but usually failing.

==Television roles==
Olsen appeared in two episodes of the 1981 BBC TV series &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; as a street gang leader who later became an armed paramilitary officer.

He played PC Dave Litten in 12 episodes of &quot;The Bill&quot; between 1984 and 1986 (as well as the 1983 pilot episode, &quot;Woodentop&quot;). Olsen also starred in the 1986 TV series Prospects alongside Brian Bovell who played Jez Littlewood in &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot;, about two friends living in the Docklands area trying their hand at anything to make a &quot;few bob&quot;. In 1988, he appeared in the &quot;EastEnders&quot; spin-off &quot;CivvyStreet&quot; as Albert, the patriarch of the Beale family. His most prominent role was as Ben Porter in &quot;2point4 Children&quot; (1991–1999). He also had leading roles in another two short-lived BBC sitcoms &quot;Health and Efficiency&quot; (1993–1995) and &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Rest&quot; opposite Gwen Taylor for one series in 1997. From 1999–2000 he played Johno in the Daz Dogs adverts and sponsors.

==Stage roles==
Olsen was critically acclaimed for a number of his roles in musicals including &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, &quot;Cut and Thrust&quot;, &quot;Gorky Brigade&quot;, &quot;Welcome Home&quot;, &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, &quot;Saved Dialogues&quot;, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, &quot;Serious Money&quot;, &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot;, &quot;Way of the World&quot;, and &quot;Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom&quot;. He received particular praise for his portrayal of Moey in &quot;On the Ledge&quot; at the National Theatre in 1993. Two years later he appeared in &quot;April in Paris&quot; at the same theatre. His last stage role was as Evan in &quot;Art&quot; by Yasmina Reza, in 2000.

==Personal life==
Olsen married Candy Davis (later known as the crime writer Mo Hayder) in 1985; they later divorced. He married Australian Jane Anthony in 1991; the couple had two children. After a ten-month illness with cancer, Olsen died on 12 September 2000 in Victoria, Australia, where he had emigrated following his diagnosis. He was 42 years old.

<doc id="1052782" wikidata="Q2925723" url="?curid=1052782" title="British Cycling">
<text>British Cycling (formerly the British Cycling Federation) is the main national governing body for cycle sport in Great Britain. It administers most competitive cycling in Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. It represents Britain at the world body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and selects national teams, including the Great Britain (GB) Cycling Team for races in Britain and abroad. , it has a total membership of 165,000.

It is based at the National Cycling Centre on the site of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.

==History==
The British Cycling Federation (BCF) was formed in 1959 at the end of an administrative dispute within the sport. The governing body since 1878 had been the National Cyclists Union (NCU). The legality of cyclists on the road had not been established and the NCU worried that all cycling could be affected by police concerns about racing. The cycling historian Bernard Thompson said: &quot;Events organised by clubs in the 1880s, although taking place on quiet country roads, were constantly interrupted by the police. Often horse-mounted policemen charged at racers and threw sticks into their wheels.&quot; The race organiser and writer, Chas Messenger, said: &quot;Thousands of cyclists were convicted or fined for dangerous riding, many on mere suspicion and unsupported evidence.&quot;

The NCU banned all racing on the road and insisted clubs use velodromes. A rebel organisation, eventually known as the Road Time Trials Council (RTTC), began running races of individuals competing against the clock at dawn and in secrecy, to avoid police attention. The NCU eventually accepted the RTTC and the two organisations ran the sport between them, the RTTC interested only in time-trialling and the NCU administering track races and representing Britain at meetings of the UCI.

Infighting was sparked by the UCI&#x27;s decision that world road championships from 1933 would be not individual contests but competitions in which riders started together. The NCU had never been against such races but insisted that in Britain they were on roads closed to traffic, such as airfields and motor-racing courses. It now had to select riders not on their talent against the clock but in a bunch. Selection races were held at Donington Park and Brooklands. Among the riders were some, like Percy Stallard, who believed races ought to be run on the open road. He organised a race from Llangollen to Wolverhampton, in 1942. The NCU suspended Stallard and others and they formed the British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC). It and the NCU fought each other until they merged in 1959.

===The British Cycling Federation===
The merged organisation became the British Cycling Federation. It accepted racing on the open road and controlled all competitive cycling other than time-trialling, which remained with the RTTC. Cyclo-cross was administered by the British Cyclo-Cross Association, which was linked to the BCF. The BCF was recognised by the UCI. The first officials were perceived to be drawn largely from the NCU and there was bitterness among supporters of the former BLRC that they had been betrayed.

The BCF had offices in central London. The first were in the headquarters of the Sports Council in Park Crescent, near Hyde Park. They subsequently moved to other London premises on Brompton Road and Upper Woburn Place, before moving out of the capital to Rockingham Road, Kettering, Northamptonshire in 1988, and finally to the velodrome in Manchester.

The British Cycling Federation was renamed simply British Cycling after it merged with the British Cyclo-Cross Association, the British Mountain Bike Federation, the English BMX Association and the British Cycle Speedway Council. Each is now a commission within the BCF.

In 1996, the BCF incurred large debts as a result of a legal dispute with Tony Doyle, who resigned from his position as President of the Federation shortly after its Board attempted to remove him. Doyle had been elected to the Presidency in late 1995 on a platform of increasing transparency and accountability in the Federation: the campaign to remove him was based on claims that he had failed to declare his role as a consultant to a company that wanted to act as the promoter for the 1996 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Manchester. In December 1996, the report of auditors from the UK Sports Council into the Federation&#x27;s finances and management found that there were serious shortcomings in its procedures for accounting and control of finances and potential conflicts of interests between board members and leading companies in the cycling sector. The board were then removed by the membership and replaced with an emergency management committee. As a result of the report, Minister for Sport Iain Sproat warned that the BCF&#x27;s Sports Council grants could be withdrawn and that it could be banned from applying for Lottery money. Brian Cookson was elected as president soon afterwards: he described the organisation&#x27;s situation at the time as &quot;close to bankruptcy, 14,000 members and falling, one Olympic gold in 76 years and not much 
else to show. It was pretty dire&quot;.

===International dominance===
In December 1997, British Cycling appointed Peter Keen as its Performance Director, with initial responsibility for £900,000 of funding granted by the UK Sports Council on the basis of a one-year interim World Class Performance Plan. He was chosen ahead of Steve Paulding and Paul Sherwen. Keen immediately outlined the focus of the Plan, emphasising that it would mainly be aimed at targeting track cycling due to the large number of Olympic medals on offer. He spent much of the next year developing an eight-year plan to secure longer-term funding: in January 1999 it was announced that British Cycling had secured lottery funding for six years, with an award of £2.5 million for the first year. Later that year, the GB team sprint squad took the first British sprint medal at a World Championship for 40 years at the Berlin Track Worlds.

The first fruits of the programme were harvested at the 2000 Summer Olympics: on the track, Team GB took two bronzes, a silver and a gold medal, the latter of which was taken by Jason Queally in the 1 km time trial. Following the Games, Keen started speaking publicly about what Britain needed to do to become the world number one nation in track cycling. The team backed up their Olympic success at the subsequent 2000 UCI Track Cycling World Championships on home ground in Manchester by winning five medals, including a first world title for Yvonne McGregor in the individual pursuit.

From 2001 to the present day, British cycling has greatly improved its standing in world track cycling and is now considered a dominant force in cycling. In 2001, two key members of staff were appointed, with Dave Brailsford becoming Performance Director for the World Class Performance Programme and Heiko Salzwedel joining as National Track Manager. In July 2002 the Talent Team programme was launched, which aimed to discover new riders through working with schools: riders identified through the initiative who have enjoyed success at the highest level include Dani Rowe, Laura Kenny, Peter Kennaugh, Elinor Barker and Lizzie Deignan. After a disappointing performance at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, the squad bounced back at the Track World Championships, where they finished second in the medal table with three gold medals. That year also saw the appointment of Shane Sutton in Manchester, having previously been Welsh national coach.

In 2003, the first six riders joined British Cycling&#x27;s new Olympic Academy for junior riders, under the leadership of Rod Ellingworth, with a budget of £100,000 for the first year. Among the first cohort were Ed Clancy and Mark Cavendish, although the latter was almost passed over due to his relatively poor performance in lab tests, with coaches Ellingworth, John Herety and Simon Lillistone lobbying Keen to include him due to his potential. The academy used a training base in Tuscany from 2006 to 2010, and has since returned to Italy, basing itself in Montichiari since 2016. Other notable riders who participated in the academy programme include Kennaugh, Geraint Thomas, Ian Stannard, Ben Swift and Simon Yates. That year Keen left his role, whilst continuing to work with British Cycling in a consultancy capacity until the 2004 Summer Olympics: Brailsford was appointed as his replacement.

At the 2004 Athens Olympics cycling events, Great Britain came third in the medal table: they took two golds, a silver and a bronze, with Bradley Wiggins taking one medal of each colour - the first British Olympian to do this in 40 years. Brailsford gave much of the credit for the team&#x27;s results to the psychiatrist Steve Peters, who had started working with the squad. From 2004 to 2009, it came top of the medals tally for three out of six UCI Track Cycling World Championships.

The team is noted for its distinctive high performance equipment. From the early days of Keen&#x27;s tenure, they worked with outside firms to produce more aerodynamic bicycles and bicycle parts. They started using their own Sport Institute bicycles in 2002, and subsequently Chris Boardman played a key role in redesigning equipment and clothing to maximise efficiency. British Cycling continues to work with NASA, McLaren Group and many other organisations to improve track speeds. In the late 2000s, the team consisted of riders as Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton, Bradley Wiggins, and Rebecca Romero.

This success has continued in road racing with riders such as Nicole Cooke and Mark Cavendish. British cycling has also formed a professional cycling team with BSkyB as the main sponsor and Bradley Wiggins as the team leader and David Brailsford as the manager. In 2012, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. This was followed the next year when Chris Froome won the 2013 Tour de France. Team Sky is registered as a UCI ProTeam. Recent years have also seen British dominance in downhill mountain biking, in both the Downhill World Cup and Downhill World Championships. In 2014, all three female podium positions, and the top two male positions, in the Downhill World Championships were taken by British athletes.

===End of Olympic dominance and aftermath===
At 2024 Olympics Great Britain were knocked off the top of the Cycling Olympic Medal table for the time since the Athens 2004 games having finished with eleven medals total but only two golds as the British team were overhauled by other teams including old rivals Australia and Netherlands.
Following the 2024 Olympics it was announced that British-born track cyclist Matthew Richardson, who won three medals whilst representing Australia during the 2024 Olympics would be switching allegiance to the country of his birth and would represent Great Britain in international competition from September 2024 onwards. Richardson won 10 medals in international competition whilst representing his previous country including 3 Olympic medals, 5 World Championship medals (including one gold) and two Commonwealth medals (both of which were gold medals). This announcement drew a frosty response from AusCycling (the cycling governing body of Australia) to the point they confirmed to Australian media that they were actively considering enforcing for a two-year &#x27;non-competition order&#x27; on Richardson which would stop Richardson from competing in international competitions for Great Britain until 2026.

==Organisation==
British Cycling administers road racing, track cycling, cyclo-cross, BMX, mountain biking (including trials riding), cycle speedway, and in Scotland, road time trials. The main exception is road time trials in England and Wales, which are administered by Cycling Time Trials, the current name of the Road Time Trials Council. Only road time-trials in England and Wales remain outside British Cycling, but Cycling Time Trials works with British Cycling to organise the time-trial national championships.

Cycling clubs or teams affiliate to British Cycling to race in British Cycling events. Adult road racing licences are graded by excellence, from fourth and lowest to first and élite. There are licences for under-18s and for women.

British Cycling is a member of the European Cycling Union, the UCI and the British Olympic Association.

===Sponsorship===
BSkyB sponsored British Cycling from 2008 to 2016.

HSBC is British Cycling&#x27;s Lead Partner for the period 2017 to 2024.

==Criticism==
In 2017, British Cycling faced criticism from UK Sport over alleged bullying, unlawful discrimination and &quot;dysfunctional leadership&quot;.

Also in 2017, the Guardian describes how Mark Cavendish and Bradley Wiggins feel as though they have been overlooked by British cycling when they were not selected to compete in the Tokyo Olympics. Wiggins went as far as to say that he felt that British cycling were lacking in &#x27;someone who actually knows what they&#x27;re talking about&#x27;.

The organisation has also been criticised during the &quot;Combatting Doping in Sport inquiry&quot; of the House of Commons, particularly in relation to the supply of fluimucil to Bradley Wiggins in 2011.

In 2019, 22 charges were brought against former British Cycling doctor Richard Freeman by a medical tribunal which include lying to colleagues and the UK Anti-Doping Agency.

In 2022, British Cycling suspended its &#x27;Transgender and Non-Binary Participation policy&#x27; to conform with the requirements of the UCI, resulting in transgender cyclist Emily Bridges being ineligible for the British National Madison Championships. The suspension of the policy led to a sponsor of the Women&#x27;s CiCLE Classic to withdraw in protest.

In September 2022, British Cycling faced widespread ridicule after issuing guidance that following the death of Queen Elizabeth II that cyclists should avoid cycling during 
the funeral &quot;out of respect&quot;; British Cycling subsequently amended its position after a widespread backlash.

In October 2022, British Cycling faced a barrage of criticism on the announcement that it would be entering into a major partnership with the oil company Shell, with Greenpeace calling it &quot;brazen sportswashing&quot;.

==Regional bodies==
In Scotland and Wales, British Cycling operates with regional bodies: Scottish Cycling (Scottish Cyclists&#x27; Union) and Welsh Cycling (Welsh Cycling Union). Scotland and Wales run national teams.

There is no regional body for England. England is not recognised as a region by the UCI, and there is no English cycling team outside the Commonwealth Games. For those occasions, British Cycling selects and supports the England team. Cycling is represented on the Isle of Man by the Isle of Man Cycling Association.

Cycling in Northern Ireland is organised under Cycling Ulster, part of the all-Ireland governing body Cycling Ireland. Until 2006, a rival governing body existed, the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation. It was affiliated to British Cycling, causing friction between the British body and the international federation, the UCI.

===British overseas territories===
British Cycling represents the cycling associations of British overseas territories in the UCI, if they are not themselves UCI members.

The Gibraltar Cycling Association is the regional governing body for Gibraltar.

==Great Britain Cycling Team Olympic Programmes==

International performances have improved since British Cycling began receiving National Lottery funding in the late 1990s. It won three golds in the 2002 world track championships and four in 2005. Britain won nine of 18 gold medals at the 2008 world track championships. In September 2004, British Cycling helped organise the Tour of Britain, a five-day race finishing in London.

===Olympic Podium Programme===
Riders in this programme are expected to be seasoned world-class performers with a track record of success at the highest level. Athletes are full-time on the programme and generally based near the team&#x27;s Manchester HQ. Athletes may also be members of professional (trade) teams, receiving additional support from the programme.
Athletes on this programme include Olympic champions Jason Kenny, Laura Trott and Philip Hindes as well as Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins.

===Olympic Senior Academy===
Riders aged typically 18 to 23 and exceptional athletes with the clear potential to become world-class performers. The programme aims to add the final technical polish, whilst building up training loads to those likely to be experienced by the senior elite athletes.

===Olympic Junior Academy===
Riders aged typically 16 to 18, who are already experienced and focused on a career in professional cycling. The programme aims to add technical experience, including experience of preparing for major (junior) championships, plus conditioning. Athletes are typically still in education and focus on intense training camps, whilst still living at home.

===Olympic Development Apprentices===
A regionally based programme aimed at finding talented young riders, typically aged 14–16 and preparing them for transition to the higher programmes.

===Paralympic Team===
Athletes competing in four disability categories, primarily in track, road-race and time-trial disciplines.

==Tour de France==
Britain has hosted stages of the Tour de France on four occasions. The 1974 Tour de France, was not particularly well received. The 1994 Tour de France also visited the UK. Due to the improved popularity of cycling, and the international achievements of British cyclists, the 2007 Tour de France and 2014 Tour de France were deemed to be a tremendous success, the latter being described by race director Christian Prudhomme, as &#x27;the best ever!&#x27;, over 4.8 million people lined the route, over a three-day period.

==British Cycling Hall of Fame==
On 17 December 2009, the names of fifty one people to be inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame were announced. The newly established hall of fame was created as part of British Cycling&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations. Further names were added in 2014 and 2016

==Research and Development==
British Cycling has an active Research and Development department for developing track bikes for upcoming Olympic games. Tony Purnell is the current Head of Technology. British Cycling released a radically original design for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The bike itself included a new wheel research by Hope Technology and a collaboration with Lotus Cars permitted British Cycling to adopt an original wide-stay design for the bike&#x27;s frame and front forks.

British Cycling has also enjoyed notable successes at previous Olympic Games, with some successes attributed to their superior bike designs. This was most notable in the 1992 Summer Olympics, where British Cycling unveiled a design later known as Lotus 108.

<text>In digital file management, copying is a file operation that creates a new file which has the same content as an existing file. Computer operating systems include file copying methods to users; operating systems with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) often providing copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop methods of file copying. Operating systems may have specialized file-copying APIs are usually able to tell the server to perform the copying locally, without sending file contents over the network, thus greatly improving performance.

== Description ==
File copying is the creation of a new copy file which has the same content as an existing file.

=== Shadow ===
There are several different technologies that use the term shadowing, but the intent of shadowing within these technologies is to provide an exact copy (or mirror of a set) of data. For shadowing to be effective, the shadow needs to exist in a separate physical location than the original data. Depending on the reasons behind the shadow operation, this location may be as close as the BIOS chip to the RAM modules, a second harddrive in the same chassis, or as far away as the other side of the globe.

== Use ==
All computer operating systems include file copying provisions in the user interface, like the command, &quot;cp&quot; in Unix and &quot;COPY&quot; in DOS; operating systems with a graphical user interface, or GUI, usually provide copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop methods of file copying.  File manager applications, too, provide an easy way of copying files.

== Implementation ==
Internally, however, while some systems have specialized application programming interfaces (APIs) for copying files (like CopyFile and CopyFileEx in Windows API), others (like Unix and DOS) fall back to simply reading the contents of the old file and writing it to the new file.

This makes little difference with local files (those on the computer&#x27;s hard drive), but provides an interesting situation when both the source and target files are located on a remote file server. Operating systems with specialized file copying APIs are usually able to tell the server to perform the copying locally, without sending file contents over the network, thus greatly improving performance. Those systems that have no comparable APIs, however, have to read the file contents over the network, and then send them back again, over the network. Sometimes, remote file copying is performed with a specialized command, like &quot;NCOPY&quot; in DOS clients for Novell NetWare. The COPY command in some versions of DR-DOS since 1992, has built-in support for this.
An even more complicated situation arises when one needs to copy files between two remote servers. The simple way is to read data from one server, and then to write the data to the second server.

<text>The Suicide Club was a secret society in San Francisco, which lasted from 1977–82. It is credited as the first modern extreme urban exploration society, and also known for anarchic group pranks. Despite its name, the club was not actually about suicide. Rather the club focused on people facing their fears and engaging in daring experiences.

==History==

The club was founded by Gary Warne and three friends: Adrienne Burk, David Warren, and Nancy Prussia. The first Suicide Club event occurred on January 2, 1977 during a winter rainstorm in San Francisco, when the four founders met at Fort Point under the Golden Gate Bridge at the top of a wall facing the Pacific Ocean. Waves from the storm were crashing on the rocks below the wall, going up the wall and then crashing on to the top of the wall, soaking the chain. &quot;The four friends took turns grabbing the chain and holding on while the freezing water hit them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;trippingly/warne&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After surviving the ordeal, the founders started the Suicide Club.

The club became public in Spring 1977 as a course that Warne taught at the Communiversity in San Francisco (part of the Free School Movement and formerly a part of San Francisco State University) and it lasted until shortly before Warne&#x27;s death in 1983.
Events generally started and ended in Warne&#x27;s used paperback bookstore, &quot;Circus of the Soul&quot;, 451 Judah St near 10th Ave, shared with &quot;San Francisco Roommate Referral Service&quot;, and next to an Eckankar Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;jK/SFrs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JL/faC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the Suicide Club was inspired by three stories written by Robert Louis Stevenson, where men who want to die belong to a club, where each evening one of them is randomly selected for death.

Warne was influenced by dadaism and surrealism. He introduced members of the group to the concept of synesthesia, and he aimed to create experiences that were fantastical and boundary-pushing. As explained by John Law, &quot;The Suicide Club could create an other-worldly, surreal environment. Getting naked on the cable cars was a surreal experience. He wanted a disconnect with &#x27;reality&#x27; and a connection with &#x27;super-reality.&#x27; &#x27;Cuz knowing you could fall off the bridge and die is a super-real feeling.&quot;

== Membership ==
The concept of membership was entirely a fiction that meant no more than participation. There was no membership list, only a mailing list. Initially, there were so-called &#x27;initiation&#x27; events, but these had no specific nature or ceremony, they were just adventures intended to bring alive the spirit of the group in each participant. In that respect, every event served as a potential initiation for any newcomers. John Law explained, &quot;The Suicide Club was a secret society, but it lacked any dogma that you had to adhere to (except secrecy).&quot; 

== Activities ==
Any person could propose any type of event, whether they had already participated in a previous event or not. Their writeup would be included in the Club&#x27;s monthly mailer, sardonically named the &quot;Nooseletter.&quot; There were five or so general categories that most events fell into:

* Street theater, Pranks (30 members riding the San Francisco cable cars naked and making post cards commemorating the event was perhaps the best known)
* Elaborate games in odd locales (cemeteries, sewer tunnels, and the financial district late at night are a few of the places used)
* Explorations—Urban and otherwise (abandoned industrial buildings, sewer and other tunnels, waterways, bridges, etc.)
* Infiltrations (the Unification Church and the American Nazi Party were the two most daring and involved)
* Sometimes, types of events were conjoined, such as the &quot;infiltration&quot; of the National Speleological Society undertaken in 1979. Club members converged on the NSS monthly confab at the Palo Alto Grotto, wanting to join. NSS members soon determined something was a bit odd about the new recruits. The two groups ended up working together on several extreme expedition caving trips, the most prominent being a two-week trip to Sótano de las Golondrinas in Central Mexico, the deepest free pit cave in the world.

== Legacy ==
The Suicide Club was probably best known at the time for its bridge climbing exploits. The Club, though secretive during its lifespan, influenced many future cultural and artistic endeavors. The Billboard Liberation Front began as a Suicide Club event hosted by Gary Warne in 1977. Author Don Herron&#x27;s Dashiell Hammett Walking Tour, the longest lived literary tour in America, began in the Suicide Club in 1977.
The Chinese New Years Treasure Hunt was created by Gary Warne and Rick Lasky in 1977 and continues (albeit in a different form). The Cacophony Society was founded by ex Suicide Clubbers in 1986. Members of the Cacophony Society organized San Francisco&#x27;s first SantaCon, adopted later and spread throughout the world by the Cacophony Society, which has itself spread throughout the world. The Burning Man Festival was influenced by Cacophony and many former Suicide Club members were crucial organizers in the early days of the desert event. The &quot;leave no trace&quot; mantra of Burning Man was borrowed from the Suicide Club and the philosophy of Warne. The urban exploration exploits of the club have inspired others, such as Julia Solis to explore on their own and document their discoveries.

<text>A telescopic sight, commonly called a scope informally, is an optical sighting device based on a refracting telescope. It is equipped with some form of a referencing pattern – known as a &quot;reticle&quot; – mounted in a focally appropriate position in its optical system to provide an accurate point of aim. Telescopic sights are used with all types of systems that require magnification in addition to reliable visual aiming, as opposed to non-magnifying iron sights, reflector (reflex) sights, holographic sights or laser sights, and are most commonly found on long-barrel firearms, particularly rifles, usually via a scope mount. Similar devices are also found on other platforms such as artillery, tanks and even aircraft. The optical components may be combined with optoelectronics to add night vision or smart device features.

==History==


The first experiments directed to give shooters optical aiming aids go back to the early 17th century. For centuries, different optical aiming aids and primitive predecessors of telescopic sights were created that had practical or performance limitations. In the late 1630s, English amateur astronomer William Gascoigne was experimenting with a Keplerian telescope and left it with the case open. Later he found that a spider had spun its web inside the case, and when he looked through the telescope he found that the web was in focus with distant objects. Gascoigne realised that he could use this principle to make a telescopic sight for use in his astronomical observations.
In 1776, Charles Willson Peale collaborated with David Rittenhouse to mount a telescope to a rifle as a sighting aid, but was unable to mount it sufficiently far forward to prevent the eyepiece impacting with the operator&#x27;s eye during recoil. In the same year, James Lind and Captain Alexander Blair described a gun which included a telescopic sight.

The first rifle sight was created in 1835 -1840. In the book &quot;The Improved American Rifle&quot;, written in 1844, British-American civil engineer John R. Chapman described a sight made by gunsmith Morgan James of Utica, New York. Chapman worked with James on the concepts and design of the Chapman-James sight. In 1855, optician William Malcolm of Syracuse, New York began producing his own telescopic sight, used an original design incorporating achromatic lenses such as those used in telescopes, and improved the windage and elevation adjustments. These Malcolm sights were between 3× and 20× magnification (possibly more). Malcolm&#x27;s sights and those made by Vermont jeweller L. M. Amidon were the standard sharpshooter equipment during the American Civil War.

Other telescopic sights of the same period were the Davidson and the Parker Hale.

An early practical refracting telescope based telescopic sight was built in 1880 by August Fiedler (of Stronsdorf, Austria), forestry commissioner of German Prince Reuss.
Later telescopic sights with extra long eye relief became available for use on handguns and scout rifles. A historic example of a long-eye relief (LER) telescopic sight is the German ZF41 which was used during World War II on Karabiner 98k rifles.

An early example of a man-portable sight for low visibility/night use is the &quot;Zielgerät&quot; (aiming device) 1229 (ZG 1229), also known by its code name &quot;Vampir&quot; (&quot;vampire&quot;). The ZG 1229 Vampir was a Generation 0 active infrared night vision device developed for the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; for the StG 44 assault rifle, intended primarily for night use. The issuing of the ZG 1229 Vampir system to the military started in 1944 and it was used on a small scale in combat from February 1945 until the final stages of World War II.

== Types ==

Telescopic sights are classified in terms of the optical magnification (i.e. &quot;power&quot;) and the objective lens diameter. For example, &quot;10×50&quot; would denote a fixed magnification factor of 10×, with a 50 mm objective lens. In general terms, larger objective lens diameters, due to their ability to gather a higher luminous flux, provide a larger exit pupil and hence provide a brighter image at the eyepiece.

Most early telescopic sights were fixed-power and were in essence specially designed viewing telescopes. Telescopic sights with variable magnifications appeared later, and were varied by manually adjusting a zoom mechanism behind the erector lenses. Variable-power sights offer more flexibility when shooting at varying distances, target sizes and light conditions, and offer a relative wide field of view at lower magnification settings. The syntax for variable sights is the following: &quot;minimal magnification – maximum magnification × objective lens&quot;, for example &quot;3-9×40&quot; means a telescopic sight with variable magnification between 3× and 9×, and a 40 mm objective lens. The ratio between the maximum and minimum magnifications of a variable-power sight is known as its &quot;zoom ratio&quot;.

Confusingly, some older telescopic sights, mainly of German or other European manufacture, have a different classification where the second part of the designation refers to light-gathering power. In these cases, a 4×81 (4× magnification) sight would be presumed to have a brighter sight picture than a 2.5×70 (2.5× magnification), but the objective lens diameter would not bear any direct relation to picture brightness, as brightness is affected also by the magnification factor.

Typically objective lenses on early sights are smaller than modern sights, in these examples the 4×81 would have an objective 36 mm diameter and the 2.5×70 should be approximately 21 mm (relative luminosity is the square of the exit pupil as measured in mm; a 36 mm objective lens diameter divided by the 4× magnification gives an exit pupil of 9 mm; 9×9=81)

===Prismatic telescopic sight===

A relatively new type of telescopic sight, called prismatic telescopic sight, prismatic sight or &quot;prism scope&quot;, replaces the image-erecting relay lenses of a traditional telescope with a roof prism design commonly found in compact binoculars, monoculars and spotting scopes. The reticle is etched onto one of the prism&#x27;s internal reflection surfaces, which allows an easy way to illuminate the reticle (from the back side of the prism) even when active illumination is turned off. Being optical telescopes, prism sights can focally compensate for a user&#x27;s astigmatism.

Prismatic sights are lighter and more compact than conventional telescopic sights, but are mostly fixed-powered in the low magnification ranges (usually 2×, 2.5×, 3× or more commonly 4×, occasionally 1× or 5× or more), suitable for shooting at short/medium distances. One of the best known examples is the battle-proven Trijicon ACOG used by the USMC, US Army, and USSOCOM, although variable-magnification prism sights do also exist, such as the ELCAN Specter DR/TR series used by the Canadian Army.

===Low-power variable optic===
Variable-zoom telescopic sights in the low magnification range (1–4×, 1–6×, 1–8×, or even 1–10×) are known as low-power variable optics or LPVOs. These telescopic sights are often equipped with built-in reticle illumination and can be dialed down to 1× magnification. As low magnifications are mostly used in close- and medium ranges, LPVOs typically have no parallax compensation (though a few rare models do) and have a completely cylindrical shape ahead of the eyepiece, since the image illuminance is often sufficient without needing an enlarged objective bell to enhance light-gathering. Most LPVOs have reticles mounted at the second focal plane, but recently first-focal plane LPVOs have become popular, especially those with high zoom ratios above 6×.

LPVOs are also informally referred to as &quot;AR scopes&quot; or &quot;carbine scopes&quot;, due to the recently increasing popularity of modern sporting rifles and compact &quot;tactical&quot;-style semi-automatic rifles used among the law enforcement, home defense and practical shooting enthusiasts crowd.

==Specifications==
===Optical parameters===
Telescopic sights are usually designed for the specific application for which they are intended. Those different designs create certain optical parameters. Those parameters are:

* Magnification – The ratio of the focal length of the objective divided by the focal length of the eyepiece gives the linear magnifying power of telescopes. A magnification factor of 10, for example, produces an image as if one were 10 times closer to the object. The amount of magnification depends upon the application the telescopic sight is designed for. Lower magnifications lead to less susceptibility to shaking. A larger magnification leads to a smaller field of view.
* Objective lens diameter – The diameter of the objective lens determines how much light can be gathered to form an image. It is usually expressed in millimeters.
* Field of view – The field of view of a telescopic sight is determined by its optical design. It is usually notated in a linear value, such as how many meters (feet) in width will be seen at , or in an angular value of how many degrees can be viewed.
* Exit pupil – Telescopic sights concentrate the light gathered by the objective into a beam, the exit pupil, whose diameter is the objective diameter divided by the magnifying power. For maximum effective light-gathering and brightest image, the exit pupil should equal the diameter of the fully dilated iris – for a youthful dark-adapted human eye about 7 mm, reducing with age. If the cone of light streaming out of the eyepiece is &quot;larger&quot; than the pupil it is going into, any light shining outside the pupil is considered &quot;wasted&quot; in terms of providing visual information.
: However, a larger exit pupil makes it easier to put the eye where it can receive the light: anywhere in the large exit pupil cone of light will do. This ease of placement helps avoid vignetting, which is a darkened or obscured view that occurs when the light path is partially blocked. And, it means that the image can be quickly found which is important when aiming at game animals that move rapidly. A narrow exit pupil telescopic sight may also be fatiguing because the instrument must be held exactly in place in front of the eyes to provide a useful image. Finally, many people in Europe use their telescopic sights at dusk, dawn and at night, when their pupils are larger. Thus the daytime exit pupil of about 3 to 4 mm is not a universally desirable standard. For comfort, ease of use, and flexibility in applications, larger telescopic sights with larger exit pupils are satisfying choices even if their capability is not fully used by day.
* Eye relief – Eye relief is the distance from the rear eyepiece lens to the exit pupil or eye point. It is the optimal distance the observer must position their eye behind the eyepiece to see a non-vignetted image. The longer the focal length of the eyepiece, the greater the eye relief. Typical telescopic sights may have eye relief ranging from to over , but telescopic sights intended for scout rifles or handguns need much longer eye relief to present a non-vignetted image. Telescopic sights with relatively long eye relief are favorable to avoid periorbital lacerations and eye injuries caused by recoil-induced collision with the metal eyepiece (colloquially known as a &quot;scope bite&quot;), especially in instances where it is difficult to keep the stock steady. Eye relief is important for eyeglasses wearers, as the presence of an eyeglass in front of the eye shortens the available physical space before colliding with the eyepiece, so a longer eye relief is necessitated.

====Optical coatings====

Because a typical telescopic sight has several optical elements with special characteristics and several air-to-glass surfaces, telescopic sight manufacturers use different types of optical coatings for technical reasons and to improve the image they produce. Lens coatings can increase light transmission, minimize reflections, repel water and grease and even protect the lens from scratches. Manufacturers often have their own designations for their lens coatings.

=====Anti-reflective=====

Anti-reflective coatings reduce light lost at every optical surface through reflection at each surface. Reducing reflection via anti-reflective coatings also reduces the amount of &quot;lost&quot; light present inside the telescopic sight which would otherwise make the image appear hazy (low contrast). A telescopic sight with good optical coatings may yield a brighter image than uncoated telescopic sights with a larger objective lens, on account of superior light transmission through the assembly. The first transparent interference-based coating &quot;Transparentbelag (T)&quot; used by Zeiss was invented in 1935 by Olexander Smakula.

A classic lens-coating material is magnesium fluoride, which reduces reflected light from 5% to 1%. Modern lens coatings consist of complex multi-layers and reflect only 0.25% or less to yield an image with maximum brightness and natural colors. Determined by the optical properties of the lenses used and intended primary use of the telescopic sight, different coatings are preferred, to optimize light transmission dictated by the human eye luminous efficiency function variance.

Maximal light transmission around wavelengths of 555 nm (green) is important for obtaining optimal photopic vision using the eye cone cells for observation in well-lit conditions. Maximal light transmission around wavelengths of 498 nm (cyan) is important for obtaining optimal scotopic vision using the eye rod cells for observation in low light conditions. These allow high-quality 21st century telescopic sights to practically achieve measured over 90% light transmission values in low light conditions.

Depending on the coating, the character of the image seen in the telescopic sight under normal daylight can either &quot;warmer&quot; or &quot;colder&quot; and appear either with higher or lower contrast. Subject to the application, the coating is also optimized for maximum color fidelity through the visible spectrum.
A common application technique is physical vapor deposition of one or more superimposed very thin anti-reflective coating layer(s) which includes evaporative deposition, making it a complex production process.

===Tube size===
The main tube of telescopic sights varies in size, material, the applied production process and surface finish. The typical outside diameters vary between and , although , 30 mm and recently 34 mm are by far the most common sizes. The internal diameter of the main tube influences the amount of space within which the relay lens group and other optical elements can be mounted, the maximum size of the erector tube, and the maximum angular ranges for elevation and windage adjustments.

Telescopic sights intended for long-range and/or low-light usage generally feature larger main tube diameters. Besides optical, spatial and attainable range of elevation and windage adjustments considerations, larger diameter main tubes offer the possibility to increase the tube walls thickness (hence a more robust sight) without sacrificing a lot of internal diameter.

==Adjustment controls==

A telescopic sight can have several manual adjustment controls in the form of control knobs or coaxial rings.
* Diopter adjustment (also called the &quot;ocular focus&quot;) on the eyepiece — meant to obtain a sharp picture of the target object and reticle.
* Elevation control – meant to adjust (or &quot;track&quot;) the vertical deviation of the optical axis. Elevation tracking to intentionally compensate for bullet drop at various ranges will only function as intended if the telescopic sight is mounted without cant.
** &quot;Zero-stop&quot; features prevent inadvertently dialing the adjustment knob &quot;below&quot; the primary zero (usually 100 meters/yards for long-range sights), or at least prevent dialing more than a couple adjustment clicks below zero. This feature is also useful on long-range sights because it allows the shooter to physically verify the elevation knob is dialed all the way down, avoiding confusion regarding the elevation status on two- or multi-revolution elevation knobs.
* Windage control – meant to adjust (or &quot;track&quot;) the horizontal deviation of the optical axis.
* Magnification control – meant to change the magnification factor by turning a coaxial wheel that is generally marked with corresponding magnification numbers.
* Reticle illumination control – meant to regulate the brightness level of assisted illumination on the reticle.
* Parallax compensation control – mean to neutralize the focal difference between the target image and the reticle.

All telescopic sights have the first three (diopter, elevation, windage) adjustment controls, and the fourth (magnification) control is offered on variable-power sights. The remaining two adjustments are optional and typically only found on higher-end models with additional features.

The windage and elevation adjustment knobs (colloquially called &quot;tracking turrets&quot;) often have internal ball detents to help accurately index their rotation, which provide a crisp tactile feedback corresponding to each graduation of turn, often accompanied by a soft but audible clicking sound. Each indexing increment is thus colloquially called a &quot;click&quot;, and the corresponding angular adjustment of the optical axis is known as the &quot;click value&quot;. The most commonly seen click values are  MOA (often expressed in approximations as &quot; inch at 100 yards&quot;) and 0.1 mil (often expressed as &quot;10 mm at 100 meters&quot;), although other click values such as  MOA,  MOA or  MOA and other mil increments are also present on the commercial and military and law enforcement sights.

Older telescopic sights often did not offer internal windage and/or elevation adjustments in the telescopic sight. In case the telescopic sight lacked internal adjustment mechanisms adjustable mounts are used (on the scope rings or the mounting rail itself) for sighting-in.

==Reticles==

Telescopic sights come with a variety of different reticles, ranging from the simple crosshairs to complex reticles designed to allow the shooter to range a target, to compensate for the bullet drop, and to adjust windage required due to crosswinds. A user can estimate the range to objects of known size, the size of objects at known distances, and even roughly compensate for both bullet drop and wind drifts at known ranges with a reticle-equipped sight.

For example, with a typical Leupold brand 16 minute of angle (MOA) duplex reticle (similar to image B) on a fixed-power telescopic sight, the distance from post to post, between the heavier lines of the reticle spanning the center of the sight picture, is approximately at , or, equivalently, approximately from the center to any post at 200 yards.

If a target of a known diameter of 16 inches fills just half of the total post-to-post distance (i.e. filling from sight center to post), then the distance to target is approximately . With a target of a diameter of 16 inches that fills the entire sight picture from post to post, the range is approximately 100 yards. Other ranges can be similarly estimated accurately in an analog fashion for known target sizes through proportionality calculations.

Holdover, for estimating vertical point of aim offset required for bullet drop compensation on level terrain, and horizontal windage offset, for estimating side to side point of aim offsets required for wind effect corrections, can similarly be compensated for through using approximations based on the wind speed, from observing flags or other objects, by a trained user through using the reticle marks. The less-commonly used holdunder, used for shooting on sloping terrain, can even be estimated by an appropriately-skilled user with a reticle-equipped sight, once both the slope of the terrain and the slant range to target are known.

There are two main types of reticle constructions: wire reticle and etched reticle. Wire reticles are the oldest type of reticles and are made out of metal wire or thread, mounted in an optically appropriate position in the telescopic sight&#x27;s tube. Etched reticles are an optic element, often a glass plate, with inked patterns etched onto it, and are mounted as an integrated part of the lightpath. When backlit through the ocular, a wire reticle will reflect incoming light and cannot present a fully opaque (black) reticle with high contrast. An etched reticle will stay fully opaque (black) if backlit.

===Patterns===
Reticle patterns can be as simple as a round dot, small cross, diamond, chevron and/or circle in the center (in some prism sights and reflex/holographic sights), or a pointed vertical bar in a &quot;T&quot;-like pattern (such as the famous &quot;German #1&quot; reticle used on the Wehrmacht ZF41 sights during the Second World War, or the SVD-pattern reticle used on the Soviet PSO-1 sights during the Cold War) that essentially imitates the front post on iron sights. However, most reticles have both horizontal and vertical lines to provide better visual references.

====Crosshairs====

The crosshair is the most rudimentary reticle, represented as a pair of smooth, perpendicularly intersecting lines in the shape of a &quot;+&quot;, and the crosshair center is used for aiming the weapon. The crosshair lines geometrically resemble the X- and Y-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system, which the shooter can use as a simple reference for rough horizontal and vertical calibrations.

Crosshair reticles typically do not have any graduated markings, and thus are unsuitable for stadiametric rangefinding. However some crosshair designs have thickened outer sections that help with aiming in poor contrast situations when the fine crosshair center cannot be seen clearly. These &quot;thin-thick&quot; crosshair reticles, known as duplex reticles, can also be used for some rough estimations if the transition point between thinner and thicker lines are at a defined distance from the center, as seen in designs such as the common 30/30 reticles (both the fine horizontal and vertical crosshair lines are 30 MOAs in length at 4× magnification before transition to thicker lines). There can be additional features such as enlarged center dot (frequently also illuminated), concentric circle (solid or broken/dashed), chevron, stadia bars, or a combination of the above, that are added to a crosshair to help with easier aiming.

====Milling reticles====
Many modern reticles are designed for (stadiametric) rangefinding purposes. Perhaps the most popular and well-known ranging reticle is the mil-dot reticle, which consists of a duplex crosshair with small dots marking each milliradian (or &quot;mil&quot;) intervals from the center. An alternative variant uses perpendicular hash lines instead of dots, and is known as the mil-hash reticle. Such graduated reticles, along with those with MOA-based increments, are collectively and unofficially called &quot;milling reticles&quot;, and have gained significant acceptance in NATO and other military and law enforcement organizations.

Mil-based reticles, being decimal in graduations, are by far more prevalent due to the ease and reliability of ranging calculations with the ubiquitous metric units, as each milliradian at each meter of distance simply corresponds to a subtension of 1 millimeter; while MOA-based reticles are more popular in civilian usage favoring imperial units (e.g. in the United States), because by coincidence 1 MOA at 100 yards (the most common sight-in distance) can be confidently rounded to 1 inch.

To allow methodological uniformity, accurate mental calculation and efficient communication between spotters and shooters in sniper teams, mil-based sights are typically matched by elevation/windage adjustments in 0.1 mil increments. There are however military and shooting sport sights that use coarser or finer reticle increments.

By means of a mathematical formula &quot;[Target size] ÷ [Number of mil intervals] × 1000 = Distance&quot;, the user can easily calculate the distance to a target, as a 1-meter object is going to be exactly 1 milliradian at a 1000-meter distance. For example, if the user sees an object known to be 1.8 meters tall as something 3 mils tall through the telescopic sight, the distance to that object will be 600 meters (1.8 ÷ 3 × 1000 = 600).

====Holdover reticles====

Some milling reticles have additional marking patterns in the bottom two quadrants, consisting of elaborate arrays of neatly spaced fine dots, &quot;+&quot; marks or hashed lines (usually at 0.2 mil or ½ MOA intervals), to provide accurate references for compensating bullet drops and wind drifts by simply aiming &quot;above&quot; (i.e. &quot;hold [the aim] over&quot; the target) and upwind of the target (i.e. deflection shooting, or &quot;Kentucky windage&quot;). This type of reticles, designed to hold the aim high and away from the target, are therefore called holdover reticles. Such aiming technique can quickly correct for ballistic deviations without needing to manually readjust the sight&#x27;s zero, thus enabling the shooter to place rapid, reliably calibrated follow-up shots.

When shooting at extended distances, the farther the target, the greater the bullet drops and wind drifts that need to be compensated. Because of this, the reference arrays of holdover reticles are typically much wider at the lower portion, shaping into an isosceles triangle/trapezium that resembles the canopy of a spruce, the ornamental tree traditionally used to make Christmas trees. Holdover reticles therefore are colloquially also known as &quot;Christmas tree reticles&quot;. Well-known examples of these reticles include GAP G2DMR, Horus TReMoR series and H58/H59, Vortex EBR-2B and Kahles AMR.

===Reticle focal plane===
Telescopic sights based on image erector lenses (used to present to the user with an upright image) have two planes of focus where a reticle can be placed: at the focal plane between the objective and the image erector lens system (the First Focal Plane (FFP)), or the focal plane between the image erector lens system and the eyepiece (the Second Focal Plane (SFP)). On fixed power telescopic sights there is no significant difference, but on variable power telescopic sights a first focal plane reticle expands and shrinks along with the rest of the image as the magnification is adjusted, while a second focal plane reticle would appear the same size and shape to the user as the target image grows and shrinks. In general, the majority of modern variable-power sights are SFP unless stated otherwise. Every European high-end telescopic sight manufacturer offers FFP reticles on variable power telescopic sights, since the optical needs of European hunters who live in jurisdictions that allow hunting at dusk, night and dawn differ from hunters who traditionally or by legislation do not hunt in low light conditions.

The main disadvantage of SFP designs comes with the use of range-finding reticles such as mil-dot. Since the proportion between the reticle and the target is dependent on selected magnification, such reticles only work properly at one magnification level, typically the highest power. Some long-range shooters and military snipers use fixed-power telescopic sights to eliminate this potential for error. Some SFP sights take advantage of this aspect by having the shooter adjust magnification until the target fits a certain way inside the reticle and then extrapolate the range based on the power adjustment. Some Leupold hunting sights with duplex reticles allow range estimation to a White-tailed deer buck by adjusting magnification until the area between the backbone and the brisket fits between the crosshairs and the top thick post of the reticle. Once that is done, the range be read from the scale printed on the magnification adjustment ring.

Although FFP designs are not susceptible to magnification-induced errors, they have their own disadvantages. It&#x27;s challenging to design a reticle that is visible through the entire range of magnification: a reticle that looks fine and crisp at 24× magnification may be very difficult to see at 6×. On the other hand, a reticle that is easy to see at 6× may be too thick at 24× to make precision shots. Shooting in low light conditions also tends to require either illumination or a bold reticle, along with lower magnification to maximize light gathering. In practice, these issues tend to significantly reduce the available magnification range on FFP sights compared to SFP, and FFP sights are much more expensive compared to SFP models of similar quality. Most high-end optics manufacturers leave the choice between a FFP or SFP mounted reticle to the customer or have sight product models with both setups.

Variable-power telescopic sights with FFP reticles have no problems with point of impact shifts. Variable-power telescopic sights with SFP reticles can have slight point-of-impact shifts through their magnification range, caused by the positioning of the reticle in the mechanical zoom mechanism in the rear part of the telescopic sight. Normally these impact shifts are insignificant, but accuracy-oriented users, who wish to use their telescopic sight trouble-free at several magnification levels, often opt for FFP reticles. Around the year 2005 Zeiss was the first high-end European telescopic sight manufacturer who brought out variable magnification military grade telescopic sight models with rear SFP mounted reticles. They get around impermissible impact shifts by laboriously hand-adjusting every military grade telescopic sight. The American high-end telescopic sight manufacturer U.S. Optics Inc. also offers variable magnification military grade telescopic sight models with SFP mounted reticles.

===Reticle illumination===

Either type of reticle can be illuminated for use in low-light or daytime conditions. With any illuminated low-light reticle, it is essential that its brightness can be adjusted. A reticle that is too bright will cause glare in the operator&#x27;s eye, interfering with their ability to see in low-light conditions. This is because the pupil of the human eye closes quickly upon receiving any source of light. Most illuminated reticles provide adjustable brightness settings to adjust the reticle precisely to the ambient light.

Illumination is usually provided by a battery-powered LED, though other electric light sources can be used. The light is projected forward through the sight, and reflects off the back surface of the reticle. Red is the most common colour used, as it least impedes the shooter&#x27;s natural night vision. This illumination method can be used to provide both daytime and low-light conditions reticle illumination.

Radioactive isotopes such as tritium can also be used as a light source to provide an illuminated reticle for low-light condition aiming. In sights such as the SUSAT or Elcan C79 Optical Sight tritium-illuminated reticles are used. The Trijicon Corporation, famous for their ACOG prism sights that are adopted by various assault infantry branches of the United States military, uses tritium in their combat and hunting-grade firearm optics. The tritium light source has to be replaced every 8–12 years, since it gradually loses brightness due to radioactive decay.

With fiber optics, ambient can be collected and directed to an illuminated daytime reticle. Fiber-optics reticles automatically interact with the ambient light level that dictates the brightness of the reticle. Trijicon uses fiber optics combined with other low-light conditions illumination methods in their AccuPoint telescopic sights and some of their ACOG sights models.

==Additional features==
===Bullet drop compensation===
Bullet drop compensation (BDC, sometimes referred alternatively as &quot;ballistic elevation&quot;) is a feature available on some telescopic sights, usually those used by more tactically oriented semi-automatic and assault rifles. The feature provides pre-determined reference markings for various distances (referred to as &quot;bullet drops&quot;) on the reticle or (much less commonly) on the elevation turret, which gives reasonably accurate estimations of potential gravitational deviation upon the bullet in flat-firing scenarios, so the shooter can proactively adjust their aim to compensate without needing to trial with missed shots or dealing with complex ballistic calculation.

The BDC feature is usually tuned only for the ballistic trajectory of a particular gun-cartridge combination with a predefined projectile weight/type, muzzle velocity and air density. Military prism sights featuring BDC reticles (e.g. the ACOG) or elevation turrets with range markings (e.g. PSO-1) are fairly common, though commercial manufacturers also offer the option to install a BDC reticle or elevation turret as long as the customer supplies the necessary ballistic data.

Since the usage of standardized ammunition is an important prerequisite to match the BDC feature to the external ballistic behaviour of the employed projectiles, telescopic sights with BDC are generally intended to assist with field-shooting at targets within varying medium to longer ranges rather than precise long range shooting. With increasing range, inevitable BDC-induced errors will occur when the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the predefined circumstances for which the BDC was calibrated. Marksmen can be trained to understand the main forces acting on the projectile and their effect on their particular gun and ammunition and the effects of external factors at longer ranges to counter these errors.

===Parallax compensation===

Parallax problems result from the target image projected from the objective not being coplanar with the reticle. If the target and the reticle are not coplanar (i.e. focal plane of the target is either in front of or behind the reticle), when the shooter&#x27;s pupil position changes (often due to small alterations in head alignment) behind the eyepiece, the target will produce a different parallax to the reticle image. This parallax difference will produce an apparent movement of the reticle &quot;floating&quot; over the target, known as the &quot;parallax shift&quot;. This optical effect causes aiming errors that can make a shooter miss a small target at a distance, due to actually aiming at a different spot from the assumed point of aim. It can also lead to unreliabilities when zeroing the gun.

To eliminate parallax-induced aiming errors, telescopic sights can be equipped with a parallax compensation mechanism which basically consists of a movable optical element that can shift the target/reticle focus back or forward into exactly the same optical plane. There are two main methods to achieve this.
* By shifting the focus of the target image. This is typically achieved by making the objective lens group of the telescopic sight adjustable so the target focus can be moved into coplanarity with a fixed reticle. These models are often called adjustable objective (AO or A/O for short) models.
:Occasionally, a side-focus design (see below) might be used with a fixed reticle within the eyepiece, onto which the second focal plane (SFP) of the target image is shifted by an adjustable erector lens group. While side focus designs are generally considered more user-friendly than AO designs, having an SFP reticle is less ideal due to it inherently not staying true to magnification changes.
* By shifting the reticle position. This is typically achieved by having a movable reticle at the front of an adjustable erector lens tube, which moves forward and back in coordination with other erector lenses to shift itself into coplanarity with the first focal plane (FFP) of the target image. Because the erector tube is adjusted via an external adjustment wheel typically located on the left side of the sight&#x27;s tube, these designs are called side focus (SF or S/F for short) or sidewheel models. This type of design is more costly and technically sophisticated to manufacture, but generally more favored over the AO designs by users due to better ergonomics, because unlike AO models (which need to be read from the top and adjusted by reaching all the way to the front of the sight) the SF turret setting can be conveniently read from behind and adjusted with minimal movement of the user&#x27;s head.
:A much less commonly seen design, used exclusively in fixed-power sights, is to have a movable SFP reticle adjusted by a coaxial wheel located just in front of the eyepiece, where the magnification adjustment wheel (which is absent in fixed-power sights) would otherwise be located. This is known as the rear focus (RF or R/F for short) design, and is also a somewhat favored alternative to AO designs in fixed-power sights due to the rear position of the adjustment wheel being nearer and more convenient to the user.

Most telescopic sights lack parallax compensation due to cost-benefit, as they can perform very acceptably without such refinement since most applications do not demand very high precision, so adding extra production cost for parallax compensation is not justified. For example, in most hunting situations, the &quot;kill zone&quot; on the game (where the vital organs are located) can be so forgivingly big that a shot hitting anywhere within the upper torso guarantees a successful kill. In these sights, the manufacturers often design for a &quot;parallax-free&quot; distance that best suits their intended usage. Typical standard parallax-free distances for hunting telescopic sights are or as most sport hunting rarely exceed .

Some long-range target and &quot;tactical-style&quot; sights without parallax compensation may be adjusted to be parallax-free at ranges up to to make them better suited for the longer ranges. Telescopic sights used by rimfire guns, shotguns and muzzleloaders that are rarely fired beyond ranges will have shorter parallax settings, commonly for rimfire sights and for shotguns and muzzleloaders. However, due to parallax effect being more pronounced at close distances (as a result of foreshortening), sights for airguns (which are commonly used at very short ranges) almost always have parallax compensation, frequently an adjustable objective design, which may adjust down to as near as .

The reason why telescopic sights intended for short range use are often equipped with parallax compensation is that at short range (and at high magnification) parallax errors become proportionally more noticeable. A typical telescopic sight objective lens has a focal length of . An optically ideal 10× sight in this example has been perfectly parallax corrected at and functions flawlessly at that distance. If the same sight is used at the target picture would be projected (1000 m / 100 m) / 100 mm = 0.1 mm behind the reticle plane. At 10× magnification the error would be 10 × 0.1 mm = 1 mm at the ocular. If the same telescopic sight was used at the target picture would be (1000 m / 10 m) / 100 mm = 1 mm projected behind the reticle plane. When 10× magnified the error would be 10 × 1 mm = 10 mm at the ocular.

==Accessories==
Typical accessories for telescopic sights are:
* Lens hood is a tubular extension mounted on the objective and/or ocular ends to shade light and reduce/eliminate glare. The lens hood mounted on the eyepiece, often called an eyecup, is often made from corrugated silicone rubber for resting against the user&#x27;s eye socket, and can also help avoid recoil-induced collisional injuries and maintain a consistent eye box. Some objective-mounted lens hoods that extend the full length over the gun barrel can improve image quality by shielding out heat-induced mirage (&quot;heat waves&quot; or aberrations resulting from a hot gun barrel).
* Lens covers or lens caps protect the objective and/or ocular lens surface against foul weather and accidental damage. There are slide-over, bikini and flip-open type covers, without or with transparent covering material.
* Optical filters such as Grey, Yellow and Polarising filters to optimize image quality in various lighting conditions.
* Anti-reflection device (ARD) or KillFlash is a usually honeycomb-mesh cover used to filter out light reflections from the objective lens, which could compromise the shooter&#x27;s position.
* Laser filters protect the operator against being dazzled/blinded by potential laser light sources. These filters are often an internal part in the assembly of lens elements.
* Scope cover, a semi-soft pouch that protects the sight from accidental collisions or the elements during transit and storage.

==Optronic technologies==
===Integrated laser rangefinder===
In 1997 Swarovski Optik introduced the LRS series telescopic sight, the first sight on the civilian market with an integrated laser rangefinder. The LRS 2-12x50 sight can measure ranges up to . The LRS sights are currently (2008) not produced anymore, but sights with similar features are commercially available from several manufacturers.

===Ballistic support devices===
An integrated ballistic computer/telescopic sight system known as BORS has been developed by the Barrett Firearms Company and became commercially available around 2007. The BORS module is in essence an electronic Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) sensor/calculator package intended for long-range sniping out to for some telescopic sight models made by Leupold and Nightforce.

To establish the appropriate elevation setting the shooter needs to enter the ammunition type into the BORS (using touch pads on the BORS console) determine the range (either mechanically or through a laser rangefinder) and crank the elevation knob on the sight until the proper range appears in the BORS display. The BORS automatically determines the air density, as well as the cant or tilt in the rifle itself, and incorporates these environmental factors into its elevation calculations.

The SAM (Shooter-supporting Attachment Module) measures and provides aiming and ballistic relevant data and displays this to the user in the ocular of the Zeiss 6–24×72 telescopic sight it is developed for. The SAM has different sensors integrated (temperature, air pressure, shooting angle) and calculates the actual ballistic compensation. All indications are displayed in the ocular.
It memorizes up to 4 different ballistics and 4 different firing tables. So it is possible to use 1 SAM with four total different loads or weapons without an additional adjustment.

===CCD and LCD technology===
Some modern scopes have a transparent display built inside the eyepiece, which allows digital data from a microprocessor to be superimposed over the optical target image to create an augmented reality. Some newer models, such as the SIG Sauer BDX series, even allow ballistic information from rangefinders, wind meters and ballistic calculators to be synchronously shared among multiple scopes.

A totally different approach recently developed, which has been applied in the ELCAN DigitalHunter series and the ATN X-Sight series, essentially uses a video camera system to digitally capture, process and display a virtual reality image of the target into a small flat panel display built inside the eyepiece, often with additional built-in rangefinder, ballistic calculator, signal filters, memory card and/or wireless access smart device interface to create a &quot;smart scope&quot; that can store/share data with other mobile devices. The ELCAN DigitalHunter, for instance, combines CCD and LCD technology with electronic ballistics compensation, automatic video capture, 4-field selectable reticles and customizable reticles.

In 2008, a DigitalHunter Day/Night Riflescope that uses infrared captured by the CCD to enhance low-light capabilities became available. It is also possible to attach infrared light sources to use such sights in total darkness, though the image quality, and overall performance is often poor. Some jurisdictions however forbid or limit the use of night vision devices for civilian use.

== Mounting ==

As very few firearms come with factory-built telescopic sights (the Steyr AUG, SAR 21 and H&amp;K G36 being exceptions), mounting a separately acquired sight to a firearm requires additional accessories. A typical sight mounting system consists of two parts, the scope rings and the scope base. The mounting generally positions the telescopic sight axis without cant over the receiver and bore center axis, to make sighting in and the use of ballistic tracking at various ranges for the user as easy as possible.

=== Scope rings ===
Because the majority of telescopic sights do not come with a built-in design for direct attachment onto something, intermediate mounting accessories are needed. Because telescopic sights universally have a round main tube, the standard mounting method is to use scope rings, which are essentially round metal pipe shoes that clamp firmly onto the telescopic sight body. Most commonly, a pair of scope rings are used, though unusually short telescopic sights occasionally do use only a single scope ring. There are also one-piece mounting accessories with two integral rings, called scope mounts, that can even offer &quot;cantilever&quot; or &quot;offset&quot; mounting (leaning off to one end, away from the center).

The scope ring size (inner diameter) must correspond closely to the outer diameter of the telescopic sight main tube, or else the telescopic sight would either be loosely mounted, or sustain compressive fatigue due to being clamped too tightly. The three most common ring sizes are:
* , offers a lower production cost compared to 30 mm main tubes, but allows for less elevation adjustment than what is possible with a 30 mm tube.
* 30 mm, the most common main tube standard today, and therefore has the widest range of mounting solutions.
* 34 mm, which has become a new standard main tube size for tactical rifle telescopic sights where more elevation is needed than with a standard 30 mm tube.

=== Scope bases ===
The scope base is the attachment interface on the rifle&#x27;s receiver, onto which the scope rings or scope mount are fixed. Early telescopic sights almost all have the rings that are fastened directly into tapped screw holes on the receiver, hence having no additional scope base other than the receiver top itself. While this is simple and cheap, it comes with the problem that any misalignment of the screw holes can cause the scope rings to exert bending stress on the telescopic sight body, and often requires the inner edges of the rings to be lapped before the telescopic sight can be safely mounted. Some scope bases, such as Leupold &amp; Stevens&#x27;s proprietary STD mounts, use socketed bases screw-fastened to the receiver and a twistlock-like interface to secure the accompanied scope rings.

An alternative design that has remained popular since the early 20th century is the dovetail rail, which is a straight metal flange with an inverted trapezoid cross-section (similar to the dovetail joint used in woodworking). When mounting a telescopic sight, dovetail-interfaced scope rings can be slid onto the rail at any desired position, and friction-fastened via set screws, or clamped firm with screw-tightened plates called &quot;grabbers&quot;. Due to the relative ease of machining a reliably straight metal bar, dovetail rails pretty much eliminated the misalignment concerns of the screw-and-hole scope rings. Most dovetail rails are made by cutting triangular grooves into the receiver top, but there are aftermarket rails that can be installed with screws into the aforementioned scope ring holes. The top of receivers featuring an integral dovetail rail can feature shape connection drillings that function as one or more recoil to prevent undesired backward and forward sliding movement.

Some manufacturers provide integral bases on many of their firearms; an example of such a firearm is the Ruger Super Redhawk revolver. The most commonly encountered mounting systems are the and the 11 mm dovetail rails (sometimes called &quot;tip-off mounts&quot;) commonly found on rimfires and air guns, the Weaver rails, the mil-spec MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail (STANAG 2324), and the NATO Accessory Rail (STANAG 4694). Ruger uses a proprietary scope base system, though adapters are available to convert the Ruger bases into other Weaver-type bases.

====Mounting rails====
European telescopic sight manufacturers often offer the option to have mounting rails underneath the sight to provide for mounting solutions that do not use scope rings or a single scope ring around the objective of the sight. These rails are an integral part of the telescopic sight body and can not be removed. The mounting rail permits the telescopic sight to be securely and tension-free mounted at the preferred height and correct distance from the shooter&#x27;s eye and on different guns.

There are several mounting rail systems offered:
* Standard prism, also known as the LM rail or 70° prism rail
* Zeiss rail, also used by Docter, Leica, Minox, Steiner-Optik and Meopta. Since 2016 also offered by Schmidt &amp; Bender under the name LMZ (Light Metal with Z-rail) on some of their hunting telescopic sights.
* Swarovski Rail (SR), also used by Kahles (a subsidiary of Swarovski)
* Schmidt &amp; Bender Convex, also marketed under the name LMC (Light Metal with Convex rail).

The traditional standard prism mounting rail system requires to have the mounting rail drilled from the side for fixture screws. The more recent proprietary systems mainly offer aesthetic advantages for people who have problems with redundant drill holes in the sight in case it is used on different guns. To avoid drilling the mounting rail, the proprietary rail mounting systems have special shape connections machined in the inside of the rail. These shape connections prevent ever showing any exterior damage from mounting work on the sight. The proprietary rail systems use matching slide-in mount fasteners to connect the telescopic sight to the gun. Some proprietary rails also offer the possibility to tilt the sight up to 1° (60 moa; 17.5 mrad) to the left or right.

Technical advantages of rail mounting systems are the reliability and robustness of such mounting solutions. Even under hard recoil there will be no play in mounts and tolerances will not change over time and hard use. The additional material due to rail on the underside of the sight&#x27;s construction also adds stiffness and robustness to the sight&#x27;s body.

====Rail interface systems====

For mounting telescopic sights and/or other accessories to guns several rail interface systems are available to provide a standardized mounting platform.

The best known rail interface system is the standardized MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail or &quot;Pic rail&quot;, also known as the STANAG 2324 rail after its adoption by NATO forces on 3 February 1995. It is named after the Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, where it was originally designed, tested and proposed for military adoption over other rail standards at the time. The Picatinny rail comprises a T-rail whose top portion has a flattened hexagonal cross-section, interspersed with evenly spaced transverse &quot;spacing slots&quot; to accommodate long horizontal screws. Telescopic sight mounting rings are mounted either by sliding them on from one end or the other; by means of a &quot;rail-grabber&quot; which is clamped to the rail with bolts, thumbscrews or levers; or onto the slots between the raised sections.

Another older, commercially available rail system is the Weaver rail, which was designed and popularized in the 1950s by William R. Weaver (1905–1975), and was the non-standardized conceptual precursor of the Picatinny rail. The main differences between the Picatinny rail and the Weaver rail are the rail dimensions and the spacing of the cross-slots, although the Picatinny rail is backward-compatible with almost all Weaver accessories (but not &quot;vice versa&quot;).

The NATO Accessory Rail (NAR), defined by the new STANAG 4694, was approved by NATO on 8 May 2009 to replace the Picatinny rail as the standard rail interface system for mounting auxiliary equipment such as telescopic sights, tactical lights, laser aiming modules, night vision devices, reflex sights, foregrips, bipods, and bayonets to small arms such as rifles and pistols. The NATO Accessory Rail is a metric upgrade of the Picatinny rail with redesigned grabber surfaces but almost identical profile and dimensions, and the two rail systems are essentially cross-compatible.

=== Mounting issues ===
Telescopic sights for use on light-recoiling firearms, such as rimfire guns, can be mounted with a single ring, and this method is not uncommon on handguns, where space is at a premium. Most telescopic sights are mounted with two rings, one in the front half of the telescopic sight and one on the back half, which provides additional strength and support. The heaviest-recoiling firearms, such as Thompson Center Arms Contender pistols in heavy-recoiling calibers, will use three rings for maximum support of the telescopic sight. Use of too few rings can result not only in the telescopic sight moving under recoil, but also excessive torque on the telescopic sight tube as the gun rolls up under recoil.

Telescopic sights on heavy-recoiling firearms and spring piston airguns (which have a heavy &quot;reverse recoil&quot; caused by the piston reaching the end of its travel) suffer from a condition called &quot;scope creep&quot;, where the inertia of the telescopic sight holds it still as the firearm recoils under it. Because of this, scope rings must be precisely fitted to the telescopic sight, and tightened very consistently to provide maximum hold without putting uneven stress on the body of the telescopic sight. Rings that are out of round, misaligned in the bases, or tightened unevenly can warp or crush the body of the telescopic sight.

Another problem is mounting a telescopic sight on a rifle where the shell is ejected out the top of the action, such as some lever action designs. Usually this results in the telescopic sight being offset to one side (to the left for right-handed people, right for left-handed) to allow the shell to clear the telescopic sight. Alternately a scout rifle-type mount can be used, which places a long-eye-relief telescopic sight forward of the action.

A firearm may not always be able to fit all aiming optics solutions, so it is wise to have a preferred aiming optics solution first reviewed by a professional.

===Adjustable mounts===
Some modern mounts also allow for adjustment, but it is generally intended to supplement the telescopic sight&#x27;s own internal adjustments in the case of needing unusually large elevation adjustments. For example, some situations require fairly extreme elevation adjustments, such as very short range shooting common with airguns, or very long-range shooting, where the bullet drop becomes very significant and thus requires more elevation compensation than the sight internal adjustment mechanism can provide. Loose manufacturing tolerances may result in base mounting holes being less than perfectly aligned with the bore.

In this case, rather than adjusting the telescopic sight to the extremes of its elevation adjustment, the telescopic sight mount can be adjusted. This allows the telescopic sight to operate near the center of its adjustment range, which puts less stress on the internal components. Some companies offer adjustable bases, while others offer tapered bases with a given amount of elevation built in (commonly listed in MOA). The adjustable bases are more flexible, but the fixed bases are far more durable, as adjustable bases may loosen and shift under recoil and can be susceptible to dirt ingress. Adjustable bases are considerably more expensive.

== Uses ==


Telescopic sights have both advantages and disadvantages relative to iron sights. Standard doctrine with iron sights is to focus the eye on the front sight and align it with the resulting blur of the target and the rear sight; most shooters have difficulty doing this, as the eye tends to be drawn to the target, blurring both sights. Gun users over 30 years of age with keen eyesight will find it harder to keep the target, front sight element and rear sight element in focus well enough for aiming purposes, as human eyes gradually lose focusing flexibility with rising age, due to presbyopia.

Telescopic sights allow the user to focus on both the crosshair and the target at the same time, as the lenses project the crosshair into the distance (50 meters or yards for rimfire sights, 100 meters or yards more for centerfire calibers). This, combined with telescopic magnification, clarifies the target and makes it stand out against the background. The main disadvantage of magnification is that the area to either side of the target is obscured by the tube of the sight. The higher the magnification, the narrower the field of view in the sight, and the more area is hidden.

Rapid fire target shooters use reflex sights, which have no magnification. This gives them the best field of view while maintaining the single focal plane of a telescopic sight. Telescopic sights are expensive and require additional training to align. Sight alignment with telescopic sights is a matter of making the field of vision circular to minimize parallax error. For maximum effective light-gathering and brightest image, the exit pupil should equal the diameter of the fully dilated iris of the human eye—about 7 mm, reducing with age.

=== Military ===



Though they had been used as early as the mid-19th century on rifled muskets, and even earlier for other tasks, it wasn&#x27;t until the 1980s when optical devices for service rifles, such as the Austrian Steyr AUG and the British SUSAT mounted on the SA80, became standard issue, military usage of telescopic sights were mostly restricted to designated marksman and snipers because of the fragility and expense of optical components. The glass lenses are prone to breakage, and environmental conditions such as condensation, precipitation, dirt, and mud obscure external lenses. The sight&#x27;s tube adds significant bulk and weight to the rifle. Snipers generally used moderate to high magnification sights with special reticles that allow them to estimate range to the target. Since the 1990s, many other armed forces have adopted optical devices for general use to infantry units, as the rate of adoption has increased, as the cost of manufacturing has decreased over the years.

Telescopic sights provide some tactical disadvantages. Snipers rely on stealth and concealment to get close to their target. A telescopic sight can hinder this because sunlight may reflect from the lens and a sniper raising his head to use a telescopic sight might reveal his position. The famous Finnish sniper Simo Häyhä preferred to use iron sights rather than telescopic sights to present less of a target. Harsh climate can also cause problems for telescopic sights as they are less rugged than iron sights. Many Finnish snipers in World War II used iron sights heavily because telescopic sights did not cope with very cold Finnish winters.

The market for military telescopic sights intended for military long-range shooting is highly competitive. Several high end optics manufacturers are constantly adapting and improving their telescopic sights to fulfill specific demands of military organizations. Two European companies that are active this field are Schmidt &amp; Bender and Zeiss/Hensoldt. American companies that are also very active in this field are Nightforce, U.S. Optics Inc. and Leupold. These high-end sighting components generally cost €1500 / $2000 or more. Typical options for military telescopic sights are reticle illumination for use under adverse light circumstances and the presentation of sight settings or ballistic relevant environmental measurements data to the operator through the sights ocular.

The former Warsaw Pact members produce military telescopic sights for their designated marksmen and developed a range finding reticle based on the height of an average human. This stadiametric rangefinder reticle was originally used in the Russian PSO-1 4×24 telescopic sight and is calibrated for ranging a 1.7-m-tall target from 200 m to 1000 m. The target base has to be lined up on the horizontal line of the range-finding scale and the target top point has to touch the upper (dotted) line of the scale without clearance. The digit under which this line up occurs determines the distance to the target. The PSO-1 basic design and stadiametric rangefinder are also found in the POSP and other telescopic sight models.

The Israeli military began widespread use of telescopic sights by ordinary infantrymen to increase hit probability (especially in dim light) and extend effective range of standard issue infantry rifles. Palestinian militants in the al Aqsa Intifada likewise found that adding an inexpensive telescopic sight to an AK-47 increased its effectiveness.

Today, several militaries issue telescopic sights to their infantry, usually compact, low-magnification sights suitable for snap-shooting. The U.S. military issues the Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG), designed to be used on the M16 rifle and M4 carbine. American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan frequently purchase their own combat optics and carry them from home. The British army fields the SA80 rifle with the SUSAT 4× optical sight as standard issue. The Canadian Forces standard C7 rifle has a 3.4× Elcan C79 optical sight. Both Austria and Australia field variants of the Austrian Steyr AUG which has built an integral 1.5× optical sight since its deployment in the late 1970s.

The German Army G36 assault rifles have a more or less built in dual combat sighting system consisting of a ZF 3×4° telescopic sight combined with an unmagnified electronic red dot sight. The dual combat sighting system weighs due to a housing made out of glass fiber reinforced polyamide. All German G36 rifles are adapted to use the Hensoldt NSA 80 II third-generation night sight, which clamps into the G36 carry handle adapter in front of the optical sight housing and mates with the rifle&#x27;s standard dual-combat sighting system.

<doc id="1052796" wikidata="Q3174968" url="?curid=1052796" title="Jean Vander Pyl">
<text>Jean Thurston Vander Pyl (October 11, 1919 – April 10, 1999) was an American voice actress. Although her career spanned many decades, she is best known as the voice of Wilma Flintstone for the Hanna-Barbera cartoon &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. In addition to Wilma Flintstone, she also provided the voices of Pebbles Flintstone; Rosie the robot maid from &quot;The Jetsons&quot;; Goldie, Lola Glamour, Nurse LaRue, and other characters in &quot;Top Cat&quot;; Winsome Witch on &quot;The Secret Squirrel Show&quot;; and Ogee on &quot;The Magilla Gorilla Show&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Vander Pyl was born in Philadelphia to John Howard and Kathleen Hale Vander Pyl. Her grandfather had come from the Netherlands. Her father was the district manager for Knit Underwear; her mother was from Tennessee. The two died within six months of each other in the early 1950s. By 1939, she was already working as a radio actress.

On radio, she was heard on such programs as &quot;The Halls of Ivy&quot; (1950–52) and on &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; during the early 1950s, where she portrayed Margaret Anderson; the role was played on television by Jane Wyatt. Her husband, Carroll G. O&#x27;Meara, was a graduate of Stanford University who worked as a copywriter at KHJ radio in the mid-1930s and later became an advertising executive.

Vander Pyl made numerous TV appearances as an actress in programs such as &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot;, and &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;. One of her final TV appearances was in the opening scene of the season-two &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode, &quot;One Good Bid Deserves a Murder&quot;. Vander Pyl also had a cameo appearance in the 1994 live-action film version of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; as Mrs. Feldspar, an elderly woman in a conga line right behind Dino.

===Voice work===
Vander Pyl was the voice of Wilma Flintstone, her best-known character, in the original &quot;Flintstones&quot; series. She told an interviewer in 1995 that she received $250 per episode for making &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, and in 1966, when the series ended, she rushed to accept $15,000 in lieu of residual payments from syndication. &quot;The Flintstones&quot; ran in syndication across the globe for decades. At the time, Vander Pyl lived in San Clemente, California, and remarked: &quot;If I got residuals, I wouldn&#x27;t live in San Clemente. I&#x27;d &quot;own&quot; San Clemente.&quot;

Most of her other voice acting work was also for the Hanna-Barbera studio, where she played her first voice role in 1958 on an episode of &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;, voicing an actress in the &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; episode, &quot;Show Biz Bear&quot;. She did additional voices, the Narrator and Southern belles and beautiful girls, on &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot;, &quot;Snagglepuss&quot;, and &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;. In 1961–62, Vander Pyl played Nurse Larue, Charlie the baby, Goldie, Lola Glamour, and additional voices on multiple episodes of &quot;Top Cat&quot; and in 1962, she did another memorable role, as Rosie, the Jetsons&#x27; robotic maid, and 23 years later in 1985 she reprised the character on the returning series.

Later, she did the voices of Maw Rugg and her daughter Floral Rugg on a rural cartoon, &quot;The Hillbilly Bears&quot; and &quot;Winsome Witch&quot;; both shows were part of &quot;The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show&quot; (1965–1967). Jean Vander Pyl was also the voice of Little Ogee on &quot;The Magilla Gorilla Show&quot;. In 1969, Vander Pyl guest-starred on the &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; episode &quot;Foul Play in Funland&quot;, playing Sarah Jenkins.

In the 1970s, she was the voice of Marge Huddles, the main character&#x27;s wife on &quot;Where&#x27;s Huddles?&quot;, in which she played a role similar to that of Wilma Flintstone and was reunited with her &quot;Flintstones&quot; cast members Alan Reed and Mel Blanc. She went on to voice Mrs. Finkerton on &quot;Inch High, Private Eye&quot;, and several female characters on &quot;Hong Kong Phooey&quot;, &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot;, and &quot;Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels&quot;.

In the 1980s and 1990s, she did voices on &quot;Mister T&quot;, &quot;Snorks&quot;, and &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot;, and also on &quot;The Flintstone Kids&quot; as Mrs. Slaghoople. She mostly reprised Wilma Flintstone on spin-off series and films such as &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The New Fred and Barney Show&quot;, &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Show&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones&quot;, &quot;I Yabba-Dabba Do!&quot;, &quot;Hollyrock-a-Bye Baby&quot;, and &quot;A Flintstones Christmas Carol&quot;.

Her last roles were again as Wilma Flintstone on &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; episode &quot;&quot; in 1995, &quot;A Flintstone Family Christmas&quot; in 1996 and on &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot; in 1997.

==Personal life==
Vander Pyl was married twice and was a widow twice over. She married Carroll G. O&#x27;Meara on March 9, 1939; together they had three children. O&#x27;Meara died on February 18, 1962, at the age of 53. She then married her second husband Roger Wells DeWitt in 1963; the couple had one son. They remained married until DeWitt&#x27;s death in 1992.

==Death==
On April 10, 1999, Vander Pyl, the last surviving original cast member of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, died of lung cancer at her home in Dana Point, California, at the age of 79. Vander Pyl was interred in Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest, California.

<text>Miguel Ricardo de Álava y Esquivel (7 July 1770 – 14 July 1843) was a Spanish General and statesman who served as Prime Minister of Spain in 1835. He was born in the Basque Country, at Vitoria-Gasteiz, in 1770. Álava holds the distinction of having been present at both Trafalgar and Waterloo, fighting against the British at the former and with them at the latter.

Alava served as a naval aide-de-camp during the time of Spain&#x27;s alliance with France but switched sides in 1808 when Napoleon invaded Spain. The Spanish Cortes appointed him commissary (military attaché) at the British Army Headquarters, and Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, who regarded him with great favour, made him one of his aides-de-camp. Before the close of the campaign, he had risen to the rank of brigadier-general. During the Waterloo Campaign in 1815, Alava was the Spanish ambassador to The Hague at the court of King William I of the Netherlands, which allowed him to attend the Duchess of Richmond&#x27;s ball and to be at Wellington&#x27;s side during the Battle of Waterloo.

==Early life==

Born into a noble family of naval tradition, he was the son of Pedro Jacinto de Álava y Navarrete and María Manuela de Esquível y Peralta. His uncle was Ignacio María de Álava, renowned officer who became the Captain general of the Navy in 1817. He married his cousin María Loreto de Arriola y Equível, a grandchild of the Marquesses of Legarda, in 1813. Between 1781 and 1790 he completed his studies at the , an institution dedicated to the education of sons of noblemen run by the Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del País.

In 1785, at age 13, he entered the Infantry Regiment of Seville n. 11 as a cadet, led at the time by his other uncle, José de Álava, reaching the rank of second lieutenant in 1787.

After his time in the infantry, and coinciding with the end of his studies, he entered the Navy in 1790, possibly attracted by the distinguished figure of his uncle, Ignacio Maria de Álava. He joined different ships from which he participated in multiple military actions by the Spanish navy against France and England: in Ceuta, the Siege of Toulon and in Italy, which, together with his well-connected family, allowed him to rapidly escalate. In 1794, he was already a frigate lieutenant.

Embarked with his uncle Ignacio in 1795 on an expedition that sought to travel around the world, he remained in South America until 1800. Álava returned to Spain following orders he had received three years earlier, but was captured by the English. He was released several months later, and in 1801 he was back in Spain. In 1802, he was posted to Cádiz, where he was promoted to lieutenant of the ship.

On his return to Cádiz in 1805, he was assigned to the fleet commanded by Admiral Gravina. After the expedition to Martinique, conceived by Napoleon as a diversionary maneuver for the Royal Navy, he intervened in the Finisterre skirmish. On 21 October he participated in the Battle of Trafalgar under the orders of Gravina aboard the &quot;Príncipe de Asturias&quot; while his uncle Ignacio captained the &quot;Santa Ana&quot;. After the fateful combat, he would be promoted once again.

==War of the Third Coalition==
Álava served first in the Navy, and had risen to be captain of a frigate when he transferred into the army, receiving corresponding rank. He was present as a Marine at the Battle of Trafalgar on board the 112-gun Santa Ana, which was the flagship of his uncle, Admiral Ignacio Álava.

==Peninsular War==
At the assembly of Bayonne in 1808, he was one of the most prominent of those who accepted the new constitution from Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain. After the national rising against French aggression, and the defeat of General Dupont at Bailen in 1808, Álava joined the national independence party, who were fighting in alliance with the British forces in the peninsula. At the end of January 1810 he was ordered to move to Portugal in order to communicate Wellington the difficult military situation in that they were against the French. During this stay a friendship between Wellington and Alava was created, to the point that the Duke had him remain as delegate of the Spanish forces in the British units. He was promoted to Brigadier by express recommendation of Wellington. He saw action in the battles of Salamanca, Vitoria, Bussaco and at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, as well as taking part in the storming of Badajoz. For his service in the Peninsula he was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

==Hundred Days==

On the restoration of Ferdinand, Álava was cast into prison, but the influence of his uncle Ethenard, the Inquisitor, and of Wellington secured his speedy release. He soon contrived to gain the favour of the King, who appointed him ambassador to The Hague in 1815. As a result of this, he was present at the Battle of Waterloo with Wellington&#x27;s staff. Álava stuck close to the Duke during the Battle. Like Wellington, and unlike many of his staff, Álava survived the battle without sustaining any wound although Wellington and his staff were in the thick of the action, with the Duke declaring to Alava: &quot;The hand of Almighty God has been upon me this day&quot;. Álava is presumed to have been the only man on the Coalition side who was present at both Waterloo and Trafalgar. 
==Politician and diplomat==

On the breaking out of the revolution of 1820, he was chosen by the province of Álava to represent it in the Cortes, where he became conspicuous in the party of the Exaltados, and in 1822 was made President. In the latter year, he fought with the militia under Francisco Ballesteros and Pablo Morillo to maintain the authority of the Cortes against the rebels. When the French invested Cádiz, Álava was commissioned by the Cortes to treat with the Duc d&#x27;Angoulême, and the negotiations resulted in the restoration of Ferdinand, who pledged himself to a liberal policy. No sooner had the King regained power, however, than he ceased to hold himself bound by his promises, and Álava found it necessary to retire first to Gibraltar and then to England. There, he was given a house on the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Hampshire estate Stratfield Saye and introduced to his bank Coutts: &quot;This is my friend, and as long as I have any money with your house, let him have it to any amount he thinks proper to draw for&quot;.

On the death of Ferdinand, he returned to Spain, and espousing the cause of Maria Christina against Don Carlos was appointed ambassador to London in 1834, and to Paris in 1835. Proposed as Prime Minister in September 1835, he rejected his nomination. After the he refused to sign the Spanish Constitution of 1837, declaring himself tired of taking new oaths, and was consequently obliged to retire to France, where he died at Barèges in 1843.

==Legacy==

Both the relationships established with high-ranking military personnel during the Peninsular War and his diplomatic work as ambassador in London and Paris gave Álava access to a wide network of prominent contacts that, in some cases, went beyond the strictly professional sphere.

Thus, in September 1813, William II of the Netherlands, at the time Prince of Orange, with whom he fought during the Napoleonic campaigns, congratulated him on his impending marriage and asked him, in a relaxed tone, to invite him to the ceremony, which Álava happily did. The French queen consort, María Amalia, wrote to him about her daughter&#x27;s future wedding and other family concerns. Nonetheless, it was the Duke of Wellington who was probably Álava&#x27;s greatest admirer and friend, who gained the Iron Duke&#x27;s trust when he served as his aide-de-camp during the fight against the French.

The novelist Ildefonso Arenas wrote a historical novel about the intervention of General Álava as Wellington&#x27;s aide-de-camp in the Battle of Waterloo, &quot;Álava en Waterloo&quot;, published in Barcelona in 2012.

Frequent and honourable mention of Álava is made in Napier&#x27;s &quot;History of the Peninsular War&quot;, and his name is often met both in lives of the Duke of Wellington and in his correspondence.

There are currently three monuments dedicated to him, namely the Monument to the Battle of Vitoria in Plaza de la Virgen Blanca and two statues, at the Diputación Foral de Álava and Museum of the Armoury, all of them in Vitoria, Spain.

<text>Kuujjuaq (; or ), formerly known as (ᓲᐃᕙᐅᖃᔾ) and by other names, is a former Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company outpost at the mouth of the Koksoak River on Ungava Bay that has become the largest northern village (Inuit community) in the Nunavik region of Quebec, Canada. It is the administrative capital of the Kativik Regional Government. Its population was 2,668 as of the 2021 census.

==Names==
Kuujjuaq was founded as Fort Good Hope in 1830 but in 1831 changed its name to Fort Chimo, an anglicization of an Inuit word , meaning &quot;Let&#x27;s shake hands&quot; and also likely to avoid confusion with Fort Good Hope operated by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) in the Northwest Territories. As this was a common greeting locals used with the HBC fur traders, they adopted it as the name of their trading post. A fictional account of this naming is given in the 1857 novel &quot;Ungava&quot; by R. M. Ballantyne, where it is taken from a girl character&#x27;s beloved dog. On 5 February 1980, the name was changed to Kuujjuaq, the Inuit name for the Koksoak River.

It has also been known informally as Koksoak and Washgagen.

==History==
The first Europeans to have contact with local Inuit were missionaries from the Moravian Church. On August 25, 1811, after a perilous trip along the coasts of Labrador and Ungava Bay, Benjamin Gottlieb Kohlmeister and George Kmoch arrived at an Inuit camp on the east shore of the Koksoak. Their aim was to scout the area for future missions and, if possible, to convert the &quot;Esquimaux&quot; to Christianity. According to their journal, they found the Inuit of the Koksoak River very interested in having a Moravian mission in the area, but after reaching a little farther than &quot;Pilgerruh&quot; (&quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Rest&quot;) on &quot;Unity&#x27;s Bay&quot; they turned back for home.

Attracted by the missionaries&#x27; praise of the location, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established a permanent station on the east shore of the Koksoak River in 1830, at a site about downstream from the present settlement. Governor Simpson&#x27;s plan was to attract trade from the Inuit of the surrounding territory as well as from the islands and ice sheets north of the bay. Its first factor was Nicol Finlayson, who sent Erland Erlandson to establish an outpost on the Wausquash; this had to be abandoned in late 1833 or early 1834. By 1833, Fort Chimo comprised seven buildings in a defensive square, principally trading in caribou hides and white fox and marten pelts. Erlandson ultimately discovered bountiful trapping far to the south in the highlands around Lake Petitsikapau; he briefly succeeded Finlayson as acting factor but was replaced when a brig delivered John McLean to his new post in 1837. Over the next four years, he succeeded in establishing an efficient riverine connection with Fort Smith on Lake Melville, but the trade at Chimo itself was so sparse that the trails they found were simply used to supply Fort Naskaupi in the rich interior. In the winter of 1840–1841, fish and game were so scarce that the agents were forced to scatter into open camps around the countryside to survive as best they could. Fort Chimo and its District of Ungava were shuttered on September 1, 1843, an HBC ship carting away the remaining men and supplies.

The fort did not reopen until 1866, when it was thought necessary to curtail the trade going to the Moravians in the area and the steamboat &quot;Labrador&quot; made resupplying the distant outpost easier. At that time, Inuit, Innu (Montagnais), and Naskapi came to trade at the post. By the 1950s, Fort Chimo included two dormitories, two warehouses, oil and salt sheds, and carpentry, cooperage, and machinist workshops. A sloop, a steamer, and outposts at the mouths of the Whale and George Rivers helped carry out the salmon catch each August, which was salted on site for use, sale, and export. The fort was usually supplied by the steamer &quot;Eric&quot;, while a smaller refrigerated steamer picked up the salmon haul.

Amid the Second World War, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) surveyed the area from amphibious aircraft out of Gander on July 12, 1941 and established the Crystal 1 weather station on the western shore of the Koksoak on October 10, 1941. It was supplied by the United States Coast Guard. An airfield was established in the summer of 1942, although it was never used for the Crimson East&#x27;s intended purpose of facilitating trans-Atlantic ferry flights. The US turned over the base to the Canadian government in 1944 and 1945, which established Naval Radio Station Chimo (call sign CFI) as part of the Canadian Supplementary Radio Activities (SUPRAD) system in 1948. Direction-finding facilities were finished and commenced operations in 1949. In 1950, it became part of the Atlantic high-frequency radio direction finding (HFDF) network after the Royal Canadian Navy and the United States Navy agreed to coordinate and standardize their detection operations. The high cost of maintaining and supplying the base, however, led to it being shuttered in late summer 1952 and its equipment and personnel moved to Frobisher Bay (now Iqaluit) on Baffin Island. The site was eventually adapted as the Kuujjuaq Airport, which now includes a Nav Canada air-traffic control facility that relays information on flights in northern Canada to Montreal.

With more Inuit settling in the area during this time to assist the base, a Catholic mission was established in 1948 and was followed by an infirmary, a school, and a weather station. The HBC outpost at Fort Chimo was closed for months of repairs in 1957 after a major fire, and the post was moved closer to the airfield in 1960. The remaining families who had still lived around the old site finally joined the larger community, establishing present-day Kuujjuaq (although it did not receive that name until 1980). The HBC store was sold to Hudson&#x27;s Bay Northern Stores in 1987.

Since 1996, police services in the Kativik region, including Kuujjuaq, are provided by the Kativik Regional Police Force (KRPF). The headquarters of the KRPF are located in Kuujjuaq.

==Geography==
Kuujjuaq lies upstream from Ungava Bay. Life in this community involves a close relationship with the river. Its tides regularly change the local landscape, while their rhythm strongly influences the traditional summer activities.

Although the tree line is very close, the boreal forest is present around Kuujjuaq. Patches of black spruce and larch stand in marshy valleys. Kuujjuaq also witnesses annual migrations of the George River caribou herd. These animals pass through the region throughout August and September.

==Climate==
Kuujjuaq has a cold subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), not far above the polar climate, but avoids that classification due to the temperate summers with daily mean temperatures of above . Winters are cold but by no means extreme for its latitude by Eastern Canadian standards.

The cause of the extreme swings is the effect of the Hudson Bay to its west freezing in November. This eliminates maritime moderation from westerlies that are prevalent in moderating summer temperatures. With Hudson Bay effectively becoming a landmass during the winter, Kuujjuaq ends up being subject to severely cold winds. With the Labrador Current to its south-east also being cold, winter moderation from the east is also eliminated. Although less snowfall is received compared to the more coastal Nain further south, the influence of the current contributes to a sizeable snow tally for a climate that cold. In June, Hudson Bay thaws, resulting in mild maritime air from the cold water moderating westerlies. In spite of this, Kuujjuaq being situated with a direct landmass link to its south for thousands of kilometres can contribute to warm southerlies reaching the settlement, bringing temperatures above . Unlike Inukjuak directly on the Hudson Bay shore, Kuujjuaq thus has a greater continental warmth impact on its summers, and consequently lies below the tree line.

During fall, Kuujjuaq&#x27;s diurnal temperature variation is at its lowest, as the maritime moderation is at its strongest. Simultaneously, the Hudson Bay freezing process begins as cold builds up over the vast landmasses surrounding the bay. This renders Kuujjuaq to commonly get ice days during October, before winter begins in November and proceeds to the end of April. Kuujjuaq has a cloudy climate, as a result of the Icelandic Low influence.

Kuujjuaq has been affected by global warming in recent decades, similar to other Arctic locations. For example, December 2010 had an average high of , while a average high was measured for March 2018. Summer has also been affected, with a average high for June 2012, and a average high during August 2014.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kuujjuaq had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Transportation==

With ocean access and two runways at the Kuujjuaq Airport, Kuujjuaq is the transportation hub of the entire Nunavik region. The Avataq cargo ship delivers cargo once a year, and a new beach port has been built north of the town. There are no roads to outside the region, but there have been proposals floated by regional and provincial officials to build a road link from the south, linking to the Trans-Taïga Road and also providing access to Schefferville.

==Education==
Kativik School Board (Kativik Ilisarniliriniq) operates two schools in the village. Pitakallak School serves students from kindergarten to grade 3, while Jaanimmarik School serves students from grade 4 to secondary 5.
The village boasts a number of hotels, restaurants, stores, arts and crafts shops and a bank. In 1988, 75% of the town&#x27;s 1,100 residents were native speakers of Inuktitut, 15% native francophones, and 10% native anglophones.

<text>Guan Moye (; born 5 March 1955), better known by the pen name Mo Yan (, ), is a Chinese novelist and short story writer. Donald Morrison of U.S. news magazine &quot;TIME&quot; referred to him as &quot;one of the most famous, oft-banned and widely pirated of all Chinese writers&quot;, and Jim Leach called him the Chinese answer to Franz Kafka or Joseph Heller. He is best known to Western readers for his 1986 novel &quot;Red Sorghum&quot;, the first two parts of which were adapted into the Golden Bear-winning film &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; (1988).

Mo won the 2005 International Nonino Prize in Italy. In 2009, he was the first recipient of the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s Newman Prize for Chinese Literature. In 2012, Mo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his work as a writer &quot;who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary&quot;.

==Early life==
Mo Yan was born in February 1955 into a peasant family in Ping&#x27;an Village, Gaomi Township, northeast of Shandong Province, the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He is the youngest of four children with two older brothers and an older sister. His family was of an upper-middle peasant class background. Mo was 11 years old when the Cultural Revolution was launched, at which time he left school to work as a farmer. In the autumn of 1973, he began work at the cotton oil processing factory. During this period, which coincided with a succession of political campaigns from the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution, his access to literature was largely limited to novels in the socialist realist style under Mao Zedong, which centred largely on the themes of class struggle and conflict.

At the close of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Mo enlisted in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), and began writing while he was still a soldier. During this post-Revolution era when he emerged as a writer, both the lyrical and epic works of Chinese literature, as well as translations of foreign authors such as William Faulkner and Gabriel García Márquez, would make an impact on his works.

In 1984, he received a literary award from the &quot;PLA Magazine&quot;, and the same year began attending the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Arts College, where he first adopted the pen name of Mo Yan. He published his first novella, &quot;A Transparent Radish,&quot; in 1984, and released &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; in 1986, launching his career as a nationally recognized novelist. In 1991, he graduated from the joint master&#x27;s program in literature by the Lu Xun School of Literature and Beijing Normal University.

==Pen name==
&quot;Mo Yan&quot; – &quot;don&#x27;t speak&quot; in Chinese – is his pen name. Mo Yan has explained on occasion that the name comes from a warning from his father and mother not to speak his mind while outside, because of China&#x27;s revolutionary political situation from the 1950s, when he grew up. It also relates to the subject matter of Mo Yan&#x27;s writings, which reinterpret Chinese political and sexual history.

In an interview with Professor David Wang, Mo Yan stated that he changed his &quot;official name&quot; to Mo Yan because he could not receive royalties under the pen name.

==Works==
Mo Yan began his career as a writer in the reform and opening up period, publishing dozens of short stories and novels in Chinese. His first published short story was &quot;Falling Rain on a Spring Night&quot;, published in September 1981.

In 1986, the five parts that formed his first novel, &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; (1987), were published serially. It is a non-chronological novel about the generations of a Shandong family between 1923 and 1976. The author deals with upheavals in Chinese history such as the Second Sino-Japanese War, the 1949 Communist Revolution, and the Cultural Revolution, but in an unconventional way; for example from the point of view of the invading Japanese soldiers.

His second novel, &quot;The Garlic Ballads&quot;, is based on a true story of when the farmers of Gaomi Township rioted against a government that would not buy its crops. &quot;The Republic of Wine&quot; is a satire around gastronomy and alcohol, which uses cannibalism as a metaphor for Chinese self-destruction, following Lu Xun. &quot;Big Breasts &amp; Wide Hips&quot; deals with female bodies, from a grandmother whose breasts are shattered by Japanese bullets, to a festival where one of the child characters, Shangguan Jintong, blesses each woman of his town by stroking her breasts. The book was controversial in China because some leftist critics objected to &quot;Big Breasts&quot;&#x27; perceived negative portrayal of Communist soldiers.

Extremely prolific, Mo Yan wrote &quot;Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out&quot; in only 42 days. He composed the more than 500,000 characters contained in the original manuscript on traditional Chinese paper using only ink and a writing brush. He prefers writing his novels by hand rather than by typing using a pinyin input method, because the latter method &quot;limits your vocabulary&quot;. &quot;Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out&quot; is a meta-fiction about the story of a landlord who is reincarnated in the form of various animals during the Chinese land reform movement. The landlord observes and satirizes Communist society, such as when he (as a donkey) forces two mules to share food with him, because &quot;[in] the age of communism ... mine is yours and yours is mine.&quot;

&quot;Pow!,&quot; Mo Yan&#x27;s first work to be translated into English after receiving the Nobel Prize, is about a young storytelling boy named Luo who was famous in his village for eating so much meat. His village is so carnivorous it is an obsession that leads to corruption. &quot;Pow!&quot; cemented his writing style as “hallucinatory realism”. Another one of his works, &quot;Frog&quot;, Yan&#x27;s latest novel published, focuses on the cause and consequences of China&#x27;s One-Child Policy. Set in a small rural Chinese town called Gaomi, the narrator Tadpole tells the story of his aunt Gugu, who once was a hero for delivering life into the world as a midwife, and now takes away life as an abortion provider. Steven Moore from the Washington Post wrote, “another display of Mo Yan’s attractively daring approach to fiction. The Nobel committee chose wisely.”

==Style==
Mo Yan&#x27;s works are epic historical novels characterized by hallucinatory realism and containing elements of black humour. His language is distinguished by his imaginative use of colour expressions. A major theme in Mo Yan&#x27;s works is the constancy of human greed and corruption, despite the influence of ideology. Using dazzling, complex, and often graphically violent images, he sets many of his stories near his hometown, Northeast Gaomi Township in Shandong province.

Mo Yan&#x27;s works are also predominantly social commentary, and he is strongly influenced by the social realism of Lu Xun and the magical realism of Gabriel García Márquez. Mo Yan says he realised that he could make &quot;[my] family, [the] people I&#x27;m familiar with, the villagers&quot; his characters after reading William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;. He satirizes the genre of socialist realism by placing workers and bureaucrats into absurd situations. In terms of traditional Chinese literature, he is deeply inspired by the folklore-based classical epic novel &quot;Water Margin&quot;. He cites &quot;Journey to the West&quot; and &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; as formative influences. Mo Yan&#x27;s writing style has also been influenced by the Six Dynasties, Chuanqi, notebook novels of the Ming and Qing Dynasties and especially by folk oral literature. His creation combines all of these inspirations into one of the most distinctive voices in world literature.

Mo Yan&#x27;s ability to convey traditionalist values inside of his mythical realism writing style in &quot;The Old Gun&quot; has allowed insight and view into the swift modernization of China. This short story by Mo Yan was an exemplary example of the &quot;Xungen movement&quot; Chinese literary movement and influenced many to turn back to traditional values. This movement portrayed the fear of loss of cultural identity due to the swift modernization of China in the 1980s. Mo Yan reads foreign authors in translation and strongly advocates the reading of world literature. At a speech to open the 2009 Frankfurt Book Fair, he discussed Goethe&#x27;s idea of &quot;world literature&quot;, stating that &quot;literature can overcome the barriers that separate countries and nations&quot;.

Mo Yan&#x27;s writing is characterised by the blurring of distinctions between &quot;past and present, dead and living, as well as good and bad&quot;. Mo Yan appears in his novels as a semi-autobiographical character who retells and modifies the author&#x27;s other stories. His female characters often fail to observe traditional gender roles, such as the mother of the Shangguan family in &quot;Big Breasts &amp; Wide Hips&quot;, who, failing to bear her husband any sons, instead is an adulterer, becoming pregnant with girls by a Swedish missionary and a Japanese soldier, among others. Male power is also portrayed cynically in &quot;Big Breasts &amp; Wide Hips&quot;, and there is only one male hero in the novel.

Mo Yan&#x27;s masterpieces have been translated into English by translator Howard Goldblatt. Goldblatt has effectively transmitted Chinese culture to target audiences by using a domestication technique augmented with foreignization.

== Controversy ==
Mo Yan was among a group of 100 artists who celebrated the 75th Anniversary of the Yan&#x27;an Talks in 2012 by hand copying the text of the talks. Upon his receipt of the Nobel Prize later that year, some Chinese writers and artists criticized him for being subservient to the Chinese government. Mo stated that he had no regrets for participating in the Yan&#x27;an Talks celebration.

Mo was also criticised by the author Salman Rushdie in 2012 after the announcement of the Nobel win, who called him a &quot;patsy of the regime&quot;, after he refused to sign a petition calling for the freedom of Liu Xiaobo, a dissident involved in campaigns to end one party rule in China and the first Chinese citizen to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010.

Mo had later suggested in a press conference in Stockholm, Sweden, that he would not join the appeal calling for the release of Liu Xiaobo from jail, although he hoped that Liu would be set free soon and had defended censorship as something equivalent to airport security checks.

<text>Haicheng () is a county-level city in central Liaoning Province, People&#x27;s Republic of China, located about southwest of the provincial capital Shenyang. It is under the administration of Anshan City, the seat of which lies to the northeast.

Haicheng has an area of and as of the 2020 census, a decreasing population of 1,067,905 inhabitants (1,232,739 in 2020).

The infamous warlord General Zhang Zuolin was born in Haicheng.

==Haicheng earthquake of 1975==

On 4 February 1975, an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale hit the city of Haicheng, which at the time had approximately 1 million residents. However, seismologists sent out warnings about this earthquake a day earlier and ordered evacuations. Because of this correct prediction, many lives were saved. This was the first successful earthquake prediction in history. Further aiding the prediction, cats and other animals are also said to have acted strangely in the days leading up to the earthquake. There are some questions as to the validity and accuracy of these reports, which are discussed in detail in the Haicheng Earthquake Prediction link below.

==Administrative divisions==
Haicheng has four subdistricts and 23 towns:

Subdistricts:
*Haizhou Subdistrict ()
*Xinghai Subdistrict ()
*Xiangtang Subdistrict ()
*Dongsi Subdistrict ()

Towns:

<text>Carl Ludvig Engel or Johann Carl Ludwig Engel (3 July 1778 – 14 May 1840) was a German architect whose most noted work can be found in Helsinki, which he helped rebuild. His works include most of the buildings around the capital&#x27;s monumental centre, the Senate Square and the buildings surrounding it. The buildings are Helsinki Cathedral, The Senate (now the Palace of the Council of State), the Helsinki City Hall, and the library and the main building of Helsinki University.

==Biography==
Carl Ludvig Engel was born in 1778 in Charlottenburg, Berlin, into a family of bricklayers. It was probably as a bricklayer apprentice that he first came in contact with his future profession as an architect. He trained at the Berlin Institute of Architecture after which he served in the Prussian building administration. The stagnation caused by Napoleon&#x27;s victory over Prussia in 1806 forced him and other architects to find work abroad. In 1808, he applied for the position as town architect of Tallinn, Estonia. He got the job and in this way came into the vicinity of St. Petersburg and its neoclassical Empire style. Finland was also close by and was soon to experience a new governmental phase as a Grand Duchy under Russian rule.

Engel started working in Tallinn in 1809, but just after a few years he was forced to move on again because of a lack of assignments. From this period in Estonia, a palace on Kohtu street 8 in Tallinn survives (today housing the Estonian Chancellor of Justice) and, possibly, Kernu manor.

From 1814 to 1815, he worked for a businessman in Turku, Finland, where he came in contact with Johan Albrecht Ehrenström, who led the project of rebuilding Helsinki. The city had just been promoted to be the new capital of the new Grand Duchy of Finland. Ehrenström was searching for a talented architect to work by his side and this meeting proved to be decisive for Carl Ludvig Engel&#x27;s future career. At this stage Engel did not however stay in Finland. In March 1815 he travelled to St. Petersburg where he got private employment.
In 1816 Engel was planning on returning to his city of birth, but at the same time Ehrenström got approval for his plan to get Engel to Helsinki. Engel&#x27;s plans for Helsinki had been shown to Czar Alexander I and in February Engel was appointed architect of the reconstruction committee for Helsinki. Engel probably thought that this would once again be a temporary job, but instead Helsinki came to be his life&#x27;s work.

In 1819–1820, when Engel&#x27;s first creations were nearing completion, his status as a kind of head architect of the Grand Duchy was established when he received more and more building assignments, both private and public, in other parts of Finland. The final confirmation came when he in 1824 was appointed head of the statewide Intendant&#x27;s Office, responsible for all key state buildings throughout the country, a position he was offered - but first declined because he still had hopes of returning to Prussia - following the resignation of its first head, the Italian-born architect Carlo Bassi, and which he retained until his death. Among his other key works from this period is Helsinki Old Church in Kamppi, completed in 1826. He designed the first theater of Helsinki, &quot;Engels Teater&quot;, in 1827, though this was a rather modest building. He was also responsible for the new city plan for Turku after most of it was wiped out by the Great Fire of Turku in 1827.

Engel died on 14 May 1840 in Helsinki.

<doc id="1052835" wikidata="Q20384" url="?curid=1052835" title="Cascia">
<text>Cascia () is a town and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of the Italian province of Perugia in a rather remote area of the mountainous southeastern corner of Umbria. It is about 21 km from Norcia on the road to Rieti in the Lazio (63 km). It is also very close to Terni.

==History==
The modern territory of Cascia was the home of the Roman settlement of &quot;Carsulae&quot;, destroyed in the 1st century BC by an earthquake. In the Middle Ages it was sacked by the Byzantines and the Lombards, and was later a fief of the Trinci family. It was occupied by Papal troops in the 15th century, and thenceforth it was a Papal town until the unification of Italy in 1860.

Cascia was the home of Saint Rita of Cascia, who was born in the nearby &quot;frazione&quot; of Roccaporena in 1381 and died there in 1457. After her canonization in 1900, a large shrine, with the Basilica of Santa Rita da Cascia, was built in Cascia, which is still an important place of pilgrimage; and the house where she was born may still be visited.

The town also is home to the frescoed 14th-century church of Sant’Antonio Abate.

<text>Nigel Heseltine (3 July 1916 – 1995) was an English author of travel books, short stories, plays, and poetry, as well as an agronomist for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

==Biography==
Heseltine was born in London in 1916, the son of composer Philip Heseltine, better known as Peter Warlock. His mother is often reported to be Philip Heseltine&#x27;s wife, Minnie Lucy Channing, an occasional model for Augustus John, nicknamed &quot;Puma&quot;. His birth was not registered until 1930. However, in his memoir &quot;Capriol for Mother&quot;, Heseltine states that his mother was a Swiss woman, a friend of Juliette Huxley. There is no record of his birth in the hospital where it allegedly took place, and for the first year of his life he was raised by foster-parents. He spent most of his childhood in Wales with Warlock&#x27;s mother and Welsh stepfather at Cefn Bryntalch, Llandyssil, and attended Shrewsbury School.

In 1937 he travelled on foot across Albania and wrote of his experience in &quot;Scarred Background&quot;. In 1938 he married Natalia Borisovna Galitzine or Galitzina, an aristocrat in Budapest. He married four more times. During World War II he was in Dublin, working as a playwright for the Olympia Theatre company of Shelagh Richards (1903–1985).

In the 1950s he was based in Rome working as an agronomist for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. During this time he travelled widely across Africa, eventually settling in Madagascar for twelve years, and then on Rodrigues as Resident Commissioner. Later he wrote several books about Africa, including &quot;From Libyan Sands to Chad&quot; (an account of crossing the Sahara) and &quot;Madagascar&quot;.

Towards the end of his career he was employed by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs of Western Australia, travelling extensively in the Outback. He retired in Perth, where he died in 1995.

<doc id="1052843" wikidata="Q3557057" url="?curid=1052843" title="Runesocesius">
<text>Runesocesius was a deity whose name appears on an inscription from the region of Évora, the Roman &quot;Ebora&quot; in modern Portugal in the area inhabited by the Celtici in Lusitania. He has generally been thought of as a Lusitanian god.

==Discovery &amp; interpretation==
At the close of the 19th Century, a Roman dedication was discovered and examined by Portuguese archaeologists near Évora. The inscription was in Latin and read &quot;SANCTRVNESOCESIOSACRVGLIC ... QVINTCINV ... BALS&quot;. In a paper submitted to the French &quot;Société des Antiquaires&quot; this was interpreted as &quot;Sancto Runeso Cesio Sacrum G. Licinius Quinctinus Balsensis&quot;: a dedication by Gaius Licinius Quinctinus of Balsa to a previously unknown god, Runesus Cesius. The name was interpreted as Celtic, with &quot;Cesius&quot; an allograph for &quot;gaesius&quot; and hence deriving from the roots &quot;*runa-&quot; and &quot;*gaiso-&quot; meaning &quot;the Mysterious One of the Javelin (or Spear)&quot;

An alternative reading, as a single word &quot;Runesocesius&quot;, was proposed by J M Blazquez-Martinez in the light of the element -eso- being a recurring one in Lusitanian names.

==Significance==
Blazquez-Martinez also observed that whereas there were large numbers of deities recorded in the Northern Lusitanian and Gallaecian regions, only the names of Endovelicus, Ataegina and Runesocesius appeared in the South, beyond the Tagus river, which some have supposed must have meant particular importance was attached to these three. The character of the Celtici and other peoples in this region and their affiliation as Lusitanian, Celtic or Tartessian/Turdetanian remain a complex issue. The name itself and its meaning remain subject to interpretation. C. Licinius Quinctinus&#x27; home in Balsa lay further South in what was, while part of the Roman province of Lusitania, outside the area of Lusitanian epigraphy and Lusitanian-Gallaecian theonyms, in the Tartessian or Turdetanian speaking part of the Iberian Peninsula. Runesocesius could therefore be seen as significant to the Lusitanians, Celtiberians or Turdetani, or to all three.

<doc id="1052848" wikidata="Q930633" url="?curid=1052848" title="Sucellus">
<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Sucellus or Sucellos () was a god shown carrying a large mallet (or hammer) and an &quot;olla&quot; (or barrel). Originally a Celtic god, his cult flourished not only among Gallo-Romans, but also to some extent among the neighbouring peoples of Raetia and Britain. He has been associated with agriculture and wine, particularly in the territory of the Aedui.

==Sculptures==

He is usually portrayed as a middle-aged bearded man wearing a wolf-skin, with a long-handled hammer, or perhaps a beer barrel suspended from a pole. His companion Nantosuelta is sometimes depicted alongside him. When together, they are accompanied by symbols associated with prosperity and domesticity.

In a well-known relief from Sarrebourg, near Metz, Nantosuelta, wearing a long gown, is standing to the left. In her left hand she holds a small house-shaped object with two circular holes and a peaked roof – perhaps a dovecote – on a long pole. Her right hand holds a patera which she is tipping onto a cylindrical altar. To the right Sucellus stands, bearded, in a tunic with a cloak over his right shoulder. He holds his mallet in his right hand and an &quot;olla&quot; in his left. Above the figures is a dedicatory inscription and below them in very low relief is a raven. This sculpture was dated by Reinach, from the form of the letters, to the end of the first century or start of the second century.

At least eleven inscriptions to Sucellus are known, mostly from Gaul. One (&quot;RIB&quot; II, 3/2422.21) is from Eboracum (modern York) in Britain.

In an inscription from Augusta Rauricorum (modern Augst), Sucellus is identified with Silvanus:

:&quot;In honor(em) / &quot;
:&quot;d(omus) d(ivinae) deo Su/&quot;
:&quot;cello Silv(ano) / &quot;
:&quot;Spart(us) l(ocus) d(atus) d(ecreto) d(ecurionum)&quot;

The syncretism of Sucellus with Silvanus can also be seen in artwork from Narbonensis.

==Roles and Duties==
In Italy, Silvanus was said to protect forests and fields. He presided over the boundaries of properties, together with a host of local silvani, three for each property. These were the silvanus of the home, the silvanus of the fields, and the silvanus of the boundaries. Silvanus also takes care of flocks, guaranteeing their fertility and protecting them from wolves, which is why he often wears the skin of a wolf. When moving north into Gaul, Silvanus was syncretically merged with Sucellus to form the conflated Sucellus-Silvanus. It was Sucellus who carried the mallet and bowl. It has been suggested that the mallet was for construction and the erection of fence-posts (establishing boundaries), but this is far from certain. Green claims that Sucellus may also relate to a chthonic deity, especially in maintain boundaries between the living and dead.

Sucellus has been frequently identified as a candidate for Gaulish Dis Pater, the Gaulish god of the underworld and progenitor of the Gauls described by Caesar.

==Etymology==

In Gaulish, the root &quot;cellos&quot; can be interpreted as &#x27;striker&#x27;, derived from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*-kel-do-s&quot; whence also come Latin &quot;per-cellere&quot; (&#x27;striker&#x27;), Greek &quot;klao&quot; (&#x27;to break&#x27;) and Lithuanian &quot;kálti&quot; (&#x27;to hammer, to forge&#x27;). The prefix &quot;su-&quot; means &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;well&#x27; and is found in many Gaulish personal names. &quot;Sucellus&quot; is therefore commonly translated as &#x27;the good striker.&#x27;

An alternate etymology is offered by Celticist Blanca María Prósper, who posits a derivative of the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*kel-&quot; ‘to protect’, i.e. &quot;*su-kel-mó(n)&quot; &quot;having a good protection&quot; or &quot;*su-kel-mṇ-&quot;, an agentive formation meaning &quot;protecting well, providing good protection&quot;, with a thematic derivative built on the oblique stem, &quot;*su-kel-mn-o-&quot; (and subsequent simplification and assimilation of the sonorant cluster and a secondary full grade of the root). Prósper suggests the name would then be comparable to the Indic personal name &quot;Suśarman-&quot;, found in Hindu mythology.

<text>Cedegolo (Camunian: ) is an Italian &quot;comune&quot; of 1,258 inhabitants in Val Camonica, province of Brescia, in Lombardy, northern Italy.

==Geography==
The village of Cedegolo is located in a narrow gorge formed by Oglio river, on its eastern side. It is crossed by two streams: the Val Gravagna, further north, and the Poia, to the south.

==History==
The comune of Cedegolo was created in 1797, at the fall of the Republic of Venice, but became a hamlet of Grevo in 1798. 
The bridge over the river Poglia (Pôya in eastern Lombard), in the center of the village, was completed in 1592.

From Cedegolo in July 1866 the fourth regiment of volunteers in Italy and the Second Battalion of bersaglieri moved to enter Austrian Trentino, through the Lake Arno.

==Main sights==
* Parish of Saint Jerome, from the early 17th century. The altar is by Pietro Ramus.
==Culture==
The skötöm are in camunian dialect nicknames, sometimes personal, elsewhere showing the characteristic features of a community. The one which characterize the people of Cedegolo is &quot;Lìca-tóncc&quot;.

Cedegolo is one of the few toponyms which in Eastern Lombard requires the determinative article: el Sedegòl.

At least until the second half of the twentieth century the young men of Cedegolo followed the tradition of &quot;tunà&quot; (literally: to shoot) or &quot;fa saltà le tòle&quot; (&quot;to make boxes jump&quot;) on the St. Jerome calendar day. It was a pretty dangerous activity involving controlled explosions of acetylene gas, prepared by mixing water with calcium carbide in a hole in the ground covered by a suitable container.

<text>Arthur Cohn (born 4 February 1927) is a Swiss film producer and a multiple Academy Award winner.

==Biography==
Cohn was born to a Jewish family, the son of Marcus Cohn, a lawyer and leader of the Swiss Zionist movement who moved to Israel in 1949 where he helped to write many of the basic laws of the new state and served as Israel’s assistant attorney-general. Cohn&#x27;s mother, Rose Cohn-Galewski, was a Jewish-German poet from Berlin. Cohn&#x27;s grandfather, Arthur Cohn, was the first chief rabbi of Basel. After completing high school, Cohn became a journalist and a reporter for Swiss Radio, covering the Middle East as well as soccer and ice hockey games. He shifted from journalist writing to script writing, but soon found his passion in film production.

Six of his films have won the Academy Award, three in the category of Best Foreign Language Film and three in the category of Best Documentary Feature. Cohn was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1992, the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture in 1995, the Humanitarian Award by the National Board of Review in 2001, the Guardian of Zion Award in 2004 as well as the UNESCO Award in 2005. He is a multiple honorary degree recipient from Boston University (1998), Yeshiva University (2001), the University of Basel (2006) and Bar-Ilan University (2021) . Cohn has received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Chicago International Film Festival (1992), the Shanghai International Film Festival (1999), as well as from the International Film Festivals in Jerusalem (1995) and Haifa (2016).

Cohn divides his time between Basel and Los Angeles and is regarded as a hands-on producer who is strongly involved with the development of the script until the final touches of the editing process. For decades he was assisted by Lillian Birnbaum (Paris) and Pierre Rothschild (Zurich). Arthur Cohn&#x27;s films have been shown at many retrospectives around the world.

His best-known fictional film is &quot;The Garden of the Finzi-Continis&quot; (1970, directed by Vittorio De Sica). He also produced films by Kevin Macdonald (&quot;One Day in September&quot;) and Walter Salles (&quot;Central Station&quot;, &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;).

<doc id="1052863" wikidata="Q3556027" url="?curid=1052863" title="Trebaruna">
<text>Trebaruna, also &quot;Treborunnis&quot; and possibly &quot;*Trebarunu&quot;, was a Lusitanian deity, probably a goddess. Trebaruna&#x27;s cult was located in the cultural area of Gallaecia and Lusitania (in the territory of modern Galicia (Spain) and Portugal).

==Names==
Her name also appears as &quot;Trebarune&quot;, &quot;Trebaronna&quot;, &quot;Trebarone&quot;, &quot;Trebaronne&quot; and &quot;Trebaroni&quot;.

Spanish historian also lists the following name attestations for the deity:

* &quot;Trebarona&quot; (Coria)
* &quot;Trebarune&quot; (Findão)
* &quot;Trebaroune&quot; (Lardosa)
* &quot;Trebarouna&quot; (Idanha-a-Nova)
* &quot;Triborunni&quot; (Cascais)
* &quot;Debaroni muceaicaeco&quot; (Aveledas)

===Etymology===
Her name could be derived from the Celtic &quot;*&quot; (&#x27;home&#x27;) and &quot;*&quot; (&#x27;secret, mystery&#x27;). Spanish philologist Antonio Tovar suggested that, like the first part of name &quot;Trebopala&quot;, this goddess could have been connected to the community. Jürgen Untermann states that the names of this deity are found in the dative case, suggesting a nominative form like &quot;*Trebaru&quot; or &quot;*Trebaro&quot;.

==Epigraphic evidence==
Tovar listed three inscriptions wherein their name is attested: one from Idanha-a-Velha, a second from Coria and the third from Lardosa.

Two small altars dedicated to this goddess were found in Portugal, one in Roman-Lusitanian Egitania (current Idanha-a-Velha) and another in Lardosa. The Tavares Proença Regional Museum in Castelo Branco now contains the altar from Lardosa. It was located in an area where the people from a Castro settlement founded a Roman-Lusitanian villa. This altar used to hold a statue of the goddess which has since been lost. Nevertheless, it still preserves this inscription:
 which translates as: &quot;Oconus, son of Oco, has fulfilled the vow to Trebaruna.&quot;

A name &quot;Trebarune&quot; (probably in the dative case) also appears on the inscription of Cabeço das Fráguas as a divinity receiving a sacrifice of a sheep.

In an inscription from Fundão in Portugal, a deity &quot;Trebarune&quot; is invoked by a Toncius Toncetani:

::&quot;Ara(m) pos(uit) Toncius Toncetani f(ilius) Icaedit(anus) milis Trebarun(a)e l(ibens) m(erito) v(otum) s(olvit)&quot;

José d&#x27;Encarnação lists an inscription from the Roman villa of Freiria (Cascais) (found on August 27, 1985), where a &quot;Triborunnis&quot; is invoked - a possible reference to this deity. The component &quot;Tribo-&quot; he interprets as cognate to PIE *&quot;treb-&quot;.

A more recent inscription from Capera is a dedicatory epigraphy by a person named Marcus Fidius to &quot;Augusta Trebaruna&quot;.

==Possible role==
José Leite de Vasconcellos suggested that &quot;Trebaruna&quot; was a war goddess, since he found a second votive altar by the same person (Toncius Toncetami), dedicated to Roman goddess Victoria.

Based on a possible etymology of her name, it seems she was a protector or protectress of property, home, and families. In the same vein, Olivares Pedreños cited positions by d&#x27;Arbois de Jubainville and Lambrino that interpret her as a protectress of the group or tribe.

==Legacy==
Following the announcement in 1895 by José Leite de Vasconcelos of the discovery of &quot;Trebaruna&quot; as a new theonym, a poem celebrating this was published which likened Trebaruna to the Roman Victoria. She has recently become, among neopagans, a goddess of battles and alliances.
The Portuguese metal-band Moonspell composed a song called &quot;Trebaruna&quot; which is a celebration of the goddess.

<text>Turiacus is a deity, presumably Lusitanian, known from a single Roman dedicatory inscription from Santo Tirso in Portugal. The inscription reads:

A dedication to Turiacus by Lucius Valerius Silvanus of the VI Roman Legion &quot;Victrix&quot;. No other inscription references the deity, but attempts have been made to link the name with proto-Celtic *&quot;torko-&quot; (Irish &quot;torc&quot; Welsh &quot;twrch&quot;) meaning a wild boar, as well as with imaginary Irish words supposedly meaning a fort or a king.

<text>Walter Moreira Salles Júnior (; ; born 12 April 1956) is a Brazilian filmmaker. A major figure of the Resumption Cinema in Brazil, Salles is widely regarded as one of the greatest Brazilian filmmakers of all time. Among his accolades, he has won three Cannes Film Festival prizes, three Venice Film Festival prizes, two British Academy Film Awards, a Golden Bear and a Golden Globe. 

He first became internationally known for his film &quot;Central Station&quot; (1998), which got two Academy Awards nominations, for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress for Fernanda Montenegro, winning a Golden Globe and a BAFTA for &quot;Best Foreign Language Film&quot; as well as the Golden Bear at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival. His subsequent works include &quot;Behind the Sun&quot; (2001), &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; (2004), &quot;Dark Water&quot; (2005) and &quot;On the Road&quot; (2012). At the 97th Academy Awards, his critically acclaimed film &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; (2024) received a rare double nomination for Best Picture and Best International Feature, the first Brazilian film to do so. 

Heir to Itaú Unibanco, with a fortune valued at US$4.5 billion (R$ billion), Salles is the third richest filmmaker in the world.

== Early life ==
Salles was born on 12 April 1956, in Rio de Janeiro. Walter Salles resided in both France and the United States throughout his youth, following his diplomat father, Walter Moreira Salles. At the age of 15, Salles returned to Brazil under the dictatorship of Emílio Garrastazu Médici. 

Salles attended the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. He originally gained experience in film through non-fiction documentaries. He worked on documentaries for ten years before switching to fictional films.

== Career ==
Salles&#x27;s first notable film was &quot;Terra Estrangeira&quot; (&quot;Foreign Land&quot;), released in Brazil in 1995. Locally, it was widely acclaimed by film critics and a minor box-office hit, and it was selected by over 40 film festivals worldwide. In 1998, he released &quot;Central Station&quot; to widespread international acclaim and two Academy Awards nominations, for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Fernanda Montenegro) and Best Foreign Language Film. Salles won a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, becoming the first Brazilian to win a Golden Globe.

In 2001, &quot;Abril Despedaçado&quot; (&quot;Behind the Sun&quot;), based on a novel by Albanian author Ismail Kadare and starring Rodrigo Santoro, was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Golden Globes. Salles said: &quot;... there was one book that resonated to the point where I couldn&#x27;t forget it. And that was &quot;Broken April&quot; by Ismail Kadare. The book was handed to me by my younger brother, who said: &#x27;If I know you well, this will touch you.&#x27; ... What really struck me was the opposition between the atavistic violence described in the book and the possibility for that violence to be overpowered by the discovery of poetry and literature and ultimately by brotherly love.&quot; Both films were produced by veteran Arthur Cohn, and had worldwide distribution.

In 2003, Salles was voted one of the 40 Best Directors in the World by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. His biggest international success has been &quot;Diarios de Motocicleta&quot; (&quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot;), a 2004 film about the life of young Ernesto Guevara, who later became known as Che Guevara. It was Salles&#x27;s first foray as director of a film in a language other than his native Portuguese (Spanish, in this case) and quickly became a box-office hit in Latin America and Europe. He won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and François Chalais Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.In 2005, Salles released his first Hollywood film, &quot;Dark Water&quot;, an adaptation of the 2002 Japanese film of the same name. He also helped to produce the Argentine picture &quot;Hermanas&quot;, which was a major success. 

In 2006, Salles wrote and directed a segment in the French film &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (French for &quot;Paris, I love you&quot;) with Daniela Thomas. The film is a collection of 18 shorter segments made by different 21 directors and set in different arrondissements of Paris. Salles&#x27; segment called &quot;Loin du 16e&quot; (literally: &quot;Far from the 16th&quot;) and took place in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. In 2007, Salles took part in a similar project called &quot;To Each His Own Cinema&quot; (French: &quot;Chacun son cinéma&quot;) in the 60th anniversary of the Cannes Film Festival. He made a three-minute segment called &quot;A 8.944 km de Cannes&quot; (English: &quot;5,557 miles from Cannes&quot;). In 2008, Salles wrote and directed the film &quot;Linha de Passe&quot; also with Daniela Thomas. It is a story about four brothers from a poor family who need to fight to follow their dreams. He was nominated for the Golden Palm and Sandra Corveloni won the Best Actress award for her role in this film in Cannes Film Festival in 2008. 

In 2012, Salles released José Rivera&#x27;s screenplay adaptation of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;, with Francis Ford Coppola producing. The film was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. In 2024, twelve years after his last feature film, Salles released &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; (&quot;Ainda Estou Aqui&quot;), based on the book of the same name by Marcelo Rubens Paiva; the film tackles the arrest and disappearance of Rubens Paiva in 1971, Marcelo&#x27;s father, during the military dictatorship in Brazil. The film was nominated for the Golden Lion at the 81st Venice International Film Festival and Best Foreign Language Film at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards, where it won the Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama category for Fernanda Torres, becoming the first Brazilian actress to win the Golden Globe for acting.

== Personal life, views and beliefs ==
In 2009, Salles signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

In December 2023, alongside 50 other filmmakers, Salles signed an open letter published in &quot;Libération&quot; demanding a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, and for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza to be established for humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages.

=== Fortune ===
As of January 5, 2025, he has an estimated net worth of $4.2 billion. He is the third richest filmmaker in the world, behind Steven Spielberg ($5.3 billion) and George Lucas ($5.2 billion).

<text>Ceto (Camunian: ) is an Italian &quot;comune&quot; in Val Camonica, province of Brescia, in Lombardy.
The village of Ceto is bounded by other communes of Braone, Breno, Capo di Ponte, Cerveno, Cevo, Cimbergo, Daone (TN), Ono San Pietro.

==History==

In February 1798 the town of Nadro was united to that of Ceto, and assumed the name of &quot;comune of Ceto and Nadro. &quot;

Between 1816 and 1859 the town was called &quot;Ceto with Nadro&quot;, while from 1859 to 1927 only &quot;Ceto&quot;. In that year he was joined Cerveno, which was linked with the name &quot;Ceto Cerveno&quot; until 1947.

<doc id="1052884" wikidata="Q2874353" url="?curid=1052884" title="Tricycle landing gear">
<text>Tricycle gear is a type of aircraft undercarriage, or &quot;landing gear&quot;, that is arranged in a tricycle fashion. The tricycle arrangement has one or more nose wheels in a single front undercarriage and two or more main wheels slightly aft of the center of gravity. Tricycle gear aircraft are the easiest for takeoff, landing and taxiing, and consequently the configuration is now the most widely used on aircraft.

==History==

Several early aircraft had primitive tricycle gear, notably very early Antoinette planes and the Curtiss Pushers of the pre-World War I Pioneer Era of aviation. Waldo Waterman&#x27;s 1929 tailless &quot;Whatsit&quot; was one of the first to have a steerable nose wheel.

In 1956, Cessna introduced sprung-steel tricycle landing gear on the Cessna 172. Their marketing department described this as &quot;Land-O-Matic&quot; to imply that these aircraft were much easier to land than tailwheel aircraft.

==Tricycle gear and taildraggers compared==
Tricycle gear is essentially the reverse of conventional landing gear or &quot;taildragger&quot;. On the ground, tricycle aircraft have a visibility advantage for the pilot as the nose of the aircraft is level, whereas the high nose of the taildragger can block the view ahead. Tricycle gear aircraft are much less liable to &#x27;nose over&#x27; as can happen if a taildragger hits a bump or has the brakes heavily applied. In a nose-over, the aircraft&#x27;s tail rises and the propeller strikes the ground, causing damage. The tricycle layout reduces the possibility of a ground loop, because the main gear lies behind the center of mass. However, tricycle aircraft can be susceptible to wheel-barrowing. The nosewheel equipped aircraft also is easier to handle on the ground in high winds due to its wing negative angle of attack. Student pilots are able to safely master nosewheel equipped aircraft more quickly.

Tricycle gear aircraft are easier to land because the attitude required to land on the main gear is the same as that required in the flare, and they are less vulnerable to crosswinds. As a result, the majority of modern aircraft are fitted with tricycle gear. Almost all jet-powered aircraft have been fitted with tricycle landing gear to prevent the blast of hot, high-speed gases from causing damage to the ground surface, in particular runways and taxiways. The few exceptions have included the Yakovlev Yak-15, the Supermarine Attacker, and prototypes such as the Heinkel He 178 that pioneered jet flight, the first four prototypes (V1 through V4) of the Messerschmitt Me 262, and the Nene powered version of the Vickers VC.1 Viking. Outside of the United States – where the tricycle undercarriage had solidly begun to take root with its aircraft firms before that nation&#x27;s World War II involvement at the end of 1941 – the Heinkel firm in World War II Germany began building airframe designs meant to use tricycle undercarriage systems from their beginnings, as early as late 1939 with the Heinkel He 280 pioneering jet fighter demonstrator series, and the unexpectedly successful Heinkel He 219 twin-engined night fighter of 1942 origin.
The taildragger configuration has its own advantages, and is arguably more suited to rougher landing strips. The tailwheel makes the plane sit naturally in a nose-up attitude when on the ground, which is useful for operations on unpaved gravel surfaces where debris could damage the propeller. The tailwheel also transmits loads to the airframe in a way much less likely to cause airframe damage when operating on rough fields. The small tailwheel is much lighter and much less vulnerable than a nosewheel. Also, a fixed-gear taildragger exhibits less interference drag and form drag in flight than a fixed-gear tricycle aircraft whose nosewheel may sit directly in the propeller&#x27;s slipstream. Tailwheels are smaller and cheaper to buy and to maintain. Most tailwheel aircraft are lower in overall height and thus may fit in lower hangars. Tailwheel aircraft are also more suitable for fitting with skis in wintertime.

<text>The Wrestling Channel (later branded as TWC, TWC Fight! and The Fight Network) was a free-to-air digital satellite television sports channel in the United Kingdom and Ireland that existed exactly 5 years, between 1 December 2003 and 1 December 2008. Initially created to be a dedicated channel to Professional wrestling, it later rebranded as &quot;TWC&quot; and &quot;TWC Fight!&quot; and incorporated both Mixed Martial Arts and Boxing. 

==History==
===Pre-launch===
The Fight Network UK began its run as The Wrestling Channel. The service was planned to launch as a full channel in March 2004, but began test-transmissions on 1 December 2003, as a temporary programming block on the now-defunct channel Friendly TV. This block aired from 7:00 to 8:00 in the daytime and evening on weekdays with repeats on weekend mornings from 9 to 11:00 am, and 6:00 pm. The block featured Wrestling promotions such as Classic Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Noah, Ring of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, which would be the first time these promotions would ever air on a UK channel. The block was supposed to only last a month, but was extended in 2004 due to positive response from viewers.

===Launch===
On 15 March 2004, the channel fully launched on Sky Channel 427. The Wrestling Channel was the first channel of its kind in the world to strictly focus its programming on professional wrestling. Alongside shows that aired on the block on Friendly TV, shows from promotions such as &quot;New Japan Pro-Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Pro-Pain-Pro Wrestling&quot; as well as vintage British wrestling from &quot;World of Sport&quot; and related ITV programming.. To promote the launch, the channel&#x27;s parent company partnered up with game publisher Acclaim Entertainment and their then-upcoming game &quot;&quot; for a competition. In July 2004, The Wrestling Channel also became the first channel to air a news/talk show dedicated to pro-wrestling - titled &quot;The Bagpipe Report&quot;.

===TWC Reloaded===
On 25 October 2004, a sister channel called TWC Reloaded was launched next to The Wrestling Channel on Sky channel 428. The channel featured action from the existing TWC library and also experimented with new shows and formats. There were plans for Reloaded to air MMA programmes but this never came to fruition.

On 24 January 2005, The Wrestling Channel&#x27;s parent company announced that the TWC Reloaded slot had been approached by a number of potential partners seeking to re-programme and develop the slot. Future output had been reduced to the minimum level of three hours per day, starting at 3:00 am, whilst a decision was taken over the content for the slot. From 1 March, a movie aired nightly on the channel and 2 days later, the channel effectively ceased as there was no longer any sporting content being transmitted. By 21 March, TWC Reloaded moved to the movie section of the Sky EPG at channel number 333 and was temporarily renamed as Movies 333 in the process, where it would fully launch as True Movies.

===Losses and revamp===
By the end of 2004, The Wrestling Channel&#x27;s parent company announced that they were running at a loss due to lower-than-expected viewing figures generating less revenue than it was costing to run the operation. They added that most promotions had been more than co-operative in allowing contract re-negotiations. To solve this, the channel signed a new deal with TNA to feature their events on a one-week delay basis. Ring of Honor was expanded into a new, exclusive two-hour weekly show, more promotions like ZERO1-MAX were added to the schedule, whilst Memphis Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Noah had even newer up-to-date weekly shows. Eventually, the channel indicated that viewer ratings had increased.

On 3 October 2005, The Wrestling Channel began to refer to itself more under its shortened name of TWC, as they began to add other fighting sports to their schedule in order to appeal to new viewers and non-Wrestling fans. During the month of November, the station added mixed martial arts and boxing programming to its existing schedule for the first time. By 1 July 2006 began broadcasting a full 24 hours a day, seven days a week without any Teleshopping. In that month, the channel began to air action movies.

===TWC Fight, purchase by The Fight Network and Closure===
The channel would eventually change its name to TWC Fight! on 4 December 2006, and added more mixed martial arts programming to their schedule, including Cage Rage Championships and King of the Cage. On 15 December 2006 TWC Fight! announced they had lost the rights to air TNA programming, which after 1 January 2007 had moved to Bravo 2.

In late 2007, Canadian based channel The Fight Network purchased TWC Fight! and in January 2008, the channel became a UK version of The Fight Network, owned by Dolphin Television. The Fight Network aired the same programming as before, just under a different name. By July 2008 the channel launched on Freesat channel 251.

After 6 years, the channel ceased transmission on 1 December 2008 at midnight and was removed from the Sky EPG a few hours later.

===Relaunch as programming block===

On 13 July 2018, it was announced that Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment Corp. would relaunch Fight Network as a programming block on Showcase by Information TV. The block would feature various sports, including live &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Challenge MMA&quot;, &quot;Abu Dhabi Grand Slam&quot;, &quot;WGP Kickboxing&quot;, &quot;Wrestling at the Chase&quot; and other programmes. Due to the way it is placed and the obscurity of the original version, Anthem are treating it as a new channel launch.

The block mainly focuses on Wrestling like its predecessor, with a mixture of other fighting sports as well.

<text>Cevo (Camunian: ) is an Italian &quot;comune&quot; in Val Camonica, province of Brescia, Lombardy, northern Italy.
Neighbouring communes are Saviore dell&#x27;Adamello and Berzo Demo. It is located near Valle Camonica near the slopes of Adamello.

==History==

On April 22, 1644, most of the town of Cevo was burned down by a fire started by lightning. On July 3, 1944, most of the houses in the town were either damaged, destroyed, or looted by the combined Wehrmacht and Italian Fascist forces, in retaliation for activities by the partisans. Six people were killed and two-thirds of the 1,200 residents were left homeless.

==Main sights==

Churches Cevo are:
* Church of St. Sixtus of the sixteenth century from earlier Romanesque building, surrounded by a small cemetery.
* Parish of San Vigilio of the sixteenth century
* Church of Sant &#x27;Antonio Abate
* La Croce del Papa (dedicated to Pope John Paul II). A 30m high cross that curves out over the valley below. The current structure replaces the wooden cross that broke in 2014, killing a 21-year-old man. The cross is also the terminus of a walking trail/pilgrimage that starts in the nearby town of Demo, passes through Andrista before climbing the hill to Cevo.

==Culture==
The scütüm are in camunian dialect nicknames, sometimes personal, elsewhere showing the characteristic features of a community. The one which characterize the people of Cevo is &quot;Barlócc&quot;.

==Twin towns==
Cevo is twinned with:

* Trezzo sull&#x27;Adda, Italy

<text>Tektology (sometimes transliterated as tectology) is a term used by Alexander Bogdanov to describe a new universal science that consisted of unifying all social, biological and physical sciences by considering them as systems of relationships and by seeking the organizational principles that underlie all systems. Tektology is now regarded as a precursor of systems theory and related aspects of synergetics. The word &quot;tectology&quot; was introduced by Ernst Haeckel, but Bogdanov used it for a different purpose.

== Overview ==
His work &quot;Tektology: Universal Organization Science&quot;, published in Russia between 1912 and 1917, anticipated many of the ideas that were popularized later by Norbert Wiener in Cybernetics and Ludwig von Bertalanffy in the General Systems Theory. There are suggestions that both Wiener and von Bertalanffy might have read the German edition of &quot;Tektology&quot; which was published in 1928.

In &quot;Sources and Precursors of Bogdanov&#x27;s Tectology&quot;, James White (1998) acknowledged the intellectual debt of Bogdanov&#x27;s work on tectology to the ideas of Ludwig Noiré. His work drew on the ideas of Noiré who in the 1870s also attempted to construct a monistic system using the principle of conservation of energy as one of its structural elements.

More recently, in her 2016 book &quot;Molecular Red: Theory for the Anthropocene&quot;, McKenzie Wark attempts to establish Bogdanov as a precursor to contemporary Anthropocene theorists, like Donna Haraway, by considering Bogdanov&#x27;s works of fiction as an extension of his general work in Tectology. In this, Wark also considers Tectology as an alternative to the Soviet state philosophy of dialectical materialism, which may help in explaining Lenin&#x27;s vehement opposition to Tectology in his own &quot;Materialism and Empirio-Criticism&quot;.

== Topics in tectology ==
According to Bogdanov &quot;the aim of Tectology is the systematization of organized experience&quot;, through the identification of universal organizational principles: &quot;all things are organizational, all &quot;complexes&quot; could only be understood through their organizational character.&quot; Bogdanov considered that any complex should correspond to its environment and adapt to it. A stable and organized complex is greater than the sum of its parts. In Tectology, the term &#x27;stability&#x27; refers not to a dynamic stability, but to the possibility of preserving the complex in the given environment. A &#x27;complex&#x27; is not identical to a &#x27;complicated, a hard-to-comprehend, large .

In Tectology, Bogdanov made the first &#x27;modern&#x27; attempt to formulate the most general laws of organization. Tectology addressed issues such as holistic, emergent phenomena and systemic development. Tectology as a constructive science built elements into a functional entity using general laws of organization.

According to his &quot;empirio-monistic&quot; principle (1899), he does not recognize differences between observation and perception and thus creates the beginning of a general empirical, trans-disciplinary science of physical organization, as an expedient unity and precursor of Systems Theory and Holism.

The &quot;whole&quot; in Tectology, and the laws of its integrity, were derived from biological rather than the physicalistic view of the world. Regarding the three scientific cycles which comprise the basis of Tectology (mathematical, physico-biological, and natural-philosophical), it is from the physico-biological cycle that the central concepts have been taken and universalized.

The starting point in Bogdanov&#x27;s &quot;Universal Science of Organization - Tectology&quot; (1913-1922) was that nature has a general, organized character, &quot;with one set of laws of organization for all objects&quot;. This set of laws also organizes the internal development of the complex units, as implied by Simona Poustilnik&#x27;s &quot;macro-paradigm&quot;, which induces synergistic consequences into an adaptive assembling phenomenon (1995). Bogdanov&#x27;s visionary view of nature was one of an &#x27;organization&#x27; with interconnected systems. 

==Works==
Alexander Bogdanov wrote several works about Tectology:

<doc id="1052903" wikidata="Q4409158" url="?curid=1052903" title="South Park Republican">
<text>A &quot;South Park&quot; Republican is a type of Republican who holds center-right political beliefs influenced by the popular American animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;. Many may hold generally conservative views on fiscal issues, but more moderate or liberal in regard to social issues such as LGBT rights and abortion. The term is arguably a contemporary variation on the older classical liberal, with an overlay of pop culture aesthetic. The term was coined by Andrew Sullivan in 2001.

== Political views of Trey Parker and Matt Stone ==
Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the two creators of &quot;South Park&quot;, have been vocal opponents of both the Republican and Democratic parties. At an online forum (South Park Studios Chat, May 10, 2001), Parker and Stone wrote that they hated both conservatives and liberals, with Stone famously stating &quot;I hate conservatives but I really fucking hate liberals&quot;. In 2006, Trey Parker commented in an interview that they were aware of the concept of the &quot;South Park&quot; Republican and they both felt that they were &quot;just pretty middle-ground guys&quot;.

Parker and Stone are often speculated to be libertarians. In an interview documented by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2004, they both contended that the libertarian label which had been applied to them in recent years was not entirely appropriate. During an appearance on &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot;, Stone said that they &quot;just play devil&#x27;s advocate all the time&quot;, personifying both sides of the argument and taking &quot;a little funny way out&quot; to differ from the Hollywood liberals in the acting community.

At a 2006 conference in Amsterdam organized by &quot;Reason&quot;, Parker and Stone stated that if one had to put a label on them, it would be libertarian.

<text>Uga ( ) is the official live mascot of the University of Georgia Bulldogs. Since Uga I&#x27;s introduction in 1956, every Uga has been owned by the Sonny Seiler family of Savannah, Georgia.

==Background==
The Uga mascots started in 1956, when Seiler brought a bulldog that was given to him as a wedding present, by Frank Heard, at Georgia Bulldogs&#x27; first home game of the season. Afterwards, head coach Wally Butts asked his permission to use the dog as Georgia&#x27;s mascot, and around the same time a University of Georgia Law School fellow student and friend Billy Young suggested that he name it Uga, a play on the common &quot;UGA&quot; abbreviation of the University of Georgia. Since then, every official Uga has been owned by and lived with the Seiler family in Savannah, Georgia. They also transport him to and from the events he attends as mascot.

Traditionally, the incumbent Uga is present at every Georgia Bulldogs home football game, many away games, and other university-related functions and sports events, and usually wears a spiked collar and red jersey with varsity letter. The red jersey is Uga&#x27;s typical &quot;uniform,&quot; though he wears a green jersey on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. Other special appearances include 1982, when Uga IV attended the Heisman Trophy ceremony in New York City wearing a tuxedo, and 2007, when Uga VI wore a black jersey for the &quot;blackout&quot; game against Auburn University. Uga&#x27;s jersey is made from the same fabric as the players&#x27; official game jerseys, and he even has an official student identification card. He has a custom-built air-conditioned dog house at Sanford Stadium and typically sits on or near bags of ice at games, as bulldogs are susceptible to heat stroke (a problem in the humid southeastern United States).

To date, eleven dogs have carried the name &quot;Uga&quot;. Each has been descended from the original Uga, and has frequently been the son of the predecessor.

Deceased Ugas are interred in a mausoleum near the main entrance at the southwest corner of Sanford Stadium. A bronze plaque describing each dog&#x27;s tenure and including an epitaph is engraved in front of each tomb. The tomb&#x27;s original location was at the east end of Sanford Stadium, and Ugas I and II were originally buried there. Prior to its 1981 enclosure, the university moved the Uga graves to the west end. When the west end zone was enclosed in 1992, the Ugas were entombed in their current resting place, and a bronze, life-sized statue representing Uga was placed in front of the mausoleum. On game days, fans bring flowers and gifts to leave at the tombs of the past bulldogs who served as their team&#x27;s mascot.

Several Ugas have retired as part of pre-game ceremonies, during which there is a &quot;passing of the collar&quot; and the new Uga begins his reign. During these ceremonies, the fans typically chant &quot;Damn good dog,&quot; a tradition dating back to the original Uga.

==Uga as part of the team==
Uga has been considered a part of the football team since the day Uga I, Sonny, was asked to be the official mascot. Uga has his own custom made jersey to wear at every game day that is made with the same materials as the football players&#x27; jerseys. His jersey also has his name stitched on the back. When Uga gets a new jersey, or another Uga is named the official mascot, the old jerseys are destroyed.

Uga officially becomes a part of the team through a ceremony on the football field before a game. The head coach will officially welcome the next Uga by placing the well-known spiked collar on the bulldog. Uga XI, the current Uga, received his collar on April 15, 2023, before the 2023 Spring Game.

In addition, Uga receives a varsity letter in the form of a plaque for his endless support for the athletes. The plaque is identical to those received by the athletes at the end of each season.

Uga travels with the team and stays in the same hotel as the players, in his own room with the Seilers. Uga X attended the Rose Bowl in 2018, becoming the first ever playoff Uga. He flew to Pasadena, California, with the team, attending all team events, supporting the football team through their playoff run in the 2017–2018 season.

==Genealogy of Uga namesakes==

*Uga I (&quot;Hood&#x27;s Ole Dan&quot;, 1956–66) – Started the Uga mascot line. Was a grandson of a bulldog that accompanied the Georgia football team to its 1943 Rose Bowl victory. Won one Southeastern Conference football title (1959) and one Orange Bowl (1960). Sanford Stadium Epitaph: Damn Good Dog
*Uga II (&quot;Ole Dan&#x27;s Uga&quot;, 1966–72) – Won two SEC football titles (1966, 1968), one Cotton Bowl (1966) and one national title (1968 Litkenhous poll). Epitaph: Not Bad for a Dog
*Uga III (&quot;Seiler&#x27;s Uga Three&quot;, 1972–81) – Won two SEC titles (1976, 1980), one Peach Bowl (1973), one Sugar Bowl (1981) and one consensus national title (1980). Epitaph: How &#x27;Bout This Dawg
*Uga IV (&quot;Seiler&#x27;s Uga Four&quot;, 1981–90) – Won two SEC championships (1981, 1982) and one Cotton Bowl (1984). He was the first live mascot ever invited to a Heisman trophy presentation in 1982, and accompanied Herschel Walker to the Downtown Athletic Club wearing a custom-made black collar and tie. Epitaph: The Dog of the Decade
*Uga V (&quot;Uga IV&#x27;s Magillicuddy II&quot;, 1990–99) – Won one Peach Bowl (1998). He was named in honor of Dan Magill, longtime Georgia tennis coach and Sports Information Director, and in honor of Magillicuddy I, who served as interim mascot for one game after Uga IV&#x27;s death. He portrayed his father, Uga IV, in the motion picture &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;, and was pictured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1997. In 1996, he famously lunged at Auburn wide receiver Robert Baker after he scored a touchdown. The pictures and video of this incident have been widely circulated as a symbol of the Deep South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry. Epitaph: &quot;Nation&#x27;s Best College Mascot&quot; – &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; 
*Uga VI (&quot;Uga V&#x27;s Whatchagot Loran&quot;, 1999–2008) – Won two SEC championships (2002, 2005), two Sugar Bowls (2003, 2008), one Peach Bowl (2006) and had more than 20 victories over ranked opponents, the most of any Uga to date. He was named in honor of Loran Smith, longtime Georgia football sideline reporter and past president of the Georgia Bulldog Club (During football games, when former radio announcer Larry Munson called on Smith for a sideline report, he would say &quot;Loran, whadda ya got?&quot;). He was the largest at 65 pounds, and held the best winning percentage at time of retirement; he also held the most wins as well. He died of congestive heart failure on June 27, 2008. Epitaph: A Big Dog For A Big Job, And He Handled It Well
*Uga VII (&quot;Loran&#x27;s Best&quot;, 2008–09) – Also named in honor of Loran Smith. His tenure ended abruptly near the end of his second season when he died of heart failure on November 19, 2009. Epitaph: Gone Too Soon
*Uga VIII (&quot;Big Bad Bruce&quot;, 2010–11) – Named in honor of University of Georgia veterinarian Dr. Bruce Hollett. He was introduced at the October 16, 2010, homecoming game against Vanderbilt. On January 7, 2011, UGA officials announced that Uga VIII had been diagnosed with canine lymphoma, which led to his death on February 4, 2011. Epitaph: He Never Had A Chance
*Uga IX (&quot;Russ&quot;, 2012–15; interim mascot, 2009–12) – After the death of Uga VII, his five-year-old half-brother, Russ, was selected as interim mascot for the final two games of the 2009 season. He continued as interim mascot for the first six games of the 2010 season and participated in a &quot;passing of the collar&quot; ceremony for Uga VIII before the Homecoming game against Vanderbilt. Less than three months later, Russ was once again called on to serve at the 2010 AutoZone Liberty Bowl, due to a then-unspecified illness suffered by Uga VIII (later revealed to be canine lymphoma). After the death of Uga VIII five weeks later, it was announced that Russ would continue as interim mascot indefinitely. Russ served during the entire 2011 season as interim mascot, and UGA Director of Athletics Greg McGarity announced on August 30, 2012, that Russ received a &quot;battlefield promotion&quot; and would assume the title of Uga IX. The official ceremony was conducted prior to the Georgia vs. Florida Atlantic home football game on Saturday, September 15, 2012. Uga IX died of natural causes on December 21, 2015, at 11 years-old. He was the only official Uga mascot to date that had visible brown markings, as other members were selected for an all-white hair coat or had markings that were hidden from view by the jersey. Epitaph: He endeared himself to the Georgia people. His dedication to duty when called upon was exemplary.
*Uga X (&quot;Que&quot;, 2015–23) – Won two SEC championships (2017, 2022), one Rose Bowl (2018), one Sugar Bowl (2020), two Peach Bowls (2021, 2022), one Orange Bowl (2021) and two CFP National Championships (2022, 2023). A grandson of Uga IX, he was introduced at the November 21, 2015, game against Georgia Southern. At his retirement, he was the winningest Uga by total number of wins and percentage. In 2022, Uga X, and by extension all Uga&#x27;s, were inducted in the Mascot Hall of Fame. Uga X died on January 23, 2024, at the age of 10. Epitaph: &#x27;Nuff Said
*Uga XI (&quot;Boom,&quot; 2023–present) – Won one SEC championship (2024) and one Orange Bowl (2023). The collar was passed to Uga XI prior to the G-Day public spring scrimmage on April 15, 2023.

===Temporary mascots===
Since 1956, four other bulldogs (three of which were from the Uga family line) have served as temporary sideline mascots when the current Uga was not available. The bulldog later known as Uga IX served two terms as an interim mascot before officially becoming Uga IX.
*Bugga Lou – 1971 – This unrelated, female, brown-and-white bulldog filled in for an ailing Uga II at the South Carolina and Florida games during the 1971 season.
*Argos/Knute – 1972 – The dog&#x27;s given name at birth was Argos, but he had been given to another family member and had his name changed to Knute before he was called into service. Knute served as interim mascot for the first game of the 1972 season against Baylor, since Uga II had died and the future Uga III wasn&#x27;t deemed to be mature enough to serve yet. Uga III was introduced for the second game of the 1972 season against North Carolina.
*Otto – 1986 – Otto, the older brother of Uga IV, filled in for him during four games in the 1986 season after Uga IV injured his left knee jumping off a hotel bed prior to a game against Vanderbilt. Otto compiled a 3–1 record and also served as co-mascot for the Georgia Tech game that year with Uga IV. Legendary former coach Vince Dooley has said that Otto was his favorite Georgia mascot, &quot;because he came off the bench and got the job done.&quot;
*Magillicuddy I – 1989 – He filled in for an ailing Uga IV, his brother, at the 1989 Peach Bowl. Uga IV died after the end of the 1989 season, but Magillicuddy was considered to be too old to be named the new mascot.

==Georgia mascot history prior to Uga==
Georgia officially claims the following animals as live mascots prior to the introduction of the Uga line in 1956.
*&quot;Sir William&quot; 1892 – A goat. Appeared at the Georgia–Mercer game on January 30, 1892 and first Auburn–Georgia game on February 22, 1892. It was dressed in a black coat with the letters &quot;U.G.&quot; in red on each side.
*Trilby – 1894 – Georgia&#x27;s first canine mascot, Trilby was a solid white female Bull Terrier owned by student Charles Black Sr. of Atlanta. After Trilby&#x27;s 1894 reign, there is no official mascot acknowledged by the university for 50 years. According to the 2011 Georgia football media guide, &quot;... chaos developed in the mascot department at the University. Many games had several, depending on which alumnus got his dog to the game first.&quot;
*Mr. Angel – 1944–46 – Mr. Angel was a brindle-and-white English Bulldog owned by Warren Coleman, a physician from Eastman, Georgia. 
*Butch and Tuffy – 1947–48 (both), 1948–51 (only Butch) – Butch and Tuffy were brindled English Bulldogs owned by Mabry Smith of Warner Robins, Georgia. Smith agreed to loan the dogs to the University for use as mascots after bringing them to the 1946 Georgia Tech game (which was the final game of the 1946 regular season). Tuffy died of a heart attack after the 1948 Kentucky game, but Butch served by himself until he was shot and killed by a Warner Robins policeman while roaming the streets in the summer of 1951 after escaping from his pen.
*Mike – 1951–55 – Mike was a brindled English Bulldog owned by C.L. Fain, and during his time as mascot, he lived in the campus field house. Mike died due to natural causes in 1955. A bronze likeness of Mike stands outside of Memorial Hall on Georgia&#x27;s campus near Sanford Stadium.

== Criticism ==
 The University of Georgia has faced criticism for perpetuating a problematic emphasis on purebred lineage, raising concerns about ethical considerations in the breeding of bulldogs. Detractors argue that the insistence on maintaining a specific bloodline for Uga has led to potential health issues for the mascot, such as respiratory problems and joint disorders commonly associated with inbreeding. Many organizations, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), have argued that &quot;the public doesn&#x27;t want to see animals used as props or forced to perform.&quot; 

Additionally, English bulldogs have developed myriad health conditions due to inbreeding — including breathing difficulties, hip dysplasia and heart disorders - which many descendants of Uga have died from. Critics also contend that the emphasis on pedigree overlooks the many capable and healthy bulldogs available for mascot duties, promoting a narrow view of canine excellence. This approach raises questions about the ethical treatment of animals and the necessity of prioritizing pedigree over the well-being of the mascot.

<text>Syed Ali Shah Geelani (29 September 1929 – 1 September 2021) was a Kashmiri separatist leader and politician in the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. Known for his pro-Pakistan stance, he was a key figure in the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, an alliance of separatist groups. A former Indian intelligence officer referred to him as the &#x27;father of the Kashmiri jihad.&#x27;

Geelani helped found the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) in 1993 and served as its chairman from 1998 to 2000. In 2003, he formed his own faction of which he was later elected as the lifetime chairman. He founded the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat party in 2004, which became the leading organisation in the separate &quot;Geelani faction&quot; of the Hurriyat Conference. Geelani served as its chairman until he quit the position in March 2018, though remaining the chairman of his faction of APHC. He later quit from his faction in 2020.

He was a member of Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir since 1953, and was regarded as one of its most significant leaders. Geelani was also a three-time Member of the Legislative Assembly from the Sopore constituency, elected on a Jamaat-e-Islami ticket in 1972, 1977 and in 1987.

== Early life ==
Syed Ali Geelani was born in 1929 in a village called Zurimanz, in the Aloosa tehsil, in the Bandipora district of North Kashmir. He was the son of a landless labourer in the canals department. Geelani was educated partly in Sopore and the rest in Lahore. He studied in a madrasa attached to the Masjid Wazir Khan and later enrolled in the Oriental College. He completed &quot;Adib &#x27;Alim&quot;, a course in Islamic theology.

== Career ==
Returning to Kashmir after studies in Lahore, Geelani became active in the Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference. He was appointed the secretary of the party unit in Zurimanj. In 1946, during the Quit Kashmir movement of the National Conference, he came in contact with Maulana Sayeed Masoodi, the general secretary of the National Conference, who took a liking to him and made him a reporter to the party newspaper &quot;Akhbar-i-Khidmat&quot;.

Masoodi also sponsored further studies for Geelani, who completed an &quot;adib-i-fazil&quot; course in Urdu and other courses in Persian and English. After this, he took a job as a school teacher, first at Pathar Masjid and later at Rainawari in Srinagar. Here he came in contact with Saaduddin Tarabali, a follower of the Jamaat-e-Islami founder Maulana Abul A&#x27;la Maududi. Maududi advocated a hardline Islamist ideology, whereby Islam had to be the foundation of the entire political order. Geelani had borrowed a book of Maududi from the local book store, which made a deep impression upon him. He was to later say, Maududi had &quot;beautifully.. expressed the feelings that lay deep down in my own heart&quot;. The National Conference headquarters, Mujahid Manzil, where Geelani apparently stayed, soon began to be seen as &quot;a den of Pakistanis&quot;.

Geelani was soon moved out of Srinagar, and he came to work in the Intermediate College in Sopore. He stayed in this position for six years. During this time, he was reading the literature of Jamaat-e-Islami and conveying its contents to his students in lectures. He also addressed congregations in mosques. He had become a full-fledged member of Jamaat in 1952.

=== Electoral politics ===

Geelani entered into electoral politics ahead of the 1971 Indian general election. Geelani had claimed that the Jamaat-e-Islami wanted to use it as an opportunity to spread its ideology, keep the Kashmir issue in prominence and protect basic and fundamental rights of the people. Geelani contested as an independent candidate but lost to Syed Ahmed Aga, with the Jamaat alleging ballot rigging.

He participated in the 1972 legislative assembly election from Sopore. He won from the seat in that year and again in the 1977 legislative assembly election. He was however defeated in the 1983 election due to the sympathy wave generated for the Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference by the death of Sheikh Abdullah. Geelani also contested the 1977 Indian general election as an independent candidate due to the banning of Jamaat in 1975, but lost to Abdul Ahad Vakil.

In the 1987 legislative assembly election, Jamaat-e-Islami candidates including Geelani participated under a coalition of parties called the Muslim United Front (MUF). Geelani won the seat from Sopore, but was expelled from the MUF in 1988. Geelani resigned as an MLA in August 1989 due to alleged widespread ballot rigging in the 1987 election.

=== Separatist leader ===
Geelani was viewed as a key separatist leader in Kashmir. Omar Abdullah, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, blamed Geelani for the rise in militancy and bloodshed in Kashmir, while his father and former Union Minister Farooq Abdullah urged Geelani to follow a path which would &quot;save Kashmiri people from further destruction&quot;.

He was one of the founding members of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), an alliance of Kashmiri social and political organisations who supported a referendum for Kashmir, in 1993 and was the initial choice for the position of its chairman. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was however chosen instead due to the secular organisations forming majority of the alliance. Geelani became the chairman in 1998, and was replaced by Abdul Ghani Bhat on 20 July 2000.

He also criticised the Jammu and Kashmir People&#x27;s Conference for fielding proxy candidates in the 2002 assembly election and sought its removal, threatening to launch his own party. In May 2003, the Jamaat-e-Islami removed him as its representative from the executive body of Hurriyat in order to counter hardliners in the organisation. In August 2003 it removed him from the position of head of its political bureau, appointing Ashraf Sehrai in his place.

The appointment of Mohammad Abbas Ansari as chairman of Hurriyat precipitated a crisis in the organisation and it split in September 2003. Geelani formed his own faction within the Hurriyat Conference, called the &quot;All Parties Hurriyat Conference (G)&quot;, in September 2003 and was elected as its chairman for three years, replacing its interim chairman Masarat Alam Bhat. It consists of 24 parties. In 2006 he was re-elected for a term of three years despite expressing his desire to step down owing to ill health. In 2015, he was appointed as the lifetime chairman of the faction.

In February 2004, he sought to form his own party. The Jamaat-e-Islami prohibited him from doing so and suspended him. In response, he dropped the idea for launching the party and tried to take over the leadership of the organisation. Bowing to the pressure, the Jamaat readmitted him in August 2004 and allowed him to form his own party. In the same month he founded the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat and was elected as its chairman for three years in October 2004. He was re-elected to the position for three year-terms consecutively in 2007, 2010 and 2013. In 2017 he was given a year-long extension after the party failed to hold regular elections in 2016 due to the 2016–2017 Kashmir unrest.

Jammat-e-Islami removed Geelani from its advisory council in 2005. It later started distancing itself from him and stated that he did not represent them, but the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat. In April 2010 it temporarily expelled him from the organisation due to him defending the freedom of the author of his biography &quot;Qaid-e-Inqilab – Ek Tareekh, Ek Tehreek&quot; over making derogatory remarks against the party, but later restored him as a basic member (&quot;rukun&quot;).

Geelani had called for numerous general strikes or shutdowns, in response to the deaths of unnamed suspected militants, local militants and death of civilians in Kashmir.

Geelani had appealed to people of Kashmir to boycott the 2014 legislative assembly elections completely, not accepting the proposals for self-rule or autonomy that had been offered by the People&#x27;s Democratic Party and the then ruling National Conference. Despite repeated boycott appeals, the elections had record voter turnout of more than 65%, which was the highest in 25 years of history of the state. After record voting percentage in Kashmir, Geelani, along with other separatists, were criticised by Indian media for misleading people of Kashmir and for not representing true sentiments of Kashmiri people.

Geelani received the invitation to participate in the annual meeting of the foreign ministers of member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Kashmir Contact Group to be held in New York from 27 September 2015. After the killing of Burhan Muzaffar Wani and the unrest that followed it, to restore normalcy in Kashmir, Geelani sent a letter to United Nations listing six confidence-building measures.

In March 2018, Geelani announced his resignation as chairman of the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat citing ill health, being replaced with Ashraf Sehrai. However he remained the chairman of his faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference. In June 2020 he announced his resignation from the faction, accusing it of nepotism and corruption, in addition to misinterpreting his speeches and taking decisions without him. It however refused to accept his resignation and did not name a new chairman until after his death.

=== Sedition charge ===
On 29 November 2010, Geelani, along with writer Arundhati Roy, activist Varavara Rao and three others, was charged under &quot;sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between classes), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 504 (insult intended to provoke breach of peace) and 505 (false statement, rumour circulated with intent to cause mutiny or offence against public peace...) to be read with Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act of 1967&quot;. The charges, which carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, were the result of a self-titled seminar they gave in New Delhi, &quot;Azadi-the Only Way&quot; on 21 October, at which Geelani was heckled.

== Personal life ==
Geelani lived in Hyderpora, Srinagar. Geelani has 2 sons; Nayeem and Naseem, and four daughters; Anisha, Farhat Jabeen, Zamshida, and Chamshida. Anisha and Farhat are Geelani&#x27;s daughters from his second marriage. Nayeem and his wife are both doctors who used to live and practise medicine in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, but they returned to India in 2010. Geelani&#x27;s younger son, Naseem works as a Senior scientist at Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology in Srinagar. Geelani&#x27;s grandson Izhaar is a crew member in a private airline in India. Geelani&#x27;s daughter Farhat is a madani teacher in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and her husband is an engineer there. Geelani&#x27;s other grandchildren are studying in leading schools of India. His cousin Ghulam Nabi Fai is presently in London. Ruwa Shah, daughter of Kashmiri separatist Altaf Ahmad Shah (SAS Geelani&#x27;s son-in-law) is a journalist. She previously worked as a journalist in India with organisations including the Al Jazeera, IANS and The Indian Express.

=== Health issues, passport suspension and house arrest ===
Geelani&#x27;s passport was seized in 1981 due to accusations of &quot;anti-India&quot; activities. With the exception of his Hajj pilgrimage in 2006, he has not been allowed to leave India. He was diagnosed with renal cancer, and advised treatment from abroad in the same year. On the then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#x27;s intervention, the government returned Geelani&#x27;s passport to his son. In 2007, his condition worsened, although in the early stages of the cancer, it was life-threatening and surgery was advised. Geelani was set to travel to either the UK or the United States. However, his visa request was rejected by the American government citing his violent approach in Kashmir conflict and he went to Mumbai for surgery. His supporters and family alleged that this was a &quot;human rights violation&quot;.

On 6 March 2014, Geelani fell ill with a severe chest infection, shortly after returning to his home in Srinagar. He has been under house arrest for most of the time since 2010, and was put under house arrest again on his return. In May 2015, Geelani applied for passport to visit his daughter in Saudi Arabia. The Indian government withheld it citing technical reasons, including the fact that he deliberately failed to fill in the nationality column required in the application. On 21 July, the Government granted him a passport on humanitarian grounds, with a validity of nine months, after Geelani acknowledged his nationality as an Indian.

=== Death rumour ===
On 12 March 2014, rumors of Geelani&#x27;s death, spread by edits to his Wikipedia entry, &quot;a particular Hindi news channel&quot;, and pages on Facebook led the government of Kashmir to suspend internet and phone service, according to some sources. However, the then Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said that the failures had nothing to do with Geelani&#x27;s health and were due to a snapped power line as well as an optical fibre cut due to heavy snowfall, which left most of the valley without power. The cuts in Internet service, hours after a statement by Hurriyat that Geelani would be flown to New Delhi for medical treatment, were blamed for spreading the rumours.

=== FEMA case ===
After the 2019 Pulwama attack, India took stronger action against pro-Pakistan separatists including Geelani. The Enforcement Directorate levied a penalty of ₹14.40 lakh and ordered confiscation of nearly ₹6.8 lakh in connection with a Foreign Exchange Management Act case against him for illegal possession of foreign exchange.

== Death ==
Geelani reportedly developed breathing complications and died on 1 September 2021 at his Hyderpora residence in Srinagar due to his prolonged illness.
His son Naseem alleged that police raided the house, took the body forcibly and buried it in a graveyard in his Hyderpora locality in the middle of the night. According to Naseem, no one from the close family was allowed to attend the burial, but they visited the grave next morning. Dilbag Singh, the Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police, however denied the allegations.

Restrictions on travel and internet were imposed in Kashmir soon after Geelani&#x27;s death. On 2 September 2021, FIR was registered against his family members under UAPA for clothing his body with a Pakistani flag and for allegedly raising “anti-national” slogans.

Kashmiri political leaders, as well as members of Government of Pakistan, condoled his death. Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered flags to be flown at half-mast to mourn his death.

== Honours and awards ==
On 14 August 2020, Pakistani President Arif Alvi conferred Nishan-e-Pakistan, Pakistan&#x27;s highest civil award on Geelani to recognise his decades-long struggle for Kashmiris’ right to self-determination.

== Views ==
In February 2014, he said prisoners in Kashmir &quot;are the victims of custodial violence and are harassed in Indian jails especially in Tihar Jail&quot; after an incident where parents of Javaid Ahmad Khan, serving a life sentence, &quot;had travelled thousands of kilometres and invested a lot of money to reach Delhi to meet their jailed son but were denied a meeting with him. &quot;This is state terrorism&quot;, he said.

He is viewed as sympathetic to Jamat-e-Islami. His official residence was viewed as Jamat property before he donated it to the Milli Trust.

Geelani called Islamist leader and founder of the Jamaat-e-Islami, Abul A&#x27;la Maududi his mentor.

In November 2011, Geelani called for protests against the alleged &quot;objectionable anti-Islamic&quot; content on the social networking website Facebook, which he described as a &quot;satanic audacity&quot;. His call triggered protests in various parts of the Kashmir valley, leading to minor clashes between the protestors and the security forces.

Geelani condemned the killing of Osama bin Laden by the US. After Bin Laden&#x27;s death in May 2011, Geelani said that he would lead last rite prayers in absentia in Srinagar for the slain al-Qaeda leader. After holding prayers for Osama in congregation of thousands of Kashmiris, a European Union delegation snubbed Geelani by cancelling a scheduled meeting with him. He further supported 2001 Indian Parliament attack accused Afzal Guru and one of 2008 Mumbai Attacks masterminds and Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed.

=== Kashmir ===
Geelani said that while Pakistan supported &quot;the indigenous struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, morally, diplomatically and politically ... this does not mean Pakistan can take a decision on our behalf.&quot;

Geelani would only support a dialogue process aimed at resolving Kashmir issue in accordance with the wishes and aspirations of the people of the state. But he believed that dialogue between India and Pakistan starts under diplomatic compulsions, and it is nothing but just a time delaying tactics. He was of the opinion that Kashmiris are not enemies of India or hold any grudge against its inhabitants. We are desirous of a strong India and Pakistan and it is only possible when Kashmir issue is resolved to pave the way for peace, prosperity and development in the region.

He said, &quot;Kashmir is not any border dispute between India and Pakistan which they can solve by bilateral understandings. It is the issue concerning future of 15 million people. The Hurriyat is not in principle against a dialogue process but without involvement of Kashmiri people, such a process has proved meaningless in the past. We don&#x27;t have any expectations of it being fruitful in future too.&quot; He further stated, &quot;India should immediately and unconditionally release political prisoners, and withdraw cases against youth, which are pending in the courts for the past 20 years.&quot;

=== Separatism and relations with Pakistan ===
Geelani has been repeatedly criticised by Indian authorities for inciting violence in the Kashmir Valley and working as offshoot of Pakistan. Geelani said openly that he was not Indian. &quot;Travelling on the Indian passport is a compulsion of every Kashmiri as Kashmir is an Internationally accepted Disputed region between India and Pakistan&quot; are his words when applying for Indian Passport. &quot;We are Pakistani; Pakistan is ours,&quot; he said in a big gathering of his supporters.

While Geelani&#x27;s personal opinion about Kashmir was that it be merged with Pakistan, he stood up against both Indian and Pakistani governments, including former President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf, who did not support Kashmiri people&#x27;s right to self-determination.

Sheikh Mustafa Kamal, a senior leader of Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference and son of Sheikh Abdullah criticised Geelani for working on &quot;dictations&quot; given by Pakistan. He accused Geelani of being &quot;a double agent&quot; on &quot;the payroll of Pakistan&#x27;s ISI&quot;.

Pakistan also openly supported Geelani, the three-member delegation from Pakistan High Commission led by Abdul Basit met Geelani at his Malviya Nagar residence in March 2015. Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit assured Geelani of complete support conveying that the country&#x27;s stand on Kashmir remains unchanged despite regime change in New Delhi. Abdul Basit also invited Geelani for Pakistan Day function on 23 March. Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, ritually invites pro-separatist leadership of Jammu and Kashmir. On 14 August, the Pakistani government awarded him its highest civilian award, the Nishan-e-Pakistan.

In the last few decades, Geelani refused any proposal from Governments of India and Pakistan and was consistent in his demand for the United Nations promised plebiscite of 1948.

<doc id="1052910" wikidata="Q1271842" url="?curid=1052910" title="Miniaturization">
<text>Miniaturization (Br.Eng.: &quot;miniaturisation&quot;) is the trend to manufacture ever-smaller mechanical, optical, and electronic products and devices. Examples include miniaturization of mobile phones, computers and vehicle engine downsizing. In electronics, the exponential scaling and miniaturization of silicon MOSFETs (MOS transistors) leads to the number of transistors on an integrated circuit chip doubling every two years, an observation known as Moore&#x27;s law. This leads to MOS integrated circuits such as microprocessors and memory chips being built with increasing transistor density, faster performance, and lower power consumption, enabling the miniaturization of electronic devices.

== Electronic circuits ==
The history of miniaturization is associated with the history of information technology based on the succession of switching devices, each smaller, faster, and cheaper than its predecessor. During the period referred to as the Second Industrial Revolution (), miniaturization was confined to two-dimensional electronic circuits used for the manipulation of information. This orientation is demonstrated in the use of vacuum tubes in the first general-purpose computers. The technology gave way to the development of transistors in the 1950s and then the integrated circuit (IC) approach which followed.

The MOSFET was invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960. It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturized and mass-produced for a wide range of uses, due to its high scalability and low power consumption, leading to increasing transistor density. This made it possible to build high-density IC chips, with reduced cost-per-transistor as transistor density increased.

In the early 1960s, Gordon Moore, who later founded Intel, recognized that the ideal electrical and scaling characteristics of MOSFET devices would lead to rapidly increasing integration levels and unparalleled growth in electronic applications. Moore&#x27;s law, which he described in 1965, and which was later named after him, predicted that the number of transistors on an IC for minimum component cost would double every 18 months. In 1974, Robert H. Dennard at IBM recognized the rapid MOSFET scaling technology and formulated the related Dennard scaling rule. Moore described the development of miniaturization during the 1975 International Electron Devices Meeting, confirming his earlier predictions.

By 2004, electronics companies were producing silicon IC chips with switching MOSFETs that had feature size as small as 130 nanometers (nm) and development was also underway for chips a few nanometers in size through the nanotechnology initiative. The focus is to make components smaller to increase the number that can be integrated into a single wafer and this required critical innovations, which include increasing wafer size, the development of sophisticated metal connections between the chip&#x27;s circuits, and improvement in the polymers used for masks (photoresists) in the photolithography processes. These last two are the areas where miniaturization has moved into the nanometer range.

== Other fields ==
Miniaturization became a trend in the last fifty years and came to cover not just electronic but also mechanical devices. The process for miniaturizing mechanical devices is more complex due to the way the structural properties of mechanical parts change as they are reduced in scale. It has been said that the so-called Third Industrial Revolution (1969 – c. 2015) is based on economically viable technologies that can shrink three-dimensional objects.

In medical technology, engineers and designers have been exploring miniaturization to shrink components to the micro and nanometer range. Smaller devices can have lower cost, be made more portable (e.g.: for ambulances), and allow simpler and less invasive medical procedures.

<text>Krosno County () is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Subcarpathian Voivodeship, south-eastern Poland, on the Slovak border. It came into being on January 1, 1999, as a result of the Polish local government reforms passed in 1998. Its administrative seat is the city of Krosno, although the city is not part of the county (it constitutes a separate city county). The county contains four towns: Jedlicze, Rymanów, Dukla, and Iwonicz-Zdrój.

The county covers an area of . As of 2019 its total population is 112,301, out of which the population of Jedlicze is 5,736, that of Rymanów is 3,825, that of Dukla is 2,061, that of Iwonicz-Zdrój is 1,787, and the rural population is 98,892.

==Neighbouring counties==
Apart from the city of Krosno, Krosno County is bordered by Jasło County to the west, Strzyżów County to the north, and Brzozów County and Sanok County to the east. It also borders Slovakia to the south.

==Administrative division==
The county is subdivided into ten gminas (four urban-rural and six rural). These are listed in the following table, in descending order of population. (There were previously only nine gminas; Gmina Jaśliska was separated from Gmina Dukla as of January 1, 2010.)

==Government==
In the Sejm and Senate, the county is part of the Krosno constituency and Senate constituency no. 57 respectively.

<text>The 30th Canadian Parliament was in session from September 30, 1974, until March 26, 1979. The membership was set by the 1974 election on July 8, 1974, and was only changed somewhat due to resignations and by-elections before it was dissolved prior to the 1979 election.

It was controlled by a Liberal Party majority led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the 20th Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the Progressive Conservative Party, led first by Robert Stanfield, and then by Joe Clark.

The sessions were prorogued (reason unknown currently).

The Speaker was James Jerome. See also the List of Canadian electoral districts 1966-1976 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

<doc id="1052925" wikidata="Q1052253" url="?curid=1052925" title="Psalm 151">
<text>Psalm 151 is a short psalm found in most copies of the Septuagint (LXX), but not in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible. The title given to the psalm in the Septuagint indicates that it is , as no number is affixed to it. The psalm is ascribed to David. It is also included in some manuscripts of the Peshitta. The psalm concerns the story of David and Goliath.

The Eastern Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, and Syrian Orthodox churches accept Psalm 151 as canonical. Protestants and most forms of Judaism consider it apocryphal. However, it is found in some Catholic Bibles—though the Catholic Church considers it noncanonical—in editions of the Vulgate as well as in some ecumenical translations (e.g., the Revised Standard Version). Psalm 151 is cited once in the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Breviary as a responsory of the series from the books of Kings, the second in the Roman Breviary, together with (Greek 1–2 Kings is linked to the traditional 1–2 Samuel, and Greek 3–4 Kings to the traditional 1–2 Kings) in a text slightly different from that of the Vulgate. Athanasius of Alexandria mentions this psalm as being &quot;especially the Psalm of David&quot; and as being suited to occasions in which &quot;weak as you are, you people are chosen for some position of authority among the brethren.&quot;

==Text==
The title of the psalm states that it was written by David after his battle with Goliath. The psalm assumes familiarity with other Biblical passages, from which it draws phraseology.

Psalm 151 is preserved in Hebrew, Greek (LXX), and Syriac.
==Dead Sea Scrolls discovery==

For many years scholars believed that Psalm 151 was originally composed in Greek, based on the view that &quot;there is no evidence that Psalm 151 ever existed in Hebrew.&quot;

However, Psalm 151 appears along with several canonical and non-canonical psalms in the scroll known as &quot;The Great Psalms Scroll&quot; or &quot;11Q5,&quot; a scroll, dating from the 1st century, that was discovered in 1956. The &quot;editio princeps&quot; of this manuscript was first published in 1963 by James A. Sanders. This scroll contains two short Hebrew psalms which scholars now agree served as the basis for Psalm 151.

A Hebrew psalm known as “Psalm 151a” provides the source material for verses 1–5 of the Greek Psalm 151, while the remaining verses are derived from another Hebrew psalm, known as “Psalm 151b,” which is only partially preserved. The composer of the Greek Psalm apparently brought the two Hebrew psalms together in a manner that significantly changes their meaning and structure, but the influence of the Hebrew originals is still readily apparent. Where parts of the Greek version sometimes seem to make little sense or are ambiguous, the Hebrew text sheds light on the intended message or meaning. In comparison to the Hebrew text, Sanders regards the Greek text of this psalm to be in places “desiccated,” “meaningless,” “truncated,” “absurd,” “jumbled,” and “disappointingly different,” all as a result of its having been “made from a truncated amalgamation of the two Hebrew psalms.” On details of translation, structure, and meaning of this psalm, see also the works of Skehan, Brownlee, Carmignac, John Strugnell, Rabinowitz, Dupont-Sommer, and Flint.

== Liturgical usage ==

=== Armenian liturgy ===
In the Armenian Church, Psalm 151 is recited as part of the Matins sequence of biblical poetic material, which includes canticles from the Old and New Testaments, Psalms 51, 148–150, and 113 (numbering according to the Septuagint). The Armenian version of Psalm 151 is close to the Septuagint, with some variation. Where verse 2 in Greek reads αἱ χεῖρές μου ἐποίησαν ὄργανον οἱ δάκτυλοί μου ἤροσαν ψαλτήριον &quot;My hands made an instrument, my fingers fashioned the lyre,&quot; the Armenian has, Ձերք իմ արարին զսաղմոսարանս եւ մատունք իմ կազմեցին զգործի աւրհնութեան &quot;My hands made the lyres (Armenian զսաղմոսարանս can then means also &#x27;Psalm-books&#x27; &#x27;psalters&#x27;) and my fingers fashioned the instrument of blessing.&quot;

=== Coptic liturgy ===
In the Coptic Church, Psalm 151 is recited at the start of the Bright Saturday Vigil, also known as the Apocalypse Vigil. The words of the psalm are interpreted as a Messianic prophecy concerning Christ&#x27;s defeat of Satan.

=== Eastern Orthodox liturgy ===
Psalm 151 is typically included in liturgical Psalters; however, it is not part of the weekly Kathisma cycle of readings, nor is it appointed to be read at any service.

Verse 4 (&quot;He sent out his angel,&quot; etc.) is chanted among the verses of the Polyeleos sung at Matins on November 8, the feast of the Archangels.

==English versions==
Besides being available in Orthodox or ecumenical editions of modern translations since 1977 (Revised Standard Version, New Revised Standard Version, English Standard Version, Orthodox Study Bible, Contemporary English Version, Common English Bible), there are a number of English translations now in the public domain. William Whiston included it in his &quot;Authentic Records&quot;. It can be found in translations by Charles Thomson to Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton, and in Adam Clarke&#x27;s commentary. It is included in Sabine Baring-Gould&#x27;s &quot;Legends of the Patriarchs and Prophets&quot;, William Digby Seymour&#x27;s Hebrew Psalter, and William Ralph Churton&#x27;s &quot;Uncanonical and Apocryphal Scriptures&quot;. William Wright published a translation of the Syriac version in the &quot;Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology&quot;, June 1887, and A. A. Brockway published a translation from the Coptic in the January 27, 1898 New York Times.

==Cultural influence==
At the beginning of his first address to his Council of State, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia recited this psalm in full.

==Other references to Psalm 151==

The term &quot;Psalm 151&quot; has been used in other contexts, including modern popular culture. In these instances, the term does not refer to the supernumerary psalm included in the Orthodox canon, but instead as a metaphor (such as to the abstract concept of a new and &quot;sacred&quot; work of poetry or song).

* The TV show &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, Season 5, Episode 9 (originally aired 15 November 1998) is titled &quot;Psalm 151&quot; with a song sung by Wynonna Judd called &quot;Testify to Love&quot;. In the episode, she composes the song for her dying son.

* In 1993, Péter Eötvös composed &quot;Psalm 151 – In Memoriam Frank Zappa&quot; for solo or four percussionists.

* Christian rock band Jacob&#x27;s Trouble wrapped up their 1989 &quot;Door into Summer&quot; LP with track 11, &quot;Psalm 151.&quot;

* Rock artist Ezra Furman included a self-penned song entitled &quot;Psalm 151&quot; on her 2018 LP &quot;Transangelic Exodus&quot;; she later admitted she was unaware of Psalm 151&#x27;s existence.

* The song &quot;My Favorite Mutiny&quot; from the album &quot;Pick a Bigger Weapon&quot; by The Coup (ft. Talib Kweli and Black Thought) contains the lyric &quot;Tryin&#x27; to find Psalm number 151.&quot;

* Hip-hop artist Jay-Z uses &quot;Psalm 151&quot; as a metaphor in the 2022 song &quot;God Did&quot; by DJ Khaled.

<text>Cividate Camuno (Camunian: ) is an Italian &quot;comune&quot; of 2,774 inhabitants (2011), in Val Camonica, province of Brescia, in Lombardy.

==Geography==
The territory of Cividate Camuno is bordered by several municipalities: to the east Bienno, on the north Breno and Malegno, to the west Piancogno, and south Esine and Berzo Inferiore.

==History==

Originally a Roman town, the &quot;Civitas Camunnorum&quot;, Cividate Camuno was known as &quot;Civethate&quot; in the medieval period.

Between 1863 and 1887 Cividate assumed the name &quot;Cividate Alpino&quot;, but because of bureaucratic confusion, in 1887 the village re-took the name &quot;Cividate Camuno&quot; .

==Main sights==
The main tourist sights of Cividate Camuno are:
* Parish Church of Santa Maria Assunta, standing on the site of the baptismal chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist, which was replaced after the 11th century by the Romanesque church. 
* Church of Santo Stefano. Commanding the countryside, it is accessed by a ladder with four flights with no other possibility of approach (the ladder is dated 1770). Archaeological excavations have reported pre-Christian elements. 
* Medieval tower of the 12th-13th century
* Renaissance gates
* Museo nazionale della Valcamonica
* The Roman park of the theatre and amphitheatre

==Culture==
The scütüm are in camunian dialect nicknames, sometimes personal, elsewhere showing the characteristic features of a community. The one which characterize the people of Cividate Camuno is &quot;Pàtate&quot;, &quot;Bö&quot; or &quot;Maia Hüche&quot;.

<doc id="1052937" wikidata="Q104046" url="?curid=1052937" title="Coccaglio">
<text>Coccaglio (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. It is approximately west of Brescia and southeast of Bergamo. The town is situated under the Monte Orfano, a lone hill in the midst of the Pianura Padana. 

It was the birthplace, in 1553, of Luca Marenzio, one of the most influential composers of madrigals of the late 16th century.

The church of Santa Maria Nascente is the town&#x27;s main church.

== History ==
The train station of Coccaglio is a historic building. This station is still in service, connecting Coccaglio to most of the surrounding cities directly. The history of the station starts when in the 1850s it was installed as a stop om the Milano-Venezia railroad. In 1878 a new direct connection was made at a station in Rovato, the town bordering with Coccaglio on the East. This new connection turned the stop at the Station in Coccaglio into a local railroad stop.

== Businesses ==
Coccaglio is home to the Hotel Touring, a four star hotel.

<doc id="1052945" wikidata="Q7793337" url="?curid=1052945" title="Thomas R. Berger">
<text>Thomas Rodney Berger (March 23, 1933April 28, 2021) was a Canadian politician and jurist. He was briefly a member of the House of Commons of Canada in the early 1960s, entering provincial politics thereafter. He led the British Columbia New Democratic Party for most of 1969, prior to Dave Barrett. Berger was a justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia from 1971 to 1983. In 1974, Berger became the royal commissioner of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry, which released its findings in 1977. After retiring from the bench, Berger continued to practise law and served in various public capacities. He was a member of the Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia.

==Early life and education==
Thomas Rodney Berger was born on March 23, 1933, in Victoria, British Columbia. He was the son of Royal Canadian Mounted Police sergeant Theodor Berger and Nettie Elsie Perle, née McDonald. Berger received a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws from the University of British Columbia in 1955 and 1956, respectively.

==Career==
===Politics===
Thomas R. Berger was elected at the age of 29 to the House of Commons in the 1962 election, representing the riding of Vancouver—Burrard for the New Democratic Party. However, in the 1963 election, he was defeated by Liberal opponent Ron Basford.

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 1966 BC election. Described as a &quot;young man in a hurry&quot;, Berger challenged long-time BC CCF/NDP leader Robert Strachan for the party leadership in 1967. Strachan defeated Berger but, sensing the winds of change, resigned in 1969. Berger defeated another young MLA, Dave Barrett, to win the leadership convention and was widely expected to lead the NDP to its first general election victory. Social Credit Premier W.A.C. Bennett called an early snap election and, instead of victory, Berger&#x27;s NDP lost four seats. He quickly resigned and was succeeded by Dave Barrett. Berger&#x27;s last year as an MLA was 1969.

===Law===
Berger was counsel to the Nisga&#x27;a in &quot;Calder v British Columbia (Attorney General)&quot;, a case that inaugurated the concept of Aboriginal title in Canadian law.

Appointed to the Supreme Court of British Columbia in 1971, he served on the bench until 1983. Berger focused extensively on ensuring that industrial development on Aboriginal people&#x27;s land resulted in benefits to those indigenous people. He may be best known for his work as the Royal Commissioner of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry which released its findings on May 9, 1977.

In 1981 when Canada was debating the merits of a diversity of provisions in the proposed &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, Berger wrote an open letter to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, asserting that the rights of Aboriginal Canadians and women needed to be included in any proposed charter. In 1983 he was reprimanded by the Canadian Judicial Council for this activism. Shortly thereafter he chose to resign as a judge and returned to practice as a lawyer. Berger&#x27;s expertise and reputation for thorough and independent assessment were immediately seen as an asset for indigenous communities. He was invited by the Inuit Circumpolar Conference to lead the Alaska Native Review Commission (1983–1985) which culminated in the publication of &quot;Village Journey&quot; (1985).

In 1995, Thomas Berger was appointed Special Counsel to the Attorney General of British Columbia to inquire into allegations of sexual abuse at the Jericho Hill School for the Deaf. Berger was asked to investigate these allegations and produce a report. His recommendation for relief and compensation for those who were abused was accepted.

Berger was appointed chair of the Vancouver Electoral Reform Commission in 2003. The Commission recommended changing Vancouver&#x27;s at-large system to a system of ward-level representation. However, this recommendation was defeated in a referendum held on October 16, 2004.

Appointed in 2005 as a conciliator to resolve the impasse between Canada, Nunavut, and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated in implementing the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, Berger completed &quot;The Nunavut Project&quot; in 2006. His report addresses the fundamental changes needed to implement Article 23 (Inuit Employment within Government) of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, including the need for a strong indigenous education system.

In 2017, Berger was counsel to British Columbia in its challenge to Canada&#x27;s approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

==Royal commissions==
From 1973 to 1975, Berger chaired a royal commission on Family and Children&#x27;s Law.

From 1974 to 1977, he was commissioner of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry.

From 1979 to 1980, he chaired his third royal commission, on Indian and Inuit healthcare. In 1978, Indian bands and organizations such as the Union of B.C. Chiefs, the Native Brotherhood and United Native Nations, engaged in intense lobbying for Indigenous people to control delivery of health services in their own communities and for the repeal of restrictive service &quot;guidelines introduced in September 1978, to correct abuses in health delivery, and to deal with the environmental health hazards of mercury and fluoride pollution affecting particular communities.&quot;

In September 1979, David Crombie, a liberal-minded reformer, as Minister of Health and Welfare under the Conservative government of Prime Minister Joe Clark, issued a statement representing &quot;current Federal Government practice and policy in the field of Indian health.&quot; Crombie declared that the &quot;Federal Government is committed to joining with Indian representatives in a fundamental review of issues involved in Indian health when Indian representatives have developed their position, and the policy emerging from that review could supersede this policy&quot;. 
Crombie appointed Doctor Gary Goldthorpe, as commissioner of the federal inquiry (known as the Goldthorpe Inquiry) into &quot;alleged abuses in medical care delivery at Alert Bay, British Columbia&quot;.

In 1980, Justice Berger, who headed his third royal commission dealing with Indian and Inuit healthcare, recommended to Crombie &quot;that there be greater consultation with Indians and Inuit regarding the delivery of healthcare programs and that an annual sum of $950,000 was allocated for distribution by the National Indian Brotherhood to develop health consultation structures within the national Indian community.&quot; Crombie&#x27;s successor as Liberal Minister of Health and Welfare, Monique Begin, adopted Berger&#x27;s recommendations, ushering in the beginning of a change in healthcare delivery.

==Honours==
In 1989, he was made an officer of the Order of Canada. In 2004, he received the Order of British Columbia. A

He was an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada, student #S153.

In 2012, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.

== Death and legacy ==
Berger died of cancer on April 28, 2021, in Vancouver.

Edgar Z. Friedenberg, writing in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in 1982, called Berger &quot;perhaps the most effective and certainly the most respectable champion of the aboriginal peoples of Canada&quot;. Berger argued that the reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples could be facilitated by the Canadian judicial system. In her discussion of Berger&#x27;s life, Swayze asserts that Berger &quot;believes, and believes passionately, in the integrity of Canada’s system of equitable justice and its attendant jurisprudence&quot;. Throughout his career, Berger dedicated his life to law and to politics. He is recognized for his work on the &quot;Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry&quot; and the subsequent publication of &quot;The Berger Report&quot;. As Commissioner, Berger recommended that, &quot;on environmental grounds, no pipeline be built and no energy corridor be established across the Northern Yukon&quot; and that any pipeline construction be postponed until native claims could be settled. Despite his belief in the judicial system, Berger acknowledged that there were certain issues that could be dealt with outside of the courts. Swayze argues that &quot;[t]he philosophy inherent in all thirteen&quot; of the reports of British Columbia&#x27;s Royal Commission on Family and Children&#x27;s Law, on which Berger served as a commissioner, &quot;is that legal sanctions should, in many cases, be a last resort, and to this end recommendations focused on the effective use of human rather than legislated solutions.&quot;

<text>Collebeato (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. It is located on the right bank of the river Mella, north of Brescia.

==Geography==

Collebeato, in the northern hinterland of Brescia, is enclosed between the Picastello, Campiani, Peso, Dosso Boscone and Sasso mountains. It is located where the lower Val Trompia meets the Po Valley, on the easternmost border of Franciacorta. The Mella river flows through the municipality.

==History==

In Roman times, the Collebeato area was a hilly area that was not very inhabited close to the marshes created by the river Mella. Very few finds have been found: four sepulchral stones of the imperial age and the remains of the ancient Roman route that from Brixia across the Crotte Bridge led to the Trompia Valley climbing up the hills. 
In 958, in the diploma of Berengario II and Adalberto, a church dedicated to San Paolo appears as the property of the Abbey of Leno, this is probably the first reference to the community of Collebeato.

In 1014 the name Cubiadum (Cubiado) appears explicitly for the first time among the properties of the Abbey of Leno in the imperial diploma of Henry II. The etymology of the name derives from the Latin &quot;copulatum&quot; and means &quot;coupled&quot;.
The name also recurs in the diploma of Henry II of 1019 and then in those of Corrado II of 1026 and 1036 and is present in papal bulls and imperial diplomas up to 1434. The Benedictine monks of Leno provided for extensive reclamation of the Mella marshes.
Next to the territories managed by the abbots there is a municipal neighborhood in the lands from which the bishop of Brescia tithes. 
From 1186 to 1194 the notary Gerardus de Cubiado was active, appointed by the emperor Frederick Barbarossa. We have received eight documents signed by him. 
In 1194 (November 15) a trial was held to determine whether the Cubiado landholdings were under the Abbot of Leno or under the Bishop of Brescia. The two elderly heads of families of Cubiado Villano di Fra Le Corti and Alberto da Pozzo testify. 
In 1274, Father Giovanni da Cobiado was director of the hospital complex of the Church of San Giacomo al Mella, on the road from Brescia to Milan.

In 1280 Cobiato is counted among the municipalities that must keep the Ponte delle Crotte on the road to Brescia. On 1 December 1336 Jacopo da Cobiado, a physician in Brescia, is counted as a witness in a feudal investiture in the city with the bishop Giacomo de Actis. 
In 1483 the Venetian nobleman Marco Sanuto described in his itinerary in the Venetian mainland the &quot;beautiful garden&quot; of the noble Count Antonio Martinengo. 
In the 15th century Collebeato became a holiday resort for nobles and religious of the city of Brescia for the summer season, important villas and two monasteries (Santa Croce and Santo Stefano) were built. 
In 1512 Collebeato suffered a military siege by French soldiers who attacked the Venetian Brescia. Mariotto Martinengo, inspired by the destruction of the battles, wrote the poem in the Italian vernacular &quot;The Weeping of the god Pan for the ruin of Colle beato&quot;, using for the first time the poetic name &quot;Colle-beato&quot; instead of the more medieval &quot;Cobiato&quot;. 
In the Renaissance and humanistic climate brought by the nobles who vacationed in Collebeato, in addition to the development of villas and palaces, local artistic workers were also born, among these a painter and decorator native of the village Jacobino da Cobiato was active in the sixteenth century, of which however no works are known. 
In 1554 Galeazzo dai Orzi, Mariotto Martinengo&#x27;s secretary, published in Brescia a first edition of the poem in the vernacular of Brescia &quot;La massera da bé&quot; (the good housewife), the first book that ennobles the Brescia language as a literary language. The protagonist of the book is the housewife Flor da Coblat. In 1565 the Venetian version of the book came out. 
In 1609 the Venetian Giovanni Da Lezze described the territory of Cobiato, the villas and religious buildings in the Bresciano Catastic. 
In 1640 the Municipality of Cobiato endowed itself with precise statutes for the administration of the waters and to regulate common life.
In 1640 the Municipality of Cobiato endowed itself with precise statutes for the administration of the waters and to regulate common life. 
In 1701 the official use of the name Collebeato began on French maps and from 1779 on the Lombard-Venetian maps the name will officially remain this. 
From 1770 to 1794 the notary Bartolomeo Mattanza was active in Collebeato. 
From 1737 to 1800 the notary Gaetano Bonera was active. 
In 1833 the patrimony of the Martinengo Counts, on the death of Girolamo Silvio Martinengo, a Venetian noble (translator of Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost in 1801), passed to his cousin Alessandro Molin and through his daughter, Maria, to the Friulian counts Panciera di Zoppola still owners of the gardens and the splendid villa. 
In 1850, Count Giuseppe Torre at the gardens of his villa (the current Parco 1º Maggio) selected a new type of flower, the Camelia Japonica &quot;Vergine di Collebeato&quot;, a very particular type of white camellia with concentric spirals, described and admired in the 1857 by the statesman Giuseppe Zanardelli in one of his letters. 
From 1851 to 1856 Collebeato was the center of the Risorgimento riots in Brescia, where Mazzinians, who were housed and hidden in the villas and courtyards of the town, took refuge; an underground printing house was installed there. 
The patriot Tito Speri gathered and trained the anti-Austrian revolutionary troops in the country&#x27;s fields. 
In 1889 the priest, writer and intellectual Pietro Rigosa was born in Collebeato. He had as a pupil and friend Giovan Battista Montini (future Pope Paul VI), he wrote many short stories, including The Lion of Brescia (Gatti, Brescia 1932), a novel set in Collebeato and dedicated to the life of Tito Speri. 
In 1910 the industrialist and benefactor Filippo Rovetta imported American peach seedlings from Louisiana and in 1919 he started a large-scale production of peaches, tilling large plots of land in the north of the country, still existing orchards today. The example was soon followed by all the landowners in the country transforming local agriculture in a radical way. Collebeato was the main producer of peaches in the Brescia area until the 1940s and among the main nationally producing over ninety different species of peaches.
In 1936 the &quot;Dopolavoro&quot; organized the first Peach Festival, a festival for which the town is still renowned in the province of Brescia.
From 1956 to 1965 the quarry and factory of the CEMBRE cement factory were active, an activity that led to the decline of fish farming due to the environmental incompatibility between the two production activities that insisted on the same territory. 
After the war the building expansion of the town began, first with the villages of the white cooperatives of Father Ottorino Marcolini in the fifties and sixties and in the following years with red cooperatives. 
Today the flat territory is almost completely built of villas and condominiums with a large garden. 
The prestigious residential area is part of the &quot;Parco delle Colline&quot; area. 
In September 2012, the new sports center was completed, a work that completely redeveloped the area of the former Cembre cement factory. 
In 2018 Collebeato won the &quot;La Città per il Verde 2018&quot; award. The award was unanimously awarded by the jury of the XIX edition in recognition of the environmental validity of the &quot;Ecological Corridor of the Mella River&quot;.

<doc id="1052957" wikidata="Q13424369" url="?curid=1052957" title="Scare quotes">
<text>Scare quotes (also called shudder quotes or sneer quotes) are quotation marks that writers place around a word or phrase to signal that they are using it in an ironic, referential, or otherwise non-standard sense. Scare quotes may indicate that the author is using someone else&#x27;s term, similar to preceding a phrase with the expression &quot;&quot;; they may imply skepticism or disagreement, belief that the words are misused, or that the writer intends a meaning opposite to the words enclosed in quotes. Whether quotation marks are considered scare quotes depends on context because scare quotes are not visually different from actual quotations. The use of scare quotes is sometimes discouraged in formal or academic writing.

== History ==
Elizabeth Anscombe coined the term &quot;scare quotes&quot; as it refers to punctuation marks in 1956 in an essay titled &quot;Aristotle and the Sea Battle&quot;, published in&quot; Mind&quot;. The use of a graphic symbol on an expression to indicate irony or dubiousness goes back much further: Authors of ancient Greece used a mark called a &quot;diple periestigmene&quot; for that purpose. Beginning in the 1990s, the use of scare quotes suddenly became very widespread. Postmodernist authors in particular have theorized about bracketing punctuation, including scare quotes, and have found reasons for their frequent use in their writings. In 2014, &quot;Slate&quot; declared hashtags to be &quot;the new scare quotes&quot; in the sense that both are used for &quot;announcing distance&quot;. Just like scare quotes, hashtags such as #firstworldproblems or #YOLO signal that the phrase is not one&#x27;s own.

== Usage ==
Writers use scare quotes for a variety of reasons. They can imply doubt or ambiguity in words or ideas within the marks, or even outright contempt. They can indicate that a writer is purposely misusing a word or phrase or that the writer is unpersuaded by the text in quotes, and they can help the writer deny responsibility for the quote. Megan Garber in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; writes: &quot;to put terms like &#x27;identity politics&#x27; or &#x27;rape culture&#x27; or, yes, &#x27;alt-right&#x27; in scare quotes is ... to make, in that placement, a political declaration.&quot; In general, the punctuation expresses distance between the writer and the quote.

For example: The scare quotes could indicate that the word is not one the writer would normally use, or that the writer thinks there is something dubious about the word &quot;groupies&quot; or its application to these people. The exact meaning of the scare quotes is not clear without further context.

The term &quot;scare quotes&quot; may be confusing because of the word &quot;scare&quot;. An author may use scare quotes not to convey alarm, but to signal a semantic quibble. Scare quotes may suggest or create a problematization with the words set in quotes.

== Criticism ==
Some experts encourage writers to avoid scare quotes because they can distance the writer and confuse the reader.

Editor Greil Marcus, in a talk at Case Western Reserve University, described scare quotes as &quot;the enemy&quot;, adding that they &quot;kill narrative, they kill story-telling… They are a writer&#x27;s assault on his or her own words.&quot; Scare quotes have been described as ubiquitous, and the use of them as expressing distrust in truth, reality, facts, reason and objectivity.
Political commentator Jonathan Chait wrote in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, The scare quote is the perfect device for making an insinuation without proving it, or even necessarily making clear what you&#x27;re insinuating.In 1982, philosopher David Stove examined the trend of using scare quotes in philosophy as a means of neutralizing or suspending words that imply cognitive achievement, such as &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;discovery&quot;. 

Scare quotes can be replaced by writing text to make the insinuation explicit.

== In speech ==
In spoken conversation, a stand-in for scare quotes is a hand gesture known as &quot;air quotes&quot; or &quot;finger quotes&quot;, which mimics quotation marks. A speaker may alternatively say &quot;quote&quot; before and &quot;unquote&quot; after quoted words, or say &quot;&quot; before or after the quoted words, or pause before and emphasize the parts in quotes. These spoken methods are also used for literal and conventional quotes.

<doc id="1052959" wikidata="Q965716" url="?curid=1052959" title="Sclereid">
<text>Sclereids are a reduced form of sclerenchyma cells with highly thickened, lignified cellular walls that form small bundles of durable layers of tissue in most plants. The presence of numerous sclereids form the cores of apples and produce the gritty texture of guavas.

Although sclereids are variable in shape, the cells are generally isodiametric, prosenchymatic, forked, or elaborately branched. They can be grouped into bundles, can form complete tubes located at the periphery, or can occur as single cells or small groups of cells within parenchyma tissues. An isolated sclereid cell is known as an idioblast. Sclereids are typically found in the epidermis, ground tissue, and vascular tissue.

The term &quot;sclereid&quot; was introduced by Alexander Tschirch in 1885.

==Origin==

Sclereids are created through belated sclerosis of parenchyma cells or can arise from sclereid primordia that are individualized early in development. Sclerification typically involves thickening of the cell wall, increasing rigidity. In the phloem, when tissue ceases to function in conduction cells may begin sclerification. In vascular tissue, sclereids will develop from cambial and procambial cells.

==Stem sclereids==

In the vascular region of the stem of &quot;Hoya carnosa&quot;, a column of sclereids can be found, and in the pith of stems of &quot;Hoya&quot; and &quot;Podocarpus&quot; groups of sclereids can be found. These are sclereids with thick cell walls and numerous pits, resembling adjacent parenchyma cells. This resemblance suggests that these sclereids are originally parenchyma cells, but are so sclerified that they are now sclereid cells rather than parenchyma cells. These sclereids are an example of brachysclereids, or stone cells.

==Leaf sclereids==
Leaves contain a variety of types of sclereids. In the mesophyll, two distinct sclereid structures are found. Sclereids in a diffuse pattern are dispersed throughout the leaf tissue, and sclereids in a terminal pattern are concentrated about the tips of leaf veins. Sclereid formations in leaves include the branched sclereids of &quot;Trochodendron&quot;, the columnar sclereids of &quot;Hakea&quot;, and the hair-like trichosclereids that branch into air chambers within the leaves of the water lily and yellow pond lily. Sclereids can also form part of or the entire epidermis of foliar structures such as the clove scales of &quot;Allium sativum&quot;.

Especially interesting are the sclereids in olive leaves. They are typically in length and are thus named fiberlike sclereids. These sclereids permeate the mesophyll as a dense mat. During sclerification these fiberlike sclereid cells can increase by several hundred times their original size, compared to other parenchyma cells that only increase by two or three times.

==Fruit sclereids==

Sclereids in fruits vary in form and use. In pears, sclereids from concentric clusters that grow about earlier formed sclereids. These pear sclereids, as well as sclereids within quince fruit, often form bordered pits when the cell wall increases in thickness during sclerification. In apples, layers of elongated sclereids form the endocarp that encloses the seeds.

==Seed sclereids==

The hardening of seed coats during ripening often occurs through sclerification, when the secondary cell walls are thickened in the epidermis and below the epidermis. Leguminous seeds are examples of such sclerification. Larger sclereids form columns in the epidermis of pea, bean, and soybean seeds, and bone-shaped osteosclereids occur beneath the epidermis. In the seed coats of coconuts, sclereids possess numerous bordered pits. These larger macrosclereids found in seed coats are of origin.

<text>The Syracuse Herald-Journal (1925–2001) was an evening newspaper in Syracuse, New York, United States, with roots going back to 1839 when it was named the Western State Journal. The final issue — volume 124, number 37,500 — was published on September 29, 2001. The newspaper&#x27;s name came from the merger of the &quot;Syracuse Herald&quot; and the &quot;Syracuse Journal&quot;. 

==History==
Publisher William Randolph Hearst, who had purchased the Syracuse, New York, newspaper the &quot;Syracuse Telegram&quot;, closed that newspaper on November 24, 1925, with issue No. 925. At that time, the &quot;Syracuse Telegram&quot; and the Sunday edition, the &quot;Syracuse American&quot; a.k.a. the &quot;Syracuse Sunday American&quot;, merged with &quot;The Journal&quot;, an old Syracuse institution that was established on July 4, 1844. In the days of extremely partisan newspapers, it held the reputation as one of the strongest Republican publications in New York state.

The merger was accomplished after Hearst acquired a controlling interest in &quot;The Journal&quot; for nearly $1,000,000. in November 1925. The transaction was carried out, and Hearst &quot;sold&quot; the publication for $1,000,000 to Syracuse Newspapers, Inc., a new corporation and publisher of the consolidated paper. After the merger was completed, Hearst was a director of the company and still played a major role in the decision-making. 

Before the merger, there were three evening newspapers in Syracuse and &quot;the public was somewhat oversupplied.&quot; The merger left two papers in the market: &quot;The Herald&quot; and the consolidated &quot;Journal-Telegram&quot;. Like its predecessors, the new publication was delivered in the evening, and the &quot;Sunday American&quot; was published on Sunday mornings. It was decided that the &quot;Journal&quot; operating plant and facilities would be used as the office and publishing plant for the combined effort. The Hearst Building at the corner of Genesee and State streets was sold and 100 Hearst employees lost their jobs. The papers were combined as a single &quot;Herald-Journal&quot; title and bought by S. I. Newhouse in 1939; in 1944, he bought a rival publication, &quot;The Post-Standard&quot;. Newhouse&#x27;s company, Advance Publications, discontinued the &quot;Herald-Journal&quot; and &quot;Herald-American&quot; in 2001.

<text>Liu Xinwu (; born June 1942) is a Chinese author, and one of the earliest proponents of the post-Maoist wave of Chinese literature.

==Biography==
Born in the province of Sichuan, his family moved to Beijing, a city that figures prominently in his work, in 1950. Liu spent most of his life in Beijing, except for a brief period during the Cultural Revolution, when he was sent to work in rural China.

His short story, &quot;Class counsellor&quot; (also translated as &quot;The Class Teacher&quot;; ) published in 1977 was one of the earliest examples of prose condemning the excesses of the Chinese government during the Cultural Revolution. His work has sometimes been referred to as scar literature, though this assessment is disputed.

Liu filled editorial positions in a number of prominent government-sponsored publications throughout most of the 1980s. In 1987, however, he was removed as editor of the publication &quot;People&#x27;s Literature&quot; after a story published failed to meet government approval. He left all his government positions after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 because of continual harassment from the government for his pro-demonstrator stance. Since then, he has devoted himself entirely to his writing.

Liu&#x27;s work, which includes novels, short stories, and children&#x27;s literature, focuses on the common people of Beijing and people who live on the margins of society.

==Redology==
Since the early 1990s Liu has also been engaging in Redology, also known as studies of the famous 18th-century Chinese novel &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. Liu takes on the controversial stance that in studying this famous Qing novel, the researcher&#x27;s point of departure should be the figure of Qin Keqing, thus authoring the branch of Qin studies () within redology. In 2006 Liu gave a talk at Columbia University introducing this concept. Liu has also published on &quot;The Dream&quot; with the famous redologist Zhou Ruchang.

<doc id="1052978" wikidata="Q3955193" url="?curid=1052978" title="Senate of Puerto Rico">
<text>The Senate of Puerto Rico () is the upper house of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, the territorial legislature of Puerto Rico. The Senate, together with the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico, control the legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico.

The structure and responsibilities of the Senate are defined in Article III of the Constitution of Puerto Rico which vests all legislative power in the Legislative Assembly. Every bill must be passed by both the Senate and the House and then signed by the Governor of Puerto Rico in order to become law.

The Senate has exclusive power to try and to decide impeachments. The constitution also establishes that all secretaries appointed by the governor to the different executive departments, as well as all judges and the Comptroller, require the advice and consent of the Senate. Justices of the Supreme Court can not assume office until after confirmation by the Senate.

The Senate has 27 members. Sixteen are elected from senatorial districts, with two senators per district, while an additional 11 are elected at-large.

The Senate has been meeting since 1917, after the enactment of the Jones–Shafroth Act established the body formally. The current session is the 27th Senate of Puerto Rico which has a majority from the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; giving the party control over the Senate without political opposition including constitutional amendments.

The Senate, along with its members and staff, are housed in the eastern half of the Capitol of Puerto Rico. These buildings are usually the Rafael Martínez Nadal Senate Annex Building, the Luis Muñoz Marín Office Building, the Antonio R. Barceló Building, the Luis A. Ferré Building, the Ramón Mellado Parsons Office Building and the Baltasar Corrada del Rio Office Building.

==History==
The Senate of Puerto Rico was established in 1917, after the signing of the Jones-Shafroth Act. Signed on March 2, 1917, the act made Puerto Ricans into U.S. citizens and empowered them to have a popularly elected Senate. This came to amend and improve the Foraker Act, signed in 1900, which granted limited administrative and executive powers to Puerto Ricans.

From 1900 to 1917, Puerto Ricans made several attempts to convince the United States into amending the Foraker Act, so they could elect their own Senate. In February 1914, Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, Luis Muñoz Rivera presented legislation in Congress insisting in the creation of a Puerto Rican Senate with more powers. Finally, in January 1916, Representative William Jones presented the Jones Act for Puerto Rico and other territories. It was signed by Woodrow Wilson on March 2, 1917.

On August 13, 1917, the first Senate of Puerto Rico was sworn in. Antonio R. Barceló was chosen as its first President, with Eduardo Georgetti as his Pro tempore. Also, José Muñoz Rivera and Manuel Palacios Salazar were selected as Secretary and Sergeant at Arms respectively. In this first instance, the Senate was composed of 19 members, 14 of which were chosen from each of the seven senatorial districts, and five elected at-large.

==Functions==
The Senate, along with the House of Representatives, are in charge of the legislative power of the Government of Puerto Rico.

The Senate has exclusive power to try and to decide impeachment cases, and in meeting for such purposes, the Senators act in the name of the people of Puerto Rico. The Constitution also establishes that all Secretaries appointed by the Governor to the different executive departments, as well as all judges, require the advice and consent of the Senate. Justices of the Supreme Court can not assume office until after confirmation by the Senate.

==Membership==

===Qualifications===
Article III of the Constitution of Puerto Rico states that no person can be a member of the Senate unless the candidate:
* is capable of reading and writing in either Spanish or English;
* is a citizen of the United States and Puerto Rico;
* has resided in Puerto Rico for at least two years immediately prior to the date of his election or appointment;
* is over thirty years of age.

===Elections===

Elections to the Senate are held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, along with the elections for governor, resident commissioner, the House, the mayors, and the municipal assemblies. The last election was held on November 8, 2016, where the members of the 26th Senate of Puerto Rico were elected. The next election is scheduled for November 3, 2020 where the members of the 27th Senate of Puerto Rico will be elected. Members of the Senate are elected for a four-year term. Tony Fas Alzamora is the most senior and longest-serving senator, having served for nine consecutive terms since 1981 for a total of years.

Only American citizens (including Puerto Ricans) that meet all the following requirements may vote for senators:

* must legally reside in Puerto Rico,
* must be at least 18 years old by the date of the election,
* must have been qualified by the Puerto Rico State Commission on Elections before the election or on the very same day of the election after he presents himself to his nearest place of voting and shows proper documentation, and
* must have not been declared mentally incapacitated by court.

Citizens cast their votes in colleges () which are simply usually the nearest public school to where the voter declared as residence. Votes are required by law to be cast in secret, unless the citizen has a physical impairment that does not allow him to. Those citizens unable to travel to colleges due to medical impairments may vote at their place of residence (homes, elder homes, etc.) or wherever they are convalescing (hospitals, clinics, etc.). In both of these extraordinary cases, officials from the Puerto Rico State Commission on Elections will provide aid so that the citizens can cast their vote—either by using verbal or non-verbal communication—with members from the different political parties required to observe the process in order to ensure accuracy, fairness, transparency, order, and legitimacy.

Ballots are redacted in both Spanish and English, regardless of whether English is an official language or not.

To elect the members of the Senate, Puerto Rico is divided into eight senatorial districts, each based on a similar number of inhabitants:

These districts are in turn divided into one or more precincts: electoral divisions which are in turn divided into the aforementioned colleges. For each district, citizens may vote only for the district in which they have declared their residence, and only for two candidates per district by plurality-at-large. The two candidates with the highest votes in the respective district serve as senators for that specific district. District senators are expected to give priority to matters related to the district they represent but are not required to do so by law.

In addition, citizens are allowed to vote for one candidate at-large of their preference by single non-transferable vote. The eleven at-large candidates with the most votes serve as senators at-large alongside the district senators with the same powers and rights. Senators at-large are expected to serve any individual or group but are not required to do so by law; they also serve as a mechanism for citizens who do not wish to channel their affairs through their district senator for whatever reason.

===Term===
Senators serve terms of four years each. A member who has been elected, but not yet seated, is called a &quot;senator-elect&quot;; a member who has been appointed to a seat, but not yet seated, is called a &quot;senator-designate&quot;. The Puerto Rico Constitution does not provide for term limits and, in fact, one current senator is completing his ninth four-year term as a senator and his tenth as a legislator.

===Salary and benefits===
The annual salary for full-time work of each senator is US$73,775 annually, except for the President of the Senate which receives $110,663, and the President pro tempore, the Majority and Minority Leaders, the Majority and Minority Whips, and the presidents of the Commission on Government and the Commission on Treasury which receive $84,841 each.

Senators are allowed to generate additional income from outside their legislative employment subject to restrictions, and only the senators which do not receive an annual salary are entitled to additional benefits such as per diem or car allowance. Costs associated to traveling outside of Puerto Rico is reimbursed. Cost-of-living adjustments have been frozen since 2005. All senators qualify for the same retirement and health benefits as of all other employees of the government of Puerto Rico.

In addition, all senators are provided with office space, secretarial services, advisors, support personnel, office supplies, and stationery. Hiring of personnel working directly for each senator is at the discretion of each senator. Rather than providing these resources and services directly, senators are instead assigned a budget from which they retrieve funds to pay for these. Senators that preside commissions are assigned larger budgets than those who don&#x27;t; creating a difference between the budgets assigned to senators from the party holding a majority in the Senate versus the ones in minority as majority senators tend to be the ones that preside commissions.

==Majority and minority parties==
The &quot;Majority party&quot; is the political party that has a majority of seats. The next-largest party is known as the minority party. The president pro tempore, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party.

Whenever the elected members of the minority constitute less than nine members, the Constitution provides for the certification of additional &quot;add-on&quot; minority Senators, who will serve in an at-large capacity. Such was the case after the 2004 elections, when four defeated Popular Democratic Party (PPD) Senate candidates, one at-large, and three district candidates, were added on as at-large Senators, joining the five PPD Senators who had achieved election in their own right. This constitutional guarantee of a minimum legislative minority representation is unique to Puerto Rico among all legislatures under the American flag, incorporating an element of proportionality usually found only in proportional representation bodies.

==Officers==
The Senate is served by several officers with and without voting powers, which are elected from within and outside its ranks. Of these, only the president was established by the Constitution; all other officers were established by internal rules adopted by the Senate. Only the president and president pro tempore have voting powers as all are elected from within. Non-voting officers are elected from outside Senate ranks and simply assist in internal procedures and clerical tasks, and in the observance of internal rules, laws, and the Constitution. Typical non-voting officers include the secretary, the sergeant-at-arms, and other officers appointed by the different commissions as part of their own internal affairs.

===President of the Senate===
The president is the highest-ranking officer and the presiding officer of the Senate. The post was created by Article III of the Constitution of Puerto Rico which establishes that, &quot;The Senate shall elect a President [...] from among [its] members.&quot; The president is substituted by the president pro tempore in his absence. Its counterpart in the House is the speaker.

The current president is Thomas Rivera Schatz, senator at-large from the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico.

===President pro tempore===
The president pro tempore is the second highest-ranking officer of the Senate and substitutes the president of the House in his absence. Its counterpart in the House is the speaker pro tempore.

The current president pro tempore is Marially González Huertas, senator for District V Ponce from the Popular Democratic Party.

===Party leaders===
Each party elects floor leaders denominated &quot;majority leader&quot; or &quot;minority leader&quot;, accordingly, as well as a &quot;majority whip&quot; or a &quot;minority whip&quot;. Floor leaders act as the party chief spokespeople. The current leaders are Majority Leader Gregorio Matías Rosario, Majority Whip Juan Oscar Morales; Minority Leader Luis Javier Hernández Ortiz, Minority Whip Marially González Huertas; Minority Leader María de Lourdes Santiago; Minority Whip Adrian González Costa; Minority Leader Joan Rodríguez Vevé; and Minority Leader Eliezer Molina Pérez (write-in candidate).

===Non-member officers===
The Senate is served by two elected officials who are not members.

The Senate&#x27;s chief legislative officer is the secretary of the Senate, who maintains public records, disburses salaries, monitors the acquisition of stationery and supplies, and oversees clerks.

The other official is the sergeant-at-arms who, as the Senate&#x27;s chief law enforcement officer, maintains order and security on the Senate floor and other premises.

These officers are elected by the Senate, usually during its inaugural session, immediately after the election of the body&#x27;s president. The current secretary is Yamil Rivera Vélez while the current sergeant-at-arms is Javier Torres.

==Current composition==
The current session is the 27th Senate of Puerto Rico, the upper house of the 19th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, which will meet from January 2, 2021, to January 1, 2025. All members were elected in the general elections of 2020 with a plurality or relative majority coming from the Popular Democratic Party. The other major party, the New Progressive Party resulted with the second largest number of seats. For the first time ever, five different political parties were represented, including the two major parties, in addition to one independent candidate. The Puerto Rican Independence Party elected its traditional member At-large and the two emergent parties, &quot;Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana&quot; and &quot;Proyecto Dignidad&quot;, also elected their At-large nominees.

==Other organizations==
The Office of Legislative Services was headed in early 2009 by Kevin Rivera, while Eliezer Velázquez currently serves as Superintendent of the Capitol, the first to serve during two four-year terms.

The Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly also receives support services from the Council of State Governments (CSG), CSG&#x27;s Eastern Regional Conference, the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) and the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators (NHCSL).

<text>Daniel Garrison Brinton (May 13, 1837July 31, 1899) was an American archaeologist, ethnologist, historian, and surgeon.

==Biography==
Brinton was born in Thornbury Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Yale University in 1858, Brinton studied at Jefferson Medical College for two years and spent the next year traveling in Europe. He continued his studies at Paris and Heidelberg. From 1862 to 1865, during the American Civil War, he was a surgeon in the Union army, acting during 1864–1865 as surgeon-in-charge of the U.S. Army general hospital at Quincy, Illinois. Brinton was sun-stroked at Missionary Ridge (Third Battle of Chattanooga) and was never again able to travel in very hot weathers. This handicap affected his career as an ethnologist.

After the war, Brinton practiced medicine in West Chester, Pennsylvania for several years; was the editor of a weekly periodical, the Medical and Surgical Reporter, in Philadelphia from 1874 to 1887; became professor of ethnology and archaeology in the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia in 1884; and was professor of American linguistics and archaeology in the University of Pennsylvania from 1886 until his death.

He was a member of numerous learned societies in the United States and in Europe and was president at different times of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia, of the American Folklore Society, the American Philosophical Society, and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

At his presidential address to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in August 1895, Brinton advocated theories of scientific racism that were pervasive at that time. As Charles A. Lofgren notes in his book, &quot;The Plessy Case,&quot; although Brinton &quot;accepted the &#x27;psychical unity&#x27; throughout the human species,&quot; he claimed &quot;all races were &#x27;not equally endowed,&#x27; which disqualified [some of] them from the atmosphere of modern enlightenment.&quot; He asserted some have &quot;...an inborn tendency, constitutionally recreant to the codes of civilization, and therefore technically criminal.&quot; Further, he said the characteristics of &quot;races, nations, tribes...supply the only sure foundations for legislation, not &quot;a priori&quot; notions of the rights of man.&quot;

Brinton was an anarchist during his last several years of life. In April 1896, he addressed the Ethical Fellowship of Philadelphia with a lecture on &quot;What the Anarchists Want,&quot; to a friendly audience. In October 1897, Brinton had dinner with Peter Kropotkin after the famous anarchist&#x27;s only speaking engagement at Philadelphia. Kropotkin had refused invitations from all of the city&#x27;s elites.

On the occasion of his memorial meeting on October 6, 1900, the keynote speaker Albert H. Smyth stated: &quot;In Europe and America, he sought the society of anarchists and mingled sometimes with the malcontents of the world that he might appreciate their grievances, and weigh their propositions for reform and change.&quot;

==Works==
From 1868 to 1899, Brinton wrote many books, and a large number of pamphlets, brochures, addresses and magazine articles.
His works include:
* &quot;American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent.&quot;

* &quot;Aboriginal American authors and their productions&quot;

* &quot;Religions of Primitive People&quot; (1897)
In addition, he edited and published a Library of American Aboriginal Literature (8 vols. 1882–1890), a valuable contribution to the science of anthropology in America. Of the eight volumes; six were edited by Brinton himself, one by Horatio Hale and one by Albert Samuel Gatschet. His 1885 work is notable for its role in the Walam Olum controversy.

<text>Inge Krokann (19 August 1893–27 September 1962) was a Norwegian writer. His most famous work is &quot; I Dovre Sno &quot; (1929), an epic story of the Loe family during the Middle Ages. Because his writing was full of local expressions and is so strongly tied to the use of the Oppdal dialect and idiosyncratic Nynorsk, his works are largely inaccessible and difficult to translate.

==Biography==
Ingebrikt Krokann was born at Oppdal Municipality in Sør-Trøndelag, Norway. He was the son of Trond Jonsson Krokann (1858-1936) and Dørdi Olsdatter Lo (1859-1933). In 1915 he took his final exam at Volda lærarskule. He worked as a teacher first at the children&#x27;s school in Rennebu Municipality. During the winter of 1917–18, he got a leave to go to Askov Folk High School in Denmark, and then he took a college course in Volda Municipality. From 1920 to 1923 he taught at Skogn Folkhøgskule. He developed tuberculosis and never fully recovered. He taught at the Nordic folk college in Fredriksberg in Denmark during 1937–1938. Krokann received several travel grants and traveled to many countries in Europe and Africa.

He was married in 1921 with Gunvor Widebæk Lund (1899-1991). He died at Gausdal Municipality in Oppland county, Norway.

His work was characterized by:
* Vivid descriptions of the relationships between man and nature in the harsh environment around his birthplace of Oppdal Municipality;
* Effective and innovative use of the Oppdal dialect and nynorsk in his writing;
* A strong sense of history in his writing, tying together the pagan and Christian eras in Norwegian history.

<text>Gerry Phillips (born September 11, 1940) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario who represented the eastern Toronto riding of Scarborough—Agincourt from 1987 to 2011. He served as a cabinet minister in the governments of David Peterson and Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Phillips was educated at the University of Western Ontario&#x27;s School of Business, and worked as a managing consultant before entering public life. He worked in the marketing department of Procter &amp; Gamble, and joined the Canadian Marketing Associates organization in 1970 (becoming its President in 1977). Phillips founded the Sales Development Group in 1979 and the Retail Resource Group in 1982, and also served on the Board of Governors of the Scarborough General Hospital during this period. He served as a school trustee for eleven years on the Scarborough Board of Education and the Metropolitan Toronto School Board eventually becoming chair of both organizations.

==Politics==
He ran for the Ontario legislature as a Liberal in the provincial election of 1975, but lost to Progressive Conservative Tom Wells in Scarborough North by about 3,000 votes.

===Peterson government===
Phillips tried again in the provincial election of 1987 in the riding of Scarborough—Agincourt this time defeating his nearest opponent, David Kho of the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) by over 12,000 votes. The Liberals won a landslide majority in this election under David Peterson. On September 29, 1987, Phillips was appointed Minister of Citizenship, with responsibility for race relations, multiculturalism and the Ontario Human Rights Commission. In August 1989, he was transferred to the Ministry of Labour.


===In opposition===
The Liberals were defeated by the NDP in the provincial election of 1990, although Phillips was re-elected without difficulty in his own riding. Tory Keith MacNab finished second. In opposition, he held critic portfolios in Health, Finance and Native Affairs. In 1992, he supported Lyn McLeod&#x27;s successful campaign to become party leader.

The 1995 provincial election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Phillips only narrowly won re-election in Agincourt, defeating Keith MacNab by about 2,000 votes. Many suspected that Phillips would run for the party&#x27;s leadership when Lyn McLeod resigned in 1996, but he declined and supported Gerard Kennedy, who lost to Dalton McGuinty on the final ballot. Phillips was appointed as the party&#x27;s Deputy Leader in 1998.

He was re-elected in 1999 by nearly 3,000 votes defeating Tory MPP Jim Brown whose own nearby riding of Scarborough West was abolished in the lead-up to the election. The Progressive Conservatives won re-election across the province, and Phillips remained in opposition serving in critic roles such as Native Affairs. Phillips helped lead the fight for a public inquiry into the 1995 shooting death of protester Dudley George by members of the Ontario Provincial Police.

===McGuinty government===
The Liberal Party won a majority in the 2003 election, and Phillips was re-elected with 61% support in his riding. Phillips was appointed as Chair of the Management Board. After a cabinet shuffle on June 29, 2005, Phillips&#x27;s portfolio was restructured as the Minister of Government Services. The new Ministry took on most of the core services of the former Management Board Secretariat, Consumer and Business Services, and a large part of the Cabinet Office.

He was re-elected in the 2007 election, and was appointed Minister of Energy. In a cabinet shuffle on June 20, 2008, the Energy portfolio was given to George Smitherman. Phillips was appointed minister without portfolio and chair of cabinet.

Phillips was appointed Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure on November 9, 2009 after Smitherman resigned to enter municipal politics. On January 18, 2010, he was appointed as minister without portfolio and chair of cabinet, and also became Minister responsible for Seniors. In September 2010, the responsibility for seniors was transferred to Sophia Aggelonitis.

In 2011, he announced he would not run for re-election in the 2011 provincial election.

<doc id="1052994" wikidata="Q981113" url="?curid=1052994" title="What Are Little Girls Made Of?">
<text>&quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot; is the seventh episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series, &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Robert Bloch and directed by James Goldstone, it first aired on October 20, 1966.

In the episode, Nurse Chapel searches for her long lost fiancé and uncovers his secret plan to create sophisticated androids for galactic conquest.

The first episode of the series to be repeated on NBC, the title of the episode is taken from the fourth line of the 19th-century nursery rhyme, &quot;What Are Little Boys Made Of?&quot;

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, under the command of Captain Kirk, travels to the icy planet Exo-III to search for the exobiologist Dr. Roger Korby. Korby was the fiancé of Dr. McCoy&#x27;s temporary assistant, Nurse Christine Chapel, who signed on to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to search for Korby.

At Korby&#x27;s request, Kirk and Chapel beam down alone to a cavern entrance, but Korby is not there to meet them. Finding this suspicious, Kirk has two security officers beamed down from the Enterprise. One is instructed to stay at the entrance and keep a lookout, and the other accompanies Kirk and Chapel. The three begin to descend into a system of caves. When passing over a deep chasm, the security officer disappears. Shortly after, they meet Korby&#x27;s aide Dr. Brown. Chapel recognizes him but is surprised the man does not remember her. Brown assures them that the security officer fell by accident, and the three continue on. Kirk contacts the remaining security officer and tells him to contact the Enterprise for reinforcements, but a strange creature kills the officer before he gets the chance. Meanwhile, Kirk, Chapel and Brown find Korby, who tells them that the caves were left by an extinct race. Korby shows Kirk and Chapel machinery that creates androids. With the help of Ruk, a still-functioning android from the time of the original inhabitants, Korby has created more androids, one being a beautiful woman he calls &quot;Andrea&quot;. Brown is also an android. It is also revealed that Ruk had killed the security officers.

Korby creates an android duplicate of Kirk as Chapel looks on. As Kirk&#x27;s personality is imprinted on the android, the real Kirk imagines himself insulting Spock as a &quot;half-breed&quot;. Korby has the duplicate Kirk beamed aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; with orders to identify a planet suitable for creating more androids. When Spock questions the Kirk-android&#x27;s orders, it repeats the insult Kirk had used. Spock, realizing that this is not Kirk, forms a security team to follow the Kirk-android back down to Exo-III. Andrea encounters the Kirk-android when it returns to the planet, and thinking it is the real Kirk, destroys him when he refuses to kiss her.

The real Kirk convinces Ruk that Korby is a threat to his existence. Ruk begins to recall the clash between the &quot;Old Ones&quot; and the androids that led to his civilization&#x27;s demise centuries ago. Korby enters, and Ruk confronts him, but Korby destroys Ruk with a phaser. Shortly afterward, in a struggle with Kirk, the skin of Korby&#x27;s hand is torn, revealing that he too is an android.

It is now revealed that Korby, dying of frostbite, had transferred his mind to an android body. He begs Chapel to believe that he is still the same man, but Chapel is repelled by what he has done to himself. Andrea, realizing she loves Korby, kisses him, and in despair, Korby fires Andrea&#x27;s weapon between the embracing pair, destroying them both.

Spock arrives with the security force, but finds that the crisis has passed. When Spock inquires about Dr. Korby&#x27;s whereabouts, Kirk replies, &quot;Dr. Korby ... was never here.&quot; Chapel decides to stay on with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and finish out her tour of duty. Spock tells Kirk about his dismay of using the term &quot;half-breed&quot; to warn that something was wrong. The captain says he will remember this should he find himself in a &quot;similar situation.&quot;

==Production==
The episode was written by Robert Bloch, but received rewrites during shooting by Gene Roddenberry. The director of the second pilot &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, James Goldstone, was hired to direct this episode, but due to problems with the script, shooting went two days over schedule and Goldstone was not re-hired.

Sherry Jackson, who plays the android woman Andrea, said that they had a censor on set to make sure that her costume fully covered her breasts and that side cleavage was not visible. She also said of William Shatner, &quot;I must say when he kissed me on screen, he really kissed me!&quot; and that Shatner&#x27;s chest had to be shaved for his nude scenes in the android machine because Gene Roddenberry felt that Captain Kirk would not be hairy.

Reference to the works of H. P. Lovecraft was briefly made in Bloch&#x27;s script, with its mention of &quot;the Old Ones&quot; and the look of the trapezoidal doors in the caverns.

==Reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &quot;B+&quot; rating, noting that the &quot;repetitive plotting&quot; took away any real sense of threat and that without Spock or McCoy to play off, Kirk&#x27;s character is less interesting.

<text>Corte de&#x27; Frati (Cremunés: ) is a municipality (&quot;comune)&quot; in the province of Cremona, in the Lombardy Italian region.

== History ==
The main history of Corte de&#x27; Frati is related to the establishment of the Court of Alfiano. In fact, the original name of the municipality was Court of Alfiano, a name referring to a patrician family who owned these lands.

=== 10th century ===
After the extinction of the Carolingian and the Saxon dynasty, the 10th century was the era of castles and fortress, and the population had to face wars provoked by the Counts. From 950 to 1000, the &quot;Bresciani and &quot;Cremonesi&quot; Counts fought among the lands of the river Oglio, near Bordolano and Canneto, &quot;because the &quot;Bresciani&quot; imposed taxes on the Cremonesi&#x27;s lands. During this period, the castle of Corte De&#x27; Frati was born, but now it does not exist anymore&quot;.&quot;

On 1004, Henry II conquered Brescia and the Court of Alfiano belonged to the Santa Giulia Monastery in Brescia.

=== 13th century ===
During the 13th century, a bridge was built by the &quot;Cremonesi&quot; people near Grumone, a &quot;frazione&quot; of the nowadays Corte de&#x27; Frati, in order not to pay the toll bridge enforced by the &quot;Bresciani&quot; on the bridge of Pontevico. This new project gave life to a war between the two dynasties: in 1213 the &quot;Bresciani&quot; ordered to the &quot;Cremonesi&quot; that the bridge was to be destroyed because it was built on the Brescian territory. The bridge, however, was not destroyed until 1228, when Alfiano was assaulted by an armed conflict between &quot;Bresciani&quot; and &quot;Cremonesi&quot;, during which the majority of warriors died and those who survived were imprisoned. Afterwards, the two dynasties did not resume their hostilities for a long time because in 1237 the territory was occupied by Frederick II, who used the contested bridge to move easily around Cremonese territory.

In the first half of the 13th century, under the pontificate of Pope Innocent III, the Italian religious order of Humiliati was born and in 1246 they held the Saint Abbondio Church in Cremona. The Humiliati also took possession of Alfiano, whose name was transformed into Corte de&#x27; Frati.

=== 14th century ===
During the 14th century, the raids by the &quot;Bresciani&quot; on the territory started again, and the &quot;Cremonesi&quot;&#x27;s raids were mostly done in Pontevico. The city of Cremona strengthened the cities near the Oglio river to avoid new conflicts.

In 1324, Louis IV reconfirmed to the &quot;Cremonesi&quot; all the privileges and rights previously granted by their predecessors. This event led to new hostilities and disagreements with the &quot;Bresciani&quot;. Facing a rivalry that was never going to end, the archbishop of Milan Giovanni Visconti issued a law stating that the toll fee of Pontevico&#x27;s bridge was unmodifiable.

=== 15th century ===
The beginning of the 15th century faced a new armed conflict between the lord of Brescia Pandolfo Malatesta, and the lord of Cremona Cabrino Fondulo. Pandolfo came to the Cremonese territory with an army and took possession of Robecco, Alfiano, Corte de&#x27; Frati and other villages near the Oglio river. In 1413 a peace treaty was signed and the Cremonesi reclaimed their lands. At the end of the century, however, the Republic of Venice conquered Brescia and Cremona.

=== 17th century ===
After the suppression of the Humiliati at the beginning of the 17th century, in 1614 the pope Paul V ordered the establishment of the Perpetual Vicar. In this period the world was facing the bubonic plague, and in 1630 Corte de&#x27; Frati registered 253 deaths, which was a high number considering that the inhabitants were only 1,000. Facing a high number of deaths, the parish decided to build a new cemetery, because the bodies used to be buried near to the church.

In 1648, a trench called &quot;Trincerone&quot; was built by the Marquis Caracena, governor of Milan, to avoid the siege of Cremona by the French. It started from Cremona and ended in Grumone, and it was 10 miles long. In the same year, however, the &quot;Cremonesi&quot; managed to free the city from the French siege.

The municipality of Pontevico persisted with the toll bridge, and this inevitably led people coming from the Cremonese territory to use the river from Alfiano to avoid the tax fee. In April 1671 the city of Brescia issued a proclamation suspending the use of the river as a way to avoid the Pontevico&#x27;s bridge.

In 1683 the present-day church of Corte de&#x27; Frati was built above the old castle&#x27;s foundation. 
=== 18th century ===
At the beginning of the 18th century, the municipality was hit by a very high mortality rate of bovine animals. Meanwhile, the lands of Grumone, Corte de&#x27; Frati and Robecco were continuously damaged by the raids. From 1777 to 1780 there was a high rate of famine, and the century ended again with an epizootic.

=== 19th century ===
The 19th century started with the French conquering Cremona and its territories, and they also took refuge on Corte de&#x27; Frati for three months. In 1802 an earthquake hit the municipality and the church was damaged. During these period, thanks to Napoleon, the streets were fixed and a postal service was activated. Corte de&#x27; Frati, Alfiano, and Aspice relied on the municipality of Robecco.

In 1816 there was a high rate of drought that led to famine, and the following year the petechial typhus was spreading through the peasants. This disease was probably caused by the previously mentioned famine, and the deaths were almost 150. In 1867 a cholera outbreak was registered once again. In the same year, the rail line Cremona-Brescia was built, and the river Oglio lost his main function of trade exchange.

== Economy ==

The local economy is mostly based on agriculture and industrial activities. The territory is well known for its dairy farms and for its metal industry. Food is related to the city of Cremona, including salted meat, Grana Padano and different types of local fruits and vegetables coming from the local farms.

== Transport ==

Corte de&#x27; Frati is linked both to the city of Cremona and to the city of Brescia, thanks to the bus service offered in the area.

== Notes ==
:1. Bresciani and Cremonesi are two demonyms identifying people living in the province of Brescia or Cremona.

<text>The [[Paul Scherrer]] Institute (PSI) is a multi-disciplinary research institute for natural and engineering sciences in Switzerland. It is located in the Canton of Aargau in the municipalities Villigen and Würenlingen on either side of the River Aare, and covers an area over 35 hectares in size. Like ETH Zurich and EPFL, PSI belongs to the ETH Domain of the Swiss Confederation. The PSI employs around 3000 people. It conducts basic and applied research in the fields of matter and materials, human health, and energy and the environment. About 37% of PSI&#x27;s research activities focus on material sciences, 24% on life sciences, 19% on general energy, 11% on nuclear energy and safety, and 9% on particle physics.

PSI develops, builds and operates large and complex research facilities and makes them available to the national and international scientific communities. In 2017, for example, more than 2,500 researchers from 60 different countries came to PSI to take advantage of the concentration of large-scale research facilities in the same location, which is unique worldwide. About 1,900 experiments are conducted each year at the approximately 40 measuring stations in these facilities.

In recent years, the institute has been one of the largest recipients of money from the Swiss lottery fund.

==History==
The institute, named after the Swiss physicist Paul Scherrer, was created in 1988 when EIR (&quot;Eidgenössisches Institut für Reaktorforschung&quot;, Swiss Federal Institute for Reactor Research, founded in 1960) was merged with SIN (&quot;Schweizerisches Institut für Nuklearphysik&quot;, Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research, founded in 1968). The two institutes on opposite sides of the River Aare served as national centres for research: one focusing on nuclear energy and the other on nuclear and particle physics. Over the years, research at the centres expanded into other areas, and nuclear and reactor physics accounts for just 11 percent of the research work at PSI today. Since Switzerland decided in 2011 to phase out nuclear energy, this research has primarily been concerned with questions of safety, such as how to store radioactive waste safely in a deep geological repository.
Since 1984, PSI has operated (initially as SIN) the centre for Proton Therapy for treating patients with eye melanomas and other tumours located deep inside the body. More than 9,000 patients have been treated there until now (status 2020).

The institute is also active in space research. For example, in 1990 PSI engineers built the detector of the EUVITA telescope for the Russian satellite Spectrum X-G, and later also supplied NASA and ESA with detectors to analyse radiation in space. In 1992, physicists used accelerator mass spectrometry and radiocarbon methods to determine the age of Ötzi, the mummy found in a glacier in the Ötztal Alps a year earlier, from small samples of just a few milligrams of bone, tissue and grass. They were analysed at the TANDEM accelerator on the Hönggerberg near Zurich, which at the time was jointly operated by ETH Zurich and PSI.

In 2009, the Indian-born British structural biologist Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for, among other things, his research at the Synchrotron Light Source Switzerland (SLS). The SLS is one of PSI&#x27;s four large-scale research facilities. His investigations there enabled Ramakrishnan to clarify what ribosomes look like and how they function at the level of individual molecules. Using the information encoded in the genes, ribosomes produce proteins that control many chemical processes in living organisms.

In 2010, an international team of researchers at PSI used negative muons to perform a new measurement of the proton and found that its radius is significantly smaller than previously thought: 0.84184 femtometers instead of 0.8768. According to press reports, this result was not only surprising, it could also call previous models in physics into question. The measurements were only possible with PSI&#x27;s 590 MeV proton accelerator HIPA because its secondarily generated muon beam is the only one worldwide that is intense enough to conduct the experiment.

In 2011, researchers from PSI and elsewhere succeeded in deciphering the basic structure of the protein molecule rhodopsin with the help of the SLS. This optical pigment acts as a kind of light sensor and plays a decisive role in the process of sight.

A so-called ‘barrel pixel detector’ built at PSI was a central element in the CMS detector at the Geneva nuclear research centre CERN, and was thus involved in detecting the Higgs boson. This discovery, announced on 4 July 2012, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics one year later.

In January 2016, 20 kilograms of plutonium were taken from PSI to the USA. According to a newspaper report, the federal government had a secret plutonium storage facility in which the material had been kept since the 1960s to construct an atomic bomb as planned at the time. The Federal Council denied this, maintaining the plutonium-239 content of the material was below 92 percent, which meant it was not weapons-grade material. The idea was rather to use the material obtained from reprocessed fuel rods of the Diorit research reactor, which was operated from 1960 to 1977, to develop a new generation of fuel element types for nuclear power plants. This, however, never happened. By the time it was decided, in 2011, to phase out nuclear power, it had become clear that there was no further use for the material in Switzerland. The Federal Council decided at the Nuclear Security Summit in 2014 to close the Swiss plutonium storage facility. A bilateral agreement between the two countries meant the plutonium could then be transferred to the US for further storage.

In July 2017, the three-dimensional alignment of magnetization inside a three-dimensional magnetic object was investigated and visualized with the help of the SLS without affecting the material. The technology is expected to be useful in developing better magnets, for example for motors or data storage.

Joël François Mesot, the long-standing Director of PSI (2008 to 2018), was elected President of ETH Zurich at the end of 2018. His post was temporarily taken over by the physicist and PSI Chief of Staff Thierry Strässle from January 2019. Since 1 April 2020, the physicist Christian Rüegg has been Director of PSI. He was previously head of the PSI research division Neutrons and Muons.

Numerous PSI spin-off companies have been founded over the years to make the research findings available to the wider society. The largest spin-off, with 120 employees, is the DECTRIS AG, founded in 2006 in nearby Baden, which specializes in the development and marketing of X-ray detectors. SwissNeutronics AG in Klingnau, which sells optical components for neutron research facilities, was founded as early as 1999. Several recent PSI offshoots, such as the manufacturer of metal-organic frameworks novoMOF or the drug developer leadXpro, have settled close to PSI in the Park Innovaare, which was founded in 2015 with the support of several companies and Canton Aargau.

==Research Areas and Departments==
PSI develops, builds and operates several accelerator facilities, e. g. a 590 MeV high-current cyclotron, which in normal operation supplies a beam current of about 2.2 mA. PSI also operates four large-scale research facilities: a synchrotron light source (SLS), which is particularly brilliant and stable, a spallation neutron source (SINQ), a muon source (SμS) and an X-ray free-electron laser (SwissFEL). This makes PSI currently (2020) the only institute in the world to provide the four most important probes for researching the structure and dynamics of condensed matter (neutrons, muons and synchrotron radiation) on a campus for the international user community. In addition, HIPA&#x27;s target facilities also produce pions that feed the muon source and the Ultracold Neutron source UCN produces very slow, ultracold neutrons. All these particle types are used for research in particle physics.
Research at PSI is conducted with the help of these facilities. Its focus areas include:

===Matter and Material===
All the materials humans work with are made up of atoms. The interaction of atoms and their arrangement determine the properties of a material. Most of the researchers in the field of matter and materials at PSI want to find out more about how the internal structure of different materials relates to their observable properties. Fundamental research in this area contributes to the development of new materials with a wide range of applications, for example in electrical engineering, medicine, telecommunications, mobility, new energy storage systems, quantum computers and spintronics. The phenomena investigated include superconductivity, ferro- and antiferromagnetism, spin fluids and topological insulators.

Neutrons are intensively used for materials research at PSI because they enable unique and non-destructive access to the interior of materials on a scale ranging from the size of atoms to objects a centimetre long. They therefore serve as ideal probes for investigating fundamental and applied research topics, such as quantum spin systems and their potential for application in future computer technologies, the functionalities of complex lipid membranes and their use for the transport and targeted release of drug substances, as well as the structure of novel materials for energy storage as key components in intelligent energy networks.

In particle physics, PSI researchers are investigating the structure and properties of the innermost layers of matter and what holds them together. Muons, pions and ultra-cold neutrons are used to test the Standard Model of elementary particles, to determine fundamental natural constants and to test theories that go beyond the Standard Model. Particle physics at PSI holds many records, including the most precise determination of the coupling constants of the weak interaction and the most accurate measurement of the charge radius of the proton. Some experiments aim to find effects that are not foreseen in the Standard Model, but which could correct inconsistencies in the theory or solve unexplained phenomena from astrophysics and cosmology. Their results so far agree with the Standard Model. Examples include the upper limit measured in the MEG experiment of the hypothetical decay of positive muons into positrons and photons as well as that of the permanent electric dipole moment for neutrons.

Muons are not only useful in particle physics, but also in solid-state physics and materials science. The muon spin spectroscopy method (μSR) is used to investigate the fundamental properties of magnetic and superconducting materials as well as of semiconductors, insulators and semiconductor structures, including technologically relevant applications such as for solar cells.

===Energy and the Environment===
PSI researchers are addressing all aspects of energy use with the aim to make energy supplies more sustainable. Focus areas include: new technologies for renewable energies, low-loss energy storage, energy efficiency, low-pollution combustion, fuel cells, experimental and model-based assessment of energy and material cycles, environmental impacts of energy production and consumption, and nuclear energy research, in particular reactor safety and waste management.

PSI operates the ESI (Energy System Integration) experimental platform to answer specific questions on seasonal energy storage and sector coupling. The platform can be used in research and industry to test promising approaches to integrating renewable energies into the energy system – for example, storing excess electricity from solar or wind power in the form of hydrogen or methane.

At PSI a method for extracting significantly more methane gas from biowaste was developed and successfully tested with the help of the ESI platform together with the Zurich power company Energie 360°. The team was awarded the Watt d&#x27;Or 2018 of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy.

A platform for catalyst research is also maintained at PSI. Catalysis is a central component in various energy conversion processes, for example in fuel cells, water electrolysis and the methanation of carbon dioxide.

To test the pollutant emissions of various energy production processes and the behaviour of the corresponding substances in the atmosphere, PSI also operates a smog chamber.

Another area of research at PSI is on the effects of energy production on the atmosphere locally, including in the Alps, in the polar regions of the Earth and in China.
The Nuclear Energy and Safety Division is dedicated to maintaining a good level of nuclear expertise and thus to training scientists and engineers in nuclear energy. For example, PSI maintains one of the few laboratories in Europe for investigating fuel rods in commercial reactors. The division works closely with ETH Zurich, EPFL and the University of Bern, using, for example, their high-performance computers or the CROCUS research reactor at EPFL.

===Human health===
PSI is one of the leading institutions worldwide in the research and application of proton therapy for the treatment of cancer. Since 1984, the Center for Proton Therapy has been successfully treating cancer patients with a special form of radiation therapy. To date, more than 7500 patients with ocular tumours have been irradiated (status 2020). The success rate for eye therapy using the OPTIS facility is over 98 percent.

In 1996, an irradiation unit (Gantry 1) was equipped for the first time to use the so-called spot-scanning proton technique developed at PSI. With this technique, tumours deep inside the body are scanned three-dimensionally with a proton beam about 5 to 7 mm in width. By superimposing many individual proton spots – about 10,000 spots per litre volume – the tumour is evenly exposed to the necessary radiation dose, which is monitored individually for each spot. This allows an extremely precise, homogeneous irradiation that is optimally adapted to the usually irregular shape of the tumour. The technique enables as much as possible of the surrounding healthy tissue to be spared. The first gantry was in operation for patients from 1996 to the end of 2018. In 2013, the second Gantry 2, developed at PSI, went into operation, and in mid-2018 another treatment station, Gantry 3, was opened.

In the field of radiopharmacy, PSI&#x27;s infrastructure covers the entire spectrum. In particular, PSI researchers are tackling very small tumours distributed throughout the body. These cannot be treated with the usual radiotherapy techniques. New medically applicable radionuclides have, however, been produced with the help of the proton accelerators and the neutron source SINQ at PSI. When combined for therapy with special biomolecules (antibodies), therapeutic molecules can be formed to selectively and specifically detect tumour cells. These are then labelled with a radioactive isotope. Its radiation can be localized with imaging techniques such as SPECT or PET, which enables the diagnosis of tumours and their metastases. Moreover, it can be dosed so that it also destroys the tumour cells. Several such radioactive substances have been developed at PSI. They are currently being tested in clinical trials, in close cooperation with universities, clinics and the pharmaceutical industry. PSI also supplies local hospitals with radiopharmaceuticals if required.

Since the opening of the Synchrotron Light Source Switzerland (SLS), structural biology has been a further focus of research in the field of human health. Here, the structure and function of biomolecules are being investigated – preferably at atomic resolution. The PSI researchers are primarily concerned with proteins. Every living cell needs a myriad of these molecules in order, for example, to be able to metabolise, receive and transmit signals or to divide. The aim is to understand these life processes better and thus to be able to treat or prevent diseases more effectively.

For example, PSI is investigating the structure of microtubules, filamentous structures which, among other things, pull apart chromosomes during cell division. They consist of long protein chains. When chemotherapy is used to treat cancer, it disturbs the assembly or breakdown of these chains so that the cancer cells can no longer divide. Researchers are closely observing the structure of these proteins and how they change to find out exactly where cancer drugs have to attack the microtubules. With the help of PSI&#x27;s SwissFEL free-electron X-ray laser, which was inaugurated in 2016, researchers have been able to analyse dynamic processes in biomolecules with extremely high time resolution – less than a trillionth of a second (picosecond). For example, they have detected how certain proteins in the photoreceptors of the retina of our eyes are activated by light.

==Accelerators and large research facilities at PSI==
===Proton accelerator facility===
While PSI&#x27;s proton accelerator, which went into service in 1974, was primarily used in the early days for elementary particle physics, today the focus is on applications for solid-state physics, radiopharmaceuticals and cancer therapy. Since it started operating, it has been constantly developed further, and its performance today is as much as 2.4 mA, which is 24 times higher than the initial 100 μA. This is why the facility is now considered a high-performance proton accelerator, or HIPA (High Intensity Proton Accelerator) for short. Basically, it consists of three accelerators in series: the Cockcroft-Walton, the injector-2 cyclotron, and the ring-cyclotron. They accelerate the protons to around 80 percent of the speed of light.

====Proton source and Cockcroft-Walton====
In a proton source based on cyclotron resonance, microwaves are used to strip electrons from hydrogen atoms. What remains are the hydrogen atomic nuclei, each consisting of only one proton. These protons leave the source with a potential of 60 kilovolts and are then subjected to a further voltage of 810 kilovolts in an accelerator tube. Both voltages are supplied by a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator. With a total of 870 kilovolts, the protons are accelerated to a speed of 46 million km/h or 4 percent of the speed of light. The protons are then fed into the Injector-2.

=====Injector-1=====
With Injector-1, operating currents of 170 μA and peak currents of 200 μA could be reached. It was also used for low energy experiments, for OPTIS eye therapy and for the LiSoR experiment in the MEGAPIE project. Since December 1, 2010, this ring accelerator has been out of operation.

=====Injector-2=====
The Injector-2, which was commissioned in 1984 and developed by what was then SIN, replaced the Injector-1 as the injection machine for the 590 MeV ring cyclotron. Initially, it was possible to operate Injector-1 and Injector-2 alternately, but now only Injector-2 is used to feed the proton beam into the ring. The new cyclotron has enabled an increase in the beam current from 1 to 2 mA, which was the absolute record value for the 1980s. Today, the injector-2 delivers a beam current of ≈ 2.2 mA in routine operation and 2.4 mA in high current operation at 72 MeV, which is about 38 percent of the speed of light.

Originally, two resonators were operated at 150 MHz in flat-top mode to enable a clear separation of the proton orbits, but these are now also used for acceleration. Part of the extracted 72 MeV proton beam can be split off for isotope production, while the main part is fed into the Ring Cyclotron for further acceleration.

=====Ring=====
Like the Injector-2, the Ring Cyclotron, which has a circumference of about 48 m, went into operation in 1974. It was specially developed at SIN and is at the heart of the PSI proton accelerator facilities. The protons are accelerated to 80 percent of the speed of light on the approximately 4 km long track, which the protons cover inside the ring in 186 laps. This corresponds to a kinetic energy of 590 MeV. Only three such rings exist worldwide, namely: TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada; LAMPF in Los Alamos, USA; and the one at PSI. TRIUMF has only reached beam currents of 500 μA and LAMPF 1 mA.

In addition to the four original Cavities, a smaller fifth cavity was added in 1979. It is operated at 150 megahertz as a flat-top cavity, and has enabled a significant increase in the number of extracted particles. Since 2008 all the old aluminium cavities of the Ring Cyclotron have been replaced with new copper cavities. These allow higher voltage amplitudes and thus a greater acceleration of the protons per revolution. The number of revolutions of the protons in the cyclotron could thus be reduced from approx. 200 to 186, and the distance travelled by the protons in the cyclotron decreased from 6 km to 4 km. With a beam current of 2.2 mA, this proton facility at PSI is currently the most powerful continuous particle accelerator in the world. The 1.3 MW strong proton beam is directed towards the muon source (SμS) and the spallation neutron source (SINQ).

===Swiss Muon Source (SμS)===
In the middle of the large experimental hall, the proton beam of the Ring Cyclotron collides with two targets – rings of carbon. During the collisions of the protons with the atomic carbon nuclei, pions are first formed and then decay into muons after about 26 billionths of a second. Magnets then direct these muons to instruments used in materials science and particle physics. Thanks to the Ring Cyclotron&#x27;s enormously high proton current, the muon source is able to generate the world&#x27;s most intense muon beams. These enable researchers to conduct experiments in particle physics and materials science that cannot be carried out anywhere else.

The Swiss Muon Source (SμS) has seven beamlines that scientists can use to investigate various aspects of modern physics. Some materials scientists use them for muon spin spectroscopy experiments. PSI is the only place in the world where a muon beam of sufficient intensity is available at a very low energy of only a few kiloelectron volts – thanks to the Muon Source&#x27;s high muon intensity and a special process. The resulting muons are slow enough to be used to analyse thin layers of material and surfaces. Six measuring stations (FLAME (from 2021), DOLLY, GPD, GPS, HAL-9500, and LEM) with instruments for a wide range of applications are available for such investigations.

Particle physicists are using some of the beamlines to perform high-precision measurements to test the limits of the Standard Model.

===Swiss Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ)===
The neutron source SINQ, which has been in operation since 1996, was the first, and is still the strongest, of its kind. It delivers a continuous neutron flux of 1014 n cm−2s−1. In SINQ the protons from the large particle accelerator strike a lead target and knock the neutrons out of the lead nuclei, making them available for experiments. In addition to thermal neutrons, a moderator made of liquid deuterium also enables the production of slow neutrons, which have a lower energy spectrum.

The MEGAPIE Target (Megawatt Pilot-Experiment) came into operation in summer 2006. By replacing the solid target with a target made of a lead-bismuth eutectic, the neutron yield could be increased by about another 80%.

Since it would be very costly to dispose of the MEGAPIE target, PSI decided in 2009 not to produce another such target and instead to develop the solid target further as it had already proven its worth. Based on the findings from the MEGAPIE project, it was possible to obtain almost as large an increase in neutron yield for operation with a solid target.

SINQ was one of the first facilities to use specially developed optical guide systems to transport slow neutrons. Metal-coated glass conduits guide neutrons over longer distances (a few tens of metres) by means of total reflection, analogous to the light guidance in glass fibres, with a low loss of intensity. The efficiency of these neutron guides has steadily increased with advances in manufacturing technology. This is why PSI decided to carry out a comprehensive upgrade in 2019. When SINQ goes back into operation in summer 2020, it will be able to provide, on average, five times more neutrons for experiments, and in a special case, even 30 times more.

SINQ&#x27;s 15 instruments are not only used for PSI research projects but are also available for national and international users.

===Ultracold Neutron Source (UCN)===
Since 2011, PSI has also been operating a second spallation neutron source for the generation of ultracold neutrons (UCN). Unlike SINQ, it is pulsed and uses HIPA&#x27;s full beam, but normally only for 8 seconds every 5 minutes. The design is similar to that of SINQ. In order to cool down the neutrons, however, it uses frozen deuterium at a temperature of 5 Kelvin (corresponding to −268 degrees Celsius) as a cold moderator. The UCN generated can be stored in the facility and observed for a few minutes in experiments.

===COMET cyclotron===
This superconducting 250 MeV cyclotron has been in operation for proton therapy since 2007 and provides the beam for treating tumours in cancer patients. It was the first superconducting cyclotron worldwide to be used for proton therapy. Previously, part of the proton beam from the Ring Cyclotron was split off for this purpose, but since 2007 the medical facility has been producing its own proton beam independently, which supplies several irradiation stations for therapy. Other components of the facility, the peripheral equipment and the control systems have also been improved in the meantime, so that today the facility is available over 98 percent of the time with more than 7000 operating hours per year.

===Swiss Light Source (SLS)===

The Swiss Light Source (SLS), an electron synchrotron, has been in operation since 1 August 2001. It works like a kind of combined X-ray machine and microscope to screen a wide variety of substances. In the circular structure, the electrons move on a circular path 288 m in circumference, emitting synchrotron radiation in a tangential direction. A total of 350 magnets hold the electron beam on its course and focus it. Acceleration cavities ensure that the beam&#x27;s speed remains constant.

Since 2008, the SLS has been the accelerator with the thinnest electron beam in the world. PSI researchers and technicians have been working on this for eight years and have repeatedly adjusted each of the many magnets. The SLS offers a very broad spectrum of synchrotron radiation from infrared light to hard X-rays. This enables researchers to take microscopic pictures inside objects, materials and tissue to, for example, improve materials or develop drugs.

In 2017, a new instrument at the SLS made it possible to look inside a computer chip for the first time without destroying it. Structures such as 45 nanometre narrow power lines and 34 nanometre high transistors became visible. This technology enables chip manufacturers to, for example, check whether their products comply with the specifications more easily.

Currently, under the working title &quot;SLS 2.0&quot;, plans are being made to upgrade the SLS and thus create a fourth-generation synchrotron light source.

===SwissFEL===

The SwissFEL free-electron laser was officially opened on 5 December 2016 by the Federal Councillor Johann Schneider-Ammann. In 2018, the first beamline ARAMIS came into operation. The second beamline ATHOS is scheduled to follow in autumn 2020. Worldwide, only four comparable facilities are in operation.

==Training Centre==
The PSI Education Centre has over 30 years of experience in training and providing further education in technical and interdisciplinary fields. It trains over 3,000 participants annually.

The centre offers a wide range of basic and advanced training courses for both professionals and others working with ionising radiation or radioactive materials. The courses, in which participants acquire the relevant expertise, are recognised by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI).

It also runs basic and advanced training courses for PSI&#x27;s staff and interested individuals from the ETH Domain. Since 2015, courses on human resources development (such as conflict management, leadership workshops, communication and transferable skills) have also been held.
The quality of the PSI Education Centre is certified (ISO 29990:2001).

==Cooperation with industry==
PSI holds about 100 active patent families in, for example, medicine, with investigation techniques for proton therapy against cancer or for the detection of prions, the cause of mad cow disease. Other patent families are in the field of photoscience, with special lithography processes for structuring surfaces, in the environmental sciences for recycling rare earths, for catalysts or for the gasification of biomass, in the materials sciences and in other fields. PSI maintains its own technology transfer office for patents.

Patents have, for example, been granted for detectors used in high-performance X-ray cameras developed for the Swiss Synchrotron Light Source SLS, which can be used to investigate materials at the atomic level. These provided the basis for founding the company DECTRIS, the largest spin-off to date to emerge from PSI. In 2017, the Lausanne-based company Debiopharm licensed the active substance 177Lu-PSIG-2, which was developed at the Centre for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences at PSI. This substance is effective in treating a type of thyroid cancer. It is to be further developed under the name DEBIO 1124 with the aim to have it approved and get it ready for market launch. Another PSI spin-off, GratXray, works with a method based on phase contrasts in lattice interferometry. The method was originally developed to characterize synchrotron radiation and is expected to become the gold standard in screening for breast cancer. The new technology has already been used in a prototype that PSI developed in collaboration with Philips.

<text>A sea-king (&quot;sækonungr&quot;) in the Norse sagas is generally a title given to a powerful Viking chieftain, even though the term sea-king may sometimes predate the Viking age.

The Orkneyinga saga contains the earliest reference to sea-kings. There the original line of &#x27;kings&#x27; of Kvenland (present-day Finland) ends with the father of Gor Thorrasson &#x27;Sea King&#x27;. The appellation of &#x27;Sea King&#x27; to subsequent names, from Gor to his great-grandson, Sveidi, suggests that they lose or surrender their inheritance as Kven kings and rule the seas instead, eventually ending up as minor lords in Norway.

Sea-kings could also be independent or noble Norwegian and Danish chieftains, and also kings of Sweden (such as Yngvi and Jorund), or sons of kings, such as Refil. However, they could also be men &quot;without roof&quot; like Hjörvard the Ylfing; such men without roof could be so powerful that they could subdue a country and make themselves kings. Two examples are Sölve who killed the Swedish king Östen, and Haki who killed the Swedish king Hugleik. However, in both cases they ultimately lost due to lack of popular support.

<text>Meta Content Framework (MCF) is a specification of a content format for structuring metadata about web sites and other data.

==History==
MCF was developed by Ramanathan V. Guha at Apple Computer&#x27;s Advanced Technology Group between 1995 and 1997. Rooted in knowledge-representation systems such as CycL, KRL, and KIF, it sought to describe objects, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

One application of MCF was HotSauce, also developed by Guha while at Apple. It generated a 3D visualization of a web site&#x27;s table of contents, based on MCF descriptions. By late 1996, a few hundred sites were creating MCF files and Apple HotSauce allowed users to browse these MCF representations in 3D.

When the research project was discontinued, Guha left Apple for Netscape, where, in collaboration with Tim Bray, he adapted MCF to use XML and created the first version of the Resource Description Framework (RDF).

== MCF format ==
An MCF file consists of one or more blocks, each corresponding to an entity. A block looks like this:
Node: &lt;identifier&gt;
&lt;property&gt;: &lt;value&gt;, &lt;value&gt;
The identifier is a unique identifier for that entity (more on the scope of the identifier below) and is used to refer to that entity. The following lines each specify a property and one or more values, separated by commas. Each value can be a reference to another entity (via its identifier), a string (enclosed by double quotes) or a number. For example:
Node: Test1
typeOf: TestNode
child: Test2, Test3
name: &quot;I am a test node&quot;
itemCode: 42

Node: Test2
typeOf: TestNode
sibling: Test3
name: &quot;I am another test node in a test world&quot;

Node: Test3
typeOf: TestNode
sibling: Test2
name: &quot;Just another test node in a test world&quot;
NOTE: 

* The identifier must not include a comma (codice_1) and must not be enclosed within double quotes.
* A common parsing failure is due to odd number of unescaped double quotes in text. For instance, codice_2 needs to be codice_3.
* Commas within double quotes are not considered as value separators.
* Every entity has at least one property: codice_4.

<text>The Lamnidae are the family of mackerel sharks known as white sharks. They are large, fast-swimming predatory fish found in oceans worldwide, though they prefer environments with colder water. The name of the family is formed from the Greek word &quot;lamna&quot;, which means &quot;fish of prey&quot;, and was derived from the Greek legendary creature, the Lamia.

These sharks have pointed snouts, spindle-shaped bodies, and large gill openings. The first dorsal fin is large, high, stiff and angular or somewhat rounded. The second dorsal and anal fins are minute. The caudal peduncle has a couple of less distinct keels. The teeth are gigantic. The fifth gill opening is in front of the pectoral fin and spiracles are sometimes absent. They are powerful, heavily built sharks, sometimes weighing nearly twice as much as other sharks of comparable length from other families. Many sharks in the family are among the fastest-swimming fish, although the massive great white shark is slower due to its large size.

<text>Wireless Application Protocol Bitmap Format (shortened to Wireless Bitmap and with file extension .wbmp) is a raster image file format optimized for early mobile computing devices.

WBMP images are monochrome black and white binary images in which a black pixel is denoted by 0 and a white pixel is denoted by 1. The simple pixel encoding and the small size of the file header mean that the file size is kept to a minimum, enabling fast transmission on slow networks.

<doc id="1053042" wikidata="Q1775679" url="?curid=1053042" title="Connie Morella">
<text>Constance Morella (; née Albanese; born February 12, 1931) is an American politician and diplomat. She represented in the United States House of Representatives from 1987 to 2003. She served as Permanent Representative from the U.S. to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) from 2003 to 2007. She is on American University&#x27;s faculty as an Ambassador in Residence for the Women &amp; Politics Institute. She was appointed to the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) by President Barack Obama in 2010.

==Early life==
She was born Constance Albanese in Somerville, Massachusetts. After graduating from Somerville High School in 1948, she attended Boston University, where she earned an Associate of Arts in 1950 and a Bachelor of Arts in 1954. Although she was raised in a family of blue-collar Democrats, she became a Republican after meeting Anthony C. Morella, who had worked for liberal Republicans John Lindsay, Nelson Rockefeller, Charles Mathias, and others. After they wed, the couple moved to Bethesda, Maryland. After Connie Morella&#x27;s sister died of cancer, Tony and Connie Morella adopted her six children to join their own three children.

Morella became a secondary school teacher in Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland from 1957 to 1961. She graduated from American University with an M.A. in 1967 and was an instructor there from 1968 to 1970, when she became a professor at Montgomery College in Rockville, Maryland. She continued to teach until 1985, when she left teaching to fully focus on her political career.

== Political career ==
In 1971 Morella was appointed as a founding member to the Montgomery County Commission for Women, an advisory women&#x27;s advocacy body, and she was elected its president in 1973. She became active in the League of Women Voters. In 1974, she ran for the Maryland House of Delegates from the 16th District (Bethesda), but did not win. She ran again in 1978, winning the seat and receiving more votes than the three previous incumbents. She was reelected for an additional term, before running for United States Congress.

===Congressional career===
In 1986, Morella ran for the open Congressional seat in Maryland&#x27;s 8th congressional district. The district was being vacated by Democrat Michael Barnes, who was running for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. Morella&#x27;s opponent in the general election was State Senator Stewart Bainum, a multimillionaire business executive who consistently outpolled her throughout most of the campaign.

A major turning point came when Morella unexpectedly won endorsements from &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. She was the first woman to hold this seat. Although she was a Republican in an area that had become heavily Democratic, she proved highly popular among her constituents and won re-election seven times, serving until 2002.

Morella opposes her party&#x27;s positions on abortion, gun control, gay rights, and the environmental movement, voted for government funding of contraceptives and needle exchange programs for drug addicts, and favored the legalization of medical marijuana. She received some support from organized labor and opposed many tax cuts. Morella, however, voted against President Clinton&#x27;s 1993 budget, as all other Congressional Republicans did. She voted against declaring English the official language of the United States and, in 1996, against a bill overwhelmingly approved by Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton to combat illegal immigration.

In 1996, Morella was one of only five Republicans to vote against the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. In 1998, she was one of only three Republicans to vote against renaming the Washington National Airport the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Morella was the only Republican in the entire Congress to have voted against approving the use of military force in Iraq in 1991 and again in 2002. She was active in human rights, women&#x27;s health, and domestic violence issues in Congress, and served on the Science and Government Reform Committees.

Morella was U.S. representative to the 1994 U.N. International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo and co-chair of the Congressional delegation to the 1995 U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. Among the legislation she sponsored were the 1992 Battered Women&#x27;s Testimony Act, which provided funds for indigent women to hire expert testimony in domestic abuse cases, and the Judicial Training Act, which funded programs to educate judges about domestic violence, especially in child custody cases.

Morella came under greater pressure after her party took control of the House in 1994 Congressional elections. Although she signed the Contract with America developed by Newt Gingrich, she had a mixed record supporting the subsequent Republican majority in Congress. She did not openly challenge the new House leadership until 1997 when she voted &quot;present&quot; for Speaker of the House instead of for the incumbent, Newt Gingrich. In 1998, she was one of four Republicans, along with Amo Houghton and Peter T. King of New York and Chris Shays of Connecticut, to oppose all four articles of impeachment against Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal.

As a Republican representing an affluent Democratic district in an increasingly Democratic state, Morella faced a succession of increasingly strong Democratic challengers. While she managed to fend them all off, even in the big Democratic years of 1992, 1996, and 1998, the low popularity of the Republican-controlled Congress gradually undermined her. She tried to portray herself as giving her district a place at the table, but over time, Morella&#x27;s Democratic opponents claimed that a vote for Morella was a vote to keep Tom DeLay and other Republicans unpopular to district voters in power.

===Electoral challenges===
Maryland Senate President Thomas V. &quot;Mike&quot; Miller stated that he intended to draw Morella&#x27;s district out from under her after her relatively narrow reelection in 2000. The Democrats controlled both the State Legislature and the Governor&#x27;s Office in 2000, thus controlling the redistricting for the 2000 Census. Staffers from Senate President Miller, House Speaker Cas Taylor, and Governor Parris Glendening drew new maps to gerrymander out Morella and fellow moderate Republican Bob Ehrlich. One proposal went so far as to divide her district in two, effectively giving one to State Senator Chris Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular Delegate and Kennedy political family member Mark Shriver.

The final redistricting plan was less ambitious but still made the already heavily Democratic 8th district even more Democratic. It restored a heavily Democratic spur of eastern Montgomery County removed in the 1990 redistricting and added nine precincts in Prince George&#x27;s County from Al Wynn&#x27;s heavily Democratic . Although it forced Van Hollen and Shriver to run against each other in an expensive primary, Van Hollen defeated Morella in 2002 with 52 percent of the vote to Morella&#x27;s 47 percent (Morella would have narrowly won re-election in her previous district, according to election returns). Proving just how Democratic this new district is, the Republicans have only put up nominal challengers in the 8th since Morella&#x27;s defeat; none of them have ever won more than 40 percent of the vote.

In 2013, Morella signed an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.

Morella publicly endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the 2020 US Presidential election, over Republican incumbent Donald Trump.

===Ambassador to the OECD===
President George W. Bush appointed her United States Permanent Representative to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on July 11, 2003.

She was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on July 31 and sworn in on October 8 of that year, becoming the first former member of Congress to serve as ambassador to the OECD. She is an honorary board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women who declared Morella a &quot;Feminina Excelente&quot;.

She officially served as Ambassador from August 1, 2003 to August 6, 2007. In November 2007, she was succeeded by Christopher Egan, son of Richard Egan.

==2020 Presidential Election==
On August 24, 2020, Morella was one of 24 former Republican lawmakers to endorse Democratic nominee Joe Biden on the opening day of the Democratic National Convention.

==Awards and honors==
Morella has received honorary doctorates from American University, 1988; Norwich University, 1989; Dickinson College, 1989; Mt. Vernon College, 1995; University of Maryland University College, 1996; University of Maryland, 1997; Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, 1997; Elizabethtown College, 1999; Washington College, 2000; and National Labor College, 2004.

Her numerous awards and recognitions include induction into the Maryland Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, the Ron Brown Standards Leadership Award, and public service awards from the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and the Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights &quot;for selfless and devoted service in the cause of equality.&quot; The Republic of Italy awarded her the Medal of the Legion of Merit. She received the Foremother Award by The National Center for Health Research in 2008.

In 2013, she was awarded the Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for putting &quot;energy and enthusiasm into growing the Congressional Study Group on Germany, which is the oldest and most active parliamentary exchange involving Congress and the legislative branch of another country&quot; during her tenure as President of the United States Association of Former Members of Congress.

In 2016, she was conferred with Imperial Decorations by the Japanese government. For her contributions to deepen the U.S.-Japan alliance in the U.S. Congress, she was awarded with the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star.

On April 14, 2018, the Bethesda Library branch of the Montgomery County Public Libraries system was renamed the Connie Morella Library.

<text>Corzano (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. As of 2011 its population was 1,397.

==History==
The name &quot;Corzano&quot; is derived from the Roman family name &quot;Curtius&quot;. In the 15th century the Avogadro family built a castle in the village Meano, which is part of the &quot;comune&quot;. It was part of the Republic of Venice until its dissolution at the end of the 18th century.

==Geography==
Corzano is located at 45°26&#x27; North, 10°0&#x27; West approximately above sea level. The bordering municipalities are Barbariga, Brandico, Comezzano-Cizzago, Dello, Longhena, Pompiano and Trenzano.

Corzano counts the hamlets (&quot;frazioni&quot;) of Bargnano, Meano and Montegiardino. The last one was an autonomous municipality until 1797.

==Demographics==
The 2001 census gives the population as 980 people, composed of 359 families.

<doc id="1053052" wikidata="Q419808" url="?curid=1053052" title="Tetrahydrobiopterin">
<text>Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4, THB), also known as sapropterin (INN), is a cofactor of the three aromatic amino acid hydroxylase enzymes, used in the degradation of amino acid phenylalanine and in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), melatonin, dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), and is a cofactor for the production of nitric oxide (NO) by the nitric oxide synthases. Chemically, its structure is that of a (dihydropteridine reductase) reduced pteridine derivative (quinonoid dihydrobiopterin).

Tetrahydrobiopterin is available as a tablet for oral administration in the form of sapropterin dihydrochloride (BH4*2HCL). It was approved for use in the United States as a tablet in December 2007 and as a powder in December 2013. It was approved for use in the European Union in December 2008, Canada in April 2010, and Japan in July 2008. It is sold under the brand names Kuvan and Biopten. The typical cost of treating a patient with Kuvan is per year. BioMarin holds the patent for Kuvan until at least 2024, but Par Pharmaceutical has a right to produce a generic version by 2020.

== Medical uses ==
Sapropterin is indicated in tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency caused by GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) deficiency, or 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency. Also, BH4*2HCL is FDA approved for use in phenylketonuria (PKU), along with dietary measures. However, most people with PKU have little or no benefit from BH4*2HCL.

== Adverse effects ==
The most common adverse effects, observed in more than 10% of people, include headache and a running or obstructed nose. Diarrhea and vomiting are also relatively common, seen in at least 1% of people.

== Interactions ==
No interaction studies have been conducted. Because of its mechanism, tetrahydrobiopterin might interact with dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors like methotrexate and trimethoprim, and NO-enhancing drugs like nitroglycerin, molsidomine, minoxidil, and PDE5 inhibitors. Combination of tetrahydrobiopterin with levodopa can lead to increased excitability.

== Functions ==
Tetrahydrobiopterin has multiple roles in human biochemistry. The major one is to convert amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan to precursors of dopamine and serotonin, major monoamine neurotransmitters. It works as a cofactor, being required for an enzyme&#x27;s activity as a catalyst, mainly hydroxylases.

===Cofactor for tryptophan hydroxylases===

Tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor for tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) for the conversion of L-tryptophan (TRP) to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP).

===Cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase===
Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) catalyses the conversion of L-phenylalanine (PHE) to L-tyrosine (TYR). Therefore, a deficiency in tetrahydrobiopterin can cause a toxic buildup of L-phenylalanine, which manifests as the severe neurological issues seen in phenylketonuria.

===Cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase===
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyses the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA (DOPA), which is the precursor for dopamine. Dopamine is a vital neurotransmitter, and is the precursor of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Thus, a deficiency of BH4 can lead to systemic deficiencies of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. In fact, one of the primary conditions that can result from GTPCH-related BH4 deficiency is dopamine-responsive dystonia; currently, this condition is typically treated with carbidopa/levodopa, which directly restores dopamine levels within the brain.

===Cofactor for nitric oxide synthase===
Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) catalyses the conversion of a guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine (L-Arg) to nitric oxide (NO). Among other things, nitric oxide is involved in vasodilation, which improves systematic blood flow. The role of BH4 in this enzymatic process is so critical that some research points to a deficiency of BH4 – and thus, of nitric oxide – as being a core cause of the neurovascular dysfunction that is the hallmark of circulation-related diseases such as diabetes. As a co-factor for nitric oxide synthase, tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation has shown beneficial results for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in animal experiments and clinical trials, although the tendency of BH4 to become oxidized to BH2 remains a problem.

===Cofactor for ether lipid oxidase===
Ether lipid oxidase (alkylglycerol monooxygenase, AGMO) catalyses the conversion of 1-alkyl-sn-glycerol to 1-hydroxyalkyl-sn-glycerol.

== History ==
Tetrahydrobiopterin was discovered to play a role as an enzymatic cofactor. The first enzyme found to use tetrahydrobiopterin is phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).

== Biosynthesis and recycling ==
Tetrahydrobiopterin is biosynthesized from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by three chemical reactions mediated by the enzymes GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), and sepiapterin reductase (SR).

BH4 can be oxidized by one or two electron reactions, to generate BH4 or BH3 radical and BH2, respectively. Research shows that ascorbic acid (also known as ascorbate or vitamin C) can reduce BH3 radical into BH4, preventing the BH3 radical from reacting with other free radicals (superoxide and peroxynitrite specifically). Without this recycling process, uncoupling of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzyme and reduced bioavailability of the vasodilator nitric oxide occur, creating a form of endothelial dysfunction. Ascorbic acid is oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid during this process, although it can be recycled back to ascorbic acid.

Folic acid and its metabolites seem to be particularly important in the recycling of BH4 and NOS coupling.

== Research ==
Other than PKU studies, tetrahydrobiopterin has participated in clinical trials studying other approaches to solving conditions resultant from a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin. These include autism, depression, ADHD, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and chronic kidney disease. Experimental studies suggest that tetrahydrobiopterin regulates deficient production of nitric oxide in cardiovascular disease states, and contributes to the response to inflammation and injury, for example in pain due to nerve injury. A 2015 BioMarin-funded study of PKU patients found that those who responded to tetrahydrobiopterin also showed a reduction of ADHD symptoms.

===Depression===
In psychiatry, tetrahydrobiopterin has been hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression, although evidence is inconclusive to date.

=== Autism ===
In 1997, a small pilot study was published on the efficacy of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) on relieving the symptoms of autism, which concluded that it &quot;might be useful for a subgroup of children with autism&quot; and that double-blind trials are needed, as are trials which measure outcomes over a longer period of time. In 2010, Frye et al. published a paper which concluded that it was safe, and also noted that &quot;several clinical trials have suggested that treatment with BH4 improves ASD symptomatology in some individuals.&quot;

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
Since nitric oxide production is important in regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, thereby playing a significant role in cardiovascular diseases, tetrahydrobiopterin is a potential therapeutic target. In the endothelial cell lining of blood vessels, endothelial nitric oxide synthase is dependent on tetrahydrobiopterin availability. Increasing tetrahydrobiopterin in endothelial cells by augmenting the levels of the biosynthetic enzyme GTPCH can maintain endothelial nitric oxide synthase function in experimental models of disease states such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. However, treatment of people with existing coronary artery disease with oral tetrahydrobiopterin is limited by oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin to the inactive form, dihydrobiopterin, with little benefit on vascular function.

=== Neuroprotection in prenatal hypoxia ===
Depletion of tetrahydrobiopterin occurs in the hypoxic brain and leads to toxin production. Preclinical studies in mice reveal that treatment with oral tetrahydrobiopterin therapy mitigates the toxic effects of hypoxia on the developing brain, specifically improving white matter development in hypoxic animals.

=== Programmed cell death ===
GTPCH (GCH1) and tetrahydrobiopterin were found to have a secondary role protecting against cell death by ferroptosis in cellular models by limiting the formation of toxic lipid peroxides. Tetrahydrobiopterin acts as a potent, diffusable antioxidant that resists oxidative stress and enables cancer cell survival via promotion of angiogenesis.

<text>Darfo Boario Terme (Camunian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, northern Italy. The name combines Darfo, the &quot;capoluogo&quot;, with Boario Terme, the largest &quot;frazione&quot;.
It is bounded by the communes of Angolo Terme, Artogne, Esine, Gianico, Piancogno, Rogno.
The small lake Lago Moro is located in the commune.

== Geography ==

=== Territory ===
Around the centre, i.e. Darfo, Boario Terme, Corna and Montecchio, the following areas develop in a radial pattern: Erbanno, Gorzone, Sciano, Angone, Fucine, Pellalepre, Bessimo Superiore and Capo di Largo. The four most important quarters of the town (Darfo, Boario Terme, Corna and Montecchio) are closely integrated to form a sort of quadrilateral, the centre of which is the &quot;Isola&quot; area, a name derived from the fact that it lies at a bend in the River Oglio.

=== Area ===
The urban area has a surface area of 36,200 square kilometers, and from an altimetrical point of view, the difference in height is considerable: from the lowest point of Bessimo Superiore (206 m) to the highest point of Dosso Sparviero (1895 m).

=== Mountainous reliefs ===
The most important reliefs of the municipal government are: Monte Erbanno (1664 metres) and Altissimo (1704 metres) to the north-west, Dosso Blussega (1810 metres) and Dosso Sparviero to the south-west (1895 metres). The area has rock formations in Montecchio and Corna, and gravel and sand along the bed of the River Oglio. The &quot;Monticoli&quot; (deriving from the late Latin &quot;monticŭlus&quot;, diminutive of &quot;mons&quot; : &quot;montis&quot;, meaning &#x27;mountain&#x27;) are considered to be fundamental to the town of Darfo Boario Terme, in fact they have repeatedly protected the Piana Boario from the flooding of the River Oglio and their maximum height is 394 metres.

==== Pietra Simona ====
The rock outcropping that forms the characteristic Monticoli is made up of red sandstone, also known as &quot;&#x27;Pietra Simona&quot;&#x27;, from the area of Simoni in Gorzone, where it has been quarried since ancient times. Simona stone is the basic and characteristic element of the nature and landscape of the Bassa Valcamonica (in particular of Darfo Boario Terme), and because of its natural availability, is the basis of rock art. Simona stone is a contact metamorphism sandstone; it has a uniform stratification plane and a fracture plane of 45 degrees. It has the negative solubility of cement, porosity, permeability and chemical resistance. It is a kind of elastic rock and has considerable resistance to processing. Its specific gravity is calculated at 33 quintals per cubic metre and, when smooth, it has a textured matte sheen. The characteristic that makes it immediately recognisable is its consistently purplish-red colour. The versatility of this sandstone withstood competition from marble in the Middle Ages. Marcello Ricardi wrote in Article 1 of the magazine &#x27;L&#x27;Ogliolo&#x27;, &#x27;Owning the portal of the Simona stone house means that a family can be seen in Vicinie, either for personal wealth or political influence. In many villages in the Camonica Valley these structures are still intact, and the date of the inauguration is often engraved...&#x27;.

=== Hydrography ===
Beneath the historic centre of Erbanno there is a river floodplain, today houses and industry are everywhere, but until a few decades ago it was a cultivated area. Thousands of years ago this plain was the site of a lake basin, which extended from today&#x27;s Lake Iseo to Cividate Camuno. This is due not only to the nature of the subsoil, but also to the presence of evident fishing tools, such as simple nets and cages, in the rock carvings of the area. The territory of the municipality of Darfo Boario Terme includes, in addition to the river Oglio, the streams Dezzo, Rovinazza, Budrio, Re, Ogliolo and the Italsider hydroelectric power stations. Since ancient times, rivers and streams have been seriously damaged by floods. We need only recall the extremely serious disaster caused by the collapse of the Gleno dam (1 December 1923) and the flood of 16 September 1960.

== Origins of the name ==
According to Olivieri, the name is a compound word &#x27;&quot;ad arvum&quot;&#x27;, meaning &#x27;&quot;present&quot;&#x27;. According to Mario Gallotti, it derives from the Mediterranean word &quot;&#x27;arbe&quot;&#x27;, which is the name of the Alpine river. Some scholars believe it originated from the German &quot;&quot;Dorf&quot; (village). Don Lino Ertani has suggested that Darfo derives from the ancient dialect word &quot;Garf&quot; (landslide, gravel and rock). The dialect pronunciation is actually &quot;Darf&quot;&quot; and would indicate the rising of the terrain of ancient Darfo and the descent of the cones of the Rovinazza and Re streams, which brought numerous boulders and debris downstream.

=== Terme di Boario ===

==== History ====
Antonio Bazzini, as he wrote in &quot;Cronaca di Lovere&quot;, claimed that the history of Boario Terme as an excellent health resort began when the Casino di Boario was built, where &quot;&quot;salutary magnesic and iron vitrinolate waters&quot; were managed.

According to some scholars, however, knowledge of the waters of Boario dates back to the 15th century and led some doctors to study their therapeutic effects. It seems that the famous doctor and naturalist Paracelsus (1493-1541) also visited the area. In 1700, when the physician Francesco Roncalli Parolino wrote in his paper &#x27;De acquis brixianis&#x27;, in 1724 to be precise, a remarkable revival took place. Roncalli himself reiterated the effectiveness of the &quot;aquae bogiarianae&quot;&quot; in &quot;Europae Medicina&quot; (1747).

In the 19th century, Ottavio Ferrario (1840) conducted new research and the first chemical analyses. Alessandro Manzoni wrote to Giovanni Morelli (Giovanni Morelli), a doctor from Bergamo, on 16 December 1845: &quot;I have reason to regret not having taken advantage of the kind and cordial exhibition you gave me to obtain Boario&#x27;s water directly from the owner of the land&quot;&quot;.&quot;

In 1857, dr. Biffi, the first medical scientist of the Austrian lieutenant in Lombardy described it as &quot;the most active in Lombardy&quot;. However, according to Cantù, the revaluation of the waters of Boario came about thanks to doctor Zattini of Darfo in 1858. Since then, more and more people have been coming to Boario to treat themselves, but staying in nearby villages such as Darfo, Corna, Esine, etc. Only in 1906 the waters of Boario were revalued. Since then, the first spa building with features such as an Art Nouveau dome was built and, in 1906, the Hotel Terme was also built, followed by the construction of other hotels.

However, it was not until 1914, with the construction of a thermal spa, that the therapeutic value of the waters was scientifically and methodically developed. As a result of this development, Royal Decree No. 765 of 15 April 1926 elevated Boario to the status of Autonomous Board of Health.

Between 1951 and 1952, a new spring was discovered, now called Fausta, in honour of its discoverer Dr Fausto Cardio.

A few years later, with the extension of the park, the spa was completely transformed and a new pavilion and a huge auditorium were added.

This small spa also survived the terrible flood that hit Boario on the night of 17 September 1960.

In 1964, a new spa named after Alessandro Manzoni was opened. In 1965 the old spa establishment, dedicated to Adolfo Ferrata, was enlarged and modernised. New and modern hotels and guesthouses increased the accommodation capacity of Boario Terme.

The thermal spring is located in a vast park, in the middle of shady avenues, vast lawns and flowerbeds, dominated by the steep rocky walls of Monte Erbanno.

After three centuries of renowned therapeutic and curative value, the Boario spa still retains a quality of high excellence, as certified by CerAm, the European Mineral Water Research Centre in 2010. 
==== The Dome ====
The Liberty dome, the emblem of Terme di Boario, is made of white marble, and the balcony is supported by pillars with Ionic capitals. Its history can be traced back to 1913: it was once the seat of the orchestra, while today it is considered a sign and symbol of the Terme di Boario and the municipality in which it is located, Darfo Boario Terme. The dome is the most prestigious symbol of the Padiglione dell&#x27;Antica Fonte, and was built a century ago by the architect Amerigo Marazzi, becoming a striking example of Art Nouveau architecture.

==== Park ====
Also important for well-being is the centuries-old park, comprising 130,000 square metres of land where mineral water is collected. It is the ideal place to take a relaxing walk and invigorate the spirit.

==== Springs ====
The precious quality of the thermal waters have their natural foundations in the Alps surrounding the Camonica Valley. In fact, by coming into contact with precious mineral elements, the waters are purified and enriched thanks to them. The waters are sulphate, bicarbonate, calcium and magnesium cold (13-15 °C). The four springs of the Terme di Boario are differentiated by the concentration of salts, a characteristic that allows them to have different therapeutic functions such as treatment, rehabilitation and prevention. They mainly play a beneficial role for all physical ailments caused by the stress of everyday life.

As mentioned above, there are four springs:

* Acqua Antica Fonte, indicated mainly for those suffering from digestive disorders, cholecystopathy and irritable bowel or with problems of constipation and diverticulosis. This water contains a high percentage of sulphate, bicarbonate and calcium and, if drunk warm, increases its effectiveness; 
* Acqua Fausta, with its mineral elements inside, helps to cleanse the mucous membrane and promotes better intestinal motility. This water is suitable for those who suffer from intestinal disorders, in particular bile flow difficulties, chronic constipation, abdominal bloating and irritable bowel;
* Acqua Igea, is able to act on the digestive system and biliary tract, promote the elimination of metabolic waste products and activate water exchange. It has beneficial effects on digestion and prevention of kidney stones, and has anti-inflammatory effects on the genito-urinary tract;
* Acqua Boario, due to its low sodium content, has a strong purifying and detoxifying effect on the digestive system and urinary tract, aiding digestion and finding specific indications in the treatment of cystitis, kidney stones and water retention. Thanks to its balanced calcium and magnesium content, it is considered the best water to drink every day at any age.

<text>Edolo (Camunian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, Lombardy, northern Italy, located in the upper Camonica valley. Edolo is neighbour to the comuni of Corteno Golgi, Incudine, Lovero, Malonno, Monno, Ponte di Legno, Saviore dell&#x27;Adamello, Sernio, Sonico, Temù, Tovo di Sant&#x27;Agata, Vezza d&#x27;Oglio and Vione.

Edolo houses the northern terminus of the Brescia–Iseo–Edolo railway operated by Trenord. It is also the location of the Edolo Pumped Storage Plant.

Despite Edolo&#x27;s close distance (32 km by road) to Tirano and the border with Switzerland, there is no train connection between the two towns. In the summer, a bus service connects Edolo (for trains towards Brescia) and Tirano (for the Rhaetian Railway towards the Bernina Pass).

<text>The Zire 72 is Palm, Inc.&#x27;s second Personal Digital Assistant with an integrated digital camera. Introduced in 2004, it is the replacement for the Zire 71, having a 1.2 megapixel camera, 32 MB of memory, built-in Bluetooth wireless communication, video recording and playback capability, a built-in microphone, hi-res hi-color screen, SecureDigital smartcard slot, and a 312 MHz Intel PXA270 processor.

Users have complained about several problems, most notably
*Blue paint peels off (a &quot;special edition&quot; version has been released that has no blue paint, just silver.)
*Camera quality (broken pixels, uncovered lens etc.)
*Screen whining
*Battery life

Palm, Inc. released a second version of the Zire 72, the Zire 72s, which is silver. This change fixed the problem with the paint. They subsequently released a version of the blue Zire 72, which used a different paint, and does not peel.

As with other Bluetooth enabled devices, turning that connectivity off when not required, extends battery life.

This is the last model in PalmOne&#x27;s line of multimedia Zire devices, and the last model made with a camera. The Zire 72 has been discontinued and is no longer supported by PalmOne/Palm&#x27;s successor, Hewlett-Packard.

There have also been many complaints about discolored pixels, such as certain groups of pixels on the screen turning green, red, and blue.

<text>Gary Chevsky (born September 11, 1972 in Odesa) is an American entrepreneur, engineer and was the founding architect of Ask.com. He served as President at Tango mobile video and audio-over-IP calling service for consumers, before founding a Social Virtual Reality company StayUp Inc.

== Career ==
In 1992, Chevsky was hired by Garrett Gruener, fellow Berkeley grad and eventual co-founder, to help write programming for the Ask Jeeves concept site. After parting ways, he went on to work for Informix before reconnecting with Gruener in 1995. From 1995 to 2006, Chevsky worked on question answering and information-retrieval technologies at Ask Jeeves (now Ask.com). Subsequently, he served as Vice President of Engineering at Symantec Corporation in its Consumer Business Unit (known for its Norton brand), developing web security technologies such as Norton Safe Web. From 2009 to 2011, he served as Vice President of Product Development, Operations &amp; IT for YouSendIt (now Hightail). In July 2011, Chevsky was hired at Tango.me, a video calling company, to oversee engineering. Chevsky went on to become the President of Tango, which during his tenure grew from less than 10 million to over 400 million users worldwide. In 2017, Chevsky envisioned the future of video communication in virtual reality and started an effort at Tango around Social VR, eventually leading the spin-off of the project into a stand-alone company StayUp Inc., with Chevsky as founder and CEO. StayUp was acquired in 2018 by IMVU, a social 3D world company, with Chevsky coming onboard as an executive advisor. In 2021, he joined RingCentral as Vice President of Collaboration.

== Personal life ==
He immigrated to the United States in 1988 and settled in San Francisco, California. Chevsky studied Computer Science at the University of California Berkeley. He holds 5 patents in the area of natural language processing and search/information retrieval, and is also featured in the Search Engine exhibit in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA.

<doc id="1053077" wikidata="Q6525266" url="?curid=1053077" title="Leonard Evans">
<text>Leonard Salusbury Evans (August 19, 1929 – January 2, 2016) was a Canadian politician in Manitoba. He was a member of the Manitoba legislature from 1969 to 1999 and was a Cabinet Minister in the governments of New Democratic Premiers Edward Schreyer and Howard Pawley.

== Early life and career ==

The son of David Evans and Gwen Salusbury, he was born in Winnipeg and educated at Transcona Collegiate Institute, the University of Winnipeg, the University of Manitoba, Simon Fraser University and the University of Ottawa. He worked as an economist and a professor of economics before entering political life. Evans first ran for public office in the Canadian federal election of 1953, running as a Cooperative Commonwealth Federation candidate in the riding of St. Boniface. He finished second with 5568 votes, a credible showing for the party in the region.

In 1953, he married Alice Lorrain Mazinke.

==Electoral record==
Evans was elected to the Manitoba legislature as a New Democrat in the provincial election of 1969. This election was a watershed moment in Manitoba politics, as the NDP emerged as the largest party with 28 seats and formed government after gaining the support of Liberal MLA Laurent Desjardins. Evans was elected in the riding of Brandon East, in the province&#x27;s southwestern corner.

Evans was named Minister of Mines and Natural Resources on July 15, 1969. On December 18 of the same year, he was promoted to Minister of Industry and Commerce, a position which he held until the defeat of the NDP government in 1977. He was also given ministerial responsibility for the Manitoba Housing and Renewal Corporation on September 22, 1976. Evans oversaw the Manitoba Development Corporation in his ministerial role and used his position to promote public management within certain industries. Additionally, he co-founded WESTAC to strengthen public-private relations in the transportation industry.

Evans was easily re-elected in the 1973 provincial election. He faced a more serious challenge from Progressive Conservative James Thornborough in the 1977 election but still won by over 1000 votes. The Tories won the 1977 election, and Evans served as opposition critic for Economic Development over the next four years.

The NDP were returned to government in 1981, and Evans was appointed as Minister of Community Service and Correction and Minister of Natural Resources on November 30, 1981, also receiving responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone System. He was relieved of the latter two positions on August 20, 1982, and on November 4, 1983, was transferred to the Ministry of Employment Services and Economic Security, where he would remain until the fall of the NDP government in 1988. He was also given responsibility for the A.E. McKenzie Co. Ltd from June 29, 1983, to January 4, 1984, was Minister of Natural Resources again from January 3, 1986, to April 17, 1988, and held responsibility for Manitoba Data Services between September 21, 1987, and May 9, 1988.

Evans faced a surprisingly strong challenge from PC candidate Jim Armstrong in the 1986 provincial election but was re-elected by about 1000 votes. He again defeated Armstrong by 653 votes in 1988, despite a sharp decline in NDP support in the rest of the province.

Prior to the fall of the NDP government in 1988, Evans went on record as being one of the few MLAs in his party to oppose the Meech Lake Accord. He wanted to join with Elijah Harper in denying approval for the Accord in 1990 but declined so as not to detract from the issue of aboriginal rights (Harper was aboriginal, Evans was not). As a cabinet minister, Evans stopped the process of adopting aboriginal children to non-aboriginal families outside of the province, a process which many aboriginal activists had regarded as cultural genocide.

Evans served as NDP Finance critic from 1988 to 1999. By now a respected &quot;elder statesman&quot; in the party, he had little difficulty being re-elected in the elections of 1990 and 1995. He did not seek re-election in the 1999 Manitoba general election; Drew Caldwell retained Brandon East for the NDP. As of July 2010, he was a member of the province&#x27;s Public Utilities Board.

In 2007, Evans was elected as president of the Association of Former Manitoba MLAs. He died on January 2, 2016, at the age of 86 after suffering a heart attack in the previous week.

<doc id="1053086" wikidata="Q7379580" url="?curid=1053086" title="Run out">
<text>Run out is a method of dismissal in cricket, in which the fielding team put down the wicket of a batter who is outside their ground, usually because they are trying to score a run.

Run out is governed by Law 38 of the laws of cricket. If the batter is judged run out, the run does not count and the bowler does not get credit for the wicket. 

A run out can also be effected when the batters are not attempting a run if one of them leaves the crease when the ball is not dead.
Some such dismissals cause controversy because they challenge long-established — but not universal — conventions about the spirit of the game.

==Definition==
A batter is run out if, at any time while the ball is in play, no part of their bat or person is grounded behind the popping crease and their wicket is fairly broken by the action of a fielder. The batter whose ground is at the end where the wicket is broken is out. 

A batter can be run out even when not attempting a run if they are out of their crease and the wicket is put down by a fielder. For example, the striker is run out if the batter plays the ball which is collected by a close fielder and the wicket is broken when the striker has left their ground to play the ball. 

If a batter has a runner, the batter must also stay in the crease when the ball is in play, and the batter can be run out if they or their runner are out of the crease when the wicket is broken. 

===Exceptions===
A batter may be run out whether or not a run is being attempted, even if the delivery is declared a no-ball or a wide except for the following circumstances:
*A batter has been within the popping crease and has subsequently left it to avoid injury, when the wicket is put down.
*The ball bowled by the bowler has not made any contact with a fielder before the wicket is put down.
*A batter is given out stumped.
*A no-ball has been called, no attempt to run is made by the batter, and the wicket is put down by the wicket-keeper without another fielder&#x27;s intervention. This prevents what would be a stumping — were it not called a no-ball — being ruled a run out instead.

===Non-striker leaving their ground early===

As a bowler enters their delivery stride, the non-striking batter might back up, meaning they leave their popping crease early and moves towards the other end of the wicket, so that, if the batters attempt a run, that run can be completed quickly. If, at any time from the moment the ball comes into play (i.e. when the bowler starts their run-up) until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the non-striker is out of their ground, they can be run out. This is judged to be before the bowler&#x27;s bowling arm has passed the vertical. 

While a generous bowler may warn a batter to stay in their crease rather than to take their wicket, it is not required by the laws of cricket nor the guidance notes by MCC on the spirit of cricket to do so. It is a legitimate mode of dismissal, and the International Cricket Council (ICC) playing conditions match the MCC Laws in this respect.

One of the earliest recorded examples came in a match between Eton and Harrow in 1850, when Harrow&#x27;s Charles Austen-Leigh was run out &quot;backing up&quot; by Eton bowler William Prest. The most notable example of this method of dismissal involved the Indian bowler Vinoo Mankad who ran out Bill Brown on 13 December 1947 in the second test during India&#x27;s tour of Australia at Sydney. Mankad when, in the act of delivering the ball, he held on to it and removed the bails with Brown well out of his crease. Since this incident, a batter dismissed in this fashion was informally said to have been &quot;Mankaded&quot;. 

Until 2022 this mode of dismissal was part of Law 41-Unfair play. but it is now wholly within Law 38 (Run Out). Some observers feel that dismissing a batter in this way is poor sporting etiquette and against the spirit of the game, while others believe that the laws and regulations exist to be used as a structure of the game and that it is legitimate and sporting to exercise them. Such dismissals have on occasion provoked debate. In July 2014, when England&#x27;s Jos Buttler was run out by Sri Lanka&#x27;s Sachithra Senanayake, the World Cricket Council, an independent consultative body of former international captains and umpires, unanimously expressed support of Sri Lanka&#x27;s actions. In contrast, in March 2019, when Buttler was dismissed in the same way by Ravichandran Ashwin in the 2019 Indian Premier League, an MCC spokesman said that while the mode of dismissal is legitimate, this particular dismissal was not in the &quot;spirit of the game&quot; because of the timing of the breaking of the wicket, a judgement that is now explicit in the Law.

===Runs scored===
If either batter is run out, the run in progress when the wicket is put down is not counted. Any runs completed will be counted, together with any runs for penalties awarded to either side.

If the striker has a runner and is themself run out (which would be at the striker&#x27;s end), then no runs count and the umpire returns the non-striker to the original (non-striking) end. If the striker&#x27;s runner, a non-striker&#x27;s runner, or the non-striker themselves, is run out, runs completed will be counted.

===Credit===
The bowler does not get credit for the wicket as part of their match bowling figures. Credit is given to the &quot;primary&quot; fielder who gathers the ball and either puts down the wicket or makes the ball available for another player to do so, and any other &quot;assistant&quot; fielders who touch the ball, including a player who ultimately puts down the wicket. The bowler may act as the primary fielder or assistant fielder.

===Ball in play===
The batter can be run out if the ball is in play (i.e not &#x27;dead&#x27;). They may intentionally leave the crease not attempting a run, for example to talk to the non-striker or to pat the pitch. They can do this because of the customary understanding with the fielding team that the ball is considered dead at that time. If that understanding breaks down, a fielder might put down the wicket. As ever, the fielding team must appeal for any dismissal to occur, and the fielding captain will withdraw the appeal if they view it to be unwarranted by the spirit of the game, which will depend on judgement of custom, practice and circumstance. But if an appeal is made, the umpire must give the batter out unless they consider that a dead ball pertained. 

There have been instances, such as a Test match in 2006, when Muttiah Muralitharan left his crease to congratulate Kumar Sangakkara on completing his century, and was run out by Brendon McCullum. McCullum subsequently stated that he regretted that his actions were not within the spirit of the game. 

In a contrasting incident in a Test match against India in 2011, Ian Bell was initially given run out after leaving his crease, wrongly assuming his shot had reached the boundary, but the appeal was later withdrawn by the fielding captain MS Dhoni and Bell was allowed to resume his innings. The essential distinction of this incident is that the ball is automatically dead when it reaches the boundary (interpretation by the umpire is not required), and so Bell left his crease under a misapprehension that may have been reinforced by the actions of some of the fielding team, who were under the same misapprehension. An intention to deceive the batter is explicitly unfair and would itself cause the ball to become adjudged dead by the umpire, but otherwise a batter is still run out on appeal if they are out of their ground wrongly believing the ball to have become automatically dead.

<text>Solør is a Norwegian traditional district consisting of the valley between Elverum in the north and Kongsvinger in the south. It is part of Innlandet county and it includes the municipalities Våler, Åsnes, and Grue.

==Glomma valley ==
Glommadal (&quot;Glåmdalen&quot;) is a designation for the valley formed by the river Glåma (also called the Glomma), which is the longest and largest river in Norway. From Lake Aursund in the north on south to Elverum, the valley is called the Østerdalen. From that point south until Kongsvinger, it is referred to as Solør. As in turns westerly from Kongsvinger until Nes, it is called the Odalen. These designations are also traditional districts, reflecting the designations locals used for their valleys.

==Name==
The Old Norse form of the name was .

==Geography==
Solør is a rural area and consists mainly of farming land and forest. In fact, Solør is the number one potato producing area in Norway. Forestry is also important for the area, and &quot;Forestia&quot;, a major chip-board factory, is situated in Våler, playing an important role in the local society, especially by providing jobs for a large proportion of the local inhabitants.

==History==
In the early Viking Age, before Harald Fairhair, Solør was a petty kingdom. In the 17th century the forest east of Glomma became known as &quot;Finnskogen&quot; (&quot;the forest of the Finns&quot;). This named refers to Finnish refugees from Sweden who had been encouraged to settle in the adjacent province of Värmland but were later evicted and fled across the border into Hedmark.

Halfdan Hvitbeinn was one of the historic Kings of Soløyjar (Solør).

<doc id="1053092" wikidata="Q5871581" url="?curid=1053092" title="Hit wicket">
<text>Hit wicket is a method of dismissal in the sport of cricket. This method of dismissal is governed by Law 35 of the Laws of Cricket. The striker is out &quot;hit wicket&quot; if, after the bowler has entered his delivery stride and while the ball is in play, his wicket is put down by his bat or his person. The striker may do this whilst preparing to receive or receiving a delivery or in setting off for his first run after playing the delivery. In simple language, if the striking batsman knocks the bails off the stumps or uproots the stumps, while attempting to hit the ball or take off for a run, he is out hit wicket.

This method is the sixth most common method of dismissal after caught, bowled, leg before wicket, run out and stumped. It is significantly rarer than any of these, which constitute the five conventional methods, but still much more common than the other four (timed out, obstructing the field, retired out and hit the ball twice), which are extremely rare.

Although a bowler is given credit for the wicket, it is not a method of dismissal that a bowler actively seeks. A batsman may not be given out &quot;hit wicket&quot; if the ball is not actually delivered by the bowler or if the delivery is a no-ball.

, batsmen have been dismissed hit wicket a total of 164 times in Test cricket, 77 times in One Day Internationals and 35 in Twenty20 Internationals. In the women&#x27;s game, a player has been dismissed 12 times in this manner in Tests, 8 in women&#x27;s ODIs, and 18 in women&#x27;s Twenty20 International matches.

==Notable dismissals==
Due to the rarity of this method of dismissal, many occurrences in international cricket are notable.

===Commentary gaffe===
On 9 August 1991, during a match between England and the West Indies at the Oval, Ian Botham fell over his stumps whilst attempting to hook Curtly Ambrose and so was dismissed &quot;hit wicket&quot;. Later in the day, Brian Johnston of BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Test Match Special&quot; read out the details of the scorecard as normal. When he came to Botham&#x27;s dismissal, his fellow presenter Jonathan Agnew commented that Botham &#x27;just didn&#x27;t quite get his leg over&#x27;. This was a double entendre meaning that he was not able to avoid hitting his stumps by getting his leg higher than the stumps, and also a reference to sex. Johnston slowly started laughing until he could commentate no more, leaving about a minute of broadcasting being just him in a fit of giggles.

===Disintegrating bat===
In the first innings of the 3rd Test in the 1921 Ashes series, at Headingley, Andy Ducat, playing in his only Test for England, fended at a fast ball bowled by Australia&#x27;s Ted McDonald. Ducat&#x27;s bat broke, and a splinter flew back and dislodged a bail, the ball being caught behind by a slip fielder. Ducat was given out &quot;caught&quot;, although it seems likely that he could also have been given out &quot;hit wicket&quot;.

Later in 1921, in the 2nd Test between Australia and South Africa at Old Wanderers in Johannesburg, McDonald dismissed Billy Zulch in a similar fashion, breaking the batsman&#x27;s bat so that fragments flew back to dislodge a bail, and Zulch was given out &quot;hit wicket&quot;.

After these incidents, the MCC clarified that the whole bat must break the wicket for the batsman to be given out &quot;hit wicket&quot;. However, effective 1 October 2010, this law has been changed to allow a batsman to be dismissed &quot;hit wicket&quot; if a splinter, or part of his bat, breaks the wicket.

===Flying gloves===
Playing for Derbyshire against Surrey at the Oval in 1953, Alan Revill&#x27;s hand was hit by a lifting delivery from Alec Bedser. Revill shook his hand in pain, and his glove flew off, hit the stumps, and dislodged a bail. The umpire considered that Revill was still &quot;playing at the ball&quot;, and he was dismissed &quot;hit wicket&quot;.

===Falling headgear===
In Test cricket, a number of batsmen have been out &quot;hit wicket&quot; as a result of headgear falling onto the stumps.

In the 2nd Test between Australia and the West Indies in Melbourne in 1960–61 (the Test immediately after the famous Tied Test at Brisbane), Joe Solomon was first out in the second innings, following on. Playing back to a topspinner bowled by Richie Benaud, his cap fell off and dislodged a bail, so he was out &quot;hit wicket&quot;. The Australian crowd thought the dismissal was unsporting, and booed their own side.

In Warwickshire&#x27;s County Championship match against Hampshire at Edgbaston in 1962, M. J. K. Smith was dismissed when a gust of wind blew his cap on to his wicket.

Two Indian cricketers have been dismissed in a similar fashion – Ashok Mankad by England&#x27;s Chris Old during the 3rd Test at Edgbaston in July 1974, and Dilip Vengsarkar by Australia&#x27;s Jeff Thomson during the 1st Test at Brisbane in December 1977.

In the 3rd One Day International between New Zealand and Australia in Dunedin in February 2000, New Zealand&#x27;s Adam Parore had his helmet knocked off by a short-pitched delivery from Brett Lee. The helmet fell into the stumps, and Parore was also out &quot;hit wicket&quot;, causing some disturbance in the crowd.

In the 3rd Test between England and West Indies at Old Trafford on 9 June 2007, Kevin Pietersen was out &quot;hit wicket&quot; when his helmet fell onto the stumps. The bowler was Dwayne Bravo, who bowled a good bouncer that dislodged the helmet. Replays suggested that the force of the ball broke the chinstrap, freeing the lid to strike the stumps.

===Other strange hit wicket dismissals===
Pakistan&#x27;s Inzamam-ul-Haq was also out &quot;hit wicket&quot; in the 3rd Test against England at Headingley on 6 August 2006, as he attempted to sweep England spinner Monty Panesar and in doing so lost his balance before falling backwards onto his stumps. He attempted to jump over the stumps, but completely fell on top of them.

One of the more bizarre hit wicket dismissals was of Sri Lanka national cricket team former captain Kumar Sangakkara in the finals of the triangular ODI Compaq Cup against India at Colombo on 14 September 2009, as he attempted a shot and in the follow through his bat slipped out of his hands, flew backwards in the air and landed on the stumps.

On 1 December 2017, West Indian player Sunil Ambris became the first player to be dismissed hit wicket on debut, also getting out for a golden duck. He proceeded to get out the same way in the very next game, becoming the only player to be out this way twice in consecutive games.
