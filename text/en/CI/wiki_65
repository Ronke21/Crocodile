<text>Sir Benjamin Chilley Campbell Pine (1809–1891) was at various times administrator of Natal, the Gold Coast, Antigua, the Leeward Islands and Western Australia.

==Life==
Born in 1809 in Maidstone Kent, Benjamin Pine was educated in Brighton and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He became a career officer in the British Colonial Service. From 1850 to 1855, he was Lieutenant-Governor of Natal Colony, and from March 1857 until 17 April 1858 was Governor of the Gold Coast.

On 30 July 1868, Pine was appointed by letters patent to the position of Governor of Western Australia. Shortly afterwards, however, a vacancy occurred for the position of Governor of the Leeward Islands, and it was decided that he should fill that position instead. He never arrived in Western Australia, and six months passed before the colony received news that he would not be coming.

Pine served as Governor of the Leeward Islands from 1869 until 1871. His title then became Governor of Antigua until 1873, but the Leeward Islands continued under his governorship. He died in 1891.

The city of Pinetown, in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is named after him.

There is also a Primary school called Benjamin Pine Primary School named after him in Pinetown as well as the Pinetown High Schools (Boys and Girls) Honouring his name by the Pine Cones on the Badges.

He is buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery. His grave (no.29309) has no headstone or marker.

==Status as Governor of Western Australia==
In Burt (1996), Sir Francis Burt, who was a lawyer, a judge and himself a former Governor of Western Australia, analysed the question whether Pine should be considered to have served as Governor of Western Australia. He concluded that the appointment by letters patent, together with the publication of that appointment in the newspapers of the colony, legally implied that Pine was Governor of Western Australia, even though he never arrived at the colony and was never sworn in.

The person who actually administered the colony during the period of Pine&#x27;s formal tenure (2 November 1868–29 September 1869) was Lieut Col John Bruce.

<text>The ARWEN ACE is a breech-loaded less-lethal launcher which fires a variety of 37mm less-lethal munitions which includes direct impact batons, chemical irritant delivery munitions and smoke delivery munitions. 

&quot;ARWEN&quot; is an acronym for &quot;anti riot weapon enfield&quot;.

As of 2001, all ARWEN trademarks and patents are owned by Police Ordnance Company Inc. The launcher is manufactured under license in Canada.

==Munition types==

The ARWEN ACE is part of a less lethal system which incorporates a variety of less lethal munitions which can be deployed through the same launcher.

The AR-1 munition consists of a proprietary polymer baton which is intended to be deployed at living tissue as a means of inflicting blunt force trauma through direct impact at ranges up to 100 meters / 109.36 yards.

The AR-2 munition consists of an aluminum canister which is intended to deploy a large quantity of pyrotechnic smoke along with a payload of chemical irritant in the form of micronized CS.

The AR-3 munition consists of a proprietary polymer baton which is intended to be deployed at living tissue as a means of inflicting blunt force trauma through direct impact at ranges up to 100 meters / 109.36 yards. Unlike the AR-1 munition, the AR-3 also contains a discrete payload of chemical irritant in the form of CS or OC powder which are intended to contaminate the target when struck.

The AR-4 munition consists of an aluminum canister which is intended to deploy a large quantity of pyrotechnic smoke suitable for screening purposes in a variety of colours.

The AR-5 munition consists of a composite plastic projectile which is intended to be fired at a physical obstruction such as a window, door or other barricade. The munition is designed to penetrate and pass through the obstruction at which time it deploys a payload of chemical irritant in the form of micronized CS or OC.

The AR-6 munition consists of either OC or CS chemical irritant powder which is immediately dispersed through the muzzle of the ARWEN when fired and designed to immediately contaminate an individual or area through blast dispersion

Munitions manufactured by companies other than Police Ordnance Company Inc. void the manufacturer warranty and can lead to damage to ARWEN launchers.

<doc id="1066314" wikidata="Q216795" url="?curid=1066314" title="Dunam">
<text>A dunam (Ottoman Turkish, Arabic: ; ; ; ), also known as a donum or dunum and as the old, Turkish, or Ottoman [[stremma]](citation needed), was the Ottoman unit of area analogous in role (but not equal) to the Greek stremma or English acre, representing the amount of land that could be ploughed by a team of oxen in a day. The legal definition was(when?) &quot;forty standard paces in length and breadth&quot;, but its actual area varied considerably from place to place, from a little more than in Ottoman Palestine to around in Iraq.

The unit is still in use in many areas previously ruled by the Ottomans, although the new or metric dunam has been redefined(as of when, by who?) as exactly one decare (), which is 1/10 hectare (1/10 × ), like the modern Greek royal stremma.

==History==
The name dönüm, from the Ottoman Turkish &quot;dönmek&quot; (, &quot;to turn&quot;), appears to be a calque of the Byzantine Greek &quot;stremma&quot; and had the same size. It was likely adopted by the Ottomans from the Byzantines in Mysia-Bithynia.

&quot;The Dictionary of Modern Greek&quot; defines the old Ottoman stremma as approximately , but Costas Lapavitsas used the value of for the region of Naoussa in the early 20th century.

==Definition==
===Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro ===
In Bosnia and Herzegovina and also Serbia, the unit is called &quot;dulum&quot; (дулум) or &quot;dunum&quot; (дунум). In Bosnia and Herzegovina dunum (or dulum) equals . In the region of Leskovac, south Serbia, One dulum is equal to . In Albania it is called dynym or dylym. It is equal to .

===Bulgaria===
In Bulgaria, the decare (декар) is used, which is an SI unit, literally meaning 10 ares.

===Cyprus===
In Cyprus, a donum is or 14400 square feet. In the Republic of Cyprus older Greek-Cypriots also still refer to the donum using the local Greek Cypriot dialect word σκάλες [skales], rather than the mainland Greek word stremma (equivalent to a decare). However, since 1986 officially Cyprus uses the square metre and the hectare.

A donum consists of 4 evleks, each of which consists of or 3.600 square feet.

===Greece===
In Greece, the old dönüm is called a &quot;Turkish stremma&quot;, while today, a stremma or &quot;royal stremma&quot; is exactly one decare, like the metric dönüm.

===Iraq===
In Iraq, the dunam is .

===Israel and Turkey===
In Israel and Turkey, the dunam is , which is 1 decare. From the Ottoman period and through the early years of the British Mandate for Palestine, the size of a dunam was , but in 1928, the metric dunam of was adopted, and this is still used today in Israel.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
The Dubai Statistics Center and Statistics Centre Abu Dhabi use the metric dunam (spelt as donum) for data relating to agricultural land use. One donum equals .

==Variations==
Other countries using a dunam of some size include Libya and Syria.

<text>Sir William Cleaver Francis Robinson (14 January 1834 – 2 May 1897) was an Irish colonial administrator and musical composer, who wrote several well-known songs. He was born in County Westmeath, Ireland, and was educated at home and at the Royal Naval School. He joined the Colonial Office service in 1858 and became the president of Montserrat in 1862. 

He married Olivia Edith Deane in 1862. He began serving as governor of the Falkland Islands in May 1866 and governed Prince Edward Island from 1870–1873, helping the island join a union with Canada. He became the governor of the Leeward Islands in 1874 and served his first term as the Western Australia governor from 1875–1877. 

He was appointed governor of the Straits Settlements in 1877 and served as governor of Western Australia a second term from April 1880 to February 1883. Robinson became the governor of South Australia in 1883 until 1889. He was a temporary governor of Victoria, Australia in 1889, but was unable to be appointed permanently. He served his third term as governor of Western Australia from 1890–1895. He retired from his career in March 1895, at age 61. He then travelled to England and died on 2 May 1897, in South Kensington, London.

== Early life ==
Robinson was born at Rosmead in County Westmeath, Ireland, on 14 January 1834 to Admiral Hercules Robinson, a naval officer, and Frances Elizabeth Wood, as their fourth son. He received his education at both his home in Rosmead and at the Royal Naval School in New Cross, Surrey. He was described as tall and slim, in comparison to his more athletic brother, Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead (born Hercules George Robert), whom he &quot;lived somewhat in the shadow of.&quot;

== Early career (1858–1883) ==
In 1858, when he was 21 years old, Robinson entered the service of the Colonial Office as a private secretary to Hercules, who was Lieutenant Governor of St. Kitts at the time. Robinson accompanied Hercules as a private secretary again in 1859 when Hercules became the governor of Hong Kong.

In 1862, William became the president of the island of Montserrat in the West Indies. This was his first time being appointed as a viceroy. On 7 April 1862, Robinson married Olivia Edith Deane, the daughter of bishop Thomas Townsend. Robinson was an administrator of the government in Dominica from January 1865 to October 1865. He became the commander-in-chief and governor of the Falkland Islands on 23 May 1866 and held office there until 1870, later recounting the country and its settlement as a &quot;remote settlement at the fag end of the world,&quot; due to its very small population.

On 5 July 1870, Robinson was appointed the 19th Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island, and kept this position until November 1873. While Robinson was governing the island, it was attempting to join a union along with the other British colonies in North America, after having been a separate colony for over a hundred years. Many of the politicians in the colony objected to the union; the country had been in this fixed position since 1865. Robinson&#x27;s primary goal as governor was to help the island become a part of the union. After observing the politics in the island for a few months, he became sure that financial necessity would be the only way for the union to be accepted.

Robinson believed that a good way to carry this out would be to build a railway. He was able to convince James Colledge Pope to pass a railway act in April 1871. In October 1871, the railway started to be built, and in September the next year, Robinson stated that &quot;with the Railway debt upon their shoulders . . . the majority of the people will before long give their voices in favor of Confederation.&quot; He reported again in September 1871 that the island would be able to join the union in several months. Robert Poore Haythorne, the premier of the island, was finally compelled to consult the Canadians regarding the union in February 1873. The island became a part of the Dominion of Canada on 1 July 1873. Robinson was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) the same year for completing this task, the day when the island united with the dominion. He ended his term in November 1873, his mission accomplished. Robert Hodgson was his successor.

Robinson became the governor of the Leeward Islands in 1874. He was appointed Governor of Western Australia on 14 November 1874, and served from 11 January 1875 until 6 September 1877. Afterwards, Robinson was made governor of the Straits Settlements, a group of British territories in Southeast Asia whose headquarters were in Singapore, in 1877. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) the same year. Robinson travelled to Bangkok in 1878, so that he could provide the Knight Grand Cross of St Michael and St George to the King of Siam, and he subsequently received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Siam.

Shortly after returning, Robinson was made governor of Natal; however, he was replaced by the British Government before he was able to serve. He served a second term as governor of Western Australia from 10 April 1880 to 17 February 1883. Throughout this period, Robinson discovered that he had little power as governor of Western Australia and found it difficult to control the government, hindering his performance as governor. &quot;Let no man take charge of such a form of government who is not as patient as Job, as industrious as a Chinaman, and as ubiquitous as a provincial mayor in France,&quot; he said to his colleagues. However, he developed a reputation of good administration and cooperation with leaders in London who were higher ranked than himself, which helped him with his future appointment as South Australia governor when this term ended.

== Later career (1883–1895) ==
Robinson served as the governor of South Australia, beginning in February 1883; the song &quot;Unfurl the Flag&quot;, which he had composed, was played during his inauguration in Adelaide. Due to few important political events occurring in the late 1880s and the fact much of the political power was within the Premier and the legislative assembly, Robinson had little to do as governor, making his role primarily needed solely for symbolic and social purposes.

Robinson was passionate about music, playing the violin, piano, and singing. Throughout his time as governor of South Australia, he was involved with music-related groups. Robinson organised the Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition in 1887 and was largely responsible for instituting the Bachelor of Music course at the University of Adelaide. He had composed multiple songs previously in his life, including &quot;Imperfectus&quot;, &quot;I love thee so&quot;, &quot;Remember me no more&quot;, &quot;Severed&quot;, and &quot;Thou art my Soul&quot;, which by this point had become well known in Australia. Robinson also composed a whole comic opera, which was presented at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, Victoria. Performing in a variety of different events throughout the 1880s, he entertained the most people at Government House of any Australian governor.

In addition to composing music, Robinson was a part of literary and educational groups in Australia. &quot;The Physical Geography of the South-West of Western Australia&quot;, a paper he wrote and had published in 1886, was read to the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, as well as &quot;On Duty in Many Lands&quot;, which was published in 1884. Robinson was also a public speaker. He departed from Adelaide in 1889.

Robinson was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on 24 May 1887. Also in 1887, he turned down a request for his governorship of Hong Kong, as he did not want to undergo its harsh climate. During 1889, from 9 March to November, while Henry Brougham Loch was away, he acted as governor of Victoria, Australia, but was never officially appointed to the position permanently. Due to Robinson&#x27;s success as temporary governor, the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier were planning to request for Robinson to become the next governor once Loch&#x27;s governorship concluded, but Lord Hopetoun was appointed before they got the chance. A new divergence had been taken up by the British Government, giving highly ranked positions in the government to noblemen who were inexperienced, which annoyed Robinson. Shortly afterwards, Robinson rejected the governorship of Mauritius.

After his temporary governorship of Victoria, Robinson travelled to London, England. There he assisted the delegation of Western Australia and the Colonial Office by helping pass the constitution bill through parliament. In September 1890, he went to Perth, Western Australia. Robinson became the governor of Western Australia for a third time in October 1890; his return was praised enthusiastically by the citizens. According to the Australian Dictionary of National Biography, &quot;he knew and understood more about Western Australia than any other imperial officer.&quot; Robinson chose John Forrest to be the first Premier of Western Australia. Robinson had little to do involving politics as governor, due to the fact that Forrest was dominant over the cabinet and parliament, as well as because of constitutional conventions. His time as governor included the transition of the colony to self-governance in 1890. Robinson was offered the position of the colony&#x27;s first agent general by Forrest 1891; however, he declined the offer.

== Retirement and death ==
Robinson retired from his governing career in March 1895, when he was 61 years old. Thereafter, he travelled to London and became the director of many companies. Robinson died on 2 May 1897, two years after his retirement, in South Kensington, London, within the 5 Cromwell Houses, which he resided in. At the time of his death, he and his wife had two daughters and three sons. He had £84,058 () estate money left after his death. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote the following in his obituary:

== Honours ==
* Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (C.M.G), 1873
* Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (K.C.M.G), 1877
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (G.C.M.G), 1887

In central Perth, Robinson Avenue, Robinson Road and Cleaver Street were named after Robinson (whose second name was Cleaver).

In the Pilbara region of Western Australia, the natural harbour Port Robinson (also known as Anketell Port), and the townsite of Cleaverville (gazetted, but never occupied), as well as Cleaverville Creek were named after Robinson.

In Hawaiian, &quot;kaha&quot; means “to mark, draw, place, turn or surf” and “na” means “belonging to”.

<text>Biuletyn Informacyjny (&quot;Information Bulletin&quot;) was a Polish underground weekly published covertly in General Government territory of occupied Poland during World War II. The magazine was edited by Aleksander Kamiński and distributed as the main organ of ZWZ-AK headquarters in Warsaw, initially in order to inform the AK soldier about ongoing resistance activities. By 1944 &quot;Biuletyn Informacyjny&quot; had a circulation of 42,000-43,000 copies. The publishers recommended readers to have the articles reprinted in provincial underground publications throughout Poland.

==History==

The Bulletin was started in November 1939 in Warsaw as the main press release of the SZP, the first underground resistance organisation in Poland. Soon it was taken over by the Armia Krajowa and the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Polish government-in-exile. Since 1941 it had also several regional versions in all major cities of Poland, both under German and Soviet occupation. During the Warsaw Uprising it was published openly as a daily, the main press release of the Polish forces. After the capitulation of Warsaw it was published in Kraków until the dissolution of AK in January 1945.

On October 3, 1944, the &quot;Biuletyn Informacyjny&quot; published the following communiqué signed by Lieutenant-General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Army, after signing the act of surrender:

<text>Sir Harry St. George Ord (17 June 1819 – 20 August 1885) was a British colonial administrator who served as Governor of Bermuda between 1861 and 1864, Governor of the Straits Settlements between 1867 and 1873, and Governor of Western Australia between 1877 and 1880.

==Education and career==
Ord was the son of Henry Gough Ord and grandson of Craven Ord (1756–1832) of Greenstead Hall, Essex, a prominent antiquarian. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, (1835–1837). He served in the Royal Engineers, (1837–1856), principally in the West Indies, West Africa, and the Anglo-French expedition to the Baltic (1854), during the Crimean War.

Ord later held many important colonial posts, including:
* Commissioner of the Gold Coast (1855–1856)
* Commissioner at the Courts of Paris and The Hague (1856–1857)
* Governor of Dominica (1857–1861)
* Governor of Bermuda (1861–1864)
* Special Commissioner to West Africa (1864–1867)
* Governor of the Straits Settlements (1867–1873)
* Governor of Western Australia (1877–1880)

==Governor of Straits Settlements==
Sir Harry Ord, whom the second Colonial Office appointed in 1867 as the Governor of the Straits Settlements, was at first given no instructions regarding the Colony&#x27;s relations with the Malay States. His appointment did not start well; he would arrive at the Settlements two weeks before his term began, and by the time he was inaugurated, had managed to offend almost everyone in the capital including Chief Justice Designate Peter Benson Maxwell with his crusty demeanor and insistence on being referred to as &#x27;Excellency&#x27;. He was unpopular in the Straits Settlements, but was an ambitious and energetic man, who was ready to do what he could to restore order and promote trade in the Peninsula. Conditions in Malaya at that time were extremely unsettled. Within months of his arrival, representatives of the leading firms had formed the Straits Settlement Association under the leadership of John Crawfurd, which vigorously opposed any increase in government power and would bombard his administration with numerous petitions to the House of Lords criticising many of his policies.

More pressing however were the numerous quarrels of the Malays, intensified by feuds between competing groups of Chinese miners, and the links of the Chinese with the British settlements threatened to involve these too in the trouble. After some experience of negotiating with Malays and Siamese, Ord worked out a policy under which he proposed to share the supervision of the Peninsula between Britain and Siam. This policy was disapproved by the Colonial Office, and Ord was directed to abstain from all interference in the affairs of the Malay States. 

==Life==

Ord married Julia Graham of Exmouth daughter of Admiral James Carpenterin on 28 June 1846 by whom he had three sons. Sir Harry Ord died on 20 August 1885 from heart attack and was buried in the churchyard of St. Martin&#x27;s parish church in Fornham St. Martin, Suffolk, England. The village institute in Fornham was built in Ord&#x27;s memory with funds donated by the Abu Bakar of Johor.

The Ord River in the Kimberley region of Western Australia was named in his honour, as was Ord Street, Fremantle.

<doc id="1066323" wikidata="Q1286470" url="?curid=1066323" title="Frederick Broome">
<text>Sir Frederick Napier Broome (18 November 1842 – 26 November 1896) was a colonial administrator in the British Empire, serving in Natal, Mauritius, Western Australia, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. The Western Australian towns of Broome and Broomehill are named after him. He has signed his name as F. Napier Broome.

==Early life==
The eldest son of Rev. Frederick Broome, rector of Kenley, Shropshire, by his wife Catherine Eleanor (eldest daughter of Lieut.-Colonel Napier, formerly Superintendent, Indian Department, Canada) Broome was born in Canada and educated at Whitchurch Grammar School, Shropshire. When visiting England in 1865, he married Mary Anne Barker on 21 June. The couple moved to New Zealand where Broome had a sheep station, in the Malvern Hills, province of Canterbury.

==Career==

===Journalist and poet===
Broome returned to London in 1869, and for the following six years was a regular contributor to &quot;The Times&quot;, being the newspaper&#x27;s correspondent at the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s marriage at St. Petersburg, and on many other occasions. He also wrote literary reviews, art critiques, and miscellaneous articles. He published two volumes of verse, &quot;Poems from New Zealand&quot; (1868) and &quot;The Stranger of Seriphos&quot; (1869), and contributed verse to the &quot;Cornhill&quot;, &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and other periodicals.
===Administrator===
In 1870 he was appointed secretary to the St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Completion Fund, and, in 1873, secretary to the Royal Commission on Unseaworthy Ships, and held for some time a commission in the Essex yeomanry. He was selected by the Earl of Carnarvon, in 1875, to proceed with Lord Garnet Wolseley on a special mission to Natal, as colonial secretary of that colony. He held that post until 1878, when he was promoted to the colonial secretaryship of Mauritius, where he administered the government in 1879, and was lieutenant-governor of the island from 1880 to 1888. He was the 14th governor of Mauritius from 9 Dec 1880 to 5 May 1883. He was created CMG in 1877, and KCMG in 1884

On receiving the news of Britain&#x27;s military disaster at Isandlwana (1879), he despatched at once to the assistance of Lord Chelmsford nearly the whole of the garrison of the colony, including a half battery of artillery, For which he was warmly thanked by the governor and high commissioner of the Cape Colony, Sir Bartle Frere, and by the colony of Natal through its lieutenant governor, Sir Henry Bulwer.

===Governor of Western Australia===

On 14 December 1882 he was appointed governor of Western Australia, and assumed office in June 1883. He visited England in 1885, when, with the &quot;view of extending knowledge of the resources of what was at that time a little known colony&quot;, he read a paper on &quot;Western Australia&quot; before the Colonial Institute, H.R.H. the Prince of Wales taking the chair. That year he donated a small but important collection of Aboriginal artefacts from Western Australia to the British Museum.

His term as governor of Western Australia was marked by great extension of railways and telegraphs, and general progress. When the colony was preparing for responsible government, Broome acted as intermediary between the Legislative Council and the British secretary of state. After considerable correspondence, the details of the new constitution were settled, and a bill, approved by Her Majesty&#x27;s Government, finally passed the local legislature in 1889. Since complementary legislation was needed from Westminster to transfer Crown lands to the colonial legislature, the necessary bill was at once introduced by Lord Knutsford, and passed the House of Lords; but, owing to strong opposition to handing over an immense tract of Crown lands to the colonists, which suddenly showed itself in the home press and in the House of Commons, the bill could not be proceeded with in the House in 1889, and had to be deferred to the following year.

Sir Frederick and two leading members of the Western Australian legislature travelled to England in December 1889 to give evidence before a select committee of the House of Commons, to which, early in the session of 1890, the Constitution Bill was referred. Much to the surprise of the London press, the committee reported in favour of the bill and of the transfer of all lands to the colony.

Consequently, the British Parliament passed a bill for the whole of the lands of the vast territory—1,060,000 square miles—to be freely handed over to the legislature of Western Australia, which thus obtained its new constitution on the same basis as the other colonies of the continent, there being no opposition to the bill in the House of Lords. Broome finally left Western Australia in December 1889, on a mission to England in connection with the Constitution Bill, and his tenure as governor ended in September 1890. One source states &quot;Disputes with his senior officials tarnished Broome’s reputation in the Colonial Office.

Broome was transferred to serve as acting governor of Barbados in the West Indies and, in July 1891, was appointed governor of Trinidad.

He died in London in 1896 and was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Sir Gerard Smith, (12 December 1839 – 28 October 1920), a member of the Smith and Carington family, was a business leader, politician, and Governor of Western Australia from 1895 to 1900.

==Early life==
Gerard Smith was born on 12 December 1839 in Pimlico, London. He was the third son of Martin Tucker Smith (1803–1880), politician, banker and director of the East India Co., and Louisa (Ridley) Smith. His paternal grandfather was John Smith (1767–1842), a banker and Tory Member of Parliament, and his maternal grandfather was Matthew White Ridley, a baronet.

==Career==
Smith joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers as an ensign in 1857 and briefly saw service in Canada, retiring from the army in 1874. He joined the family bank, Samuel Smith, Bros. &amp; Co., and went on to become a business leader in Kingston-upon-Hull, being instrumental in the formation of the Hull and Barnsley Railway in 1880. He succeeded his second cousin William Carington as a Liberal MP for Wycombe from 1883 to 1885, and was a Groom in Waiting to Queen Victoria in the same period.

In 1895, Smith was appointed Governor of Western Australia and knighted. He served as Governor until 1900.

==Freemasonry==
Smith was a Freemason, being initiated into Studholme Lodge No. 1591 on 4 May 1880 at the age of 41. He was subsequently passed to the Second Degree and raised to the Third Degree within two months, and on 17 January 1890, became Worshipful Master of the Lodge. As was usual, when he was appointed Governor of Western Australia he was also appointed Past Junior Grand Warden of United Grand Lodge of England.

In 1898 he was appointed District Grand Master of the District Grand Lodge of Western Australia. He was a supporter of the Grand Lodge movement then active in the colony, allowing his lodges to discuss the question. When the Grand Lodge of Western Australia was consecrated on 27 February 1900, he was elected as its first Grand Master.

However, as his term as Governor was rapidly drawing to a close, he remained Grand Master for only one year.

==Death==
Smith died in London on 28 October 1920. His wife predeceased him in 1915.

<doc id="1066333" wikidata="Q710331" url="?curid=1066333" title="Arthur Lawley, 6th Baron Wenlock">
<text>Arthur Lawley, 6th Baron Wenlock, (12 November 1860 – 14 June 1932) was a British colonial administrator who served variously as Administrator of Matabeleland, Governor of Western Australia, Lieutenant-Governor of the Transvaal, and Governor of Madras. The fourth and youngest son of the 2nd Baron Wenlock, he attended Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, before joining the military. Serving in the Mahdist War, he reached the rank of captain before resigning his commission to pursue other interests. Lawley was then private secretary to his uncle, the 1st Duke of Westminster, and subsequently to the 4th Earl Grey, who he followed to Rhodesia.

Representing the British South Africa Company, Lawley was Administrator of Matabeleland from 1896 to 1901, during the conclusion of the Second Matabele War. He was then Governor of Western Australia for a brief period, from 1901 to 1902, before returning to Africa to serve as Lieutenant-Governor of the Transvaal (under Viscount Milner, the governor). The Transvaal had been incorporated into the empire following the Second Boer War, and Lawley bore much of the responsibility for administrating the colony, remaining lieutenant-governor until 1905. The following year, he was made Governor of Madras, serving until 1911 and overseeing the reform of the Madras Legislative Council. Prominent in the Red Cross during the First World War, Lawley succeeded the youngest of his older brothers as Baron Wenlock in 1931, but died a year later. His only son had died in a hunting accident in 1909, and the title consequently became extinct upon his death.

==Early life and education==
Lawley was born in 1860 to Beilby Lawley, 2nd Baron Wenlock, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth (née Grosvenor), a daughter of the 2nd Marquess of Westminster and a granddaughter of the 1st Duke of Sutherland. He was their seventh child to the couple and their fourth and youngest son. He was educated at Eton, where he became President of the Eton Society and Editor of the &quot;Eton Chronicle&quot;.

In October 1879, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge. However, Lawley did not complete his studies at Cambridge. Instead, he went in 1880 to the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 10th Hussars in 1882. He served in India and in fought in the Sudan Mahdist War seeing action at Suakin (1884). In 1885 he was promoted to captain and served in the United Kingdom until 1892. Upon retiring from the army, he became involved in politics, serving as the private secretary to his uncle, the Duke of Westminster from 1892 to 1896, after which he was appointed secretary to Earl Grey, who went to administer Rhodesia after the Jameson Raid.

==Administrator of Matabeleland==
When Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, was sent to Salisbury to replace Sir Leander Starr Jameson, Lawley was in due course appointed the acting administrator of Matabeleland representing the British South Africa Company. In November 1896, he was appointed Deputy Administrator for Matabeleland. He served as Administrator of Matabeleland from 1897 to 1901. In 1898, Lawley led a mission to the court of Lewanika, the king of Barotseland.

Lawley later wrote a detailed account and a diary of his journey to Barotseland and his experiences. An agreement was signed at the Victoria Falls on 21 June 1898 between King Lewanika and Captain Arthur Lawley with Robert Coryndon, the resident in Barotseland as witness. The ivory seal with its gold handle used by Lawley to endorse the Treaty is in The National Trust Collection at Tyntesfield.

The Second Matabele War, which began after the failure of the Jameson Raid in January 1896, concluded during Lawley&#x27;s residence in Bulawayo with a victory for British settlers and a Peace Agreement on 13 October 1896, reached by Cecil Rhodes meeting with the Matabele Chiefs in the Matopos Hills. On the departure of Earl Grey in July 1897, Lawley succeeded Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, as the Administrator of Matabeleland and served from 1897 to 24 January 1901. As Deputy-administrator, Lawley participated in the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria. As Cecil Rhodes was unwell, Captain Arthur Lawley gave the speech opening the Railway from Mafeking to Bulawayo on 4 November 1897. Captain Lawley sent half the force which relieved Mafeking under the command of Colonel Plumer in May 1900. He was in close contact with Colonel Robert Baden Powell, who later served under him as Chief of Police in the Transvaal.

==Governor of Western Australia==
Lawley was knighted and appointed Governor of Western Australia in February 1901, and arrived in Albany aboard the ship &quot;Ophir&quot;, along with the Duke and Duchess of York (about to commence a royal tour). Lawley&#x27;s official term as Governor of Western Australia ran from 1 May 1901 to 14 August 1902. One of his first duties was to represent Western Australia at the opening of the first Federal Parliament in Melbourne on 9 May 1901.

Despite only being governor for a little over 15 months, the inconclusive results of the 1901 state election meant that Lawley was met with five different governments during his time in office. He received the resignation of George Throssell on 21 May 1901, and commissioned George Leake as the new premier six days later. Leake&#x27;s first government fell on 21 November 1901, but his replacement, Alf Morgans, was unable to form a new ministry, and resigned on 23 December 1901. Lawley then re-appointed Leake as premier. Leake almost immediately requested that Lawley dissolve parliament and order a new election, but Lawley refused, citing the precedent established by Lord Canterbury (the Governor of Victoria), in 1872, when he refused a dissolution to Charles Duffy. Despite this, Leake&#x27;s government endured until his premature death on 24 June 1902. The final premier of Lawley&#x27;s governorship, Walter James, was appointed on 1 July 1902.

In December 1901, Lawley toured the south-western parts of the province along with the Governor General Lord Hopetoun, a friend from Eton College. His tenure also witnessed instability in the Perth City Council. Lady Lawley devoted herself to numerous charities in particular the children&#x27;s hospice at Cottesloe, known as Lady Lawley Cottage. The suburb of Mount Lawley in Perth is named after Lawley. Lawley laid the foundation stones of the Supreme Court of Justice and the Parliament of Western Australia.

==Lieutenant-Governor of the Transvaal==
On the recommendation of Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner, Lawley was appointed as Lieutenant-Governor of the Transvaal in July 1902. The Transvaal Colony had been established on the area which was previously the Boer republic of the same name, and Lawley was its first lieutenant-governor. He arrived in Pretoria at the end of August and was sworn in as lieutenant governor of the Transvaal on 29 September 1902, serving as such until December 1905.

South Africa in 1902 was emerging from the bitter conflict of the Second Boer War and under the leadership of Lord Milner, the Lieutenant Governor of the Transvaal had the arduous task of post war reconstruction. The visit of Joseph Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary, greatly facilitated this and generous financial provision was made for rebuilding the devastated farms and settlements. However given that Britain had just conquered the Transvaal with its rich gold fields, diamond and platinum mines, this was the very least that could be expected. The administration brought in new cattle to restock the farms, tackled disease among livestock, and re-opened the mines controversially using imported Chinese labour in the Rand Goldfields, an idea backed by Lord Milner. Joseph Chamberlain went with Lawley on a tour of the Transvaal and endeavoured to establish cordial relations with the defeated Boers. On 25 June 1905, the Cullinan Diamond was discovered at the Premier Mine, near Pretoria. The diamond, which was cut to create the four Stars of Africa, was presented by Louis Botha, the First Prime Minister of South Africa, to King Edward VII in 1907.

Lawley&#x27;s administration also saw the legislation introduced, which led to the creation of the Kruger National Park. and the University of the Witwatersrand. At one of the schools established at that time by Bishop William M. Carter and the Mirfield Fathers, a young Desmond Tutu received his education.
Lawley&#x27;s administration undertook the task of demarcating and allotting separate reserves in the Transvaal for indigenous Africans. In the end, Lawley set aside only about 3% of the Transvaal for Africans.

In 1903, due to petitions from Boer farmers, the government of Transvaal permitted them access to Kgatla reserves in the Bechuanaland protectorate to recover their stolen cattle on the condition they reciprocate by offering the Kgatla access to their own settlements. The Kgatla responded by requesting Lawley to merge Kgatla reserves in Bechuanaland and the Crown colony into a single settlement.

The Kgatla request was framed to enable their chief Lentshwe gain complete sovereignty over all the lands occupied by the Kgatla from the Boers during the Second Boer War. The request was turned down by Lawley, who, however, permitted Lentshwe to appoint his brother Ramono as his deputy over Saulspoort.

During his tenure, Lawley had reservations about Lord Milner&#x27;s policy of importing cheap Chinese labour into Transvaal to work in the gold mines. Nonetheless, he pointed out the extent of success that had attended their work. The town of Lawley in Transvaal is named after Arthur Lawley. Mohandas Gandhi founded his Tolstoy model farm near the town of Lawley. Lawley encountered Mohandas Gandhi in the Transvaal and Gandhi wished him well when he was appointed Governor of the Madras Presidency in India.

==Governor of Madras==

While serving as Lieutenant-Governor of Transvaal, Lawley was appointed Governor of Madras on 28 December 1905 at a monthly pay of Rs. 10,000. He took office on 28 March 1906 succeeding The Lord Ampthill. Lawley&#x27;s eldest brother Beilby Lawley, 3rd Baron Wenlock had also served as the governor of Madras from 1891 to 1896. The Madras Legislative Council was completely reformed according to the Indian Councils Act 1909 and enlarged during his time. Lawley undertook a fifteen tours to acquaint himself of the administrative machinery prevailing in the Presidency. He took the opportunity to visit schools, hospitals and prisons, to meet with peasants, politicians, farmers and businessmen and to consult with government officials. During his tenure, the Madras Estates Land Bill was passed. In 1906, the Arbuthnot Bank of Madras crashed precipitating one of the worst financial disasters of the 20th century. Lawley, who was himself one of the stockholders, tried to raise public funds to rescue investors. The disillusioned investors eventually responded by founding the Indian Bank. At the end of 1908 Lawley introduced the Morley-Minto reforms which brought Indian representation into the government of Madras. He appointed the Maharaja of Bobbili to be the first Indian to have membership of the Executive.

Lawley also promoted the building of railways and encouraged modern agriculture and industrial development. With his close friend the Maharaja of Mysore he promoted technical education. In 1910 there was an Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition in Mysore.

The newly constructed building housing the Government Museum, Chennai was opened by Lawley on 5 September 1906. Lawley inaugurated the Victoria Memorial Hall in Madras on 28 March 1909 in memory of Queen Victoria. In 1910, Lawley unveiled a portrait of Queen Victoria inside the Victoria Public Hall after the building was acquired by the Suguna Vilas Sabha. On 27 October 1911, Lawley presided over the Annual Day function of the Madras Sanskrit College and presented diplomas to meritorious students.

Lawley inaugurated the Giffard School block of the Women and Children&#x27;s Hospital in Egmore in October 1911. On 1 November 1911, Sir Arthur Lawley opened the Lady Lawley Nurses Home. Their Excellencies were garlanded with extravagant garlands of flowers. The nurses&#x27; quarters was established opposite to the hospital and named after Lady Lawley.

==Later life and death==
In August and September 1912 he visited Canada at the instigation of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill. He gave speeches in Ottawa and Winnipeg on the subject of &quot;Canada, the Royal Navy and the Empire&quot;. The purpose was to encourage Canada to build Dreadnoughts for the Royal Navy. In May 1913, Lawley was Deputy Leader of the British Empire Delegation to the United States to celebrate 100 years of peace between Britain and the U.S.A. He delivered memorable speeches in New York, Washington, Philadelphia and Chicago. A photograph illustrating the arrival of the delegation was taken in New York on 7 May 1913. On 19 November 1914, he accompanied Lady Roberts to the State Funeral in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral of her husband, Field Marshal Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts of Kandahar. During the First World War, Lawley served as a Commissioner of the British Red Cross Society in Boulogne, France. In 1917 he served as Red Cross Commissioner in Mesopotamia and liaised with the Indian Red Cross because so many Indian soldiers were injured in Mesopotamia.

In 1919, Lawley represented Britain at the Founding of the International Red Cross at Versailles. In 1920 he was asked by Earl Haig to found the Officers&#x27; Section of the British Legion. In his later life, he served as the director of numerous London-based companies including Forestal in Argentina. In 1927 Lawley and Lady Lawley visited the Fairbridge Farm School at Pinjarra, Western Australia, and Lady Lawley Cottage. He remained president of the Child Emigration Society until 1929. He succeeded his brother, Reverend Algernon George Lawley, who died without an heir, as the 6th Baron Wenlock in June 1931.

Lord Wenlock died on 14 June 1932 at Freiburg, in Baden Württemberg, Germany, and was interred at St Helen&#x27;s Church Escrick, Yorkshire. As he had no surviving sons, he was the last Baron Wenlock.

==Legacy==
A road in Coimbatore in southern India is named after him. The Lawley Institute in Ooty, a gentlemen&#x27;s club, commemorates his governorship of the Madras Presidency. Mount Lawley, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia is named after him, as is Lawley, Gauteng, a township in Johannesburg. Lawley&#x27;s Court Dress as Governor of Madras is kept in the National Trust Victorian House of Tyntesfield.

Lady Lawley lived there from 1939 until her death in 1944 and many things in the house belonged to Sir Arthur and Lady Lawley. Portraits of Sir Arthur Lawley as Governor of Western Australia, Lady Lawley painted in Madras in 1911, and of their son Richard Edward Lawley are to be seen at Tyntesfield. There were two dozen photo albums kept at Tyntesfield which were loaned to the Empire and Commonwealth Museum. Many of the photographs can be seen in the biography – Sir Arthur Lawley, Eloquent Knight Errant (see below).

==In Literature==
Immortalized by R.K. Narayan through all his books set in the fictional town of Malgudi. The main road in that town is Lawley Road. There is a statue of Lawley there. The road features in most of Narayan&#x27;s stories. There is even one of a supposed historic visit of Lawley in the past.

==Family==
On 15 October 1885, he married Annie Allen Cunard (1863–1944), a daughter of Sir Edward Cunard, 2nd Baronet. The Baroness Wenlock was appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1917.

==Plot==
A 16-year-old (delinquent schoolgirl) named Saki Asamiya is offered by the police to become an undercover detective to escape prison. She initially refuses, so the police blackmail her by offering to pardon her mother, who is on death row for killing her husband, eventually forcing her to accept. Put under the tutelage of officer Kyouichiro Jin, she is given a metal yo-yo that doubles as a weapon as well as a police badge, and is made to infiltrate high schools around Japan to investigate and stop criminal activities. Her first destination is her former school, Takanoha High School, where Saki&#x27;s place has been taken by the three Mizuchi sisters and their ring of illegal activities.

==Characters==
:The bitter heroine of the story, a natural born fighter who enjoys getting into scuffles with various people. Saki is blackmailed into becoming a secret investigator. She never backs down and is very stubborn. Her main weapon is a steel loaded yo-yo capable to function as a weapon.

:The man who recruited Saki, a shady police officer who is in charge of the Sukeban Deka program.
:Saki&#x27;s mother. She only loved her other daughter Miyuki and abused Saki as a result, and was arrested for beating her husband to death in front of Saki. Despite Saki&#x27;s efforts to save her from execution, Natsu hates her, especially after Miyuki&#x27;s death, and later joins Shigaraki in order to have Saki dead. In the TV series, she is a completely different character. She never abused Saki and was not guilty of her husband&#x27;s death, although she certainly thought so and could not forgive herself for it.
:Saki&#x27;s ardent admirer, who calls her &quot;his goddess&quot; and follows her all over the school campus.
:Saki&#x27;s best friend. A shy, quiet girl, Junko is a talented artist and she is seen as a threat by Emi Mizuchi who vows to sabotage her. In the OVA after Emi finds her beautiful painting, she has it stolen. Junko is kidnapped, forcefully drugged and then left dead on train tracks. Her death makes Saki&#x27;s mission personal. In the manga, she was killed by Ayumi and her gang, who made it look like a suicide initially, but Saki noticed that Junko was bitten by a venomous snake.
:Saki&#x27;s rival in prison. Agura is a tough, masculine looking woman who dislikes Saki at first but then begins to respect her. Eventually she is released from reform school with Chie, and acts as her bodyguard. She only appeared in the manga.
:Saki&#x27;s kind friend in prison. She only appeared in the manga. She has a pleasant demeanor and is less aggressive than the other girls. She is released from reform school and returns to high school. Chie joins a biology club that loves to collect insects, and since then discovered a species of butterfly that was named after her. She and Agura are eventually involved in a missing persons case that Saki investigates.
:Saki&#x27;s hyper friend who is also very vulnerable and ends up being attacked a lot by the other girls in the prison. To help Saki escape from prison, she ends up seducing the prison warden who is a lesbian. She used to be in a drama club, and often played the roles of men. She only appeared in the manga.
:Jin&#x27;s partner. She only appeared in the manga.
;Hikuidori
:A scheming, sly cellmate of Saki&#x27;s. She has a mole under one eye. Hikuidori becomes friends with Saki at first but then betrays her and turns out to be an informant of Remi&#x27;s. She only appeared in the manga.
:The patriarch of the antagonist Mizuchi crime family. Gozo uses his influence to control his family&#x27;s power over Takanoha High school. He is a politician, and frames his rivals for the crimes committed by his daughters.
:The youngest sister who is an artist. Emi is an egomaniac who sees herself as a great artist when at best her talent is borderline, which leads her to use her father&#x27;s influence to bribe judges and copy the works of other artists. Emi steals Junko&#x27;s work and copies from it to win an art contest. In the OVA she is killed along with her father by a brainwashed assassin sent by Remi. In the manga, Emi is shot by an assassin sent by Remi but survives and is taken to the hospital.
:The dark haired middle child of the Mizuchi family. She has four hulking bodyguards who follow her around for protection. Ayumi is a drug addict and dealer, and is extremely greedy. However, she is the least evil out of the Mizuchi sisters. Despite her cold demeanor, she is loyal to her father and sisters. In both the OVA and manga, she is betrayed and killed by Remi, who gives her a malfunctioning shotgun that backfires, and steals all her money. In the manga, Ayumi rides a motorcycle and controls her own biker gang. She bets on the races for money, and anything goes, including harming the other racers, using traps, or killing other racers. Her favorite tactic is to throw venomous snakes at racers behind her, which bite and kill them.
:The eldest daughter, a beautiful blonde who is completely ruthless and sociopathic. When Remi first arrives at the high school, many of the students admire her because of her striking beauty. She is a former friend to Saki, but she serves as a deadly antagonist to her. She seems to be the least dangerous of the three sisters but in fact is the most. She is responsible for Junko&#x27;s death, setting up Ayumi&#x27;s death to steal her money with a malfunctioning shotgun to fight Saki, and a brainwashed assassin to kill her father Gozo and sister Emi. She refers to Saki about their &quot;blood of madness&quot; but the drama version expands on it by using Saki&#x27;s mother&#x27;s past. Throughout the manga series, Remi goes as far to impersonate Saki&#x27;s sister Miyuki. She even cruelly murders Sanpei to get revenge on Saki as well.
:Ayumi&#x27;s four bodyguards. Only one does all the talking. He is the tallest and his weapon is a wooden sword.
:Another bodyguard uses brass knuckles, the third uses a bike chain, and the fourth bodyguard uses a pair of nunchucks. They appear in the OVA only.
;Ayumi&#x27;s followers
:In the manga, Ayumi&#x27;s followers are two girls, one named Chibi and the other one&#x27;s name is not mentioned. Chibi is small and thin with dark hair while the other girl has feathered blonde hair and is obese. These two girls are very skilled fighters.
;Remi&#x27;s followers
:In the OVA, Remi&#x27;s control method is explained as computer programs and drugs.
:Her true name being Aoko Shigaraki, she is the adoptive granddaughter of Ro and a former close friend of Remi Mizuchi. Trained by Natsu to defeat Saki, she seeks revenge for the death of Remi.

:The leader of the , a sinister organization bent on controlling the schools of the country. He allies dangerously with Shigaraki.

==Media==
===Manga===
The creation of was the result of a misunderstanding between the author Shinji Wada and the editors at Hakusensha. Wada was developing a high school drama, but the publisher expected a detective story starring a high school student. At an impasse, Wada decided to combine the two concepts. Wada first published a pilot chapter titled in the August 5, 1975 ( 15) issue of &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; magazine. Later, became a serial, starting in the January 5, 1976 ( 1) issue of the same magazine, released in 1975. Disappointed that he could never end a complete serial before, Wada planned earlier in production a dramatic final scene in which the protagonist would die. The last chapter of this original planning was serialized in the December 20, 1977 ( 24) issue, and was followed by an epilogue in the January 20, 1978 ( 2) issue.

Following &#x27;s conclusion, Wada started a new serial, , in the March 20, 1978 ( 6) issue of &quot;Hana to Yume&quot;. However, after one year of serialization, the series was poorly received by readers, and Wada stopped it to restart . Wada dubbed it as &quot;part 2&quot;, and resumed in the February 5, 1979 ( 3) issue, announced as a &quot;new series&quot;. The manga ran regularly in &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; until its December 5, 1982 ( 24) issue.

Since the original serialization, has been printed in four different collected editions; the original twenty-two volume publication started on April 20, 1976, and ended on April 25, 1983. Hakusensha released a six-volume edition between March 3, 1987, and April 29, 1987, and a twelve-volume edition between March 23, 1995, and June 21, 1995. The last reprint was done by Media Factory, who published twelve collected volumes between August 23, 2004, and July 23, 2005.

====Spin-offs====
Wada published two short stories set in a parallel universe in the October 1998 and May 1999 issues of Hakusensha&#x27;s &quot;Melody&quot; magazine. He published two more installments in the March and April 2003 issues of Media Factory&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Comic Flapper&quot; magazine. Media Factory later collected the chapters in a volume titled , which they published under the MF Comics imprint on June 23, 2004.

In 2021, almost a decade after Wada&#x27;s death, Akita Shoten launched three spin-off manga series in &quot;Monthly Princess&quot; magazine. The first, , is written and illustrated by Saori Muronaga. It premiered in the February 2021 issue of &quot;Monthly Princess&quot; on January 6, 2021. The second, , is written and illustrated by . It premiered in the March 2021 issue of the magazine on February 5, 2021. The third, , is written by and illustrated by Shingi Hosokawa. It premiered in the September 2021 issue of &quot;Monthly Princess&quot; on August 6, 2021.

===Television series===
The television series, though technically one series made up of three seasons, are essentially self-contained and separate, aside from sharing the same basic themes and premise, and starring popular Japanese idol singers in the main roles, each one replacing the previous as the new Saki Asamiya, taking on her cover identity and yo-yo weapon.

&quot;Sukeban Deka&quot;, the first series from 1985, starred Yuki Saito as the titular character Saki Asamiya. Saito&#x27;s own song &quot;Shiroi Honō&quot; was used as the theme song. Actress Yasuko Endō played Ayumi Mizuchi. Lasting 24 episodes, the series adapted the first part of the manga and was relatively faithful to it, only changing minor points, though it deviated more towards its conclusion. Unlike the manga, where Saki died at the end of a late arc unrelated to the Mizuchi sisters, the series produced an early ending in which Saki seemingly died in a burning building along with her enemy Remi Mizuchi.

The popularity of the first series allowed it to be followed up by in November 1985. This sequel starred Yoko Minamino, as Saito chose not to return in order to focus on her singing career. In accordance, although the series did base most of its storylines in the second part of the manga, Minamino portrayed an original character named Yoko Godai, a mysterious girl from Kansai forced to wear iron masks for most of her childhood. Yoko was liberated from the mask by a police agent named Nishiwaki (Keizo Kanie) that offered her a place in the Sukeban Deka program, and she accepted in exchange for help to find her disappeared dad. In the process, Yoko would be given the name of her presumably dead predecessor, Saki Asamiya, and a similar yo-yo weapon.

&quot;Sukeban Deka II&quot; contained connections to the first series, as Hiroyuki Nagato returned periodically to his role as the Dark Director, while Nishiwaki was revealed to be a former coworker of Kyoichiro Jin. However, in a departure from both the first series and manga, where Saki worked alone most of the time, &quot;Sukeban Deka II&quot; added two sidekicks for the main character: Yukino Yajima (Akie Yoshizawa), the refined heiress of a rich family from Kyoto who was also a Japanese martial arts expert, and Kyoko &quot;Marble Okyo&quot; Nakamura (Haruko Sagara), a street-wise Osaka native who excelled at street fighting and the usage of marbles as weapons. Despite those changes, the series actually surpassed the first in popularity, lasting 42 episodes and bringing the possibility of a third installment.

After the closure of the second season, Toei conceived an independent spin-off named to air before &quot;Sukeban Deka III&quot;. It would be based around ninjas, taking inspiration from Sho Kosugi&#x27;s ninja cinema and Shinji Wada&#x27;s own manga &quot;Ninja Flight&quot;, as well as from &quot;Star Wars&quot;. However, early into production it was decided to merge both &quot;Ninpucho&quot; and &quot;III&quot; into a single series. The result was the official third season, . Launched in October 1986, it starred Yui Asaka as another original character after Minamino declined to return. Yui Kazama, a country girl from Kyushu who was recruited by the Dark Director and given the role of the third Saki Asamiya.

In the story, Yui, the youngest of the Kazama sisters and known as the &quot;Great Sukeban&quot; in Miyazaki, was sent to Tokyo by her foster parent, the monk Osho Taian (Hiroyuki Tanaka). She joined her long lost sisters, Yuka (Yuka Onishi) and Yuma (), at Seiryu Academy and together, they inherited the family&#x27;s ninja art. Their mission was to confront Koji Kashin, a mysterious entity who had been lurking in the shadows for centuries, intending to shroud and dominate the world in darkness. Transformed into a trio of &quot;kunoichi&quot;, they battled Koji Kashin and his army, aided by their mentor Kazuya Yoda (Nagare Hagiwara) and the agent Reia Kido (Satomi Fukunaga). Towards the end of the story, it is revealed that Yui has a twin sister named Sho, who was taken by Koji Kashin and given psychic abilities. Sho was cursed to stop growing physically at the age of 10 and initially opposed Yui but later learned of their kinship. Yui herself rarely used the Saki Asamiya moniker and showed a very different personality compared to Saki and Yoko, and the series was more focused on fantasy than serious urban crime drama.

Despite a strong premiere and an ambitious length of 42 episodes scheduled in advance, &quot;Sukeban Deka III&quot; rapidly lost its momentum and didn&#x27;t do well. During its airing the first feature movie of the franchise was released, &quot;Sukeban Deka The Movie&quot;, which acted as a crossover between &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; (it also starred Ayako Kobayashi, the winner of a national audition grand prix), but it didn&#x27;t help the franchise to recover its success. &quot;Ninja Girl Romance&quot; had its last episode in October 1987, and it was only followed by the feature film &quot;Sukeban Deka the Movie 2: Counter-Attack from the Kazama Sisters&quot;, which featured the characters in a more traditional plot and gave conclusion to their series.

===Feature films===
Two feature films of the TV series were made, followed by a sequel 18 years later.
* &quot;Sukeban Deka The Movie&quot; was released in 1987 during the release of &quot;Sukeban Deka III&quot;. Although it featured characters from both the second and third seasons, starring Yoko Minamino and Yui Asaka, the movie was more of a sequel to &quot;Sukeban Deka II&quot;.
* &quot;Sukeban Deka the Movie 2: Counter-Attack from the Kazama Sisters&quot; (1988). The movie starred Yui Asaka and served as the third series&#x27;s finale.
* &quot;Sukeban Deka: Code Name = Asamiya Saki&quot;, was released in 2006. It was directed by Kenta Fukasaku and starred Aya Matsuura as the new Saki. Her fellow Hello! Project members Rika Ishikawa, Erika Miyoshi and Yui Okada from Biyuden, and from Melon Kinenbi also starred in the movie. Hiroyuki Nagato and Yuki Saito from the original &quot;Sukeban Deka&quot; TV series made special appearances, implying she was the original Saki Asamiya. Out of all three movies, this title is most known and is more accessible, due to it being released on DVD in the U.S. by Magnolia, and in the UK by 4Digital Asia. For its American and UK distribution, the movie was retitled &quot;Yo-Yo Girl Cop.&quot;

===Original video animation===
Released in 1991, the original video animation (OVA) follows closely the events of the first volumes of the manga. It is drawn in the style of the manga, particularly the character designs. One such example is the style of the Mizuchi sisters&#x27; eyes, an example being Reimi Mizuchi, whose eyes would often shift to show off a more villainous appearance, or would narrow like a snake&#x27;s.

Saki Asamiya is given a chance to delay her mother&#x27;s execution by working as an undercover cop and infiltrating Takanoha High School to investigate some mysterious deaths among the student body. Once there, she comes face-to-face with the powerful Mizuchi sisters, who moved in and have taken control after her previous expulsion.

===Video games===
Two games based on the TV series were made at the time: &quot;Sukeban Deka II&quot;, developed and published in 1987 by Sega for the Master System, and &quot;Sukeban Deka III&quot;, developed by Shouei System and published by Toei Animation in 1988 for the Famicom. Both were only released in Japan.

==Reception==
The original manga has been described as a &quot;massively popular gang girl series&quot;, and has sold over 20 million copies in Japan. Erica Friedman of Yuricon classified it as &quot;one of the three classic girl-gang series&quot; along with &quot;Hana no Asuka-gumi&quot; and &quot;Yajikita Gakuen Dōchūki&quot;. Moreover, Friedman said &quot;Sukeban Deka&quot; influenced both and is &quot;the origin of the whole girl-gang madness that filled the 1980s&quot;. She also stated the series paved the way for series such as &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; and &quot;PreCure&quot;. The series&#x27; popularity has proven to be longstanding as the TV drama&#x27;s DVD rerelease sold 130,000 copies in 2005, which prompted Toei to produce the third live-action film. By 2013, it still had impact on popular culture with the TV drama ending inspiring the anime ending of &quot;Kill la Kill&quot;.

Regarding the content, Friedman commented on the atypical level of violence and sex for a &quot;shōjo&quot; manga. She also noted the mix of &quot;shōnen&quot; and &quot;shōjo&quot; art style, and concluded that it is a &quot;shōjo&quot; that can appeal for the &quot;shōnen&quot; public. Carlos Ross, writing about the OVA for &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot;, stated that &quot;Sukeban Deka&quot; &quot;is Asian action drama faithfully translated into the cel medium, and done well, to boot.&quot; Chris Beveridge, writing for &quot;Mania Entertainment&quot;, felt the OVA was &quot;a middle of the road release&quot;. Helen McCarthy in &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies&quot; states that the characters &quot;are nicely drawn&quot;, the blossoming relationship between Saki and Sanpei &quot;is handled convincingly&quot;, and that &quot;teenagers will relate to the story&#x27;s themes of betrayal, powerlessness, and being an outsider&quot;. Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia&quot; description of the series said it had an &quot;essential silliness&quot;, although it is an &quot;entertaining one-joke knockabout&quot;.

<text>Armentières (; , ) is a commune in the Nord department in the Hauts-de-France region in northern France. It is part of the Métropole Européenne de Lille.

The motto of the town is &quot;Pauvre mais fière&quot; (Poor but proud).

==Geography==
Armentières lies on the Belgian border, northwest of the city of Lille, on the right bank of the river Lys.

==History==

In 1668, the town became French, along with most of the rest of French Flanders. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, Armentières acquired fame, being the &quot;City of Fabric&quot;. Industrial weaving, spinning and brewing grew in Armentières, benefitting from the presence of water.

Armentières particularly suffered during the World Wars although the town received two Military Crosses, one for World War I and the second for the Second World War and the Legion d&#x27;Honneur. In Armentières and the surrounding areas, the military cemeteries are places of remembrance for the casualties of the world wars. &quot;Mademoiselle from Armentières&quot; was a popular song among Allied soldiers in World War I.

During World War I, in October 1914, the town was the site of the Battle of Armentières. Later in the war, Armentières was repeatedly shelled by the Germans with mustard gas. In July 1917, 675 civilians were wounded of which 86 died due to lingering residue, as the agent was a new and unknown weapon. In April 1918, German troops shelled the town again. British troops were forced to evacuate the area, but the Germans could not enter for two weeks because of the heavy contamination. Witnesses to the bombardment stated that the shelling was so heavy that liquid mustard gas ran in the streets.

==Population==

===Heraldry===
==Railways==

Armentières has a railway station on the line from Lille to Calais and Dunkirk.

It was commissioned in 1848 by the Chemins de Fer du Nord (Northern Railway Company). The buildings were completed in 1861.

The station is currently served by TER Hauts-de-France trains, on the routes between Lille-Flandres station and Dunkirk, and between Lille-Flandres and Hazebrouck.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Armentières is twinned with:
* Litoměřice, Czech Republic
* Osterode am Harz, Germany
* Stalybridge, England, United Kingdom

==Notable people==
*Amédée Fournier (1912–1992), cyclist, Olympic medalist
*Jean Maurice Fiey (1914–1995), Church historian and Syriacist
*Dany Boon (born 1966), actor and stand-up comedian
*Martin Terrier (born 1997), footballer

==Monuments==

The belfry of Armentières was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005 as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site, and in recognition of their influence in the rise of municipal power in Europe. The belfry, just like the nearing city hall was designed by the architect Louis Marie Cordonnier and is open for visitors and tourists.

==In fiction==

Milady de Winter in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; hides in Armentières. She is caught and executed there.

The bawdy song, &quot;Mademoiselle from Armentières&quot;, was popular amongst British and American troops during World War 1. There are multiple version of the lyrics, that mostly refer to a woman from the town.

<text>Admiral Sir Frederick George Denham Bedford, (24 December 1838 – 30 January 1913) was a senior Royal Navy officer and Governor of Western Australia from 24 March 1903 to 22 April 1909.

==Naval career==
Bedford was born on 24 December 1838, and joined the Royal Navy in July 1852, at the age of 14. He saw early service in HMS &quot;Sampson&quot; and HMS &quot;Vulture&quot;, taking part in several of the operations during the Crimean War 1854–55. As a Commander he served in HMS &quot;Serapis&quot; when that ship took the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) on a tour of India in 1875. He was promoted to captain on 15 May 1876, and was flag captain in HMS &quot;Shah&quot; on the Pacific Station during action with a Peruvian ironclad in May 1877. From 1880 to 1883 he was engaged in administrative work as Captain of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, but the following year he was back in command, this time as captain of the ironclad HMS &quot;Monarch&quot;. After a spell as captain of the cadet training ship HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;, he joined the Board of Admiralty as Junior Naval Lord in December 1889, serving until August 1892. 

Bedford was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station in 1892: in 1894, Bedford was involved in an action against Nana Olomu Chief of Benin. Brohomi was burnt down in 1894 by a combined force of the British Naval Brigade and the Niger Coast Protectorate Force under Bedford and the Consul-General Ralph Moor. It is believed over 500–600 slaves were freed during the operation. On 22 February 1895, a British naval force, under the command of Bedford at the behest of the Royal Niger Company, granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria in 1886, laid siege on Brass, the chief city of the Ljo people of Nembe in Nigeria&#x27;s Niger Delta.

Bedford was back at the Admiralty as he was appointed Second Naval Lord in May 1895, serving as such until May 1899. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 10 May 1897.

In 1899 Bedford was appointed commander-in-chief of the North America and West Indies Station, serving with the flagship . The squadron under his command visited Jamaica and Bermuda in February 1900. He held the North America post until 15 July 1902, when he was succeeded by Vice Admiral Sir Archibald Douglas, and left homebound with the &quot;Crescent&quot;.

Following the succession of King Edward VII, Bedford was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours published on 26 June 1902, and received the insignia in an investiture on board the royal yacht &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot; outside Cowes on 15 August 1902, the day before the fleet review held there to mark the coronation. Bedford took part in the review with the &quot;Crescent&quot;, before the ship was paid off. He was promoted to the rank of admiral on 3 October 1902. After his appointment as governor, he formally resigned from the Royal Navy on 30 May 1903.

==Governor of Western Australia==
Bedford was announced as Governor of Western Australia in early January 1903, appointed later the same month, and formally took up the post on arriving there on 24 March 1903.

On 4 June 1907 he officiated at the opening of the Royal Fremantle Golf Club in Western Australia, but it was not until March 1909 that the complete 18 hole course was available.

Bedford acquired Globe Hill Station with Thomas Frederick de Pledge in 1909 for £35,000.

==Family==

Bedford married Ethel Turner, daughter of E. R. Turner, of Ipswich, in 1880. Lady Bedford accompanied her husband and was mistress of Admiralty House in Halifax, Nova Scotia, until 1902. She took an interest in benevolent work, and frequently performed as a singer at concerts, for charitable purposes.

The couple&#x27;s son was Vice Admiral Sir Arthur Edward Frederick Bedford, who married Miss Gladys Mort of Sydney, Australia. While residing at Easthampnett, their son Frederick, named after his grandfather, who had become a lieutenant in the Fleet Air Arm, was killed in action over St Pauls Bay, Malta on 21 February 1942, aged 22 years, and was buried in Capuccini Naval Cemetery in Kalkara, Malta.

==Legacy and memorials==
Two suburbs of Perth are named after Bedford – Bedford (located in the City of Bayswater) and Bedfordale (located in the City of Armadale). Additionally, a pastoral lease in the Kimberley, Bedford Downs Station, is named after Bedford, as is nearby Mount Bedford.

A memorial to Bedford stands in the entrance lobby of the Chapel at Greenwich Hospital, London.

===Affiliations===
Bedford was affiliated with &quot;TS Bedford&quot;, a former unit of the Australian Navy Cadets.

==Publications==
Bedford authored a publication entitled &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Pocket Book: a Collection of Practical Rules, Notes, and Tables. For the Use of the Royal Navy, the Mercantile Marine, and Yacht Squadrons.&quot; The book was first published in 1875. A 4th edition was published in 1885.

<doc id="1066367" wikidata="Q3523085" url="?curid=1066367" title="Corn Exchange, Manchester">
<text>The Corn Exchange, Manchester is a food court and former shopping centre in Exchange Square, Manchester, England. The building was originally used as a corn exchange and was previously named the Corn &amp; Produce Exchange, and subsequently The Triangle. Following an IRA bomb attack on central Manchester in 1996, it was renovated and was a modern shopping centre until 2014. The building was sold to investors and has been re-developed into a number of food outlets. It is a grade II listed building.

==History==
The first Corn Exchange built on this site was designed by Richard Lane and completed in 1837. By the late 19th century, it was considered too small, and civic officials decided to commission a larger building.

The current building was designed in the Baroque style, and built in two sections. Each section was designed by a different architect, the first by Ball &amp; Elce and built between 1896 and 1899, and the second by Potts, Son, &amp; Hennings and built between 1899 and 1903. 

The volume of trading in corn declined significantly in the wake of the Great Depression of British Agriculture and the building was largely disused in the wake of the Second World War. In the 1960s to early 1980s, while the interior fell into disuse, the rear side of the Corn Exchange on Fennel Street became home to various nightclubs, including &quot;Pips&quot;, an important part of Manchester&#x27;s music scene, where in 1978 Joy Division played their first gig under this name. A number of shops with street access on the building&#x27;s basement level also continued to operate throughout this period. The Corn Exchange was briefly used by the Royal Exchange Theatre Company from 1976 and it served as a filming location for Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; in 1981.

Over time, the interior developed into a large market emporium, and was a gathering place for alternative subcultures. Small stallholders sold items such as clothes, jewellery, historical paraphernalia and second-hand records. Most of the shops were temporary structures built on the central trading floor, while a few operated from the rooms arranged around the perimeter. A café was located in part of the basement, to the northeast of the ground floor.
In 1996, the IRA carried out a bomb attack on central Manchester. All of the Corn Exchange&#x27;s windows were blown in by the blast; the glass dome shattering and falling onto the market area below. Structural and masonry damage were also reported. The landlord invoked a &quot;force majeure&quot; condition in the lease to evict all tenants. Some businesses moved to new premises, mostly in the north of the city, where many foundered. The Corn Exchange was subsequently renovated and reopened as the Triangle Shopping Centre, named in reference to the building&#x27;s shape. In 2005, the then-owners, the Blackstone Group and its UK-based partner, Milligan Retail Resorts International, sold the complex to the Norwich Property Trust, for £67 million.
In 2012, The Triangle was relaunched as Corn Exchange, Manchester and plans were revealed to convert the building into a food outlet and hotel. A demolition company commenced work to strip out modern interior materials and fixtures in 2014, and a food outlet opened in the complex in 2015. An apartment hotel, developed by Roomzzz Aparthotels, opened in 2018. It accommodates a reception area on the ground floor and 114 rooms on the upper floors.

<text>Nubiology is the scientific study of ancient Nubia. The term was coined by Kazimierz Michałowski.

==Origins of Nubiology==

Nubiology refers to the study of ancient civilisations of Nubia, in parts of modern-day Egypt and Sudan. The main location of Nubia was in the Middle Nile from Aswan to Khartoum.

==Nubian civilisations==
Some archaeological sites have shown evidence which indicates that some Nubia civilisations might have been around even longer than some of the early Acheulean phases. Around the Acheulean period they would mostly use large cutting tools, hand axes and cleavers and are sites which are often neighbouring next to areas of Nubia. There were advancements in the north of Nubia in the Kharga Oasis and the Dakhla Oasis, they discovered Acheulean materials around the springs. These springs were artesian springs that were originally lakes which had been filled with warm water, these group would then settle their groups around these areas. There have been Nubia sites that have helped to determine the date the oldest phases of the Middle Stone Age in two different regions of Nubia.

In northern Sudan in the island of Sai there was evidence of two groups of the Middle Stone Ages and the Acheuleans who were identified as Sangoan that both occupied those lands simultaneously. The Sangoan&#x27;s used core-axes as opposed to hand-axes, they had three horizons from 220 to 150 ka ago, the younger hosrizons showed artefacts that were related to the Lupemban Nubian Complex assemblages with examples of red and yellow ochre that may have shown evidence of extra utilitarian activities. There was a constant movement of Nubian immigration into Egypt, there has been evidence of artefacts such as cemeteries, potteries and some indication of Nubian settlements, due to their immigration the Nubians would either return to their home countries or be forced to integrate into Egpytian society and leave behind their former lives. This process is now referred to as ‘acculturation’ or ‘cultural entanglement’, it was also known as ‘creolization’ Aswan as this was the main frontier region for elements of both Egyptian and Nubian cultures. The knowledge and the skills that were brought to Egypt by the Nubians were then implemented by the Egyptians as they were able to use and profit from the Nubias workforce, specific knowledge and their variety of other skills. Nubians were able to have somewhat good communication with their neighbours in the Nile Valley, they kept this due to the changes in climate conditions in Eastern Sahara, the Nile Valley and other Western Desert regions. Archaeological researched showed that these climate changing issues are what led to many people migrating showing the formation of ‘creolization’ and ‘cultural entanglement’.

==Nubiology in the present day==
There are still various projects active in the archaeological field in Egypt and Sudan researching into Nubiology both locally and globally from other international countries with an interest in the area. These projects have been a mixture of both state and non-state archeological organisations or individual reasonings behind these projects. Many of the countries involved in these projects have had involvement in this for large amounts of time, for example many European countries have had large involvement in it dating back over multiple centuries. The number of countries participating in this has been growing over the years, especially within more recent decades. These countries have chosen over the years to participate in archeology and Nubiology for a variety of reasons based on different social and political interests within each country. Most of the organised archaeological projects have to at least some involvement from outside countries such as Japan, Britain, China, Qatar and Russia. This level of involvement is more prominent in Egypt but does also happen in Sudan through co-operation with the Egyptian and Sudanese governments to perform any of the field work. Research into archeology by countries like Qatar in more recent years has become important for more projects as they began to look more into Egypt and especially Sudans Nubiology as a way to provide more of a focus onto their histories, it was a part of Qatar&#x27;s cultural diplomacy that allowed for the increased amount of international recognition and for their national identity. Many of the historians that are researching into Nubiology archaeology now will typically already have previous background knowledge in other similar fields like Egyptology, European, North America and the Middle East. The study of Nubian archaeology has become a more useful subject in order to understand the differing African cultures in areas such as the Middle Nile.

==Important Nubian discoveries==
From 1998 there have been a series of excavations in Banganarti, which is located in the area of Old Dongola in North Sudan, it was a Polish archaeological project that was supervised by Bogdan Żurawski. There was several buildings including the main centre building, the seven chapels, the Lower Church and the Upper Church. The Upper Church that they were able to the uncover was dedicated to the Archangel Raphael and the church was decorated with murals that many of them were eventually destroyed. Within the seven easterns chapels they all had similar murals and a depiction of the Nubian king who was shown as being protected by the archangel and the twelve apostles, they were also depictions of the Nubian kings holding sceptres that showed a small silouette of Jesus Christ on top of them. The buildings within these structures showed there were refuge forts built in Selib, it showed that they had carefully thought how their warning systems and where to take refuge if it was needed. They would either seeks refuge in Selib or in the island of Tanqasi that had a church, a well and a basin used to water flocks. These sites showed that it was preferred by these societies to live in more open settlements around the Middle Nile as it was closer to their fields and then if necessary they could then seek refuge in the Nubian forts when it was required.
Excavation of a site in the Western Desert in Egypt by R. Schild was believed to have artefacts that could be a part of Oldowan, they did an examination of some samples of lag gravel from a sandstone ridge located near Gebel Nabta. Here they were able to find around a dozen flakes, multiple choppers that had been severely abraded and some bifacial discoidal specimens.

From the area around Kaddanarti and Kabrinarti there are three excavation sites near the Third Cataract vicinity that also had evidence of stone finds and bones within the layers of coarse pebbles, it was determined that these artefacts to be Lower Paleolithic and preceded the Acheulean period. The stone finds that were discovered consisted of items like brown flint, petrified wood, flakes and other stone tools including choppers, whislt the bones belonged to large bovids, antelopes, hippopotamus that were largely mineralised. There was also some evidence of a Levallois core that was a type of Nubia found from Kaddanarti which is a core that is usually related to the Middle Stone Age.

<text>&quot;Secrets&quot; is a 1973 BBC Television play by Michael Palin and Terry Jones of one-hour duration, starring Warren Mitchell as the owner of a chocolate factory. The play was part of a series called &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, which featured black and blue (saucy) comedy.

==Story==

A man working high-up on a very tall chocolate mixing vat tries to lean over the vat but overbalances and without being noticed falls in. This now-contaminated chocolate is processed and packed ready for distribution along with the normal production. It is only much later that quality control finds a chocolate containing a thumb to confirm the missing man&#x27;s gruesome fate.

The chocolate company is suffering poor sales and intends to send out chocolates with market research questionnaires to different parts of the country to get customer feedback. Before anyone had missed the worker and shut down the production line to investigate matters, the contaminated chocolates were boxed and sent out with normal production to Worthing. Despite attempts to recover the suspect chocolates, they had all been sold and eaten.

The returned questionnaires were examined carefully to find unsurprising confirmation that people did not like the factory&#x27;s chocolates, except for a group of customers who had been pleasantly surprised by the taste of the new chocolate. Comments like &quot;Wonderful Meaty Flavour&quot; were common and customers were keen to purchase more of the same.

Faced with this dilemma, the factory tried to respond to the apparent demand for meat in its chocolates by blending beef with its chocolate recipe, leading to scenes with loud &quot;mooing and bangs&quot; as workers attempted to process an unfortunate cow. Further market research results were disastrous. There was only one possible conclusion, that the public liked the taste of human flesh. But this solution was not socially acceptable, so they could not &quot;just&quot; include people in their chocolates.

Faced with ever-increasing financial disaster, the factory decided to start a campaign designed to try to alter attitudes to what was effectively cannibalism. They admitted what the source of the new flavour was and attempted to persuade people to donate their bodies for inclusion in the new flavour chocolate, so there would be a fresh supply of &quot;recycling&quot; corpses to flavour the new chocolates.

This eventually proved a great success and the factory flourished to the extent that the chocolates had major advertising slots on TV, culminating in an advert which featured a &quot;Game Show Prize&quot; style of conveyor belt, where instead of prizes, the conveyor passed across the TV screen loaded with a selection of deceased bishops and judges and other notable persons, while viewers were reminded by voice and logo that &quot;Only the Best People Go into Our Chocolates&quot;.

&quot;Soylent Green&quot;, which took an altogether more serious view of a similar subject, was released in the same year. A feature film remake of &quot;Secrets&quot;, &quot;Consuming Passions&quot;, was released in 1988.

==Preservation and DVD release==
The original videotape of the play was wiped by the BBC following a large number of complaints after the first broadcast. The only known surviving version is a VHS copy of a half-inch reel-to-reel domestic videotape recording made by producer Mark Shivas from the master tape at the BBC and transferred onto VHS in the 1980s. In 2004 this version was included as an extra on the Region 2 DVD of Palin and Jones&#x27;s series &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot;. The recording is fuzzy and grainy, and frequently flickers and rolls.

<text>In computing, a naming scheme is a system for assigning and managing names of objects connected into computer networks. It typically consists of a namespace and processes for assigning, storing, and resolving names.

==Naming schemes in computing==
Server naming is a common tradition. It makes it more convenient to refer to a machine by name than by its IP address.

Network naming can be hierarchical in nature, such as the Internet&#x27;s Domain Name System. Indeed, the Internet employs several universally applicable naming methods: uniform resource name (URN), uniform resource locator (URL), and uniform resource identifier (URI).

Naming systems have several other characteristics. The entities that assign and manage names can be distributed, centralized, or hierarchical. Names can be human-readable or not human-readable.

<text>The Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA) is an art museum in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. Located in the Wade Park District of University Circle, the museum is internationally renowned for its substantial holdings of Asian and Egyptian art and houses a diverse permanent collection of more than 61,000 works of art from around the world. The museum provides free general admission to the public. With a $920 million endowment (2023), it is the fourth-wealthiest art museum in the United States. With about 770,000 visitors annually (2018), it is one of the most visited art museums in the world.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The Cleveland Museum of Art was founded as a trust in 1913 with an endowment from prominent Cleveland industrialists Hinman Hurlbut, John Huntington, and Horace Kelley. The neoclassical, white Georgian Marble, Beaux-Arts building was constructed on the southern edge of Wade Park, at the cost of $1.25 million. Wade Park and the museum were designed by the local architectural firm, Hubbell &amp; Benes, with the museum planned as the park&#x27;s centerpiece. The green space takes its name from philanthropist Jeptha H. Wade, who donated part of his wooded estate to the city in 1881. The museum opened its doors to the public on June 6, 1916, with Wade&#x27;s grandson, Jeptha H. Wade II, proclaiming it, &quot;for the benefit of all people, forever&quot;. Wade, like his grandfather, had a great interest in art and served as the museum&#x27;s first vice-president; in 1920 he became its president. Today, the park, with the museum still as its centerpiece, is on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Mid to late 20th century expansion===

In March 1958, the first addition to the building opened, doubling the museum&#x27;s floorspace. This addition, which was on the north side of the original building, was designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Hayes and Ruth. They designed new gallery space and a new art library.

The museum again expanded in 1971 with the opening of the North Wing. With its stepped, two-toned granite facade, the addition designed by modernist architect Marcel Breuer provided angular lines in distinct contrast with the flourishes of the 1916 building&#x27;s neoclassical facade. The museum&#x27;s main entrance was shifted to the North Wing. The auditorium, classrooms, and lecture halls were also moved into the North Wing, allowing their spaces in the Original Building to be renovated as gallery space.

In 1983, a West Wing, designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Dalton, van Dijk, Johnson, &amp; Partners, was completed. This provided larger library space, as well as nine new galleries.

Between 2001 and 2012, the 1958 and 1983 additions were demolished. A new wrap-around building, and east and west wings were constructed. Designed by Rafael Viñoly, this $350 million project doubled the museum&#x27;s total size to (gallery space over . To integrate the new east and west wings with the Breuer building to the north, a new structure was built along the south side of the 1971 addition, creating extensive new gallery space on two levels, as well as providing for a museum store and other amenities. Viñoly covered the space created by the demolition of the 1958 and 1983 structures with a glass-roofed atrium. The east wing opened in 2009, and the north wing and atrium in 2012. The West Wing opened on January 2, 2014.

===Expansion in the 21st century===
The museum&#x27;s building and renovation project, &quot;Building for the Future&quot;, began in 2005 and was originally targeted for completion in 2012 (though it was not completed until 2013) at projected costs of $258 million. The museum celebrated the official completion of the renovation and expansion project with a grand opening celebration held on December 31, 2013, and additional activities that continued through the first week of 2014. The $350 million project—two-thirds of which was earmarked for the complete renovation of the original 1916 structure—added two new wings, and was the largest cultural project in Ohio&#x27;s history. The new east and west wings, as well as the enclosing of the atrium courtyard under a soaring glass canopy, have brought the museum&#x27;s total floor space to (an increase of approximately 65%).

The first phase of the project had $9.3 million in cost overruns; the opening was delayed by 9 months. Museum director Timothy Rub assured the public that the increase in quality would be worth both the wait and expense. In June 2008, after being closed for nearly three years for the overhaul, the museum reopened 19 of its permanent galleries to the public in the renovated 1916 building main floor.

On June 27, 2009, the newly constructed East Wing (which contains the Impressionist, Contemporary, and Modern art collections) opened to the public.
On June 26, 2010, the ground level of the 1916 building reopened. It now houses the collections of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Sub-Saharan African, Byzantine, and Medieval art.
The expanded museum includes enhanced visitor amenities, such as new restrooms, an expanded store and café, a sit-down gourmet restaurant, parking capacity increased to 620 spaces, and a glass-covered courtyard.

On June 12, 2021, Cleveland Museum of Art opened a community arts center in Cleveland&#x27;s Clark-Fulton neighborhood. It hosts former Parade the Circle floats, displays and art that were previously in temporary storage.

==Wade Park==

Wade Park includes an outdoor gallery displaying part of the museum&#x27;s holdings in the Wade Park Fine Arts Garden. The bulk of this collection is located between the original 1916 main entrance to the building and the lagoon. Highlights of the public sculpture include the large cast of Chester Beach&#x27;s 1927 &quot;Fountain of the Waters&quot;; a monument to the Polish expatriate and American Revolutionary War-hero Tadeusz Kościuszko; and the 1928 bronze statuary sundial by Frank Jirouch, &quot;Night Passing the Earth to Day&quot;, which sits across Wade Lagoon from the museum, near the park&#x27;s entrance on Euclid Avenue.

Auguste Rodin&#x27;s &quot;The Thinker&quot; is installed at the top of the museum&#x27;s main staircase. After being partially destroyed in a 1970 bombing (allegedly by the Weathermen), the statue was never restored. Art historians knew that Rodin was involved in the original casting of this sculpture, and it was the last bronze casting of &quot;The Thinker&quot; made during Rodin&#x27;s lifetime. The 1970 damage (noted on a plaque since mounted at the base of the statue&#x27;s pedestal) is considered to have made this casting unique among the more than twenty original large castings of this work.

==Collections==

The Cleveland Museum of Art divides its collections into 16 departments, including Chinese Art, Modern European Art, African Art, Drawings, Prints, European Art, Textiles and Islamic Art, American Painting and Sculpture, Greek and Roman Art, Contemporary Art, Medieval Art, Decorative Art and Design, Pre-Columbian and Native North American Art, Japanese and Korean Art, Indian and Southeast Asian Art, and Photography. Artists represented by significant works include Olivuccio di Ciccarello, Botticelli, Giambattista Pittoni, Caravaggio, El Greco, Poussin, Rubens, Frans Hals, Richard Hunt, Gerard David, Goya, J. M. W. Turner, Dalí, Matisse, Renoir, Gauguin (&quot;The Call&quot;), Frederic Edwin Church, Thomas Cole, Corot, Thomas Eakins, Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Picasso, and George Bellows. The museum has been active recently in acquiring later 20th-century art, having added important works by Warhol, Jackson Pollock, Christo, Anselm Kiefer, Ronald Davis, Larry Poons, Leon Kossoff, Jack Whitten, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Chuck Close, Robert Mangold, Ching Ho Cheng, Mark Tansey and Sol LeWitt, among others.

The museum&#x27;s African art collection consists of 300 traditional, sub-Saharan works from the Bini, Congo, Senufo, and Yoruba peoples, mostly donated by Cleveland collector Katherine C. White. The museum is especially strong in the field of Asian art, possessing one of the best collections in the U.S.

In June 2004, the museum acquired an ancient bronze sculpture of &quot;Apollo Sauroktonos&quot;, believed to be an original work by Praxiteles of Athens. Because the work has a contested provenance, the museum continues to study the dating and attribution of the sculpture. In 2011, Michael Bennet, the Greek and Roman arts curator, announced that he had dated the piece to 350 B.C. to 250 B.C. In 2013, the museum held a focus exhibition on the statue. It announced reattribution of the work as &quot;Apollo the Python-Slayer&quot;, and said that the statue was almost certainly an original work by Praxiteles himself, and that laboratory investigations and expert testimony conclusively show the bronze was neither a recent discovery nor recovered from the sea.

In 2008, the United States Postal Service selected the Cleveland Museum&#x27;s famed Botticelli painting entitled &quot;Virgin and Child with the Young John the Baptist&quot; as the Christmas stamp for that year.

=== Modern European Painting and Sculpture ===

The Cleveland Museum of Art&#x27;s Modern European Painting and Sculpture collection holds pieces dating from 1800 to 1960, and contains about 537 pieces. The collection contains Impressionism and Post-impressionism works, avant-garde art styles, and German Expressionism and Neue Sachlichkeit art.
=== European Painting and Sculpture ===
This collection holds pieces dating from 1500 to 1800, with major works representing Italian Baroque, Spanish Baroque, Italian Renaissance, as well as significant French, British, and Dutch paintings.
=== American Painting and Sculpture ===
The collection is concise, containing about 300 paintings and 90 sculptures. Major attractions in the collection include William Sideny Mount&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Music&quot;, Frederich Edwin Church&#x27;s &quot;Twilight in the Wilderness&quot;, and Albert Pinkham Ryder&#x27;s &quot;The Racetrack (Death on a Pale Horse)&quot;. A number of Cleveland-based artists are also included in the museum&#x27;s holdings, placing an emphasis on local art.

=== Photography ===
The Cleveland Museum of Art contains a small collection of fine art photography, dating back to 1893. Of special note are pieces from photography&#x27;s first contributors, particularly French, English, and American photographers. Other highlights of the collection are &quot;photography with complete sets of &quot;The North American Indian&quot; by Edward S. Curtis and &quot;Camera Work&quot;; surrealist photography created primarily between the two world wars; and Cleveland-specific subject matter produced by regional and national photographers&quot;.

=== Decorative Art and Design ===
An internationally renowned collection, the Decorative Art and Design collection &quot;consists of useful objects in which the form and decoration are the primary focus, not objects intended purely as sculpture&quot;
=== Asian Art ===
=== Ingalls Library ===
In addition to its comprehensive collection of fine art, the Cleveland Museum of Art is also home to the Ingalls Library, one of the largest art libraries in the United States. As part of the initial 1913 plan by the museum&#x27;s founders, a library of 10,000 volumes was to be assembled, to include photographs and archival works. By the 1950s, the collection of books alone had surpassed 37,000 and the photographic collection neared 47,000. By the 21st century, the library had more than 500,000 volumes (and 500,000 digitized slides); renovation of the library space was one of the focal points in the museum&#x27;s $350 million expansion. Established in 1989, the Museum Archives houses documentation about the Cleveland Museum of Art&#x27;s role in the local community and the institutions the Cleveland Museum of Art has interacted with since its founding.

=== ARTLENS Gallery ===

The ARTLENS Gallery is a series of interactive displays and a mobile app that allow visitors to view and interact with the museum&#x27;s digitized collection. ARTLENS is divided into four components:
* The ArtLens Wall is a 40-foot display that lets visitors browse and scale all works that are displayed in the museum, as well as some artworks that are not. The wall rotates through artworks in groups organized by criteria such as type, shape, and color.
* The ArtLens Exhibition is a rotating selection of artworks that are showcased through digital gesture-based games and activities. Examples of these activities are automatically matching the shape of a user&#x27;s hand gestures to an artwork, or having the user imitate poses found in various works, which are then scored for accuracy.
* The ArtLens Studio is a series of digital studios for visitors to make their own artwork, such as creating digital pottery by mimicking a potter&#x27;s movements, or creating collages from images provided by the museum.
* The ArtLens mobile application provides information about the museum and lists of all its artworks. The app is able to communicate via Bluetooth to beacons located throughout the museum to determine the user&#x27;s location, and allows the user to mark and save artworks they come across. The app connects to the previously mentioned ArtLens Exhibition and Wall, and was developed in cooperation with Navizon to create an innovative way to explore museums, by integrating real-time indoor location.

Following the launch of ARTLENS, the Cleveland Museum of Art conducted a two-year study to see how the gallery impacts visitor engagement. Surveys from November 2017 and January 2018 of 438 ARTLENS visitors found that 76% of viewers felt that the gallery &quot;enhanced their overall museum experience&quot;; 74% felt that it &quot;encouraged them to look closely at art and notice new things&quot;; and 73% said that it &quot;increased their interest in the museum&#x27;s collection.&quot; Museum visitors born between 1981 and 1996 were 15% more likely to visit the gallery compared to older individuals. The ARTLENS system also gathers analytical data; the time patrons spent looking at artworks went from an average of two-to-three seconds to fifteen seconds.

==Programs==
The Cleveland Museum of Art also maintains a schedule of special exhibitions, lectures, films and musical programs. The department of performing arts, music and film hosts a film series and the museum&#x27;s Performing Arts Series, which brings the creative energies of internationally renowned artists into Cleveland.

The department of education at CMA creates programs for lifelong learning from lectures, talks and studio classes to outreach programs and community events, such as Parade the Circle&quot;, Chalk Festival and the &quot;Winter Lights Lantern Festival&quot;. Educational programs include distance learning, &quot;Art to Go&quot;, and the &quot;Educator&#x27;s Academy&quot;. The museum is also home to the Ingalls Library, one of the largest art museum libraries in the United States with over 500,000 volumes.

=== Open Access collection materials ===

In January 2019, the Cleveland Museum of Art announced that it was waiving its rights to &quot;roughly 30,000 of the 61,328 objects in its permanent collection considered to be in the public domain&quot;. They are using the Creative Commons – Zero license for high-resolution images and data about its collection. Additionally, metadata for more than 61,000 pieces in its collection have been made available. The Open Access material is available on a special section of the museum website.

==Governance==

===Attendance===
The museum reported attendance of 597,715 during the period between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014, the highest total in more than a decade. In 2018, the museum had a record 769,435 visitors, replacing the previous record of 719,620 in 1987.

===Finance===
In 1958, a $35-million bequest by industrialist Leonard C. Hanna Jr. vaulted the Cleveland Museum of Art into the ranks of the country&#x27;s richest art museums. Today, the museum receives operating support from the Ohio Arts Council through state tax dollars. It is also funded by Cuyahoga County residents through Cuyahoga Arts and Culture. The museum derives around two thirds of its $36 million budget from interest on its endowment, which was reported as $750 million in 2014. The museum has an acquisition fund of $277 million, from which it draws about $13 million a year for purchase of works for its collections.

===Marketing===
The museum has also taken an active role in presenting music concerts and lectures. These include performances by Chanticleer (ensemble), Roomful of Teeth, and John Luther Adams among others.

=== Looted art ===
In 2003 a controversy arose over &quot;The Aviator&quot;, a painting by Fernand Leger which had been owned by the German Jewish art dealer Alfred Flechtheim, due to an unexplained Nazi-era provenance gap. In 2013, the museum announced that it would pay the heirs of Arthur Feldmann in order to keep a drawing confiscated from him by the Nazis before they killed him in the Holocaust. The drawing was &quot;Allegory of Christian Faith&quot;, by the 17th century German artist Johann Liss In 2017, the museum announced that it would return to Italy an ancient Roman marble portrait head of Drusus Minor stolen in 1944 from a provincial museum near Naples. In August 2023, the Antiquities Trafficking Unit of the New York City District Attorney&#x27;s office seized important ancient Roman bronze sculpture from the museum in connection with an investigation into looting and trafficking of ancient art at the site of the ancient Roman town of Bubon in Southwestern Turkey. The museum then sued in the Federal District Court in Ohio to block the seizure, and while other looted works from other museums were returned to Turkey in December, the sculpture remained in the U.S. while the legal process continued. In February 2025, the Cleveland Museum of Art announced plans to repatriate the statue to Turkey.This decision followed extensive research conducted by the Cleveland Museum in collaboration with Turkish authorities at the ancient site of Bubon. The investigation involved collecting bronze and soil samples and creating molds of the statue&#x27;s feet to compare with existing stone bases at the site. Lead isotope analysis confirmed a match, substantiating the statue&#x27;s origin from the Bubon shrine.

==In popular culture==
The museum is the stand-in for the fictional S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and can be extensively seen in several office and establishing shots of the 2014 film &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot;. In several scenes, the museum&#x27;s atrium can be seen as the &quot;lobby&quot; for the Washington, D.C.–based government organization. The outside of the museum and elevator tower are in other shots as well.

<doc id="1066388" wikidata="Q333979" url="?curid=1066388" title="Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland">
<text>Gerald Paul Joseph Cajetan Carmel Antony Martin Strickland, 6th Count della Catena, 1st Baron Strickland, (24 May 1861 – 22 August 1940), usually known between 1897 and January 1928 as Sir Gerald Strickland, was a Maltese and British politician and, eventually, peer, who served as Prime Minister of Malta, Governor of the Leeward Islands, Governor of Tasmania, Governor of Western Australia and Governor of New South Wales, in addition to sitting in the House of Commons and later in the House of Lords in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
Strickland was born in Valletta, the son of naval officer Commander Walter Strickland, from the ancient English Strickland family of Sizergh, and Maria Aloysia Bonici-Mompalao, the niece and heiress of Sir Nicholas Sceberras Bologna, fifth Count della Catena in Malta, whom Gerald succeeded in 1875. He was educated at St Mary&#x27;s College, Oscott, and Trinity College, Cambridge (BA, LLB). Upon graduating, he was admitted to Inner Temple in 1887 entitled to practise as a barrister-at-law. He gained the rank of major in the service of the Royal Malta Militia.

Elected in 1886 to the council of the government of Malta, Strickland began to take an active part in Maltese politics at an early age and in December 1887, he accompanied Dr. Fortunato Mizzi – founder of the Maltese Nationalist Party – to the first Colonial Conference in London to submit a scheme for a legislative assembly. The result was that the new Maltese Constitution of December 1887 was largely based on the joint Strickland-Mizzi proposals. In the following year, he was appointed as Assistant Secretary to Malta in 1888 and held the office of Chief Secretary of Malta in 1889, a post which he held till July 1902 when to avert more troubles in Malta which were created by his orders-in-council to increase taxation, he was appointed as Governor of the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean.

Sir Gerald and Lady Edeline Strickland left Southampton for Antigua in September 1902, and took up residence at Government House, St Johns on arrival. He was appointed as Governor of Tasmania in 1904, serving as such until 1909, and then as Governor of Western Australia from 1909 to 1913. In the early years consequent upon Australian Federation, he was involved in the delicate matter of State rights and the developing nature of the appointment, role and salaries of governors. Appointed as Governor of New South Wales in March 1913, on 30 May 1913 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). He was a supporter of the Eugenics Education Society.

==Political career==
In 1917, Strickland returned to Malta and, after the grant of Self-Government, formed the Anglo-Maltese Party in 1921, which soon afterward amalgamated with the Maltese Constitutional Party to become the Constitutional Party under his leadership. Strickland was the leader of the Opposition between 1921 and 1927. In 1924, he won the seat of Lancaster for the Conservatives in the United Kingdom House of Commons. He left the House of Commons in 1928 upon being made a peer.

After the 1927 election, Strickland had a majority in the Legislative Assembly and became Head of the Ministry (the fourth Prime Minister of Malta) from August 1927 until 1932. Amongst the most important events of his government were the commencement of building works for St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Gwardamanġia and his clash with the Senate, which led to the issue of Letters Patent which curtailed its powers and his concurrent clash with the ecclesiastical authorities. 

On 1 May 1930, Sir Mauro Monsignor Caruana, Titular Archbishop of Rhodes and Bishop of Malta, and Mikiel Monsignor Gonzi, Bishop of Gozo, issued a pastoral letter, read in all the churches of Malta and Gozo. In it, Archbishop Caruana and Bishop Gonzi declared that whoever voted for the Constitutional Party and its former coalition partner, the Labour Party, committed a mortal sin. That year he narrowly avoided assassination.

This mortal sin was also committed by those who read Strickland&#x27;s newspapers, printed by his Progress Press, namely the &quot;Daily Malta Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Ix-Xemx&quot;. He subsequently began publishing &quot;Il-Progress&quot; and &quot;Il-Berqa&quot;. The clash between the Catholic bishops and the Constitutional Party led to the suspension of the Maltese Constitution following consultations between the British Governor and London.

Between July 1932 and November 1933, Strickland was again the leader of the Opposition, and after the grant of a new Constitution in 1939, he became the leader of the elected majority in the Council of Government.

==Personal life==
Strickland married Lady Edeline Sackville-West (1869–1918), the daughter of the 7th Earl De La Warr and the Honourable Constance Mary Elizabeth Cochrane-Wishart-Baillie, on 26 August 1891. They had six daughters, and two sons. Both their sons and one daughter died at an early age. Their first daughter married Henry Hornyold, became known as Mrs Hornyold-Strickland and chaired the Conservative Party Conference in 1947. Strickland and Lady Edeline had the following children:
* Reginald Strickland (1893–1893)
* Hon. Mary Christina Strickland (1895–1970)
* Hon. Cecilia Victoria Strickland (1897–1982)
* Hon. Mabel Edeline Strickland OBE (1899–1988)
* Walter Strickland (1901–1902)
* Margaret Angela Strickland (1903–1903)
* Hon. Henrietta May Strickland (1905–1975), who married Robert Tatton Bower
* Hon. Dr. Constance Teresa Strickland LMSSA (1911–1979)

On 31 August 1926, following the death of Lady Edeline in 1918, Strickland married Margaret Hulton, daughter of the newspaper proprietor Edward Hulton in the same church as his earlier wedding. She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1937 Coronation Honours. Strickland was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1889, for rendering invaluable services during a severe cholera epidemic. He was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1897. He was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Strickland, of Sizergh Castle in the County of Westmorland, on 19 January 1928. He died at Villa Bologna, his residence in Attard, and is buried in the family crypt at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Mdina.

<text>Khải Định (; chữ Hán: 啓定; born Nguyễn Phúc Bửu Đảo; 8 October 1885 – 6 November 1925) was the 12th emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty in Vietnam, reigning from 1916 to 1925. His name at birth was Prince Nguyễn Phúc Bửu Đảo. He was the son of Emperor Đồng Khánh, but he did not succeed him immediately.

==Biography==
Before Emperor Đồng Khánh&#x27;s era came the eras of Emperor Thành Thái and Emperor Duy Tân, both of whom were exiled by the French for their resistance to the colonial regime. After this trouble, the French decided to enthrone Bửu Đảo as he was the son of the monarch who was the most submissive Nguyễn collaborator with the protectorate, standing with the French colonizers and opposing any independence movements, Emperor Đồng Khánh.

Nguyễn Phúc Bửu Đảo became the nominal ruler of Annam on 18 May 1916, after the exile of Duy Tân (Nguyễn Phúc Vĩnh San) and took the name Khải Định for his reign, meaning &quot;auger of peace and stability.&quot; He said he wanted to restore the prestige of the empire, but this was not possible with his close collaboration with the French occupiers. Although not satisfied with his position, Khải Định enacted a policy of close collaboration with the French government and was effectively a puppet political figurehead for the French colonial rulers, following all of their instructions to give &quot;legitimacy&quot; to French policies.

Because of this, Khải Định was very unpopular with the Vietnamese people. The nationalist leader Phan Châu Trinh accused him of selling out his country to the French and living in imperial luxury while the people were exploited by France. Nguyễn Ái Quốc (later known as Hồ Chí Minh) wrote a play about Khải Định called &quot;The Bamboo Dragon&quot; that ridiculed him as being all grand appearance and ceremony but a powerless puppet of the French government.

In 1918, the Emperor made a decree that Vietnam cease to use Chinese as official written language and was replaced by Romanized Vietnamese.

In 1922, the Emperor&#x27;s visit to France to see the Marseilles Colonial Exhibition was also ridiculed by nationalist leaders, who hated Vietnam&#x27;s status as a colonial subject of France and saw nothing in the exhibition worth celebrating.

Emperor Khải Định&#x27;s unpopularity reached its peak in 1923 when he authorized the French to raise taxes on the Vietnamese peasants, part of which was to pay for the building of his palatial tomb, and which caused a great deal of hardship. He also signed the orders of arrest against many nationalist leaders, such as Phan Bội Châu, forcing them into exile and having their followers who were captured beheaded.

==Marriages and sexuality==
When he was still Duke of Phụng Hóa, Emperor Khải Định married his first wife Trương Như Thị Tịnh in 1907. She left him in 1915 and became a nun, before he was enthroned. Upon ascending the throne, he married his second wife, Ân phi, Noble consort of the first rank Hồ Thị Chỉ (1902–1982) of An Truyền Hồ Đắc clan. She is a daughter of Hồ Đắc Trung, who became Annam&#x27;s Minister for Public Instruction. Emperor Khải Định had his first and only son with one of his concubines, Hoàng Thị Cúc (1890–1980). She gave birth to Nguyễn Phúc Vĩnh Thụy (later Emperor Bảo Đại) in 1913. After Khải Định&#x27;s ascension, she was given the title of Huệ tần, noble consort of the third rank, later elevated to the title Huệ phi, noble consort of the second rank.

Historical records and studies state that Emperor Khải Định only had homosexual desires. He rarely slept with his wives during his reign. He was close to his male guard, Nguyễn Đắc Vọng, and always slept with him.

== Death ==

Khải Định suffered poor health like his father and became a drug addict. He died of tuberculosis in the Imperial City of Huế, according to his concubine Ba Phi, who described him as &quot;&quot;not interested in sex&quot; and &quot;physically weak&quot;&quot;.

At this time he was promoted to major general, and he became the commander of the Royal Artillery in Malta until 1908. He was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1907. As part of the 1909 Birthday Honours, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. He retired from the army in June 1909. 

A few months after their son Harry died, Barron and Clara moved to Australia in August 1909, where Barron served as the Governor of Tasmania until 1913, and then as Governor of Western Australia from 1913 to 1917.

He retired to Weybridge Surrey, and in 1920, he was made colonel commandant of the Royal Artillery. He died on 27 March 1921. After he died, his wife continued to live in their Surrey Residence Swiss Cottage, however, there was a large mortgage on the property, and it was found that Barron had very little money as he had spent a large amount of his fortune while working as a governor, and he lost money on failed Russian investments. His wife Clara had to sell her furniture and possessions, and seek financial assistance from her friends and charities. After she sustained a spinal cord injury in 1930, and with her mortgage debt exceeding the value of her property she was unable to afford the daily assistance she required for her disability. She made failed applications to increase her pension from the war office, and get a pension for the governorships.

<text>Sir William Grey Ellison-Macartney, (7 June 1852 – 4 December 1924) was an Irish-born British politician, who also served as the Governor of the Australian states of Tasmania and Western Australia.

==Early life==

Born as William Grey Ellison in Dublin, Ireland, he was the son of John William Ellison, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Tyrone in the British House of Commons. His father changed the family surname to Ellison-Macartney in 1859, as a condition of an inheritance from a maternal uncle.

Ellison-Macartney was educated at Eton College and Exeter College, Oxford, taking an early interest in law and politics, and was called to the Bar in 1878. He was an ardent supporter of Irish Unionism, and became grand secretary of the Orange Institution in Ireland.

==Political career==

At the 1885 UK general election, Ellison-Macartney ran for the House of Commons, and was elected as Conservative member for the newly created constituency of South Antrim. In January 1886, he convened a meeting which led to the formation of the Irish Unionist Party, for which he served as whip.

In 1895, Ellison-Macartney was appointed as Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty, holding the post until 1890, when a cabinet reshuffle resulted in the appointment of Liberal Unionist H. O. Arnold-Forster. As a consolation, Ellison-Macartney was appointed to the Privy Council.

By 1900, Ellison-Macartney&#x27;s political fortunes had waned: his popularity in his constituency of South Antrim had dropped considerably due to his reluctance to dispense favour upon Antrim during his time as a junior minister, and he was criticised by the Belfast newspaper &quot;The News Letter&quot;.

Hoping to reassert his place in the loyalist hierarchy, Ellison-Macartney led a &quot;law-and-order&quot; campaign, targeted in particular at the violence and agrarian crime committed by William O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s United Irish League. He retired from politics in early February 1903, after being offered several government appointments.

==Government postings==

Ellison-Macartney was appointed Deputy-Master of the Royal Mint in January 1903, serving to 1913, and was High Sheriff of Antrim in 1908.

===Governor of Tasmania===

In December 1912, Ellison-Macartney was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), and appointed Governor of the Australian state of Tasmania. There was considerable concern over his appointment from Irish nationalists, who felt that Ellison-Macartney&#x27;s Unionist political background may cause offence to Tasmanians who supported Irish Home Rule.

In 1914, Ellison-Macartney presided over a constitutional dispute in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. With the Labor and Liberal parties close to deadlock in the parliament, he granted an early election to the Liberal Premier of Tasmania, Albert Solomon. The Liberals gained an extra seat needed to retain power, but lost one in a subsequent by-election. Ellison-Macartney declined Solomon&#x27;s request for another dissolution of parliament, and he called upon Labor&#x27;s John Earle to form government, on the condition that an election be called. With Earle and his ministry sworn in, neither side desired to hold an election so parliament remained in session, with Ellison-Macartney&#x27;s recommendations over-ridden by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

===Governor of Western Australia===

Like Sir Harry Barron before him, and Sir Francis Newdegate after him, Ellison-Macartney was transferred as governor from Tasmania to Western Australia. His term in Western Australia was not a happy one – his critical comments about Tasmanian politicians had made Western Australians wary of his attitude, and he had to deal with the state&#x27;s post-First World War economic depression and continued objection to his Unionist stance from those supportive of Irish Home Rule.

Ellison-Macartney returned to England after a three-year term. He died in Chelsea, London, aged 72.

==Freemasonry==

Ellison-Macartney was a freemason. He was initiated into the craft on 6 June 1872 in the Apollo University Lodge No. 357 the day before his twentieth birthday. In 1877, when he returned to Ireland, he became a member of the Lodge Cappagh No. 350 and then of the Concord Lodge No. 332. Finally, he became a founder of the new Border Lodge No. 482 on 25 April 1889. When he was appointed Governor of Tasmania, he agreed to become Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Tasmania and was installed on 19 February 1914. He was also made Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Western Australia during his term as the state&#x27;s governor. He was also a member of the Apprentice Boys of Derry Parent Club, being initiated on the 12th of August 1877.

==Family==

Ellison-Macartney was the son of John William Ellison and Elizabeth Phoebe Ellison, née Porter. On 5 August 1897, he married Ettie Myers Scott at Holcombe, Somerset, and they had three children: daughters Phoebe (b.1898) and Mildred (b.1900) and a younger son John; Phoebe died in 1918, aged 20, as a result of a riding accident while the family lived were living in Perth, Australia. Ettie was the sister of Robert Falcon Scott, the Antarctic explorer.

<text>Sir Francis Alexander Newdigate Newdegate, (31 December 1862 – 2 January 1936) was an English Conservative Party politician. After over twenty years in the House of Commons, he served as Governor of Tasmania from 1917 to 1920, and Governor of Western Australia from 1920 to 1924.

==Early life and family==
Born in 1862, he was the son of Lieutenant Colonel Francis William Newdigate and his first wife Charlotte Elizabeth Agnes Sophia Woodford, and grandson of Francis Parker Newdigate. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards in 1883. He married Elizabeth Sophia Lucia Bagot on 13 October 1888.

Newdegate inherited estates at Arbury Hall, near Nuneaton and at Harefield, near Uxbridge, on the death of his father in 1893, and uncle Sir Edward Newdegate in 1902. He assumed the additional surname &quot;Newdegate&quot;, differently spelt, under the terms of the will of a kinsman Charles Newdigate Newdegate, in September 1902. In 1911 he erected, at Arbury Hall, a monument to the memory of George Eliot, whose father had been employed on the Arbury estate.

==Career==
Newdegate was Member of Parliament for Nuneaton from 1892 to 1906, and for Tamworth from 1909 to 1917. He was on 14 February 1917 appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead, a mechanism for resigning from the House of Commons, on his appointment as Governor of Tasmania.

Newdegate was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1917 upon his appointment as Governor of Tasmania (1917 to 1920). He was appointed Governor of Western Australia in 1920 where he served until 1924. On retirement he was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1925. The Western Australian town of Newdegate is named after him.

==Later life and death==
Newdegate was appointed High Steward of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield in 1925. On his death in 1936 his estates passed to his daughter Lucia, who in 1919, had married John Maurice Fitzroy, father of the 3rd Viscount Daventry.

==Personal life==
He was a friend of Sir Alexander Russell Downer, who built a large home and gardens in the Adelaide Hills in South Australia and named it Arbury Park after the Newdigate family home.

<text>Sir William Robert Campion, (3 July 1870 – 2 January 1951) was a British soldier, politician, and the 21st Governor of Western Australia from 1924 to 1931.

==Early years==
Born in London, England on 3 July 1870, Campion was educated at Eton College and the University of Oxford, and was the Conservative MP for Lewes from 1910 to 1924.

==Military career==
Campion was commissioned into the part-time 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment, later 4th Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment (of which his father was Honorary Colonel) in 1888. On the outbreak of World War I he was the battalion&#x27;s senior Captain with the rank of honorary Major. He became Lieutenant-Colonel of the 1st Line battalion (1/4th Royal Sussex) and commanded it in the Gallipoli campaign. At its first action, at Suvla Bay on 9 August 1915, the &quot;Official History&quot; records that the orders given to Lt-Col Campion &#x27;were vague in the extreme. The colonel was verbally told &quot;to restore the line&quot;. No one knew where it was, but he was told that &quot;if he went in that direction (pointing to a column of smoke from the burning scrub) he ought to find the 2/4th Queen&#x27;s&quot;.&#x27; The 1/4th Sussex advanced steadily in extended order, found the Queen&#x27;s who had been driven off the crest, and consolidated a line, having suffered heavy casualties. Campion was evacuated to England sick on 5 October.

Campion later commanded 15th (Reserve) Bn Royal Fusiliers in the UK and then went to France to command 6th (Service) Bn Bedfordshire Regiment and 17th (Garrison) Bn Royal Sussex on the Western Front before returning to the 4th Royal Sussex after its arrival from the Mediterranean in 1918. He led the battalion through the final Allied Hundred Days Offensive. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1918 and continued to command the battalion in the postwar Territorial Army.

==Governor of Western Australia==

In June 1924 Campion was appointed Governor of Western Australia. From October 1924 to June 1931 Campion worked with Labor and Nationalist premiers alike in harmony during a period without major political crises. He presided with dignity over the state&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 1929.

==Later years==
Campion returned to England in 1931 and retired to his country house in Sussex, but spoke frequently in favour of organized migration to Australia. He was a member of the Empire Settlement Committee in 1935. He accepted appointment as chairman of two Australian based gold-mining companies. He visited Australia in 1935–36 to inspect properties and again in 1939.
Campion died in Sussex on 2 January 1951, survived by his wife and four children: William Simon Campion (1895–1976) – married, with issue; Dorothy Mary Campion, Countess of Carnegie (1897–1967), married to John Carnegie, 12th Earl of Northesk with issue; Wilfred Edward Campion (1899–1972) – married with issue (divorced); Barbara Campion Willis Fleming (1903–1999) – married with issue (divorced).

<text>Comic and manga adaptations of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series of video games, especially in Japan, have been published under license from Nintendo.

== Wanpaku Comics ==
In September 1986, Wanpaku Comics published a manga book in Japan titled &quot;The Hyrule Fantasy&quot;. It was released as a companion to the first &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game. The story follows the game&#x27;s plot but adds additional features including new characters, such as a companion parrot for Link.

==Valiant Comics series==
Valiant Comics published a comic series simply titled &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; in 1990, which lasted only five issues, with a sixth issue published as part of the Nintendo Comics System imprint. The series was more closely patterned after &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; TV series airing at the time, which in turn was loosely based on the first two NES games. The series depicted Link as he appears in the first game, with red hair and brown eyes. It also introduced new characters, including Captain Krin, Captain of the Guard of North Castle and Link&#x27;s parents, Arn and Medilia.

==Titles by Akira Himekawa==
The manga team of Akira Himekawa has been producing manga adaptations of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video games in Japan beginning with their manga adaptation of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, which was first published in 1999 by Shogakukan.

Currently, Himekawa has produced manga adaptations of more than eight &quot;Zelda&quot; games (including both &quot;Oracle&quot; games), with the latest being &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; manga. Viz Media is currently publishing English translations of Himekawa&#x27;s &quot;Zelda&quot; manga in North America, beginning with their adaptation of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, which was published in October 2008.

Since July 2009, a French translation is being published by Soleil Manga. The first manga available was &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; followed by &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; 1 &amp; 2. Himekawa&#x27;s other &quot;Zelda&quot; manga was later translated into French in 2010.

Himekawa&#x27;s manga, which was released in Japan in and between 1998 and 2009, was also localised in the Federal Republic of Germany by Tokyopop in and between 2009 and 2011. The first ten tankōbon volumes sold more than 3 million copies worldwide.

After a seven-year hiatus, Akira Himekawa began the work on a new &quot;Zelda&quot; manga. Later revealed to be an adaptation of &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, the manga series ran from February 2016 to January 2022.

===&quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;===

* (Volume 1, English edition)
* (Volume 2, English edition)

There are two story arcs in this manga: Child arc (こども編 &quot;Kodomo-hen&quot;) and Adult arc (おとな編 &quot;Otona-hen&quot;). The protagonist is Link (リンク &quot;Rinku/Link&quot;) and during the course of the book he is on a quest to stop Ganondorf (ガノンドロフ &quot;Ganondorofu&quot;) from taking over Hyrule (ハイラル &quot;Hairaru&quot;). Princess Zelda (ゼルダ姫 &quot;Zeruda/Zelda-hime&quot;) helps him in his quest. The book more-or-less follows the same plot as the game, but there are a few differences in plot from the game. There are six chapters in the first book, and nine in the second. Some of the added information in the manga is added to explain certain points; for example, in the manga pierced ears is a traditional rite of Sheikah passage, although this is not included in the game. 
The series was published in English by Viz Media in North America as Volumes 1 and 2, respectively.

* (English edition)
Originally released in Japan in early 2009, it is based on the DS adventure, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Wind Waker&quot;. Though the manga retains the game&#x27;s characters and overall plot, many of the character&#x27;s personalities and some events in the game were changed, sparking negative reactions from several fans of the original game. Despite this, however, it continues to receive positive reviews. Viz released an English adaptation of this manga as Volume 10 of their Zelda series on September 7, 2010.

===&quot;Skyward Sword&quot;===
The &quot;Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot; is a manga loosely based on the game of the same name drawn by Akira Himekawa. The 32 pages of the manga were included in the artbook Hyrule Historia. The manga serves as a prequel to the story of &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;.

Though Link starts out a hapless, bumbling kid, caught up in something bigger than he ever imagined, he displays great courage and ultimately proves himself a determined and competent adventurer. This telling portrays Link&#x27;s parents as Knights of Hyrule, lost to the Dark World.

===Novels and Yonkoma manga===
Five novels (published by Futabasha) and several Yonkoma manga (published by Shiseisha) based on aspects of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series have also been published.

===Penny Arcade Presents &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot;===
A short comic published weekly in five parts on Nintendo&#x27;s official &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot; website, written and illustrated by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik under their &quot;Penny Arcade Presents&quot; series. The story is narrated by Gaepora, Zelda&#x27;s father.

<doc id="1066409" wikidata="Q2479591" url="?curid=1066409" title="Ordnance QF 25-pounder">
<text>The Ordnance QF 25-pounder, or more simply 25-pounder or 25-pdr, with a calibre of 3.45 inches (87.6 mm), was a piece of field artillery used by British and Commonwealth forces in the Second World War. Durable, easy to operate and versatile, it was the most produced and used British field gun and gun-howitzer during the war.

It was introduced into service just before the War started and combined both high-angle and direct-fire abilities, a relatively high rate of fire, and a reasonably lethal shell, with a highly mobile piece. Initial production was slow, but by 1945, over 12,000 had been manufactured. It remained the British Army&#x27;s primary artillery field piece well into the 1960s, with smaller numbers used in training units until the 1980s. Many Commonwealth countries used theirs in active or reserve service until about the 1970s, and ammunition for the weapon is currently (2020s) being produced by Pakistan Ordnance Factories.

==Design==
The design was the result of extended studies looking to replace the 18-pounder ( bore) field gun and the 4.5-inch howitzer (114.3 mm bore), which had been the main field artillery piece during the First World War. The basic idea was to build one weapon with the high velocity of the 18-pounder and the variable propelling charges of the howitzer, firing a shell about halfway between the two in size, around of about .

Development during the inter-war period was severely hampered by a lack of money and it was eventually decided to build a new design from existing 18-pounders by converting barrels but designing a new barrel and carriage for production when funds were available. The result was a weapon firing a shell weighing . It was mounted on late model 18-pounder carriages. One of these used a circular firing platform and this was adopted for the new guns. The firing platform was attached to the gun and when lowered the gun was pulled onto it. This platform transferred most of the recoil forces to the ground, instead of using the spade at the end of the trail, making the gun very stable when firing. It also provided a smooth flat surface for the carriage to rotate on using the road wheels, this enabled the gunners to traverse the carriage quickly in any direction.


Unlike the 18-pounder, the 25-pounder used howitzer-type variable-charge ammunition. The 25-pounder was separate-loading; the shell was loaded and rammed, then the cartridge in its brass case was loaded and the breech closed. In British terminology, the 25-pounder was called &quot;quick firing&quot; (QF), originally because the cartridge case provided rapid loading compared with bag charges, and was automatically released when the breech was opened.

The use of separate shell and cartridge allowed the charge to be changed for different ranges. For the Mk 1 Ordnance on an 18-pounder carriage there were three &quot;charges&quot;, charges one, two and three, all of which could be used in the common cartridge design. The Mk 2 Ordnance on Mk 1 carriage added a &quot;super&quot; charge in a different cartridge. In 1943 a separately bagged &quot;increment&quot; charge was added; used with the Super it provided higher velocity for anti-tank use. The introduction of the increment to super was only possible following the addition of the muzzle-brake in the previous year. Subsequently, another type of increment was introduced to be added to charges one and two to provide additional combinations for use in high angle fire. However, this fire required a dial sight adaptor, removal of the platform and some excavation of the ground.

In common with all British guns of the period the indirect fire sight was &quot;calibrating&quot;. This meant that the range, not elevation angle, was set on the sight. The sight compensated for the difference in the gun&#x27;s muzzle velocities from standard. The gun was also fitted with a direct-fire telescope for use with armour-piercing shot. It also used &quot;one-man laying&quot; in accordance with normal British practice.

An important part of the gun was the ammunition trailer (&quot;trailer, artillery, No 27&quot;). The gun was hooked to it and the trailer hooked to the tractor for towing. The gun did not need a limber and could be hooked directly to a tractor. The trailer provided the brakes as only a hand-brake was fitted to the gun carriage. The trailer carried ammunition; thirty-two rounds in trays (two rounds per tray) in the trailer protected by two doors. Ammunition was also carried in the gun tractor with the detachment and various gun stores. Some stores, such as sights, were carried cased on the gun. Each section (two guns) had a third tractor that carried ammunition and towed two ammunition trailers.

The normal gun detachment comprised six men:
*No 1 – detachment commander (a sergeant)
*No 2 – operated the breech and rammed the shell
*No 3 – layer
*No 4 – loader
*No 5 – ammunition
*No 6 – ammunition, normally the &quot;coverer&quot; – second in command and responsible for ammunition preparation and operating the fuze indicator

The official &quot;reduced detachment&quot; was four men.

==Production==
Many different companies manufactured the guns and component parts in the UK. Vickers-Armstrongs in Scotswood, Baker Perkins in Peterborough and Weirs in Glasgow were some of the most significant. The various Royal Ordnance factories produced most of the ordnance components. In Canada, Sorel Industries built complete guns and provided the ordnance for fitting to the Sexton. Australia also built complete guns, choosing to weld the carriages rather than rivet, as was the practice in the UK and Canada. In all, over 13,000 were made worldwide.

==Ammunition==

The 25-pounder fired &quot;separate&quot; or two-part ammunition – the projectile was loaded separately from the propelling charge in its (usually brass) cartridge case with its integral primer. Typically for a quick-firing gun, the cartridge case provided obturation.

There were two types of cartridge. The normal cartridge contained three cloth charge bags (coloured red, white and blue). White or blue bags would be removed from the cartridge to give &quot;charge one&quot; or &quot;charge two&quot;, leaving all three bags in the cartridge case gave &quot;charge three&quot;. The cartridge case was closed at the top with a leatherboard cup. The second type of cartridge was &quot;super&quot;, which provided one charge only. The cup could not be removed from the cartridge case. In 1943, an incremental charge of of cordite (&quot;super-plus&quot;) was introduced to raise the muzzle velocity when firing armour-piercing shot with charge super; this required a muzzle brake to be fitted. Adoption of &quot;upper-register&quot; (high-angle) fire needed more charges to improve the range overlap. This led to the development of the &quot;intermediate increment&quot; of 4oz cordite, which was introduced in 1944. The bags were striped red and white to indicate that they should only be used with charges one and two. When one bag was used with charge 1 it provided charge 1/2. When one was added to charge 2 it provided charge 2 1/3, and two bags, charge 2 2/3. This allowed a range of seven different charges instead of four.
There were many marks of cartridge, mostly differentiated by propellant type. Double-base propellant (nitrocellulose/nitroglycerine) was the UK standard but one mark used US single-base (nitrocellulose only). However, triple-base nitrocellulose/nitroglycerine/picrite was used throughout the war and eventually replaced all others.

The 25-pounder&#x27;s main ammunition was the high-explosive (HE) streamlined shell with a 5/10 CRH ogive and boat tail. The explosive filling was of TNT or Amatol. It was also provided with base ejection smoke (white and coloured), star shells, and chemical shells. Incendiary and coloured flare shells were developed but not introduced into service, and smoke shells were sometimes reloaded with propaganda leaflets or metal foil &quot;window&quot;. The UK did not develop a WP smoke shell for the 25-pounder.

For anti-tank use, the 25-pounder was also supplied with a limited amount of solid armour-piercing (AP) shot, later replaced with a more potent version with a ballistic cap (APBC). The AP shot was fired with maximum charge, charge No. 3, super, or super with Super increment depending on the ordnance mark, as muzzle velocity was critical in direct fire for penetration and a flat trajectory.

A shaped charge anti-tank shell was under development in Canada, but the introduction of the three-inch (76.2 mm) calibre QF 17-pounder, an anti-tank gun, in 1944 ended its development. After the Second World War, the UK replaced AP shot with a HESH shell. Coloured marker shells (dye and PETN) were also developed but not introduced.

The standard fuze was No 117 direct action (DA). No 119 (DA and graze) was also used. Combustion or mechanical time fuzes were used with base ejection shells and mechanical time with graze were used with HE. Proximity fuzes were used from the end of 1944 and subsequently replaced by CVT fuzes.
==British service==
The 25-pounder was the main field artillery weapon used by British Commonwealth and colonial infantry and armoured divisions of all types during the Second World War. It was also used by the RAF Regiment in North Africa. Throughout the war, each British-pattern infantry division was established with 72 25-pounders, in three field artillery regiments. Armoured divisions were eventually standardised with two field artillery regiments, one of which was self-propelled (see below). Before mid-1940, each regiment had two batteries of twelve guns; after that date, regiments changed to batteries of eight guns and added a third battery, a process that was not completed until early 1943. In the late 1950s, the British Army reverted to batteries of six guns. Field artillery regiments had two batteries of 25-pounders and one of 5.5 inch guns.

The early 18- and 25-pounders had been towed in the field by the Morris CDSW or the earlier Vickers Light Dragon Mk. III, a tracked vehicle derived from the Vickers DA50 which was also the basis of the Bren or Universal Carrier. Throughout most of the Second World War, the 25-pounder was normally towed, with its limber, behind a 4×4 field artillery tractor called a &quot;quad&quot;. These were manufactured by Morris, Guy and Karrier in England, and, in greater numbers, as the Canadian Military Pattern field artillery tractor by Ford and Chevrolet in Canada. In the 1950s, the British Army replaced the various &quot;quads&quot; with a new Bedford three-ton gun tower fitted with a specialist body.

In 1941, the British Army improvised a self-propelled 25-pounder named the Bishop, on the chassis of the Valentine tank. This mount proved unsatisfactory and the Bishops were replaced in 1942 by the American M7 Priest, which did not use the 25-Pounder complicating the supply of ammunition in the field. The Priests were replaced in 1944 by the Sexton, which used the 25-Pounder. The Sexton was designed, and mostly manufactured, in Canada (some two thirds of the ordnance and mountings were imported from the UK due to limited Canadian production capacity) and was the result of mounting a 25-pounder on a Ram or Grizzly tank chassis.
By Second World War standards, the 25-pounder had a smaller calibre and lower shell-weight than many other field-artillery weapons, although it had longer range than most. (Most forces had entered the war with even smaller designs but had quickly moved to and larger weapons.) It was designed for the British practice of suppressive (neutralising) fire, not destructive fire that had proved illusory in the early years of the First World War. Nevertheless, the 25-pounder was considered by all to be one of the best artillery pieces in use. The effects caused by the gun (and the speed at which the British artillery control system could respond) in the North-West Europe Campaign of 1944–1945 made many German soldiers believe that the British had secretly deployed an automatic 25-pounder.

In UK service, during the 1960s, most 25-pounders were replaced by the 105mm Abbot SPG, some by the Oto Melara 105mm pack howitzer, and the remainder by the 105mm L118 light gun. The last British military unit to fire the 25-pounder in its field role (as opposed to ceremonial use) was the Gun Troop of the Honourable Artillery Company on Salisbury Plain in 1992.

==Service with other nations==

In addition to Commonwealth and colonial forces, other Second World War users included the free forces of France, Greece, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. The first shot fired by US artillery against the German army in the war was from a 25-pounder of the 34th Infantry Division.

After the Second World War, 25-pounders remained in service with many Commonwealth armies into the 1960s. They were used in Korea by British, Canadian and New Zealand regiments and in Malaya by British and Australian batteries. They also featured in wars on the Indian sub-continent and in the service of Israeli and other Middle Eastern armies.

===Australia===
Australia used the 25-pounder extensively, including in WW2, Korea and the Malayan Emergency. They were kept in use by reserve units until the 1970s. Individual guns are now often seen as fixed memorials in memorial parks and Returned Servicemen&#x27;s clubs. 1527 complete guns were manufactured in Australia from May 1941. Domestic production allowed the 25-pounder to be mounted in Australian-produced vehicles, such as the Thunderbolt tank and the post-war self-propelled gun, the Yeramba. This led to Australian development of a short-barrelled lighter version which was more suitable for off-road deployment, as required, e.g., in the New Guinea campaign. 213 of the shortened guns were produced, starting in 1943. These were declared obsolescent and placed in storage in 1946.

===South Africa===
The gun was called G1 by the South African Defence Force. It was extensively used in the early stages of the South African Border War, including Operation Savannah. The G1 is still used in the ceremonial role.

===Rhodesia===
The Rhodesian Army used the Ordnance QF 25 pounder Mark III (nicknamed &quot;88mm gun/howitzer&quot;) during the Bush War and 16 to 24 guns were fielded by the 1st Field Regiment, Rhodesian Artillery, but by this stage their rounds could not penetrate enemy bunkers.

===Sri Lanka===
The Ordnance QF 25 pounder Mark III was added to the Sri Lankan Army inventory in 1985 supplied by Pakistan at the early stages of the Sri Lankan civil war and was fielded by the 6th Field Regiment, Sri Lanka Artillery which was raised in September 1985. It was replaced by 122 mm Type 60 howitzers, but still remains in service with the Ceremonial Saluting Battery of the 6th Field Regiment.

===Ireland===
In 1949, 48 ex-British-Army Mark III 25-pounders were acquired by the Irish Defence Forces and were in service with the reserves until 2009, having been replaced in the army by the 105 mm Light Gun in 1981. The Irish Army maintains a six-gun ceremonial 25-pounder battery for use on state occasions.

===India===
The Indian Army used 25-pounders against Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and against China during the Sino-Indian War in 1962.

===Jordan===
The Jordanian Arab Legion deployed eight 25-pounder field guns during the fighting in 1948. Later, the Royal Jordanian Army deployed several batteries of 25-pounders during the Six-Day War.
===Lebanon===
The Lebanese Army aligned twenty-one QF Mk III 25-Pounders on its inventory in 1975, with most of them being subsequently seized by the Tigers Militia and the Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF) militia in February 1976 and passed on to its successor, the Lebanese Forces in 1980, who employed them during the Lebanese Civil War.

===Luxembourg===

During World War II, the Free Luxembourgish Forces fielded four 25-pounders, which were named after the four daughters of Grand Duchess Charlotte: Princesses Elisabeth, Marie Adelaide, Marie Gabriele and Alix. Post-war, the Luxembourg Army used a number of 25-pounder guns. In 1955–1957, they were rebarrelled to and fitted with new sights. The First Artillery Battalion with 18 guns was placed at the disposal of the 8th Infantry Division of the United States from 1963 to 1967. The last shots fired by the First Luxembourg Artillery Battalion left the tubes on May 31, 1967. Some are maintained for gun salutes.

===Greece and Cyprus===
The 25-pounder first entered service with Greek forces in North Africa during WWII. Three (numbered I, II and III) field artillery regiments of 24 pieces each were raised as part of the Greek infantry brigades raised by the Greek government in exile. Their only significant actions were at El Alamein in 1942 and Rimini in 1944. After the end of the Second World War, the 25-pounder served as part of the Greek Army during the Greek Civil War. A total of 125 25-pounder guns were used by the Greek artillery during the civil war of 1946–1949, in various organizational schemes. After the civil war, they were organized into seven independent regiments of 18 guns each. Following Greece&#x27;s entry into NATO in 1952 and the standardization on American calibres in 1953, the 25-pounders, unlike other models, were not retired but reorganised into 13 battalions of eight guns each, as part of divisional artillery formations. In 1957, the influx of American artillery pieces permitted an increase from 8 to 12 guns per battalion. In 1964, 54 25-pdr guns were handed over from Greece to Cyprus, where they entered service with the Cyprus National Guard organized into four battalions of 12 guns each ( numbered 181, 182, 183 and 185) and one independent battery of six guns (184). They saw action during the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974. The 25-pounders remained in Greek Army service until 1992, when they were retired as part of the CFE agreement. The guns of the Cyprus National Guard remain in storage.

===New Zealand===

During World War II New Zealand Gunners of 2nd New Zealand division made extensive use of the 25-pr in Greece, North Africa and Italy. The 16th Field Regiment of the Royal New Zealand Artillery, equipped with 25-pounders, was formed to join the United Nations force in the Korean War. The 25-pdr was replaced in first-line units by the OTO Melara L5 gun. The guns were withdrawn from operational service with Territorial Force Artillery by 1977. Today, 25-pounders remain in service as ceremonial guns.

=== Nigeria ===
The Nigerian Federal Army used 25-pdr guns during the Biafran War. The Nigerian Army still fielded them in 2002.

===Iraqi Kurdistan===
A 2015 news report shows at least one 25-pounder in service with Kurdish Peshmerga forces, employed against ISIS positions in Mosul, Iraq.

===South Vietnam===
In 1953, the Vietnamese National Army was equipped with 122 QF 25 pounders.

==Variants==
===Mark I===

Known officially as the &quot;Ordnance, Quick Firing 25-pounder Mark I on Carriage 18-pr Mark IV&quot;, or &quot;Ordnance, Quick Firing 25-pounder Mark I on Carriage 18-pr Mark V&quot; and commonly called the &quot;18/25-pounder&quot;. The Mark I was a 25-pounder barrel and breech in the modified jacket of an 18-pounder gun, as a &#x27;loose liner&#x27;. The jacket provided the interface to the 18-pounder carriage. The earliest versions retained 18-pounder type elevation sights but later ones had Probert pattern calibrating sights on the right side of the saddle. The Mark IV P, carriage was a box trail, Mark V P, was a split trail. These conversions of the 18-pounder first entered British service in 1937. A few were lost in the Norwegian campaign and 704 in France, leaving about the same number in UK&#x27;s global stocks. They served in North Africa (until about late 1941) and India. This mark of 25-pounder was limited to charge 3 due to its 18-pounder carriage.

===Mark II===
The Mark II, fitted to the Mark I carriage was the standard gun during the war. They were built in Australia and Canada but mostly in UK. Deliveries (from UK production) started at the beginning of 1940 and first entered service with a Canadian regiment stationed in UK during May 1940. No Ordnance 25-pr Mk 2 on Carriage 25-pr Mark 1 were lost in France. This gun fired all charges, 1 – 3 and Super.
In 1942, a muzzle brake was fitted to the gun to eliminate the instability caused when firing the 20 lb AP shell with Charge Super at direct fire low elevation angles. To preserve the gun&#x27;s balance on the trunnions, a counterbalance weight was also fitted, just in front of the breech ring. The designation of the modified gun was not changed. Eventually, all guns serving in Europe were so converted.

The Mark II ordnance had six main marks of the barrel:

;Mark I barrel
:Original variant with a loose liner.

;Mark II barrel

:The standard design, also made in Canada as C Mk II barrel.

;Mark II/I
:In 1946, a programme was introduced to modify the gun&#x27;s breech ring by morticing the rear corners. A corresponding modification was made to the rear corners of the breech block. This was to reduce the instances of cracking the ring.

;Mark III barrel
:The Mark III barrel was a Mark II with a modified receiver to prevent the rounds from slipping back out when loading at high angles. It was introduced in January 1944.

;Mark III/I
:This was a Mk III gun with the same modification to the ring and block as for the Mk II/I.

;Mark IV barrel
:The Mark IV was identical to the Mark III/I, and featured the modified ring and a paired block from new.

;Mark VI barrel
:The final alteration of the breech ring made in 1964.

===Short, Mark I===


The 25-pounder Short Mark I, or Baby 25-pr, was an Australian pack gun version of the 25-pounder, first produced in 1943. This was a shortened version of the standard 25-pounder, mounted on the &quot;Carriage 25-pr Light, Mark 1&quot;. Weighing , it was around lighter than the 25-pounder Mark II.

The &quot;Baby&quot; was intended for jungle warfare and was only used by Australian units in the South West Pacific theatre. The gun could be towed by a jeep or broken down into 13 sections and transported by air. During the New Guinea campaign the gun was manhandled up steep jungle tracks where trucks could not operate.

===Carriages===
;Mark I
The Mark I carriage was the first real 25-pounder carriage. Later in the war, some guns had a double spacer-separated shield to improve protection. It had Probert-pattern calibrating sights, but with the range indicator wrapped into the distinctive cone that rotated against a fixed reader arm.

;Jury axle
In Burma, artificers of 129 (Lowland) Jungle Field Regiment developed a local modification to use a Jeep axle and wheels to produce a 20-inch narrower axle track for easier movement along restricted jungle paths, along with some minor modifications to the gun trail; it was called the Jury Axle. Tests in action showed the gun was stable, it was first reported to GHQ India in October 1943. It appears that it was also used without its shield, and the gun could be disassembled for transport in pieces by Jeep. 139th (4th London) Jungle Field Regiment used the modified guns and developed procedures for dismantling them for stowage aboard Douglas C-47 Dakota transport aircraft.

;Mark II
The Mark II carriage was basically the War Office-approved formalisation of the Jury Axle version of the 25-pounder. Changes included a narrower shield, a new narrower track platform (No 22), and modified Jeep wheels.

;Mark III
The Mark III carriage, also narrow, was a further development of the Mark II carriage to provide joints that enabled the trail to be cranked for &quot;upper register&quot; (high-angle) fire to avoid the need to dig a trail pit, and used with the cranked &quot;dial sight adaptor&quot; previously adopted for high-angle fire. It entered service soon after the war. High-angle fire had been introduced in Italy and used increments to charges 2 and 3 to give the 25-pounder seven charges.

;Mark IV
The British did further work on the Australian-designed short 25-pounder, enabling it to fire charge Super. One or two prototypes were produced and the carriage was officially designated the Mark IV, but never went into production.

==Self-propelled 25-pounders==
===Bishop===
The Bishop was a British self-propelled 25-pounder using the Valentine tank chassis, soon replaced by better designs.

===Sexton===
The Sexton was a Canadian self-propelled 25-pounder using the Ram or Grizzly tank chassis.

===Yeramba===
The Yeramba was an Australian self-propelled 25-pounder using the M3 Lee tank chassis.

<doc id="1066436" wikidata="Q3900064" url="?curid=1066436" title="Perpetual Emigration Fund">
<text>The Perpetual Emigration Fund (PEF) was a 19th-century program of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) that provided economic assistance to emigrants seeking to join the main church community in the Salt Lake Valley and surrounding regions. The fund concept was launched in 1849, two years after the first Mormon pioneers arrived in Utah. In September 1850, based on proposals made in the church&#x27;s general conference, the provisional government of the State of Deseret formally incorporated the fund as the Perpetual Emigrating Company. Ultimately the fund and corporation operated under the name Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company (PEFC).

== Fund practices and operations ==

The PEF used a combination of church resources and private contributions to provide initial aid for impoverished church members as they moved west. The ordinance incorporating the PEF set aside Antelope Island and Stansbury Island, two islands in the Great Salt Lake, for the company&#x27;s exclusive use. On Antelope Island, the church operated a ranch with tithing herds of cattle and sheep in order to generate revenue for the fund.

The aid provided to emigrants was structured in the form of loans, with the design of constantly replenishing the fund by having these members repay the assistance once established in their new homes. Recipients would sign a promissory note to reimburse the company for their costs, and were often permitted to satisfy their obligation with commodities or labor in addition to cash. Over the life of the program, nearly 30,000 individuals received assistance, primarily with travel arrangements and outfitting.

As the funding was never able to support all who might need assistance, priority was given to longstanding church members and those with useful skills needed in the Western frontier environment. While proselyting efforts in Europe led to increasing numbers of new converts drawing on the PEF, the company only sometimes paid for a recipient&#x27;s ship passage; more often it assisted with overland travel costs for those already residing or newly arrived in the US. In the Utah economy, availability of cash remained a limiting factor. For members seeking to emigrate from Great Britain, church mission president Samuel W. Richards instituted a plan that the emigrants would pool their existing if meager resources into the PEF, then pay back the full amount of assistance regardless of whether they had also donated. As not all could be accommodated at once, this would help the earlier group of emigrants support those coming after. The earlier growth of the LDS Church in Britain meant that a higher percentage of British members received PEF assistance than emigrants coming from elsewhere (primarily Scandinavia). Those who had relatives already in Utah were more likely to receive support, and donors to the PEF could also designate recipients with their contribution.

== Innovations and evolution of emigrant travel ==
Efforts to ease the journey for the emigrants and make the program less expensive for them and the church continued over the PEF&#x27;s lifetime. At first, church leadership believed that members in Europe should be advised to wait until a potential canal was built through Panama or Nicaragua, so they could land in California and avoid the difficult overland journey from the Atlantic seaboard. However, as the canal projects failed to move forward, this approach to the voyage never developed.
Beginning in 1856, instead of supplying covered wagons with oxen to cross the plains from the western railroad terminus, church leaders organized many emigrants into handcart companies provided with two-wheeled carts that they would pull themselves, like a very large wheelbarrow. The new approach allowed the PEF to support nearly twice as many individuals as it had in 1855. The increased numbers were also problematic, however, as procuring the additional ships and difficulties in building sufficient handcarts caused travel delays. This led to two companies starting the handcart stage of their journey too late in the year, with significant loss of life when they were caught in an October blizzard before reaching Salt Lake City.
A few more handcart companies followed in subsequent years, the last in 1860 as the final emigration stage reverted to wagon trains. Instead, church President Brigham Young began promoting the idea of sending teams from Utah with cattle and wagons to meet the emigrants across the plains. By drawing on available resources, it would reduce the challenges and costs of outfitting each group separately, and the wagons could carry the necessary gear and supplies while the majority of travelers walked alongside. Young also suggested that with Utah still having few merchants, existing residents might arrange to have team leaders obtain goods for them back East and bring those items back more cheaply than they could otherwise be obtained. These teams became known as &quot;down-and-back companies&quot; based on their journey &quot;down&quot; to the Missouri River gathering point and back to Utah, and contributed significantly in facilitating the larger emigrant groups organized through the PEF over the course of the decade.

For those coming from Europe, the place of departure was typically Liverpool, except for a handful of parties from the continent who sailed to America directly from Hamburg. Church agents engaged sailing vessels almost exclusively for the transatlantic crossing until 1868, to keep fares as low as possible (whether paid by the individual or the PEF). By this time, the majority of overseas immigration to the US had already shifted to steamships, and the church followed suit in developing a relationship with the Guion Line to carry its emigrants as steerage passengers. The shift to a quicker, more reliable crossing by steam was in part connected to a separate concession from the Union Pacific Railroad, which offered free railroad fare from Omaha for able-bodied men who could help build the roadbed for its portion of the first transcontinental railroad. The railroad&#x27;s completion the next year also eliminated the wagon stage of the journey.

== Final years and legacy ==
Since repayment depended on the recipients building up sufficient means after emigration, the PEFC often did not collect on the notes it held. President Young and others occasionally issued harsh criticism of those who failed to repay, or at least return the gear with which they had been outfitted. However, church bishops who oversaw PEF repayments were directed that collection should be &quot;consistent with the ability of the debtors to pay, without distressing the poor, the widow, the aged, or the infirm.&quot; As the company continued to balance these competing considerations, by 1880 the amounts owed to the PEF had grown to $1.6 million. As part of the jubilee celebration of the 50th year since the church&#x27;s organization, its soon-to-be President John Taylor announced a goal to forgive half the amount. With instructions to identify those too poor to pay, church bishops managed in the end to forgive $337,000 of obligations to the PEF during the year.
As the US federal government stepped up its campaign to suppress the practice of polygamy by the church, the PEFC came under collateral attack. Utah territorial Governor Eli H. Murray complained to the Secretary of the Interior in 1883 that the PEFC&#x27;s incorporation meant the legislature had effectively handed over to the church the entire system of immigration into the territory. Subsequent sessions of Congress repeatedly considered bills to disincorporate both the LDS Church and the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company on the grounds that it fostered the practice. The disincorporation finally took effect when the Edmunds-Tucker Act was enacted in 1887.

The church was ultimately allowed to continue operating and its assets were released in 1893 after a manifesto officially discontinuing the practice of polygamy, but the PEFC was never reinstated. At the conclusion of court proceedings to dissolve it, the receiver took possession of $417,968.50 in net assets, nearly all uncollectable promissory notes of no value. In 2001 the LDS Church established a new program inspired by the Perpetual Emigration Fund, this time designed to help members in developing countries obtain vocational and technical training, and named it the Perpetual Education Fund.

<doc id="1066440" wikidata="Q7413964" url="?curid=1066440" title="San Francisco Canyon Company">
<text>San Francisco Canyon Company was a software development company that was contracted by Apple Computer in 1992 to port the QuickTime technology to Microsoft Windows. They made their first release of &quot;QuickTime for Windows&quot; in November 1992.

In July 1993, Intel contracted the San Francisco Canyon Company to improve the performance of Microsoft&#x27;s Video for Windows technology on Intel processors. By the end of 1993, Intel and Microsoft had combined their efforts to improve Video for Windows by creating a joint technology called Display Control Interface that was included in version 1.1d of Video for Windows (released in late 1994). As with WinG, the main problem this technology fixed was that Windows 3.x video drivers implemented all GDI routines including for drawing bitmaps in the video drivers themselves, and performance of these routines varied across drivers.

The lawsuit &quot;Apple Computer v. San Francisco Canyon Co.&quot;, filed on December 6, 1994, alleged that the San Francisco Canyon Company used some of the code developed under contract to Apple in their additions to Video for Windows. Apple expanded the lawsuit to include Intel and Microsoft on February 10, 1995, alleging that Microsoft and Intel knowingly used the software company to aid them in stealing several thousand lines of Apple&#x27;s QuickTime code in their effort to improve the performance of Video for Windows.

On March 3, 1995, a Federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that prohibited Microsoft from distributing its current version of Video for Windows. Microsoft subsequently released version 1.1e of Video for Windows, which removed all of the code contributed by the San Francisco Canyon Company, stating in the release notes &quot;does not include the low-level driver code that was licensed from Intel Corporation&quot;.

Later testimony in the &quot;United States v. Microsoft Corp.&quot; case revealed that, at the time, Apple was threatening Microsoft with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit over the allegedly stolen code, and in return Bill Gates was threatening the cancellation of Microsoft Office for Mac. In August 1997, Apple and Microsoft announced a settlement deal. Apple would drop all current lawsuits, including all lingering issues from the &quot;Look &amp; Feel&quot; lawsuit and the &quot;QuickTime source code&quot; lawsuit, and agree to make Internet Explorer for Mac the default browser on the Macintosh unless the user explicitly chose the bundled Netscape browser. In return, Microsoft agreed to continue developing Office, Internet Explorer, and various developer tools and software for the Mac for the next 5 years, and purchase $150 million of non-voting Apple stock. The companies also agreed to mutual collaboration on Java technologies, and to cross-license all existing patents, and patents obtained during the five-year deal, with one another.

<text>Christopher Eyles Guy Bowen (born 17 January 1973) is an Australian politician who has been Minister for Climate Change and Energy in the Albanese government since June 2022. He is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and was first elected to parliament at the 2004 federal election. He held ministerial office in the Rudd and Gillard governments from 2007 to 2013.

Bowen served on the Fairfield City Council from 1995 to 2004, including a term as mayor. He was elected to the House of Representatives in the 2004 election, winning the seat of Prospect; he later transferred to the seat of McMahon at the 2010 federal election, after his former seat was abolished. Bowen was added to Kevin Rudd&#x27;s shadow ministry in 2006, and following the ALP&#x27;s victory at the 2007 election served variously as Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, and Human Services. After Julia Gillard replaced Rudd as prime minister in June 2010, Bowen was made the Minister Immigration and Citizenship, and also served as the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research, Small Business for a brief time in 2013.

In June 2013, Rudd replaced Gillard as prime minister in the final leadership contest between the two, and he assigned Bowen the role of Treasurer. He held this position for less than three months, as the ALP was defeated at the 2013 election. Bowen served briefly as the interim leader of the ALP and acting leader of the opposition. He was the shadow treasurer under Bill Shorten from 2013 to 2019. After the 2019 election, he became a candidate to succeed Shorten as party leader but eventually withdrew in favour of Anthony Albanese.

After the ALP&#x27;s victory in the 2022 election, Bowen was appointed Minister for Climate Change and Energy. He is regarded as a senior figure in the Labor Right faction.

==Early years and background==
Bowen was born in Sydney to Christine and Ross Bowen. His father worked for the National Roads and Motorists&#x27; Association, while his mother, who was born in the United Kingdom, was a childcare worker. Bowen grew up in the suburb of Smithfield. He began his education at Smithfield Public School, and later attended St Johns Park High School before going on to the University of Sydney, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Economics in 1994. One of his tutors was the future Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis.

==Political career==

Bowen was elected to Fairfield City Council in 1995 and was Mayor of Fairfield in 1998 and 1999. He was elected president of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (WSROC) in 1999 and served as president until 2001.

In 2004, Bowen was elected to the House of Representatives replacing Janice Crosio after she retired after 25 years in both state and federal politics. In 2006, Bowen was appointed to the Labor front bench as Shadow Assistant Treasurer and Shadow Minister for Revenue and Competition Policy.

===Government minister (2007–13)===
In December 2007 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd appointed him Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs. In June 2009 Bowen was promoted to cabinet as Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services.

In April 2010 Bowen announced significant reforms to the financial services sector including banning of commissions for financial planners giving advice on retail investment products including superannuation, managed investments and margin loans; instituting a statutory fiduciary duty so that financial advisers must act in the best interests of their clients, and increasing the powers of the corporate regulator; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The reforms were partially a response to the high-profile collapse of Storm Financial, Westpoint and Opes Prime and the resultant losses for retail investors, but also reflected global concerns with financial governance following the Global Financial crisis of 2007–2010. The reforms are due to be fully implemented on 1 July 2013.

In September 2010, Bowen was appointed Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, succeeding Senator Chris Evans. On 2 February 2013, Bowen replaced Evans as Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research. Evans was also Minister for Small Business.

Chris Bowen resigned his ministerial portfolios on 22 March 2013 after he supported an unsuccessful attempt to reinstall Kevin Rudd as prime minister.

Following the June 2013 leadership spill, Bowen was reinstated as a Cabinet Minister and given the portfolio of Treasurer. He was sworn in on 27 June 2013. He was also given responsibility for financial services and superannuation, including carriage of the MySuper and other Simple Super reforms previously held by Bill Shorten.

===Opposition (2013–22)===
Bowen was appointed Interim Leader of the Labor Party on 13 September 2013 following the resignation of Kevin Rudd in the wake of the party&#x27;s defeat in the 2013 federal election. He pledged not to stand in the October 2013 leadership spill which was contested by Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten. Shorten was elected as leader. Bowen was later appointed Shadow Treasurer by Bill Shorten.

After Labor&#x27;s loss in the 2019 federal election, Shorten announced his pending resignation as leader of the party. Bowen was considered a frontrunner to succeed him. On 21 May, Bowen announced his candidacy in the leadership ballot, but withdrew the following day. He was subsequently replaced as Shadow Treasurer by Jim Chalmers, but remained on the frontbench as Shadow Minister for Health.

As Shadow Treasurer after his stint as Treasurer, he was shadow to his three immediate successors as Treasurer, Joe Hockey, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg.

===Government minister (2022–)===
Following the 2022 federal election, Bowen was appointed Minister for Climate Change and Energy in the Albanese ministry.

Bowen faced criticism in early 2024 for taking a private jet to a ministerial announcement about clean energy, while the Prime Minister also flew there in another private jet. It was reported that the flights were taken on advice from the RAAF.

==Political positions==
Bowen supports same-sex marriage. Notably in 2017, his Division of McMahon had the 3rd highest percentage of &quot;No&quot; responses in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, with 64.9% of the electorate&#x27;s respondents to the survey responding &quot;No&quot;.

In April 2020, Bowen supported then Foreign Minister Marise Payne&#x27;s call for an independent global inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic including China&#x27;s handling of the initial outbreak in Wuhan.

==Personal life==
Bowen is married to Rebecca Mifsud, who worked for Toll Group as an industrial relations executive. They met at the 2000 ALP National Conference, where Mifsud was a delegate for the Electrical Trades Union. The couple have two children together and reside in Smithfield, Bowen&#x27;s childhood suburb.

Bowen&#x27;s mother lost two baby boys when the family was still living in the United Kingdom - in 1959 and in 1960. Bowen revealed this story in order to raise awareness to the lasting negative effects of stillbirths on families.

Bowen possesses a Diploma of Modern Language (Bahasa Indonesia) from the University of New England.

Bowen supports the Greater Western Sydney Giants in the Australian Football League.

<doc id="1066453" wikidata="Q1680838" url="?curid=1066453" title="James Mitchell (Australian politician)">
<text>Sir James Mitchell, (27 April 1866 – 26 July 1951) was an Australian politician. He served as premier of Western Australia from 1919 to 1924 and from 1930 to 1933, as leader of the Nationalist Party. He then held viceregal office from 1933 to 1951, as acting governor from 1933 to 1948 and governor of Western Australia from 1948 until his death in 1951.

Mitchell was born to a farming family in Dardanup, Western Australia. He became manager of the Western Australian Bank&#x27;s Northam branch. He was first elected to the Parliament of Western Australia in 1905 and held the seat of Northam for nearly three decades. Mitchell rose quickly to ministerial office where he was a keen advocate of agricultural development. He favoured government support of primary industry and sought to use assisted migration and soldier settlement to supply the necessary labour.

Mitchell first became premier in 1919 after a period of instability in state politics, governing in coalition with the Country Party despite earlier conflict. His first term saw minor social reforms and development initiatives, but was primarily known for the Group Settlement Scheme which established the South West dairy industry. Mitchell won the 1921 state election but was defeated in 1924. He returned as premier in 1930 at the height of the Great Depression, but suffered a landslide defeat three years later and lost his own seat. He notably authorised a secession referendum in 1933.

After losing office, Mitchell was appointed lieutenant-governor by his successor Philip Collier. The office of governor was left vacant during the Great Depression as a cost-saving measure, with Mitchell serving as acting governor until being formally commissioned in the role in 1948. He died in office in 1951.

==Early life ==
Mitchell was born on 27 April 1866 in Dardanup, Western Australia. He was the oldest of thirteen children born to Caroline (née Morgan) and William Bedford Mitchell; his father was a farm manager and grazier.

Mitchell was educated in Bunbury and joined the Western Australian Bank in 1885. He was initially posted to Geraldton before becoming manager of the bank&#x27;s Northam branch in 1890. Both he and the bank prospered during the Western Australian gold rushes, with Northam serving as a key staging point on the Eastern Goldfields Railway. Mitchell&#x27;s success allowed him to take up farming and he remained keenly interested in agricultural development throughout his political career. He was appointed as a justice of the peace in 1897.

==Early political career==

Mitchell was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly at the 1905 Western Australian state election, winning the seat of Northam. In parliament he &quot;earnestly advocated agricultural settlement and deplored Western Australia&#x27;s dependence on imported produce, seeking to place families on the land, particularly as the goldfields declined and miners looked elsewhere&quot;. He was made a minister without portfolio in Newton Moore&#x27;s government in 1906 and in 1909 was promoted to Minister for Agriculture and Lands. He added the Industries portfolio in 1910 when Frank Wilson replaced Moore as premier.

At the 1911 state election, Wilson&#x27;s government was defeated by the Australian Labor Party (ALP) under John Scaddan. Mitchell as agriculture minister had presided over an expansion of the area of land under cultivation, with government support initiatives and the introduction of superphosphate pushing out the eastern boundaries of the Wheatbelt into the Yilgarn. However, unusually low rainfall in the early 1910s led to the failure of many farms. Mitchell &quot;was blamed for his bland optimism in allegedly throwing new settlers into the bush with just an axe&quot;. He was targeted by the newly formed Farmers&#x27; and Settlers&#x27; Association, which evolved into the Country Party and won eight seats at the 1914 state election. Wilson returned as premier in 1916 in an alliance with the Country Party, which refused to allow Mitchell to return as agriculture minister. He was reappointed to the industries portfolio and also made Minister for Railways and Water Supply.

==Premier (1919–1924)==
On 17 May 1919, Premier Hal Colebatch resigned and Mitchell succeeded to the position. Mitchell won the 1921 election and remained premier until 1924. During this period he garnered much publicity for his strong support for the soldier settlement scheme in the south-west of Western Australia. As a result of his enthusiastic promotion of this scheme (which ultimately proved very costly in terms of money and resources) he was dubbed &quot;Moo-Cow&quot; Mitchell by the local press. Nonetheless, the establishment of a dairy industry in Western Australia can be largely credited to him. He also proved adept at dealing with the divisions between the Nationalist Party and the Country Party.

Mitchell took steps to develop the North-West, including the appoint of a resident commissioner to encourage cotton-growing and tropic agriculture. Together with his senior ministers Hal Colebatch, John Scaddan, and William George, Mitchell pursued interventionist economic policies, and thereby &quot;antagonized conservative businessmen by their pragmatic willingness to maintain state-owned industries and state intervention in price-fixing and other industrial activities&quot;.

In his first term as premier, Mitchell&#x27;s attorney-general Thomas Draper introduced legislation to allow women to stand for parliament and to liberalise the state&#x27;s divorce laws. Draper was subsequently defeated by Edith Cowan at the 1921 state election, who became the first Australian woman elected to parliament. In 1922, Mitchell supported Cowan&#x27;s successful private member&#x27;s bill to allow mothers to inherit an equal share from their children who died intestate. He also supported her anti-sex discrimination bill to allow women to be admitted to the legal profession, although he opposed a clause eliminating the marriage bar.

Beginning with the 1919–20 summer, Perth faced a severe water shortage owing to a failure to expand the water supply in line with rapid growth in suburban areas. Mitchell&#x27;s government introduced water restrictions in January 1920 and again in December 1920, including bans on sprinklers and street watering (widely used for dust suppression). In March 1923, Mitchell announced the Hills Water Supply Scheme, which provided for the creation of new reservoirs in the Perth Hills – including Canning Dam, Churchman Brook Dam, and Wungong Dam – but was estimated to take six years to complete. In the summer of 1923–24, elevated areas of Perth again experienced severe water shortages and had to rely on water carting. Mitchell and his government, who primarily represented rural electorates, were seen as unsympathetic and the crisis contributed to the government&#x27;s defeat at the 1924 election.

==Premier (1930–1933)==
Mitchell&#x27;s election to a second term in office at the 1930 election coincided with the onset of the Great Depression. His government was defeated at the 1933 elections, in addition to which he became the first Western Australian premier to lose both a state election and his parliamentary seat (of Northam).

In November 1930, Mitchell declared his personal support for the secession of Western Australia. The movement for secession, led by the Dominion League of Western Australia, had accelerated following the Great Depression in response to perceived inaction by the federal government, with Mitchell describing himself as a &quot;federalist who could not pay the price&quot;. In November 1931, his government introduced a bill for a secession referendum, which was ultimately passed as the &quot;Secession Referendum Act 1932&quot;. The referendum was held at the same time as the 1933 election and saw Western Australia vote to secede by nearly two-thirds, although it was ultimately unsuccessful.

==Governor==

As a result of financial difficulties during the Great Depression, Tasmania had appointed a lieutenant governor in the 1930s. With the approval of the major political parties, in July 1933 Mitchell was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Western Australia. This meant that, although he resided in Government House, Perth, and was governor in all but name, he drew no salary, thus making a reduced demand on the public purse at a time when ordinary people were under severe restraint. He held the position until he was finally appointed Governor of Western Australia in 1948. Mitchell was the first Australian-born Governor of Western Australia; he remains the only person to have served as both premier and governor of the state. He retired from the post in June 1951.

==Personal life==
In 1888, Mitchell married Clara Robinson Spencer, the daughter of Bunbury mayor William Spencer. The couple had three sons and a daughter; three of his children predeceased him and he was widowed in 1949.

==Death==

Mitchell died on 26 July 1951, aged 85, in his personal railway carriage while stopped at the small siding at Glen Mervyn south of Collie, while on a tour of the southwest of the state. He was granted a state funeral and buried at Karrakatta Cemetery.

===Legacy===
The Mitchell Freeway was named in his honour, as was Sir James Mitchell Park in South Perth and Sir James Mitchell National Park. The botanist Charles Gardner named the rapier featherflower &quot;Verticordia mitchelliana&quot; in his honour.

<text>Lieutenant General Sir Charles Henry Gairdner, (20 March 1898 – 22 February 1983) was a senior British Army officer who later occupied two viceregal positions in Australia. Born in Batavia (now Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies, he was brought up in Ireland, and educated at Repton School and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in England. Having served on active duty during the First World War, in which he sustained a serious wound to his right leg, Gairdner spent time at the Staff College, Camberley in the interwar period, and served as commanding officer of the 10th Royal Hussars, 6th Armoured Division and 8th Armoured Division during the Second World War. He retired from the army in 1949 and was appointed Governor of Western Australia in 1951, a position in which he served until 1963, when he assumed the role of Governor of Tasmania until 1968. Gairdner died in Nedlands, at the age of 84, and was awarded a state funeral.

==Early life==
Gairdner was born in Batavia, Netherlands East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia) on 20 March 1898. Brought up in County Galway, Ireland, he was educated at Repton School in England, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He married the Hon. Evelyn Constance Handcock, daughter of Albert Handcock, 5th Baron Castlemaine, in 1925.

==Military career==
Upon graduation, Gairdner was commissioned a second lieutenant in the artillery in May 1916 and sent to the Western Front. In this campaign, he sustained a serious wound to the right leg which necessitated numerous operations throughout his life and eventual amputation in 1976. After the war he transferred to cavalry. He spent two years at the Staff College, Camberley from 1933 to 1934. As a lieutenant colonel, from 1937 to 1940 he was the commanding officer of the 10th Royal Hussars, before being chief of staff of the 7th Armoured Division then General Officer Commanding of the 6th and 8th Armoured Divisions. Gairdner was General Sir Harold Alexander&#x27;s Chief of Staff during the planning stage of Operation Husky but was relieved and went on to become Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s personal emissary to Douglas MacArthur in the Far East. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom by the United States on 16 January 1947. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1941, Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1946 and Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1948.

==Governor of Western Australia and Tasmania==
Gairdner&#x27;s distinguished military career was rewarded in 1951 when he was appointed Governor of Western Australia. He was governor during a number of royal visits to Perth – the earliest being that of Queen Elizabeth II in 1954. His long residency in Western Australia was during a time when Perth and Western Australia were undergoing significant post-war change. He was very popular with the Western Australian public.

Gairdner&#x27;s tenure was relatively free of political or constitutional crisis. When Labor&#x27;s loss of the October 1955 Bunbury by-election resulted in the Albert Hawke government&#x27;s losing its parliamentary majority, the possibility was raised that the governor might have to exercise his reserve powers. However the parliament remained in recess until Labor won the ensuing 1956 general election. The Perth Chest Hospital was renamed Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in his honour in May 1963. Gairdner stepped down from his post on 26 June 1963. He lobbied for the position of Governor of Tasmania and on 23 September 1963 was appointed for five years.

In February 1969 the Gairdners returned to Perth and settled at Peppermint Grove. Survived by his wife, Gairdner died on 22 February 1983 at Nedlands and was cremated after a state funeral.

Gairdner was a freemason. During his terms as both Governor of Western Australia and Governor of Tasmania, he was also Grand Master of the respective Grand Lodges.

<text>Emperor Duy Tân (, , lit. &quot;renovation&quot;; 19 September 1900 – 26 December 1945), born Nguyễn Phúc Vĩnh San, was the 11th emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty in Vietnam, who reigned for nine years between 1907 and 1916.

==Early childhood==
Duy Tân (at the time, known by his birth name, Prince Nguyễn Phúc Vĩnh San) was son of the Thành Thái emperor. Because of his opposition to French rule and his erratic, depraved actions (which some speculate were feigned to shield his opposition from the French) Thành Thái was declared insane and exiled to Vũng Tàu in 1907. The French decided to pass the throne to his son Nguyễn Phúc Vĩnh San, despite the fact that he was only seven years old. The French hoped that someone so young would be easily influenced and controlled, and thus raised to be pro-French.
==Reign, 1906–1916==
The efforts on the part of the French to raise the prince to support them largely failed. Nguyễn Phúc Vĩnh San was enthroned with the reign name of Duy Tân, meaning &quot;friend of reform&quot;, but in time he proved incapable of living up to this name. As he became older he noticed that, even though he was treated as the emperor, it was the colonial authorities who were actually obeyed. As he became a teenager, Emperor Duy Tân came under the influence of the mandarin Trần Cao Vân, who was very much opposed to the colonial administration. Emperor Duy Tân began to plan a secret rebellion with Trần Cao Vân and others to overthrow the French.
In 1916, while France was preoccupied with fighting World War I, Emperor Duy Tân was smuggled out of the Forbidden City with Trần Cao Vân to call upon the people to rise up against the French. However, the secret was revealed, and France immediately sent troops there, and after only a few days, they were betrayed and captured by the French authorities. Because of his age and to avoid a worse situation, Emperor Duy Tân was deposed and exiled instead of being killed. Trần Cao Vân and the rest of the revolutionaries were all beheaded.

==Life in exile==

The former emperor was exiled with his father (Thành Thái) to Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean. Prince Vĩnh San continued to favor national liberation for Vietnam in exile. 

===World War II service and death===
During World War II he resisted the Vichy Regime until the Liberation of La Réunion, after which he joined the Free French Forces and became a low-ranking naval officer on the , serving as radio officer. He then joined the Free French army as a second lieutenant in December 1942, receiving successive promotions to lieutenant (1943), captain (1944), major (July 1945) and lieutenant-colonel (September 1945).

When France was facing defeat by the Viet Minh, and the regime of Emperor Bảo Đại proved incapable of gaining any public support, French leader Charles de Gaulle talked to Prince Vĩnh San, who was still very popular in the Vietnamese public memory for his patriotism, about returning to Vietnam as emperor. However, he died in a plane crash in Central Africa on his way home to Vietnam in 1945 and the great hopes of many died with him – as a patriotic challenge to Hồ Chí Minh. For his wartime service, the French posthumously awarded him the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour and the Officer&#x27;s Médaille de la Résistance, also appointing him a Companion of the Ordre de la Libération.

==Reburial in Vietnam==
In 1987, his son, Prince Bảo Vàng, and the royal family of Vietnam accompanied his father&#x27;s remains, which were removed from Africa and brought home to Vietnam in a traditional ceremony to rest in the tomb of his grandfather, Emperor Dục Đức. In 2001, Prince Bảo Vang wrote a book titled &quot;Duy Tân, Empereur d&#x27;Annam 1900–1945&quot; about his father&#x27;s life.
Most cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him.

<text>Saint-Gaudens (; ) is a commune and a sub-prefecture of the Haute-Garonne department in southwestern France.

Saint-Gaudens lies at an altitude of on a ledge overlooking the valley of the Garonne. It faces the Pyrenees and is a natural crossroads for routes between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Toulouse and the Val d&#x27;Aran in Catalonia. Saint-Gaudens station has rail connections to Toulouse, Bayonne, Pau and Tarbes.

==History==
Saint-Gaudens has been inhabited since ancient times (traces of the Iron Age and of Roman occupation) and was originally called Mas-Saint-Pierre, before taking the name of the young shepherd, Gaudens, martyred by the Visigoths at the end of the 5th century for refusing to renounce his faith.

The town later developed around the 11th century Romanesque church. It was granted its city charter in 1202 and became the capital of the Nébouzan area, protected by solid ramparts. As an important regional marketplace, Saint-Gaudens became the economic capital of the Comminges.

The town was damaged by Protestant forces under Montgomery in 1569, and became the seat of the Nébouzan Assembly after coming under the control of the French crown in 1607. The name was changed briefly to &quot;Mont-Unité&quot; during the Revolution and the area later became part of the Haute-Garonne department. In 1974 it absorbed the former commune Lieoux, which was re-established as a separate commune in 2008.

==Population==
==Sights==

The Collegiate Church of St. Peter and St. Gaudens, with its cloister and chapter house, this was one of the most important religious buildings in the Comminges.
It was home to a college of canons ordinary, a community founded by Bishop Bertrand.
The 11th century romanesque church, built on the typical Pyrenean plan as a basilica with a nave and two aisles, stands on the site of an earlier construction.
It was extended in the 12th and 13th centuries with the construction of the cloister and chapter house. The lateral north door was added in the 16th century.

Several tall buildings are reminders of the city&#x27;s medieval period, with plain façades to which balconies were added at the end of the 19th century. Other buildings, including some town houses, date back to the 18th century, and are decorated with stone carvings. Some buildings have façades with pediments, friezes and cornices, mouldings, and gabled dormer windows. On Boulevard Bepmale the façades that face the Sun, with a view of the Pyrenees, have balconies and galleries up to their very top floors.

==Sport==
St Gaudens has a Rugby League (Rugby XIII) team playing in the French Championship, the Saint-Gaudens Bears.

St Gaudens also hosts a popular rugby union team (Rugby XV) SSGL (Stade Saint-Gaudinois Luchonnais XV).

<doc id="1066462" wikidata="Q5301679" url="?curid=1066462" title="Douglas Kendrew">
<text>Major General Sir Douglas Anthony Kendrew, (22 July 1910 – 28 February 1989) was an officer of the British Army who served in the Second World War and the Korean War, an international rugby player, and the 22nd Governor of Western Australia from 1963 to 1974. Kendrew was sometimes known as Joe Kendrew, especially during his rugby career.

==Early life, family and rugby career==
Douglas Anthony Kendrew was born in Barnstaple, Devon, England on 22 July 1910: he was the elder son of Alexander John Kendrew, and was educated at Uppingham School. He married in 1936 Nora Elizabeth Harvey, of Malin Hall, County Donegal; the couple had a son and a daughter. His daughter Marcia subsequently married Colonel Richard Abel Smith, the son of Sir Henry Abel Smith, a Governor of Queensland.

Kendrew played rugby union for England 10 times and was captain of the team in 1935. He was a member of the 1930 British Lions tour of Australasia but did not represent the Lions in any of the test matches. He captained the Army Rugby Union team in the Army Navy Match against the Royal Navy winning 11–8, on 2 March 1935. In that match he played in a formidable front row of prop Frank Whitcombe and hooker A. J. A. Watson, in a famous victory with the Army team having only 13 players; for most of the match the scrum packed down with only six forwards due to injuries.

==Military career==
Kendrew joined Uppingham School Officer Training Corps, and attained the rank of cadet under officer.

Kendrew was commissioned as a second lieutenant with the Leicestershire Regiment Supplementary Reserve of Officers on 18 January 1930, and joined the regiment on 28 August 1931. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1934, captain in 1939 and major in 1946 (he held appointments as acting or temporary major, lieutenant colonel, colonel and brigadier at various times and ended the war as a war substantive lieutenant colonel). From November 1936 until December 1938 he served as assistant instructor and instructor at the Tank Driving and Maintenance School (subsequently the Armoured Fighting Vehicle School) at Bovington Camp. Kendrew was then an instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst until 1 September 1939, the day the Second World War began. 

During the war, Kendrew served in North Africa and Italy as a brigade major with the 36th Brigade from 1942. From 12 February 1943 until 18 March 1943 he was a general staff officer, 2nd grade (GSO2) (Operations) at First Army headquarters in Tunisia. He commanded the 6th Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, of 138th Infantry Brigade in 46th Infantry Division, in North Africa and Italy in 1943 and served as commander of the 128th (Hampshire) Infantry Brigade in Italy, Middle East, Greece and Austria between 1944 and 1946. His leadership and bravery saw the distinction of him being awarded the Distinguished Service Order three times during this period.

After the war, from June until November 1946, Kendrew was general staff officer, 1st grade (GSO1) (Infantry) at Central Mediterranean Forces headquarters. Two training appointments followed immediately: until August 1948 he was commandant at the School of Infantry of the British Army of the Rhine and then commandant at the Army Apprentices School, Harrogate until 13 September 1950. Kendrew had been appointed several times as acting and temporary lieutenant colonel, colonel and brigadier from March 1943 and on 28 July 1951 he received the permanent rank of colonel. He was appointed to the Adjutant General&#x27;s and Quartermaster General&#x27;s Staff, Northern Ireland District in October 1950 and served there until 27 September 1952.

During the Korean War, as a temporary brigadier, Kendrew commanded the 29th Infantry Brigade, Commonwealth Division and received the rare distinction of a fourth award of the DSO. In 1954 and 1955 he served at the Imperial Defence College. He was Brigadier A/Q at the adjutant general&#x27;s &amp; Quartermaster General&#x27;s Staff at Headquarters Northern Command (York) from 10 March 1955 until 28 September 1956.

Kendrew was appointed in the temporary rank of major general as general officer commanding and director of operations Cyprus District in October 1956 until October 1958, during a turbulent period of British rule. In September 1958 he survived an assassination attempt by EOKA fighters, which killed one of his escorts. During his time in Cyprus, Kendrew&#x27;s permanent rank was advanced to brigadier on 19 April 1957, and then to that of major general on 29 June.

For two years from December 1958, Kendrew was director of infantry at the War Office in London. He was the director of information at the War Office from 1959 to 1960 and then head of British Defence Liaison Staff at the British High Commission to Australia in Canberra from 1961 to 1963. He retired from the army on 1 September 1963.

==Governorship and retirement==
As a retired officer, Kendrew became Colonel of the Royal Leicestershire Regiment from May 1963 until the reorganisation in September 1964, when he became Deputy Colonel of The Royal Anglian Regiment, holding the post until August 1965.

Kendrew was appointed Governor of Western Australia on 23 September 1963, serving until 6 January 1974. His term was extended twice.

Kendrew was honorary colonel of the Special Air Service Regiment, RWAR Australia in 1965; president of the Knights of the Round Table (1975–83); commissioner, Royal Hospital, Chelsea (1974–80).

Kendrew died on 28 February 1989 at Islip, Northamptonshire.

<text>Daniele Capezzone (born 8 September 1972) is an Italian journalist and former politician.

From 14 July 2001 to 4 November 2006, he was secretary of the Italian Radicals, a liberal, pro-market economy, libertarian movement associated with the Transnational Radical Party. He has been one of the youngest party-secretaries in Italy so far.

In 2006-2008, he was the President of the 10th Permanent Commission (Productive Affairs, Trade and Tourism) of the Italian Chamber of Deputies.

==Biography==

Graduated at &quot;Lucio Manara&quot; Secondary School in Classical Studies in Rome, he attended Law Faculty at LUISS &quot;Guido Carli&quot; University until 1997. On 1 January 1998, he attended a Radical Party demonstration, where he first met the radical leader Marco Pannella. He then dropped the studies and became a political activist. On 14 July 2001, he was elected Secretary of the newly-born party of the Italian Radicals.

In 2003, he published his first book, &quot;A radical shock for 21st Century&quot;, a synthesis of the Radicals&#x27; proposals for the constitution of a &quot;World Democracy Organization&quot;. The contents of the book were presented at the Washington D.C. American Enterprise Institute in March 2004.

In 2004 Capezzone published his second book, &quot;Euroghost - Un fantasma si aggira per l&#x27;Europa: l&#x27;Europa&quot; (English translation: &quot;Euroghost - A Ghost wanders through Europe: Europe itself&quot;); he undertook a 54-day-long hunger strike (with the Italian Radicals Treasurer, Rita Bernardini, and the death-penalty abolitionist organization &quot;Hands Off Cain&quot; President, Sergio D&#x27;Elia), asking the Italian Parliament to pass a general pardon-law; he wrote some op-ed articles for the Italian right-wing newspaper &quot;Libero&quot; and for The Washington Times.

Capezzone became a well-known politician also for his appearances in the satirical TV show &quot;Markette&quot; (on private TV-channel La7) and for his caricature-imitation made by Italian comedian Neri Marcorè in another satirical TV show, &quot;Superciro&quot; (on private TV-channel Italia 1).

During Spring 2005, he undertook another hunger strike (once more with Rita Bernardini) asking to the Italian public service broadcaster RAI to give more space to the debates on the Radical referendum proposals for partially abrogate the law on artificial insemination, particularly strict in Italy. The four proposals, held on 12 and 13 June 2005, were however invalidated due to high abstentionism.

In November 2005, Capezzone was re-confirmed as Italian Radicals&#x27; Secretary for the fourth time in a row and he conducted the birth of the Rose in the Fist, a libertarian-socialist federation with the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI). He was elected in the general election of 2006 as a member of the Chamber of Deputies and, on 6 June 2006, as President of the 10th Permanent Commission, becoming the first radical politician to be elected as a President of a Permanent Commission in the Italian Parliament.

During the 5th Congress of the Italian Radicals (held in Padova, 2–5 November 2006), Capezzone has been harshly challenged by many Radical leaders, because of his criticism to the Prodi II Cabinet (mostly stigmatized from Minister of European Politics and International Trade, Emma Bonino) and for an alleged personalistic management of the movement, which allegedly caused a worsening of the economical condition of the party.

In the previous days, newspapers reported &quot;rumours&quot; about the likelihood of his substitution at the party Secretariat, in favour of the Treasurer Rita Bernardini. The Radicals historical leader Marco Pannella justified that substitution not as &quot;an act of disconfidence&quot; on Capezzone, but as the prosecution of a historical custom of no overlapping of party- and parliamentarian-appointments.

Newspapers however insisted on a break-up between Pannella and Capezzone (shown respectively as &quot;the past&quot; and &quot;the future&quot; of the Radical movement), re-publishing an audio/video recording (already published by Radio Radicale&#x27;s website) of a very lively discussion between the two politicians, during the Italian Radicals&#x27; National Direction meeting held on 26 October 2006. Also in October, Capezzone came out as bisexual He will later in other interview insist his sexual life is private.

After an even more lively Italian Radicals&#x27; National Direction meeting held on the night of 4 November 2006, during the 5th Congress of the movement, Capezzone accepted not to offer himself for the fifth time in a row for the Secretariat and to support instead the candidature of the Treasurer Rita Bernardini. The 5th Congress accepted anyway his proposal of General Motion (co-signed with Bernardini), that committed the Italian Radicals to relaunch the Rose in the Fist alliance and to press the Prodi II Cabinet for embark new libertarian proposals on economy and civil rights.

From that time, anyway, Capezzone started to distance himself from his party and to be very critical with Prodi II Cabinet, which he says not to support anymore. In June 2007, despite not having left the Radicals yet, he launched his own political association, Decide!, mounting rumors that he was heading towards the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition. On 7 November Capezzone finally left the Italian Radicals and the Rose in the Fist.

He has been the spokesman of Forza Italia and then of The People of Freedom.

<text>Russell Evan Broadbent (born 25 December 1950) is an Australian politician who is a member of the House of Representatives, representing the Division of Monash (previously McMillan). He is one of the longest-serving current members of parliament, having been in parliament for over 25 years, from 1990 to 1993, from 1996 to 1998, and since 2004. In November 2023, he stood down from the Liberal Party and its parliamentary party room and joined the crossbench in response to losing his party endorsement ahead of a federal election the 2025 federal election. He intends to stand for re-election the 2025 election.

==Early life==
Broadbent was born on 25 December 1950 in Koo Wee Rup, Victoria. He was a company director and self-employed retailer before entering politics. In the 1970s he was a &quot;jumpsuit-wearing singer of show band The Trutones, which reportedly once opened for John Farnham&quot;.

Broadbent served on the Pakenham Shire Council from 1981 to 1987, including as shire president from 1984 to 1985. He also served as a commissioner of the Dandenong Valley Authority from 1984 to 1987 and as chairman of the Western Port Development Council from 1985 to 1990.

==Politics==
Broadbent was an unsuccessful candidate for the Division of Streeton in the 1984 and 1987 federal elections. He first entered parliament as member for the marginal Division of Corinella at the 1990 federal election, but lost to Labor&#x27;s Alan Griffin at the 1993 election. At the 1996 federal election, he challenged Barry Cunningham in what was then the suburban-rural seat of McMillan, and won it after a very close race, but was defeated by Labor&#x27;s Christian Zahra at the 1998 election. Broadbent contested and was elected for McMillan again at the 2004 election, after a redistribution erased the Labor majority and made it notionally Liberal. He was re-elected at the 2007 federal election, at the same time as the Coalition lost government, and has held the seat ever since. He supported changing the name of his electorate to commemorate John Monash rather than Angus McMillan.

Broadbent served on the speaker&#x27;s panel from 2013 to 2019. He has served on a wide range of parliamentary committees, including as chair of the standing committees on privileges and members&#x27; interests (2013–2019) and treaties (2018–present), and of the select committee into intergenerational welfare dependence (2018–2019). In May 2017, Broadbent announced he would be resigning from the speaker&#x27;s panel and his committee chairmanship to protest against the Turnbull government&#x27;s inaction on aged care. He stated that ministers Greg Hunt and Ken Wyatt had misled him over the construction of a facility at Bunyip, within his electorate.

On 12 November 2023, Broadbent lost Liberal preselection for the 2025 Australian federal election to Mary Aldred, who is the daughter of his late parliamentary colleague Ken Aldred. Two days later, he resigned from the Liberal Party.

Broadbent was factionally unaligned during his time in the Liberal Party.

==Political views==

===Asylum seekers===
During the Howard government, he came to national prominence after siding with Liberal dissident Petro Georgiou in advocating better treatment of detainees. He supports not charging long-term detainees for their detention. In 2017 he was described by &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; as &quot;an outspoken critic of harsh asylum seeker policies&quot;, after delivering a speech in which he called the Manus Regional Processing Centre &quot;unacceptable&quot; and publicly opposed the Turnbull government&#x27;s policy of re-settling asylum seekers in the United States.

===Climate change===
Broadbent has said that global warming is &quot;an issue for Australia and an issue for the world.&quot; He is also an advocate for bike paths as a benefit to community health, transport and the environment. He has expressed interest in improving funding for Landcare Australia.

===Indigenous Australians===
In January 2021 he stated that the Morrison government should support the Uluru Statement from the Heart and move towards constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. Indeed, in February 2023, Broadbent and conservative Liberal powerbroker Karina Okotel wrote a book in support of constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. However, in September 2023, Broadbent ‘backflipped’ and announced that he would vote No in the subsequently unsuccessful referendum.

===Same-sex marriage===
In December 2017, Broadbent was one of only four members of the House of Representatives to vote against the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, which legalised same-sex marriage in Australia.

===COVID-19===
Broadbent took a personal decision not to be vaccinated against COVID-19, with any of the available vaccines, in 2021, and stated that he neither encouraged nor discouraged constituents to get vaccinated. His decision not to get vaccinated can potentially render him unable to carry out his duties as an MP, due to a state mandate that all authorised workers in the state, including federal politicians, must be vaccinated. Broadbent caught COVID in January 2022 and self-administered ivermectin but whose use to cure COVID was widely promoted by anti-vaccination groups at the time.

In February 2022, Broadbent made headlines after promoting ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19 in Parliament, claiming that he and his wife had taken it after testing positive to the virus. He was one of a handful of Australian MPs known to have refused COVID-19 vaccination and is against COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

===Taxation===
In 2022 Broadbent opposed plans by Labor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to continue with a series of tax cuts on high-income earners due to kick in in 2024 in contrast to his party&#x27;s stance, arguing that cutting taxes on wealthy individuals in the poor economic situation following the COVID-19 pandemic was not appropriate.

=== Superannuation ===
In 2023, Broadbent voiced support for plans to remove tax breaks on superannuation balances over $3 million, which would add roughly $54 billion in tax revenue to government pockets. The removal of the tax cut has been suggested by social services groups to allow for more funding to be directed to Australians living in poverty.

Broadbent stated that if the funds can be used wisely to help the Australian people he would support the policy despite Albanese stating that he would not tax superannuation before the next election.

==Personal life==
Broadbent has three children. he and his wife lived outside his electorate in Pakenham, Victoria, in the Division of La Trobe. In 2017 he bought an investment property in Palm Cove, Queensland.

<text>Air Chief Marshal Sir Wallace Hart Kyle, (22 January 1910 – 31 January 1988) was an Australian who served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a senior commander and later as the 24th Governor of Western Australia. Born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, Kyle was commissioned into the RAF in 1929, and, having seen service in the Second World War and the Malayan Emergency, held a number of senior positions, including Vice-Chief of the Air Staff and commander-in-chief of the RAF&#x27;s Bomber Command and Strike Command. He was made Governor of Western Australia in 1975, a position in which he served until 1980, later returning to England, where he died in 1988.

==Early life==
Kyle was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, on 22 January 1910 to Alfred Kyle, a builder, and Christina Ellen (née Beck). He was educated at Kalgoorlie State School and later Guildford Grammar School, where he was a boarder and proved a capable sportsman and athlete.

==RAF career==
Kyle entered the Royal Air Force College Cranwell in 1928 and was commissioned into the Royal Air Force in December 1929. While at Cranwell, he represented the college at cricket, squash and tennis and he attained the rank of flight cadet corporal.

As a pilot officer, Kyle was posted to No 17 Squadron as a pilot and subsequently, on 2 July 1931, to No 442 (Fleet Spotter Reconnaissance) Flight Fleet Air Arm as a flying officer (promoted 14 June 1931) (until 1939, the Fleet Air Arm was controlled by the RAF). He spent time at the RAF Depot from 12 August 1932 until his next operational posting to No 820 Squadron Fleet Air Arm on 2 May 1933. From 23 July, Kyle attended the Flying Instructor&#x27;s Course at the Central Flying School, returning to Cranwell as an instructor on 20 October 1934. His promotion to flight lieutenant came on 14 June 1935.

Kyle went to Australia on an exchange posting with the Royal Australian Air Force in April 1936, returning to Britain in 1938. He was appointed as Squadron Commander at No 3 Flying Training School at RAF South Cerney on 25 June 1938 (he was promoted to squadron leader for this appointment). From 17 July 1939, he was appointed to the Air Staff, HQ Training Command and HQ Flying Training Command.

Kyle served in the Second World War and in 1940, after various posts in Bomber Command, he was appointed Officer Commanding No. 139 Squadron and received the temporary rank of wing commander on 1 December 1940. Kyle was appointed as Station Commander at RAF Marham in 1942 and another temporary promotion, to group captain, on 1 July 1943. He was appointed as Station Commander at RAF Downham Market on 7 March 1944 and then transferred to the Air Staff, HQ Bomber Command on 9 October 1944.

After the war, in 1945, Kyle joined the Directing Staff at the RAF Staff College, Bracknell. The temporary promotions received during the war were subsequently made substantive with permanent promotions to wing commander on 1 October 1946 and to group captain on 1 July 1947. Kyle joined the Air Plans team at Headquarters RAF Mediterranean &amp; Middle East in October 1948. On 26 April 1949, he was appointed Air Aide de Camp to the King and continued as Air Aide de Camp to the Queen until 31 July 1956.

Kyle was appointed Assistant Commandant at Cranwell in 1951 and Director of Operational Requirements (Air) at the Air Ministry on 30 June 1952, with promotion to air commodore on 1 July. He became a temporary air vice-marshal and Air Officer Commanding at Air Headquarters Malaya on 14 January 1955 during the Malayan Emergency (the promotion was made permanent on 1 July 1955), Assistant Chief of the Air Staff (Operational Requirements) on 1 September 1957 and Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Technical Training Command on 29 September 1959. The last appointment came with a temporary promotion to air marshal which was made permanent on 1 January 1961. He became Vice-Chief of the Air Staff on 2 March 1962 and Air Officer Commander-in-Chief Bomber Command on 19 February 1965; he had been promoted to air chief marshal on 1 January 1964. Bomber Command merged with Fighter Command to form Strike Command, and Kyle became Strike Command&#x27;s first Air Officer Commander-in-Chief on 30 April 1968.

On 12 August 1966, Kyle was again appointed to be Air Aide-de-camp to The Queen, which he remained until his retirement from the RAF on 9 November 1968.

==Governorship and retirement==
Kyle served as Governor of Western Australia from 1975 until 1980 and briefly caused excitement when he spoke out in favour of developing a uranium processing plant at Kalgoorlie in 1978.

Kyle died on 31 January 1988 at Lymington.

In 1995, Lady Kyle renamed the South Wing of the RAF Benevolent Fund&#x27;s Princess Marina House in Sussex, the &quot;Kyle Wing&quot; in Sir Wallace&#x27;s honour. Sir Wallace Kyle had been the first chairman of the home.

==Honours and awards==
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath – 1 Jan 1966 (KCB – 1 January 1960, CB – 1 January 1953)
* Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order – 5 August 1977 [26 March 1977]
* Commander of the Order of the British Empire – 1 January 1946

* Distinguished Flying Cross – 2 May 1941
Citation for the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross:
&quot;Wing Commander Wallace Hart KYLE (26141), No.139 Squadron.
In April, 1941, this officer led an attack against Ijmuiden Iron and Steel Works. In spite of intense anti-aircraft fire and interference from a patrol of Messerschmitt l09&#x27;s, he dropped his bombs on the target from a height of 50 feet. The enemy fighters followed Wing Commander Kyle out to sea, but, by his skilful flying, he forced them to break off the attack. The operation was an outstanding success. He has now completed a number of successful operational missions and his resolute determination and leadership have been largely responsible for the high standard of efficiency in his squadron&quot;.
* Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John – 26 February 1976
* Air Aide de Camp to the King – 26 April 1949
* Air Aide de Camp to the Queen – 10 June 1952 to 31 July 1956

<doc id="1066473" wikidata="Q1508574" url="?curid=1066473" title="George Welch (pilot)">
<text>George Schwartz Welch (May 10, 1918 – October 12, 1954) was a World War II triple ace, a Distinguished Service Cross recipient, and an experimental aircraft pilot after the war. Welch is best known for having been one of the few United States Army Air Corps fighter pilots able to get airborne to engage Japanese forces in the attack on Pearl Harbor and for his work as a test pilot. Welch resigned from the United States Army Air Forces as a major in 1944, and became a test pilot for North American Aviation.

==Early life==
George Schwartz Welch was born George Lewis Schwartz, Jr. to George Lewis Schwartz, Sr. (November 15, 1887 – May 30, 1972) and Julia Ann Welch (April 29, 1891 – May 21, 1974), but his parents changed his name to avoid the anti-German sentiment that stemmed from World War I. His father was a senior research chemist for Dupont Experimental Test Station at Wilmington, Delaware. He had a younger brother named Dehn Schwartz Welch (March 31, 1920 – November 1, 1999) who served with the U.S. Army from 1941 to 1945. He attended St. Andrew&#x27;s School (1936). He completed three years of a mechanical engineering degree from Purdue University, before joining the Army Air Corps in 1939. While attending Purdue, he was initiated as a brother of Delta Upsilon. USAAC flight training schools that he attended included: Brooks Field, Kelly Field and Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas, as well as Hamilton Field in Novato, California.

==World War II==
After receiving his wings and commission in January 1941, Welch was posted to the 47th Pursuit Squadron, 15th Pursuit Group, at Wheeler Field, Oahu, Hawaii in February 1941.

At dawn on December 7, 1941, 2nd Lieutenant Welch and another pilot, 2nd Lieutenant Kenneth M. Taylor, were coming back from a Christmas dinner and dance party at a rooftop hotel in Waikiki, that ended in an all-night poker game. They were still wearing mess dress when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Welch telephoned the auxiliary Haleiwa Fighter Strip on Oahu&#x27;s North Shore to have two Curtiss P-40B Tomahawk fighters prepared for takeoff. Taylor immediately drove his Buick at high speed to Haleiwa to join the air battle. While climbing into their P-40s, the crew chiefs informed them that they should disperse their planes. &quot;To hell with that&quot;, Welch said.

Taking off with only .30-cal ammunition in the wing guns, Welch claimed two kills of Aichi D3A Val dive bombers over Ewa Mooring Mast Field. The first Japanese aircraft was only damaged and made it back to its carrier, while the second was finished off by Ken Taylor, shortly before he landed at Wheeler Field to get .50-cal ammo for his two cowl guns. On his second sortie, Welch shot down a Val (which was behind Ken Taylor, and crashed in the community of Wahiawa) then one Mitsubishi Zero fighter about 5 miles west of Barbers Point.

Both Welch and Taylor were nominated for the Medal of Honor by General Henry H. Arnold, but were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest US Army medal for valor, for their actions.

After Pearl Harbor, Welch returned to the continental United States to give war bond speeches until being assigned to the 36th Fighter Squadron of the 8th Fighter Group in New Guinea. Despite his aerial victories on December 7, 1941, Welch was dissatisfied with flying the poorly performing Bell P-39 Airacobra. Welch shot down a Zero and two Aichi D3A “Val” dive bombers on December 7, 1942, the first anniversary of Pearl Harbor. When asked by a journalist what aspect of the P-39 he liked, then seven-victory ace George Welch said, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s got 1200 pounds of Allison armor plate.&quot; This was a reference to the center-mounted engine (i.e.: behind the cockpit) rather than to actual armor plating. When Welch inquired as to when his squadron (the 36th FS) would receive Lockheed P-38 Lightnings, he was told, &quot;When we run out of P-39s.&quot; He repeatedly appealed to be assigned to the 80th Fighter Squadron (which flew P-38s) until he was granted a transfer. Between June 21 and September 2, 1943, flying a P-38H, Welch shot down nine more Japanese aircraft: two Zeros, three Ki-61 Tonys, three Ki-43 Oscars, and one Ki-46 Dinah. Welch flew three combat tours (a total of 348 combat missions with 16 confirmed victories, all achieved in multiples) before malaria brought an end to his time in combat.

==Mach 1 claim==
In the spring of 1944, Welch was approached by North American Aviation to become a company test pilot. With the recommendation of General Arnold, Welch resigned his commission in the United States Army Air Forces and accepted the job; his rank was as a major in the Air Reserve 13 November 1944 to 1 April 1953. He went on to fly the prototypes of the Navy&#x27;s North American FJ-1 and later the Army Air Forces&#x27; XP-86. North American originally proposed a straight-wing version of the XP-86 and the Army Air Forces accepted this on May 1, 1945. On November 1, North American, with the aid of captured German technology, proposed and was given permission for a major redesign of the XP-86 to a 35-degree, swept-wing configuration. This was new technology and the USA&#x27;s first high-speed, swept-wing airplane and a significant advance over Republic Aviation&#x27;s XP-84. Welch was chosen as chief test pilot for the project.

In September 1947, the first of three XP-86 prototypes (AAF Ser. No. 45-59597) was moved from North American&#x27;s Mines Field (later Los Angeles International Airport) to the Muroc North Base test facility (now Edwards AFB), the same base at which the Bell X-1 was being tested. The maiden flight of the XP-86 was on October 1, 1947, flown by Welch.

After about a 30-minute flight, Welch lowered the flaps and gear to land. At this point, the nose gear would not extend completely. For 40 minutes, Welch unsuccessfully tried everything to extend the nose gear. When he reached a low-fuel state, he elected to land on Muroc Lake Bed without a fully extended nose gear. Upon touchdown, in a nose-high attitude, Welch cut the engine, and as the XP-86 slowed, the nose gear snapped down and locked. The aircraft was undamaged.

Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington had instructed North American that they were not, under any circumstances, to break the sound barrier before the X-1 achieved this milestone. He could exercise his authority in this regard because both the XP-86 and X-1 were Air Force programs. Welch&#x27;s only complaints about the aircraft was the J35 engine lacked power and the rate of climb was only a disappointing per minute. North American, however, had already contracted with General Electric for more powerful J47 engines for the production P-86As.

In his book &quot;Aces Wild: The Race for Mach 1&quot; (1998), fellow North American test pilot Al Blackburn speculates that Welch may have broken the sound barrier two weeks before Chuck Yeager in an early flight of the XP-86 prototype. Welch himself never made that claim. Blackburn based his contention on interviews of eyewitnesses, former North American employees, and access to contemporary historical accounts. Robert Kempel, author of &quot;The Race For Mach 1&quot; contradicts the claim, contending for Welch&#x27;s aircraft to break the sound barrier with an underpowered engine was impossible. He notes that the XP-86 airframe was capable of transonic flight, but the interim low-power J35-C-3 limited its performance. The late Bob Hoover, chase pilot for Welch and Yeager, had also disputed the Welch story, stating that Welch was not flying that day because his plane was being repaired. The highest Mach number reached by Welch in 1947, as indicated by official flight test records, was about 0.93, in a maximum power dive from with the engine at 100.8% Military RPM (i.e. maximum power). North American conducted this test, their &quot;High Mach Number Investigation&quot;, on November 13. The USAF verified all North American results and this test Mach number in their own Phase II tests conducted in December 1947. One person, William B. Cassidy, engineer, was involved in the development of pressure suits and space suit. He was in the drop plane making last minute checks on Welch&#x27;s and Yeager&#x27;s suits. In an interview he asserted that because Yeager was a national treasure the Air Force was unwilling to risk his life in breaking the sound barrier and Welch tested the viability before Yeager was permitted to make his flight. 

By the end of 1947, the XP-86 had logged 29 hours and 23 minutes of flight test time, most flown by Welch. On October 14, 1947, Captain Charles Yeager exceeded Mach 1 in the Bell X-1. The claim of the XP-86 passing Mach 1, with Welch at the controls, was not made until April 26, 1948, five and a half months after the X-1 supersonic flight. Blackburn, however, maintains that a record on the Muroc radar theodolite, of the two flights Welch made on November 13, 1947, indicated supersonic flights, as well, noting 20 minutes before the X-1 broke the record, a sonic boom was heard over the desert, centered on the Happy Bottom Riding Club, a dude ranch restaurant and hotel operated by Pancho Barnes.

==Later career and death==
Welch went on to work as chief test pilot, engineer, and instructor with North American Aviation during the Korean War, where he reportedly downed several enemy MiG-15 Fagots while &quot;supervising&quot; his students. Welch&#x27;s kills were in disobedience of direct orders for him not to engage, and credits for the kills were thus distributed among his students.

After the war, Welch returned to flight testing; this time in the F-100 Super Sabre, with Yeager flying the chase plane. Welch became the first man to break the sound barrier in level flight with this type of aircraft on May 25, 1953. Stability problems were encountered in the flight test program, and on Columbus Day, October 12, 1954, Welch&#x27;s F-100A-1-NA Super Sabre, AF Ser. No. 52-5764, disintegrated during a 7-G pullout at Mach 1.55 from 45,000 ft (13,500 m) and crashed in Rosamond Lake in the Mojave Desert about 45 miles (72 km) north of Los Angeles. When he was found, Welch was still in the ejection seat, critically injured. He was evacuated by helicopter, but was pronounced dead on arrival at the United States Air Force Plant 42 hospital. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Film portrayal==
In the 1970 film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, Welch was portrayed by actor Rick Cooper.

===Distinguished Service Cross citation===

:Welch, George S.
:Second Lieutenant, U.S. Army Air Forces
:47th Pursuit Squadron, 18th Pursuit Group, Hawaiian Air Force
:Date of Action: December 7, 1941

:Citation:

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Second Lieutenant (Air Corps) George Schwartz Welch, United States Army Air Forces, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-40 Fighter Airplane in the 47th Pursuit Squadron, 18th Pursuit Group, Hawaiian Air Force, in action over the Island of Oahu, Territory of Hawaii and waters adjacent thereto, on 7 December 1941. When surprised by a heavy air attack by Japanese forces on Wheeler Field and vicinity at approximately 8 a.m., Lieutenant Welch left Wheeler and proceeded by car, under fire, to Haleiwa Landing Field, approximately ten miles distance, where his squadron&#x27;s planes were stationed. Immediately, on his own initiative, he took off for the purpose of attacking invading forces, without first obtaining information as to number or type of Japanese in the attacking force, and proceeded to his initial point over Barbers Point. At time of take off he was armed only with thirty-caliber machine guns. Upon arrival over Barbers Point, he observed a formation of approximately twelve planes over Ewa, about 100 feet below and ten miles away. Accompanied by only one other pursuit ship, he immediately attacked this enemy formation, shooting down an enemy dive bomber with one burst from three .30-caliber guns. At this point one .30 gun jammed. While engaged in this combat, his plane was hit by an incendiary bullet which passed through the baggage compartment just in rear of his seat. He climbed above the clouds, checked his plane, returned to the attack over Barbers Point and immediately attacked a Japanese plane running out to sea, which he shot down, the plane falling in the ocean. No more enemy planes in sight, he proceeded to Wheeler to refuel and replenish ammunition. Refueling and reloading completed but before repairing guns, a second wave of about fifteen enemy planes approached low over Wheeler. Three came at him and he immediately took off, headed straight into the attack and went to the assistance of a brother officer being attacked from the rear. This enemy plane burst into flames and crashed halfway between Wahiawa and Haleiwa. During this combat his plane was struck by three bullets from the rear gun of the ship he was attacking, one striking his motor, one the propeller and one the cowling. This attack wave having disappeared he returned to the vicinity of Ewa and found one enemy plane proceeding seaward, which he pursued and shot down about five miles off shore, immediately thereafter returning to his station at Haleiwa Landing Field. Lieutenant Welch&#x27;s initiative, presence of mind, coolness under fire against overwhelming odds in his first battle, expert maneuvering of his plane, and determined action contributed to a large extent toward driving off this sudden unexpected enemy air attack. Second Lieutenant Welch&#x27;s unquestionable valor in aerial combat is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, the Hawaiian Air Force, and the United States Army Air Forces.

<text>Ostrogski ( – Perl, – white (without chatoyancy)) is a Polish coat of arms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. A variant of the Leliwa and Ogończyk coat of arms.

==History and description==
Traditional Ostrogski coat of arms was described in his work Kasper Niesiecki, while its iconographic representation is seen on the Ostroh Bible. According to Niesiecki the first (oldest) Ostrogski coat of arms was Pogoń Ruska coat of arms where the Saint George pierces a dragon (see Saint George and the Dragon). During the Battle of Vedrosha on 14 July 1500 the Grand Hetman of Lithuania Konstanty Ostrogski was taken a prisoner by the Muscovite forces and later sent to Vologda. Nikolay Karamzin cites that on 18 October 1506 Ostrogski pledged his allegiance to the Grand Prince of Moscow Vasili III as a boyar, confirmed by the Metropolitan of Moscow Simon. Ostrogski was sent then to the Sloboda Ukraine to fight Tatars, but managed to escape and returned to Lithuania in 1507.

After Konstanty Ostrogski returned from the Muscovite captivity he adopted a new coat of arms (his former coat of arms was to similar to that of the Grand Duchy of Moscow). The new coat of arms was created as a mix of Leliwa and Ogończyk coat of arms, in remembrance of his two sons Eliasz (whose wife Beata Kościelecka was of Ogończyk coat of arms) and Konstanty (whose wife Zofia Tarnowska was of Leliwa coat of arms).

According to the &quot;Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms&quot;, the coat of arms for country of Roxia (Ruthenia) was described as a green field with an octagonal star, while its banner consists of two golden half-moons at a silver field pointing with their horns at each other. To the similarity of the description points Roman Klymkevych.

==Notable bearers==

Notable bearers of this coat of arms include:
* Konstanty Ostrogski (Duke, Grand Hetman of Lithuania.)
* Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski (Duke, marshal of Volhynia and voivode of the Kiev Voivodeship.)
* Janusz Ostrogski (Voivode of Volhynian Voivodship and castellan of Kraków.)
* Oleksander Ostrogski (Voivode of the Wolhynian Voivodship.)
* Aleksander Janusz Zasławski-Ostrogski (Last of Dukes Ostrogski-Zasławski.)
* Władysław Dominik Zasławski (Voivode of Sandomierz Voivodship.)

<text>Rear Admiral Sir Richard John Trowbridge, (21 January 1920 – 4 May 2003), was a senior officer in the Royal Navy and the 25th Governor of Western Australia, serving from 25 November 1980 to 24 November 1983. He was the last non-Australian vice-regal representative in Australia. He was also the first officer to rise from boy seaman to captain of the Queen&#x27;s yacht HMY &quot;Britannia&quot;.

==Early life and naval career==
Richard John Trowbridge was born on 21 January 1920 to a farming family at Andover in the county of Hampshire, England. He was educated at Andover Grammar School and was fully expecting to become a farmer until a downturn in agriculture saw him leave school in 1935 at just 15 years of age to join the Royal Navy as a boy seaman. Trowbridge was quickly promoted through the navy ranks, and was commissioned as sub-lieutenant in 1940, serving throughout the Second World War at sea. At the end of hostilities, he was stationed in Singapore for a number of years where he was promoted to commander in 1953, and where he met and married Anne Perceval (1920–2013), on 26 February 1955.

From 1956 to 1958, Trowbridge captained the destroyer in the Mediterranean, and following this served as the second-in-command of the cruiser from 1958 to 1959. He then returned to the gunnery school at Whale Island in Portsmouth, where he was promoted to captain in 1960. From 1962 to 1964 he was captain of the frigate and in charge of the Fishery Protection Squadron, and from 1967 to 1969 he commanded the guided missile destroyer , which for many years was the flagship of the Western Fleet.

Trowbridge became extra equerry to the Queen Elizabeth II in 1970 and he served as Flag Officer from 1970 to 1975.

==Governor of Western Australia==
The Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, in 1975 sought to revive the practice of appointment of British-born governors for Western Australia, contrary to the advice of Lord Goronwy-Roberts, British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, who supported the newly established custom that Australian state governors should be Australian-born. An initial compromise was the appointment of Sir Wallace Kyle, a retired Royal Air Force officer who, although totally Anglicised, was Kalgoorlie-born.

Following Kyle&#x27;s term, Trowbridge was appointed Governor of Western Australia on Premier Court&#x27;s recommendation, for a term from 25 November 1980 to 24 November 1983.

On completion of his term, Trowbridge returned to retirement in the United Kingdom living in Portsmouth. His life was overshadowed by exposure to asbestos which was being removed from Britannia during a long refit which he supervised, almost certainly leading to his death from lung cancer. He died on 4 May 2003, in Portsmouth.

<text>Gordon Stanley Reid (22 September 1923 – 26 October 1989) was an Australian academic who served as the 26th Governor of Western Australia. Born in Hurstville, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, he was educated at Hurstville Boys High School before enlisting in the Royal Australian Air Force, where he served as a flying officer during the Second World War. After the conclusion of the war, Reid studied at the London School of Economics in England, later winning a scholarship to Nuffield College at the University of Oxford. Having obtained his Doctorate of Philosophy, Reid lectured at the University of Adelaide before serving as the vice-chancellor of the University of Western Australia from 1978 to 1982. Appointed governor in 1984, he served in the position until 1989, resigning a month before his death from cancer.

==Early life and education==
Reid was educated at Hurstville Boys High School in New South Wales from 1934 to 1937, then enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1942, reaching the rank of Flying Officer by the time of his discharge in 1946. He met and married his wife, Ruth, in Brighton, England while stationed at RAF Gamston. In his civilian career Reid worked as a reading clerk, accountant and clerk of papers. He was clerk of records for the Australian House of Representatives from 1952 to 1955, and was Serjeant-at-Arms at Parliament House, Canberra while studying for his Commerce degree. He then travelled to England where he obtained his master&#x27;s degree and his Doctor of Philosophy degree at the London School of Economics. He won a Nuffield Scholarship.

==Academic and governor==
Prior to serving as governor in 1984, Professor Reid lectured at the University of Adelaide and served at the University of Western Australia as Vice-Chancellor (1978–1982) and Professor of Politics (1966–1970, 1974–1978, 1983–1984). He was the author and joint author of various books and publications on Australian politics including:

* &quot;The politics of financial control&quot; (1966)
* &quot;Out of the wilderness: the return of Labor&quot; (1974)
* &quot;The Western Australian elections&quot; (1974)
* &quot;The premiers of Western Australia, 1890–1982&quot; (1982)

As part of the Australian parliament&#x27;s bicentenary publications project, Reid, assisted by Martin Forrest, was commissioned to write a history of the parliament.

In 1986, Reid was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).

On 20 August 1989, the Premier, Peter Dowding, announced that Reid had been undergoing extensive surgery for cancer, and would be stepping down as governor. He died shortly after, on 26 October.

<doc id="1066480" wikidata="Q235406" url="?curid=1066480" title="Hilary Hahn">
<text>Hilary Hahn (born November 27, 1979) is an American violinist. A three-time Grammy Award winner, she has played as a soloist with orchestras and conductors, and as a recitalist. Several composers have written works for her, including concerti by Edgar Meyer and Jennifer Higdon, partitas by Antón García Abril, two serenades for violin and orchestra by Einojuhani Rautavaara, and a violin and piano sonata by Lera Auerbach.

==Early life and education==
Hahn was born in Lexington, Virginia, on November 27, 1979, and grew up in the Baltimore, Maryland, area. Her father, Steve Hahn, was a journalist and librarian; her paternal great-grandmother was from Bad Dürkheim in Germany. Her mother, Anne, was an accountant.

A musically precocious child, Hahn began playing the violin one month before her fourth birthday in the Suzuki Program of Baltimore&#x27;s Peabody Institute. She studied using the Suzuki method until age five before studying in Baltimore under Klara Berkovich from 1985 to 1990.

In 1990, at age ten, she was admitted to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied for seven years with Jascha Brodsky, who had been a student of Eugène Ysaÿe. She learned the études of Kreutzer, Ševčík, Gaviniès and Rode, Paganini&#x27;s Caprices, 28 violin concertos, and chamber works and assorted showpieces.

At 16 she completed the Curtis Institute&#x27;s university requirements, but she remained for an additional three years to pursue elective courses until her graduation in May 1999 with a Bachelor of Music degree. During this time she studied violin with Jaime Laredo and studied chamber music with Felix Galimir and Gary Graffman.

She also spent four summers in the total-immersion language programs in German, French, and Japanese at Middlebury College.

==Musical career==
On December 21, 1991, at age 12, Hahn made her major orchestral debut with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Soon thereafter she debuted with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic. She made her international debut in 1994 performing the Bernstein &quot;Serenade&quot; in Hungary with Ivan Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Her German debut came in 1995 with a performance of the Beethoven Violin Concerto with Lorin Maazel and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. The concert was broadcast in Europe.

In 1996, she debuted at Carnegie Hall in New York City as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra, playing Saint-Saens&#x27;s third violin concerto. In a 1999 interview with &quot;Strings Magazine&quot;, she cited people influential to her development as a musician and a student, including David Zinman, the conductor of the Baltimore Symphony and Hahn&#x27;s mentor since she was ten, and Lorin Maazel, with whose Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra she performed in Europe.

Hahn began recording in 1996. Her earlier television appearances include &quot;Mr. Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; in 2000 (episode 1755), where Mr. Rogers visits a local music store and she plays for him. She has released 16 albums on the Deutsche Grammophon and Sony labels, three DVDs, an Oscar-nominated movie soundtrack, an award-winning recording for children, and various compilations. Her recordings often blend newer and traditional pieces. Her albums include pairings of Beethoven with Bernstein, Schoenberg with Sibelius, Brahms with Stravinsky, and Tchaikovsky with Jennifer Higdon.

Hahn has played with orchestras such as the London Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, NHK Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Singapore Symphony Orchestra. In 2007 she debuted with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and played in Vatican City as part of the celebrations for Pope Benedict XVI with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra and conductor Gustavo Dudamel. The concert was recorded and released by Deutsche Grammophon.

She has also performed as a chamber musician. Since 1992 she has performed nearly every year with the Skaneateles Chamber Music Festival in Skaneateles, New York. From 1995 to 2000 she performed and studied chamber music at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont, and in 1996 she was an artist and a member of the chamber music mentoring program of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. In 2004 she toured Saint Petersburg, Russia, with the Poulenc Trio.

Hahn has been interested in cross-genre collaboration and pushing musical boundaries. She began performing and touring in crossover duos with singer-songwriter Josh Ritter in 2007 and with singer-songwriter Tom Brosseau in 2005. She has recorded songs with &quot;…And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead&quot;. In 2012 she released an album with German pianist and composer Hauschka (Volker Bertelmann) titled &quot;Silfra&quot;. The songs on the disc were completely improvised. &quot;Silfra&quot; was produced by Valgeir Sigurðsson. According to her, &quot;Other musicians cross genres all the time. For me it&#x27;s not crossover—I just enter their world. It frees you up to think in a different way from what you&#x27;ve been trained to do.&quot;

In June 2014, Hahn was awarded the &quot;&quot; of the Dresden Music Festival.

Since 2016, she has piloted free concerts for parents with infants, a knitting circle, a community dance workshop, a yoga class, and art students. She plans to continue these community-oriented concerts, encouraging people to combine live performances with their interests outside the concert hall and providing opportunities for parents to hear music with their infants, who might be barred from traditional concerts.

In 2020, Hahn and AI roboticist and tech entrepreneur Carol E. Reiley cofounded DeepMusic.ai to work with artists and AI companies to amplify human creativity.

In August 2022, Classic FM listed Hahn as one of the 25 greatest violinists of all time.

In January 2024 she was awarded the 2024 Avery Fisher Prize.

===Commissioning===
Hahn is a noted champion of new works. In 1999 she commissioned Edgar Meyer to write a concerto. She later recorded the piece with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. In 2010 a concerto written for Hahn by Jennifer Higdon and recorded with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Music.

She commissioned 26 contemporary composers to write short encore pieces for &quot;In 27 Pieces: the Hilary Hahn Encores&quot;. Among the composers are David Del Tredici, Jennifer Higdon, Du Yun, Elliott Sharp, David Lang, Nico Muhly, James Newton Howard, Valentyn Silvestrov, and Max Richter. For the 27th encore she held an open contest that drew more than 400 entries and was won by Jeff Myers. The international premiere tours, from 2011 to 2013, met with wide critical and audience acclaim. In November 2013 these 27 short pieces were released on Deutsche Grammophon. The recording won the Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance.

After playing Einojuhani Rautavaara&#x27;s violin concerto, Hahn commissioned another concerto from Rautavaara, but due to his weak condition the project was thought to be forgotten. But after his death, it was revealed to conductor Mikko Franck, a friend of Rautavaara&#x27;s, that Rautavaara had written two serenades for violin and orchestra. The serenades were premiered on Hahn&#x27;s album &quot;Paris&quot;.

In 2016 and 2017, in recital tours across the U.S., Europe, and Japan, she premiered six new partitas for solo violin by Antón García Abril, her first commissioning project for solo violin, as well as her first commission of a set of works from a single composer. She forged a relationship with García Abril during &quot;In 27 Pieces: the Hilary Hahn Encores&quot;. Digital and physical editions of the complete sheet music for these 27 encores have been released by Boosey &amp; Hawkes. In 2019 Hahn and Lera Auerbach premiered Auerbach&#x27;s sonata for violin and piano &quot;Fractured Dreams&quot;.

===Film music===
Hahn began her film recording career as the soloist for James Newton Howard&#x27;s score for M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;The Village&quot; in 2004. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Her recording of Samuel Barber&#x27;s Violin Concerto was used extensively in &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot;, starring Rachel Weisz and Tom Hiddleston. The film uses the piece&#x27;s second movement to accompany a nine-minute sequence. In 2013, she was the soloist on Andrew Hewitt&#x27;s score for the film &quot;The Sea&quot;.

===On playing Bach===
In 1999 Hahn said that she played Bach more than any other composer and had played solo Bach pieces every day since she was eight.

In a segment on NPR titled &quot;Musicians in Their Own Words&quot;, she spoke about the surreal experience of playing the Bach &quot;Chaconne&quot; (from the Partita for Violin No. 2) alone on the concert stage. In the same segment she discussed her experiences emulating a lark while playing &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; by Ralph Vaughan Williams.

==Instrument==

Her violin is an 1864 copy of Paganini&#x27;s &quot;Cannone&quot; made by Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume. In an interview on Danish television, Hahn said she almost never leaves her instrument out of sight. She uses bows by American bow maker Isaac Salchow. For her strings, she uses Thomastik-Infeld Dominants for the A (aluminum wound), D and G (silver wound) and a Pirastro Gold Label Steel E.

She has also acquired a second Vuillaume, an 1865 model loosely based on the 1715 Alard Stradivarius, and has used both in recent years for recording and performing.

==Journal==
Hahn&#x27;s website includes a section titled &quot;By Hilary.&quot; In a &quot;Strings Magazine&quot; interview, she said that the idea for her &quot;Postcards from the Road&quot; feature originated during an outreach visit to a third-grade class in upstate New York. The class was doing a geography project in which the students asked everyone they knew who was traveling to send postcards from the cities they were visiting to learn more about the world. She decided to participate after receiving a positive reaction to her suggestion that she take part. She enjoyed her first year&#x27;s experience with the project so much that she decided to continue it on her new website. A few years later she expanded the postcards to a journal format. Journal entries usually include photographs from her tours and rehearsals.

==Personal life==
Since 2016, Hahn and her husband have lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after having lived in New York City for several years. They have two daughters.

<text>Sir Francis Theodore Page Burt (14 June 1918 – 8 September 2004) was an Australian jurist who served as the 11th Chief Justice of Western Australia, from 1977 to 1988, and the 27th Governor of Western Australia, from 1990 to 1993.

Burt was born in Cottesloe, a suburb of Perth Western Australia, and educated at Guildford Grammar School. He studied law at the University of Western Australia, and also served in the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force during the Second World War. Burt was made a justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in 1969, and was promoted to Chief Justice in 1977. As Chief Justice, he served as lieutenant-governor. When the Governor of Western Australia, Gordon Reid, resigned in 1989, Burt was appointed to succeed him and served as governor until 1993.

==Biography==
Born in Mosman Park, Western Australia, Burt&#x27;s great-grandfather, Sir Archibald Burt, was Chief Justice of Western Australia from 1861 to 1879, while his grandfather, Septimus Burt, was Attorney-General and Agent-General when responsible government was granted to Western Australia in December 1890. Archibald Burt had been a slaveholder in the West Indies. Burt was educated at Guildford Grammar School and later studied law at the University of Western Australia. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force.

After being admitted to the Bar in 1941, Burt gained his skills as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1959, and in 1961 founded the independent Bar in Western Australia. With others, he established Bar Chambers in 1962. He was appointed as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in 1969, a position he held until 1977 when he was promoted to Chief Justice of Western Australia. He retired in 1988.

Burt was afforded a state funeral on his death in 2004. He is buried at Karrakatta Cemetery. The Francis Burt Chambers located in Allendale Square, Perth, and the Francis Burt Law Education Centre and Museum in Stirling Gardens are both named in his honour.

<text>James Noble Allan (November 13, 1894 – May 9, 1992) was a Canadian politician in Ontario. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1951 to 1975. He represented the riding of Haldimand—Norfolk. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of Leslie Frost.

==Background==
Allan was the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Canada in the Province of Ontario for the years 1966 and 1967. He also held a Bachelor of Science degree. He died in 1992 at the Haldimand War Memorial Hospital.

==Politics==
Allan served as Mayor of Dunnville and Warden of Haldimand County along with various other municipal posts.

In the 1951 provincial election, Allan ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the riding of Haldimand—Norfolk. He defeated Liberal Elmo Riddle by 2,455 votes. He was re-elected five more times before losing to Liberal Gord Miller in 1975.

In 1955, he was appointed by Ontario Premier Leslie Frost to the cabinet as Minister of Highways. At the time, this was the government&#x27;s largest department, and Allan oversaw a budget of $200 million. He was in charge of 8,000 employees. During his term, 10,000 miles of highways were built.

In 1958, Allan became Frost&#x27;s finance minister, and introduced the province&#x27;s first sales tax, nicknamed the &quot;Frost bite&quot; at a rate of 3%. When Frost retired, Allan ran in the 1961 PC leadership convention, placing fourth.

Allan had the title of Treasurer in the new cabinet of John Robarts until 1966 when he entered semi-retirement at the age of 71 and became a minister without portfolio. He was the last Ontario finance minister to report a budget surplus until the late 1990s. He retired from cabinet altogether in 1968, although he kept his seat in the legislature until retiring from politics altogether following his defeat in the 1975 election.

From 1967 until 1988, Allan served as Chair of the Niagara Parks Commission. On his 90th birthday the Burlington Skyway Bridge was officially renamed the &quot;Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway&quot;.

<text>Anthony Stephen Burke (born 4 November 1969) is an Australian politician serving as Leader of the House, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for the Arts. He is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), and has served as member of parliament (MP) for Watson since 2004. He held cabinet positions in the governments of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard from 2007 to 2013.

Burke is a graduate of the University of Sydney, and worked as a political staffer, company director, and union organiser before entering politics. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 2003, but resigned the following year to enter federal politics. He was included in the shadow ministry immediately after winning a seat at the 2004 election. During the first Rudd government, Burke held the position of Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, before being given the role of Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water and Population in the Gillard government, after Gillard replaced Rudd as prime minister. In June 2013, Rudd would in turn replace Gillard as prime minister, and appointed Burke as the Minister for the Arts and Minister for Immigration, Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship in his subsequent government. He held these positions for less than three months, as Labor was defeated in the 2013 federal election.

In opposition, Burke served as the Manager of Opposition Business under Bill Shorten and Anthony Albanese, and held various positions in the shadow cabinet. After Labor&#x27;s victory in the 2022 election, Burke would become Leader of the House, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for the Arts in the Albanese government.

==Early life==
Burke was raised in a Catholic family of Irish descent. He attended Catholic schools, Regina Coeli (Beverly Hills, NSW) and St Patrick&#x27;s College (Strathfield, NSW), where he was Vice-Captain. He attended the University of Sydney where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws. He was also awarded the Martin Sorensen Trophy for Best Speaker at the 1994 Australasian Intervarsity Debating Championships.

From 1993 to 1995, Burke worked as a staffer to Labor senators Graham Richardson and Michael Forshaw. In 1996, he and two friends from his university debating society established Atticus Pty Ltd., a business that provides training for &quot;clients from the corporate and education sectors in advocacy and communication skills&quot;. It was named after the iconic fictional character Atticus Finch from the novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. He resigned his directorship of the company the following year to join the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees&#x27; Association (SDA) as a union organiser. He left the SDA in 2003 to run for the New South Wales Legislative Council.

==State politics==
At the 2003 state election, Burke was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council. He chaired the NSW State Development Committee, conducting inquiries into ports infrastructure and science commercialisation. A view was gradually formed that his talents were being wasted in the New South Wales Legislative Council and he resigned from state parliament on 24 June 2004 to campaign for the New South Wales division of Watson. He won the seat at the 2004 federal election.

==Federal politics==
A member of Labor Right, Burke was elected to the House of Representatives at the 2004 federal election, replacing the retiring Leo McLeay in the safe Labor seat of Watson. He and fellow Labor MP Linda Burney are the only members of the Federal Parliament to have always served as a minister or shadow minister. He was immediately promoted to the shadow ministry under Mark Latham, as Shadow Minister for Small Business. He was promoted to Shadow Minister for Immigration in June 2005, by which time Kim Beazley had replaced Latham as leader. After the 2006 leadership spill, the new leader Kevin Rudd expanded Burke&#x27;s portfolio to Immigration, Integration and Citizenship.

===Rudd and Gillard governments===

After the 2007 federal election, Burke was appointed Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the new Rudd government. He was sworn in by the Governor-General on 3 December 2007. Burke oversaw the abolition of the Australian bulk wheat export monopoly after the AWB oil-for-wheat scandal. He oversaw the eradication of the horse flu in Australia after the 2007 equine influenza outbreak.

On 2 April 2010, Rudd appointed Burke as Minister for Population. The appointment came after Rudd stated he was in favour of a &quot;big Australia&quot; in response to demographic projections in the Government&#x27;s Intergenerational Report showing the population of Australia would increase from 22 million in 2010 to 35 million in 2050. Burke&#x27;s responsibilities included planning for the growth in Australia&#x27;s population and coordinating the provision of services accordingly.

Following the 2010 federal election, Burke was appointed Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. In March 2012, following the ALP leadership spill, Burke was also appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council.

As Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Burke established the Commonwealth Marine Reserve Network, the largest network of marine protected areas anywhere in the World and the world&#x27;s second largest conservation determination after the preservation of Antarctica.

Burke also added koalas to the threatened species list in Queensland, NSW and the ACT. He also placed a ban on a controversial Dutch &quot;super trawler&quot; fishing vessel operating in waters off Tasmania.

He acted as a mediator in the long-running dispute between environmental groups and the Tasmanian forestry industry, culminating in the signing of the historic Tasmanian Forests Intergovernmental Agreement in 2011.

Burke often cites Labor&#x27;s environmental credentials and the campaign to protect the Daintree Rainforest as the reason he got involved in politics. In government, Burke pushed to protect large areas of the Tasmanian Wilderness and the Ningaloo Reef by having them listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2014, the Abbott government’s application to undo Burke&#x27;s Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage listing was rejected by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. The Portuguese delegation called the delisting attempt &quot;feeble&quot;.

In early 2011, Burke gave approval for the 100 per cent plantation timber Bell Bay Pulp Mill in the Tamar Valley after imposing stricter environmental conditions on the applicant Gunns Limited. Burke said many of the demands made by environmental groups opposed to the development had been addressed.

On 22 November 2012, Burke developed, negotiated and signed into law the Murray Darling Basin Plan, a process more than 100 years in the making, after extensive consultation with irrigators, environmental groups and state governments.

On 25 March 2013, Burke was appointed Minister for the Arts in the Second Gillard Ministry, in addition to his existing responsibilities. Burke took over the implementation of the Gillard government&#x27;s Creative Australia policy after the former Minister for the Arts, Simon Crean, was sacked for his involvement in a failed attempt to return Kevin Rudd to the prime ministership. Following the June 2013 Labor leadership spill, which saw Gillard lose the Labor leadership, Rudd rejected Burke&#x27;s offer to resign from the ministry. Burke, a Gillard supporter, had been critical of Rudd&#x27;s performance during his previous tenure.

Rudd subsequently appointed Burke as Minister for Immigration, Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship in the Second Rudd Ministry. In this role he oversaw Rudd&#x27;s resettlement plans with Papua New Guinea and Nauru, which saw an immediate and dramatic reduction in the number of people arriving by boat. During his short time as Minister for Immigration he also sought to release every unaccompanied minor who was in immigration detention.

===Opposition (2013–2022)===
Following Labor&#x27;s 2013 election loss, Burke was appointed Shadow Finance Minister and Manager of Opposition Business.

After the 2016 federal election, Burke was appointed Shadow Minister for Environment and Water, Shadow Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Australia, Shadow Minister for the Arts, in addition to his duties as the Manager of Opposition Business.

In 2019, he became Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, ending his roles in Environment and Water, and Citizenship and Multicultural Australia, but retaining the Arts.

===Albanese government (2022–present)===
Following the 2022 federal election, Burke was appointed Leader of the House, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for the Arts in the Albanese ministry.

On 28 July 2024 it was announced that Burke would become the Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, in addition to continuing as the Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House, but would leave the role of Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations for Murray Watt.

==Other political issues==
===Death penalty===
While in opposition, Burke led an unsuccessful bipartisan appeal for clemency to the Singapore High Commissioner to stop the execution of convicted Australian drug smuggler, Van Tuong Nguyen. Seven years after Nguyen was executed Burke spoke at the launch of the SBS &quot;Better Man&quot; miniseries about Nguyen&#x27;s case. At the launch, Burke referred to the meeting with the Singapore High Commissioner as &quot;the worst day&quot; of his political career and &quot;potentially the most troubling day&quot; of his life.

===Racial Discrimination Act===
Burke has been a vocal opponent of the Liberal National government&#x27;s attempts to repeal Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. In May 2014, Burke held a march against the changes to Section 18C in the Sydney suburb of Lakemba. The event was attended by more than 1,000 people protesting against the changes, which were subsequently dropped by the Abbott government.

The &quot;Walk for Respect&quot; was held again in 2017 in Lakemba when the Turnbull government again sought to remove certain protections against speech potentially considered to be racially offensive. The Walk was held on the same day the senate rejected the government amendments, this time with 3000 in attendance.

===Euthanasia===
Burke is opposed to the legalisation of euthanasia. He has said his opposition stems from the case of a friend who was incorrectly diagnosed with a terminal illness. In the 1990s, Burke served as the executive director of Euthanasia No!, a group that lobbied state and federal governments against altering the &quot;status quo&quot; on euthanasia. In 1996, he and a pro-euthanasia campaigner, Peter Baume, were invited to address the New South Wales Legislative Assembly before a debate on the subject, one of only a handful of occasions on which non-MPs have been invited to speak in parliament. He was later tasked with lobbying Labor senators to vote for what became the &quot;Euthanasia Laws Act 1997&quot;, which voided the Northern Territory&#x27;s euthanasia laws.

===Same-sex marriage===
Burke publicly announced his support of marriage equality in May 2015, and voted in favour of the &quot;Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017&quot;. He had previously voted against the &quot;Marriage Amendment Bill 2012&quot;, citing opposition within his constituency. His division had the second-highest percentage of &quot;No&quot; responses in the 2017 Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, with 69.64% of the electorate&#x27;s respondents to the survey responding &quot;No&quot;.

==Personal life==
Burke married Cathy Bresnan in 1994; after commencing their relationship in 1989. She subsequently took the surname &quot;Bresnan-Burke&quot;. The couple had three daughters together, but separated at the end of December 2012, the separation was not disclosed until the completion of the Federal Election in September 2013. In February 2014, &quot;The Australian&quot; reported that Burke had recently commenced a relationship with Skye Laris, his former chief of staff. Burke and Laris married in December 2015.

He is also known for his love of music and keeps musical instruments in his Parliament House office.

Burke has coeliac disease.

<text>Andrew John Robb (born 20 August 1951) is an Australian former politician. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 2004 to 2016, representing the Liberal Party. He served as Minister for Trade and Investment (2013–2016) in the Abbott and Turnbull governments, and also briefly as Minister for Vocational and Further Education in the Howard government in 2007. Before entering parliament, he was the federal director of the Liberal Party and oversaw the party&#x27;s return to government at the 1996 federal election.

While he was Minister for Trade and Investment, Robb approved Chinese company Shandong Landbridge Group to lease Port Darwin for 99 years. As soon as he left politics, Robb was hired by Shandong Landbridge on a $880,000 per year salary. In 2019, Robb left the position, shortly before a new foreign-interference law took effect.

==Background==

Robb, one of nine children, was born to Frank and Marie Robb, on a dairy farm in Epping which lies north of Melbourne. He was educated at Dookie Agricultural College, Parade College and La Trobe University, and has qualifications in economics and agricultural science. He was an agricultural economist with the Victorian Department of Agriculture and a tutor in economics at La Trobe University before being an economist for the National Farmers&#x27; Federation, and later executive director of both the National Farmers&#x27; Federation and the Cattle Council of Australia.

==Liberal Party federal director==

Robb became deputy director of the Liberal Party before being appointed chief of staff to Andrew Peacock, then Leader of the Opposition, in 1989. In 1990, after Andrew Peacock&#x27;s resignation after his election defeat, Robb was appointed federal director of the Liberal Party.

In this capacity Robb worked with the next Leader of the Liberal Party, John Hewson, in the unsuccessful 1993 federal election campaign. Robb claimed in 1991 that Peter Reith and Hewson were spooked into releasing their policies too early. Robb was still federal director when internal Liberal party negative polling was leaked to Kerry O&#x27;Brien on Lateline in May 1994 who embarrassed John Hewson with it and lead to Hewson&#x27;s calling a leadership spill where he lost the leadership to Alexander Downer.
Robb and Hewson were not on good terms following this. 
Robb was still Federal Director and campaign manager in 1996 when John Howard after he replaced Downer as leader in 1995, won the 1996 federal election campaign, which defeated the Keating government and brought the Liberals to power after 13 years in Opposition.
Howard had to be talked out of dumping Andrew in 1995 from his position as Federal director.

==Professional career==

Robb resigned in 1997 (he was replaced by Lynton Crosby) and became a business consultant based in Sydney. He was Honorary Finance Director for the NSW Division of the Liberal Party and a member of the NSW State Executive. In that time Robb also sat on the boards of numerous Australian companies including Australia&#x27;s largest consulting engineering company, Sinclair Knight Merz. Robb was also a board member of community organisations including the Garvan Medical Research Foundation and the &#x27;Big Brothers Big Sisters&#x27; organisation. In 2003, Robb was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for service to politics, agriculture and the community.

==Parliamentary career==

===Howard government===
In 2004, he was comfortably elected to the safe Liberal seat of Goldstein in Melbourne and was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on 27 January 2006. His time in this portfolio was marked by introducing a Citizenship discussion paper which encouraged public debate about whether Australia required a formal citizenship test. Robb argued that a formal citizenship test would be a clear incentive for aspiring citizens to have basic English language skills and understanding of their community. Robb also focused on dealing with settlement issues for refugees and the challenges of multi-faith relations in Australia.

In 2007, Robb was elevated to the Ministry and took on the role as Minister for Vocational and Further Education. Following the Liberal Party&#x27;s defeat at the 2007 federal election, Robb put himself forward as a candidate for Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. In a ballot of Liberal caucus members, Julie Bishop prevailed with 44 votes, ahead of Robb who won 25 votes and Christopher Pyne with 18 votes. The then leader of the Liberal Party, former Defence Minister, Brendan Nelson, announced that Robb would be Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs in the new Coalition Shadow Cabinet.

Following a front-bench re-shuffle in March 2010, Robb was appointed Shadow Minister for Finance, Deregulation and Debt Reduction, a post previously held by Nationals Senator Barnaby Joyce, and chairman of the Coalition Policy Development Committee. He was re-elected at the 2010 election and was appointed Shadow Minister for Finance, Deregulation and Debt Reduction and retained his position as chairman of the Coalition Policy Development Committee.

Robb is a republican; he is against abortion except where the health and state of the mother are in serious threat.

Robb is also the co-publisher of &quot;The Party Room&quot; alongside Senator Mitch Fifield, a journal designed to promote new policy discussion within the Federal Coalition.

===Abbott and Turnbull governments===

Following the election of the Abbott government in 2013, Robb was appointed Minister for Trade and Investment. He had carriage of final negotiations for the Australia–Korea Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA), Japan–Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, China–Australia Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership which have concluded by the federal government.

Robb announced his retirement from politics on 10 February 2016. He was succeeded by Steven Ciobo as Minister of Trade and Investment on 18 February 2016.

==Career after politics==
Robb is a board member of the Kidman cattle enterprise and the Network Ten television station. He is the Chairman of Asialink and CNSDose, and a strategic advisor to Beef Innovations Australia, as well as a range of national and international businesses.

In October 2016, it was announced that Robb had joined the Landbridge Group, a Chinese company which had been granted a 99-year lease on Port Darwin in October 2015, as a &quot;high-level economic consultant&quot;. It was reported that Robb had accepted the $73,000 per month position before leaving Parliament. Landbridge Group is chaired by Ye Cheng, a billionaire with links to the Chinese Communist Party. Robb&#x27;s employment with Landbridge Group ended in 2018. Robb attributed his departure to an atmosphere increasingly critical of the Chinese government; it was also noted that had he remained in the position he would have had to register as a foreign agent, due to changes in legislation enacted in 2019.

Robb is part owner of The Boathouse Group, which operates a number of Sydney restaurants and other venues. Another Robb entity is facing (in mid 2019) a wind-up motion from the Commissioner of Taxation over unpaid taxes.

As of 2020, Robb serves as a director on the board of Mind Medicine Australia, a not-for-profit organisation which promotes the introduction of psychedelic treatments for mental illnesses.

==Personal life==
During 2009 Laurie Oakes&#x27;s column in &quot;The Australian&quot;, Robb disclosed that he was stepping down from the opposition front bench for three months to address a form of depression brought on by diurnal variation, which is typically experienced as positive mood variation (mood being worse upon waking and better in the evening). Robb disclosed that, since adolescence, he had suffered depression for several hours each day in the morning.

The following week, Robb said in an interview with 3AW&#x27;s Neil Mitchell that he had found &quot;doing things increasingly more difficult, I could be taking on more responsibilities especially in a public sense and decided to confront it a few weeks ago. Rang Jeff Kennett and within three days he had me in front one of the best professionals in the state and this guy said you know you&#x27;ve had a problem for fifty years, you&#x27;ve had it for fifty years but he said it was fixable, which was fantastic.&quot;

<text>Boston Harbor is a natural harbor and estuary of Massachusetts Bay, located adjacent to Boston, Massachusetts. It is home to the Port of Boston, a major shipping facility in the Northeastern United States.

==History==
Since its discovery to Europeans by John Smith in 1614, Boston Harbor has been an important port in American history. Early on, it was recognized by Europeans as one of the finest natural harbors in the world due to its depth and natural defense from the Atlantic as a result of the many islands that dot the harbor. It was also favored due to its access to the Charles River, Neponset River and Mystic River which made travel from the harbor deeper into Massachusetts far easier. It was the site of the Boston Tea Party in 1773, as well as almost continuous building of wharves, piers, and new filled land into the harbor until the 19th century. By 1660, almost all imports came to the greater Boston area and the New England coast through the waters of Boston Harbor. A rapid influx of people transformed Boston into an exploding city.

==Pollution and cleanup efforts==
The health of the harbor quickly deteriorated as the population of Boston increased. As early as the late 19th century Boston citizens were advised not to swim in any portion of the Harbor. In the 19th century, two of the first steam sewage stations were built (one in East Boston and one later on Deer Island). With these mandates, the harbor was seeing small improvements, but raw sewage was still continuously pumped into the harbor. In 1919, the Metropolitan District Commission was created to oversee and regulate the quality of harbor water. However, not much improvement was seen and general public awareness of the poor quality of water was very low. In 1972, the Clean Water Act was passed in order to help promote increased national water quality.

Since the mid-1970s organizations within the Boston community have battled for a cleaner Boston Harbor. More recently, the harbor was the site of the $4.5 billion Boston Harbor Project. Failures at the Nut Island sewage treatment plant in Quincy and the companion Deer Island plant adjacent to Winthrop had far-reaching environmental and political effects. Fecal coliform bacteria levels forced frequent swimming prohibitions along the harbor beaches and the Charles River for many years. The city of Quincy sued the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) and the separate Boston Water and Sewer Commission in 1982, charging that unchecked systemic pollution of the city&#x27;s waterfront contributed to the problem. That suit was followed by one by Conservation Law Foundation and finally by the United States government, resulting in the landmark court-ordered cleanup of Boston Harbor.

The lawsuits forced then-Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis to propose separating the water and sewer treatment divisions from the MDC, resulting in the creation of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority in 1985. The slow progress of the cleanup became a key theme of the 1988 U.S. presidential election as George H. W. Bush defeated Dukakis partly through campaign speeches casting doubt on the governor&#x27;s environmental record, which Dukakis himself had claimed was better than that of Bush. The court-ordered cleanup continued throughout the next two decades and is still ongoing.

Before the clean-up projects, the water was so polluted that The Standells released a song in 1965 called &quot;Dirty Water&quot; which referred to the sorry state of the Charles River. Neal Stephenson, who attended Boston University from 1977 to 1981, based his second novel, &quot;Zodiac&quot;, around pollution of the harbor.

Since the writing of the song, the water quality in both the Harbor and the Charles River has significantly improved, and the projects have dramatically transformed Boston Harbor from one of the filthiest in the nation to one of the cleanest. Today, Boston Harbor is safe for fishing and for swimming nearly every day, though there are still beach closings after even small rainstorms, caused by bacteria-laden storm water and the occasional combined sewer overflow.

In 2022, pieces of plastic transmission line used in rock explosives, (known as explosive shock tubing) began washing up on coastal shores of Cape Cod and Rhode Island. This led to an investigation that was conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, it was suspected to have been related to a concluded Boston Harbor dredging project. The outcome was to seek to find methods to prevent future environmental impacts from reoccurring.

==Geography==

Boston Harbor is a large harbor which constitutes the western extremity of Massachusetts Bay. The harbor is sheltered from Massachusetts Bay and the open Atlantic Ocean by a combination of the Winthrop Peninsula and Deer Island to the north, the hooked Nantasket Peninsula and Point Allerton to the south, and the harbor islands in the middle. The harbor is often described as being split into an inner harbor and an outer harbor. The harbor itself comprises with of shoreline and 34 harbor islands.

===Inner harbor===
The inner harbor was historically the main port of Boston and is still the site of most of its port facilities as well as the Boston waterfront, which has been redeveloped for residential and recreational uses. The inner harbor extends from the mouths of the Charles River and the Mystic River, both of which empty into the harbor, to Logan International Airport and Castle Island, the latter now connected by land in 1928 to Boston, where the inner harbor meets the outer harbor.

===Outer harbor===
The outer harbor stretches to the south and east of the inner harbor. To its landward side, and moving in a counterclockwise direction, the harbor is made up of the three small bays of Dorchester Bay, Quincy Bay and Hingham Bay. To seaward, the two deep water anchorages of President Roads and Nantasket Roads are separated by Long Island. The outer harbor is fed by several rivers, including the Neponset River, the Weymouth Fore River, the Weymouth Back River and the Weir River.

Dredged deepwater channels stretch from President Roads to the inner harbor, and from Nantasket Roads to the Weymouth Fore River and Hingham Bay via Hull Gut and West Gut. Some commercial port facilities are located in the Fore River area, an area which has a history of shipbuilding including the notable Fore River Shipyard.

===Land fill===
In the 1830s, members of the maritime community observed physical decay in the harbor. Islands in the outer harbor were visibly deteriorating and erosion was causing weathered materials and sediment to move from where it was protecting the harbor to where it would do the most harm. Recent shoaling experiences and comparisons with old charts caused observers to insist that the inner harbor was also filling and created widespread anxiety about the destruction of the Boston Harbor. Although the scientific understanding of hydraulics was still in its infancy and there were high degrees of uncertainty regarding the meeting of land and water, scientists and engineers began to describe the Boston Harbor as a series of channels created and maintained by the scouring force of water moving in and out of the harbor, river systems, and tidal reservoirs. This interpretation came to be known as the theory of Tidal scour. This understanding of the harbor as a dynamic landscape assuaged concerns some had over the negative impacts of land fill operations of land and real estate developers.

As the 19th century progressed, the acceleration of urban growth dramatically increased the need for more land. The Ordinance of 1641 extended the property rights of riparian owners from the line of &quot;low tide&quot; to a maximum distance of from the line of high tide. Generally, other states drew the line of private property at &quot;high tide.&quot; However, extending shore lines into bordering bodies of water was not unique to Boston. Chicago built into Lake Michigan, New York extended itself into the Hudson and East rivers, and San Francisco reclaimed sections of its bay. The Boston Harbor&#x27;s unique geography inspired the law that made land reclamation such a widespread activity in Boston. By the end of the nineteenth century, the city had created more land in two generations than it had in the previous two centuries.

===Harbor Islands===
Boston Harbor contains a considerable number of islands, 34 of which have been part of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area since its establishment in 1996. The following islands exist within the harbor, or just outside it in Massachusetts Bay:
* Bumpkin Island
* Button Island
* Calf Island
* Castle Island
* Deer Island
* Gallops Island
* Georges Island
* Grape Island
* Great Brewster Island
* Green Island
* Hangman Island
* Langlee Island
* Little Brewster Island
* Little Calf Island
* Long Island
* Lovells Island
* Middle Brewster Island
* Moon Island
* Nixes Mate
* Outer Brewster Island
* Peddocks Island
* Raccoon Island
* Ragged Island
* Rainsford Island
* Sarah Island
* Shag Rocks
* Sheep Island
* Slate Island
* Snake Island
* Spectacle Island
* Spinnaker Island
* The Graves
* Thompson Island

Two former islands, Castle Island and Deer Island, still exist in a recognizable form. Castle Island was joined to the mainland by land reclamation, while Deer Island ceased to be an island when the channel which formerly separated it from the mainland was filled in by the New England Hurricane of 1938.

Nut Island is a small former island in Boston Harbor that was joined by landfill to the Houghs Neck peninsula in northeastern Quincy by the 1940s so it could be used as the site of a sewage treatment facility.

Two other former islands, Apple Island and Governors Island, have been subsumed into land reclamation for Logan International Airport.

The Harbor Islands have made up Boston&#x27;s least populated electoral area, Ward 1, Precinct 15, since 1990, though the polling place is on the mainland at Columbia Point. Since 1920, Boston must pass legislation to redistrict. As of 2018, there were two active voters, staff at the Thompson Island Outward Bound Educational Center. There were previously registered voters at a recovery center and a homeless shelter on Long Island, but few voted and they have closed.

===Aquaculture===
In 1996, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that Mayor Thomas Menino and MIT engineer Clifford Goudey were planning a program to use the great tanks on Moon Island as a fish farm or a temporary home for tuna or lobster in an attempt to implement a recirculating aquaculture system in Boston Harbor. The prices of both these fish types vary by season. The plan was to collect and store fish in the tanks and sell the fish at higher prices when they were out of season. Nothing has come of this plan to date.

<doc id="1066565" wikidata="Q16841384" url="?curid=1066565" title="Hans and Franz">
<text>Hans and Franz are characters in a recurring sketch called &quot;Pumping Up with Hans &amp; Franz&quot; on the television sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, played by Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon, respectively.

==Description==
In the sketch, Carvey and Nealon play a pair of muscle-bound Austrian bodybuilders in the mold of Arnold Schwarzenegger, using padding for fake muscles, drab gray sweatsuits, weight belts, and speaking with Austrian accents. The background of the set includes several life-sized cutouts of Schwarzenegger during his competition years. The sketch&#x27;s introductory and ending music featured mock Austrian yodeling.

&quot;Pumping Up&quot; primarily consists of Hans and Franz denigrating others for not being strong and as physically fit as they appear to be, striking bodybuilder poses to show off their &quot;muscled&quot; bodies, complete with strained facial expressions. Schwarzenegger made one guest appearance in the sketch (to much applause) in which he ridicules &quot;his cousins&quot; for being &quot;girlie&quot; and weak. Another sketch was done in response to recent sports news, where a &quot;&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; editorial&quot; showed Hans and Franz barking back at a recent remark by Jimmy the Greek that African men were more apt to be muscular than European men.

One sketch that did not have the pair in their signature sweatsuits and leather belts was a Halloween episode. Hans and Franz both dressed up as their idol, Arnold Schwarzenegger, with Hans as the titular character from the first &quot;Terminator&quot; film and Franz as the T-800 from &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. The two compared how their Terminators were tougher, then derided other &quot;girlie&quot; costumes, even a boy who was Superman. Rather than hand out high sugar candy, Hans and Franz gave &quot;treats&quot; of Vitamin C pills, coconut oil, and bee pollen to encourage kids to stay in shape.

==Development==

The idea for the characters of Hans and Franz came in 1987 in a Des Moines, Iowa, hotel room while Nealon was watching an Arnold Schwarzenegger television interview during Nealon&#x27;s and Carvey&#x27;s first comedy tour. The first sketch in which the characters appear occurred during the season premiere of the 13th season.

==Other appearances==

After Carvey left the show, the sketch was retired. However, a 1994 episode where Carvey hosted had Hans and Franz appearing as guest commentators as &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, with the pair mentioning they took some time off and were dismayed at the show&#x27;s crew for dismantling their set. Franz also considered the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; sketches were not good since they replaced the past anchor (also played by Kevin Nealon).

A short sketch was filmed for the show&#x27;s 1999 primetime &quot;25th Anniversary Special&quot; which spoofed VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; specials, but time constraints prevented it from airing. It appeared in a later episode that season. In the sketch, Hans and Franz tell the story of how they were reunited in Hollywood when Franz unsuspectingly had his buttocks &quot;read&quot; by Hans.

In 2014, the duo appeared in several State Farm commercials with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

==Proposed film==

Starting in the early 1990s, a Hans and Franz film was in development, with the working title &quot;Hans and Franz Go to Hollywood&quot;. In a 2010 interview on &quot;Conan&quot;, Nealon and host Conan O&#x27;Brien discussed being holed up in a Santa Monica hotel room for a month with Carvey and Robert Smigel working on the script for what was then intended to be a musical. Carvey discussed the script under the title &quot;Hans and Franz: The Girlyman Dilemma&quot; during a 2016 interview with Howard Stern. Schwarzenegger expressed an interest and was at one point set to co-produce, but ultimately declined to participate following the poor reception of his self-parodying vehicle &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;. The disastrous box office performances of the &quot;SNL&quot; spinoff movies &quot;Stuart Saves His Family&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; likely hurt the film&#x27;s prospects, but Schwarzenegger dropping out proved an insurmountable obstacle.

Scenes from the script were acted out on O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s podcast &quot;Conan O&#x27;Brien Needs a Friend&quot; in May 2023.

==Cultural references==
NASA&#x27;s two crawler-transporters—large diesel-powered transport devices used since 1965 to carry heavy launch loads to the launch site, including fully assembled spacecraft from the Apollo, Skylab, and Shuttle eras—are also nicknamed &quot;Hans&quot; (CT-1) and &quot;Franz&quot; (CT-2).

In the popular MMO &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, Hans&#x27;gar and Franzok are twin brothers in the Blackrock Foundry raid. With a throwback to the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; characters, Franzok can be heard yelling &quot;Hear me now and believe me later!&quot;

In &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Season 38 Episode 5, Hansel and Gretel introduce themselves and reference the Hans and Franz tagline &quot;We just want to pump...you up!&quot; changed to &quot;We just want to throw...bread crumbs!&quot;

German supermodel Heidi Klum nicknamed her breasts Hans and Franz. However, given the differing nationalities (Klum is German and Franz and Hans are Austrian), it has never been confirmed if this was in homage to the &quot;SNL&quot; sketch, nor has she made mention as such.

<doc id="1066567" wikidata="Q365574" url="?curid=1066567" title="Nikolai Medtner">
<text>Nikolai Karlovich Medtner (; –13 November 1951) was a Russian composer and pianist. After a period of comparative obscurity in the 25 years immediately after his death, he is now becoming recognized as one of the most significant Russian composers for the piano.

A younger contemporary of Sergei Rachmaninoff and Alexander Scriabin, he wrote a substantial number of compositions, all of which include the piano. His works include 14 piano sonatas, three violin sonatas, three piano concerti, a piano quintet, two works for two pianos, many shorter piano pieces, a few shorter works for violin and piano, and 108 songs including two substantial works for vocalise. His 38 &quot;Skazki&quot; (generally known as &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; in English but more correctly translated as &quot;Tales&quot;) for piano solo contain some of his most original music.

== Biography ==
Nikolai Medtner was born in Moscow on 24 December 1879, according to the Julian calendar, or 5 January 1880 by the Gregorian calendar. He was the son of Karl Petrovich Medtner (1846–1921) and Alexandra Karlovna Goedicke (1843–1918), and the fifth of their six children.

Medtner took piano lessons from his mother until the age of ten. He also had lessons from his mother&#x27;s brother, Fyodor Goedicke (the father of his more famous cousin Alexander Goedicke). He entered the Moscow Conservatory in 1891, and graduated nine years later in 1900, at the age of 20, receiving the Anton Rubinstein prize, having studied under Pavel Pabst, Wassily Sapellnikoff, Vasily Safonov and Sergei Taneyev among others. Despite his conservative musical tastes, Medtner&#x27;s compositions and his pianism were highly regarded by his contemporaries.

With the support of Taneyev, Medtner rejected a career as a performer and turned to composition, partly inspired by Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s late piano sonatas and string quartets. His composing career began professionally in 1903, when he started publishing his music, and it began to be performed. With the publication of his First Piano Sonata in F minor, he was noticed by Sergei Rachmaninoff, who would remain a friend of Medtner&#x27;s throughout his life, as well as a supporter of his composing. Among his students in that period was Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov.

During the years leading up to the 1917 Russian Revolution, Medtner lived at home with his parents. During that time, he fell in love with Anna Mikhaylovna Bratenskaya (1877–1965), a respected violinist and the young wife of his older brother Emil. Later, when World War I broke out, Emil was interned in Germany where he had been studying. He generously gave Anna the freedom to marry his brother, and Medtner and Anna were married in 1918.

Unlike Rachmaninoff, Medtner did not leave Russia until well after the Revolution. Rachmaninoff secured him a tour of the United States and Canada in 1924, and his recitals were often all-Medtner evenings, consisting of sonatas interspersed with songs and shorter pieces. He never adapted himself to the commercial aspects of touring and his concerts became infrequent. Esteemed in England, he and Anna settled in London in 1936, modestly teaching, playing and composing, to a strict daily routine.

At the outbreak of World War II, Medtner&#x27;s income from German publishers disappeared and, during that hardship, ill-health became an increasing problem. His devoted pupil, Edna Iles, gave him shelter in Warwickshire, where he completed his Third Piano Concerto, first performed in 1944. In 1949, a Medtner Society was founded in London by Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar Bahadur, the Maharajah of Mysore (the princely state in Karnataka, southern India). In 1945, the Maharajah became an honorary Fellow of Trinity College of Music, London, and was the first president of the London Philharmonia Concert Society. He founded the Medtner Society to record all of Medtner&#x27;s works. Medtner, already in declining health, recorded his three piano concertos and some sonatas, chamber music, numerous songs and shorter works, before his death in London in 1951. In one of those recordings he partnered Benno Moiseiwitsch in his two-piano work entitled &quot;Russian Round-Dance&quot;, Op 58 No. 1. In another he accompanied Elisabeth Schwarzkopf in several of his lieder, including &quot;The Muse&quot;, a Pushkin setting from 1913. In gratitude to his patron, Medtner dedicated his Third Piano Concerto to the Maharajah of Mysore.

Medtner died at his home at Golders Green, London on 13 November 1951, and is buried alongside his brother Emil in Hendon Cemetery.

== Music ==
=== Piano sonatas ===

Medtner composed 14 piano sonatas.

The First Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 5, is a four-movement work written between 1901–3 (completed August 1903); though it suggests the style of Scriabin or Rachmaninoff, it is nonetheless original. Medtner&#x27;s craft gained subtlety and complexity in later years, but this work is already evidence of his mastery of musical structure. An opening &quot;Allegro&quot;, dramatic and imbued like much Russian music with a bell-like sonority, is separated by an &quot;Intermezzo&quot; from a &quot;Largo divoto&quot; that reaches a Maestoso climax before plunging into the headlong &quot;Allegro risoluto&quot; finale.

The Second, Third and Fourth piano sonatas are unrelated one-movement works. They were written during the period 1904–07 and published as the &quot;Sonata-Triad&quot;, Op. 11. The first of the trio, in A, is an ecstatic work with attractive, lyrical themes, prefaced by a poem by Goethe. The second, in D minor, is entitled &quot;Sonate-Elegie&quot;. It opens slowly with one of Medtner&#x27;s best-known themes and closes with an animated coda (&quot;Allegro molto doppio movimento&quot;, in D major) based on the second subject. The third, in C, returns to the lyricism of the first.

The Fifth and formerly the most popular of his sonatas is the G minor, Op. 22, written in 1909–1910. The piece alternates a slow introduction with a three-theme, propulsive sonata movement, one of whose themes was heard in the Introduction. The emotional center of this compact work (sixteen minutes in duration) is the &quot;Interludium: Andante lugubre&quot;: this comprises most of the development section and contains some of Medtner&#x27;s loveliest harmonies. There are historic recordings by Moiseiwitch and Gilels.

The Sixth Sonata followed soon after, the first of two that comprise his Op. 25. It bears the title &quot;Sonata-Skazka&quot;, usually translated as &quot;Fairy Tale Sonata&quot;. This short work in C minor, written in 1910–11, is in three movements; the second and third are connected. The first movement is a compact sonata-form, the slow movement rondo-like (the similarity to one melody by Rachmaninoff is coincidental, as the latter was not written until some thirty years later). A minatory final march with variations ends with a Coda that revisits earlier material. This was the only Medtner sonata that Rachmaninoff performed.

Its companion in Op. 25 is entirely different. The Seventh Sonata in E minor, &quot;Night Wind&quot;, after Fyodor Tyutchev&#x27;s 1832 poem &quot;Of what do you howl, night wind...?&quot; (), an excerpt of which provides an epigraph, was completed in 1911 and dedicated to Sergei Rachmaninoff, who immediately recognised its greatness. It is a vast one-movement work, lasting almost 35 minutes, in two major parts: an Introduction and &quot;Allegro&quot; sonata-form, followed by a Fantasy capped by a shadowy but active Coda, the latter entirely and ingeniously based on material presented in the Introduction. Under the title &quot;Sonata&quot; Medtner added a note: &quot;The whole piece is in an epic spirit&quot; (Вся пьеса в эпическом духе). Geoffrey Tozer said: &quot;it has the reputation of being a fearsomely difficult work of extraordinary length, exhausting to play and to hear, but of magnificent quality and marvelous invention.&quot;

The Eighth &quot;Sonata-Ballade&quot; in F, Op. 27, began as a one-movement work, and was expanded into its present form over the period 1912–14. It comprises a Ballade, Introduction and Finale. The tonality and some of the material make passing reference to Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Barcarolle&quot;. The first movement opens with one of Medtner&#x27;s lovely pastoral melodies. The finale, like the Piano Quintet, has a thematic connection with his Pushkin setting &quot;The Muse&quot;. Medtner himself recorded this work.

The one-movement Ninth Sonata in A minor, Op. 30, was published without a title but was known as the &quot;War Sonata&quot; among Medtner&#x27;s friends; a footnote &quot;during the war 1914–1917&quot; appeared in the 1959 Collected Edition.

The Tenth &quot;Sonata-reminiscenza&quot; in A minor, Op. 38, No. 1, commences a set of eight pieces entitled &quot;Forgotten Melodies (First Cycle)&quot;. Two further cycles followed, published as Op. 39 and 40. Both this and the following sonata were completed in 1920, the year before Medtner emigrated. This single movement is one of Medtner&#x27;s most poetic creations; as the title indicates, its character is nostalgic and wistful. Other pieces in opus 38 contain variants of the Sonata&#x27;s opening theme, such as the concluding &quot;Alla Reminiscenza&quot;. This sonata is nowadays the most often performed.

The Eleventh, &quot;Sonata Tragica&quot; in C minor, Op. 39, No. 5, concludes &quot;Forgotten Melodies (Second Cycle)&quot;. There is some repetition of themes in this set as well—the piece which precedes the Sonata, &quot;Canzona Matinata&quot;, contains a theme which recurs in the Sonata, and according to Medtner&#x27;s wishes both pieces are to be played &quot;attacca&quot;—without pause. This is also a single movement sonata-allegro form, but Allegro, dramatic and ferocious, with three themes of which one (the reminiscence from &quot;Canzona Matinata&quot;) does not return. A violent coda concludes. This sonata is well served by recordings, including one by Medtner in 1947.

The Twelfth Sonata, entitled &quot;Romantica&quot; in B minor, Op. 53, No. 1, was completed at the end of 1930, along with its twin. It was premièred in Glasgow in 1931. Returning to a four-movement form, it consists of a &quot;Romance&quot; (B minor), &quot;Scherzo&quot; (E minor), &quot;Meditazione&quot; (B minor), and &quot;Finale&quot; (B minor). The ending quotes his Sonata-Skazka, Op. 25, No. 1.

The Thirteenth Sonata, the &quot;Minacciosa&quot; (&quot;menacing&quot;) in F minor, Op. 53, No. 2, is another one-movement work. It is highly chromatic, and contains a fugue. Medtner described it as &quot;my most contemporary composition, for it reflects the threatening atmosphere of contemporary events&quot;. Marc-André Hamelin described it as &quot;the most concentrated 15 minutes of music one could ever hope to play or listen to&quot;. It was dedicated to the Canadian pianist and pupil of Scriabin, Alfred La Liberté, one of Medtner&#x27;s most loyal supporters.

The last of the sonatas, &quot;Sonata-Idyll&quot; in G major, Op. 56, was completed in 1937. It consists of two movements: a short &quot;Allegretto cantabile&quot; Pastorale and a sonata allegro &quot;Allegro moderato e cantabile (sempre al rigore di tempo)&quot;.

=== Piano concertos ===
Medtner composed three piano concertos:
* Piano Concerto No. 1 in C minor, Op. 33 (1914–18). Dedicated to the composer&#x27;s mother, this one-movement work opens with an exposition section setting out the material for the work, the opening pages of which erupt with fireworks from the piano against a surging orchestral statement of the subject. A set of variations make up the central development before the opening returns two thirds of the way through the piece. Eventually the coda sets out the romantic &quot;big tune&quot; before the final pages lead to an unexpectedly bittersweet ending.
* Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 50 (1920–27). Dedicated to Rachmaninoff, who dedicated his own Fourth Concerto to Medtner. In three movements: &quot;Toccata&quot;, and a &quot;Romanza&quot; from which follows a &quot;Divertimento&quot;. The first movement is propulsive with kinetic energy, and there is much dialogue between piano and orchestra (a subsidiary theme resembles the Fairy Tale from the Op. 14 (1906–07) pair, the &quot;March of the Paladin&quot;). The Romanza and Divertimento are each in their own way varied in character, the Divertimento particularly rich in inspiration.
* Piano Concerto No. 3 in E minor &quot;Ballade&quot;, Op. 60, 1940–43. The factors which led to the creation of this work are closely connected to the circumstances of his final years. It is dedicated to his generous patron, the Maharajah of Mysore. Three connected movements: the first, &quot;Con moto largamente&quot;, sustained and profound, slowly developing motion and energy; the second an Interludium, &quot;Allegro, molto sostenuto, misterioso&quot; quotes the first movement and prefigures the finale; a lengthy &quot;Allegro molto. Svegliando, eroico&quot; vigorously concludes the work. Medtner recorded all three Concertos with the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1947.

===Chamber music===
Medtner&#x27;s chamber music includes three violin sonatas and a piano quintet:
* Violin Sonata No. 3 in E minor, Op. 57 (1938). Recorded by David Oistrakh, among others. A vast work in four movements, a counterpart to his &quot;Night Wind&quot; Piano Sonata, No. 7. &quot;Introduzione – Andante meditamente&quot;, &quot;Scherzo – Allegro molto vivace, leggiero&quot;, &quot;Andante con moto&quot;, &quot;Finale – Allegro molto&quot;. A motto theme in the Introduction juxtaposes chords quietly but insistently, joined by a melody on the violin. The melody becomes the first theme of the – lengthy – sonata-form movement that follows, juxtaposed with other themes including a march in imitation. The folksy and syncopated &quot;Scherzo&quot; in A minor, thematically related to the opening movement&#x27;s faster sections, is in Rondo-form. After a reminiscence of the motto, the Andante is a lament in F minor, extremely Russian in sentiment. The virtuoso Finale has thematic elements related to Russian Orthodox liturgical music (Medtner was born Lutheran but late in life converted to Orthodox).
* Piano Quintet in C major, Op. posth. It was published after the composer&#x27;s death. He worked on sketches of the work from 1903 until its completion in 1949. Medtner considered it the ultimate summary of his musical life. Due to Medtner&#x27;s illness, the piano part in the work&#x27;s premiere was taken by Colin Horsley. Medtner&#x27;s recording of the work with the Aeolian Quartet, unpublished at the time, has been released on the St Laurent label.

===Songs===
Medtner published over 100 songs for voice and piano, with words from texts by Pushkin, Goethe, Mikhail Lermontov, Fyodor Tyutchev, and Afanasy Fet, among others.

== Legacy ==
Edward Mitchell was an early champion of Medtner, and gave the first complete performance of Medtner&#x27;s &quot;Sonata-Triad&quot; in the UK at the Aeolian Hall on 3 February 1922. Geoffrey Tozer recorded almost all of Medtner&#x27;s works for the piano including all the concertos and sonatas. Hamish Milne has recorded most of the solo piano works, while Geoffrey Douglas Madge, Konstantin Scherbakov and Yevgeny Sudbin have recorded the three piano concertos. Other pianists who championed Medtner&#x27;s work and left behind recordings include Benno Moiseiwitsch, Sviatoslav Richter, Edna Iles, Emil Gilels, Yevgeny Svetlanov and Earl Wild. In modern times, pianists noted for their advocacy include Ekaterina Derzhavina, Marc-André Hamelin, Malcolm Binns, Irina Mejoueva (ja), Nikolai Demidenko, Anna Zassimova, Boris Berezovsky, Paul Stewart, Dmitri Alexeev, Evgeny Kissin, Andrey Ponochevny, Konstantin Lifschitz, Daniil Trifonov, Gintaras Januševičius, Dina Parakhina, Alessandro Taverna and Paulius Andersson.

Far fewer singers have tackled the songs. Medtner himself recorded a selection with the sopranos Oda Slobodskaya, Tatiana Makushina, Margaret Ritchie and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. In recent times Susan Gritton and Ludmilla Andrew have recorded complete CDs with Geoffrey Tozer, as has Caroline Vitale with Peter Baur. The bass-baritone Vassily Savenko has recorded a considerable number of Medtner songs with Boris Berezovsky, Alexander Blok and Victor Yampolsky. A handful of other singers have included Medtner songs in compilations; particularly notable are historic recordings by Zara Dolukhanova and Irina Arkhipova. However, many songs are not available on CD, and some await their first recording. A substantial two-CD set, presenting fifty-four Medtner songs, accompanied by Iain Burnside, has appeared in 2018.

Medtner recorded piano rolls of some of his works for Welte-Mignon in 1923 and Duo-Art in 1925, before his later studio recordings for Capitol Records and other labels.

In 2017 the Ukrainian pianist Darya Dadykina and the Russian pianist Vasily Gvozdetsky founded the International Nikolai Medtner Society in Berlin to popularize his work and to advance cultural exchange in and around Europe. In October/November 2018 the society organized the 1st International Nikolai Medtner Music Festival in Berlin, which brings together artists and musicologists to perform and discuss his work (see the festival programme ).

An asteroid called 9329 Nikolaimedtner is named after the composer.

== Publications ==
Medtner&#x27;s one book, &quot;The Muse and the Fashion, being a defence of the foundations of the Art of Music&quot; (1935, reprinted 1957 and 1978) was a statement of his artistic credo and reaction to some of the trends of the time. He believed strongly that there were immutable laws to music, whose essence was in song. An English translation of the book was published in 1951 by Alfred Swan.

Medtner also wrote a memoir titled &quot;With S.V. Rachmaninoff&quot; in 1933, in which he writes admiringly about his friend as a composer and as a pianist.

== Print sources ==
After Medtner&#x27;s death, the Mysore Foundation sponsored the publication of &quot;Medtner: A Memorial Volume&quot;, also titled &quot;Nicolas Medtner (1879–1951): A Tribute to his Art and Personality&quot;. It contains photographs and essays from his widow, friends, critics, musicians, composers, and admirers. A few of the contributors were: Alfred Swan, translator of Medtner&#x27;s The Muse and the Fashion into English, Ivan Ilyin, Ernest Newman, Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji, Marcel Dupré, Russian music critic Leonid Sabeneev, Canadian pianist and close friend of the composer Alfred La Liberté, singers Margaret Ritchie, Tatania Makushina and Oda Slobodskaya, and Medtner himself via extracts from Muse and the Fashion. The editor of the volume was Richard Holt.

In 2004, Natalia Konsistorum published, in Russian, &quot;Nikolai Karlovich Medtner: Portrait of a Composer&quot; (). The book is available in a German translation by Christoph Flamm and is notable for the two CDs it contains with original recordings of a variety of Medtner&#x27;s works.

There have been numerous dissertations on Medtner&#x27;s music. One of the most influential is &quot;Der russische Komponist Nikolaj Metner : Studien und Materialien&quot; by Christoph Flamm. Originally presented as the author&#x27;s Ph.D thesis (Heidelberg, 1995), it was published by Kuhn (, 1995, out of print). It includes letters, reviews and other documents in German, Russian, English and French, a bibliography and partial discography. Wendelin Bitzan&#x27;s dissertation &quot;The Sonata as an Ageless Principle&quot; (Vienna, 2019, available in open access) was written under guidance from Flamm and presents in-depth analyses of Medtner&#x27;s sonatas and their historical and aesthetic contexts.

In 2003, David J. Skvorak wrote a doctoral thesis &quot;Thematic unity in Nicolas Medtner&#x27;s works for piano : Skazki, sonatas, and piano quintet&quot; at the University of Cincinnati, published by UMI. It contains theoretical analyses of several of Medtner&#x27;s works.

== Adaptations and citations ==
Bart Berman composed &quot;Variations and Fugue&quot; based on the theme in Medtner&#x27;s &quot;Theme with Variations, Op. 55&quot; in 2009.
The author Philip Pullman declared Medtner as his favourite composer during a short interview available on the BBC website in September 2011.

<text>The Seversky XP-41 was a fighter aircraft built in the United States in 1939. A single prototype was modified from the last production Seversky P-35 by adding a new streamlined canopy, a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-19 engine with a two-speed supercharger, and revised landing gear. The XP-41 first flew in March 1939. The aircraft was developed in parallel with the P-43 Lancer, and work was stopped when the USAAC showed a preference for the latter.

<doc id="1066574" wikidata="Q4934338" url="?curid=1066574" title="Bob Welch (politician)">
<text>Robert Stanley Kemp Welch (July 13, 1928 – July 29, 2000) was a Canadian politician. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1963 to 1985 as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of John Robarts, Bill Davis and Frank Miller.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Welch was born in St. Catharines, the son of a railway brakeman. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from McMaster University in Hamilton, and a Bachelor of Laws degree from Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto. He worked as a barrister and solicitor after his graduation, and was a member of that St. Catharines Board of Education from 1955 until 1963. Welch was also a lay preacher in the Anglican church, and served as chancellor of the Anglican Diocese in Niagara from 1965 to 1992.

===Political career===
He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1963 provincial election, winning a convincing victory in the rural, southwestern Ontario constituency of Lincoln. After serving as a backbench supporter of the Robarts government for two years, he was named to cabinet on November 24, 1966 as Provincial Secretary (Ontario) and Minister of Citizenship. Welch was re-elected by a landslide in the 1967 provincial election, and was retained in both portfolios.

====Leadership campaign====
When Robarts retired, Welch ran to succeed him in the 1971 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership convention. He was often depicted as a &quot;consensus candidate&quot;, and was criticized for not debating policy issues. His campaign organization was initially weak, but received an unexpected boost from four of Robarts&#x27; senior advisors. Some have speculated that Robarts only intended to give Welch&#x27;s campaign the appearance of strength, such that frontrunner Bill Davis would not appear to win the leadership by default. Welch proved a likeable figure and a good speaker, and built a base of delegate support at the expense of rival candidate Darcy McKeough.

He finished fourth on the first ballot (three votes behind McKeough), and was eliminated after the second. Despite rumours that he would support McKeough, he remained neutral after his elimination and released his delegates. Davis was elected on the fourth ballot, defeating upstart candidate Allan Lawrence by 44 votes.

====Davis years====
Welch became part of the new premier&#x27;s inner circle of advisors and was often used as a &quot;fixer&quot; in the Davis government, taking temporary placements in difficult portfolios as a crisis manager. Davis initially named Welch to be his own successor as Education Minister on March 1, 1971. In this capacity, he was responsible for drafting policy guidelines on funding for Ontario&#x27;s Roman Catholic school system. After another convincing victory in the 1971 provincial election, he was named as Provincial Secretary for Social Development on February 2, 1972.

The Social Development portfolio was a newly created &quot;super-ministry&quot;, and was intended to provide Welch with supervisory powers over the departments of Education, Health, Universities and Colleges and Social and Family Services. Though it was a powerful position in principle, it carried no direct administrative responsibilities and led to a reduced profile for the minister. Welch was often forced to remain silent in the legislative question period, while ministers under his watch responded to members of the opposition. He returned to a higher profile position on November 7, 1973, when Davis gave him additional responsibilities as Minister of Housing. In this capacity, he oversaw the cancellation of the Davis government&#x27;s &quot;Cedarwood&quot; project near Pickering.

Following a cabinet shuffle on February 26, 1974, Welch was promoted to Attorney General and Provincial Secretary for Justice. The latter position gave him supervisory powers over the departments of Correctional Services, Consumer and Corporate Affairs and the Solicitor General. He was also named Minister of Culture and Recreation on January 14, 1975, and was relieved of his other two positions on July 18 of the same year.

The Progressive Conservatives were reduced to a minority government in the 1975 provincial election, but remained in power due to divisions among the opposition parties. Welch was re-elected for the newly created Brock constituency, while the redistributed division of Lincoln was won by the Liberal Party. Welch was appointed Government House Leader after the election, giving him the responsibility for working with opposition parties to ensure the passage of government legislation. He was also retained as Culture and Recreation Minister, and served as Commissioner of the Board of Internal Economy from November 4, 1975 to April 29, 1977.

The 1977 provincial election yielded another minority government for the Progressive Conservatives. Welch remained Culture and Tourism minister until August 16, 1978, when he was re-appointed as Provincial Secretary for Justice. He held this position until August 30, 1979, when he was named Minister of Energy. He also became Ontario&#x27;s Deputy Premier on September 21, 1977, although this was not a cabinet position at the time.

The Progressive Conservatives were returned to power with a majority government in the 1981 election. Welch remained Deputy Premier throughout the legislative session that followed, and saw the position elevated to cabinet level by an order in council of June 21, 1983. He also remained Energy Minister until July 6 of the same year, and was named as Minister responsible for Women&#x27;s Issues on May 17, 1983. In the latter position, Welch announced plans to study and reduce the wage gap between male and female workers.

=====Cabinet posts=====



====Miller premiership====
Welch supported Dennis Timbrell&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign to succeed Davis as party leader in 1985. When Frank Miller was sworn in as premier on February 8, 1985, he kept Welch as deputy premier and also re-appointed him to the office of Attorney-General. Welch was also named Government House Leader on February 20. He did not contest the 1985 provincial election, and formally resigned from cabinet on May 17.

====Retirement====
Welch returned to his law practice after leaving politics, and served as chancellor of Brock University from 1985 until his death in 2000. In 1993, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

<text>The Volvo YCC (&quot;Your Concept Car&quot;) was a concept car made by Volvo Cars presented at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show, with the stated goal of meeting the particular needs of female drivers. In order to do so, Volvo assembled a design team entirely made up of women, around October 2001. It was a major exercise in ergonomics from the perspective of a female driver. Those who were involved during the several stages of the project were: Maria Widell Christiansen, Eva-Lisa Andersson, Elna Holmberg, Maria Uggla, Camilla Palmertz, Cynthia Charwick, Anna Rosén, Lena Ekelund, and Tatiana Butovitsch Temm.

On the outside the car looked, at first glance, like a mildly futuristic four-seat coupé. On closer inspection, one could see that there was no hood, that is, no access panel permitting access to the car&#x27;s engine. Engine maintenance required taking out the whole front end of the car body, preferably in some establishment with the required space and equipment. This was not supposed to happen often, as the engine was designed to need an oil change only after and to automatically send a radio message to a garage a short time before any required maintenance.

Filling the windshield washer tank was done by a capless ball valve, right next to the capless gas tank ball valve. Volvo surveys had found (among many other things) that female drivers considered caps to be a major nuisance. The car featured run-flat tires, like those of wheeled armoured vehicles, in order to be able to drive all the way to a garage after a puncture and thus avoid having to change a tire by the side of the road.

Entry into the car was by the means of two gull-wing doors on the sides. The concept was a three-door, four-seat coupe design. It also had an upwards-opening hatchback door giving access to the trunk and cargo area. All three doors were motorized for a sensor-based “keyless” entry. Pressing on a single button on the keychain automatically opened the nearest door, making it easy for somebody holding bags of groceries or other sundries to get the things in the car without putting anything down. The interior was maximized for easy storage and good looks.

All of the textile panels or textile parts such as the seat pads or the door sides could be removed easily to change the color schemes and vary textures. The headrests had indentations to accommodate pony tails. The shifting column and the hand brake were removed from the center console to give the front-seat passengers easier access to the large storage compartments located within the dashboard. The rear seat could fold up, making it easy for the driver to get a fairly big item in the car without opening the hatchback. The bumpers and body cladding were made from tough, dent-resistant materials. The hybrid engine was economical and powerful. The five-cylinder engine produced .

<text>Hydrilla (waterthyme) is a genus of aquatic plant, usually treated as containing just one species, Hydrilla verticillata, though some botanists divide it into several species. It is native to the cool and warm waters of the Old World in Asia, Africa and Australia, with a sparse, scattered distribution; in Australia from Northern Territory, Queensland, and New South Wales.

The stems grow up to 1–2 m long. The leaves are arranged in whorls of two to eight around the stem, each leaf 5–20 mm long and 0.7–2 mm broad, with serrations or small spines along the leaf margins; the leaf midrib is often reddish when fresh. It is monoecious (sometimes dioecious), with male and female flowers produced separately on a single plant; the flowers are small, with three sepals and three petals, the petals 3–5 mm long, transparent with red streaks. It reproduces primarily vegetatively by fragmentation and by rhizomes and turions (overwintering), and flowers are rarely seen. They have air spaces to keep them upright.

&quot;Hydrilla&quot; has a high resistance to salinity compared to many other freshwater aquatic plants.

==Taxonomy and naming==
&quot;Hydrilla&quot; closely resembles some other related aquatic plants, including &quot;Egeria densa&quot; and &quot;Elodea canadensis&quot;. Synonyms include &quot;H. asiatica&quot;, &quot;H. japonica&quot;, &quot;H. lithuanica&quot;, and &quot;H. ovalifolica&quot;.

==Ecology==
&quot;Hydrilla verticillata&quot; is allelopathic to the common hornwort (&quot;Ceratophyllum demersum&quot;) and prickly hornwort (&quot;C. muricatum&quot;), that is, it produces compounds that inhibit growth of the latter two species.

As aquatic macrophytes, &quot;Hydrilla&quot; play critical roles in the ecosystem. They influence nutrient cycles and the ecology of the body of water, as well as the sediments. &quot;Hydrilla&quot; interacts with other organisms, supplying food and nutrients as well as habitats and shelters. 

&quot;Hydrilla&quot; can have negative impacts in aquatic communities. When abundant, they affect dissolved oxygen levels, which can lead to decline in populations of fish, invertebrates, and other plant species.

==Status as an invasive plant==

===Introduction===

&quot;Hydrilla&quot; is naturalized and invasive in the United States following release in the 1950s and 1960s from aquariums into waterways in Florida, due to the aquarium trade. It is now established in parts of southern Canada and in the United States from Connecticut to Texas, and also in California. By the 1990s control and management were costing millions of dollars each year.

The plant was introduced when a Florida West Coast aquarium dealer shipped live &quot;Hydrilla&quot; from Sri Lanka under the common name &quot;Indian star-vine.&quot; These plants were considered unsatisfactory and were dumped into a canal near Tampa Bay, where they flourished. By 1955, the plants found their way from Tampa to Miami as they were transported for cultivation and pet trade sale. It is believed that several undocumented cases of accidental or careless releases followed, as there was extensive spread of the &quot;Hydrilla&quot; throughout Florida and the southeastern United States.

===Problems===

Due to the combination of herbicide resistance, high growth rates, high ecological adaptability, dispersion ability, and low resources required, &quot;Hydrilla&quot; is able to invade almost every region of the world and spread at an alarming rate, affecting the ecosystem in a negative manner. The high photosynthesis rate of &quot;Hydrilla&quot; leads to the depletion in dissolved carbon dioxide during daytime, which raises the pH, and to higher concentrations of oxygen. At night, the oxygen is used for oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in anoxia, and carbon dioxide is replenished, which in turn lowers the pH.

As an invasive species in Florida, &quot;Hydrilla&quot; has become the most serious aquatic weed problem for Florida and most of the U.S. Because it was such a threat as an invasive species, one of the first cost-effective broadscale herbicide controls developed was fluridone. Unfortunately, this single-use herbicide resulted in fluridone-resistant &quot;Hydrilla&quot;. &quot;As &quot;Hydrilla&quot; spread rapidly to lakes across the southern United States in the past, the expansion of resistant biotypes is likely to pose significant environmental challenges in the future.&quot;

&quot;Hydrilla&quot; populations have caused economic, environmental, and ecological damage. &quot;Hydrilla&quot; is known to be an aggressive and competitive plant, out-competing and displacing native species, such as pondweeds and eelgrass. &quot;Hydrilla&quot; has thus created monocultures, areas dominated by a single species, rather than having a balance among many species, as in a normal ecosystem.

In Australia, &quot;Hydrilla&quot; can become invasive if the nutrient levels are raised in disturbed ecosystems, though is not generally known to be problematic.

&quot;Hydrilla&quot; can host a biofilm of the cyanobacteria &quot;Aetokthonos hydrillicola&quot;, which can produce the brominated neurotoxin aetokthonotoxin — the causative agent of avian vacuolar myelinopathy, a fatal brain wasting disease of waterfowl and raptors.

===Management===

&quot;Hydrilla&quot; can be controlled by herbicides, as well as grass carp, itself an invasive species in North America. Insects used as biological pest control for this plant include weevils of the genus &quot;Bagous&quot; and the Asian hydrilla leaf-mining fly (&quot;Hydrellia pakistanae&quot;). Tubers pose a problem as they can lie dormant for a number of years, making it even more difficult to remove from waterways and estuaries. &quot;Hydrilla&quot; can spread efficiently through both tubers and turions.

In 2011 an inlet of Cayuga Lake, one of the Finger Lakes in New York State, faced a &quot;Hydrilla&quot; introduction. The city of Ithaca and other local officials used the chemical herbicide endothall to try to head off establishment in the Finger Lakes, which would have been disastrous for their ecosystems. The first year nearly $100,000 and many man-hours were spent trying to eradicate the &quot;Hydrilla&quot; infestation. Follow-up treatments were planned for at least five years.

In August 2021 &quot;Hydrilla&quot; was discovered growing in a small boat marina connected to the Niagara River in the city of North Tonawanda, New York. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation is working to contain the infestation.

In September 2021, the Connecticut River Conservancy stated that &quot;Hydrilla&quot; has been overwhelming tributary rivers, coves, inlets and riverbanks along the river for years. Kelsey Wentling, a river steward at the Connecticut River Conservancy, stated, &quot;&quot;Hydrilla&quot; can spread through a process known as fragmentation, in which the plants, due to some sort of disruption, break apart and regrow elsewhere. Fragmentation often happens when boats go through a patch of &quot;Hydrilla&quot;. For this reason, it is critical that those using paddle boats, power boats, jet skis, and fishing equipment in the Connecticut River be aware of invasive &quot;Hydrilla&quot; and then take steps to reduce its spread.&quot; It has also been reported by local marinas and municipalities that they can no longer access certain boat slips and docks due to the density of &quot;Hydrilla&quot;. The Connecticut River Conservancy in September 2021 requested area boaters to complete a survey to help with the ongoing management of the invasive plant.

==Phytoremediation==
This abundant source of biomass is a known bioremediation hyperaccumulator of mercury, cadmium, chromium and lead, and as such can be used in phytoremediation.

<text>La Grande Soufrière (; ), or simply Soufrière (), is an active stratovolcano on the French island of Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe. It is the highest mountain peak in the Lesser Antilles, rising high.

The last magmatic eruption was in 1530±30 during which the current lava dome was emplaced.
More recent eruptions have been phreatic in type. On February 8, 1843, an eruption of La Grande Soufrière caused by an earthquake killed over 5,000 people.

Significant seismic activity in 1976 led to a mass evacuation of the island&#x27;s 72,000 residents. There was a bitter, and well-publicized, controversy between scientists Claude Allègre and Haroun Tazieff on whether evacuation should occur. Allègre held that inhabitants should be evacuated, just in case, while Tazieff held that the &quot;Soufrière&quot; was harmless. The prefect decided to evacuate, erring on the side of caution. The volcano erupted on August 30, 1976, but much less severely than predicted by the Allègre side. There were no fatalities and no significant damage, except for the large cost of the evacuation.

While the island was deserted, the German filmmaker Werner Herzog traveled to the abandoned town of Basse-Terre to find a peasant who had refused to leave his home on the slopes of the volcano. His journey is recorded in the film &quot;La Soufrière&quot;.

<text>Vincent Frank Testaverde Sr. (; born November 13, 1963) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 21 seasons. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, earning consensus All-American honors and winning the Heisman Trophy in 1986.

Testaverde was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the first overall pick of the 1987 NFL draft. After leaving as a free agent, he signed with the Cleveland Browns and was among the personnel transferred to the newly created Baltimore Ravens during a controversial relocation of the team. He then joined the New York Jets, where he achieved his greatest success. In the last four seasons of his career, he played for the Dallas Cowboys, the Jets for a second time, New England Patriots, and Carolina Panthers for one year each.

Testaverde&#x27;s professional career was principally characterized by its longevity, lasting 21 seasons, playing for seven different teams. Despite being in the top 10 upon retirement in most career passing statistics (6th in career passing yardage, 7th in career touchdown passes, 6th in career completions), his 123 losses as a starting quarterback is an NFL record, and his career regular-season winning percentage of 42.3% is the lowest of any quarterback with at least 70 wins. He played in five postseason games in his NFL career with a record of 2–3. Testaverde was known for his strong arm and high volume, but was also known for his high interception totals. Testaverde threw more than 20 interceptions in four of his 21 seasons, including his second season with the Buccaneers, in which he threw 35 interceptions.

==Early life==
Testaverde was born in Brooklyn, New York City. While living in Elmont, New York, on Long Island, Testaverde attended Sewanhaka High School in Floral Park, and graduated in 1981. He then attended Fork Union Military Academy in Fork Union, Virginia for a post-graduate year of college preparatory work. Growing up, he was a fan of the New York Jets.

==College career==

Testaverde accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Miami, where he played for the Miami Hurricanes football team from 1982 to 1986. He redshirted as a freshman, backed up Bernie Kosar for the next two seasons, and became the starter in 1985. As a senior in 1986, he was a consensus first-team All-American and won the Heisman Trophy, on his way to becoming the Hurricanes&#x27; all-time leader in career touchdown passes with 48. In addition to the Heisman Trophy, he won the Davey O&#x27;Brien Award, the Maxwell Award, the Sammy Baugh Trophy, and the Walter Camp Player of the Year Award. His 26 touchdown passes in the 1986 season led major college football. He played in the 1987 Fiesta Bowl against Penn State for the 1986 national championship, a game in which the Miami Hurricanes were heavily favored but lost 14–10 in a game in which Testaverde threw five interceptions.

Testaverde played an important part in the University of Miami&#x27;s history as one of the top college football programs of the 1980s and 1990s. Along with Jim Kelly, Mark Richt, Bernie Kosar, Steve Walsh, Gino Torretta, Craig Erickson, and Ken Dorsey, Testaverde is considered part of the University of Miami&#x27;s quarterback dynasty, and was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. On May 7, 2013, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Testaverde was selected as the first overall draft pick by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1987 NFL draft. He made his NFL debut in Week 2, throwing four passes in a 20–3 loss to the Chicago Bears. He made his first start in a Week 13 loss to the Saints. He scored his first NFL touchdown on a one-yard rush and he threw his first passing touchdown on a 37-yard pass to Mark Carrier. In his second season, Testaverde struggled heavily with a 47.6% completion rate for 3,240 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 35 interceptions. His 35 interceptions were the second most of any quarterback in a single season in NFL history. During his tenure in Tampa, Testaverde received taunts from fans and radio personalities about his color blindness. In 1988, a radio station in Tampa rented a billboard that had Testaverde standing in front of a blue background. The billboard read: &quot;Vinny thinks this is orange!&quot; The high number of errors caused his intelligence to be called into question. National Football League Players Association president Gene Upshaw, unaware that his comments could be heard by anyone viewing through a direct satellite uplink, once commented during an &quot;NFL Live!&quot; commercial break that Testaverde was so dumb that he would drag the electric cord through his swimming pool while trimming the hedges, and claimed himself to be a better quarterback (Upshaw was a retired offensive guard) than Testaverde.

In the 1989 season, Testaverde started all 14 games and passed for over 3,000 yards and 20 touchdowns. While Testaverde significantly reduced his interception total in 1989, he again led the league with 22. His numbers continued to improve, and in the 1992 season, his last with Tampa Bay, he threw for a 57.5% completion rate for 2,554 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions.

===Cleveland Browns===
Testaverde signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Cleveland Browns in 1993. After spending half a season as a backup to his former Hurricanes teammate Bernie Kosar, he became the starter after Kosar&#x27;s release by then Browns head coach Bill Belichick. Testaverde spent three seasons in Cleveland, and in 1994 led the team to an 11–5 record and a playoff appearance, where they won the AFC Wild Card Round game against New England before being defeated by Pittsburgh in the Divisional Round. Testaverde started on and off for the Browns during the 1995 season, where the team dropped to a 5–11 record and missed the playoffs entirely. Testaverde would be present for the controversial Cleveland Browns move to Baltimore following a series of franchise relocations throughout the league.

=== Baltimore Ravens ===
In 1996, most of the players and personnel that made up the Cleveland Browns organization moved to Baltimore, establishing the Baltimore Ravens. Testaverde played two seasons with the newly formed team. He scored the first touchdown in the history of the Ravens on a nine-yard run and ended the season with over 4,000 passing yards, 33 passing touchdowns, and 19 interceptions. Testaverde made his first Pro Bowl appearance in 1996, with the Ravens.

Said football statistics site &quot;Football Outsiders&quot; of Testaverde&#x27;s unlikely 1996 season, &quot;The real reason the Ravens ranked first in rushing [efficiency] was, believe it or not, Vinny Testaverde, who was out of his gourd as a scrambler that season. Ignore the official stats and take out the kneels, and Testaverde had 197 yards on just 23 carries, 8.6 yards per carry. He scrambled seven times on third down with 5–10 yards to go and converted six of those. He scrambled six times on a 1st-and-10 and gained a new first down five times. Testaverde had not rushed for 100 yards since 1992.&quot;

Testaverde signed a restructured four-year contract with the Ravens ahead of the 1997 season. Ravens owner Art Modell complimented Testaverde on his loyalty to the team and his acceptance of the city of Baltimore. However, Testaverde did not perform as well in 1997, as he did the previous year. He threw 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, and was replaced by backup Eric Zeier after suffering an injury. Zeier led the Ravens to two consecutive victories and become popular with the fans. After trading for Indianapolis Colts quarterback Jim Harbaugh, the Ravens released Testaverde prior to the 1998 season. While Modell and Ravens coach Ted Marchibroda complimented Testaverde and said that he would start elsewhere in the NFL, Testaverde and his agent were dissatisfied with the way that his release was conducted.

===New York Jets (first stint)===
In 1998, his first season with his hometown New York Jets, Testaverde began the season as the second-string quarterback behind starter Glenn Foley, whose rib injury in Week 2 made him the starter. Testaverde flourished in his first start, throwing four touchdown passes against the Indianapolis Colts and winning two straight games for the Jets. The recovered Foley was named the starter by head coach Bill Parcells for their Week 6 game against the St. Louis Rams, but after a miserable 5-of-15 outing, he was benched and replaced by Testaverde, who remained the starter for the rest of the season. He went 12–1 in 13 games as a starter, completing 61.5% of his passes with 29 touchdowns, seven interceptions, and a 101.6 quarterback rating, making the Pro Bowl for the second time.

In a December game against the Seattle Seahawks, Testaverde was involved in a play that was cited as an impetus for the NFL&#x27;s adoption of a new instant replay review system the next season. With the Jets trailing 31–26 and twenty seconds left in the game, Testaverde attempted to score on a quarterback sneak on fourth and goal from the Seattle five-yard line. Testaverde had been tackled and the ball was not across the goal line when this happened, but because Testaverde&#x27;s helmet had crossed the line the game&#x27;s head linesman, Earnie Frantz, ruled the play a touchdown. The Jets won the game 32–31 and the loss was said to have cost the Seahawks a playoff berth and coach Dennis Erickson his job.

In spite of the controversy, Testaverde&#x27;s 1998 season was arguably his best season in the NFL. With him under center, the Jets won the AFC East for the first time since the merger and earned a first-round bye, and a home Divisional Round playoff game against Jacksonville. In the AFC Championship that year, they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos 23–10.

The Jets had Super Bowl aspirations entering the 1999 season. However, in the first game of the season, against the New England Patriots, Testaverde suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon and did not play for the rest of the season.

In 2000, Testaverde returned as the Jets quarterback. The highlight of the season was the &quot;Monday Night Miracle&quot; game against the Miami Dolphins on October 23, 2000, selected by fans as the greatest game in Monday Night Football history. In that game, the Jets fell behind 30–7 going into the fourth quarter, but came back to win the game, 40–37 behind five touchdown passes from Testaverde, including one each to Laveranues Coles, Jermaine Wiggins, Jumbo Elliott, and two to Wayne Chrebet. In the regular season finale against the Ravens, he passed for a career-high 481 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions in the loss. In the 2000 season, he led the Jets to a 9–7 record but missed the postseason. He finished with 3,732 yards, 21 touchdowns, and 25 interceptions.

Following the departure of head coach Al Groh, Testaverde had a new coach in Herm Edwards. In 2001, Testaverde led the Jets back to the playoffs, where they lost in the Wild Card Round to the Oakland Raiders 38–24. Testaverde was efficient in the loss, passing for three touchdowns and no interceptions. In 2002, he was replaced after a 1–3 start by Chad Pennington. He made cameo appearances to take the last snap in both the playoff-clinching game versus the Green Bay Packers and the 41–0 Wild Card Round win against the Indianapolis Colts. In 2003, he was assigned to a backup role behind Pennington, although he started the first six games due to Pennington&#x27;s left wrist injury.

===Dallas Cowboys===
Despite his injuries, Testaverde&#x27;s performance with the Jets endeared him to Bill Parcells, who retired from coaching in 1999. One year after Parcells was lured out of retirement by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, he brought Testaverde to the Cowboys in 2004.

Testaverde initially was signed to be a backup and mentor to young Cowboys quarterback Quincy Carter, but after Carter was abruptly cut by the Cowboys for allegedly failing a drug test, Testaverde was given the starting quarterback job. While many questioned his ability to still play in the NFL, the protection schemes and play-calling allowed him to showcase his arm, although with mixed results. He was able to throw for significant yardage, but led the league in interceptions, getting picked off on 4% of his passes. Dallas finished the 2004 season 6–10, for third place in the NFC East.

Testaverde&#x27;s one-year contract with the Cowboys expired early in 2005. The Cowboys chose to instead sign Parcells&#x27; 1993 number one draft pick, Drew Bledsoe, as their top quarterback, leaving Testaverde without a contract. Parcells cites Testaverde&#x27;s presence in Dallas as having been important to the development of eventual starter Tony Romo. At the time, Testaverde&#x27;s 3,532 passing yards and 297 completions were the third-best total of his career and the third-most passing yards in Dallas Cowboys franchise history. He also tied the franchise record for 300-yard passing games in a season with three and became the fifth quarterback in league history to pass for over 300 yards at 40 years old.

===New York Jets (second stint)===
As injuries on September 25, 2005 knocked both Chad Pennington and backup Jay Fiedler out for the 2005 season, the New York Jets re-signed Testaverde on September 27, 2005. Testaverde was named the Jets&#x27; starting quarterback in week five of the 2005 season, in a home game against the team that originally drafted him, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

On December 26, against the New England Patriots on the final ABC telecast of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, Testaverde set a new NFL record for most consecutive seasons with at least one touchdown pass, 19, by throwing a 27-yard pass to Laveranues Coles to secure the record. That pass is also notable as being the last touchdown pass thrown on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; while it was still broadcast by ABC. The game was also notable because the Patriots sent in back-up quarterback Doug Flutie, making this the first game in NFL history in which two quarterbacks over the age of 40 completed a pass (Testaverde was 42, Flutie was 43).

===New England Patriots===
On November 14, 2006, the New England Patriots signed Testaverde as a backup to starter Tom Brady. Testaverde kneeled down for the final play in a victory against the Packers on November 19, 2006. Testaverde threw a touchdown pass to Troy Brown on December 31, 2006, against the Tennessee Titans, giving him at least one touchdown pass for the twentieth straight season, extending his NFL record. The Patriots defeated the Jets, Testaverde&#x27;s former team, in the first round of the playoffs, and Testaverde took the last couple of snaps to run out the clock.

Testaverde wore #14 with the Patriots, the second time the number has been re-issued since Steve Grogan&#x27;s retirement as P.K. Sam wore it earlier in the decade.

On May 29, 2007, Testaverde stated his interest in returning to the Patriots for the 2007 NFL season, and on July 13, 2007, confirmed this with Sporting News Radio. He officially signed a 1-year contract for $825,000 on August 18, 2007, but was released on September 1, 2007.

===Carolina Panthers===

With Jake Delhomme out for the 2007 season due to an elbow injury he suffered in a Week 3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, and David Carr out with a sore back, the Panthers signed Testaverde on October 10, 2007. Testaverde, wearing #16, started his first game with the team on October 14, 2007, against the Arizona Cardinals. In that game, he threw a 65-yard touchdown pass to Steve Smith, extending his NFL record to 21 consecutive seasons with a touchdown pass. After leading the Panthers to a 25–10 victory, the 43-year-old became the oldest starting quarterback to win a game in NFL history, and the third-oldest to start one. He has also thrown touchdown passes to 71 different players, a record since broken by Tom Brady. On October 28, coach John Fox named Testaverde the starting quarterback against the Indianapolis Colts. In that game, Testaverde led the Panthers in the longest opening drive for a touchdown in franchise history, consisting of 18 plays and lasting over 11 minutes. Despite winning time of possession in the first half of the game, the Panthers entered the locker room under a 3-point deficit. In the second half, Testaverde left the field with a strained Achilles tendon, and was replaced by former Houston Texans quarterback David Carr. Ultimately, the Panthers lost 31–7. Reports said that Testaverde would be out for at least a week.

On November 18, Testaverde and the Panthers played at Lambeau Field against Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers for their Week 11 matchup. With Testaverde at 44 years old and Favre at 38 years old, this was the oldest starting quarterback duo in any game in NFL history. The &quot;Senior Bowl&quot;, as it was nicknamed in the media, was won by the Packers 31–17.

On December 2, Testaverde became the second-oldest starting quarterback in NFL history at 44 years and 19 days old. He threw two touchdown passes against the San Francisco 49ers in the Panthers&#x27; win, breaking his own record for the oldest starter to win an NFL game. During this game, Testaverde and Dante Rosario became the passer/receiver duo with the largest age gap between them (20 years, 346 days) to connect for a touchdown.

Testaverde announced his plans for retirement on December 29, which would take effect after the final game of the season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 30.

Panthers head coach John Fox sent him into the game to take the final kneel-down snap in a game which the Panthers won 31–23, expectantly bringing to an end to the 44-year-old&#x27;s 21-year NFL career at the same city he was originally drafted. He officially announced his retirement from professional football in January 2008.

===Legacy===

Despite his long career and overall statistical achievements, Testaverde only had moderate success in terms of wins and losses. During the regular season as a starter, he led his teams to 90 wins, 123 losses, and one tie. He led his team to the postseason on three occasions, with an overall postseason record of 2–3, reaching the AFC Championship Game once. A journeyman quarterback who played on seven different teams, Testaverde holds several NFL records related to his longevity in the league, including the NFL record for having thrown a touchdown pass in 21 consecutive seasons, the most losses by a starting quarterback with 123, and throwing touchdown passes to an NFL record 70 different players (broken by Tom Brady in 2018). He had one of the highest completion percentages in a single game during the regular season (at least 20 attempts) at 91.3% (21/23), in 1993, against the Los Angeles Rams. Testaverde&#x27;s one-time record has since been broken multiple times, with Drew Brees now holding the record at 96.7%.

As a player, Testaverde was commended for his arm strength but criticized for his lack of mobility and tendency to commit turnovers.

<text>Horace Mitchell Miner (May 26, 1912 – November 26, 1993) was an American anthropologist, particularly interested in those languages of his time that were still closely tied to the earth and agricultural practices.

In 1937, he earned his doctorate at the University of Chicago, going on to teach there. In 1937, he began to teach at Wayne State University. During World War II, he served as a Counterintelligence Corps agent, where he earned the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

After 1946, Miner worked at the University of Michigan as a professor of sociology, professor of anthropology, and museum research associate. He received a Fulbright Award in 1950 for his research in Algeria, which involved giving Rorschach tests to the locals. In 1961, he travelled to Makerere College in Uganda on a Fulbright Scholarship.

He published several books, including &quot;Culture and Agriculture&quot; (1949) and &quot;City in Modern Africa&quot; (1967). However, he is equally famous for a satirical essay entitled , which not only satirizes American culture from an anthropological perspective and, as the &quot;Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology&quot; states, &quot;...offered incipient cultural critiques of Euro-American arrogance, by showing that magic is not the prerogative of non-Western societies,&quot; but also provides &quot;a classic and apt example of how ethnocentrism can color one&#x27;s thinking.&quot;

The work was also featured in &quot;American Anthropologist.&quot;

<doc id="1066621" wikidata="Q836088" url="?curid=1066621" title="Characteristic (algebra)">
<text>In mathematics, the characteristic of a ring , often denoted , is defined to be the smallest positive number of copies of the ring&#x27;s multiplicative identity () that will sum to the additive identity (). If no such number exists, the ring is said to have characteristic zero. 

That is, is the smallest positive number such that: 
: formula_1
if such a number exists, and otherwise.

== Motivation ==
The special definition of the characteristic zero is motivated by the equivalent definitions characterized in the next section, where the characteristic zero is not required to be considered separately.

The characteristic may also be taken to be the exponent of the ring&#x27;s additive group, that is, the smallest positive integer such that:
: formula_2
for every element of the ring (again, if exists; otherwise zero). This definition applies in the more general class of rngs (see &quot;&quot;); for (unital) rings the two definitions are equivalent due to their distributive law.

== Equivalent characterizations ==
* The characteristic of a ring is the natural number such that is the kernel of the unique ring homomorphism from formula_3 to .
* The characteristic is the natural number such that contains a subring isomorphic to the factor ring formula_4, which is the image of the above homomorphism.
* When the non-negative integers are partially ordered by divisibility, then is the smallest and is the largest. Then the characteristic of a ring is the smallest value of for which . If nothing &quot;smaller&quot; (in this ordering) than will suffice, then the characteristic is . This is the appropriate partial ordering because of such facts as that is the least common multiple of and , and that no ring homomorphism exists unless divides .
* The characteristic of a ring is precisely if the statement for all implies that is a multiple of .

== Case of rings ==
If and are rings and there exists a ring homomorphism , then the characteristic of divides the characteristic of . This can sometimes be used to exclude the possibility of certain ring homomorphisms. The only ring with characteristic is the zero ring, which has only a single element . If a nontrivial ring does not have any nontrivial zero divisors, then its characteristic is either or prime. In particular, this applies to all fields, to all integral domains, and to all division rings. Any ring of characteristic is infinite.

The ring formula_4 of integers modulo has characteristic . If is a subring of , then and have the same characteristic. For example, if is prime and is an irreducible polynomial with coefficients in the field formula_6 with elements, then the quotient ring formula_7 is a field of characteristic . Another example: The field formula_8 of complex numbers contains formula_3, so the characteristic of formula_8 is .

A formula_4-algebra is equivalently a ring whose characteristic divides . This is because for every ring there is a ring homomorphism formula_12, and this map factors through formula_4 if and only if the characteristic of divides . In this case for any in the ring, then adding to itself times gives .

If a commutative ring has &quot;prime characteristic&quot; , then we have for all elements and in – the normally incorrect &quot;freshman&#x27;s dream&quot; holds for power .
The map then defines a ring homomorphism , which is called the &quot;Frobenius homomorphism&quot;. If is an integral domain it is injective.

== Case of fields ==

As mentioned above, the characteristic of any field is either or a prime number. A field of non-zero characteristic is called a field of &quot;finite characteristic&quot; or &quot;positive characteristic&quot; or &quot;prime characteristic&quot;. The &quot;characteristic exponent&quot; is defined similarly, except that it is equal to when the characteristic is ; otherwise it has the same value as the characteristic.

Any field has a unique minimal subfield, also called its prime field. This subfield is isomorphic to either the rational number field formula_14 or a finite field formula_6 of prime order. Two prime fields of the same characteristic are isomorphic, and this isomorphism is unique. In other words, there is essentially a unique prime field in each characteristic.

=== Fields of characteristic zero ===
The most common fields of &quot;characteristic zero&quot; are the subfields of the complex numbers. The p-adic fields are characteristic zero fields that are widely used in number theory. They have absolute values which are very different from those of complex numbers.

For any ordered field, such as the field of rational numbers formula_14 or the field of real numbers formula_17, the characteristic is . Thus, every algebraic number field and the field of complex numbers formula_8 are of characteristic zero.

=== Fields of prime characteristic ===
The finite field has characteristic .

There exist infinite fields of prime characteristic. For example, the field of all rational functions over formula_19, the algebraic closure of formula_19 or the field of formal Laurent series formula_21.

The size of any finite ring of prime characteristic is a power of . Since in that case it contains formula_19 it is also a vector space over that field, and from linear algebra we know that the sizes of finite vector spaces over finite fields are a power of the size of the field. This also shows that the size of any finite vector space is a prime power.

<text>Jason Peter Wood (born 24 May 1968) is an Australian politician and former police officer. He is a member of the Liberal Party and has been a member of the House of Representatives since 2013, representing the seat of La Trobe. He previously held the seat from 2004 to 2010. He was an assistant minister in the Morrison government from 2019 to 2022.

==Early life==
Wood was born on 24 May 1968 in Sutherland, New South Wales. He grew up in Ferny Creek, Victoria, attending Ferny Creek Primary School and Ferntree Gully Technical School. His final year of secondary education was completed at Boronia Secondary College. He specialised in outdoor education and briefly worked as a school camp coordinator.

Wood joined the Victoria Police in 1988 and from 1990 was a detective in the organised crime squad. He completed a graduate diploma in innovative service management and a Master of Applied Science at RMIT University. He was involved in investigating gangland figure Alphonse Gangitano. In 2003 Wood became a senior sergeant in the counter-terrorism coordination unit. &quot;The Age&quot; reported in 2004 that he was &quot;believed to be youngest senior sergeant in the force and has received various commendations&quot;.

==Political career==
Wood joined the Liberal Party in 2000. He stood unsuccessfully in the Division of Holt for the Liberal Party at the 2001 federal election. From 2002 to 2003 he was the vice-president of the party&#x27;s Boronia/Dandenong Ranges branch.

Wood was elected to the House of Representatives at the 2004 federal election, retaining the Division of La Trobe for the Liberals following the retirement of Bob Charles. From December 2004 he served on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage as well as the Joint Statutory Committee for the Australian Crime Commission.

Wood was a shadow parliamentary secretary under opposition leaders Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott from 2008 to 2010. He was defeated by Australian Labor Party candidate Laura Smyth at the 2010 election, but regained La Trobe at the 2013 election.

In 2013, he was appointed chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. During the 2016–2019 parliamentary term, Wood campaigned on law and order issues, particularly in relation to &quot;African gangs&quot;, which made up one percent of reported crimes at the time. He later said he had &quot;no regrets&quot; about the campaign and rejected claims that the Liberals campaign had racist undertones.

After winning re-election in 2019, Wood was appointed as Assistant Minister for Customs, Community Safety and Multicultural Affairs in the Morrison government. He held this position until that government’s defeat in May 2022.

In 2022, Wood was included in new opposition leader Peter Dutton&#x27;s shadow ministry with responsibility for the portfolio of community safety, migrant services and multicultural affairs.

==Political views==
In 2023, Wood was identified by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; as a member of the Centrist faction of the Liberal Party, after previously being aligned with the centre-right faction during the Morrison government years.

In a speech he made in parliament in 2009, Wood said he had often campaigned on environmental issues, had formerly supported an emissions trading scheme, and had been a member of Greenpeace for longer than he had been a member of the Liberal Party.

In 2023, Wood campaigned for the &quot;No&quot; vote in the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum.

==Personal life==
As of 2022, Wood lived with his family in Mount Dandenong, outside of his electorate.

<doc id="1066642" wikidata="Q6718588" url="?curid=1066642" title="MTVX">
<text>MTVX was an American hard rock music video channel operated by Viacom&#x27;s MTV Networks division. A sister channel of MTV, MTVX was available exclusively on digital cable providers, being the first network to be made available as part of the &quot;MTV Networks Digital Suite&quot;.

== Format ==
MTVX aired no advertising outside of MTV2 promos, airing videos on a daily loop programmed to air in three eight-hour blocks per day. The channel aired contemporary videos and older videos that were no longer shown on MTV. Likewise, MTVX was not limited to just one genre of rock music videos. The channel aired a variety of genres, including punk, metal, and grunge.

Also, MTVX showcased otherwise unknown or unheard music to the masses, such as Static-X, Disturbed, Finger Eleven, Black Label Society, SOiL, Soulfly, Sepultura, Tool, Pantera, Kittie, Dope, Coal Chamber, Primus, Mushroomhead and others.

== Closure ==
MTVX ended on May 1, 2002, and was replaced by MTV Jams, a hip hop music video channel. The last video played on MTVX was &quot;See You On The Other Side&quot; by Ozzy Osbourne. The replacement of MTVX was decried by rock music fans. MTV&#x27;s explanation, based upon ratings and Billboard chart information, was that viewers wanted a devoted network for hip hop and R&amp;B videos, rather than the alternative rock and hard rock videos that MTVX had been created to play, and claims that hard rock formats went into a quick decline post-9/11 due to industry and radio de-emphasis.

== Reuse of brand ==

In 2011 MTV began reusing the MTVX brand (with X standing here for &#x27;extended&#x27;) for &quot;a new cross-media group in charge of developing content for various platforms such as TV, computers and mobile phones.&quot; MTV launched MTVX in August The effort never resulted in any actual product or program branded by MTVX, though the brand name of MTVX remained present on MTV&#x27;s official corporate page for several years.

<doc id="1066694" wikidata="Q3343049" url="?curid=1066694" title="Salem number">
<text>In mathematics, a Salem number is a real algebraic integer formula_1 whose conjugate roots all have absolute value no greater than 1, and at least one of which has absolute value exactly 1. Salem numbers are of interest in Diophantine approximation and harmonic analysis. They are named after Raphaël Salem.

== Properties ==

Because it has a root of absolute value 1, the minimal polynomial for a Salem number must be a reciprocal polynomial. This implies that formula_2 is also a root, and that all other roots have absolute value exactly one. As a consequence α must be a unit in the ring of algebraic integers, being of norm 1.

Every Salem number is a Perron number (a real algebraic number greater than one all of whose conjugates have smaller absolute value).

== Relation with Pisot–Vijayaraghavan numbers==

The smallest known Salem number is the largest real root of Lehmer&#x27;s polynomial (named after Derrick Henry Lehmer)

:formula_3

which is about formula_4: it is conjectured that it is indeed the smallest Salem number, and the smallest possible Mahler measure of an irreducible non-cyclotomic polynomial.

Lehmer&#x27;s polynomial is a factor of the shorter degree-12 polynomial,

:formula_5

all twelve roots of which satisfy the relation

:formula_6

Salem numbers can be constructed from Pisot–Vijayaraghavan numbers. To recall, the smallest of the latter is the unique real root of the cubic polynomial,

:formula_7

known as the &quot;plastic ratio&quot; and approximately equal to 1.324718. This can be used to generate a family of Salem numbers including the smallest one found so far. The general approach is to take the minimal polynomial formula_8 of a Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number and its reciprocal polynomial, formula_9, and solve the equation,

:formula_10

for integer formula_11 above a bound. Subtracting one side from the other, factoring, and disregarding trivial factors will then yield the minimal polynomial of certain Salem numbers. For example, using the negative case of the above,

:formula_12

then for formula_13, this factors as,

:formula_14

where the decic is Lehmer&#x27;s polynomial. Using higher formula_11 will yield a family with a root approaching the plastic ratio. This can be better understood by taking formula_11th roots of both sides,

:formula_17

so as formula_11 goes higher, formula_19 will approach the solution of formula_20. If the positive case is used, then formula_19 approaches the plastic ratio from the opposite direction. Using the minimal polynomial of the next smallest Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number gives

:formula_22

which for formula_23 factors as

:formula_24

a decic not generated in the previous and has the root formula_25 which is the 5th smallest known Salem number. As formula_26, this family in turn tends towards the larger real root of formula_27.

<text>Particle is an American jam band formed in Los Angeles in 2000.

==History==
The band formed in 2000 and the original members were Dave Simmons (guitar), Steve Molitz (keyboard), Eric Gould (bass), and Darren Pujalet (drums). Simmons died shortly after the formation of the band due to a sudden illness. Guitarist Charlie Hitchcock joined shortly thereafter. Along with The Disco Biscuits, Sound Tribe Sector 9, and Lotus the group was among the first to blend rock, jazz, funk, and electronica into the milieu of what has been dubbed livetronica (a subgenre of the jam band movement where live bands blend the structures of DJ-produced sequenced electronic music into a more traditional live band setting). Prior to 2006, the band&#x27;s repertoire consisted entirely of instrumental material.

The group made a name for itself and built an enthusiastic fan base, known as Particle People, by performing energetic late-night sets at festivals such as Bonnaroo, where they played a set of over five hours to 20,000 people. They played up to 140 shows a year, often to large audiences. Reliance on word of mouth from fans, rather than advertising, allowed this group to sell out venues such as the Bowery Ballroom in New York City before they finally released their much anticipated first album, &quot;Launchpad&quot;, in early 2004, on which they worked with producer Tom Rothrock. In April and May 2005 the group toured with former Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart as Hydra; the tour received mixed reviews from many Deadheads who were unaccustomed to Particle&#x27;s electronic-based approach. Bassist Phil Lesh, also of the Grateful Dead, sat in with the band that summer.

They followed &quot;Launchpad&quot; with the EP &quot;Launchpad Remixes&quot;, featuring tracks from the album remixed by members of Groove Armada and Sugar Daddy. In 2005 the band toured Europe for the first time.

Following their performance on the Xingolati Cruise in late 2005 the band dismissed Hitchcock from the group. This was a source of controversy in the months that followed, because the band&#x27;s website stated that the departure was a mutual decision. Hitchcock, however, vehemently disagreed and went public by stating that he was summarily fired and was never able to overcome a &quot;hired hand&quot; stigma from the other bandmembers despite joining a mere six performances after the group&#x27;s formation.

Replacing Hitchcock were Ben Combe and Scott Metzger on guitars and vocals. Their first two performance with the group in February 2006 was recorded, filmed, and released as &quot;Transformations: Live for the People&quot; that July. Featuring guest appearances by experimental rap duo Blackalicious, Robby Krieger of The Doors, guitarist Joe Satriani, and DJ Logic, the album showcased the band exploring vocal-based music as well as incorporating more overt rock and hip hop influences.

In late July 2006 Scott Metzger had to leave Particle due to a family emergency that required his long-term attention.

In October 2007 Ben Combe announced his departure from Particle and pursued a Biotech degree until April 2012. A July 2008 side project, PUJA, brought together Combe and Darren Pujalet of Particle, as well as Melvin Seals of The Jerry Garcia Band and Cristian Basso of Leo Nocentelli and Little Hercules.

In 2008 Molitz also played in the supergroup Agents of Mayhem.

Particle shows since 2008 have featured Josh Clark of Tea Leaf Green, Michael Kang of The String Cheese Incident, Dan Lebowitz of Animal Liberation Orchestra, Lucas Bingham of Free Band Radio, Pete Wall (sax) of The Motet as well as former Particle members Ben Combe and Charlie Hitchcock.

==Musical style==
The band is regarded as a jam-band with progressive rock roots. They have described their music as &quot;space porn funk&quot;, a term coined by one of their early fans, and &quot;funktronic&quot;. Allmusic writer Hal Horowitz, reviewing &quot;Launchpad&quot; described their music as having &quot;a loose &#x27;70s feel that mixes elements of Pink Floyd&#x27;s prog rock and Return to Forever-styled jazz fusion with insistent dance beats that shift from funk to near disco&quot;. Philip Booth, reviewing &quot;Launchpad&quot; for &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; described their music as &quot;fusion in the non-jazz sense&quot;, commenting on the &quot;trance, house, and drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass rhythms heard throughout&quot;, and calling the album an &quot;unstoppable blast of gritty electronic jam&quot;. A review by Nicole Keiper in &quot;The Tennessean&quot; described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot; jam-rock standards that make smart use of dance music&#x27;s lush textures and well-placed, good-and-solid dancefloor thumps&quot;. Chris Nelson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described them as &quot;disco-flavored, instrumental jam music&quot;.

Lawrence was born in Calgary, Alberta, and grew up in Ottawa, Ontario. He was educated at Ashbury College and at Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. He enlisted in the army with the rank of Lieutenant in the 8th Reconnaissance Regiment (VIII Recce). He landed in Normandy in the first week of July 1944. He was decorated with the Military Cross by King George VI for engineering a bridge in an advance action at the Risle River near Brionne, France. He was injured twice including during V2 rocket attack near Antwerp in October 1944. Lawrence reflected on his narrow escapes from death. He wrote in his journal, &quot;Keeping alive consists of 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent soldiering.&quot; He returned to action in February 1945 and participated to the end of the fighting. He was promoted to captain at the end of the war.

When he returned home he acquired a law degree at Osgoode Hall Law School. He graduated in 1948 and went to work for an Ottawa firm called Honeywell, Baker, Gibson, and Wotherspoon. He married Lois Davidson in October 1949 and they raised four children. He died in Gatineau, Quebec in 2007.

==Politics==
In the 1950s he was elected to Gloucester, Ontario town council for two terms. In the 1956 Federal Conservative leadership convention he organized the campaign for Davie Fulton. While there was little chance of winning, his wife Lois said that he enjoyed immensely. She said, &quot;They were so young, it was like they were lambs to slaughter. It was absolutely all-absorbing for what seemed like a month. There was huge hoopla and excitement.&quot;

In the 1963 provincial election, Lawrence ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the riding of Russell. He narrowly defeated Liberal candidate Fred Barrett by only 413 votes. In 1967 he ran in the redistributed riding of Carleton East. He defeated Liberal Eugene Bellemare by a comfortable margin of 4,221 votes. He was re-elected in 1971.

In 1969, Ontario Premier John Robarts brought Lawrence into the cabinet as minister without portfolio. In February 1970, he was promoted to Minister of Financial and Commercial Affairs. In March 1971 he was shuffled to Minister of Health.

During his time as Minister, he began to promote the idea of no-fault insurance, the first time it was discussed in the province. Lawrence felt that the current system was unfair to consumers as judgments were applied unevenly. While he felt this would benefit consumers he did not push hard on the issue due to his mindfulness of Ontario Insurance companies.

He ran in the 1971 leadership convention to succeed Robarts, and came in fifth place. The new premier, Bill Davis, appointed him as Minister of Health. In February 1972, he was assigned to the super-ministry post of Provincial Secretary for Resource Development. In March 1972, he flew to Cuba on a government jet to talk about trade. He defended the trip because he met with Cuban government officials and said that he had opened a number of doors. He was roundly criticized in the media and his influence was diminished as a result. In 1974 he said, &quot;At that time, the government, the media and the public were much more resentful of Cuba&#x27;s political position than they are today, and they were less appreciative of the trade opportunities than they are today.&quot;

Lawrence was dropped from cabinet altogether in February 1974. He decided to retire from the legislature later on in September. He returned to his law practice.

He attempted a move to federal politics by running as the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidate for Ottawa—Carleton in the 1980 federal election but was defeated by Liberal Jean-Luc Pépin.

<text>Vallisneria (named in honor of Antonio Vallisneri) is a genus of freshwater aquatic plant, commonly called eelgrass, tape grass or vallis. The genus is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, and North America.

&quot;Vallisneria&quot; is a submerged plant that spreads by runners and sometimes forms tall underwater meadows. Leaves arise in clusters from their roots. The leaves have rounded tips, and definite raised veins. Single white female flowers grow to the water surface on very long stalks. Male flowers grow on short stalks, become detached, and float to the surface. It is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants. The fruit is a banana-like capsule having many tiny seeds.

Sometimes it is confused with the superficially similar &quot;Sagittaria&quot; when grown submerged.

This plant should not be confused with &quot;Zostera&quot; species, marine seagrasses that are usually also given the common name &quot;eelgrass&quot;. &quot;Vallisneria&quot; has arched stems which cross over small obstacles and develop small planters at their nodes.

==Use in aquaria==

Various strains of &quot;Vallisneria&quot; are commonly kept in tropical and subtropical aquaria. 
These include dwarf forms such as &quot;Vallisneria tortifolia&quot;, a variety with leaves around 15 to 20 cm in length and characterised by having thin, tightly coiled leaves. A medium-sized variety, &quot;Vallisneria spiralis&quot; is also very popular, typically having leaves 30 to 60 cm in length. The largest varieties are often called &quot;Vallisneria gigantea&quot; regardless of their actual taxonomic designation; most of the plants sold as &quot;Vallisneria gigantea&quot; are actually &quot;Vallisneria americana.&quot; Similarly, some &quot;Vallisneria gigantea&quot; are sold as &quot;Vallisneria spiralis&quot; and these giant varieties are only suitable for very large tanks, having leaves that frequently exceed 1 m in length, but are quite hardy and will do well in tanks with big fish that might uproot more delicate aquarium plants.

With few exceptions, the commonly traded &quot;Vallisneria&quot; are tolerant and adaptable. While they do best under bright illumination they will do well under moderate lighting as well, albeit with slower growth rates. They are not picky about substrate, and will accept plain gravel provided an iron-rich fertiliser is added to the water periodically. Once settled in, they multiply readily through the production of daughter plants at the end of runners (as mentioned above). Once they have established their own roots, these daughter plants can be cut away and transplanted if necessary. &quot;Vallisneria&quot; will accept neutral to alkaline water conditions (they do not like very acidic conditions) and do not require carbon dioxide fertilization. They are also among the few commonly traded aquarium plants that tolerate brackish water, provided the specific gravity does not exceed 1.003 (around 10 percent the salinity of normal sea water).

<doc id="1066721" wikidata="Q497942" url="?curid=1066721" title="Moe (slang)">
<text>, sometimes romanized as moé, is a Japanese word that refers to feelings of strong affection mainly towards characters in anime, manga, video games, and other media directed at the &quot;otaku&quot; market. &quot;Moe&quot;, however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject.

&quot;Moe&quot; is related to neoteny and the feeling of &quot;cuteness&quot; a character can evoke. The word &quot;moe&quot; originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use. &quot;Moe&quot; characters have expanded through Japanese media, and the concept has been commercialised. Contests, both online and in the real world, exist for &quot;moe&quot;-styled things, including one run by one of the Japanese game rating boards. Various notable commentators such as Tamaki Saitō, Hiroki Azuma, and Kazuya Tsurumaki have also given their take on &quot;moe&quot; and its meaning.

==Meaning ==
&quot;Moe&quot; used in slang refers to feelings of affection, adoration, devotion, and excitement felt towards characters that appear in manga, anime, video games, and other media (usually Japanese). Characters that elicit feelings of &quot;moe&quot; are called &quot;&quot;moe&quot; characters&quot;. The word has also evolved to be used regarding all kinds of topics. Included in the meaning of the word is the idea that &quot;deep feelings felt towards a particular subject&quot; is used in cases where a simple &quot;like&quot; is not enough to express the feeling. The common feature in all feelings of &quot;moe&quot; is that the subject of such feelings is something that one cannot possibly have a real relationship with, like a fictional character, a pop idol, or an inorganic substance. It can be considered a kind of &quot;pseudo-romance&quot;, but it is not always seen to be the same as &quot;romance&quot;.

==Origins==
The term&#x27;s origin and etymology are unknown. Anime columnist John Oppliger has outlined several popular theories describing how the term would have stemmed from the name of anime heroines, such as Hotaru Tomoe from &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; (Tomoe is written as , relevant kanji is the same) or Moe Sagisawa from the 1993 anime &quot;Kyōryū Wakusei&quot;. The term first became popular in 1993-94 among users of Japanese bulletin board systems.

Psychologist Tamaki Saitō identifies it as coming from the Japanese word for &quot;budding&quot;, . Ken Kitabayashi of the Nomura Research Institute has defined &quot;moe&quot; as &quot;being strongly attracted to one&#x27;s ideals&quot;. Kitabayashi has identified the word &quot;moe&quot; to be a pun with the Japanese godan verb for &#x27;to sprout&#x27;, , and its homophone &#x27;to burn&#x27;, . Along the same line of thought, Kitabayashi has identified it to be a pun with the Japanese ichidan verb for &#x27;to sprout&#x27; and its homophone &#x27;to burn&#x27; , which mean &#x27;to burn&#x27; (in the sense of one&#x27;s heart burning, or burning with passion).

Anthropologist Patrick Galbraith cites Morikawa Kaichirō, who argues that the term came from internet message boards such as NIFTY-Serve and Tokyo BBS in the 1990s, from fans discussing &quot;bishõjo&quot; (beautiful girl) characters. Galbraith argues that &quot;moe&quot; has its roots in the development of &quot;bishõjo&quot; characters in Japanese subcultures in the 1970s and 80s. This was exemplified in the &quot;lolicon&quot; boom of the 1980s, a &quot;fertile ground&quot; for the &quot;budding desire for fictional characters&quot;.

Comiket organiser Ichikawa Koichi has described Lum from &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; as being both the source of &quot;moe&quot; and the first &quot;tsundere&quot;. The character of Clarisse from Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; (1979) has also been cited as a potential ancestral example, with Lupin acting like an older brother to Clarisse and taunting Count Cagliostro for marrying someone half his age. According to culture critic Hiroki Azuma, as Rei Ayanami from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; became a more prominent character among fans, she &quot;changed the rules&quot; governing what people regarded as &quot;moe&quot;-inspiring. The industry has since created many characters which share her traits of pale skin, blue hair and a &quot;quiet personality&quot;.

==Usage==

===Commercial application===


&quot;Moe&quot; characters have expanded within the Japanese media market. In 2003, the market for &quot;moe&quot; media such as printed media, video, and games was worth 88 billion yen; roughly one-third of the estimated 290 billion yen &quot;otaku&quot; market in Japan. In 2009, Brad Rice, editor-in-chief of &quot;Japanator&quot;, said that &quot;moe has literally become an economic force&quot; saying that more products use some element of &quot;moe&quot; in order to sell better. Rice also goes on to say that &quot;moe&quot; is used to get anime and manga works out to &quot;hardcore fans who buy excessive amounts of items related to the character of their desire.&quot;

John Oppliger from AnimeNation traced the first decade of the 2000s as the time when &quot;moe&quot; became increasingly popular and recognized. Commercialization was a result of interest that followed, and &quot;moe&quot; evolved from being a non-sexual desire to being a sexually sublimated fascination with cuteness. Oppliger goes on to say that &quot;moe&quot; shifted entirely from an interchange between character and viewer, to a focused fetish of viewers. Examples used by Oppliger include the series; &quot;K-On&quot;, &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, and &quot;Moetan&quot; where he points out they are &quot;revolved around adorable, whimsical, clumsy, early-adolescent girl characters in order to evoke, enflame, and manipulate the interests and affections of viewers.&quot; Rather than evoking &quot;moe&quot; feelings, they were literally &quot;moe&quot; characters that had defining characteristics of the &quot;moe&quot; style. Oppliger referred to these girl characters as &quot;adorably cute, just a bit sexually appealing, and self-conscious but not yet cynical&quot; going on to say that they demand notice and adoration, rather than passively earning it.

With &quot;moe&quot; anthropomorphism, &quot;moe&quot; characteristics are applied to give human elements to non-human objects. The &quot;Gradius&quot; video game series features a spaceship named &quot;Vic Viper&quot;. For a spin-off game, &quot;moe&quot; is applied to &quot;Vic Viper&quot; to create &quot;Otomedius&quot;.

===Sexual attraction===
Sometimes feelings of &quot;moe&quot; towards fictional characters include &quot;sexual excitement&quot;, or are understood in the context where &quot;lots of beautiful girls and boobs appear.&quot; In these cases, feelings of pure affection that gradually become stronger over time can lead to these feelings of eroticism. In addition, it is pointed that sexual desire oriented to such characters differs from a desire toward humans.

&quot;Moe&quot;, however, is also considered to be distinct from pure lust. While small amounts of lust is generally considered &quot;moe&quot;, a feeling that focuses too heavily on lust is considered outside the scope of &quot;moe&quot;. According to commentator, who considers &quot;moe&quot; to be &quot;romance within one&#x27;s head&quot;, the ideal kind of love within &quot;moe&quot; is &quot;romantic love&quot;.

===Contests===
Several informal contests or rankings for characters considered to be &quot;moe&quot; exist on the internet. One such contest is the &quot;Anime Saimoe Tournament&quot;, organized by members of the textboard 2channel, which ran every year from 2002, until its cancellation after the 2014 contest due to declining interest. &quot;Moe&quot; characters from the fiscal year starting 1 July and ending 30 June the following year were eligible. Each tournament had at least 280 &quot;moe&quot; characters. Spin-offs of the Saimoe Tournament include RPG Saimoe, which has video game characters, and SaiGAR, a competition between the &quot;manliest men of anime&quot;. In 2006 and 2007, the Saimoe Tournament became an increasingly international event; 2channel users obliged foreign &quot;otaku&quot; by putting up an English version of their rules page. The &quot;International Saimoe League&quot;, also known as ISML, is another online &quot;moe&quot; popularity contest that is for a worldwide audience. The contest started in 2008 and was held annually. Initially, only female characters were eligible, a male exhibition tournament was added in 2011, which would take place after the end of the main tournament. It was made into an official tournament alongside the female characters in 2015.

Moe contests also exist in magazine publications, and in the real world. The Moe Game Awards are given annually to bishōjo games published that year in various categories, such as background music, character design, fandisc, graphics, and erotic content. They were started in 2006 as the Bishōjo Game Awards, but their name was changed to Moe Game Awards in 2009. It is sponsored by the Japanese game rating board Ethics Organization of Computer Software (EOCS) and is described by them as &quot;an R18 game industry version of the Academy Awards&quot;. Magazines that have &quot;moe&quot; contests in them include the Japanese magazine &quot;Dengeki Moeoh&quot; which runs a column called and features the top 10 &quot;moe&quot; characters of the month, as determined by reader votes.

==Commentary==
There are various interpretations of the concept of &quot;moe&quot;, and the subject has been heavily discussed. Psychologist Tamaki Saitō considers the &quot;moe&quot; used by &quot;otaku&quot; to be the embodiment of their particular kind of sexuality. Saitō points out that while &quot;otaku&quot; creations fulfill an abnormal impression of sexuality, few &quot;otaku&quot; actually apply this impression to real life. He thus argues that &quot;moe&quot; is something that sustains the otaku&#x27;s sexuality within a fictional world, with the fiction itself being their subject of desire and having no need for reality.

On the other hand, critic Hiroki Azuma rejects Saitō&#x27;s argument as &quot;too complicated.&quot; Azuma argues that &quot;to &quot;moe&quot;&quot; is simply the act of analyzing each of the character&#x27;s &quot;moe&quot; characteristics and expanding on those characteristics within the mind, and thus differs from mere feelings of empathy. These characteristics can be physical ones, such as cat ears or a maid costume, or a personality archetype, such as that of the character Rei Ayanami. Azuma sees this process as an &quot;otaku&quot;&#x27;s act of satisfying their desires among their limited relations, and considers it to be part of a broader trend of &quot;animalization,&quot; or the fulfillment of small desires isolated from the context of a grand narrative. Azuma, therefore, simplifies Saitō&#x27;s idea of &quot;moe&quot; into the idea of attaining signals of sexual excitement within an isolated environment, similar to the act of training an animal.

In contrast, Tōru Honda argues against the idea that &quot;moe&quot; is simply &quot;the act of arousal in response to signals, and thus animalization&quot; and argues that this interpretation does not allow one to recall the essence of &quot;moe&quot;. Honda considers &quot;moe&quot; to be the act of remembering ideals among the background signals, an act of necessity that arose as the romance rejected by religion continued to be supported by materialism, and thus interprets it as a mental activity relevant to the contexts of mythology and religion. Furthermore, Honda asserts that this &quot;animalization&quot; phenomenon only arose after the &quot;economic bubble&quot; period of Japan, when people consumed real romance- and sex-like products, and says that since &quot;moe&quot; is commonly interpreted to be in competition with the act of searching for romance in real life, it is thus the antithesis of male-dominant machoism. Also, while Saitō does not distinguish &quot;moe&quot; from more violent types of sexual abnormalities and speaks of &quot;moe&quot; in the context of &quot;sentō bishōjo&quot; (beautiful fighting girl), Honda on the other hand treats &quot;moe&quot; as the polar opposite of the hunter-ish kind of sexuality featuring in more fiendish works like those by Henry Darger.

Anime director Kazuya Tsurumaki defines &quot;moe&quot; to be &quot;the act of filling in missing information about characters on one&#x27;s own.&quot; Accepting this view, writer explains that characters are born from human instinct, which is the exact reason why one can be charmed by them much more than one could by real people. Toshio Okada says that while he himself has not fully understood &quot;moe&quot;, he defines it as not simply being stirred emotionally by beautiful girls, but also as the meta-viewpoint of seeing oneself falling into such a state.

In &quot;The Moe Manifesto&quot;, anthropologist Patrick Galbraith defines &quot;moe&quot; as an affective response to fictional characters or representations of them. The applications of this definition are widespread to political, economic, and cultural discourses. For an example in practice, Matthew Brummer describes how Japan&#x27;s Self Defense Force utilizes popular culture and the &quot;moe&quot; that it engenders to shape public perceptions of the military establishment: The Manga Military.

<doc id="1066740" wikidata="Q157371" url="?curid=1066740" title="Zostera">
<text>Zostera is a small genus of widely distributed seagrasses, commonly called marine eelgrass, or simply seagrass or eelgrass. The genus &quot;Zostera&quot; contains 15 species.

==Ecology==
&quot;Zostera marina&quot; is found on sandy substrates or in estuaries, usually submerged or partially floating. Most &quot;Zostera&quot; are perennial. They have long, bright green, ribbon-like leaves, the width of which are about . Short stems grow up from extensive, white branching rhizomes. The flowers are enclosed in the sheaths of the leaf bases; the fruits are bladdery and can float.

&quot;Zostera&quot; beds are important for sediment deposition, substrate stabilization, as substrate for epiphytic algae and micro-invertebrates, and as nursery grounds for many species of economically important fish and shellfish. &quot;Zostera&quot; often forms beds in bay mud in the estuarine setting. It is an important food for brant geese and wigeons, and even (occasionally) caterpillars of the grass moth &quot;Dolicharthria punctalis&quot;.

The slime mold &quot;Labyrinthula zosterae&quot; can cause the wasting disease of &quot;Zostera&quot;, with &quot;Z. marina&quot; being particularly susceptible, causing a decrease in the populations of the fauna that depend on &quot;Zostera&quot;.

&quot;Zostera&quot; is able to maintain its turgor at a constant pressure in response to fluctuations in environmental osmolarity. It achieves this by losing solutes as the tide goes out and gaining solutes as the tide comes in.

==Distribution==

The genus as a whole is widespread throughout seashores of much of the Northern Hemisphere as well as Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia and southern Africa. The discovery of &quot;Z. chilensis&quot; in 2005 adds an isolated population on the Pacific coast of South America to the distribution. One species (&quot;Z. noltii&quot;) occurs along the land-locked Caspian Sea.

==Uses==
Eelgrass has been used for food by the Seri tribe of Native Americans on the coast of Sonora, Mexico. The rhizomes and leaf-bases of eelgrass were eaten fresh or dried into cakes for winter food. It was also used for smoking deer meat. The Seri language has many words related to eelgrass and eelgrass-harvesting. The month of April is called &quot;xnoois ihaat iizax&quot;, literally &quot;the month when the eelgrass seed is mature&quot;.

&quot;Zostera&quot; has also been used as packing material and as stuffing for mattresses and cushions.

On the Danish island of Læsø it has been used for thatching roofs. Roofs of eelgrass are said to be heavy, but also much longer-lasting and easier to thatch and maintain than roofs done with more conventional thatching material.
More recently, the plant has been used in its dried form for insulation in eco-friendly houses and as a ground cover in permaculture gardens, once its salt layer washed off (ex: Friland, Danish eco-village).

In the United States, eelgrass insulation was commercially marketed in the early 1900s as Cabot&#x27;s Quilt by the Samuel Cabot Co of Boston. However, due to an outbreak of &quot;Labyrinthula zosterae&quot; which destroyed crops of eelgrass, combined with the collapse of the homebuilding industry due to the great depression, it went out of production and was replaced in new homes with fiberglass (introduced in the late 1930s).

Some studies show promise for eelgrass meadows to sequester atmospheric carbon to reduce anthropogenic climate change.

&quot;Zostera&quot; can also be utilized to produce biomass energy using the Jean Pain method.

The top is roughly hip-length, and is wrapped left over right, with the internal ties fastened before the external ones.

Traditional are made from hemp or cotton, and are typically dyed a solid colour – such as indigo, blue or green – with either a muted or nonexistent pattern. Modern frequently feature prints ranging from simple textures to complicated and colourful floral patterns. Ladies&#x27; tend to be more brightly coloured, and often feature prints of popular culture characters and motifs.

<doc id="1066776" wikidata="Q775670" url="?curid=1066776" title="First Whig Junto">
<text>The First Whig Junto controlled the government of England from 1694 to 1699 and was the first part of the Whig Junto, a of people who controlled the most important political decisions. The Junto was reappointed twice following the elections of 1695 and 1698.

==History==
The Whig elite rose to government ascendancy while Lord Danby held office through three shortly-spaced changes of Sovereign (dating to the Royal-dominated ministries of Charles II). The Junto established its dominance in 1694 with the appointment of Sir Charles Montagu as Chancellor of the Exchequer on 10 May. Danby, who had been created Duke of Leeds on 4 May, remained in office, under a diminished role while still Lord President of the Council, but the Junto controlled the government of England from 1694 to 1699.

It was led by six prominent members: Montagu, John Somers, Wharton, Romney, Orford, and Shrewsbury. Supporting these peers were two unofficial whips in the House of Lords: the earls of Sunderland and Portland. Only one of these held at the time an office, albeit less senior, as Lord Chamberlain. The Whig Party held a majority in the House of Commons after the election in 1695, although not all Whig MPs were unswervingly loyal to the Junto.

The Junto oversaw the creation of the Bank of England in 1694, but by 1699 the Junto&#x27;s power had declined in the face of opposition by Robert Harley and the Tories. Many members of the Junto would return to government from 1706 to 1710 as part of the Godolphin-Marlborough ministry.

==Ministry==

The government was led by the six most prominent members of the Junto.

Other members of the ministry had less power.

James Vernon was appointed Secretary of State in 1697, with responsibility for the Northern Department. The following year, after the Duke of Shrewsbury left the government, he took responsibility for the Southern Department as well.

<text>The acting U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey is the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey. On January 9, 2025, Vikas Khanna assumed the role as acting U.S. attorney. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey has jurisdiction over all cases prosecuted by the U.S. attorney.

<doc id="1066794" wikidata="Q4793872" url="?curid=1066794" title="Armscor M16 22">
<text>The Armscor M1600 is a semi-automatic rifle made by Armscor (formerly Squires Bingham Co.). The rifle bears a resemblance to the AR-15/M16 family of firearms, but is chambered in .22 LR. As they are two entirely different firearms, there is no interchangeability of parts.

There are some prominent differences between the two. For example, the carry handle on the M16 22 is considerably smaller and moved further forward along the body of the rifle than the Colt, and the stock of the Armscor model is made of wood as opposed to plastic. There is also a model with a collapsible stock (designated M1600R). The rifle was conceived out of want of an M16-like rifle in .22 caliber. This is a reasonably accurate semi-automatic rifle for plinking.

As compared to the AR-15-style rifles, chambered in 5,56x45mm cartridge, the M1600 has less recoil, as it is chambered in the weaker .22LR (LR standing for long rifle) making it easier to handle. This rifle is suitable for hunting small game.

<doc id="1066798" wikidata="Q382723" url="?curid=1066798" title="George Cabot">
<text>George Cabot (1751 or 1752April 18, 1823) was an American merchant, seaman, and politician from Massachusetts. He represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate and was the presiding officer of the infamous Hartford Convention.

During and after his term in the Senate, Cabot was a major figure in the Hamiltonian faction of the Federalist Party and was a vocal supporter of war with Revolutionary France.

==Early life==
Cabot was born in Salem, Massachusetts. His father was Joseph Cabot, a ship merchant. His mother was Elizabeth Higginson. George was the seventh of ten siblings, including John Cabot ( 1745), Joseph Cabot Jr. ( 1746), and Samuel Cabot ( 1758). The Cabot family is originally from Jersey and Norman-French.

In 1766, Cabot enrolled at Harvard College. After two years there, his father died. George inherited 600 pounds and rather than become a charge on his father&#x27;s estate, dropped out to go to sea, where he became a cabin boy on the ship of his brother-in-law Joseph Lee. By the age of 21, he was captain of his own ship. While traveling, he became fluent in French and Spanish.

==Business career==
In 1775, Cabot and Lee formed a partnership in Beverly, Massachusetts, as merchants, trading the same goods they had transported as sailors.

===American Revolution===
During the American Revolution, the Cabot family were ardent patriots. Cabot ships served as privateer vessels, raiding British merchants to support the revolutionary cause and turning a profit in the process. Some of their ships were captained by the famous privateer Hugh Hill.

Some time after the Revolution, Cabot&#x27;s business took him to New York City, where he was acquainted with Alexander Hamilton, who became a lifelong friend and political ally. The visit strengthened Cabot&#x27;s preference for a strong federal government and led to his founding membership in the Federalist Party.

His business interests were suspended in 1794, during his service as Senator.

==Early political career==
Cabot&#x27;s political career began in 1775, when he became a member of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. In 1777, Cabot was elected as Beverly town fire-ward and director and president of the Bridge Company, tasked with constructing the Essex Bridge, which first connected Beverly with Salem across the Danvers River.

In 1777, the town of Beverly voted to reject the proposed Massachusetts Constitution, and Cabot was a member of a committee selected to draft objections. He opposed the proposed system of weighted representation and price controls, but was unsuccessful. That constitution was ultimately rejected by voters.

In August 1780, he was elected to the convention for a new Massachusetts Constitution. Populist Governor John Hancock, who supported the failed 1778 Constitution, accused his conservative opponents of being controlled by an &quot;Essex Junto,&quot; including Cabot, which soon became a popular invective metonym.

In 1788, Cabot was a delegate to the Massachusetts convention to ratify the new United States Constitution, which he strongly supported. Along with Rufus King, Theophilus Parsons, and Fisher Ames, he successfully engineered Massachusetts ratification by persuading Hancock and Samuel Adams to support ratification.

In 1789, President George Washington breakfasted with Cabot at the latter&#x27;s Beverly home when he was in town inspecting the country&#x27;s first cotton mill and the new Essex Bridge.

==U.S. Senate==
===2nd United States Congress (1791–1793)===
In 1791, midway through the first presidential term of George Washington, Cabot was elected to the U.S. Senate. During his time in the Senate, he was principally concerned with finance and commerce, and was a supporter of his friend Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s policies as Secretary of the Treasury.

During his first Congress, Cabot was a member of the Committee on Appropriations and chair of the Committee on Fisheries. He became a founding member of the new Federalist Party, led by Hamilton and Vice President John Adams. Hamilton frequently consulted with Cabot on matters of revenue, commerce, and manufacturing. Cabot&#x27;s bill to subsidize fishermen became a major feature of Hamilton&#x27;s economic program.

Throughout the Congress, tensions with the Jeffersonian faction intensified both in the capital of Philadelphia and in the newspapers. Party differences were deepened by the ongoing French Revolution, which drew Jeffersonian support and Federalist revulsion. Cabot himself stood out as an ardent Francophobe, and by extension, an Anglophile. After the Genêt affair, Cabot called for the French ambassador&#x27;s dismissal and personally persuaded Vice President Adams to urge Washington to remove Genêt.

===3rd United States Congress (1793–1795)===
In his second Congress, Cabot opposed Secretary Jefferson&#x27;s attempts at establishing favorable trade with France, blocking the election of Jeffersonian Albert Gallatin of Pennsylvania to the Senate. He remained a leader in matters of commerce and finance and helped pass a bill laying the groundwork for a national Navy. In 1793, he was named a director of the First Bank of the United States.

Amid rising United States tensions with Great Britain, Cabot joined Senators Rufus King, Oliver Ellsworth, and Caleb Strong in calling for the appointment of Hamilton as special minister to negotiate a treaty with Britain. However, the public clamor that would be aroused by Hamilton&#x27;s appointment led Washington to appoint John Jay instead. Though he thought it less than ideal, Cabot was one of the most uncompromising defenders of the resulting Jay Treaty with Great Britain as the best possible compromise at a time when war would have destroyed the Union.

===4th United States Congress (1795–1796)===
During the debate over the Jay Treaty in his final Congress, Jefferson accused Cabot of supporting the dissolution of the Union, based on Cabot&#x27;s belief that rejection of the treaty would lead to ruinous war. Jefferson also quoted Cabot as supporting a &quot;President for life and an hereditary Senate.&quot;

In May 1796, Cabot returned to Massachusetts and resigned from office, citing the growing bitterness and personal character of Philadelphia politics. He waited until his friend Benjamin Goodhue was elected as his successor, then promptly sent his resignation to the Massachusetts General Court. It became effective in June.

==John Adams era (1797–1801)==
Shortly after Cabot&#x27;s resignation from the Senate, fellow Massachusetts Federalist John Adams was elected to the presidency. Though he did not actively participate in the campaign, Cabot supported Adams over Hamilton&#x27;s preferred choice, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, the current Minister to France.

===Quasi-War===
As a private citizen, Cabot remained intensely interested in the progress of the French Revolution and intensely opposed to the Francophile policy of Thomas Jefferson, now serving as Vice President. He wrote that &quot;the first and highest duty of the electors was to prevent the election of a French President.&quot; Hamilton and Fisher Ames each urged the appointment of Cabot as part of a three-man mission to France, but Washington and Adams each declined. Adams instead chose Elbridge Gerry, whose reputation in France, particularly with French Foreign Minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, was more positive.

Cabot himself was opposed to the appointment of such a commission, believing that the time for negotiation with France had passed. After Pinckney&#x27;s dismissal as Minister to France, Cabot called for war measures against France, including opposition to the establishment of any embassy whatsoever. He firmly believed that any continued diplomacy with France would only encourage Jacobinism in the United States.
In the winter of 1797–98, tensions with France escalated. Cabot, along with Pickering, Ames, Oliver Wolcott, and James McHenry, formed the faction of &quot;war Federalists&quot; led by Hamilton. They opposed the moderate (mostly southern) Federalists and Jefferson&#x27;s Republicans, who sought peace with France at any cost.

In March, President Adams declared to Congress that negotiations had failed and that the United States must arm for potential war. The revelation of the XYZ affair effectively silenced all opposition and enabled Federalists to pass legislation creating a separate Department of the Navy. Adams appointed Cabot as the first United States Secretary of the Navy, but Cabot refused the appointment. Benjamin Stoddert filled the position in his place.

Cabot became involved in the debate over the organization of a provisional army. Former President Washington suggested Hamilton, Pinckney, and former Secretary of War Henry Knox, in that order, serve as major generals. Despite this, Adams granted Knox the first rank. Cabot sided with Washington, Hamilton, and other leading Federalists in objecting to Knox&#x27;s elevation; President Adams gave in, but the entire affair created divisions within the Federalists. Some Federalists suggested the Jeffersonian Elbridge Gerry, now returned from his mission to France, had undue influence over Adams&#x27;s decision-making.

In 1799, Adams, without consulting his cabinet, appointed Minister to the Netherlands William Vans Murray to lead a commission to renew peace negotiations with France, disappointing the war Federalists. Cabot remained strictly opposed to any negotiation with France without first advances toward reconciliation by the French.

Despite his ardent opposition to Adams&#x27;s policy toward France, Cabot sought to reconcile the factions within the Federalist Party, for fear of the party&#x27;s destruction. Despite his efforts and frequent correspondence with leaders of both factions, the Federalist Party divided between the Adams and Pinckney-Hamilton campaigns through the remainder of 1799.

===Alien and Sedition Acts===
Cabot&#x27;s distance from the Adams administration also grew over the Alien and Sedition Acts. Cabot defended John Marshall, a Federalist opponent of the Acts, to the shock of Cabot&#x27;s friend Fisher Ames.

===Campaign of 1800===
As the 1800 campaign approached and Adams prepared to seek a second term, tensions within the Federalist Party were exacerbated by the publication of the 1792 Tench Coxe letter, in which Adams insinuated that the Pinckney family were British sympathizers, and the death of President Washington. At this point, Adams dismissed Pinckney as Secretary of State; Cabot understood this as &quot;the complete abandonment by Mr. Adams of all the best principles of the Federalist Party.&quot; Cabot was also distressed by the use of &quot;British sympathies&quot; as a bludgeon against critics of Adams.

When Adams returned to Quincy in the spring, Cabot made no effort to visit him.

While Hamilton openly supported Pinckney for President over Adams, Cabot felt such a course was impossible and instead supported an equal electoral vote for Adams and Pinckney, to be resolved by the House of Representatives and urged Hamilton not to attack Adams openly. Hamilton disregarded these pleas, publishing his attack on Adams. Though they remained friends, Cabot strongly admonished Hamilton for damaging Federalists&#x27; chances in the election.

==Jeffersonian era (1801–1811)==
After Adams&#x27;s loss in the 1800 election, Cabot withdrew from politics. He played no part in Hamilton&#x27;s plot to elect Aaron Burr over Thomas Jefferson in the 1801 contingent election, though he still passively opposed Jefferson&#x27;s administration. Though he supported the appointments of James Madison and Albert Gallatin to Jefferson&#x27;s cabinet, Cabot saw the 1800 election as the total defeat of the Federalist Party, and his mantra became, &quot;Things must grow worse before they are better.&quot;

Cabot tended to his Brookline farm for a time, but grew tired of the work and leased his estate to a tenant. He remained President of the U.S. Bank of Boston, and occasionally entertained friends who were in Boston on business.

The deaths of his son Edward in 1803 and his friend Alexander Hamilton in 1804 put Cabot in a period of mourning, both for his personal loss and the loss of any conceivable future for the Hamiltonians. Cabot sold some lands to provide for Hamilton&#x27;s family.

Cabot opposed Jefferson&#x27;s acquisition of the Louisiana Territory and his removals of Federalist appointees and judges, but resisted Timothy Pickering&#x27;s calls for dissolution of the Union.

===Tensions with England===
In 1805, Cabot made his only public pronouncement during the Jefferson administration. He reluctantly led a committee of Boston merchants opposed to British policy of seizing American ships in commerce with France.

After the Battle of Trafalgar and Napoleon&#x27;s declaration of the Continental System, Cabot privately adopted a stance of definite alliance with the British in opposition to Napoleonic France. After the 1807 Chesapeake–Leopard affair, Cabot urged forgiveness and acceptance of the British terms of reparation. Jefferson&#x27;s response, instead, was the Embargo Act of 1807. Cabot, like most Federalists and most of New England, opposed Jefferson&#x27;s embargo against Britain, which he believed was designed to draw the United States into a war with Great Britain and would injure American business.

===Campaign of 1808===
The Embargo Act and the ensuing 1808 campaign drew Cabot and many other Federalists back into politics.

Cabot published and distributed a letter on behalf of Timothy Pickering, now representing Massachusetts in the Senate and the most prominent Federalist in public life. This pamphlet was widely read and revitalized support for the Federalists. Cabot, however, feared that Pickering&#x27;s approach could revitalize accusations the Federalists were a &quot;British faction&quot; and wrote to him urging caution. When Pickering persisted, Cabot suppressed several anti-Jeffersonian diatribes from the Senator.

Nonetheless, Cabot could not remain withdrawn from public life. Though Federalists did not win a resounding victory in Massachusetts, the party won sufficient seats in the General Court to elect Cabot to a one-year term on the Governor&#x27;s Council.

In the concurrent presidential election, Cabot advised against a union with the Clintonian faction of the Republican Party and any strategy that might suggest that Federalists supported dissolution of the Union or regional separatism, including Pickering&#x27;s proposal to hire a French engineer to fortify the port of Boston, traditionally a duty of the national government. Though the Federalists were unsuccessful in electing a President, the party did succeed in forcing repeal of the Embargo Act, after which Cabot withdrew from public life again. He withdrew further after the death of his eldest son, Charles, in 1811.

==War of 1812==
Cabot opposed the War of 1812 from the outset as unjust and wicked and publicly determined to refrain from aiding its prosecution in any way. However, he refrained from political commentary until 1814.

===Hartford Convention===

Cabot was elected as a delegate to the Hartford Convention, organized in 1814 by Federalist politicians of New England who were unhappy with the conduct of the War of 1812, in particular the conscription of state militias into national service. On his journey to Hartford, Cabot was joined by Dr. James Jackson. Cabot reportedly told Jackson he was going to Hartford to &quot;keep you young hot-heads from getting into mischief.&quot;

Cabot chaired the secretive meeting and later certified the official proceedings and platform of the convention, which called for constitutional reforms but stopped short of calling for secession. In his role, Cabot remained reticent regarding his own views, drawing the ire of more radically anti-war Federalists like Pickering and John Lowell Jr.

After the war ended, the convention was widely viewed as unconstitutional, bordering on treasonous. The Treaty of Ghent, signed while the convention was meeting, effectively ended both the Federalist Party and Cabot&#x27;s political career. He made no further public appearances and no longer maintained his correspondence with public figures, save a brief discussion with Pickering weighing the merits of free trade.

==Retirement==
After the Hartford Convention, Cabot returned to a life largely of leisure. He remained president of the Boston Marine Insurance Company, which kept him in touch with his merchant colleagues. He was an active member of Boston society and devoted much of his time to his wife, daughter Elizabeth, and son Henry who lived nearby with his family.

==Personal life==
Cabot steadfastly refused to have his portrait painted during his lifetime; most depictions of him are posthumous. He was described by contemporaries as tall and &quot;powerfully built.&quot; Samuel Griswold Goodrich, a witness to the Hartford Convention, described him as bearing a striking resemblance to George Washington.

Cabot was raised as a member of the Congregational Church of New England but later in life became a Unitarian.

He was averse to public speaking but considered an excellent conversationalist in private. Among his close friends was Josiah Quincy II, who later became President of Harvard University. Historian George Bancroft credited Cabot with encouraging him to study abroad at the University of Göttingen, where he was among the first Americans awarded a Ph.D.

He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788.

===Family===
Cabot married his second cousin Elizabeth Higginson in 1774. They had four children: 
*Charles (d. 1811)
*Henry
*Edward (d. 1803)
*Elizabeth

Charles became a merchant like his father, taking long voyages to the East Indies. Henry and Edward both began their careers in Boston, in a law office and counting-house, respectively. Edward died in 1803. Charles died of consumption in Havana in 1811. Henry and Elizabeth lived into adulthood.

Elizabeth married John Thornton Kirkland, the fifteenth President of Harvard University.

Through Henry&#x27;s daughter Anna, George Cabot was the great-grandfather of Henry Cabot Lodge, who held Cabot&#x27;s seat in the United States Senate from 1893 until his death in 1924. Lodge&#x27;s grandson Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. also represented Massachusetts in the Senate from 1937 to 1943 and again from 1947 to 1953.

In 1795, Cabot was briefly the guardian of Georges Washington de La Fayette, son of the Marquis de Lafayette, who had fled France to live in the United States in exile. Lafayette lived in Boston under the assumed name &quot;Motier&quot; and studied at Harvard College. Lafayette later entered the care of Hamilton before finally being adopted by Washington until he could return to France.

===Residence===
In 1794, Cabot moved his family from Beverly to Brookline, Massachusetts, where he built an estate named &quot;Greenhill.&quot; Among his guests there was Supreme Court Justice James Iredell. In 1803, to permit his daughter Elizabeth to enter society, Cabot sold his Brookline estate and moved to Boston, where he spent the rest of his life. After Fisher Ames died on July 4, 1808, Cabot hosted his funeral in his home.

==Death==
In 1821, Cabot suffered his first case of kidney stones and suffered from them for the remaining two years of his life.

He died in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 18, 1823, and was buried the Granary Burying Ground. He was later reinterred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
Cabot&#x27;s only full-length biography was published by his great-grandson Henry Cabot Lodge in 1877. Lodge also named his son George Cabot Lodge.

<text>Fighting is the fifth studio album by Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, released in 1975. Following the release of four studio albums, the band finally forged an identifiable sound featuring the twin guitars of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson. This sound draws from hard rock, folk, pop and rhythm and blues. It set the stage for the big commercial breakthrough of the follow-up album, &quot;Jailbreak&quot;. The album was also their first album to chart in the UK, hitting No. 60.

==Songs==
The track &quot;Suicide&quot; was originally performed by Thin Lizzy when guitarist Eric Bell was still in the band, including on a BBC broadcast recorded in July 1973. It was first performed with different lyrics under the title &quot;Baby&#x27;s Been Messing&quot;, and lacked the middle section that appears on &quot;Fighting&quot;. The non-album track &quot;Half-Caste&quot; was released on the B-side of the original &quot;Rosalie&quot; single. Another track recorded at the &quot;Fighting&quot; sessions was &quot;Try a Little Harder&quot;, which was eventually released on the &quot;Vagabonds, Kings, Warriors, Angels&quot; boxed set in 2002.

&quot;Fighting&quot; is the only Thin Lizzy album aside from their 1971 debut where band members other than Phil Lynott receive sole songwriting credits for certain tracks. Bell wrote &quot;Ray Gun&quot; on the debut, and Robertson and Gorham wrote &quot;Silver Dollar&quot; and &quot;Ballad of a Hard Man&quot;, respectively.

Although the distinctive Thin Lizzy logo (designed by Jim Fitzpatrick) was frequently used on compilation albums, merchandise and as stage scenery at the band&#x27;s gigs over the years, this was the only Thin Lizzy studio album to feature it on the cover.

Europe guitarist John Norum covered &quot;Wild One&quot; on his 1987 debut solo album &quot;Total Control&quot;, and Europe covered &quot;Suicide&quot; on their 2008 live album &quot;Almost Unplugged&quot;.

==Reception==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described &quot;Fighting&quot; as a &quot;tense, coiled, vicious rock &amp; roll album&quot;, with which Thin Lizzy began their classic era. Highlighting Gorham and Robertson&#x27;s twin-guitar interplay, he described this line-up as &quot;vital and visceral&quot;, and added that Lynott had made a leap forward as a songwriter, &quot;fully flourishing as a rock &amp; roll poet&quot;. In his &quot;Collector&#x27;s Guide to Heavy Metal&quot; Martin Popoff called &quot;Fighting&quot; a &quot;soulful, stirring hard rock classic&quot;, where &quot;Robertson and Gorham&#x27;s fluid guitar harmonies become an integral part of the Lizzy sound, woven in the very fabric of the arrangements&quot; and &quot;the tales of outlaws and outcasts&quot; reach &quot;a fairly grandiose, history-encompassing, tragic scale.&quot;

&quot;I was a Lizzy fan,&quot; recalled &quot;Sounds&quot; writer and future &quot;Kerrang!&quot; founder Geoff Barton, &quot;but &quot;Fighting&quot; just didn&#x27;t cut it for me at the time. &#x27;The band&#x27;s second LP with their new twin-guitar line-up is an adequate rock album, no more,&#x27; I wrote. &#x27;This one suffers from the familiar Lizzy studio trait: lack of any real energy or aggression.&#x27; The following month I went to see Lizzy live… About halfway through the show, Phil went into a bit of a diatribe against rock critics and I wondered if he knew I was in the audience. It turned out he did! At the end of the monologue, Phil just kind of shrugged his shoulders and said, with a wry smile on his face, &#x27;But, no matter what, this next song is for Geoff Barton: Still in Love with You.&#x27; That was probably the most humbling moment of my entire career.&quot;

<text>Toasted ravioli, colloquially known as T-ravs, is breaded deep-fried ravioli, usually served as an appetizer and also used to consume dipping sauce. It was created and popularized in St. Louis, Missouri.

==Origin==
Most accounts of toasted ravioli trace its origins to a predominantly Italian-American neighborhood of St. Louis, The Hill. Supposedly, in the early 1940s, a raviolo was accidentally dropped into the fryer by a chef. Shortly thereafter, the item began appearing on menus across The Hill. While many restaurants on The Hill claim its creation, Charlie Gitto&#x27;s &quot;On The Hill&quot; restaurant (then known as &quot;Angelo&#x27;s&quot;) is where it was made famous. That story claims that a chef at Angelo&#x27;s, Mario Battocletti, accidentally dropped the pasta into oil after a misunderstanding. Chef and restaurateur Charlie Gitto, Jr. inherited the original recipe and still serves it at his restaurants to this day. 

Another claim is from Mama Campisi&#x27;s as well as Louis Oldani. Oldani is said to have named the dish &#x27;toasted&#x27; ravioli because he thought &#x27;toasted&#x27; was more appealing than &#x27;fried&#x27;.

Lombardo&#x27;s Restaurants, located around the St. Louis area, also claim to have been among the first to bring toasted ravioli to the States from Sicily; their current owner, Tony Lombardo, shows menus from the 1930s that include it. Lombardo&#x27;s toasted ravioli frequently tops lists as the &quot;best t-ravs in St. Louis&quot;.

== Composition, varieties, and service ==
Generally, some type of meat is wrapped in square ravioli, breaded and deep fried until the pasta shell becomes slightly crispy, dry and browned. Toasted ravioli is generally served with marinara sauce for dipping and Parmesan cheese may also be sprinkled on top. Toasted ravioli can be stored pre-made and frozen, which allows it to be easily prepared by fry cooks or bar staff without special skill or training.

<text>The Master System which was renamed with a redesigned casing from original Sega Mark III, which had been released in the Japanese market in 1985—is a video game console released by Sega in the North American market in September 1986 to compete with the Nintendo Entertainment System, which had been released in the same market in February 1986 (an earlier test market for NES in New York occurred in October 1985). Originally priced at 200, North American distribution rights for the console were acquired by Tonka before Sega re-acquired the rights themselves and released a further streamlined redesign of the console during the launch of the Sega Genesis. The Master System was later released in Europe in August 1987, in South Korea in April 1989 and in Brazil in September 1989 where distribution rights were given to Tec Toy. A re-release of the console in the Japanese market under the new Master System brand and redesign also occurred in 1987.

There are game titles for the Master System. 18 were released exclusively in Japan, 4 were released exclusively in North America, 158 were released exclusively in PAL regions and 22 were released exclusively in Brazil.

<doc id="1066834" wikidata="Q850226" url="?curid=1066834" title="Reid, Australian Capital Territory">
<text>Reid is a suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. With a population of 1,544 at the , located directly next to Civic, Reid is one of the oldest suburbs in Canberra. It is named after George Reid, the fourth prime minister of Australia.

Separating the suburbs of Reid and Campbell is Anzac Parade, a ceremonial boulevarde running along Canberra&#x27;s primary design axis (the land axis) from Lake Burley Griffin to the Australian War Memorial.

Located in Reid are the Canberra Institute of Technology and St John the Baptist Church, which is the oldest church in Canberra.

==History==

The foundation stone of St John the Baptist Church was laid in 1841 and it was consecrated on 12 March 1845. It listed by the ACT Heritage Council.

Most of the suburb was constructed in 1926 and 1927 to provide housing for public servants in preparation for the opening of the provisional Parliament House in 1927. It was a housing precinct planned on Garden City principles and is now heritage-listed. The Uniting Church (now the Canberra Korean Church) on Coranderrk Street was built in 1927 and is also heritage listed.

Reid was named in 1928 after Australia&#x27;s fourth Prime Minister, Sir George Reid. It was previously considered to be part of Ainslie. The streets in Reid are named after aboriginal words.

The four-storey Bega flats (containing 114 two-bedroom flats) were completed east of Cooyong street and south of Ainslie in 1957 in order to cope with a critical lack of accommodation for public servants transferred to Canberra. The ACT Heritage Council described them as having been designed in the Post-War International style &quot;similar to post-war housing in Europe, particularly in English new towns. The fine proportions, crisp detailing and low scale of [the Allawah Court] and their siting continuing the street pattern made them more architecturally successful than the three eight-storey blocks of flats along Currong Street&quot; (nearby in Braddon). The Heritage Council declined to heritage list the buildings and despite some local opposition they were demolished in 2017/18 and will be replaced by more modern and denser accommodation along with some commercial uses.

==Demographics==
At the , the population of Reid was 1,544, including 16 (1.0%) Indigenous persons and 986 (63.9%) Australian-born persons. 36.2% of dwellings were separate houses (compared to the Australian average of 72.3%), while 22.0% were semi-detached, row or terrace houses (Australian average: 12.6%) and 41.3% were flats, units or apartments (Australian average: 14.2%). 39.9% of the population were professionals, compared to the Australian average of 24.0%. Notably 21.7% worked in central government administration, compared to the Australian average of 1.1%, although the ACT-wide average was a similar 17.1%. Reid was favoured by students and young adults with 31.6% of its population in the 20 to 34-year-old age group (compared to the Australian average of 20.5%). 49.9% of the population had no religion (compared to the ACT average of 43.5% and the Australian average of 38.4%), 13.9% were Catholic, 9.7% were Anglican, 7.7% had no stated religion and 2.5% were Hindu.

== Politics ==
Reid is located within the federal electorate of Canberra, which is currently represented by Alicia Payne in the House of Representatives. In the ACT Legislative Assembly, Reid is part of the electorate of Kurrajong, which elects five members on the basis of proportional representation, currently two Labor, two Greens and one Liberal.

==Geology==

Calcareous shale from the Canberra Formation is overlain by Quaternary alluvium. This rock is the limestone of the original title of Canberra &quot;Limestone Plains&quot;. Tertiary age pebbly gravels are around Anzac Parade left from when the Molonglo river was at a higher level.

<text>Ted Drewes is a family-owned frozen custard company in St. Louis, Missouri, founded by Ted Drewes, Sr. in 1929. There are two locations, one on Chippewa Street (part of U.S. Route 66), with the other on South Grand Boulevard.

Its signature item is the &quot;concrete&quot;, a serving of frozen custard so thick that it is customarily presented to the customer upside down.

==History==
A noted local athlete who starred for his high school basketball team and later dominated municipal tennis tournaments for more than a decade, Ted Drewes started making frozen custard while working for a carnival and opened his first fixed location near St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1929. The first St. Louis shop began serving in 1930 on Natural Bridge Avenue near Goodfellow Blvd. Less than a year later, it was moved westward along the avenue. A second location was opened at 4224 South Grand Blvd. in 1931. In 1941, a third location opened at 6726 Chippewa Street, on one of the alignments of U.S. Route 66 through St. Louis. The Natural Bridge and Florida locations had closed by 1958, but the Chippewa and South Grand locations remain open. When Ted Drewes, Sr. died in 1968, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; noted his passing in an obituary that focused on his tennis.

For decades, the Grand Avenue location was the flagship store, serving what was then a densely populated urban area in the neighborhood of Dutchtown and near the neighborhoods of Tower Grove South, Gravois Park, Bevo Mill, Holly Hills, and Carondelet. Each year, it would open in April and close on October 31. The Chippewa location served as an outpost near the city limits for travelers heading to or returning from an Ozark weekend getaway. In those days, it was open from Memorial Day to Labor Day.

Between the population shifting west in the city and Route 66 drawing more crowds, the Chippewa store became the flagship location. Its season extended to more of the year, while the shop on Grand shortened its seasonal operation. In the weeks leading up to Christmas, Ted Drewes began selling live Christmas trees. In the wake of the transition, the Chippewa store expanded its building and bought a neighboring property to accommodate parking. By 2006, the company was making more than 150,000 gallons of custard every year.

The Chippewa store is closed only during the month of January. In 2013, it closed briefly after a minor electrical fire. The South Grand location now operates only seasonally during summer months.

In 2013, Ted Drewes Jr. said he has declined numerous requests to franchise nationally.

Due to effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, the South Grand location closed temporarily prior to the summer of 2020. It reopened for the summer of 2023.

On August 26, 2024, Ted Drewes Jr. died at the age of 96.

==In the press==
Ted Drewes&#x27; shops and frozen custard have drawn the attention of &quot;The New York Times&quot; several times over the years, including in 1986, 1997, and 1999. In 2004, reporter R.W. Apple Jr. extolled the custard in an article on Midwestern sweets.

In 1986, &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed that the origin of the Blizzard from Dairy Queen was an attempt by a franchisee to mimic the Ted Drewes concrete.

In 2006, Alton Brown featured the Route 66 location on the Food Network show &quot;Feasting on Asphalt&quot;.

In 2010, Bobby Flay recommended Ted Drewes on the &quot;Sweet Tooth&quot; episode of &quot;The Best Thing I Ever Ate&quot;.

In 2011, Ted Drewes was featured in a &quot;Route 66&quot; episode of &quot;Man v. Food Nation&quot;, hosted by Adam Richman.

In 2014, the &quot;Riverfront Times&quot; 2014 award for &quot;Best Frozen Custard in St. Louis&quot; went to Ted Drewes.

In 2017, Ted Drewes was named &quot;Best Ice Cream Shop in the World&quot; by SoolNua, an Irish marketing firm that publishes a world ice cream index every year.

In 2024, Ted Drewes was featured in History Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Food That Built America&quot;. During the episode entitled &quot;Ice Cream Revolution&quot;, it is stated that the concept of the Blizzard from Dairy Queen was copied from the Ted Drewes concrete.

<doc id="1066843" wikidata="Q243758" url="?curid=1066843" title="Vickrey auction">
<text>A Vickrey auction or sealed-bid second-price auction (SBSPA) is a type of sealed-bid auction. Bidders submit written bids without knowing the bid of the other people in the auction. The highest bidder wins but the price paid is the second-highest bid. This type of auction is strategically similar to an English auction and gives bidders an incentive to bid their true value. The auction was first described academically by Columbia University professor William Vickrey in 1961 though it had been used by stamp collectors since 1893. In 1797 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe sold a manuscript using a sealed-bid, second-price auction.

Vickrey&#x27;s original paper mainly considered auctions where only a single, indivisible good is being sold. The terms &quot;Vickrey auction&quot; and &quot;second-price sealed-bid auction&quot; are, in this case only, equivalent and used interchangeably. In the case of multiple identical goods, the bidders submit inverse demand curves and pay the opportunity cost.

Vickrey auctions are much studied in economic literature but uncommon in practice. Generalized variants of the Vickrey auction for multiunit auctions exist, such as the generalized second-price auction used in Google&#x27;s and Yahoo!&#x27;s online advertisement programs (not incentive compatible) and the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves auction (incentive compatible).

== Properties ==
=== Self-revelation and incentive compatibility ===
In a Vickrey auction with private values each bidder maximizes their expected utility by bidding (revealing) their valuation of the item for sale. These type of auctions are sometimes used for specified pool trading in the agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market.

=== Ex-post efficiency ===
A Vickrey auction is decision efficient (the winner is the bidder with the highest valuation) under the most general circumstances; it thus provides a baseline model against which the efficiency properties of other types of auctions can be posited. It is only ex-post efficient (sum of transfers equal to zero) if the seller is included as &quot;player zero,&quot; whose transfer equals the negative of the sum of the other players&#x27; transfers (i.e. the bids).

=== Weaknesses ===
* It does not allow for price discovery, that is, discovery of the market price if the buyers are unsure of their own valuations, without sequential auctions.
* Sellers may use shill bids to increase profit.

== Proof of dominance of truthful bidding ==
The dominant strategy in a Vickrey auction with a single, indivisible item is for each bidder to bid their true value of the item.

Let formula_1 be bidder i&#x27;s value for the item. Let formula_2 be bidder formula_3 bid for the item.
The payoff for bidder formula_4 is

: formula_5

The strategy of overbidding is dominated by bidding truthfully (i.e. bidding formula_6). Assume that bidder formula_4 bids formula_8.

* If formula_9 then the bidder would win the item with a truthful bid as well as an overbid. The bid&#x27;s amount does not change the payoff so the two strategies have equal payoffs in this case.
* If formula_10 then the bidder would lose the item either way so the strategies have equal payoffs in this case.
* If formula_11 then only the strategy of overbidding would win the auction. The payoff would be negative for the strategy of overbidding because they paid more than their value of the item, while the payoff for a truthful bid would be zero. 

Thus the strategy of bidding higher than one&#x27;s true valuation is dominated by the strategy of truthfully bidding. The strategy of underbidding is also dominated by bidding truthfully. Assume that bidder formula_4 bids formula_13.

* If formula_14 then the bidder would lose the item with a truthful bid as well as an underbid, so the strategies have equal payoffs for this case.
* If formula_15 then the bidder would win the item either way so the strategies have equal payoffs in this case.
* If formula_16 then only the strategy of truthfully bidding would win the auction. The payoff for the truthful strategy would be positive as they paid less than their value of the item, while the payoff for an underbid bid would be zero. 

Thus the strategy of underbidding is dominated by the strategy of truthfully bidding. As truthful bidding dominates the other possible strategies (i.e. underbidding and overbidding), it is an optimal strategy.

== Revenue equivalence of the Vickrey auction and sealed first price auction ==
The two most common auctions are the sealed first price (or high-bid) auction and the open ascending price (or English) auction. In the former each buyer submits a sealed bid. The high bidder is awarded the item and pays his or her bid. In the latter, the auctioneer announces successively higher asking prices and continues until no one is willing to accept a higher price. Suppose that a buyer&#x27;s valuation is formula_17 and the current asking price is formula_18. If formula_19 and the buyer is not the current high bidder, it is more profitable to bid than to let someone else be the winner. Thus it is a dominant strategy for a buyer to drop out of the bidding when the asking price reaches his or her valuation. Thus, just as in the Vickrey sealed second price auction, the price paid by the buyer with the highest valuation is equal to the second highest value.

Consider then the expected payment in the sealed second-price auction. Vickrey considered the case of two buyers and assumed that each buyer&#x27;s value was an independent draw from a uniform distribution with support formula_20. With buyers bidding according to their dominant strategies, a buyer with valuation formula_17 wins if his opponent&#x27;s value formula_22. Suppose that formula_17 is the high value. Then the winning payment is uniformly distributed on the interval formula_24 and so the expected payment of the winner is

:formula_25

We now argue that in the sealed first price auction the equilibrium bid of a buyer with valuation formula_17 is
:formula_27

That is, the payment of the winner in the sealed first-price auction is equal to the expected revenue in the sealed second-price auction.

; Proof of revenue equivalence
Suppose that buyer 2 bids according to the strategy formula_28, where formula_29 is the buyer&#x27;s bid for a valuation formula_17. We need to show that buyer 1&#x27;s best response is to use the same strategy.

Note first that if buyer 2 uses the strategy formula_28, then buyer 2&#x27;s maximum bid is formula_32 and so buyer 1 wins with probability 1 with any bid of 1/2 or more. Consider then a bid formula_18 on the interval formula_34. Let buyer 2&#x27;s value be formula_35. Then buyer 1 wins if formula_36, that is, if formula_37. Under Vickrey&#x27;s assumption of uniformly distributed values, the win probability is formula_38. Buyer 1&#x27;s expected payoff is therefore

:formula_39

Note that formula_40 takes on its maximum at formula_41.

== Use in network routing ==

In network routing, VCG mechanisms are a family of payment schemes based on the added value concept. The basic idea of a VCG mechanism in network routing is to pay the owner of each link or node (depending on the network model) that is part of the solution, its declared cost &quot;plus&quot; its added value. In many routing problems, this mechanism is not only strategyproof, but also the minimum among all strategyproof mechanisms.

In the case of network flows, unicast or multicast, a minimum-cost flow (MCF) in graph &quot;G&quot; is calculated based on the declared costs &quot;d&quot;&quot;k&quot; of each of the links and payment is calculated as follows:

Each link (or node) formula_42 in the MCF is paid

:formula_43

where MCF(&quot;G&quot;) indicates the cost of the minimum-cost flow in graph &quot;G&quot; and &quot;G&quot; − &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot; indicates graph &quot;G&quot; without the link &quot;e&quot;&quot;k&quot;. Links not in the MCF are paid nothing. This routing problem is one of the cases for which VCG is strategyproof and minimum.

In 2004, it was shown that the expected VCG overpayment of an Erdős–Rényi random graph with &quot;n&quot; nodes and edge probability &quot;p&quot;, formula_44 approaches

:formula_45

as &quot;n&quot;, approaches formula_46, for formula_47. Prior to this result, it was known that
VCG overpayment in &quot;G&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;) is

:formula_48

and

:formula_49

with high probability given

:formula_50

== Generalizations ==
The most obvious generalization to multiple or divisible goods is to have all winning bidders pay the amount of the highest non-winning bid. This is known as a uniform price auction. The uniform-price auction does not, however, result in bidders bidding their true valuations as they do in a second-price auction unless each bidder has demand for only a single unit. A generalization of the Vickrey auction that maintains the incentive to bid truthfully is known as the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism. The idea in VCG is that items are assigned to maximize the sum of utilities; then each bidder pays the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; that their presence introduces to all the other players. This opportunity cost for a bidder is defined as the total bids of all the other bidders that would have won if the first bidder had not bid, minus the total bids of all the other actual winning bidders.

A different kind of generalization is to set a reservation price—a minimum price below which the item is not sold at all. In some cases, setting a reservation price can substantially increase the revenue of the auctioneer. This is an example of Bayesian-optimal mechanism design.

In mechanism design, the revelation principle can be viewed as a generalization of the Vickrey auction.

<doc id="1066844" wikidata="Q654976" url="?curid=1066844" title="Jailbreak (album)">
<text>Jailbreak is the sixth studio album by Irish hard rock band Thin Lizzy. It was released on 26 March 1976, by Vertigo Records. The album proved to be the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in the US, and the only Thin Lizzy album with a certification (in this case, Gold) in that country. The singles taken from the album include &quot;Jailbreak&quot; and &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;; the latter is Thin Lizzy&#x27;s biggest US hit, and won the 1976 NME Award for Best Single.

== Composition and recording ==
After their previous two albums, &quot;Nightlife&quot; and &quot;Fighting&quot;, failed to generate sales, Thin Lizzy were given one last chance by their label, Vertigo Records. The band wrote songs and collected ideas in a studio in Buckinghamshire in late 1975, then convened at Ramport Studios in London in the new year. They selected John Alcock as their producer, for he had worked in the studio extensively. The band worked diligently through February on the album. However, guitarists Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson felt that the speed at which it was completed adversely affected its quality. Both stated that the tightness of the songs made the album feel rigid. In particular, Robertson said he would have liked more freedom to improvise his lead guitar parts. Gorham also criticized Alcock&#x27;s production, saying that he didn&#x27;t particularly care for his guitar tone on the album.

&quot;When I wrote &#x27;Warriors&#x27;…&quot; frontman and songwriter Phil Lynott remarked in 1976, &quot;the only way I could give any sense of heavy drug takers was by describing them as warriors; that they actually go out and do it. People like Hendrix and Duane Allman were perfectly aware of the position they were getting into. They weren&#x27;t slowly being hooked. It was a conscious decision to go out and take the thing as far as it can go.&quot;

Initially, the song &quot;Running Back&quot; was chosen to be a single ahead of &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;, the latter being seen as possibly too aggressive for some radio stations to play. Lynott and producer John Alcock decided to employ session musicians to add more commercial elements to some of the tracks and try to produce a hit single, so Tim Hinkley was brought in to add keyboard parts to &quot;Running Back&quot;. Robertson was against the idea, as he liked the song as it had originally been arranged, in a blues format with his own additions of piano and bottleneck guitar. He later said, &quot;I took enormous offence to [the changes]. I couldn&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;d pay this guy a fortune just for playing what he did. Listen to it and tell me it&#x27;s not bollocks.&quot; Robertson did not play on the finished version of the song and Hinkley is not credited on the album sleeve. Lynott said at the time that &quot;Running Back&quot; was &quot;very much influenced by Van Morrison. I really like that song.&quot; Hinkley later recalled, &quot;Robbo and Scott were not keen on it at all but they were overruled.&quot; Thirty-five years later, Robertson recorded his own versions of the song on his 2011 album &quot;Diamonds and Dirt&quot;.

Scott Gorham also revealed that &quot;Romeo and the Lonely Girl&quot; was also brought up as an option for a single, but was ultimately discarded, as &quot;nobody was overexcited about it.&quot;

==Tour==
While touring to promote the album, in the US, Lynott was stricken with hepatitis. Finally, the tour management decided to cancel the remaining tour dates allowing him time to recuperate.

==Reception==
&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau likened the album&#x27;s songs to Bruce Springsteen cast-offs, finding Lynott&#x27;s lyrical ideas &quot;boring&quot; and Gorham&#x27;s guitar lines &quot;second-hand&quot;. Stuart Bailie of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine referred back to Christgau&#x27;s appraisal, writing that both Springsteen and Lynott &quot;were indebted to Van Morrison and his Celtic soul&quot;, and remarked how on &quot;Jailbreak&quot; &quot;Lynott&#x27;s best attributes were coming on strong.&quot;

In a retrospective assessment for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes &quot;Jailbreak&quot; as a &quot;truly exceptional album&quot;, with &quot;a dimension of richness that sustains, but there&#x27;s such kinetic energy to the band that it still sounds immediate no matter how many times it&#x27;s played&quot;. Highlighting Lynott&#x27;s songs as &quot;lovingly florid... crammed with specifics and overflowing with life&quot;, he says that Gorham and Robertson&#x27;s guitar work is &quot;intertwined, dual-lead guitar interplay that was one of the most distinctive sounds of &#x27;70s rock&quot;. In his review Martin Popoff described &quot;Jailbreak&quot; as &quot;the band&#x27;s last album where eclecticism outweighs the cohesive signals&quot; which made later releases &quot;much more singular in intent&quot;. He praised &quot;Gorham and Robertson&#x27;s sharpest metal to date&quot; and remarked how the album is made of &quot;a coterie of songs that very often struck the same emotional heartstrings of Springsteen.&quot;

==Track listings==
All tracks written or co-written by Phil Lynott; additional writers noted.

On the 1996 Mercury CD reissue, &quot;Angel from the Coast&quot; and &quot;Running Back&quot; are listed as the second track with only one running time, making it appear to be a single song called &quot;Angel from the Coast Running Back&quot;, and there is no third track listed. However, all the songs are sequenced as on the original LP release.

===Remastered edition===
On 24 January 2011, a new remastered and expanded version of &quot;Jailbreak&quot; was released. This new edition is a 2-CD set, with the original album on disc one, and bonus material on disc two. On the original vinyl release of the album, the back cover included a short story, which is also reprinted inside some editions of the new deluxe edition.

However, the track listing on the back cover of the first release was incorrect, listing only ten songs, while the actual CD contains eleven tracks. Also, the songs are not in the correct order. The track listing was corrected on later versions of the release.

Only the bonus material on disc two has been remastered in 2010 (despite what it says on the back of the CD booklet). Disc one uses the same remaster as the 1996 edition. New remasters were made, but scrapped at the last minute before the release, for reasons unknown.

==Singles==
*&quot;The Boys are Back in Town&quot; / &quot;Emerald&quot; – 17 April 1976
:Some countries, including the US and Canada, featured &quot;Jailbreak&quot; as the B-side.
