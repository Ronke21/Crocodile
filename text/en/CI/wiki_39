<doc id="1056492" wikidata="Q483044" url="?curid=1056492" title="Daegu FC">
<text>Daegu FC () is a South Korean professional football club based in Daegu. The club was founded as a community club at the end of 2002, and made their K League 1 debut in 2003. Daegu has played mostly in the K League 1 but was relegated at the end of the 2013 season to the K League 2. They were promoted back to the top tier for the 2017 season and went on to win the 2018 Korean FA Cup, which qualified them for the 2019 AFC Champions League. The club&#x27;s best season in K League 1 was in 2021, when they finished third out of twelve teams and were also runners-up in the Korean FA Cup. At the international level, they advanced to the round of 16 in the 2021 and 2022 AFC Champions League.

==History==

===Foundation===
Daegu FC was established in 2002 as a community club (generally in South Korea, a &quot;community-club&quot; means that the club issues shares) based in the city of Daegu. The city is a key shareholder, and the current mayor is chairman of the club. Following their foundation, the club entered the 2003 season of the K League under manager Park Jong-hwan. Park had previously managed the national side for a number years in the 1980s and 1990s. The club&#x27;s entry, together with that of Gwangju Sangmu, brought the number of teams participating in the league to 12.

===Domestic competitions===
Daegu finished the 2003 K League season in 11th place (out of 12 teams), winning seven games, and drawing sixteen. In the 2003 Korean FA Cup, Daegu reached the quarterfinals, where they were defeated 1–0 by Ulsan Hyundai Horang-i. Daegu improved in 2004 to tenth place in the league which, due to Incheon United&#x27;s entry, now numbered 13 clubs. In the FA Cup, Daegu were knocked out in the round of 32 by National League side Ansan Hallelujah. In the Samsung Hauzen Cup, a new cup competition run as a league competition specifically for K League clubs (thus excluding National League and lower-tier clubs) during the K League&#x27;s mid-season break, finished eighth out of 13 teams. The following season saw Daegu placed eighth place in the league and seventh in the Samsung Hauzen Cup. In the FA Cup, after defeating University and National League sides, Daegu were knocked out in the quarterfinals in a 2–1 loss to another K League side, the Chunnam Dragons.

For the 2006 K League season, the club placed seventh overall in the league and was 13th in Samsung Hauzen Cup. It reached the quarterfinals of the 2006 edition of the FA Cup but lost (again) to the Chunnam Dragons. Following completion of the 2006 season, Park Jong-hwan stepped down as manager after four years with the club. On 1 December 2006, Byun Byung-joo was appointed as the new manager. A former South Korean international, Byun had no previous K League management experience prior to his appointment as Daegu FC&#x27;s manager. The club&#x27;s performance slipped in comparison to its previous two seasons, and it placed 12th. The club failed to get out of the group stage in the 2007 Samsung Hauzen Cup and achieved a similar level of performance in the FA Cup, where Daegu lost to Incheon United in the round of 16.

In 2008, Daegu played extremely aggressive football, becoming the joint equal top-scoring team of the K League, alongside Suwon Samsung Bluewings. However, they also conceded the most goals in the league. An 11th place in the K League standings was the eventual outcome. For the first time in its history, Daegu reached the semi-finals of the Korean FA Cup, by defeating Ulsan in the quarterfinals, following a win in the round of 16 over Ansan Hallelujah. However, they then lost to their opponents Pohang Steelers in a 2–0 loss. The club placed fifth (out of six teams) in their group in the Samsung Hauzen Cup.

The 2009 season was one of the worst in the club&#x27;s history. In a now expanded league of 15 clubs, thanks to new entrant Gangwon FC, Daegu would place in the last, 15th place, winning only five games. In the FA Cup, Daegu reached the quarterfinals, against Daejeon Citizen, the game finished with a 1–1 scoreline. Daegu lost out in the subsequent penalty shoot-out. In the league cup, the club finished third in their group, one point away from qualifying for the knockout phase of the cup. Later in the year, Lee Young-jin was appointed as manager for the 2010 season. Lee, who has previously coached FC Seoul, replaced Byun who had resigned after being embroiled in a scandal involving a player&#x27;s agent and payoffs for selecting specific players.

On field, Daegu repeated their dismal performances of the previous season, finishing 15th in the K League standings, equal with Gwangju Sangmu on points. Daegu conceded the most goals of any club in the league, losing 19 games out of 28 games, with five wins and four draws. In the FA Cup, Daegu lost 1–0 after extra time to the National League side Suwon City. Better results were achieved in the League Cup, with Daegu progressing out of their group to the knockout stage, thanks to wins over Daejeon Citizen and Busan, before losing to FC Seoul after a penalty shoot-out.

By virtue of winning the 2018 Korean FA Cup, Daegu qualified for its first appearance in the AFC Champions League.

After a controversial fall out with the club&#x27;s executive director, manager André left Daegu FC in January 2020. The club then announced Lee Byung-keun, who had joined the club as the chief assistant coach at the beginning of the 2019 season, as a caretaker manager to lead the club in the upcoming 2020 K League 1 season.

The club narrowly avoided relegation in 2024 K League 1 by defeating second division club Chungnam Asan in the promotion-relegation play-offs after finishing 11th in the regular season.

===International competitions===
Prior to the start of the 2006 K League season, Daegu participated in the Tongyeong Cup. The Tongyeong Cup was a four-team invitational tournament held in Tongyeong, South Korea. As well as Daegu and fellow K League club Incheon United, A-League side Queensland Roar and Beijing Guo&#x27;an were also part of the tournament. After beating both Incheon and Beijing, Daegu drew 0–0 with Queensland, winning the Tongyeong Cup and thus its first trophy.

In 2019, the club played in the 2019 AFC Champions League, and for the group stage was placed with Sanfrecce Hiroshima, Guangzhou Evergrande and Melbourne Victory. Despite having the lowest wage bill of all the K-League clubs, it won its first game, against Melbourne Victory. It went on to win two more games in the group stage but failed to progress to the knockout phase.

Daegu made made it to the knockout stages of the 2021 and 2022 editions of the AFC Champions League, and defeated eventual tournament winners Urawa Red Diamonds 1–0 in the group stage of the 2022 competition before being knocked out by compatriots Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in the next round.

==Rivalries==
Daegu shares a rivalry with the nearby Daegu–Gyeongbuk club Pohang Steelers. The city of Daegu was previously part of North Gyeongsang Province, which Pohang is now the largest city of.

The club also shares a rivalry with Gwangju FC, mirroring the Samsung Lions-Kia Tigers baseball rivalry between the two cities. The &#x27;Moonlight Derby&#x27; between the two cities (borrowed from the &#x27;Moonlight Series&#x27; rivalry name in baseball) stems from differences in their respective political leanings.

==Stadium==

The club&#x27;s first home ground, Daegu Stadium (formerly Daegu World Cup Stadium), was opened on 28 June 2001 and is owned by the Daegu Metropolitan City. The stadium was one of the venues for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosting three group stage matches, as well as the third-place match between South Korea and Turkey. Daegu FC used the stadium as their main venue between 2003 and 2018. The stadium has 66,422 seats, and it is covered by natural grass. The name was changed to Daegu Stadium on 5 March 2008. Occasionally, Daegu FC played its home games at the Daegu Civic Stadium.
In the 2019 season, Daegu FC relocated to the DGB Daegu Bank Park, a 12,419-capacity football-specific stadium built at the same location as the demolished Daegu Civic Stadium. The small but compact stadium located in the Buk District of the city has led to it constantly selling out and consistently breaking their attendance record year after year. In 2025, the stadium was renamed as Daegu iM Bank Park due to the name change of the stadium&#x27;s sponsor, iM Bank.

===R-League===
From 2008 to 2011, Daegu FC fielded a team in the R-League, established in 2000 for the reserve squads of the professional K-League clubs. The National Policy Agency also entered a team in the league. The league format provided for two groups of teams (six to eight in each group), each group member playing the others in the group, three or four times, depending on the number of teams in the groups. The top two teams in each group moved onto a playoff round although from 2010, the title was shared between the winners of each group.

In 2008, Daegu placed 7th out of the 8 teams in their group, winning three of 18 games. They fared little better in 2009, finishing last in their group of five teams. In 2010, Daegu&#x27;s reserve squad only won one of their group games, while they drew two, and lost 11 times. The side&#x27;s return of 5 points saw it place 8th and last in their group. In 2011, the club improved to 5th in its group, with eight wins. It did not enter the 2012 edition of the competition.

===U-18 (Hyunpung High School) squad===
In 2008, Daegu FC established an under-18 side, to act as a development squad for the men&#x27;s team. This is essentially Hyunpung High School&#x27;s senior football team, and as of 2009, plays in the U-18 Challenge League. The side is managed by former Daegu FC player Kim Hyun-soo.

<doc id="1056496" wikidata="Q1378386" url="?curid=1056496" title="Leaky bucket">
<text>The leaky bucket is an algorithm based on an analogy of how a bucket with a constant leak will overflow if either the average rate at which water is poured in exceeds the rate at which the bucket leaks or if more water than the capacity of the bucket is poured in all at once. It can be used to determine whether some sequence of discrete events conforms to defined limits on their average and peak rates or frequencies, e.g. to limit the actions associated with these events to these rates or delay them until they do conform to the rates. It may also be used to check conformance or limit to an average rate alone, i.e. remove any variation from the average. 

It is used in packet-switched computer networks and telecommunications networks in both the traffic policing, traffic shaping and scheduling of data transmissions, in the form of packets, to defined limits on bandwidth and burstiness (a measure of the variations in the traffic flow).

A version of the leaky bucket, the generic cell rate algorithm, is recommended for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks in UPC and NPC at user–network interfaces or inter-network interfaces or network-to-network interfaces to protect a network from excessive traffic levels on connections routed through it. The generic cell rate algorithm, or an equivalent, may also be used to shape transmissions by a network interface card onto an ATM network.

At least some implementations of the leaky bucket are a mirror image of the token bucket algorithm and will, given equivalent parameters, determine exactly the same sequence of events to conform or not conform to the same limits.

==Overview==

Two different methods of applying this leaky bucket analogy are described in the literature. These give what appear to be two different algorithms, both of which are referred to as the leaky bucket algorithm and generally without reference to the other method. This has resulted in confusion about what the leaky bucket algorithm is and what its properties are.

In one version the bucket is a counter or variable separate from the flow of traffic or schedule of events. This counter is used only to check that the traffic or events conform to the limits: The counter is incremented as each packet arrives at the point where the check is being made or an event occurs, which is equivalent to the way water is added intermittently to the bucket. The counter is also decremented at a fixed rate, equivalent to the way the water leaks out of the bucket. As a result, the value in the counter represents the level of the water in the bucket. If the counter remains below a specified limit value when a packet arrives or an event occurs, i.e. the bucket does not overflow, that indicates its conformance to the bandwidth and burstiness limits or the average and peak rate event limits. This version is referred to here as &quot; the leaky bucket as a meter&quot;.

In the second version, the bucket is a queue in the flow of traffic. This queue is used to directly control that flow: Packets are entered into the queue as they arrive, equivalent to the water being added to the bucket. These packets are then removed from the queue (first come, first served), usually at a fixed rate, e.g. for onward transmission, equivalent to water leaking from the bucket. This configuration imposes conformance rather than checking it, and where the output is serviced at a fixed rate (and where the packets are all the same length), the resulting traffic stream is necessarily devoid of burstiness or jitter. So in this version, the traffic itself is the analogue of the water passing through the bucket. This version is referred to here as &quot;leaky bucket as a queue&quot;.

The leaky bucket as a meter is exactly equivalent to (a mirror image of) the token bucket algorithm, i.e. the process of adding water to the leaky bucket exactly mirrors that of removing tokens from the token bucket when a conforming packet arrives, the process of leaking of water from the leaky bucket exactly mirrors that of regularly adding tokens to the token bucket, and the test that the leaky bucket will not overflow is a mirror of the test that the token bucket contains enough tokens and will not &quot;underflow&quot;. Thus, given equivalent parameters, the two algorithms will see the same traffic as conforming or nonconforming. The leaky bucket as a queue can be seen as a special case of the leaky bucket as a meter.

== As a meter ==
Jonathan S. Turner is credited with the original description of the leaky bucket algorithm and describes it as follows: &quot;A counter associated with each user transmitting on a connection is incremented whenever the user sends a packet and is decremented periodically. If the counter exceeds a threshold upon being incremented, the network discards the packet. The user specifies the rate at which the counter is decremented (this determines the average bandwidth) and the value of the threshold (a measure of burstiness)&quot;. The bucket (analogous to the counter) is, in this case, used as a meter to test the conformance of packets, rather than as a queue to directly control them.

Another description of what is essentially the same meter version of the algorithm, the generic cell rate algorithm, is given by the ITU-T in recommendation I.371 and in the ATM Forum&#x27;s UNI specification. The description, in which the term &quot;cell&quot; is equivalent to &quot;packet&quot; in Turner&#x27;s description is given by the ITU-T as follows: &quot;The continuous-state leaky bucket can be viewed as a finite capacity bucket whose real-valued content drains out at a continuous rate of 1 unit of content per time unit and whose content is increased by the increment &quot;T&quot; for each conforming cell... If at a cell arrival the content of the bucket is less than or equal to the limit value &quot;τ&quot;, then the cell is conforming; otherwise, the cell is non-conforming. The capacity of the bucket (the upper bound of the counter) is (&quot;T&quot; + &quot;τ&quot;)&quot;. These specifications also state that, due to its finite capacity, if the contents of the bucket at the time the conformance is tested is greater than the limit value, and hence the cell is non-conforming, then the bucket is left unchanged; that is, the water is simply not added if it would make the bucket overflow.

David E. McDysan and Darrel L. Spohn provide a commentary on the description given by the ITU-T/ATM Forum. In this, they state, &quot;In the leaky bucket analogy, the [ATM] cells do not actually flow through the bucket; only the check for conforming admission does&quot;. However, uncommonly in the descriptions in the literature, McDysan and Spohn also refer to the leaky bucket algorithm as a queue, going on, &quot;Note that one implementation of traffic shaping is to actually have the cells flow through the bucket&quot;.
In describing the operation of the ITU-T&#x27;s version of the algorithm, McDysan and Spohn invoke a &quot;notion commonly employed in queueing theory of a fictional &quot;gremlin&quot;&quot;. This gremlin inspects the level in the bucket and takes action if the level is above the limit value &quot;τ&quot;: in &quot;traffic policing&quot;, it pulls open a trap door, which causes the arriving packet to be dropped and stops its water from entering the bucket; in &quot;traffic shaping&quot;, it pushes up a flap, which delays the arriving packet and prevents it from delivering its water, until the water level in the bucket falls below &quot;τ&quot;.

The difference between the descriptions given by Turner and the ITU-T/ATM Forum is that Turner&#x27;s is specific to traffic policing, whereas the ITU-T/ATM Forum description is applicable to both traffic policing and traffic shaping. Also, Turner does not state that the contents of the counter should only be affected by conforming packets, and should only be incremented when this would not cause it to exceed a limit, i.e. Turner does not explicitly state that the bucket&#x27;s capacity or counter&#x27;s maximum value is finite.

=== Concept of operation ===
A description of the concept of operation of the leaky bucket algorithm as a meter that can be used in either traffic policing or traffic shaping may be described as a fixed capacity bucket, associated with each virtual connection or user. The bucket leaks at a fixed rate. If the bucket is empty, it stops leaking. For a packet to conform, it has to be possible to add a specific amount of water to the bucket The specific amount added by a conforming packet can be the same for all packets or can be proportional to the length of the packet. If this amount of water would cause the bucket to overflow then the packet does not conform and the water in the bucket is left unchanged.

=== Uses ===
The leaky bucket as a meter can be used in either traffic shaping or traffic policing. For example, in ATM networks, in the form of the generic cell rate algorithm, it is used to compare the bandwidth and burstiness of traffic on a virtual channel (VC) or virtual path (VP) against the specified limits on the rate at which cells may arrive and the maximum jitter, or variation in inter-arrival intervals, for the VC or VP. In traffic policing, cells that do not conform to these limits (nonconforming cells) may be dropped or may be reduced in priority for downstream traffic management functions to drop if there is congestion. In traffic shaping, cells are delayed until they conform. Traffic policing and traffic shaping are commonly used in UPC and NPC to protect the network against excess or excessively bursty traffic. (See bandwidth management and congestion avoidance.) Traffic shaping is commonly used in the network interfaces in hosts to prevent transmissions from exceeding the bandwidth or jitter limits and being discarded by traffic management functions in the network. (See scheduling (computing) and network scheduler.)

The leaky bucket algorithm as a meter can also be used in a leaky bucket counter to measure the rate of random (stochastic) processes. A Leaky bucket counter can be used to indicate, by its overflowing when the average or peak rate of events increases above some acceptable background level. For example, such a leaky bucket counter can be used to detect when there is a sudden burst of correctable memory errors or when there has been a gradual, but significant, increase in the average rate, which may indicate an impending correction failure.

The use of the leaky bucket algorithm in a leaky bucket counter is similar to that in traffic management, in that it is used as a meter. Essentially, the events replace the packets in the description, with each event causing a quantity of water to be added to the bucket. If the bucket would overflow, as a result of the event, then the event should trigger the action associated with an out-of-limits event. Some implementations seem to parallel Turner&#x27;s description, in that there is no explicit limit on the maximum value that the counter may take, implying that once the counter has exceeded the threshold, it may not return to its previous state until a period significantly greater than the equivalent of the emission interval has passed, which may be increased by what would otherwise be conforming events. However, other implementations may not increment the counter while it is overflowed, allowing it to correctly determine whether the following events conform or not.

=== Parameters ===
In the case of the leaky bucket algorithm as a meter, the limits on the traffic can be bandwidth and a burstiness of the output. The bandwidth limit and burstiness limit for the connection may be specified in a traffic contract. A bandwidth limit may be specified as a packet rate, a bit rate, or as an emission interval between the packets. A limit on burstiness may be specified as a delay variation tolerance, or as a maximum burst size (MBS).

Multiple sets of contract parameters can be applied concurrently to a connection using multiple instances of the leaky bucket algorithm, each of which may take a bandwidth and a burstiness limit: see .

==== Emission interval ====
The rate at which the bucket leaks will determine the bandwidth limit, which is referred to as the average rate by Turner and the inverse of which is referred to as the emission interval by the ITU-T. It is easiest to explain what this interval is where packets have a fixed length. Hence, the first part of this description assumes this, and the implications of variable packet lengths are considered separately.

Consider a bucket that is exactly filled to the top by preceding traffic, i.e. when the maximum permitted burstiness has already occurred, i.e. the maximum number of packets or cells have just arrived in the minimum amount of time for them to still conform to the bandwidth and jitter limits. The minimum interval before the next packet can conform is then the time it takes for the bucket to leak exactly the amount of water delivered by a packet, and if a packet is tested and conforms at that time, this will exactly fill the bucket once more. Thus, once the bucket is filled, the maximum rate that packets can conform is with this interval between each packet.

Turner refers to this rate as the average, implying that its inverse is the average interval. There is, however, some ambiguity in what the average rate and interval are. Since packets can arrive at any lower rate, this is an upper bound, rather than a fixed value, so it could at best be called the maximum for the average rate. Also, during the time the maximum burstiness occurs, packets can arrive at smaller intervals and thus at a higher rate than this. So, for any period less than infinity, the actual average rate can be (but is not necessarily) greater than this and the average interval can be (but is not necessarily) less than the emission interval. Hence, because of this ambiguity, the term emission interval is used hereafter. However, it is still true that the minimum value that the long-term average interval can take tends to be the emission interval.

For variable-length packets, where the amount added to the bucket is proportional to the packet length, the maximum rate at which they can conform varies according to their length: the amount that the bucket must have leaked from full for a packet to conform is the amount the packet will add, and if this is proportional to the packet length, so is the interval between it and the preceding packet that filled the bucket. Hence, it is not possible to specify a specific emission interval for variable-length packets, and the bandwidth limit has to be specified explicitly, in bits or bytes per second.

==== Delay variation tolerance ====
It is easiest to explain delay variation tolerance for the case where packets have a fixed length. Hence, the first part of this description assumes this, and the implications of variable packet lengths are considered separately.

The ITU-T defines a limit value, &quot;τ&quot;, that is less than the capacity of the bucket by &quot;T&quot; (the amount by which the bucket contents is incremented for each conforming cell), so that the capacity of the bucket is &quot;T&quot; + &quot;τ&quot;. This limit value specifies how much earlier a packet can arrive than it would normally be expected if the packets were arriving with exactly the emission interval between them.

Imagine the following situation: A bucket leaks at 1 unit of water per second, so the limit value, &quot;τ&quot; and the amount of water added by a packet, &quot;T&quot;, are effectively in units of seconds. This bucket starts off empty, so when a packet arrives at the bucket, it does not quite fill the bucket by adding its water &quot;T&quot;, and the bucket is now &quot;τ&quot; below its capacity. So when the next packet arrives the bucket only has to have drained by &quot;T&quot; – &quot;τ&quot; for this to conform. So the interval between these two packets can be as much as &quot;τ&quot; less than &quot;T&quot;.

This extends to multiple packets in a sequence: Imagine the following: The bucket again starts off empty, so the first packet to arrive clearly conforms. The bucket then becomes exactly full after a number of conforming packets, &quot;N&quot;, have arrived in the minimum possible time for them to conform. For the last (the &quot;N&quot;th) packet to conform, the bucket must have leaked enough of the water from the preceding &quot;N&quot; – 1 packets ((&quot;N&quot; – 1)&quot;T&quot; seconds&#x27; worth) for it to be exactly at the limit value &quot;τ&quot; at this time. Hence, the water leaked is (&quot;N&quot; – 1)&quot;T&quot; – &quot;τ&quot;, which because the leak is one unit per second, took exactly (&quot;N&quot; – 1)&quot;T&quot; – &quot;τ&quot; seconds to leak. Thus the shortest time in which all &quot;N&quot; packets can arrive and conform is (&quot;N&quot; – 1)&quot;T&quot; – &quot;τ&quot; seconds, which is exactly &quot;τ&quot; less than the time it would have taken if the packets had been arriving at exactly the emission interval.

However, packets can only arrive with intervals less than &quot;T&quot; when the bucket is not filled by the previous packet. If it is filled, then the bucket must have drained by the full amount &quot;T&quot; before the next packet conforms. So once this bucket space has been used up by packets arriving at less than &quot;T&quot;, subsequent frames must arrive at intervals no less than &quot;T&quot;. They may, however, arrive at greater intervals, when the bucket will not be filled by them. Since the bucket stops leaking when it is empty, there is always a limit (&quot;τ&quot;) to how much tolerance can be accrued by these intervals greater than &quot;T&quot;.

Since the limit value &quot;τ&quot; defines how much earlier a packet can arrive than would be expected, it is the limit on the difference between the maximum and minimum delays from the source to the point where the conformance test is being made (assuming the packets are generated with no jitter). Hence, the use of the term cell delay variation tolerance (CDVt) for this parameter in ATM.

As an example, a possible source of delay variation is where a number of streams of packets are multiplexed together at the output of a switch. Assuming that the sum of the bandwidths of these connections is less than the capacity of the output, all of the packets that arrive can be transmitted eventually. However, if their arrivals are independent, e.g. because they arrive at different inputs of the switch, then several may arrive at or nearly at the same time. Since the output can only transmit one packet at a time, the others must be queued in a buffer until it is their turn to be transmitted. This buffer then introduces an additional delay between a packet arriving at an input and being transmitted by the output, and this delay varies, depending on how many other packets are already queued in the buffer. A similar situation can occur at the output of a host (in the network interface controller) when multiple packets have the same or similar release times, and this delay can usually be modelled as a delay in a virtual output buffer.

For variable length packets, where the amount of water added by a given packet is proportional to its length, &quot;τ&quot; can not be seen as a limit on how full the bucket can be when a packet arrives, as this varies depending on the packet size. However, the time it takes to drain from this level to empty is still how much earlier a packet can arrive than is expected when packets are transmitted at the bandwidth limit. Thus, it is still the maximum variation in transfer delay to the point where the conformance test is being applied that can be tolerated, and thus the tolerance on maximum delay variation.

==== Maximum burst size ====
The limit value or delay variation tolerance also controls how many packets can arrive in a burst, determined by the excess depth of the bucket over the capacity required for a single packet. Hence MBS is also a measure of burstiness or jitter, and it is possible to specify the burstiness as an MBS and derive the limit value &quot;τ&quot; from this or to specify it as a jitter or delay variation tolerance or limit value, and derive the MBS from this.

A burst or clump of packets can arrive at a higher rate than determined by the emission interval &quot;T&quot;. This may be the line rate of the physical layer connection when the packets in the burst will arrive back-to-back. However, as in ATM, the tolerance may be applied to a lower rate, in that case, the Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR), and the burst of packets (cells) can arrive at a higher rate, but less than the line rate of the physical layer, in that case, the Peak Cell Rate (PCR). The MBS may then be the number of cells needed to transport a higher layer packet (see Segmentation and reassembly), where the packets are transmitted with a maximum bandwidth determined by the SCR and cells within the packets are transmitted at the PCR; thus allowing the last cell of the packet, and the packet itself, to arrive significantly earlier than it would if the cells were sent at the SCR: transmission duration = (MBS-1)/PCR rather than (MBS-1)/SCR. This bursting at the PCR puts a significantly higher load on shared resources, e.g. switch output buffers, than does transmission at the SCR, and is thus more likely to result in buffer overflows and network congestion. However, it puts a lesser load on these resources than would transmitting at the SCR with a limit value, &quot;τSCR&quot;, that allows MBS cells to be transmitted and arrive back-to-back at the line rate.

If the limit value is large enough, then several packets can arrive in a burst and still conform: if the bucket starts from empty, the first packet to arrive will add &quot;T&quot;, but if, by the time the next packet arrives, the contents is below &quot;τ&quot;, this will also conform. Assuming that each packet takes &quot;δ&quot; to arrive, then if &quot;τ&quot; (expressed as the time it takes the bucket to empty from the limit value) is equal to or greater than the emission interval less the minimum interarrival time, &quot;T&quot; – &quot;δ&quot;, the second packet will conform even if it arrives as a burst with the first. Similarly, if &quot;τ&quot; is equal to or greater than (&quot;T&quot; – &quot;δ&quot;) × 2, then 3 packets can arrive in a burst, etc.

The maximum size of this burst, &quot;M&quot;, can be calculated from the emission interval, &quot;T&quot;; the maximum jitter tolerance, &quot;τ&quot;; and the time taken to transmit/receive a packet, &quot;δ&quot;, as follows:

::formula_1

Equally, the minimum value of jitter tolerance &quot;τ&quot; that gives a specific MBS can be calculated from the MBS as follows:

::formula_2

In the case of ATM, where technically MBS only relates to the SCR tolerance, in the above equation the time it takes each packet to arrive, &quot;δ&quot;, is the emission interval for cells at the PCR &quot;TPCR&quot;, and the emission interval, &quot;T&quot;, is the emission interval for the SCR &quot;TSCR&quot;. Where MBS is to be the number of cells required to transport a segmented packet, the limit value in the above, &quot;τ&quot;, should be that for the SCR &quot;τSCR&quot;. However, at the UNI or an NNI, where cells at the PCR will have been subjected to delay variation, it should be the limit value for the SCR plus that for the PCR &quot;τSCR&quot; + &quot;τPCR&quot;.

For variable-length packets, the maximum burst size will depend on the lengths of the packets in the burst and there is no single value for the maximum burst size. However, it is possible to specify the total burst length in bytes, from the byte rate of the input stream, the equivalent byte rate of the leak, and the bucket depth.

=== Comparison with the token bucket algorithm ===
The leaky bucket algorithm is sometimes contrasted with the token bucket algorithm. However, the above concept of operation for the leaky bucket as a meter may be directly compared with the token bucket algorithm, the description of which is given as the following:

:*A token is added to the bucket every 1/&quot;r&quot; seconds.

:*The bucket can hold at the most &quot;b&quot; tokens. If a token arrives when the bucket is full, it is discarded.

:*When a packet (network layer PDU) of &quot;n&quot; bytes arrives, &quot;n&quot; tokens are removed from the bucket, and the packet is sent to the network.

:*If fewer than &quot;n&quot; tokens are available, no tokens are removed from the bucket, and the packet is considered to be non-conformant.

This can be compared with the leaky bucket, repeated from above:

:*A fixed capacity bucket, associated with each virtual connection or user, leaks at a fixed rate.

:* If the bucket is empty, it stops leaking.

:*For a packet to conform, it has to be possible to add a specific amount of water to the bucket: The specific amount added by a conforming packet can be the same for all packets or can be proportional to the length of the packet.

:*If this amount of water would cause the bucket to exceed its capacity then the packet does not conform and the water in the bucket is left unchanged.

As can be seen, these two descriptions are essentially mirror images of one another: one adds something to the bucket on a regular basis and takes something away for conforming packets down to a limit of zero; the other takes away regularly and adds for conforming packets up to a limit of the bucket&#x27;s capacity. Both are effectively the same as these are the same basic algorithm described differently.

== As a queue ==

The leaky bucket as a queue is essentially a way of describing a simple FIFO buffer or queue that is serviced at a fixed rate to remove burstiness or jitter. A description of it is given by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, in (an older version of) his book &quot;Computer Networks&quot; as &quot;The leaky bucket consists of a finite queue. When a packet arrives, if there is room on the queue it is appended to the queue; otherwise it is discarded. At every clock tick one packet is transmitted (unless the queue is empty)&quot;. An implementation of the leaky bucket as a queue is therefore always a form of traffic shaping function.

As can be seen, this implementation is restricted in that the packets are only ever transmitted at a fixed rate. To underline this, Tanenbaum also states that &quot;The leaky bucket algorithm enforces a rigid output pattern at the average rate, no matter how bursty the [input] traffic is.&quot; However, this assertion is only strictly true as long as the queue does not become empty: if the average arrival rate is less than the rate of clock ticks, or if the input is sufficiently bursty that the losses bring the rate of the remainder below the clock tick rate (i.e. gaps in the input stream are long enough and the queue is small enough that it can become empty), there will be gaps in the output stream.

A further restriction is that the leaky bucket as a queue traffic shaping function only transmits packets on the ticks; hence, if it is used within a network, equivalent to UPC and NPC, it also imposes a fixed phase on the onward transmission of packets. Whereas, when using a leaky bucket meter to control onward transmission, a packet is transmitted as soon as it conforms, i.e. relative to the previous one or, if it already conforms, its arrival time; not according to some arbitrary local clock. Perversely, in the context of the transfer delay, this imposition of a fixed phase that may, over time, differ from that of an otherwise conforming input packet stream, constitutes a delay variation and hence a jitter. Jitter caused in this particular way could only be observed where the delay is measured as the transit time between two separate measurement points, one either side of the leaky bucket as a queue shaping function. However, in the context of real-time data transmissions, it is this end-to-end delay that determines the latency of received data. Hence, the leaky bucket as a queue is unsuitable for traffic shaping real-time transmissions.

Limiting variable-length packets using the leaky bucket algorithm as a queue is significantly more complicated than it is for fixed-length packets. Tanenbaum gives a description of a &quot;byte-counting&quot; leaky bucket for variable length packets as follows: &quot;At each tick, a counter is initialized to n. If the first packet on the queue has fewer bytes than the current value of the counter, it is transmitted, and the counter is decremented by that number of bytes. Additional packets may also be sent, as long as the counter is high enough. When the counter drops below the length of the next packet on the queue, transmission stops until the next tick, at which time the residual byte count is reset [to n] and the flow can continue&quot;. As with the version for fixed length packets, this implementation has a strong effect on the phase of transmissions, resulting in variable end-to-end delays, and unsuitability for real-time traffic shaping.

=== Uses ===
The leaky bucket as a queue can only be used in shaping traffic to a specified bandwidth with no jitter in the output. It may be used within the network, e.g. as part of bandwidth management, but is more appropriate to traffic shaping in the network interfaces of hosts. Leaky bucket algorithm is used in Nginx&#x27;s &quot;ngx_http_limit_conn_module&quot; module for limiting the number of concurrent connections originating from a single IP address.

=== Parameters ===
In the case of the leaky bucket algorithm as a queue, the only defined limit for this algorithm is the bandwidth of its output.

The bandwidth limit for the connection may be specified in a traffic contract. A bandwidth limit may be specified as a packet or frame rate, a byte or bit rate, or as an emission interval between the packets.

=== Inefficiency ===
The implementation of the leaky bucket as a queue does not use available network resources efficiently. Because it transmits packets only at fixed intervals, there will be many instances when the traffic volume is very low and large portions of network resources (bandwidth in particular) are not being used. Therefore no mechanism exists in the leaky-bucket implementation as a queue to allow individual flows to burst up to port speed, effectively consuming network resources at times when there would not be resource contention in the network. Implementations of the token bucket and leaky bucket as a meter do, however, allow output traffic flows to have bursty characteristics. 

== Comparison between the two versions ==
Analysis of the two versions of the leaky bucket algorithm shows that the version as a queue is a special case of the version as a meter.

Imagine a traffic shaping function for fixed-length packets that is implemented using a fixed-length queue, forming a delay element, which is serviced using a leaky bucket as a meter. Imagine also that the bucket in this meter has a depth equal to the amount added by a packet, i.e. has a limit value, &quot;τ&quot;, of zero. However, the conformance test is only performed at intervals of the emission interval, when the packet at the head of the queue is transmitted and its water is added. This water then leaks away during the next emission interval (or is removed just prior to performing the next conformance test), allowing the next packet to conform then or at some subsequent emission interval. The service function can also be viewed in terms of a token bucket with the same depth, where enough tokens for one packet are added (if the bucket is not full) at the emission intervals. This implementation will then receive packets with a bursty arrival pattern (limited by the queue depth) and transmit them on at intervals that are always exact (integral) multiples of the emission interval.

However, the implementation of the leaky bucket as a meter (or token bucket) in a traffic shaping function described above is an exact equivalent to the description of the leaky bucket as a queue: the delay element of the meter version is the bucket of the queue version; the bucket of the meter version is the process that services the queue, and the leak is such that the emission interval is the same as the tick interval. Therefore for fixed length packets, the implementation of the leaky bucket as a queue is of a special case of a traffic shaping function using a leaky bucket (or token bucket) as a meter in which the limit value, &quot;τ&quot;, is zero and the process of testing conformance is performed at the lowest possible rate.

The leaky bucket as a queue for variable packet lengths can also be described as equivalent to a special case of the leaky bucket as a meter. The suggested implementation can, like the fixed length implementation, be seen as traffic shaping function in which the queue is a delay element, rather than the bucket, and the function that services the queue is, in this case, explicitly given as a token bucket: it is decremented for conforming packets and incremented at a fixed rate. Hence, as the leaky bucket as a meter and token bucket are equivalent, the leaky bucket as a queue for variable packet lengths is also a special case of a traffic shaping function using a leaky bucket (or token bucket) as a meter.

There is an interesting consequence of seeing the leaky bucket as a queue for variable packet lengths as a specific implementation of the token bucket or leaky bucket as a meter in traffic shaping. This is that the bucket of the meter has a depth, n, and, as is always the case with the token bucket, this depth determines the burstiness of the output traffic (perhaps in relation to the average or minimum number of tokens required by the packets). Hence, it is possible to quantify the burstiness of the output of this &quot;byte counting&quot; leaky bucket as a meter, unless all packets are of the maximum length when it becomes pointless. However, this ability to define a burstiness for the output is in direct contradiction to the statement that the leaky bucket (as a queue) necessarily gives an output with a rigid rate, no matter how bursty the input.

<doc id="1056500" wikidata="Q245930" url="?curid=1056500" title="Return on capital">
<text>Return on capital (ROC), or return on invested capital (ROIC), is a ratio used in finance, valuation and accounting, as a measure of the profitability and value-creating potential of companies relative to the amount of capital invested by shareholders and other debtholders. It indicates how effective a company is at turning capital into profits. 

The ratio is calculated by dividing the after tax operating income (NOPAT) by the average book-value of the invested capital (IC). 

==Return on invested capital formula==

There are three main components of this measurement: 

* While ratios such as return on equity and return on assets use net income as the numerator, ROIC uses net operating income after tax (NOPAT), which means that after-tax expenses (income) from financing activities are added back to (deducted from) net income.
* While many financial computations use market value instead of book value (for instance, calculating debt-to-equity ratios or calculating the weights for the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)), ROIC uses book values of the invested capital as the denominator. This procedure is done because, unlike market values which reflect future expectations in efficient markets, book values more closely reflect the amount of initial capital invested to generate a return. 
* The denominator represents the average value of the invested capital rather than the value of the end of the year. This is because the NOPAT represents a sum of money flows, while the value of the invested capital changes every day (e.g., the invested capital on December 31 could be 30% lower than the invested capital on December 30). Because the exact average is difficult to calculate, it is often estimated by taking the average between the IC at the beginning of the year and the IC at the end of the year.

Some practitioners make an additional adjustment to the formula to add depreciation, amortization, and depletion charges back to the numerator. These charges are considered by some to be &quot;non-cash expenses&quot; which are often included as part of operating expenses. The practice of adding these back is said to more closely reflect the cash return of a firm over a given period of time. However, others (such as Warren Buffett) argue that depreciation should not be excluded seeing that it represents a real cash outflow. When a company purchases a depreciating asset, the cost is not immediately expensed on the income statement. Instead, it is capitalized on the balance sheet as an asset. Over time, the depreciation expenses on the income statement will reduce the asset value on the balance sheet. In turn, depreciation represents the delayed expensing of the initial cash outflow that purchased the asset, and is thus a rather liberal accounting practice.

==Relationship with WACC==
Because financial theory states that the value of an investment is determined by both the amount of and risk of its expected cash flows to an investor, ROIC and its relationship to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). 

The cost of capital is the return expected from investors for bearing the risk that the projected cash flows of an investment deviate from expectations. It is said that for investments in which future cash flows are incrementally less certain, rational investors require incrementally higher rates of return as compensation for bearing higher degrees of risk. In corporate finance, WACC is a common measurement of the minimum expected weighted average return of all investors in a company given the riskiness of its future cash flows.

Since return on invested capital is said to measure the ability of a firm to generate a return on its capital, and since WACC is said to measure the minimum expected return demanded by the firm&#x27;s capital providers, the difference between ROIC and WACC is sometimes referred to as a firm&#x27;s &quot;excess return&quot;, or &quot;economic profit&quot;.

<text>The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (LLS), a 501(c)(3) charitable organization founded in 1949, is a voluntary health organization dedicated to fighting blood cancer world-wide. LLS funds blood cancer research on cures for leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, and myeloma. It provides free information and support services, and it advocates for blood cancer patients and their families seeking access to quality and affordable care.

LLS is headquartered in Rye Brook, New York, with 27 regional offices throughout the United States and five regional offices in Canada. The organization has raised and donated more than $1.7 billion (USD) to blood cancer research.

The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society had a four-star rating with Charity Navigator in 2023, scoring 97%.

== History ==
===Robert Roesler de Villiers Foundation (1949–1954)===
Originally known as the Robert Roesler de Villiers Foundation, The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society was founded in New York City in 1949 by Rudolph and Antoinette de Villiers after the death of their son Robert from leukemia. The foundation was led by Antoinette, starting with a small Manhattan office with an initial investment of two thousand dollars and a small staff of volunteers. At the time, there was a lack of effective medications, support facilities, and single-agent chemotherapy.

The organization sponsored annual international research competitions with monetary awards to conduct research for treating leukemia. In 1951 the organization launched a contest for the best research paper on leukemia treatment. In the first year, there were 30 entries but no winners. The following year, Ludwik Gross was selected for the first prize and a grant to continue research.

===Leukemia Society (1955–1965)===
The organization changed its name to the Leukemia Society in 1955. During this era, the Leukemia Society opened local chapters in the New York Metro area. By 1957, the Leukemia Society had chapters in Brooklyn, NY; Massapequa, NY; Little Neck, NY; and Westchester County. The Leukemia Society created its first Patient Services Committee in 1959.

===Leukemia Society of America (1966–1999)===
In 1966, the organization was renamed Leukemia Society of America. In 1968, the Leukemia Society of America published &quot;Closing In, Research on Leukemia&quot;, a book summarizing its progress in fighting leukemia.

In 1968, the Patient Services Committee created the Patient Aid Programs that helped cover patient medications, lab fees, blood transfusions, transportation, and medical services support.

William Dameshek organized and created the LLS grant review process in the early 1960s. Due to his contributions to leukemia research and the organization, the Leukemia Society of America created the Dameshek Award in 1969.

The Leukemia Society of America became known for its fundraising campaigns, such as Four Hours for Life in 1983 and the Leukemia Cup Regatta in 1994.

In 1987 the Leukemia Society of America partnered with the Leukemia Research Fund (U.K.). It launched the peer-reviewed medical Journal, &quot;Leukemia&quot;. The Journal continues publishing today under the Nature Publishing Group.

In 1990, the Leukemia Society of America published an adult patient support book, &quot;Coping with Survival, Support for People Living with Adult Leukemia and Lymphoma&quot;.

===The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (2000–present)===
The name was changed to The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (LLS) in 2000 to reflect the organization&#x27;s focus on all types of blood cancer. In 2004, LLS became affiliated with the Leukemia Research Fund of Canada, which became known as The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society of Canada.

Louis J. DeGennaro was hired in 2005 and appointed President &amp; CEO in 2014.

The organization launched the LLS National Patient Registry in honor of Michael Garil. Blood cancer patients voluntarily enrolled in the registry. The platform digitally compiles medical records so patients can access medical records across healthcare systems. In 2021, The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society Registry began collecting COVID-19 vaccine data from blood cancer patients. The platform provided the largest COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy data set in blood cancer patients.

LLS was awarded a place on Fast Company’s 2022 Brands That Matter list. The organization has a Four-Star rating with Charity Navigator.

In 2023, the organization announced E. Anders Kolb as its President and Chief Executive Officer.

== Research ==
Since its founding, The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society has contributed more than $1.6 billion (USD) to blood cancer research. As there are no means of preventing blood cancers, LLS is focused on funding research for every type of blood cancer to advance treatments and cures. The organization funds research in areas of unmet medical need and helps to bridge the gap between academic discovery and drug development.

=== Acute leukemia ===
==== Acute myeloid leukemia ====
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing disease that remains one of the most deadly blood cancers, killing more than 11,000 Americans a year. Despite advances in treating other blood cancers, the standard of treatment for AML – a combination of toxic chemotherapies – has changed little over the past four decades. In October 2016, LLS launched its Beat AML Master Clinical Trial, a collaborative precision medicine clinical trial that identifies targeted therapies for patients based on their genetic markers.

LLS is leading the Beat AML Master Clinical Trial and is the first nonprofit cancer organization to sponsor a cancer clinical trial. The trial is a collaboration among multiple leading cancer centers, pharmaceutical companies, a clinical research organization, and a genomics analysis company. The protocol for the trial was developed with input from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Beat AML Master Clinical Trial is expected to eventually include 500 patients and will continue for at least two more years at between 15 and 20 clinical sites.

=== Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ===
LLS currently contributes towards research into immunotherapies targeting acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). As part of a wider funding effort including over a dozen other cancer immunotherapy projects, LLS supports more effective and targeted treatments utilizing the body&#x27;s own internal attack mechanisms. In late 2017, LLS awarded researchers at UNC School of Medicine a $600,000 grant to support clinical research on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies with an immunosuppressive &quot;safety switch&quot;. This approach aims to mitigate the potentially lethal side effects of immunotherapy—such as cytokine release syndrome—by halting the activity of infused T cells, in the event a patient experiences severe treatment toxicity.

==Patient support==
The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society is a source of blood cancer information, education and support for patients, their families, survivors, and healthcare professionals. In 1997, LLS created the Information Resource Center (IRC) to provide blood cancer patients, their families, and healthcare professionals with accurate, current disease information, resources, and support.

LLS Blood Cancer Information Specialists are master&#x27;s level oncology social workers, nurses, and health educators. An LLS Blood Cancer Information Specialist can assist patients through cancer treatment, financial and social challenges, and can provide accurate, up-to-date disease, treatment, and support information. As a community-based voluntary health organization, LLS has regional offices throughout the United States and Canada to support blood cancer patients in North America.

== Advocacy ==
The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society&#x27;s Office of Public Policy advances LLS&#x27;s mission through advocacy aimed at governmental decision-makers. Through LLS&#x27;s nationwide grassroots network of more than 30,000 volunteers, LLS advocates for blood cancer patients at the state and federal level. These efforts help to increase federal and state research funds for blood cancer; expedite the review and approval for new blood cancer new therapies, and ensure that patients are able to access their treatments. LLS also supports public policy positions that accelerate progress toward cures for blood cancers, and improve the quality of life of blood cancer patients and their families.

==Fundraising==
LLS has five fundraising campaigns: Light The Night, Team In Training, Visionaries of the Year, Student Visionaries of the Year, and Big Climb. 
Light The Night is The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society&#x27;s largest community initiative to build awareness of blood cancers as well as raise money for research and support of patients and their families. Participants carry illuminated lanterns of different colors. White lanterns are carried by survivors, red by supporters, and gold lanterns are carried by those walking in memory of a loved one they lost. Patients, their family, friends, and colleagues take part in the annual evening walk which is at a leisurely pace, ensuring that all participants are able to enjoy the event.

<text>Daejeon Hana Citizen FC () is a South Korean professional football team based in Daejeon that competes in the K League 1, the top tier of South Korean football. At the time of its foundation in 1997, Daejeon Citizen was the first community club in South Korea, not belonging to any company. The club first entered the K League for the 1997 season, finishing in seventh place. In spite of a limited budget, Daejeon won the 2001 Korean FA Cup. It has not achieved sustained success in the K League, historically occupying the middle and lower reaches of the standings each season. At the end of the 2013 season, Daejeon was relegated to the K League Challenge, the second-tier league.

On 24 December 2019, Hana Financial Group Football Club Foundation bought operating rights of the club, renaming the club to its current name.

==History==

===First steps into the K League===
Following the foundation of the professional football league (the Korean Super League, reorganised as the K League in 1998) in Korea, there were few league matches held in Daejeon, and such matches that were held were played by visiting clubs. The absence of a local team in the league made it difficult for the citizens of Daejeon to identify with any particular team. However, in 1996 a plan to establish &#x27;Daejeon Citizen&#x27; – their own local community club – was unveiled, which meant Daejeon citizens would have their own team to support in the league. Generally in Korea, &#x27;community-club&#x27; means that the club issues shares. In the case of Daejeon, although shares weren&#x27;t issued until 2005 (and the issuing of shares continued into 2006), they were already known as a &quot;community club&quot;. Daejeon was the first club that did not belong to a specific company such as one of the &#x27;chaebols&#x27; (Samsung, LG or the like) or another major company. This has a very symbolic meaning as essentially the club is founded upon the support of the local community rather than a specific company.

Kim Ki-bok was appointed the first manager of Daejeon Citizen. With high expectations, Daejeon took their first step to the K League in 1997 (at the time, the K League was known as the Rapido Super League), opening their season with a match against Ulsan Hyundai Horang-i. However, the results achieved in their first season did not live up to their high expectations for their first season. Although the club placed seventh in the league, ahead of Cheonan Ilhwa Chunma, Anyang LG Cheetahs and Bucheon SK, they won only three matches out of 18 games.

===The IMF Crisis===
In 1998, a major economic crisis necessitated IMF intervention in the South Korean economy – this period of time is commonly referred to as the &quot;IMF crisis&quot; in South Korea. As a consequence a number of companies, including some considered to be &quot;Chaebol&quot; went bankrupt, and there was widespread unemployment. Daejeon Citizen did not escape this crisis unscathed. The main board of Daejeon consisted of 4 groups – Kyeryong Construction Industrial, Dong-A Construction, DongYang Department Store and Chung-cheong Bank. But as a consequence of the IMF crisis, three of the four groups went bankrupt, leaving Kyeryong as the only survivor of the original board. There was a subsequent impact on the level of financial and management support provided to the club. This made for a particularly difficult season in the 1998 season of the K League. Again, only three games were won, but this time Daejeon finished ninth in the league, ahead of only Cheonan Ilhwa Chunma.

The following year, 1999, Daejeon improved their winning record to six victories. However, changes in the K League structure since the previous year meant that an extra 9 games were played, 27 in total, from the previous season. There were a total of 18 losses, the worst in the league. Despite this, Daejeon improved to eighth out of ten clubs. For the 2000 season, Daejeon maintained its eighth position in the league.

===On the verge of disappearing===
For the 2001 season, Lee Tae-ho was appointed manager, and promptly took Daejeon Citizen&#x27;s first piece of silverware, leading Daejeon to victory in the FA Cup. The decisive goal of the FA Cup final came from Kim Eun-jung, which gave the team a one-nil victory over the Pohang Steelers. Due to this win, Daejeon also qualified to the 2002–03 AFC Champions League for the first time. This helped compensate for their poor performance in the K League, in which they finished 10th and last, even on points with Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors but with an inferior goal differential.

South Korea was a co-host of the 2002 FIFA Football World Cup, with Daejeon as one of the host cities. The city constructed a brand new stadium for the World Cup, and following the conclusion of the tournament, Daejeon Citizen changed stadiums. The shift from their former stadium, Daejeon Hanbat Stadium, to Daejeon World Cup Stadium meant the club not only benefited from the new facilities, but also the greater capacity of the stadium. Daejeon&#x27;s poor league performance from the previous year was carried into the 2002 season, and the club finished last again, and by some margin, having won but a single game throughout the season. Lee Tae-ho eventually resigned taking responsibility for the poor results. However, more creditable results were achieved in the AFC Champions League. Although they did not make proceed beyond the group phase, they did finish second in the group, beating both Shanghai Shenhua and Kashima Antlers. Their only loss was to the eventual group winner and overall runner-up, Thai club BEC Tero Sasana.

In other changes for 2002, the key financial supporter of the club – Kyeryong, which with their support ensured that Daejeon Citizen would survive the IMF crisis – declared that they would withdraw from the club&#x27;s board. Daejeon City Hall decided to give financial support to the club. This ensured the club would survive to participate in the 2003 season.

===Miracle 2003===
The 2003 season proved to be memorable for Daejeon fans. Choi Yun-kyum, previously coach at Bucheon SK, was appointed manager to replace Lee Tae-ho who had resigned in the wake of the club&#x27;s 2002 season. Choi promptly inspired the team and completely changed its dynamics by implementing the 4–3–3 formation. The outcome was a near miraculous recovery from 2002, and he, together with Daejeon Citizen, coined the catchphrase &quot;Miracle 2003&quot;. Daejeon Citizen finished the 2003 season in sixth place, its best finish ever in the league, having won 18 out of 44 games. Its sixth place was even more meritorious as the K League had expanded to twelve teams, with Daegu FC and Gwangju Sangmu Phoenix entering the competition for the first time. Daejeon also improved its average home game attendance to about 19,000.

It proved difficult for the club to maintain its performance into 2004. A lack of strike power at the attacking end of the field left the club with the worst offensive record of all the clubs in the K League, scoring 18 goals in 24 games. Daejeon slipped to eleventh place out of thirteen teams. However, they did make it to the semi-finals of the FA Cup, going down to eventual runners-up, Bucheon SK. Daejeon also finished as runners-up in the Hauzen Cup, behind only Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma.

The lack of penetration continued to be problematic into the 2005 season, with the club maintaining its record as the worst offensive side in the league, with only 19 goals scored in 24 games. However, superb defence saw only 20 goals conceded (best defensive record in the league) ensuring that Daejeon finished seventh in the regular season, having lost only six games. In the 2005 cup competitions, the FA Cup and the League Cup, Daejeon failed to progress to the quarter-final stage.

===2007 Play-off qualification===

Daejeon achieved what originally appeared by midseason at least, to be a highly unlikely qualification for the playoff phase of the K League following a 1–0 win over Suwon Samsung Bluewings which ensured a superior goal difference to FC Seoul, with whom Daejeon finished equal on points. The win over Suwon was Daejeon&#x27;s fifth consecutive victory and ultimately enabled them to qualify for the championship playoffs for the first time in their history. By midseason, it had seemed like another disappointing season was in store for Daejeon fans, with precious few wins recorded, and a number of losses. When Kim Ho took over from previous manager Choi Yun-kyum in the mid-season, Daejeon were sitting in eleventh place. However, under the guidance of their coach, and with good performances from Denilson, who scored 14 goals, and one of Korea&#x27;s best technical players, Ko Jong-soo, they eventually qualified for the play-offs. They were ultimately beaten by Ulsan Hyundai in the first phase of the play-offs.

==Stadium==
Since the 2002 K League season, which kicked off within a few weeks of the conclusion of the 2002 FIFA Football World Cup, Daejeon Citizen FC have played their home games at Daejeon World Cup Stadium. The stadium was specifically constructed for the world cup, and was completed in September 2001. Daejeon World Cup Stadium hosted two group games of the world cup, as well as the South Korea/Italy quarter-final. The fans of Daejeon Citizen have nicknamed the stadium &quot;Purple Arena&quot;. The stadium has a seating capacity of 40,535. The last four home games of the 2014 season were played at the Hanbat Stadium, Daejeon&#x27;s old ground to allow time for maintenance work to be carried out at World Cup Stadium. Daejeon will return to the World Cup Stadium for the 2015 season.

<doc id="1056512" wikidata="Q17078574" url="?curid=1056512" title="Rio PMP300">
<text>The Rio PMP300 is one of the first portable consumer MP3 digital audio players, and the first commercially successful one. Produced by Diamond Multimedia, it was introduced September 15, 1998 as the first in the &quot;Rio&quot; series of digital audio players, and it shipped later that year.

==Features==
Roughly the dimensions of a deck of cards (3.5 inches by 2.5 inches and 0.625 inches thick), the Rio is black, and features an LCD screen and a circular pad with control buttons. The device has controls for skipping tracks forwards or backwards, repeat, random play and four preset equalizer settings. The LCD displays the track number being played and the track play time. It can play MP2 and MP3 format audio files, and has support for a variety of bitrates, including MP3 variable-bitrate (VBR) support.

It shipped with 32 MB of internal memory and has a SmartMedia slot, allowing users to add additional memory. It is powered by a single AA battery, which provides between 8 and 12 hours of playback time. Connection to a personal computer is through the computer&#x27;s parallel port, with a proprietary connector on the Rio&#x27;s edge.

The Rio retailed for US $200 with the ability to hold around 30 minutes of music at a bitrate of 128 kbit/s. An upgraded version was later released, which is colored translucent green and equipped with a larger 64 MB internal memory, at a cost of $250. The Rio also spawned one of the first Digital Music service providers (ASP or SaaS Cloud Service), RioPort. RioPort was the first digital music service to license secure, single-track commercial downloads from major record labels.

The Rio PMP300 was supplied with a copy of the &quot;Music Match&quot; software for managing the user&#x27;s MP3 library. A selection of folk/country/blues MP3s were also provided, the metadata for which was in a Music Match specific format rather than as ID3 tags. 

===Design flaws===

The Rio PMP300 suffered from a few design flaws. The battery compartment door flap is notorious for breaking. The battery cover is difficult to repair due to the stress caused by the spring-loaded battery compartment and the fragile plastic used for the door clips. The metal hinge used to hold the compartment to the base of the unit would put strain on the plastic casing, causing cracks around the SmartMedia slot. The silver colored coating on the main central control button in the original 32 MB unit would often peel and flake off with use. The control disc would commonly fall off.

==Legal disputes==

On October 8, 1998, the Recording Industry Association of America, filed suit and asked for a temporary restraining order to prevent the sale of the Rio player in the Central District Court of California, claiming the player violated the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act. See &quot;RIAA v. Diamond Multimedia&quot;.

Judge Andrea Collins issued the temporary order on October 16, but required the RIAA to post a $500,000 bond that would be used to compensate Diamond for damages incurred in the delay if Diamond eventually prevailed in court. Diamond then announced that it would temporarily delay shipment of the Rio.

On October 26, Judge Collins denied the RIAA&#x27;s application.
On appeal, the Ninth Circuit held that the Rio&#x27;s space shifting was fair use and not a copyright infringement.

After the lawsuit ended, Diamond sold 200,000 players.

==Software support==
Diamond no longer provides support for the Rio, and the last version of Microsoft Windows to work with Diamond&#x27;s Rio software was Windows 98. Independently produced freeware programs such as &quot;Dreaming of Brazil&quot; or &quot;RIOsitude&quot; can still be used to upload audio files to the player. Similarly, limited Linux command-line based support for the Rio is provided by the &quot;rioutils&quot; package.

==Rivals==
Market rivals of the Diamond Rio included the original RCA Lyra and the Creative Nomad.

<text>This is a list of [[mayor]]s of [[Barcelona]] since 1835. The Mayor of Barcelona is the highest political authority of the Barcelona City Council. In accordance with Organic Law 5/1985, of June 19, on the General Electoral Regime (currently in force), the mayor or mayoress is elected by the municipal corporation of councilors, who in turn are elected by universal suffrage by the citizens of Barcelona with the right to vote, through municipal elections held every four years. The candidate who obtains the absolute majority of the votes is proclaimed elected. If none of them obtains said majority, the councilor who heads the most voted list is proclaimed mayor.

== History ==
Barcelona City Council has had a total of 118 mayors since it was founded in 1835. The first mayor of the city was José Mariano de Cabanes, who held office for six months, between November 1835 and April 1836. Among the mayors who have especially gone down in history, can be noted Francisco de Paula Rius i Taulet (promoting and holding the mayoralty at the Universal Exposition of 1888, during the Bourbon Restoration), Carles Pi i Sunyer (first mayor elected by universal suffrage, during the Second Republic), José María de Porcioles (mayor who held office the longest, during the Franco dictatorship), Narcís Serra (first mayor elected in the current democratic system), Pasqual Maragall (mayor who held office the longest in democracy as well as for promoting and holding the mayoralty in the 1992 Olympic Games) or Ada Colau (the first female mayor in the history of the city).

<doc id="1056515" wikidata="Q7075692" url="?curid=1056515" title="Occidental Park">
<text>Occidental Park, also referred to as Occidental Square (north of S. Main Street) and Occidental Mall (south of S. Main Street), is a 0.6 acre (2,400 m2) public park located in the Pioneer Square district of Seattle, Washington.

== Description and history ==
Created in 1971, the park consists of the Occidental Avenue S. right-of-way between S. Washington and S. Jackson Streets, in addition to half a city block between S. Main and S. Jackson Streets. It is the site of the former Carrollton Hotel, run by a Japanese American family and described in Monica Sone&#x27;s memoir &quot;Nisei Daughter&quot;, which was demolished in 1956. The former Waterfront Streetcar bisected the park, running along S. Main Street. The park is in the heart of Seattle&#x27;s largest art gallery district, and several galleries face onto Occidental Mall. The Downtown Seattle Association began &quot;activating&quot; the park with summertime seating and activities in 2015 under a public–private partnership, also bringing events to be hosted in the park.

Occidental Park is the starting point for the &quot;March to the Match&quot;, a five-block parade of Seattle Sounders FC soccer fans led by the Emerald City Supporters to Lumen Field prior to each home game. The park is also used for a weekly farmers&#x27; market and seasonal events managed by the Downtown Seattle Association.

The &quot;Fallen Firefighters Memorial&quot; is a bronze sculpture group by Hai Ying Wu. It was inspired by the deaths of four Seattle firefighters who died January 5, 1995 fighting a fire in the Mary Pang warehouse in Seattle&#x27;s International District.

<doc id="1056522" wikidata="Q7634025" url="?curid=1056522" title="Sue Bradford">
<text>Sue Bradford (born 1 July 1952 in Auckland) is a New Zealand activist, academic, and former New Zealand politician who served as a list Member of Parliament representing the Green Party from 1999 to 2009.

Bradford is an eco-socialist. In 2019, she penned an op-ed stating her reluctance to vote for the Green Party in the future. She criticised the party from the left in regards to her opinion that the party underwent a centrist direction under the leadership of James Shaw and Marama Davidson. Bradford had previously run for the leadership of the Greens on a left-wing platform, losing to Metiria Turei in 2009.

== Early life ==
Sue Bradford graduated from the University of Auckland in History and Political Studies, and later obtained an MA in Chinese. Furthering her academic education she undertook postgraduate study at the University of Canterbury where she received a diploma in journalism, and a PhD in Public Policy at Auckland University of Technology. The title of her doctoral thesis was: &quot;A major left wing think tank in Aotearoa: An impossible dream or a call to action?&quot;, and the work was supervised by Marilyn Waring and Judy McGregor. She has also spent time on the unemployment benefit and the domestic purposes benefit.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Bradford had a high profile as an activist against various social and economic reforms pursued by the governments of the day. Accordingly, she became something of a &quot;bête noire&quot; amongst supporters of the right in New Zealand.

Bradford admitted in 2000 she has countless convictions.

Bradford was trespassed from Parliament in 1998.

==Member of Parliament ==



As a member of the Green Party, Bradford first won election to the Parliament as a list MP in the 1999 election. She had joined the Green Party in 1990, and had contested the 1998 Auckland mayoral election as the Green candidate. Before joining the Greens, she worked actively in the NewLabour Party, and served as its vice-president from 1989 to 1990.

 Bradford was the Green Party spokesperson on ACC, Agriculture, Buy Kiwi-Made, Community and Voluntary Sector, Community Economic Development, Gambling, Housing, Industrial Relations, Internal Affairs, Mental Health, National Library and Archives, Racing, Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Small Business and Social Development.

&quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; selected Bradford as &quot;Backbencher of the Year&quot; for 2000.

Bradford has successfully pushed through three member&#x27;s bills: removing the defence of &quot;reasonable force&quot; when corporally punishing or smacking children; letting mothers in jail keep their babies for longer; and making the adult minimum wage apply to 16- and 17-year-olds. It is considered an achievement for a backbench MP to pass a single member&#x27;s bill, let alone three.

In 2009 Sue Bradford ran unsuccessfully against Metiria Turei to replace Jeanette Fitzsimons for the co-leadership of the Green Party. On 25 September 2009, Bradford announced her intention to resign as a Member of Parliament in late October, citing her disappointment at the loss and wish to take new directions. Bradford regretted not becoming a Cabinet Minister, especially a Minister of Housing and Social Development.

=== Child discipline bill ===
In 2005, a parliamentary ballot allowed the discussion of Bradford&#x27;s member&#x27;s bill, the Crimes (Abolition of Force as a Justification for Child Discipline) Amendment Bill 2005. The Bill proposed amending Section 59 of the Crimes Act 1961 to remove the legal defence of &quot;reasonable force&quot; for parents prosecuted for assault on their children. The Bill passed the select committee stage and its second parliamentary reading with a huge majority, and became law after it passed its third reading 113 to 8 on 16 May 2007.
The Bill occasioned widespread debate largely due its depiction as an &quot;anti-smacking&quot; bill, and a movement led by Family First New Zealand called a citizens initiated referendum on the issue.

In one reaction to the Bill, threats were made against Bradford on the &quot;CYFS Watch&quot; website. After the Ministry of Social Development complained about the threats, Google shut down the website. Further death threats were made against her in August 2009.

==After Parliament==
Soon after Bradford&#x27;s announcement of her resignation, Manukau mayor, Len Brown, suggested that she run to be a councillor on the Auckland Council. Bradford said that she would consider the idea but did not run.

She joined the Mana Party in 2011, and was a losing candidate for the Waitakere seat at the 2011 New Zealand general election.

In May 2014, Bradford resigned from the Mana Party in response to the formation of an alliance with the Internet Party.

Since October 2014 she has been coordinator at Auckland Action Against Poverty. In 2015, on completion of her PhD thesis, she spearheaded the formation of the left wing think tank &quot;Economic and Social Research Aotearoa (ESRA).&quot;

In 2017, journalist Jenny Chamberlain published a biography of Bradford: &quot;Constant Radical – The Life and Times of Sue Bradford&quot;.

Serra served as the first democratically elected Mayor of Barcelona after Franco&#x27;s dictatorship (from 1979 to 1982). 

In the wake of the socialist victory in the 1982 Spanish general election, Serra was appointed Minister of Defense by Prime Minister Felipe González, and he succeeded Alfonso Guerra as Deputy Prime Minister in 1991. During his tenure as Minister of Defense, he promoted the legislative changes that resulted in the democratization of the Spanish armed forces, their effective integration in NATO structure, and the participation in international missions for the first time. He resigned as Deputy Prime Minister in 1995, but remained a Member of the Spanish Congress of Deputies representing the Constituency of Barcelona until 2004. He first gained his seat in Parliament in the 1986 Spanish general election.

==Life after politics==
In 2005, Serra was appointed president of Caixa Catalunya, a public savings bank. Following his resignation in 2011, he was tried for criminal mismanagement and abusive payments while he was chairman of the ailed savings bank. He was absolved of all charges in February 2019.

Serra has been the chairman of the Institut Barcelona d&#x27;Estudis Internacionals (IBEI) since its foundation in 2004. He currently teaches courses on Strategy, Military Reform and Peace Building as part of the Master studies offered by the institute.

<text>The Jeonnam Dragons () are a South Korean professional football club based in the city of Gwangyang, South Jeolla Province that competes in the K League 2, the second tier of South Korean football. The Dragons play their home matches at the Gwangyang Football Stadium, one of the first football-specific stadiums in South Korea. They have won the Korean FA Cup four times (1997, 2006, 2007 and 2021) and were the runners-up of K League in 1997. They also reached the final of the 1998–99 Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where they lost to Al Ittihad.

==History==
The club was founded on 16 December 1994 as Chunnam Dragons, and appointed former South Korean international Jung Byung-tak as their first manager to oversee their first ever league match which took place on 25 March 1995. Chunnam started life slowly with mid-table finishes during its first few years, but recorded their best ever finish in 1997 when they finished as K League runners-up. In the same year, however, they won their first trophy after winning the 1997 Korean FA Cup, beating Chunan Ilhwa Chunma 1–0 in the final. In 1999, they finished as runners-up of the Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup after beating J-League giants Kashima Antlers 4–1 in the semi-finals, and losing 3–2 against Al Ittihad of Saudi Arabia in the final.

In 2006 and 2007, Jeonnam won two consecutive Korean FA Cup titles, defeating Suwon Samsung Bluewings and Pohang Steelers, respectively, in the finals.

On 27 December 2007, Jeonnam appointed Park Hang-seo as its new manager after former manager Huh Jung-moo was appointed to the South Korean national team.

<doc id="1056535" wikidata="Q2878261" url="?curid=1056535" title="Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo">
<text>Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo is the third album by the American singer-songwriter Aimee Mann, released on May 2, 2000. Some songs were previously released on the &quot;Magnolia&quot; soundtrack (1999), which Mann wrote in the same period. &quot;The Fall of the World&#x27;s Own Optimist&quot; was co-written with the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello.

Mann took more control over the production than on her previous albums. Many of the songs were inspired by her frustration with her record label, Geffen Records. Mann&#x27;s previous albums had not been successful, and Geffen refused to release &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot;, feeling it contained no hit singles. In response, Mann set up her own label, SuperEgo, and released it herself. &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; sold 270,000 copies, a large number for an independent artist.

According to Metacritic, &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; is the 28th best-reviewed album and the ninth best-reviewed indie or alternative album of the decade, and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named it the decade&#x27;s 100th-best album. The success established Mann as a career artist who could work outside of the major label system. 

== Background ==
Aimee Mann recorded her first two solo albums, &quot;Whatever&quot; (1993) and &quot;I&#x27;m With Stupid&quot; (1995), under contract to Imago Records. When Imago encountered financial problems, they sold the albums to Geffen Records. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Mann&#x27;s first two albums showed that she was &quot;a witty, self-possessed songwriter&quot;, but they did not meet sales expectations, with sales &quot;in the low six figures&quot;. Mann began to be seen as someone whose career was in decline. She received wider recognition after she contributed songs to the soundtrack for the 1999 film &quot;Magnolia&quot;, including some songs later included on &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot;.

== Writing ==
For &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot;, Mann collaborated again with the producer and multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion. She took more control over the production than she had for her previous albums, and said in 2020: &quot;This was the only record that I really took responsibility for all the music: all the parts that were played, the way everything sounded.&quot; The dodo of the album title reflected Mann&#x27;s sense that singer-songwriters were a &quot;dying breed&quot; in 2000.

Mann wrote &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; and the &quot;Magnolia&quot; soundtrack in the same period. Her frustration with Geffen inspired many of the songs. She described playing them to Geffen staff, who would complain that they did not sound like commercial singles. The criticism made her feel that she was failing, and she developed writer&#x27;s block. One executive suggested Mann work with Diane Warren, who had written hit singles for major acts. Mann wrote &quot;Nothing is Good Enough&quot; in response, but felt the song could also apply to many kinds of relationship.

&quot;The Fall of the World&#x27;s Own Optimist&quot; was co-written with the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello. According to Mann, &quot;I sent him a tape of a song that I couldn&#x27;t finish and he added a new bit. Basically I had a problem with a song and he fixed it — it was as simple as that.&quot; Mann and Costello had previously collaborated on &quot;The Other End Of the Telescope&quot;, released on the 1988 album &quot;Everything&#x27;s Different Now&quot; by Mann&#x27;s previous band, &#x27;Til Tuesday.

== Release ==
Geffen refused to release &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot;, feeling it had no commercial potential. In response, Mann sold homemade EPs of her music on tour, a move she described as a &quot;DIY fuck-you-record-company-I&#x27;m-selling-it-myself&quot; gesture. Geffen allowed Mann to leave her record contact. She said later: &quot;I could not have gotten out of there fast enough.&quot;

In 1998, the Sony Music employee Gail Marowitz predicted that Mann would make more money selling 70,000 albums independently than by selling 300,000 on a major label. In 1999, Mann and her manager, Michael Hausman, formed their own label, SuperEgo Records. With Mann&#x27;s husband, the songwriter Michael Penn, they also established United Musicians, a collective working outside the major label system. Using the money earned through royalties from &quot;Magnolia&quot;, Mann bought the &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; masters from Geffen.

Mann sold 25,000 copies of &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; via mail order from her website, a large amount for an independent artist. After she secured a distribution deal, &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; sold more than 270,000 copies, outperforming &quot;I&#x27;m With Stupid&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described this as a &quot;decisive victory&quot;. The success established Mann as a career artist who could work outside of the major label system. As of May 2008, &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; had sold more than 230,000 copies in the US. In 2020, Mann released a 20th-anniversary reissue for Record Store Day, with an alternative track list and five bonus tracks, including songs included on the &quot;Magnolia&quot; soundtrack. Mann said she remained pleased with the album and did not regret leaving Geffen.

== Reception ==
On the review aggregator website Metacritic, &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; has a score of 89 out of 100 based on 13 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. According to Metacritic, it is the 28th best-reviewed album and the ninth best-reviewed indie or alternative album of the decade. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named it the 100th-best album of the decade.

Writing for the &quot;New Yorker&quot; in 2000, Nick Hornby wrote that &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; was Mann&#x27;s strongest work to date, praising her &quot;bleak and bracing cynicism about our ability to connect with fellow humans&quot; and her &quot;sinuous, Burt Bacharach-like melodies&quot;.

<doc id="1056536" wikidata="Q796575" url="?curid=1056536" title="Ant colony">
<text>An ant colony is a population of ants, typically from a single species, capable of maintaining their complete lifecycle. Ant colonies are eusocial, communal, and efficiently organized and are very much like those found in other social Hymenoptera, though the various groups of these developed sociality independently through convergent evolution. The typical colony consists of one or more egg-laying queens, numerous sterile females (workers, soldiers) and, seasonally, many winged sexual males and females. In order to establish new colonies, ants undertake flights that occur at species-characteristic times of the day. Swarms of the winged sexuals (known as alates) depart the nest in search of other nests. The males die shortly thereafter, along with most of the females. A small percentage of the females survive to initiate new nests.

==Names==
The term &quot;ant colony&quot; refers to a population of workers, reproductive individuals, and brood that live together, cooperate, and treat one another non-aggressively. Often this comprises the genetically related progeny from a single queen, although this is not universal across ants. The name &quot;ant farm&quot; is commonly given to ant nests that are kept in formicaria, isolated from their natural habitat. These formicaria are formed so scientists can study by rearing or temporarily maintaining them. Another name is &quot;formicary&quot;, which derives from the Medieval Latin word &quot;formīcārium&quot;. The word also derives from &quot;formica&quot;. &quot;Ant nests&quot; are the physical spaces in which the ants live. These can be underground, in trees, under rocks, or even inside a single acorn. The name &quot;anthill&quot; (or &quot;ant hill&quot;) applies to aboveground nests where the workers pile sand or soil outside the entrance, forming a large mound.

== Colony size ==
Colony size (the number of individuals that make up the colony) is very important to ants: it can affect how they forage, how they defend their nests, how they mate, and even their physical appearances. Body size is often seen as the most important factor in shaping the natural history of non-colonial organisms; similarly, colony size is key in influencing how colonial organisms are collectively organized. Colonies have a significant range of sizes: some are just several ants living in a twig, while others are super-colonies with many millions of workers. Within a single ant colony, seasonal variation may be huge. For example, in the ant &quot;Dolichoderus mariae&quot;, one colony can shift from around 300 workers in the summer to over 2,000 workers per queen in the winter. Genetics and environmental factors can cause the variation among different colonies of a single species to be even bigger. Different ant species, even those in the same genus, may have enormous colony size disparities: &quot;Formica yessensis&quot; has colony sizes that are reported to be 306 million workers while &quot;Formica fusca&quot; colonies sometimes comprise only 500 workers.

== Supercolonies ==

A supercolony occurs when many ant colonies over a large area unite. They still continue to recognize genetic differences in order to mate, but the different colonies within the super colony avoid aggression. Until 2000, the largest known ant supercolony was on the Ishikari coast of Hokkaidō, Japan. The colony was estimated to contain 306 million worker ants and one million queen ants living in 45,000 nests interconnected by underground passages over an area of . In 2000, an enormous supercolony of Argentine ants was found in Southern Europe (report published in 2002). Of 33 ant populations tested along the stretch along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts in Southern Europe, 30 belonged to one supercolony with estimated millions of nests and billions of workers, interspersed with three populations of another supercolony. The researchers claim that this case of unicoloniality cannot be explained by loss of their genetic diversity due to the genetic bottleneck of the imported ants. In 2009, it was demonstrated that the largest Japanese, Californian and European Argentine ant supercolonies were in fact part of a single global &quot;megacolony&quot;. This intercontinental megacolony represents the most populous recorded animal society on earth, other than humans.

Another supercolony, measuring approximately wide, was found beneath Melbourne, Australia in 2004.

== Organizational terminology ==
The following terminology is commonly used among myrmecologists to describe the behaviors demonstrated by ants when founding and organizing colonies:

;Monogyny: Establishment of an ant colony under a single egg-laying queen.
;Polygyny: Establishment of an ant colony under multiple egg-laying queens.
;Oligogyny: Establishment of a polygynous colony where the multiple egg-laying queens remain far apart from one another in the nest.
;Haplometrosis: Establishment of a colony by a single queen.
;Pleometrosis: Establishment of a colony by multiple queens.
;Monodomy: Establishment of a colony at a single nest site.
;Polydomy: Establishment of a colony across multiple nest sites.

==Colony structure==
Ant colonies have a complex social structure. Ants’ jobs are determined and can be changed by age. As ants grow older their jobs move them farther from the queen, or center of the colony. Younger ants work within the nest protecting the queen and young. Sometimes, a queen is not present and is replaced by egg-laying workers. These worker ants can only lay haploid eggs producing sterile offspring. Despite the title of queen, she does not delegate the tasks to the worker ants; however, the ants choose their tasks based on individual preference.
Ants as a colony also work as a collective &quot;super mind&quot;. Ants can compare areas and solve complex problems by using information gained by each member of the colony to find the best nesting site or to find food. Some social-parasitic species of ants, known as the slave-making ant, raid and steal larvae from neighboring colonies.

== Excavation ==

Ant hill art is a growing collecting hobby. It involves pouring molten metal (typically non-toxic zinc or aluminum), plaster or cement down an ant colony mound acting as a mold and upon hardening, one excavates the resulting structure. In some cases, this involves a great deal of digging.

The casts are often used for research and education purposes, but many are simply given or sold to natural history museums, or sold as folk art or as souvenirs. Walter R. Tschinkel notes in &quot;Ant Architecture: The Wonder, Beauty, and Science of Underground Nests&quot; that many commercial operations seem to use a casting procedure he developed and published based on the work of Brazilian myrmecologists Meinhard Jacoby and Luiz Forti. Usually, the hills are chosen after the ants have abandoned so as to not kill any ants; however in the Southeast United States, pouring into an active colony of invasive fire ants is a novel way to eliminate them.

== Ant-beds ==
An &quot;ant-bed&quot;, in its simplest form, is a pile of soil, sand, pine needles, manure, urine, or clay or a composite of these and other materials that build up at the entrances of the subterranean dwellings of ant colonies as they are excavated. A colony is built and maintained by legions of worker ants, who carry tiny bits of dirt and pebbles in their mandibles and deposit them near the exit of the colony. They normally deposit the dirt or vegetation at the top of the hill to prevent it from sliding back into the colony, but in some species, they actively sculpt the materials into specific shapes and may create nest chambers within the mound.

<doc id="1056544" wikidata="Q483152" url="?curid=1056544" title="Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors">
<text>Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors FC () is a South Korean professional football club based in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province that competes in the K League 1, the top tier of South Korean football. Jeonbuk have won the K League a record nine times, including five consecutive titles between 2017 and 2021, and the Korean FA Cup five times. Internationally, the club have won the AFC Champions League twice, first in 2006, becoming the first club from East Asia to win the tournament since it was rebranded in 2003. Jeonbuk have also made two appearances in the FIFA Club World Cup, most recently in the 2016 edition. The club&#x27;s home ground is the Jeonju World Cup Stadium.

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors&#x27; predecessor was founded in January 1993 under the name Wansan Pumas. Oh Hyung-keun was the founder of the team, the first to be named after its home location in K League history. However, they failed to raise enough funds and the club went bankrupt before they could take their place in the K League. Many people wanted to keep the club and Bobae Ltd., a local alcohol producer, offered financial support to the club. In 1994, they joined the K League after renaming as Chonbuk Buffalo, but ran into financial problems and were dissolved after the final match of the 1994 season.

In 1994, South Korea was in the campaign to host the 2002 FIFA World Cup, so Hyundai Motors, who was in the process of building Hyundai Jeonju Plant, took over the Buffaloes&#x27; players and formed a new club called Chonbuk Dinos on 12 December 1994. The K League&#x27;s official policy is that Chonbuk Buffalo and Chonbuk Dinos (later renaming as Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors) are two different clubs.

=== Domination in K League and success in Asia (2005–2021) ===
Since 1994, Jeonbuk had not seriously challenged for the K League title, often languishing in mid-table. After Choi Kang-hee was appointed manager in July 2005, Jeonbuk won the Korean FA Cup in December of that year. In 2006, Jeonbuk finished a disappointing eleventh in the K League, however, they won their first AFC Champions League title. En route to the final, they defeated the Japanese champions, Gamba Osaka, and China&#x27;s Shanghai Shenhua, as well as Ulsan Horang-i, the South Korean champions, in the semi-finals. They then triumphed 3–2 on aggregate over Al-Karamah, the champions of Syria, in the final.

As AFC Champions League winners, Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors qualified for the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup. They lost their first game 1–0 to América in the quarter-finals on 10 December, however, they defeated Auckland City 3–0 on 14 December and finished fifth in the tournament. In 2009, Jeonbuk became the Korean champions for the first time after beating Seongnam Ilhwa 3–1 on aggregate in the K League Championship. They repeated the feat in 2011 and won their second domestic title after defeating Ulsan Hyundai 4–2 in the final. The same year, they also reached the AFC Champions League final, where they lost to Al-Sadd after a penalty shoot-out.
With significant investment from its parent company, Jeonbuk completed its state of the art Yulsori Clubhouse (club training center) in nearby Wanju County in 2013. Hyundai&#x27;s generous support and Choi Kang-hee&#x27;s aggressive play style led to the club dominating the K League for the next several years, with the club winning the 2014 and 2015 titles.

2016 was a tumultuous year for Jeonbuk. The club won their second AFC Champions League title after defeating Al-Ain 3–2 on aggregate, but the team came under fire in the domestic front for allegedly bribing referees through a scout. The club was fined and had nine points deducted from their 2016 league campaign, resulting in rivals FC Seoul claiming the title. Despite being champions of Asia, the club&#x27;s participation in the 2017 AFC Champions League was revoked due to this incident.

The club continued to enjoy success in the K League, securing the next five consecutive titles. Additionally, they won the 2020 Korean FA Cup, defeating rising rivals Ulsan over two legs to mark their first-ever domestic double.

=== Decline (2022–present) ===
The 2022 season marked the beginning of Jeonbuk&#x27;s decline, dramatically losing the title to now chief rivals Ulsan by three points. The club, however, won the 2022 Korean FA Cup. The following year led to even poorer results, with the club finishing fourth in the 2023 season, their lowest league finish since 2008. Jeonbuk also failed to win a second consecutive FA Cup, being defeated by Pohang Steelers in the 2023 final. The fourth-place finish and failure to win the FA Cup meant the club was unable to participate in the rebranded 2024–25 AFC Champions League Elite.

Jeonbuk&#x27;s decline escalated in the 2024 season, with the club finishing tenth and flirting with relegation for the first time in its history. The club narrowly avoided relegation to K League 2 by defeating Seoul E-Land in the promotion-relegation play-offs.

In December 2024, Jeonbuk appointed Uruguayan manager Gus Poyet in a bid to achieve its former glory. In the club&#x27;s first competitive match under Poyet, they defeated Thai side Port FC 4–0 away in the 2024–25 AFC Champions League Two, including two goals by new signing Andrea Compagno.

== Supporters and rivalries ==

=== Supporters ===

Jeonbuk is the most popular football club and the second most popular sports team in South Korea, with an estimated over two million supporters, larger than the entire population of the North Jeolla Province it represents. The club draws supporters from all over the country and particularly from the Honam region. It has almost half a million followers on TikTok, boosted by the international popularity of former player Cho Gue-sung, who scored a brace in South Korea&#x27;s group stage match versus Ghana in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

The club&#x27;s main supporters group is called the Mad Green Boys, and the club&#x27;s fans have been involved in several notable incidents. In a victorious 2011 AFC Champions League match versus J.League side Cerezo Osaka, a supporter came under fire for holding up a sign &#x27;congratulating&#x27; Japan on the 2011 earthquake in the east of the country. The supporter later apologized online for his actions.

=== Rivalries ===

==== Seoul Metropolitan Area clubs ====
Jeonbuk shares strong rivalries with FC Seoul (Jeonseol Match) and Suwon Samsung Bluewings (Gongseongjeon). The three-way rivalry these clubs share represent the business rivalry between their parent companies Hyundai, LG, and Samsung - three of the largest business conglomerates in South Korea. Their rivalry was the most intense in the 2010s, when Jeonbuk came to dominate the K League while Seoul and Suwon declined.

==== Hyundai Derby ====
Since the late 2010s, Jeonbuk&#x27;s biggest league rival came to be Ulsan HD. Ulsan became the main club to challenge Jeonbuk&#x27;s domestic dominance, finally breaking the club&#x27;s five-year title winning streak in 2022. The matches between the two giants, now seen as the biggest derby in the country, continue to be very consequential for both clubs.

Although the parent companies of the two clubs share the Hyundai name, they are legally separate business entities.

==== International ====
In the 2010s, Jeonbuk developed an intense international rivalry with Chinese side Guangzhou Evergrande from frequently playing each other in the AFC Champions League. The two teams were the dominant sides of their respective leagues and their most frequent representatives on the continental stage. Several South Korean players and staff members were instrumental to Guangzhou&#x27;s victories over Jeonbuk and in Asia, as the club and other Chinese Super League teams used their large financial backing to attract South Korean talent.

== Stadium ==

Jeonbuk has played its home games at the Jeonju World Cup Stadium since 2002, after the stadium was completed the year before. It has a capacity of 34,276 seats. Their previous home ground was the Jeonju Sports Complex Stadium.

Jeonbuk owns one of the most modern club training facilities in Asia, the Yulsori Clubhouse located in Bongdong-eup, Wanju County, modeled after the training facilities of top European clubs. The state-of-the-art training center includes a large hydrotherapy room, indoor and outdoor training grounds, personal sleeping rooms, a gym, and a cafeteria.

<text>Adna Romanza Chaffee (April 14, 1842 – November 1, 1914) was a lieutenant general in the United States Army. Chaffee took part in the American Civil War and Indian Wars, played a key role in the Spanish–American War, and fought in the Boxer Rebellion in China. He was the Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1904 to 1906, overseeing far-reaching transformation of organization and doctrine in the army.

==Early life and Civil War==
Chaffee was born in Orwell, Ohio. When the American Civil War broke out in July 1861, Chaffee joined the U.S. 6th Cavalry Regiment. In 1862, Chaffee was promoted to sergeant and took part in the Peninsular Campaign and the Battle of Antietam. In September of that year he was made the first sergeant of Company K. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in May 1863. His 6th Cavalry, on detached service from General John Buford&#x27;s 1st Union Cavalry Division, though outnumbered, attacked a Confederate Cavalry regiment at Fairfield, Pennsylvania, just outside Gettysburg on July 3, 1863 (source, Wittenberg, Eric: Gettysburg: Forgotten Cavalry Actions). In the ensuing action, he was wounded and briefly held a prisoner of the Confederates. He served with the 6th Cavalry for the remainder of the war, being twice wounded. In February 1865, he was promoted to first lieutenant. For his &quot;gallant and meritorious&quot; actions in the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House he was brevetted captain.

After the war, Chaffee became a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Indian Wars==
Chaffee decided to remain with the army after the war. He was posted to the western frontier, and was promoted to captain of Regulars in October 1867. For the next thirty years he served in the Indian Wars, fighting the Central Plains and Southwestern tribes. In 1868, he was brevetted major for his actions at Paint Creek, Texas. In the following years, he engaged the Native Americans many times, most notably at Red River, Texas, in 1874, and Big Dry Wash, Arizona Territory, in 1882, for which he was brevetted lieutenant colonel.

In July 1888, he was promoted to major and transferred to the 9th Cavalry. From 1894 to 1896, he was an instructor of tactics at the Army&#x27;s Infantry and Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth. In June 1897 he was promoted to colonel and transferred to the 3rd Cavalry, where he served as commandant of the Cavalry School at Fort Riley until 1898.

==Spanish–American War==
With the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Chaffee was assigned a brigade and was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers in May of that year, and in July after the victory at El Caney, to major general of volunteers. From late 1898 to May 1900, he served as the chief of staff to the military governor of Cuba, General Leonard Wood, being promoted to colonel of regulars in May 1899. He was a member of Society of the Army of Santiago, a military society for officers who had served in Cuba.

==Boxer Rebellion==
In June 1900, the Boxer Rebellion broke out in China. Colonel Chaffee was sent to China in July as the commander of the U.S. Army&#x27;s China Relief Expedition. The Expedition was a part of the international force sent to rescue Western and Japanese citizens and put down the rebellion. Chaffee arrived at Taku Bay, China aboard USAT &quot;Grant&quot; to take command on 29 July 1900. Chaffee participated in the Gaselee Expedition and subsequently the Battle of Peking, in which the legations were relieved. In 1900–1901 American forces were included in the Allied occupation of Peking (Beijing). As American commander Chaffee began public health, relief, and police operations in cooperation with Chinese officials. 

According to Chaffee, &quot;[I]t is safe to say that where one real Boxer has been killed, fifty harmless coolies or laborers, including not a few women and children, have been slain.&quot;

Chaffee concluded that Chinese respected only the superior power. Reassigned to the Philippines he applied the lessons there, combining benevolence and public health measures with force and cooperation with local officials.

Chaffee was one of the founders of the Military Order of the Dragon, a military society for officers who had served in China during the Boxer Rebellion. He served as the society&#x27;s president from its founding in 1900 until his death.

==Philippines and retirement==
In February 1901, Chaffee was promoted to major general in the Regular Army. From July of that year until October 1902, he served as commander of American forces in the Philippines, following the dissolution of the American military government under General Arthur MacArthur Jr. and the institution of civilian rule under governor-general William Howard Taft. Chaffee commanded U.S. troops during the final months of the primary phase of the Philippine–American War. In December 1901, he assigned General Jacob H. Smith to deal with anti-American resistance in the province of Samar, resulting in an ill-fated campaign that led to the deaths of up to 2,000 Filipino civilians. Chaffee became a member of the Military Order of the Carabao for Philippine veterans, and also served as Paramount Carabao for a time.

In October 1902, Chaffee became commander of the Department of the East, a position he held until October 1903. In January 1904, he was promoted to lieutenant general and, from January 9, 1904, until January 14, 1906, served as the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. At his own request, Chaffee was retired on February 1, 1906.

General Chaffee was invested with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor by the president of France.

In his retirement, he moved to Los Angeles, where he was appointed president of the Board of Public Works for the city of Los Angeles.

==Family==

Chaffee was married twice; in September 1867 he married Kate Haynie Reynolds, a young widow who died two and a half years later.

In 1875, he married Annie Frances Rockwell. Their son Adna R. Chaffee Jr. also became a general and was one of the fathers of the U.S. Army&#x27;s armored forces, having a light tank, the M24 Chaffee, named in his honor.

After his death, Chaffee was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on November 9, 1914, after a funeral service at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church. After her death six and a half years later, his second wife Annie was interred beside him.

<text>Sir David Cunningham Carter (born 3 April 1952) is a New Zealand National Party politician who served as the 29th Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives from 2013 to 2017 and as a Cabinet Minister in the Fourth and Fifth National Governments. He represented the Selwyn electorate in the 44th Parliament and the Banks Peninsula electorate in the 45th Parliament. He served as a list MP from 1999 until he retired at the 2020 election.

==Early life==
Carter was born in Christchurch in 1952, the son of Merle and Maurice Carter. He attended St Bede&#x27;s College, and has a Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree from Lincoln University. He has farmed sheep and cattle for over 30 years, and established the first commercial cattle-embryo transplant company in New Zealand in 1974.

==Member of Parliament==



Carter stood in the electorate in the as a successor to Gail McIntosh, but was defeated by Labour&#x27;s Ruth Dyson. Carter was first elected to Parliament in the 1994 by-election in Selwyn, replacing the resigning Ruth Richardson. In the 1996 general election he won the Banks Peninsula electorate against Dyson. In the 1999 election he was defeated by Dyson, but entered Parliament as a list MP. In the 2002 election, he failed to recapture the seat and remained a list MP.

From 1998 until the National Party&#x27;s defeat in 1999 Carter was Minister for Senior Citizens, Associate Minister of Revenue, and Associate Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control. At the very end of National&#x27;s term in office, he was also Associate Minister of Education.

In 2008, Carter was initially chosen as the National candidate for the resurrected safe National seat of Selwyn, but opposition to this saw the National candidacy up for grabs again. He pulled out and the candidacy was eventually won by Amy Adams, who won the seat. Carter was given a high list placing of nine instead and did not contest an electorate. After National&#x27;s election victory, he took the portfolios of Agriculture, Biosecurity and Forestry.

===Minister of Agriculture===
In May 2010, Carter issued a ban on kosher slaughter, rejecting the recommendations of his advisers. Carter held shares in a firm that exports meat, and prior to instituting the ban he met senior managers of the firm who wanted a ban on kosher slaughter to reduce their competition.

===Minister of Primary Industries===
After the 2011 election, Carter was appointed Minister of the new Ministry of Primary Industries. In November 2012 he approved the increased squid fishery SQU6T by 140%, despite recommendations from scientists and the Department of Conservation that this would be detrimental to the endangered New Zealand sealion.

===Speaker of the House===
On 22 January 2013, the Prime Minister John Key announced that Carter was his preference to replace Lockwood Smith as Speaker of the House. Carter&#x27;s appointment was not without controversy, and the Labour Party questioned whether he actually wanted the job.

As the opposition was not consulted as per convention, Trevor Mallard was nominated by Labour and the position was put to a vote on 31 January 2013. Carter won by 62 votes to 52. Consistent with the tradition of newly elected speakers, Carter had to be &quot;dragged to the chair&quot; following the election.

The office of speaker entitles Carter to the title The Right Honourable following a reform of the New Zealand royal honours system in 2010.

Carter cited his intention to continue as Speaker, &quot;if that is the will of Parliament&quot;, as the basis for his decision to stand as a list-only candidate in the 2014 general election.

On 10 November 2015, Carter controversially failed to acknowledge offence caused to significant numbers of Labour and Green MPs after John Key had accused them of &quot;backing rapists&quot; during a debate about the Christmas Island Detention Centre. The following day, Carter silenced seven female MPs who stated that they were victims of sexual abuse and stood up to express personal offence to Key&#x27;s statement, which they called on Key to apologise for. Carter ruled that the manner in which they stood to address the house was contrary to the House&#x27;s standing orders and dismissed several of the seven; the remainder walked out.

On 11 May 2016, Carter dismissed the Prime Minister, John Key, from the debating chamber. Key had ignored several of the Speaker&#x27;s warnings about behaviour contrary to the standing orders. Carter stated, &quot;He is to be treated no differently to any other in this house&quot;.

===In opposition, 2017–2020===
Carter was returned as an MP through the National Party list in the 2017 election. Following the election, a Labour-led coalition government was formed with the support of the New Zealand First and Green parties. Carter was succeeded as Speaker by Labour MP Trevor Mallard, who assumed the position on 7 November 2017.

In mid-October 2018, Carter confirmed that he along with fellow National MP Chris Finlayson would retire before the next general election. Carter denied that his resignation came as a result of a secret tape by National Party leader Simon Bridges suggesting that Finlayson should resign in order to clear the way for newer National MPs.

In late July 2020, Carter submitted a private member&#x27;s bill seeking to repeal the Labour-led government&#x27;s Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Act 2018. The bill passed its first reading and was referred to the justice select committee. Following the bill&#x27;s first reading, Carter indicated that he would retire at the 2020 New Zealand general election. Carter&#x27;s private member bill was assigned to fellow National MP Nick Smith.

==Post-parliament==

In the 2021 New Year Honours, Carter was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a Member of Parliament and Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Following his retirement from parliament, Carter was elected to the National Party&#x27;s Board of Directors on 21 November 2020. He challenged Peter Goodfellow for the role of President but was unsuccessful. On 8 August 2021 he resigned from the board after another unsuccessful challenge to Goodfellow. He stated that he has &quot;zero confidence&quot; in Goodfellow, criticising the alleged &quot;dysfunctional governance&quot; of the party and lack of money to run a suitable campaign.

In August 2024, Carter became chair of the Canterbury A&amp;P Association board.

<doc id="1056563" wikidata="Q104099625" url="?curid=1056563" title="Gimcheon Sangmu FC">
<text>Gimcheon Sangmu Football Club () is a South Korean professional football club based in Gimcheon that competes in the K League 1, the top tier of South Korean football. Sangmu is the sports division of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces.

Sangmu&#x27;s playing staff is made up of young South Korean professional footballers serving their compulsory two-year military duty. Fifteen players join up at the start of every season and spend two years with the side before returning to their previous professional club. Sangmu are not allowed to sign any foreign players because of their military status.

This article also includes the predecessor military-based teams – Sangmu FC, Gwangju Sangmu FC and Sangju Sangmu FC – which are still separate legal entities.

==History==
===Various military clubs (1950s–1983)===
Before the Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps and its football club Sangmu FC were founded in 1984, the Republic of Korea Armed Forces had three football clubs: ROK Army FC, ROK Marine Corps FC, and ROK Air Force FC.

The ROK Army originally established football clubs of each corps, including CIC FC (Counter Intelligence Corps; also known as Seoul FC or Seoul Club), HID FC (Headquarters of Intelligence Detachment), Quartermaster Corps FC (consisted of only quartermasters), OPMG FC (Office of the Provost Marshal General; former Military Police Command FC), Engineer Corps FC, and Infantry School FC. Most of them (excluding Quartermaster Corps FC) were merged into the Engineer Corps FC in 1965. Lastly, these two clubs were united, and Army FC was established in 1969.

Afterwards, the Marine Corps FC renamed as ROK Navy FC due to the dissolution of the Headquarters Marine Corps in 1973.

===Founding and semi-professional Sangmu FC era (1984–2002)===
Sangmu FC was founded on 11 January 1984, as the football side of Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps.
Although Sangmu squad was composed of professional players from K League clubs, Sangmu FC competed in the semi-professional league (now Korea National League). Sangmu joined the K League for the 1985 season, but spent only one year in the league before dropping out.

The reserve side, Sangmu B, competed in the K2 League from 2003 to 2005 before joining the K League reserve league. Sangmu B was based in Icheon and finished as the runners-up in the 2003 K2 League season.

===Gwangju Sangmu era (2002–2010)===
After establishing a home base in Gwangju in April 2002, the team participated in the Reserve League. The club has rejoined the K League at the start of the 2003 season as Gwangju Sangmu Bulsajo FC. Between 2004 and 2010, the club has been known as Gwangju Sangmu FC.

===Sangju Sangmu era (2011–2020)===
Once Gwangju FC was established, Gwangju Sangmu FC was relocated to Sangju, North Gyeongsang Province, as Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps moved to Mungyeong, near Sangju. The club name was officially changed to Sangju Sangmu Phoenix FC in January 2011.

Before the 2013 season, the club officially removed the word &quot;Phoenix&quot; in its name. In the same season, Sangju Sangmu became the first champions of the newly established K League Challenge (second division) and promoted to the K League Classic.

Sangju started the 2020 season already knowing they would be relegated to K League 2. The military club decided to move out of Sangju to a new, as yet undisclosed location. Sangju has decided not to establish a football team which would be citizen-owned outfit and also played in K League 2.

===Gimcheon Sangmu (2021–present)===
On 30 June 2020, the K League administration announced that the city of Gimcheon had officially submitted an application to host the team for at least the 2021 season, offering their local stadium as the football club&#x27;s new home. After a preliminary review and several meetings and assemblies involving local governors, the K League eventually approved the proposal and began the process of moving the club to Gimcheon.

<text>codice_1 is a statically linked executable file that contains the Linux kernel in one of the object file formats supported by Linux, which includes Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) and Common Object File Format (COFF). The codice_1 file might be required for kernel debugging, symbol table generation or other operations, but must be made bootable before being used as an operating system kernel by adding a multiboot header, bootsector and setup routines.

==Etymology==
Traditionally, UNIX platforms called the kernel image codice_3. With the development of virtual memory, kernels that supported this feature were given the codice_4- prefix to differentiate them. The name codice_1 is a mutation of vmunix, while in codice_6 the letter codice_7 at the end denotes that it is compressed (for example gzipped).

==Location==
Traditionally, the kernel was located in the root directory of the filesystem hierarchy; however, as the bootloader must use BIOS drivers to access the hard disk, limitations on some i386 systems meant only the first 1024 cylinders of the hard disk were addressable.

To overcome this, Linux distributors encouraged users to create a partition at the beginning of their drives specifically for storing bootloader and kernel-related files. GRUB, LILO and SYSLINUX are common bootloaders.

By convention, this partition is mounted on the filesystem hierarchy as codice_8. This was later standardised by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which now requires the Linux kernel image to be located in either codice_9 or codice_8, although there is no technical restriction enforcing this.

==Compression==
Traditionally, when creating a bootable kernel image, the kernel is also compressed using gzip, or, since Linux 2.6.30, using LZMA or bzip2, which requires a very small decompression stub to be included in the resulting image. The stub decompresses the kernel code, on some systems printing dots to the console to indicate progress, and then continues the boot process. Support for LZO, xz, LZ4 and zstd compression was added later.

The decompression routine is a negligible factor in boot time, and prior to the development of the &quot;bzImage&quot;, the size constraints of some architectures, notably i386, were extremely limiting, making compression a necessity.

On the SPARC architecture, the vmlinux file is compressed using simple gzip, because the SILO boot loader transparently decompresses gzipped images.
The filename of the bootable image is not important, but many popular distributions use &quot;vmlinuz&quot;.

==bzImage==
As the Linux kernel matured, the size of the kernels generated by users grew beyond the limits imposed by some architectures, where the space available to store the compressed kernel code is limited. The bzImage (&quot;big zImage&quot;) format was developed to overcome this limitation by splitting the kernel over non-contiguous memory regions.

The bzImage was compressed using gzip until Linux 2.6.30, which introduced more algorithms. Although the codice_11 prefix may suggest that bzip2 compression is used, this is not the case. (The bzip2 package is often distributed with tools prefixed with codice_11, such as codice_13, codice_14, etc.)

The bzImage file is in a specific format. It contains concatenated codice_15 + codice_16 + codice_17 + codice_18. codice_18 contains the gzipped vmlinux file in its data section. The script codice_20 found under codice_21 in the kernel sources decompresses a kernel image. Some distributions (e.g. Red Hat and clones) may come with a codice_22 RPM that contains the codice_1 file for the matching kernel RPM, and it typically gets installed under codice_24 or codice_25.

Further notable television parts include the title roles in &quot;The Chief&quot; (1993–1995), &quot;Judge John Deed&quot; (2001–2007) and &quot;Inspector George Gently&quot; (2007–2017). He has also acted on stage and in film, and has narrated numerous audiobooks and presented various television series.

==Early life==
Shaw was born in Birmingham. His childhood was spent in Alleyne Grove in Erdington and Sutton Coldfield. Shaw attended Great Barr School, where he excelled in English literature and drama lessons. At sixteen, he was offered a scholarship to a Birmingham drama school but declined. 

In his youth, Shaw was involved in a drunken brawl with a friend, suffering broken teeth, injuries to his face and a fractured skull, and needed cheekbone surgery. 

At age eighteen, Shaw moved to London to study acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). He served his apprenticeship in repertory as an assistant stage manager at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Hornchurch and the Bristol Old Vic.

==Stage==
Shaw took key roles in the first revival of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (Royal Court/Criterion, 1968); in the National Theatre&#x27;s &quot;Saturday, Sunday, Monday&quot; opposite Laurence Olivier (1973); and in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; presented by the Piccadilly Theatre in 1974. He later acknowledged the role of Stanley Kowalski in &#x27;Streetcar&#x27; as a point of breakthrough in his career.

In 1985, Shaw played Elvis Presley in Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight?&quot;. It told the story of Presley&#x27;s last few hours. After a long run in London, the production visited Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide in Australia. 

Shaw&#x27;s portrayal of Lord Goring in &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; on Broadway earned him a Tony Award nomination and a Drama Desk award. 

After filming finished on the TV series &quot;Judge John Deed&quot;, Shaw took the role of Thomas More in Robert Bolt&#x27;s play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;. Shaw&#x27;s daughter, Sophie, played opposite him as More&#x27;s daughter, Margaret. The production toured Britain&#x27;s cities before a run in London at the Theatre Royal Haymarket.

In 2013, in a new production of the classic play &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; at the Garrick Theatre London, Shaw played the part of the dissenting juror (identified as juror number 8).

In 2016 Shaw toured and returned to the West End again with a production of &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; at the Vaudeville. After completing filming the final episode of George Gently, Shaw again toured in 2017 with the U.K. premiere of Gore Vidal&#x27;s 1960 political piece, &quot;The Best Man&quot;. Shaw played the part of William Russell, former US Secretary of State.

==Television==
Shaw began television work in 1967. Parts in one-off plays for Granada Television led to his playing hippy student Robert Croft, Lucile Hewitt&#x27;s boyfriend, in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Another early role was booze and football-loving Welsh medical student Huw Evans in the television comedy series &quot;Doctor in the House&quot;. He later guest-starred, playing the same role, in the follow-up series &quot;Doctor at Large&quot;, now a nervous expectant father in the episode &quot;Mother and Father Doing Well&quot;. The actor had been introduced to international audiences via his portrayal of Horatio in the 1970 &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; presentation of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, starring Richard Chamberlain.

Shaw appeared with future co-star Lewis Collins in an episode of &quot;The New Avengers&quot;. Both played the roles of terrorists. Shaw portrayed Ray Doyle (&quot;Agent 4–5&quot;) in the British television series &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1977–1983), opposite Collins. Shaw played another law-enforcement role in the 1990s ITV production &quot;The Chief&quot;.

In 1983, Shaw played Robert Falcon Scott in &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;. The series was filmed at Frobisher Bay near the city of Iqaluit on Baffin Island, Canada. In interview at the time, Shaw commented that he generally responded well to the testing physical conditions, particularly when they enhanced the reality of the scene. In the same year he played Sir Henry Baskerville in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, an adaptation of the novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He acted opposite Ian Richardson&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes and Donald Churchill&#x27;s Dr. Watson.

He played Cecil Rhodes in &quot;Rhodes&quot;, an eight-part serial that aired in 1996 and was filmed on location in South Africa. Shaw&#x27;s younger son, Joe, took early leave of his drama school course to play the part of the youthful Rhodes. 

Another television acting credit includes the role of Dr Robert Kingston in &quot;Always and Everyone&quot; (1999–2002), a British accident and emergency medical series, played alongside Niamh Cusack. 

In 2001, he took the title role in the BBC drama &quot;Judge John Deed&quot;. The character gave an editorial voice to the television writer and producer G.F. Newman&#x27;s ideas about lifestyle choices such as vegetarianism and alternative medicine as well as issues of social justice. One episode about the safety of the MMR vaccine was banned.

Between seasons of &quot;Judge John Deed&quot;, Shaw took the role of poetic bespectacled forensic detective Adam Dalgliesh in P.D. James&#x27;s &quot;Death in Holy Orders&quot; in 2003 and &quot;The Murder Room&quot; in 2005. After the sixth season of &quot;Judge John Deed&quot; had been filmed, Shaw appeared in the series &quot;Apparitions&quot;, broadcast by the BBC in 2008. This was Shaw&#x27;s first project as executive director.

From 2007 until 2017 he played the title role in the BBC TV series &quot;Inspector George Gently&quot;. 
On 9 May 2015 Shaw recited &quot;For the Fallen&quot; at VE Day 70: A Party to Remember in Horse Guards Parade, London which was broadcast on BBC 1.

In 2021 he played the role of Dennis Stephenson, leader of a fictitious religious cult called the Barum Brethren, in the BritBox original series &quot;The Long Call&quot;. The series premiered in autumn 2021, and is based on the Ann Cleeves bestselling novel.

==Film==
Shaw&#x27;s first film role was as an Irish communist in a 1967 television adaptation of the novel, &quot;Love on the Dole&quot;. Better known is his 1971 role of Banquo in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;. He has also been seen as an undercover Second World War operative in the 1975 production &quot;Operation Daybreak&quot;; a singing and dancing futuristic magician &quot;Zax&quot; in &quot;Facelift&quot;; the role of Rachid in the 1973 film &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, and a wanted villain leading a life on the run in a circus troupe in &quot;Ladder of Swords&quot; (1989).

==Narration and documentaries==
Shaw has narrated many audiobooks, including Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;; Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;; and Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. In 2006, Shaw narrated and appeared in a DVD chronicling the &quot;Merlins over Malta&quot; project. This featured the return of a Second World War Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane from Britain to Malta for the first time in fifty years.

In December 2006, Shaw presented the six-part Discovery Channel Real Time TV series &quot;Martin Shaw: Aviators&quot;, produced by Twofour, which followed the two-year restoration of his Boeing Stearman biplane after it was crashed by another pilot at Old Buckenham airfield in Norfolk. Shaw fulfilled a lifetime ambition to take the controls of a Spitfire and, though take-off was not permitted, he also powered an English Electric Lightning to 150 mph in three seconds along the runway at Cranfield Airport. Shaw also compared notes with the builder and developer of the modern autogyro, Wing Cdr Ken Wallis.

In 2010 he presented a documentary for the BBC titled &quot;Dambusters Declassified&quot; in which he investigated and debunked some of the myths of the dambusters raid known as Operation Chastise story which had been portrayed in the books &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot; and &quot;The Dambusters&quot;, and the film &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;.

==Advertisements==
Among several voiceovers and appearances, in 1974, Shaw starred in a three-minute advertisement for the Mk II Ford Capri and in 1987, a TV advert for the Vauxhall Cavalier.

==Activism and charity work==
Shaw is a celebrity activist for animal rights and animal welfare. He is the patron of the Hillside Animal Sanctuary in Frettenham in Norfolk, a charity organisation which provides a safe home for neglected and abused animals. He also supports Viva! and Dr Hadwen Trust.

In March 2012, he also announced that he would become the official patron to the community organisation Stop Norwich UrBanisation or SNUB, whose aim is to protect Norfolk&#x27;s countryside from overdevelopment and excessive urbanisation. In the press release, he stated that he was &quot;simply furious and upset by your plight and that of all of us who wish to live in quiet and peace. I will be your Patron and keep fighting&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1971, Shaw became a follower of Charan Singh, of the Sant Mat religion. 

Shaw lives in Wreningham in Norfolk.

On 18 August 2010, Shaw collapsed during the first act of the matinee showing of &quot;A Country Girl&quot; at Shrewsbury&#x27;s Theatre Severn. His agent, Roger Charteris, said he had been suffering from cracked ribs and was taking antibiotics for a severe chest infection. An understudy went on in his place.

Shaw has been a vegetarian since about 1974. He has a prominent scar on his right cheek, the result of a physical attack during a mugging, after which he became a teetotaller.

<doc id="1056576" wikidata="Q11035229" url="?curid=1056576" title="John Carter (New Zealand politician)">
<text>John McGregor Carter (born 8 May 1950) is a New Zealand politician, and member of the National Party. He represented the Bay of Islands, Far North and Northland electorates in Parliament from 1987 until July 2011, when he became New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to the Cook Islands. Since the October 2013 local elections, he served as mayor of the Far North District for 9 years until his retirement from politics in 2022.

==Early life==

He was born in Te Kōpuru, Northland and educated at Otamatea High School. Before entering politics, Carter worked as a local government administration official. He was the county clerk and principal officer at Hokianga County Council until his election to Parliament in 1987. Carter is married, and has one daughter and two sons.

==Political career==

=== Member of Parliament ===



Carter was elected to Parliament in the 1987 election, winning the Bay of Islands electorate. He continued to represent the area when the seat changed names to Far North in 1993 and later Northland. The National Party came to power in the 1990 election and Carter was appointed as the Junior Government Whip, and later Senior Government Whip until 1995 and again from 1996 to mid-2004.

Carter was sacked as whip in 1995, after he phoned into a talkback radio show, hosted by fellow National MP John Banks, impersonating a work-shy Māori called Hone, causing widespread offence.

In the first term of the Fifth National Government, Carter was a Minister outside of Cabinet, holding the Civil Defence, Senior Citizens, Racing and Associate Local Government portfolios. He also chaired the Auckland Governance Legislation select committee.

In February 2011, the government announced that Carter would be the next High Commissioner to the Cook Islands. He left Parliament in July 2011, but his departure did not result in a by-election, as the vacancy occurred within six months of the next general election. On 13 June 2011 Carter was granted the right to retain the title of The Honourable for his lifetime. He retired as New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to the Cook Islands in July 2013.

=== Local government ===
Carter returned to the Far North District of New Zealand, successfully running for mayor of the district at the 2013 local elections, defeating the incumbent Wayne Brown. He was re-elected again in both 2016 and 2019. He lives at Waipapakauri Ramp on Ninety Mile Beach.

In October 2021, Carter expressed opposition to the Sixth Labour Government&#x27;s Three Waters reform programme, describing it as a &quot;mistake.&quot;

In September 2022, Carter announced that he would not run as Mayor during the 2022 New Zealand local elections on 8 October. He was succeeded as Mayor of the Far North by Moko Tepania, who became the district&#x27;s first Māori mayor.

==Political views==

Carter is a supporter of the monarchy in New Zealand. In 1992, a year described by Queen Elizabeth II as her &quot;annus horribilis&quot;, Carter called on New Zealanders to write in to express their support for her, having written to &quot;The Times&quot; of London criticising the British media&#x27;s apparent lack of respect towards the Queen. Inundated with letters of support, he remarked that &quot;we wanted her to know we cared&quot;. In March 1994 he publicly disavowed Prime Minister Jim Bolger&#x27;s call for a New Zealand republic.

==Honours==
In 1990, Carter was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2012 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for services as a Member of Parliament.

<doc id="1056579" wikidata="Q5368993" url="?curid=1056579" title="Emancipation of the British West Indies">
<text>The emancipation of the British West Indies refers to the abolition of slavery in Britain&#x27;s colonies in the West Indies during the 1830s. The British government passed the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which emancipated all slaves in the British West Indies. After emancipation, a system of apprenticeship was established, where emancipated slaves were required by the various colonial assemblies to continue working for their former masters for a period of four to six years in exchange for provisions. The system of apprenticeship was abolished by the various colonial assemblies in 1838, after pressure from the British public, completing the process of emancipation. These were the steps taken by British West Indian planters to solve the labour problems created by the emancipation of the enslaved Africans in 1838.

== Anti-slavery movement and emancipation policy ==
Religious, economic, and social factors contributed to the British abolition of slavery throughout their empire. Throughout European colonies in the Caribbean, enslaved people engaged in revolts, labour stoppages and more everyday forms of resistance which enticed colonial authorities, who were eager to create peace and maintain economic stability in the colonies, to consider legislating abolition. The Haitian Revolution in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, the most successful slave uprising in the Americas, heightened British sensitivities to the potential outcomes of insurrection. In addition to slave revolts, Enlightenment schools of thought and evangelism led members of the British public to question the morality of slavery and the slave trade and during the 18th and 19th century there was a surge of abolitionist agitation. Religious figures played a prominent role in the crusade against slavery. Anti-slavery societies such as the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS) circulated pamphlets about the cruelties and inhumanity of slavery, and petitions with hundreds of thousands of signatures were sent to the British Parliament, many of which came from women&#x27;s organizations. Collectively, these men and women politicized slavery and placed pressure on the British government to abolish it. Developments in capitalism also contributed to emancipation. Some scholars, including Trinidadian historian Eric Williams, have claimed that with the emergence of capitalism, slavery was no longer profitable, and as such increased support for abolition beginning in the late 18th century.

British abolitionists saw partial success in their efforts when the government passed the Slave Trade Act 1807, abolishing the slave trade. After passage of the act, these reformers continued to press for the abolition of slavery itself. The British government formally abolished slavery in its colonies with passage of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The legislation went into effect in August 1834 whereby all slaves in the British Empire were considered free under British law. After long and heated debates in Britain, the government agreed to compensate West Indian planters for shifting from slave to free labour, allotting £20 million for this purpose. However, the slaves were not compensated. In fact, the Abolition Act transformed the slaves into &quot;apprentices&quot;, except in the cases of Antigua and Bermuda where the colonial governments rejected apprenticeship and fully emancipated slaves in 1834.

== Apprenticeship ==

=== Policy and conditions ===
The Slavery Abolition Act 1833 established a system of indentured servitude or &quot;apprenticeship&quot; that required freed slaves to continue to work for their former owners as apprentices. The gradual emancipation measure was implemented to ease the transition from slavery to freedom for slaves and former masters but it was in large part a result of concerns about emancipation&#x27;s effect on West Indian sugar production. As stipulated in the emancipation act, field hands were apprenticed for a period of six years, household labourers were to work for four, and children under the age of six were immediately freed. All apprentices&#x27; names were to be placed on a registry that served as documentation of their required service.

Apprentices were required to work no more than 45 hours per week without compensation and were paid for any additional labour. Policy makers reasoned that the opportunity for some paid labour would teach slaves how to be industrious. In return for unpaid labour, ex-slaves received food, housing, clothing and medical treatment from their employers though the Act did not specify precise quantities. Apprentices were prohibited from working on Sundays. If financially able to pay the remaining years of their service, an apprentice could purchase his or her own freedom.

The British government designated Crown-appointed magistrates to oversee the newly implemented labour system and these officials were tasked with protecting the interests of free people of color. Fearful of the response that conditional emancipation might elicit from former slaves, the colonial authorities created police districts to maintain societal order. Within each district were houses of correction and workhouses that were operated and supervised by the chief magistrate and five justices of the peace who were frequently planters as well. Freedpeople could be sent to labour in workhouses for failure to work on the plantations or breaking other duties specified in the Abolition Act. Emancipation legislation banned planters&#x27; use of the whip and the state formally took on the responsibility for disciplining labourers. However, planters could use the remanding of apprentices to workhouses as a means of exercising control over former slaves.

The conditions within workhouses were grim and apprentices were subjected to hard labour and regular physical punishment. Treadmills were common features in these spaces and consisted of &quot;wooden steps around a hollow cylinder on which a prisoner was made to step as the mechanism turned.&quot; The mechanism did not serve to produce any material good but the officials insisted that exhaustively running on the mechanism for several minutes reformed and disciplined prisoners. Widespread support for the use of treadmills also came from West Indian planters who were convinced that former slaves would not produce the same outputs if they were not adequately disciplined with corporal punishment. Photographs that depict the treadmills of the Jamaican workhouses illuminate that this punishment was not restricted to men. Women, who made up a majority of the field labour population in Jamaica and other colonies, were frequently sent to the workhouses and subjected to the treadmill.

=== Apprentice experiences and resistance ===
Once news of the Abolition Act made its way to the colonies, former slaves rejoiced and celebrated their freedom. However, the realization that emancipation would be gradual had a sobering effect. Ex-slaves protested the system of apprenticeship and demanded immediate, unqualified freedom. Because they had long laboured under slavery and performed the same tasks under apprenticeship, they denied the need for a transitional, supervised labour system. Freed people were eager to restructure their lives and devote time to family. They also sought to choose their own work hours, employers, and the type of labour they performed. Many apprentices across the West Indies refused to return to work and went on strike. For their failure to work, many were arrested, flogged under judicial authority, and sent to prison.

Circumstances under apprenticeship were far from ideal for all labourers, but women often faced particular challenges. In the years leading up to emancipation, former masters offered incentives to pregnant women and new mothers for bearing children, because by law, women&#x27;s offspring became the property of the master, thereby producing more wealth for their owner. Under apprenticeship, however, planters were no longer afforded access to women&#x27;s children and consequently employers ceased to offer women &quot;indulgences&quot;. Women were now expected to work while pregnant and with small children, though other ex-slaves demanded that these women be exempt from arduous field labour.

In some cases, apprentices&#x27; protests were effective for producing reforms to the apprenticeship system. In Trinidad, apprentices were granted a five-day work week, masters became required to care for freed children, and workers were compensated for labour performed on a Saturday.

A small number of apprentices attempted to purchase their freedom with some managing to successfully do so. Apprentices were appraised in the local courts and high prices hampered slaves&#x27; ability to free themselves, given their lack of access to material wealth, which was being systematically withheld from them. However, planters&#x27; awareness that apprenticeship&#x27;s abolition was on the horizon led some to settle on a lower price for manumission outside of the courts. This ensured that planters saw some financial gain. They also hoped that such negotiations would encourage apprentices to continue labouring once freed.

=== James Williams&#x27; &quot;A Narrative of Events&quot; and the anti-apprenticeship campaign ===
&quot;A Narrative of Events, since the First of August, 1834, by James Williams, an Apprenticed Labourer in Jamaica&quot; is one of the few published first person accounts by a former slave. It was published in a pamphlet in 1837 and was sold, reprinted and circulated across Britain and Jamaica. The narrative played a critical role in the anti-apprenticeship campaign launched by Joseph Sturge and other members of Britain&#x27;s Central Emancipation Committee. The abolitionists were steadfast in their belief that apprenticeship was merely a continuation of slavery. In 1836, Sturge traveled to Jamaica to gather first hand information about the labour system. While there, he and other anti-apprenticeship activists met James Williams, an apprentice from St. Ann&#x27;s Parish that worked on the Penshurst Plantation for the Senior family, who shared his experience with the abolitionists. Sturge organized to have his narrative recorded by an amanuensis and published it in hopes of informing the British public about Caribbean labour conditions and gaining widespread support for immediate abolition.

The narrative vividly captures James Williams&#x27; experiences under the system of apprenticeship in Jamaica. The physical violence meted out apprentices and sexual abuse they faced are central to Williams&#x27; narrative. Throughout and in great detail, Williams explains how he was treated unfairly by his master and workhouse prisoners were tied to the treadmills, forced to &quot;dance&quot; on the machine after long days of labour and severely flogged. The disruptive effects of forced labour on the families of freed slaves, colonial officials&#x27; inability to effectively regulate the labour system, and the apprentices&#x27; poor living and working conditions are issues that Williams also discusses. The narrative does not include any information about James Williams&#x27; early life and focuses solely on his time as an apprentice. Its narrow focus and centring of violence is likely a result of the narrative&#x27;s political purpose and intended British audience and may suggest that abolitionists and the amanuensis who worked with Williams influenced what themes and details were included. Yet, despite the emphasis on violence, Williams describes how he attempted to resist exploitation through truancy, theft and appealing to magistrates for protection against his masters&#x27; abuses.

&quot;Narrative of Events&quot; was popular, widely circulated and positively received by the British public. However, it also produced a considerable backlash in the West Indies. The &quot;Jamaica Despatch&quot;, a pro-planter Jamaican newspaper, criticized James Williams and Joseph Sturge and insisted that the narrative was propaganda and its claims unfounded. In response, anti-apprenticeship proponents published select apprentice interviews in the local newspapers to bolster Williams&#x27; claims. Historian of the Caribbean Diana Patton has suggested that the extent of planter resistance indicates the political efficacy of the narrative.

Williams&#x27; narrative was particularly helpful in the anti-apprenticeship campaign because it includes specific names and places which made his claims verifiable. As a result, In 1837, after receiving and reviewing the publication, the Colonial Office tasked Sir Lionel Smith, the governor of Jamaica, to investigate the allegations made in Williams&#x27; narrative and to establish a commission to interview the apprentices, magistrates, and workhouse overseers in St. Ann&#x27;s and other Jamaican parishes. The commission consisted of Sir Special Magistrate Daughtrey and local justice Gordon. It commenced its investigation on 20 September 1837. The Gordon &amp; Daughtrey Commission corroborated many of Williams&#x27; claims though there were some discrepancies. Their findings were printed in a special report and in the 1837–1838 Parliamentary Papers.

=== Abolition of apprenticeship ===
&quot;Narrative of Events&quot;, other damaging accounts and investigations of the West Indian workhouses, local fears of rebellion and pressure from the British public led the colonial assemblies to prematurely abolish the apprenticeship system and all had done so by 1838.

== Full emancipation ==
=== British policy ===
The political and citizenship status of newly freed slaves was thoroughly debated among colonial authorities and members of Parliament. Britain&#x27;s colonial secretary, Lord Glenelg, advocated social and political equality. In order to ensure full inclusion into the body politic, he proposed that colonial governors carry out full investigations of colonial laws and policies to eliminate those that were discriminatory or would hamper ex-slaves&#x27; social and economic opportunities. Local planters continued to wield significant power within the colonies following 1838 and though Parliament had legislated emancipation, the colonial assemblies dictated how it would be carried out. Many of these officials proved more reluctant to extend extensive rights to the freed slaves.

=== Reform ===
Missionaries, clergymen, and magistrates sought to morally, culturally and spiritually reform former slaves. In their view, enslavement had contributed to their debasement and the development of backwards cultural practices. They encouraged ex-slaves to legally marry, adopt the nuclear family model, and to take on Victorian gender roles which they believed were they path to achieving respectability and upward mobility. The patriarchal gender ideology they espoused dictated that men were to be heads of their households and responsible for providing for their dependents. Child rearing, caregiving, and domestic work were considered women&#x27;s roles. To some extent, freedmen and women embraced these gender conventions but some aspects of the patriarchal model were incompatible with their economic circumstances, personal preferences and understandings of kinship. Marriage between former slaves did increase with emancipation. However, freedpeople considered their brother- sister, parent-child relationships equally, if not more important. Consequently, having children out of wedlock and single parent households were not uncommon or stigmatized.

Missionaries also established schools and encouraged the freed slaves to adopt Christianity, attend church and adopt the latest European fashions. Most did not adopt these practices wholesale. Instead, they took parts of the European model and melded them with their own African cultural practices. Former slaves often partook in leisure activities such as dancing, participating in carnivals, alcohol consumption, and gambling. Authorities and missionaries detested these practices as they considered them antithetical to their reform efforts. Historian Sheena Boa has suggested that because their mobility and choices were no longer controlled by outsiders, enjoyment of their own bodies was one way that freedmen and women &quot;tested the limits of their freedom.&quot;

=== Land and labour ===
The export of sugar and other staple crops remained central to the economies of the British West Indies. Agricultural production required a substantial labour force and former slaves were expected to meet those labour demands. Some freedmen and women opposed working on their former plantations and all were only willing to labour on their own terms. Planters who were dependent on ex-slaves attributed their unwillingness to work to laziness. Many of the workers proved reluctant to work primarily due to poor wages. Others sought to perform different types of labour including skilled, mechanical and artisanal trades. The aspiration to become independent cultivators and to grow food to support their families and to turn a profit was ubiquitous among the freed West Indians but their success in this endeavor varied. When at all possible, they purchased, rented, and squatted on land. Some authorities and missionaries believed that land ownership would teach former slaves to be independent and industrious and therefore encouraged their efforts. However, in some regions, colonial officials barred freedmen from acquiring property through legal measures, imposition of high property taxes, and directives that required purchasers to buy substantial acreage which many former slaves could not afford. Freed persons who occupied Crown land without authorization were expelled and their provision grounds, used for subsistence or to grow crops for sale, were sometimes burnt or confiscated. Local ordinances stipulated that those not engaged in agricultural production were considered vagrants and subject to imprisonment. These land and employment measures limited independent cultivation and confined many ex-slaves to wage agricultural labour. The need for more cheap labour also led West Indian planters to turn to alternative labour sources, importing indentured labourers from India. British abolitionists would launch campaigns against the practise of importing indentured servants but they failed to achieve the same success they had in previous efforts.

==== Gender ====
Emancipation marked an exodus of black women from wage-based agricultural labour. Some women abandoned plantation fields altogether while others simply reduced the time they spent performing wage agricultural labour. Their exodus demonstrates that freed people did adopt gendered divisions of labour. However, this did not mean that women avoided labour outside of the home all together or simply mirrored western notions of domesticity. Their supplemental income was essential for supporting their families. Consequently, women often engaged in domestic agriculture and sold their crops in the market place while their male kin worked on the estates. Attempts to shield themselves from sexual abuse, the prioritization of child rearing, poor experiences under apprenticeship and political protest may also explain women&#x27;s exodus from wage cultivation.

==Legacy==
By the mid-19th century, just years after emancipation, the Caribbean&#x27;s economy began to fail as a result of dropping sugar prices and planters in regions like Jamaica saw their plantations close down. In Jamaica, by 1865 sugar production was half of what it had been in 1834. These market shifts created massive unemployment, high taxes, and low wages and increased poverty. Living conditions on the islands failed to improve much over the next several decades.

<text>Morton Shulman (25 April 1925 – 18 August 2000) was a Canadian politician, businessman, broadcaster, columnist, coroner, and physician. He was born in Toronto, Ontario in 1925 to a Jewish family. He first came to fame as Ontario&#x27;s Chief Coroner in the early 1960s. During this period, he also became a very successful stock-market player, and authored a bestselling book about how to make money in the stock market. In the mid-1960s he embarrassed the provincial government when he found them to be disobeying provincial health and safety laws. He was fired and then ran for elected office in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, avenging himself by beating a government Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP). He completed two terms as the High Park electoral district&#x27;s MPP, and did not run in the 1975 Ontario general election. His fame grew in the late 1970s and 1980s when he hosted a nationally distributed television talk show called &quot;The Shulman File&quot;. He was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in the early 1980s and became a pharmaceutical entrepreneur specializing in treatments for that disease. Near the end of his life, he received recognition for his lifetime&#x27;s work, when he was appointed to the Order of Canada, the country&#x27;s highest civilian award. He died in Toronto in the year 2000.

== Biography ==
Morton Shulman was born on 25 April 1925, in Toronto, Ontario, where he also grew up and was educated. Shulman received his Doctor of Medicine from the University of Toronto in 1948. Shulman practiced throughout his professional life with a general practice on Roncesvalles Avenue in Toronto. He became wealthy through investing in the stock market and wrote a bestselling book, &quot;Anyone Can Make a Million&quot; in 1966. He was married to Gloria Shulman (née Bossin) and they had two children: environmental lawyer and Toronto city councillor, Dianne Saxe; and, Dr. Geoffrey Shulman (1954-2012). 

=== Coroner ===
In exchange for his involvement in the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, by helping his local candidate, William James Stewart defeat incumbent CCF MPP, Lloyd Fell in Parkdale, in the 1951 election, he was appointed to the Coroner&#x27;s Office as a junior in 1952. In 1961, he was promoted, when he was appointed as Ontario&#x27;s chief coroner. In 1963, he was named Chief Coroner of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. Shulman was outspoken and used his position as coroner to crusade on a number of issues such as enacting tougher regulations on lifejackets for small boats, having government regulate car safety, the introduction of breathalysers into Ontario, and against then-restrictive abortion laws after he investigated the deaths of women who had died while trying to terminate their pregnancies. In other crusades, he helped to force surgeons to count instruments before and after surgery, and construction companies to provide better bracing in trenches. His years as a coroner became the inspiration for the Canadian television drama &quot;Wojeck&quot;.

=== Political career ===
After embarrassing the Progressive Conservative (Tory) provincial government, by revealing its inaction in enforcing the fire code in a recently built hospital, he was fired, in 1967, as Metropolitan Toronto&#x27;s Chief Coroner. He decided to avenge himself by running for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Despite ideological differences, he ran for the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) in the High Park electoral district, where his medical clinic was located. Despite his strong capitalist beliefs, he decided to run for the social democratic party because they gave him a free hand in choosing where to run, and because their views in support of public safety were compatible with his. He was elected as a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in the 1967 provincial election, by defeating High Park&#x27;s 16-year incumbent MPP, Progressive Conservative Alfred Hozack Cowling by over 6200 votes.

He used his position in the legislature to become a thorn in the side of the Tory governments led by John Robarts and Bill Davis. He asked provocative questions in the legislature and was known for stunts, such as selling the book &quot;The Happy Hooker&quot; out of his office after it had been banned by the Toronto Police morality squad — he offered MPPs a 10 percent discount. Once, to make a point about lax security, he carried a pellet gun — dressed up to look like a submachine gun — in a bag through an Ontario nuclear plant, and then pulled it out on the floor of the Legislature. He waved it around happily while cabinet ministers sitting across from him hid under their desks. He wrote the book &quot;MPP&quot; to describe his experiences, one of at least three autobiographies that he wrote.
Shulman demanded that he be appointed Attorney General if the NDP ever won government. NDP leader Stephen Lewis refused to commit to making such a promise. After clashing with his colleagues in the NDP — particularly Lewis — Shulman decided to leave the legislature and did not run in the 1975 election.

After leaving politics, he started a broadcasting career, most notably from 1977 until 1983, he hosted a hard-hitting television talk show on CITY-TV called &quot;The Shulman File&quot; which featured confrontational interviews, sensationalist and risqué topics and outrageous opinions. The show was spoofed by &quot;SCTV&quot; as &quot;Murray&#x27;s File&quot;. At the same time, he began writing a regular column in the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; which continued into the 1990s. During this period, he became more involved in the financial community, heading up a mutual fund and pursuing various business interests.

=== Deprenyl ===
Shulman was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1983, and formed a company, Deprenyl Research Ltd. (which became Draxis Health Inc.), in order to acquire Canadian rights to the anti-Parkinson&#x27;s drug Deprenyl. His company engaged in a long fight with the federal government for approval of the drug for sale in Canada. He also started a second pharmaceutical company, called DUSA, later run by his son.

=== Honours and death ===
In 1993, Shulman was awarded the Order of Canada, and was invested as an Officer of the Order on 6 January 1994. After battling Parkinson&#x27;s disease for more than 17 years, he finally succumbed to the complications arising from that disease at the Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care in Toronto on August 18, 2000. He was buried in Pardes Shalom Cemetery on Dufferin Street two days later. In 2013, a street leading to Ontario&#x27;s new forensic services and coroner&#x27;s complex, in Toronto&#x27;s North York area, was named Morton Shulman Avenue.

<text>Uwajimaya, Inc., doing business as , is a family-owned supermarket chain with its corporate headquarters in the International District, Seattle, Washington, and with locations in Greater Seattle and Oregon. Uwajimaya sells mainly Asian food—with an emphasis on Japanese—though it also stocks Western staples. The flagship store is in Seattle&#x27;s Chinatown/International District with three other stores in Beaverton, Oregon, Bellevue, Washington and Renton, Washington. From 1968 to 1991 there was another store in the Southcenter Mall in Tukwila, Washington.

==History==
Uwajimaya was founded in 1928 by Fujimatsu Moriguchi of Yawatahama, Japan, in Tacoma, Washington. Fujimatsu sold fishcakes and other goods from his truck to Japanese farmers, loggers and fishermen at work sites. Moriguchi named his company &quot;Uwajima-ya&quot; after the town of Uwajima (Ehime Prefecture), where he first entered the business (&quot;ya&quot; (屋) is the Japanese word for &quot;store&quot;).

As part of the internment of Japanese Americans following the entry of the United States into World War II, The US Government sent Moriguchi and his family to the Tule Lake Internment Camp in 1942. Upon their release, they moved to Seattle and set up shop at 422 S. Main Street in the International District.

In the 1960s, Uwajimaya began to expand its offering of non-food items and imported food from Japan and other Asian countries and experienced tremendous growth at the Century 21 Exposition in 1962. That same year, Fujimatsu Moriguchi died, and breaking with Japanese tradition, control of the company was passed to his four sons, rather than only his eldest son. The sons subsequently divided ownership with their three sisters and their mother Sadako.
In 1970, the store moved two blocks south to 6th Avenue S. and S. King Street, thus becoming one of the biggest in the Pacific Northwest, and expanded in 1978 adding more than half again its original size. 1978 also saw the opening of the Bellevue Uwajimaya.

In 1991, Tokyo-based Kinokuniya Bookstore opened its first Seattle location on the second floor of the Seattle store selling primarily Japanese language books, movies, DVD, videos, music, and periodicals.

In 1998, Uwajimaya, with Lorig Associates, started developing Uwajimaya Village, a mixed retail, residential center that would take up three city blocks including the purchase and closure of S. Lane Street between 5th and 6th Avenues South. The Lane Street closure was controversial within the community, especially among some local small-business owners who were concerned that it would increase traffic, decrease emergency vehicle access, and have a negative economic impact on other businesses. The International District saw a protest of over 500 strong, the biggest street protests since the Kingdome was built. Save Lane Street, a group formed to stop the street closure, collected over $140,000 and 4,000 signatures and sued both the city of Seattle and Uwajimaya. The group lost their case, eventually appealing to the King County Superior Court and then the state Court of Appeals. In the end S. Lane Street was vacated to allow Uwajimaya to provide a pedestrian walkway to customer parking to the south.
In 1998, Uwajimaya opened its third store, the first outside Washington located in Oregon near the Beaverton high-tech corridor. This location was formerly a Jafco store, another retail chain founded in Seattle.

Upon completion of the Uwajimaya Village project in 2000, the flagship store moved one block south to a building nearly twice the size of the previous store at . Uwajimaya Village includes a food court, bank, restaurant, optician, beauty salon, cellular wireless store, and cosmetic shop. The Kinokuniya Bookstore also relocated to a new location at the corner of 5th Avenue S. and S. Weller Street. Above the first floor of retail shops and underground parking garage is the 176-unit Uwajimaya Village Apartments.

Sadako (Tsutakawa) Moriguchi, wife of Fujimatsu and sister of George Tsutakawa, died in 2002. She had worked in the store from its inception until she reached the age of 85.

Uwajimaya opened another location in Renton, Washington on July 1, 2009.

In August 2016, Uwajimaya announced its intention to launch a line of smaller, boutique stores known as &quot;Kai Market by Uwajimaya&quot;. Kai Market opened in Seattle&#x27;s South Lake Union neighborhood in 2017, but closed in 2020 due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains closed as of the start of 2023.

<doc id="1056585" wikidata="Q3774564" url="?curid=1056585" title="Improved Mobile Telephone Service">
<text>The Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) was a pre-cellular VHF/UHF radio system which linked to the public telephone network. IMTS was the radiotelephone equivalent of land dial phone service. Introduced in 1964, it replaced Mobile Telephone Service (MTS) and improved on most MTS systems by offering direct-dial rather than connections through a live operator, and full-duplex operation so both parties could talk at the same time.

== Technical Information ==

The original Bell System US and Canadian mobile telephone system includes three frequency bands, VHF Low (35-44 MHz, 9 channels), VHF High (152-158 MHz, 11 channels in the U.S., 13 channels in Canada), and UHF (454-460 MHz, 12 channels). Alternative names were &quot;Low Band&quot;, &quot;High band&quot; and &quot;UHF&quot;. In addition to the Bell system (wireline incumbent) channels, another 7 channels at VHF, and 12 channels at UHF were granted to non-wireline companies designated as &quot;RCCs&quot; (Radio Common Carriers). These RCC channels were adjacent to the Bell System frequencies.

RCCs were also allowed to offer paging services to &quot;beepers&quot; or &quot;pagers&quot; on a secondary basis on the same channels, but soon, with the growth of paging, RCC mobile phone services were given lower priority. Some RCCs utilized IMTS technology, but most adopted the &quot;Secode-2805&quot; system which allowed for simultaneous paging, so after a few years, the predominant provider of mobile telephone service was the Bell System companies.

A given provider might have offered service on one, two, or all three bands, although IMTS was never offered on low band (only MTS, but Whidbey Telephone in Washington State had a custom-designed direct-dial system.) These were prone to network congestion and interference since a radio closer to the terminal would sometimes take over the channel because of its stronger signal. Cellular networks remedied this problem by decreasing the area covered by one tower (a &quot;cell&quot;) and increasing the number of cells. The disadvantage of this is more towers are required to cover a given area. Thus, IMTS and MTS systems still exist in some remote areas, as it may be the only feasible way to cover a large sparsely-populated area.

The basic operation of IMTS was very advanced for its time, considering that integrated circuits were not commonly available. The most common IMTS phone, the Motorola TLD-1100 series, used two circuit boards about 8 inches square, to perform the channel scanning and digit decoding process, and all logic was performed with discrete transistors. In a given city, one IMTS base station channel was &quot;marked idle&quot; by the transmission of a steady 2000 Hz &quot;idle&quot; tone. Mobiles would scan the available frequencies and lock on to the channel transmitting the idle tone. When a call was placed to a mobile, the idle tone would change to 1800 Hz &quot;channel seize&quot; tone (the idle tone would appear on another frequency, if available), and the 7 digit mobile number (three digits of the NPA and the last four digits of subscriber number, the NXX was not sent) would be sent out as rotary dial pulses, switching between 2000 and 1800 Hz to represent digits. Any mobile recognizing that the call was for someone else would resume scanning for mark idle tone, while the called mobile would then transmit 2150 Hz &quot;guard&quot; tone back to the base station. This would also initiate ringing at the mobile, and when the mobile subscriber picked up the phone, 1633 Hz &quot;connect&quot; tone would be sent back to the base station to indicate answer supervision and the voice path would be cut through. When the mobile hung up, a burst of alternating 1336 &quot;disconnect&quot; and 1800 Hz &quot;seize&quot; tones would be sent to allow the base station to service another call.

Mobiles would originate calls by sending a burst of connect tone, to which the base station responded with a burst of seize tone. The mobile would then respond with its identification, consisting of its area code and last four digits of the phone number sent at 20 pulses per second, just as in inward dialing but with the addition of rudimentary parity checking. Digits are formed with a pulsetrain of alternating tones, either connect and silence (for odd digits) or connect and guard (for even digits). When the base station received the calling party&#x27;s identification, it would send dialtone to the mobile. The user would then use the rotary dial, which would send the dialed digits as an alternating 10 pps pulse train (originally, directly formed by the rotary dial) of connect and guard tones.

=== Terminal ===
IMTS systems typically had 25 watts of transmitter power at the mobile station and 100-250 Watts at the terminal — unlike the newer cellular car telephones that had maximum power output of 3 watts and modern cellular handsets with power outputs of 0.6 watts. Mobile installations normally consisted of a &quot;head unit&quot; or the telephone handset which sat in a cradle with a direct dialing keyboard. These looked and functioned much like a landline, or hardwired, telephone. Unlike cellular handsets, these units passed through a dial tone when the receiver was lifted from the cradle and in this way seemed more like a landline telephone. There was a separate large radio transceiver chassis, typically measuring at least a foot square and 6 inches high, mounted either in the trunk or under the seats of an automobile. These transceivers were connected to the handset cradle with a multi-conductor cable usually around .5 inch thick.

The mobile antennas almost always required a hole to be drilled in the body of the car to mount the antenna in; until the 1970s there were no &quot;on-glass&quot; antennas - these were developed later for the cellular car-mounted telephones. These whip antennas looked much like those used for CB radios and were about 19 in. long (1/4 wavelength at 155 MHz). These mobile telephone systems required a large amount of power (10 to 15 amperes at 12 volts) and this was supplied by thick power cabling connected directly to the automobile&#x27;s battery. It therefore was quite possible and not uncommon for an IMTS telephone to drain an automobile&#x27;s battery if used for moderate periods of time without the automobile engine running or if left on overnight. Optionally these units were also connected to the car&#x27;s horn and could honk the horn as a ringer to summon a user who was away from the car.

The IMTS units were &quot;full duplex&quot;, meaning that a user could both talk and hear the other party at the same time. This was an improvement over the earlier MTS systems, most of which were &quot;half duplex&quot;, allowing only one party to transmit at a time; the user had to &quot;push to talk&quot; to speak and then &quot;unkey&quot; the transmitter to hear the other party on the line. In 1960 General Electric introduced the &quot;Progress Line&quot; DTO- series MTS mobiles which were full duplex, although subscribers were still required to press the &quot;push to talk&quot; bar on the handset to speak.

There were also IMTS handheld transceivers (Yaesu&#x27;s 1982 vintage Traveler) that operated on 2-4 watts, and these were all half duplex. These were essentially modified &quot;walkie-talkies&quot; with a DTMF (dual tone multi-frequency) keypad attached on the front panel, which &quot;fooled&quot; the terminal into believing an IMTS mobile was using the system. These units were not very common or practical because they lacked the power to reliably connect to the base station over the distances common in the IMTS systems. A compromise existed with the briefcase phone, which had somewhat higher power in the range of 10 to 20 watts (depending on how much battery was in the briefcase), and which was full duplex. Typical IMTS briefcase phones were made by Canyon, GCS, SCM Melabs and Livermore Data Systems.

=== Base station===
IMTS base station sites generally covered an area 40–60 miles in diameter. This extended range was due to both their large transmitter power and in many cases higher antenna placement at anywhere from 100 to 500 ft. IMTS base stations in larger cities had as many as 7 or 8 channels while rural stations had as few as one or two channels. Each telephone conversation (connection) required the exclusive use of a channel for the duration. Because of this limitation these systems had a much lower capacity than cellular systems and all channels busy conditions were common. In larger cities this dictated a very limited number of simultaneous calls. Each subscriber was given a packet of dialing and use instructions. Roaming (receiving calls out of the &quot;home area&quot;) was achieved by selecting the specific channels used by the tower and service provider the user was traveling in and dialing a three-digit code, thereby logging the user&#x27;s land number at that location. This process had to be repeated at each tower which, as noted, usually had a range of 40–60 miles. Some areas only had half-duplex (one-way) communications and required the push-to-talk switch in the handset, between the mouthpiece and the earpiece. Two lights on the &quot;head&quot; indicated busy (red) if no channels were idle and in-use (green) if connected to the tower, or depressing the push-to-talk switch. There was no encryption and all conversations were public.

=== Frequencies ===
The frequencies listed below (in MHz) are those formerly used in the US &amp; Canadian Mobile Telephone Service and the Improved Mobile Telephone Service. The low band &quot;Z&quot; prefixed channels were always operated in the MTS, or manual mode. The &quot;Z&quot; channels were sold at auction by the FCC in approximately 2003 to other services and remain largely unused. The VHF and UHF frequencies have been opened to other services unrelated to mobile telephony and largely reassigned.

The two VHF high-band channels designated JJ and JW were used only in Canada, and were not available for use in the United States.

== Limitations ==

IMTS technology severely limited the total number of subscribers. In the 1970s and the early 1980s, before the introduction of cellular phones, there were &quot;waiting lists&quot; of up to three years for those wishing to have mobile telephone service. These potential subscribers were waiting for other subscribers to disconnect their subscription in order to obtain a mobile telephone number and mobile phone service.

These limitations resulted in low quantity sales and production of IMTS phones and the mobile units were therefore very expensive ($2,000 to $4,000). Prior to the divestiture of AT&amp;T in 1984, Bell System IMTS subscribers usually leased the equipment at a monthly rate of up to $120. Availability of the channels was scarce hence airtime was also quite expensive at $0.70-1.20 per minute. Following the divestiture, customer-owned equipment was required by Bell companies and monthly rates then typically ran to $25 plus air time. Also, since there were so few channels, it was common for the phones to &quot;queue up&quot; to use a channel and IMTS manufacturers competed for the speed with which the units would seize an available channel.

The limit of customer numbers on MTS and IMTS was the driver for investment in cellular networks. In remote regions, this is not the case; in remote regions, obsolescence is the driver, but the lack of a suitable and affordable alternative has resulted in regulatory obstacles: customers did not want the MTS/IMTS service to be withdrawn. Increasing affordability of satellite service, and government investment in cellular expansion allowed MTS and IMTS to be removed.

<doc id="1056588" wikidata="Q5294720" url="?curid=1056588" title="Donald Luskin">
<text>Donald Luskin (born April 1954) is Chief Investment Officer for Trend Macrolytics LLC, a consulting firm he founded in 2001, providing investment strategy and macroeconomics forecasting and research for institutional investors. Luskin contributes commentaries on the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, and appears regularly on Fox Business. He was formerly a CNBC contributor, a contributing editor and columnist for National Review Online (NRO), and a columnist for TheStreet.com. His media commentaries and appearances touch on investing, economic and political matters.

Luskin has published three books, &quot;Index Options and Futures: The Complete Guide&quot;, &quot;Portfolio Insurance: A Guide to Dynamic Hedging&quot; and &quot;I Am John Galt: Today&#x27;s Heroic Innovators Building the World and the Villainous Parasites Destroying It&quot; (co-author Andrew Greta). 

Luskin also wrote a blog, &quot;The Conspiracy to Keep You Poor and Stupid,&quot; based on the title of his as-yet unpublished book. The blog&#x27;s tagline was: &quot;How big government, big business, big media and big academia block your road to financial freedom—and tell you it&#x27;s for your own good.&quot; Luskin is a self-avowed libertarian, and his blog linked to other financial and political blogs espousing similar beliefs.

== Biography and achievements ==
On his former blog, Luskin stated he &quot;attended Yale in 1973–1974; dropped out to rejoin the real world as soon as possible.&quot;

After dropping out of college, Luskin worked for several years as a creative consultant to Los Angeles companies such as Mattel and Teledyne, and motion picture studios LucasFilm and Warner Brothers, where he worked on iconic films such as Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s The Shining and Ken Russell&#x27;s Altered States. He and two colleagues developed a series of all-night treasure-hunts, one of which was adapted into the Walt Disney motion picture &quot;Midnight Madness&quot;.

Luskin&#x27;s investment career began in 1979, when he started a hedge fund while an options market maker on the Pacific Stock Exchange. As his fund grew and evolved, he became a market maker on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (where he helped pioneer index options trading, executing the very first OEX contract) and the New York Stock Exchange, where he traded the first option contract in the NYSE&#x27;s history.

In 1984 Luskin joined Jefferies &amp; Co., a brokerage firm. There as senior vice president, he invented POSIT, a crossing network enabling institutional investors to exchange entire portfolios with each other. POSIT was later spun out of Jefferies as a separate publicly traded company, Investment Technology Group.

In 1987 Luskin joined Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, as senior vice president in charge of investment management and trading. He became vice chairman when the firm merged with Nikko Securities in 1989, becoming Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors. When the firm was acquired by Barclays Bank in 1995 and became Barclays Global Investors, Luskin became chief executive officer of the firm&#x27;s global business in mutual funds. The firm was subsequently acquired by BlackRock. Over Luskin&#x27;s eleven years with the firm, assets under management grew from $69 billion to over $500 billion. Luskin was responsible for numerous innovations in index funds and quantitative investing—including the development of domestic and international quant-active funds, every one of which outperformed its benchmark over Luskin&#x27;s tenure. Luskin developed the iShares ETF family and created the LifePath funds, the first target-date mutual funds, for which he is the named inventor on a US patent.

In August 1999, during the tech bubble, Luskin and partner Dave Nadig started the MetaMarkets Open Fund, the first mutual fund to publish trades and list its holdings in real-time via its website. This &quot;transparency&quot; and &quot;openness,&quot; Luskin and Nadig said, was a step forward in the financial world, equivalent to the political revolutions and international democratic transformations of the 1990s, because it leveled the playing field for the average investor and overthrew &quot;financial elites.&quot; MetaMarkets.com, the venture-backed company that Luskin and Nadig founded to operate OpenFund, was funded primarily by the venture arm of global luxury goods firm LVMH. It was hailed by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;coolest companies&quot; in America in 2000. Their model was dismissed by some analysts as being a &quot;gimmick,&quot; having nothing to do with investing &quot;per se&quot;: &quot;They brought chat boards to life in a mutual fund.&quot; At its peak, OpenFund received $45 million in investments, and the fund&#x27;s biggest positions included companies like JDS Uniphase and Extreme Networks. At the end of 1999, OpenFund was among a handful of the best-performing mutual funds in America. After the market top in March 2000, the valuations of technology companies collapsed and many OpenFund investors redeemed their shares. The fund was shut down in the summer of 2001, after losing much of its investors&#x27; money. Published reports note that the open fund lost over half its value.

== Predictions ==

Over the years, some of his predictions have drawn controversy. In May 2001, when he was a columnist for the financial website theStreet.com, he predicted a new bull market in gold and gold stocks, for which he drew intense criticism from fellow columnists including Jim Cramer. Shortly thereafter, Luskin&#x27;s escalating public dispute with Cramer led to his resignation from theStreet.com via real-time postings on the site&#x27;s discussion boards that became a cause célèbre on the web.

Luskin&#x27;s predictions courted controversy again in 2008 when, in a September &quot;The Washington Post&quot; opinion piece, he cited evidence of what he claimed were factual errors made by Barack Obama and members of his presidential campaign concerning the state of the economy. Luskin claimed that the market was healthy, and Obama was simply using the state of the economy to discredit John McCain. However, the following day, Lehman Brothers filed for the biggest bankruptcy in US history and two days later, on September 16, stock markets imploded, thus discrediting every prediction he made in his editorial. Additionally, in the same editorial, he cited evidence that the economy was weak, but not in recession. He wrote, &quot;…anyone who says we&#x27;re in a recession, or heading into one—especially the worst one since the Great Depression—is making up his own private definition of recession.&quot; Shortly afterward, following the sudden collapse of Lehman and several other large financial firms, the economy sharply worsened, and was subsequently declared to have been in recession all year by the National Bureau of Economic Research. &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; included Luskin&#x27;s prediction in its list of &quot;The 10 Worst Predictions for 2008&quot; on its website and noted that it gave additional opportunities for liberal bloggers to criticize Luskin. The editors of &quot;The Yale Book of Quotations&quot; also made note of the inopportune timing of Luskin&#x27;s editorial and included his prediction in their list of &quot;Top ten quotes of 2008&quot;. He has been singled out for &quot;some of the worst, money losing commentary of the past few years.&quot;

He has been frequently referred to by Brad DeLong as &quot;the Stupidest Man Alive&quot; for, among other things, his continued support for literal interpretations of the Laffer Curve.

== Conflicts with Paul Krugman ==
Luskin has been controversial as a public intellectual. Much of his blog and many of his &quot;NRO&quot; columns were devoted to arguments that economic facts, figures, and trends are distorted by politicians, pundits and the media. He has a particular animosity towards &quot;The New York Times&quot;, especially columnist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, whose economic pronouncements he endeavored to debunk. Luskin was &quot;de facto&quot; leader of what he called the &quot;Krugman Truth Squad,&quot; an ad hoc group of bloggers dedicated to detailing and rebutting what they consider Krugman&#x27;s lies and distortions.

According to Daniel Okrent, former Public Editor of the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Luskin serves as Javert to Krugman&#x27;s Jean Valjean. From a perch on &quot;National Review Online&quot;, he regularly assaults Krugman&#x27;s logic, his politics, his economic theories, his character and his accuracy.&quot; Luskin claims that his work has resulted in corrections from Krugman and &quot;the imposition of a new and more rigorous corrections policy for the entire &quot;Times&quot; editorial page.&quot;

Krugman occasionally responded directly to Luskin&#x27;s criticisms. In one instance Luskin accused Krugman of making an error in his appraisal of the costs and effects of the 2003 tax cuts. Krugman responded with a series of postings on his website. In one such posting, apparently referring to the persistence of Luskin&#x27;s criticisms, Krugman humorously referred to Luskin as his &quot;stalker-in-chief&quot;. Later, after Luskin appeared at a Krugman book signing, Krugman said of Luskin on the Fox News television program &quot;Hannity and Colmes&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s a guy, that&#x27;s a guy who actually stalks me on the web, and once stalked me personally&quot;. The animosity between Luskin and Krugman became so intense it became the subject of a story in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; with extensive remarks from both men. Krugman&#x27;s characterization of Luskin as a stalker was repeated by blogger Atrios (Duncan Black) prompting a threat of legal action from lawyers representing Luskin.

<doc id="1056589" wikidata="Q2716264" url="?curid=1056589" title="Spoonman">
<text>&quot;Spoonman&quot; is a song by the American band Soundgarden. Written by the band&#x27;s frontman, Chris Cornell, &quot;Spoonman&quot; was released on February 14, 1994, as the first single from the band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Superunknown&quot; (1994). &quot;Spoonman&quot; is credited as one of the songs that launched Soundgarden&#x27;s career into the mainstream. The song peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart and number nine on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. A remixed version of the song by Steve Fisk appears on the &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; and &quot;My Wave&quot; singles. The song was included on Soundgarden&#x27;s 1997 greatest hits album &quot;A-Sides&quot; and the 2010 compilation album &quot;Telephantasm&quot;.

==Origin and recording==
&quot;Spoonman&quot; was originally written for the to the 1992 film &quot;Singles&quot;. At that time, Soundgarden, along with Pearl Jam, were working on the soundtrack for the film. Pearl Jam&#x27;s bass guitarist, Jeff Ament, had been put in charge of creating the name for a fictional band that would appear in the film. Before finally choosing Citizen Dick for its name, Ament had compiled a list of potential names, which included the name &quot;Spoonman&quot;. The name was inspired by Artis the Spoonman, a street performer from Santa Cruz, California, and later Seattle, Washington, who plays music with a set of spoons. Soundgarden&#x27;s vocalist and songwriter, Chris Cornell, eventually used the names on the list to create songs for the film. &quot;Spoonman&quot; was among these, and an acoustic version was created from it. This early version of the song is played during a scene in the film in which a poster advertising a Citizen Dick show is stapled to a lightpost.

Rather than just leave the song on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, Soundgarden began working on an electric version of &quot;Spoonman&quot;. The song&#x27;s inspiration, Artis the Spoonman, played a prominent role in the song. The final version of the song featured Artis the Spoonman playing his spoons as part of the song&#x27;s bridge. Drummer Matt Cameron also plays pots and pans on the song and bass guitarist, Ben Shepherd, performs backing vocals.

==Composition==
&quot;Spoonman&quot; was performed in drop D tuning.The main riff was written in septuple meter, in time. The chorus is and part of the spoon solo is in . The guitarist, Kim Thayil, has said that Soundgarden usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after the band had written it and said that the use of odd meters was &quot;a total accident&quot;.

==Release and reception==
The band played &quot;Spoonman&quot; while on its 1993 tour with Neil Young. With hype building around the band&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;Superunknown&quot;, Soundgarden released the single in 1994, a month before the album&#x27;s release, with a previously unreleased B-side titled &quot;Exit Stonehenge&quot;. On the choice of &quot;Spoonman&quot; as the album&#x27;s first single, Shepherd called it a &quot;great first choice&quot;, adding that &quot;it just jumps out at you instantly&quot;. Shepherd said, &quot;You know how you listen to a record and there is one song that literally seems to leap out of the speakers—well, &#x27;Spoonman&#x27; did that to me.&quot; Shortly after the single&#x27;s release, the song became widely popular, reaching high positions on rock charts. The song peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. At the 1995 Grammy Awards, &quot;Spoonman&quot; received the award for Best Metal Performance.

Outside the United States, the single was released commercially in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. In Canada, the song reached number 12 on the Canadian singles chart, reached the UK Top 20, peaked at number 23 on the Australian Singles Chart, reached the top 30 in Ireland and the top ten in New Zealand.

In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song number 12 on its list of the 15 greatest Soundgarden songs, and, in 2021, &quot;Kerrang&quot; ranked the song number five on its list of the 20 greatest Soundgarden songs.

&quot;Spoonman&quot; appears in the 2001 video game &quot;ATV Offroad Fury&quot; for the PlayStation 2. The song is also used in the 2008 video games &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;, &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;, and as a cover in &quot;Rock Revolution&quot;. The following year, the song appeared on the soundtrack of the PSP game &quot;Rock Band Unplugged&quot;, which included a number of tracks from &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;. Despite the inclusion on the &quot;Unplugged&quot; track list, Spoonman did not export from &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; to &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; because of licensing conflicts. It appeared again on the track list of the 2012 downloadable game &quot;Rock Band Blitz&quot; and became playable in &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; as part of the Blitz song pack. The song is also available as downloadable content for &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot; as part of the &quot;Telephantasm&quot; album pack and for &quot;&quot;.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Spoonman&quot; was directed by Jeffrey Plansker (under the alias &quot;John Smithey&quot;). The video features Artis prominently, making him the focus of the video instead of the band, who are shown only in black-and-white still photographs. The video was released in February 1994.

In an interview with &quot;Hit Parader&quot; magazine in 1994, Chris Cornell said about the music video:
I think we were fairly smart with &quot;Spoonman&quot; in that you really don&#x27;t see us that much in the video. You see various pictures of us, but it&#x27;s not quite the same as having us in your living room all the time. We&#x27;re trying to maintain some degree of mystique about Soundgarden, I guess. I remember back when I was a kid, long before MTV, and the only way to see my favorite bands was to go to their concerts. It was an incredible experience. MTV has helped a lot of bands, but they&#x27;ve also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique. It&#x27;s tough when you can see a great rock band on TV one second, then hit the clicker and be watching a soap opera or a sitcom the next. That&#x27;s what rock and roll has become for some people.

<text>The Darling Downs is a farming region on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range in southern Queensland, Australia. The Downs are to the west of South East Queensland and are one of the major regions of Queensland. The name was generally applied to an area approximating to that of the Condamine River catchment upstream of Condamine township but is now applied to a wider region comprising the Southern Downs, Western Downs, Toowoomba and Goondiwindi local authority areas. The name Darling Downs was given in 1827 by Allan Cunningham, the first European explorer to reach the area and recognises the then Governor of New South Wales, Ralph Darling.

The region has developed a strong and diverse agricultural industry largely due to the extensive areas of vertosols (cracking clay soils), particularly black vertosols, of moderate to high fertility and available water capacity. Manufacturing and mining, particularly coal mining are also important, and coal seam gas extraction experienced significant growth in the decade up to 2016.

The landscape is dominated by rolling hills covered by pastures of many different species, vegetables, legumes such as soy beans and chick peas, and other crops including cotton, wheat, barley and sorghum. Between the farmlands there are long stretches of crisscrossing roads, bushy ridges, winding creeks and herds of cattle. There are farms with beef and dairy cattle, pigs, sheep and lamb stock. Other typical sights include irrigation systems, windmills serving as water well pumps to get water from the Great Artesian Basin, light planes crop-dusting, rusty old woolsheds and other scattered remnants from a bygone era of early exploration and settlement.

The region is recognised as a cultural icon on the list of Queensland&#x27;s Q150 icons.

==History==
Baranggum (also known as Barrunggam, Barunggam Parrungoom, Murrumgama) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Baranggum people. The Baranggum language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Western Downs Regional Council, particularly Dalby, Tara, Jandowae and west towards Chinchilla.

Originally, the Darling Downs was covered with a wealth of indigenous grasses which created an ideal verdure for stock eight months of the year. The Darling Downs Aboriginals had an annual burning season at the time when the indigenous grasses were ripe and dry. The annual fires gave the local Aboriginals of the Darling Downs the name &quot;Goonneeburra&quot; or &quot;Fire Blacks&quot; – &quot;goonnee&quot; being a name for fire and &quot;burra&quot; a generic word for the whole race. This is what the Downs tribes were known as to the coastal Aborigines who inhabited the Moreton Bay area. Murri is a wider-spread generic word meaning the whole race but in the Kamabroi dialect. The Downs tribes spoke one common dialect, called Waccah and so to all other surrounding tribes were known as the Wacca-burra. The Goonnee-burra were once situated where Warwick stands today. Goonnee meant &quot;the ones who hunt with fire&quot;.

Allan Cunningham set out to explore the area to the west of Moreton Bay in 1827, crossing to the west of the Great Dividing Range from the Hunter Region and travelling north. In June 1827, Cunningham climbed to the top of Mount Dumaresque (near what is now Clintonvale close to Maryvale) and after wrote in his diary that this lush area was ideal for settlement. Exploring around Mount Dumaresque, Cunningham found a pass, now known as Cunninghams Gap. Cunningham returned to Moreton Bay in 1828 and with Charles Fraser charted the route through the pass to the Darling Downs. Ludwig Leichhardt in 1844 saw the remains of a camp showing the signs of white men through ridge poles and steel axes.

News of the lush pastures quickly spread resulting in a land grab that authorities in the distant New South Wales colony found difficult to stop. Patrick Leslie was the first European person to settle on the Darling Downs in 1840, establishing a sheep property at Canning Downs on the Condamine River in 1846. Other well-established residences on the southern downs include Glengallan Homestead, Talgai Homestead, Pringle Cottage and Rosenthal Homestead. One of the first stations to be established was Jimbour House. It was also the point where Leichhardt launched his expedition to the Northern Territory in 1844.
By 1844, there were 26 properties including a number of sheep stations with more than 150,000 head. Local aboriginals and European squatters co-settled the area from the late 1840s onwards. Darling Downs then became known as the &#x27;jewel in the diadem of squatterdom&#x27; with an elite &#x27;pure merino&#x27; class living in comfortable houses.

In 1854, Charles Douglas Eastaughffe settled in the area. Spicers Gap Road opened up the area in the 1850s. Later the expansion of Queensland Rail&#x27;s train networks and Cobb and Co&#x27;s stagecoach transport greatly assisted access to the region. Gold was found in the district around this time, however it was agricultural activity that provided for the boom times ahead.

The 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike started at Jondaryan. The Darling Downs experienced a water crisis as the Condamine River dried up during the severe drought of 1994/1995.

During the early 20th century dairy was a significant industry for Queensland. The 1930s saw the peaking of the dairy industry on the Downs with 6,500 farms and over 200,000 milking cows. The Downs Co-operative Dairy Association expanded, constructed or purchased at least 10 butter and cheese factories across the Darling Downs. The Downs Co-operative Dairy Association Limited Factory in Toowoomba closed in 2006.

In 2010, the population of the Darling Downs was estimated to be 241,537 people.

In 2022, the Wieambilla police shootings took place, marking the first fundamentalist Christian terrorist attack in Australia.

==Geography ==
The largest city and commercial centre of the Darling Downs is Toowoomba about west of Brisbane. Other towns situated on what is now called The Downs include Dalby, Warwick, Stanthorpe, Wallangarra, Goondiwindi, Oakey, Miles, Pittsworth, Allora, Clifton, Cecil Plains, Drayton, Millmerran, Nobby, and Chinchilla. The New England Highway, Gore Highway and the Warrego Highway traverse the region. The Toowoomba Second Range Crossing has been constructed so that heavy traffic can avoid passing through Toowoomba. Coolmunda Dam, Leslie Dam, Cooby Dam, Perseverance Dam, Cressbrook Dam, Storm King Dam and the Glenlyon Dam are some of the major water storage facilities in the area. West of Toowoomba is the Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport.
The Darling Down is situated in the drainage basins of the Condamine River and Maranoa River and tributaries. The Condamine River flood plain is noted for its good soils formed by basaltic alluvium. On the northern boundaries of the Downs are the Bunya Mountains and the Bunya Mountains National Park. The region to the north is the South Burnett and the Maranoa lies to the west. A section of the western downs lies over coal deposits of the Surat Basin. Towards the coast, the mountains of the Scenic Rim form the headwaters of the westward flowing Condamine.

===Climate===
The majority of the Darling Downs has a humid subtropical climate although some areas experience a semi-arid or subtropical highland climate. Summer maximum temperatures range from , while winter maximums range from . The annual rainfall ranges from in the far west of the region, to in the east. In the south-east of the Darling Downs winter temperatures can drop below with heavy frost and occasional snow, while in the north-west summer temperatures can surpass . Severe thunderstorms and damaging floods are a threat at times, as are bushfires in dry years.

===Southern Downs===
Part of the Darling Downs, which includes the towns of Allora, Clifton, Warwick, Killarney and the rocky district in the south known as the Granite Belt, is known as the Southern Downs. The phrase is also used to define political boundaries and in the promotion of tourism in the area. The Dumaresq and the MacIntyre are found in this part of the region.
(This is different to the IBRA subregion also known as The Southern Downs Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia, which is further west, around the towns of Roma, Mitchell and Injune).

==Industry==
The Queensland Gas Pipeline oil pipeline and the Roma to Brisbane Pipeline, Australia&#x27;s first natural gas pipeline both cross the region from west to east. There are three coal mines, New Acland Mine, Kogan Creek Mine and Cameby Downs coal mine and a number of power stations situated on the Downs, including the Millmerran Power Station, Oakey Power Station, Darling Downs Power Station and the Kogan Creek Power Station. Tarong Power Station is building the state&#x27;s largest grid battery storage project. The Dingo Fence starts at the town of Jimbour across the country to the Great Australian Bight. Mining exploration leases cover more than 90% of the Darling Downs. The western Downs has seen a massive installation of coal seam gas wells.

After agriculture and mining and manufacturing are the next most important sectors. Manufacturing focuses on food and beverages but also the production of machinery, equipment and metal products.

===Agriculture===
The region produces around one quarter of the state&#x27;s agricultural output. Water for irrigation is mostly sourced from groundwater from alluvial aquifers. Water is also extracted from streams, off-stream reservoirs and on-farm dams. The lower temperatures of the milder summers in the Stanthorpe and Killarney regions allows farmers to grow lettuce, celery, brassicas and potato.

The Darling Downs contains the largest deposit of rich black agricultural soils in Australia. A commonly grown grass species Panicum coloratum, also known as Bambatsi, is well-suited for pastures used for grazing because it is suitable to the heavy-cracking clay soils found in the area. The eastern Downs feature a wide range of soil types.

Brothers Friedrich Wilhelm Ernst Ziesemer and Theodor Martin Peter Ziesemer were significant pioneers of large scale wheat farming on the Darling Downs.

===Meat===

The area is home to Australia&#x27;s largest concentration of feedlots. In 2010, two abattoirs at Pittsworth and Killarney owned by Dudley Leitch were closed. Several other plants in the area were also closed leaving the remaining meat processor at Yangan in high demand. By late 2012, the industry was recovering with smaller processing facilities at Crows Nest and Inglewood opening. In 2014, the Oakey Abattoir which is the fourth largest meat processing plant in Australia, launched an environmental initiative to extract green energy biogas from its waste water streams. It was the first ever use of a covered lagoon to treat effluent.

===Wine===
In the Southern Downs region surrounding Stanthorpe in an area called the Granite Belt there are now over sixty cellar doors, wineries, and vineyards. The industry first began as a table grape growing region that by the mid-1960s was starting to plant wine grape cultivars. This region has a subtropical highland climate atypical to the rest of Queensland due to its elevation. Altitudes from 680 m to over 1200 m above sea level make it ideally suited to premium wine production.

== Attractions ==

The region is popular with tourists because of its many natural and heritage attractions, including the Goomburra State Forest, Cunninghams Gap, Spicers Gap and the Queen Mary Falls near Killarney in the Main Range National Park. Lake Broadwater is the only natural lake on the tablelands.

The town of Jandowae gained fame after offering vacant blocks of land for just $1. This was done to encourage residents to settle in the small town which had less than 1,000 people in 2001.

The Cobb &amp; Co Museum has displays of horse-drawn vehicles and material on the history of the Darling Downs. The Jondaryan Woolshed is a heritage-listed shearing shed situated at a site where a tourist operator has collected numerous related structures. The region has also a small zoo, Darling Downs Zoo near Clifton.

The region has uncovered important megafauna fossil finds. The rich discoveries have lent weight to the theory that humans were not a factor in the extinction of the ancient megafauna species. Many of the fossils in the region date to the Pleistocene and include species such as Diprotodon optatum, the largest-ever marsupial. In 2021, examination of a partial skull revealed a site on the Darling Downs was the location for a new species of Tomistominae crocodile, representing the largest extinct crocodile species ever discovered in Australia.

The Darling Downs Golf Association has 21 affiliated golf clubs on the Darling Downs.

The Carnival of Flowers attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists to Toowoomba each September since 1950.

==Environment==
Before European settlement many areas on the Darling Downs were fertile wilderness. For example, around Ma Ma Creek, rich swampy wetlands provided a haven for many animal species not currently found on the downs. The Darling Downs hopping mouse and paradise parrot have both become extinct since cattle farming began.

The New Acland Mine expansion, north of Oakey, has been delayed by the largest environmental public interest court cases in Australian history.

== Awards ==
In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Darling Downs was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;location&quot;.

==In fiction==
Steele Rudd (Arthur Davis) wrote a series of comic novels on rural life, starting with &quot;On Our Selection&quot; (1899), about Dad, Mother and Dave Rudd of Snake Gully. The Rudds had four (or six) acres adjoining a sheep run in the Darling Downs. The stories were made into films and a radio series.

<doc id="1056595" wikidata="Q946859" url="?curid=1056595" title="Keenan Wynn">
<text>Francis Xavier Aloysius James Jeremiah Keenan Wynn (July 27, 1916 – October 14, 1986) was an American character actor. His expressive face was his ; though he rarely carried the lead role, he had prominent billing in most of his film and television roles.

==Early life==
Wynn was born on July 27, 1916, in New York City, the son of vaudeville comedian Ed Wynn and his wife, the former Hilda Keenan. He took his stage name from his maternal grandfather, Frank Keenan, one of the first Broadway actors to star in Hollywood. His father was Jewish and his mother was of Irish Catholic background. Ed Wynn encouraged his son to become an actor, and to join The Lambs Club, which he did in 1937.

==Career==
===Theatre and radio===
Wynn began his career as a stage actor. He appeared in several plays on Broadway, including &quot;Remember the Day&quot; (1935), &quot;Black Widow&quot; (1936), &quot;Hitch Your Wagon&quot; (1937), &quot;The Star Wagon&quot; (1938), &quot;One for the Money&quot; (1939), &quot;Two for the Show&quot; (1940), and &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1941).

Wynn starred in the radio show &quot;The Amazing Mr. Smith&quot; on Mutual Broadcasting System April 7 – June 30, 1941. He played the title role, &quot;a carefree young man who runs into trouble galore and becomes an involuntary detective&quot;.

===Film and television===
Wynn appeared in hundreds of films and television series between 1934 and 1986. He was a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract player during the 1940s and 1950s. He had a brief role as a belligerent, unsympathetic drunk in the wartime romance &quot;The Clock&quot; (1945). Arguably his most dynamic performance was a small role in &quot;The Hucksters&quot; (1948) with Clark Gable. His early postwar credits include &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1948), playing D&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s servant; &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1950); &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; (1951); &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; (1953); &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot; (1956); &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; (1961); &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964) and &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964).

The Wynns, father and son, both appeared in the original 1956 &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; television production of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;. The son was returning the favor: according to radio historian Elizabeth McLeod, Keenan had helped his father overcome professional collapse, a harrowing divorce, and a nervous breakdown to return to work a decade earlier, and now helped convince Serling and producer Martin Manulis that the elder Wynn should play the wistful trainer. Both he and his father also appeared in a subsequent TV drama called &quot;The Man in the Funny Suit&quot; (1960), which detailed the problems they had experienced while working on that series. In it, the Wynns, Serling, and many of the cast and crew played themselves. Keenan also featured in another Rod Serling production, a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode entitled, &quot;A World of His Own&quot; (1960) as playwright Gregory West, who uniquely caused series creator Rod Serling to disappear.

On January 18, 1959, Wynn starred in S. J. Perelman&#x27;s Hollywood satire, &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot;, broadcast on NBC&#x27;s prestigious Sunday afternoon anthology series &quot;Omnibus&quot;.

Wynn took a dramatic turn as Yost in the crime drama &quot;Point Blank&quot; (1967) with Lee Marvin. He had a leading role in the third &quot;Beach Party&quot; movie, &quot;Bikini Beach&quot; (1964) as a scheming newspaper publisher who wants to banish the local young people. Later he played Hezakiah in the comedy film &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965). He was the voice of the Winter Warlock in &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot; (1970) and appeared in several Disney films, including &quot;Snowball Express&quot; (1972), &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Shaggy D.A.&quot; (1976) (as a villain who learns Wilbur Daniels&#x27;s secret and uses it against him). He appeared as villainous businessman Alonzo Hawk in three Disney films – &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot;, &quot;Son of Flubber&quot;, and &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot;.

He appeared in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s musical &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1968), Sergio Leone&#x27;s epic western &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (also 1968), and Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975). During this time, his guest television roles included &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; (1971–1972), &quot;Emergency!&quot; (1975), &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; (1978). Wynn appeared in ten episodes of TV&#x27;s &quot;Dallas&quot; during the 1979–1980 season, playing the role of former Ewing family partner-turned-enemy Digger Barnes. David Wayne, a friend of Wynn&#x27;s, had played Digger Barnes in 1978 but was unable to continue with the role because of his co-starring role on the CBS series, &quot;House Calls&quot;, starring Wayne Rogers.

Wynn was initially cast in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) to play Perry White (the boss of Clark Kent and Lois Lane at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;) in April 1977. By June (production had moved to Pinewood Studios in England), Wynn collapsed from exhaustion and was rushed to a hospital. He was replaced by Jackie Cooper. 

He played Charles Picker Dobbs on a 1982 episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In 1983, he guest-starred in one of the last episodes of &quot;Taxi&quot; and &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; In 1984, he starred in the television film &quot;Call to Glory&quot;, which later became a weekly television series.

==Personal life and last years==

Wynn was married to former stage actress Eve Lynn Abbott (1914–2004) until their divorce in 1947, whereupon Abbott married actor Van Johnson, one of the couple&#x27;s closest friends. Abbott contended her marriage to Wynn was a happy one, but that her divorce and remarriage were engineered by MGM studio boss Louis B. Mayer, who refused to renew Wynn&#x27;s contract unless Abbott divorced him and married Johnson, who was the subject of rumors that he was homosexual. One son, actor and writer Ned Wynn (born Edmond Keenan Wynn), wrote the autobiographical memoir &quot;We Will Always Live In Beverly Hills&quot;. His other son, Tracy Keenan Wynn, is a screenwriter whose credits include &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; and &quot;The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman&quot; (both 1974). His daughter Hilda was married to Paul Williams. He was an uncle by marriage to the Hudson Brothers. His granddaughter is actress Jessica Keenan Wynn.

In his later years, Wynn undertook a number of philanthropic endeavors and supported several charity groups. He was a long-standing active member of the Westwood Sertoma service club, in West Los Angeles.

===Death===
During his last years, Wynn suffered from pancreatic cancer, which caused his death on October 14, 1986. His ashes are interred in Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park in The Great Mausoleum, Daffodil Corridor, Columbarium of the Dawn, in a niche alongside his father Ed Wynn, his daughter Emily (February 13, 1960 – November 27, 1980), who died from lupus, and his aunt.

===D-STAR===
The D-STAR open radio system was developed by Icom based on digital radio protocols developed by the Japan Amateur Radio League and funded by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. This system is designed to provide advanced voice and data communications over amateur radio using open standards.

==Products==

Icom manufactures two way radios and receivers for use in marine applications, Airband, amateur radio applications, land mobile applications, and FRS / GMRS applications. Some radios made by Icom are compatible with Motorola and SmarTrunk trunking systems.

== IC-V82 ==
The Icom IC-V82 is a VHF handheld transceiver with coverage in the two-meter band (144–146 MHz) and a maximum output power of 7 watts. It was manufactured and sold by Icom from 2004 to 2014.
Following its discontinuation, Icom issued an advisory warning about counterfeit radios, including the IC-V82. In October 2018, the company issued a cease-and-desist order against a Chinese manufacturer suspected of producing counterfeit Icom products; it also noted that this was not the first time it had taken such steps.

In June 2022, United Against Nuclear Iran, a U.S. advocacy organization, identified the Icom IC-V82 as being used by Hezbollah, a U.S. designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. It sent a letter to Icom outlining its concerns about the radios&#x27; dual-use capability (analog+digital) and regarding Icom&#x27;s business ties to Power Group (Icom&#x27;s representatives in Lebanon) and Faza Gostrar, which claims to be the &quot;Official ICOM representative in Iran&quot;.

Many of the devices purchased by Hezbollah that subsequently exploded in the 2024 Lebanon radio device explosions, killing at least 25 people and wounding over 708, were reported as being IC-V82s. Icom opened an investigation into the case on 19 September 2024, while a sales executive at the company&#x27;s U.S. subsidiary said the radios involved appeared to be counterfeit units.

<text>The Paris Review is a quarterly English-language literary magazine established in Paris in 1953 by Harold L. Humes, Peter Matthiessen, and George Plimpton. In its first five years, &quot;The Paris Review&quot; published new works by Jack Kerouac, Philip Larkin, V. S. Naipaul, Philip Roth, Terry Southern, Adrienne Rich, Italo Calvino, Samuel Beckett, Nadine Gordimer, Jean Genet, and Robert Bly.

The &quot;Review&quot;″s &quot;Writers at Work&quot; series includes interviews with Ezra Pound, Ernest Hemingway, T. S. Eliot, Jorge Luis Borges, Ralph Ellison, William Faulkner, Thornton Wilder, Robert Frost, Pablo Neruda, William Carlos Williams, and Vladimir Nabokov, among hundreds of others. Literary critic Joe David Bellamy wrote that the series was &quot;one of the single most persistent acts of cultural conservation in the history of the world.&quot;

The headquarters of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; moved from Paris to New York City in 1973. Plimpton edited the &quot;Review&quot; from its founding until his death in 2003.

==History==
===20th century===
An editorial statement by William Styron in the inaugural Spring 1953 issue described the magazine&#x27;s intended aim:

&quot;The Paris Review&quot; hopes to emphasize creative work—fiction and poetry—not to the exclusion of criticism, but with the aim in mind of merely removing criticism from the dominating place it holds in most literary magazines. […] I think &quot;The Paris Review&quot; should welcome these people into its pages: the good writers and good poets, the non-drumbeaters and non-axe-grinders. So long as they&#x27;re good.

The &quot;Review&quot;″s founding editors include Humes, Matthiessen, Plimpton, William Pène du Bois, Thomas Guinzburg and John P. C. Train. The first publisher was Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan. Du Bois, the magazine&#x27;s first art editor, designed the iconic &quot;Paris Review&quot; eagle to include both American and French significance: an American eagle holding a pen and wearing a Phrygian cap.

The magazine&#x27;s first office was located in a small room of the publishing house Éditions de la Table ronde. Other notable locations of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; include a Thames River grain carrier anchored on the Seine from 1956 to 1957. The Café de Tournon in the Rue de Tournon on the Rive Gauche was the meeting place for staffers and writers, including du Bois, Plimpton, Matthiessen, Alexander Trocchi, Christopher Logue, and Eugene Walter.

The first floor and basement rooms in Plimpton&#x27;s 72nd Street apartment became the headquarters of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; when the magazine moved from Paris to New York City in 1973. The magazine&#x27;s circulation was 9,700 in 1989.

===21st century===
Brigid Hughes took over as editor following Plimpton&#x27;s death in 2003; her last issue was March 2005. She was succeeded by Philip Gourevitch in spring 2005. 

In January 2007, an article published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; supported the claim that founding editor Matthiessen was in the Central Intelligence Agency, but reported that the magazine was used as a cover, rather than a collaborator, for his spying activities. In a May 27, 2008 interview with Charlie Rose, Matthiessen stated that he &quot;invented &quot;The Paris Review&quot; as cover&quot; for his CIA activities. Matthiessen maintained that the &quot;Review&quot; was not part of the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), an organization used by the CIA to sponsor an array of literary magazines; but the record shows &quot;The Paris Review&quot; benefited financially from selling article reprints to CCF magazines.

Under Gourevitch&#x27;s leadership, the &quot;Review&quot; began incorporating more nonfiction pieces and, for the first time, began regularly publishing a photography spread. A four-volume set of &quot;Paris Review&quot; interviews was published by Picador from 2006 to 2009. Gourevitch announced his departure in the fall of 2009, citing a desire to concentrate more fully on his creative writing.

Lorin Stein was named editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; in April 2010. He oversaw a redesign of the magazine&#x27;s print edition and its website, both of which were met with critical acclaim. In September 2010, the &quot;Review&quot; made available online its entire archive of interviews. On December 6, 2017, Stein resigned amid an internal investigation into his sexual misconduct toward women at the workplace.

In October 2012, &quot;The Paris Review&quot; published an anthology, &quot;Object Lessons,&quot; comprising a selection of 20 short stories from &quot;The Paris Review&quot;&#x27;s archive, each with an introduction by a contemporary author. Contributors include Jeffrey Eugenides (with an introduction to a story by Denis Johnson), Lydia Davis (with an introduction to a story by Jane Bowles), and Ali Smith (with an introduction to a story by Lydia Davis).

On October 8, 2012, the magazine launched its app for the iPad and iPhone. Developed by Atavist, the app includes access to new issues, back issues, and archival collections from its fiction and poetry sections—along with the complete interview series and the Paris Review Daily.

In November 2015, &quot;The Paris Review&quot; published its first anthology of new writing since 1964, &quot;The Unprofessionals: New American Writing from The Paris Review,&quot; including writing by well-established authors like Zadie Smith, Ben Lerner, and John Jeremiah Sullivan, as well as emerging writers like Emma Cline, Ottessa Moshfegh, Alexandra Kleeman, and Angela Flournoy.

In late 2021, for the first issue with Stokes as editor-in-chief and Na Kim as art director, the journal was given a redesign by Matt Willey of Pentagram that hearkened back to the look that it had in the late 1960s and early 1970s: a minimalist style, a cover with a sans serif font and a great deal of white space, a smaller trim size, and paper that was physically softer.

==Emerging writers ==

The &quot;Review&quot; has published several emerging writers who have gone to notable careers, including Adrienne Rich, V.S. Naipaul, Philip Roth, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Mona Simpson, Edward P. Jones, and Rick Moody. Selections from Samuel Beckett&#x27;s novel &quot;Molloy&quot; appeared in the fifth issue. The magazine was also among the first to recognize the work of Jack Kerouac with the publication of his short story, &quot;The Mexican Girl&quot;, in 1955. Other works making their first appearance in &quot;The Paris Review&quot; include Italo Calvino&#x27;s &quot;Last Comes the Raven&quot;, Philip Roth&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye Columbus&quot;, Donald Barthelme&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot;, Jim Carroll&#x27;s &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;, Matthiessen&#x27;s &quot;Far Tortuga&quot;, Jeffrey Eugenides&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, and Jonathan Franzen&#x27;s &quot;The Corrections&quot;.

Aisha Sabatini Sloan is an emerging writer with a monthly column, &quot;Detroit Archives&quot;. The series explores her family history through iconic landmarks in Detroit.

==Interviews==
An interview with E. M. Forster, an acquaintance of Plimpton&#x27;s from his days at Kings College at the University of Cambridge, was the first in a long series of author interviews, now known as the &quot;Writers at Work&quot; series.

==Prints and posters==
In 1964, &quot;The Paris Review&quot; initiated a series of prints and posters by contemporary artists with the goal of establishing an ongoing relationship between the worlds of writing and art—Drue Heinz, then publisher of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, shared credit with Jane Wilson for initiating the series. In the half century since its inception, the series has featured notable New York artists of the postwar decades, including Louise Bourgeois, Willem de Kooning, David Hockney, Helen Frankenthaler, Keith Haring, Robert Indiana, Jimmy Ernst, Alex Katz, Ellsworth Kelly, Sol LeWitt, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Motherwell, Louise Nevelson, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers, James Rosenquist, Ed Ruscha and Andy Warhol.

The series, suspended after George Plimpton&#x27;s death in 2003, was relaunched in 2012 with a print by Donald Baechler.

==Prizes==
Three prizes are awarded annually by the editors of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;: the &quot;Paris Review Hadada&quot;, the &quot;Plimpton Prize&quot;, and the &quot;Terry Southern Prize for Humor&quot;. Winning selections are celebrated at the annual Spring Revel. No application form is required. Instead, winners are selected from the stories and poems published the previous year in &quot;The Paris Review&quot;.

*The &quot;Paris Review Hadada&quot;: a bronze statuette to be &quot;awarded annually to a distinguished member of the literary community who has demonstrated a strong and unique commitment to literature&quot;. The award may go to a writer, reader, editor, publisher, publication, or organization. Past winners include Jamaica Kincaid, John Ashbery, Joan Didion, Norman Mailer, Peter Matthiessen, George Plimpton, Barney Rosset, William Styron, Philip Roth, James Salter, Paula Fox, Frederick Seidel, Norman Rush, Errol Morris, Edward Hirsch, Joy Williams, and Fran Lebowitz.
* The &quot;Plimpton Prize&quot;: $10,000 (and an engraved ostrich egg) awarded for the best work of fiction or poetry by an emerging or previously unpublished writer. Recent winners include Caitlin Horrocks, Wells Tower, Alistair Morgan, Jesse Ball, Emma Cline, and Benjamin Percy.
* The &quot;Terry Southern Prize for Humor&quot;: a $5,000 award honoring work from either &quot;The Paris Review&quot; or &quot;The Paris Review Daily&quot; that embodies the qualities of humor, wit, and sprezzatura. The prize is given in memory of longtime contributor Terry Southern.

==Spring Revel==
The &quot;Paris Review&quot; Spring Revel is an annual gala held in celebration of American writers and writing. The Revel &quot;brings together leading figures and patrons of American arts and letters from throughout New York to pay tribute to distinguished writers at different stages of their careers&quot;. Proceeds from the Spring Revel go directly toward The Paris Review Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization established by the co-founders in 2000 to ensure the future of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;.

The 2010 Spring Revel took place on April 13, 2010 and presented Philip Roth with the Hadada.

The 2011 Spring Revel took place on April 12, 2011, chaired by Yves-André Istel and Kathleen Begala. Robert Redford presented the Hadada to James Salter. The 2011 Revel also featured Ann Beattie presenting the Plimpton Prize for Fiction and Fran Lebowitz presenting the inaugural Terry Southern Prize for Humor. In 2012, Robert Silvers received the Hadada. In 2013, it was Paula Fox. In 2014, Frederick Seidel received the prize. In 2015, it was Norman Rush. In 2016, Errol Morris presented Lydia Davis with the Hadada and 2017 Edward Hirsch presented Richard Howard with the Hadada. In 2018, Joy Williams received the prize from John Waters. Fran Lebowitz presented Deborah Eisenberg with the Hadada in 2019.

<text>The Burnett River is a river in the Wide Bay–Burnett and Central Queensland regions of Queensland, Australia.

==Course and features==
The Burnett River rises in the Burnett Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, close to Mount Gaeta and east of Monto. It drains a basin covering 33,210 km² which is 1.9% of the total area of Queensland.

The river flows generally south past Eidsvold and Mundubbera before heading east, adjacent to the townships of Gayndah and Wallaville before entering the city of Bundaberg. The river flows into the Coral Sea at Burnett Heads, roughly from Bundaberg. The river descends over its course.

The Burnett River region is largely given over to growing sugar cane and small crops. The river is part of the Brigalow Belt and South East Queensland bioregions.

===Major tributaries===
====Three Moon Creek====
Three Moon Creek rises near Kroombit Tops National Park north of Monto and flows south through Monto and Mulgildie, it is dammed near Cania Gorge to form Lake Cania, before emptying into the Burnett River south-east of Abercorn.

====Nogo River====
The Nogo River rises in the hills north-west of Monto, is dammed west of Abercorn to form Wuruma Lake, and flows south-east to join the Burnett near Ceratodus.

====Auburn River====
The Auburn River rises in the hills about west of Cracow, flows south before swinging to the north-east at its confluence with Johnson Creek, passing through the Auburn River National Park, a little-known and untouched piece of pristine bush including Auburn Waterfall, and flows into the Burnett River west of Mundubbera.

====Boyne River====
The Boyne River rises in the Bunya Mountains National Park south-west of Kingaroy and flows in a general northerly direction, it is dammed near Proston to form Lake Boondooma, emptying into the Burnett River near Mundubbera, only from the Burnett River-Auburn River confluence.

====Barambah Creek====
Barambah Creek rises in the hills between Kingaroy and the Sunshine Coast, north of Jimna and flows in a generally northerly direction, it flows just below the dam wall of Lake Barambah, also known as Bjelke-Petersen Dam, before meeting the Burnett River north-east of Gayndah near Ban Ban Springs.

==History==

===Prehistory===

The Burnett River area was historically inhabited by the Taribelang Aboriginal tribe.

===European exploration===
The river is named after James Charles Burnett, the first European explorer to visit the river in 1847.

===Dam construction===
Construction of the Paradise Dam on the Burnett River, upstream from Bundaberg, was completed in November 2005. The dam reservoir has a capacity of . Named after the old gold mining township of Paradise, which is now submerged under the waters of the reservoir, all of the structures and artefacts found at the site were transferred to the nearby town of Biggenden. The design of the dam complies with environmental guidelines and includes a fish ladder that allows fish such as the Queensland lungfish to travel upstream as well as downstream from the dam wall.

Paradise Dam was damaged in 2013 floods, and currently operates at reduced capacity. In early 2024, the Qld government announced it would be replaced by a new Paradise Dam rather than attempting further repairs.

==Fish==
The Burnett River, together with the nearby Mary River, is home to the Queensland lungfish, one of the most ancient of the extant vertebrate species. The longest-lived known individual known for the Queensland lungfish, a male nicknamed &quot;Granddad&quot;, was born and captured in the Burnett River before being transported to the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Illinois in 1933, where he lived to the estimated age of 109 years old before he died of natural causes in 2017.

<doc id="1056624" wikidata="Q158356" url="?curid=1056624" title="Diospyros virginiana">
<text>Diospyros virginiana is a persimmon species commonly called the American persimmon, common persimmon, eastern persimmon, simmon, possumwood, possum apples, or sugar plum. It ranges from southern Connecticut to Florida, and west to Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. The tree grows in the wild but has been cultivated for its fruit and wood since prehistoric times by Native Americans.

&quot;Diospyros virginiana&quot; grows to , in well-drained soil. The tree is typically dioecious, so one must have both male and female plants to obtain fruit. Most cultivars are parthenocarpic (setting seedless fruit without pollination). The fragrant flowers are pollinated by insects and wind. Fruiting typically begins when the tree is about 6 years old.

The fruit is round or oval and usually orange-yellow, sometimes bluish, and from in diameter. Both the tree and the fruit are referred to as persimmons, with the latter appearing in desserts and cuisine in the U.S. South and Midwest.

Commercial varieties include the very productive Early Golden, the productive John Rick, Miller, Woolbright and the Ennis, a seedless variety. Another nickname of the American persimmon, &#x27;date-plum&#x27; also refers to a persimmon species found in South Asia and South Europe, &quot;Diospyros lotus&quot;. Today, persimmons are also grown on small farms as a heritage crop.

==Description==

The common persimmon is a generally small to medium sized tree, usually in height, but reaching west of the southern Mississippi. It has a short, slender trunk and spreading, often pendulous branches, which form a broad or narrow, round-topped canopy. The roots are thick, fleshy and stoloniferous. The species has a shrubby growth form.
The plant has oval entire leaves, and unisexual flowers on short stalks. In the male flowers, which are numerous, the stamens are sixteen in number and arranged in pairs; the female flowers are solitary, with traces of stamens, and a smooth ovary with one ovule in each of the eight cells—the ovary is surmounted by four styles, which are hairy at the base. The fruit-stalk is very short, bearing a subglobose fruit an inch in diameter or a bit larger, of an orange-yellow color, ranging to bluish, and with a sweetish astringent pulp. It is surrounded at the base by the persistent calyx-lobes, which increase in size as the fruit ripens. The astringency renders the fruit somewhat unpalatable, but after it has been subjected to the action of frost, or has become partially rotted or &quot;bletted&quot; like a medlar, its flavor is improved.
* Bark: Dark brown or dark gray, deeply divided into plates whose surface is scaly. Branchlets slender, zigzag, with thick pith or large pith cavity; at first light reddish brown and pubescent. They vary in color from light brown to ashy gray and finally become reddish brown, the bark somewhat broken by longitudinal fissures. Astringent and bitter.
* Wood: Very dark; sapwood yellowish white; heavy, hard, strong and very close grained. Specific gravity, 0.7908; weight of cubic foot, . The heartwood is a true ebony. Forestry texts indicate that about a century of growth is required before a tree will produce a commercially viable yield of ebony wood. The termite resistance of the wood is attributed to the component 7-methlyjuglone.
* Winter buds: Ovate, acute, one-eighth of an inch long, covered with thick reddish or purple scales. These scales are sometimes persistent at the base of the branchlets.
* Leaves: Alternate, simple, four to six inches (152 mm) long, oval, narrowed or rounded or cordate at base, entire, acute or acuminate. They come out of the bud revolute, thin, pale, reddish green, downy with ciliate margins, when full grown are thick, dark green, shining above, pale and often pubescent beneath. In autumn they sometimes turn orange or scarlet, sometimes fall without change of color. Midrib broad and flat, primary veins opposite and conspicuous. Petioles stout, pubescent, one-half to an inch in length.
* Flowers: May, June, when leaves are half-grown; dioecious or rarely polygamous. Staminate flowers borne in two to three-flowered cymes; the pedicels downy and bearing two minute bracts. Pistillate flowers solitary, usually on separate trees, their pedicels short, recurved, and bearing two bractlets.
* Calyx: Usually four-lobed, accrescent under the fruit.
* Corolla: Greenish yellow or creamy white, tubular, four-lobed; lobes imbricate in bud.
* Stamens: Sixteen, inserted on the corolla, in staminate flowers in two rows. Filaments short, slender, slightly hairy; anthers oblong, introrse, two-celled, cells opening longitudinally. In pistillate flowers the stamens are eight with aborted anthers, rarely these stamens are perfect.
* Pistil: Ovary superior, conical, ultimately eight-celled; styles four, slender, spreading; stigma two-lobed.
* Fruit: A juicy berry containing one to eight seeds, crowned with the remnants of the style and seated in the enlarged calyx; depressed-globular, pale orange color, often red-cheeked; with slight bloom, turning yellowish brown after freezing. Flesh astringent while green, sweet and luscious when ripe.

== Ploidy ==
There are two races of American persimmon: the tetraploid (60-chromosome) race is centered in the southern Appalachian region, while the hexaploid (90-chromosome) race generally occupies a range north and west of the tetraploid range. The boundary between these races has not been well defined except in Kentucky, where hexaploid persimmons were in the majority in Bullitt County but were not present in Barren County to its south nor Franklin County to its east.

It has been observed that the tetraploid trees tend to grow much taller than the hexaploid trees and have smaller fruit, but no formal research has been done into these differences of traits.

The vast majority of named American Persimmon cultivars are hexaploid, with the only known tetraploid cultivars being Ennis Seedless, Weeping, Sugar Bear, and SFES.

== Distribution ==
The tree is very common in the South Atlantic and Gulf states, and attains its largest size in the basin of the Mississippi River. Its habitat is southern, at the turn of the 20th century it appeared along the coast from Connecticut to Florida; west of the Alleghenies it is found in southern Ohio and along through southeastern Iowa and southern Missouri; and in Louisiana, eastern Kansas and Oklahoma, where it grew tallest.

Its fossil remains have been found in Miocene rocks of Greenland and Alaska and in Cretaceous formations in Nebraska.

&quot;Diospyros virginiana&quot; is considered to be an evolutionary anachronism that was consumed by one or more of the Pleistocene megafauna that roamed the North American continent until 10,000 years ago. A 2015 study found that passage of persimmon seeds through the gut of modern elephants increased the rate of seed germination and decreased time to sprouting, which supports the idea that Pleistocene members of the elephant family were the ghost partner who accomplished seed dispersal prior to extinction of the North American members of the elephant family.

== Cultivation ==
The American persimmon mostly grows wild. Experimental research stations in the 1890s tested native varieties of persimmon, but interest in cultivation of the native persimmon has been limited. Newly planted persimmon trees take a relatively long time to bear fruit. There are many sorts of fruit trees that are easier to grow for commercial purposes. Wild varieties contain a lot of seeds, making the processing of fruit pulp used in food and beverage manufacture more difficult. Cultivation has reduced the number of seeds, and some varieties have developed a very sweet flavor profile without the dreaded astringency of wild persimmon. Harvested fruits are shelf durable.

The tree prefers light, sandy, well-drained soil, but will grow in rich southern bottom lands.

The tree is greatly inclined to vary in the character and quality of its fruit, which varies in size from that of a large cherry to a small apple. Some trees in the south produce fruit that is delicious without the action of the frost, while adjoining trees produce fruit that never becomes edible.

It was brought to England before 1629 and is cultivated, but rarely if ever ripens its fruit. It is easily raised from seed and can also be propagated from stolons, which are often produced in great quantity. The tree is hardy in the south of England and in the Channel Islands.

The persimmon rarely develops any heartwood until it is nearly one hundred years old.

===Varieties===

* Killen
* Claypool
* I-115
* Dollywood
* 100-42
* 100-43
* 100-45

* C-100
==Uses==
The fruit is high in vitamin C, and extremely astringent when unripe. It is eaten by birds, raccoons, skunks, white-tailed deer, semi-wild hogs, flying squirrels, and opossums.

The ripe fruit may be eaten raw by humans, typically once bletted, or it can be cooked or dried. The fruit pulp can be made into pie, pudding, jam, molasses, and candy. An herbal tea that can be made from the leaves and the roasted seed is used as a coffee substitute. 

The fruit is also fermented with hops, cornmeal or wheat bran into a sort of beer or made into brandy. 

The wood is heavy, strong and very close-grained and used in woodturning. Its heartwood, which may take a century before being produced, is a true ebony, extremely close-grained and almost black; it is not harvested commercially. 

The seeds were used as buttons during the privation of the American Civil War in the South.

<text>Steven Appleby (born 27 January 1956) is an absurdist cartoonist, illustrator and artist living in Britain. She is a dual citizen of the UK and Canada. Her publisher describes her humour as &quot;observational or absurd, with a keen sense of the turmoil of fear and obsession that teems beneath the respectable exterior of most of us.&quot;

Her work first appeared in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; in 1984 with the &quot;Rockets Passing Overhead&quot; comic strip about the character Captain Star, which also appeared in &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;Zeit Magazin&quot; (Germany), as well as other newspapers and comics in the UK, Europe and America. Other comic strips followed in many publications including &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Appleby’s work has also appeared on album covers, most notably &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; by the Pixies.

Her comic strip &quot;Steven Appleby&#x27;s Normal Life&quot; was translated into German and published in &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, and also made into a radio series for BBC Radio 4. An earlier comic strip, &quot;Small Birds Singing&quot;, ran for eight years in &quot;The Times&quot;.

Appleby has also had numerous exhibitions of drawings &amp; paintings, written and drawn many books, and collaborated on a musical play, &quot;Crocs In Frocks&quot;.

==Early life==

The oldest of four children, Steven Appleby was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1956 and grew up in Wooler, near the Scottish border.

Appleby recalls a childhood spent making camps, climbing trees, and hoisting flags outdoors, and reading books such as Arthur Ransome’s &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot;. The worlds of cartoonists such as Ronald Searle (&quot;St Trinian’s&quot;) and Charles Addams (&quot;The Addams Family&quot;), found on her parents’ bookshelves, also made an impression on her as a child.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Appleby describes her mother, Ibbie, as coming ‘... from Canada, a distant land of snow and french toast, far away across the sea, where she skated and skied in the day and danced to big bands by night.’ Towards the end of the Second World War, having fallen in love with Steven’s father, Walter, she came to Britain on a convoy. ‘She travelled alone to live with my father’s family in a tiny village on the coast of north Northumberland while he was still away flying planes in Burma. Together, after the war, they bred boxer dogs, performed with the village amateur dramatic society and laughed at &quot;The Goon Show&quot; on the wireless.’

Appleby attended Wooler Church of England Primary School, where she won prizes for Plasticine modelling until, aged eleven, she was sent to Bootham School, York, as a boarder, where she pursued her interests in music and art. She played keyboards in school bands and, inspired by &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, wrote and performed (with Nick Battey) Inwards &amp; Outwards, a rock cantata.

After school, in 1974, she took a foundation course in art &amp; design at Manchester Polytechnic, followed by one term on the BA graphic design course (with Malcolm Garrett and Peter Saville) after which she dropped out to play with school friends in a band called Ploog, which was influenced by prog rock and complicated pop that she has described as ‘far beyond their playing capabilities.’ In 1977 Appleby returned to art education. She studied graphic design at Newcastle Polytechnic (1978–1981), then illustration at the Royal College of Art (1981–1984), where her tutor was Quentin Blake. She has lived in London since 1981.

==Career==
While at the RCA, Appleby met writer George Mole. The two collaborated on a number of projects, including their first book, &quot;No, Honestly, I Couldn’t Eat Another Mouthful&quot; (1984), various cartoon spreads for &quot;Punch&quot; (&quot;Daily Life On Other Planets&quot;, &quot;Lost Cars&quot;), &quot;The Observer&quot; (&quot;Home Economics in the Nineties&quot;), &quot;The Oldie&quot;, and a further three books.

Beginning while she was at the RCA, Appleby worked for her friend and fellow Manchester art school alumnus Malcolm Garrett, who had been commissioned by editor Kasper de Graaf to design a monthly music, art and fashion magazine (&quot;New Sounds New Styles&quot;). After graduation, Appleby continued to assist Garrett at his company &quot;Assorted Images&quot;; she worked on book design (&quot;When Cameras Go Crazy&quot;, &quot;More Dark Than Shark&quot;), and record sleeves, particularly for Duran Duran. His work on designs for Duran Duran merchandising gave Appleby ideas which would eventually feed into the world of &quot;Captain Star&quot;, when she was invited by the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; to submit an idea for a cartoon strip.

Appleby gave up commercial design to concentrate on her own art and creative work in late 1986. Garrett and de Graaf, business partners in &quot;Assorted Images&quot;, continued to employ her, providing her with a studio and use of the Assorted Images facilities while she developed her own work. A three-year period of patronage followed, allowing Appleby the freedom to make drawings and paintings for various exhibitions. During this time, she developed &quot;Rockets Passing Overhead – the Annals of Captain Star&quot; for &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, as well as creating drawings for &quot;Punch&quot; and many other magazines. She was also able to create &quot;Small Birds Singing&quot; for &quot;The Times&quot; and to write, design and draw the comic book &quot;Rockets – A Way of Life by Captain J. Star&quot;, which was published by &quot;Assorted Images&quot; in 1988.
In 1987, animator and commercials director Pete Bishop approached Appleby, suggesting they work together. Their meeting led to various &quot;Captain Star&quot; short animations, a series of TV commercials and the development of the &quot;Captain Star&quot; TV series (with Frank Cottrell-Boyce). The pilot, written by Cottrell-Boyce, was made in the Assorted Images building. &quot;Captain Star&quot; (featuring the voices of Adrian Edmondson, Richard E. Grant, Denica Fairman, Gary Martin and Kerry Shale) aired on CITV in the UK in 1997 and was seen on various networks throughout the world, including Teletoon (Canada), YLE (Finland), Canal+ (France), ZDF (Germany) and Nickelodeon. One series of 13 episodes was made.

In 1989, Appleby left her employment at Assorted Images to establish her own studio. Kasper de Graaf continued acting as her agent until 2005.

Appleby has created cartoon strips for publications including &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The New Musical Express&quot;, &quot;The Daily Express&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;. She has also written and drawn over 24 books, including &quot;Men – The Truth&quot;, &quot;Jim – the Nine Lives Of A Dysfunctional Cat&quot; and &quot;Steven Appleby’s Guide To Life – the Complete Guardian Loomus Cartoons&quot;, and &quot;The Captain Star Omnibus&quot;. In 1994 her book of cartoon strips from &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, &quot;Die Memoiren von Captain J. Star&quot;, won the Max &amp; Moritz Prize in Germany.

Her other works include the musical play &quot;Crocs In Frocks&quot; (with Teresa Early &amp; Roger Gosling), performed by theatre company New Peckham Varieties at The Magic Eye Theatre, Peckham and at the ICA, London (2006); and the radio series, &quot;Steven Appleby’s Normal Life&quot;, which ran for two series and a Christmas special on BBC Radio 4 from 2001 to 2004.

Since 2007 Appleby has collaborated with Linda McCarthy (of Tiny Elephants Ltd) on a series of stop motion animated films based on her eccentric country house cartoon strip &quot;Small Birds Singing&quot;. A new &quot;Small Birds Singing&quot; short film, &quot;Bob Bobbin and the Christmas Stocking&quot;, is currently in production. They also collaborated, in 2011, on a looped gallery piece entitled &quot;A Small Repetition of Myself&quot; in which a puppet Steven Appleby thinks, draws, discards, then starts over – forever.

Appleby has had numerous solo exhibitions of paintings, prints and ceramics, including Islands (2011) at The Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh and Tell Me All Your Secrets And I Will Put Them In My Drawings (2005), Icebergs (2008) and REAL | UNREAL (2016) at ArteArtesania, Soller, Mallorca.

Appleby spent 2013 as the artist appointed to create all the art for the Royal Brompton Hospital’s new Centre for Sleep As part of this project she made approximately seventy drawings and paintings, including a large glass screen, ‘sleep maps’ painted directly onto the walls, and a book, &quot;Into Sleep&quot;, to celebrate the completion of the work. She is currently working on a new sleep commission for the hospital.

Her images of rockets feature on the Pixies album sleeve, &quot;Trompe Le Monde&quot;, and in 2014 she produced over 100 drawings for &quot;The Good Inn&quot;, a novel by Pixies frontman Black Francis &amp; writer Josh Frank, which was launched with events in New York and at The British Library, London.

In March 2016 Appleby was one of five artists invited to take part in a residency at The Carlton Arms Hotel, New York, where she spent a month painting a mural on the walls and in the bathroom of room 9a. Regarding the experience, she stated, &quot;I’ve never stayed anywhere as wonderful and amazing as the Carlton Arms. Every inch of every wall is a work of art. And now I can die happy because they asked me to paint a room.&quot;

==Personal life==

Appleby lives in Camberwell, south London with her wife, her partner, her two sons and three stepsons. She writes, paints and draws in The Shop, a studio she shares with animation director Pete Bishop.

In the mid-1990s, Appleby came out as a cross-dresser. In 2008, she came out as a transgender person.

In 2013, for the 60th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights, Appleby illustrated a bride marrying a hatstand. She stated to &quot;The Guardian&quot;:I am a transgender person and the right to be myself is fundamental to my existence. I also totally support the right of anyone to marry whoever they like, regardless of gender, colour, race or religion. I am very fond of hatstands but do not personally want to marry one, despite finding them attractive. In this day and age, when few people wear hats, perhaps a toaster would be a more useful companion. Or a bungalow.August Crimp, the central character in Appleby&#x27;s 2020 graphic novel &quot;Dragman&quot;, has stated, &quot;I dress as a woman, but I’m not doing drag. If anything, I’m trans…I think. I’m really just trying to be myself&quot;, and a reviewer has speculated that the plot and themes of &quot;Dragman&quot; mirror the struggles of Appleby himself.&quot;

In 2021, Appleby stated that she is &quot;relaxed about pronouns,&quot; going by both &quot;Steven&quot; &amp; &quot;he&quot; and &quot;Nancy&quot; &amp; &quot;she.&quot;

<text>Stephanie Anne &quot;Steve&quot; Chadwick (née Frizzell, born 15 December 1948) is a New Zealand politician. She served as mayor of Rotorua from 2013 to 2022. She previously held the positions of Minister of Conservation, Women&#x27;s Affairs, and Associate Health in the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand.

==Early life==
Born Stephanie Frizzell in Hastings, New Zealand, Chadwick is the sister of painter Dick Frizzell. She attended Karamu High School, then did nursing training in Wellington. She married lawyer John Te Manihera Chadwick in 1968, and the couple went on to have three children. After holding many roles in the health sector, including a term from 1976 to 1986 as union representative for the New Zealand Nurses Association, Steve Chadwick was elected to the Rotorua District Council in 1996.

==Member of Parliament==


In the 1999 election, Chadwick stood as the Labour Party candidate for the Rotorua seat, and defeated incumbent National Party MP Max Bradford. At the 2005 election she was narrowly returned to Parliament by 662 or 2.2% more votes than her opponent.

In 2006, Chadwick&#x27;s Shop Trading Hours Act Repeal (Easter Trading) Amendment Bill was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot. The bill passed its first reading and was sent to select committee, but was narrowly defeated at the second reading, 64 to 57.

In 2007, she was appointed to Cabinet as Minister of Conservation and Women&#x27;s Affairs, as well as becoming an Associate Minister of Health.

In the 2008 general election, Chadwick lost her seat to National&#x27;s Todd McClay, whose margin was over 5000. Chadwick&#x27;s loss was predicted by some commentators due to boundary changes which incorporated more rural areas into the electorate. However, due to Chadwick&#x27;s list place of 30 she was able to return to parliament.

In 2010, Chadwick attempted to introduce a bill to Parliament to partially liberalise abortion law. This bill was defeated at the caucus stage and was not brought before Parliament.

Chadwick failed to regain her seat in the 2011 election, losing to Todd McClay by a margin of more than 7,000 votes. On 27 November 2011 she announced that she would be retiring from politics.

As a cabinet minister, Chadwick was entitled to the title of The Honourable and became The Hon. Mrs Stephanie (Steve) Chadwick which is a title she was granted for the rest of her life after leaving parliament.

==Mayor of Rotorua==
Chadwick contested the Rotorua mayoralty in the local elections of that year, challenging sitting mayor Kevin Winters. Chadwick defeated Winters and three other candidates, receiving more than 11,000 votes from a total 19,596 votes cast.

At the 2016 local-body elections, Chadwick again ran for mayor, defeating six other candidates, receiving 8,990 of a total 21,408 votes cast

Chadwick&#x27;s husband, John Chadwick, died in Rotorua on 26 May 2017.

In 2020, Chadwick announced a zero percent rates increase in the Rotorua Lakes Council&#x27;s 2020/2021 annual plan to cushion the financial blow of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had severely impacted the district&#x27;s tourism industry.

Chadwick did not stand for re-election as mayor in the 2022 elections.

In the 2022 New Year Honours, Chadwick was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order, for services to local government and as a Member of Parliament.

<doc id="1056641" wikidata="Q487249" url="?curid=1056641" title="The Old Maid and the Thief">
<text>The Old Maid and the Thief is a radio opera in one act by Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti. The work uses an English language libretto by the composer which tells a twisted tale of morals and evil womanly power. Menotti writes in the libretto &quot;The devil couldn&#x27;t do what a woman can – Make a thief out of an honest man.&quot;

Commissioned by NBC, &quot;The Old Maid and the Thief&quot; was one of the earliest operas composed specifically for performance on the radio. Menotti wrote the libretto to &quot;The Old Maid and the Thief&quot; himself; initially in Italian but with the intention of having the work translated into English for its premiere. It was the first of several operas in the English language by the young composer who was just 28 years old at the time. He was inspired to write the story of the opera after visiting the family of his partner Samuel Barber. He found that what seemed to be a quaint, cute town actually covered up a plethora of secrets about people and places.

Upon the opera&#x27;s premiere in 1939, the work was received with wide enthusiasm by American music critics. The success of the opera helped further establish Menotti&#x27;s career in the United States.

Menotti later adapted the opera slightly so it could be performed on the stage; with the first theatrical production given in Philadelphia in 1941. The staged version of the work proved to be successful as well, and the opera is still occasionally mounted by professional companies. It is also a popular repertoire choice by university opera programs in the United States.

== Composition ==
Rather than using the more contemporary through-composed style, Menotti chose to return to the 18th century &quot;opera buffa&quot; method of composing set numbers, a format which worked well on the radio. There are 14 short scenes, each preceded by a narrated &quot;announcement&quot;, in keeping with the medium of radio (to be excluded if fully staged). The harmonic language is tonal and conservative. The radio announcements are included in the score, but it is also marked for stage direction.

The opera is most known for two arias. First, &quot;What curse for a woman, is a timid man (Steal me, sweet thief)&quot;, is a full scene, where Laetitia sings of her affection for Bob, the bum. The other popular aria is &quot;When the Air Sings of Summer&quot;, where Bob contemplates hitting the road. The arias are excerpted and available in the soprano and baritone volumes of G. Schirmer&#x27;s &quot;American Arias&quot;.

==Performance history==
&quot;The Old Maid and the Thief&quot; was premiered on NBC Radio on April 22, 1939 with Alberto Erede conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra for the closing of the orchestra&#x27;s 1938/1939 season. The opera was first staged in a slightly revised version by the Philadelphia Opera Company at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia on February 11, 1941, in a double bill with the United States premiere of Emil von Reznicek&#x27;s &quot;Spiel oder Ernst?&quot;. The New York Philharmonic chose to program portions of the opera in 1942 with conductor Fritz Busch leading the ensemble. The first staged production in New York was presented by the New York City Opera in April 1948 in a double bill with &quot;Amelia Goes to the Ball&quot;, both operas directed by the composer, with Marie Powers as Miss Todd, Virginia MacWatters as Laetitia, Ellen Faull as Miss Pinkerton, and Norman Young as Bob. Other early stagings of the opera were given by the New England Opera Theater in Boston (1947), the Fort Worth Opera (1947), and the Chautauqua Opera (1951).

The opera was first staged in Europe at the National Theatre Mannheim in February 1947 using a German language translation by Maria Pinazzi. It was subsequently mounted by the Staatstheater Darmstadt (1951) and the Teatro Regio di Parma (1966) among other opera companies. More recently the opera was performed at London&#x27;s Arcola Theatre as part of the 2008 Grimeborn Festival.

This opera is popular in the United States for colleges and workshop productions due to its English libretto, untaxing roles (since it is only in one act), and high musical value. The story and humor appeal to the modern American audience.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
This one-act opera, divided into 14 scenes, is about an old maid, Miss Todd, who is a busybody in her small town. Though she is of high standing in her community, her love life has been bare for over forty years. Her housemaid Laetitia is a young, catty eavesdropper who is wary of becoming an Old Maid like her employer. Bob, a wanderer, comes to Miss Todd&#x27;s door one afternoon while the town gossip, Miss Pinkerton is visiting. Enamored of his beauty, Laetitia easily convinces Miss Todd to let him stay. Laetitia then convinces Bob to stay by promising him more food and accommodations without any cost, and Bob remains in their house, as Miss Todd&#x27;s &quot;cousin Steve&quot; to anyone who asks.

The next day, Miss Todd meets Miss Pinkerton in the street, and the latter tells her of an escaped convict who is reportedly in the area. The convict matches Bob&#x27;s description, and Miss Todd runs home to warn Laetitia that they are harboring a thief and must get rid of him. Once again, Laetitia, insinuating that Bob is in love with her, convinces Miss Todd to let him stay. To keep him from running away and revealing them as accomplices, Miss Todd leaves money out for Bob to &quot;steal&quot;. However, before long she needs more money, and resorts to stealing from her neighbors. Meanwhile, Laetitia is falling in love with the wanderer and sings &quot;Steal Me Sweet Thief,&quot; an aria of her love for him, asking him to steal her away before time ravages and withers her looks. Miss Pinkerton soon encounters Miss Todd again and warns her to &quot;Keep all the doors locked, keep all the windows closed,&quot; because the thief (in actuality, Miss Todd) is in town and has stolen from the neighbors. Miss Todd plays along, agreeing that the mysterious crimes point to the indubitable presence of a thief. At home, Bob is sick of confinement and plans to leave the next day. He sings &quot;When the Air Sings of Summer&quot; (Bob&#x27;s Bedroom Aria) as he packs his bag. Laetitia stumbles upon him as he packs and, desperate, asks him what it will take to keep him there. Bob replies he would like to &quot;have something to drink&quot;. Miss Todd, who, being a good prohibitionist, doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol in the house, insists there would be a scandal if she were to be seen buying liquor. Laetitia cleverly convinces her that, since stealing and drinking are both sinful, breaking into a liquor store (&quot;sinning against a sin&quot;) wouldn&#x27;t be problematic, and they plan to rob the store that night.

The next day, Miss Pinkerton visits Miss Todd at home and informs her that the liquor store has been violated and the owner attacked. A drunken Bob interrupts their conversation, singing loudly upstairs, prompting the shrewd Miss Pinkerton to add that the police are going to search every house to find the thief. Miss Todd shoos Miss Pinkerton out the door, and then she and Laetitia confront Bob about his true identity. They each try to convince him to run off with them, in order to evade the police, but Bob refuses to run away because he has done nothing wrong. Miss Todd incredulously asks, &quot;Is your love for me so small that you would see me in prison?&quot; to which Bob replies, &quot;Small? I don&#x27;t love you at all!&quot; Miss Todd flies into a rage, and storms out, saying she will call the police and blame all the theft on him. Glumly, Bob and Laetitia duet on whether to stay and face the charges or leave, and the persuasive Laetitia eventually wins the argument. Vindictively, they steal all of Miss Todd&#x27;s valuables, including her car, and ride off together. Miss Todd returns to find her house empty and, realizing her life is now in ruins, collapses in grief after a final frantic aria.

<text>The Baroness is a short-lived series of espionage novels by Paul Kenyon. Eight novels in the series were published from 1974 to 1975 by Pocket Books. This series of books profiles the adventures of Baroness Penelope St. John-Orsini, a voluptuous international playgirl who is also a lethal secret superspy.

==Fictional character biography==
A former &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Elle&quot; cover model, the Baroness is a &quot;long-legged beauty in her early thirties&quot; who runs a model agency as a cover for her espionage missions. Her preferred weapon is the Bernadelli VB .25 caliber.

She drinks martini cocktails, smokes the occasional joint, drives a red Porsche, throws lavish parties in her Rome mansion and enjoys fiery but casual sex with a series of handsome hunks, including suspected enemies she may well have to kill. Her jade green eyes, raven black hair and &quot;explicit cheekbones&quot; prove the perfect smokescreen. &quot;There wasn&#x27;t a line or shadow on her lovely face to show the deadly secrets that lay behind it.&quot;

== Origins ==
Born Penelope Worthington into a Philadelphia banking family, she was educated at Miss Frothingham&#x27;s Finishing School. Her father was Arthur Worthington and she sometimes recalls his wisdom with fondness. While still young, she married an older man John Stanton Marlowe, who performed &quot;mysterious errands&quot; for the US government. The marriage was short-lived. He died while piloting his own Gulfstream jet. 

She turned to modeling and while on assignment in Italy met the Baron Reynaldo St. John Orsini, a thrill-seeking playboy. It was the Baron who &quot;brought her to life again.&quot; Their three-year marriage was a whirlwind of jet-setting parties, fast cars and scuba diving. &quot;Life,” he tells her, “is keener when death is looking over your shoulder.&quot;

Following a tire blow-out on his Ferrari, the Baron died in the Monte Carlo Grand Prix. Penelope inherited his money, becoming independently wealthy, but for the second time found life a &quot;void.&quot; That is, until a government friend of her first husband recruited her. Over two years, she was trained in weaponry, close combat and martial arts, learning how to pass out under interrogation and kill a man with a hairpin.

== The books ==

Eight Baroness novels were published within the space of one year (1974–1975) by Pocket Books, all credited to Paul Kenyon, a house pseudonym used by book packager Lyle Kenyon Engel for Donald Moffitt. The book covers were illustrated by Hector Garrido. The titles were:

#&quot;The Ecstasy Connection&quot;
#&quot;Diamonds Are for Dying&quot;
#&quot;Death Is a Ruby Light&quot;
#&quot;Hard-core Murder&quot;
#&quot;Operation Doomsday&quot;
#&quot;Sonic Slave&quot;
#&quot;Flicker of Doom&quot;
#&quot;Black Gold&quot;

In 1975, Futura reprinted only the first four books in England, with different covers.

French translations were published in 1975 by Eroscope under a different series name, &quot;Penny&quot;, the nickname of the protagonist in the novels. Eroscope published all eight novels listed above and a ninth, &quot;Photo-Phobie&quot;, which was never published in English.

Due to the high volume of output in such a short period of time under the Kenyon name, speculations abound whether Kenyon was one author or if this was a pseudonym for more than one writer, a common practice of using house pseudonyms in adventure fiction at that time. Some authors have said that Paul Kenyon was indeed a &quot;house&quot; name used by a book packager Lyle Kenyon Engel, of Book Creations, Inc. However, Donald Moffitt admitted that he was the sole author of the eight published Baroness novels.

Engel contracted and paid for three more Baroness titles, but these were never published. Peter Mayer of Simon and Schuster, a division of Pocket Books, canceled the series after the three manuscripts were written. He thought that action/adventure series were not selling enough in numbers to keep it going. The unpublished titles were:

#&quot;A Black Hole to Die In&quot; by Donald Moffitt 
#&quot;Death is a Copycat&quot; by Donald Moffitt
#&quot;Quicktime Death&quot; by Robert Vardeman in 1976

== The pulp tradition ==

Published at a time when male characters such as Nick Carter-Killmaster and Mack Bolan dominated the paperback spy genre, The Baroness series distinguished itself by featuring an equally lethal and promiscuous female character.

The novels&#x27; sex scenes contain many examples of the graphically poetic pulp tradition: 
*&quot;She opened her mouth and the tongue, like a sly little animal, darted in.&quot;
*&quot;His tool grew in her hand until it was a rigid club, hot and heavy to the touch...&quot;
*&quot;The livid pipe still protruded straight out, glistening with their mingled secretions.&quot;
*&quot;She flicked it downward to the slippery underside and found it muscularly imprisoned.&quot;
*&quot;Penelope felt an electric shock travel downward through the center of her body to where she was plastered wetly to the padded barstool.&quot;
*&quot;They lay side by side like exhausted wrestlers... a single sparkling droplet trying to ooze out of his blunt tip.&quot;

<text>Pavle Jurišić Šturm KCMG (; 8 August 1848 – 13 January 1922), born Paulus Eugen Sturm, was a Serbian general of Sorbian origin, best known for commanding the Serbian 3rd Army in World War I.

==Biography==
Paulus Eugen Sturm was born on 22 August 1848. in Görlitz, Prussian Silesia, of ethnic Sorb origin. He moved with his brother to Serbia and joined the Serbian army. Šturm became one of the most important commanders in the Serbian army in World War I, especially during its first two years, the time when his 3rd army was main support either for the 2nd army during the battle of Cer (August 1914), or for the 1st army during the battle of Kolubara (November to December 1914).

He and his brother Eugene (Evgenije) graduated from the royal Prussian military academy in Breslau (Wrocław), and participated in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. They later resigned their commissions and moved to the Principality of Serbia, prior to the Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78), in order to lecture at the Serbian Military Academy in Belgrade. With the outbreak of the war, the two brothers joined the Serbian Army as volunteers. Pavle also fought in the Serbo-Bulgarian War (1885) as commander of a regiment.

He liked Serbia, and married a Serbian woman. In order to become naturalised, he changed his name into Pavle Jurišić-Šturm in 1876, &quot;Pavle&quot; being a cognate of &quot;Paulus&quot;, and Jurišić being derived from a modulated translation of the word &quot;charge&quot; (&quot;sturm&quot; in German, &quot;juriš&quot; in Serbian). He kept his German last name as an alias (&quot;Šturm&quot;).

In the Balkan Wars (1912–13) he was the General of the Drina Division, which distinguished itself at the Battle of Kumanovo after which he was promoted to the rank of general.

As commander of the Third Serbian Army, he participated in all major battles in the Serbian theater in World War I, from Cer and Kolubara, then retreated over frozen Albania, and the participation of the Serbian Army on the Salonika front. Here, his army fought in the Battle of Kajmakcalan, suffering many casualties. After this battle Sturm was replaced at the head of the Third Army by Miloš Vasić in October 1916. He was sent to Russia to assist the commander of the Serbian Volunteer Corps. In early 1917, he returned via Japan to Thessaloniki, where he was appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Crown, a job he held until the end of the war.

After years of peace that followed, Šturm stayed in Serbia and remained in its army with the rank of general. He died in 1922 at his home in Belgrade.

Šturm was decorated with Order of Order of the Karađorđe&#x27;s Star, Order of the White Eagle and Allied decorations of the Order of the Crown of Italy, Order of St. George, BelgianOrder of the Crown, the Legion of Honour and the Order of St. Michael and St. George. Possibly the most valuable was the Order of Paulovnia Flowers on the Great Cross, personally decorated by Japanese Emperor. He was also the bearer of the Order of Iron Cross, 2nd class, and the Austrian Order of Leopold.

He was considered one of the greatest commanders of First World War and one of the best commanders in Serbian war history.

<doc id="1056666" wikidata="Q66058979" url="?curid=1056666" title="Jill of the Jungle">
<text>Jill of the Jungle is a trilogy of scrolling platform games released in 1992 by Epic MegaGames. It followed the method of distribution used by Apogee Software, where the first game is freely available and promotes the purchase of the additional episodes. The three episodes are Jill of the Jungle, Jill Goes Underground, and Jill Saves the Prince. They were combined into Jill of the Jungle: The Complete Trilogy a year later.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Jill of the Jungle&quot; is a platform game. The player controls the eponymous Jill and is able to run, jump, and fire various weapons collected within each level such as a dagger or spiral blade. Each level is populated with monsters and puzzles to challenge the player. Several levels include special features that allow the player to transform Jill into other forms with special types of movement such as the flying phoenix bird, jumping frog, and swimming fish. Other levels involve switches, keys and other challenges the player must overcome to finish the level. Upon finishing a level, the player is returned to the map level. The map level itself is organized in a way that requires the player to complete certain levels before they can proceed to the next area.

The first episode features 14 levels (including an ending level), two bonus levels all linked together by a map level, and two finish levels where the player is passive. The second episode does not have a map level, and instead features 19 consecutive levels and an ending level. The third and final episode has a different style of map level, an overhead view, that is a significant departure from the first two episodes.

==Development==
Tim Sweeney was inspired to create a Nintendo-style game featuring a female protagonist as a distinguishing feature. The game started as a platforming level editor. Lacking the skills to do the art and music, he hired four people. He said it is the &quot;last game [he] designed&quot;.

&quot;Jill of the Jungle: The Complete Trilogy&quot; was released for free at GOG.com in November 2018.

==Reception==
Shortly after its release, 20 to 30 copies were sold daily.

==Legacy==
&quot;Jill of the Jungle II&quot; was in development, but was changed into an original property, titled &quot;Vinyl Goddess from Mars&quot;, which was published by Union Logic in 1995.

Other games based on the &quot;Jill of the Jungle&quot; engine include &quot;&quot; (1992).

<doc id="1056670" wikidata="Q45143" url="?curid=1056670" title="Fulminic acid">
<text>Fulminic acid is an acid with the formula HCNO, more specifically . It is an isomer of isocyanic acid () and of its elusive tautomer, cyanic acid (), and also of isofulminic acid (). 

Fulminate is the anion or any of its salts. For historical reasons, the fulminate functional group is understood to be as in isofulminic acid; whereas the group is called nitrile oxide.

==History==
This chemical was known since the early 1800s through its salts and via the products of reactions in which it was proposed to exist, but the acid itself was not detected until 1966.

==Structure==
Fulminic acid was long believed to have a structure of H–O–N+≡C−. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1966 isolation and analysis of a pure sample of fulminic acid that this structural idea was conclusively disproven. The chemical that actually has that structure, isofulminic acid (a tautomer of the actual fulminic acid structure) was eventually detected in 1988.

The structure of the molecule has been determined by microwave spectroscopy with the following bond-lengths - C-H: 1.027(1) Å, C-N: 1.161(15) Å, N-O: 1.207(15) Å.

==Synthesis==
A convenient synthesis involves flash pyrolysis of certain oximes. In contrast to earlier syntheses, this method avoids the use of highly explosive metal fulminates.

<doc id="1056676" wikidata="Q1143639" url="?curid=1056676" title="Ryōko Shinohara">
<text>is a Japanese singer and actress.

As a singer, she is best known for the 1994 song &quot;Itoshisa to Setsunasa to Kokoro Zuyosa to&quot; with producer Tetsuya Komuro, which charted at number one and made her the first female artist in Japan to record a double million in CD single sales. It was followed by the number one album &quot;Lady Generation: Shukujo no Jidai&quot; (1995). Shinohara&#x27;s musical output saw waning commercial reception in the latter half of the decade, at which she began concentrating on her acting career.

Highlighted by the &quot;Japan Times&quot; for her &quot;long reign as a TV drama queen&quot;, Shinohara&#x27;s best known acting credits include detective Yukihira Natsumi in the drama series &quot;Unfair&quot;, which spawned three feature films and several specials; and temp worker Haruko Oomae in &quot;Haken no Hinkaku&quot;. She has starred in several acclaimed films, winning two Japan Academy Film Prizes for her roles in &quot;The House Where the Mermaid Sleeps&quot; and &quot;Sakura Guardian in the North&quot;, both in 2018.

==Career==
Shinohara appeared in Tetsuya Nakashima&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;Kamikaze Girls&quot;.

<text>The word pā (; often spelled pa in English) can refer to any Māori village or defensive settlement, but often refers to hillforts – fortified settlements with palisades and defensive terraces – and also to fortified villages. Pā sites occur mainly in the North Island of New Zealand, north of Lake Taupō. Over 5,000 sites have been located, photographed and examined, although few have been subject to detailed analysis. No pā have been yet located from the early colonization period when early Polynesian-Māori colonizers lived in the lower South Island. Variations similar to pā occur throughout central Polynesia, in the islands of Fiji, Tonga and the Marquesas Islands.

In Māori culture, a great pā represented the mana (prestige or power) and strategic ability of an iwi (tribe or tribal confederacy), as personified by a rangatira (chieftain). Māori built pā in various defensible locations around the territory (rohe) of an iwi to protect fertile plantation-sites and food supplies.

== Description ==

Almost all pā were constructed on prominent raised ground, especially on volcanic hills. The natural slope of the hill is then terraced. Dormant volcanoes were commonly used for pā in the area of present-day Auckland. Pā are multipurpose in function. Pā that have been extensively studied after the New Zealand Wars and more recently were found to safeguard food- and water-storage sites or wells, food-storage pits (especially for kūmara), and small integrated plantations, maintained inside the pā.

Recent studies have shown that in most cases, few people lived long-term in a single pā, and that iwi maintained several pā at once, often under the control of a hapū (subtribe). Early European scholarly research on pā typically considered pā as isolated points settlements, analogous to European towns. Typically pā were a part of a greater area of seasonal occupation. The area in between pā were primarily common residential and horticultural sites. Over time, some pā may have become more important as places of display and as a symbol of status (tohu rangatira), rather than purely defensive locations.

==Traditional designs==
Traditional pā took a variety of designs. The simplest pā, the tuwatawata, generally consisted of a single wood palisade around the village stronghold, and several elevated stage levels from which to defend and attack. A pā maioro, general construction used multiple ramparts, earthen ditches used as hiding posts for ambush, and multiple rows of palisades. The most sophisticated pā was called a pā whakino, which generally included all the other features plus more food storage areas, water wells, more terraces, ramparts, palisades, fighting stages, outpost stages, underground dug-posts, mountain or hill summit areas called &quot;tihi&quot;, defended by more multiple wall palisades with underground communication passages, escape passages, elaborate traditionally carved entrance ways, and artistically carved main posts.

An important feature of pā that set them apart from British forts was their incorporation of food storage pits; some pā were built exclusively to safely store food. Pā locations include volcanoes, spurs, headlands, ridges, peninsulas and small islands, including artificial islands.

Standard features included a community well for long-term supply of water, designated waste areas, an outpost or an elevated stage on a summit on which a pahu would be slung on a frame that when struck would alarm the residents of an attack. The pahu was a large oblong piece of wood with a groove in the middle. A heavy piece of wood was struck from side to side of the groove to sound the alarm. The whare (a Māori dwelling place or hut) of the rangatira and ariki (chiefs) were often built on the summit with a weapons storage. In the 17th and 18th centuries the taiaha was the most common weapon. The chief&#x27;s stronghold on the summit could be bigger than a normal whare, some measuring 4.5 meters x 4 meters.

===Artefacts===

Pā excavated in Northland have provided numerous clues to Māori tool and weapon manufacturing, including the manufacturing of obsidian (volcanic glass), chert and argillite basalt, flakes, pounamu chisels, adzes, bone and ivory weapons, and an abundance of various hammer tools which had accumulated over hundreds of years.

Chert, a fine-grained, easily worked stone, familiar to Māori from its extensive use in Polynesia, was the most commonly used stone, with thousands of pieces being found in some Northland digs. Chips or flakes of chert were used as drills for pā construction, and for the making process of other industrial tools like Polynesian fish hooks. Another find in Northland pā studies was the use of what Māori call &quot;kokowai&quot;, or red ochre, a red dye made from red iron or aluminium oxides, which is finely ground, then mixed with an oily substance like fish oil or a plant resin. Māori used the chemical compound to keep insects away in pā built in more hazardous platforms in war. The compound is still widely used on whare and waka, and is used as a coating to prevent the wood from drying out.

===Storage===
Pā studies showed that on lower pā terraces were semi-underground whare (huts) about 2.4 m x 2 m for housing kūmara. These houses or storage houses were equipped with wide racks to hold hand-woven kūmara baskets at an angle of about 20 degrees, to shed water.

These storage whare had internal drains to drain water. In many pā studies, kūmara were stored in rua (kūmara pits). Common or lower rank Māori whare were on the lower or outer land, sometimes partly sunk into the ground by 30–40 cm. On the lower terraces, the ngutu (entrance gate) is situated. It had a low fence to force attackers to slow and take an awkward high step. The entrance was usually overlooked by a raised stage so attackers were very vulnerable.

Most food was grown outside the pā, though in some higher ranked pā designs there were small terraces areas to grow food within the palisades. Guards were stationed on the summit during times of threat. The blowing of a polished shell trumpet or banging a large wooden gong signaled the alarm. In some pā in rocky terrain, boulders were used as weapons. Some iwi such as Ngāi Tūhoe did not construct pā during early periods, but used forest locations for defence, attack and refuge – called &quot;pā runanga&quot;. Leading British archaeologist, Lady Aileen Fox (1976) has stated that there were about 2,000 hillforts in Britain and that New Zealand had twice that number but further work since then has raised the number of known pā to over 5,000.

Pā played a significant role in the New Zealand Wars. They are also known from earlier periods of Māori history from around 500 years ago, suggesting that Māori iwi ranking and the acquiring of resources and territory began to bring about warfare and led to an era of pā evolution.

==Fortification==


Their main defence was the use of earth ramparts (or terraced hillsides), topped with stakes or wicker barriers. The historically later versions were constructed by people who were fighting with muskets and melee weapons (such as spears, taiaha and mere) against the British Army and armed constables, who were equipped with swords, rifles, and heavy artillery such as howitzers and rocket artillery.

Simpler gunfighter pā of the post contact period could be put in place in very limited time scales, sometimes two to fifteen days, but the more complex classic constructions took months of hard labour, and were often rebuilt and improved over many years. The normal methods of attacking a classic pā were firstly the surprise attack at night when defences were not routinely manned. The second was the siege which involved less fighting and results depended on who had the better food resources. The third was to use a device called a &quot;Rou&quot; – a half-metre length of strong wood attached to a stout length of rope made from raupō leaves. The Rou was slipped over the palisade and then pulled by a team of toa until the wall fell. Gunfighter pā could resist bombardment for days with limited casualties although the psychological impact of shelling usually drove out defenders if attackers were patient and had enough ammunition. Some historians have wrongly credited Māori with inventing trench warfare with its associated variety of earth works for protection. Serious military earth works were first recorded in use by French military engineers in the 1700s and were used extensively at Crimea and in the US Civil War. Māori&#x27;s undoubted skill at constructing earthworks evolved from their skill at building traditional pā which, by the late 18th century, involved considerable earthworks to create rua (food storage pits), ditches, earth ramparts and multiple terraces.

===Gunfighter pā===
Warrior chiefs like Te Ruki Kawiti realised that these properties were a good counter to the greater firepower of the British. With that in mind, they sometimes built pā purposefully as a defensive fortification, like at Ruapekapeka, a new pā constructed specifically to draw the British away, instead of protecting a specific site or place of habitation like more traditional classic pā. At the Battle of Ruapekapeka the British suffered 45 casualties against only 30 amongst the Māori. The British learned from earlier mistakes and listened to their Māori allies. The pā was subjected to two weeks of bombardment before being successfully attacked. Hōne Heke won the battle and &quot;he carried his point&quot;, with the Crown never tried to resurrect the flagstaff at Kororareka while Kawiti lived. Afterwards, British engineers twice surveyed the fortifications, produced a scale model and tabled the plans in the House of Commons.

The fortifications of such a purpose-built pā included palisades of hard pūriri trunks sunk about 1.5m in the ground and split timber, with bundles of protective flax padding in the later gunfighter pā, the two lines of palisade covering a firing trench with individual pits, while more defenders could use the second palisade to fire over the heads of the first below. Simple communication trenches or tunnels were also built to connect the various parts, as found at Ohaeawai Pā or Ruapekapeka. The forts could even include underground bunkers, protected by a deep layer of earth over wooden beams, which sheltered the inhabitants during periods of heavy shelling by artillery.

A limiting factor of the Māori fortifications that were not built as set pieces, however, was the need for the people inhabiting them to leave frequently to cultivate areas for food, or to gather it from the wilderness. Consequently, pā would often be seasonally abandoned for 4 to 6 months of each year. In Māori tradition a pā would also be abandoned if a chief was killed or if some calamity took place that a tohunga (witch doctor/shaman) had attributed to an evil spirit (atua). In the 1860s, Māori, though nominally Christian, still followed aspects of their tikanga at the same time. Normally, once the kūmara had been harvested in March–April and placed in storage the inhabitants could lead a more itinerant lifestyle, trading, or harvesting gathering other foodstuffs needed for winter but this did not stop war taking place outside this time frame if the desire for utu or payback was great. To Māori, summer was the normal fighting season and this put them at a huge disadvantage in conflicts with the British Army with its well-organised logistics train which could fight efficiently year round.

===Swamp pā===
Fox noted that lake pā were quite common inland in places such as the Waikato. Frequently they appear to have been constructed for whānau (extended family) size groups. The topography was often flat, although a headland or spur location was favoured. The lake frontage was usually protected with a single row of palisades but the landward boundary was protected by a double row. Mangakaware swamp pā, Waikato, had an area of about 3,400 m2. There were 137 palisade post holes identified. The likely total number of posts was about 500. It contained eight buildings within the palisades, six of which have been identified as whare, the largest of which was 2.4 m x 6 m. One building was possibly a cooking shelter and the last a large storehouse. There was one rectangular structure, 1.5 m x 3 m, just outside the swampside palisades which was most likely either a drying rack or storehouse. Swamps and lakes provided eels, ducks, weka (swamp hen) and in some cases fish. The largest of this type was found at Lake Ngaroto, Waikato, the ancient settlement of the Ngāti Apakura, very close to the battle of Hingakaka. This was a built on a much larger scale. Large numbers of carved wooden artefacts were found preserved in the peat. These are on display at the nearby Te Awamutu museum.

Kaiapoi is a well-known example of a pā using swamp as a key part of its defence.

==Examples==
* The old pā remains found on One Tree Hill, close to the centre of Auckland, represent one of the largest known sites as well as one of the largest prehistoric earthworks fortifications known worldwide.
* Pukekura at Taiaroa Head, Otago, established around 1650 and still occupied by Māori in the 1840s.
*Rangiriri (Waikato), a gunfighter pā built in 1863 by Kingites. This pā resembles a very long trench running east–west between the Waikato River and Lake Kopuera with swampy margins. At the high point was a substantial earth works with trenches and parapets. The pā was bombarded from ships and land using Armstrong Guns.
* Nukuhau pā, Waikato River near Stubbs Road. This is a triangular shape pā formed on a flat raised spur with the Waikato River on one side 200m long, a gully with a stream on the long west axis 200 m long and two man made ditches on the narrower southern axis, 107m long. The average slope to the river is 12m at an angle of 70 degrees.
* Huriawa, near Karitane in Otago, occupied a narrow, jagged, and easily defended peninsula built in the mid 18th century by Kāi Tahu chief Te Wera.

<doc id="1056686" wikidata="Q1542184" url="?curid=1056686" title="Cat People (1942 film)">
<text>Cat People is a 1942 American supernatural horror film directed by Jacques Tourneur and produced for RKO by Val Lewton. The film tells the story of Irena Dubrovna, a newly married Serbian fashion illustrator obsessed with the idea that she is descended from an ancient tribe of Cat People who metamorphose into black panthers when aroused. When her husband begins to show interest in one of his co-workers, Irena begins to stalk her. The film stars Simone Simon as Irena, and features Kent Smith, Tom Conway, Jane Randolph, and Jack Holt in supporting roles.

Production began in 1942, with Lewton being placed in charge of developing RKO&#x27;s low-budget horror films. He brought together a team of filmmakers that he had worked with in the past, including Tourneur, editor Mark Robson and screenwriter DeWitt Bodeen. &quot;Cat People&quot; was the first film upon which the team worked. They were given the title by an RKO executive, who instructed them to develop a film from it. After researching various horror films and cat-related literature, Bodeen and Lewton developed the script with Lewton doing extensive uncredited work on the story. The film was shot at RKO&#x27;s studios reusing sets from previous films such as &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;. During editing, Robson developed a technique later called The Lewton Bus, a jump scare that Lewton used in his subsequent films.

&quot;Cat People&quot; had its premiere at the Rialto Theatre in Manhattan on December 5, 1942, before having a wider release on December 25. Initial critical reviews ranged from negative to mildly enthusiastic. The film did well at the box office, being one of RKO&#x27;s biggest hits of the season. Several horror films of the 1940s and 1950s were influenced by &quot;Cat People&quot;, either drawing on the film&#x27;s shadowy visuals or containing a female character who fears that she possesses a hereditary trait that makes her transform into a monster. The film was followed by a sequel, &quot;The Curse of the Cat People&quot;, in 1944, and a remake, directed by Paul Schrader, was released in 1982. The film has become well known, though created as a B-movie, being selected by Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1993. Retrospective reception of the original has been varied. Some modern critics have described the film as being too subdued for the genre and have deprecated the quality of the acting. Others have praised the film&#x27;s atmosphere and sophistication, with the critic Roger Ebert describing it and the other Val Lewton productions as landmark films of the 1940s.

==Plot==
At the Central Park Zoo, Serbian-born fashion illustrator Irena Dubrovna makes sketches of a captive black panther. She catches the attention of marine engineer Oliver Reed, who strikes up a conversation. Irena invites him to her apartment for tea. At her apartment, Oliver is intrigued by a statue of a medieval warrior on horseback impaling a large cat with his sword. Irena informs Oliver that the figure is King John of Serbia and that the cat represents evil. According to legend, in medieval times, the Christian residents of her home village gradually turned to witchcraft after being enslaved by the Mameluks. When King John drove the Mameluks out and saw what the villagers had become, he had them killed. However, &quot;the wisest and the most wicked&quot; escaped into the mountains. Oliver is dismissive of the legend even though Irena clearly takes it seriously.

Oliver buys Irena a kitten, but upon meeting her, it hisses. Irena suggests they go to the pet shop to exchange it. When they enter the shop, the animals go wild in her presence, and Irena becomes uneasy. Irena gradually reveals to Oliver that she believes she is descended from the cat people of her village, and that she will transform into a panther if aroused to passion. Despite this, Oliver asks her to marry him, and she agrees. During the dinner after their wedding at a Serbian restaurant, a cat-like woman walks over and addresses Irena as &quot;moja sestra&quot; (&quot;my sister&quot;).

Irena never consummates the marriage, fearful of the consequences. Oliver is patient with her, but eventually persuades her to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd. Judd tries to convince her that her fears stem from childhood traumas. Meanwhile, Irena is unhappy to discover that Oliver has confided in his assistant, Alice Moore. Alice confesses to Oliver that she loves him. When Irena spots Oliver and Alice seated together at a restaurant, she follows Alice home. Just as Alice hears a menacing sound, a bus pulls up and she boards it. Soon afterward, a groundskeeper discovers several freshly killed sheep. The paw prints leading away turn into imprints of a woman&#x27;s shoes. A disheveled Irena returns to her apartment; she is shown afterward weeping in the bathtub. Irena dreams of Dr. Judd dressed up as King John speaking of &quot;the key&quot;. She later steals the key to the panther&#x27;s cage at the zoo.

Irena, Oliver, and Alice visit a museum, and Irena is angered when the two virtually ignore her. That evening, when Alice decides to use the basement swimming pool of her apartment building, she is stalked by an animal. When Alice screams for help, Irena appears, turning on the lights, and says she is looking for Oliver. Alice later finds her bathrobe torn to shreds. After an appointment with Dr. Judd, Irena tells Oliver that she is no longer afraid, but Oliver tells her it is too late: he has realized that he loves Alice and intends to divorce Irena. Later at work, Oliver and Alice are cornered by a snarling animal. Oliver and Alice manage to get out of the building, but not before smelling Irena&#x27;s perfume.

Alice calls Judd to warn him to stay away from Irena, but he hangs up when Irena arrives for her appointment with him. He kisses Irena passionately, causing her to transform into a panther and subsequently kill him. When Oliver and Alice arrive, Irena slips away and goes to the zoo. She opens the panther&#x27;s cage with the stolen key and is struck down by the escaping panther, which is accidentally hit and killed by a car. Next to the panther&#x27;s cage, Oliver and Alice find Irena&#x27;s dead body lying on the ground. Oliver says, &quot;She never lied to us&quot;, and leads Alice away.

==Production==
===Development===

In March 1942, producer Val Lewton ended his working relationship with independent producer David O. Selznick to work for RKO Radio Pictures&#x27; Charles Koerner, becoming the head of a new unit created to develop B-movie horror feature films. Writing in 2009, the film critic Kim Newman compared the Lewton productions to RKO&#x27;s own B-movie mystery series based on The Falcon, which were, unlike Lewton&#x27;s productions, &quot;churned out&quot;. The Lewton productions were modestly budgeted compared to Universal productions like &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941), or Paramount productions like &quot;The Uninvited&quot; (1944), but had larger budgets than those of Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) films like &quot;The Mad Monster&quot; (1942), or Monogram films like &quot;The Ape Man&quot; (1943). &quot;Cat People&quot; had a budget of around $135,000, which was significantly less than Universal spent on &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot; (1943), but more than the $97,000 that the poverty row studio PRC spent on &quot;The Devil Bat&quot; (1940).

Lewton selected most of the film&#x27;s main crew, including director Jacques Tourneur and writer DeWitt Bodeen, who all worked on the treatment. These were people Lewton had connections with through their work with Selznick, as Tourneur had worked as part of the second unit teams for Selznick&#x27;s production of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1935) and Bodeen had been a research assistant on what would become &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943).

The germ of &quot;Cat People&quot; was Lewton&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Bagheeta,&quot; published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; magazine (July 1930), about a legendary panther, a &quot;half leopard and half woman . . . were-beast,&quot; that lives in the Caucasus mountains and plagues local farmers. Tourneur and Bodeen offered conflicting accounts as to how &quot;Cat People&quot; was conceived. Tourneur said that Lewton called him from RKO to direct the film after Koerner attended a party where it was suggested to him that he develop a film with the title &quot;Cat People&quot;. Tourneur added that Lewton was not sure what to do with the title and recalled Lewton deciding to not make a &quot;cheap horror movie that the studio expected but something intelligent and in good taste&quot;. Bodeen&#x27;s version involved him being hired by Lewton at RKO as a contract writer. He had previously watched British and American horror and suspense films that he felt were &quot;typical of what we did not want to do&quot;. According to Bodeen, Koerner felt that werewolves, vampires and man-made monsters were over-exploited, and that &quot;nobody has done much with cats&quot;. Bodeen added that Lewton was unhappy with the proposed title of &quot;Cat People&quot; and said, &quot;if you want to get out now, I won&#x27;t hold it against you.&quot;

Bodeen then began researching cat-related literature, including Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s &quot;The Eyes of the Panther&quot; and Margaret Irwin&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur Seeks a Wife&quot;. Lewton decided to base the film on Algernon Blackwood&#x27;s 1906 short story &quot;Ancient Sorceries&quot;. Blackwood&#x27;s story had a contemporary setting and involved a Medieval architecture French town inhabited by a group of devil-worshipping cat people. According to Bodeen, as the rights were about to be purchased, Lewton changed his mind at the last minute and told Bodeen that the film would be set in contemporary New York and involve a love triangle between a man, a foreign woman obsessed with abnormal fears, and a female office worker. According to Tourneur, he was not content with the period setting of &quot;Ancient Sorceries&quot;, stating, &quot;if you&#x27;re going to have horror, the audience must be able to identify with the characters in order to be frightened.&quot; Lewton contributed heavily to the screenplay. During the writing process, Tourneur recalled driving by Lewton&#x27;s home in the evening to find a light turned on where Lewton was still working on the screenplay. Bodeen described the screenplay as a &quot;group project&quot;, saying Lewton had the original idea and he wrote the treatment and screenplay, collaborating with Tourneur and Lewton, and later the film&#x27;s editor Mark Robson. Bodeen concluded that &quot;Tourneur was entirely responsible for the style of &quot;Cat People&quot;, but if you read the screenplay you would find everything in the film was in the original script – and that&#x27;s simply because it was a group project. Val, Tourneur, myself, Robson – we all talked about it and I put it down on paper.&quot; By May 1, 1942, Bodeen had a fifty-page treatment completed for &quot;Cat People&quot;.

===Pre-production===
Simone Simon was cast in the role of Irena Dubrovna by producer Lewton. Lewton commented that, &quot;I&#x27;d like to have a girl with a little kitten face like Simone Simon, cute and soft and cuddly and seemingly not at all dangerous.&quot; He compared his decision to the casting of Kathleen Burke in &quot;Island of Lost Souls&quot; (1932), where she portrayed the Panther Woman, stating that any attempt at securing a wild, cat-like appearance in their casting would be disastrous. Simon, a star in her native France, had recently garnered fame in the United States for her role in &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1941). Opposite Simon, Kent Smith was cast as Oliver Reed. Smith allegedly received the role after Lewton spotted him cycling across the studio lot.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported in August 1942 that Jack Holt had been cast in a supporting role, following Simon&#x27;s casting as the lead. Tom Conway was cast as Dr. Judd, a psychiatrist who evaluates Irena and initially believes her fears to be delusional. Jane Randolph, then a young actress who had recently begun her film career, was cast as Alice Moore, a woman vying for Oliver&#x27;s affections. Lewton had wanted Jennifer Jones to play Alice, but was prevented from casting her by Selznick, who had other plans for Jones. Among the rest of the crew was the composer of the score Roy Webb and cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca, who were seasoned veterans at RKO.

===Filming===

Principal photography commenced on July 28, 1942, at RKO&#x27;s Gower Gulch studios in Hollywood. Tourneur recalled that he was nearly fired three days into shooting after executive producer Lew Ostrow saw the daily rushes, called Lewton and told him to fire the director. According to Tourneur, Lewton subsequently contacted Koerner, who viewed the raw unedited footage of the film the following day and expressed satisfaction with Tourneur&#x27;s performance. Simon frequently clashed with co-stars as well as Tourneur during the shoot and displayed a significant temper. Randolph recalled that Simon frequently upstaged her during their scenes together, to the point that Tourneur confronted Simon: &quot;He really bawled her out—in French. And she didn&#x27;t like that either.&quot; Randolph also recalled Simon intentionally pouring coffee on one of her costumes in order to halt the production for the day. In a 1994 interview, Simon commented on her reputation in the United States: &quot;I had a reputation of being temperamental – I never knew why – but this became part of my temperamental legend.&quot; Tourneur also clashed with higher-ups at RKO, recalling a later scene in the film, which featured a panther: &quot;The front office made me put a cat in the drafting room scene: I had only intended to suggest the cat&#x27;s presence by shadows.&quot; The director finished this scene by shooting it in a way that &quot;you couldn&#x27;t really be sure what you were seeing. That&#x27;s the only way to do it.&quot;

Some of the film sets were re-used from previous productions, such as the hallway and staircase in Dubrovna&#x27;s apartment, which were from &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;. Other sets were re-used from &quot;The Devil and Miss Jones&quot;. Additional photography took place at the Royal Palms Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, where the swimming pool sequence involving a character believing she is stalked by a panther was shot. The location was chosen by the production team due to its claustrophobic atmosphere. Bodeen also stated that the scene was inspired by his own experience of nearly drowning when swimming alone at night in a pool while Tourneur said that the scene was based on his own experience of swimming alone in a friend&#x27;s pool while the friend&#x27;s pet cheetah escaped and began pacing nearby. Filming was concluded on August 21. The film&#x27;s final cost sheet was $141,659.88, which was $22,711.88 over-budget.

===Post-production===

&quot;Cat People&quot; editor Mark Robson had previously worked on Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;, which was a financial failure on its release. Robson felt that he was assigned to Lewton&#x27;s horror film unit because RKO punished anyone who had worked with Welles. &quot;Cat People&quot; contains a stalking scene that ends with a jump scare. Such scenes were also featured in other Lewton horror productions, such as &quot;The Leopard Man&quot; and &quot;The Seventh Victim&quot;. Robson referred to these scenes as &quot;the bus&quot;, which he described as an &quot;editing device [he] created by accident&quot;. In &quot;Cat People&quot;, the scene involved Alice walking through a park alone at night as the film cuts to close ups of her face while her expression changes from chipper to distressed as she quickens her walking pace. Alice looks over her shoulder and turns to the sudden sound of a bus&#x27;s air brakes. Robson stated that he &quot;put a loud sound of air brakes on it so that it knocked viewers out of their seats. That became the &#x27;bus&#x27; and we used it in every film.&quot;

On October 5, Constantin Bakaleinikoff conducted Roy Webb&#x27;s score for &quot;Cat People&quot; at RKO&#x27;s Stage 2A. Part of the score was influenced by Simon. Lewton found Simon singing a tune at RKO that went &quot;doo-doo-baby-doo&quot;, subsequently taking her to see Webb, who developed the tune into the film&#x27;s score. The score of the film, along with those of &quot;I Walked with a Zombie&quot;, &quot;The Seventh Victim&quot;, &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot;, and &quot;Bedlam&quot;, was re-recorded by The Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra and released on compact disc in 1999. In his review of the album, Bruce Eder wrote for AllMusic noting that both &quot;Cat People&quot; and &quot;The Seventh Victim&quot; scores &quot;represent distinctly non-traditional suspense scores, built around memorable core motifs, dealing with their central characters&#x27; struggle with the forces of evil within and without&quot;.

Prior to its official release, the higher-up executives at RKO saw the film at a studio projection room and expressed disapproval. Early test screenings took place in October at the RKO Hill Street Theatre, a testing site for sneak previews, with the cast and crew in attendance. Bodeen recalled that the film opened up with a Disney cartoon about a kitten, which led to the audience meowing. The audience cat-called and meowed further at the films opening title screen, according to Bodeen. Upon seeing an early preview, Randolph commented that she thought she was &quot;terrible&quot; in the film, while Simon was terrified that people would laugh at her performance, specifically in the pool scene. Bodeen found that as the story progressed the audience calmed and became more involved in the film. By late October, Lewton and Tourneur were already shooting their next film together, &quot;I Walked with a Zombie&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Cat People&quot; had its premiere at the Rialto Theatre in Manhattan on December 5, 1942, and it was released regionally the following day in New York City. Its first two weeks at the Rialto Theatre, the film took in $17,000; in comparison, &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; grossed $19,500 at the same theatre in December 1941. The film received a wide release on December 25, distributed by RKO Radio Pictures. It had its Los Angeles premiere on January 14, 1943, at the Hawaii Theater, where it broke the attendance record. RKO reissued the film theatrically in 1952.

The film&#x27;s box office receipts are disputed. Film historian Edmund Bansak has estimated the box office for &quot;Cat People&quot; at $4 million domestically and $4 million in foreign markets. Film historians Chris Fujiwara and Joel Siegel also put the domestic box office at $4 million. &quot;Variety&quot; estimated its rentals in 1943 as $1.2 million. Gregory Mank stated that RKO files report that domestic rentals were $360,000 and foreign rentals were $175,000, leading to a total of $535,000, and a profit of $183,000. Mank noted that rentals are not equivalent to gross revenue, and, assuming the revenue was split evenly between theaters and the studio, the film grossed over $1 million. He wrote that this was still &quot;excellent business&quot;, comparing it to the profit of RKO&#x27;s &quot;The Falcon&#x27;s Brother&quot;, which had worldwide rentals of $361,000.

===Home media===
RKO Home Video released the film on home video in 1986 as part of their horror series. It was released on laserdisc by the Voyager Company as part of The Criterion Collection in 1995. This release contained an audio commentary by Bruce Eder, trailers for other Val Lewton titles and his filmography, and a section with production stills, lobby cards, and production photos.

In the United States, &quot;Cat People&quot; and its sequel, &quot;The Curse of the Cat People&quot;, were issued in 2005 as both a double feature DVD and as part of the &quot;Val Lewton Horror Collection&quot; DVD box set. In December 2016, &quot;Cat People&quot; was reissued on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection. This Blu-ray was from a new digital transfer created at 2K resolution from a 35mm safety fine-grain master.

==Reception==
===Contemporary===
At the time of its original release, the reviews for &quot;Cat People&quot; were mixed. Newman compiled the reviews after the film&#x27;s premiere in New York, stating that &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;New York Sunday News&quot;, and the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; &quot;all went thumbs down&quot;, while &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, &quot;New-York Mirror&quot;, &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;, and &quot;PM&quot; reviews were &quot;more positive, if not really enthusiastic&quot;. Wanda Hale of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; was unimpressed by the film, writing that it &quot;tries hard to be a melodrama ... but it doesn&#x27;t try hard enough&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as a &quot;labored and obvious attempt to induce shock&quot;, and said that its themes are explored &quot;at tedious and graphically unproductive length&quot;. He commented on Simon&#x27;s acting, stating that actresses who are trying to portray &quot;[feline] temptations – in straight horror pictures, at least – should exercise their digits a bit more freely than does Simone Simon&quot;.

Newman referred to the reviews after the film opened in Los Angeles as &quot;somewhat better&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; stated that the film was &quot;well-made on a moderate budget outlay&quot; and relies upon &quot;developments of surprises confined to psychology and mental reaction, rather than transformation to grotesque and marauding characters for visual impact on the audiences&quot;. The review went on to say that the script would be &quot;hazy for the average audience in several instances, [but] carries sufficient punch in the melodramatic sequences to hold it together in good style&quot;, elaborating that Tourneur &quot;does a fine job with a most difficult assignment&quot;. A reviewer at &quot;BoxOffice&quot; found the film &quot;grim and unrelenting ... a dose of horror best suited to addicts past the curable stage&quot;, and noted that the film was &quot;definitely not for children, young or old ... Potent stuff, straight from the psychopathic clinic&quot;. A critic writing in the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, a British publication, stated that &quot;Cat People&quot; was &quot;a fantastic story, reasonably produced and directed&quot;, and complimented the photography and acting, noting that Simon &quot;only partly succeeds in interpreting the part of Irena, but lighting and camera work and sound recording help to make her performance adequate&quot;.

===Retrospective===
Fujiwara summarized &quot;Cat People&quot;″s retrospective critical status by stating that it &quot;is so famous that it has, inevitably, suffered a backlash, and now it might even be called underrated&quot;. Less enthusiastic reviews came from Charles Higam and Joel Greenberg, who wrote that the film now appeared &quot;so understated that much of its intended effect is dissipated [...] its total impression is distinctly tepid&quot;. Joel E. Siegel spoke about the film in his book on Lewton, stating it was &quot;seriously weakened by passages of lumpy, strained dialogue, uncertain performance and uneven pacing&quot;. Richard Combs of the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; compared the film unfavorably to other Lewton productions, stating that &quot;it is perhaps easier to prefer the more mellow, less heavily fingered fantasy of &quot;Curse of the Cat People&quot;, and even the reconciled ambitions of &quot;The Ghost Ship&quot;&quot;. In his 1995 book on Lewton, Edmund G. Bansak found that &quot;Cat People&quot; &quot;may have lost some of its edge over the years and what remains may be a bit tarnished, but it is infinitely better than Paul Schrader&#x27;s 1982 remake&quot;. Tourneur himself held varying opinions about the film, once saying that it was &quot;very childish but audiences in those days were more naive than they are today [...] but there are some very good things in it&quot;. On another occasion, he suggested that World War II-era audiences &quot;all love war and love to be frightened, and in wartime people had money from plants, money to burn, and they loved that kind of film&quot;. Critic Ken Hanke remarked: &quot;It isn&#x27;t because the [Lewton films] are unsuccessful in themselves. It&#x27;s simply that they threw the baby out with the bathwater by rejecting &quot;everything&quot; of the Universal product. Moreover, the films are a bit too &quot;trés snob&quot; and condescending for genre fans to feel comfortable about them.&quot;

The critical reception to Simon&#x27;s acting has historically been mixed. Siegel critiqued her acting, stating that her range was &quot;too narrow for the film&#x27;s more dramatic moments, a problem heightened by her difficulties with American pronunciation&quot;. Tourneur also stated that he was not happy with Simon&#x27;s acting. On the other hand, Fujiwara wrote that, although &quot;not delicately nuanced&quot;, Simon&#x27;s performance &quot;is effective in its mixture of narcissism and hesitant uncertainty&quot;. Newman described Simon&#x27;s performance as &quot;remarkably affecting, strange accent and all&quot;, adding that &quot;there&#x27;s a sense of life in her performance that makes &quot;Cat People&quot;, like most great monster movies, as much a tragedy as a melodrama&quot;.

Newman praised the film, noting that it was the first major supernatural horror film with a contemporary, urban, American setting and &quot;normal people, engaged in normal occupations&quot; as leading characters, and concluded that &quot;Cat People&quot; was a progenitor of films like &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;. He wrote that, through numerous viewings of the film, he discovered &quot;new aspect[s], some unnoticed detail carefully crafted [...] I would happily rewatch it this evening which may be the highest praise I can give any film&quot;. In his book on Tourneur, Fujiwara declared that &quot;Cat People&quot; was the &quot;master text&quot; of Tourneur&#x27;s career, stating that most of his later films have some connection with &quot;Cat People&quot;, specifically &quot;The Leopard Man&quot; and &quot;Night of the Demon&quot;, but also &quot;Experiment Perilous&quot;, &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, &quot;Nightfall&quot;, and &quot;Circle of Danger&quot;. Fujiwara concluded that &quot;Cat People&quot; is, &quot;with all its flaws, a perfect film&quot;, and added that even its flaws &quot;have become classic&quot;, dismissing the &quot;careful&quot;, &quot;tepid&quot;, &quot;strained&quot;, and &quot;uneven&quot; qualities that some critics have complained about. He also stated that &quot;Cat People&quot; &quot;is still contagious; the viewer can still share the surprise and pleasure the film evoked in audiences who discovered this unheralded B horror film on its initial release&quot;. Critic Roger Ebert included &quot;Cat People&quot; in his list of &quot;Great Movies&quot; in 2006. He remarked that the film would work for contemporary audiences depending on their tastes, stating that it is &quot;frightening in an eerie, mysterious way that was hard to define&quot; with &quot;an undertone of sexual danger that was more ominous because it was never acted upon&quot;. Ebert also praised the filmmakers, writing that Tourneur and Musuraca were &quot;masters of light and shadow&quot;, and called the films Lewton produced in the 1940s &quot;landmark[s] in American movie history&quot;. In 1993, the Library of Congress deemed &quot;Cat People&quot; &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

In &quot;Monsters in the Closet&quot;, the film theorist Harry Benshoff argues that the films of Val Lewton such as &quot;Cat People&quot; reflected &quot;a growing awareness of homosexuality, homosexual communities, and the dynamics of homosexual oppression as it was played out in society and the military&quot; during that era, which led to a more nuanced depiction of monsters in films of that era.

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
Discussing the history of horror films, Newman stated that, if a horror film in the 1940s was financially successful, it was likely to become a franchise. &quot;Cat People&quot; was followed by &quot;The Curse of the Cat People&quot;, directed by Robert Wise, which is about Oliver and Alice&#x27;s daughter, Amy, and Amy&#x27;s invisible friend, portrayed by Simon. In addition to Simon, Smith, and Randolph, Elizabeth Russell appears in the sequel in a different role, that of Barbara Farren. Lewton unsuccessfully attempted to have the title of &quot;The Curse of the Cat People&quot; changed to &quot;Amy and Her Friend&quot;.

&quot;The Seventh Victim&quot; is described by Newman as being &quot;an unacknowledged spin-off&quot; of &quot;Cat People&quot;, as it also features Tom Conway playing Dr. Judd, as well as another haunted woman eager to embrace death. In the film, Judd recalls that he once knew a mysterious woman who was in fact a &quot;raving lunatic&quot;, even though Judd&#x27;s character died in &quot;Cat People&quot;, making the relationship between the two fictional narratives incoherent. In memos and early drafts of the screenplay of &quot;The Seventh Victim&quot;, Conway&#x27;s character was referred to as &quot;Mr. Siegfried&quot;, leading film scholars to believe that the character&#x27;s name was changed to create continuity between the two films and capitalize on &quot;Cat People&quot;″s success.

===Remakes===

British producer Milton Subotsky bought the rights to &quot;Cat People&quot; from RKO with plans to develop a remake. Subotsky later passed the property to Universal, which initially planned to have Roger Vadim direct. Three drafts of the screenplay were developed, the first two written by Bob Clark and the final version written by Alan Ormsby. According to Ormsby, Vadim was very concerned that the film would appear sexist, as the woman who was sexually intense had to be destroyed, so he created a male character who has the same problem.

In the early 1980s, Universal Pictures hired Paul Schrader to direct the remake of &quot;Cat People&quot;. The remake was announced and began shooting in 1981. According to cinematographer John Bailey, Schrader paid homage to the stalking scene in the original with a scene featuring Annette O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s character jogging through a park as she appears to be stalked. Bailey and Schrader also remade the swimming pool scene, with Bailey recalling that they carefully studied the original scene, taking note of how the shadows reflected against the pool, and stating that this sequence was the most similar part of the remake to the original film because &quot;we didn&#x27;t think we could do it any better&quot;. The remake was released in April 1982 to mixed reviews.

In March 1999, a second remake was announced as a co-production between Universal Pictures and Overbrook Entertainment. Written by Rafael Moreu, it would have been updated to the present day and set in New York, but this project was never filmed.

===Influence===
A number of contemporary films were influenced by &quot;Cat People&quot;, such as Columbia Pictures&#x27; &quot;Cry of the Werewolf&quot; (1944), which Newman described as combining the &quot;subtle Lewton approach&quot; with elements from Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;, like a plot that involves a gypsy curse. Numerous films have borrowed plot or character elements from &quot;Cat People&quot;, particularly by having a female character who fears she has inherited the tendency to turn into a monster, or attempted to replicate the shadowy visual style of Tourneur and Musuraca, among them &quot;Jungle Woman&quot; (1944), &quot;The Soul of a Monster&quot; (1944), &quot;The Woman Who Came Back&quot; (1945), &quot;She-Wolf of London&quot; (1946), &quot;The Catman of Paris&quot; (1946), &quot;The Cat Creeps&quot; (1946), &quot;The Creeper&quot; (1948), &quot;Cult of the Cobra&quot; (1955), &quot;The She-Creature&quot; (1956), and &quot;Daughter of Dr. Jekyll&quot; (1957).

Director Curtis Harrington made two films as tributes to Lewton&#x27;s work. The first was &quot;Night Tide&quot; (1961), which reworked the plot of &quot;Cat People&quot; into a story about a sideshow performer who dresses as a mermaid and is concerned she actually is a siren. The second was the television film &quot;The Cat Creature&quot; (1973), which featured Kent Smith in the cast and also paid tribute Universal&#x27;s horror films.

<text>A real estate contract is a contract between parties for the purchase and sale, exchange, or other conveyance of real estate. The sale of land is governed by the laws and practices of the jurisdiction in which the land is located. Real estate called leasehold estate is actually a rental of real property such as an apartment, and leases (rental contracts) cover such rentals since they typically do not result in recordable deeds. Freehold (&quot;More permanent&quot;) conveyances of real estate are covered by real estate contracts, including conveying fee simple title, life estates, remainder estates, and freehold easements. Real estate contracts are typically bilateral contracts (i.e., agreed to by two parties) and should have the legal requirements specified by contract law in general and should also be in writing to be enforceable.

==Details explained on the contract==

===In writing===
It is a legal requirement in all jurisdictions that contracts for the sale of land be in writing to be enforceable. The various &quot;Statute of frauds&quot; require contracts for the sale of land to be in writing. In South Africa, the &quot;Alienation of Land Act&quot; specifies that any agreement of sale of immovable property must be in writing. In Italy, each transfer of real estate must be registered in front of a notary public in writing.

The common practice is for an &quot;exchange of contracts&quot; to take place. This involves two copies of the contract of sale being signed, one copy of which is retained by each party. When the parties are together, both would usually sign both copies, one copy of which would be retained by each party, sometimes with a formal handing over of a copy from one party to the other. However, it is usually sufficient that only the copy retained by each party be signed by the other party only. This rule enables contracts to be &quot;exchanged&quot; by mail. Both copies of the contract of sale become binding only after each party is in possession of a copy of the contract signed by the other party—i.e., the exchange is said to be &quot;complete&quot;. An exchange by electronic means is generally insufficient for an exchange, unless the laws of the jurisdiction expressly validate such signatures.

A contract for the sale of land must:

* Identify the parties: The full name of the parties must be on the contract. In a sales contract, the parties are the seller(s) and buyer(s) of the real estate, who are often called the principals to distinguish them from real estate agents, who are effectively their intermediaries and representatives in negotiation of the price. If there are any real estate agents brokering the sale, they are typically listed also as the real estate brokers/agents who would earn the commission from the sale.
* Identify the real estate (property): At least the address, but preferably the legal description must be on the contract.
* Identify the purchase price: The amount of the sales price or a reasonably ascertainable figure (an appraisal to be completed at a future date) must be on the contract.
* Include signatures: A real estate contract must be entered into voluntarily (not by force), and must be signed by the parties.
* Have a legal purpose: The contract is void if it calls for illegal action.
* Involve Competent parties: Mentally impaired, drugged persons, etc. cannot enter into a contract. Contracts in which at least one of the parties is a minor are voidable by the minor.
* Reflect a meeting of the minds: Each side must be clear and agree as to the essential details, rights, and obligations of the contract.
* Include Consideration: Consideration is something of value bargained for in exchange of the real estate. Money is the most common form of consideration, but other consideration of value, such as other property in exchange, or a promise to perform (i.e. a promise to pay) is also satisfactory.

Notarization by a notary public is normally not required for a real estate contract, but many recording offices require that a seller&#x27;s or conveyor&#x27;s signature on a deed be notarized to record the deed. The real estate contract is typically not recorded with the government, although statements or declarations of the price paid are commonly required to be submitted to the recorder&#x27;s office.

Sometimes real estate contracts will provide for a lawyer review period of several days after the signing by the parties to check the provisions of the contract and counterpropose any that are unsuitable.

If there are any real estate brokers/agents brokering the sale, the buyer&#x27;s agent will often fill in the blanks on a standard contract form for the buyer(s) and seller(s) to sign. The broker commonly gets such contract forms from a real estate association he/she belongs to. When both buyer and seller have agreed to the contract by signing it, the broker provides copies of the signed contract to the buyer and seller.

===Offer and acceptance===
As may be the case with other contracts, real estate contracts may be formed by one party making an offer and another party accepting the offer. To be enforceable, the offers and acceptances must be in writing (Statute of Frauds, Common Law)and signed by the parties agreeing to the contract. Often, the party making the offer prepares a written real estate contract, signs it, and transmits it to the other party who would accept the offer by signing the contract. As with all other types of legal offers, the other party may accept the offer, reject it (in which case the offer is terminated), make a counteroffer (in which case the original offer is terminated), or not respond to the offer (in which case the offer terminates by the expiration date in it). Before the offer (or counteroffer) is accepted, the offering (or countering) party can withdraw it. A counteroffer may be countered with yet another offer, and a counteroffering process may go on indefinitely between the parties.

To be enforceable, a real estate contract must possess original signatures by the parties and any alterations to the contract must be initialed by all the parties involved. If the original offer is marked up and initialed by the party receiving it, then signed, this is not an offer and acceptance but a counter-offer.

===Deed specified===
A real estate contract typically does not convey or transfer ownership of real estate by itself. A different document called a deed is used to convey real estate. In a real estate contract, the type of deed to be used to convey the real estate may be specified, such as a warranty deed or a quitclaim deed. If a deed type is not specifically mentioned, &quot;marketable title&quot; may be specified, implying a warranty deed should be provided. Lenders will insist on a warranty deed. Any liens or other encumbrances on the title to the real estate should be mentioned up front in the real estate contract, so the presence of these deficiencies would not be a reason for voiding the contract at or before the closing. If the liens are not cleared before by the time of the closing, then the deed should specifically have an exception(s) listed for the lien(s) not cleared.

The buyer(s) signing the real estate contract are liable (legally responsible) for providing the promised consideration for the real estate, which is typically money in the amount of the purchase price. However, the details about the type of ownership may not be specified in the contract. Sometimes, signing buyer(s) may direct a lawyer preparing the deed separately what type of ownership to list on the deed and may decide to add a joint owner(s), such as a spouse, to the deed. For example, types of joint ownership (title) may include tenancy in common, joint tenancy with right of survivorship, or joint tenancy by the entireties. Another possibility is ownership in trust instead of direct ownership.

===Contingencies===
Contingencies are conditions which must be met if a contract is to be performed.

Contingencies that suspend the contract until certain events occur are known as &quot;suspensive conditions&quot;. Contingencies that cancel the contract if certain event occur are known as &quot;resolutive conditions&quot;.

Most contracts of sale contain contingencies of some kind or another, because few people can afford to enter into a real estate purchase without them. But it is possible for a real estate contract not to have any contingencies.

Some types of contingencies which can appear in a real estate contract include:

*Mortgage contingency – Performance of the contract (purchase of the real estate) is &quot;contingent upon&quot; or &quot;subject to&quot; the buyer getting a mortgage loan for the purchase. Usually such a contingency calls for a buyer to apply for a loan within a certain period of time after the contract is signed. Since most people who buy a house require financing to complete their purchase, mortgage contingencies are one of the most common type of contingencies in real property contracts. If the financing is not secured, the buyer may unilaterally cancel the contract by stating that his or her condition has not or will not be satisfied or allow the contract to expire by declining to waive the condition within the specified time period.
*Inspection contingency – Another buyer&#x27;s condition. Purchase of the real estate is contingent upon a satisfactory inspection of the real property revealing no significant defects. Contingencies could also be made on the satisfactory repair of a certain item associated with the real estate.
*Another sale contingency – Purchase or sale of the real estate is contingent on a successful sale or purchase of another piece of real estate. The successful sale of another house may be needed to finance the purchase of a new one.
*Appraisal contingency – Purchase of the real estate is contingent upon the contract price being at or below a fair market value determined by an appraisal. Lenders will often not lend more than a certain percentage (fraction) of the appraised value, so such a contingency may be useful for a buyer.
*72-hour kick out contingency - Seller contingency, in which the seller accepts a contract from a buyer with a contingency (typically a home sale or rent contingency where the buyer conditions the sale on their ability to find a buyer or renter for their current property prior to settlement). The seller retains the right to sell the property to another party if he so chooses after giving the buyer 72 hours notice to remove their contingency. The buyer will then either remove their contingency and provide proof that they can consummate the sale or will release the seller from their contract and allow the seller to move forward with the new contract.

===Date of closing and possession===
A typical real estate contract specifies a date by which the closing must occur. The closing is the event in which the money (or other consideration) for the real estate is paid for and title (ownership) of the real estate is conveyed from the seller(s) to the buyer(s). The conveyance is done by the seller(s) signing a deed for buyer(s) or their attorneys or other agents to record the transfer of ownership. Often other paperwork is necessary at the closing.

The date of the closing is normally also the date when possession of the real estate is transferred from the seller(s) to the buyer(s). However, the real estate contract can specify a different date when possession changes hands. Transfer of possession of a house, condominium, or building is usually accomplished by handing over the key(s) to it. The contract may have provisions in case the seller(s) hold over possession beyond the agreed date.

The contract can also specify which party pays for what closing cost(s). If the contract does not specify, then there are certain customary defaults depending on law, common law (judicial precedents), location, and other orders or agreements, regarding who pays for which closing costs.

===Condition of property===
A real estate contract may specify in what condition of the property should be when conveying the title or transferring possession. For example, the contract may say that the property is sold as is, especially if demolition is intended. Alternatively there may be a representation or a warranty (guarantee) regarding the condition of the house, building, or some part of it such as affixed appliances, HVAC system, etc. Sometimes a separate disclosure form specified by a government entity is also used. The contract could also specify any personal property (non-real property) items which are to be included with the deal, such as washer and dryer which are normally detachable from the house. Utility meters, electrical wiring systems, fuse or circuit breaker boxes, plumbing, furnaces, water heaters, sinks, toilets, bathtubs, and most central air conditioning systems are normally considered to be attached to a house or building and would normally be included with the real property by default.

===Riders===
Riders (or addenda) are special attachments (separate sheets) that become part of the contract in certain situations.

===Earnest money deposit===
Although money is the most common consideration, it is not a required element to have a valid real estate contract. 
An earnest money deposit from the buyer(s) customarily accompanies an offer to buy real estate and the deposit is held by a third party, like a title company, attorney or sometimes the seller. The amount, a small fraction of the total price, is listed in the contract, with the remainder of the cost to be paid at the closing. In some rare cases, other instruments of value, like notes and/or stock or other negotiable instruments can be used for consideration. Other hard assets, like gold, silver and anything of value can also be used or in other cases, love (where it can be shown to have existed between the parties). However, the earnest money deposit represents a credit towards the final sales price, which is usually the main or only consideration.

==Financial qualifications of buyer(s)==
The better the financial qualification of the buyer(s) is, the more likely the closing will be successfully completed, which is typically the goal of the seller. Any documentation demonstrating financial qualifications of the buyer(s), such as mortgage loan pre-approval or pre-qualification, may accompany a real estate offer to buy along with an earnest money check. When there are competing offers or when a lower offer is presented, the seller may be more likely to accept an offer from a buyer demonstrating evidence of being well qualified than from a buyer without such evidence.

<text>A Lease-Purchase Contract, also known as a lease purchase agreement or rent-to-own agreement, allows consumers to obtain durable goods or rent-to-own real estate without entering into a standard credit contract. It is a shortened name for a lease with option to purchase contract. For real estate, a lease purchase contract combines elements of a traditional rental agreement with an exclusive right of first refusal option for later purchase of the home.

==Elements==

Elements of a lease purchase contract typically include:
* &quot;Property value&quot; - The agreed sale price of the property.
* &quot;Duration&quot; - The time frame of the agreement.
* &quot;Monthly payment&quot; - How much the lessor will be paying monthly.
* &quot;Rent credit&quot; - How much of the lessor&#x27;s monthly payment will go to the eventual purchase price at the end of the lease.
The contract will also generally include terms that relate to repairs and maintenance and, for real estate transactions, how such expenses such as property taxes and homeowner association fees will be paid.

==Transaction Structure==

In a standard Lease-Purchase Contract, the two parties agree to a lease period during which rent is paid, and the terms of the sale at the end of the lease period, including sale price. Often, the contract is structured in two parts, one representing the &quot;lease term&quot; and the other a &quot;contract of sale&quot;. 

As is usually stated in the lease purchase contract, the option fee and accrued rent credit are both non-refundable should the tenant/buyer decide to walk at the end of the lease. The tenant/buyer is released from responsibility for the sale, and the landlord/seller is responsible for finding new tenants.

In simpler terms a LOA or LPA is to take over a property for little to no money down as an agreement to pay for a property later giving the incentive of Guaranteed monthly payments to the other party so you can take control of a property and generate monthly income from it with the (option not the obligation) to buy the property in an average of 5-8 years time from the agreed upon deal. 

A LOA or LPA is an exceptionally popular property investment as you can profit by monthly rents from tenants and purchase the property at an agreed amount and then you can sell with a possible high profit from capital appreciation, pulling out all your money out having a maximum profit and an infinite ROI. 

A LOA/LPA is especially popular to people in the UK and has created hundreds of thousands of millionaires over the last 30+ years in the UK alone.

== Real estate ==

In real estate transactions, a lease purchase contract combines elements of a traditional rental agreement with an exclusive right of first refusal option for later purchase on the home.

The lease purchase agreement expounds upon what responsibilities the tenant/buyer and landlord/seller undertake during the course of the lease. This contract should describe any option fee and how much of the monthly payment will be credited to the down-payment for the purchase of the home at the end of the lease.

At the end of the lease-term, the tenant/buyer has the option to purchase the house. The lump sum accrued from the initial deposit and the rent credit are only released to the buyer as down-payment on the house should the tenant/buyer decide to proceed with the purchase. The tenant/buyer is responsible for securing the necessary mortgage loan to finalize the purchase of the home.

Should the tenant/buyer be unable to purchase the house due to a lack of financing, the tenant and landlord can agree to extend the option period, convert the lease purchase contract into a traditional rental agreement, or end the contract with the tenant moving out and the landlord seeking other renters or buyers.

==Benefits==

Lease-purchase contract agreements may meet the needs of a buyer and seller in a manner that cannot be accomplished through a traditional credit transaction. For example, lease-purchase contracts are popular with buyers who have poor credit scores, lower savings for down payments, or people who cannot qualify for a traditional loan at the time they need to acquire property.

==Controversy==

In the United States, when credits are applied to a purchase price the agreement becomes a financing contract and these contracts have been identified as predatory lending arrangements under the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this federal law any financing arrangement requires the purchaser of an owner occupied dwelling (one to four living units) is to qualify for any financing contract with a registered Mortgage Loan Originator. There are exemptions under this federal law for homeowners financing their primary residence, those in the business of real estate such as landlords are considered dealers. In all states, rent to own arrangements are no longer compliant with federal financing requirements.

Some vendors in rent-to-own transactions target vulnerable families for rent-to-own contracts, then threaten them with criminal charges in order to coerce payments that the families are struggling to afford.

For real estate transactions, alternative financing approaches such as lease-to-own carry fewer consumer protections than traditional financing, and typically involve a higher cost for the buyer.

Commercial loan arrangements are exempt from the Dodd-Frank Act, as a landlord might rent to own a property for the purpose of sub-letting to a tenant. This arrangement is not a popular arrangement but may be accomplished legally.

==Worldwide==

===New Zealand===

Auckland’s special housing area is subsidized by the Housing Foundation, providing homes for young families. Under their program, tenants pay rent on their homes for the first five years, then transition into paying mortgage payments. The Waimahia Inlet flagship development will see 282 new homes built over the next three years.

===Nigeria===

The Lagos State Home-Ownership Mortgage Scheme (LagosHOMS) is a rent-to-own housing program that targets people who currently cannot afford a mortgage, but given will be able to. Tenants are expected to pay rent for a period of time, after which they are invited to transition into mortgage payments. The program is designed with young professionals in mind, including teachers and junior public servants. The program has produced well over 200 new homeowners in the city.

<doc id="1056693" wikidata="Q5445191" url="?curid=1056693" title="Ferociously Stoned">
<text>Ferociously Stoned is the debut album by American band the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, released in November 1990 on Sub Par Records. It was subsequently re-released on the Daddies&#x27; own independent label Space Age Bachelor Pad Records in 1994.

==Composition==
Mixing thumping bass and heavy brass, &quot;Ferociously Stoned&quot; draws heavily from the punk rock and funk influences which dominated the Daddies&#x27; early music, though also features a prominent streak of the jazz and swing-inspired sounds which would soon become a hallmark of the band&#x27;s style. While the album is driven primarily by funk and swing, &quot;Ferociously Stoned&quot; also features experiments in psychedelic pop (&quot;The Lifeboat Mutiny&quot;), disco (&quot;Suicide Kings&quot;) and James Brown-style rhythm and blues (&quot;You Better Move&quot;).

==Release and reception==
Following the success of the Daddies&#x27; 1989 demo tape &quot;4 From On High&quot; which helped build the band a dedicated local cult following, &quot;Ferociously Stoned&quot; set a near-record for all-time advance sales in Eugene, Oregon&#x27;s record stores, coming in second only to R.E.M. Upon release, the album became a regional success, remaining for over a year on &quot;The Rocket&quot;″s Northwest Top Twenty list and receiving favorable reviews in &quot;The Oregonian&quot; and &quot;Alternative Press&quot;. At one point, the Daddies were planning an animated music video for the song &quot;Teenage Brainsurgeon&quot;, though ultimately scrapped the idea due to production costs.

&quot;Ferociously Stoned&quot; was originally released on vinyl and CD by independent label Sub Par Records, the vinyl cover depicting three bikini-clad women clutching stones against a backwards American flag, and the subsequent CD release featuring only the band&#x27;s name with censor bars over the words &quot;Cherry&quot; and &quot;Poppin&#x27;&quot;. In March 1991, when the Daddies had temporarily shortened their name to &quot;The Daddies&quot; to alleviate the controversy surrounding their name, the album was re-released with the shortened band name and new cover art featuring a skeleton in formal wear, modeled after the Grateful Dead″s &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; skeleton. In 1994, coinciding with the release of the Daddies&#x27; second album, &quot;Rapid City Muscle Car&quot;, &quot;Ferociously Stoned&quot; was re-issued on CD, restoring the band&#x27;s full name and including the tracks from their 1989 demo tape &quot;4 From On High&quot; as bonus content.

<doc id="1056696" wikidata="Q1426423" url="?curid=1056696" title="Cat People (1982 film)">
<text>Cat People is a 1982 American supernatural horror film directed by Paul Schrader and starring Nastassja Kinski, Malcolm McDowell, John Heard, and Annette O&#x27;Toole. Its plot follows a young woman who, upon reuniting with her brother, learns she has descended from werecats. It is a remake of 1942 film of the same name, and was produced by RKO Radio Pictures, the same studio that produced the original film.

Giorgio Moroder composed the film&#x27;s score (the second Schrader film to be scored by Moroder, after &quot;American Gigolo&quot;), including the theme song, which features lyrics and vocals by David Bowie. Jerry Bruckheimer served as an executive producer.

==Plot==
In an undisclosed, primitive human settlement, a sacrificial maiden is tied to a tree. A black panther approaches and rests its paws on her. Another girl with feline features approaches a similar big cat in a cave, without incurring its attack.

In the present, Irena Gallier travels to New Orleans from Canada to reconnect with her brother Paul. Irena was raised in foster care after they were orphaned. Paul, who spent his childhood in psych wards, is now involved in a church and lives with his Creole housekeeper Female (pronounced &quot;Femolly&quot;).

That night, a prostitute named Ruthie walks into a fleabag motel to meet a john, but instead finds a black panther that mauls her foot. The police and zoologists Oliver, Alice and Joe capture the panther. Meanwhile, Irena wakes to find Paul missing. Female deduces he went to the mission and urges Irena to enjoy New Orleans on her own.

Irena visits the zoo, is drawn to the newly captured panther and stays after closing hours. She is discovered by Oliver, the zoo&#x27;s curator, who takes her to dinner and offers her a job at the zoo&#x27;s gift shop. Irena reveals she is a virgin in conversation with Alice, who shares a romantic history (and is still in love) with Oliver and sees her as a rival. One day, the panther tears Joe&#x27;s arm off during a routine cage cleaning. Joe bleeds to death and Oliver resolves to euthanize the cat, only to find it missing. In its cage lies a puddle of melted flesh like the one found by the prostitute.

Paul turns up and makes a sexual advance towards Irena. She flees, flags down a police car and has second thoughts about turning Paul in, but a police dog catches a strong scent from the house and a detective is called in. In Paul&#x27;s basement, police find shackles, bones and remains of dozens of corpses. They figure Paul is a serial killer who fed corpses to a captive black panther, and call in Oliver and Alice to investigate. On the run from Paul, Irena takes refuge in a frustrated romance with Oliver, fearing the consequences of physical intimacy.

Paul visits Irena again and explains their shared werecat heritage, thus revealing himself as the escaped panther. Mating with a human transforms a werecat into a black panther, and only by killing a human can it regain human form. He tells her their parents were siblings because werecats are ancestrally incestuous and only mating between werecats prevents the transformation. Paul resumes his sexual advances, hoping Irena will accept their predicament, but she does not. Paul transforms, attacks Oliver and is shot by Alice. Oliver conducts a necropsy on Paul. A green gas emanates from the surgical cut and a human arm and hand reach up from within the corpse. Before Oliver can document this, Paul&#x27;s corpse melts into a pool of slime.

As Irena&#x27;s feline instincts gradually emerge, she stalks and nearly attacks Alice twice. She later sleeps with Oliver and transforms into a panther, but she flees, sparing his life, and is later trapped on a bridge by police. Oliver arrives in time to see her jump off the bridge. Realizing where she is headed, he confronts Irena at a secluded lake house. She has regained human form by killing the house&#x27;s caretaker. Irena tells Oliver she did not kill him because she loves him, and begs him to kill her. When he refuses, she begs him to have sex with her again so she can transform and &quot;be with [her] own kind&quot;. Oliver reluctantly agrees. He ties Irena naked to the bedposts by her arms and legs in preparation for when she changes into the panther. They then have sex one last time, as Irena begins to transform.

Some time later, Oliver is again in a one-sided relationship with Alice. He stops at the cage holding the &quot;recaptured panther&quot; – Irena, now permanently trapped in her panther form. Reaching through the bars, Oliver hand-feeds and strokes the now-docile Irena&#x27;s neck before she glances at him and roars.

==Cast==
==Themes==
Schrader has said, in relation to the erotic and horror aspects of &quot;Cat People&quot;, that the film &quot;contains more skin than blood&quot;. He has described the film as being more about the mythical than the realistic. He has likened the relation between Oliver and Irena to Dante and Beatrice, putting the female on a pedestal.

==Production==
===Development===
British-based American producer Milton Subotsky bought the rights to &quot;Cat People&quot; from RKO Pictures and began developing a remake. Subotsky eventually passed the property to Universal Pictures. Initially, Roger Vadim was set to be the director of the remake. Alan Ormsby, the screenwriter of the remake, stated that the film went through three earlier scripts, two of which were written by Bob Clark. According to Ormsby, Vadim was concerned that the film would appear sexist, as the woman who was sexually intense had to be destroyed. Ormsby changed this in the remake to have a male character who has the same problem.

===Filming===
In the early 1980s, Universal hired director Paul Schrader to direct the remake. The remake was announced and began shooting in April 1981. According to cinematographer John Bailey, Schrader paid homage to the stalking scene in the original with a scene featuring Annette O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s character jogging through a park as she appears to be stalked. Bailey and Schrader also remade the swimming pool scene. Bailey recalled that the two carefully studied the original scene, taking note of how the shadows reflected against the pool. Bailey stated that the pool sequence was the most similar of the homages, remarking that the primary reason for this was that &quot;we didn&#x27;t think we could do it any better&quot;.

The Blu-ray features interviews with Kinski, McDowell, Heard and O&#x27;Toole as well as director Schrader and composer Moroder. McDowell indicated that he was somewhat reluctant to make the film at first because he recalled the original film as &quot;not being very good&quot; but was convinced by Schrader&#x27;s take on the material with its focus on the erotic horror elements. McDowell also revealed that the scene where he leaps on the bed in a cat-like fashion was shot with him jumping off the bed. They then ran the film backward. Heard discussed how he almost turned down the role because he believed it was a porno movie. He also recalled that he felt very awkward, particularly during the nude scenes. O&#x27;Toole discussed the fact that they used cougars that were dyed black because leopards are impossible to train.

==Release==
The film was released theatrically in the United States by Universal Pictures on April 2, 1982.

===Home media===
The film has been released twice on DVD in the United States; once by Image Entertainment in 1997 and again by Universal in 
2002 on the film&#x27;s 20th Anniversary.

In January 2014, Scream Factory released the film in a collector&#x27;s edition package featuring both Blu-ray and DVD editions. On August 30, 2022, Scream Factory issued the film again in 4K UHD Blu-ray format. In their review of the 4K UHD Blu-ray, Chuck Bowen and Jake Cole of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; praised it as a significant upgrade from the prior release, writing that the 2014 Blu-ray &quot;suffered from extensive digital noise reduction that left many images flattened and waxy, but their UHD comes from a new 4K scan that more accurately captures the film’s earthen tones.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Cat People&quot; opened in 600 cinemas in the United States, and grossed $1,617,636 during its opening weekend, opening at number 10 at the box office. It earned an additional $1,502,216 during its second weekend, and $846,603 during its third weekend. It remained in distribution for 39 weeks, and concluded its theatrical run with a $7 million domestic gross. It earned an additional $14 million in international markets, making for a worldwide gross of $21 million.

===Critical response===
 
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated the film a three and a half out of four stars, stating: &quot;&quot;Cat People&quot; is a good movie in an old tradition, a fantasy-horror film that takes itself just seriously enough to work, has just enough fun to be entertaining, contains elements of intrinsic fascination in its magnificent black leopards, and ends in one way just when we were afraid it was going to end in another&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; also gave the film a positive rating by praising Nastassja Kinski&#x27;s performance: &quot;Kinski was essential to the film as conceived, and she&#x27;s endlessly watchable&quot;. Leonard Maltin awarded the film a mixed two out of a possible four stars, calling it &quot;sexy, bloody, technically well crafted, but uneven and ultimately unsatisfying&quot;.
However, Kinski stated, when being interviewed by her friend and actress Jodie Foster in &quot;Film Comment&quot;, that she disliked the film, describing it as &quot;slick&quot; and &quot;manipulative&quot;. This surprised Foster, who asserted she thoroughly enjoyed the film.

Christopher John of &quot;Ares&quot; magazine commented that &quot;&quot;Cat People&quot; is distinguished as one of the year&#x27;s top science fantasies for several reasons: aside from its superior camera work, tight story line and the rest, the movie told a story that mainstream filmmakers shy away from – a sexual story&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack album was released by MCA Records the same week as the film. The theme song, &quot;Cat People (Putting Out Fire)&quot;, was performed by David Bowie, who wrote the lyrics to music composed by Giorgio Moroder. The song was released as a single in 1982.

<doc id="1056700" wikidata="Q736922" url="?curid=1056700" title="Intimate relationship">
<text>An intimate relationship is an interpersonal relationship that involves emotional or physical closeness between people and may include sexual intimacy and feelings of romance or love. Intimate relationships are interdependent, and the members of the relationship mutually influence each other. The quality and nature of the relationship depends on the interactions between individuals, and is derived from the unique context and history that builds between people over time. Social and legal institutions such as marriage acknowledge and uphold intimate relationships between people. However, intimate relationships are not necessarily monogamous or sexual, and there is wide social and cultural variability in the norms and practices of intimacy between people.

The course of an intimate relationship includes a formation period prompted by interpersonal attraction and a growing sense of closeness and familiarity. Intimate relationships evolve over time as they are maintained, and members of the relationship may become more invested in and committed to the relationship. Healthy intimate relationships are beneficial for psychological and physical well-being and contribute to overall happiness in life. However, challenges including relationship conflict, external stressors, insecurity, and jealousy can disrupt the relationship and lead to distress and relationship dissolution.
== Intimacy ==
Intimacy is the feeling of being in close, personal association with another person. Emotional intimacy is built through self-disclosure and responsive communication between people, and is critical for healthy psychological development and mental health. Emotional intimacy produces feelings of reciprocal trust, validation, vulnerability, and closeness between individuals.

Physical intimacy—including holding hands, hugging, kissing, and sex—promotes connection between people and is often a key component of romantic intimate relationships. Physical touch is correlated with relationship satisfaction and feelings of love. While many intimate relationships include a physical or sexual component, the potential to be sexual is not a requirement for the relationship to be intimate. For example, a queerplatonic relationship is a non-romantic intimate relationship that involves commitment and closeness beyond that of a friendship.

Among scholars, the definition of an intimate relationship is diverse and evolving. Some reserve the term for romantic relationships, whereas other scholars include friendship and familial relationships. In general, an intimate relationship is an interpersonal relationship in which physically or emotionally intimate experiences occur repeatedly over time.

== Course of intimate relationships ==
=== Formation ===

==== Attraction ====
Interpersonal attraction is the foundation of first impressions between potential intimate partners. Relationship scientists suggest that the romantic spark, or &quot;chemistry&quot;, that occurs between people is a combination of physical attraction, personal qualities, and a build-up of positive interactions between people. Researchers find physical attractiveness to be the largest predictor of initial attraction. From an evolutionary perspective, this may be because people search for a partner (or potential mate) who displays indicators of good physical health. Yet, there is also evidence that couples in committed intimate relationships tend to match each other in physical attractiveness, and are rated as similarly physically attractive by both the members of the couple and by outside observers. An individual&#x27;s perception of their own attractiveness may therefore influence who they see as a realistic partner.

Beyond physical appearance, people report desirable qualities they look for in a partner such as trustworthiness, warmth, and loyalty. However, these romantic ideals are not necessarily good predictors of actual attraction or relationship success. Research has found little evidence for the success of matching potential partners based on personality traits, suggesting that romantic chemistry involves more than compatibility of traits. Rather, repeated positive interactions between people and reciprocity of romantic interest seem to be key components in attraction and relationship formation. Reciprocal liking is most meaningful when it is displayed by someone who is selective about who they show liking to.

==== Initiation strategies ====
When potential intimate partners are getting to know each other, they employ a variety of strategies to increase closeness and gain information about whether the other person is a desirable partner. Self-disclosure, the process of revealing information about oneself, is a crucial aspect of building intimacy between people. Feelings of intimacy increase when a conversation partner is perceived as responsive and reciprocates self-disclosure, and people tend to like others who disclose emotional information to them. Other strategies used in the relationship formation stage include humor, initiating physical touch, and signaling availability and interest through eye contact, flirtatious body language, or playful interactions. Engaging in dating, courtship, or hookup culture as part of the relationship formation period allows individuals to explore different interpersonal connections before further investing in an intimate relationship.

==== Context ====

Context, timing, and external circumstances influence attraction and whether an individual is receptive to beginning an intimate relationship. Individuals vary across the lifespan in feeling ready for a relationship, and other external pressures including family expectations, peers being in committed relationships, and cultural norms influence when people decide to pursue an intimate relationship.

Being in close physical proximity is a powerful facilitator for formation of relationships because it allows people to get to know each other through repeated interactions. Intimate partners commonly meet at college or school, as coworkers, as neighbors, at bars, or through religious community. Speed dating, matchmakers, and online dating services are more structured formats used to begin relationships. The internet in particular has significantly changed how intimate relationships begin as it allows people to access potential partners beyond their immediate proximity. In 2023, Pew Research Center found that 53% of people under 30 have used online dating, and one in ten adults in a committed relationship met their partner online. However, there remains skepticism about the effectiveness and safety of dating apps due to their potential to facilitate dating violence.

=== Maintenance ===
Once an intimate relationship has been initiated, the relationship changes and develops over time, and the members may engage in commitment agreements and maintenance behaviors. In an ongoing relationship, couples must navigate protecting their own self-interest alongside the interest of maintaining the relationship. This necessitates compromise, sacrifice, and communication. In general, feelings of intimacy and commitment increase as a relationship progresses, while passion plateaus following the excitement of the early stages of the relationship.

Engaging in ongoing positive shared communication and activities is important for strengthening the relationship and increasing commitment and liking between partners. These maintenance behaviors can include providing assurances about commitment to the relationship, engaging in shared activities, openly disclosing thoughts and feelings, spending time with mutual friends, and contributing to shared responsibilities. Physical intimacy including sexual behavior also increases feelings of closeness and satisfaction with the relationship. However, sexual desire is often greatest early in a relationship, and may wax and wane as the relationship evolves. Significant life events such as the birth of a child can drastically change the relationship and necessitate adaptation and new approaches to maintaining intimacy. The transition to parenthood can be a stressful period that is generally associated with a temporary decrease in healthy relationship functioning and a decline in sexual intimacy.

==== Commitment ====

As a relationship develops, intimate partners often engage in commitment agreements, ceremonies, and behaviors to signal their intention to remain in the relationship. This might include moving in together, sharing responsibilities or property, and getting married. These commitment markers increase relationship stability because they create physical, financial, and symbolic barriers and consequences to dissolving the relationship. In general, increases in relationship satisfaction and investment are associated with increased commitment.

==== Evaluating the relationship ====
Individuals in intimate relationships evaluate the relative personal benefits and costs of being in the relationship, and this contributes to the decision to stay or leave. The investment model of commitment is a theoretical framework that suggests that an evaluation of relationship satisfaction, relationship investment, and the quality of alternatives to the relationship impact whether an individual remains in a relationship.

Because relationships are rewarding and evolutionarily necessary, and rejection is a stressful process, people are generally biased toward making decisions that uphold and further facilitate intimate relationships. These biases can lead to distortions in the evaluation of a relationship. For instance, people in committed relationships tend to dismiss and derogate attractive alternative partners, thereby validating the decision to remain with their more attractive partner.

=== Dissolution ===
The decision to leave a relationship often involves an evaluation of levels of satisfaction and commitment in the relationship. Relationship factors such as increased commitment and feelings of love are associated with lower chances of breakup, whereas feeling ambivalent about the relationship and perceiving many alternatives to the current relationship are associated with increased chances of dissolution.

==== Predictors of dissolution ====
Specific individual characteristics and traits put people at greater risk for experiencing relationship dissolution. Individuals high in neuroticism (the tendency to experience negative emotions) are more prone to relationship dissolution, and research also shows small effects of attachment avoidance and anxiety in predicting breakup. Being married at a younger age, having lower income, lower educational attainment, and cohabiting before marriage are also associated with risk of divorce and relationship dissolution. These characteristics are not necessarily the inherent causes of dissolution. Rather, they are traits that impact the resources that individuals are able to draw upon to work on their relationships as well as reflections of social and cultural attitudes toward relationship institutions and divorce.

==== Strategies and consequences ====
Common strategies for ending a relationship include justifying the decision, apologizing, avoiding contact (ghosting), or suggesting a &quot;break&quot; period before revisiting the decision. The dissolution of an intimate relationship is a stressful event that can have a negative impact on well-being, and the rejection can elicit strong feelings of embarrassment, sadness, and anger. Following a relationship breakup, individuals are at risk for anxiety, depressive symptoms, problematic substance use, and low self-esteem. However, the period following a break-up can also promote personal growth, particularly if the previous relationship was not fulfilling.

== Benefits ==

=== Psychological well-being ===

Intimate relationships impact happiness and satisfaction with life. While people with better mental health are more likely to enter intimate relationships, the relationships themselves also have a positive impact on mental health even after controlling for the selection effect. In general, marriage and other types of committed intimate relationships are consistently linked to increases in happiness. Furthermore, due to the interdependent nature of relationships, one partner&#x27;s life satisfaction influences and predicts change in the other person&#x27;s life satisfaction even after controlling for relationship quality.

==== Social support ====
Social support from an intimate partner is beneficial for coping with stress and significant life events. Having a close relationship with someone who is perceived as responsive and validating helps to alleviate the negative impact of stress, and shared activities with an intimate partner aids in regulating emotions associated with stressful experiences. Support for positive experiences can also improve relationship quality and increase shared positive emotions between people. When a person responds actively and constructively to their partner sharing good news (a process called &quot;capitalization&quot;), well-being for both individuals increases.

==== Sexual intimacy ====
In intimate relationships that are sexual, sexual satisfaction is closely tied to overall relationship satisfaction. Sex promotes intimacy, increases happiness, provides pleasure, and reduces stress. Studies show that couples who have sex at least once per week report greater well-being than those who have sex less than once per week. Research in human sexuality finds that the ingredients of high quality sex include feeling connected to your partner, good communication, vulnerability, and feeling present in the moment. High quality sex in intimate relationships can both strengthen the relationship and improve well-being for each individual involved.

=== Physical health ===
High quality intimate relationships have a positive impact on physical health, and associations between close relationships and health outcomes involving the cardiovascular, immune, and endocrine systems have been consistently identified in the scientific literature. Better relationship quality is associated lower risk of mortality and relationship quality impacts inflammatory responses such as cytokine expression and intracellular signaling. Furthermore, intimate partners are an important source of social support for encouraging healthy behaviors such as increasing physical activity and quitting smoking. Sexual activity and other forms of physical intimacy also contribute positively to physical health, while conflict between intimate partners negatively impacts the immune and endocrine systems and can increase blood pressure.

Laboratory experiments show evidence for the association between support from intimate partners and physical health. In a study assessing recovery from wounds and inflammation, individuals in relationships high in conflict and hostility recovered from wounds more slowly than people in low-hostility relationships. The presence or imagined presence of an intimate partner can even impact perceived pain. In fMRI studies, participants who view an image of their intimate partner report less pain in response to a stimulus compared to participants who view the photo of a stranger. In another laboratory study, women who received a text message from their partner showed reduced cardiovascular response to the Trier Social Stress Test, a stress-inducing paradigm.

== Challenges ==

=== Conflict ===
Disagreements within intimate relationships are a stressful event, and the strategies couples use to navigate conflict impact the quality and success of the relationship. Common sources of conflict between intimate partners include disagreements about the balance of work and family life, frequency of sex, finances, and household tasks. Psychologist John Gottman&#x27;s research has identified three stages of conflict in couples. First, couples present their opinions and feelings on the issue. Next, they argue and attempt to persuade the other of their viewpoint, and finally, the members of the relationship negotiate to try to arrive at a compromise.

Individuals vary in how they typically engage with conflict. Gottman describes that happy couples differ from unhappy couples in their interactions during conflict: unhappy couples tend to use more frequent negative tone of voice, show more predictable behavior during communication, and get stuck in cycles of negative behavior with their partner. Other unproductive strategies within conflict include avoidance and withdrawal, defensiveness, and hostility. These responses may be salient when an individual feels threatened by the conflict, which can be a reflection of insecure attachment orientation and previous negative relationship experiences. When conflicts go unresolved, relationship satisfaction is negatively impacted. Constructive conflict resolution strategies include validating the other person&#x27;s point of view and concerns, expressing affection, using humor, and active listening. However, the effectiveness of these strategies depend on the topic and severity of the conflict and the characteristics of the individuals involved. Repeated stressful instances of unresolved conflict might cause intimate partners to seek couples counseling, consult self-help resources, or consider ending the relationship.

=== Attachment insecurity ===
Attachment orientations that develop from early interpersonal relationships can influence how people behave in intimate relationships, and insecure attachment can lead to specific issues in a relationship. Individuals vary in attachment anxiety (the degree to which they worry about abandonment) and avoidance (the degree to which they avoid emotional closeness). Research shows that insecure attachment orientations that are high in avoidance or anxiety are associated with experiencing more frequent negative emotions in intimate relationships.

Individuals high in attachment anxiety are particularly prone to jealousy and experience heightened distress about whether their partner will leave them. Highly anxious individuals also perceive more conflict in their relationships and are disproportionately negatively affected by those conflicts. In contrast, avoidantly attached individuals may experience fear of intimacy or be dismissive of the potential benefits of a close relationship and thus have difficulty building an intimate connection with a partner.

=== Stress ===
Stress that occurs both within and outside an intimate relationship—including financial issues, familial obligations, and stress at work—can negatively impact the quality of the relationship. Stress depletes the psychological resources that are crucial for developing and maintaining a healthy relationship. Rather than spending energy investing in the relationship through shared activities, sex and physical intimacy, and healthy communication, couples under stress are forced to use their psychological resources to manage other pressing issues. Low socioeconomic status is a particularly salient stressful context that constrains an individual&#x27;s ability to invest in maintaining a healthy intimate relationship. Couples with lower socioeconomic status are at risk for experiencing increased rates of dissolution and lower relationship satisfaction.

=== Infidelity ===
Infidelity and sex outside a monogamous relationship are behaviors that are commonly disapproved of, a frequent source of conflict, and a cause of relationship dissolution. Low relationship satisfaction may cause people to desire physical or emotional connection outside their primary relationship. However, people with more sexual opportunities, greater interest in sex, and more permissive attitudes toward sex are also more likely to engage in infidelity. In the United States, research has found that between 15 and 25% of adults report ever cheating on a partner.

When one member of a relationship violates agreements of sexual or emotional exclusivity, the foundation of trust in the primary relationship is negatively impacted, and individuals may experience depression, low self-esteem, and emotional dysregulation in the aftermath of an affair. Infidelity is ultimately tied to increased likelihood of relationship dissolution or divorce.

=== Intimate partner violence ===
Violence within an intimate relationship can take the form of physical, psychological, financial, or sexual abuse. The World Health Organization estimates that 30% of women have experienced physical or sexual violence perpetrated by an intimate partner. The strong emotional attachment, investment, and interdependence that characterizes close relationships can make it difficult to leave an abusive relationship.

Research has identified a variety of risk factors for and types of perpetrators of intimate partner violence. Individuals who are exposed to violence or experience abuse in childhood are more likely to become perpetrators or victims of intimate partner violence as adults as part of the intergenerational cycle of violence. Perpetrators are also more likely to be aggressive, impulsive, prone to anger, and may show pathological personality traits such as antisocial and borderline traits. Patriarchal cultural scripts that depict men as aggressive and dominant may be an additional risk factor for men engaging in violence toward an intimate partner, although violence by female perpetrators is also a well-documented phenomenon and research finds other contextual and demographic characteristics to be more salient risks factors. Contextual factors such as high levels of stress can also contribute to risk of violence. Within the relationship, high levels of conflict and disagreements are associated with intimate partner violence, particularly for people who react to conflict with hostility.

== Social and cultural variability ==

=== Culture ===
Cultural context has influence in many domains within intimate relationships including norms in communication, expression of affection, commitment and marriage practices, and gender roles. For example, cross-cultural research finds that individuals in China prefer indirect and implicit communication with their romantic partner, whereas European Americans report preferring direct communication. The use of a culturally appropriate communication style influences anticipated relationship satisfaction. Culture can also impact expectations within a relationship and the relative importance of various relationship-centered values such as emotional closeness, equity, status, and autonomy.

While love has been identified as a universal human emotion, the ways love is expressed and its importance in intimate relationships vary based on the culture within which a relationship takes place. Culture is especially salient in structuring beliefs about institutions that recognize intimate relationships such as marriage. The idea that love is necessary for marriage is a strongly held belief in the United States, whereas in India, a distinction is made between traditional arranged marriages and &quot;love marriages&quot; (also called personal choice marriages).

=== LGBTQ+ intimacy ===

==== Same-sex intimate relationships ====
Advances in legal relationship recognition for same-sex couples have helped normalize and legitimize same-sex intimacy. Broadly, same-sex and different-sex intimate relationships do not differ significantly, and couples report similar levels of relationship satisfaction and stability. However, research supports a few common differences between same-sex and different-sex intimacy. In the relationship formation period, the boundaries between friendship and romantic intimacy may be more nuanced and complex among sexual minorities. For instance, many lesbian women report that their romantic relationships developed from an existing friendship. Certain relationship maintenance practices also differ. While heterosexual relationships might rely on traditional gender roles to divide labor and decision-making power, same-sex couples are more likely to divide housework evenly. Lesbian couples report lower frequency of sex compared to heterosexual couples, and gay men are more likely to engage in non-monogamy.

Same-sex relationships face unique challenges with regards to stigma, discrimination, and social support. As couples cope with these obstacles, relationship quality can be negatively affected. Unsupportive policy environments such as same-sex marriage bans have a negative impact on well-being, while being out as a couple and living in a place with legal same-sex relationship recognition have a positive impact on individual and couple well-being.

==== Asexuality ====
Some asexual people engage in intimate relationships that are solely emotionally intimate, but other asexual people&#x27;s relationships involve sex as part of negotiations with non-asexual partners. A 2019 study of sexual minority individuals in the United States found that while asexual individuals were less likely to have recently had sex, they did not differ from non-asexual participants in rates of being in an intimate relationship. Asexual individuals face stigma and the pathologization of their sexual orientation, and report difficulty navigating assumptions about sexuality in the dating scene. Various terms including &quot;queerplatonic relationship&quot; and &quot;squish&quot; (a non-sexual crush) have been used by the asexual community to describe non-sexual intimate relationships and desires.

=== Non-monogamy ===
Non-monogamy, including polyamory, open relationships, and swinging, is the practice of engaging in intimate relationships that are not strictly monogamous, or consensually engaging in multiple physically or emotionally intimate relationships. The degree of emotional and physical intimacy between different partners can vary. For example, swinging relationships are primarily sexual, whereas people in polyamorous relationships might engage in both emotional and physical intimacy with multiple partners. Individuals in consensually non-monogamous intimate relationships identify several benefits to their relationship configuration including having their needs met by multiple partners, engaging in a greater variety of shared activities with partners, and feelings of autonomy and personal growth.

<text>Stevan Moljević (6 January 1888 – 15 November 1959) was a Yugoslav and Serbian politician, lawyer and publicist, president of the Yugoslav-French Club, president of the Yugoslav-British Club, president of Rotary International Club of Yugoslavia and member of the Central National Committee of Yugoslavia (CNK) in World War II. In his 1941 memorandum &quot;Homogeneous Serbia&quot;, Moljević advocated the creation of the Greater Serbia and its ethnic cleansing of the non-Serb population.

After the war, Moljević was sentenced to 20 years for war crimes and treason. He died in prison in 1959.

==Early life==
Stevan Moljević was born to Jovan and Mirjana (Miriam) Moljević (K&quot;ohen&quot;) on 6 January 1888 in Rudo, Austria-Hungary. He finished primary school in the town and later joined Young Bosnia, a revolutionary movement which aimed to unite all South Slavs into one common state. He was arrested by Austro-Hungarian authorities in 1910 after a member of Young Bosnia attempted to assassinate Marijan Varešanin, the region&#x27;s governor. In 1915, Moljević was arrested and charged with treason by Austro-Hungarian authorities. He was found guilty of treason and sentenced to ten years of hard labour. He was released from prison after Austria-Hungary&#x27;s collapse in 1918, and was later awarded the French Legion of Honour and Serbian Order of St. Sava.

Moljević obtained a law degree at the University of Zagreb before moving to Banja Luka, where he worked as an attorney prior to the outbreak of World War II. He was also the head of the local branch of the Serbian Cultural Club. Moljević was married and had two children.

==World War II==
Moljević left Banja Luka on 10 April 1941, the day that the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) was proclaimed, and fled to Montenegro. On 30 June, he wrote a memorandum in Montenegro calling for the creation of Homogeneous Serbia. This enlarged Serbian state was to include Central Serbia, Vojvodina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dalmatia, Slavonia and northern Albania, as well as parts of Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Moljević proposed dividing a rump Croatia into two parts and enlarging Slovenia with territories annexed from Italy and Austria. He believed that Serbs should not repeat the mistakes of World War I by failing to define the borders of Serbia, and proposed that at the end of World War II they should take control of all territories to which they laid claim, and from that position negotiate the form of a federally organized Yugoslavia. This plan required the relocation of non-Serbs from Serb-controlled territories and other shifts of populations. Moljević proposed that Greater Serbia consist of 65–70% of the total Yugoslav territory and population. He based his plan on the expulsion of the non-Serb population in different areas and on population exchanges, but did not provide any figures. Moljević&#x27;s proposals were very similar to those later formulated by the Belgrade Chetnik Committee and presented to the government-in-exile in September 1941, in which the Chetniks set forth specific figures in regard to population shifts.

In August 1941, Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović named Moljević to the Central National Committee. Moljević became one of the three most important members of the committee, the other two being the lawyers Dragiša Vasić and Mladen Žujović. The three men formed Mihailović&#x27;s so-called Executive Council for much of the war. The Central Committee advised Mihailović on matters of domestic and international politics and maintained liaison with civilian followers of the Chetniks in Serbia and other regions.

Moljević wrote to Vasić in December 1941 and outlined his plan for the cleansing of Yugoslavia of all non-Serbian elements by Serbian refugees. He stated that Serbs should take control of &quot;all strategic points&quot; in Yugoslavia and claimed that a large Serbian state was what Serbs had been fighting for since the time of Karađorđe. In February 1942, Vasić received a letter from Moljević concerning the creation of a Greater Serbia stretching to Dalmatia and the Adriatic coast. Moljević wrote that the &quot;cleansing&quot; () of all non-Serbs would be needed if such a state was to survive. He stated that Croats should be deported to Croatia and Muslims to Albania or Turkey. Moljević came to Chetnik headquarters of Draža Mihailović in May 1942. He was then included in activities of CNK whose members were already Dragiša Vasić and Mladen Žujović.

In 1943, Moljević usurped Vasić as head of the Central National Committee. John R. Lampe pointed to significant details such as that the Central National Committee had secondary status while Moljević did not rise to prominence in this committee until 1943, which undercut the perception about Moljević&#x27;s &quot;Homogeneous Serbia&quot; being the centerpiece of coherent set of Chetnik war objectives.

He attended the Ba Congress in January 1944, where he delivered a report concerning the condition of the Chetniks within Yugoslavia. Following Belgrade&#x27;s capture by communist forces, Moljević visited Bosanska Krajina and appealed to its inhabitants for support. He also called for Bosnian Muslims and Croats to join the Chetniks in fighting the Yugoslav Partisans.

==Capture, imprisonment and death==
Moljević was arrested by the Yugoslav Partisan forces on 23 September 1945 and tried alongside Mihailović and twenty-two others in the summer of 1946 on grounds of collaborationism and organized insurrection. He was found guilty of collaboration with the Axis powers and sentenced to a twenty-year imprisonment. The communists stripped him of all his political and civic rights and all of his property and belongings were confiscated. Moljević was sent to the northern Serbian town of Sremska Mitrovica and was imprisoned there. His health began to deteriorate in 1956 and the following year he was diagnosed with colon cancer. He underwent an unsuccessful operation in Belgrade before being sent back to Sremska Mitrovica Prison, where he died on 15 November 1959. He was buried at Novo groblje cemetery in Belgrade.
== Bibliography ==
In 2019 a group of historians published a book authored by Moljević, based on his handwritten scripts, titled &quot;Ravna Gora u svetlu i magli&quot; (). The scripts were published together with other documents he authored earlier. Moljević secretly wrote these scripts on a toilet paper during his imprisonment. They remained hidden in the wall, under the wooden window, and kept in the archives after they have been found.

<doc id="1056709" wikidata="Q1359737" url="?curid=1056709" title="John Colter">
<text>John Colter (c.1770–1775 – May 7, 1812 or November 22, 1813) was a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–1806). Though party to one of the more famous expeditions in history, Colter is best remembered for explorations he made during the winter of 1807–1808, when he became the first known person of European descent to enter the region which later became Yellowstone National Park and to see the Teton Mountain Range. Colter spent months alone in the wilderness and is widely considered to be the first known mountain man.

==Early life==
John Colter was born in Stuarts Draft, Colony of Virginia in 1774, based on assumptions by his family. There is some debate as to which variation of the family name, Coalter, Coulter, or Colter, is correct, and the issue was further convoluted by William Clark utilizing all three spelling variations during his daily journals. It is unknown whether Colter was literate or knew how to write. Two signatures possessed by the Missouri State Historical Society assert that the proper spelling of the family name was &quot;Colter&quot; and that Colter was at least able to write his own name. Sometime around 1780, the Colter family moved west and settled near present-day Maysville, Kentucky. As a young man Colter may have served as a ranger under Simon Kenton.

==Lewis and Clark Expedition==
John Colter, along with George Shannon and Patrick Gass, joined the expedition while Lewis was waiting for the completion of their vessels in Pittsburgh and nearby Elizabeth, Pennsylvania. The outdoor skills he had developed from this frontier lifestyle impressed Meriwether Lewis, and on October 15, 1803, Lewis offered Colter the rank of private and a pay of five dollars per month when he was recruited to join what became the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The expedition arrived at the Mississippi River in November and in December established its 1803-1804 winter camp at Wood River, north of St. Louis. While Lewis and Clark were away from camp making preparations, Colter and three other recruits disobeyed Lewis’ orders, leaving the camp to go to a whiskey shop. Upon his return, Lewis disciplined Colter and the others with ten days’ confinement to quarters. Soon thereafter, Colter was court-martialed after threatening to shoot sergeant John Ordway. After a review of the situation, Colter was reinstated after he offered an apology and promised to reform.

Colter was considered to be one of the best hunters in the group and was routinely sent out alone to scout the surrounding countryside for game meat. Colter was often trusted with responsibilities that went beyond hunting and woodsman activities. He was instrumental in helping the expedition find passes through the Rocky Mountains. In one instance, Colter was handpicked by Clark to deliver a message to Lewis, waylaid at a Shoshone camp, concerning the impracticability of following a route along the Salmon River. In another instance he was charged with retracing a route in the Bitterroot Mountains to recover lost horses and supplies, and not only returned with some of the recovered resources and horses but also retrieved deer to gift the hospitable Nez Perce tribes and strengthen sick corp members. Colter was noted by Lewis for his ability to barter with various tribes, an attribute which may have led to his later role with Manuel Lisa.

Colter never appeared on sick lists, suggesting very advantageous health. He was often one of the few hunters allowed to leave the camp during points of illness and recuperation, showing Lewis and Clark&#x27;s confidence in him. Another major contribution Colter made to the Corps of Discovery was providing the expedition with the means to swiftly descend the Bitterroot Mountains, allowing access to the Snake River, Columbia River, and subsequently the Pacific Ocean. While hunting far ahead of the main party, Colter encountered three Tushepawe Flatheads. Through non-verbal peace symbols and communication, Colter was able to persuade the Flatheads to abandon their search for two Shoshones who had stolen 23 head of horses and accompany him to the expedition&#x27;s camp. One of the young Flatheads agreed to act as the party&#x27;s guide down the mountains and through Flathead country, a great advantage in challenging and unfamiliar terrain plagued by a scarcity of game. Once at the mouth of the Columbia River, Colter was among a small group selected to venture to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, as well as explore the seacoast north of the Columbia into present-day Washington state.

After traveling thousands of miles, in 1806 the expedition returned to the Mandan villages in present-day North Dakota. There, they encountered Forrest Hancock and Joseph Dickson, two frontiersmen who were headed into the upper Missouri River country in search of beaver furs. On August 13, 1806, Lewis and Clark permitted Colter to be honorably discharged almost two months early so that he could lead the two trappers back to the region they had explored. Upon his discharge, Colter had earned payment for 35 months and 26 days, totaling $179.33 1/3rd dollars. However, a discrepancy in the books provided Colter with payment for the two months he had skipped to accompany Hancock and Dickson trapping. This over-payment may have been justified by Colter&#x27;s significant work ethic and personal praise by Thomas Jefferson himself. In 1807, Colter&#x27;s settlement was retracted after Congress passed a mandate supplying all members of the Corps of Discovery with doubled wages and land grants of 320 acres. Lewis personally took responsibility for Colter&#x27;s reparations, and following Lewis&#x27; death and Colter&#x27;s subsequent return to St. Louis, a court decided Colter was owed an amount of $377.60.

==Mountain man beginnings==
Colter, Hancock, and Dixon ventured into the wilderness with 20 beaver traps, a two-year supply of ammunition, and numerous other small tools gifted to them by the expedition such as knives, rope, hatchets, and personal utensils. The route of the trapping party is not known. It is speculated that unfriendly Blackfeet in the region of the Lower Missouri and a lack of horses forced the company to seek their fortunes in the tributaries of the less-prosperous Yellowstone Valley, a region inhabited by the friendlier Crows. The dangers of the narrow and rapid Yellowstone River and the absence of game may explain the quick dissolution of the trapping party.

After reaching a point where the Gallatin, Jefferson and Madison Rivers meet, known today as Three Forks, Montana, the trio managed to maintain their partnership for only about two months. There is much speculation as to where the party, at that point only consisting of Colter and Hancock following a falling out with Dixon, spent the winter of 1806–1807. However, Wyoming historian J.K. Rollinson asserts in a personal letter that he had met the stepson of one of Colter&#x27;s companions, mostly likely Hancock&#x27;s as Dixon is known to have left the region for Wisconsin in 1827. This stepson, Dave Fleming, accompanied his stepfather on a hunting trip to Clark&#x27;s Fork Canyon as a boy and was informed that his stepfather had made camp in this exact spot while trapping with Colter many years earlier. Fleming reportedly remembered and passed on this detail as his stepfather asserted that during winter of 1806–1807, Colter had grown restless with taking shelter and ascended the canyon into the Sunlight Basin of modern-day Wyoming, which would make him the first known white man to have ever entered this region.

Colter headed back toward civilization in 1807 and was near the mouth of the Platte River when he encountered Manuel Lisa, a founder of the Missouri Fur Trading Company, who was leading a party that included several former members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, towards the Rocky Mountains. Among the band were George Drouillard, John Potts, and Peter Weiser. Colter once again decided to return to the wilderness, even though he was only a week from reaching St. Louis. At the confluence of the Yellowstone and Bighorn Rivers, Colter helped build Fort Raymond and was later sent by Lisa to search out the Crow Indian tribe to investigate the opportunities of establishing trade with them.

==Yellowstone, Grand Teton and Jackson Hole==

Colter left Fort Raymond in October 1807 and traveled over to establish trade with the Crow nation. Over the course of the winter, he explored the region that later became Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. Colter reportedly visited at least one geyser basin, though it is now believed that he most likely was near present-day Cody, Wyoming, which at that time may have had some geothermal activity to the immediate west. Colter probably passed along portions of the shores of Jackson Lake after crossing the Continental Divide near Togwotee Pass or more likely, Union Pass in the northern Wind River Range. Colter then explored Jackson Hole below the Teton Range, later crossing Teton Pass into Pierre&#x27;s Hole, known today as the Teton Basin in the state of Idaho. After heading north and then east, he is believed to have encountered Yellowstone Lake, another location in which he had seen geysers and other geothermal features. Colter then proceeded back to Fort Raymond, arriving in March or April 1808. Not only had Colter traveled hundreds of miles, much of the time unguided, he did so in the dead of winter, in a region in which nighttime temperatures in January are routinely .

Colter arrived back at Fort Raymond, and few believed his reports of geysers, bubbling mudpots and steaming pools of water. His reports of these features were often ridiculed at first, and the region was somewhat jokingly referred to as &quot;Colter&#x27;s Hell&quot;. It is commonly believed that Colter&#x27;s Hell referred to the region of the Stinking Water, now known as the Shoshone River, particularly the section running through Cody. The river&#x27;s original title was thanks to presence of sulphur in the surrounding area. His detailed exploration of this region is the first by a white man of what later became the state of Wyoming.
==Colter&#x27;s Route==
It is not known if Colter produced his own crude map that informed Clark&#x27;s version or if the details were simply dictated to Clark by Colter following his return to St. Louis after a six-year absence. Colter&#x27;s Route was included in a version of Clark&#x27;s map, titled &quot;A Map of Lewis and Clark&#x27;s Track Across the Western Portion of North America from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean,&quot; which was published in 1814. Clark&#x27;s original field sketches, drawn on numerous separate sheets that traced the flows of principal rivers as opposed to traditional rectangular or square maps, were shown to President Jefferson in 1807 and did not include Colter&#x27;s Route, as he was still traveling at the time. A version of these original field maps was produced in 1810 by Clark and Nicholas Biddle so that inaccurate recordings of latitude and longitude could be corrected by astronomer and mathematician Ferdinand Hassler. This 1810 manuscript provided the details of Colter&#x27;s Route that were published in 1814. Several unexplained geographical discrepancies were printed on the 1814 map, including the Big Horn Mountains and basin being drawn about two times too large, an error believed to be Clark&#x27;s. The nature behind these discrepancies eludes historians, as Clark had not only his own personal information of the region but information from George Drouillard and John Colter as well. It is likely that Colter never saw Clark&#x27;s full field maps, as another major discrepancy places Colter&#x27;s starting point at the midsection of Pryor Creek, as opposed to only geographically likely departing point at the mouth of the Big Horn River. The inaccuracies that plague the 1814 map&#x27;s details of the area between Manuel&#x27;s Fort on the Yellowstone and the likely location of Colter&#x27;s Hell have fueled much of the scholarly disagreements surrounding Colter&#x27;s Route.

==Colter&#x27;s Run==
The following year, Colter teamed up with John Potts, another former member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, once again in the region near Three Forks, Montana. In 1808, Colter and Potts set out from Fort Raymond to negotiate trade agreements with local nations. While leading a group of 800 Flathead and Crow Indians back to the trading fort, Colter&#x27;s party was attacked by over 1,500 Blackfeet. The Flatheads and Crows managed to force the Blackfeet into retreat, but Colter suffered a leg wound from either a bullet or arrow. This wound was not serious as Colter quickly recuperated and left Fort Raymond with Potts once more the following year.

In 1809, another altercation with the Blackfeet resulted in Potts&#x27; death and Colter&#x27;s capture. While going by canoe up the Jefferson River, Potts and Colter encountered several hundred Blackfeet who demanded they come ashore. Colter went ashore and was disarmed and stripped naked. When Potts refused to come ashore, he was shot and wounded. Potts then shot one of the Indian warriors and was instantly pierced with arrows so numerous, that, to use the language of Colter, &quot;he was made a riddle of.&quot; His body was brought ashore and hacked to pieces. After a council, Colter was told to leave and encouraged to run. It soon became apparent that he was running for his life pursued by a group of Indians. A fast runner, after several miles the naked Colter was exhausted and bleeding from his nose but far ahead of most of the group with only one assailant still close to him. He then managed to overcome the lone man:

Colter took a blanket from the Indian he had killed. Continuing his run with a pack of Indians following, he reached the Madison River, from his start, and hiding inside a beaver lodge, escaped capture. Emerging at night he climbed and walked for eleven days to a trader&#x27;s fort on the Little Big Horn.

In 1810, Colter assisted in the construction of another fort located at Three Forks, Montana. After returning from gathering fur pelts, he discovered that two of his partners had been killed by the Blackfeet. This event convinced Colter to leave the wilderness for good, and he returned to St. Louis before the end of 1810. He had been away from civilization for almost six years.

==Final years and death==
After returning to St. Louis, Colter married a woman named Sallie and purchased a farm near Miller&#x27;s Landing, Missouri, now New Haven, Missouri. Around 1810, he visited with William Clark and provided detailed reports of his explorations since they had last met. From this information, Clark created a map which, despite its previously mentioned discrepancies, was the most comprehensive map produced of the region of the explorations for the next 75 years. During the War of 1812, Colter enlisted and fought with Nathan Boone&#x27;s Rangers. Sources are unclear about when Colter died or the cause of death. One report states that after suddenly turning ill, Colter died of jaundice on May 7, 1812, and was buried near Miller&#x27;s Landing. Other sources indicate he died on November 22, 1813.

==Legacy==
Colter&#x27;s legacy has had a profound impact on the image of the American West and frontier, with Colter&#x27;s Run seeing many incarnations and recreations, including a retelling by Washington Irving. The stereotypes of reclusive frontier mountain men may be thanks to Nicholas Biddle&#x27;s written characterizations of Colter, which paint him a man easily beguiled by the trapping prospects of the wilderness and intimidated by the possibility of returning to regular society. Because no written materials attributed to Colter have ever been discovered (besides his signature,) Biddle&#x27;s characterizations cannot be directly contested.

Traditionally, it is thought that Lewis and Clark&#x27;s Expedition played a major role in heightening tensions between white explorers and the Blackfeet Indians. Despite this notion, Manuel Lisa&#x27;s party originally interacted peacefully with the Blackfeet. However, it was after Colter and Potts were forced to battle the Blackfeet alongside the Flatheads and Crows that the relations between white explorers/trappers and the Blackfeet nation seemed to deteriorate. This led Major Biddle and many other frontiersman to draw the conclusion that Colter had actually upset relations with the Blackfeet, which was only expounded upon by the notoriety of Colter&#x27;s Run.

Numerous locations in northwestern Wyoming have been named after him, notably Colter Bay on Jackson Lake in Grand Teton National Park and Colter Peak in the Absaroka Mountains in Yellowstone National Park. A plaque commemorating Colter was displayed at a roadside pulloff on U.S. Route 340 just east of Stuarts Draft, near his birthplace. When the road was widened in 1998, the plaque was moved just north of the intersection of 340 and Route 608. A Kentucky historical marker commemorating Colter as one of the Lewis and Clark Expedition&#x27;s &quot;nine young men from Kentucky&quot; is located in Maysville, Kentucky.

==Popular culture==
* The first motion picture about John Colter&#x27;s life was the 1912 silent film, &quot;John Colter&#x27;s Escape&quot;.
* The original script for director Cornel Wilde&#x27;s 1965 movie &quot;The Naked Prey&quot; was largely based on Colter being pursued by Blackfeet Indians in Montana. Films such as &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Mountain Men&quot; (1980) have incidents closely based upon Colter&#x27;s Run. A. B. Guthrie Jr.&#x27;s 1947 story &quot;Mountain Medicine&quot; is a fictionalized account of Colter&#x27;s Run.
* The TV series (2022) &quot;Into the Wild Frontier&quot; has one episode devoted to John Colter. Season 1, Episode 1: John Colter: King of the Mountain Men, 43 minutes.

== Colter Stone ==

Sometime between 1931 and 1933, an Idaho farmer named William Beard and his son discovered a rock carved into the shape of a man&#x27;s head while clearing a field in Tetonia, Idaho, which is immediately west of the Teton Range. The rhyolite lava rock is long, wide and thick and has the words &quot;John Colter&quot; carved on the right side of the face and the number &quot;1808&quot; on the left side and has been dubbed the &quot;Colter Stone&quot;. The stone was reportedly purchased from the Beards in 1933 by A.C. Lyon, who presented it to Grand Teton National Park in 1934.

Fritiof Fryxell, noted mountain climber of numerous Teton Range peaks, geologist and Grand Teton National Park naturalist, concluded that the stone had weathering that indicated that the inscriptions were likely made in the year indicated. Fryxell also believed that the Beards were not familiar with John Colter or his explorations. However the stone has not been fully authenticated to have been carved by Colter. If the stone is an actual carving made by Colter, in the year inscribed, it would coincide with the period he is known to have been in the region, and that he did cross the Teton Range and descend into Idaho, as descriptions he dictated to William Clark indicate.

Another possible artifact of Colter&#x27;s was discovered within Yellowstone National Park in the 1880s. A log with the carved initials &quot;J C&quot; underneath a large X was discovered by Philip Ashton Rollins near Coulter Creek, a coincidentally named stream of no relation to Colter. Rollins and his party determined that the carving was roughly eighty years old. The artifact was lost by Yellowstone employees around 1890 while being transferred to the park museum.

<text>Private John Shields (c1769–1809) was, at about 35 years old, the second oldest member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and its oldest enlisted member. Shields, born in Virginia&#x27;s Shenandoah Valley, moved at about 14 years old to the wilderness of Tennessee, helped build and lived in a family fort that provided protection from Native Americans, traveled with Captain Meriwether Lewis, Second Lieutenant William Clark, and Native American Sacagawea to the Oregon Coast where he helped build Fort Clatsop, and then returned to St. Louis, Missouri. At the completion of this great adventure Shields hunted and trapped with the famous American pioneer Daniel Boone.

== Early life ==

Shields was born about 1769 Virginia&#x27;s Shenandoah Valley. He was born in what was then Augusta County, but is now Rockingham County, Virginia. He was one of twelve children of Robert Shields and Nancy Stockton. Robert and Nancy Stockton Shields are known as the &quot;Parents of the Ten Brothers.&quot; Richard, David and William were all elder siblings, followed by John himself, James, Joseph, Arnett, Ezekial (who did not survive his first year), Benjamin, Joshua and Robert. Jennet, the only daughter, married Joshua Tipton. Their son, John Tipton, became a brigadier general and later a US Senator for the state of Indiana. In about 1784 the Shields family moved from Virginia to what is now Sevier County, Tennessee, and settled on the south side of the French Broad River. John and his brothers helped his parents to build Shields Fort, which is located where modern-day Pigeon Forge is, near where the Dollywood theme park currently stands. Some of the cabins found in Cades Cove near Pigeon Forge were also built by the Shields family.

== Family ==
In about 1790 John Shields married Nancy White. Their daughter, Martha Jennette, married her 1st cousin John Tipton. He became a brigadier general and a US Senator for the state of Indiana. The Shields family and the Tipton family were neighbors in the 1790s when they lived in what is now Sevier County, Tennessee. John Tipton was a son of Joshua and Jennet Shields Tipton.
== Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition ==

Shields was a private for the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition from October 19, 1803, until October 10, 1806. Despite the captains&#x27; rule that they would only consider unmarried men for the exploring enterprise, they recruited Shields. He acted as a gunsmith, blacksmith, hunter, and scout for the duration of the expedition.

In December 1803 the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition started construction of Camp Dubois, also known as Camp Wood, their winter camp of 1803–1804. Located next to the Mississippi River, and at the mouth of Wood River, the camp was in what was then St. Clair County, now Madison County, Illinois. They stayed at Camp Dubois until May 14, 1804, when they crossed the Mississippi River and started up the Missouri River (at 2,341 miles long it is the longest river in North America). On March 29, 1804, while still at Camp Dubois, Private John Colter and Shields (second cousins) threatened Sergeant John Ordway&#x27;s life. They were put on trial for mutiny, but they were both spared. (&quot;See John Ordway for more information.&quot;)

Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition

Journal of Captain Meriwether Lewis:
* &quot;6th February Wednesday 1805 . . . Shields killed three antelopes this evening. the blacksmiths [John Shields, William Bratton, and Alexander Willard] take a considerable quantity of corn today in payment for their labour. the blacksmith&#x27;s have proved a happy resoce to us in our present situation as I believe it would have been difficult to have devised any other method to have procured corn from the natives. the Indians are extravegantly fond of sheet iron of which they form arrow-points and manufacter into instruments for scraping and dressing their buffaloe robes - I permited the blacksmith to dispose of a part of a sheet-iron callaboos [stove] which had been nearly birnt out on our passage up the river, and for each piece about four inches square he obtained from seven to eight gallons of corn from the natives who appeared extremely pleased with the exchange&quot;

Journal of Second Lieutenant William Clark:
* &quot;Friday June 13th 1806 . . . Soon after they Set out all of our hunters returned each with a deer except Shields who brought two&quot;

* &quot;Wednesday 6th Feby. 1805 . . . Shields went out towards evening to hunt &amp; killed 3 Goats which we brought in and eat the meat.&quot;

== Post-expedition ==

In 1799 the famous American pioneer Daniel Boone (1734–1820) moved to what is now St. Charles County, Missouri, where he lived about 50 miles up the Missouri River from St. Louis, Missouri, where the expedition started and finished. &quot;In 1804 Meriwether Lewis and William Clark visited Boone before embarking on their expedition, gathering valuable information about the lands to the west, which Boone had not been able to resist exploring.&quot; The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed near Boone&#x27;s residence on the way up the Missouri River in 1804 and again on the way down the river in 1806. When Shields returned from the expedition to the Oregon Coast he hunted and trapped in Missouri with Daniel Boone. Shields later moved to Harrison County, Indiana, where he hunted and trapped with Squire Boone, a brother of Daniel Boone. Some historians show that John Shields was a &quot;kinsman&quot; of Daniel Boone, but there does not appear to be any evidence they were related.

On January 15, 1807, Captain Meriwether Lewis wrote to the US Secretary of War Henry Dearborn: &quot;John Sheilds [&quot;sic&quot;] has received the pay only of a private. Nothing was more peculiarly useful to us in various situations than the skill and ingenuity of this man as an artist, in repairing our guns, accoutrements, &amp;c. and should it be thought proper to allow him something as an artificer, he has well deserved it.&quot;

Shields settled in Indiana by June 1807 and was appointed captain of the Clark County militia in July 1807. In December 1809, Shields died in Harrison County and is buried at the Little Flock Baptist Cemetery, in Crandall, Harrison County, Indiana.

The Shields River, a tributary of the Yellowstone River, just east of Livingston, Montana, was named in his honor.

A state historical marker to his memory is erected near the Harrison County Courthouse in Corydon, Indiana. Shields&#x27; historical marker shows that he was a gunsmith and blacksmith in the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and that after his return he moved to Clark County, Indiana, and that in 1809 he died in Harrison County, Indiana.

== Gravesite and headstone ==

There is a headstone for Private John Shields (1769–1809) in the Little Flock Baptist Cemetery, Elizabeth, Harrison County, Indiana. The inscription shows that Shields was a private in the U.S. Army and a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. It also shows that besides his duties as a gunsmith, blacksmith, and hunter, he was also a scout and mechanic.

<text>Princes Freeway is a Australian freeway, divided into two sections, both located in Victoria, Australia. The freeway links Melbourne to Geelong in the west, and to Morwell in the east. It continues beyond these extremities as the Princes Highway towards Adelaide to the west and Sydney to the northeast. The freeway bears the designation M1.

The western section linking Geelong and Melbourne is an important commuter, freight and tourism route between the two cities; the eastern section links Melbourne with the Latrobe Valley and major business suburbs, namely Dandenong and Berwick. The entire freeway is one of the busiest sections of rural highway in Victoria, used by large numbers of freight and commercial vehicles and provides access to tourist attractions in central and east Gippsland. It supports Victoria&#x27;s rural industries and tourism.

==Route==
The western section (also known as Princes Freeway West or Geelong Road) starts at Corio, in the northern suburbs of Geelong and heads north-east as a six-lane dual-carriageway freeway, widening to eight lanes east of Werribee, and ends at the West Gate Interchange in Laverton, where the Western Ring Road and the old Geelong Road can be accessed by off-ramps. This section ranges from six lanes (three in each direction) between Geelong and Werribee, to ten lanes near the Ring Road interchange. Between 1999 and 2003 the section from Hoppers Crossing to Geelong was progressively widened to provide a third lane in each direction, in addition to a number of other safety upgrades being completed. Following this upgrade the speed limit was lowered from to in response to the freeway&#x27;s poor safety record.

The eastern section (also known as Princes Freeway East) starts from Narre Warren, as a six-lane dual-carriageway freeway, narrowing to four lanes just west of Pakenham. There are also several highway-standard at-grade intersections, most notably between Nar Nar Goon and Longwarry. These intersections are speed limited to , with the only section on the freeway from Longwarry to Morwell. However, traffic still travels through the towns of Yarragon and Trafalgar, therefore urban speed limits apply to these towns (between ) where the road reverts to the Princes Highway (though planning for bypasses of these towns are underway).

The western and eastern sections are connected together through the Melbourne suburbs by West Gate Freeway, CityLink tollway and Monash Freeway. These five sections of road together constitute the route M1 through Melbourne, which is part of National Highway 1.

On the urban section of Princes Freeway (between Laverton North and Werribee), the standard travel time is 9 minutes: 6 minutes between the Western Ring Road and Forsyth Road, and 3 minutes between Forsyth Road and Duncans Road. The usual peak period travel time is between 12 and 18 minutes; however, in times of extreme congestion or traffic accidents, the travel time can well exceed 20 minutes.

==History==
The Maltby Bypass was Victoria&#x27;s first freeway which opened on 16 June 1961, and was the first section of Princes Freeway to open.

Both sections of Princes Freeway were signed National Route 1, either inheriting it when converted from older sections of Princes Highway, or assigned when newly constructed to bypass a section of it. With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, the freeway&#x27;s National Route 1 designation began conversion to M1 in late 1996, and was completed in 1997. Former bypassed sections of Princes Highway are generally signed as Metropolitan Route 83 or route C109 (western section), Alternative National Route 1 or designated successive routes from C101 to C104 (eastern section).

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2012, VicRoads re-declared the western section as Princes Freeway West (Freeway #1500) from Corio-Waurn Ponds Road in Highton to Little Boundary Road at Laverton North (this definition includes Geelong Ring Road, and in 2007, VicRoads re-declared the eastern section as Princes Freeway East (Freeway #1510) from Monash Freeway at Narre Warren to the eastern end of Princes Drive in Morwell (minus the highway section between Yarragon and Trafalgar). VicRoads also classifies a 5km stretch of road between Newmerella and Orbost as part of Princes Freeway East, despite being a two-lane, single-carriageway road and signed as Princes Highway.

In March 2010 it was announced by the State Government that trucks would be banned from the right-hand lane along a section of freeway between Geelong and Melbourne. Suggestions of a ban began in 2005 but increased after the fatal 2007 Burnley Tunnel fire that killed three people. The ban was put into place from 1 July 2010 between Kororoit Creek Road, Altona, and Avalon Road, Lara and covers all heavy vehicles weighing more than , except buses and caravans. A fine of $358 applies to those breaking the rules, the ban being a trial before a full roll-out on the other major roads in the state.

==Exits and interchanges==
The road is divided in two distinct sections that do not meet, but are connected by West Gate Freeway, CityLink and Monash Freeway; the western section is long, while the eastern section is long.

===Western section===








===Eastern section===














== Recent upgrades ==
===Pakenham Bypass===
The Pakenham Bypass was the final missing link of a continuous freeway from Melbourne to Gippsland in the East of Victoria (excluding the single sets of traffic lights in the small rural towns of Yarragon and Trafalgar). Federal and State Governments jointly funded construction of the bypass at a cost of $242 million which commenced in April 2005 and was completed on 1 December 2007. The 24 km freeway which runs from Beaconsfield to Nar Nar Goon bypasses the townships of Pakenham and Officer and provides an important link between Gippsland and Melbourne.


The new section of freeway also bypassed a small section of the original Princes Freeway at Beaconsfield, which remains as a connection between Princes Highway and the freeway known as the Princes Link Highway. The interchange between Princes Link Highway and the freeway was reconfigured as part of the O&#x27;Shea Road extension project, and was completed in 2022.

===Geelong Ring Road===

The Federal and State Government announced the construction of a new bypass extending 23 kilometres along Geelong&#x27;s western outskirts from the Princes Freeway in Corio to the Princes Highway in Waurn Ponds. Drivers using the Bypass between Corio and Waurn Ponds will avoid up to 29 sets of traffic lights, with a travel time at freeway speeds of less than 15 minutes compared with the current 25–60 minute trip through Geelong.

The Federal Government allocated $186 million in funding with the State Government providing the remainder, giving a total of $380 million. Construction works for Section 1, between Corio and Bell Post Hill commenced in February 2006. Contracts for Section 2, between Hamlyn Heights and Fyansford, commenced in September 2006 and construction of Section 3, between Fyansford and Waurn Ponds, commenced in November 2007. All 3 stages were scheduled for completion in June 2009.

===Duplication from Geelong to Winchelsea and Colac===
West of Geelong, duplication of the Princes Highway between Waurn Ponds and Winchelsea commenced in 2011 and was to be completed by late 2014, though opened in May 2016 after substantially being delayed. Construction for the Winchelsea - Colac section is now underway (which began in early 2016), with both the Victorian and Australian governments contributing $515 million for this project. Once completed around 2018 and beyond, it will be an M standard road.

==Current upgrades==
===Duplication from Traralgon to Sale===
Since 2010, the Princes Highway between Traralgon and Sale has progressively been duplicated and upgraded to rural freeway standard. Since 2016, the duplication has been done in three stages.

The ten sections of the duplication project now complete are:
* Traralgon East, between Traralgon–Maffra Road and Stammers Road; construction began in February 2010 and opened in late 2010
* Traralgon East, between Stammers Road and Minniedale Road; construction began in July 2013 and opened in February 2015
* Traralgon East, between Minniedale Road and Sheepwash Creek Road (Stage 1); construction began in December 2016 and opened in December 2018
* Flynn, between Sheepwash Creek Road and Flynn Creek Road (Stage 3); construction began in July 2021 and opened in July 2023
* Flynn to Rosedale, between Flynn Creek Road and Cricket Street; construction began in March 2014 and opened in November 2016 
* Rosedale to Nambrok (Stage 1), between Dennison Road and Nambrok Road; construction began in December 2013 and opened in April 2015
* Nambrok (Stage 2), between Nambrok Road and Maffra–Rosedale Road; construction began in February 2017 and opened in December 2018
* Fulham (Stage 2), from Sale–Cowwarr Road to Sale–Heyfield Road; construction began in mid 2016 and opened in December 2017
* Fulham to Wurruk (Stage 1), between Sale–Heyfield Road and Wurruk;
* Wurruk to Sale; opened in late 2012

The remaining section of Stage 3, which started construction in July 2021 and expected completion in 2024 is:
* Kilmany, between Maffra–Rosedale Road and Sale–Cowwarr Road (linking Nambrok Stage 2 to Fulham Stage 2)

== Future upgrades ==
===Princes Highway East===
====Nar Nar Goon to Longwarry North upgrade====
Proposed safety and grade separation improvements, Princes Freeway East – Nar Nar Goon to Longwarry North, to be funded in future.

====Traralgon Bypass====
In 2009, VicRoads with Latrobe City Council completed a planning project for the Traralgon Bypass. Four options were put to the public, with Option 2 chosen as the preferred route. This route was formalised in the Latrobe Planning Scheme thereafter. In August 2017, the State Government announced $1.4 million towards further planning of the Traralgon Bypass. 

As of 2023, the bypass is dependent on additional state and federal government funding for detailed planning and construction to proceed.

===Princes Highway West===
====Winchelsea and Colac Bypass====
Bypasses of Winchelsea and Colac as well as possible duplication of the Princes Hwy from Colac to Warrnambool, to be funded in future.

<text>Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) was an Islamic organization formed by Malcolm X after he left the Nation of Islam. MMI was a relatively small group that collapsed after its founder was assassinated.

==History==
Malcolm X announced the establishment of Muslim Mosque, Inc. on March 12, 1964, four days after his departure from the Nation of Islam. The group&#x27;s membership consisted primarily of former Nation of Islam members. In a 2003 interview, one of its former leaders recalled that MMI started with a core of about 50 dedicated activists.

Malcolm X spent much of the time between March 1964 and February 1965 overseas. In his absence, James 67X Shabazz served as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Muslim Mosque, Inc.

Between March 1964, when he left the Nation of Islam, and February 1965, when he was assassinated, Malcolm X&#x27;s philosophy evolved as he traveled through Africa and the Middle East. Those changes confused many members of Muslim Mosque, Inc.

Initially, the teachings of Muslim Mosque, Inc. were similar to those of the Nation of Islam. When Malcolm X became a Sunni Muslim, made the &quot;hajj&quot;, and wrote to the members of MMI from Mecca about his pilgrimage and how it had forced him to reject the racism that had previously characterized his views of white people, many members could not believe what they were hearing. The Nation of Islam had taught that no white people were permitted in the holy city of Mecca. Some MMI members refused to believe that Malcolm X had become a Sunni, and others thought he was being misquoted when he wrote about white people.

By May 1964, membership in Muslim Mosque, Inc. had grown to 125, and the group was attracting people who were not former Nation of Islam members.

Malcolm X sought acceptance of Muslim Mosque, Inc. by mainstream Islamic organizations. In August 1964, the Supreme Council on Islamic Affairs awarded 20 scholarships to permit young MMI members to study at Al-Azhar University tuition-free. Also in August, MMI was admitted to the Islamic Federation of the United States and Canada. The following month the World Islamic League offered 15 scholarships through MMI for study at the Islamic University of Madinah.

Following the assassination of Malcolm X in February 1965, Muslim Mosque, Inc. foundered and was disbanded.

The Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood, located at 130 West 113th Street in Harlem, is a successor to Muslim Mosque, Inc.

<doc id="1056725" wikidata="Q2778431" url="?curid=1056725" title="Mixture (organ stop)">
<text>A mixture is an organ stop, usually of principal tone quality, that contains multiple ranks of pipes including at least one mutation stop. It is designed to be drawn with a combination of stops that forms a complete chorus, for example, principals of 8 foot (8), 4, and 2 pitches. The mixture emphasizes upper harmonics of each note of the keyboard; the individual pitches in the mixture are not distinguished by the listener, but reinforce the fundamental (lowest) pitch, adding volume, timbre (colour) and brilliance to the sound. Because pipes playing upper harmonics produce their own set of harmonic overtones, an element of harmonic dissonance is introduced, giving mixtures their characteristic tonal texture as they enrich the ensemble. Historically, the mixture descends from the medieval Blockwerk concept, an organ in which there were no stops and all the ranks sounded simultaneously.

==Nomenclature==

Mixture stops are typically labeled with Roman numerals with the number of ranks of pipes that they have, i.e. how many pipes sound when a single key is pressed. For example, a Mixture II contains two ranks (sounding two notes), a Mixture V contains five ranks, and so forth.

The mixture is sometimes designed so that the number of ranks per note increases as one ascends the compass of the keyboard. A mixture exhibiting this trait is referred to as &quot;progressive&quot;, and is labeled with two numbers (e.g. Plein Jeu III-VII, Fourniture IV-VIII).

If a pitch is specified (e.g. &quot;Mixture IV 2&quot;), it refers to the pitch of the lowest-sounding rank when the lowest C on the keyboard is pressed.

Sometimes a mixture is labeled with multiple numbers denoting the intervals above root pitch that it will sound. For example, &quot;Mixture 15.19.22.26&quot; means when a note is pressed, the intervals of a 15th, a 19th, a 22nd and a 26th will sound (or 2&#x27; + 1&#x27; + 1&#x27; + &#x27;).

=== Types of Mixtures ===

==== Fourniture ====
This is the most common type of mixture, often written simply as &quot;Mixture&quot;. It contains octaves and fifths and is usually progressive. It is complementary to the Cymbale mixture.

==== Cymbale ====
A relatively high mixture containing, properly, octaves and fifths, but may include the major third. It accompanies the Fourniture to create a full chorus mixture sound.

==== Plein Jeu ====
Literally &quot;full chorus&quot; this is usually a combination of the Fourniture and Cymbale mixtures.

==== Scharf ====
A high-pitched mixture (1&#x27;, 1/2&#x27;, or 1/4&#x27;) usually of III or more ranks=mIV, IV-V, III-IV, V-VI. It contains octaves, major thirds (at least one), and fifths, though it can also contain the minor seventh.

==== Rauschquint ====
A harmonic mixture containing two or three or more (IV/V/VI/VII/VIII/IX/Rauschquint III-XII ranks of only octaves and fifths.

==Variables affecting tone color==
Mixture stops commonly include only unison and fifth pitch levels, though they sometimes include thirds and less commonly include other harmonics such as sevenths and ninths. The pedal division normally contains lower-pitched mixtures that reinforce the 16&#x27; fundamental.

Manual mixtures with tierces can sound &quot;disembodied&quot; without a 16&#x27; stop being drawn with them.

The frequency at which the various ranks in a mixture drop back by an interval (or &quot;break&quot;) as one ascends the compass determines to a great extent how the mixture sounds. If a mixture does not break, it is referred to as a &quot;harmonic&quot; mixture. Aristide Cavaillé-Coll built many examples of mixture stops labelled &quot;Plein jeux harmonique&quot;. Some mixtures augment the treble in the lower ranges of the keyboard and the bass in the upper ranges of the keyboard.
==Mixture breaks==
The composition of pitches in a mixture will usually change (or &quot;break back&quot;) several times across the compass of the keyboard, often on subsequent C&#x27;s, as in the example below. The &quot;breaks&quot; of a mixture involve the dropping out of a higher pitch at a given point within the keyboard&#x27;s compass, and the addition of a lower pitch. This feature causes the mixture to sound relatively higher pitches in the lower parts of the keyboard, and relatively lower pitches towards the top end. It provides for definition in the bass and additional fundamental in the treble. Another reason for breaks, particularly in very high mixtures, is that builders find it impractical to make pipes smaller (higher) than the top of a 2 rank, the C that&#x27;s about 2/3 long. When that pitch is reached, it is usual practice to repeat the previous octave of pipes at the lower pitch level. Since mixtures commonly begin at pitches higher than 2, octave repeats would be required as the pitches ascend.

For example, here is the break structure of a typical Great Fourniture IV:

<text>Delta Lake State Park is a New York state park located on a peninsula extending from the southeast shore of Delta Lake in Oneida County, New York, United States. It is located off New York State Route 46, southwest of Westernville and north of Rome, New York.

== History ==
The peninsula that today contains Delta Lake State Park was created when the Mohawk River was impounded in 1908 to form Delta Lake, a reservoir intended to supply water to the New York State Barge Canal. The New York State Canal Corporation leased approximately to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for the creation of a state park in 1962. In 2005, it was announced that the Canal Corporation would officially transfer the park&#x27;s land, along with an additional , to the NYSOPRHP, bringing the park&#x27;s total area to . In 2023, a portion of the park was created into a large dumping station, as previously there was only one small one.

== Facilities ==
The park offers a beach, picnic tables and pavilions, volleyball nets, swing sets, a playground, a food concession, trails for hiking and bike riding, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling and ice fishing, recreation programs, a boat launch, a 3 loop campground with 101 tent and trailer sites, showers and multiple dump stations.

<text>Rapid City Muscle Car is the second studio album by American band the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, released in 1994 on Space Age Bachelor Pad Records.

==Overview==
&quot;Rapid City Muscle Car&quot; was structured around the Daddies&#x27; desire to create a stylistic concept album in which each track was composed as the total musical opposite of the last - &quot;[whipping] the listener around as if he/she was...experiencing stylistic G-forces&quot; - but remaining thematically coherent through interconnected lyricism following an abstract narrative. 

Delving into wider-reaching and more experimental territory than their punk rock roots, the result is arguably the Daddies&#x27; most musically eclectic work. Building upon the band&#x27;s then-standard repertoire of swing and funk, &quot;Rapid City Muscle Car&quot; weaves between ska punk, rockabilly, country, psychedelia, big band and lounge. The album also makes extensive use of outside instruments, adding acoustic guitars, accordions, clarinets and vibraphones in addition to the band&#x27;s keyboards and horn section. A full big band orchestra is used on &quot;Come Back to Me&quot;, a cover song taken from the 1965 Burton Lane/Alan Jay Lerner Broadway musical &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;.

&quot;Come Back to Me&quot; was later re-recorded for the Daddies&#x27; 2014 Rat Pack tribute album &quot;Please Return the Evening&quot;, featuring only the band&#x27;s regular line-up as opposed to a full orchestra.

==Track listing==
All songs composed by Steve Perry, except where otherwise noted.

<text>The Pui Ching Middle Schools () is a system of Baptist secondary schools first founded in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China and later Hong Kong and Macau. Located at Peizheng Road in Yuexiu District, Guangzhou Pui Ching Middle School is a state-owned full-time public school with its campus covering an area of nearly 70,000 square meters. The school has 36 classes for senior grade and 26 classes for the junior grade. There are 230 teachers, among whom 66 people are senior teachers.

== History ==
The original Guangzhou school was founded in 1889 by local Chinese Baptists, and was the first Christian school in China founded by local Christians rather than foreign missionaries. The Guangzhou school was disbanded and students moved to Macau in January 1938 due to the spread of World War II to Southern China. The Guangzhou school was subsequently reopened after the war.

== School song ==
The lyrics of the school song come from a poem, written by Li Zhu-hou, a Chinese language teacher at Pui Ching Middle School. The song was arranged by Ho An-tung, with its melody identical to Wien Neêrlands Bloed, the former national anthem of the Netherlands.

== Macau School ==

The Guangzhou school was moved to Macau in 1938. It is now an integrated grammar school with more than 3,000 students in its kindergarten, primary school, junior high and senior high sections.

<doc id="1056740" wikidata="Q6405012" url="?curid=1056740" title="Kids on the Street">
<text>Kids on the Street is the third studio album by American band the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, released in 1996 on Space Age Bachelor Pad Records.

==Overview==
By 1996, the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies had established themselves as a staple of the West Coast third wave ska scene, carving out a steady touring niche alongside bands such as The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Reel Big Fish. However, the Daddies&#x27; next album strayed from the brass-heavy swing and funk which dominated their first two releases in favor of further exploration into punk and ska.

With lead singer Steve Perry now assuming a role as a rhythm guitarist, &quot;Kids on the Street&quot; predominantly features guitar-driven ska and punk, though also branches into such genres as southern rock (&quot;Luther Lane&quot;), western swing (&quot;Silver-Tongued Devil&quot;) and jazz (&quot;Here Comes the Snake&quot;). Perry has stated that the abundance of straightforward rock and punk songs on the album in place of the eclecticism of their previous records was partially due to his playing guitar on the album, as he described his guitar skills as &quot;limited&quot;.

==Release and reception==
Released in the midst of the American ska revival in 1996, &quot;Kids on the Street&quot; was the Daddies&#x27; most successful album at that time. Distributed through indie label Caroline Records, the album sold 25,000 copies in its first week, charting on &quot;The Rocket&#x27;s&quot; Retail Sales Top Twenty for over seven months and eventually making its way onto &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; Alternative Chart. Several of the album&#x27;s songs appeared on numerous mid-1990s ska compilations, helping spread the Daddies&#x27; name further outside of their Pacific Northwest-centered fanbase.

Two contemporary reviews in Eugene&#x27;s &quot;The Register-Guard&quot; both gave &quot;Kids on the Street&quot; a positive reception. One reviewer called the album a &quot;great CD&quot; that was &quot;suitable for just hanging out and doing homework&quot; to and for &quot;long, boring car trips&quot;, while another reviewer, though claiming that &quot;Kids&quot; occasionally branched into &quot;the monotony of &#x27;alternative&#x27;&quot;, noted that it &quot;definitely would be possible to derive pleasure from listening to this CD. The music is wonderful!&quot;

==Track listing==
===Alternative versions===
*&quot;Here Comes the Snake&quot;, the only &quot;Kids on the Street&quot; track which appeared on the Daddies&#x27; &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; compilation, was re-recorded and released as a single in 1998, featuring a faster tempo, additional trumpet and a theremin replacing the whistle. This version was also used in the soundtrack of the film &quot;Three to Tango&quot;.
*&quot;Irish Whiskey&quot; was re-recorded for the Daddies&#x27; 2000 album &quot;Soul Caddy&quot;, omitting the horns and including an extended bridge.

<text>Soul Caddy is the fourth studio album by American band the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, released on October 3, 2000 by Mojo Records.

Written and recorded after the multi-platinum success of their 1997 compilation &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; moved away from the swing revival movement which had brought them temporary fame, drawing upon retro pop, rock, and soul influences and addressing themes of cultural alienation in its lyrics. Released to little promotion or mainstream recognition, &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; was a commercial failure, bringing the Daddies&#x27; full-time touring career to an end and initiating a hiatus from recording until the release of &quot;Susquehanna&quot; in 2008.

==Album overview==
Following the success of their 1997 swing music compilation &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies decided to return to the multi-genre format of their earlier albums for &quot;Soul Caddy&quot;, weaving an eclectic variety of musical styles around the band&#x27;s characteristic mix of rock, swing, and ska.

Singer-songwriter Steve Perry explained in interviews that the album&#x27;s primary stylistic elements were derived from the rock and pop music of the 1960s and 1970s, namely Motown soul and British Mod, of which Perry has long been influenced by.

Much of &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; is punctuated by tracks of soul, ska and rhythm and blues, also incorporating such diverse musical styles as funk (&quot;My Mistake&quot;), jazz (&quot;The Saddest Thing I Know&quot;), punk rock (&quot;Irish Whiskey&quot;) and psychedelic folk (&quot;Grand Mal&quot;).

The leading track and first single off &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; was the glam rock pastiche &quot;Diamond Light Boogie&quot;. Following the huge success of the band&#x27;s 1997 swing single &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, Perry sought to write a song which would introduce a truer perspective of the Daddies&#x27; sound to a wider audience and help bridge the gap between their swing-oriented fanbase and non-swing music. &quot;Diamond Light Boogie&quot; worked as a musical and lyrical homage to the glam era of the early 1970s, written to fuse the guitar riff-driven melodies of bands such as T. Rex with the rhythmic backbeat and upbeat horn section common of jump blues and swing.

Perry has described &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; as a loose concept album reflecting his own temporary experience with fame, drawing upon feelings of social alienation, disillusionment and dissatisfaction with the cultural zeitgeist. Perry described &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; as a &quot;bittersweet&quot; record about &quot;being alienated and hoping to connect&quot;, noting the central themes of the albums as being about loneliness and the search for meaning in a &quot;technically sophisticated yet soulless society&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Gallery&quot;, Perry explained:

==Production history==
After finishing their initial touring behind the release of &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; in late 1997, the Daddies started production on their next studio album in as early as February 1998. During these recording sessions, the band had begun recording tracks for upwards of sixteen songs, much of which was heavily ska and Mod-influenced. In the following months, however, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; unexpectedly emerged as a hit single on modern rock radio, rocketing the album to the top of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers chart and propelling the Daddies to the forefront of the burgeoning swing revival movement. Mojo Records insisted that the band leave the studio and immediately begin touring again, a tour which ultimately lasted for over a year as &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; grew to surpass sales of over two million units.

When the Daddies finally returned to the studio in the fall of 1999, Perry felt the previous recordings had become &quot;stale&quot;, and the band began work on writing new songs and re-writing the older ones. Openly discontent with the media&#x27;s persistent typecasting of the Daddies as a generic &quot;retro swing band&quot; at the expense of their dominant ska and punk influences, Perry started writing more diverse musical textures into the album rather than merely return to an overtly swing-oriented sound. In interviews given during this time, he voiced his desire to create an album which could bridge the gaps between their swing fanbase and their non-swing music. &quot;We don&#x27;t want to disappoint people&quot;, he told ABC News, &quot;Hopefully, now we can give [the fans] a sense of what they want but still be able to be ourselves. The ultimate thing would be to be popular and have a lot of people know what you&#x27;re really like and like you for it.&quot;

To help lend a vintage authenticity to the album&#x27;s 1970s-influenced sound, Perry brought in several notable guest musicians and producers from the era. Legendary glam rock producer and David Bowie collaborator Tony Visconti served as a supervising producer on &quot;Diamond Light Boogie&quot;, while former Turtles and Mothers of Invention vocalist Mark Volman featured as a backing vocalist on the song. Further backing vocals throughout the album were provided by Motown artist Ada Dyer and Luther Vandross and Quincy Jones singer Paulette McWilliams, while free jazz saxophonist Dewey Redman featured on &quot;The Saddest Thing I Know&quot; and world music percussionist Carol Steele, who recorded with Peter Gabriel and Tears for Fears among others, played on the song &quot;Stay (Don&#x27;t Just Stay)&quot;. Lee Jeffries, steel guitarist for western swing band Big Sandy &amp; His Fly-Rite Boys, supposedly performed on a song which didn&#x27;t make it onto the album.

==Release and reception==
Despite allowing the Daddies complete creative control over the production of &quot;Soul Caddy&quot;, Mojo Records had a largely unenthusiastic reaction to the finished album. Claiming that the new material was &quot;not like the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies people know and love&quot;, the label did little to promote the album, at one point releasing the single for &quot;Diamond Light Boogie&quot; without the band&#x27;s name on it, allegedly due to a hesitancy over releasing a rock single from a band largely known for swing music. With virtually no major marketing or promotion behind it, &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; was quietly released on October 3, 2000.
&quot;Soul Caddy&quot; met with mixed to negative critical reviews upon release, the majority of criticism ironically centered on the album&#x27;s lack of swing music. Some reviewers, however, seemed oblivious to the Daddies&#x27; eclectic ska punk history: Steve Greenlee of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; began his review with &quot;neo-swing fans, beware&quot;, openly accusing the Daddies of abandoning their swing &quot;roots&quot; in favor of a trendier sound, while the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; echoed similar complaints, placing the album on their list of the 10 worst albums of 2000, the reviewer wondering what made a swing band &quot;think it could get away with an album of recycled psychedelic pop&quot;. Critics were evenly divided over &quot;Soul Caddy&quot;″s mix of genres; UGO&#x27;s &quot;Hip Online&quot; wrote &quot;[c]overing five or six genres on one album is just insane&quot;, noting &quot;&quot;Soul Caddy&quot; has no cohesion and that ruins the enjoyment&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was annoyed by the way the band tackled each genre with the same &quot;insufferable enthusiasm&quot;, remarking &quot;Perry is a far better writer than he is a singer&quot; and giving the album a C− rating. MTV.com offered perhaps the most overwhelmingly negative review, saying that &quot;Soul Caddy&quot;″s &quot;cheesy, super-compressed studio shine&quot; had drained the album of its energy, leaving the &quot;confusing&quot; mix of genres feeling &quot;washed-out [and] a bit depressing and Weird Al-like&quot;, summarizing the Daddies as &quot;a band that&#x27;s trying to show off their record collection, rather than their creativity&quot;.

On the positive end of the critical spectrum, some reviewers responded well to &quot;Soul Caddy&quot;″s eclectic bent. Allmusic, despite rating it with a modest score of 3 out of 5 stars, wrote &quot;&quot;Soul Caddy&quot; is flat-out fun and there&#x27;s no way around that&quot;, praising the album&#x27;s &quot;witty and smart lyricism&quot; and assortment of genres as &quot;certainly refreshing coming from a band who was assumed to be generic retro swing&quot; and noting &quot;for the listeners who take time to believe in it, &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; will be impressively surprising&quot;. The &quot;Denver Westword&quot; lauded the band for breaking away from the retro mentality of the swing revival, saying of the Daddies &quot;they&#x27;ve got more spunk, more sense of adventure and more life than nearly every other swing act on the scene&quot;, praising the album&#x27;s streaks of rock and punk for giving neo-swing &quot;a much-needed facelift&quot;.

===Impact on the band===
Bogged down by poor reviews, neither &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; nor &quot;Diamond Light Boogie&quot; achieved any commercial or chart success upon release, casting an unshakeable pall over the Daddies&#x27; subsequent US tour in promotion of the album. The &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; tour saw the band intentionally downplaying their swing side in favor of their wider body of sounds, a choice which didn&#x27;t fare well with the Daddies&#x27; target audiences. Speaking retrospectively in a 2002 interview, Perry elaborated &quot;we went out on tour and most people saw us as a swing band because of the success of &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;...we felt this tension to be something we weren&#x27;t&quot;. Already dissatisfied with the tour&#x27;s outcome, consistently low ticket sales ultimately brought the Daddies&#x27; tour to an early and unfortunate close.

In December 2000, the Daddies mutually agreed upon taking an indefinite hiatus from performing, citing both &quot;Soul Caddy&quot;″s commercial underperformance and the band&#x27;s personal exhaustion from nearly non-stop touring since the release of &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; as reason. The Daddies would eventually reform in February 2002 to sporadically play one-off local shows and festival appearances for the next several years before returning to touring and recording with their self-produced and independently released album &quot;Susquehanna&quot; in early 2008.

<text>Angelita Lind Soliveras a.k.a. &quot;The Angel of Puerto Rico&quot; (born January 13, 1959) is a Puerto Rican track and field athlete.

==Early years==
Lind was born in the barrio Marin Bajo of Patillas, Puerto Rico into a poor family. She received her primary and secondary education in her hometown. Lind first participated in track and field events in the 7th grade and later continued participating for her high school. However, it wasn&#x27;t until she became a student at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico that she was asked by the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee to represent Puerto Rico in international sports events.

==International competitions==
Lind has represented the island and participated in three Central American and Caribbean Games (CAC) and won two gold medals, three silver medals and one bronze medal. She also participated in three Pan American Games and in the 1984 Olympics celebrated in Los Angeles, California.

In the CAC of 1982, celebrated in Havana, Cuba, Lind was the standard carrier of the Puerto Rican flag. In those games, she won a gold medal in the 1,500 meter dash with a record time of 4:25.88 and a silver in the 800 meters dash in a controversial race in 2:04.24. In that race, she crossed the finish line with two Cuban runners next to her. Right at the finish line the two Cuban girls ran into each other and they both knocked Angelita down. Lind&#x27;s feet were crossing the finish line, but because the Cuban fell into Angelita from behind, it was the Cuban who actually crossed the finish line first; after a prolonged discussion which reached the central offices of the International Athletic Federation, it was decided that Lind arrived second. They based their decision on a rule of track and field which states that the first torso across the finish line wins.

By this time there had been a lot of trouble between the Government of Puerto Rico, headed by pro-US statehood governor Carlos Romero Barceló, (who withheld economic support from the athletic delegation headed to Cuba), and the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, presided by German Rieckehoff, which had to appeal directly to the people for donations. Lind&#x27;s &quot;fall&quot; united the people of Puerto Rico and for the first time, they forgot about the fight between the Olympic Committee and the government and concentrated on the sport - these events also served to inspire future runners.

==World Masters Athletics==
Angelita Lind officially retired in 1992, however in July 2003 at age 44, she returned to participate in the 1,500 dash in the World Masters Athletics championships, which were celebrated in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She continues to hold the national record for the 800 meters dash and the 1,500 meters dash.

==Later years==
She earned her master&#x27;s degree from the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico and is currently a professor of physical education. Lind also serves as assistant athletic director in the department of physical education at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico campus in San German, Puerto Rico. In 2004, she was inducted into the &quot;Puerto Rican Sports Hall of Fame&quot;.

<text>Pampushka ( , pl. ; diminutive of pampukh or pampukha) is a small savory or sweet yeast-raised bun or doughnut typical for Ukrainian cuisine.

==Etymology==
The Ukrainian word &quot;pampukh&quot; comes via Polish &quot;pampuch&quot; (a kind of thick dumpling or steamed doughnut) from German &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot; (&quot;pancake&quot;). Similarly to English &quot;pancake&quot;, the latter derives from &quot;Pfanne&quot; (&quot;pan&quot;) and &quot;Kuchen&quot; (&quot;cake&quot;). The diminutive form &quot;pampushka&quot; is used more frequently than the basic form.

==Varieties==
Pampushky are made of yeast dough from wheat, rye or buckwheat flour. Traditionally they are baked, but may also be fried. Savoury pampushky have no filling. They are usually seasoned with garlic sauce and often served as a side dish with red borscht or yushka. Sweet pampushky may be filled with fruits, berries, varenye, povydlo, or poppy seeds, and topped with powdered sugar.

== History ==
According to William Pokhlyobkin, the technology of making pampushky points to German cuisine, and these buns were possibly created by German colonists in Ukraine. They spread through the country in the second half of the 19th century and later reached the status of a Ukrainian traditional dish.

==In popular culture==
Since 2008, yearly Pampukh Festivals have been organised around Orthodox Christmas time (in January) in Lviv. During the festival in 2012, a Guinness world record was set by building the world&#x27;s largest mosaic made of doughnuts.

<text>Electronic firing refers to the use of an electric current to fire a cartridge instead of a centerfire primer or rimfire primer.

In modern firearm designs, a firing pin and primer are used to ignite the propellant in the cartridge which propels the bullet forward. The firing pin must travel a short distance, creating a short delay between the user pulling the trigger and the weapon firing, which generally decreases accuracy.

However, in an electronic-firearm, an electric current instead of conventional mechanical action is used to ignite the propellant which fires the projectile.

There are two approaches to electrically firing the cartridge. One method retains the primer, which functions analogously as a conventional primer. However, rather than being struck by a firing pin or by equivalent mechanical means, an electric current serves to detonate the primer. After which, the provided action delivers the thermal impulse necessary to ignite the propellant, which then deflagrates, producing pressure. The second approach is called electrothermal-chemical technology which utilizes a plasma cartridge. In this mechanism, an electric current is used to generate plasma that ignites the propellant in a controlled manner.

Electronic firing is also used in aircraft autocannons and ammunition as they are more resistant to jamming in high g environments.

<doc id="1056790" wikidata="Q609390" url="?curid=1056790" title="Minster, Swale">
<text>Minster is a town on the north coast of the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, south-east England. It is in the Swale administrative district, and within that, in the parish of Minster-on-Sea. According to the 2021 Census, the population of Minster was 17,389.

==Toponymy==
The name of the town derives from the monastery founded in the area. There is some variation in the use of the name, with the local parish council being named Minster-on-Sea, while other sources, such as the local primary school, use Minster-in-Sheppey, in order to distinguish it from Minster-in-Thanet, also in the county of Kent. Both places are listed in the Ordnance Survey gazetteer as Minster. Royal Mail identifies a locality of Minster on Sea in the ME12 postcode district. Minster-on-Sea is a location mentioned in Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;.

==Geography==
The coast here consists of London Clay, and many fossil remains can be found along the beach after the waves have brought down the cliffs.

==Religious sites==

In around AD 670 King Ecgberht of Kent gave land at Minster for his mother Seaxburh of Ely to establish a Benedictine nunnery, but this was burnt down by the Danes in 855. At some point before the Norman invasion the church was rebuilt and refounded as a Benedictine nunnery, incorporating elements of the original construction in the north chancel and nave. Between 1123 and 1139 Archbishop Corbeil (Corbeuil) refounded it as an Augustinian nunnery. Corbeil is thought to be responsible for the unusual &quot;semi-detached&quot; arrangement of two churches next to each other: the Saxon church of the convent to the north and a parish church to the south for the villagers. They share a wall containing pointed arches and are now used as a single building. The abbey was dissolved in 1539, and along with Davington Priory near Faversham it came into the possession of Sir Thomas Cheney (Cheyney/Cheyne), a favourite of Anne Boleyn. He died in 1558 and was first buried in the chapel of Saint Katherine, which was demolished to allow construction of the east end of the chancel in 1581.

Today the old abbey gatehouse is occupied by a museum run by the Sheppey Local History Society.

==Burials at the abbey==
*Roger Northwode (d. 1286)
*Sir Robert de Shurland (d. 1324)
*Thomas Cheney (d. 1558)

The effigial monument of Robert de Shurland includes the sculpted head of a horse, and is closely associated with (and probably inspired) a local legend in which Sir Robert killed a priest; swam on horseback to beg the king (on board a ship) to pardon him for the murder; but on his return to shore killed his horse because an old woman predicted that it would be the cause of his death. Later encountering its bones, he kicked them in scorn, only for a shard to pierce his foot, causing an infection from which he died. The tale takes elements from Italian, Slavic and Icelandic folklore (including the story of Oleg the Wise, and that of Örvar-Oddr). It was greatly popularised in a version published in 1837 by Richard Barham (&quot;Thomas Ingoldsby&quot;), as one of the &quot;Ingoldsby Legends&quot;.

==History==
In the early 20th century the island was hit by speculative builders and Minster suffered equally with Sheerness. After the Second World War the population of the village had swollen &quot;from about 250 people in 100 homes to 5,500 people in 1,800 homes&quot;.

During the Second World War the Shoeburyness Boom, which ran across the Thames Estuary to protect shipping from submarine attack, ran from Royal Oak Point (near Minster) to Shoeburyness in Essex. A similar structure was built along the same alignment in the early 1950s to protect against Soviet submarines. The Royal Oak Point end of the boom was demolished in the 1960s.

In 1961 the civil parish called &quot;Minster in Sheppey&quot; had a population of 7860. On 1 April 1968 the parish was abolished to form Queenborough in Sheppey.

==Education==
Oasis Academy Isle of Sheppey is located over two sites in the area, and is the only secondary school on the Isle of Sheppey. In 2009 eleven pupils were hurt by the collapse of a heating duct during an exam at its predecessor, Minster College.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Bluebell Hill TV transmitter. 

The town is served by county-wide radio stations: BBC Radio Kent, Heart South, Gold Radio. Community radio based stations are BRFM 95.6 FM, Sheppey FM 92.2 and Hospital Radio Swale which broadcasts from the Sheppey Community Hospital in the town. 

The &quot;Sheerness Times Guardian&quot; is the local weekly newspaper.

==Minster Cricket Club==

Minster Cricket Club play at Gilbert Hall near St. George&#x27;s Primary School. The club was established in 1931 and is the largest on the Isle of Sheppey, fielding four senior teams for Saturday league cricket. The club also have a junior section with U16, U14, U12. Also U1 &amp; U8 soft ball teams, two midweek cricket teams and a Sunday team. www.minstercricket.co.uk
