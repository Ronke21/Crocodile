<text>&quot;Doom&quot; WAD is the default format of package files for the video game &quot;Doom&quot; and its sequel &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;, that contain sprites, levels, and game data. WAD stands for &quot;Where&#x27;s All the Data?&quot;. Immediately after its release in 1993, &quot;Doom&quot; attracted a sizeable following of players who created their own mods for WAD files—packages containing new levels or graphics—and played a vital part in spawning the mod-making culture which is now commonplace for first-person shooter games. Thousands of WADs have been created for &quot;Doom&quot;, ranging from single custom levels to full original games; most of these can be freely downloaded over the Internet. Several WADs have also been released commercially, and for some people the WAD-making hobby became a gateway to a professional career as a level designer.

There are two types of WADs: IWADs (internal WADs) and PWADs (patch WADs). IWADs contain the data necessary to load the game, while PWADs contain additional data, such as new character sprites, as necessary for custom levels.

==History of WADs==
===Development of &quot;Doom&quot;===
When developing &quot;Doom&quot;, id Software was aware that many players had tried to create custom levels and other modifications for their previous game, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, but the procedures involved in creating and loading modifications for that game were cumbersome.

John Carmack, lead programmer at id Software, designed the &quot;Doom&quot; internals from the ground up to allow players to extend the game. For that reason, game data such as levels, graphics, sound effects, and music are stored separately from the game engine, in &quot;WAD&quot; files, allowing for third parties to make new games without making any modifications to the engine. Tom Hall is responsible for coming up with the name WAD.

The idea of making &quot;Doom&quot; easily modifiable was primarily backed by Carmack, a well-known supporter of copyleft and the hacker ideal of people sharing and building upon each other&#x27;s work, and by John Romero, who had hacked games in his youth and wanted to allow other gamers to do the same. In contrast, some video game artists, including Jay Wilbur and Kevin Cloud, objected due to legal concerns and the belief that it would not be of any benefit to the company&#x27;s business.

===Utilities and WADs===
Immediately after the initial shareware release of &quot;Doom&quot; on December 10, 1993, players began working on various tools to modify the game. On January 26, 1994, Brendon Wyber released the first public domain version of the Doom Editing Utility (DEU) program on the Internet, a program created by &quot;Doom&quot; fans which made it possible to create entirely new levels. DEU continued development until May 21 of the same year. It was made possible by Matt Fell&#x27;s release of the Unofficial &quot;Doom&quot; specifications. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Doom&quot; players became involved with further enhancing DEU. Raphaël Quinet spearheaded the program development efforts and overall project release, while Steve Bareman led the documentation effort and creation of the DEU Tutorial. More than 30 other people also helped with the effort and their names appear in the README file included with the program distribution. Yadex, a fork of DEU 5.21 for Unix systems running the X Window System, was later released under the GNU/GPL license. Carmack additionally released the source code for the utilities used to create the game, but these were programmed in Objective-C, for NeXT workstations, and were therefore not directly usable by the mass userbase of IBM PC compatible.

Jeff Bird is credited with creating the first custom WAD for &quot;Doom&quot;, called &quot;Origwad&quot;, on March 7, 1994. Soon, countless players were creating custom WADs and sharing them over AOL, the CompuServe forums, and other Internet-based channels. Many of the WADs were made in the style of the base game, others were based on existing TV series, films, or original themes. Some of the id Software staff have revealed that they were impressed by some of the WADs. John Carmack later said the following about a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed modification:

Another early modification is &quot;Aliens TC&quot;, a total conversion based on the film &quot;Aliens&quot;.

Even though WADs modified &quot;Doom&quot; by replacing graphics and audio, the amount of customization was somewhat limited; much of the game&#x27;s behavior, including the timing and strength of weapons and enemies, was hard-coded in the &quot;Doom&quot; executable file and impossible to alter in WADs. DeHackEd, a &quot;Doom&quot; editing program created by Greg Lewis, addressed this by letting users modify parameters inside of the &quot;Doom&quot; executable itself, allowing for a greater degree of customization.

===Commercial WADs===
Around 1994 and 1995, WADs were distributed primarily through BBSs and via CD collections found in computer shops or bundled together with instruction guides for level creation, while in later years Internet FTP servers became the primary method for obtaining these works. Although the &quot;Doom&quot; software license required that no profit be made from custom WADs, and Shawn Green objected to people selling their WADs for money, some WAD sets and shovelware bundles were nonetheless obtainable for a price at certain outlets.

During this time, id Software was working on their next game, &quot;Quake&quot;, using new technology, but started projects picking up the most talented WAD makers from the &quot;Doom&quot; community to create official expansions and to compete with the unauthorized collection CDs. The team produced the 21 &quot;Master Levels&quot;, which, on December 26, 1995, were released on a CD along with &quot;Maximum Doom&quot;, a collection of 1,830 WADs that had been downloaded from the Internet. In 1996, &quot;Final Doom&quot;, a package of two 32-level megawads created by TeamTNT, was released as an official id Software product.

Various first-person shooter games released at the time use the &quot;Doom&quot; engine under a commercial license from id Software, as such essentially being custom WADs packaged with the &quot;Doom&quot; engine, such as &quot;Hacx: Twitch &#x27;n Kill&quot; (1997).

In addition to the many people who contributed to commercially released WADs, various authors became involved with the development of other games:
* Kenneth Scott, who contributed artwork to &quot;Hacx: Twitch &#x27;n Kill&quot;, later became the art director at id Software and 343 Industries on the post-Bungie &quot;Halo&quot; games.
* Tim Willits, who contributed two levels to &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot;, later became the lead designer at id Software.
* Dario Casali, author of a quarter of &quot;Final Doom&quot;, was hired by Valve to work on &quot;Half-Life&quot;.
* Sverre Kvernmo, designer of five levels in &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot; and member of TeamTNT, was hired by Ion Storm for &quot;Daikatana&quot;.
* Iikka Keränen, author of several &quot;Doom&quot; WADs and later &quot;Quake&quot; mods, was hired by Ion Storm to create levels for &quot;Anachronox&quot; and &quot;Daikatana&quot;, and by Looking Glass Studios to create levels for &quot;Thief II: The Metal Age&quot;. Keränen was later hired by Valve.
* John Anderson (level designer), also known as &quot;Dr. Sleep&quot;, author of five levels in &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot; and E4M7 in &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;, later worked on &quot;Blood&quot;, &quot;Unreal&quot;, and &quot;Daikatana&quot;.
* Matthias Worch (level designer) joined Ritual Entertainment to work on &quot;SiN&quot;. He later contributed to the &quot;Unreal&quot; series.

===Source port era===

Around 1997, interest in &quot;Doom&quot; WADs began to decline, as attention was drawn to newer games with more advanced technology and more customizable design, including id Software&#x27;s own &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Quake II&quot;, but a dedicated following continued into the new century, with modern &quot;Doom&quot; modding becoming more popular than &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Quake II&quot; modding.

On December 23, 1997, id Software released the source code to the &quot;Doom&quot; engine, initially under a restrictive license. On October 3, 1999, it was released again under the terms of the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later. With the source code available, it became possible for programmers to modify any aspect of the game, remove technical limitations and bugs, and add entirely new features.

These engine modifications, or &quot;Doom&quot; source ports, have since become the target for much of the WAD editing activity, and with the decline of MS-DOS, using a source port became the only feasible way to play &quot;Doom&quot; for most people. Several source ports are in active development, and &quot;Doom&quot; retains a strong following of WAD creators.

==Types of WADs==
===Levels===
The most common type of WAD consists of a single level, usually retaining the theme of the original game, but possibly including new music and some modified graphics to define a more distinctive setting or mood. Both single-player and deathmatch multiplayer levels are common.

WADs may have a level pack in the form of an &quot;episode&quot;, replacing nine levels, and sometimes in the form of a &quot;megawad&quot;, which replaces 15 or more levels in the game (27 in &quot;Doom&quot;, 32 in &quot;Doom II&quot;, 36 in &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;).

===Total conversions===
A WAD that gives the game an overhaul to incorporate an entirely different game setting, character set, and story, instead of simply providing new levels or graphic changes, is called a &quot;total conversion&quot;. The phrase was coined by Justin Fisher, as part of the title of &quot;Aliens TC&quot;, or &quot;Aliens Total Conversion&quot;. Add-ons that provide extensive changes to a similar degree but retain distinctive parts or characteristics of the original games, such as characters or weapons, are often by extension called &quot;partial conversions&quot;.

==List of WADs==
Since custom map editing started in 1994, many &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II&quot; and &quot;Doom 64&quot; WADs have been created, and some have acquired fame even outside of the modding community. The following is a select listing of popular and historically significant WADs.
===Megawads===

* &quot;Alien Vendetta&quot; is a 32-level megawad for &quot;Doom II&quot; created by a mapping group led by Anders Johnson in 2001. This mod is widely acclaimed by the Doom community. &quot;Doomworld&quot; writer Cyb later called it the &quot;last great classical megawad” in the influential &quot;10 Years of Doom&quot; article. &quot;Alien Vendetta&quot; also contains what &quot;Doomworld&quot; deemed to be the most memorable map of all time, &quot;Misri Halek&quot; by Kim Andre Malde.

* &quot;Bloom&quot; is a &quot;Doom II&quot; and &quot;Blood&quot; crossover released by Bloom Team in 2021. It features over 50 new enemy types, a new episode and an original soundtrack.
* &quot;Eternal Doom&quot; is a 32-level megawad for &quot;Doom II&quot; created by Team Eternal and TeamTNT. It was released non-commercially in several versions, with the final one being released on November 14, 1997. &quot;Eternal Doom&quot; received media attention in 2020, when through further modding, it was played through &quot;Doom Eternal&quot;.
* &quot;Going Down&quot; is a 32-level megawad for &quot;Doom II&quot; released in 2013, and a winner in that year&#x27;s &quot;Cacowards&quot;. It was created by the English freelance animator Cyriak Harris. 
* &quot;Icarus: Alien Vanguard&quot; is a 32-level megawad for &quot;Doom II&quot; created by TeamTNT and released on March 22, 1996. It was developed as a freeware release after &quot;TNT: Evilution&quot; was picked up by id Software to be released as part of &quot;Final Doom&quot;.
* &quot;Memento Mori&quot; is a 32-level megawad for &quot;Doom II&quot; created by two members of The Innocent Crew, Denis and Thomas Möller, along with other authors, including Tom Mustaine and both Dario and Milo Casali. It was initially released on December 10, 1995, and saw an updated release in February 1996. A 32-level sequel megawad, &quot;Memento Mori II&quot;, was created and released on July 27, 1996. In &quot;Doomworld&#x27;s&quot; Top 100 WADs of All Time, &quot;Memento Mori&quot; was voted as the #1 WAD of 1996, and its sequel as #2.
* &quot;Requiem&quot; is a 32-level megawad for &quot;Doom II&quot; created by the same people that worked on the previously released Memento Mori series, in addition to some new mappers that worked specifically on this project. It was released and uploaded on the idgames archive on July 4, 1997.
* In 2016, John Romero released two new maps – &quot;Phobos Mission Control&quot; and &quot;Tech Gone Bad&quot;. After the positive response, he released &quot;Sigil&quot;, a complete 9-level episode, in May 2019. &quot;Sigil&quot; later received a sequel, &quot;Sigil II&quot;.

===Total conversions===
* &quot;Action Doom 2: Urban Brawl&quot; is a 2008 indie game developed by &quot;Scuba Steve&quot; Browning with the ZDoom source port. The game features cel-shaded graphics reminiscent of a comic book, and is played in the style of a beat &#x27;em up, with some gunplay present as well.
* &quot;Aliens TC&quot; is an 11-level total conversion based on the film &quot;Aliens&quot;, created by Justin Fisher and released on November 3, 1994. In 2017, another modder by the name of Kontra_Kommando made a remake of &quot;Aliens TC&quot;.
* &quot;Ashes 2063&quot; is a post-apocalypse themed TC created by Vostyok. Inspired by 1980s post-apocalyptic films, it features new monsters, weapons and an original soundtrack. The game currently features multiple full-length single player campaigns with branching storylines.
* &quot;Batman Doom&quot; is a 32-level total conversion created by ACE Team Software and released in April 1999. It contains modified game behavior along with new weapons, items, and characters from the world of the comic book superhero Batman.
* &quot;Chex Quest&quot; is a 5-level total conversion released in 1996 by Digital Café so that &quot;Doom&quot; could be approved for younger audiences. This was originally packaged in Chex cereal boxes as a prize, though &quot;Chex Quest&quot; was later put up as freeware on the Internet after the promotion ended. &quot;Chex Quest&quot; received two sequels, &quot;Chex Quest 2: Flemoids Take Chextropolis&quot; and &quot;Chex Quest 3&quot;, released in 1997 and 2008, respectively, both of which contained five levels and were released as freeware. 
* &quot;Doom 64: Retribution&quot; is a remake of &quot;Doom 64&quot;, the Nintendo 64 version of &quot;Doom&quot;, which differs drastically from its DOS version. &quot;Doom 64: Retribution&quot; contains different levels, graphics, and audio based on the Nintendo 64 game.
* &quot;Grezzo 2&quot; is a 2012 total conversion developed by Italian game designer Nicola Piro, notable for plagiarizing other games and &quot;Doom&quot; mods, and for its vulgar, blasphemous content.
* &quot;Sonic Robo Blast 2&quot; is a &quot;Doom&quot; modification that uses the Doom Legacy source port to completely change the game from a first-person shooter to a third-person platformer based on Sonic the Hedgehog. In 2018, &quot;Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart&quot;, a kart racing game based on the game, was released as a standalone modification. 
* &quot;Void&quot; is a single-level modification based on the 2000 game &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;, which was itself made by former id Software employee American McGee.

===Miscellaneous===

* &quot;D!Zone&quot; – created by WizardWorks, an expansion pack featuring hundreds of levels for &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot;. &quot;D!Zone&quot; was reviewed in 1995 in &quot;Dragon&quot; by Jay &amp; Dee in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. Jay gave the pack 1 out of 5 stars, while Dee gave the pack 1½ stars.
* &quot;Origwad&quot; – created by Jeff Bird and released on March 7, 1994, it is notable for being the first custom WAD to be released for &quot;Doom&quot;. &quot;Origwad&quot; consists of a single level with two rooms separated by one door, and a total of six enemies, making it very basic compared to later WADs.
* &quot;The Harris levels&quot; – &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot; levels created by Eric Harris, one of the two perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre, believed to have surfaced on the Internet in 1996 or 1997, but were taken down by the FBI after the 1999 massacre. Downloads for the levels Deathmatching in Bricks (BRICKS.WAD), Hockey.wad (HOCKEY.WAD), KILLER (KILLER.WAD), Mortal Kombat Doom (FIGHTME.WAD), Outdoors (outdoors.wad), Station (STATION.WAD), and UAC Labs (UACLABS.WAD) have been found in the years since. Dylan Klebold, a friend of Harris and the other perpetrator of the massacre, was credited by Harris for playtesting Deathmatching in Bricks. The ENDOOM screen for UAC Labs shows the names of other WADs made by Harris, though they have since been lost: Assault, Techout, Thrasher, Realdeth, and Realdoom, which is a patch for another WAD. UAC Labs was mentioned in Doomworld&#x27;s Top 10 Infamous WADs list. 
* &quot;Lullaby&quot;, a level created by &quot;Danlex&quot; in 2021 which contained surreal visuals. 
* &quot;National Videogame Museum&quot;, a recreation of the real life National Videogame Museum by employee Chris Bacarani. The level took over a year to make, and is featured as an exhibit in the physical museum. 
* &quot;Nuts!&quot; – released in 2001, &quot;Nuts&quot; is one of the first documented joke WADs. &quot;Nuts&quot; consists of a single room, with an invulnerability power up, plasma rifle, BFG, and 10,617 enemy monsters. Its creator, B.P.R.D, created multiple sequels, and a version of &quot;Nuts&quot; was made in &quot;Dusk&quot;.
* &quot;The Sky May Be&quot; – a notable joke WAD, most of the game takes place in an oversized sector, where many textures are replaced with solid colors, and many sounds replaced with audio from Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus. The WAD was mentioned in Doomworld&#x27;s The Top 10 Infamous WADs list and is sometimes considered to be one of the worst WADs ever created.
* &quot;UAC Military Nightmare&quot; – a Skulltag WAD made by &quot;Terry&quot; in 2008 which was notorious for its use of vulgar scripts, jump scares, strange graphics, absurd difficulty, and otherwise-useless data that existed to either bloat the WAD&#x27;s file size or tamper with the player&#x27;s settings. The WAD itself was removed from Doomworld in 2014 due to the aforementioned useless data, but has since been reuploaded with said data removed. This WAD spawned a genre of WADs known as &quot;Terrywads&quot;, or &quot;Terry Traps&quot;, which contain similar content to &quot;UAC Military Nightmare&quot;. In 2008, &quot;UAC Military Nightmare&quot; received a &quot;Cacoward&quot; for Worst WAD, wherein it is described as &quot;the worst wad file the world has ever known&quot;.
* &quot;Lilith&quot; – a wad created in 2017 that uses glitches in the ZDoom sourceport to create graphical and musical distortion, and changes in enemy behavior, resulting in a &quot;glitchcore nightmare&quot;. &quot;Lilith&quot; was also a winner in the 2017 &quot;Cacowards&quot;.
* &quot;MyHouse.wad&quot; – posted by Doomworld user Steve Nelson (Veddge) in March 2023, &quot;MyHouse.wad&quot; was supposedly a remake of a WAD made by the creator&#x27;s recently deceased friend, featuring that friend&#x27;s house. In reality, the WAD is a liminal horror map loosely inspired by the 2000 novel &quot;House of Leaves&quot; by Mark Z. Danielewski, and the online urban legend The Backrooms. It also has a number of other references to other things on the internet considered mysterious, such as an area inspired by the art of Jared Pike, and also using previously mysterious Fex single Subways of Your Mind. Being an extremely cryptic and surreal experience, it features an abundance of lore found both in-game and across other sources on the Internet. It is praised as one of &quot;Doom II&quot;″s most technologically advanced mods. 

====Freedoom====

Freedoom is a project aiming to create a free replacement (modified BSD License) for the set of graphics, music, sound effects, and levels (and miscellaneous other resources) used by &quot;Doom&quot;. Since the &quot;Doom&quot; engine is free software, it can be distributed along with the new resources, in effect providing a full, free game.

The project distributes three IWAD files: the two single-player campaigns named &quot;Freedoom: Phase 1&quot; and &quot;Freedoom: Phase 2&quot;, and &quot;FreeDM&quot;, which contains a collection of deathmatch levels. Originally a Boom-oriented mapset, it was later made merely limit-removing, and finally fully vanilla compatible, allowing play through the original executable and conservative ports like Chocolate Doom.

A similar project, &quot;Blasphemer&quot;, aims to create a complete free version of &quot;Heretic&quot;, but is less fully developed than Freedoom, from which it has recycled assets. Currently three episodes are drafted and a deathmatch set called BlasphDM is available. &quot;Zauberer&quot; and &quot;Lastermaul&quot; have also been initiated for &quot;Hexen&quot;, and &quot;Animosity&quot; for &quot;Strife&quot;.

==Editing==
Many level editors are available for &quot;Doom&quot;. The original Doom Editing Utility (DEU) was ported to a number of operating systems, but lost significance over time; many modern &quot;Doom&quot; editors still have their roots in DEU and its editing paradigm, including DETH, DeePsea, Linux Doom Editor, and Yadex and its fork Eureka. Other level editors include WadAuthor, Doom Builder (released in January 2003), Doom Builder 2 (released in May 2009 as the successor to Doom Builder), GZDoom Builder (released in March 2012), and Doom Builder X (released in September 2017). Some &quot;Doom&quot; level editors, such as Doom Builder family feature a 3D editing mode. As of now, these variants have been discontinued, but a newer fork has been released and is regularly updated, known as Ultimate Doom Builder.

Many specialized &quot;Doom&quot; editors are used to modify graphics and audio lumps, such as XWE, SLADE, Wintex, and SLumpEd. The DeHackEd executable patching utility modifies monsters, items, and weapon behavior. In ZDoom, users can create new monsters, weapons, and items through a scripting language called DECORATE, made to address many of the shortcomings of DeHackEd, such as not being able to add new objects, and not being able to deviate far from the behavior of the original weapons and monsters.

==WAD2 and WAD3==
In &quot;Quake&quot;, WAD files were replaced with PAK files. WAD files still remain in &quot;Quake&quot; files, though their use is limited to textures. Since WAD2 and WAD3 use a slightly larger directory structure, they are incompatible with &quot;Doom&quot;.

<text>Bennett College is a private historically black liberal arts college for women in Greensboro, North Carolina. It was founded in 1873 as a normal school to educate freedmen and train both men and women as teachers. Originally coed, in 1926 it became a four-year women&#x27;s college. It is one of two historically black colleges that enroll only women, the other being Spelman College.

In 1956, Willa Beatrice Player was installed at Bennett College, becoming the first African-American woman president of an accredited, four-year liberal arts college. She encouraged her students to be activists in the issues of the day. Beginning in 1960, Bennett students took part in the ultimately successful campaign in Greensboro to integrate white lunch counters at local variety stores. The college expanded its academic offerings and classes related to women&#x27;s leadership.

In December 2018, the college&#x27;s regional accrediting body, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, announced that it intended to revoke Bennett College&#x27;s accreditation. The college had been on probation for two years due to its considerable financial challenges. The college launched an emergency funding campaign, &quot;Change and Progress for Bennett&quot;, to raise at least $5 million. By February 2019, the campaign raised $8.2 million. That same month, SACS withdrew accreditation from the college despite fundraising efforts; however, Bennett College filed a lawsuit against the accreditor and the court ordered the accreditation to remain in place pending the legal challenge.

On June 27, 2019, Bennett announced that Suzanne Walsh would be its new president.

== History ==
Bennett College was founded on August 1, 1873, as a normal school for teacher training. It opened with seventy African-American men and women (freedmen, or former slaves). The school&#x27;s founder, Albion W. Tourgee, was a Civil War veteran and jurist from Ohio who worked in North Carolina during Reconstruction and championed the cause of racial justice.

The school held its inaugural classes in the basement of Warnersville Methodist Episcopal Church North (now St. Matthew&#x27;s United Methodist) in Greensboro. Bennett was coeducational and offered both high school and college-level courses, to help many blacks compensate for their previous lack of educational opportunity. The year after its founding, the school became sponsored by the Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society and Southern Education Society of the northern Methodist Episcopal Church (like the Baptists, the Methodist churches had split in the years before the war over the issue of slavery, and established two regional conferences). Bennett remained affiliated for 50 years with the Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society.

In 1878, freedmen purchased land for a future college campus (which was developed as the current site). Hearing about the college, New York businessman Lyman Bennett (1801–1879) provided $10,000 in funding to build a permanent campus. Bennett died soon after. The college was named Bennett Seminary. Hearing of Bennett&#x27;s philanthropy, his coworkers commissioned a bell to be made in his honor and continued his mission by donating the bell to the school.

In 1888, Bennett Seminary elected its first African-American president, the Reverend Charles N. Grandison. Grandison spearheaded a successful drive to have the school chartered as a four-year college in 1889. Two of the first African-American bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church were graduates of the college, including Robert Elijah Jones, an 1895 graduate. His brother was the future Bennett College president David Dallas Jones. Under the direction of Reverend Grandison and succeeding President Jordan Chavis, Bennett College grew from 11 undergraduate students to a total of 251 undergraduates by 1905. The enrollment leveled out in the 1910s at roughly 300.

In 1916, a survey conducted by the Phelps-Stokes Foundation recommended Bennett College be converted to a college exclusively for women. The Women&#x27;s Home Missionary Society, which had supported women at the college since 1886, had found that there was no four-year college exclusively for African-American women, and they wanted to establish such a college. The North Carolina Board of Education offered Bennett College for that purpose.

After ten years, during which it studied other locations and conducted fundraising, the Women&#x27;s Home Missionary Society and the NC Board of Education decided to develop the college in its current location. Bennett fully transitioned to a women&#x27;s college in 1926. (Note: The Women&#x27;s Home Missionary Society&#x27;s on-campus involvement with Bennett women dates back to 1886.) Around this time, Bennett alumnae were nicknamed the &quot;Bennett Belles&quot; and the school gained a reputation as an institution of quality.

In 1926, David Dallas Jones was installed as president of the new women&#x27;s college and served. Under his leadership, the college expanded, reaching an enrollment of 400. It became known in the black community as the Vassar College of the South, and Jones recruited faculty, staff, and students, from all cultural and ethnic backgrounds. The school was expanded to a 42-acre campus with 33 buildings, and its endowment increased to $1.5 million. Although he had major achievements, Jones&#x27;s tenure was also marked with controversy.

In 1937, Bennett students protested downtown Greensboro movie theaters because of their segregation, which was state law at the time, and the depictions of black women in films they were showing. Frances Jones, daughter of the college president, led the protest; she was in her first year. This protest during the Great Depression and under Jim Crow conditions in the South, resulted in President Jones being investigated by the FBI and other government agencies. They were concerned about communist and leftist activities, as these groups were politically active in the United States. They ordered him to prohibit the students from protesting. Jones refused.

At his invitation, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt came to the college on March 22, 1945, to meet with an integrated group of schoolchildren from Greensboro. Other visitors to the campus included Benjamin Elijah Mays, former Morehouse College president; poet Robert Frost, and writer James Weldon Johnson. Jones led the college for almost 30 years until he became ill in 1955, when he named Willa B. Player interim president. Player was the first female president of Bennett College, and the first black female president of any accredited four-year college in the United States. During Player&#x27;s tenure, Bennett became the first black college to be fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Note: (Bennett&#x27;s brother college is Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. This relationship developed through the historic friendship of David Dallas Jones and Benjamin E. Mays.)

In October 1956, Willa Beatrice Player was inaugurated as President of Bennett College. She was the first African-American woman to be president of a four-year, fully accredited liberal arts college or university. During Player&#x27;s tenure, Bennett in 1957 was one of the first historically black colleges to receive accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). On February 11, 1958, Player allowed civil rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to speak at the school; he was prohibited by the city from speaking publicly anywhere else in Greensboro. His speech was entitled &quot;A Realistic Look At Race Relations,&quot; and was delivered to a standing-room-only audience at Annie Merner Pfeiffer Chapel on campus. Player said about this visit, &quot;Bennett College is a liberal arts college where &#x27;freedom rings,&#x27; so King can speak here.&quot; King, Howard Thurman and Benjamin Elijah Mays inspired Bennett students to begin protests, and they became known as &quot;Bennett Belles&quot;.

===Civil Rights Movement===
Civil rights activism at Bennett increased throughout the Civil rights movement. In February 1960 students from Bennett College and North Carolina A&amp;T began a civil rights protest in downtown Greensboro that sparked the Greensboro sit-ins. Bettye Davis, class of 1963, committed to sitting at the white-only lunch counter of F. and W. Woolworth&#x27;s variety store with students from A&amp;T, and to keep returning until the store integrated the facility. On February 4, 1960, close to a dozen &quot;Bennett Belles&quot; were arrested due to their continuing protest at Woolworth&#x27;s.

On April 21, 1960, Bennett and A&amp;T students were arrested for trespassing at the white S.H. Kress &amp; Co. lunch counter. On April 22, 1960, &quot;The Daily News&quot; of New York broke the story of the arrests nationally, with front-page headlines and a picture of well-dressed female students entering the back of a paddy wagon without any help from the police officers surrounding it. It reported that Greensboro police were surprised that the &quot;Bennett Belles&quot; had protested, as they were considered refined young women from an &quot;elitist finishing school.&quot; At the peak of the sit-in movement, more than 40% of Bennett&#x27;s student body was jailed. President Player personally visited the students in jail, carrying assignments to them so they would not fall behind in their studies.

Willa B. Player led Bennett until 1966. She was succeeded by Isaac H. Miller. His father had been an administrator at Bennett during President Frank Trigg&#x27;s tenure. Miller maintained the &quot;Bennett Ideal,&quot; despite the social changes of the late 1960s. Students protested the strict dress codes, disciplinary policies, and curfew. During the 1967–1968 school year, freshwomen walked out of dormitories one minute before curfew. Students took over the student union while demanding change to college policies. Miller surrounded the buildings with campus security, and brought in family and sleeping bags, changing the protest to a campus-wide &quot;sleepover&quot;. Students were required to wear dresses or skirts, and hats and gloves until the early 1970s.

Miller collaborated with other colleges and universities in Greensboro to form a consortium that expanded Bennett&#x27;s academic program by giving students access to other local universities. His administration developed the biomedical research and interdisciplinary studies programs, along with a bridge program in conjunction with Meharry Medical College of Nashville, Tennessee. He collaborated with other HBCU presidents to establish the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, serving on the first board of directors. Miller&#x27;s plans were supported by alumnae, who donated material and fiscal resources.

Miller increased Bennett&#x27;s endowment and also completed the construction of four new buildings on campus. He served as president for 21 years, the second-longest presidential tenure in Bennett College history, and during a period of considerable social change. He retired in 1987. Gloria Randle Scott became Bennett&#x27;s 12th president and its second woman in that position.

Gloria Randle Scott started as President of Bennett College on July 1, 1987. She established the Women&#x27;s Leadership Institute and the Center for African Women and Women of the African Diaspora. Bennett admitted new African immigrants as well as students who were African nationals. In 1989, poet and activist Maya Angelou was installed as a member of the board of trustees. Scott was President of Bennett for 14 years before retiring in 2001.

=== 21st Century ===
Bennett underwent numerous changes under Sister President Emerita Johnnetta B. Cole, who was inaugurated in July 2002. In her first year at Bennett, Cole erased the school&#x27;s $3.8 million deficit and raised an estimated $15 million in funding. Before Cole&#x27;s tenure, Bennett College had been under SACS probation for two years, which was finally lifted in 2002. The school was revitalized and much-needed renovations were made to campus buildings; new buildings were built. In total, she led a $50 million campaign.

Numerous prominent figures spoke at the campus and some helped raise funds for its operations. Former President Bill Clinton, former US Senator Robert Dole, trustee emerita Maya Angelou, and Oprah Winfrey have all assisted in fundraising. The campaign closed successfully at the end of Cole&#x27;s tenure on June 30, 2007.

On July 1, 2007, Julianne Malveaux became President of Bennett College. She led a $21 million expansion and renovation project for the college. She increased enrollment, added four new buildings, including a multimedia center, and renovated additional buildings. Malveaux enhanced the overall academic curriculum, which focuses on women&#x27;s leadership, entrepreneurship, communications, and global studies.

On July 1, 2012, Esther Terry &#x27;61 became the first alumna to lead the college. Already serving as the college&#x27;s provost, Terry was made interim president for a full academic year. In 2013, the Board of Trustees announced Terry would be the sixteenth president of Bennett College.

Former provost Phyllis Worthy Dawkins assumed the presidency on August 15, 2016. Dawkins focused on faculty/staff recruitment and reinvigorating living-learning communities; she launched a leadership institute. She was replaced in 2019 by Suzanne Walsh, who was previously deputy director of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&#x27;s Postsecondary Success division.

Since 1930, Bennett has graduated more than 7,000 students.

=== Accreditations and memberships ===
In 1930, on the graduation of its first four women with a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree, the &quot;A&quot; rating was granted to the college by the North Carolina State Department of Education. This same rating was granted to the college in 1936 by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), the college&#x27;s regional accreditor. Today, the college is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) and the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE).

In 1957, Bennett was one of the first and the only private black college to be admitted into full membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. It has also been a member of the American Association of Colleges, The Commission on Black Colleges of the University Senate, the American Association of Registrars and Admission Officers, the American Council of Education, the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education, the College Fund/UNCF, the Council on Independent Colleges, the Women&#x27;s College Coalition, the North Carolina Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the NCB Piedmont Automated Library System (NCBPALS), the Greater Greensboro Consortium, and the New York University Faculty Resource Network.

The college lost its accreditation from SACS on February 18, 2019. It was on probation for two years in the early 2000s because the college was struggling with significant financial challenges. In 2016, SACS placed the college on probation again for the same reason. In December 2018, SACS voted to withdraw the college&#x27;s accreditation. The college launched a fundraising campaign and appealed the SACS decision.

In February 2019 it lost accreditation although it had succeeded in building its financial resources. A court ordered the accreditation to remain upright while the college filed a lawsuit against the accreditor.

== The Early/Middle College at Bennett College ==
The Middle College at Bennett is one of only two all-female high schools in the state of North Carolina. It began in 2003 as a &quot;middle college&quot;, serving female 11th- and 12th-grade students who were at risk of dropping out of high school. By 2006, with the help of The New Schools Project Reform Initiative, The Middle College expanded to include 9th and 10th graders and began offering dual enrollment. With dual enrollment, students take college courses and earn transferable college credit as they earn their high school diploma. Students begin taking college courses in their 9th-grade year and may earn up to two years of transferable college credit hours by completion of their senior year.

<text>The .30 carbine (7.62 × 33 mm) is a rimless carbine/rifle cartridge used in the M1 carbine introduced in the 1940s. It is a light rifle round designed to be fired from the M1 carbine&#x27;s 18-inch (458 mm) barrel.

==History==

Shortly before World War II, the U.S. Army started a &quot;light rifle&quot; project to provide support personnel and rear area units a weapon with more firepower and accuracy than the standard issue M1911A1 .45 ACP handgun and half the weight of the standard issue M1 Garand .30-06 rifle or the .45 ACP Thompson submachine gun. 

The .30 carbine cartridge was developed by Winchester and is basically a rimless .30 caliber (7.62 mm) version of the much older .32 Winchester Self-Loading cartridge of 1906 introduced for the Winchester Model 1905 rifle. (The .30 carbine&#x27;s relatively straight case and round nose bullet have misled some to believe it was designed for use in pistols.) The .30 carbine uses a lighter bullet (110 grain versus 165 grain) and improved powder. As a result, it has approximately 41% higher muzzle velocity with 27% more impact energy than the parent .32 WSL cartridge. 


At first, Winchester was tasked with developing the cartridge but did not submit a carbine design. Other firms and individual designers submitted several carbine designs, but most prototypes were either unreliable or grossly off the target weight of five pounds. Army Ordnance Major Rene Studler persuaded Winchester that the Winchester M2 .30-06 rifle, a design started by Ed Browning and perfected by Winchester engineers including Marshall &quot;Carbine&quot; Williams, could be scaled down for the .30 carbine cartridge. The result was the M1 carbine.

The M1 carbine was issued to infantry officers; machine gun, artillery and tank crews; paratroopers; and other line-of-communications personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand. Cavalry Reconnaissance units were primarily armed with the carbine. The weapon was originally issued with a 15-round detachable magazine. The carbine and cartridge were not intended to serve as a primary infantry weapon, nor was it comparable to more powerful intermediate cartridges later developed for assault rifles. The M2 carbine was introduced late in World War II with a selective-fire switch allowing optional fully automatic fire at a rather high rate (850–900 rpm) and a 30-round magazine.

The M1 and M2 carbines continued in service during the Korean War. A postwar U.S. Army evaluation reported that &quot;[t]here are practically no data bearing on the accuracy of the carbine at ranges in excess of 50 yards. The record contains a few examples of carbine-aimed fire felling an enemy soldier at this distance or perhaps a little more. But they are so few in number that no general conclusion can be drawn from them. Where carbine fire had proven killing effect, approximately 95 percent of the time the target was dropped at less than 50 yards.&quot; The evaluation also reported that &quot;[c]ommanders noted that it took two to three engagements at least to settle their men to the automatic feature of the carbine so that they would not greatly waste ammunition under the first impulse of engagement. By experience, they would come to handle it semiautomatically, but it took prolonged battle hardening to bring about this adjustment in the human equation.&quot;

==Development==
U.S. Army specifications for the new cartridge mandated the caliber to be greater than .27, with an effective range of 300 yards or more, and a midrange trajectory ordinate of or less at 300 yards. With these requirements in hand, Winchester&#x27;s Edwin Pugsley chose to design the cartridge with a .30 caliber, 100–120 grain bullet at a velocity of . The first cartridges were made by turning down rims on .32SL cases and loading with .308 caliber bullets which had a similar profile to those of the U.S. military .45 ACP bullets. The first 100,000 cartridges manufactured were headstamped &quot;.30 SL&quot; (for &quot;self-loading&quot;).

==Civilian use==
The popularity of the M1 carbine for collecting, sporting, and re-enactment use has resulted in continued civilian popularity of the .30 carbine cartridge. For hunting, it is considered a small-to-medium-game cartridge.

==Handguns==

A number of handguns have been chambered for .30 carbine ammunition. In 1944, Smith &amp; Wesson developed a hand-ejector revolver to fire .30 carbine. It went through 1,232 rounds without incident. From a four-inch (102 mm) barrel, it launched the standard GI ball projectile at , producing an average group of at ; the military decided not to adopt the revolver. The loud blast is the most oft-mentioned characteristic of the .30 carbine cartridge when fired in a handgun.

In 1958, the short-lived J. Kimball Arms Co. produced a .30 carbine caliber pistol that closely resembled a slightly scaled-up High Standard Field King .22 target pistol. The Ruger Blackhawk revolver chambered for the .30 carbine round has been in the catalogs since the late 1960s. Standard government-issue rounds reach over , with factory loads, and handloads producing similar velocities or tuned for more efficient short-barrel performance without excessive blast.

Plainfield Machine Corp. made a .30 caliber pistol from 1964 to 1983 named the &quot;Enforcer&quot;. While similar to the M1 carbine, it lacked the stock, thereby making it a handgun. Sold to Iver Johnson in 1983, the Enforcer continued in production until 1986. Other handguns chambered for this cartridge include the Thompson-Center Contender.

Plainfield Machine produced M1 carbines from 1960 to 1977, when they were bought out by Iver Johnson Corp, who has manufactured them at least until a 50th anniversary model in 1993. The Taurus Raging Thirty and AMT AutoMag III were also offered in .30 carbine.

==Comparison==

The .30 carbine was developed from the .32 Winchester Self-Loading used in an early semi-auto sporting rifle. A standard .30 carbine ball bullet weighs ; a complete loaded round weighs and has a muzzle velocity of , giving it of energy when fired from the M1 carbine&#x27;s 18-inch barrel.

By comparison, the .30-06 M2 cartridge for M1 Garand rifle fired a ball bullet weighing 152 grains (9.8 g) at a muzzle velocity of and of muzzle energy. Therefore, the M1 carbine is significantly less powerful than the M1 Garand. Another comparison is a .357 Magnum cartridge fired from an 18&quot; rifle barrel, which has a muzzle velocity range from about with energies at for a bullet at the low end and a bullet on the high end.

==Cartridge types==
Common types used by the military with the carbine include:

*&quot;Cartridge, caliber .30, carbine, ball, M1&quot; - It originally came in cartons of 45 cartridges, divided into three fold-out sections of 15 rounds. The M1 carbine had a magazine that contained exactly 15 rounds, so this prevented wastage or loss. It was changed to 50 rounds in 1942 to maximize the amount of ammo delivered.
*&quot;Cartridge, caliber .30, carbine, grenade, M6&quot; [Crimped case] - The grenade blank was used with the M8 rifle grenade launcher. It came in individual-issue cartons of 6 cartridges or full cartons of 50 cartridges. The large cartons were made of plain chipboard and were bulk-packed in terneplate-lined wooden packing crates (later in metal &quot;spam cans&quot; from 1944). Individual-issue cartons were originally sealed and waterproofed with a wax coating and then packed in rifle grenade crates. This was found to be ineffective, as the seal would get broken in handling and compromise the contents to salt air and moisture. It was later replaced with a heat-sealed foil-lined kraftpaper wrapping.From 1944 the M13 metal &quot;spam can&quot; was introduced. It was packed with an assortment of an individual 6-round carton of Carbine Grenade blanks M6, a 10-round carton of .30-06 Springfield Rifle Grenade blanks M3, and a 5-round packet of Grenade Auxiliary M7 cartridges. 
*&quot;Cartridge, dummy, caliber .30, carbine, M13&quot; - The cartridge had one hole drilled through the case and had no primer. It came in cartons of 50 cartridges. It was used to safely teach loading and unloading the M1 carbine to recruits.
*&quot;Cartridge, caliber .30, carbine, ball, high pressure test, M18&quot; [Tin-plated cartridge case] - This cartridge used the same spitzer-type bullet as the .30-06 Ball M2. It came in cartons of 50 rounds. First introduced in 1942, it was used to proof the carbine and its components at the factory or an army arsenal. The tinned case was adopted in 1943 to prevent its confusion with standard Ball ammunition. 
*&quot;Cartridge, caliber .30, carbine, tracer, M27&quot; [Red tipped bullet] - It came in cartons of 50 cartridges.
*&quot;7,62mm Kurz&quot; [German &gt; &quot;Short&quot;] - The NATO designation for .30 carbine ball M1 ammunition. It was first issued to the West German police forces and the auxiliaries in the Western Occupied Zones of Berlin, explaining its German-language designation. France used ammunition with this designation in Algeria.

==Synonyms==
*.30 M1 carbine
*7.62×33mm
*.30 SL (self-loading)

==As a parent case==
The .30 carbine cartridge was the basis for Melvin M. Johnson&#x27;s &quot;MMJ 5.7&quot; cartridge, colloquially called the .22 Spitfire (5.7x33mm) after what Col Johnson named his rebarreled or relined and rechambered Carbines. By necking the .30 carbine&#x27;s case down to a .224 caliber bullet and basing the cartridge ballistics around those of the .22 Hornet, he was attempting to improve the effective range of the M1 carbine while reducing recoil and &quot;muzzle rise&quot;. The Plainfield Machine Company (later taken over by Iver Johnson&#x27;s Arms) sold a sporting rifle copy of the M1 carbine chambered for this cartridge but only about 500 were made.

<text>Kenya Mountain is a non-fiction book written by E. A. T. Dutton about his trip up Mount Kenya in 1926. The original book was published in 1929 by Jonathan Cape in London, and contains a preface by Dutton and an introduction by Hilaire Belloc. There is also a fold out map of the route taken by Melhuish and Dutton in 1926.

==Overview==
&quot;Kenya Mountain&quot; documents the expedition of Melhuish and Dutton in 1926 up Mount Kenya. It starts at their departure from Nairobi in February. They make their way to Chogoria, at the base of the mountain, where they met the rest of their party and hired Mwimbi porters. On the first day they climbed through the forest to the lower regions of the bamboo zone, then continued fighting through the bamboo to the moorlands above.

At the moorlands the party split, with some remaining at this altitude to study plants. The rest continued higher, to their next camp at Hall Tarns where they ate the sheep they had brought up. The next day the party split again, with most of the porters staying at a lower altitude and climbing every day to the higher camp to bring firewood. Melhuish, Dutton and the rest of their porters struggled up the scree to reach the Curling Pond where a new hut had been built.

For the afternoon of the first day, Melhuish and then Dutton went on reconnaissance trips across the Lewis Glacier and nearby snowfields. They, and the Curling Pond, had changed significantly from their previous expedition in 1924. The following morning Melhuish went skating on the Curling Pond, much to the delight of the porters who had never seen &quot;a white man dancing with knives on his feet&quot;. They then set off to ascend Point Lenana, taking with them the first six Africans to ascend the peak.

One morning the expedition awoke to find a new pond at the doorway to the hut, fed by the Lewis Glacier and the Curling Pond. This caused the porters to become uneasy, as there were local superstitions about the mountain. They believed they were trespassing on the mountain and their God, Ngai, had sent this as a warning to them. The following day Dutton and Melhuish set off to climb to the summit of Batian, accompanied by several porters, but gave up after several hours as they could not find a way up. After attempting to climb a slab, one porter said &quot;there may be a way up, but there is no way down&quot;.

The following day they made another attempt on the summit. They reached the point that Arthur had reached, marked by a flag tied to a stick, before giving up. On their return to camp they had a snowball fight before packing up to return to the lower camp.

On the way down the mountain, the party visited the Nithi Falls, now called The Gates after the gorge of the Nithi River, before returning through the forest to Chogoria.

<text>A custom motorcycle is a motorcycle with stylistic and/or structural changes to the &#x27;standard&#x27; mass-produced machine offered by major manufacturers. Custom motorcycles might be unique, or built in limited quantities. While individual motorcyclists have altered the appearance of their machines since the first days of motorcycling, the first individualized motorcycles specifically labeled &#x27;Custom&#x27; appeared in the late 1950s, around the same time as the term was applied to custom cars.

In the 1960s, custom artisans like Arlen Ness and Ben Hardy created new styles of custom bikes, the chopper. In the 1990s and early 2000s, expensive customs such as those built by Orange County Choppers, Jesse James&#x27;s West Coast Choppers, Roger Goldammer became fashionable status symbols. There are also companies that are bringing back pin striping, such as Kenny Howard (also known as Von Dutch) and Dean Jeffries from the 1950s, with a continued effort to keep pin striping alive. The choppers of the 1960s and 1970s fit into this category.

Some motorcycle manufacturers, such as Harley-Davidson and Honda, include the word &quot;custom&quot; as part of a model name.
The &quot;factory custom&quot; segment has become the most visible in the custom industry in recent years. The original factory custom was the 1971 Harley-Davidson Super Glide, designed by Willie G. Davidson, which, imitating the custom scene of the time, combined the fork from a Sportster with the frame and engine of a big twin Electra Glide, thereby founding a style imitated by many other manufactures ever since. Harley-Davidson VRSC has often been completely customised by enthusiasts and independent workshops from bodykits to custom wheels and tire lettering.

Higher volume producers like American IronHorse, Bourget, Big Dog and BMC build custom motorcycles that also must meet basic safety requirements set by the US Department of Transportation. Factory customs allow the buyer to select from a wide range of options, paint styles, engine sizes and accessories while still having the confidence, support, warranty and finance options that typically are associated with major production manufacturers. Factory customs typically do not offer the total individuality of a home built bike or a &quot;one off custom&quot;, but they share much of the appeal that comes with a custom bike and many of the benefits of a factory production motorcycle.

In the early 2010s, a new generation of motorcycles called mini bike or scooter (motorcycle) won popularity. In mid -2010, numerous small motorcycles flooded the market, including Vespa and the Honda Grom, which is also known as Honda MSX.

<text>Vijay Lakshmi Pandit (&quot;née&quot; Swarup Nehru; 18 August 1900 – 1 December 1990) was an Indian freedom fighter, diplomat and politician. She served as the 8th President of the United Nations General Assembly from 1953 to 1954, the first woman and the only Indian to have been appointed to this post. She was also the 3rd Governor of Maharashtra from 1962 to 1964. Noted for her participation in the Indian independence movement, she was jailed several times during the movement.

In 1944, she visited the United States to raise awareness about the Indian affairs among the American people in order to counter the anti-Indian propaganda there. Following the independence of India, she was sent to London as India&#x27;s most important diplomat after serving as India&#x27;s envoy to the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Nations. Hailing from the prominent Nehru-Gandhi political family, her brother Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of independent India, her niece Indira Gandhi was the first female Prime Minister of India and her grand-nephew Rajiv Gandhi was the sixth and youngest Prime Minister of India.

==Early life==
Vijaya Lakshmi&#x27;s (born Swarup) father, Motilal Nehru (1861–1931), a wealthy barrister who belonged to the Kashmiri Pandit community, served twice as President of the Indian National Congress during the Independence Struggle. Her mother, Swaruprani Thussu (1868–1938), who came from a well-known Kashmiri Pandit family settled in Lahore, was Motilal&#x27;s second wife, the first having died in child birth. She was the second of three children; Jawaharlal was eleven years her senior (b. 1889), while her younger sister Krishna Hutheesing (1907–1967) became a noted writer and authored several books on their brother.

== Career ==

She attended the 1916 Congress session that took place in Lucknow. She was impressed by Sarojini Naidu and Annie Besant.

In 1920, she spent time in Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s ashram close to Ahmedabad. She participated in daily chores including dairy work and spinning. She also worked in the office that used to publish &quot;Young India&quot;.

Pandit was the first Indian woman to hold a cabinet post in pre-independent India. In 1936, she stood in general elections and became a member of parliament by 1937 for the constituency of Cawnpore Bilhaur. In 1937, she was elected to the provincial legislature of the United Provinces and was designated minister of local self-government and public health. She held the latter post until 1938 and again from 1946 to 1947.

She spent significant time in jail for her participation in the Indian independence movement. She was jailed for 18 months from 1931 to 1933. She was jailed again for 6 months in 1940 before getting jailed in 1942 for 7 months over her participation in the Quit India Movement. After her release, she helped the victims of the Bengal famine of 1943 and served as president of the &quot;Save the Children Fund Committee&quot; which rescued poor children from the streets.

Following the death of her husband in 1944, she experienced Indian inheritance laws for Hindu widows and campaigned with All India Women&#x27;s Conference to bring changes to these laws.

In 1944, she visited the United States to raise awareness about the Indian affairs among the American people in order to counter the anti-Indian propaganda there.

In 1946, she was elected to the Constituent Assembly from the United Provinces.

Following India&#x27;s independence from British rule in 1947 she entered the diplomatic service and became India&#x27;s ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1947 to 1949, the United States and Mexico from 1949 to 1951, Ireland from 1955 to 1961 (during which time she was also the Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom), and Spain from 1956 to 1961. Between 1946 and 1968, she headed the Indian delegation to the United Nations. In 1953, she became the first woman President of the United Nations General Assembly (she was inducted as an honorary member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority in 1978 for this accomplishment). That same year she was a candidate for Secretary General of the United Nations.

Hon. Members Shrimati Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit has resigned her seat in the House with effect from 17 December 1954.

In India, she served as Governor of Maharashtra from 1962 to 1964. She returned as a member of parliament for 1964 to 1968 with her election victory in Phulpur. Pandit was a harsh critic of Indira Gandhi&#x27;s years as prime minister especially after Indira had declared the emergency in 1975.

Pandit retired from active politics after relations between them soured. On retiring, she moved to Dehradun in the Doon Valley in the Himalayan foothills. She came out of retirement in 1977 to campaign against Indira Gandhi and helped the Janata Party win the 1977 election. She was reported to have considered running for the presidency, but Neelam Sanjiva Reddy eventually ran and won the election unopposed.

In 1979, she was appointed the Indian representative to the UN Human Rights Commission, after which she retired from public life. Her writings include &quot;The Evolution of India&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Scope of Happiness: A Personal Memoir&quot; (1979).

==Personal life==

In 1921, she married Ranjit Sitaram Pandit (1921–1944), a successful barrister from Kathiawar, Gujarat and classical scholar who translated Kalhana&#x27;s epic history Rajatarangini into English from Sanskrit. Her husband was a Maharashtrian Saraswat Brahmin, whose family hailed from village of Bambuli, on the Ratnagiri coast, in Maharashtra. He was arrested for his support of Indian independence and died in Lucknow prison in 1944, leaving behind his wife and their three daughters Chandralekha Mehta, Nayantara Sehgal and Rita Dar.

She died in 1990. She was survived by her daughters, Chandralekha and Nayantara Sahgal.

== Academics ==

She was the member of Aligarh Muslim University Executive Council.

She was an Honorary Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford, where her niece studied Modern History. A portrait of her by Edward Halliday hangs in the Somerville College Library.

<text>Shanice Lorraine Wilson-Knox (née Wilson; born May 14, 1973) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress and dancer. She had the &quot;Billboard&quot; hit singles &quot;I Love Your Smile&quot; and &quot;Silent Prayer&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Saving Forever for You&quot; in 1993. In 1999, Shanice scored another hit song with &quot;When I Close My Eyes&quot;, which peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. She is recognized for her coloratura soprano voice and her ability to sing in the whistle register.

==Early life==
Shanice Lorraine Wilson was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and she moved to Los Angeles with her mother Crystal and her aunt Penni. Her mother and aunt went to Los Angeles in pursuit of careers in the music industry. They shifted their focus to Shanice and formed the management company Crystal Penni to cultivate and promote her talents. Shanice was age nine when she appeared in a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial with jazz vocalist Ella Fitzgerald. In 1984, she was part of the regular cast in the first thirteen episodes of the children&#x27;s program &quot;Kids Incorporated.&quot; Shanice competed on &quot;Star Search&quot; at age eleven, and later signed with A&amp;M Records.

==Recording career==
In 1987, at the age of 14, A&amp;M Records released her debut album &quot;Discovery&quot;. It produced two top-ten R&amp;B hits: &quot;(Baby Tell Me) Can You Dance&quot; and &quot;No ½ Steppin&#x27;&quot;. Shanice signed a deal with Motown Records in the summer of 1990, releasing &quot;Inner Child&quot; in late 1991, which included her best-known hit single &quot;I Love Your Smile&quot;. It reached the top-ten in 22 countries, including the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album also featured a cover of Minnie Riperton&#x27;s 1974 hit &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot;, a rendition that brought attention to her three-and-a-half octave vocal range. In 1993, Kenny Loggins featured Shanice on his live album &quot;&quot;.

In 1994, Shanice released the album &quot;21... Ways to Grow&quot;, with producer Rhett Lawrence, a session musician and Earth Wind &amp; Fire guitarist Dick Smith. This effort was followed by a move to LaFace Records in 1997, which later released the 1999 album &quot;Shanice.&quot; Additionally, she has contributed to various film soundtracks, such as &quot;Boomerang&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Love You&quot;) and &quot;The Meteor Man&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s for You&quot;). Achieving success with her top-ten hit &quot;Saving Forever for You&quot;, from the &quot;Beverly Hills 90210 Soundtrack&quot;, Shanice later recorded &quot;If I Never Knew You&quot;, a duet with Jon Secada, for the original soundtrack of Disney&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Pocahontas.&quot; While still with Motown, she also recorded a cover version of &quot;If I Were Your Woman&quot; by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips. Tami Roman and the fellow members of her R&amp;B group quartet Female provided the backing vocals in the song, released via the &quot;Panther&quot; soundtrack on May 2, 1995, weeks before the &quot;Pocahontas&quot; soundtrack was released on May 30.

Shanice occasionally does background vocals for other artists; she can be heard on Toni Braxton&#x27;s &quot;Come on Over Here&quot; and &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;, as well as Usher&#x27;s &quot;Bedtime&quot;. In 2010, she performed vocals on the track &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; from Michael Jackson&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;Michael&quot;. She recorded the song &quot;A Midnight Rendezvous&quot; for the 2012 Kinect game &quot; Rhythm Party&quot;. She also performed &quot;Love Is the Gift&quot;, the English theme song for the video game &quot;The Bouncer&quot;. Shanice returned to recording after a five-year hiatus and released her album &quot;Every Woman Dreams&quot; on her own label Imajah (named for her two children). The album peaked at No. 30 on the R&amp;B Albums Chart.

In 2019, Shanice returned with the single &quot;He Won&#x27;t&quot;. In 2022, she was selected to sing the theme song of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; spinoff series &quot;Mecha Builders&quot; alongside Eric Bellinger.

==Acting and other appearances==
In addition to singing, Shanice is also an actress, first appearing in &quot;Rock Enroll&quot;, a season five episode of &quot;Family Matters&quot;. In 2001, she made an appearance as a singer on her husband Flex&#x27;s TV show &quot;One on One&quot;. That same year, she starred in the TV movie &quot; One Special Moment,&quot; an adaptation of Brenda Jackson&#x27;s 1998 novel of the same name.

In 1997, Shanice became the first Black performer to star in the role of Eponine in the musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot; on Broadway. In 2011, she joined Niecy Nash and Frenchie Davis for the 21st Annual &quot;Divas Simply Singing&quot; HIV/AIDS charity event. Shanice and her husband, Flex, also starred in the reality show &quot;Flex &amp; Shanice&quot;, which premiered on the Oprah Winfrey Network on November 1, 2014.

In 2021, Shanice appeared as herself, performing on the Ladies First tour with Kelly Price and Chanté Moore during season 2 episode 10 of the TV series First Wives Club.

==Personal life==
On February 19, 2000, Shanice married actor and comedian Flex Alexander. They have two children, daughter Imani Shekinah Knox (born August 23, 2001) and son Elijah Alexander Knox (born March 5, 2004).

<doc id="1050858" wikidata="Q712139" url="?curid=1050858" title="Porter Wagoner">
<text>Porter Wayne Wagoner (August 12, 1927 – October 28, 2007) was an American country music singer known for his flashy Nudie and Manuel suits and blond pompadour.

In 1967, he introduced singer Dolly Parton on his television show, &quot;The Porter Wagoner Show&quot;. She became part of a well-known vocal duo with him from the late 1960s to the early 1970s.

Known as Mr. Grand Ole Opry, Wagoner charted 81 singles from 1954 to 1983. He was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Wagoner was born in West Plains, Missouri, United States, the fifth and last child, and second son, of Bertha May (née Bridges) and Charles E. Wagoner, a farmer. His first band, the Blue Ridge Boys, performed on radio station KWPM-AM from a butcher shop in his native West Plains, where Wagoner cut meat. In 1951, he was hired by Si Siman as a performer on KWTO in Springfield, Missouri. This led to a contract with RCA Victor.

With lagging sales, Wagoner and his trio played schoolhouses for the gate proceeds; but in 1953 his song &quot;Trademark&quot; became a hit for Carl Smith, followed by a few hits of his own for RCA Victor. Starting in 1955, he was a featured performer on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; in Springfield. He often appeared on the show as part of the Porter Wagoner Trio with Don Warden and Speedy Haworth. Warden, on steel guitar, became Wagoner&#x27;s long-time business manager. In 1957, Wagoner and Warden moved to Nashville, Tennessee, joining the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;.

=== Chart success ===
Wagoner&#x27;s 81 charted records include &quot;A Satisfied Mind&quot; (No. 1, 1955), &quot;Misery Loves Company&quot; (No. 1, 1962), &quot;I&#x27;ve Enjoyed as Much of This as I Can Stand&quot; (No. 7, 1962–1963), &quot;Sorrow on the Rocks&quot; (No. 5, 1964), &quot;Green, Green Grass of Home&quot; (No. 4, 1965), &quot;Skid Row Joe&quot; (No. 3, 1965–1966), &quot;The Cold Hard Facts of Life&quot; (No. 2, 1967), and &quot;The Carroll County Accident&quot; (No. 2, 1968–1969).

Among his hit duets with Dolly Parton were a remake of Tom Paxton&#x27;s &quot;The Last Thing on My Mind&quot; (1967), &quot;We&#x27;ll Get Ahead Someday&quot; (1968), &quot;Just Someone I Used to Know&quot; (1969), &quot;Daddy Was An Old Time Preacher Man&quot; (1970), &quot;Better Move it on Home&quot; (1971), &quot;The Right Combination&quot; (1972), &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Stop Loving Me&quot; (No. 1, 1974) and &quot;Making Plans&quot; (No. 2, 1980). He also won three Grammy Awards for gospel recordings.

=== Television series ===
His syndicated television program, &quot;The Porter Wagoner Show&quot;, aired from 1960 to 1981. There were 686 30-minute episodes taped, the first 104 (1960–66) in black-and-white and the remainder (1966–81) in color. At its peak, his show was featured in over 100 markets, with an average viewership of over three million. Reruns of the program air on the rural cable network RFD-TV and its sister channel in the UK Rural TV.The shows usually featured opening performances by Wagoner with performances by Norma Jean, or later Dolly Parton, and comedic interludes by Speck Rhodes. During Parton&#x27;s tenure, she and Wagoner usually sang a duet. Each episode also featured a guest who would usually perform one or two songs. A spiritual or gospel performance was almost always featured toward the end of the show, generally performed by either Wagoner or Parton or the show&#x27;s guest star, or occasionally the entire cast. After Parton left the show, Porter began taping the show at Opryland USA in various locations around the park.

The shows had a friendly, informal feel, with Wagoner trading jokes with band members (frequently during songs) and exchanging banter with Dolly Parton and Don Howser. In 1974, Dolly Parton&#x27;s song &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, written about her professional break from Wagoner, went to number one on the country music chart.

Wagoner&#x27;s stage alter ego was Skid Row Joe. The cast included:

* Singer Norma Jean (1960–1965)
* Singer Jeannie Seely (1965–1966)
* Singer Dolly Parton (1967–1974)
* Singer Barbara Lea (1974–1976)
* Singer Linda Carol Moore (1976–1978)

* Announcer Don Howser

=== Later work ===

Wagoner brought James Brown to the Grand Ole Opry, produced a rhythm &amp; blues album for Joe Simon, and appeared in the Clint Eastwood film &quot;Honkytonk Man&quot;. During the mid 1980s, Wagoner formed an all-girl group, The Right Combination, named after one of his hit records with Parton, and toured with them for several years. He also hosted &quot;Opry Backstage&quot; during the 1990s on The Nashville Network. Though Parton&#x27;s departure was difficult for both, the two reconciled in the late 1980s and appeared together a number of times in the following years. Parton inducted Wagoner into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2002.

Wagoner made a guest appearance on the HBO comedy series &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; in 2004, its second season, interviewed by Borat Sagdiyev.

Wagoner was honored on August 12, 2007, his 80th birthday, at the Grand Ole Opry for his 50 years of membership. It was telecast on GAC&#x27;s &quot;Grand Ole Opry Live&quot; that day with artists including Parton, Marty Stuart and Patty Loveless. &quot;Grand Ole Opry Live&quot; host Nan Kelley was part of the birthday celebration.

On June 5, 2007, Wagoner released his final album, called &quot;Wagonmaster&quot;. Produced by Stuart for the Anti- label, the album received the best reviews of Wagoner&#x27;s career and briefly appeared on the country chart. A music video was also produced of one of the tracks, a cover of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Committed to Parkview&quot;. He toured during the summer of 2007 to promote the album, including a late-July appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. One of these performances was to open for the rock group The White Stripes at a sold-out concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

==Personal life==
Wagoner was married twice, to Velma Johnson for less than a year in 1943 and to Ruth Olive Williams from 1946 to 1986, though they separated 20 years before the divorce. He fathered three children, Richard, Denise, and Debra.

Wagoner died from lung cancer in Nashville on October 28, 2007, with his family and Dolly Parton at his side. Wagoner&#x27;s funeral was held November 1, 2007, at the Grand Ole Opry House. He is buried at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Nashville.

==Legacy==
Dolly Parton performed a concert at her theme park Dollywood in Wagoner&#x27;s memory after his death.

Porter Wagoner Boulevard, a road in his native West Plains, Missouri, is named in his honor.

In 2013, the television show &quot;Drunk History&quot; presented a brief summary of Wagoner&#x27;s relationship with Parton.

Dan Cooper at AllMusic noted, &quot;As for his music, after signing with RCA in 1952 he produced a wealth of superb hard country, and just as much of the most wretchedly oversentimentalized tripe you&#x27;ll ever want to hear. The latter, of course, is half the reason he&#x27;s loved&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Spinax&quot; (SS/SSR-489), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy named after the spinax, one of the spiny sharks (dogfish sharks) scientifically known as &quot;Squalidal&quot;. Her keel was laid down on 14 May 1945 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 25 November 1945 sponsored by Mrs. Tom C. Clark, and commissioned on 20 September 1946.

==1940s==

&quot;Spinax&quot; moved to New London, Connecticut, on 15 November and was assigned to Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet. On 15 December 1946, she sailed for the Caribbean Sea to begin her shakedown cruise which lasted until 28 January 1947. She returned to New London and participated in local operations until November when a fleet exercise took her north of the Arctic Circle near Labrador. In January 1948, designated a radar picket submarine, her hull classification symbol was changed from SS to SSR. After conducting operations in the Caribbean during the first part of the year, she returned to her home yard, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, in May for an overhaul which lasted until the end of October. In addition to the installation of much radar and communication equipment, the work included the removal of her aft torpedo tubes, demilitarization of two forward tubes, installation of a snorkel system, and conversion of the after room into a combat information center. When she emerged from the yard, &quot;Spinax&quot; possessed the capabilities of a radar picket destroyer.

&quot;Spinax&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea from 3 January to 3 March 1949, as the first postwar submarine unit of the Sixth Fleet. Upon her return to New London, she was assigned to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 6 based at Norfolk, Virginia—the first time since World War I that submarines had been scheduled to operate from that base. She conducted operations along the east coast until again being deployed to the Sixth Fleet from 6 January to 23 May 1950. She returned to Norfolk until 12 June when she was transferred to the West Coast.

==1950s==

The submarine arrived at San Diego, California, on 29 June and proceeded up the coast to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for an overhaul. She made a cruise to Pearl Harbor from 17 August to 16 October 1951 and returned to San Diego. She became a unit of Submarine Division 53 on 1 January 1952 and resumed her routine duties. &quot;Spinax&quot; was overhauled at Mare Island from April through early August and returned to San Diego on 7 August 1952.

&quot;Spinax&quot; operated out of that port until 1 November 1954 when she sailed for an extended tour in the Far East. The submarine operated with the Seventh Fleet and then visited the Philippines, Hong Kong, Formosa, and Japan before returning to San Diego on 7 May 1955. Overhaul at Mare Island from June through October 1956 was followed by refresher training in the San Diego area. She was deployed to the western Pacific from 4 January to 1 July 1957 and again from 3 July to 16 December 1958.

Emphasis in antisubmarine warfare resulted in &quot;Spinax&quot;’s being converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine. This was accomplished at Mare Island from 13 April to 11 September 1959. All radar except search and fire control were removed, the communication facility was reduced to that of a regular submarine; and the combat information center was converted into living quarters. The ship received improved sonar and fire control equipment, and modifications were made to her hull. On 15 August, she resumed the hull classification symbol SS-489. When the conversion was completed, the submarine conducted refresher training and local operations until early 1960.

A brief shot of the ship was used in the 1953 sci-fi movie &quot;Phantom from Space&quot; where she is seen on radar picket duty.

==1960s and fate==

&quot;Spinax&quot; departed San Diego on 3 May 1960 for a tour in the western Pacific with the Seventh Fleet which lasted until 3 November when she returned to her home port. Thereafter, except for four deployments in the Far East, her west coast operations were interrupted only by yard overhauls. &quot;Spinax&quot; was deployed from 27 June to 17 December 1962; from 18 August 1965 to 15 March 1966; from 6 January to 25 June 1967; and from February to 13 August 1969 when she last returned to Mare Island.

In September 1969, &quot;Spinax&quot; was declared unfit for further service. She was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 October 1969. Her hulk was sold to Zidell Explorations, Incorporated, on 13 June 1972 and scrapped.

<text>Joseph Smith–History (abbreviated JS–H) is a book in the Pearl of Great Price containing excerpts from an autobiographical record of some of the early events in the life of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Like many of Smith&#x27;s publications, it was dictated to scribes.

The recording of Joseph Smith–History began in 1838 in Far West, Missouri. Scribes included James Mulholland, Robert B. Thompson, W. W. Phelps, and Willard Richards. Other early leaders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, such as Brigham Young, George A. Smith, and Eliza R. Snow, contributed in different ways to the development of the record. It was first published piece by piece in the Latter Day Saint periodicals &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;, &quot;Deseret News&quot;, and the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;. The serial history would later be edited by B.H. Roberts and published between 1902 and 1912 as a 2,000-page history entitled &quot;History of the Church&quot;. 

The Joseph Smith–History was published in 1851 by Franklin D. Richards as selected excerpts from the beginning of the &quot;History of the Church&quot; as part of his collection, the Pearl of Great Price. This collection became part of the scriptural canon of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) on October 10, 1880, during the 50th semiannual general conference of the church.

Joseph Smith–History spans 12 pages in the Pearl of Great Price and tells of 14-year-old Joseph Smith&#x27;s experiences with religious contention and his First Vision, and, later, the visitation of the angel Moroni to him, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, and the restoration of the Aaronic priesthood. Through these accounts it touches on religious ideas such as baptism, prophets, and the nature of God. It has been used as a proselyting tool by Mormon missionaries; today, they are encouraged to memorize and recite Joseph Smith&#x27;s account of the First Vision.

== History ==
When the Church of Christ was organized on April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith received a revelation from God (now known as Doctrine and Covenants 21:1), commanding the Latter Day Saints to record their history. Smith attempted to record a history seven times before work on what is now Joseph Smith–History began; each of these attempts was unsuccessful, being either left incomplete or deemed unsatisfactory by Smith. He told W. W. Phelps, &quot;There are but few subjects that I have felt a greater anxiety about than my history&quot;. The account found in Joseph Smith–History is the product of the 1838 attempt undertaken by Smith and other early Latter Day Saint leaders to record the history of the church. Smith&#x27;s motivation for creating this history was twofold: to adhere to God&#x27;s direction to record his experiences, and to respond to critics of his story. The paranoia that led up to the 1838 Mormon War may have had an effect on the opening passage of Joseph Smith–History, when Smith states: &quot;Owing to the many reports which have been put in circulation ... I have been induced to write this history, to disabuse the public mind.&quot;

Work on the history began in Far West, Missouri on September 3, 1838. Because he had never received formal education, Smith mostly dictated his history verbally to scribes instead of writing it himself. The passages the scribes recorded were later rewritten in the first person, so as to be from Smith&#x27;s point of view. The first scribe to work on the history was James Mulholland. Smith drew on material from his incomplete history (begun in 1838) while dictating to Mulholland. After scribing 59 pages, Mulholland abruptly died on November 3, 1839, halting the project for a time until Robert B. Thompson picked it up again. However, Thompson was only able to scribe 16 pages due to his untimely death on August 27, 1841. William W. Phelps then became Smith&#x27;s scribe. Progress on the record was slow due to the task of building up the city of Nauvoo.It wasn&#x27;t until December 1842, when Willard Richards—Smith&#x27;s personal secretary and editor of the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;—became scribe that a substantial amount of the history was recorded. In 1844, Richards wrote: &quot;It is now seven years since I have laid my head one night in my own house during that time I have been in England, near four years and the remainder of the time have spent in writing the History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which, of course will afford no income until it is completed and printed which cannot possibly be done for one or two years. It is a great work and all important to the Church and the world.&quot; The history was one of Smith&#x27;s main priorities in Nauvoo. Richards and Phelps remembered that he once asked the schoolmaster of a nearby class to change locations because noise from the students was distracting those tasked with compiling the record. Smith instructed them to be thorough, pulling information from sources such as newspapers and the records of city council meetings and other organization proceedings.
While in Carthage Jail, Smith expressed to Richards his wish that work on the history continue. Richards kept his promise, spearheading the production of the history for the next decade. After Smith&#x27;s death, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles also took over responsibility for the history. Brigham Young began his task of reviewing and revising the record in April 1845. The people involved in the project were able to follow the pattern and style Smith had laid out. As the Mormons were preparing to leave Nauvoo, they were encouraged to gather together any documents that would prove useful to the history. By the time they exited the city, the history included Smith&#x27;s story up until March 1, 1843. Henry Fairbanks and Thomas Bullock transported the manuscript across the Great Plains. Bullock brought them into the Salt Lake Valley under the direction of Willard Richards. No significant progress was made on the history thereafter until George A. Smith became church historian. He oversaw the addition of 844 pages, ending with a record of August 8, 1844. He drew on various sources, such as transcriptions of Joseph Smith&#x27;s sermons and sketches of his life previously written by record keepers such as Smith&#x27;s scribes and Eliza R. Snow. Many of these records George A. Smith inspected had been damaged over time. Wilford Woodruff also worked on the project in his capacity as assistant church historian; he helped gather the testimonies of those who had known Joseph Smith, many of which contradicted each other. The history was completed in August 1856 after a total of 17 years of work. The account eventually expanded into the multi-volume &quot;History of the Church&quot; (also known as &quot;Documentary History of the Church&quot;), edited by B. H. Roberts and published in its current format in 1902. It was 2,000 pages long in its entirety.

=== Early publication ===
The history was published serially in the newspaper &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; from March 15, 1842 until February 15, 1846. It was first featured in volume 3, issue 10 of the paper. The portion scribed by Mulholland was what was featured in the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;. This selection was later printed into a pamphlet, called &quot;Joseph Smith&#x27;s Own Story,&quot; to be used for proselyting purposes. It was also published in the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;, the Latter Day Saint publication in England. After the Mormon pioneers arrived in Utah Territory, the record was printed in the &quot;Deseret News&quot; beginning on November 15, 1851.

=== Extraction and canonization ===

Franklin D. Richards, Willard Richards&#x27;s nephew and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, extracted excerpts from the &quot;History of the Church&quot; and published them in 1851, hoping that the selection would &quot;increase the members&#x27; ability to defend the faith.&quot; In the years leading up to the canonization of Joseph Smith–History, Brigham Young and other leaders of the church had expressed growing concern over members&#x27; lack of understanding of church history, particularly among the younger generations. Richards focused on extracting the main events of the text, excluding revelations given to Smith in God&#x27;s words. He emphasized that this passage&#x27;s intended audience was existing members of the church, not newcomers to the faith. Church leader Orson Pratt recognized the value of Smith&#x27;s history and played a pivotal role in its becoming important in the eyes of church members. He also recognized its potential as a proselyting tool; the mid to late 1800s saw a boom in the usage of Smith&#x27;s account by missionaries. When Franklin Richards compiled the Pearl of Great Price, he chose to include the passage he had extracted from the &quot;History of the Church.&quot; The excerpts had been pulled from the earliest section of the history: the 59 pages scribed by James Mulholland.

Joseph Smith–History subsequently became part of the official standard works of the LDS Church on October 10, 1880, when the Pearl of Great Price was canonized during the 50th semiannual general conference. The motion was brought forth by George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith. John Taylor was appointed president of the church at that same general conference. After the proceedings, the manuscript was sent to James E. Talmage, then a professor at the University of Utah, for some minor editing: mainly, adding footnotes and organizing the passages into chapters and verses. Talmage&#x27;s edited version was accepted in 1902 and published as the first edition of the Pearl of Great Price. Joseph Smith–History remained relatively untouched throughout the canonization process. It spans 12 pages in the Pearl of Great Price.

== Content ==
The events recounted in Joseph Smith–History begin with a succinct record of Joseph Smith&#x27;s genealogy and birth. They then proceed to a description of the confusion Smith felt at the age of fourteen pertaining to the various Christian sects that had grown to prominence around him. He mentions by name the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches as being in opposition to each other. These opening verses display Smith&#x27;s personal search for knowledge and his becoming convinced that an answer from God directly was required in order to know which church to join. Smith then describes turning to the Bible for answers and discovering the invitation to &quot;ask of God&quot; in James 1:5. Verses 5 through 20 then comprise one of the four accounts of Joseph Smith&#x27;s First Vision, in which he testifies of having seen God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ:&quot;...I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—&#x27;&quot;This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!&#x27;&quot;&quot;

— Joseph Smith—History, verses 16-17These verses in Joseph Smith–History are the only official, canonized version of the First Vision. According to the account, God and Christ instructed Smith not to join any of the churches. Following the First Vision, Smith describes the prejudice and persecution he faced from religious leaders and others in his community. He then tells about the visitation of the angel Moroni and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.

The remainder of the account includes details about Joseph Smith&#x27;s marriage to his wife, Emma Hale, his experience receiving the ancient Book of Mormon record and beginning translation, and Professor Charles Anthon authenticating the characters found on the golden plates. It also includes his interactions with two major participants in the translation process, Martin Harris and Oliver Cowdery. The passage concludes with the restoration of the Aaronic priesthood by John the Baptist to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in verses 68 and 69. The timeline of the events described in Joseph Smith–History ends in May 1829.

While the body of the text is written from Joseph Smith&#x27;s perspective, the current edition of Joseph Smith—History includes a footnote with a description from Joseph&#x27;s scribe, Oliver Cowdery, taken from &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot;. Here, Cowdery records some of his thoughts about being involved in the translation process of the Book of Mormon.

== Religious significance ==
Since its canonization, Joseph Smith–History has become &quot;a foundational piece of literature for the [LDS] Church.&quot; It inspired a tradition of record keeping in Mormon culture and the church itself. Besides the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith–History is a &quot;major literary tool of conversion... that has thoroughly benefitted missionary efforts worldwide.&quot; Today, &quot;Preach My Gospel&quot;, the training manual for Mormon missionaries, encourages its readers to be prepared to quote Smith&#x27;s description of the First Vision verbatim as it appears in Joseph Smith–History. Select verses from the passage are also used by missionaries to teach others about the need for the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the need for a prophet. Other doctrines found in Joseph Smith–History include baptism, the priesthood, prayer, the appearances of angels, and the Godhead. The account of the First Vision—in which Smith sees both God the Father and Jesus Christ simultaneously—challenges the doctrine of the trinity. Additionally, the part describing Moroni&#x27;s appearance to the young Joseph Smith alludes to a prophecy contained in Isaiah 29. The events described in Joseph Smith–History also refute the belief that God no longer communicates with beings on earth. Milton R. Hunter, a member of the LDS Church&#x27;s Council of the Seventy, wrote that &quot;in many respects it [the Pearl of Great Price] holds an unique position and in all respects it supplements and sustains the other standard works of the Church of Jesus Christ.&quot;

<text>Casa Grande Ruins National Monument ( or &quot;Sivan Vahki&quot;), in Coolidge, Arizona, located northeast of Casa Grande, Arizona, preserves a group of Hohokam structures dating to the Classic Period ().

==History of the area==
The national monument consists of the ruins of multiple structures surrounded by a compound wall constructed by the ancient people of the Hohokam period, who farmed the Gila Valley in the early 13th century. &quot;Archeologists have discovered evidence that the ancient Sonoran Desert people who built the Casa Grande also developed wide-scale irrigation farming and extensive trade connections which lasted over a thousand years until about .

&quot;Casa Grande&quot; is Spanish for &quot;big house&quot; (&quot;Siwañ Wa&#x27;a Ki:&quot; in O&#x27;odham); these names refer to the largest structure on the site, which is what remains of a four-story structure that may have been abandoned by 1450. The structure is made of caliche, and has managed to survive the extreme weather conditions for about seven centuries. The large house consists of outer rooms surrounding an inner structure. The outer rooms are all three stories high, while the inner structure is four stories high. The structures were constructed using traditional adobe processes. The wet adobe is thicker at the base and adds significant strength. Noticeable horizontal cracks define the breaks between courses on the thick outer walls. The process consisted of using damp adobe to form the walls and then waiting for it to dry, and then building it up with more adobe. Casa Grande contained a ball court much like that found at Pueblo Grande de Nevada. Father Eusebio Kino was the first European to view the Hohokam complex in November 1694 and named it Casa Grande. Graffiti from 19th-century passers-by is scratched into its walls; though this is now illegal. Casa Grande now has a distinctive modern roof covering built in 1932.

==Administrative history==
In 1891, the monument underwent repairs supervised by Cosmos Mindeleff of the Bureau of American Ethnology, until funds ran out. Proclaimed Casa Grande Reservation on June 22, 1892 by of President Benjamin Harrison, 480 acres around the ruins became the first prehistoric and cultural reserve in the United States. It was then re-designated a national monument by President Woodrow Wilson on August 3, 1918. As with all historical areas administered by the National Park Service, Casa Grande was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

==Historic adobes==
Between 1937 and 1940 the Civilian Conservation Corps built several adobe buildings to serve as housing and administrative offices for the national monument. The adobe buildings, constructed using traditional methods, continue in use today and are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Because of careful conservation, the physical appearance of Casa Grande Ruins has hardly changed since the 1940s.

==Olmsted shelter==

In 1932, a ramada to shelter the ruins from weathering was built by Boston architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. In the early 21st century, a pair of great horned owls took up residence in the rafters of the Olmsted shelter.

The current protective structure covering the &quot;Great House&quot; replaced a wooden similar structure built to protect it in 1903. Due to the fragile nature of the &quot;Great House,&quot; visitors to the site are not permitted inside. To protect its integrity, observation by visitors is only permitted outside the structure.

<text>Jerry Jeff Walker (born Ronald Clyde Crosby; March 16, 1942 – October 23, 2020) was an American country and folk singer-songwriter. He was a leading figure in the progressive country and outlaw country music movement. He also wrote the 1968 song &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;.

==Early life==
Walker was born Ronald Clyde Crosby in Oneonta, New York, on March 16, 1942. His father, Mel, worked as a sports referee and bartender; his mother, Alma (Conrow), was a housewife. His maternal grandparents played for square dances in the Oneonta area – his grandmother, Jessie Conrow, playing piano, while his grandfather played fiddle. During the late 1950s, Crosby was a member of a local Oneonta teen band called The Tones.

After high school, Crosby joined the National Guard, but his thirst for adventure led him to go AWOL and he was eventually discharged. He went on to roam the country busking for a living in New Orleans and throughout Texas, Florida, and New York, often accompanied by H. R. Stoneback (a friendship referenced in 1970&#x27;s &quot;Stoney&quot;). He first played under the stage name of Jerry Ferris, then Jeff Walker, before amalgamating them into Jerry Jeff Walker and legally changing his name to that in the late 1960s.

==Career==
Walker spent his early folk music days in Greenwich Village in the mid-1960s. He co-founded a band with Bob Bruno in the late-1960s called Circus Maximus that put out two albums, one with the popular FM radio hit &quot;Wind&quot;, but Bruno&#x27;s interest in jazz apparently diverged from Walker&#x27;s interest in folk music. Walker thus resumed his solo career and recorded the seminal 1968 album &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot; with the help of David Bromberg and other influential Atlantic recording artists. He settled in Austin, Texas, in the 1970s, associating mainly with the outlaw country scene that included artists such as Michael Martin Murphey, Willie Nelson, Guy Clark, Waylon Jennings, and Townes Van Zandt. &quot;Jerry Jeff&#x27;s train songs&quot; were cited in the lyrics of Jennings and Nelson&#x27;s 1977 hit song &quot;Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)&quot;. On September 28, 1974, Walker appeared with Doug Sahm at Carnegie Hall&#x27;s Main Hall.

A string of records for MCA and Elektra followed Walker&#x27;s move to Austin, Texas, before he gave up on the mainstream music business and formed his own independent record label. Tried &amp; True Music was founded in 1986, with his wife Susan as president and manager. Susan also founded Goodknight Music as his management company and Tried &amp; True Artists for his bookings. A series of increasingly autobiographical records followed under the Tried &amp; True imprint, which also sells his autobiography, &quot;Gypsy Songman&quot;. In 2004, Walker released his first DVD of songs from his past performed in an intimate setting in Austin.

Walker married Susan Streit in 1974 in Travis County, Texas. They had two children: a son, Django Walker, who is also a musician, and a daughter Jessie Jane. Walker had a retreat on Ambergris Caye in Belize, where he recorded his &quot;Cowboy Boots and Bathing Suits&quot; album in 1998. He also made a guest appearance on Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott&#x27;s 1998 album of duets &quot;Friends of Mine&quot;, singing &quot;He Was a Friend of Mine&quot; and Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Hard Travelin&#x27;&quot;.

Walker recorded songs written by others such as &quot;LA Freeway&quot; (Guy Clark), &quot;Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother&quot; (Ray Wylie Hubbard), &quot;(Looking for) The Heart of Saturday Night&quot; (Tom Waits), and &quot;London Homesick Blues&quot; (Gary P. Nunn). He also interpreted the songs of others such as Rodney Crowell, Townes Van Zandt, Paul Siebel, Bob Dylan, Todd Snider, Dave Roberts, and even a rodeo clown named Billy Jim Baker. Walker was given the moniker of &quot;the Jimmy Buffett of Texas&quot;. It was Walker who first drove Jimmy Buffett to Key West (from Coconut Grove, Florida in a Packard). The two musicians also co-wrote the song &quot;Railroad Lady&quot; while riding the last run of the &quot;Panama Limited&quot;.

===&quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;===
Walker&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot; (1968) is perhaps his best-known and most-often performed song. It is about an obscure alcoholic but talented tap-dancing drifter Walker had met who, when arrested and jailed in New Orleans, insisted on being identified only as &quot;Bojangles&quot;.

Notable recordings of the song include a live version by his bandmate Bromberg on his album &quot;Demon in Disguise&quot;, a single by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band that charted at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1971 (also released on their album &quot;Uncle Charlie &amp; His Dog Teddy&quot;). and its inclusion in medley on the 1974 debut self-titled album by Jim Stafford.

==Later years and death==
Walker had an annual birthday celebration in Austin at the Paramount Theatre and at Gruene Hall in Gruene, Texas. The party brought some of the biggest names in country music out for a night of picking and swapping stories.

He died from throat cancer on October 23, 2020, at a hospital in Austin, Texas at the age of 78.

<doc id="1050896" wikidata="Q4817294" url="?curid=1050896" title="USS Thornback">
<text>USS &quot;Thornback&quot; (SS-418), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the thornback, a slender member of the shark family with a long pointed snout and a sharp spine at the end of each dorsal fin, native to northern Atlantic waters ranging from the temperate to the Arctic.

Her keel was laid down on 5 April 1944 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 7 July 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Peter K. Fischler, and commissioned on 13 October 1944 with Commander Ernest P. Abrahamson in command.

== World War II ==
On 10 November 1944 &quot;Thornback&quot; collided with USS CG-74327 (sank); one seaman was killed.

&quot;Thornback&quot; stood out of New London, Connecticut, on 20 March 1945 bound, via the Panama Canal, for the Hawaiian Islands. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 25 May and conducted training in Hawaiian waters prior to getting underway on 11 June for the western Pacific. As she stood down the Pearl Harbor channel, a formation of Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs), running down the wrong side of the channel, forced &quot;Thornback&quot; to crowd dangerously near the extreme edge of the channel. In the process, the submarine damaged her sound dome, necessitating repairs and a two-day delay in departing.

She set sail for Saipan on 13 June, but she was rerouted to Guam. En route to the Mariana Islands, &quot;Thornback&quot; conducted an average of four training dives daily, in conjunction with battle problems, drills, and emergency surfacing exercises, before she arrived at Guam on 25 June.

As lead ship of a wolf pack nicknamed &quot;Abe&#x27;s Abolishers&quot;, &quot;Thornback&quot; stood out to sea on 30 June, bound for the Japanese home islands. By this point in the war, American and British task forces steamed within easy gun range of Japanese coastal targets with near impunity. Japan&#x27;s merchant marine and Navy had dwindled in size. Allied submarines and aircraft had taken an ever-increasing toll. In the air, Japan&#x27;s once vaunted air forces had been struck from the skies. Sweeping ahead of Third Fleet Task Forces, the &quot;Abolishers&quot; made antipicket boat sweeps in the Tokyo-Yokohama area before proceeding to hunting grounds off the east coast of Honshū and south of Hokkaidō.

Rough seas, strong winds, and generally poor visibility prevailed during &quot;Thornback&quot;’s patrol. She sighted a hospital ship on 5 July and let it pass. Six days later, a minor fire in the pump room caused a temporary shutdown in the number one air conditioning plant before swift repairs enabled the ship to continue as before.

On 15 July, &quot;Thornback&quot; sighted submarine , and the two boats exchanged information on their hunting areas. They also swapped movies, precious commodities for boosting morale on board the crowded boats. Six days later, &quot;Thornback&quot; proceeded north to patrol off Erimo Seki, an area which had recently seen a series of devastating carrier raids by Admiral William F. Halsey&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force 38. The submarine&#x27;s commanding officer noted somewhat humorously, &quot;This area should be about as heavily traveled as the Sahara Desert after the working over it just had...&quot;

His assessment was correct—only straggling merchantmen and small patrol craft hugged the barren coasts. On 26 July, at 0320, &quot;Thornback&quot; submerged off Hei Saki. At 0400, the submarine&#x27;s sound gear picked up the &quot;pinging&quot; projected by a snooping Japanese escort ship, and she came to periscope depth to have a look.

Carefully maneuvering into position, &quot;Thornback&quot; fired one shot from her stern tubes at 04:29 and soon heard a small explosion which stopped the enemy&#x27;s screws. Almost immediately the submariners picked up new sounds—two more escorts, &quot;pinging&quot; and coming aggressively closer. After sizing up the new attackers, &quot;Thornback&quot; felt that they were too small to use a torpedo on—besides, a Japanese floatplane had begun circling the area. A rowboat with a few Japanese sailors amidst a pile of flotsam testified to the fact that the first ship was no longer there. Satisfied that their quarry had been sunk, the submarine cleared the area. One of the other escorts gave up the chase and picked up survivors of her sunken sister. &quot;All antisubmarine vessels have closed the beach,&quot; &quot;Thornback&quot;’s commander later recorded, &quot;and seem to be pinging away at the rocks.&quot;

Three days later, by periscope, the submarine spotted a 950-ton &quot;sea truck&quot;, similar to &quot;Sanko Maru&quot;, at , close inshore. Unescorted, the Japanese presented a tempting target for a gun attack, but, no sooner had &quot;Thornback&quot;’s periscope shears and bow broken the surface, than the target slipped into the misty weather. Not to be daunted, &quot;Thornback&quot; followed, playing a cat and mouse game, and fired five torpedoes. All missed. She later sighted the enemy again, missed with three more torpedoes, and took the &quot;sea truck&quot; under fire. Despite poor visibility, &quot;Thornback&quot; closed to and scored numerous hits with the 40 millimeter guns. The target, however, was able to move closer inshore and escaped in the fog which closed around her like a shroud.

The submarine lurked on the surface off Hokkaidō on 31 July and again tangled with some of the numerous Japanese patrol craft. She sighted a patrol boat at and closing. &quot;Thornback&quot;’s five-inch (127 mm) deck gun was trained out, but her crew could not keep their sights on the attacker through the telescopes and switched to open sights. Meanwhile, the 40 millimeter gun opened a devastating barrage at the enemy craft as it came steadily on a collision course. These shells continually hit the escort ship along the waterline and in the pilot house, probably killing the occupants on the bridge.

&quot;Thornback&quot; had passed her target once at and came about for a second pass when the forward torpedo room reported sharp noises forward. Further amplification showed that the noise was caused by enemy machine gun bullets striking the submarine&#x27;s hull. Resuming the attack, &quot;Thornback&quot; swung back into action, with visibility only and lessening. Her 40 millimeter fire continued to maul the Japanese vessel, shooting away one of her masts and leaving her limping shoreward at only . After securing from battle stations, &quot;Thornback&quot; passed through an oil slick and noted a mast from the heavily hit patrol craft.

Later on 31 July, &quot;Thornback&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; off Kesennuma and proceeded north to pick up submarine en route to a projected shore bombardment mission against Hokkaidō. The sight of the three submarines cruising on the surface moved &quot;Thornback&quot;’s commander to write: &quot;On this clear and sunny day, the three ships in perfect column on a flat sea made a beautiful picture tearing along at 18 knots.&quot;

At 14:02 on 1 August, this part of &quot;Abe&#x27;s Abolishers&quot;—&quot;Thornback&quot;, &quot;Angler&quot;, and &quot;Sea Poacher&quot;—made landfall off their target of Urakawa, Hokkaidō. They swung parallel to the beach with guns manned and ready. Twelve minutes later, slowing to 10 knots (19 km/h), &quot;Thornback&quot; and her consorts opened fire with and 40 millimeter batteries at a range of . The first few rounds from &quot;Thornback&quot;’s five-incher went wild, but the crew soon locked onto the range. Firing by hand after the foot firing plunger broke off, &quot;Thornback&quot;’s gunners eventually sent 100 rounds of five-inch (127 mm) shells shoreward, heavily damaging a factory and a power plant. &quot;The firing took 22 minutes and was of inestimable value to the entire crew,&quot; wrote the submarine&#x27;s commanding officer. &quot;The training was excellent and the boost to morale tremendous.&quot;

&quot;Thornback&quot; set sail for Midway Island after the shelling of Urakawa, and arrived at the atoll on 8 August. Seven days later, Japan—hemmed in by veritable armadas of Allied ships and planes which were able to roam almost at will and unchallenged off her coast and in her skies—surrendered.

&quot;Thornback&quot; soon returned to the United States, where she was decommissioned at New London on 6 April 1946 and was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Subsequently, brought to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, she was converted and reactivated under the Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY). On 2 October 1953, the submarine was recommissioned, Lieutenant Commander Thomas C. Jones, Jr., in command, and assigned to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 4.

Shaking down in her new configuration, the submarine performed a &quot;first&quot; for submarines on 6 November 1954, when she snorkeled in the Mississippi River at New Orleans, Louisiana, from the Industrial Canal to the foot of Canal Street. With SubRon 4, the ship was based at Key West, Florida, and visited ports in the Caribbean Sea before entering the Charleston Naval Shipyard in February 1956 for overhaul. Upon completion of this work, the submarine was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea for a tour with the Sixth Fleet before returning to Key West in March 1957. While with SubRon 4, &quot;Thornback&quot; participated in operations supporting the Operational Development Force, the Fleet Sonar School, and the Fleet Training Unit at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

On 2 June 1958, &quot;Thornback&quot; departed the Caribbean, bound for Londonderry Port, Northern Ireland, and operations with the joint Royal Navy-Royal Air Force antisubmarine school. While thus engaged, the submarine damaged her port propeller at Londonderry Port and became the first American submarine to be docked at Faslane by the Royal Navy. &quot;Thornback&quot; returned to the Sixth Fleet and her second Mediterranean deployment which lasted from 2 July to 24 September 1958.

For the remainder of the ship&#x27;s active career, she was based out of Charleston, South Carolina, conducting deployments to the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, and to the Caribbean Sea and operating in a support capacity as newer submarine types joined the Fleet.

&quot;Thornback&quot; received one battle star for her World War II service.

== TCG &quot;Uluçalireis&quot; (S 338) ==
Placed in a reduced manning status on 14 April 1971, the ship was turned over to the Turkish Navy on 1 July 1971 and renamed TCG &quot;Uluçalireis&quot; (S 338) for the Ottoman admiral Uluç Ali Reis. Decommissioned from the United States Navy on that same date, she was later struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1973. In 2000, she was decommissioned after 28 years of service in the Turkish Navy. Handed over to the Rahmi M. Koç Museum, she can be visited at her moorings in Golden Horn in Istanbul.

As of January 2024, she has been moved to the Gölcük Naval Shipyard and is undergoing renovations and maintanace. On 7 February, she was seen in Kocaeli Province alongside TCG Piri Reis the first vessel of Reis-class submarine.

<doc id="1050907" wikidata="Q17082457" url="?curid=1050907" title="Nashville International Auto Show">
<text>The Nashville International Auto Show occurs each year at the Music City Center in Nashville, Tennessee. It is part of the regular circuit of auto shows in the United States, and most major manufacturers exhibit there. Firms with assembly facilities in the Middle Tennessee area, such as Nissan and Saturn are particularly well represented. 

Groups of historic and special-interest cars sometimes appear on the premises to coincide with the main show; an exhibit of classic Mustangs was on display in 2004. In 2003, the date of the show was shifted from December to January, from the end to the beginning of the show year, in order to secure more favorable consideration from exhibitors for the introduction of new production and concept vehicles. The date has since changed several times. Currently, as of 2024, the show is held in the fall. 

The Music City Center site is located downtown, with ready access to transportation and lodging, and is connected to the neighboring Bridgestone Arena. Prior to the organization of the current show in 1999, other similar events, usually sponsored by dealer organizations, had been held for a number of years at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium. A feature of all auto shows in Tennessee, mandated by state law, is that no sales may take place on the premises, and signs to that effect must be posted.

The auto show was previously known as the &quot;Nashville International Auto and Truck Show&quot;. It was not held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="1050922" wikidata="Q859363" url="?curid=1050922" title="Sciences Po">
<text>Sciences Po () or Sciences Po Paris, also known as the Paris Institute of Political Studies (, ), is a private and public research university located in Paris, France, that holds the status of &quot;grande école&quot; and the legal status of . The university&#x27;s undergraduate program is taught on the Paris campus as well as on the decentralized campuses in Dijon, Le Havre, Menton, Nancy, Poitiers and Reims, each with their own academic program focused on a geopolitical part of the world. While Sciences Po historically specialized in political science, it progressively expanded to other social sciences such as economics, law and sociology.

The school was established in 1872 by Émile Boutmy as the &quot;École libre des sciences politiques&quot; in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War as a private institution to form a new French elite that would be knowledgeable in political science, law and history. It was a pioneer in the emergence and development of political science as an academic field in France. Following World War II, the school was nationalized and re-established as a public institution. As of 2021, 80% of Sciences Po graduates are employed in the private sector.

Sciences Po Paris is the only Institute of Political Sciences in France allowed to refer to itself with the epithet &quot;Sciences Po&quot; without indicating the name of the city where their headquarters are located, under a legal agreement with the other institutes. They are allowed to use the term &quot;Sciences Po&quot; to refer to themselves only when followed by the names of the cities where they are located, such as &quot;Sciences Po Lille&quot; or &quot;Sciences Po Grenoble&quot;.

The institute is a member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs and The European University of Social Sciences.

==History==
=== 1872 to 1945: Free School of Political Sciences ===

Sciences Po was established in December 1871 as the &quot;École libre des sciences politiques&quot; (ELSP) by a group of French intellectuals, politicians and businessmen led by Émile Boutmy, including Hippolyte Taine, Ernest Renan, Albert Sorel and Paul Leroy Beaulieu. The creation of the school was in response to widespread fears that the inadequacy of the education of the French political elite corps would diminish the country&#x27;s international stature, as France grappled with a series of crises, including its defeat in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, the demise of Napoleon III&#x27;s regime, and the upheaval and massacre resulting from the Paris Commune. The founders of the school sought to reform the training of the French political and economic elite by establishing a new &quot;breeding ground where nearly all the major, non-technical state commissioners were trained.&quot; His innovative intellectual axis was to teach contemporary history, whereas political elites had only been taught ancient humanities for centuries, which they could still learn in universities at the same time.

The &quot;École&quot; acquired a major role in France&#x27;s political system. From 1901 to 1935, 92.5% of entrants to the &quot;Grands corps de l&#x27;État&quot;, the most powerful and prestigious administrative bodies in the French Civil Service, had studied there (this figure includes people who took civil service examination preparatory classes at Sciences Po but did not earn a degree and, in general, students were taking classes there on top of earning a degree at the University of Paris, in particular the Law Faculty).

Other countries created similar schools in the following century. In 1875, the in Italy (now part of the University of Florence), at the end of the century, the &quot;École libre des sciences Politiques et Sociales&quot; in Belgium (not existing any more), the Deutsche Hochschule für Politik in Germany, the Columbia School of Political Science (now merged into the Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences), the London School of Economics in the United Kingdom, and, after WW1, for the School of Foreign Service from Georgetown University in the United States and the Geneva Graduate Institute in Switzerland.
The connection between Sciences Po and French institutions meant that the school also played a key role in the apparatus of the French colonial empires. In 1886, the university established a colonial studies program with the goal of training students to take on professions in the colonial administration in a way that &quot;propagates [...] a more scientific and international colonialism&quot;. Many professors and members of the ELSP administration, such as Paul Leroy-Beaulieu, chair in colonial affairs at ELSP, Joseph Chailley-Bert, Jules Cambon, Charles Jonnart, Auguste Louis Albéric d’Arenberg and Ernest Roume, were also closely linked to or worked directly with the colonial government. The colonial branch of ELSP closed in 1893 after a state-sponsored Colonial School was created in 1889; however positions in the administrations of French colonies and protectorates continued to accept graduates from the ELSP.

=== 1945: Refoundation ===
Sciences Po underwent significant reforms in the aftermath of World War II in 1945. At France&#x27;s liberation from Nazi occupation, the public servants were accused of collaborating with the Vichy regime and Nazi Germany Communist politicians including Georges Cogniot accused the school to be the &quot;home of collaboration&quot; with Nazi Germany and proposed abolishing the ELSP entirely and founding a new state-run administration college on its premises. The school, however, had also trained eight out of the thirteen ministers of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, and several prominent members of the French Resistance. In order for the school not to be replaced, the director Roger Seydoux, his aid Jacques Chapsal and the school&#x27;s most famous professor, André Siegfried, excluded those among the school&#x27;s staff who were most compromised with the Vichy regime and Nazi Germany, and defended the school against accusation of collaboration and built up a communication campaign to save the school.

The choice regarding the future of the school would be made by France&#x27;s Provisional Government, under Charles de Gaulle. The alumni Michel Debré, Jules Jeanneney and Roger Grégoire decided that the school would be preserved but transformed in a new structure. Two separate legal entities were created: the &quot;Institut d&#x27;études politiques&quot; (English: Institute of political studies) and the &quot;Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques&quot; () or FNSP. Both were tasked by the French government to ensure &quot;the progress and the spread, both within and outside France, of political science, economics, and sociology&quot;. The FNSP, a private foundation, manages the &quot;IEP de Paris&quot;, owns its buildings and libraries, and determines its budget. The two entities work together in lockstep, however, as the director of the school is, by tradition, also the administrator of FNSP. This institutional arrangement gives Sciences Po a unique status, as the school draws most of its resources through substantial government subsidies to FNSP, but does not subject it to many government interventions and regulations, giving it a much higher level of autonomy compared to other French universities and schools. The epithet &quot;Sciences Po&quot; is applied to both entities, which inherited the reputation previously vested in &quot;ELSP&quot;.

The public-private nature of Sciences Po, Paris, also distinguishes it from a network of institutes of political studies throughout the country that were inspired by its curriculum, namely in Strasbourg, Lyon, Aix, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Toulouse, Rennes and Lille. They are not to be confused with the seven campuses of Sciences Po in France.

The government also established in 1945 the École Nationale d&#x27;Administration (ENA), an elite postgraduate school for training government officials. From then on, the Grands Corps de l&#x27;Etat were obliged to recruit new entrants from ENA. Sciences Po became the school of choice for those hoping to enter the ENA, and so retained its dominant place in educating high-ranking officials.

=== 1945 to 1996: The Chapsal-Gentot-Lancelot era ===
From 1947 to 1979, Sciences Po is directed by Jacques Chapsal, who replaced his mentor Roger Seydoux and led the school through the Trente Glorieuses expansion as well as the May 68 crisis. Under Chapsal, Sciences Po expands geographically. After the acquisition of the &quot;Hôtel de La Meilleraye&quot; (56–58, rue des Saints-Pères), just across Sciences Po&#x27;s lawn, the school bought the &quot;hôtel de La Bretesche&quot; at number 30, rue Saint-Guillaume, just in front of the main building. In 1976, the &quot;Presses de Sciences Po&quot; (Sciences Po&#x27;s publishing company) is created.

In 1956, Sciences Po created its first PhD program. The CEVIPOF, Center for Political Research, is created in 1960.

Between 1952 and 1969, 77.5% of the ENA&#x27;s graduate student intake were Sciences Po alumni.

&quot;FNSP&quot; received a significant donations from the Rockefeller Foundation. &quot;FNSP&quot; published periodicals such as &quot;la Revue française de science politique&quot;, &quot;le Bulletin analytique de documentation&quot;, &quot;la Chronologie politique africaine&quot;, and the &quot;Cahiers de la Fondation&quot; as well as its seven research centres and main publishing house, &quot;Presses de Sciences Po&quot;.

=== 1996 to 2012: The Descoings era ===

Political science professor Alain Lancelot led the school between 1987 and 1997. He prepared for the school&#x27;s vice-director, Richard Descoings, to become the director of Sciences Po. Under the directorship of Descoings, the school incorporated courses in various branches of the social sciences on top of political science, such as law, economics, history, and sociology. In addition, the school began requiring all its undergraduate students to spend a year abroad, and introduced a multilingual curriculum in French, English, and other languages. Sciences Po also began to expand outside Paris, establishing regional campuses throughout France.

During this period, Sciences Po also implemented reforms in its admissions process. Previously, Sciences Po recruited its students exclusively on the basis of a competitive examination. This system was seen to favor students from prestigious high schools. In 2001, Sciences Po founded the Equal Opportunity Program, widening its admissions policy. This program enables the institution to recruit high-potential students at partner high schools in more disadvantaged parts of France who, due to a social, academic, and financial constraints, would not otherwise have been able to attend Sciences Po. As a consequence, from 2001 to 2011, the proportion of scholarship students at Sciences Po went from 6 to 27 percent with around 30% of all students at Sciences Po currently receiving some form of scholarship.

The reforms Descoings spearheaded were at times controversial and his leadership style came under heavy criticism. A further report by the French Court of Audit in 2012 severely criticized the financial management of the bonuses and salaries under Descoings.

=== 2013 to 2024: The Mion-Vicherat directorate ===
After the sudden death of Richard Descoing, Frédéric Mion, was appointed director of Sciences Po on 1 March 2013. Mion&#x27;s intention to pursue Sciences Po&#x27;s development as a &quot;selective university of international standing&quot; is detailed in the policy paper &quot;Sciences Po 2022&quot;, published in the spring of 2014. He restructured the graduate studies by creating graduate schools, leading to the creation of the School of Public Affairs and the Urban School in 2015 and the School of Management and Innovation in 2016.

In early 2016, Sciences Po updated its governance structure, adopting new statutes for its two constituent bodies: the &quot;Fondation nationale des sciences politiques&quot; (FNSP) and the &quot;Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris&quot; (IEP).

In late 2016, Sciences Po acquired a new site, the Hôtel de l&#x27;Artillerie in the 7th arrondissement of Paris to expand its campus.

In 2021, Sciences Po was hit by the Duhamel scandal, mainly put forward by the best-seller book &quot;La Familia Grande&quot; and newspaper articles from &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Nouvel Obs&quot;, a sexual violence scandal one and a succession crisis. Olivier Duhamel, director of the National Foundation of Sciences Po, who was accused of raping his son, resigned. Frédéric Mion and other members of the board of these institutions resigned.

On 22 November 2021 Mathias Vicherat assumed office as the new director of Sciences Po. He resigned on March 13, 2024, after being ordered to stand trial on charges of domestic abuse. On March 26, Jean Bassères was named interim director.

In April 2024, Sciences Po became one of the epicenters of French student protests against the Israel–Hamas war.

==Campuses==
Sciences Po has seven campuses in France, with each specialising in different regions of the globe. Every May, at the end of the academic year, all seven campuses come together for the inter-campus &quot;Collégiades&quot; &quot;de Sciences Po&quot; tournament, also known as the MiniCrit. At the tournament, students represent each campus and compete against one another in arts and athletic competitions. Different events include athletic games such as volleyball and football, as well as artistic competitions such as music and dance.

===Paris===
The Paris campus is spread across several buildings concentrated around the Boulevard Saint-Germain in the 6th and 7th &quot;arrondissements&quot;. The historic centre of Sciences Po at 27 rue Saint-Guillaume houses the head office, classrooms and the central library since 1879; it is located in a hôtel particulier called &quot;Hôtel de Mortemart&quot;. It is also home to Sciences Po&#x27;s two largest teaching halls, the Amphitheatres Émile Boutmy and Jacques Chapsal. Other buildings include:

* 117, boulevard Saint-Germain: School of Journalism
* 199, boulevard Saint-Germain: Doctoral School
* 174 and 224, boulevard Saint-Germain: offices and classrooms
* 13, rue de l&#x27;Université / The René Rémond building: Law School and administrative offices
* 8, rue Jean-Sébastien-Bach: Urban School
* 28, rue des Saints-Pères: Paris School of International Affairs (PSIA)
* 56, rue des Saints-Pères: Language Lab, audiovisual service and a cartography workshop.
* 56, rue Jacob: Research Center for History (&quot;Centre d&#x27;histoire de Sciences Po&quot;) and International Relations (&quot;Centre d&#x27;études et de recherches internationales&quot;)

The Paris campus enrolls about 3,000 undergraduate students, almost a third of whom are international exchange students.

Sciences Po purchased in 2016 the &quot;Hôtel de l’Artillerie&quot;, a 17th-century former monastery of 14,000 m2 located 200 meters from its campus on rue Saint-Guillaume, from the French Ministry of Defense and refurbished the building for a total cost of around 200 million euros. The new facility which opened in 2022, hosts 7 graduate schools including School of Public Affairs, Paris School of International Affairs, Law School, Urban School, School of Management and Impact, Journalism School and the School of Research. It is home to the scientific department and the institute of innovation as well as the Sciences Po&#x27;s Center for Entrepreneurship. It will provide social housing for 50 to 100 students with need-based aid from the State.

=== Dijon ===
Located in the region of Burgundy in a 19th-century building, the Dijon campus was created in 2001. The regional specialisation is on the European Union, specifically Central and Eastern Europe, and is taught in French. The elective languages offered are Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Russian and Czech.

=== Le Havre ===
Located on the coast of Normandy, Le Havre has hosted the undergraduate Euro-Asian Programme (taught in English) since 2007. The elective languages offered are Chinese, Japanese and Korean, and French as a Foreign Language courses for students without a B1-equivalent level. Students primarily choose to spend their third year abroad in an Asian country.

=== Menton ===
Established in the French Riviera city of Menton in 2005, the campus is located in an entirely renovated 19th-century building overlooking the Mediterranean. According to the Sciences Po brochure, the Menton Campus&#x27; regional specialisation is on the Middle Eastern and the Mediterranean, and it welcomes 300 students each year. The undergraduate programme is taught through two language tracks (French or English) and several elective languages are offered: Arabic, Turkish, Italian, Spanish, Persian, Hebrew, and French as a Foreign Language for those without a CEFR B1-equivalent level in French. The third mandatory year abroad is spent in the Middle East or elsewhere.

=== Nancy ===
Established in the region of Lorraine in 2000, the Nancy campus is located in an 18th-century heritage site, the Hôtel des Missions Royales. The curriculum is taught in French, English and German, as its regional specialisation focuses on the European Union and French-German relations. The elective languages offered are German, English, French as a foreign language and also Italian, Spanish, Russian, Swedish or Arabic.

=== Poitiers ===

Opened in 2010, the campus is located in the heart of the historic city of Poitiers in the Hôtel Chaboureau, a renovated building dating from the 15th century. The regional specialisation is on Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula. The undergraduate programme is conducted mainly in French, with some courses in English and Spanish. The elective languages offered are Spanish and Portuguese.

=== Reims ===
The Reims campus opened in September 2010. It is housed in the 17th century &quot;College des Jesuits&quot;. Despite being the most recent campus, it is the largest of the regional campuses of Sciences Po, with over 1,600 undergraduates. Over half of their students are international. The campus offers two regional specialisations, one on North America (taught in English) and the other on Africa (taught in French). Additionally, through a partnership with the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne (URCA), the Reims Campus offers a dual degree in social sciences &amp; humanities and life sciences entitled &quot;Environment, Society, Sustainability.&quot; The elective languages offered are English, Spanish, German, Italian or Arabic, and French as a foreign language for students who do not have a B1 level of French.

== Organisation ==

=== Governance ===
Sciences Po operates under a dual governance model composed of two entities: the &quot;Fondation nationale des sciences politiques&quot; (FNSP), a private non-profit foundation, and the &quot;Institut d’études politiques de Paris&quot; or Paris Institute of Political Studies, a public higher education institution. These two bodies constitute Sciences Po, which is the official term used to designate them collectively.

The FNSP is responsible for the strategic direction and administrative and financial management of Sciences Po. It is administered by a board of directors.

The role of the Paris Institute of Political Studies is to ensure teaching, research and library services, like all international research universities. Its governing bodies consist of the Board of Directors, the Student Life and Education Committee and the Academic Board.

The executive committee is the institution&#x27;s operational steering committee. It brings together the directors of Sciences Po&#x27;s various divisions and offices under the authority of the President of Sciences Po. The executive committee implements the strategic direction and makes operational decisions on running and managing the institution.

=== Finances ===
Sciences Po&#x27;s own resources have grown significantly. They have been multiplied by six: from €18.3 million in 2000 to €127.2 million in 2018. These resources now account for a majority of the budget.

The school&#x27;s development under Richard Descoings led it to contract a €68 million debt by 2010. The institution took on a debt of €191 million in 2016 in order to fund the acquisition of its new Paris campus and undertake the restoration of the site. This debt is partially guaranteed by the Paris City Council.

==Education==

The academic bodies of Sciences Po consist of the Undergraduate College, six professional schools, and the Doctoral School.

=== Undergraduate level ===
The Sciences Po Undergraduate College offers a three-year Bachelor of Arts degree with a multidisciplinary foundation in the humanities and social sciences with emphasis on civic, linguistic, artistic, and digital training.

In the first year, students take foundational courses in six disciplines - economics, history, humanities, law, political science, and sociology. In the second year, students choose a multidisciplinary major – Politics &amp; Government, Economics &amp; Societies, or Political Humanities. The third year is spent abroad on an exchange programme with a partner university. In addition, each campus offers a different regional specialisation which anchors students&#x27; intellectual objectives, the regions are: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East-Mediterranean, and North America.

Sciences Po offers dual bachelor&#x27;s degrees with Columbia University, Keio University, University College London, Freie Universität Berlin, University of British Columbia, the University of Sydney, the National University of Singapore, the University of Hong Kong, and the University of California at Berkeley.

The current dean of the Undergraduate College is Stéphanie Balme.

In 2021, 15,284 students applied to the Undergraduate College across all three admissions pathways (the exam procedure, the Equal Opportunity Programme, and the international procedure). 1,630 students were accepted, for an admission rate of 7%.
Sciences Po has an acceptance rate of around 10% on Parcoursup (the national admissions platform for higher education) in 2021.

=== Graduate level ===
At the graduate level, Sciences Po&#x27;s seven schools offer one- and two-year Master&#x27;s programmes and PhD programmes. All graduate programmes are delivered on the Sciences Po campus in Paris. Sciences Po also hosts dual Master&#x27;s programmes with international partners. Students enrolled in these dual degree programmes spend one year at Sciences Po in Paris and one year at the partner university.

===Schools===
The Undergraduate College (&quot;Collège universitaire&quot;) is the home of all undergraduate students. At the graduate level, there are seven professional schools:
* School of Public Affairs
* Paris School of International Affairs
* Sciences Po Law School
* Urban School
* School of Management and Innovation
* Sciences Po Journalism School
* Doctoral School

The Doctoral School offers Master and PhD programmes in law, economics, history, political science, or sociology. The PhD programme contains roughly 600 doctoral candidates.

===Research===

Research at Sciences Po covers economics, law, history, sociology and political science, while also taking in interdisciplinary topics such as cities, political ecology, sustainable development, socio-economics and globalization.

Sciences Po is home to a research community that includes over 200 researchers and 350 PhD candidates. In 2015, 32% of the school&#x27;s budget was devoted to research. That year, 65% of its research publications were in French, 32% in English and 3% in other languages.

The institute has research centers, seven of which are affiliated with France&#x27;s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

* Center for Socio-Political Data (CDSP), which provides scientifically validated data for international survey programs. It also supports training in data collection and analysis.
* Centre for European Studies and Comparative Politics (CEE), which focuses on inter-disciplinary European studies; participation, democracy and government; election analyses; the restructuring of the state and public action.
* Centre for International Studies (CERI), which produces comparative and historical analysis on foreign societies, international relations, and political, social and economic phenomena.
* Centre for Political Research (CEVIPOF), which investigates political attitudes, behaviour and parties, as well as political thought and the history of ideas.
* Centre for History (CHSP), whose research focuses on: arts, knowledge and culture; wars, conflicts and violence; states, institutions and societies; the political and cultural history of contemporary France; from local to global; international history and its levels.
* Centre for the Sociology of Organisations (CSO), which conducts research on the sociology of organisations, sociology of public policy, and economic sociology. It also studies issues related to higher education and research, healthcare, sustainable development, the evolution of firms, and the transformation of the state.
* Center for Studies in Social Change (OSC), which conducts research on topics such as urban, school and gender inequalities, stratification and social mobility, and ethno-racial or social segregation.
* Department of Economics, which investigates areas such as labour markets, international economics, political economy, microeconomics and development.
* Law School, whose research focuses on globalisation, legal cultures and the economics of law. It has also produced work on the theory and history of law, public and private international law and intellectual property.
* Médialab, which studies the way data generated by new information technologies is produced, circulated and exploited.
* The Observatoire Français des Conjonctures Économiques (OFCE), which is both a research centre and an independent economic forecasting body. Its stated mission is to &quot;ensure that the fruits of scientific rigour and academic independence serve the public debate about the economy&quot;.

In addition to these research units, the institute has recently established three major research programs – the LIEPP, DIME-SHS and MaxPo.

*The Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire d&#x27;Evaluation des Politiques Publiques (LIEPP) analyzes public policy based on qualitative, comparative, and quantitative methods. The laboratory has been selected by an international scientific jury as a &quot;Laboratoire d&#x27;Excellence&quot; (Labex) that will be financed for the next ten years by the French government.
*Données Infrastructures et Méthodes d&#x27;Enquête en Sciences Humaines et Sociales (DIME-SHS) aims to collect and disseminate data for use in humanities and social sciences research.
*The Max Planck Sciences Po Center on Coping with Instability in Market Societies (known as MaxPo), was founded in 2012 in co-operation with the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (MPIfG). It investigates how individuals, organizations, and nation-states deal with various forms of economic and social instability. It is located at Sciences Po&#x27;s Paris campus.

===Library and publishing===
Founded in 1871, the nucleus of the school&#x27;s research is the &quot;Bibliothèque de Sciences Po&quot;. The library offers a collection of more than 950,000 titles in the field of social sciences.

In 1982, the Ministry of National Education made the &quot;Bibliothèque&quot; the Centre for Acquisition and Dissemination of Scientific and Technical Information in the field of political science, and since 1994, it has been the antenna associated with the &quot;Bibliothèque Nationale de France&quot;. The &quot;Bibliothèque de Sciences Po&quot; is also the main French partner in the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, which is based at the London School of Economics.

Founded in the 1950s, &quot;Presses de Sciences Po&quot; is the publishing house of Sciences Po. It publishes academic works related to the social sciences.

===Public lectures===
Sciences Po organizes public lecture events. Recent guest speakers have included Ban Ki-moon, General David Petraeus, Condoleezza Rice, former President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Eric Schmidt, Joseph Stiglitz, Sheryl Sandberg, Mario Draghi, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova and Harvard University professor Michael Sandel.

Since 2007 it has organized the Franco-British Dialogue Lecture Series in collaboration with the LSE and the French Embassy in London. The lectures are held every term at the LSE&#x27;s European Institute.

== Reputation and rankings ==

===National rankings===
Sciences Po has the highest attractivity rate of the French Institutes of political studies, as 86% of students who were admitted to its undergraduate programs accepted their offer. In 2022, the admission rate of the school was 10% as the undergraduate level, and 5% on the Paris campus. In 2023, French students who joined the school had scored an average of 17.9/20 at the Baccalauréat. 92% of French students admitted to undergraduate programs got their Baccalauréat Summa cum laude (&quot;mention Très bien&quot;).

National rankings place the school in first place in sociology, social policy and administration, in second place in development studies and law, and third place in economics.

=== International rankings ===
In rankings based on English-speaking publications, in 2023, Sciences Po ranks 2nd globally for the study of Politics in the QS World University Subjects Rankings, whereas it is ranked 39th in social sciences by Times Higher Education. In 2024, its global ranking in the QS World University Rankings decreased to the 319th rank.

===Reputation and criticism===

Sciences Po has been called France&#x27;s &quot;leading university in the social sciences&quot;. It is considered to be the most prestigious of all of the IEP (Instituts d&#x27;études politiques, or Institutes of Political Studies) in France. Sciences Po is widely regarded to be an elite institution due to its selectivity in admissions and its close connections to powerful networks within French society. It has been described as a &quot;school of power&quot; that has inspired schools abroad, such as the London School of Economics. Because of its role in training the French elite, it has been called the &quot;school of domination&quot;. According &quot;Le Monde&quot;, the school&#x27;s reputation for excellency and its prestige are such that some freshmen are sometimes &quot;disillusioned&quot; after having &quot;fantasized&quot; about the school.

Because of its role in training the French political, administrative and economic elite, the school has been criticized by far-left critics for the alleged close-mindedness of its students. Peter Gumbel called Sciences Po and other &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; &quot;elite colleges [which] have become a machine for perpetuating a brilliant but blinkered, often arrogant and frequently incompetent ruling freemasonry&quot;. The academic Gilles Devers criticized the institution for being the &quot;base of the conservatism, and the mold of the molluscs that make the public elite&quot; where &quot;dissenting ideas are only admitted if they strengthen the system&quot;.

Sciences Po&#x27;s core curriculum has historically been very transdisciplinary, as the students go through introductory classes to disciplines as diverse as political science, economics, history, law and international relations. This priority given to transversality of knowledge over expertise in one field has been the subject of praise as well as of criticism.

In 2021 Sciences Po was criticized for alleged grade inflation as a means to attract international students.

==Controversies==

=== Duhamel scandal ===

Camille Kouchner, daughter of Bernard Kouchner, published a book in which she wrote that her step-father Olivier Duhamel, at that time president of the Foundation of Sciences Po which was the &quot;heart of [his] power&quot; for 30 years, sexually abused his step-son for two years during his childhood. Newspapers further unearthed a series of controversial attitudes toward the sexuality of minors. It led to a series of investigations on the environment of Duhamel at Sciences Po and on the way they dealt with these abuses.

The scandal eventually led to a series of resignations under pressure at Sciences Po. Duhamel resigned. While Frédéric Mion initially refused to resign, it later became apparent that he had lied about not having heard the rumors about Duhamel. He resigned.

Following the Duhamel scandal, Sciences Po issued a statement condemning &quot;all forms of sexualized violence&quot; and declaring &quot;its shock and astonishment&quot;. It also stated: &quot;The fight against sexual and gender-based violence is at the heart of our institution&#x27;s core values and actions.&quot;

=== Sexual violence ===
After Richard Descoing, head of the school from 1997 to 2012, died, it was revealed that he had had sex with students, and made no case of Dominique Strauss-Kahn&#x27;s habit of &quot;seducing&quot; young students. Descoing was accused of sending sexual messages to students, but no further inquiry was made.

In February 2021, hundreds of students and former students shared on Twitter allegations of rape or sexual abuse at several Instituts d&#x27;études politiques, and claimed that despite denunciations of victims, &quot;colleagues and staff [were] unwilling to take their complaints seriously&quot;. A hashtag #SciencesPorcs (&quot;Sciences Pigs&quot;, similar to the French #Metoo hashtag #Balancetonporcs) has been widely used to do so.

Among many op-eds dealing with the 2021 crisis at Sciences Po, two male alumni published in &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; an op-ed specific to the sexual violence scandal, stating their disagreement with the &quot;caricature&quot; that is made of Sciences Po, which is allegedly the object of &quot;passions, sometimes irrational ones&quot; in the public &quot;imaginary&quot; because of the elite status they say the institute has; they assured there is no systemic problem regarding sexual violence in Sciences Po. Bénédicte Durand, interim administrator of the school, further told &quot;Le Figaro&quot; that &quot;no, there is no rape culture in Sciences Po&quot;. The school published a report on sexual and sexist violence that was called &quot;abundant but shy&quot;.

=== &quot;Racialism&quot; and social issues ===

Many students and some members of the French Parliament have expressed concern about the enforcement of &quot;racialism&quot; in Sciences Po.

===Financial scandals===
Alain Lancelot, director of Sciences Po from 1987 to 1996, was investigated for financial mismanagement by the French Court of Audit.

Under Richard Descoings, its director from 1997 to 2012, the school was hit by a few financial scandals. Descoings had been criticized for offering large sums of money (through salary rise, free accommodation, etc.) to diverse members of staff, including his wife, in spite of the fact that Sciences Po was partly state-funded.

In October 2012, the Court of Audit reprimanded Sciences Po for financial mismanagement, accusing it of opaque remuneration procedures, unwarranted expenses claims and excessive pay rises for managers. The Court noted that the school&#x27;s complex legal status – a public institute managed by a private trust – had contributed to a dysfunction and waste. It also criticized the French government for increasing state funding for the school without insisting on additional public oversight.

In July 2015, Jean-Claude Casanova, the former president of the &quot;Foundation Nationale des Sciences Politiques&quot;, the private trust which manages Sciences Po, was fined €1500 for failing to properly consult the Foundation&#x27;s Administrative Council over budgeting decisions involving public money. The Court of Financial and Budgetary Discipline eventually found Casanova guilty, but gave him a lenient sentence because the procedures had some part of regularity and because it was not customary in Sciences Po to follow all the financial rules.

In February 2016, the Court of Audit noted that reforms had been made, but stated that greater transparency was still needed. Frédéric Mion, the then director of Sciences Po, defended the school&#x27;s reforms.

=== Access to the Bar ===

In 2007, a governmental decree authorized Sciences Po students to pass the Bar exam, providing they take a master&#x27;s degree in law. This led to academics in universities to label the move as a &quot;coup&quot;, fearing that Sciences Po students would crowd out law students from the universities at the bar. According to them, Sciences Po did not offer enough law courses for barristers to have a solid education in law.

In 2009, Sciences Po created its law school, the &quot;École de droit de Sciences Po&quot; (&quot;law school&quot;, as opposed in French to a &quot;faculté de droit&quot;, &quot;faculty of law&quot;), delivering masters (graduate) degrees. In 2008, partly as an answer, Paris II Panthéon-Assas created a &quot;collège de droit&quot; (undergraduate level) and then an &quot;école de droit&quot; (graduate level) on top of its faculty of law to attract top students in France. A lot of universities followed this model, and created these selective &quot;colleges&quot; or &quot;schools&quot;.

==Notable people==
=== Alumni ===
It has been customary to graduate in Sciences Po in addition to a law school or a &quot;grande école&quot; in Paris, therefore many of these graduates are also graduates of the latter.

In 2016, the Sciences Po Alumni Association declared that there were 55,000 alumni. Many alumni are notable for their roles in fields such as politics or business.

==== Politics ====
Six of the eight presidents of the French Fifth Republic have attended Sciences Po, including Georges Pompidou, François Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy, François Hollande, and Emmanuel Macron. Alain Poher (who served twice as acting president) was also an alumnus. A number of French politicians who are Sciences Po alumni also graduated from Ecole Nationale d&#x27;Administration (ENA), as the Sciences Po degree and its preparatory programmes have shown high admittance rates to the ENA.

In 2017, 14% (81 of the 577) of French members of parliament elected that year were Sciences Po graduates, the most represented institution of higher learning and &quot;grande école&quot; in the National Assembly.

Some politicians having a role in international organisations were also students at Sciences Po, including Simone Veil, former President of the European Parliament; Boutros Boutros-Ghali, former UN Secretary General; Pascal Lamy, former Director-General of the World Trade Organisation; Michel Camdessus and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former presidents of the International Monetary Fund; Jean-Claude Trichet, former President of the European Central Bank; and Marisol Touraine, Chair of Unitaid Executive Board.

Sciences Po is also &quot;alma mater&quot; to politicians including Władysław Grabski (Prime Minister of Poland 1920, 1923–1925), Habib Bourgiba (Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia 1956–1957 and the first President of the Tunisian Republic 1957–1987), Joseph Ki-Zerbo (Burkinabé advocate for African independence), Mohammad Mosaddegh (Prime Minister of Iran 1951–1953), Pierre Trudeau (Prime Minister of Canada 1968–1979, 1980–1984), Thanat Khoman (Thai Minister of Foreign Affairs 1959–1971 and Deputy Prime Minister 1981–1983) and Salome Zourabichvili (President of Georgia since 2018).

<text>Poison Springs Battleground State Park is an Arkansas state park located southeast of Bluff City. It commemorates the Battle of Poison Spring in the American Civil War, which was part of the 1864 Camden Expedition, an element of a Union Army initiative to gain control of Shreveport, Louisiana and get a foothold in Texas.

In the battle, which was fought on April 18, 1864, Confederates and Choctaw Indians attacked and overcame a supply wagon of Union soldiers. The term &quot;poison spring&quot; arises from the apocryphal story that Confederate soldiers poisoned nearby springwater. The battle hastened the failure of the Camden expedition, and garnered notoriety for the slaughter of black Union soldiers from Kansas by the Confederate forces, which took no prisoners.

The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 as Poison Springs State Park, and, with other sites, is part of the Camden Expedition Sites National Historic Landmark. It was declared part of the National Historic Landmark in 1994.

==Description and administrative history==
The park includes about of land. It is located on both sides of Arkansas Highway 76, about northwest of Camden in Ouachita County. Highway 76 was constructed along the historic road that was used by the Union supply train when it was roadblocked and attacked by the Confederate force during the battle. The improved portion of the park, with a picnic area and interpretive signs, is located on the north side of the highway.

The battle, however, covered a much larger area, estimated at more than . The surrounding area is in roughly the same condition as it was at the time of the battle. The land that was then under cultivation has since been allowed to revert to forest.

The heavily wooded park features a small interpretive display and a shady trail. Sightings of deer and woodpeckers are common along the trail. The park provides an excellent example of the Gulf Coast forest region, consisting primarily of pine trees, but with some oak and with dogwood understory trees.

<text>Capo di Ponte (Camunian: ) is an Italian comune in Val Camonica, province of Brescia, in Lombardy.
Located above sea level, Capo di Ponte (en. &quot;Head of Bridge&quot;) owes its name to an ancient settlement to the west of a bridge over the River Oglio which leads to a hamlet named Cemmo. The present comune is on the eastern side of the river.

==History==
There are a number of rock art sites in this part of Val Camonica

Between the 11th and 14th centuries, Capo di Ponte was known as the hamlet of Cemmo—part of the priory of San Salvatore of Tezze.

In 1315 the Imesigo marsh, on the plain between Capo di Ponte and Sellero, was flooded by the River Re.

On 14 October 1336 the Bishop of Brescia, Jacopo de Atti, invested fiefs for a tenth of the rights in the territories of Incudine, Cortenedolo, Mù, Cemmo, Zero, Viviano and Capo di Ponte to Maffeo Giroldo Botelli of Nadro.

In 1698 Father Gregorio Brunelli says that the village of Zero (or Serio), which stood on banks of the River Re, east of the country today, was swept away by a flood.

After the fall of the Republic of Venice the &quot;comune of Capo di Ponte&quot; (1797–1798) was founded, later becoming &quot;comune of Cemmo and Capo di Ponte&quot; (1798 to 1815). Under the Lombardo-Veneto kingdom, the name was again changed to &quot;comune di Capo di Ponte e Cemmo&quot; (1816 to 1859). It has been known as Capo di Ponte since 1859.

==Main sights==

<doc id="1050944" wikidata="Q116634" url="?curid=1050944" title="Online game">
<text>An online game is a video game that is either partially or primarily played through the Internet or any other computer network available. Online games are ubiquitous on modern gaming platforms, including PCs, consoles and mobile devices, and span many genres, including first-person shooters, strategy games, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG). In 2019, revenue in the online games segment reached $16.9 billion, with $4.2 billion generated by China and $3.5 billion in the United States. Since the 2010s, a common trend among online games has been to operate them as games as a service, using monetization schemes such as loot boxes and battle passes as purchasable items atop freely-offered games. Unlike purchased retail games, online games have the problem of not being permanently playable, as they require special servers in order to function.

The design of online games can range from simple text-based environments to the incorporation of complex graphics and virtual worlds. The existence of online components within a game can range from being minor features, such as an online leaderboard, to being part of core gameplay, such as directly playing against other players. Many online games create their own online communities, while other games, especially social games, integrate the players&#x27; existing real-life communities. Some online games can receive a massive influx of popularity due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing them.

Online gaming has drastically increased the scope and size of video game culture. Online games have attracted players of a variety of ages, nationalities, and occupations. The online game content is now being studied in the scientific field, especially gamers&#x27; interactions within virtual societies in relation to the behavior and social phenomena of everyday life. As in other cultures, the community has developed a gamut of slang words or phrases that can be used for communication in or outside of games. Due to their growing online nature, modern video game slang overlaps heavily with internet slang, as well as leetspeak, with many words such as &quot;pwn&quot; and &quot;noob&quot;. Another term that was popularized by the video game community is the abbreviation &quot;AFK&quot; to refer to people who are not at the computer or paying attention. Other common abbreviations include &quot;GL HF&quot; which stands for &quot;good luck, have fun,&quot; which is often said at the beginning of a match to show good sportsmanship. Likewise, at the end of a game, &quot;GG&quot; or &quot;GG WP&quot; may be said to congratulate the opponent, win or lose, on a &quot;good game, well played&quot;. Many video games have also inspired internet memes and achieved a very large following online.

The culture of online gaming sometimes faces criticism for an environment that can promote cyberbullying, violence, and xenophobia. Some are also concerned about gaming addiction or social stigma. However, it has been argued that, since the players of an online game are strangers to each other and have limited communication, the individual player&#x27;s experience in an online game is not necessarily different from playing with artificial intelligence players.

== History ==
The history of online games dates back to the early days of packet-based computer networking in the 1970s, An early example of online games is MUDs, including the first, &quot;MUD1&quot;, which was created in 1978 and originally confined to an internal network before becoming connected to ARPANet in 1980. Commercial games followed in the next decade, with &quot;Islands of Kesmai&quot;, the first commercial online role-playing game, debuting in 1984, as well as more graphical games, such as the MSX LINKS action games in 1986, the flight simulator &quot;Air Warrior&quot; in 1987, and the Famicom Modem&#x27;s online Go game in 1987.
The rapid availability of the Internet in the 1990s led to an expansion of online games, with notable titles including &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;Quakeworld&quot; (1996), &quot;Ultima Online&quot; (1997), &quot;Lineage&quot; (1998), &quot;StarCraft&quot; (1998), &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; (1999) and &quot;EverQuest&quot; (1999). Video game consoles also began to receive online networking features, such as the Famicom Modem (1987), Sega Meganet (1990), Satellaview (1995), SegaNet (2000), PlayStation 2 (2000) and Xbox (2001). Following improvements in connection speeds, more recent developments include the popularization of new genres, such as social games, and new platforms, such as mobile games.

Entering into the 2000s, the cost of technology, servers, and the Internet has dropped so far that fast Internet was commonplace, which led to previously unknown genres like massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) becoming well-known. For example, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; (2004) dominated much of the decade. Several other MMOs attempted to follow in &quot;Warcraft&quot;″s footsteps, such as &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;, &quot;City of Heroes&quot;, &quot;Wildstar&quot;, &quot;Warhammer Online&quot;, &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, but failed to make a significant impact in &quot;Warcraft&quot;″s market share. Over time, the MMORPG community has developed a sub-culture with its own slang and metaphors, as well as an unwritten list of social rules and taboos.

Separately, a new type of online game came to popularity alongside &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot; (2003) which introduced the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) format. &quot;DotA&quot;, a community-created mod based on &quot;Warcraft III&quot;, gained in popularity as interest in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; waned, but since the format was tied to the &quot;Warcraft&quot; property, others began to develop their own MOBAs, including &quot;Heroes of Newerth&quot; (2009), &quot;League of Legends&quot; (2010), and &quot;Dota 2&quot; (2013). Blizzard Entertainment, the owner of &quot;Warcraft&quot; property, released their own take on the MOBA genre with &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; (2015), emphasizing on numerous original heroes from &quot;Warcraft III&quot; and other Blizzard&#x27;s franchises. By the early 2010s, the genre had become a big part of the esports category.

During the last half of the 2010s, hero shooter, a variation of shooter games inspired by multiplayer online battle arenas and older class-based shooters, had a substantial rise in popularity with the release of &quot;Battleborn&quot; and &quot;Overwatch&quot; in 2016&quot;.&quot; The genre continued to grow with games such as &quot;Paladins&quot; (2018) and &quot;Valorant&quot; (2020).

A battle royale game format became widely popular with the release of &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot; (2017), &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; (2017), and &quot;Apex Legends&quot; (2019). The popularity of the genre continued in the 2020s with the release of the &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone&quot; (2020). Each game has received tens of millions of players within months of its releases.

==Demographics==
The assumption that online games in general are populated mostly by males has remained somewhat accurate for years. Recent statistics begin to diminish the male domination myth in gaming culture. Although a worldwide number of male gamers still dominates over female (52% by 48%), women accounted for more than half of the players of certain games. As of 2019, the average gamer is 33 years old.

The report Online Game Market Forecasts estimates worldwide revenue from online games to reach $35 billion by 2017, up from $19 billion in 2011.

== Platforms ==

=== Console gaming ===

Xbox Live was launched in November 2002. Initially the console only used a feature called system link, where players could connect two consoles using an Ethernet cable, or multiple consoles through a router. With the original Xbox Microsoft launched Xbox Live, allowing shared play over the internet. A similar feature exists on the PlayStation 3 in the form of the PlayStation Network, and the Wii also supports a limited amount of online gaming. Nintendo also had a network, dubbed &quot;Nintendo Network&quot;, that fully supported online gaming with the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. With the launch of the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo launched the Nintendo Switch Online service to replace the older Nintendo Network.

===Browser games===
As the World Wide Web developed and browsers became more sophisticated, people started creating browser games that used a web browser as a client. Simple single player games were made that could be played using a web browser (most commonly made with web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, ASP, PHP and MySQL).

The development of web-based graphics technologies such as Flash and Java allowed browser games to become more complex. These games, also known by their related technology as &quot;Flash games&quot; or &quot;Java games&quot;, became increasingly popular. Games ranged from simple concepts to large-scale games, some of which were later released on consoles. Many Java or Flash games were shared on various different websites, bringing them to wide audiences. Browser-based pet games are popular among the younger generation of online gamers. These games range from gigantic games with millions of users, such as &quot;Neopets&quot;, to smaller and more community-based pet games.

More recent browser-based games use web technologies like Ajax to make more complicated multiplayer interactions possible and WebGL to generate hardware-accelerated 3D graphics without the need for plugins.

== Types of interactions ==
===Player versus environment (PvE)===

PvE is a term used in online games, particularly MMORPGs and other role-playing video games, to refer to fighting computer-controlled opponents.

===Player versus player (PvP)===

PvP is a term broadly used to describe any game, or aspect of a game, where players compete against each other rather than against computer-controlled opponents.

==Online games==
===First-person shooter game (FPS)===

During the 1990s, online games started to move from a wide variety of LAN protocols (such as IPX) and onto the Internet using the TCP/IP protocol. &quot;Doom&quot; popularized the concept of a deathmatch, where multiple players battle each other head-to-head, as a new form of online game. Since Doom, many first-person shooter games contain online components to allow deathmatch or arena style play. And by popularity, first person shooter games are becoming more and more widespread around the world. As games became more realistic and competitive, an e-sports community was born. Games like &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, &quot;Quake Live&quot; and &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; are popular with these tournaments&quot;.&quot; These tournaments have a range of winnings from money to hardware.

Expansion of hero shooters, a sub-genre of shooter games, happened in 2016 when several developers released or announced their hero shooter multiplayer online game. Hero shooters have been considered to have strong potential as an esport, as a large degree of skill and coordination arises from the importance of teamwork. Some notable examples include &quot;Battleborn&quot;, &quot;Overwatch&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Valorant&quot;.

===Real-time strategy game (RTS)===

Early real-time strategy games often allowed multiplayer play over a modem or local network. As the Internet started to grow during the 1990s, software was developed that would allow players to tunnel the LAN protocols used by the games over the Internet. By the late 1990s, most RTS games had native Internet support, allowing players from all over the globe to play with each other. Popular RTS games with online communities have included &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, &quot;Sins of a Solar Empire&quot;, &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War&quot;.

===Massively multiplayer online game (MMO)===

Massively multiplayer online games were made possible with the growth of broadband Internet access in many developed countries, using the Internet to allow hundreds of thousands of players to play the same game together. Many different styles of massively multiplayer games are available, such as:
*MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game)
*MMORTS (Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy)
*MMOFPS (Massively multiplayer online first-person shooter)
*MMOSG (Massively multiplayer online social game)

===Multiplayer online battle arena game (MOBA)===

A specific subgenre of strategy video games referred to as multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) gained popularity in the 2010s as a form of electronic sports, encompassing games such as the &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot; mod for &quot;Warcraft III&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Dota 2&quot;, &quot;Smite,&quot; and &quot;Heroes of the Storm.&quot; Major esports professional tournaments are held in venues that can hold tens of thousands of spectators and are streamed online to millions more. A strong fanbase has opened up the opportunity for sponsorship and advertising, eventually leading the genre to become a global cultural phenomenon.

===Battle Royale games===

A battle royale game is a genre that blends the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a survival game with last-man-standing gameplay. Dozens to hundreds of players are involved in each match, with the winner being the last player or team alive. Some notable examples include &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;, &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;, &quot;Apex Legends,&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone,&quot; each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases. The genre is designed exclusively for multiplayer gameplay over the Internet.

===MUD===

MUD is a class of multi-user real-time virtual worlds, usually but not exclusively text-based, with a history extending back to the creation of &quot;MUD1&quot; by Richard Bartle in 1978. MUD were the direct predecessors of MMORPG.

=== Other notable games ===
A social deduction game is a multiplayer online game in which players attempt to uncover each other&#x27;s hidden role or team allegiance using logic and deductive reasoning, while other players can bluff to keep players from suspecting them. A notable example of the social deduction video game is &quot;Among Us,&quot; which received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. &quot;Among Us&quot; has also inspired internet memes and achieved a very large following online.

==Online game governance==
Online gamers must agree to an End-user license agreement (EULA) when they first install the game application or an update. EULA is a legal contract between the producer or distributor and the end-user of an application or software, which is to prevent the program from being copied, redistributed or hacked. The consequences of breaking the agreement vary according to the contract. Players could receive warnings to termination, or direct termination without warning. In the 3D immersive world &quot;Second Life&quot; where a breach of contract will append the player warnings, suspension and termination depending on the offense.

Where online games supports an in-game chat feature, it is not uncommon to encounter hate speech, sexual harassment and cyberbullying. Players, developers, gaming companies, and professional observers are discussing and developing tools which discourage antisocial behavior.
There are also sometimes Moderators present, who attempt to prevent anti-Social behavior. Online games also often involve real-life illegal behavior, such as scam, financial crimes, invasion of privacy, and other issues.

Recent development of gaming governance requires all video games (including online games) to hold a rating label. The voluntary rating system was established by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). A scale can range from &quot;E&quot; (stands for Everyone) inferring games that are suitable for both children and adults, to &quot;M&quot; (stands for Mature) recommending games that are restricted to age above 17. Some explicit online games can be rated &quot;AO&quot; (stands for Adult Only), identifying games that have content suitable for only adults over the age of 18. Furthermore, online games must also carry an ESRB notice that warns that any &quot;online interactions are not rated by the ESRB&quot;.

==Shutdown of games==
The video game industry is highly competitive. As a result, many online games end up not generating enough profits, such that the service providers do not have the incentives to continue running the servers. In such cases, the developers of a game might decide to shut down the server permanently.

Shutting down an online game can severely impact the players. Typically, a server shutdown means players will no longer be able to play the game. For many players, this can cause a sense of loss at an emotional level, since they often dedicate time and effort to making in-game progress, e.g., completing in-game tasks to earn items for their characters. In some other cases, the game might still be playable without the server, but certain important functionalities will be lost. For example, earning key in-game items often requires a server that can track each player&#x27;s progress.

In some cases, an online game may be relaunched in a substantially different form after shutting down, in an attempt to increase the game&#x27;s quality, remedy low sales, or reverse a declining player base, and see significantly greater success. &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; was negatively received upon its 2010 release, and relaunched as &quot;A Realm Reborn&quot; in 2013 - the new version was met with considerable positive reception, and is still running as of 2022. &quot;Splitgate: Arena Warfare&quot; relaunched as &quot;Splitgate&quot; in 2021, switching to a free-to-play model and adding cross-platform multiplayer, and subsequently saw 2 million new players, with the servers being unable to handle the influx.

However, games may remain a commercial failure despite a planned relaunch. These include the 2015 asymmetrical first-person shooter &quot;Evolve&quot;, which transitioned to a free-to-play title known as &quot;Evolve Stage 2&quot; a year after launch, after it was criticized for its significant amount of DLC despite being a full-priced game, but had its servers permanently shut down roughly two years later after its user base &quot;evaporated&quot; as a result of infrequent updates. The 2019 looter-shooter &quot;Anthem&quot; was also planned to be relaunched as &quot;Anthem Next&quot;, but the changes were never implemented, partially due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and an unwillingness to further invest in the game by &quot;Electronic Arts&quot;.

<text>Loja (), formerly Loxa and fully City of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of Loja (), is the capital of Ecuador&#x27;s Loja Province. It is located in the Cuxibamba valley in the south of the country, sharing borders with the provinces of Zamora-Chinchipe and other cantons of the province of Loja. Loja holds a rich tradition in the arts, and for this reason is known as the Music and Cultural Capital of Ecuador. The city is home to two major universities.

The city has a population of about 203,000, and is situated 2060 m (6758 ft) above sea level. It has a mild Andean climate, ranging between 16 and 30 °C.

The Pan-American Highway runs past Loja.

==History==
The city of Loja was colonized by Field Marshal Alonso de Mercadillo in 1548, and it is named for his hometown of Loja in Spain. Originally located near La Toma in the Catamayo canyon since 1546, the city was relocated to its present location (about 35 km east) after a devastating earthquake and problems with Malaria. At nearly 500 years, it is one of the oldest cities in Ecuador. One of its founding-reasons for the Spanish colonizers was to have a fortified town next to the region of Zaruma, which was in that time rich in gold. It was as well a departure point for the Amazon Basin to search for the mystic town of El Dorado. The city was also visited by Simón Bolívar in his campaign to unite Gran Colombia. It declared its independence from Spain on November 18, 1820.

The city of Loja has the distinction of being the first city in Ecuador to be wired for electric power provided by a hydroelectric dam that was completed in the 1890s.

==Geography==
Loja is in the bottom of the broad glacial Cuxibamba valley. It lies between the humid Amazon Basin and the Peruvian sechura, and is composed mainly of paramo, cloud-forest, and jungle. The valley borders the Podocarpus National Park, which is a massive cloud-forest reserve accessible through the Cajanuma gates just minutes outside the city. The Rio Zamora and Rio Malacatos flow through the city of Loja.

===Climate===
Loja has a mild Andean climate, generally warm during the days and colder and often wetter at night. The average temperature is . June and July brings an eastern drizzle with the trade winds, and is referred to as the &quot;windy season.&quot; Due to its valley location, the city is often misty in the morning with general absence of sunshine, clearing off towards the afternoon.

==Economy==

Loja is the capital of one of Ecuador&#x27;s main coffee-growing provinces.
Close to the city of Loja, the first wind power station of Ecuador is located with a visitors center and 11 generators.

==Arts and culture==
There is a thriving musical scene in Loja, in keeping with the city&#x27;s reputation. There are numerous small music and salsa clubs, and it is not uncommon to hear Lojanos singing as they go about their day. On Sundays, the local police band performs in the Plaza de Independencia outside of San Sebastian Church.

The city is full of public artworks, including massive painted tile murals, frescoes, and statuary. Of particular note are the frescoes of Bolívar and Sucre that greet visitors as they pass through the gates of the city.

Loja is the birthplace of several renowned intellectuals, such as: Pablo Palacio, Benjamín Carrión, Miguel Riofrío, Ángel Felicísimo Rojas, among others.

===Annual cultural events===
* May 30 - August 15 - Pilgirmage of the Virgin of El Cisne
* June 25 - Foundation of Loja Province
* September 1–15 - Ecuador-Peru Border Integration Fair
* November 1 - Return of the Virgin of Cisne to the town of El Cisne
* November 18 - Independence of Loja
* December 8 - Foundation of Loja

==Points of interest==

* Puerta de la Ciudad
The gates of the city are modeled after the coat of arms of the city, presented by King Philip II of Spain in 1571. The gate is on Av. Gran Colombia, and houses four galleries which show contemporary Lojano artwork, and a cafeteria and gift shop.
Loja contains a number of historic churches; the city&#x27;s board of tourism has approached finding them in a novel manner. Beginning at the Puerta de la Ciudad, one of the first thing a tourist will notice is a large orange stripe painted on the sidewalk. Following the stripe takes the interested on a self-guided tour of the main historic churches and areas of Loja.
* Cathedral
The main Cathedral, built in the colonial style, is located on the central square. It is home for six months of the year to the Virgin of Cisne, whose statue is carried on the backs of the faithful to and from the town of Cisne, 45 km north of Loja. The procession shuts the road to traffic twice a year, and it is a mark of pride among Lojanos to participate. Original adobe in the cathedral building dates from the 16th century; the current building dates from 1838 (previous edifices were lost to earthquakes). The Cathedral is one of the largest churches in Ecuador. It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Loja.
* Church of San Francisco
The small Church of San Francisco houses the city&#x27;s Franciscan convent. The church was built in 1548 and then rebuilt in 1851. The plaza, located on the corner of Av. Bolivar and Av. Colon, features a monument to Alonso de Mercadillo, founder of the city.
* Church of Santo Domingo
The Church of Santo Domingo was built in 1557; the entire edifice was once in the Gothic style, but after an earthquake in 1867 only the twin spires remained standing. The church was refinished in the colonial style, but the spires were left as a reminder of the former facade. The church was painted and decorated by notable Lojano Fray Enrique Mideros. In the plaza of the church stands a monument to Manuel Carrión Pinzano, a founder in 1853 of the Federalism movement in Loja.
* Church of San Sebastian
In 1660, the city of Loja was consecrated to St. Sebastian in order to prevent destruction by earthquakes. The present church dates from 1900. Perhaps the most notable landmark of Loja stands on the Plaza San Sebastian (also called the Plaza of Independence) - the 32 meter clock tower commemorates the declaration of independence from the Spanish Crown on November 18, 1820. The tower has four faces with brass bas relief depicting scenes from the city&#x27;s history.
* Monuments
There are numerous other monuments to famous Lojanos and Ecuadorians. Central Square contains the monument to Bernardo Valdivieso, the founder of Loja&#x27;s universities; a monument to Bolívar is housed in a park of the same name to commemorate his visit to Loja in October 1822. A monument to Pío Jaramillo stands on the south end of the avenue bearing his name, and at the junction of Av. Jaramillo and Av. Carrión stands a monument to Benjamin Carrion. A monument to Isidro Ayora stands in the roundabout in front of the bus terminal.

==Sports==
The city is home of Liga de Loja, a major football team that plays in the Ecuadorian professional football league.

==Parks and recreation==

There are three parks of note inside the city, and a botanical garden just outside the city limits.
* Jipiro
In the north of the city, Jipiro Park covers more than 10 hectares, is home to various native bird species, and is notable for its scale reproductions of historic and cultural buildings. The park boasts a pagoda, mosque, St. Basil&#x27;s cathedral, a medieval castle, and many more, as well as a lake for paddle-boating with an island aviary. 
* La Banda Park
Next to Jipiro on the eastern and western shores of the Rio Zamora, is a huge greenspace with a public carting race track, riding trails, an orchid nursery, and the Loja zoo.
* Parque Pucará de Podocarpus 
On a hill called Pucará de Podocarpus, this is a children&#x27;s park with playground equipment and a beautiful scenic view. It is located on the city&#x27;s former drinking water treatment plant.
* Jardín Botánico Reinaldo Espinosa
Across the road from University Park is the botanical garden which is open to the public and the oldest in Ecuador, created in 1949. There are over 800 native and exotic species. It is a living laboratory for scientific research and environmental education. It covers an area of 7 hectares divided into 5 sections for viewing. Most of the trees in this garden are over 40 years old, and the park is one of the world&#x27;s highest-altitude botanical gardens.

<text>Piscataway School Board v. Taxman, 91 F.3d 1547 (3d Cir. 1996) is a United States labor law case on racial discrimination, that began in 1989 against the Piscataway Township Schools.

==Facts==
The school board of Piscataway, New Jersey needed to eliminate a teaching position from the high school&#x27;s Business Education department. Under New Jersey state law, tenured teachers have to be laid off in reverse order of seniority. However, the board faced a problem, as the district&#x27;s least senior tenured teachers, Sharon Taxman (a white teacher) and Debra Williams (an African-American teacher), had started working at the school on the same day, and thus had equal seniority. In the interest of maintaining racial diversity (Williams was the only African-American teacher in the department, and 50% of the students were minorities), the school board voted to lay off Taxman. Taxman complained to the EEOC, saying that the board had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and was given authority to file suit against the board.

==Judgment==
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in favor of Taxman.

==Significance==
The school board appealed to the United States Supreme Court and a hearing was scheduled for January 1998, but civil rights groups, fearing that the case could lead to the prohibition of affirmative action, provided money for the board to settle the case out of court, so the case was never heard.

Taxman was subsequently rehired, and later reassigned to Conackamack Middle School.

Williams retired at the conclusion of the 2009–2010 school year.

== History ==
Before the establishment of Federal Way Public Schools (FWPS) in 1929; the area was thinly populated and characterized by early settlers working in logging, trapping or previously served in the military. Settlements were sparse as many individuals preferred to reside closer to Tacoma or Seattle, where educational opportunities were more accessible. Within the Federal Way vicinity, education was overlooked, as homesteaders provided informal instruction to their families or had none at all. However, the landscape began to change by the early 1880s, as a wave of emigrants began to settle in and around Poverty Bay and Auburn-- marking the beginning of community development in the area.

The formal establishment of FWPS began in 1929, with the consolidation of five small school districts into District 210, known as Federal Way. Since its inception, the district has expanded significantly to accommodate the growing population. Federal Way High School opened its doors in 1938, with numerous elementary and middle schools following suit in the subsequent decades. As FWPS recently celebrated their 90th anniversary in 2019, they still vouch for their tagline, &quot;Each scholar: a voice, a dream, a bright future. Since then, the school district underwent a transition from Junior High Schools to Middle Schools during the 2002 to 2004 time period.

==Governance==
The Board of Directors for Federal Way Public Schools consists of five members who are elected by the voters of the entire school district. Each director must reside and be a registered voter, at the time of their election or appointment, in the geographical region, known as a Director District, they represent on the board. The Board also consists of two student representatives, selected by the Board of Directors. The length of the term is four years. Board meetings are generally held twice monthly. Currently, board meetings are typically scheduled for the second and fourth Tuesday of the month at 6:00 p.m., with some exceptions, at various schools in the district.
==Demographics==

Out of 21,136 students, the demographic is as follows:

* 20.6% White
* 15.9% Black
* 12.2% Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander
* 11.3% Two or more races
* 6.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
* 0.5% American Indian or Alaska Native

Enrollment by gender is

* 48% Female
* 52% Male

==Censorship==
On January 9, 2007, the Federal Way Public School District temporarily blocked its teachers from showing global warming documentary &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; without presenting a &quot;credible, legitimate opposing view&quot;. The order was passed after Frosty Hardison, a Federal Way parent, complained about the movie&#x27;s use in his daughter&#x27;s class. Hardison was quoted in the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; citing Biblical predictions of the age and end of the world, and saying neither condones Al Gore&#x27;s view points being taught within school. The Board cited its policies on the teaching of controversial issues, neither of which provide for a moratorium. On January 23, after two weeks of criticism in the local and national scene, the Board backtracked and repealed the moratorium, but still insisted that opposing views need to be considered.

== Curriculum and programs ==
In the Federal Way Public School District, 71% of high school students in the district have taken an advanced course and 92% of students taking an advanced course are earning a passing grade. Along with this, 63% of students enrolled in a two or four year college program and 81% of scholars who attended a four-year postsecondary institution were continuously enrolled.

Federal Way Public Schools has also hosted an annual STEM Exploration Night since 2017; and in 2018, they launched Scholar Art in the City, an initiative that displays student art and writing in businesses and organizations across the city of Federal Way.

In 2021, the school district mandated that students earn 24 hours of community service as a graduation requirement, with this being the standard for the following graduating classes.

<text>The software program VICE, standing for &quot;VersatIle Commodore Emulator&quot;, is a free and cross platform emulator for Commodore&#x27;s 8-bit computers. It runs on Linux, Amiga, Unix, MS-DOS, Win32, macOS, OS/2, RISC OS, QNX, GP2X, Pandora, Dingoo A320, Syllable, and BeOS host machines. VICE is free software, released under the GNU General Public License since 2004.

VICE for Microsoft Windows (Win32) prior to v3.3 were known as WinVICE, the OS/2 variant is called Vice/2, and the emulator running on BeOS is called BeVICE.

== History ==
The development of VICE began in 1993 by a Finnish programmer Jarkko Sonninen, who was the founder of the project. Sonninen retired from the project in 1994.

VICE 2.1, released on December 19, 2008, emulates the Commodore 64, Commodore 128, Commodore VIC-20, Commodore Plus/4, C64 Direct-to-TV (with its additional video modes) and all the Commodore PET models including the CBM-II but excluding the &#x27;non-standard&#x27; features of the SuperPET 9000. WinVICE supports digital joysticks via a parallel port driver, and, with a CatWeasel PCI card, is planned to perform hardware SID playback (requires optional SID chip installed in socket).

 VICE was one of the most widely used emulators of the Commodore 8-bit personal computers. It is also one of the few usable Commodore emulators to exist on free Unix-based platforms, including most Linux and BSD distributions.

VICE 3.4 drops support for Syllable Desktop, SCO, QNX, SGI, AIX, OPENSTEP/NeXTSTEP/Rhapsody, and Solaris/OpenIndiana, as well as remaining traces of support for Minix, SkyOS, UNIXWARE, and Sortix, due to lack of staff.

VICE 3.5 drops explicit support for OS/2 and AmigaOS, due to the transition to GTK3 UI.

In December 2022, the VICE emulator was used as an inspiration for an Apple Macintosh emulator powered by a Raspberry Pi.

<text>Castel Goffredo (; ) is a (municipality) in the province of Mantua, in Lombardy, northern Italy, from Mantua and a few more from Brescia. It lies in a region of springs at the foot of the slopes that drain into Lake Garda, towards the plain of the Po. 
Castel Goffredo borders the following municipalities: Castiglione delle Stiviere, Medole, Ceresara, Casaloldo, Asola, Acquafredda, Carpenedolo.

==History==
Founded in a region inhabited from the Bronze Age, Castel Goffredo belonged to the count-bishops of Brescia from the ninth century to 1115, when the commune was established. When Brescia proved unable to come to the commune&#x27;s defense, in 1337 it placed itself under the protection of Mantua and the Gonzaga. From 1348 to 1404 it was governed from Milan by the Visconti and returned to the Gonzaga in 1441.
Castel Goffredo became the seat of an autonomous &quot;feudo&quot; of marquis Aloysio Gonzaga in 1511. At his death, his fiefs of Castel Goffredo, Castiglione delle Stiviere and Solferino were divided among his three sons. The eldest, Alfonso, who gained Castel Goffredo, was assassinated in 1592 by members of the household of his nephew Rodolfo Gonzaga of Castiglione, brother of the saintly Aloysius Gonzaga; Alfonso, publicly tried for murder but acquitted, was murdered in turn, 31 January 1593, occasioning a popular uprising that re-established the &quot;Magnifica Comunità&quot;. The territory was annexed in 1603 by the duchy of Milan following a bitter suit heard before the Emperor, and remained Milanese territory until 1707. 
In 1707, the Austrians took over the region and the Habsburgs then ruled the area until 1859, save only for a decade or so of French rule during the time of Napoleonic Wars. 
After the Battle of Solferino, the town was briefly part of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, until that kingdom itself developed, in 1861, into the united Kingdom of Italy.

==Economy==
The town of Castel Goffredo has been involved in textile production since medieval times. The original source material was wool, but in the 1700s, the leading family of the town, the Acerbi, introduced silk-worm farming and silk-production became an important sector. Cotton weaving was also introduced around this time. The production of cotton and silk was revolutionised by the industrial processes of the twentieth century, which also saw the introduction of the new synthetics into the business.
During the 20th century, the area underwent a period of sustained and steady economic development and growth. In 2002, Castel Goffredo was recognised as a titular &#x27;città&#x27;, though it remains a &quot;comune&quot; and not a city in the general sense. 
The first modern textile-factory was built in 1925 and others soon followed. They took great advantage of the post-war boom and began to specialise, in particular, in the manufacture of hosiery. The area is now a centre of expertise in the production of socks and of lingerie:

<text>The Lost Villages were ten communities (nine conventional villages and a populated island) in the Canadian province of Ontario, in the former townships of Cornwall and Osnabruck (now South Stormont) near Cornwall, which were permanently submerged by the creation of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1958.

The flooding was expected and planned for as the result of the Moses-Saunders Power Dam construction, which began in August 1954. In the weeks and months leading up to the inundation, families and businesses in the affected communities were moved to the new planned communities of Long Sault and Ingleside. These negotiations were controversial, however, as many residents of the communities felt that market value compensation was insufficient since the Seaway plan had already depressed property values in the region.

The town of Iroquois was also flooded, but was relocated north rather than being abandoned. Another community, Morrisburg, was partially submerged as well, but the area to be flooded was moved to higher ground within the same townsite. In all, approximately 6,500 people were displaced by the project, 530 buildings moved, and countless other homes, schools, and businesses demolished. A portion of the provincial Highway 2 in the area was flooded; the highway was rebuilt along a Canadian National Railway right-of-way in the area.

At 8 a.m. on 1 July 1958, a large cofferdam was demolished, allowing the flooding to begin. Four days later, all of the former townsites were fully underwater. Parts of the New York shoreline were flooded by the project as well, but no communities were lost on the American side of the river.

==Legacy==
A museum in Ault Park near Long Sault is devoted to the Lost Villages, including several historic buildings salvaged from the communities. Other buildings from the villages were moved to the site of Upper Canada Village in Morrisburg. The flooded area also includes Crysler&#x27;s Farm, where a major battle was fought during the War of 1812. A monument commemorating the battle was also moved from Crysler&#x27;s Farm to Upper Canada Village.

Although Save Ontario Shipwrecks generally surveys shipwrecks, chapters also explored several of the Lost Villages sites. Guard Lock 21, which was constructed in 1885/86, was flooded in 1936 as headwater for the Hydro dam at Cornwall. Lock 21 of the former Cornwall Canal (since replaced by the St. Lawrence Seaway) is a popular scuba diving site, a few feet from the shore along the Parkway. Mille Roches Power House (1901) at Cornwall was demolished prior to inundation in 1955 with the new powerdam and seaway nearing completion.

In some locations, a few remnants of sidewalks and building foundations can still be seen under the water, or even on the shoreline when water levels are sufficiently low. In 2013, the photographer Louis Helbig documented the presence of some of these features using aerial photography. Some high points of land in the flooded area remained above water as islands, and are connected by the Long Sault Parkway.

<text>The Kenya men&#x27;s national cricket team represents the Republic of Kenya in international cricket. Kenya is an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) which has Twenty20 International (T20I) status after the ICC granted T20I status to all its members.

They have been an associate member of the ICC since 1981. Since then they have played in five Cricket World Cups from 1996 to 2011 with their best result being a bronze medal finish as the semi-final appearance at the 2003 Cricket World Cup in Southern Africa. They have only qualified for one ICC World Twenty20 tournament, in 2007. The Kenyan national team is governed by Cricket Kenya.

Kenya gained One Day International (ODI) status in 1996 in preparation for the 1996 Cricket World Cup and would have it for eighteen years before losing it at the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier where they finished in the fifth place. Kenya recently qualified the subqualifiers round has advanced and set to play the qualifiers round for the upcoming 2026 t20 world cup.

==History==
===East Africa team===
:&quot;Full article: East Africa cricket team&quot;

Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda combined to form the East Africa cricket team, which became an associate member of the ICC in 1966. They continued playing amongst themselves, and were joined by Zambia in a quadrangular tournament played annually between 1966 and 1980.

India toured East Africa in 1967 and played a three-day match against Kenya on 5 August, which was drawn. Various tours of, and by, East Africa continued, including a tour of England in 1972 and a first-class match between East Africa and the MCC at Nairobi Gymkhana Club in 1974 before East Africa took part in the first Cricket World Cup.

The 1975 Cricket World Cup took place in England, and East Africa was one of two non-test teams invited to the tournament, the other being Sri Lanka. Kenya provided half of the fourteen-man squad for the tournament. After warm-up matches against Somerset, Wales, Glamorgan and various club sides, they played in the same first round group as England, India and New Zealand, losing to all three. The World Cup was followed by a first-class match against Sri Lanka at the County Ground, Taunton.

East Africa then took part in the 1979 ICC Trophy, the first ICC Trophy tournament, but did not progress beyond the first round, thus missing out on qualification for the 1979 World Cup.

===ICC membership===
Long considered the strongest part of the East Africa team, Kenya broke away in 1981 and joined the ICC in their own right as an associate member, shortly after a tour of Zimbabwe in 1980/81. They played two three-day matches against Zimbabwe on that tour, losing both. Kenya played in the ICC Trophy in their own right in 1982, 1986, and 1990, also playing their first first-class match against Pakistan B in September 1986.

===1996 World Cup===
The 1994 ICC Trophy was hosted in Nairobi and Kenya finished as runners-up to the UAE, thus qualifying for the 1996 World Cup. Kenya then played at home against India A in August 1995, and went on a tour to South Africa in September/October that year, before playing in the World Cup, which was to bring Kenyan cricket to a much wider audience, and catapult them into the spotlight.

Kenya was in the same group as Australia, India, Sri Lanka, the West Indies and Zimbabwe. They played their very first ODI match against India.
In what at the time was described as the most startling upsets in the history of the World Cup, Kenya bowled out the West Indies for just 93 and won by 73 runs.

The Kenya national team arrived in India for its maiden World Cup, having players like Steve Tikolo, Maurice Odumbe and Thomas Odoyo. The team was expected to be crushed by the full member sides in its group and this proved to be correct in most of their matches. But the highlights of their campaign was beating former World Champions the West Indies in a low-scoring affair.

===ODI status===

Following their World Cup performance, Kenya were given full ODI status by the ICC, and hosted a quadrangular tournament against Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka in September/October 1996. The Netherlands toured in December, playing four one-day matches, with the Kenyans winning them all. They played in the quarter finals of South Africa&#x27;s Standard Bank Cup in March 1997, losing to Natal by 104 runs at Kingsmead. Following this was the 1997 ICC Trophy, hosted in Malaysia. Kenya reached the final, where they lost to Bangladesh by two wickets. This was followed by a tri-series against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in October the same year in Nairobi.

England A were the first opposition in 1998, touring Kenya in January. The three-day match ended in a draw, while England A won the only one-day match that wasn&#x27;t abandoned due to the weather. After this was another spot in the quarter final of the Standard Bank Cup, this time losing to Gauteng by 8 wickets. Kenya visited India in May, playing a triangular ODI series against Bangladesh and India. In the final match of the round-robin stage, Kenya pulled off an upset by beating India by 69 runs.
Kenya then competed in the cricket tournament at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. Drawn in the same first round group as New Zealand, Pakistan and Scotland, Kenya only beat the Scots, and finished third in the points table for the group.

Kenya warmed up for the 1999 World Cup with a triangular series in Bangladesh against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. In the 1999 World Cup itself, they were placed in the same first round group as England, India, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Following warm-up games against Somerset, Gloucestershire and Glamorgan, they lost all five of their games in the tournament proper. Following the World Cup, they played a quadrangular tournament at home against India, South Africa and Zimbabwe, again losing all their games.

The 21st century started for Kenya with a visit to Zimbabwe to play in the ICC Emerging Nations Tournament against Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Scotland and Zimbabwe A. Kenya won the tournament and took this form onto a seven-match tour of India on which they lost just one game. Pakistan A toured Kenya in July, playing a five match one-day series and a four-day first-class match. The four-day match was drawn, and Kenya won the one-day series 4–1. The 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy was played in Nairobi in October, with Kenya falling to India at the first hurdle.

The first opponents for Kenya in 2001 were Sri Lanka A, who toured Kenya in January, playing two first-class matches and four one-day matches. Both first-class matches were drawn, and Sri Lanka A won the first two one-day games, with the final two being abandoned. The West Indies came in August for two first-class games and a three-match ODI series. The first first-class game was won by the West Indies, with the second being drawn, and the three ODIs all went the way of the visitors. Kenya then played an ODI triangular tournament in South Africa in October, against India and the hosts, and picked up a second ODI win over India.

Zimbabwe A toured Kenya towards the end of the year, losing a first-class series 1–0 and a one-day series 3–2.
Kenya toured Sri Lanka in early 2002, playing three first-class and three one-day matches against Sri Lanka A. Sri Lanka A won all three of the first-class games, but Kenya won the one-day series 2–1. The MCC toured Kenya shortly after this, playing one three-day match and six one-day matches against the national side. Five of the one-day matches went the way of the Kenyans before the sixth one-day match and the three-day match were abandoned. Kenya then played in the ICC 6 Nations Challenge tournament in Windhoek, Namibia, playing against Canada, Namibia, the Netherlands, Sri Lanka A and Zimbabwe A. Kenya won the tournament, beating Sri Lanka A by 3 wickets in the final. In August/September, Kenya hosted an ODI triangular tournament against Australia and Pakistan, losing all four of their matches. This was followed by a place in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, though Kenya lost to the West Indies and South Africa, failing to progress beyond the first round.

Namibia toured Kenya in November, playing four one-day games. Kenya won the series 2–1, with one game being abandoned. Kenya then toured Zimbabwe to round off the year, playing three one-day matches against Zimbabwe A, and a three-match ODI series against the full Zimbabwean side. Zimbabwe won the ODI series 2–0, with one match finishing in a no result, and Zimbabwe A won their series against Kenya 2–1.

===2003 World Cup and decline===
The 2003 Cricket World Cup was to be Kenya&#x27;s finest moment in international cricket to date. The tournament was held in South Africa, with Kenya hosting their two matches against Sri Lanka and New Zealand. The tournament started with a defeat to South Africa, but Kenya bounced back with a four wicket win over Canada in Cape Town. New Zealand forfeited their match against Kenya in Nairobi due to safety concerns, but Sri Lanka did visit Nairobi and much to their dismay lost by 53 runs as Kenya pulled off another upset victory.

The tournament continued, back in South Africa, with a win over Bangladesh and a defeat to the West Indies. Kenya had done enough to qualify for the Super Six stage, becoming the first non-test nation to progress beyond the first round of the World Cup. In the Super Six stage, they lost to India and Australia, but beat Zimbabwe by seven wickets, qualifying for the semi-final, where they lost to India by 91 runs.

Kenya&#x27;s World Cup success was rewarded with a spot in a quadrangular tournament at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium against Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, but they lost all three of their games.

Kenya&#x27;s failure in the above tournament is perhaps indicative of how they failed to capitalise on their World Cup success, though it must be said that not all of that failure was on the field. Although Kenya were given plenty of matches against national A sides, and played in the Carib Beer Cup in the West Indies in 2004, Kenya only played two ODIs in the three years after the Sharjah tournament, against India and Pakistan in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy.

Off-field setbacks also occurred. Maurice Odumbe was banned for match-fixing in August 2004, and a series of strikes by players led to a weakened Kenyan side being eliminated from the inaugural ICC Intercontinental Cup at the semi-final stage by Scotland. By the end of the dispute in 2005, Kenyan cricket had no sponsors and was in virtual international isolation. At that stage the governing body had dissolved internally and Kenyan cricket opportunities were limited and international cricket for them had virtually ceased.

===Rebuilding===
====2005 to 2007====
A rebuilding process began in 2005. The player strikes ceased, and Kenya again reached the semi-finals of the Intercontinental Cup. They warmed up for the semi-finals in Windhoek with a tour of Zimbabwe, to play two first-class and one one-day match against Zimbabwe A. They won all three of those games, and drew against Bermuda in the semi-final of the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup but lost to Ireland in the final, despite scoring 404/4 in their first innings.

In early 2006, the Kenya Cricket Association was disbanded and replaced by Cricket Kenya. The rebuilding process was in full swing as Kenya began playing ODI cricket again. Their return to ODI cricket was a five match series against Zimbabwe, which was drawn 2–2 with one match abandoned. This was followed by a four match ODI series against Bangladesh, with Kenya losing all four matches in that series. Their 2006 ICC Intercontinental Cup campaign got off to a poor start with a draw against the Netherlands and a defeat to Canada, but they bounced right back with two ODI wins over Canada at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club. Bangladesh toured Kenya in August, winning all three ODIs, before an Intercontinental Cup draw against Bermuda and three ODI wins over Bermuda.

A triangular tournament in Mombasa against Canada and Scotland began Kenya&#x27;s 2007 and Kenya won the tournament. They then hosted Division One of the World Cricket League at three grounds in Nairobi, playing against Bermuda, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands and Scotland. Kenya also won this event, beating Scotland in the final. This was followed by the 2007 World Cup, Kenya&#x27;s fourth World Cup. Kenya beat Canada in the first round, but lost to England and New Zealand, thus missing out on the Super Eight stage.

In October 2007, either side of Intercontinental Cup games, Kenya hosted Canada in two ODIs and then Bermuda in three. Kenya won all five matches, with strong bowling performances setting up relatively comfortable chases batting second.

====2008 to 2011====
In August 2008, after a break of nine months without a One Day or Twenty20 International, Kenya toured Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands for various series. It proved a disappointing tour overall, with rain and poor Kenyan batting performances being the main themes.

Kenya initially participated in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in Belfast, Northern Ireland,
the associate qualification tournament for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. One of the favourites at the start of the tournament, they finished second in Group B with a loss to the Netherlands and a win over Canada, but losses to Ireland and Scotland in the knock-out stages meant that they finished fourth and thus failed to qualify for the World Twenty20.

Kenya then participated in three ODI series across Europe, but these merely resulted in two wash-outs against Scotland, defeat in a rain-affected one-off match to the Netherlands, and losing a three-match series against Ireland 1–0 with two matches affected by rain.

In October 2008, Kenya hosted Ireland and Zimbabwe in an ODI series in Nairobi, but after a loss to Ireland and a win over Zimbabwe, their last three matches were all abandoned due to rain. After this washed-out series, Kenya then travelled to South Africa for two ODIs, losing heavily in both.

In late January and early February 2009, Kenya played five ODIs at home against Zimbabwe, but lost all of them.

Since the World Cup, a team known as Kenya Select has taken part in Zimbabwe&#x27;s Logan Cup competition, but did not win a game, also losing to Zimbabwe A.

In their opening match of World Cup 2011 campaign, Kenya faced a mammoth defeat from New Zealand by 10 wickets, they were bowled out for 69 runs and New Zealand won the match in just 8 overs without the loss of a wicket.

In 2011, Kenya was whitewashed by the Netherlands national cricket team in a short 2 match ODI series played in Sportspark Westvielt, Voorburg. During this series, Kenya&#x27;s weak batting was noted. They made only 208/8 in the first match and an even smaller 184/8 in the second match. Seren Waters and Collins Obuya (the national team captain) did, however, have notable performances – the former making 71 in the first match and the latter scoring 54 in the second match.

====Reforms in 2011====
For years, the Kenyan players had been the Associate nations&#x27; most pampered professionals. The first time Cricket Kenya&#x27;s notice was attracted was when during the 2011 ODI World Cup, there were reports of internal dissent between the team, as the team had a disastrous World Cup, losing all six of their games. Cricket Kenya announced that it would review the World Cup debacle after the tournament was over. This was the beginning of a series of reforms initiated by the board.

Following the reviews, the board replaced the former Sahara Elite League with the East African tournaments. While the East Africa Premier League is a Twenty20 tournament, the East African Cup is a 50-over tournament. It is currently hoped that this tournaments will produce further new young talents for Kenya in the future. Within months, the East African tournaments were regarded in high esteem and the intensity was up to the brink, as an ESPNcricinfo interview with Cricket Kenya CEO Tom Sears revealed.

Another important reform brought in by the board was to dump the old guard. As described by Cricinfo journalist Martin Williamson, the old guard was not committed to performance and was more keen to selfish gains. The new contracts had completely cut ties with the past, with Collins Obuya, the new captain, being the oldest player at 29. Experienced players like the former captain Jimmy Kamande, a veteran of five World Cups, Thomas Odoyo, and others were not even considered. As was expected, the left-out players were quick to retort as Kamande said that &quot;the board was selecting players who would be their puppets&quot;, while Odoyo opined that &quot;it was malicious and not done in good faith&quot;. According to them, it was fast-tracking the death of Kenyan cricket. They were also supported by the Kenyan media.

Among the 20 cricketers offered contracts, 13 of them were offered central contracts. To complicate things further, five players turned down those contracts: Alex Obanda, Shem Ngoche, James Ngoche, Nehemiah Odhiambo, and Elijah Otieno. Sears said that they were pleased with the group of seven players who committed to Cricket Kenya, while equally disappointed with those who refused contracts. Accordingly, they were left out of the squad to face the UAE in the ICC Intercontinental Cup.

Cricket Kenya offered contracts to more deserving young, talented players, such as opening batsman Runish Gudhka from Nairobi, the Australian-born all-rounder Duncan Allan, wicketkeeper Irfan Karim, and impressive fast bowlers such as Emmanuel Ringera, Ibrahim Akello, and Dominic Wesonga, who had performed exceedingly well in the regional NPCA and East African leagues.

However, the eight players who had refused the contracts offered by the board, with former skipper Morris Ouma, Alfred Luseno and Nelson Odhiambo being late inclusions, asked their views to be heard, and despite the board granting them another chance, they finally took a firm stance against them. While Obanda, Shem and James Ngoche, Odhiambo, and Otieno were made renewed offers, while Ouma, Luseno, and Nelson had a three-month agreement till March 2012 subject to performance. If they could do something good, they could retain their spot in the team. Sears said of this debacle,&quot;It&#x27;s a shame that yet again some of these players have turned down their contracts but that is their choice. We met with these players as we promised we would, we listened to their views and made them offers that reflected what they wanted – an agreement that would run until the end of the contract year in May 2012 if they met certain performance criteria which all players have to meet. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was that they refused to represent their teams in the East African Competitions last weekend pulling out at the very last minute. Again sadly it calls into question the professionalism of these players, how committed they are to putting in the effort, their application in fulfilling their potential and the advice they have been getting from their advisors.&quot;

Another reform was to appoint the former Otago coach Mike Hesson as the national coach. Immediately afterwards, Hesson announced that he was here to resolve and put to end the dispute between the players and the board. He said that in an interview to the newspaper Otago Daily Times.

The East Africa finals were rescheduled from October to December 2011 due to heavy showers in Nairobi at that time. However, once again, heavy showers in December led the finals again being postponed to January 2012.

===Loss of ODI status: 2014–present===

Kenya lost their ODI status after 18 years when they finished outside the top 4 in the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier also failing to qualify for the 2015 Cricket World Cup.

Further failures in the World Cricket League meant that Kenya couldn&#x27;t regain their ODI status while being subsequently relegated to the new Challenge League.

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 cricket matches played between Kenya and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have been full T20I matches.

==Recent Developments==
The Kenyan cricket team reached the final stage of the Africa Qualifier for the 2024 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup but narrowly missed out on qualification. In an effort to strengthen their performance and strategy, Cricket Kenya appointed former Indian cricketer Dodda Ganesh as the new head coach, bringing in his extensive experience to guide the team in future competitions.

From October 19th to 24th, 2024, Cricket Kenya proudly hosted the ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup Africa Sub-Regional Qualifier B in Nairobi. The tournament featured five African teams—Mozambique, Rwanda, Gambia, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles—who joined Kenya in this crucial pathway event. This qualifier served as a stepping stone for teams vying for a spot in the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, set to take place in India and Sri Lanka.

Kenya showcased a strong performance throughout the Sub-Regional Qualifier B, securing victories that allowed them to advance alongside Zimbabwe to the next stage. Both teams earned places in the Regional Qualifier, bringing them closer to their goal of competing on the global stage in 2026.

<text>The Ancient and Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus (ECV) is a fraternal organization dedicated to the preservation of the heritage of the Western United States, especially the history of the Mother Lode and gold mining regions of the area. There are chapters in California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Montana and Wyoming. Members call themselves &quot;Clampers.&quot; The organization&#x27;s name is in Dog Latin, and has no known meaning; even the spelling is disputed, sometimes appearing as &quot;Clampus,&quot; &quot;Clampsus,&quot; or &quot;Clampsis.&quot; The motto of the Order, &quot;Credo quia absurdum&quot;, generally interpreted as meaning &quot;I believe it because it is absurd;&quot; is a Latin phrase popularly misattributed to Tertullian.

==History==

=== First incarnation ===

Members claim that the organization was brought from the Qing Dynasty in China to the United States in 1845 in Lewisport, Virginia, now West Union, West Virginia, when inn and stable owner Ephraim Bee was given a commission from the Emperor of China to &quot;extend the work and influence of the Ancient and Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus.&quot;

Bee claimed to have received his commission from Caleb Cushing, the American Commissioner to China. A monument to Bee in West Union now stands on the site of the old &quot;Beehive&quot; Inn along the North Bend Rail-Trail; the original &quot;Bee Hive&quot; was destroyed in a flood in the late 1800s.

At the age of 60, Bee was a Captain of the Doddridge County Militia, which protected the area from roving Confederate forces, horse thieves and outlaws. The Militia also had a part in the Underground Railroad in Doddridge County, hiding escaping slaves in hidden cellars of homes and also in Jaco Cave. Ephraim Bee II played his greatest joke on his local West Virginian neighbors. Occasionally, the entire town was invited to a great party. After the Civil War, it was discovered that Jaco Cave was a holding area for the runaway slaves. When the cave was full, Bee gave a party to keep all busy while that group of people was moved further north to the next stop.

The original purpose of the order appears to have been to initiate new members. When a stranger came to town, Clampers would inform him that to do business in the town it was essential to join the local secret society. The initiation rite was a parody of Freemasonic, Oddfellow and other orders, and took many forms, including rowing the initiate down a slanted ladder in a wheelbarrow, hoisting him into the air and leaving him there, or dropping him into a vat of water. Afterwards, the initiate had to buy the other members a round of drinks.

Bee felt that an organization was needed that was less exclusive than the other organizations of the day, such as the Masons, Elks and Odd Fellows. In addition, nativism was rising in the United States, as evidenced by such political organizations as the Know-Nothing Party. Bee opened membership in ECV to any &quot;upstanding&quot; man who had come of age. There were E Clampus Vitus chapters in Bedford, Pennsylvania; Metropolis, Illinois; Bowling Green, Missouri; and Dahlonega, Georgia. (It has been rumored that ECV brethren within the U.S. Army even attempted to bring the order as far south as Mexico City following the Mexican–American War, as a gesture of brotherhood and reconciliation, but all record has vanished of the well-intentioned Chapultepec chapter.)

The organization&#x27;s leader was known as the Noble Grand Humbug, a title carried over into the later incarnation, and other &quot;officials&quot; included the Clampatriarch. Ephraim Bee, an early leader of the group, was styled Grand Gyascutis and later the Grand Lama. A move to greater seriousness was shown during the Civil War, when the Order changed its parade day from the first Sunday after the snows to the Fourth of July.

The history of E Clampus Vitus is steeped in mythology.

The early history of the organization is unclear. Historian Lois Rather suggests that the order originally came from the Southern states before being carried to California during the Gold Rush. The Sons of Malta, a fraternal society given to pranks and parody initiation rites, has been cited as an influence, even though the Sons of Malta do not seem to have existed until 1854 (though ECV may have inspired the Sons of Malta, as there were many disappointed by the California gold rush who returned East). Others maintain that the group is a native Californian institution, founded by one Joel Henry Zumwalt in Mokelumne Hill. Both legend and scholars agree that the group was founded in West Union, Virginia (now West Virginia) in 1845.

The organization is said to have been brought to California by a pioneer named Joel Henry Zumwalt, who encountered it in Missouri. Zumwalt organized an ECV lodge in Mokelumne Hill in 1851, when Mokelumne Hill Lodge No. 1001 was established. There are arguments that previous lodges had been founded in Hangtown, Downieville and Sierra City, but not all of those became permanent. Downieville ECV 1849 is still active.

ECV flourished, in part, as the result of the miners&#x27; reaction to the &quot;established&quot; organizations such as the Masons and Odd Fellows. Those groups had come to the mining country prior to ECV, and when ECV appeared, the older, more established groups looked down upon the more rowdy nature of E Clampsus Vitus. ECV, on the other hand, made fun of the stuffed shirts of the Masons: they made great fun of the sashes and ceremonial attire of the &quot;upscale&quot; fraternities, and began dressing in red shirts and pinning on badges made of cut-out tin can lids. This practice, called &quot;wearing the tin&quot;, continues to this day, although the badges are frequently professionally made. Members commonly dress in a red shirt, black hat and Levi&#x27;s jeans. ECV titles reflected the tongue-in-cheek nature of the organization. Officials were called &quot;Noble Grand Humbug,&quot; &quot;Roisterous Iscutis,&quot; &quot;Grand Imperturbable Hangman,&quot; &quot;Clamps Vitrix,&quot; and &quot;Royal Gyascutis.&quot; All members are officers and all officers, the organization professes, are of equal indignity.

&quot;Clamper&quot; meetings were held in the Hall of Comparative Ovations, generally the back room of a saloon. Some chapters built or rented their own Hall of Comparative Ovations. One still stands in Murphys. Lodge meetings might be held twice a week, or weekly. Others met monthly, &quot;before or after the full moon&quot; or irregularly - &quot;on the first Saturday before the next rain&quot;. Uninitiated men desiring to join were called &quot;Poor Blind Candidates.&quot; They were required to present a poke of gold dust, although the value of the poke was left to the discretion of the brotherhood, and was frequently waived entirely if the prospective member could not afford it.

The Clamper flag was sometimes a hoop skirt, with the words &quot;This is the flag we fight under.&quot; Despite the humor and rowdiness of E Clampus Vitus, the members did take their brotherhood seriously. When a member became sick or injured, the group would collect food or money to help him. They frequently trekked through the vastness of the Sierra Nevada to reach lonely miners who otherwise would have had no Christmas celebration. The society was also careful to assist the widows and orphans of fallen members.
At the ECV&#x27;s peak, around 1870, so many miners were members that mining camps might shut down during ECV celebrations (some mining towns had two chapters).

In late December 1895-January 1896, a British expatriate, Lord Sholto George Douglas (7 June 1872 - 6 April 1942), the fourth son of John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry, was managing a travelling troupe of actors on a tour of Northern California. The company&#x27;s performances of &quot;Confusion&quot; (an 1883 &quot;Splendid Comedy in Three Full Acts of Fun&quot; by Joseph Derrick) began at Santa Rosa Athenaeum Christmas week, but performances had some very slim attendances; so the troupe “were [financially] up against it” when they came to Marysville. Ticket sales at the Marysville Theater were also weak, leaving manager Douglas short of funds and the Company&#x27;s future in doubt. When the local LeBroke lodge of ECV became aware of his predicament, Lord Douglas was proffered and accepted an opportunity to join the Order. He was initiated into ECV in Turner Hall on January 21, 1896. Per pg. 3 of the San Francisco Call of January 23, 1896: &quot;The lodge proposed that he stay over with his company until to-night (Weds. Jan 22nd 1896) and promised a big house. He (Sholto) agreed, and tonight the opera-house was packed.&quot; Cl

With the support of his new Brothers, the tour of the &quot;Lord Sholto Douglas Company&quot; resumed. A 20th century chapter of the ECV was named for Lord Sholto Douglas in honor of this event.

Mark Twain was a member, and it was while attending an ECV meeting that he heard the story which he wrote as &quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County&quot;.

===Reestablishment===

The original E Clampus Vitus faded in some regions after the Civil War, while in other areas it thrived until 1918. A &quot;second era&quot; version of the organization was formed in 1930 by San Franciscan attorney and cartographic historian Carl Irving Wheat. The new incarnation of ECV was somewhat more serious than its predecessor, as a historical society as well as a mirth making club. ECV historical plaques are found on many buildings around California.

The drinking and revelry aspects were not entirely abandoned however, with one man accidentally shot dead during a drunken party in Columbia in 1967.

As the mining industry faded towards the end of the 19th century, ECV started to fade as well. It was revitalized in 1931 by Wheat and his friends G. Ezra Dane and Leon O. Whitsell. They were contacted by Adam Lee Moore, one of the surviving leaders of the original ECV, who passed on all that he could remember of the organization&#x27;s rites and legends. The three founded a new chapter, Yerba Buena Number 1, or the &quot;Capitulus Redivivus.&quot; Wheat described E Clampus Vitus as &quot;the comic strip on the page of California history.&quot;

New chapters sprang up in Los Angeles (Platrix Chapter #2) and other major cities in California, and were numbered sequentially. However, once Lodge 10 was established in 1936, members pointed out that it was illogical for such a rowdy organization to be so neat in its numbering scheme, and so some creativity was developed in the numbering. The &quot;Pair-o-Dice&quot; chapter in Paradise, for example, is Lodge No. 7-11. The de la Guerra y Pacheco chapter, halfway between Lodge Number 1 in San Francisco and Lodge Number 2 in Los Angeles, is Lodge Number 1.5. There were chapters in British Columbia and Hawaii, but they no longer exist.

In 1936, a plaque appeared in Northern California purporting to have been made by Sir Francis Drake during his voyage of discovery in which it was stated that he had claimed all of California for England, and that he had the authority of the claim by having been ceded the land by the local Miwok Indians. The man who was chief of the Miwoks in 1937, William Fuller, was a member of E Clampus Vitus. During an ECV meeting, he revoked the cession of land to England, and ceded it all to the United States government. The so-called Drake&#x27;s Plate of Brass was accepted as authentic for forty years, yet was in actuality a hoax initiated by Dane that got out of control. It is now thought that the Fuller ceremony was part of an effort for the perpetrators to tip off the plate&#x27;s finders as to its true origins.

==The current ECV==


In 1991 there were 50,000 Clampers in 62 lodges.

==Notable members==

Notable clamper members include:

* Ephraim Bee (1802–1888)
* George Derby (1823–1861)
* Pete Goicoechea (b. 1949)
* Hans Halberstadt (b. 1944) 
* Harry Love (lawman) (1810–1868)
* Don Meadows (1897–1994)
* Alexander Howison Murray Jr. (1907–1993)
* Lloyd Raffetto (1897–1988)
* Archie Stevenot (1882–1968) 
* Carl Irving Wheat (1892–1966)
* Charles Lewis Camp (palaeontologist, zoologist and historian) (1893–1975)

ECV claims many men of note to have been members, whether they were members or not: Philip D. Armour, the meat packer; John Mohler Studebaker, the automobile manufacturer; Gene Autry &quot;The Singing Cowboy&quot; who owned the California Angels baseball team; and John Hume, a California state assemblyman. ECV also claims Ulysses S. Grant, Lord Sholto Douglas, J. Pierpont Morgan, Horace Greeley, and Horatio Alger as members, but claims have also been made to Adam (the first &quot;Clampatriarch&quot;), Solomon, Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar, Henry VIII of England, Sir Francis Drake, George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Ronald Reagan, and His Imperial Majesty Joshua A. Norton, &quot;Emperor of these United States and Protector of Mexico&quot;. These fanciful claims show ECV&#x27;s propensity for not taking much of anything particularly seriously, least of all itself.

Certain circumstances support an ECV claim to having initiated Ulysses S. Grant into the Order. One of the early capitals of California was Benicia. At the close of the War with Mexico, Lt. William Tecumseh Sherman was Adjutant to Col. Richard Barnes Mason at the time of the gold discovery at Sutter&#x27;s Mill. Upon Sherman&#x27;s retirement in 1853, his replacement at the Benicia Arsenal was Lt. Ulysses S. Grant, who spent 30 days in the Arsenal Guardhouse for being drunk on duty and firing his cannons at the Martinez shoreline. Considering Benicia&#x27;s position as the major inland Army post and transport hub to the valley, both Grant&#x27;s and the Brotherhood&#x27;s affinity for strong drink and the early spread of the Brotherhood through Northern California, it is entirely possible that Grant was inducted into the Organization.

<text>The Chouinard Art Institute was a professional art school founded in 1921 by Nelbert Murphy Chouinard (1879–1969) in the Westlake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. In 1961, Walt and Roy Disney guided the merger of the Chouinard Art Institute and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music to establish the California Institute of the Arts. Chouinard continued to operate until the new campus opened in 1970.

==History==
Founded by artist and educator Nelbert Murphy Chouinard in 1921 with the goal of creating a renowned art school on the West Coast, the school grew during the subsequent decades and in 1935 it was recognized by the California state government as a non-profit educational facility. In 1929, Walt Disney began driving his inexperienced animators to the school for Friday night classes, a tradition that would continue for many years. Several years later Disney hired a Chouinard teacher named Donald Graham to teach more formal classes on studio property. Chouinard would later be used by Disney as a breeding ground for artists for &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. In the early 1950s Mrs. Chouinard had a stroke and could not run the school; in gratitude for letting his animators study there, Walt Disney supported the school financially and took over administrative duties. He also attempted to expand the school into what he called a &quot;City of the Arts&quot;. This eventually led to the merger of Chouinard and Los Angeles Conservatory of Music into the California Institute of the Arts in 1961. Chouinard officially closed when its successor began operations in 1970.

==Legacy==
The Chouinard Art Institute building is situated at 743 Grand View Street in the Westlake district of central Los Angeles. Today it is used by the Western Day Care School, a child-care center.

Dave Tourjé, who became fascinated by the institute&#x27;s history after buying and restoring Nelbert Chouinard&#x27;s 1907 home in South Pasadena, California, helped to establish the Chouinard Foundation, which produced a 2001 retrospective exhibition and gave art classes, first in its own building and then under contract with the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. Since 2009, when funding for the art classes ran out, Tourje has focused on keeping the Chouinard name alive, including a Chouinard Foundation website with archival material.

Produced and directed by Gianina Ferreyra in 2013, the 51-minute documentary film &quot;Curly&quot; addresses the school&#x27;s history from 1921 to 1972, including interviews with artists Larry Bell, Laddie John Dill, Llyn Foulkes, Joe Goode, Ed Ruscha, and Peter Shire, among others.

<doc id="1051036" wikidata="Q946077" url="?curid=1051036" title="Northern Indo-Aryan languages">
<text>The Northern Indo-Aryan languages, also known as Pahāṛi languages, are a proposed group of Indo-Aryan languages spoken in the lower ranges of the Himalayas, from Nepal in the east, through the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab (not to be confused with the various other languages with that name) was coined by G. A. Grierson.

==Classification==
The Pahari languages fall into three groups.

===Eastern Pahari===
*Nepali is spoken by an estimated 29,100,000 people in Nepal, 265,000 people in Bhutan, and 2,500,000 people in India. It is an official language in Nepal and India.
*Jumli is spoken by an estimated 40,000 people in the Karnali zone of Nepal.
*Doteli spoken by an estimated 1 million people in far west Nepal.
===Central Pahari===
*Kumaoni is spoken by an estimated 2,360,000 people in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand.
*Garhwali is spoken by an estimated 2,900,000 people in Uttarakhand. Most of these are Garhwali people from the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand.

===Western Pahari===

*Jaunsari
*Nuclear Himachali:
**Hinduri
**Pahari Kinnauri
**Kullu Pahari
**Mahasu Pahari
**Sirmauri
*Mandeali
*Kangric-Chamealic-Bhattiyali:
**Chamealic:
***Bhadarwahi
***Churahi
***Bhattiyali
***Bilaspuri
***Chambeali
***Gaddi
***Pangwali
**Kangri-Dogri:
***Dogri
***Kangri

==Comparison==

In Eastern and Central Pahari the verb substantive is formed from the root &quot;ach&quot;, as in both Rajasthani and Kashmiri. In Rajasthani its present tense, being derived from the Sanskrit present &quot;rcchami&quot;, I go, does not change for gender. But in Pahari and Kashmiri it must be derived from the rare Sanskrit particle &quot;*rcchitas&quot;, gone, for in these languages it is a participial tense and does change according to the gender of the subject. Thus, in the singular we have: – Here we have a relic of the old Khasa language, which, as has been said, seems to have been related to Kashmiri. Other relics of Khasa, again agreeing with north-western India, are the tendency to shorten long vowels, the practice of &quot;epenthesis&quot;, or the modification of a vowel by the one which follows in the next syllable, and the frequent occurrence of disaspiration. Thus, Khas &quot;siknu&quot;, Kumauni &quot;sikno&quot;, but Hindi &quot;sikhna&quot;, to learn; Kumauni &quot;yeso&quot;, plural &quot;yasa&quot;, of this kind.

Materials regarding Western Pahari are not so complete. The speakers are not brought into contact with Tibeto-Burman languages, and hence we find no trace of these. But the signs of the influence of north-western languages are, as might be expected, still more apparent than farther east. In some dialects epenthesis is in full swing, as in (Churahi) &quot;khata&quot;, eating, fern, &quot;khaiti&quot;. Very interesting is the mixed origin of the postpositions defining the various cases. Thus, while that of the genitive is generally the Rajasthani ro, that of the dative continually points to the west. Sometimes it is the Sindhi &quot;khë&quot;. At other times it is &quot;jo&quot;, where is here a locative of the base of the Sindhi genitive postposition &quot;jo&quot;. In all Indo-Aryan languages, the dative postposition is by origin the locative of some genitive one. In vocabulary, Western Pahari often employs, for the more common ideas, words which can most readily be connected with the north-western and Pisaca groups.

==About==
The Himalayas run along Nepal, India and Pakistan. The word &#x27;Pahad&#x27; means a &#x27;mountain&#x27; in most local languages such as Nepalese, Hindi (Parbat being a synonym) as well as Urdu (Koh being a synonym). Due to its mass prevalence and usage in the Himalayan Region, the language is also known as Himalayan. Like all other languages of the region, the Pahari languages are also from the Indo-European, and in particular Indo-Iranian branch of languages. As mountains have the tendency of isolating communities from change, dialects in the mountains tend to have their own characteristics with some similarity to others mountain dialects while remaining isolated from one another – there does seem to be a dialect continuum. All of these dialects are commonly referred to as the &#x27;Pahari&#x27; languages, and most people from the Himalayan range are known as Paharis.

<doc id="1051050" wikidata="Q17131033" url="?curid=1051050" title="Windsport">
<text>A windsport is any type of sport which involves wind-power, often involving a non-rigid airfoil such as a sail or a power kite. The activities can be land-based, on snow, on ice or on water. Windsport activity may be regulated in some countries by aviation/maritime authorities if they are likely to interfere with other activities. Local authorities may also regulate activity in certain areas, especially on crowded beaches and parks.

*Ice boating - using a masted sail attached to a vessel with skates
*Kite boating - sailing a boat in displacement or planing mode using a kite
*Kite landboarding - using a power kite with a wheeled board while standing
*Kite buggy - using a wheeled buggy with seats attached to a power kite
*Kite flying - flight of a small airfoil by a standing ground operator using 1-4 flying lines
*Kite skating - as for kite jumping but while using specialized skates
*Kite surfing - using a surfboard attached to a power kite
*Land sailing - a masted sail attached to a land vehicle - see also land yacht
*Sailing - navigating a boat with sail attached to a mast
*Snowkiting - skiing/snowboarding under the power of a kite
*Windsurfing - sailing using a masted sail attached via a gimbal to a surfboard
*Wing foiling or wingsurfing is a surface watersport where a rider uses a lightweight wing on a surf board with a hydrofoil.

==Air sports==
The following air sports are not classed as windsports because in these the participants actually leave the ground for long periods and many do not use the wind:
*Gliding - use of vertically moving air to keep an aircraft aloft
*Hang gliding - use of vertically moving air to keep aloft an aircraft with a flexible wing
*Microlighting - flying a hang glider with an engine (also see ultralight aircraft)
*Parachuting (skydiving) and base jumping - controlled descent of the operator under a large flexible canopy
*Paragliding - soaring under a parachute canopy
*Parasailing - hanging under a paraglider towed by a vehicle (boat, car, or snowmobile) in order to ascend (usually over water)
*Hot air ballooning - a balloon you ride which uses fire to go up and wind to stay afloat
*Paramotoring - a motor vehicle attached with a parachute which can hang into the air for hours and can also be used as a vehicle to cross countries or jumping to an island. It is self-controllable, and you may need the permission of the local government to fly over an area.</text><links>

<text>Mills &amp; Boon is a romance imprint of British publisher Harlequin UK Ltd. It was founded in 1908 by Gerald Rusgrove Mills and Charles Boon as a general publisher. The company moved towards escapist fiction for women in the 1930s. In 1971, the publisher was bought by the Canadian company Harlequin Enterprises, its North American distributor based in Toronto, with whom it had a long informal partnership. The two companies offer a number of imprints that between them account for almost three-quarters of the romance paperbacks published in Britain. Its print books are presently out-numbered and out-sold by the company&#x27;s e-books, which allowed the publisher to double its output.

Modern Mills &amp; Boon novels, over 100 of which are released each month, cover a wide range of possible romantic subgenres, varying in explicitness, setting and style, although retaining a comforting familiarity that meets reader expectations.

==History==

Mills &amp; Boon was founded by former employees of the Methuen publishing house, Gerald Rusgrove Mills (3 January 1877 – 23 September 1928) and Charles Boon (9 May 1877 – 2 December 1943) in 1908 as a general fiction publisher, although their first book was a romance. An early signing was the mystery and crime writer Victor Bridges. Mills &amp; Boon also published—in 1911 and 1912—two early works by Hugh Walpole, including &quot;Mr Perrin and Mr Traill&quot;, which was later adapted into the film of the same name. Between 1912 and 1923, it published numerous adventure titles by Jack London. In its early years the company also published &quot;educational textbooks, socialist tracts and Shakespeare&quot; as well as &quot;travel guides, children’s and craft books&quot;.

It was not until the 1930s that the company began to concentrate specifically on romances.

From the very beginning, Mills &amp; Boon published in a form and at a price that was within the reach of a wide readership. In the 1930s the company noted the rapid rise of commercial circulating libraries and the growing appetite for escapism during the Depression years. Due to these type of libraries, Mills &amp; Boon were able to produce over 160 titles every year during that decade. Historian Ross McKibbin has argued that &#x27;it was the rapid growth of the ‘tuppenny libraries’ in the interwar years which transformed Mills and Boon into a firm which exclusively published romantic fiction.&#x27; The favourite genre was romance and the company decided to concentrate on hardback romances, a policy which became increasingly successful. These titles were initially sold through weekly, two-penny libraries. There, they became known as &#x27;the brown books&#x27;, because of their distinctive binding.

Mills &amp; Boon&#x27;s innovative marketing strategies also contributed to their novels&#x27; popularity. Since 1930, this was evident when the company sent a copy of a chapter of one of their books to whoever formally requested one. Furthermore, the company&#x27;s innovative marketing extended to creating eye-catching covers, with attention-grabbing colours and &quot;and romantic images of couples or the beautiful heroine&quot;, to display in store windows.

During World War II, Mills &amp; Boon created ads that notified the public that they could go to their bookseller and place a standing order on any of their books. This guaranteed that Mills &amp; Boons would always keep their novels in stock in bookstores, despite the shortages and other challenges to businesses that resulted from the war. This marketing technique also created a sense of urgency, due to an implication that there was a limited supply for whoever didn&#x27;t place a standing order. These ads significantly contributed to the company&#x27;s expansion.

With the decline of commercial lending libraries in the late 1950s, the company&#x27;s most profitable move was to realise that there would remain a strong market for romance novels, but that sales would depend on readers having easy access to reasonably priced books. As a result, Mills &amp; Boon romance became widely available from newsagents across the country. Mills &amp; Boon began to publish in paperback in the 1960s.

Beginning in 1958, they made an agreement with Harlequin in Canada to sell reprints of Mills &amp; Boon titles, giving the firm access to the North American market and to make a major move into paperback publishing.

In 1971, the Boon family sold the company to Harlequin Enterprises of Canada. Harlequin, having made a great success out of selling licensed Mills &amp; Boon titles in North America, wanted to secure the editorial source. John Boon, son of the co-founder, continued as head of the company while his brother, Alan, continued as head of editorial. Much of the company&#x27;s success from the 1950s to the 1980s is credited to Alan Boon&#x27;s editorial talent.

A considerable portion of Mills &amp; Boon sales were derived from export markets, particularly India, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines. In 1976, an Australian office was established in Sydney to handle sales in the Asia-Pacific region. The success of the Australian operation in the 1970s was such that it was able to begin printing its own editions.

In 1989, Mills &amp; Boon product sampled over 700,000 of their novels to East German women following the Fall of the Berlin Wall. This giveaway led to the novels&#x27; popularity in eastern Germany. Within four months of that product sampling event, Mills &amp; Boon&#x27;s books were sold on newsstands throughout the region; in 2 years they &quot;gained market share in Poland, sold six-and-a-half million romance novels in Hungary, and achieved $10 million in sales in the Czech Republic.&quot;

Their books are sold through a combination of subscription and retail sales. For example, in any given month they publish eight novels in their Modern line; six of those are available on the retail market, and all eight are available to buy directly from the company both on- and offline. Mills &amp; Boon encourage readers to subscribe to their favorite lines, and those books will then be delivered to their home.

One distinctive feature of both Mills &amp; Boon and Harlequin (in North America) is the length of time their books are available to buy. They publish a set number of books each month which are sent to subscribers and displayed on stands in book shops. At the end of the month, any unsold copies in the shops are withdrawn and pulped. Titles are available to buy direct from Mills &amp; Boon for 3 months or until they are sold out, whichever is sooner. Fans looking for particular books after this time must find them second-hand.

Mills &amp; Boon has over 3 million regular readers in the UK annually. Romantic fiction constitutes the largest section of the adult paperback fiction market and Harlequin Mills &amp; Boon publishes series fiction, promotional titles, gift packs and single titles under different brands and imprints: Mills &amp; Boon and Mira.

As of 2008, 200 million Mills &amp; Boon novels were sold globally per annum and, in the United Kingdom, one paperback was sold on average every 6.6 seconds. Mills &amp; Boon accounted for nearly three-quarters of the British romantic fiction market in that year.

Outside the UK, Mills &amp; Boon novels were officially launched in India in 2008, although they were already popular in the country due to unofficial imports and purchases from abroad. Sales swiftly increased, doubling over the 2009–2010 period.

According to Mills &amp; Boon, an author can receive royalties of between £2,000 to £30,000 per book.

===Centenary year===
2008 was Mills &amp; Boon&#x27;s centenary as a publisher. This was marked by a number of events and exhibitions. In November 2008, BBC Four celebrated the anniversary by broadcasting the 90-minute drama &quot;Consuming Passion: 100 Years of Mills &amp; Boon&quot;, written by Emma Frost.

===Electronic publishing===
Electronic publishing has allowed Mills &amp; Boon to double its output. As of 2012, it now releases over 100 e-books per month, more than in print, and sells more e-books than physical books. Parent company Torstar cited the strong growth of e-books in its 2010 report, with digital revenues up CAN$16.1 Million.

According to Tim Cooper, digital and marketing director for the publisher, &quot;digital lends itself to the habitual nature of our content. Our readers finish reading one and they can download the next.&quot; Author Sharon Kendrick&#x27;s opinion is similar: &quot;[Mills &amp; Boon] are an intense reading experience, and they can be read quickly. People read four to five in a few days so that&#x27;s a lot of books to carry around.&quot;

Another factor in favour of electronic publishing is the lack of a visible cover. Cooper notes that &quot;part of the appeal of digital reading is that nobody necessarily knows what you&#x27;re reading.&quot; Kendrick supports this view as well, saying, &quot;one of the things about reading romance is that slightly furtive thing, the &#x27;oh God, I can&#x27;t be seen on the train reading a romance&#x27;. If you&#x27;ve got a Kindle then no one knows what you&#x27;re reading. It&#x27;s not about embarrassment, really—it&#x27;s more that you don&#x27;t want to be judged, and we are often judged by what we read.&quot;

The more sexually explicit &quot;Spice&quot; imprint sells particularly well in electronic format, compared to the &quot;Modern&quot; imprint which is the most successful in print.

==Critical opinion==
The company has been criticised for repeating plots, the inevitability of their happy endings, and a simple writing style, whereas fans cite predictability as a key reason for reading.

While there is no template or standard outline and authors are allowed full artistic freedom, there are, however, genre conventions that need to be met to be successful. Penny Jordan, an author writing for Mills &amp; Boon, has stated that &quot;[the rules] are not written down, but if you diverge from reader expectations, they won&#x27;t read your second book.&quot;

In popular imagination and feminist criticism, the heroine of a stereotypical Mills &amp; Boon novel is often seen as a passive virgin who is submissive to the hero in every way. This was often true in older novels but changed over the years; modern novels feature more active protagonists. Mills &amp; Boon heroines cover a wide variety of types, often depending on the author&#x27;s preference. Romantic encounters were embodied in a principle of sexual purity that demonstrated not only social conservatism, but also how heroines could control their personal autonomy.

The attributes of the heroes of Mills &amp; Boon novels have not significantly changed over time, however, almost always being a dominant alpha male. Joanna Bowring, co-curator of the Mills &amp; Boon centenary exhibition at Manchester Central Library in 2008, notes that &quot;there&#x27;s always been a subtle undercurrent of force throughout the books and that&#x27;s never changed from the earliest ones. Even later, when other aspects are influenced by feminism and the shifting attitudes outside the novel, the men are masterful and stern.&quot; In 1966, the Mills &amp; Boon author Hilary Wilde said &quot;The odd thing is that if I met one of my heroes, I would probably bash him over the head with an empty whisky bottle. It is a type I loathe and detest. I imagine in all women, deep down inside us, is a primitive desire to be arrogantly bullied.&quot; Many critics point to the comments by another of Mills &amp; Boon&#x27;s writers, Violet Winspear, in 1970, that all her heroes &quot;must frighten and fascinate. They must be the sort of men who are capable of rape&quot;. Bindel argues that, as heroines have acquired greater agency, the heroes have become even more domineering and misogynistic. Other critics contend that these characters are outdated and inappropriate for modern works. However, supporters of the publisher counter that Mills &amp; Boon are careful to follow their readers&#x27; tastes and interests; if the hero follows this trend it is because that is what the readers want.

In modern novels, popular hero archetypes are Arab sheikhs, Italian billionaires, Greek tycoons, and princes. 
According to Mills &amp; Boon author Sharon Kendrick, &quot;the sheikh represents the ultimate female fantasy.&quot; Penny Jordan adds that the hero often has a softer side, which the heroine will discover during the course of the novel: &quot;He&#x27;s often damaged by something that&#x27;s happened in his life, often to do with money. He will be more outrageous to the heroine, and harder on her. He realises he is beginning to feel, he has to resolve that conflict.&quot;

In 2011, psychologist Susan Quilliam blamed romantic fiction, and Mills &amp; Boon in particular, for poor sexual health and relationship breakdowns. She made the claim in her paper &quot;&#x27;He seized her in his manly arms and bent his lips to hers…&#x27;. The surprising impact that romantic novels have on our work&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Care&quot; published by the BMJ Group. In the paper, Quilliam writes &quot;what we see in our [family planning clinic] consulting rooms is more likely to be informed by Mills &amp; Boon than by the Family Planning Association.&quot; Quilliam argues that a correlation exists between negative attitudes toward the use of condoms and reading of romantic fiction; as well as citing a survey that shows only 11.5 per cent of romantic novels mention condom use. She suggests that a romance reader may &quot;not [use] protection with a new man because she wants to be swept up by the moment as a heroine would.&quot; Among other potential problems, romantic fiction readers are also likely to have unrealistic expectations about sex, to equate lack of romance or sexual desire with a lack of love, to see pregnancy as a cure of relationship difficulties and to be less likely to terminate pregnancies. Relationships of romance readers are more likely to break down because they are likely to think that &quot;rather than working at her relationship she should be hitching her star to a new romance.&quot; Quilliam also writes that &quot;a deep strand of escapism, perfectionism and idealisation runs through the genre&quot; and &quot;if readers start to believe the story that romantic fiction offers, then they store up trouble for themselves–and then they bring that trouble into our consulting rooms.&quot;

==Imprints==

<doc id="1051078" wikidata="Q4821837" url="?curid=1051078" title="Aultsville, Ontario">
<text>Aultsville is a ghost town in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is one of Ontario&#x27;s Lost Villages, which were permanently flooded by the creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958. The town was founded as Charlesville in 1787 by United Empire Loyalists and reached its peak in 1880, when it had 400 residents. It was the second largest town flooded by the new Seaway in 1958, with a population of 312 at the time. Before it was flooded, the abandoned buildings were burned to study the effects of fire on houses.

Families and businesses in Aultsville were moved to the new town of Ingleside before the seaway construction commenced. Some just north of Upper Canada Village where it now stands had three addresses in one week. Some walks, lanes, and yards can still be seen today. The historic train station, built in the 19th century by the Grand Trunk Railway, was moved to Upper Canada Village where it remains today.

Aultsville was named after Samuel Ault, a local businessman who represented Stormont County in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada and the House of Commons of Canada.

The Holstein-Friesian breed of cattle were first imported into Canada through Aultsville by a local resident. Michael P. Cook became the first importer of Holsteins into Ontario in 1881 when he imported two bulls and ten cows from Europe. This shipment of cattle founded the base of the Holstein breed here today, which is now the most popular dairy breed.

The road which currently leads into Upper Canada Migratory Bird Sanctuary was once a part of Aultsville Road, the village&#x27;s main street. The road leads directly into the river, where you can still see sidewalks and foundations remaining from the town when the water levels of the St. Lawrence are low.

== History ==
Prior to being occupied by Europeans, Aultsville and the surrounding area was home to many Native American settlements. When the Loyalists arrived, the land was divided and distributed with little thought given to the Native populations. The Natives were forced out of the area early into the settlement&#x27;s history.

=== Loyalist settlement and the 18th century ===
Aultsville, Ontario, was first settled in the late 1700s by a small group of five disbanded soldiers of the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York; these men were Loyalists who likely acquired the land here via grants for their loyalty to the Crown. Upon its initial settlement, the Loyalists called the settlement Charlesville, the origin of this name is unknown. Shortly after, the village became referred to as Aultsville after Samuel Ault, a relative of one of the first five men to settle here and a prominent political figure. The Ault family dammed the creek upon their arrival and established a saw mill on their property; the village essentially grew around this mill.

The first store and tavern were present in the village in the 1700s, established in 1787 by a Loyalist settler named Richard Loucks. The tavern was referred to as Loucks tavern, and was a large wooden building. The tavern doubled as a courthouse and village jail, with a pillory located inside for locking up criminals.

By the end of the 18th century, Aultsville had already established its own post office with the first post master listed as one John Bockus. The post office remained in operation until 1957, when it closed for the flooding of the Seaway.

=== 19th century – World War I === 
By 1840, the population of Aultsville had risen to 120 individuals, and many more pioneer businesses and tradespeople were established in the area. The area continued to prosper on its own into the 1850s, however when the Grand Trunk Railway was established here in 1856 the village saw a boom in population; the village grew to a population of 400 residents by 1870.

Many businesses operated in Aultsville in the mid-1800s, according to both histories and business directories from the era. The clay soil in the village allowed for brickyards and pottery works to be established. Many pioneer trades such as a blacksmith shop, shoemaker, carriage shop and tannery were also active in the village. Two more saw mills were also eventually erected in the village. The community was also home to an Oddfellows lodge, community hall and Masonic lodge.

During the mid-19th century, a small ferry operated in Aultsville in the St. Lawrence River called the Aultsville Ferry. The ferry was a small, primitive wooden ferry which operated between Aultsville and Louisville Landing, New York during the summer months. Many disputes arose between the American and Canadian sides regarding the ferry, as it was in direct competition with the American ferry.

Around 1860, Aultsville became home to its own school, referred to as the Aultsville Common School. This school served the elementary grades of the village. At some point closer to the 20th century, Aultsville established its own secondary school. This school is referred to in records as both Aultsville High School and Aultsville Continuation School. It is possible the school served as both at different periods; the difference between the two being that continuation schools served both elementary and secondary students. The secondary school and elementary school both operated until the 1950s, closing due to the flooding of the village. Aultsville High School had many sports teams including a hockey and baseball team, as well as a Cadet&#x27;s Corps.

Near the end of the 19th-century, two taverns were operating in the area; Cook&#x27;s tavern, and the Riverview Hotel. The Riverview Hotel served as an inn, and had a restaurant and tavern on site to serve patrons. Cook&#x27;s tavern, also called Cook&#x27;s tavern and livery had the same services. Both of these inns served the many stage coaches and carriages travelling along the King&#x27;s Highway. Cook&#x27;s tavern was later moved to Upper Canada Village to be preserved from the flooding.

=== 20th century ===
By the turn of the century, Aultsville had added three more general stores, three cheese factories, another garage, four service stations, and a bank to its list of businesses. A grist mill in Aultsville was built around 1929. The mill contained metal grinding plates which ran on an electric motor; the mill mostly ground the local farmers personal grain supplies. In later years, the grist mill was used as an egg grading office.

The first cheese factory was known as Croil&#x27;s and McCullough&#x27;s factory, and was located near the train station; cheese made here was shipped as far away as Montreal. Later this cheese factory became the Edward&#x27;s Cheese Factory, and two more factories opened in the village both of which were also operated by the Edward family. These cheese factories were powered by steam, using coal-fired boilers to heat cheese vats. The cream for these factories was cooled and kept cool using a primitive cold-storage method; ice was cut during the winter months from the St. Lawrence River and insulated with sawdust.

After World War II the village began to decline, many businesses closed and industries ceased operations. This was due to the fact roads in the area improved as had means of transportation; it was now feasible to travel to nearby communities for necessities. Additionally, many of the pioneer industries which once sustained Aultsville were becoming obsolete. By the mid-1950s, only one cheese factory, a bank, a general store and the schools remained in operation. In 1958, the decision was finally made to construct the seaway, and the village was scheduled for demolition. The trees were cut from the town and the buildings of Aultsville burned in a controlled fire to test the effects of fire on buildings. Around July 1, 1958, Aultsville began to be flooded along with the other Lost Villages, the process taking around 4 days.

==The St. Lawrence Seaway Project and its effects==
Before studying the actual relocation of Aultsville and its populace, it is important to understand the development of the St. Lawrence Seaway Project first. Roughly sixty years was spent negotiating and planning the actual expansion of the St. Lawrence Seaway between the years of 1895 up until 1954; the later date being the final ratification from Canada and affected provinces as well as the United States and its affected States. 
The primary intention for the newly expanded waterway and flooding of 20,000 acres, was to transport tonnage in the millions of raw materials including but not limited to iron ore, grain, coal, wood pulp and petroleum.

The first major delay took place during the First World War in 1914 until 1918. The study of Boundary Waters for Navigation and Power was put aside as resources were mainly directed towards the allied war effort.

It was not until 1939 when the Second World War started that the full benefits were realized of a larger seaway. Increased hydro needs as well as a recognition of the importance to national security put pressure on legislatures to get the project underway; however, a second major delay of the project happened in October 1942 (a year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor) when President Roosevelt declared that the St. Lawrence project was to be halted immediately due to a shortage of men and metal.

After World War II many negotiations and minor delays took place until the final proposals and developments in 1954. Furthermore, not until the Canadian government started the initial phases of planning and construction, that the United States finally participated in the joint expansion of this international project.

It is noted that the Commission in Ontario made decisions for the location of new highways towns and parks without first approaching the local residents of Aultsville, or the other Lost Villages. According to the Lost Villages Historical Society, the residents of Aultsville knew the flooding was inevitable after decades of uncertainty when all of the trees in the community were cut down. The governments assumed there would be little repercussion since there were plans to relocate nearly 6,500 people six miles west of Cornwall, Ontario; the new towns would have new and upgraded infrastructures such as modern sewer systems and roadways. This was not necessarily the case, as many of the residents could not afford to move to or live in these upgraded towns even after selling their land and receiving the additional aid provided. In all, 600 homes were evacuated in both Canada and the United States along with many hundreds of farms (200 in Canada alone).

==Fire testing and burning==

In 1958, before the flooding of the Seaway, six houses and two larger buildings were scheduled to be burned in the vacant village of Aultsville. This was an important study headed by National Research Council Canada&#x27;s Division of Building Research to study the effects of controlled burning structures. Contributors to this project were the British Joint Fire Research Organization, the US Federal Civil Defense Authority, the Ontario Fire Marshal and staff, and lastly the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. The director was G.W. Shorter who was Head of Fire Section (for his division) as well Assistant Director N.B. Hutcheon.

In the General Report, significant observances are made from the Smoke and Sound Measurements and the Temperature Measurements, to the Ventilation Rate Measurements and the Radiant Temperature of Openings. Other sections of the study also included Radiometer Measurements, Resistance Thermometer Measurements, a Gas Analysis, and to conclude, the Summary Report. 

The purpose of these created fires was to determine the survival of the occupants, spread by radiation, and ventilation rates; listed in the study as a, b, and c. The study was also used to validate evidence of time-temperature curves – normally used for performing fire resistance tests. The section under Survival of Occupants writes about whether or not noise of a fire would be useful to people upstairs in a house before the time in which survival would become unattainable. Smoke detectors were not common until the 1960s, and were used primarily in museums, art galleries, and electronic equipment protection.

Locally, the fires became known as the St. Lawrence Burns and were watched by spectators who once occupied the village. Aultsville&#x27;s volunteer fire chief observed several of the burns, including that of his own home. According to George Hickey, who was a teacher at the local high school and considered somewhat of a local historian, not many of the residents were aware of the scheduled burns. For many, the burns were considered devastating to watch after already losing their homes to the Seaway.

The National Film Board of Canada filmed all of the controlled fires at Aultsville and produced a 20-minute documentary about them called &quot;Setting Fires For Science&quot;. Additionally, Donald Brittain wrote and directed a series of films called &quot;St. Lawrence Burns, No. 1–8&quot; about the fires.

==Churches and burial grounds==
At one point, Aultsville was home to three churches: an Anglican, a United and a Presbyterian church. The Anglican church was known as St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church, with its congregation first being mentioned in the Synod journals in 1876. In 1887, a brick church was constructed to house the congregation. St. Paul&#x27;s was consecrated by a Bishop Charles Hamilton on December 19, 1900. In 1925, the church was severely damaged by fire, but was rebuilt within a year. The church was demolished in 1958 in preparation for the flooding of the Seaway. St. Peter&#x27;s church in the newly formed community of Ingleside was erected to replace it and a few other churches demolished at the time. 

The Presbyterian church in Aultsville was known as the Immanuel Presbyterian church. This church was constructed in 1899 and opened in February 1900. The church was demolished in 1957 in preparation for the flooding of the village; St. Matthew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church in Ingleside was constructed to replace it. The United church was called the Trinity United Church and was a Methodist church located within the village. Like the other churches, it was also demolished in the 1950s in preparation for the Seaway&#x27;s construction.

The United church, called Trinity United Church, had a cemetery located on its property simply referred to as the Old Burying Ground. The church was constructed in 1860 and was closed and demolished in 1957.

In the early years of the settlement until the 1900s, it was common for people to bury their dead on their property. According to local residents, grave robbing was a common problem in the village, with one individual in particular being known for padding his horse&#x27;s hooves in order to sneak around fresh graves at night. It was also common practice to bury the dead with tins or other items that would produce a sound when disturbed.

Before the expansion of the St. Lawrence Seaway, Aultsville underwent a process to preserve its old burial sites. Detailed records of eroding grave markers were made. It was during this preservation time that researchers uncovered many birthplaces of former British Loyalists who migrated to Canada before and after the American Revolution. The tombstones and graves were moved from the village to be preserved, being encased into a brick wall and becoming part of the pioneer memorial located near Upper Canada Village. Other towns that had burial grounds preserved here included Dickinson&#x27;s Landing, Farran&#x27;s Point and Wales.

==Grand Trunk train station==
Aultsville&#x27;s train station was first a Grand Trunk Railway Inc. station located along the Grand Trunk line. The first station located here was built around 1856, the same year the railway opened. The original station was made of wood, and quickly became outgrown by the village. Some records indicate the building was used as an outbuilding for the new station. The second Aultsville station, which still stands, was built between 1866 and 1889. This station is a square, red building of wood construction, built based on blueprints supplied by the railway for their &quot;Standard No. 1&quot; chain of stations; the blueprints were slightly altered to suit the community. In 1923 the Grand Trunk Railway was saved by the government&#x27;s absorption, better known as the Canadian National Railway (CNR); Aultsville station became a part of their estate in this year. In the 1930s, the station was partially rebuilt after a westbound train jumped the tracks, destroying the outbuildings and scraping the corner of the station.

During the 1950s Canadian National Railway relocated some of its track away from the rising flood waters. In preparation for the flooding of the Seaway, the building was donated to the St. Lawrence Parks Commission and moved to its current location. The train station now sits near Upper Canada Village along one of the only remaining original sections of railway from the Grand Trunk line left in its original place. In recent years the station has been home to a British Home Child exhibit.

<doc id="1051085" wikidata="Q5172383" url="?curid=1051085" title="Corporal of Bolsena">
<text>The Corporal of Bolsena dates from a Eucharistic miracle in Bolsena, Italy, in 1263 when a consecrated host began to bleed onto a corporal, the small cloth upon which the host and chalice rest during the Canon of the Mass. The appearance of blood was seen as a miracle to affirm the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which states that the bread and wine become the Body and Blood of Christ at the moment of consecration during the Mass. Today the Corporal of Bolsena is preserved in a rich reliquary at Orvieto in the cathedral. The reddish spots on the cloth, upon close observation, show the profile of a face similar to those that traditionally represent Jesus Christ. It is said that the miraculous bleeding of the host occurred in the hands of an officiating priest who had doubts about transubstantiation, Peter of Prague. The &quot;Miracle of Bolsena&quot; is regarded by the Roman Catholic Church as a private revelation, meaning that Catholics are under no obligation to believe it although they may do so freely.
Pope Urban IV makes no mention of it in the bull by which he established the feast of Corpus Christi, although the legend of the miracle is set in his lifetime and is claimed by its partisans to have determined him in his purpose of establishing the feast. The contemporary biographers of Urban are silent: Muratori, &quot;Rerum Italicarum scriptores&quot;, (vol. III, pt. l, 400ff) and Thierricus Vallicoloris, who, in his life of the pope in Latin verse, describes in detail all the events of the pontiff&#x27;s stay at Orvieto, referring elsewhere also to the devotion of Urban in celebrating the Mass, and to the institution of the Feast of Corpus Christi, without at any time making allusion to a miracle at Bolsena.

The miracle of Bolsena is related in the inscription on a slab of red marble in the church of St Christina, and is of later date than the canonization of St. Thomas Aquinas (1323). The oldest record of the miracle is in the enamel representations of it that adorn the front of the reliquary 
made by Sienese goldsmith Ugolino di Vieri in 1337–1338.

In 1344 Clement VI, referring to this matter in a brief, uses only the words &quot;propter miraculum aliquod&quot; (&quot;on account of some miracle&quot;) (Pennazzi, 367); Gregory XI, in a brief of 25 June 1377, gives a short account of the miracle; and abundant reference to it is found later (1435), in the sermons of the Dominican preacher Leonardo Mattei of Udine (&quot;In festo Corp. Christi&quot;, xiv, ed. Venice, 1652, 59) and by Antoninus of Florence (&quot;Chronica&quot;, III, 19, xiii, 1), the latter, however, does not say (as the local legend claims) that the priest doubted the Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist, but, merely that a few drops from the chalice fell upon the corporal. For the rest, similar legends of the &quot;blood-stained corporal&quot; are quite frequent in the legend collections of even earlier date than the fourteenth century, and coincide with the great Eucharistic polemics of the ninth to the twelfth centuries.

The Feast of Corpus Christi is one of the major public holidays for the city of Orvieto, during which the Corporal of Bolsena is paraded around the city with much fanfare.

The left half of a large fresco in the Apostolic Room of the Vatican Palace, titled The Mass at Bolsena, was painted by the Renaissance painter Raphael.
Because of its red pigmentation, caused by expression of the dye prodigiosin, and its ability to grow on bread, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; has been proposed by Ronald Bentley and J.W. Bennett as a naturalistic explanation of medieval accounts of the &quot;miraculous&quot; appearance of blood on the Corporal of Bolsena. In 2015, while performing a preservation study on the tissue, further analysis with UV light have confirmed the presence of blood on the corporal, as &quot;each section returns biological deposits consisting of blood, split into plasma and serum, reproduced by transmission in a specular and symmetrical way respecting the original folds&quot;.

<text>The Forbidden Love EP is an EP by indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie, released October 24, 2000, on Barsuk Records.

The songs &quot;405 (Acoustic)&quot; and &quot;Company Calls Epilogue (Alternate Take)&quot; are an acoustic version and remix, respectively, of two songs from Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s second album, &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot;, which was released earlier the same year.

==Artwork==
Regarding the EP&#x27;s cover, Benjamin Gibbard noted that he &quot;always wanted to have a release and have that photo be the cover and we took the pictures a long time ago when we were in college. When we pulled them out they didn&#x27;t look like what we thought they were going to look and they didn&#x27;t look as good. So we had to kind of change the contrast and make it look really shitty. To be perfectly honest it didn&#x27;t turn out as good as we wanted it to. But it&#x27;s an EP. It serves a purpose, and I think the label wishes they could have done more. It&#x27;s not aesthetically our best release, but it&#x27;s okay.&quot;

<doc id="1051090" wikidata="Q5870242" url="?curid=1051090" title="History of the Polish Army">
<text>The Polish Army () is the name applied to the military forces of Poland. The name has been in use since the early 19th century, although it can be used to refer to earlier formations as well. Polish Armed Forces consist of the Army (&#x27;), [[Polish Navy|Navy]] (&#x27;) and Air Force (&#x27;) branches and are under the command of the Ministry of National Defense (&#x27;).

==History==

===Kingdom of Poland (10th century–1569)===
The first Polish Army was created in the 10th-century kingdom of Poland, under the Piast dynasty. The prince&#x27;s forces were composed of a group of armed men, usually mounted, named drużyna. Their key role was the protection of the monarch and supporting the taxation effort. Their organisation was similar to other such armed units of other Slavic rulers, and were often of foreign origin.

With time, the early tribal warriors gave rise to knights and eventually, by the 15th century, the whole social class of the szlachta or Polish gentry. The Polish gentry formed a distinct element within the ancient tribal groupings. This is uncertain, however, as there is little documentation on the early history of Poland, or of the movements of the Slavonic people into what became the territory so designated.

Around the 14th century, there was little difference between those called knights and those referred to as szlachta in Poland. Members of the szlachta had the personal obligation to defend the country (pospolite ruszenie), and thereby became the kingdom&#x27;s privileged social class. It was they who were obliged to build and support castles as well as to keep peace and order on territory they were assigned.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795)===

The armies of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, or the First Polish Republic, were commanded by four hetmans. The armies comprised:
*&quot;Wojsko kwarciane&quot;: Regular units with wages paid from taxes (these units were later merged with the wojsko komputowe)
*&quot;Wojsko komputowe&quot;: Semi-regular units created for times of war (in 1652 these units were merged with the wojsko kwarciane into a new permanent army)
*Pospolite ruszenie: Szlachta levée en masse
*Piechota łanowa, piechota wybraniecka and piechota dymowa: Units based on peasant (later, townsfolk) recruits
*Registered Cossacks: Troops made up of Cossacks, who were recruited until 1699; included many infantry
*Royal guard: A small unit whose primary purpose was to escort the monarch and members of his family
*Mercenaries: As with most other armies, hired to supplement regular units
*Private armies: Usually paid for and equipped by &quot;magnats&quot; or cities

Some units of the Commonwealth used fairly unusual tactics. These units included:
*Husaria: heavy cavalry armed with lances; their charges were extremely effective until advances in firearms in the late 17th century substantially increased infantry firepower.
*Cossacks: general name for all Commonwealth units of light cavalry, even if they did not contain a single ethnic Cossack; fast and maneuverable like oriental cavalry units of Ottoman Empire vassals, but lacking the firepower of European cavalry such as the Swedish rajtars.
*Tabor: military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. Their use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent by other Commonwealth units.

===Army without a country (1795–1918)===
After partitions of Poland, during the period from 1795 until 1918, Polish military was recreated several times in Poland during uprisings like the November Uprising of 1830 and the January Uprising in 1863, and outside Poland like during Napoleonic wars (Polish Legions in Italy). The Congress Kingdom of Poland, ruled by Russian Tsars with a certain degree of autonomy, had an Army in the years 1815-1830 which was disbanded after the unsuccessful insurrection.

Large numbers of Poles also served in the occupiers&#x27; armies: Austro-Hungarian (before 1867 Imperial Austrian), Imperial Russian and German armies (before 1871 Prussian). However, these powers took care to spread Polish soldiers all over their armies and as a rule did not form predominantly Polish units.

During World War I, the Polish Legions were set up in Galicia, the southern part of Poland under Austrian occupation. They were both disbanded after the Central Powers failed to provide guarantees of Polish independence after the war. General Józef Haller, the commander of the Second Brigade of the Polish Legion, switched sides in late 1917, and via Murmansk took part of his troops to France, where he created the Blue Army. It was joined by several thousand Polish volunteers from the United States. It fought valiantly on the French front in 1917 and 1918.

===Second Polish Republic and World War II (1918–1945)===
When Poland regained independence in 1918, it recreated its military which participated in the Polish–Soviet War of 1919-1922 and in World War II, 1939–1945. During the German occupation of Poland, a number of resistance movements were created, of which the Home Army was the most significant.
===People&#x27;s Republic of Poland (1947–1989)===
The Polish armed forces, then known as Polish People&#x27;s Army, were part of the Soviet-controlled Warsaw Pact. Polish units took part in occupying Czechoslovakia in response to the Prague Spring in 1968. The command post for the invasion was actually located on Polish soil, at Marshal Ivan Yakubovsky&#x27;s Legnica headquarters.

===Third Polish Republic (1989–present)===
After January 1990 the name of the armed forces was changed to &#x27;Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland,&#x27; to accord with the Polish State&#x27;s new official name.

In March 2003 the Polish Armed Forces took part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, deploying 1500 personnel, special forces and a support ship (see Polish involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq).

Following the destruction of Saddam&#x27;s regime the Polish Land Forces supplied a brigade and a division headquarters for the 17-nation Multinational Division Central-South, part of the U.S.-led Multi-National Force – Iraq. At its peak, Poland had 2,500 soldiers in the south of the country. Poland deployed about ten attack and transport helicopters as part of its force in Iraq between 2004 and 2008.

The troop number was reduced to 900 in 2006. Of the 900 soldiers, only 80 ever left their Forward operating base to conduct operations.

<text>Dickinson&#x27;s Landing is an underwater ghost town in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is one of Ontario&#x27;s Lost Villages, which were permanently flooded by the creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958.

Families and businesses in Dickinson&#x27;s Landing were moved to the new town of Ingleside before the seaway construction commenced.

==History==
In approximately 1669, Dickinson&#x27;s Landing was founded by French explorer La Salle as a trading post at the rapids that were known as &quot;Long Sault&quot;. There was a natural formation of a long low shelf of land at the water&#x27;s edge that facilitated mooring of watercraft. Later, during the days of the stagecoach, the small hamlet provided a place where weary travelers could stop and rest, whether they arrived by land or river. In 1860, the Prince of Wales, Albert Edward visited Dickinson&#x27;s Landing, stopped at the train station and took a ride over Long Sault rapids in a steam. Albert Edward would later become King Edward VII. As the then prince had walked from a wharf onto the steamer, the local citizens requested a remembrance of his visit and therefore the post office in Dickinson&#x27;s Landing was renamed &quot;Wales&quot; in honor of his visit.

The first practicing medical practitioner was a woman whom the town&#x27;s residents referred to as &quot;Granny Hoople&quot;. She learned her craft after living amongst the Native Americans for seven years. She had been taken captive after the Native Americans burned her childhood home, killed her parents, took her brother captive and then killed him after he became a troublemaker with them. In 1811, an actual medical doctor, named Dr. Archibald moved to the hamlet.

The Landing provided income to its residents by having a cheese factory (that had been home to a tannery), a cooper shop, two shoemakers, a shop that fabricated buggies, furniture and coffins. In 1863, a Catholic church, named Our Lady of Grace, was erected.

==St. Lawrence Seaway construction==
During the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway, a number of Canadian towns alongside the St. Lawrence River were flooded in a 20,000 acre planned flood to allow for the expansion of the St. Lawrence River. Several of those towns, including Aultsville, Farran&#x27;s Point, Dickinson&#x27;s Landing and Wales were planned to be eliminated and residents and structures were moved to two newly created towns named, Ingleside and Long Sault. Those towns are now referred to as the &quot;Lost Villages&quot;. In addition to the relocation of buildings, the project called for movement of roads, and railroad tracks. Two significant towns, Iroquois and Morrisburg had sections built on higher ground. The flooding officially began on what became known as &quot;Inundation Day&quot; which was scheduled for 1 July 1958.

The widening project of the St. Lawrence River, had been planned since 1941 and included cooperation between both the American and Canadian sides of the river. The agreement, signed 19 March 1941, detailed plans for Ontario Hydro and American power companies to significantly increase the power potential by 1.1 million horsepower, each, from the development of an international rapids section of the seaway. This was desired to improve wartime power demands although the construction occurred well after the war ended. This was in part, due to the fact that the United States Congress did not ratify these plans due to more immediate concerns posed by the Pearl Harbor Attack and other interests. The original plans further called to reduce the severity of the rapids at Long Sault by effectively flooding the rapids. Further, a deep water canal was planned for the American side to permit ocean-going vessels to travel further inland. The plans required the Canadian side of the river to take the brunt of the flooding as the shore line in Ontario was shallower than in New York State.

<text>Farran&#x27;s Point is an underwater ghost town in the province of Ontario, Canada. It is one of Ontario&#x27;s Lost Villages, which were permanently flooded by the creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958.

Families and businesses in Farran&#x27;s Point were moved to the new town of Ingleside before the seaway construction commenced. The small village is submerged under shallow water; portions of sidewalks and foundations can be seen when the water of the St. Lawrence River is low.

It is the birthplace of NHL Hockey Hall of Famer Cy Denneny.

== History ==
While legend has it that Jacob Farrand, a United Empire Loyalist, was the first settler at Farran’s Point and that the family changed the spelling of the name in subsequent years, research has proven that this is just a legend. Farrand was granted land in the Township of Williamsburg, not the Township of Osnabruck, and he spent many years of his life in the Town of Cornwall.

Research indicates that it was Charles Curtis Farran Sr., an immigrant to Upper Canada from Dublin, Ireland, in the 1790s, whose name is associated with the naming of the village of Farran’s Point. In 1808, he married Catherine Baker, daughter of Adam Baker Sr U.E.L. He operated an inn in the vicinity of the canal that was eventually constructed along the St. Lawrence at Farran’s Point in 1847. An Order in Council granted Catherine the property at Farran’s Point on January 26, 1808 as the daughter of a Loyalist.

It was Charles Curtis Farran, affectionately known as C.C., and later on the Kerr brothers, George and Joseph, who were responsible for the village’s early growth. C.C. Farran owned several mills that included a grist mill, located at the lock, a carding mill, sawmill, and shingle mill. He also owned a general store, as well as a large tract of land north of the village and west of where the Grand Trunk Railway Station was eventually built. Farran built a power station near the rapids on the St. Lawrence in front of the village. In the early 1800s, several mills were established by Farrand&#x27;s son and members of the Kerr family within the village, including a grist mill, a carding mill, two sawmills and a shingle mill. Additionally, Farran built a general store and a power station near the rapids.

Joseph Kerr, a newcomer from Ireland, was also a mill owner who went on to become very prosperous. Joseph, along with his brothers, George, Thomas and William, owned two sawmills, a grits mill, farms and a large general store with branches a Wales and Aultsville. All the brothers were active in politics. Joseph Kerr served the community as Reeve and both Joseph and George were active at the provincial level. The huge Kerr home, built on a corner lot that included a store on the east side, was often referred to as Buckingham palace.

The success of the Farran and Kerr operations attracted a number of other businesses to the area and by the mid 1800s the little community boasted a population of around 300 and a post office had been established. The mills were located along the shoreline at the south end of  the village. The business district was situated further north with most of the businesses located either on Mill Street, which ran north from the Farran Mills, or on the north side of the highway, Known locally as Main Street. The community was bounded on each side by property owned by the Kerr brothers. In 1847, a small canal and lock was opened in the village to allow vessels to navigate the rapids in the village easily. Sometime in the 1850s, the Grand Trunk railway was built through the village and shortly after, a railway station and stationmaster&#x27;s dwelling were built in the community.

At the end of the nineteenth century, the village contained two hotels; the Baker Stage Coach Inn and a second hotel run by a man named Edward Denney. At this time, the village also boasted a bakery, a millinery shop, and a couple of taverns on top of the preexisting mills. Two general stores were in operation, as well as a blacksmith shop, tinsmith, livery stable and a marble works.

Farran&#x27;s Point was home to two churches; a Roman Catholic church called St. Francis of Assisi Church, and St. John&#x27;s Presbyterian Church. St. John&#x27;s church was established around the 1870s; this church was a donation from C. C. Farran (son or grandson of the first C. C. Farran). Formerly, the building that became the church was a stagecoach stop located west of the village which was moved into Farran&#x27;s Point. St. John&#x27;s served multiple denominations as it was the only church in the town.

In conjunction with the construction of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Project that started in 1954, the Moses-Saunders Power Project was also built. When construction of these structures was completed, inundation began on July 1, 1958 and resulted in the formation of an artificial widening and deepening in the river which was named Lake St. Lawrence. Inundation of the river caused a dozen villages including Farran&#x27;s Point, now collectively known as &quot;The Lost Villages&quot;, to be flooded.

<text>Wales is a ghost town in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is one of Ontario&#x27;s Lost Villages, which were permanently flooded by the creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958. The town was named for the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) who visited the area during his Canadian tour of 1860. Wales was built on the land grant of Dr. James Stuart, of the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New  York. From 1810 to 1957, five generations of the Stuart family lived on this property.

Families and businesses in Wales were moved to the new town of Ingleside before the seaway construction commenced.

Wales, about two miles away from the old shoreline, was the only inland town affected by the flooding, as the community was located in a creek valley below the new waterline.

<text>Mille Roches is an underwater ghost town in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is one of Ontario&#x27;s Lost Villages, which were permanently flooded by the creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958.

Families and businesses in Mille Roches were moved to the new town of Long Sault before the seaway construction commenced.

Mille Roches was the birthplace of Levi Addison Ault, born into a well-known and established family in the town, who moved to Cincinnati, Ohio as an adult and became a successful businessman and the city&#x27;s commissioner of parks in the early 1900s. Ault also donated a large parcel of family-owned land on Sheek&#x27;s Island, which became Ault Park.

==Ethnic history of Mille Roches and the region==
Eastern Ontario was always a highway or corridor through which people moved, a corridor used by migration and conquest. Prior to European colonization, the Mohawks and Six Nations Iroquois settled and raided through the St. Lawrence valley. The French and British fought over the waterway, and after the American revolution, in 1812–14, it became a battleground between Americans and Canadians. At various times, much like the rest of Eastern Ontario, it also became a home for migrants looking to escape authorities or find safe haven from overseas conflicts.

Early settlement is largely undocumented, though oral histories and early accounts suggest that settlers, traders and farmers lived in the area long before formal recognition.

When the local population emerged into registered and recorded history, the regional population was already a mixture of French Canadian, Ojibwe and Mohawk residents. To this was added an influx of American English loyalists and refugees from the Thirteen Colonies (now the United States), French Canadian and Acadian migrants, and, later, Scottish and Irish immigrants and refugees. These different groups mixed and integrated over time, with family names and histories reflecting a blending of different backgrounds that was generally typical of Eastern Ontario, especially the &quot;United Counties&quot; of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, but also true of the general area of Loyalist settlement east of Kingston.

Smaller but noted contributions in the region were made by others, from Jewish traders, craftsmen and merchants to former slaves. John Baker, for example, who died in 1871 at the age of 93, was said to be the last Canadian born into slavery. Slavery was ended in the colony of Upper Canada in stages, beginning in 1793 when importing slaves was banned and culminating in 1819, when Upper Canada Attorney-General John Robinson declared any slaves living in Canada were now free. Most of these former slaves settled and integrated into the communities where they were freed. By 1833, all slaves in British North America and the Empire were free, the first major power in world history to abolish slavery. This affected even the village of Milles roches, as a place where former slaves settled.

The aftermath of the American Revolution resulted in the formal division of Upper and Lower Canada (later, Ontario and Quebec) to accommodate loyalists fleeing persecution in the new United States. Distribution of land throughout Southern Ontario brought major change to Eastern Ontario. Cornwall (and the surrounding area), originally called &quot;Royal Township #2&quot; and &quot;Johnstown&quot;, was a rough place, and bred a local culture of self-reliance. Mille Roches&#x27; settlers and residents were more effectively integrated into the increasingly tight-knit region after the Loyalist arrival, with Cornwall as its economic centre.

==Integration and community==
Mille Roches, like many of the local communities, was unusual in Canada at the time for being quite socially integrated. Characterized by a mix of economic migrants, refugees and opportunists, the local population was a blend of different social classes and ethnic backgrounds. The interdependence demanded by isolation and the lack of either support or interference from authorities meant that villagers in the region were obliged to rely on each other for support.

The original native population was remarkably welcoming, and the Iroquois were especially known for integrating newcomers and adapting to change. Many people in the region have some native ancestry as a result, and family bonds have long linked the formal reservations and the surrounding area.

==Growth and development==
Among many other sites, Mille Roches was originally an obstacle for water navigation up the St. Lawrence river. Rapids prevented the deep-bottomed hulls of ocean-going ships from moving inland into the Great Lakes basin. Boats would have to unload, their contents carted and carried overland, and then be re-loaded. Calls for building a canal at this spot on the river came very early.

The area immediately around Mille Roches had been used as a source of attractive, highly prized and sought-after black stone for a long period before being formally settled by Europeans. North of the townsite were limestone quarries, which had already been in use by suppliers in Montreal, and the name of the town in French refers to either the large numbers of rocky formations in the area or the rapids which prevented river navigation.

With resource development, mall farmsteads started appearing early in the history of European settlement in Ontario as migrants filtered into the region, and much of this settlement is undocumented.

From 1780 to 1830, after formal recognition resulting from Loyalist settlement, development was slow but steady and a substantial village emerged. Growth was spurred by the use of water power and spawned the development of a large number of mills. Combined with the valuable local stone deposits, the result was a mini-boom in grain milling, stone cutting and milling, and textile operations, and other businesses that could benefit from water power. In August, 1835, its people were rewarded with their own post office.

The Cornwall Canal was built in 1834, to facilitate travel to the upper St Lawrence basin and the Great Lakes. Unfortunately, the canal cut the town off from the mainland, creating an island in the middle of the river. Over time, the village expanded to the north, eventually forming one town that was split in the middle into &quot;old&quot; Mille Roches on one side of the canal and &quot;new&quot; Mille Roches on the mainland to the north. The canal&#x27;s course caused the decline of the village and the area only improved with the arrival of railways in the 1850s.

The Ault family was an example of the burgeoning prosperity of the area. They ran textile mills. It was this family into which Levi Addison Ault was born. Mille Roches was also known for niche businesses, including the very respected Brooks Furniture Company, as well as a range of talented craftspeople in many industries.

Canal and lock construction in the late 1800s and early 1900s brought work, large boats and electric power generation stations. Railway connections provided much-needed connections to other local communities for public services, such as high schools, which were located largely in Cornwall.

==Independence and enterprise==
As it was a transit corridor linking greater economic powers, Eastern Ontario has long been a region known for independence and enterprise. One inevitable aspect of being a major trade route and border zone is smuggling. This has a remarkably long tradition, but formal recognition and notoriety increased in the 1920s, during the Prohibition period in US history. Smuggling remains a major local concern, even today. Current plans in Cornwall and the area call for dismantling its reputation as &quot;smugglers&#x27; alley&quot;.

This history of independence is partly the result of isolation and self-reliance. Governments have typically neglected the area, treating it as little more than a transit corridor. This began very early, even in the 1830s, and prior to this the Loyalist settlers had themselves been forced to be more or less completely self-reliant.

&quot;The original 516 settlers arrived in Royal Township #2 with minimal supplies and faced years of hard work and possible starvation. Upon their departure from military camps in Montreal, Pointe Claire, Saint Anne, and Lachine in the fall of 1784, loyalists were given a tent, one month’s worth of food rations, clothes, and agricultural provisions by regiment commanders. They were promised one cow for every two families, an ax, and other necessary tools in the near future.
For the next three years, bateaux crews delivered rations to the township, after which residents were left to fend for
themselves.&quot;

In a foreshadowing of what was to come over a century later, in 1834, after the building of the first canal, &quot;Old Mille Roches&quot; had been cut off from the mainland. A delegation of townspeople eventually forced the government to provide compensation, after significant pressure, but this was insufficient to fully redress the damage that had been done. By the 1850s, the town had recovered and the entire region was developing, but an ominous precedent had been set.

==Inundation and obliteration==
By the 1910s, Mille Roches was a prosperous, well-to-do town with a diverse economy and a growing population, linked into a broad social and commercial network of villages and towns throughout Eastern Ontario.

Starting in the 1920s, plans began for damming the St. Lawrence to build a massive hydro-electric power plant and an artificial body of water that was navigable for ocean-going ships. This would bury much of the local landscape under an artificial lake. As negotiations between governments continued for two decades and more, local land values plummeted as a result of the project&#x27;s apparent inevitability. By &quot;Inundation Day&quot;, on July 1, 1958, which was also the Dominion Day ( Canada Day ) holiday, many landowners complained that market value compensation was insufficient, since the Seaway plan had already depressed property values in the region. These complaints were never addressed, a sad parallel to the poor treatment the locals had been given more than a century earlier.

Many of the houses were moved to one of the new villages constructed along the new rivershore. Long Sault, named in memory of the former rapids, still maintains many of the homes from Mille Roches that were moved to new sites in the town, as well as a museum devoted to the history of The Lost Villages.

Under water, divers have explored what remains of the old power generation plant and the paper mill, but while the foundations remain, most of the buildings were removed or demolished.

Today, nothing of the village remains above water. A beach in on the Long Sault Parkway park, based on a chain of islands, is named after the village. From these former highlands, the view overlooks a broad bay, on the far end of which is the site of the village, now lost under Lake St. Lawrence.

<text>Moulinette is an underwater ghost town in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is one of Ontario&#x27;s Lost Villages, which were permanently flooded by the creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958. Families and businesses in Moulinette were moved to the new town of Long Sault before the seaway construction commenced. The village was located as a strip community along Highway 2, on the St. Lawrence River. At the time of the flooding, Moulinette had a population of around 311 residents. The community would have been located in what is now South Stormont township.

Moulinette was settled in the late 1700s by United Empire Loyalists of the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment from New York. In the nineteenth century many pioneer industries and businesses were established in the village. The origin of the name Moulinette is disputed; it is thought to have originated either from the French term for &quot;little mill&quot; as a reference to the many mills located in the village or from the French word &quot;moulinet&quot;, meaning reel or winch as a reference to French ships who navigated the nearby rapids using winches.

== History ==
The land which Moulinette occupied was originally given as a land grant to a Sir John Johnson around 1784, however the land ended up in the possession of one of his relatives, Adam Dixson (sometimes recorded as Dixon) who settled the land here. Upon his arrival, Dixson constructed a dam, which ran from the nearby Sheek&#x27;s Island to the mainland, in order to generate power; immediately following this, he established a grist mill. The village of Moulinette grew surrounding this mill and dam, and Dixson is credited as its founder. 

The community had its own post office by the 1830s, and by 1840, the village boasted 100 residents. Two churches had been constructed to serve the community, and many pioneer businesses had been established. During this period, the village had a sawmill, a foundry, a carding machine, a general store and a tavern. Additionally, a brewery operated around this time, however three years after its construction in 1840, it burned and was not rebuilt. The town also had two woollen mills, located on the nearby island.

By the end of the nineteenth century, the construction of the Cornwall Canal allowed Moulinette to prosper as a village. The flooding of the canal had submerged part of the village and the nearby Sheek&#x27;s Island; the woollen mills were lost to the flood. During this time, a flour mill and another saw mill were built to replace the lost mills. The village was now home to two hotels, called the Lion and the Pea Green; as well as two general stores, two wharves, a cheese factory, barber shop and an elementary school.

In the beginning of the 1900s, the population had raised to around 311 individuals and the village remained relatively unchanged; many businesses were still established and some businesses had changed to better suit the times such as the blacksmith shop which became a garage. The community relied heavily on tourism with three tourist homes, a motel, and tourists cabins being in operation on top of the two existing hotels.

By 1957, businesses had ceased operations and homes had been relocated to Long Sault in preparations for the floods. The barber shop, called Zina Hill&#x27;s Barber Shop, and the Grand Trunk railway station were relocated to the Lost Villages Museum and are now used as exhibit buildings.

== St. Lawrence Seaway project and demise ==
After over half a century of planning, negotiations and development, the St. Lawrence Seaway project became a reality, which called for nine communities along the Canadian side of the St. Lawrence River, including Moulinette, to be permanently relocated then flooded. The intention of the Seaway project was to expand the waterway, allowing ocean-going vessels to travel the St. Lawrence River and replacing the system of locks and canals; this would translate into potentially millions of tonnes of goods being easily transported by ship down the river.

The undertaking was plagued with many delays. From the planning phase, started in 1895, through to commencement of the project in 1954, Canada and the US both disagreed with different parts of the development plans and both World Wars caused further delays. During World War I, both countries&#x27; governments were simply too preoccupied to deal with the development plans, and during and immediately after World War II, plans were halted due to a lack of supplies and men. The project became a reality when the Canadian government began the initial phases of planning and construction, essentially forcing the United States to begin to participate. After 59 years, 1954 saw the plans finalized on both sides of the river and Seaway construction could finally commence. Nine communities would be lost.

It has been noted that the Commission in Ontario made these plans without consulting those who lived within the village. The government made the decision to move and flood the villages with little thought given to the residents of Moulinette and the surrounding villages and towns. The Canadian government assumed there would be little repercussion, as there were plans in place to relocate all of the residents to newly upgraded towns with newer, improved infrastructure. This was not necessary the case, as many residents could not afford to move to or live in the new towns despite land sales and government aid.&gt; Some homes and businesses were moved to the new towns of Ingleside and Long Sault, and some flooded. Additionally, the church and a few other buildings such as the barber shop were moved to become a part of Upper Canada Village and the Lost Villages Museum.

== Churches and cemeteries ==
Moulinette was formerly home to two churches, the Christ Anglican Church and the Moulinette Methodist Church, which later became St. Andrew&#x27;s United church. The Moulinette Methodist Church was constructed around 1834 on land donated by the church&#x27;s Reverend, Stephen Brownell. In 1871, a wooden steeple was added to the brick church. In 1925, the church joined with the United Church of Canada and was renamed St. Andrews United. 

As early as 1830, an Anglican congregation was formed in Moulinette with services being conducted out of private homes or other buildings. In 1836, Adam Dixson donated land to be used as church grounds as well as burial ground, the church, Christ Anglican Church, was constructed shortly after. The church was in use while being built as Dixson&#x27;s wife died during the construction and her funeral became the first service to be held in the new building. The white, frame, church underwent renovations in 1902 when it was enlarged. In 1925 the church purchased St. George&#x27;s Hall from Milles Roches to be used for church activities and in 1931 more land was donated to extend the burial grounds. In preparation for the flooding of the Seaway, a new Christ Church was built in the new town of Ingleside in the 1950s to accommodate the congregation. The church was secularized on June 24, 1957, by Bishop Ernest Reed, and then moved to Upper Canada Village for preservation. The church was restored and sits on site as part of the open air museum.

Prior to the flooding of the Seaway, the cemetery accompanying Christ Church was fully transcribed and recorded. The Christ Church Anglican cemetery&#x27;s graves were moved in the 1950s and stones encased in the brick wall of the pioneer memorial near Upper Canada Village where they currently remain.

Families and businesses in Maple Grove were moved by Ontario Hydro to the new town of Long Sault before the seaway construction commenced. On August 10, 1954, prime minister Louis St. Laurent, premier Leslie Frost and various U.S. officials turned the first shovelful of earth in Maple Grove. Jeremiah French came from Vermont and arrived at Maple Grove in 1784. He started out with nothing more than a tiny settlers&#x27; cottage which over time expanded into a huge flour and saw mills operation.

<text>Samzhubzê District (also spelled Sangzhuzi District, Samdruptse District) is a district in the Tibet Autonomous Region of the China, and the administrative center of the prefecture-level city of Shigatse (Tibetan Pinyin: Xigazê). Prior to 2014 it was known as the county-level city of Shigatse. It was the ancient capital of Ü-Tsang province and is the second largest city in Tibet with an estimated population of 117,000 in 2013. Samzhubzê is located at the confluence of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and the Nyang River (Nyang Chu or Nyanchue), about southwest of Lhasa and northwest of Gyantse, at an altitude of .

== History ==
In the 17th century, the city and the dzong was called Samdrubtsé (one of the transliterations of the current name). It was the capital of the Tsang.

In the 19th century, the &quot;Tashi&quot; or Panchen Lama had temporal power over Tashilhunpo Monastery and three small districts, though not over the town of Shigatse itself, which was administered by two Dzongpön (Prefects) appointed from Lhasa. The Tibetan territory was divided into 53 prefecture districts called &quot;Dzongs&quot;.

There were two &quot;Dzongpöns&quot; for every &quot;Dzong&quot;—a lama (Tse-dung) and a layman. They were entrusted with both civil and military powers and are equal in all respects, though subordinate to the generals and the Chinese Amban in military matters. However, there were only one or two Ambans representing the Qing (Manchu) Chinese emperor residing in Lhasa, directing a little garrison, and their power installed since 1728, progressively declined to end-up as observer at the eve of their expulsion in 1912 by the 13th Dalai Lama. In 1952, shortly after the annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Shigatse had a population of perhaps 12,000 people, making it the second largest town in Tibet.

In 1959, Shigatse was made the administrative center of an eponymous special district () of Tibet. In 1970 the special district was upgraded to a prefecture and the town designated a county. In 1986 the county became a county-level city, and when the prefecture was again upgraded to a prefecture-level city in 2014, the county-level city was redesignated a district and given the new name of Samzhubzê. On 26 June 2014 Rikaze region upgraded to prefecture-level Rikaze city, the original county-level Rikaze city renamed Samzhubzê District.

== Geography and climate==
Samzhubzê lies on flat terrain surrounded by high mountains, and the urban area is located just south of the Yarlung Zangbo River. The city lies at an elevation of around , and within its administrative area there are five peaks higher than . The city&#x27;s administrative area ranges in latitude from 29° 07&#x27; to 29° 09&#x27; N and in longitude from 88° 03&#x27; to 89° 08&#x27; E.

Samzhubzê has a monsoon-influenced, alpine version of a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwb&quot;), with frosty, very dry winters and warm, wet summers. Temperatures are relatively moderate for the Tibetan Plateau, as the annual mean temperature is . Barely any precipitation falls from November to March, when the diurnal temperature variation can frequently exceed . Nearly two-thirds of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August alone. Sunshine is abundant year-round, totaling 3248 hours annually.

Samzhubzê is rich in medicinal herbs, with more than 300 varieties of commonly used medicinal plants, such as Cordyceps, Bayberry, Tianma, Snowdrop, Rhodiola Rosea, Rhubarb, etc.

== Administrative divisions ==

Shigatse administers two subdistricts and ten townships.

== Tashilhunpo ==
Samzhubzê contains the huge Tashilhunpo Monastery, founded in 1447 by Gendun Drup, the First Dalai Lama. It is the traditional seat of the Panchen Lamas. Until the Chinese arrived in the 1950s, the &quot;Tashi&quot; or Panchen Lama had temporal power over three small districts, though not over Samzhubzê itself, which was administered by a dzongpön (general) appointed from Lhasa. In the 2nd week of the 5th lunar month (around June/July), Tashilhunpo Monastery is the scene of a 3-day festival and a huge thangka is displayed. 
The imposing castle, Samdrubtse Dzong or &quot;Shigatse Dzong&quot;, was probably built in the 15th century. It looked something like a smaller version of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, and had turret-like fortifications at the ends and a central Red Palace. It used to be the seat of the kings of Ü-Tsang and the capital of the province of Ü-Tsang or Tsang.

The castle was totally dismantled, rock by rock, by hundreds of Tibetans at the instigation of the Chinese in 1961. Between 2005 and 2007, the building was reconstructed, financed by donations from Shanghai. Such &quot;Preservation and Reparation Project of Sangzhutse Fortress of Shigatse City&quot; was completed in May 2007 and was designed by the Construction Design Institute of Shanghai Tongji University. Old photographs served as a basis for the reconstruction, which was executed in concrete. Afterwards, the exterior was to be wainscotted with natural stones. The &quot;dzong&quot;, which in the 17th century served as a model for the construction of the Potala Palace, is set to become a museum for Tibetan culture.

<doc id="1051140" wikidata="Q2177580" url="?curid=1051140" title="Ruth Bernhard">
<text>Ruth Bernhard (October 14, 1905 – December 18, 2006) was a German-born American photographer.

==Early life and education==
Bernhard was born in Berlin to Lucian Bernhard and Gertrude Hoffmann. Lucian Bernhard was known for his poster and typeface design, many of which bear his name and are still in use. Bernhard&#x27;s parents divorced when she was 2 years old and she only met her mother twice after the divorce. She was raised by two schoolteacher sisters and their mother. Bernhard&#x27;s father Lucian was a major proponent of Ruth&#x27;s work, and advised her frequently.

Bernhard studied art history and typography at the Berlin Academy of Art from 1925 to 1927 before moving to New York City to join her father. She began teaching at the University of California in 1958, while also giving lectures, classes and workshops all over the United States.

==Photography career==

In 1927 Bernhard moved to New York City, where her father was already living. She worked as an assistant to Ralph Steiner in &quot;Delineator&quot; magazine, but he terminated her employment for indifferent performance. Using the severance pay, Bernhard bought her own camera equipment. By the late-1920s, while living in Manhattan, Bernhard was heavily involved in the lesbian sub-culture of the artistic community, becoming friends with photographer Berenice Abbott and her lover, critic Elizabeth McCausland. Her first realization that she was attracted to other women occurred on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1928 when she met the painter Patti Light. She wrote about her &quot;bisexual escapades&quot; in her memoir. In 1934 Bernhard began photographing women in the nude. It would be this art form for which she would eventually become best known. In 1935, she chanced to meet Edward Weston on the beach in Santa Monica. She would later say;

Bernhard was so inspired by Weston&#x27;s work that, after meeting him in 1935, she moved to California (where he lived). In 1939, Bernhard moved back to New York for eight years, during which time she met photographer Alfred Stieglitz.

Bernhard was inspired by the small things in her life. In an interview from 1999 with Photographers Forum, Ruth states,&quot; I’m most interested in—the little things that nobody observes, that nobody thinks are of any value&quot;. In the same interview she stated that,&quot;Everything is universal&quot; and that she was &quot;very much aware of that&quot;. This idea of minimalism drove her passion for photography.

In 1934 Ruth received a commission from the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) to photograph works for the &quot;Machine Art&quot; exhibition catalog. Her father Lucian Bernhard set up the meeting with MoMA for her. 

== Life on the West Coast ==
By 1944 she had met and became involved with artist and designer Eveline (Evelyn) Phimister. The two moved in together, and remained together for the next ten years in Carmel, California. Here, Bernhard worked with Group f/64. Soon, finding Carmel a difficult place in which to earn a living, they moved to Hollywood where she fashioned a career as a commercial photographer. In 1953, they moved to San Francisco where she became a colleague of photographers such as Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Minor White, and Wynn Bullock.

Most of Bernhard&#x27;s work is studio-based, ranging from simple still lifes to complex nudes. In the 1940s she worked with the conchologist Jean Schwengel. She worked almost exclusively in black-and-white, though there are rumours that she had done some color work as well. She also is known for her lesbian themed works, most notably &quot;Two Forms&quot; (1962). In that work, a black woman and a white woman who were real-life lovers are featured with their nude bodies pressed against one another.

A departure was a collaboration with Melvin Van Peebles (as &quot;Melvin Van&quot;), then a young cable car gripman (driver) in San Francisco. Van Peebles wrote the text and Bernhard took the unposed photographs for &quot;The Big Heart&quot;, a book about life on the cable cars.

In the early 1980s, Bernhard started to work with Carol Williams, owner of Photography West Gallery in Carmel, California. Bernhard told Williams that she knew there would be a book of her photography after her death, but hoped one could be published during her lifetime. Williams approached New York Graphics Society, and several other photographic book publishers, but was advised that &quot;only Ansel Adams could sell black-and-white photography books.&quot; Bernhard and Williams decided to sell five limited edition prints to raise the necessary funds to publish a superior quality book of Ruth Bernhard nudes. The ensuing edition was produced by David Gray Gardner of Gardner Lithograph, (also the printer of Adams&#x27;s books) and was called &quot;The Eternal Body&quot;. It won Photography Book of the Year in 1986 from Friends of Photography. This book was often credited by Ruth Bernhard as being an immeasurable help to her future career and public recognition. The Eternal Body was reprinted by Chronicle Books and later as a deluxe limited Centennial Edition in celebration of Ruth Bernhard&#x27;s 100th birthday in October 2005. Carol Williams credited Ruth Bernhard with encouraging her to venture into book publishing, and later published several other photographic monographs.

In the 1980s Bernhard also started to work with Joe Folberg. Folberg bought Vision Gallery from Douglas Elliott (who founded it in 1979) in San Francisco in 1982. Bernhard and Folberg worked together until Folberg&#x27;s death. The gallery split with Debra Heimerdinger taking over operations in North America and Folberg&#x27;s son Neil moving the &quot;Vision Gallery&quot; to Jerusalem.

In 1967, Bernhard began a teaching career. This same year, Bernhard met United States Air Force Colonel Price Rice, an African American man ten years younger than her, and the two became lovers. They would remain together until his death in 1999. In her 90s, Bernhard cooperated with biographer Margaretta K. Mitchell in the book &quot;Ruth Bernhard, Between Art and Life&quot;, publicly revealing her many affairs with women and men throughout her lifetime.

In 1984 Ruth worked with filmmaker Robert Burrill on her autobiographic film entitled, &quot;Illuminations: Ruth Bernhard, Photographer&quot;. The film premièred in 1989 at the Kabuki Theater in San Francisco and on local PBS station KQED in 1991.

Bernhard was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Caucus for Art in 1981. Bernhard was hailed by Ansel Adams as &quot;the greatest photographer of the nude&quot;.

Bernhard died in San Francisco at age 101.

<text>John Stanislaus Joyce (17 December 1884 – 16 June 1955) was an Irish teacher, scholar, diarist and writer who lived for many years in Trieste. He was the younger brother of James Joyce. He was generally known as Stanislaus Joyce to distinguish him from his father, who shared the same name.

==Early life==
Born in County Dublin, Stanislaus was considered a &quot;whetstone&quot; by his more famous brother, who shared his ideas and his books with him. He was three years younger than James, and a constant boyhood companion. Stanislaus rebelled against his native Ireland as his brother had done, and, in 1905, he joined James&#x27;s household in Trieste on Via Caterina, 1.

==Career==
Joyce worked as an English-language teacher in the Berlitz School alongside his brother. In 1903, he had already begun to keep a diary that recorded his own thoughts on philosophical and literary matter as well as those of his brother; he later resumed this diary in Trieste. This &quot;Book of Days&quot;, as he called it, sheds light on James Joyce&#x27;s life between the years 1906 and 1909. The diary indicates that Stanislaus, truly &quot;his brother&#x27;s keeper&quot;, was called upon to rescue his brother from financial difficulties time and time again. After 1908, he maintained his own address, although he may have lived with his brother again for a time in 1909.
Arrested as a subversive on 28 December 1914, at the beginning of World War I, he was interned by the Austrians at Katzenau, near Linz. After his release, he moved in with his sister Eileen&#x27;s family. Stanislaus took his brother&#x27;s teaching position at Trieste&#x27;s Scuola Superiore di Commercio &quot;Revoltella&quot; in 1920; this school later became assimilated into the University of Trieste and he continued on as a non-tenured professor of English until his death. Due to his anti-Fascist views, Stanislaus moved to Florence sometime in 1941, where he may have been protected from the Germans by various wealthy Italian and American families.

==Books==
Joyce later published &quot;Recollections of James Joyce&quot; (1950); published after his death on 16 June (&quot;Bloomsday&quot;) were &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; (1957), &quot;Dublin Diary&quot; (1962), and &quot;Complete Dublin Diary&quot; (1971). In the 1950s, Stanislaus had also assisted Richard Ellmann, his brother&#x27;s biographer, with Ellmann&#x27;s monumental &quot;James Joyce&quot; (1959). He also wrote an introduction for the translated version of Italo Svevo&#x27;s &quot;As A Man Grows Older&quot;.

Stanislaus often fought with his brother, as well as with his brother&#x27;s wife Nora Barnacle, but they shared a common literary philosophy despite the fact that Stanislaus had received less advanced schooling than his brother. Stanislaus, however, channelled these instincts into sober academic study rather than wild flights of literary fancy. Of his brother, Stanislaus wrote, 
 It seems to me little short of a miracle that anyone should have striven to cultivate poetry or cared to get in touch with the current of European thought while living in a household such as ours, typical as it was of the squalor of a drunken generation. Some inner purpose transfigured him.

==Personal life==
On 13 August 1928 Stanislaus married Nelly Lichtensteiger. They had one son, James, who was born in February 1943.

==Death==
Stanislaus died in the Free Territory of Trieste, and is buried in Trieste at the &quot;Via della Pace&quot; cemetery.

<doc id="1051149" wikidata="Q235525" url="?curid=1051149" title="Mary Kingsley">
<text>&quot;For the English novelist, see Mary St Leger Kingsley.&quot;

Mary Henrietta Kingsley (13 October 1862 – 3 June 1900) was an English ethnographer, writer and explorer who made numerous travels through West Africa and wrote several books on her experiences there. Historians have credited Kingsley&#x27;s work with helping to shape Western perceptions of the culture of Africa and colonialism.

== Early life ==
Kingsley was born in London on 13 October 1862, the daughter and oldest child of physician, traveller and writer George Kingsley and Mary Bailey. She came from a family of writers, as she was also the niece of novelists Charles Kingsley and Henry Kingsley. The family moved to Highgate less than a year after her birth, the same home where her brother Charles George R. (&quot;Charley&quot;) Kingsley was born in 1866, and by 1881 were living in Southwood House, Bexley in Kent.

Her father was a physician and worked for George Herbert, 13th Earl of Pembroke and other aristocrats and was frequently away from home on his excursions. During these voyages he collected information for his studies. Dr. Kingsley accompanied Lord Dunraven on a trip to North America from 1870 to 1875. During the trip, Dr. Kingsley was invited to accompany United States Army officer George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s expedition against the Sioux. The subsequent Battle of the Little Bighorn terrified the Kingsley family, but they were relieved to learn that bad weather had kept Dr. Kingsley from joining Custer. It is possible that her father&#x27;s views on the brutal treatment of Native Americans in the United States helped shape Mary&#x27;s later opinions on European colonialism in West Africa.

Mary Kingsley had little formal schooling compared to her brother, other than German lessons at a young age; because, at that time and at her level of society, education was not thought to be necessary for a girl. She did, however, have access to her father&#x27;s large library and loved to hear his stories of foreign countries. She did not enjoy novels that were deemed more appropriate for young ladies of the time, such as those by Jane Austen or Charlotte Brontë, but preferred books on the sciences and memoirs of explorers. In 1886, her brother Charley entered Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to read law; this allowed Mary to make several academic connections and a few friends.

There is little indication that Kingsley was raised Christian; instead, she was a self-proclaimed believer with, &quot;summed up in her own words [...] &#x27;an utter faith in God&#x27;&quot; and even identified strongly with what was described as &#x27;the African religion&#x27;. She is known for criticizing Christian missionaries and their work for supplanting pre-existing African cultures without proving any material benefits in return.

The 1891 England census finds Mary&#x27;s mother and her two children living at 7 Mortimer Road, Cambridge, where Charles is recorded as a BA Student at Law and Mary as a Student of Medicine. In her later years, Kingsley&#x27;s mother became ill, and she was expected to care for her well-being. Unable to leave her mother&#x27;s side, she was limited in her travel opportunities. Soon, her father was also bedridden with rheumatic fever following an excursion. 

Dr. Kingsley died in February 1892, and Mrs. Kingsley followed a few months later in April of the same year. &quot;Freed&quot; from her family responsibilities and with an inheritance of £8,600 to be split evenly with her brother, Kingsley was now able to travel as she had always dreamed.

== Travels in Africa ==

After a preliminary visit to the Canary Islands, Kingsley decided to travel to the west coast of Africa. Generally, the only non-African women who embarked on (often dangerous) journeys to Africa were the wives of missionaries, government officials, or explorers. Exploration had not been seen as a fitting role for English women, though this was changing under the influence of figures such as Isabella Bird and Marianne North. African women were surprised that a woman of Kingsley&#x27;s age was travelling without a man, as she was frequently asked why her husband was not accompanying her.

Kingsley landed in Sierra Leone on 17 August 1893 and from there travelled further to Luanda in Angola. She lived with local people, who taught her necessary surviving-skills for living in the wilderness, acted as luggage porters and guides for her travels, and gave her advice. She often went into dangerous areas alone. Her training as a nurse at the :de:Kaiserswerther Diakonie had prepared her for slight injuries and jungle maladies that she would later encounter. Kingsley returned to England in December 1893.

Upon her return, Kingsley secured support and aid from Dr. Albert Günther, a prominent zoologist at the British Museum, as well as a writing agreement with publisher George Macmillan, for she wished to publish her travel accounts.

She returned to Africa again on 23 December 1894 with more support and supplies from England, as well as increased self-assurance in her work. She longed to study &quot;cannibal&quot; people and their traditional religious practices, commonly referred to as &quot;fetish&quot; during the Victorian Era. In April, she became acquainted with Scottish missionary Mary Slessor, another European woman living among native African populations with little company and no husband. It was during her meeting with Slessor that Kingsley first became aware of the custom of twin killing, a custom which Slessor was determined to stop. The native people believed that one of the twins was the offspring of the devil who had secretly mated with the mother and since the innocent child was impossible to distinguish, both were killed and the mother was often killed as well for attracting the devil to impregnate her. Kingsley arrived at Slessor&#x27;s residence shortly after she had taken in a recent mother of twins and her surviving child.

Later in Gabon, Kingsley canoed up the Ogooué River, where she collected specimens of fish previously unknown to western science, three of which were later named after her. After meeting the Fang people and travelling through uncharted Fang territory, she daringly climbed the Mount Cameroon by a route not previously attempted by any other European. She moored her boat at Donguila.

==Return to England==
When she returned home in November 1895, Kingsley was greeted by journalists eager to interview her. The reports that were drummed up about her voyage, however, were most upsetting, as the papers portrayed her as a &quot;New Woman&quot;, an image which she did not embrace. Kingsley distanced herself from any feminist movement claims, arguing that women&#x27;s suffrage was &quot;a minor question; while there was a most vital section of men disenfranchised women could wait&quot;. Her consistent lack of identification with women&#x27;s rights movements may be attributed to a number of causes, such as the attempt to ensure that her work would be received more favorably; in fact, some insist this might be a direct reference to her belief in the importance of securing rights for British traders in West Africa.

Over the next three years, she toured England, giving lectures about life in Africa to a wide array of audiences. She was the first woman to address the Liverpool and Manchester chambers of commerce.

Kingsley upset the Church of England when she criticised missionaries for attempting to convert the people of Africa and corrupt their religions. In this regard, she discussed many aspects of African life that were shocking to English people, including polygamy, which, she argued was practiced out of necessity. After living with the African people, Kingsley became directly aware how their societies functioned and how prohibiting customs such as polygamy would be detrimental to their way of life. She knew that the typical African wives had too many tasks to manage alone. Missionaries in Africa often required converted men to abandon all but one of their wives, leaving the other women and children without the support of a husband – thus creating immense social and economic problems. Kingsley&#x27;s also criticised teetotal missionaries, suggesting that those who drank small quantities of alcohol had better survival rates.

Kingsley&#x27;s beliefs about cultural and economic imperialism are complex and widely debated by scholars today. Though, on the one hand, she regarded African people and cultures as those who needed protection and preservation, she also believed in the necessity of indirect rule and the adoption of European culture and technology by indigenous populations, insisting that there was some work in West Africa that had to be completed by white men. Yet in &quot;Studies in West Africa&quot; she writes: &quot;Although a Darwinian to the core, I doubt if evolution in a neat and tidy perpendicular line, with Fetish at the bottom and Christianity at the top, represents the true state of affairs.&quot; Other, more acceptable, beliefs were variously perceived and used in Western European society – by traders, colonists, women&#x27;s rights activists and others – and, articulated as they were in great style, helped shape popular perception of &quot;the African&quot; and &quot;his&quot; land.

== Writings ==

Kingsley wrote two books about her experiences: &quot;Travels in West Africa&quot; (1897), which was an immediate best-seller, and &quot;West African Studies&quot; (1899), both of which gained her respect and prestige within the scholarly community. Some newspapers, such as &quot;The Times&quot; under pro-imperialist editor Flora Shaw, refused to publish reviews of her works. Though some have argued that such refusals were grounded in the anti-imperialist arguments presented in Kingsley&#x27;s works, this unlikely explains her frequently unfavourable reception in Europe, because she was both a supporter of the activities of European traders in West Africa and of indirect rule.

The notable success of &quot;Travels in West Africa&quot; was due in no small part to the vigour and droll humour of her writing, that, in the guise of a ripping yarn, never wavers from its true purpose—to complete the work her father had left undone. Between poles of manifest wit and latent analysis Kingsley constructs in images – &quot;… not an artist&#x27;s picture, but a photograph, an overladen with detail, colourless version&quot; – a discourse of poetic thought; a phenomenon oft-noted in the texts of Walter Benjamin. Of her method she said: &quot;It is merely that I have the power of bringing out in my fellow-creatures, white or black, their virtues, in a way honourable to them and fortunate for me.&quot; Of her purpose she said: &quot;[M]y motive for going to West Africa was study; this study was that of native ideas and practices in religion and law. My reason for taking up this study was a desire to complete a great book my father, George Kingsley, had left at his death unfinished.&quot; Of her father she said: &quot;The work that he did seemed to promise a career of great brilliancy and distinction – a promise which, unfortunately, was never entirely fulfilled.&quot; In truth George Kingsley produced but a few scattered fragments, not a scrap of which found its way into the great book of Mary Kingsley. It is, rather, in the text of his daughter – a forerunner of Lévi-Strauss and his &quot;Tristes Tropiques&quot; – that the dream wish of the father is finally accomplished; and family honour sustained.

== Death ==

After the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Kingsley travelled to Cape Town on the SS &quot;Moor&quot; in March 1900, and volunteered as a nurse. She was stationed at Simon&#x27;s Town hospital, where she treated Boer prisoners of war. After contributing her services to the ill for about two months, she developed symptoms of typhoid and died on 3 June 1900. An eyewitness reported: &quot;She rallied for a short time but realised she was going. She asked to be left to die alone, saying she did not wish anyone to see her in her weakness. Animals she said, went away to die alone.&quot; In accordance with her wishes, she was buried at sea. &quot;This was, I believe, the only favour and distinction that she ever asked for herself; and it was accorded with every circumstance and honour ... A party of West Yorkshires, with band before them, drew the coffin from the hospital on a gun carriage to the pier … Torpedo Boat No. 29 put to sea and, rounding Cape Point, committed her to the element in which she had chosen to be laid.&quot; &quot;A touch of comedy, which would &#x27;have amused&#x27; Kingsley herself, was added when the coffin refused to sink and had to be hauled back on board then thrown over again weighed down this time with an anchor.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Kingsley&#x27;s tales and opinions of life in Africa helped draw attention to British imperial agendas abroad and the native customs of African people that were previously little discussed but misunderstood by people in Europe. The Fair Commerce Party formed soon after her death, pressuring for improved conditions for the natives of British colonies. Various reform associations were formed in her honour and helped facilitate governmental change. The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine founded an honorary medal in her name. In Sierra Leone, the Mary Kingsley Auditorium at the Institute of African Studies, Fourah Bay College (University of Sierra Leone), was named after her.

<text>Calder Highway is a rural highway in Australia, linking Mildura and the Victoria/New South Wales border to Bendigo, in North Central Victoria. South of Bendigo, where the former highway has been upgraded to freeway-standard, Calder Freeway links to Melbourne, subsuming former alignments of Calder Highway; the Victorian Government completed the conversion to freeway standard from Melbourne to Bendigo on 20 April 2009.

Calder Alternate Highway connects to Calder Highway at either end – just north of Ravenswood, and at Marong – and provides a bypass west of Bendigo.

==Route==
Calder Highway commences at the intersection with Silver City Highway in Curlwaa (officially a branch of Silver City Highway, yet sign-posted as Calder Highway) and crosses the Murray River into Victoria over the Abbotsford Bridge, then continues in a southeasterly direction as a two-lane, single carriageway rural highway through Merbein and intersects with Sturt Highway just outside the major regional town of Mildura, where widens to a four-lane, dual-carriageway road through southern Mildura and Irymple, in the state&#x27;s north-west. It narrows back to a two-lane single carriageway road and continues in a southerly direction, meeting Mallee Highway at Ouyen, then in a south-easterly direction through Sea Lake, Wycheproof, Charlton and meeting the northern end of Calder Alternative Highway at Marong eventually to the western suburbs of Bendigo, where it widens to a four-lane, dual-carriageway road as it weaves through the rural city, intersecting with Loddon Valley Highway and meeting with Midland Highway, where it narrows back to a single carriageway road and shares a concurrency through south-western Bendigo, widening again to a dual carriageway through Kangaroo Flat to eventually meet the southern end of Calder Alternative Highway at an interchange in Ravenswood.

Calder Highway becomes Calder Freeway at the Ravenswood interchange and continues in southerly direction as a four-lane, dual-carriageway rural freeway which bypasses the towns along the highway&#x27;s former alignment. Calder Freeway passes Harcourt - where the shared concurrency with Midland Highway ends, as it travels in a south-westerly direction to the major regional centres of Castlemaine, Ballarat, and Geelong - and continues in a south-easterly direction past Elphinstone, Kyneton, Woodend and Gisborne, to reach the western suburban fringe of Melbourne. It continues in a south-easterly, and then easterly, direction past Calder Park Raceway and Keilor, before eventually terminating at an interchange with Tullamarine Freeway at Airport West.

Within the urban section of Calder Freeway (between Kings Road and Tullamarine Freeway), the standard travel time, in each direction, is 10 minutes; 5 minutes between Kings Road and the Western Ring Road and 5 minutes between the Ring Road and Tullamarine Freeway.

Between Red Cliffs and Wycheproof the highway has a speed limit of 110 km/h.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Country Roads Act of 1912&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria provided for the establishment of the Country Roads Board (later VicRoads) and their ability to declare Main Roads, taking responsibility for the management, construction and care of the state&#x27;s major roads from local municipalities. (Melbourne-) Bendigo Road was declared a Main Road over a period of months, from 30 December 1913 (Castlemaine via Harcourt to Ravenswood), to 30 November 1914 (from Keilor through Diggers Rest to Gisborne, and from Woodend through Kyneton and Elphinstone to Castlemaine), to 20 September 1915 (from Ravenswood to Bendigo); (Ouyen-) Sea Lake Road from Ouyen to Mittyack, (Ouyen-) Mildura Road from Ouyen to Hattah, and Wycheproof-Sea Lake Road from Wycheproof to Sea Lake were declared Main Roads on 14 December 1914; and (Charlton-)Wycheproof Road between Charlton and Wycheproof was declared a Main Road on 28 May 1915; and Charlton-(Bridgewater-)Bendigo Road was declared a Main Road, between Bridgewater and Wedderburn to Charlton on 28 May 1915, and between Bendigo and Bridgewater on 20 September 1915.

The passing of the &quot;Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924&quot; provided for the declaration of State Highways, roads two-thirds financed by the State government through the Country Roads Board. North Western Highway was declared a State Highway on 1 July 1925, cobbled from a collection of roads from Melbourne through Kyneton, Castlemaine, Bendigo, Sea Lake and Ouyen to Mildura (for a total of 324 miles), subsuming the original declarations of Melbourne-Bendigo Road, Charlton-Bridgewater-Bendigo Road, Charlton-Wycheproof Road, Wycheproof-Sea Lake Road, Ouyen-Sea Lake Road and Ouyen-Mildura Road as Main Roads. North-Western Highway was renamed Calder Highway in 1928, after William Calder, chairman of the Country Roads Board from 1913–28. In the 1959/60 financial year, another section from Elphinstone to Harcourt was added as a deviation bypassing Castlemaine, along the former Elphinstone–Harcourt Road (already having been declared a Main Road by the Country Roads Board in 1937/38 financial year); the previous alignments of Calder Highway from Elphinstone to Castlemaine, and Castlemaine to Harcourt, were subsumed into Pyrenees Highway and Midland Highway respectively. The first section of Calder Freeway in Melbourne was opened in 1972, over time stretching west to ultimately become a project to convert the road to freeway standard all the way to Bendigo; the freeway upgrade has made sections of the original Calder Highway redundant, either incorporated into the new freeway or acting as local access roads. Calder Alternative Highway was declared in 9 May 1983, along the former Ravenswood–Marong Road.

Calder Highway was later signed National Route 79 in 1955; when Midland Highway was allocated State Route 149 in 1986, it shared it as a concurrency along Calder Highway between Harcourt and Bendigo. With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s this was altered to route A79 for the highway portion, and route M79 for the freeway portion into Melbourne (and the concurrency with Midland Highway was replaced with route A300); the New South Wales section was left unallocated when they switched to the alphanumeric system in 2013. Calder Alternative Highway was signed Alternative National Route 79 between Ravenswood and Marong, and was later replaced by route A790.

Originally, Calder Highway ran through northwestern Melbourne as an undivided highway, ultimately through Niddrie as Keilor Road and terminating in Essendon; traffic continued south along Mount Alexander Road to reach central Melbourne. Keilor Road – already heavily congested and supporting a tram line – was eventually bypassed by a freeway-standard road in 1972 to terminate at a junction with Lancefield Road (later upgraded to Tullamarine Freeway), rejoining Calder Highway at the western end of Niddrie; the freeway-standard was extended further west to East Keilor (the future location of the Western Ring Road interchange) in 1975, and to Keilor by the early 1980s. However, it was not until the 1990s that work began to duplicate the rest of the highway to Bendigo.

The Howard government broadened the criteria under which roads qualify for Commonwealth road funding by introducing &quot;Roads of National Importance&quot; program in the 1996–97 financial year where such declarations were based on the recognition that roads outside the National Highway system also provide social benefits, and were funded jointly with the States and Territories usually on a 50:50 basis. As a major road link between Melbourne, Bendigo, and the state&#x27;s northwest, supporting the region&#x27;s primary manufacturing and tourism industries, Calder Highway was declared a Road of National Importance between Melbourne and Bendigo in December 1996.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared the road as Calder Alternative Highway (Arterial #6200) between Ravenswood and Marong, and in 2011 as Calder Highway (Arterial #6530) between the border with New South Wales at Yelta and the interchange with Calder Alternate Highway and Ravenswood Street in Ravenswood, and as Calder Freeway (Freeway #1530) between Ravenswood and Tullamarine Freeway, Airport West.

===1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan===
The Calder Highway between the Melton Highway and the Western Ring Road is shown in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as part of the F4 Freeway corridor, which extends past the Tullamarine Freeway and Bell Street to Templestowe.

==Upgrades==
===Western Ring Road to Kings Road===
In 2008, VicRoads completed the widening of the Calder Freeway from the Western Ring Road to Melton Highway. The road was widened from 2 lanes each direction to 3 lanes in each direction. The speed limit was reduced permanently from 100 km/h to 80 km/h. The 80 km/h limit applies northbound from Keilor Park Drive to Melton Highway, and southbound it applies from the Green Gully Road bridge to just prior to the Western Ring Road interchange. In October 2010, it was announced that as part of a year long trial, the speed limit on this section of freeway will be increased back to 100 km/h in off-peak times (8pm-5am), with 30 variable speed limits to be installed along the stretch of freeway. A further upgrade completed in 2012 resulted in a new interchange at Kings Road (the freeways&#x27;s urban / metropolitan limits) and closure of three at grade intersections in the area. Despite these upgrades the 80 km/h speed limit remained in place.

<text>The &quot;Forma Urbis Romae&quot; or Severan Marble Plan is a massive marble map of ancient Rome, created under the emperor Septimius Severus between AD 203 and 211. Matteo Cadario gives specific years of 205–208, noting that the map was based on property records.

==Description==

It originally measured 18 m (60 ft) wide by 13 m (45 ft) high and was carved into 150 Proconnesian marble slabs mounted on an interior wall of the Temple of Peace.

Created at a scale of approximately 1 to 240 (Cadario states 1:260 to 1:270), the map was detailed enough to show the floor plans of nearly every temple, bath, and &quot;insula&quot; in the central Roman city. 

The map was oriented with south at the top. On the map are names and plans of public buildings, streets, and private homes. The creators used signs and details like columns and staircases.

The Plan was gradually destroyed during the Middle Ages, with the marble stones being used as building materials or for making lime. In 1562, the young antiquarian sculptor Giovanni Antonio Dosio excavated fragments of the &quot;Forma Urbis&quot; from a site near the Church of SS. Cosma e Damiano, under the direction of the humanist &quot;condottiere&quot; Torquato Conti, who had purchased excavation rights from the canons of the church. Conti made a gift of the recovered fragments to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, who entrusted them to his librarian Onofrio Panvinio and his antiquarian Fulvio Orsini. Little interest seems to have been elicited by the marble shards.

In all about 10% of the original surface area of the plan has since been recovered in the form of over one thousand marble fragments.

Part of the excavated plan showed a portion of the Forum of Augustus, interpreted as &quot;a working drawing or as a proof of the existence of a more ancient &quot;Forma Urbis&quot;.&quot;

==Projects==
Piecing together the surviving fragments of the plan is an activity that has engrossed scholars for centuries. Renaissance scholars managed to match and identify around 250 of the pieces, usually by recognizing famous landmarks such as the Colosseum and the Circus Maximus. In the second half of the 20th century, thanks to the works and publications of Guglielmo Gatti, Lucos Cozza, and Emilio Rodríguez Almeida, several fragments of the plan have been identified and located. Other scholars (e.g. Claudia Cecamore, Filippo Coarelli, Daniele Manacorda, Domenico Palombi, Luigi Pedroni, and others) have re-interpreted the topography depicted on many fragments. A research project at Stanford University in 2002 had some success in positioning four fragments and in reassembling nine fragments with pattern recognition algorithms. Using archaeological and literary sources, since 1996 Pier Luigi Tucci (Johns Hopkins University) has positioned twenty-four fragments in five Augustan regions and has offered new interpretations of the area of the AQVEDVCTIVM on the Caelian hill, of the Republican building in &quot;opus incertum&quot; at Testaccio (with Lucos Cozza), and of the area of the Circus Flaminius (in particular, the ship of Aeneas and the earlier marble plan from the Via Anicia).

A new piece of &quot;Forma Urbis Romae&quot; that completes the words &quot;Circus Flaminius&quot; was uncovered in 2014 at the Palazzo Maffei Marescotti, a building owned by the Vatican.

The Forma Urbis has gone on display in 2024 under a glass floor at the new Museum of the Forma Urbis near the Colosseum. It is part of a bigger project of the Archaeological Park of the Celio to develop the area around the Roman Forum, Palatine Hill and Colosseum.

<doc id="1051157" wikidata="Q7747893" url="?curid=1051157" title="The Living Shadow">
<text>The Living Shadow was the first pulp novel to feature The Shadow. Written by Walter B. Gibson, it was submitted for publication as &quot;Murder in the Next Room&quot; on January 23, 1931, and published as &quot;The Living Shadow&quot; in the April 1, 1931 issue of &quot;The Shadow Magazine&quot;. This story introduces the literary version, as opposed to the radio version, of The Shadow.

==Publishing history==
Because of this story&#x27;s significance as the first Shadow story, it has been reprinted more times than any other Shadow tale; the reprintings include:
* Street and Smith, &quot;The Ideal Library&quot; hardcover, 1931
* &quot;The Shadow Magazine&quot; 1942 Annual 
* Bantam Books mass-market paperback, 1969
* Pyramid Books mass-market paperback, 1974
* Jove Books mass-market paperback, 1977
* Amazon kindle edition ebook, 2021

==Summary==
*Shadow Disguises: himself, Fritz the janitor, various street people in Chinatown, Ling Chow, English Johnny. 
*Shadow Agents: Harry Vincent, Claude Fellows. 
*Villains: Ezekiel Bingham, Steve Cronin, Diamond Bert Farwell. 
*Other Characters: Joe Cardona. 
*Plot: Harry Vincent, saved from suicide by The Shadow, is recruited to watch Scanlon, courier for Wang Foo, the Chinatown mastermind. Cronin murders Scanlon, but fails to find the metal Chinese disk Scanlon uses as an identifier. Vincent finds the disk, poses as the courier, is exposed, captured, tortured, and saved by The Shadow. Millionaire Geoffrey Laidlow is killed for his hidden jewels; the rest of the story involves searching for Laidlow&#x27;s killer, and the killer searching for the jewels, to be fenced with the Chinatown mastermind. In the end, the criminal mastermind&#x27;s lawyer Ezekiel Bingham, is free and unpunished. Diamond Bert Farwell, exposed as Wang Foo, goes to jail.

==Notes==
* Firsts: The Shadow, agents Harry Vincent and Claude Fellows, Detective Joe Cardona, gunman Steve Cronin.
* Firsts: The Shadow’s Fritz the janitor identity, The Shadow as a master of disguise.
* Firsts: The Shadow&#x27;s cloak and slouch hat, sanctum, messages written in disappearing blue ink, girasol ring, mysterious laugh, verbal messages with emphasized words, organizing written clues, Thursday radio program (Street and Smith&#x27;s &quot;Detective Story Hour&quot; on CBS and narrated at that time by &quot;The Shadow&quot;).
* Diamond Bert Farwell returns in &quot;The Chinese Disks&quot; (Nov 1, 1934).
* The cover for this issue of the pulp magazine features a frightened Chinese man. The cover image was originally published on the October 1, 1919 issue of the pulp &quot;The Thrill Book&quot;. Gibson was asked to work a Chinatown angle into &quot;The Living Shadow&quot; so the cover could be used on the inaugural issue of &quot;The Shadow Magazine&quot;. The suggestion proved to be beneficial to the Shadow mythology; many Shadow stories used a Chinatown setting.</text><links>

<text>Fred Langdon Bradley (July 31, 1920 – April 24, 2012) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball who played in and for the Chicago White Sox. Listed at , 180 lb., he batted and threw right-handed. Bradley was one of many baseball players whose career was interrupted during World War II.

Bradley was signed by the New York Yankees in 1940 and immediately was assigned to their minor league system. In 1941 and 1942, he averaged 15 wins per season before joining the U.S. Navy in 1943.

Following his military discharge, Bradley pitched in the Yankees&#x27; AAA system during 1946 and 1947. In 1948 he was dealt by New York, along Aaron Robinson and Bill Wight, to the White Sox in exchange for Eddie Lopat.

In 1948 Bradley posted a 4.60 earned run average in eight relief appearances for the White Sox and did not have a decision. He opened 1949 in the minor leagues and made one start with Chicago in May, after which he returned to the minors for two more seasons.

Bradley went 0–0 with a 5.60 ERA in nine games, allowing eleven earned runs on 15 hits and seven walks while striking out two in 17⅔ innings of work. In a six-year minor league career, he went 61–52 with a 3.63 ERA in 172 games.

<text>Libby Prison was a Confederate prison at Richmond, Virginia, during the American Civil War. In 1862 it was designated to hold officer prisoners from the Union Army, taking in numbers from the nearby Seven Days battles (in which nearly 16,000 Union men and officers had been killed, wounded, or captured between June 25 and July 1 alone) and other conflicts of the Union&#x27;s Peninsular campaign to take Richmond and end the war only a year after it had begun. As the conflict wore on the prison gained an infamous reputation for the overcrowded and harsh conditions. Prisoners suffered high mortality from disease and malnutrition. By 1863, one thousand prisoners were crowded into large open rooms on two floors, with open, barred windows leaving them exposed to weather and temperature extremes.

The building was built before the war as a tobacco warehouse and then used for food and groceries before being converted to a prison. In 1889, Charles F. Gunther moved the structure to Chicago and renovated it as a war museum. In 1899 the building was torn down and sold for scrap.

==History==

The prison was located in a three-story brick tobacco warehouse on two levels on Tobacco Row at the waterfront of the James River. In 1861 was leased by Capt. Luther Libby and his son George W. Libby. They operated a ship&#x27;s chandlery and grocery business.

The Confederate government started to use the facility as a hospital and prison in late 1861. In 1862 they reserved it to hold Union officers because of the influx of prisoners. It contained eight low-ceilinged rooms, each 103 by 42 feet (31.4 by 12.5 metres). The second and third floors were used to house prisoners. Windows were barred and open to the elements, increasing the discomfort of occupants. Lack of sanitation and overcrowding caused diseases. From holding 700 prisoners in 1862, by 1863 the facility far exceeded the maximum capacity of 1,000. Mortality rates were high in 1863 and 1864, aggravated by Confederate shortages of food and supplies. Because of the high death toll, Libby Prison is generally regarded as second only in notoriety to Andersonville Prison in Georgia.

In 1863, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a description of &quot;the Libby&quot; from a purported prisoner diary entry. The next year, Kentucky Volunteer Infantry Captain I.N. Johnston, who escaped from Libby Prison, attempted to corroborate the article. (He testified that &quot;...an African slave...did all in his power to restore us to freedom and home.&quot;

He wrote &quot;...the building is of brick, with a front of near one hundred and forty feet, and one hundred feet deep. It is divided into nine rooms; the ceilings are low, and ventilation imperfect; the windows are barred, through which the windings of James River and the tents of Belle Isle may be seen. Its immediate surroundings are far from being agreeable; the sentinels pacing the streets constantly are unpleasant reminders that your stay is not a matter of choice; and were it so, few would choose it long as a boarding-house.&quot;

In March 1864, Union worries about the safety of Richmond and related security of the prisons, and the scarcity of resources peaked. The next month, Union officer Harland Richardson pleaded &quot;once more&quot; for a &quot;Mr. Reilly,&quot; presumably on behalf of the U.S. War Department, to send provisions to Libby. Such requests were either delayed by Libby commandants or ignored, as the U.S. War Department funneled supplies into active Union lines. 

Confederates permitted a one-time Union shipment as their own provisions dwindled. During the late spring and summer, they evacuated most prisoners-of-war from Richmond to Macon, Georgia. Enlisted men were transferred to Andersonville while the officers housed at Libby would transfer to a new prison in Macon. From April to August 1864, Libby continued to be used, mostly as a place for temporary confinement of Union officers and a small number of Confederate military criminals. On September 18, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that approximately 230 Union officers remained in Libby Prison. 

Due to the Siege of Petersburg and the transfer of more prisoners-of-war, the number of inmates (officers and non-officers alike) surged. In autumn 1864, as the &quot;New York Times&quot; published President Lincoln&#x27;s endorsement of the U.S. Sanitary Commission&#x27;s &quot;inquiry&quot; into Confederate prison conditions and Union officer &quot;martyrdom,&quot; Richmond dailies continued to report a resurgence of incarcerated numbers at Libby Prison. On October 10, 1864, the &quot;Richmond Sentinel&quot; reported on the arrival of &quot;one thousand five hundred and fifty two Yankee prisoners&quot; at Libby, 1114 of which &quot;were sent to Salisbury, North Carolina, yesterday, in order to make room for other prisoners expected to arrive here&quot; (438 of these prisoners remained in Libby). 

On October 14, according to Confederate prison records, officers corresponded on the fate of 82 out of 148 &quot;Colored Troops&quot; recently arrived at Libby Prison, bringing the total number of Union inmates to almost one thousand. Lieutenant-General Ewell ordered &quot;all negroes on hand not employed about the prison&quot; turned over to &quot;Brigadier-General Barton for work on the fortifications.&quot; The commandant believed that the troops &quot;seemed pleased at being released from prison to be put to work,&quot; joining an additional &quot;sixty-eight negro soldiers [who] were sent to the works on the 2d instant. These negroes were captured at Petersburg July 30, 1864. Eleven of them are free; the rest are slaves.&quot; The remainder of the &quot;U.S. Colored Troops,&quot; 66 in total, either had perished or could not physically depart from Libby Prison due to ailments and wounds. Any wages for black prisoners &quot;employed about the prison&quot; and additional wages for fortification construction, aside from &quot;a day&#x27;s rations,&quot; remain subjects of scholarly inquiry.

Union officer petitions for assistance, written in advance of prisoner exchanges or before the officers died, indicated mass suffering and deteriorating conditions within the already deplorable Libby. Newspapers on both sides of the war denounced atrocities ostensibly committed against prisoners by oppositional governments and prison commandants. Impulses and goals for these Richmond dailies&#x27; Union prisoner-of-war tallies remain subjects of scholarly inquiry. On March 30, 1865, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a summation of Union captive numbers in Libby Prison, as well as the conditions of confinement, less than two weeks before the Battle of Appomattox Court House. The New York newspaper based its findings on the foregoing Richmond dailies and additional testimony.

After the occupation of Richmond in 1865, Union authorities used Libby Prison for detention of former Confederate officers. They reportedly improved conditions over those that had been common for Union officers, or prisoners of war on both sides generally during the war.

In April 1865, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln visited Richmond, Virginia and toured the city on foot. When he came across Libby Prison, a crowd of onlookers stated &quot;We will tear it down&quot;, to which Lincoln replied, &quot;No, leave it as a monument.&quot;

In 1880, the building was purchased by Southern Fertilizer Company. In 1889 , it was bought by Charles F. Gunther, a candymaker. He had the building disassembled, and moved to downtown Chicago. There it was rebuilt to serve as a war museum. In 1899, after the museum failed to draw enough crowds, the building was dismantled and was sold in pieces as scrap.

== Prisoner conditions ==

Upon their release from Libby a group of Union surgeons published an account in 1863 of their experiences treating Libby inmates in the attached hospital:

Thus we have over ten per cent of the whole number of prisoners held classed as sick men, who need the most assiduous and skilful attention; yet, in the essential matter of rations, they are receiving nothing but corn bread and sweet potatoes. Meat is no longer furnished to any class of our prisoners except to the few officers in Libby hospital, and all sick or well officers or privates are now furnished with a very poor article of corn bread in place of wheat bread, unsuitable diet for hospital patients prostrated with diarrhea, dysentery and fever, to say nothing of the balance of startling instances of individual suffering and horrid pictures of death from protracted sickness and semi-starvation we have had thrust upon our observation.

They said that prisoners were always asking for more food and that many were only half clad. Newly arriving prisoners who were already ill often died quickly, even in one night. Due to the &quot;systematic abuse, neglect and semi-starvation,&quot; the surgeons believed that thousands of men would be left &quot;permanently broken down in their [bodily] constitutions&quot; if they survived. In one story they noted that 200 wounded prisoners brought in from the Battle of Chickamauga had been given only a few hard crackers during their three days&#x27; journey, but suffered two more days in the prison without medical attention or food.

An article in the &quot;Daily Richmond Enquirer&quot; vividly described prison conditions in 1864:

Libby takes in the captured Federals by scores, but lets none out; they are huddled up and jammed into every nook and corner; at the bathing troughs, around the cooking stoves, everywhere there is a wrangling, jostling crowd; at night the floor of every room they occupy in the building is covered, every square inch of it, by uneasy slumberers, lying side by side, and heel to head, as tightly packed as if the prison were a huge, improbable box of nocturnal sardines.
Lieut. Colonel Federico Fernández Cavada, who belonged to the Hot Air Balloon Unit of the Union Army, was captured during the Battle of Gettysburg and sent to Libby. Released in 1864, Fernandez Cavada later that year published a book titled &quot;LIBBY LIFE: Experiences of A Prisoner of War in Richmond, VA, 1863-64&quot;, in which he told of the cruel treatment in the Confederate prison.

In the introduction, Cavada wrote:

It was a beautiful country through which we had just passed, but it had presented no charms to weary eyes that were compelled to view it through a line of hostile bayonets; we felt but little sympathy for the beautiful; on our haggard countenances only this was written: &quot;Give us rest, and food.&quot;

Cavada published his narrative before 1865. Former Union prisoners also published memoirs after the surrender at Appomattox in April 1865. According to a Southern source printed after the war:
Such [post-1865] memoirs should be read in context, however. After the war, former Union prisoners were not granted pensions unless they had also sustained injuries or suffered from disease during their service. To muster support for their plight, the veterans mounted a public-relations campaign that included wildly sensationalistic &quot;recollections&quot; owing much to the dime novels of the &quot;Wild West.&quot; When the United States government granted universal pensions beginning in 1890, these memoirs virtually disappeared.

== The Libby Chronicle ==

(&quot;The Libby Chronicle,&quot; edited by Louis Beaudry, Albany, NY)

The &quot;Libby Chronicle&quot; was a newsletter written by the inmates of Libby during the summer of 1863; it was read aloud by the editor every Friday morning. Composed in the midst of hardship and brutality, the newsletter expressed irreverent humor.

Issue number two included a poem entitled &quot;Castle Thunder,&quot; with a &quot;dryly witty perspective&quot; on prison life:

&lt;poem&gt;
We have eighteen kinds of food, though &#x27;twill stagger your belief,
Because we have bread, beef and soup, then bread, soup and beef;
Then we sep&#x27;rate around with&#x27;bout twenty in a group,
And thus we get beef, soup and bread, and beef, bread and soup;
For dessert we obtain, though it costs us nary red,
Soup, bread and beef, (count it well) and beef and soup and bread.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Such poems helped keep up morale among the prisoners. The following week&#x27;s issue begins with a segment called &quot;Encore,&quot; which reads, &quot;Yielding to pressing demand from those who heard and from many who did not hear the poem entitled &#x27;Castle Thunder,&#x27; we reproduce it this week. We are certain that the uproarious laughter caused by this facetious article . . . has done more good in Libby than cartloads of Confederate medicine.&quot;

Commonly expressed was hostility toward President Abraham Lincoln, whom they considered responsible for their being held so long in prison. The editors of &quot;The Chronicle&quot; rebuked such sentiments, saying, &quot;these officers evince more the spirit of spoiled children than that of manly courage and intelligence which should characterize the actions of the American soldier.&quot;

Men made independent efforts to secure their release. For instance, one young surgeon wrote a letter to the editor of the &quot;Richmond Sentinel,&quot; promising that if he were released he would find the editor&#x27;s &quot;Rebel son&quot; and look after him until he could be returned home. &quot;Chronicle&quot; editors reported that &quot;this same officer was poltroon enough to offer to leave the Federal army if the Confederates would do something for him. But the Rebels didn&#x27;t want the poor Judas, and he finds he has eaten dirt without advantage.&quot;

== Escape from Libby ==

During the second week of February 1864, 109 Union officers took part in what was later dubbed by the press as the Libby Prison escape. Captain Morton Tower of Company B, 13th Mass. Infantry, wrote in his published memoirs about his successful escape: &quot;On the night of February 9th, as soon as it was sufficiently dark, the exodus from the prison commenced. Major Hamilton, Col. Thomas E. Rose, and some of the projectors were the first to pass through. Col. Davis of the 4th Maine and myself had passed through the tunnel to the yard just as the clocks of Richmond were striking twelve. Near daybreak we reached a thicket of woods where we stopped to rest.&quot; Capt. Tower and Col. Davis eluded recapture and soon joined 57 other escapees who also made it to the Union lines.(&quot;Army Experience of Morton Tower- his escape from Libby Prison&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of Capt. Morton Tower&quot;, June 1870)

The &quot;Charleston Mercury&quot; carried the story:

(&quot;Particulars of the Escape of the Yankee Officers from the Libby Prison&quot;, The &quot;Charleston Mercury&quot;, February 16, 1864)

Three tunnels were built: the first ran into water and was abandoned. The second hit the building&#x27;s log foundation. The third reached a small carriage shed 15 m (50 ft) away. Escapes were regular occurrences at both Federal and Confederate prisons.

== Letters from Libby ==
&quot;The Christian Recorder&quot; and other papers, from both Republican and divided states, sometimes included letters from prisoners prior to the fall of Richmond in early April 1865. The rules of Libby Prison limited men to six lines for their letters to family and friends. Here is an example:

&quot;My Dear Wife. - Yours received - no hopes of exchange - send corn starch - want socks - no money - rheumatism in left shoulder - pickles very good - send sausages - God bless you - kiss the baby - Hail Columbia! - Your devoted husband.&quot;

==After the war==
As of March 1888, an effort was underway by a Chicago syndicate to relocate Libby Prison to Chicago, said one period newspaper, &quot;where it will be kept as a curiosity.&quot; In 1907, nails from Libby prison were melted down and used to cast the Pokahuntas Bell for the Jamestown Exposition. The front door of Libby Prison is displayed in the American Civil War Museum, located at the former Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond.
In the context of what historian Benjamin Wetzel referred to as &quot;a growing body of scholarship that questions the reconciliationist narrative&quot;, scholars have explored how Union widows, sisters, and cousins, in both correspondence and verse, lamented the deaths and &quot;changes&quot; in survivor psychology and physiology that resulted from Libby Prison confinement. In addition, Theodore Roosevelt supported and convened the Republican and then Progressive (Bull Moose) Parties&#x27; national conventions at the Chicago Coliseum, the former Libby Prison museum site that continued to feature the prison façade.

==In popular culture==
* A melodramatic  Broadway play about the escape entitled &quot;A Fair Rebel&quot;, by Harry P. Mawson, premiered in New York City in August 1891. In 1914, a 3-reel silent film version was released starring Linda Arvidson, Charles Perley, and Dorothy Gish, and directed by Frank Powell.

*In &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; (1961), Union soldiers Cyrus Harding (Michael Craig), Herbert Brown (Michael Callan), and Neb (Dan Jackson), along with Union war correspondent Gideon Spillet (Gary Merrill) and Confederate sergeant Pencroft (Percy Herbert) escape from Libby Prison via an observation balloon.

* Episode 25 titled &quot;Escape&quot; of the anthology tv series &quot;The Great Adventure&quot; (1964) shows a dramatization of the planning and escaping from Libby Prison.

*In the television miniseries &quot;North and South&quot; (1986), General George Hazard (James Read) is taken prisoner and sent to Libby Prison, then under temporary command of Captain Turner (Wayne Newton). He is rescued by his best friend, General Orry Main (Patrick Swayze), and Main&#x27;s cousin, Confederate officer Charles Main (Lewis Smith).

*The escape is in the television series &quot;History&#x27;s Greatest Escapes with Morgan Freeman &quot; season 2 episode 7 (2024).

<text>Libon was a 5th-century BC architect of Ancient Greece. Born in Elis, he built the Doric Temple of Zeus at Olympia in about 460 BC. Libon, through his work on the Temple, is said to have inspired the technique and design of the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis – though this was obviously later and more perfected.

<doc id="1051207" wikidata="Q3435400" url="?curid=1051207" title="Robert Hoddle">
<text>Robert Hoddle (21 April 1794 – 24 October 1881) was a surveyor and artist. He was the first Surveyor-General of Victoria from 1851 to 1853. He was previously the Surveyor-in-Charge of the Port Phillip District from 1837 to 1851. He became Surveyor-General upon the proclamation of the Port Phillip District as the new Colony of Victoria within the British Empire in July 1851. He is especially recognized for the design and layout of the Hoddle Grid in 1837, the area which forms the Melbourne central business district (CBD) of Melbourne. He was also an accomplished artist and depicted scenes of the Port Phillip region and New South Wales. Hoddle was one of the earliest-known European artists to depict Ginninderra, the area now occupied by Canberra, Australia&#x27;s National Capital.

==Early life==
Hoddle, the son of a bank clerk for the Bank of England, was born in Westminster, London. He became a cadet-surveyor in the British army in 1812. Hoddle worked in the Ordnance Department and took part in the trigonometrical survey of Great Britain. Hoddle then sailed for the Cape Colony, South Africa in 1822 where he worked on military surveys.

==Surveying in Australia==
Hoddle migrated to the Australian colonies, arriving in Sydney, New South Wales, aboard the &quot;William Penn&quot; in July 1823. Governor Brisbane appointed him assistant surveyor under Surveyor-General John Oxley. Hoddle spent the next twelve years in Queensland and later still in New South Wales where he surveyed the sites for the towns of Berrima and Goulburn as well as Bell&#x27;s Line of Road in the Blue Mountains. Between 1830 and 1836, Hoddle made several visits to the rural district now occupied by the Australian Capital Territory where he surveyed property boundaries. Squatters were urgently pressing for government surveyors to legalise their rural holdings. Hoddle&#x27;s field book indexes the history of the aforementioned areas and pastoralists— George Palmer, Robert Campbell and Hamilton Hume.
Hoddle arrived in Port Phillip, the future site for Melbourne, in March 1837 in company with Governor Bourke, as senior surveyor with his assistants D&#x27;Arcy and Darke. He was to take charge of the surveying work which had been begun by Robert Russell, who many years later claimed to have surveyed the first grid of streets. Whether Hoddle surveyed from scratch or used Russell&#x27;s initial survey has been the subject of controversy, but they both followed the then standard grid layout and alignment. Hoddle&#x27;s survey, a copy of which survives in the Public Record Office of Victoria, is dated 25 March 1837, and covered the area from Flinders Street to Lonsdale Street, and from Spencer Street to Spring Street. The principal streets were one and a half chains wide (30 m), and at the insistence of Bourke, smaller east–west streets a half chain wide (10 m) were inserted, intended to furnish back entrances (but quickly became frontages in their own right). This layout came to be known as the Hoddle Grid.

In 1837, at the same time as Melbourne, Hoddle laid out the first blocks of Williamstown, but without rear laneways. In 1838 he laid out Geelong, including narrow laneways as in the Melbourne grid. His layouts for each were typical of the time, being square or rectangular grids, aligned with features such as rivers or waterfront, surrounded by government reserve for future expansion, government buildings, ports and the like.

Hoddle subdivided the land beyond the angled city grid on a one-mile north–south grid, creating much larger allotments. The areas closest to the city in what is now Fitzroy, Collingwood and Richmond, were soon subdivided by speculators creating the sometimes quite narrow streets and irregular grid pattern. Hoddle&#x27;s subdivision of East Melbourne was far more regular.

Hoddle was in favour of the principal entry streets being a generous width of 60m, which he applied to what are now Melbourne&#x27;s tree-lined boulevards, such as St Kilda Road, Victoria Parade, Elizabeth Street in Carlton, and the roads branching off that: Royal Parade and Flemington Road. He advocated widening the other existing major roads without success. In 1853 he was gently asked to retire in favour of Andrew Young, who is credited with the subdivisions of Carlton, Fitzroy North and South Geelong that include formal parks, squares and crescents.

==Artist in ink and watercolours==
Robert Hoddle is the earliest-known European artist to have depicted the Australian Capital Territory area. Many of his works are held in the National Library of Australia, State Library of Victoria and the State Library of New South Wales.

Some of the paintings he made during this time are held at the National Library of Australia. They include:
*Ginninginderry, i.e. Ginninderra, Plains, New South Wales; watercolour
*Ginninginderry, i.e. Ginninderra, Plains; watercolour

Additional works by Hoddle include:
*View from Limestone Hill called Campbells Hill, New South Wales, March 1832; watercolour
*The seven day&#x27;s in the Week&#x27;s Occupation of the Australians, hunting, 1835; ink wash
*Unidentified coastal landscape, New South Wales, 1; watercolour
*Unidentified coastal landscape, New South Wales, 2; watercolour
*View from Illawarra Range en route to Kiama, 1830; watercolour

==Later life==
William Lonsdale appointed Hoddle as auctioneer at the first sale of crown land on 1 June 1837, at which he sold half-acre (0.2 ha) allotments for £18 to £78, considered at the time a very high price. Hoddle&#x27;s commission was £57 12s. 7d., from which he bought two allotments for himself at a cost of £54. Hoddle built himself a house on the corner of Bourke and Spencer streets where, in retirement, he tended his trees, played organ and flute and translated Spanish.

In 1840, Hoddle was granted a gratuity of £500 as he was leaving the survey department on account of ill-health. However, after a few months holiday he recovered his health, took up his duties again, and the gratuity was not paid to him. He later did valuable work in the country districts of Victoria, became Surveyor General of Victoria in 1851, and retired in July 1853 with a pension of £1,000 a year. He had bought in 1837 the block of land in Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, on which the Commonwealth Bank now stands, for a comparatively small sum, and he became a wealthy man. After his retirement he took an interest in the Old Colonists&#x27; Association and was elected a life governor in December 1873.

==Personal life==
He was married twice and left a widow and children.

==Death==
He died at his residence on the north east corner of Bourke and Spencer Street, a lot he bought at one of the first land sales, on 24 October 1881.

<text>Evenimentul Zilei is a formerly physical and now exclusively online newspaper in Romania. Its name translates to &quot;The event of the day&quot; or &quot;Today&#x27;s event&quot;.

==History and profile==
&quot;Evenimentul Zilei&quot; was founded by Ion Cristoiu, Cornel Nistorescu, and , and the first issue was published on 22 June 1992. Ion Cristoiu, one of the 3 founders of the newspaper, was also its first director, but he is currently columnist at the same newspaper

The newspaper reached its peak daily circulation of 675,000 in 1993. In 1997 chief editor Ion Cristoiu quit and this job was taken by Cornel Nistorescu. The newspaper was purchased along with its parent company Publishing in 1998 by the German company Gruner + Jahr (owned, in turn, by Bertelsmann), which later, in 2003 sold it to the Swiss press trust Ringier; at the time of purchase, Ringier representatives stated that there would be no direct or indirect intervention in the newspaper&#x27;s editorial policy.

In September 2004 more than 50 &quot;Evenimentul Zilei&quot; journalists protested Ringier&#x27;s management decisions. Similar issues were raised at the same time at rival daily &quot;România liberă&quot;, owned by Germany&#x27;s WAZ-Mediengruppe. At both papers, journalists have complained that foreign owners are telling them to lessen the political coverage and tone down their negative reporting of the government. Their concern has been echoed by a variety of organizations including the Open Society Foundations. After this scandal, &quot;Evenimentul Zilei&quot; became one of the most fervent attackers of the government&#x27;s corruption. Nonetheless, &quot;Evenimentul Zilei&quot; remained &quot;The biggest thorn in [Adrian] Nastase&#x27;s side&quot; throughout the 2004 Romanian elections.

Ten days after Năstase&#x27;s defeat in the 13 December 2004 runoff elections, the Ringier group moved the &quot;EZ&quot; editor-in-chief, Dan Turturică, to Bacău (officially, to look into the possibility of starting a free newspaper there) and began changing the editorial policy, to become a tabloid. As a response, 80 journalists signed a protest against these decisions and organized rallies in front of the Swiss and EU embassies. Subsequent negotiations were unsuccessful and on 4 January 2005, 30 journalists resigned, in addition to another five that resigned several days earlier. Paid circulation dropped at least 40% from a high of over 100,000.

In 2010 Ringier sold its shares in the paper to Bobby Păunescu. In 2019, the newspaper ceased to exist on paper after 8650 numbers. From 1 January 2020, the team moved exclusively online.

<text>Albatross, originally named Albatros, later Alk, was a sailing ship that became famous when she sank in 1961 with a group of American teenagers on board. The events were the basis for 1996 film &quot;White Squall&quot;.

== Early history ==

The &quot;Albatross&quot; was built as &quot;Albatros&quot;, a schooner, at the state shipyard (Rijkswerf) in Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1920, to serve as a pilot boat (named &quot;Alk&quot;) in the North Sea. The ship spent two decades working the North Sea before being purchased by the German government in 1937. She served as a radio-station ship for submarines during the Second World War. In 1949, Royal Rotterdam Lloyd bought her for use as a training ship for future officers of their company (Dutch merchant marine). The fact that she was small made her ideal for this kind of work, and the dozen trainees could receive personal attention from the six or so professional crew. While under Dutch ownership, she sailed the North Sea extensively, with occasional voyages as far as Spain and Portugal.

The American aviator, filmmaker and novelist Ernest K. Gann purchased the &quot;Albatros&quot; in 1954, re-rigged her as a brigantine, and she cruised the Pacific for three years. According to Charles Gieg (&quot;The Last Voyage of the Albatros&quot;), the &quot;Albatros&quot; survived a tsunami in Hawaii during this time. She was also used in the 1958 film &quot;Twilight for the Gods&quot; (starring Rock Hudson and Arthur Kennedy), whose script and the underlying novel by the same title were written by the &quot;Albatros&quot;″ owner Gann.

== &quot;Albatross&quot; at the &quot;Ocean Academy&quot; and loss ==

In 1959, Christopher B. Sheldon&#x27;s &quot;Ocean Academy, Ltd.&quot;, of Darien, Connecticut, acquired the ship to use for trips combining preparatory college classes and sail training. Over the next three years, Christopher B. Sheldon, Ph.D., and his wife, Alice Strahan Sheldon, M.D., ran programs for up to fourteen students in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific Ocean.

From fall 1960 to spring 1961, a crew of four instructors (including the Sheldons), a cook, George Ptacnik, and 13 students sailed the &quot;Albatross&quot; from the Bahamas through the Caribbean to the Galápagos Islands and back to the Caribbean; a fourteenth student had been on the ship for the first part of the voyage, but had left in Balboa, Panama. At the beginning of May, the &quot;Albatross&quot; was en route from Progreso, Mexico, to Nassau, the Bahamas. On 1 May, skipper Sheldon decided that they would make a stop at one of the Florida Keys to refuel.

Shortly after 8:30 am on 2 May 1961 the &quot;Albatross&quot; was hit by a sudden squall about west of the Dry Tortugas. She heeled over suddenly and sank almost instantly, taking with her Alice Sheldon, the ship&#x27;s cook George Ptacnik, and students Chris Coristine, John Goodlett, Rick Marsellus, and Robin Wetherill (John Goodlett was on deck in the last minutes, but probably became entangled in some of the lines or a sail of the sinking ship while freeing a lifeboat, and Christopher Coristine reportedly went below deck in an attempt to save someone else). As there had not been time to send out a radio distress signal before she was lost, the remaining crew used her two lifeboats to make way towards Florida. Around 7:30 a.m. on 3 May, the two boats were found by the Dutch freighter &quot;Gran Rio&quot;, which took the survivors to Tampa, Florida.

According to Sheldon, the squall hitting the &quot;Albatross&quot; was a white squall, i.e. an unpredictably sudden, very strong squall. His opinion was that the &quot;Albatross&quot; was essentially a stable, &quot;safe&quot; ship, and that the crew of teenagers—who had already spent about eight months on board—were sufficiently trained, but that this rare weather phenomenon left the ship no chance. Critics of this view, however, have argued that refittings of the &quot;Albatross&quot; over the years by her various owners had made her top heavy, which affected her secondary stability, that is, her ability to remain stable or even right herself after tilting to the side, as opposed to capsizing. In her times as North Sea pilot schooner, the ship had had a far smaller and lower sail area, which means that the force of the wind did not have as much power and as powerful an angle as it did the day she sank. Almost 40 years after the loss of the &quot;Albatross&quot;, Daniel S. Parrott reanalyzed some of the documents about the ship and comparable ships in his book, &quot;Tall Ships Down&quot;. He suggested that due to the ship&#x27;s impaired stability, even a &quot;normal&quot; squall could have sunk her; according to him, only the expert handling of the ship and the habitual prudence of the ship&#x27;s captain(s) to reduce sail area early had prevented the refitted &quot;Albatross&quot; from capsizing in previous strong wind conditions.

In 1932, the German sail training ship &quot;Niobe&quot; suffered a similar fate, killing 69. Parrott draws parallels to the sudden losses of the &quot;Marques&quot; (1984) and the original &quot;Pride of Baltimore&quot; (1986), which were similarly affected by large sail areas; in the case of the &quot;Marques&quot;, this was likewise the result of refittings over the years of her existence.

== Aftermath ==

The loss of the &quot;Albatross&quot; prompted the United States Coast Guard to undertake a thorough review of the instantaneous stability—i.e. the ability of ships to remain upright—and design requirements for sailing school ships. The new rules were codified in the Sailing School Vessels Act of 1982.

Narrations of the last voyage of the &quot;Albatross&quot; were published by two of the survivors: Charles Gieg, who had been one of the students on board the ship, and Richard Langford, who had been the English instructor.

The 1996 film &quot;White Squall&quot;, starring Jeff Bridges and directed by Ridley Scott, presents a fictionalized version of the ship&#x27;s loss.

After the loss of the &quot;Albatross&quot;, Sheldon worked for the Peace Corps and briefly started another sailing school. He never remarried and died on October 5, 2002, of pancreatic cancer, in Stamford, Connecticut. He was 76.

<text>Licata (, ; , whence or &quot;Plintis&quot;), formerly also Alicata (), is a city and &quot;comune&quot; located on the south coast of Sicily, at the mouth of the Salso River (the ancient &quot;Himera&quot;), about midway between Agrigento and Gela. It is a major seaport developed at the turn of the twentieth century, shipping sulphur, the refining of which has made Licata the largest European exporting centre, and asphalt, and at times shipping cheese.

West of the port city there is a series of pocket beaches separated by wave-cut headlands as high as . (Amore 2002).

== History ==
=== Ancient ===

The settlement was frequented by the Phoenicians who traded there between the 12th and 8th centuries BC. At the end of the 7th century BC the Geloi (inhabitants of ancient Gela, in Magna Graecia) built a fortified station to guard the mouth of the Salso (&quot;Himera&quot;) river. In the first half of 6th century BC Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigento, built a fortified outpost.

The first settlement was probably founded by colonists from Gela.

At the Battle of the Himera River (311 BC) near the town, Agothocles was beaten by the Carthaginians and the town fell into their hands.

The city itself was re-founded on the right bank of the Salso in 282 BC, by Phintias, tyrant of Agrigentum, who named it for himself (Phintias), after razing the city of Gela and resettling its population here. As late as the 1st century BC, inscriptions and coins show that the inhabitants retained the name &quot;Geloi&quot;. 

Phintias was laid out on a great scale, with walls, temples and an agora. The setting took advantage of a small natural harbour, about across, in a bay on the coast that is now infilled. The site was protected by the headland now named Monte San Michele. Phintias, however, never rose to the importance of Gela.

At nearby Cape Ecnomus, in 256 BC the Romans won the Battle of Cape Ecnomus in the First Punic War and freed the city from the Carthaginians. In 249 BC it afforded shelter to a Roman fleet which was, however, attacked by the Carthaginians and many of the ships sunk. Cicero also alludes to it as a seaport, carrying on a considerable export trade in corn. 

Under the Romans Phintias became a large commercial emporium. But in Strabo&#x27;s time it seems to have fallen into the same state of decay with the other cities on the south coast of Sicily, as he does not mention it among the few exceptions. Pliny, notices the Phintienses (or Phthinthienses as the name is written in some manuscripts) among the stipendiary towns of Sicily; and its name is found also in Ptolemy; but it is strange that both these writers reckon it among the inland towns of Sicily, though its maritime position is clearly attested both by Diodorus and Cicero. The &quot;Antonine Itinerary&quot; also gives a place called Plintis, doubtless a corruption of Phintias, which it places on the road from Agrigentum along the coast towards Syracuse, at the distance of from the former city. This distance agrees tolerably well with that from Agrigento to Licata, though somewhat less.

=== Middle and Modern Ages ===
The historical centre of the town, near the coastal castle of Lympiados, dates from the period of Byzantine domination. In 827 the Arabs conquered Licata, and their rule lasted for more than two centuries, ending when the town was captured by the Normans on July 25, 1086. During the Norman-Hohenstaufen age the town flourished and was awarded the title of &quot;Cittè Demaniale&quot; (&quot;Crown&#x27;s City&quot;).

In 1270 Licata (then having some 7,000 inhabitants) rebelled against Angevine rule as part of the uprising known as the Sicilian Vespers. Thereafter the town came under the control of the House of Trastámara, who in 1447 granted it the title of &quot;fidelissima&quot; (&quot;Most Faithful&quot;). In 1553, after the city was sacked by Dragut&#x27;s corsairs, it was decided to rebuild the walls, together with a large tower which was erected on the summit of Sant&#x27;Angelo hill.

Licata began to flourish once more in the 16th century, thanks in part to the presence of a community of Maltese immigrants, and this period of prosperity continued well into the 17th century, when the first settlements appeared outside the wall, housing the growing Maltese community, and numerous buildings were constructed or rebuilt in the Baroque style. The port also enjoyed a period of prosperity, largely resulting from the export of grain.

=== Contemporary era ===
In 1820 Licata rose against the Bourbon rulers of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, led by patriot Matteo Vecchio Verderame. During the Expedition of the Thousand under Giuseppe Garibaldi, the town contributed with a whole corps, and housed for a night Garibaldi&#x27;s son Menotti and his general Nino Bixio.

The 1870s saw the construction of two bridges connecting to the sulphur mines inland, and five refineries (including the then largest in Europe) were built. This brought a considerable economic expansion, leading to the creation of several elegant residences in Licata.

Licata served as an Allied landing point during the 1943 Operation HUSKY Allied invasion of Sicily of World War II. War damage and the decline in competitiveness in the sulphur industry caused economic decline, forcing many people to emigrate to northern Italy or abroad. As a town occupied by the Allies, it served as a model for John Hersey&#x27;s novel &quot;A Bell for Adano&quot;.

Licata has however maintained its artistic importance, and tourism has begun to flourish again in recent times. Nevertheless, the economy is heavily reliant on the fishing industry.
The Museo Civico displays many archaeological finds, notably material from burial grounds dating from prehistoric times to the 3rd century BC.

==Geography==

<text>HMAS &quot;Anzac&quot; (FFH 150) was the lead ship of the &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigates in use with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). Entering Australian service in 1996, the frigate operated as part of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce in 1999. In 2003, she was involved in the Battle of Al Faw, and became the first RAN ship to since the Vietnam War.

In February 2024 it was announced by the Australian Government that &quot;HMAS Anzac&quot; would not sail again and be the first ship of her class to be decommissioned in the near future, followed by her sister ship &quot;Arunta&quot; in 2026. HMAS &quot;Anzac&quot; was decommissioned on 18 May 2024 after 28 years of service. 

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Anzac&quot; class originated from RAN plans to replace the six s with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships&#x27; requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted. By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss&#x27;s MEKO 200 design, the M class (later ) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defence) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.

The &quot;Anzac&quot;s are based on Blohm + Voss&#x27; MEKO 200 PN (or ) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment. Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of . A Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout is used, with a single, General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship&#x27;s two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at ; about 50% greater than other MEKO 200 designs. The standard ship&#x27;s company of an &quot;Anzac&quot; consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors.
As designed, the main armament for the frigate is a 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 gun, supplemented by an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system (for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles), two machine guns, and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets (initially firing Mark 46 torpedoes, but later upgraded to use the MU90 Impact torpedo). They were also designed for but not with a close-in weapons system (two Mini Typhoons fitted when required from 2005 onwards), two quad-canister Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (which were installed across the RAN vessels from 2005 onwards), and a second Mark 41 launcher (which has not been added). The Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s use a Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter; plans to replace them with Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprites were cancelled in 2008 due to ongoing problems.

&quot;Anzac&quot; was laid down at Williamstown, Victoria on 5 November 1993. The ship was assembled from six hull modules and six superstructure modules, but unlike later ships in the class, which had modules fabricated at three sites, &quot;Anzac&quot; was built entirely at Williamstown. The frigate was launched on 16 September 1994 by Army nurse Vivian Statham. &quot;Anzac&quot; was commissioned into the RAN at Station Pier in Melbourne on 18 May 1996. The ship&#x27;s name is in recognition of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) and their service during World War I.

==Operational history==
In October 1997, &quot;Anzac&quot; conducted Operation Dirk supported by HMAS &quot;Westralia&quot; targeting illegal fishing vessels in the Southern Ocean catching the Patagonian toothfish around Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Australian Fisheries Zone with the &quot;Salvora&quot; and the &quot;Aliza Glacial&quot; apprehended boarded by Clearance divers.

&quot;Anzac&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 19 to 29 September 1999. The ship was later awarded the battle honour &quot;East Timor 1999&quot; in recognition of this deployment.

29 October 2000 HMAS Anzac rendezvoused with CSIRO Research Vessel RV Franklin 300 nm west of Fremantle after answering a Mayday call during a port visit to Albany. In treacherous weather including, a six metre swell,40 knot winds and fading light HMAS Anzac launched a RHIB (Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat) and transferred a medical team to RV Franklin to stabilise the patient and transfer back to the Anzac. The patient was transferred by helicopter the next day back to Perth when Anzac reached aircraft range. Anzac had embarked a news crew from GWN at Albany and Anzac crew were able to film some of the rescue. The medical team and Boat crew received a Maritime Commanders Commendation. The Boat crew also received a CN commendation.&lt;refhttps://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/Estimates/Live/fadt_ctte/estimates/add_0001/def/ans-def-q39b-tables-feb01.ashx/&gt;

Between 2001 and 2003, &quot;Anzac&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf on three occasions.

&quot;Anzac&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf for the third time from February until May 2003, as part of Operation Falconer. On 21 March 2003, &quot;Anzac&quot; provided naval gunfire support during the Battle of Al Faw. The intent of the assault was to capture the Al Faw Peninsula before Iraqi forces could sabotage the two major oil terminals in the area. The frigate began her first fire support mission at 06:04 on 21 March (the first time a RAN ship had fired in anger in 31 years) and completed seven fire missions over a three-day period. The frigate received the Meritorious Unit Citation on 27 November 2003 for her service during this deployment. In March 2010, &quot;Anzac&quot; was awarded the battle honours &quot;Persian Gulf 2001–03&quot; and &quot;Iraq 2003&quot;.
In 2005, &quot;Anzac&quot; participated in a Northern Trident deployment: a round-the-world voyage intended as a flag-showing cruise to the northern hemisphere. As part of this deployment, &quot;Anzac&quot; was involved in ceremonies for the 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings, and participated in the fleet review for the bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar.

On the morning of 13 March 2009, &quot;Anzac&quot; was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The frigate was one of the thirteen ships involved in the ceremonial entry through Sydney Heads, and anchored in the harbour for the review.

&quot;Anzac&quot; was assigned to Rotation 29 of Operation Slipper from July 2012 to January 2013 as part of the International Coalition Against Terrorism (ICAT), and which included counter-piracy in the Arabian Sea region and elsewhere.
During 2014, &quot;Anzac&quot; was the third ship of the class to undergo the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade. The upgrade occurred across 2014 and early 2015, the upgrade included the fitting of CEA Technologies&#x27; CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars, on new masts, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems, along with improvements to the operations room equipment and layout.

Between March and October 2015, &quot;Anzac&quot; sailed on a second Northern Trident deployment. The circumnavigation included port visits to 11 countries and participation in commemorative services for the Gallipoli and Normandy landings.

&quot;Anzac&quot; has received freedom of entry to the city of Albany, Western Australia: Albany was the port the first convoy of the ANZACs departed Australia from.

In February 2024 it was announced that &quot;Anzac&quot; was due to decommission in 2024, the first of her class, to free up funding for a future enlargement of the RAN. Her sister ship, &quot;Arunta&quot;, is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2026 while the remainder of the class would not receive any more major upgrades. On 18 May 2024, a decommissioning ceremony was held for &quot;Anzac&quot; at HMAS Stirling.

<text>HMAS &quot;Anzac&quot; (D59) was a of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Named after the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, the destroyer was commissioned in 1951. The ship served on two tours of duty during the Korean War, and attempts to distinguish herself from British ships led to the practice of red kangaroo symbols on Australian warships. During 1956, &quot;Anzac&quot; served during the Malayan Emergency. In 1960, a malfunction in the destroyer&#x27;s gun direction equipment caused &quot;Anzac&quot; to fire directly on sister ship during a gunnery exercise, with &quot;Tobruk&quot; left unrepairable. In 1961, the destroyer was reclassified as a training vessel. &quot;Anzac&quot; remained in service until 1974, and was sold for breaking a year later.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Anzac&quot; was built to the British design. The ship had a displacement of 2,436 tons as designed, although this displacement increased to 3,450 tons after her 1963 reclassification as a training ship. She was long overall and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers supplying steam to Parsons geared turbines; these generated for the destroyer&#x27;s two propeller shafts. &quot;Anzac&quot; was designed to reach , but could usually only reach . The ship&#x27;s company originally consisted of 320 personnel, but after conversion into a training ship, this changed to 169 ship&#x27;s company plus 109 trainees.
The main armament of &quot;Anzac&quot; consisted of four Mark VI guns in two twin turrets. This was supplemented by twelve Bofors 40 mm guns for air defence, (three twin mountings and six single mountings, a Squid anti-submarine mortar, and two sets of 5-tube  Pentad torpedo launchers.

&quot;Anzac&quot; was laid down by the Williamstown Naval Dockyard at Melbourne, Victoria on 23 September 1946. The ship was originally to be named &quot;Matapan&quot;, for the Battle of Cape Matapan, but this was changed to &quot;Anzac&quot;, for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps prior to launch. She was launched on 20 August 1948 by the wife of John Augustine Collins, the Chief of the Naval Staff and a former commanding officer of the previous HMAS &quot;Anzac&quot;. &quot;Anzac&quot; was commissioned as a ship of the RAN on 14 March 1951. Acceptance from dockyard hands occurred on 22 March.

==Operational history==
On 30 July 1951, &quot;Anzac&quot; left Australian waters for her first deployment to the Korean War. Arriving in Japan on 14 August, the destroyer was assigned as an escort to the United States Navy (USN) escort carrier and operated off the west coast of Korea. &quot;Sicily&quot; was replaced by the Royal Navy (RN) light carrier on 2 September, and on 6 September, &quot;Anzac&quot; was ordered to shell a suspected communist position near Haeju, and fired in anger for the first time at 18:15. During 12–26 September, &quot;Anzac&quot; led US Ships and in a blockade of Wosan, before returning to Japanese waters at the end of the month.

Her first Korean tour completed, &quot;Anzac&quot; escorted HMS &quot;Glory&quot; to Sydney, where they arrived on 20 October. The destroyer then proceeded to Melbourne for a refit, which lasted until the end of 1951, and remained in Australian waters until deploying with the cruiser in April 1952 for a training cruise through Maritime Southeast Asia. After undergoing another, brief refit, &quot;Anzac&quot; rejoined the Korean War effort, and spent most of September patrolling the west coast of Korea, then joined the escort screen of the RN light carrier at the start of October. After a short break in Kure, the destroyer was assigned to patrols and shore bombardments on the west coast until 19 December, when she relieved and assumed responsibility for the defence of Yongdo Island. Herself relieved on 3 January 1953, &quot;Anzac&quot; returned to the west coast of Korea, where she resumed patrols and bombardments. Apart from a brief stint on the east coast shelling supply lines and a visit to Tokyo to celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, &quot;Anzac&quot; operated off the west coast until 13 June; the conclusion of her second Korean tour. &quot;Anzac&quot; arrived in Sydney on 3 July.

For her two tours, &quot;Anzac&quot; was awarded the battle honour &quot;Korea 1951–53&quot;. During these tours, the ship&#x27;s company often found themselves mistaken for British warships, as the RAN ensign at the time was identical to the British White Ensign, and the Battle class was a British design. To counteract this, the executive officer acquired the largest sheet of brass he could find, and had the kangaroo design from the reverse of the Australian penny cut from the sheet, which was then mounted to the top of the mainmast as a &#x27;weathervane&#x27;. This method of identification was later adopted across the RAN: all major fleet units now bear a red kangaroo symbol on each side of their exhaust funnels or superstructure.

During late 1953 and early 1954, &quot;Anzac&quot; was assigned to Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation tour. The destroyer carried the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and other members of the Royal Party during visits to locations in Queensland, then Papua and New Guinea.

&quot;Anzac&quot; operated during the Malayan Emergency. Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, the destroyer was retroactively awarded a second honour to recognise this: &quot;Malaya 1956&quot;.

Between 1956 and 1959, the destroyer was deployed on several occasions to serve with the Far East Strategic Reserve.

In September 1960, &quot;Anzac&quot; was performing gunnery exercises with sister ship . A malfunction in &quot;Anzac&quot;″s gun direction equipment negated the deliberate 6° mis-aiming of her guns, with the resulting shell hitting &quot;Tobruk&quot; and doing enough damage to the destroyer to make repairs uneconomical. Two of &quot;Anzac&quot;″s personnel were charged by the Naval Board, while &quot;Tobruk&quot; was decommissioned a month later.

In March 1961, &quot;Anzac&quot; completed conversion into a training ship. This conversion included the removal of several weapons systems, including the second 4.5-inch turret, and the conversion of the freed space to classrooms and training spaces. Cadet midshipmen from the RAN training facility at and supplementary list midshipmen (and in later years, trainees from the RAN&#x27;s Papua New Guinea Division and from the Singapore Armed Forces) were embarked on three-month stints to receive practical experience and training in naval operations and duties. Training cruises typically occurred through the South Pacific, with several port visits to broaden the trainees&#x27; cultural horizons.

During February and March 1963, &quot;Anzac&quot; served as escort for Queen Elizabeth II and the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; during the royal tour of Australia. In October, &quot;Anzac&quot; accompanied the troop transport on a training cruise in northern Queensland waters. During May and June 1964, the destroyer embarked the Governor-General, Viscount De L&#x27;Isle for a visit to the territories of Papua and New Guinea. In September 1965, &quot;Anzac&quot; and the carrier escorted &quot;Sydney&quot; on the outbound leg of her second troop-transport voyage to Vietnam. On 21 May 1968, &quot;Anzac&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot; left Brisbane on the latter&#x27;s eleventh of twenty-five Vietnam voyages. The ships arrived at Vũng Tàu on 1 June, and returned to Brisbane on 13 June. During 1969, &quot;Anzac&quot; visited Tahiti and Western Samoa, and was in New Zealand for the bicentenary of James Cook&#x27;s landing at Poverty Bay. In 1970, the destroyer was part of another bicentenary celebration of Cook&#x27;s first voyage of discovery; this time at Cook&#x27;s last Australian landfall at Possession Island. During the training cruises of the ship&#x27;s final years, &quot;Anzac&quot; visited Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and New Zealand.
HMAS Anzac escorted HMS Britannia during the Commonwealth Games held in Christchurch NZ during 1974 berthing at Lyttelton Harbour.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Anzac&quot; was berthed at Garden Island on 11 August, in preparation for paying off. She was decommissioned on 4 October 1974, after travelling . She was sold for A$41,780 to the Hifirm Corporation Limited of Hong Kong on 26 November 1975, and departed Sydney on 30 December 1975 under tow by the Japanese tug &quot;Herakuresu&quot;.

<text>HMAS &quot;Anzac was a [[Parker class leader|&quot;Parker&quot;-class]] [[destroyer leader]] that served in the [[Royal Navy]] (asHMS &quot;Anzac) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Launched in early 1917 and commissioned into the Royal Navy, &quot;Anzac&quot; led the 14th Destroyer Flotilla of the Grand Fleet during the First World War. In 1919, she and five other destroyers were transferred to the RAN, with &quot;Anzac&quot; commissioning as an Australian warship in 1920. Except for three visits to New Guinea and one to the Solomon Islands, &quot;Anzac&quot; remained in southern and eastern Australian waters for her entire career. The destroyer was decommissioned in 1931, sold for scrapping four years later, stripped for parts, then towed outside Sydney Heads and sunk as a target ship in 1936.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Anzac&quot; was a &quot;Parker&quot;-class destroyer leader, based on the &quot;Marksman&quot; or &quot;Lightfoot&quot; class. The ship had a displacement of 1,660 tons, was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a draught of at maximum load. Propulsion was provided by four Yarrow boilers providing steam to Brown-Curtis geared turbines, which delivered 37,060 shaft horsepower to the destroyer&#x27;s three propellers. The ship was designed to reach , but could only achieve an average of during full-power trials. Maximum range was at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 8 officers and 114 sailors.

The primary armament for &quot;Anzac&quot; consisted of four single QF 4-inch Mark IV guns. This was supplemented by two 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns for air defence, a single .303-inch Maxim machine gun, four .303-inch Lewis machine guns (two single guns and a twin-mount), two twin 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tube sets, two depth charge throwers, and four depth charge chutes.

The order to build &quot;Anzac&quot; was placed with William Denny and Brothers in December 1915, and the ship was laid down at their shipyard in Dumbarton, Scotland on 31 January 1916. The destroyer was launched on 11 January 1917, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 24 April 1917, the day of her completion. The ship&#x27;s name is in recognition of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps and their service during the early years of the First World War. The destroyer went through a rapid succession of penant numbers during her British service; although assigned the pennant F6 during construction, this was changed three days before launch to G80, then became G50 at the start of 1918, before changing again to G70 in April.

==Operational history==

===Royal Navy===
On entering service, &quot;Anzac&quot; was assigned to lead the 14th Destroyer Flotilla of the Grand Fleet, based at Scapa Flow. &quot;Anzac&quot; served in the North Sea and the English Channel during the First World War. On 26 June 1917, &quot;Anzac&quot; went to the assistance of the submarine , which had run aground. In August 1918, &quot;Anzac&quot; was damaged in a heavy storm, requiring the replacement of her exhaust funnels and several of the ship&#x27;s boats.

After the war ended, &quot;Anzac&quot; was placed into reserve at Portsmouth. On 21 March 1919, &quot;Anzac&quot; and five S-class destroyers were transferred to the RAN as a gift. &quot;Anzac&quot; was commissioned into RAN service on 27 January 1920, and departed from Plymouth on 26 February for the voyage to Australia. Early in the voyage, a propeller blade was damaged, so the destroyer had to return to Plymouth for repairs. &quot;Anzac&quot; departed again on 10 March, and arrived in Sydney on 29 April, having visited Gibraltar, Suez, Aden, Bombay, Colombo, Singapore, Surabaya, and Thursday Island en route.

===Royal Australian Navy===
&quot;Anzac&quot; spent most of her early RAN career operating off the southern and eastern coasts of Australia. In December 1922, the change of commanding officer aboard the ship saw the captain relieved by his twin brother. Visits were made to New Guinea in June and July 1924, and in May 1926.

The destroyer was decommissioned on 4 August 1926, then recommissioned on 10 January 1928. During 1928, &quot;Anzac&quot; was on standby as a rescue ship for two of Charles Kingsford Smith&#x27;s pioneering flights: in June as &quot;Southern Cross&quot; approached Brisbane on the last leg of the first trans-Pacific flight, then in September off Sydney for Kingsford Smith&#x27;s departure on the first successful trans-Tasman flight. The ship continued operating in Australian waters, except for a visit to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in September 1930.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Anzac&quot; paid off for disposal on 30 July 1931. The ship was sold to Messrs. Abraham and Wilson of Redfern, New South Wales on 8 August 1935 for scrapping. &quot;Anzac&quot; was stripped down to a hulk, then towed outside Sydney Heads on 7 May 1936 and sunk as a target ship.

<text>Nathan Ball Bradley (May 28, 1831 – November 8, 1906) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served two terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1873 to 1877.

==Early life and education==
Bradley was born in Lee, Massachusetts and moved with his parents to Lorain County, Ohio, in 1835 where he attended the common schools. He moved to Wisconsin in 1849 and was employed in a sawmill in the pine region. He returned to Ohio in 1850 and built and operated a sawmill until 1852, when he moved to Lexington, Michigan, and engaged in the manufacture of lumber.

He moved to St. Charles, in the Saginaw Valley, in 1855 and engaged in the lumber industry. He purchased a mill in Bay City, which he operated from 1858 to 1864. He also engaged in the salt industry in Bay City, where he was also justice of the peace for three terms, a supervisor one term, an alderman three terms, and the first mayor of Bay City after it obtained its charter in 1865. He was a member of the Michigan State Senate from 1866 to 1868. He also engaged in banking in 1867, becoming vice president of the First National Bank of Bay City.

==Congress==
Bradley was elected as a Republican and the first person to represent Michigan&#x27;s 8th congressional district to the 43rd and 44th Congresses, serving from March 4, 1873, to March 3, 1877. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1876.

==After Congress==
After leaving Congress, he returned to the lumber business in Bay City and also was instrumental in establishing the first beet-sugar factory in the state. Bradley died in Bay City on November 8, 1906, and is interred in Elm Lawn Cemetery there.
