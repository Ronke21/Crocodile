<text>The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression is a 1997 book by Stéphane Courtois, Andrzej Paczkowski, Nicolas Werth, Jean-Louis Margolin, and several other European academics documenting a history of political repression by communist states, including genocides, extrajudicial executions, deportations, and deaths in labor camps and allegedly artificially created famines. The book was originally published in France as &quot;Le Livre noir du communisme: Crimes, terreur, répression&quot; by Éditions Robert Laffont. In the United States, it was published by Harvard University Press, with a foreword by Martin Malia. The German edition, published by Piper Verlag, includes a chapter written by Joachim Gauck. The introduction was written by Courtois. Historian François Furet was originally slated to write the introduction, but he died before being able to do so.

&quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; has been translated into numerous languages, has sold millions of copies, and is considered one of the most influential and controversial books written about the history of communism in the 20th century, in particular the history of the Soviet Union and other state socialist regimes. The work was praised by a broad range of popular-press publications and historians, while academic press and specialist reviews were more critical or mixed for some historical inaccuracies. The introduction by Courtois was especially criticized, including by three of the book&#x27;s main contributors, for comparing communism to Nazism and giving a definitive number of &quot;victims of communism&quot;, which critics have described as inflated. Werth&#x27;s chapter, however, stood out as a positive. The book&#x27;s title was chosen to echo &quot;The Black Book of Soviet Jewry&quot;, a documentary record of Nazi atrocities in the Eastern Front, written by Ilya Ehrenburg and Vasily Grossman for the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee during World War II.

== Overview ==
The authors use the term &quot;communism&quot; to mean Leninist and Marxist–Leninist communism, i.e., the actually existing communist regimes and &quot;real socialism&quot; of the 20th century; they distinguish it from small-c communism, which has existed for millennia, while capital-c Communism began in 1917 with the Bolshevik Revolution, which Stéphane Courtois describes as a coup.

=== Introduction: &quot;The Crimes of Communism&quot; ===
The introduction, written by Courtois, was the main source of controversy, and was acknowledged by Martin Malia in his foreword. Courtois writes that &quot;Communist regimes turned mass crime into a full-blown system of government&quot; and are responsible for a greater number of deaths than Nazism or any other political system. Courtois says that &quot;Communism, the defining characteristic of the &#x27;short twentieth century&#x27; that began in Sarajevo in 1914 and ended in Moscow in 1991, finds itself at center states in the story. Communism predated fascism and Nazism, outlived both, and left its mark on four continents.&quot; Courtois goes on to explain what is meant by the term &quot;Communism&quot; in the book. According to Courtois, &quot;[w]e must make a distinction between the doctrine of communism and its practice. As a political philosophy, communism has existed for centuries, even millennia.&quot; Citing Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; and Thomas More as communist examples of what he terms &quot;utopian philosophy&quot;, Courtois states that &quot;the Communism that concerns us does not exist in the transcendent sphere of ideas. This Communism is altogether real; it has existed at key moments of history and in particular countries, brought to life by its famous leaders&quot;, citing Fidel Castro, Jacques Duclos, Vladimir Lenin, Georges Marchais, Ho Chi Minh, Joseph Stalin, and Maurice Thorez as examples of the latter.

Courtois writes that &quot;[r]egardless of the role that theoretical communist doctrines may have played in the practice of real Communism before 1917&quot;, it was what he terms &quot;flesh-and-blood Communism&quot; which &quot;imposed wholesale repression, culminating in a state-sponsored reign of terror.&quot; Courtois then asks whether the ideology itself is &quot;blameless&quot;, stating that &quot;[t]here will always be some nitpickers who maintain that actual Communism has nothing in common with theoretical communism&quot; and that &quot;it would be absurd to claim that doctrines expounded prior to Jesus Christ, during the Renaissance, or even in the nineteenth century were responsible for the events that took place in the twentieth century.&quot; Quoting Ignazio Silone (&quot;Revolutions, like trees, are recognized by the fruit they bear&quot;), Courtois says that &quot;[i]t was not without reason&quot; that the Bolsheviks, whose party was called the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, renamed it as the Russian Communist Party, called themselves &quot;Communists&quot;, and erected monuments to honor Tommaso Campanella and Thomas More. Courtois claims that &quot;the crimes of Communism have yet to receive a fair and just assessment from both historical and moral viewpoints.&quot;

=== Foreword: &quot;The Uses of Atrocity&quot; ===
In his foreword to the English-language and American edition, Malia states that &quot;Communism has been the great story of the twentieth century&quot; and &quot;it had come to rule a third of mankind and seemed poised to advance indefinitely. For seven decades it haunted world politics, polarizing opinion between those who saw it as the socialist end of history and those who considered it history&#x27;s most vital tyranny.&quot; According to Malia, &quot;more than eighty years after 1917, probing examination of the Big Questions raised by the Marxist-Leninist phenomenon has hardly begun&quot; and that &quot;a serious historiography was precluded in Soviet Russia by the regime&#x27;s mandatory ideology&quot;, further stating that &quot;scholarly investigation of Communism has until recently fallen disproportionately to Westerns.&quot; Malia writes that &quot;&quot;The Black Book&quot; offers us the first attempt to determine, overall, the actual magnitude of what occurred, by systematically detailing Leninism&#x27;s &#x27;crimes, terror, and repression&#x27; from Russia in 1917 to Afghanistan in 1989.&quot; Malia also argues against what he terms &quot;the fable of &#x27;good Lenin/bad Stalin&#x27;&quot;, stating that there never was a &quot;benign, initial phase of Communism before some mytical &#x27;wrong turn&#x27; threw it off track&quot;, claiming that Lenin expected and wanted from the start a civil war &quot;to crush all &#x27;class enemies&#x27;; and this war, principally against the peasants, continued with only short pauses until 1953.&quot; Malia further says that the Red Terror &quot;cannot be explained as the prolongation of prerevolutionary political cultures&quot;, but rather as &quot;a deliberate policy of the new revolutionary order; and its scope and inhumanity far exceeded anything in the national past.&quot; Malia laments that &quot;&#x27;Positivist&#x27; social scientists ... have averred that moral questions are irrelevant to understanding the past&quot; and criticizes this perspective by arguing that it &quot;reduces politics and ideology everywhere to anthropology.&quot;

According to Malia, there is a &quot;basic problem&quot; in Western historiography of Communism which he describes as &quot;the conceptual poverty of the Western empirical effort.&quot; Malia states that &quot;[t]his poverty flows from the premise that Communism can be understood, in an aseptic and value-free mode, as the pure product of social process&quot;, faulting that &quot;researches have endlessly insisted that the October Revolution was a workers&#x27; revolt and not a Party coup d&#x27;état, when it was obviously the latter riding piggyback on the former.&quot; According to Malia, &quot;the central issue in Communist history is not the Party&#x27;s ephemeral worker &#x27;base&#x27;; it is what the intelligentsia victors of October later did with their permanent coup d&#x27;etat, and so far this has scarcely been explored.&quot; Malia then goes on to describe &quot;two fantasies holding out the promise of a better Soviet socialism than the one the Bolsheviks actually built.&quot; The first one is &quot;the &#x27;Bukharin alternative&#x27; to Stalin&quot; which Malia describes as &quot;a thesis that purports to offer a nonviolent, market road to socialism—that is, Marx&#x27;s &quot;integral&quot; socialism, which necessitates the full suppression of private property, profit, and the market.&quot; The second one &quot;purports to find the impetus behind Stalin&#x27;s &#x27;revolution from above&#x27; of 1929–1933 in a &#x27;cultural revolution&#x27; from below by Party activists and workers against the &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; specialists dear to Bukharin, a revolution ultimately leading to massive upward mobility from the factory bench.&quot; Malia writes that &quot;perhaps a moral, rather than a social, approach to the Communist phenomenon can yield a truer understanding for the much-investigated Soviet social process claimed victims on a scale that has never aroused a scholarly curiosity at all proportionate to the magnitude of the disaster.&quot;

=== Estimated number of victims ===
According to the introduction, the number of people killed by the Communist governments amounts to more than 94 million. The statistics of victims include deaths through executions, man-made hunger, famine, war, deportations, and forced labor. The breakdown of the number of deaths is given as follows:
* 65 million in the People&#x27;s Republic of China
* 20 million in the Soviet Union
* 2 million in Cambodia
* 2 million in North Korea
* 1.7 million in Ethiopia
* 1.5 million in Afghanistan
* 1 million in the Eastern Bloc
* 1 million in Vietnam
* 150,000 in Latin America
* 10,000 deaths &quot;resulting from actions of the international Communist movement and Communist parties not in power&quot;

According to Courtois, the crimes by the Soviet Union included the following: 
* The execution of tens of thousands of hostages and prisoners
* The murder of hundreds of thousands of rebellious workers and peasants from 1918 to 1922
* The Russian famine of 1921 which caused the death of 5 million people
* The decossackization, a policy of systematic repression against the Don Cossacks between 1917 and 1933
* The murder of tens of thousands in the Gulag during the period between 1918 and 1930
* The Great Purge which killed almost 690,000 people
* The dekulakization, resulting in the deportation of 2 million so-called kulaks from 1930 to 1932
* The death of 4 million Ukrainians (Holodomor) and 2 million others during the famine of 1932 and 1933
* The deportations of Poles, Ukrainians, Moldovans, and people from the Baltic states from 1939 to 1941 and from 1944 to 1945
* The deportation of the Volga Germans in 1941
* The deportation of the Crimean Tatars in 1944
* Operation Lentil and deportation of the Ingush in 1944

This and other communist death tolls have been criticized by various historians and scholars. Any attempt to estimate a total number of killings under communist regimes depends greatly on definitions, ranging from a low of 10–20 million to as high as 110 million. Criticism of some of the estimates is mostly focused on three aspects, namely that the estimates were based on sparse and incomplete data when significant errors are inevitable, that the figures were skewed to higher possible values, and that those dying at war and victims of civil wars, Holodomor, and other famines under Communist regimes should not be counted.

Historian Andrzej Paczkowski wrote that &quot;[s]ome critics complained that Courtois was &#x27;hunting&#x27; for the highest possible number of victims, which led him, as J. Arch Getty wrote in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, to include &#x27;every possible death just to run up the score.&#x27; To an extent, the charge is valid. Courtois and other contributors to the volume equate the people shot, hanged, or killed in prisons or the camps with those who were victims of calculated political famines (in the Chinese and Soviet cases), or who otherwise starved for lack of food or died for lack of drugs.&quot; Based on the results of their studies, Courtois estimated the total number of the victims at between 65 and 93 million, an unjustified and unclear sum according to Margolin and Werth. In particular, Margolin, who authored the book&#x27;s chapter on Vietnam, stated that &quot;he has never mentioned a million deaths in Vietnam&quot;; Margolin likened Courtois&#x27;s effort to &quot;militant political activity, indeed, that of a prosecutor amassing charges in the service of a cause, that of a global condemnation of the Communist phenomenon as an essentially criminal phenomenon.&quot; Historians Jean-Jacques Becker and J. Arch Getty criticized Courtois for failing to draw a distinction between victims of neglect and famine and victims of &quot;intentional murder.&quot; Regarding these questions, historian Alexander Dallin wrote that moral, legal, or political judgments hardly depend on the number of victims. Getty criticized Malia as a &quot;specialist on the 19th century who has never done original research on the Soviet era.&quot;

In &quot;The Devil in History&quot;, political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu wrote: &quot;Speaking of the number of victims under communist regimes (between 85 and 100 million) and comparing this horrible figure to number of people who perished under or because of Nazism (25 million), Courtois decided to downplay a few crucial facts. In this respect, some of his critics were not wrong. First, as an expansionist global phenomenon, Communism lasted between 1917 and the time of the completion of &quot;The Black Book&quot; (think of North Korea, China, Cuba, Vietnam, where it is still alive, if not well). [Nazism] lasted between 1933 and 1945. Second, we simply do not know what the price in terms of victims of Nazism would have been had Hitler won the war. The logical hypothesis is that not only Jews and Gypsies but also millions of Slavs and other &#x27;racially unfit&#x27; individuals would have been destined to death.&quot;

=== Comparison of communism and Nazism ===
On 12 November 1997, the then-Prime Minister of France and Socialist Lionel Jospin responded to the book&#x27;s claims and declared to the National Assembly that &quot;the Revolution of 1917 was one of the great events of the century. ... And if the [French Communist Party (PCF)] had taken so long to denounce Stalinism, it had done so anyway.&quot; Jospin added that &quot;the PCF had learned the lessons from its history. It is represented in my government and I&#x27;m proud of it.&quot; In a 21 November 1997 interview with &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, Courtois stated: &quot;In my opinion, there is nothing exceptional about the Nazi genocide against the Jews.&quot; Historian Amir Weiner wrote: &quot;The comparison with Nazism is inevitable. It is merited on the grounds of the mutual commitment to social engineering through violent means; the ensuing demographic, psychological, and ethical implications; and, not least, the fact that both systems constantly scrutinized one another. Unfortunately, the authors of the &quot;Black Book&quot; reduce the comparison to body counting, charging communists with killing nearly 100 million people and the Nazis, 25 million. At best, this approach is ahistorical and demeaning.&quot;

Many observers have rejected Courtois&#x27; numerical and moral comparison of communism to Nazism in the introduction, the claim made in the book that &quot;a lot of what they describe &#x27;crimes, terror, and repression&#x27; has somehow been kept from the general public&quot;, According to Werth, there was still a qualitative difference between communism and Nazism, stating: &quot;Death camps did not exist in the Soviet Union.&quot; On 21 September 2000, Werth further told &quot;Le Monde&quot;: &quot;The more you compare Communism and Nazism, the more the differences are obvious.&quot; Weiner wrote that &quot;[w]hen Stalin&#x27;s successors opened the gates of the Gulag, they allowed 3 million inmates to return home. When the Allies liberated the Nazi death camps, they found thousands of human skeletons barely alive awaiting what they knew to be inevitable execution.&quot; Historian Ronald Grigor Suny remarked that Courtois&#x27; comparison of 100 million victims of Communism to 25 million victims of Nazism leaves out &quot;most of the 40–60,000,000 lives lost in the Second World War, for which arguably Hitler and not Stalin was principally responsible.&quot; Alongside philosopher Scott Sehon, anthropologist and postsocialist gender studies scholar Kristen Ghodsee commented that Courtois&#x27; death toll estimate for Nazism &quot;conveniently&quot; excludes those killed in World War II.

At least one scholar in &quot;Le Monde&quot; denounced the introduction, the main source of controversy, as antisemitic, and other critics also denounced it as antisemitic, a charge Malia disagreed with. In the &quot;Nature, Society, and Thought&quot; academic journal, Marxist philosopher Robert Steigerwald wrote: &quot;The book&#x27;s main thesis reads thus: our century&#x27;s fundamental crime was not the Holocaust, but rather the existence of Communism. Through the manipulation of numbers—only twenty-five million human lives fell victim to Hitler, one hundred million to Communism worldwide—the impression is created that Communism is four times worse than fascism and that the Holocaust was not a uniquely evil crime.&quot;

Jacques Sémelin writes that Courtois and Margolin &quot;view class genocide as the equivalent to racial genocide.&quot; Alongside Michael Mann, they contributed to &quot;the debates on comparisons between Nazism and communism&quot;, with Sémelin describing this as a theory also developed in &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot;. Margolin, along with Werth, addressed this comparison in a response printed in &quot;Le Monde&quot;; rather than &quot;indistinguishable evils&quot;, they emphasized a marked distinction in ideology. Courtois responded in the same newspaper with an essay in 1997. Werth compared the idea to ascribe all crimes committed by Communist states to communism with the idea to &quot;throw in the face of a liberal the crimes committed in all the countries that claimed to be liberal.&quot; According to historian Andrzej Paczkowski, only Courtois made the comparison between Communism and Nazism, while the other sections of the book &quot;are, in effect, narrowly focused monographs, which do not pretend to offer overarching explanations.&quot; Paczkowski wonders whether it can be applied &quot;the same standard of judgment to, on the one hand, an ideology that was destructive at its core, that openly planned genocide, and that had an agenda of aggression against all neighboring (and not just neighboring) states, and, on the other hand, an ideology that seemed clearly the opposite, that was based on the secular desire of humanity to achieve equality and social justice, and that promised a great leap of forward into freedom&quot;, and states that while a good question, it is hardly new and inappropriate because &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; is not &quot;about communism as an ideology or even about communism as a state-building phenomenon.&quot;

In a 2001 article for &quot;Human Rights Review&quot;, Vladimir Tismăneanu stated that while &quot;[a]nalytical distinctions between them are certainly important, and sometimes Courtois does not emphasize them sufficiently&quot;, their &quot;commonality in terms of complete contempt for the bourgeois state of law, human rights, and the universality of humankind regardless of spurious race and class distinctions is in my view beyond doubt.&quot; Tismăneanu said that in making this comparison, Courtois was drawing on Vasily Grossman&#x27;s earlier explorations of the same theme in &quot;Life and Fate&quot; and &quot;Forever Flowing&quot;. In 2012, Tismăneanu wrote that &quot;in the case of communism one can identify an inner dynamic that could and did in fact contrast the original promises to the sordidly criminal practices. In other words, there was a possible search for reforms, and even for socialism with a human face, within the communist world, but such a thing would have been unthinkable under Nazism. The chasm between theory and practice, or at least between the moral-humanist Marxian (or socialist) creed, and the Leninist, Stalinist (or Maoist, or Khmer Rouge) experiments was more than an intellectual fantasy.&quot;
==== Stéphane Courtois ====
Courtois considers Communism and Nazism to be distinct yet comparable totalitarian systems, stating that Communist regimes have killed &quot;approximately 100 million people in contrast to the approximately 25 million victims of the Nazis.&quot; Courtois claims that Nazi Germany&#x27;s methods of mass extermination were adopted from Soviet methods. As an example, Courtois cites the Nazi &quot;SS&quot; official Rudolf Höss who organized the infamous extermination camp, Auschwitz concentration camp, writing: &quot;The Reich Security Head Office issued to the commandants a full collection of reports concerning the Russian concentration camps. These described in great detail the conditions in, and organization of, the Russian camps, as supplied by former prisoners who had managed to escape. Great emphasis was placed on the fact that the Russians, by their massive employment of forced labor, had destroyed whole peoples.&quot; His remarks and comparisons were deemed by critics to be antisemitic. A report by the Wiesel Commission criticized the comparison of Gulag victims with Jewish Holocaust victims as an attempt at Holocaust trivialization. Courtois defended himself from the charges by citing the Russian-Jewish writer Vasily Grossman, who compared the deaths of kulaks&#x27; children to those of Jewish children who were put in the gas chambers.

Courtois states that the Soviet crimes against peoples living in the Caucasus and of large social groups in the Soviet Union could be called &quot;genocide&quot; and were not very much different from similar policies by the Nazi Party. For Courtois, both Communist and Nazi systems deemed &quot;a part of humanity unworthy of existence. The difference is that the Communist model is based on the class system, the Nazi model on race and territory.&quot; Courtois writes: &quot;Here, the genocide of a &#x27;class&#x27; may well be tantamount to the genocide of a &quot;race&quot;—the deliberate starvation of a child of a Ukrainian kulak as a result of the famine caused by Stalin&#x27;s regime &#x27;is equal to&#x27; the starvation of a Jewish child in the Warsaw ghetto as a result of the famine caused by the Nazi regime. According to Courtois, &quot;the intransigent facts demonstrate that Communist regimes have victimized approximately 100 million people in contrast to the approximately 25 million of the Nazis.&quot; Courtois further says that &quot;the Jewish genocide became a byword for modern barbarism, the epitome of twentieth-century mass terror. ... More recently, a single-minded focus on the Jewish genocide in an attempt to characterize the Holocaust as a unique atrocity has also prevented the assessment of other episodes of comparable magnitude in the Communist world. After all, it seems scarcely plausible that the victors who had helped bring about the destruction of a genocidal apparatus might themselves have put the very same methods into practice. When faced with this paradox, people generally preferred to bury their heads in sand.&quot;

==== Martin Malia ====
Malia strongly agrees with Courtois, describing it as &quot;a &#x27;tragedy of planetary dimensions&#x27; ..., with a grand total of victims variously estimated by contributors to the volume at between 85 million and 100 million&quot; and stating that what he terms the &quot;full power of the shock&quot; was &quot;delivered by the unavoidable comparison of this sum with that for Nazism, which at an estimated 25 million turns out to be distinctly less murderous than Communism.&quot; According to Malia, &quot;[t]he shocking dimensions of the Communist tragedy&quot; are &quot;hardly news to any serious student of twentieth-century history, at least when the different Leninist regimes are taken individually.&quot;

Malia mentions Courtois&#x27; argument that since Nuremberg jurisprudence (Nuremberg Trials) is incorporated into French law, the &quot;class genocide&quot; of Communism can be equated with the &quot;race genocide&quot; of Nazism and categorized as a crime against humanity. He states that Courtois raised the point of how Western intellectuals, Communist sympathizers and apologists for Communist leaders were complicit in Communist crimes, and that they only rejected them &quot;discreetly and in silence.&quot; According to Malia, the French right has been tainted by its association with the Nazi Vichy regime, whereas &quot;&#x27;knowing the truth about the U.S.S.R.&#x27; has never been an academic matter&quot; until the time the book was published. Malia then cites the example of the Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin, who was in need of Communist votes to gain a parliamentary majority. While the non-Gaullist right cited the book to attack the Jospin government &quot;for harboring allies with an unrepented &#x27;criminal past&#x27;&quot;, the Gaullists &quot;remained awkwardly in place.&quot;

Malia writes that the &quot;ultimate distinguishing characteristic&quot; of Nazism is the Holocaust which, according to Malia, is considered as historically unique. He laments that &quot;Hitler and Nazism are now a constant presence in Western print and on Western television&quot;, while &quot;Stalin and Communism materialize only sporadically&quot;, with the status of former Communists carrying no stigma. Malia also laments a double standard in de-Nazification and de-Stalinization, citing former Austrian president Kurt Waldheim, who &quot;was ostracized worldwide once his Nazi past was uncovered&quot;, while the same treatment was not applied to Communists, with Communist monuments still standing in the former Communist states.

Malia cites the liberal &quot;Le Monde&quot; as arguing that &quot;it is illegitimate to speak of a single Communist movement from Phnom Penh to Paris. Rather, the rampage of the Khmer Rouge is like the ethnic massacres of third-world Rwanda, or the &#x27;rural&#x27; Communism of Asia is radically different from the &#x27;urban&#x27; Communism of Europe; or Asian Communism is really only anticolonial nationalism&quot;, further stating that &quot;conflating sociologically diverse movements&quot; is &quot;merely a stratagem to obtain a higher body count against Communism, and thus against all the left.&quot; He criticizes this as &quot;Eurocentric condescension.&quot; Malia cites the conservative &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, summarizing its response as &quot;spurning reductionist sociology as a device to exculpate Communism&quot;, that &quot;Marxist-Leninist regimes are cast in the same ideological and organizational mold throughout the world&quot;, and that &quot;this pertinent point also had its admonitory subtext: that socialists of whatever stripe cannot be trusted to resist their ever-present demons on the far left (those popular fronts were no accident after all).&quot;

Malia writes that by reducing politics and ideology to anthropology, it &quot;assure[s] us that contrary to Hannah Arendt, the &#x27;Nazi/Soviet similarities&#x27; are insufficient to make denunciation a specifically &#x27;totalitarian&#x27; phenomenon.&quot; He criticizes this argument by stating that &quot;the difference between Nazi/Communist systems and Western ones is &#x27;not qualitative but quantitative.&#x27; By implication, therefore, singling out Communist and Nazi terror in order to equate them becomes Cold War slander—the ideological subtext, as it happens, of twenty-five years of &#x27;revisionist,&#x27; social-reductionist Sovietology.&quot; He further criticizes it by making the point that &quot;this fact-for-fact&#x27;s sake approach suggests that there is nothing specifically Communist about Communist terror—and, it would seem, nothing particularly Nazi about Nazi terror either.&quot; He states that &quot;the bloody Soviet experiment is banalized in one great gray anthropological blur; and the Soviet Union is transmogrified into just another country in just another age, neither more nor less evil than any other regime going&quot;, and dismisses this as &quot;obviously nonsense.&quot; For Malia, &quot;the problem of moral judgment&quot; is &quot;inseparable from any real understanding of the past&quot; and &quot;from being human.&quot;

==== Moral equivalence ====
Malia asks &quot;What of the moral equivalence of Communism and Nazism?&quot; Malia writes that &quot;[a]fter fifty years of debate, it is clear that no matter what the hard facts are, degrees of totalitarian evil will be measured as much in terms of present politics as in terms of past realities&quot; and that &quot;we will always encounter a double standard as long as there exist a left and a right&quot;, which he &quot;roughly define[s] as the priority of compassionate egalitarianism for the one, and as the primacy of prudential order for the other.&quot; Malia states that &quot;[s]ince neither principle can be applied absolutely without destroying society, the modern world lives in perpetual tension between the irresistible pressure for equality and the functional necessity of hierarchy.&quot; For Malia, it is &quot;this syndrome&quot; which &quot;gives the permanent qualitative advantage to Communism over Nazism in any evaluation of their quantitative atrocities. For the Communist projects, in origin, claimed commitment to universalistic and egalitarian goals, whereas the Nazi projects offered only unabashed national egoism&quot;, causing their practices to be &quot;comparable&quot; and their &quot;moral auras&quot; to be &quot;antithetical.&quot;

According to this argument, &quot;[a] moral man can have &#x27;no enemies to the left,&#x27; a perspective in which undue insistence on Communist crime only &#x27;plays into the hands of the right&#x27;—if, indeed, any anticommunism is not simply a mask for antiliberalism.&quot; Malia cites &quot;Le Monde&quot; as deeming &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; &quot;inopportune because equating Communism with Nazism removed the &#x27;last barriers to legitimating the extreme right,&#x27; that is, Le Pen.&quot; While stating it is true that &quot;Le Pen&#x27;s party and similar hate-mongering, xenophobic movements elsewhere in Europe represents an alarming new phenomenon that properly concerns all liberal democrats&quot;, Malia writes that in no way does it follow that &quot;Communism&#x27;s criminal past should be ignored or minimized.&quot; Malia writes that &quot;the persistence of such sophistry is precisely why &quot;The Black Book&quot; is so opportune&quot;, much like Courtois&#x27; reasoning for writing the book that &quot;the crimes of Communism have yet to receive a fair and just assessment from both historical and moral viewpoints.&quot;

About &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot;, Courtois further says: &quot;This book is one of the first attempts to study Communism with a focus on its criminal dimensions, in both the central regions of Communist rule and the farthest reaches of the globe. Some will say that most of these crimes were actions conducted in accordance with a system of law that was enforced by the regimes&#x27; official institutions, which were recognized internationally and whose heads of state continued to be welcomed with open arms. But was this not the case with Nazism as well? The crimes we shall expose are to be judged not by the standards of Communist regimes, but by the unwritten code of natural laws of humanity.&quot; Courtois states that &quot;[t]he legal ramification of crimes committed by a specific country were first confronted in 1945 at the Nuremberg Tribunal, which was organized by the Allies to consider the atrocities committed by the Nazis.&quot; Courtois writes that &quot;[a]n examination of all the crimes committed by the Leninist/Stalinist regime, and in the Communist world as a whole, reveals crimes that fit into each of these three categories&quot;, namely crimes against humanity, crimes against peace, and war crimes.

=== German edition: &quot;The Processing of Socialism in the GDR&quot; ===
The German edition contains an additional chapter on the Soviet-backed Communist regime in East Germany titled &quot;Die Aufarbeitung des Sozialismus in der DDR&quot; (&quot;The Processing of Socialism in the GDR&quot;). It consists of two subchapters, namely &quot;Politische Verbrechen in der DDR&quot; (&quot;Political Crimes in the GDR&quot;) by Ehrhart Neubert and &quot;Vom schwierigen Umgang mit der Wahrnehmung&quot; (&quot;On the Difficulty of Handling Perceptions&quot;) by Joachim Gauck.

== Reception ==
According to historian Jon Wiener, &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; &quot;received both praise and criticism. ... The book was especially controversial in France because it was published during the 1997 trial of Nazi collaborator Maurice Papon for crimes against humanity for his role in the deportation of Jews from Bordeaux to Hitler&#x27;s death camps. Papon&#x27;s lawyers introduced the book as evidence for the defense.&quot; The &quot;Black Book of Communism&quot; has been especially influential in Eastern Europe, where it was uncritically embraced by prominent politicians and intellectuals—many of these intellectuals popularized it using terminology and concepts popular with the radical right.

According to political scientist Stanley Hoffmann, &quot;[t]his gigantic volume, the sum of works of 11 historians, social scientists, and journalists, is less important for the content, but for the social storm it has provoked in France. ... What Werth and some of his colleagues object to is &#x27;the manipulation of the figures of the numbers of people killed&#x27; (Courtois talks of almost 100 million, including 65 million in China); &#x27;the use of shock formulas, the juxtaposition of histories aimed at asserting the comparability and, next, the identities of fascism, and Nazism, and communism.&#x27; Indeed, Courtois would have been far more effective if he had shown more restraint.&quot;

Whereas chapters of the book that describe the events in separate Communist states were praised for the most part, some generalizations made by Courtois in the introduction to the book became a subject of criticism both on scholarly and political grounds. Moreover, three of the book&#x27;s main contributors (Karel Bartosek, Jean-Louis Margolin, and Nicolas Werth) publicly disassociated themselves from Courtois&#x27; statements in the introduction and criticized his editorial conduct. Margolin and Werth felt that Courtois was &quot;obsessed&quot; with arriving at a total of 100 million killed, which resulted in &quot;sloppy and biased scholarship&quot;, faulted him for exaggerating death tolls in specific countries, and rejected the comparison between Communism and Nazism.

Several reviewers have singled out Werth&#x27;s &quot;State against Its People&quot; as being the most notable and best researched contribution in the book. Historian Ronald Aronson stated that &quot;[Werth] is concerned, fortunately, neither to minimize nor to maximize numbers, but to accurately determine what happened.&quot; Historian Peter Kenez criticized the chapter written by Werth, arguing that &quot;Werth can also be an extremely careless historian. He gives the number of Bolsheviks in October 1917 as 2,000, which is a ridiculous underestimate. He quotes from a letter of Lenin to Alexander Shliapnikov and gives the date as 17 October 1917; the letter could hardly have originated at that time, since in it Lenin talks about the need to defeat the Tsarist government, and turn the war into a civil conflict. He gives credit to the Austro-Hungarian rather than the German army for the conquest of Poland in 1915. He describes the Provisional Government as &#x27;elected&#x27;. He incorrectly writes that the peasant rebels during the civil war did more harm to the Reds than to the Whites, and so on.&quot; Historian Michael Ellman stated that the book&#x27;s estimate of &quot;at least 500,000&quot; deaths during the Soviet famine of 1946–1947 &quot;is formulated in an extremely conservative way, since the actual number of victims was much larger&quot;, with 1,000,000–1,500,000 excess deaths. Historians such as Hiroaki Kuromiya and Mark Tauger challenged the authors&#x27; thesis that the famine of 1933 was largely artificial and genocidal.

Historian Alexander Dallin questioned &quot;[w]hether all these cases, from Hungary to Afghanistan, have a single essence and thus deserve to be lumped together—just because they are labeled Marxist or communist—is a question the authors scarcely discuss.&quot; Historians Jens Mecklenburg and Wolfgang Wippermann wrote that a connection between the events in Pol Pot&#x27;s Cambodia and Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union are far from evident and that Pol Pot&#x27;s study of Marxism in Paris is insufficient for connecting radical Soviet industrialism and the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s murderous anti-urbanism under the same category. Historian Michael David-Fox criticized the figures as well as the idea to combine loosely connected events under a single category of Communist death toll, blaming Courtois for their manipulation and deliberate inflation which are presented to advocate the idea that Communism was a greater evil than Nazism. In particular, David-Fox criticized the idea to connect the deaths with some &quot;generic Communism&quot; concept, defined down to the common denominator of party movements founded by intellectuals. David-Fox also described &quot;Malia&#x27;s comparison and rhetorical equation of erstwhile social-history revisionists in the Soviet field with David Irving and other Holocaust deniers&quot; as &quot;a quintessentially ideological move.&quot;

Historian Tony Judt wrote that &quot;[t]he myth of the well-intentioned founders—the good czar Lenin betrayed by his evil heirs—has been laid to rest for good. No one will any longer be able to claim ignorance or uncertainty about the criminal nature of Communism.&quot; In &quot;History: Reviews of New Books&quot;, Jack M. Lauber compared its impact to that of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;. Political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu, whose work focuses on Eastern Europe, stated that &quot;the &quot;Black Book of Communism&quot; succeeds in demonstrating ... that Communism in its Leninist version (and, one must recognize, this has been the only successful application of the original dogma) was from the very outset inimical to the values of individual rights and human freedom.&quot; In &quot;Russian History&quot;, the journal of the Institute of History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Jennifer Wynot wrote: &quot;&quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; stands out as a significant work that should be required reading for all modern historians. Each essay stands alone as an important scholarly contribution. At the same time, the essays hang together well. It is interesting also that all of the writers have political roots in European left.&quot;

Historian Jolanta Pekacz said that the &quot;archival revelations of &quot;The Black Book&quot; collapse the myth of a benign, initial phase of communism before it was diverted from the right path by circumstances.&quot; Political scientist Robert Legvold summarized the authors as charging that Communism was a criminal system, while others such as Werth gave more nuanced views, and stated that &quot;despite Courtois&#x27; brave attempt in the conclusion, however, the authors fail to answer their own central question: Why did communism, when in power, start and stay so murderous?&quot; Historian Andrzej Paczkowski cited the numerous critiques, including it being called &quot;a crudely anticommunist, anti-Semitic work&quot;, and agreed that &quot;excessive moralizing makes objective analysis of the past difficult—and perhaps impossible&quot;, and the book has weaknesses but wrote that it has had two positive effects, among them stirring a debate about the implementation of totalitarian ideologies and &quot;an exhaustive balance sheet about one aspect of the worldwide phenomenon of communism.&quot; According to honorary professor David J. Galloway, &quot;&quot;The Black Book&quot; provides an excellent survey of scholarship on the Soviet system and the systems of other communist states&quot;, and said that this emphasis is valuable.

=== Popular press ===
&quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; received praise in many publications in the United Kingdom and the United States, including the &quot;East Valley Tribune&quot;, &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, &quot;Insight on the News&quot;, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, &quot;Library Journal&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;Salon&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;The Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post Book World&quot;, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, and &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;. Philosopher Alan Ryan wrote that &quot;[t]o the extent that the book has a literary style, it is that of the recording angel; this is the body count of a colossal, wholly failed social, economic, political and psychological experiment. It is a criminal indictment, and it rightly reads like one.&quot; Ryan stated that the authors do not astonish their readers, &quot;dramatize the sufferings of the victims of Communism&quot;, or focus on quarrels over exact numbers of victims, affirming that there is no serious moral difference between the lower and higher estimated numbers. Speaking of the relative immorality of Communism and Nazism, Ryan said that the &quot;body count tips the scales against Communism&quot;, but that if the &quot;intrinsic evil of the entire project&quot; is considered, Nazism is still worse because it was exterminationist.

Historian Noam Chomsky criticized the book and its reception as one-sided by outlining economist Amartya Sen&#x27;s research on hunger. While India&#x27;s democratic institutions prevented famines, its excess of mortality over China—potentially attributable to the latter&#x27;s more equal distribution of medical and other resources—was nonetheless close to 4 million per year for non-famine years. Chomsky wrote that &quot;supposing we now apply the methodology of the &quot;Black Book&quot;&quot; to India, &quot;the democratic capitalist &#x27;experiment&#x27; has caused more deaths than in the entire history of ... Communism everywhere since 1917: over 100 million deaths by 1979, and tens of millions more since, in India alone.&quot; Historian Jacques Julliard and philosopher Jean-François Revel defended the book. According to journalist Gilles Perrault, the book ignores the effect of international factors, including military interventions, invasions, sanctions, and coups, on the Communist experience.

== Legacy ==
Reflecting on &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; in the &quot;Human Rights Review&quot;, sociologist John Torpey wrote: &quot;In view of &quot;The Black Book&quot;″s relatively scanty scholarly contribution, it is hard to read the book in other than political terms. In this regard, &quot;The Black Book&quot; may be seen as an effort to legitimize the claims to memorialization and reparations of those who suffered under Communism. Such claims have become high stakes in an era that frequently rewards those who can demonstrate that they, too, have been victimized in the past.&quot; In a 2001 article for &quot;The Journal of American History&quot;, professor of history Shane J. Maddock wrote: &quot;Since its publication in France in 1997, &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; has played a dual role, both chronicling the crimes of various Communist regimes and also serving as a text that reveals the shifting status of Marxism in the aftermath of the Cold War. Much of the controversy that has surrounded the book has focused on Stephane Courtois&#x27;s introduction, in which he argues that communism represents a greater evil than Nazism, largely based on Marxism-Leninism&#x27;s heftier death tally.&quot; In &quot;The Criminalisation of Communism in the European Political Space after the Cold War&quot; (2018), political scientist Laure Neumayer states that the book has played a major role in what she terms the criminalization of Communism in the European political space in the post Cold War-era. According to Neumayer, &quot;by making criminality the very essence of communism, by explicitly equating the &#x27;race genocide&#x27; of Nazism with the &#x27;class genocide&#x27; of Communism in connection with the Ukrainian Great Famine of 1932–1933, the &quot;Black Book of Communism&quot; contributed to legitimising the equivalence of Nazi and Communist crimes. The book figures prominently in the &#x27;spaces of the anti-communist cause&#x27; comparably structured in the former satellite countries, which are a major source of the discourse criminalising the Socialist period.&quot;

In a 2005 &quot;International History Review&quot; article, historian Donald Reid states that &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; opened the way to a new anti-communism, quoting fellow historian Marc Lazar as saying that &quot;just as the intense relationship of the French with their national history created the conditions for the Vichy syndrome, their intense relationship with the Communist project could have similar consequences for the national psyche&quot;, and that Courtois, Lazar&#x27;s former collaborator, believes French intellectuals have never &quot;done their mourning of revolutionary ideology and of Leninism.&quot; A 2019 review for &quot;The American Historical Review&quot; about &quot;The Cambridge History of Communism&quot; said: &quot;Unlike the cardboard cutouts of Communist leadership presented in ideologically charged studies like &quot;The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression&quot; (1997), these essays are both nuanced and balanced, presenting Lenin and Stalin as human leaders driven as much by realpolitik and personal histories and events as by Communist ideology.&quot; In a 2019 Africa Check article, Naphtali Khumalo said that the 100 million estimate from &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; &quot;is still up for debate by historians, political scientists and economists. It&#x27;s not an easy claim to fact-check, and is ultimately a matter of opinion.&quot; In 2020, political scientist Valentin Behr &quot;et al.&quot; wrote that &quot;the book was a turning point in the emergence of a consensual historical narrative across the former East-West divide as it enabled the formation of a revamped pan-European anti-communist movement.&quot; In a 2021 editorial in the eco-socialist journal &quot;Capitalism Nature Socialism&quot;, Salvatore Engel-Di Mauro &quot;et al&quot;. describe &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; as &quot;a 1997 propaganda volume that suits a more recent China-bashing campaign, where the Communist Party of China is purposefully conflated with communism. Just like anarchism should not be confused with chaos and terrorism, communism should not be confused, like those on the Right do, with the state socialist regimes, which are to be rigorously critiqued but should nonetheless be considered part of it, rather than denying any family resemblances with communism, like some on the Left do.&quot; According to Engel-Di Mauro &quot;et al.&quot;, the 100 million estimate popularized by &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; is used as an anti-communist trope to dismiss any criticism of capitalism and support for socialism.

== Sequels ==
As an Anti-Communist book, The &quot;Black Book of Communism&quot; was followed by the publication in 2002 of a series entitled &quot;Du passé faisons table rase! Histoire et mémoire du communisme en Europe&quot; with the same imprint. The first edition included the subtitle &quot;&quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; has not said everything.&quot; Like the first effort, this second work was edited by Courtois. The book focused on the history of Communism in Eastern Europe. Several translations of the book were marketed as the second volume of &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot;, titled &quot;Das Schwarzbuch of Kommunismus 2. Das schwere Erbe der Ideologie&quot;, &quot;Chernata kniga na komunizma 2. chast&quot;, and &quot;Il libro nero del comunismo europeo&quot;.

&quot;Le Siècle des communismes&quot;, a collective work of twenty academics, was a response to both François Furet&#x27;s &quot;Le passé d&#x27;une Illusion&quot; and &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot;. It broke communism down into series of discrete movements, with mixed positive and negative results. &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; prompted the publication of several other &quot;black books&quot; which argued that similar chronicles of violence and death tolls can be constructed from an examination of capitalism and colonialism.

In 2007, Courtois edited Éditions Larousse&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire du communisme&quot;. In 2008, Courtois took part to the writing of &quot;The Black Book of the French Revolution&quot;, a similar work of historical revisionism which proved to be controversial like &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; and received mostly negative reviews from both the press and historians. Courtois went back to its proposed link between the French Revolution and the October Revolution.

<text>Gotan Project is a musical group based in Paris (France), consisting of musicians Eduardo Makaroff (Argentina), Philippe Cohen Solal (French) and Christoph H. Müller (Swiss), a former member of Touch El Arab.

==History==
Gotan Project formed in 1999. Their first release was &quot;Vuelvo Al Sur/El Capitalismo Foráneo&quot; in 2000, followed by the album &quot;La Revancha del Tango&quot; in 2001. Their music is based on Argentine tango, but also uses elements such as samples, beats, and breaks.

Live material was broadcast on Gilles Peterson&#x27;s world music show Worldwide on BBC Radio 1 in May 2004. The band has also released a DJ set: &quot;Inspiración Espiración - A Gotan Project DJ Set Selected &amp; Mixed by Philippe Cohen Solal&quot; (2004). This album is a compilation of classic tangos from the likes of Aníbal Troilo, Ástor Piazzolla and Gotan Project remixes. The album also includes a bonus CD with the track &quot;La Cruz del Sur&quot;which was meant to be included on &quot;La Revancha del Tango&quot;, but did not make the cut in 2001.

In 2006 they released a second studio album, &quot;Lunático&quot;, and in 2010 &quot;Tango 3.0&quot;, their last studio album to date.

==Band name==
The name of the trio is the word &quot;tango&quot; with the order of its syllables reversed. Reversing syllables in this way is a form of word play called &quot;al vesre&quot; that is common in Lunfardo, an argot of Rioplatense Spanish.

== Discography ==

* &quot;La Revancha del Tango&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Lunático&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Tango 3.0&quot; (2010)

== Commercial use ==
The song &quot;Santa Maria (del Buen Ayre)&quot; was used in the films &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (2002), &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; (2004), and &quot;Knight and Day&quot; (2010).

<text>Hans F. Sennholz (; ; 3 February 1922 – 23 June 2007) was a German-born American Austrian School economist and prolific author who studied under Ludwig von Mises. A Luftwaffe pilot during World War II, he was shot down over North Africa on 31 August 1942, and spent the remainder of the war in a POW camp in the United States.

After returning to Germany, Sennholz took degrees at the universities of Marburg in 1948 and Köln in 1949. He returned to the United States to study for a Ph.D. at New York University where he became Mises&#x27; first Ph.D. student in the United States. He taught economics at Grove City College, 1956–1992. After he retired, he became president of the Foundation for Economic Education, 1992–1997.

==Early life==

=== World War II ===
He was drafted into the Luftwaffe during World War II and became the pilot of a Messerschmitt Bf 109, earning the Iron Cross for valor from his engagements in Norway, France, and Russia. He was shot down over North Africa on August 31, 1942, at a time when the battle for north Africa was intensifying, and spent the remainder of the war in a POW camp in the United States, ultimately located to a POW camp in Wilson, Arkansas, where he worked from 1945 to 1946 at the Wilson dairy farm &quot;milking 20 cows twice a day&quot;.

==== Wartime diary ====
During his stay in Arkansas, he maintained a journal of his time as a POW. When he was released to Germany in 1946, he gave the journal to a trusted guard. &quot;Please send this to my home when the time comes.&quot; But the journal never arrived.

In 1964, William Harrison, a factory worker in Jonesboro, Arkansas, found the journal on the bank of Bay Ditch, a drainage artery bordering &#x27;old&#x27; Highway 63. In November 1985, Harrison took the journal to Scott Darwin, a professor of German at Arkansas State University. Harrison was told that the obsolete German script could not be translated by anyone on staff. Its translation would come by Erika Cohen, having attended German schools in the 1930s when the style was in use. She was the German-born wife of Robert S. Cohen, M.D.; they married while he was serving in the U.S. Army Medical Corps.

The journal told the story of its unidentified author&#x27;s life as a Luftwaffe pilot, being shot down in north Africa and his subsequent time as a German POW in Arkansas. This, perhaps, was intentional, as POWs were not allowed personal possessions.

In 1988, Harrison published the story, &quot;Who Wrote the Diary&quot;, in &quot;Die Welt&quot;, a large-circulation German newspaper. Willie Weischhoff read the story, which mentioned him by name, and wrote to his friend and fellow German POW, Hans Sennholz, a professor of economics at Grove City College. On October 20, 1988, Harrison received a letter from Sennholz stating: &quot;I am the POW author you have been looking for.&quot;

==Post-war education and career==
After returning to Germany, Sennholz took degrees at the universities of Marburg in 1948 and Köln in 1949. He then moved to the United States to study for a Ph.D. at New York University. He was Ludwig von Mises&#x27; first PhD student in the United States. He taught economics at Grove City College, 1956–1992, having been hired as department chair upon arrival. After he retired, he became president of the Foundation for Economic Education, 1992–1997. Calvinist Political Philosopher, John W. Robbins, pointed out in a book printed in honor of Sennholz shortly after his death that &quot;Sennholz, ... rests his defense of a free society on revelation.&quot;

Fellow Austrian School economist, Joseph Salerno, praised Sennholz as an under-appreciated member of the Austrian School who &quot;writes so clearly on such a broad range of topics that he is in danger of suffering the same fate as Say and Bastiat. As Joseph Schumpeter pointed out, these two brilliant nineteenth-century French economists, who were also masters of economic rhetoric, wrote with such clarity and style that their work was misjudged by their British inferiors as &#x27;shallow&#x27; and &#x27;superficial&#x27;.&quot;

==Sennholz&#x27;s influence==
2008 U.S. presidential candidate, Ron Paul, credits his interest in economics to meeting Sennholz and getting to know him well. Peter Boettke, Director of the F. A. Hayek Program for Advanced Study in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, first learned economics from Sennholz as a student at Grove City College.

<text>Royal Air Force Mullaghmore or more simply RAF Mullaghmore is a former Royal Air Force station located southwest of Ballymoney, County Antrim, Northern Ireland and northeast of Garvagh, County Londonderry.

==History==

It was a United States Army Air Forces 8th Air Force Composite Command base until being passed to the Royal Air Force in May 1944 for use as a training establishment.

Between December 1943 and February 1944 the airfield was used the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF)&#x27;s 6th Replacement and Training Squadron (Bombardment) and the 6th Combat Crew Replacement Centre before the unit moved to RAF Cheddington. The airfield was then used for storage until May 1944.

The following units were based there:
* No. 4 Refresher Flying Unit RAF which moved from RAF Haverfordwest and stayed between October 1945 and March 1945
* No. 7 (Coastal) OTU flying Vickers Wellingtons between December 1942 and January 1944
* No. 104 (Transport) OTU arrived from RAF Maghaberry flying Vickers Wellingtons between October 1943 and January 1944
* No. 281 Squadron RAF
* 815 Naval Air Squadron
* 825 Naval Air Squadron
* 842 Naval Air Squadron
* 850 Naval Air Squadron
* 1771 Naval Air Squadron
* Loran Training Unit RAF (October 1944 – April 1945)

The airfield was closed and placed on care and maintenance during May 1945.

==Current use==

The airfield, now in private hands, is used as a microlight base. It has been known locally as Aghadowey Aerodrome.

<text>Howard Ben Tré (May 13, 1949 - June 20, 2020) was an American glass artist. He worked with poured glass, creating small sculptures and large scale public artworks. &quot;Glass&quot; magazine has called Ben Tré a pioneer in the technique of using hot glass casting in fine art.

==Personal life and education==

Howard Ben Tré was born May 13, 1949, in Brooklyn, New York. In the 1960s he attended Brooklyn College for two years and was a political activist.

In the 1970s he left New York with his wife, Gay, for Oregon. At Portland State University he learned about the university&#x27;s well-known glass-blowing shop and began studying the creation process, finding influence in religious objects. He would obtain his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Portland State. Dale Chihuly recruited Ben Tré to the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) from Portland, Oregon where he would graduate with a Masters of Fine Arts in 1980.

His wife Gay Ben Tré was actively involved in planning and siting the installation of his art. They divorced amicably and remained friends for the rest of his life. He married Wendy MacGaw in 2004. He lived and worked in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

Howard Ben Tré died June 20, 2020, in hospice care at his home in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

==Artistic career==

He started blowing glass. Through his education at Portland State University, he would discover the process of pouring glass. Pulling inspiration from African and Japanese religious icons and figures, he uses his artwork to explore connections between the two.

Ben Tré utilized his training as an industrial manufacturing master technician to create glass artworks based on traditional methods. His studio space, located in Pawtucket, Rhode Island is where he designed, made molds and completed his work. He created fine art castings by pouring molten glass into sand molds, applying heat and then cooling them for months. The form is then dug out from the sand mold, sand blasted, cut, ground, and polished. Many of Ben Tré&#x27;s works involve the use of gold leaf; by way of wrapping portions of works or installing lead bars within the pieces covered with gold leaf. The glass sculptures are often symmetrical. His wife, Gay, assisted in the designing and planning of his large scale works, including the installation of his public art.

===Reception===

In lieu of Ben Tré&#x27;s 2001 exhibition at the Orange County Museum of Art, critic Roberta Carasso described his work as being &quot;part of the glass revolution&quot;. The Christian Science Monitor described his poured glass works as timeless, monumental and &quot;hulking, architectural forms he creates...existed before the dawn of recorded history.&quot; Arthur Danto stated in 2000 that Ben Tré&#x27;s glass works were redefining and powerful, and that he creates &quot;a kind of pleasure that we don&#x27;t usually associate with art.&quot;

<doc id="1054698" wikidata="Q27414" url="?curid=1054698" title="Caniformia">
<text>Caniformia is a suborder within the order Carnivora consisting of &quot;dog-like&quot; carnivorans. They include dogs (wolves, foxes, etc.), bears, raccoons, and mustelids. The Pinnipedia (seals, walruses and sea lions) are also assigned to this group. The center of diversification for the Caniformia is North America and northern Eurasia. Caniformia stands in contrast to the other suborder of Carnivora, the Feliformia (&quot;cat-like&quot; carnivorans), the center of diversification of which was in Africa and southern Asia.

==Description==
Most members of this group have nonretractile claws (the fisher, marten, sea otter (forepaws only), red panda, and ringtail, and some foxes have retractile or semi-retractile claws) and tend to be plantigrade (with the exception of the Canidae). Other traits that separate the Caniformia from the Feliformia is that caniforms have longer jaws and more teeth, with less specialized carnassial teeth. They also tend more towards omnivory and opportunistic feeding, while the feliforms, other than the viverrids, are more specialized for eating meat. Caniforms have single-chambered or partially divided auditory bullae, composed of a single bone, while in feliforms, the auditory bullae are double-chambered, composed of two bones joined by a septum. In the Caniformia, the bulbourethral glands and vesicula seminalis are always absent. Relative to body size, the baculum is usually longer in the Caniformia than in the Feliformia.

== Extant families ==

Caniformia consists of nine extant families, with three extinct families also recognized. The extant families are monophyletic according to phylogenetic molecular analysis. Terrestrial caniforms in the wild are found on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, while pinnipeds are distributed throughout the world&#x27;s oceans.

Family Canidae (dogs and other canids) includes wolves, dogs, coyotes, and foxes, as well as a number of less familiar animals. The family is currently divided into two major groups, the true dogs (tribe Canini), which includes nine genera, and the true foxes (tribe Vulpini) with two genera. In addition, two basal genera are described. About 35 species of extant canids are currently recognized. Canids are the most social of all caniforms, sometimes living in packs. The dog is the most diverse of all mammals in terms of body structure variants.

Family Ursidae (bears) is the largest of all the land caniforms. Eight species are recognized, divided into five genera. They range from the large polar bear ( in males) to the small sun bear ( in males) and from the endangered giant panda to the very common black bear. Common characteristics of modern bears include a large body with stocky legs, a long snout, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and a short tail. Most bears are omnivorous, with largely varied diets that include both plants and animals. The polar bear is the most carnivorous of bears due to the arctic climate in which it lives, and shows a preference for eating seals. The giant panda is the most herbivorous bear and has evolved a number of adaptations, including a sixth &quot;toe&quot;, specialized teeth, and strong jaw muscles, to allow it to feed nearly exclusively on bamboo, a tough member of the grass family. The sloth bear has some adaptations for ant and termite eating, with a long snout, powerful claws, and missing upper front teeth, though it also eats honey and fruit.

Family Ailuridae consists today of a single species, the red panda, which was once thought to be included in the Procyonidae or Ursidae lineages, but is now placed in its own family along with a number of extinct species. It is found in the Himalayas, including southern China, Nepal, Bhutan, India, and Pakistan. Fossil species of the family are also found in North America.

Family Mephitidae (skunks and stink badgers) was once classified as mustelids, but are now recognized as a lineage in their own right. The 12 species of skunks are divided into four genera: &quot;Mephitis&quot; (hooded and striped skunks, two species), &quot;Spilogale&quot; (spotted skunks, four species), &quot;Mydaus&quot; (stink badgers, two species) and &quot;Conepatus&quot; (hog-nosed skunks, four species). The two skunk species in the genus &quot;Mydaus&quot; inhabit Indonesia and the Philippines; all other skunks inhabit the Americas from Canada to central South America.

Family Mustelidae (badgers, weasels and otters) is the largest family of carnivora, with 22 extant genera and roughly 57 extant species. While highly variable in shape, size, and behavior, most mustelids are smaller animals with short legs, short, round ears, and thick fur. Mustelids are predominantly carnivorous. While not all share identical dentition, they all possess teeth adapted for eating flesh, including the presence of shearing carnassials.

Members of Family Procyonidae (raccoons, coatis) are smallish animals, with generally slender bodies and long tails. Nineteen extant species in six genera are currently recognized. Except for the kinkajou, all procyonids have banded tails and distinct facial markings, and like bears, are plantigrade, walking on the soles of their feet. Most species have nonretractile claws. Early procyonids may have been an offshoot of the canids that adapted to more omnivorous diets.

Pinnipedia (seals, sea lions, and walruses clade) is a widely distributed and diverse group of semiaquatic marine mammals which is closely related to an extinct group of pinnipeds, &quot;Enaliarctos&quot;. While support for the monophyly of pinnipeds is strong, the relationship of pinnipeds to terrestrial mammals is still unclear. Some studies support the hypothesis that the bears are their closest relatives, while others support a closer relationship to the mustelids.

Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 million years ago (Mya) during the Eocene.

The clade is currently divided into three families:

:Family Phocidae (true or earless seals) consists of around 19 species of highly aquatic, barrel-shaped animals ranging from and in length (the ringed seal), to and (southern elephant seal). Phocids are found throughout the world&#x27;s oceans.

:Family Otariidae (eared seals, sea lions, fur seals) is distributed throughout the world&#x27;s oceans with the exception of the North Atlantic. The 15 species (divided into seven genera) of otariids are distinguished from phocids by visible external ears (pinnae), more dog-like faces, and the ability to turn their rear flippers forward.

:Family Odobenidae currently includes a single species, the walrus. A large (), distinctive pinniped with long whiskers and tusks, the walrus has a discontinuous circumpolar distribution in the Arctic Ocean and sub-Arctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is primarily a benthic forager of bivalve mollusks and other marine invertebrates.

== Evolution ==
Caniforms first appeared as tree-climbing, superficially marten-like carnivores in the Eocene around 42 Mya. &quot;Miacis cognitus&quot; was probably an early caniform. Like many other early carnivorans it was well suited for tree climbing with needle-sharp claws, and had limbs and joints that resemble those of modern carnivorans. &quot;M. cognitus&quot; was probably a very agile forest dweller that preyed on smaller animals, such as small mammals, reptiles, and birds.
Debate continues on the origin of pinnipeds. Recent molecular evidence suggests pinnipeds evolved from a bear-like ancestor about 23 Mya during the late Oligocene or early Miocene epochs, a transitional period between the warmer Paleogene and cooler Neogene periods. However, discovery of the fossil &quot;Puijila darwini&quot; in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut suggests a different scenario. Like a modern otter, &quot;Puijila&quot; had a long tail, short limbs, and webbed feet instead of flippers. However, its limbs and shoulders were more robust, and &quot;Puijila&quot; likely had been a quadrupedal swimmer–retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that give rise to the major swimming types employed by modern pinnipeds. &quot;Puijila&quot; has been assigned to a clade of mustelids.

<text>Charles Lucien Léandre (1862–1934) was a French caricaturist and painter. He was born at Champsecret (Orne), and studied painting under Émile Bin and Alexandre Cabanel.

==Early life==
Charles Lucien Léandre was born on July 22, 1864, in Champsecret. His father was the mayor of the town in which they lived until his death in 1868. At 16, Léandre met the painter Émile Bin, who would instruct Léandre. Léandre received multiple awards for his artistic talents in his twenties.

==Work and career==
From 1887 Léandre figured among the exhibitors of the Salon, where he showed numerous portraits and genre pictures, but his popular fame is due to his comic drawings and caricatures. The series of the &quot;Gotha des souverains,&quot; published in Le Rire, and Léandre&#x27;s other work like that seen in &quot;L&#x27;Assiette au Beurre&quot; placed him in the front rank of contemporary caricaturists.

Besides his contributions to &quot;Le Rire&quot;, &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and other comic journals, he published a series of albums: &quot;Nocturnes&quot;, &quot;Le Musée des souverains&quot;, and &quot;Paris et la province&quot;. In 1904, he created the Société des Peintres Humoristes.

Léandre produced admirable work in lithography, and designed many memorable posters, such as the &quot;Yvette Guilbert.&quot; &quot;Les nouveaux mariés,&quot; &quot;Joseph Prudhomme,&quot; &quot;Les Lutteurs,&quot; and &quot;La Femme au chien.&quot;

He died in 1934 in his Caulaincourt street studio, in Montmartre.

==Honors==
Léandre won a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle in 1889 for a large size painting: &quot;la Mère ou « Dormio cor meum vigilat »&quot; (&quot;Je dors mais mon coeur veille&quot;). In 1900, at the next Exposition Universelle, he was among the five lithographic artists selected to achieve two compositions on a selected theme; he received a gold medal at this contest.

He was created a knight of the Legion of Honour. In 1921, he got the Medal of Honour of the Société des artistes français, in the engraving section, one of the more important honorary awards an artist could obtain in Paris. In 1925, Charles Léandre was promoted an Officer of the Legion of Honour.

<doc id="1054705" wikidata="Q8035578" url="?curid=1054705" title="World Conker Championships">
<text>The World Conker Championships (WCC) is a conkers tournament held annually on the second Sunday in October in the county of Northamptonshire, England. Two players use conkers threaded onto a string and take turns to strike the other&#x27;s nut until it shatters. Players from around the world enter the tournament, competing in a knock-out format in both team and individual formats, with titles for men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and youth categories. Up to 5,000 spectators watch around 400 players participating. from many countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, the United States and the United Kingdom.

==History==

The World Conker Championships began in 1965 when a group of anglers in Ashton held a conker contest at the Chequered Skipper public house when the weather was too bad to go fishing. At the event, a small collection was made for charity, by Garth Crooks, who was having dinner in the pub with his family. Since then the event has raised over £420,000 for charities supporting the visually impaired and at least £2,500 is donated yearly. The event was held in Ashton for 45 years before moving to a larger venue at the Shuckburgh Arms in Southwick, Northamptonshire in 2009.

The tournament has been threatened with conker shortages over the years, in 1976 conkers used in the tournament had to be flown in from Jersey, in 1980 freak spring weather was one of the factors that threatened the World Conker Championships causing a conker shortage, and in 1982 a late frost killed off the horse chestnut blossom resulting in a failed conker harvest.
On 6 October 2011, organisers were forced to cancel the event over safety fears with high winds being forecast. 
In 2012, the championships were cancelled again when a suitable venue couldn&#x27;t be found in time.

Concerns for the future of the event were voiced over the horse-chestnut leaf miner moth, &quot;Cameraria ohridella&quot;, which has appeared in the region and could have a detrimental effect on the UK&#x27;s horse chestnut population affecting conker yields.

On 9 October 2017, Chelsea pensioner John Riley won the men&#x27;s tournament at the age of 85, quite possibly making him the oldest world champion on the planet.

In 2022, Fee Aylmore won the women&#x27;s event after 30 years of trying.

In 2024, allegations of cheating were levelled at the men&#x27;s event winner David Jakins by men&#x27;s runner-up Alastair Johnson-Ferguson, when a brown-painted fake steel conker was discovered in his pocket. Jakins was also one of the event&#x27;s organisers, responsible for the handing out of chestnuts used by the competitors. He was cleared of any suspicion after a review of video evidence, by fellow organiser St. John Burkett.

==WCC rules==

Players&#x27; Rules of Engagement for the Noble Game of Conkers as follows:
#Prior to the game, over 2,000 conkers (horse chestnuts) of the required 1.25-inch (30 mm) width are collected, drilled and strung ready by tournament officials. All conkers and laces are supplied by the World Conker Championships.
# Conkers are drawn ‘blind’ from a bag, and players may reject up to three selected conkers.
# Each game will commence with a toss of a coin, the winner of the toss may elect to strike or receive.
# A distance of no less than 8&quot; or 20 cm of lace must be between knuckle and nut.
# Each player then takes three alternate strikes at the opponent&#x27;s conker.
# Each attempted strike must be clearly aimed at the nut, no deliberate miss hits.
# The game will be decided once one of the conkers is smashed.
# A small piece of nut or skin remaining (less than a third) shall be judged out, it must be enough to mount an attack.
# If both nuts smash at the same time then the match shall be replayed.
# Any nut being knocked from the lace but not smashing may be re threaded and the game continued.
# A player causing a knotting of the laces (a snag) will be noted, three snags will lead to disqualification.
# If a game lasts for more than five minutes then play will halt and the &quot;5-minute rule&quot; will come into effect. Each player will be allowed up to nine further strikes at their opponent&#x27;s nut, again alternating three strikes each. If neither conker has been smashed at the end of the nine strikes then the player who strikes the nut the most times during this period will be judged the winner. If this is equal, then play continues, one strike each in turn, until one player hits and the other misses.

<text>The Korea Football Association () is the governing body of football and futsal within South Korea. It sanctions professional, semi-professional and amateur football in South Korea. Founded in 1933, the governing body became affiliated with FIFA twenty years later in 1948, and the Asian Football Confederation in 1954.

==History==
In 1921, the first All Joseon Football Tournament was held, and in 1933, the Korea Football Association was organized (following the foundation of Joseon Referees&#x27; Association in 1928), which created a foundation to disseminate and develop the sport. Park Seung-bin was the first president of the KFA, charged with the task of promoting and spreading organised football in Korea.

The Korea Football Association was reinstated in 1948, following the establishment of the Republic of Korea. The KFA became a member of FIFA, the international football governing body that same year. It later joined the AFC (Asian Football Confederation) in 1954.

The KFA tried to give pardons to 100 people formerly employed in football including 48 match-fixing participants on 28 March 2023, but cancelled the pardons after facing objections of fans and journalists for three days.

<text>The Introspection Rundown is a controversial Church of Scientology auditing process that is intended to handle a psychotic episode or complete mental breakdown. Introspection is defined for the purpose of this rundown as a condition where the person is &quot;looking into one&#x27;s own mind, feelings, reactions, etc.&quot; The result is &quot;the person extroverted, no longer looking inward worriedly continuously without end.&quot;

The Introspection Rundown came under public scrutiny after the death of Lisa McPherson in 1995. The rundown was created by L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, and released 24 January 1974.

==Overview==

In Scientology, a &quot;rundown&quot; is a procedure set out as a series of steps to produce a particular result, or phenomenon. Hubbard outlined the Introspection Rundown in three technical bulletins.

The first step of the Introspection Rundown is &quot;isolate the person wholly with all attendants completely muzzled (no speech).&quot; Auditing sessions are given frequently, otherwise the person is not spoken to.

To determine the end of isolation the supervisor in charge case of the person being isolated tests the person&#x27;s condition by writing a note, such as &quot;Dear Joe. What can you guarantee me if you are let out of isolation?&quot; If Joe&#x27;s answer shows continued irresponsibility, the supervisor must write back something along the lines of, &quot;Dear Joe. I&#x27;m sorry but it is no go on coming out of isolation yet,&quot; including the reasons of why not. When it is obvious the person is out of his psychosis and up to the responsibility of living with others his isolation is ended.

To administer this rundown a Scientologist requires an education in Scientology beliefs and practices (which are dubbed &quot;technologies&quot; by the Church). This education includes all of the technical bulletins (17 large volumes), all of the many Scientology books, and hundreds of hours of recorded lectures, all of which must have proficiency in them demonstrated step by step.

The technical bulletin goes on: “This Rundown is very simple but cannot be flubbed, as that will compound the errors and cause further introspection in the pc&quot;. It &quot;is very precise and even touchy business. There must be no mistakes and you cannot be heavy-handed on them.&quot;

Hubbard declared about the Introspection Rundown: &quot;This means the last reason to have psychiatry around is gone&quot;, because &quot;I have made a technical breakthrough which possibly ranks with the major discoveries of the Twentieth Century.&quot;

==Lisa McPherson controversy==

Scientology adherent Lisa McPherson had a car accident in Clearwater, Florida on 18 November 1995, while studying at Scientology headquarters. She disrobed by the side of the road, in front of the paramedics who were there for a routine traffic accident report. She was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, but some Scientologists arrived and stated that McPherson did not believe in psychiatry, and she checked out after a short evaluation and left with the Scientologists.

McPherson was put on the Introspection Rundown after her accident on 18 November. It was her second time on the rundown, her first time having been in June. Her appearance after death was that of someone who had been denied water and food for quite some time, being both underweight and severely dehydrated. Additionally, her skin was covered with over a hundred insect bites, presumably from cockroaches. She was locked in a room for 17 days. The Church has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and now makes members sign a waiver before Introspection Rundown specifically stating that they (or anyone on their behalf) will not bring any legal action against the organization over injury or death.

<text>Christopher Edward Bangle (born October 14, 1956) is an American automobile designer. Bangle is known best for his work as Chief of Design for BMW Group, where he was responsible for the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce motor cars.

== Early life ==
Bangle was born in Ravenna, Ohio, and raised in Wausau, Wisconsin. After considering becoming a Methodist minister, Bangle attended the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, earning a Bachelor of Science degree.

==Career==

=== Opel ===
Bangle started his career at Opel in Germany, where he worked from 1981 until 1985. The first work that he designed is the interior of the Opel Junior concept car.

=== Fiat ===
He moved to Fiat in Italy in 1985, to work on the second generation Fiat Panda (released 2003). From 1990 he worked as a chief designer of the Fiat Coupé (released 1993). Still in Centro Stile Fiat he designed Alfa Romeo 145.
=== BMW ===

He became the first American chief of design of BMW on October 1, 1992, where he designed the Z9 Gran Turismo concept car.

Bangle&#x27;s designs were incorporated in the entire BMW lineup, including the BMW Z4, 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7 series as well as the X3, X5, and X6 the newest design SUVs, and the concept car Gina. These span the automotive platforms E81 / E82 / E87 / E88, E90 / E91 / E92 / E93, E60 / E61, E63 / E64, E65 / E66 and E53. During the Bangle era, BMW overtook Mercedes as the global leader in premium car sales, despite Bangle&#x27;s controversial design language.

He introduced a new BMW concept car, called GINA on June 10, 2008.

On February 3, 2009, Bangle announced that he was to quit both his position at BMW and the auto industry altogether, to focus on his own design-related endeavours. He was replaced by Adrian van Hooydonk.

===Post-BMW===
Bangle now works for his own firm called &quot;Chris Bangle Associates&quot; based in Clavesana, Italy.

In 2012, Bangle was hired by Samsung.

==Design philosophy==
His styling themes have generated intense controversy among automotive designers, and have had a polarizing effect with respect to their visual cues. Bangle acknowledges that his designs do not look good in photographs, suggesting to critics that they should see the cars in real life before judging them on their looks.

Bangle himself did not (as is commonly believed) coin the phrase &quot;flame surfacing&quot; to describe his work; this can be attributed to a motoring journalist, and is probably the first time Deconstructivism has been adapted to automotive design. The reason for this design was to use BMW&#x27;s new technology of 3D panel pressing allowing a single press for compound curves, which had previously needed multiple pressings unless the panel was shaped by hand. This is further evidenced by the fact that Bangle has often pointed out architect Frank Gehry&#x27;s work as a major influence.

Arguably the most controversial of Bangle and van Hooydonk&#x27;s work was the E65 7 Series, a sharp contrast to the preceding E38 generation which was conservatively styled. In fact, van Hooydonk&#x27;s original 1998 sketch for the E65 was a much more radical sleek fastback, but the final design was toned down considerably to resemble a more conventional three-box sedan. Time magazine named the E65 as one of the &quot;50 Worst Cars of All Time&quot; for its rear end styling and iDrive functionality, while there were several online petitions pressing BMW to sack Bangle. While the sales for the 2002 and 2003 models years were off 60% from the 2001, the E65 7 series became the best-selling 7 Series of all time.

Bangle aggressively defended his designs against criticism. He was supported by the BMW board of directors, who wanted to move BMW&#x27;s image into the future. He said it was necessary for product lines to follow a cycle of a revolutionary generation followed by an evolutionary generation followed by another revolutionary generation and so on. Indeed, he oversaw the conservative evolution of BMW designs with the redesign of the BMW 3 Series and the introduction of the BMW X5. For Bangle this marked the end of this evolutionary era of BMW design and the revolution was witnessed with the 2002 introduction of the BMW E65.

===Peer comments===
*J Mays, Ford&#x27;s chief creative officer, dislikes Bangle&#x27;s designs, but admits Bangle has been significant in reshaping modern cars.
*Marc Newson, an industrial designer and car enthusiast, described Bangle&#x27;s BMW Z4 (E85) as having been designed with a machete.
*Patrick le Quément, chief designer at Renault, said: &quot;[Bangle is] certainly the most talked about designer. His designs have a great deal of presence, and they&#x27;re well proportioned. He&#x27;s been highly influential. My only concern is his use of concave surfaces: they&#x27;re hollow shapes and lack that tightly muscled look I feel helps design.&quot;
*Martin Smith, head of design for Ford of Europe, describes Bangle as an instigator of the trend toward &quot;surface entertainment&quot; in cars; the Ford Iosis bears some resemblance to Bangle-styled BMWs but it was not criticized as much as Bangle&#x27;s designs.
*, BMW AG&#x27;s Board Member for Development, said: &quot;Christopher Bangle has had a lasting impact on the identity of BMW Group&#x27;s brands. His contribution to the company&#x27;s success has been decisive, and together with his teams he has mapped out a clear and aesthetic route into the future,&quot;
*Robert Cumberford, former GM designer and Design Editor for &quot;Automobile&quot;, wrote in 2004 that Bangle is &quot;a man with the courage of his convictions and of solid character, and he is worthy of our admiration for that alone.&quot;

<doc id="1054721" wikidata="Q7241986" url="?curid=1054721" title="Preston School of Industry">
<text>The Preston School of Industry, also known as Preston Castle, was a reform school located in Ione, California, in Amador County. It was proposed by, and ultimately named after, state senator Edward Myers Preston. The cornerstone was laid in December 1890, and the institution was opened in June 1894 when seven wards (minors under the guardianship of the state, but not necessarily juvenile offenders) were transferred there from San Quentin State Prison. It is considered one of the oldest and best-known reform schools in the United States.
The original building, known colloquially as &quot;Preston Castle&quot; (or simply &quot;The Castle&quot;), is the most significant example of Romanesque Revival architecture in the Mother Lode. This building was vacated in 1960, shortly after new buildings had been constructed to replace it, and has since been named a California Historical Landmark (#867), and listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NPS-75000422). A National Register listing encompassing most of the historic facility was approved in 2024.

In 1999, the institution&#x27;s official name, applied to the newer 1960 buildings, was changed to the &quot;Preston Youth Correctional Facility&quot;.

In 2010, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced that the facility was to close, and a closing ceremony was held on June 2, 2011.

As of 2024, Preston Castle remains in considerable disrepair, and efforts to restore Preston Castle are underway. The Preston Castle Foundation, which purchased the castle for $1 from the state in 2014, is overseeing the restoration work. It could be many years before Preston Castle is fully restored, and it is estimated that the full cost of repairs could be as much as $45 million.

==In popular culture==
The school was used as a shooting location (as the &quot;Bleeding Heart Orphanage&quot;) for the 1984 comedy film &quot;Bad Manners&quot;.

The 2014 film &quot;A Haunting at Preston Castle&quot; is set at the castle and surrounding area, as is the 2019 movie &quot;Apparition&quot;.

The first episode of season 2 of the TV series &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot; is about Preston Castle.

&quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; investigated the castle&#x27;s paranormal reports in season 6, episode 6.

The facility is the subject of &quot;The Lowe Files&quot; Season 1, Episode 1: &quot;Haunted Boy&#x27;s Reformatory&quot;.

Preston School of Industry was an American indie rock band formed by Scott Kannberg (a.k.a. Spiral Stairs) in 1999, following the dissolution of his previous band, Pavement.

<text>Christina Lee Hemme ( ; born October 28, 1980) is an American wrestling executive and retired professional wrestler, ring announcer, backstage interviewer, singer and model. She was previously signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as a front office executive, after previous stints in the company as a wrestler and ring announcer. She is also a former wrestler in WWE, where she won the 2004 Diva Search.

==Early life==
Hemme was born in Poway, California, but she grew up in Temecula, California. She enjoyed racing street bikes and dirt bikes. She was a &quot;self-described&quot; tomboy. She grew up watching wrestling and favored The Undertaker.

She was a cheerleader for two years at Temecula Valley High School. She graduated in 1998 at age seventeen. Hemme attended Mt. San Jacinto College, where she majored in dance.

==Modeling career==
After graduating, she relocated to Los Angeles, California to pursue a career in modeling. Hemme initially joined a burlesque dance team known as &quot;The Purrfect Angelz&quot;. She performed at Easyrider tours and Harley motorcycle rallies. She went on to appear in magazines such as &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Stuff&quot;. In addition, she appeared in the music video of the Trace Adkins songs &quot;Chrome&quot;, and &quot;Honky Tonk Badonkadonk&quot; and in videos for bands Blink-182 and Sonic. She also had parts in commercials for AT&amp;T Corporation and TrimSpa, and she was a spokesmodel for Hawaiian Tropic. Other early jobs included a waitressing job at Hooters.

In past years, her image has also been found on Bench Warmer trading cards as Christy &quot;Sunni&quot; Hemme. As Sunni, she was Bullz-eye.com&#x27;s featured model in September 2002. Her modeling career led to her joining the cast of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Man Show&quot; as a member of the &quot;Juggy Dance Squad&quot; in 2003. Hemme remained with the series for a year, during which she appeared on &quot;The Commies&quot;, a Comedy Central produced award show, on December 7, 2003.

Hemme took part in the 2004 Lingerie Bowl. She appeared on the cover of the April 2005 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Wrestling Entertainment===
====Diva Search (2004)====
In mid-2004, Hemme participated in the Diva Search, a competition held by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) to recruit new WWE Divas. In the course of the competition, Hemme and the five other finalists faced seven existing Divas in a game of dodgeball at SummerSlam on August 15, eliminating all eight Divas with the loss of just one finalist, Joy Giovanni. Hemme was announced as the winner of the competition on September 20, with a prize of a one-year contract with WWE, with remuneration of $250,000.

====Brand switches (2004–2005)====
Hemme began her WWE career as a member of the Raw roster. She quickly began a feud with Carmella DeCesare, the runner-up of the Diva Search. The feud culminated in a &quot;lingerie pillow fight&quot; at Taboo Tuesday on October 19, which Hemme won.
Following her feud with DeCesare, Hemme began a rivalry with WWE Women&#x27;s Champion Trish Stratus. Stratus, along with Molly Holly and Gail Kim, threw Hemme an initiation party, but, it soon turned into a 3-on-1 Bra and Panties Handicap match, which Hemme lost. As Stratus was ostensibly scornful of Hemme&#x27;s appearance in the April 2005 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;, Stratus interrupted Hemme&#x27;s unveiling and spray painted all over the cover. Hemme responded by slapping her, which resulted in Stratus knocking her out with a Chick Kick and spraying the word &quot;slut&quot; on her back. Hemme eventually challenged Stratus to a match at WrestleMania 21, with Stratus&#x27;s nemesis Lita training her in the weeks preceding the event. At the event on April 3, Hemme unsuccessfully challenged Stratus for the Women&#x27;s Championship.

In the months after WrestleMania, Hemme began a feud with Victoria, who claimed to be jealous of the opportunities afforded to Hemme. Hemme would feud with Victoria during &quot;Raw&quot; house shows, and defeated her on several occasions. On the June 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hemme teamed up with Rosey and The Hurricane in a losing effort to Victoria and The Heart Throbs (Antonio and Romeo) in a six-person mixed tag team match. The feud culminated in a bout at Vengeance on June 26, which Victoria won. With her feud with Victoria over, Hemme briefly aligned herself with Eugene, before she and Stacy Keibler were traded to the SmackDown! brand in exchange for Candice Michelle and Torrie Wilson, on August 25.

On the September 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Hemme began a feud with Melina, the valet of MNM, after losing to her in a singles match, and in the process joined forces with the Legion of Doom. At No Mercy on October 9, Hemme and the Legion of Doom defeated MNM in a six-person intergender tag team match. Her feud with Melina continued on November 25 with Melina defeating Hemme.

====Ohio Valley Wrestling (2005)====
On November 30, Hemme debuted in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), a WWE developmental territory, aligning herself with Matt Cappotelli in opposition to Aaron Stevens, Beth Phoenix, and Shelly Martinez. On the December 7 episode of OVW TV, Hemme teamed up with Cappotelli in a winning effort defeating Stevens, Phoenix, and Martinez in three-on-two handicap match.

On December 5, 2005, Hemme was released from her WWE contract. The release happened shortly after WWE asked her to relocate to Louisville, Kentucky to train at OVW. The company cited budget cuts and the creative team having nothing for her as the reason for her dismissal.

In November 2008, in her column for TNAwrestling.com, Hemme stated her departure from WWE was on her own terms.

===Return to WWE (2017)===
Hemme appeared at the 2017 WWE Hall of Fame to support Beth Phoenix, the first time she has been seen in the WWE since 2005.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===
====The Rock &#x27;n Rave Infection (2006–2008)====

Hemme signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in April 2006, and she debuted on April 23 at Lockdown. In addition to her hosting role on &quot;Impact!&quot;, she was also the co-host of the Internet show &quot;TNA Global Impact!&quot; with Jeremy Borash. At &quot;Hardcore War&quot;, Hemme refereed a match between Traci and Gail Kim. In July 2006, she was featured on the &quot;Women of Action&quot; special. She also began traveling to Windsor, Ontario to train under TNA agent Scott D&#x27;Amore in between TNA television tapings. Hemme was also voted the 2006 Knockout of the Year.
On January 14, 2007, at Final Resolution, Hemme interrupted the Voodoo Kin Mafia (VKM) and cut a promo about the involvement of women in wrestling. She said that she wanted to wrestle too, and the mostly male crowd in the TNA arena jeered her. Kip James called her a &quot;slut&quot;, which garnered him a slap from Hemme, while B.G. James attempted to play , turning Hemme heel in the process. In the following weeks, Kip and Hemme argued over his lack of respect for her and women in general. Hemme made her TNA in-ring debut at Against All Odds, where she wrestled and defeated &quot;The Big Fat Oily Guy&quot; in a Tuxedo match, but after his match, Kip James stripped her of her clothes. On the March 8 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Hemme asked Jim Cornette for a match pitting the Voodoo Kin Mafia against her new, previously undisclosed, team, at Destination X. Cornette consented and booked the match. At the pay-per-view, Hemme introduced The Heartbreakers. Despite Hemme&#x27;s attempts to give Kip James a low blow, the VKM defeated her team, who she later browbeat at ringside. Hemme later announced that she had found another team to face the VKM. On the pre-show prior to the Lockdown pay-per-view, the mystery team was revealed to be Serotonin (Havok and Kaz), but VKM defeated them as well. She then brought in Basham and Damaja as her new permanent tag team in her battle with VKM. The team beat Kip in a handicap match at Sacrifice, as B.G. had been attacked by them earlier in the night. At Slammiversary, VKM beat Basham and Damaja, but VKM&#x27;s associate Lance Hoyt turned on them and kissed Hemme. at Bound for Glory, Hemme competed in the Gauntlet for the Gold match to crown the first TNA Women&#x27;s Knockout Champion but was unable to continue and was removed from the match by EMTs.

Basham and Damaja were then released from the company, and Hoyt formed a partnership with Jimmy Rave, dubbed The Rock &#x27;n Rave Infection, with Hemme as their manager. In the winter of 2007, Hemme, Rave, and Hoyt began a feud with The Latin American Xchange (LAX) faction after being attacked several times by a mysterious assailant. The assailant was revealed to be Salinas at Final Resolution following LAX&#x27;s victory over the Infection. Shortly after Final Resolution, The Rock &#x27;n Rave Infection began a new gimmick, portraying a rock band, with Hemme as the lead singer. On the March 13 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Hemme, Rave and Hoyt won a six-person tag team match against LAX after Hemme hit Salinas with a guitar. At No Surrender, Hemme, Hoyt, and Rave lost in an intergender six-person tag team match against the Prince Justice Brotherhood (Shark Boy, Curry Man, and Super Eric).

====Singles competition (2008–2009)====
On the October 16, 2008 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hoyt and Rave were attacked by Kurt Angle, and were hospitalized. As Hemme attempted to leave the building and go to the hospital, The Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky) and Cute Kip confronted and insulted her, which led to the trio attacking her and placing a brown paper bag over her head. Hemme transitioned into a face by defeating Sky on the October 23, 2008 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. She feuded with the Beautiful People, which resulted in two consecutive tag team matches with ODB and Sojourner Bolt as per partners, respectively. After showcasing improved wrestling skills, Hemme was then placed into a more active in-ring role, being pushed to challenge Awesome Kong for the TNA Women&#x27;s Knockout Championship at Final Resolution, after defeating Raisha Saeed on the November 27 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;. Hemme then teamed with A.J. Styles in a mixed tag team match against Kong and Scott Steiner, where Hemme pinned Kong. At Final Resolution, Hemme was attacked by Saeed and Rhaka Khan and won the match by disqualification, and thus Kong retained the title. Hemme was subsequently granted a rematch at Genesis. A week later, Hemme teamed with ODB against Khan and Saeed in a winning effort. In January 2009, Hemme sustained a neck injury while training in the ring with Styles for her match, and was deemed unable to compete at Genesis.
After a seven-month absence, Hemme returned on the August 13, 2009 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, defeating Sojournor Bolt. The following week on &quot;Impact&quot;, she formed an alliance with her former rival Tara, when they helped save Madison Rayne from an attack from Angelina Love and Velvet Sky.

Shaw later became an obsessed fan of Hemme, and started asking her on dates, including one in his house, where it was shown that Shaw had a room full of posters and a mannequin of Hemme. Hemme was confronted by Shaw on the February 27 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; after an incident the previous week, in which she was injured when Shaw attacked Mr. Anderson.

<text>Ğäbdennasír İbrahim ulı Qursawí (, ), sometimes spelled &quot;Kursavi&quot; or &quot;Koursavi&quot; (1776–1812) was a Tatar educator, Hanafi Maturidi theologian, and prominent Jadidist. He was a brother of Ğäbdelxaliq Qursawí. He studied at Machkara (Malmyzhsky District) village madrassah and later at the Mir-i-Arab Madrasah in Bukhara. From 1794 to 1808 he was imam of the mosque in Yughary Qursa village of Kazan Governorate, Russian Empire and the headmaster of his own madrassah. His surname is, actually, a derivative of &quot;Qursa&quot; in Arabic manner, which means &quot;from Qursa&quot;. He is credited with the revival of modernism- and reform-oriented Islam (or Jadidism) among the Tatars, and was the author of numerous articles about religion. He died during the &quot;hajj&quot; and is buried in Istanbul.

<text>The PXL2000, or Pixelvision, was a toy black and white video camera, introduced by Fisher-Price in 1987 at the International Toy Fair in Manhattan, which could record sound and images onto Compact Cassette tapes. It was on the market for one year with about 400,000 units produced. After that one year, it was pulled by the market, but rediscovered in the 1990s by low-budget filmmakers who appreciated the grainy, shimmering, monochrome produced by the unit, and the way in which its lens allowed the user to photograph a subject an eighth of an inch away from the camera, and pull back to a long shot without manipulating a dial, while keeping as the background and the foreground in focus. It is also appreciated by collectors, artists, and media historians, and has been used in major films and spawned dedicated film festivals.

==Development==
The PXL2000 was created by a team of inventors led by James Wickstead. He sold the invention rights to Fisher-Price in 1987 at the American International Toy Fair in Manhattan.

==Design==
The PXL2000 consists of a simple aspherical lens, an infrared filter, a CCD image sensor, a custom ASIC (the Sanyo LA 7306M), and an audio cassette mechanism. This is mounted in a plastic housing with a battery compartment and an RF video modulator selectable to either North American television channel 3 or 4. It has a plastic viewfinder and some control buttons.

The system stores 11 minutes of video and sound on a standard audio cassette tape by moving the tape at nearly nine times normal cassette playback speed. It records at roughly per second, compared to a standard cassette&#x27;s speed of on a C90 CrO2 (chromium dioxide) cassette. In magnetic tape recording, the faster the tape speed, the more data can be stored per second. The higher speed is necessary because video requires a wider bandwidth than standard audio recording. The PXL2000 records the video information on the left audio channel of the cassette, and the audio on the right.

In order to reduce the amount of information recorded to fit within the narrow bandwidth of the sped-up audio cassette, the ASIC generates slower video timings than conventional TVs use. It scans the pixel CCD 15 times per second, feeding the results through a filtering circuit, and then to a frequency modulation circuit driving the left channel of the cassette head, as well as to an ADC, which creates the final image for viewing.

For playback and view-through purposes, circuits read image data from either a recorded cassette or the CCD and fill half a digital frame store at the PXL reduced rate, while scanning the other half of the frame store at normal NTSC rates. Since each half of the frame store includes only in its array, the same as the CCD, the display resolution was deemed to be marginal, and black borders were added around the picture, squashing the frame store image content into the middle of the frame, preserving pixels that would otherwise be lost in overscan. An anti-aliasing low-pass filter is included in the final video output circuit.

==Marketing==
The market success of the PXL2000 was ultimately quite low with its targeted child demographic, in part due to its high pricing. Introduced at and later reduced to , it was expensive for a child&#x27;s toy but affordable by amateur video artists. The PXL2000 was produced in two versions: model #3300 at $100 with just the camera and necessary accessories; and #3305 at $150 adding a portable black and white television monitor with a diagonal screen. Extra accessories were sold separately, such as a carrying case.

It was also produced as Fisher-Price PixelVision, Sanwa Sanpix1000, KiddieCorder, and Georgia.

==Revival==
The PXL2000 has received a minor revival in popularity since the 1990s among filmmakers, due to its point-and-shoot simplicity and low-grade aesthetic. Because the unit is degradable and obsolete, its use is aligned with a certain romanticized mortality, unfit for serious mainstream appropriation. Erik Saks wrote this: &quot;Each time an artist uses a PXL2000, the whole form edges closer to extinction.&quot;

In 1990, Pixelvision enthusiast Gerry Fialka founded PXL THIS, a film festival dedicated to projects shot exclusively on the PXL2000. The festival continues to occur annually in Los Angeles, California, usually at the Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center and the Echo Park Film Center, with Fialka continuing as organizer and curator. Although the festival operates without a budget, it still manages to tour many locations including the San Francisco Cinematheque and Boston&#x27;s MIT campus. Festival entries, oral history interviews, and other relevant materials donated by Fialka are being processed into the Performing Arts and Moving Image Archives at the University of California, Santa Barbara Library. Recalling the PXL2000&#x27;s initial promise of accessibility, Fialka&#x27;s vision includes accepting submissions indiscriminately, juxtaposing the works of established artists with those of amateurs and children.

PXL2000 cameras have been used occasionally in professional filmmaking, with camera modifications to output composite video, enabling it to interface to an external camcorder or VCR.

==Productions==
The PXL2000 was used by Richard Linklater in his 1990 debut film, &quot;Slacker&quot;. A roughly two-minute performance art sequence within the film is shot entirely in PixelVision.

Peggy Ahwesh&#x27;s &quot;Strange Weather&quot; (1993), which follows several crack cocaine addicts in Florida, was shot entirely on a PXL2000. This video relies heavily on the camera&#x27;s portability to maintain an intimate presence.

Video artist Sadie Benning is among the most critically acclaimed pioneers of the PXL2000, one of which was given to them by their father James Benning around the age of 15. Benning&#x27;s early video diary works gained popularity in the artist market, earning them a lasting reputation as an innovator, with an important presence in video art.

Michael Almereyda used the camera for several of his films. &quot;Another Girl Another Planet&quot; (1992) and his short &quot;Aliens&quot; (1993) were shot with it entirely, it was used for point of view shots of the title character in &quot;Nadja&quot; (1994), and it was used by the title character to make video diaries in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (2000).

The camera has been used for several music videos, including &quot;Mote&quot; by Sonic Youth and &quot;Black Grease&quot; by the Black Angels.

Artist John Humphrey&#x27;s 2003 video, &quot;Pee Wee Goes to Prison&quot; was shot on a PXL2000, employing a cast of dolls and other toys to stage the imaginary trial, incarceration, and eventual pardoning (by newly-elected president Jesse Ventura) of Pee-wee Herman for the sale of Yohimbe.

The PXL2000 was used by the characters Maggie (Anne Hathaway) and Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) in the 2010 film, &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot;, although the black and white footage from the camera is shown at full film resolution.

In 2018, Toronto filmmaker Karma Todd Wiseman used a PXL2000 to shoot key scenes, processing the footage with enhanced monochrome. The custom PXL2000 camera was fitted with windshield mount suction cups and painted with the red and white paint scheme of the Canadian flag.

The PXL2000 was used by the characters Melody and Jess during the show Archive 81.

<text>Richard Boleslawski (born Bolesław Ryszard Srzednicki; February 4, 1889 – January 17, 1937) was a Polish theatre and film director, actor and teacher of acting.

==Biography==
Richard Boleslawski was born Bolesław Ryszard Srzednicki on February 4, 1889, in Mohyliv-Podilskyi, in the Russian Empire to an ethnic Polish family of Catholic faith. He graduated from the Tver Cavalry Officers School. He trained as an actor at the First Studio of the Moscow Art Theatre under Konstantin Stanislavski and his assistant Leopold Sulerzhitsky, where he was introduced to the &#x27;system&#x27;.

During World War I, Boleslawski fought as a cavalry lieutenant on the Tsarist Russian side until the fall of the Russian Empire. He left Russia after the October Revolution of 1917 for his native Poland, where he directed his first movies. As his birth name was difficult to pronounce, he took the name Ryszard Bolesławski. His &quot;Miracle at the Vistula&quot; (&quot;Cud nad Wisłą&quot;) was a semi-documentary about the miraculous victory of the Poles at the Vistula River over the superior Soviet Russian forces during the Polish-Soviet War of 1919–1921.

Boleslawski acted in &quot;Love One Another&quot; (&quot;Die Gezeichneten&quot;, 1922), a German silent film directed by Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer. In September 1922, he made his way to New York City, where, now known as &quot;Richard Boleslawski&quot; (the English spelling of his name), he began to teach Stanislavski&#x27;s &#x27;system&#x27; (which, in the US, developed into Method acting) with fellow émigré Maria Ouspenskaya. In 1923, he founded the American Laboratory Theatre in New York. Among his students were Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler and Harold Clurman, who were all founding members of the Group Theatre (1931–1940), the first American acting ensemble to utilize Stanislavski&#x27;s techniques.

Offered a contract to direct Hollywood films, Boleslawski made several significant films with some of the major stars of the day.

He died suddenly from cardiac arrest a few weeks short of his 48th birthday, on January 17, 1937. He is interred in the Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles.

==Personal life==
Boleslawski was married at least three times and had a son with his last wife, Norma.

==In popular culture==
Hugh Walpole, who worked with Boleslawski on the script for &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1935), dedicated his 1937 novel &quot;John Cornelius&quot; to him with an &quot;In Memoriam&quot; poem.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Boleslawski has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Blvd.

<doc id="1054768" wikidata="Q2386334" url="?curid=1054768" title="K League 1">
<text>The K League 1 () is the top flight of men&#x27;s professional football in the South Korean football league system, and is contested by twelve clubs. It is one of the most successful leagues in the Asian Football Confederation, with its past and present clubs having won a record twelve AFC Champions League titles.

== History ==
The South Korean professional football league was founded in 1983 as the Korean Super League, with five member clubs. The initial five clubs were Hallelujah FC, Yukong Elephants, Pohang Steelworks, Daewoo Royals, Kookmin Bank. Hallelujah FC won the inaugural title, finishing one point ahead of Daewoo Royals to lift the trophy.

The Super League was renamed the Korean Professional Football League, and introduced the home and away system in 1987. It was once again renamed the K League in 1998. After the 2011 season, the K League Championship and the Korean League Cup were abolished, and the league was split into two divisions in 2013. The first division was named the K League Classic, while the newly created second division was named the K League Challenge, and both are now part of the K League structure. Since its creation, the league has expanded from an initial 5 to 22 clubs. Of the five inaugural clubs, only Yukong, Pohang and Daewoo still compete in the K League; Kookmin Bank dropped out of the league at the end of 1984, and Hallelujah followed the season after.

On 22 January 2018, the top-flight competition was renamed as K League 1.

== Structure ==

On 5 October 2011, the league announced a plan to introduce a relegation system from the 2012 season, when two teams were relegated. In 2013, the bottom two teams were directly relegated, while the 12th team played a relegation playoff match against the winner of the newly formed K League Challenge. From the 2013 season, as the number of teams of K League was reduced, only the 12th team is automatically relegated, with the 11th team playing a match against the winner of the K League 2 promotion playoffs.

The league also introduced a split system like the Scottish Premier League in the 2012 season, where each club plays each other three times in the regular round, then the top and bottom six teams are split into Split A and Split B, in which a team plays every other team in the split once, to decide the final standings.

== Other information ==

The K League season typically begins around March and runs to late November each year. The number of games, clubs and the systems used have varied through the years.

A number of the member clubs are owned by South Korean major conglomerates &quot;chaebols&quot;. Those clubs have adopted local city names in an effort to integrate themselves more with the local communities. All other teams are owned by local governments.

The K League champions, runners-up, and third-placed team gain entry to the AFC Champions League the following season, with the exception of Sangmu FC due to their unique status as a military team. If the winners of Korean FA Cup cannot qualify for the AFC Champions League or already qualified for it, fourth place also can participate.

In the 2009 season, Gangwon FC joined the K League as its 15th member club. As such, the K League had one or more clubs in each province of South Korea. This was the first time in domestic South Korean professional sports history that there has been at least one club in each province.

<doc id="1054770" wikidata="Q6716" url="?curid=1054770" title="Grosseto">
<text>Grosseto () is a city and a &quot;comune&quot; in the central Italian region of Tuscany, the capital of the province of Grosseto and of the Maremma. The city lies from the Tyrrhenian Sea, at the centre of an alluvial plain on the Ombrone river.

It is the most populous city in Maremma, with 82,284 inhabitants. The comune of Grosseto includes the &quot;frazioni&quot; of Marina di Grosseto, the largest one, Roselle, Principina a Mare, Principina Terra, Montepescali, Braccagni, Istia d&#x27;Ombrone, Batignano, Alberese and Rispescia.

==History==
The origins of Grosseto can be traced back to the High Middle Ages. It was first mentioned in 803 as a fief of the Counts Aldobrandeschi, in a document recording the assignment of the church of St. George to Ildebrando degli Aldobrandeschi, whose successors were counts of the Grossetana Mark until the end of the 12th century.

Grosseto steadily grew in importance, owing to the decline of Rusellae and Vetulonia until it was one of the principal Tuscan cities. In 1137 the city was besieged by German troops, led by Duke Heinrich X of Bavaria, sent by the emperor Lothair III to reinstate his authority over the Aldobrandeschi. In the following year the bishopric of Roselle was transferred to Grosseto.

In 1151 the citizens swore loyalty to the Republic of Siena, and in 1222 the Aldobrandeschi gave the Grossetani the right to have their own podestà, together with three councilors and consuls. In 1244 the city was reconquered by the Sienese, and its powers, together with all the Aldobrandeschi&#x27;s imperial privileges, were transferred to Siena by order of the imperial vicar. Thereafter Grosseto shared the fortunes of Siena. It became an important stronghold, and the fortress (&quot;rocca&quot;), the walls and bastions can still to be seen.

In 1266 and in 1355, Grosseto tried in vain to win freedom from the overlordship of Siena. While Guelph and Ghibelline parties struggled for control of that city, Umberto and Aldobrandino Aldobrandeschi tried to regain Grosseto for their family. The Sienese armies were, however, victorious, and in 1259 they named a podestà from their city. But Grosseto gained its freedom and in the following year and fought alongside the Florentine forces in the Battle of Montaperti.

Over the next 80 years Grosseto was again occupied, ravaged, excommunicated by Pope Clement IV, besieged by emperor Louis IV and by the antipope Nicholas V in 1328, until it finally submitted to its more powerful neighbour, Siena.

The pestilence of 1348 struck Grosseto hard and by 1369 its population had been reduced to some hundred families. Its territory, moreover, was frequently ravaged, notably in 1447 by Alfons V of Sicily and in 1455 by Jacopo Piccinino.

Sienese rule ended in 1559, when Charles V handed over the whole duchy to Cosimo I de Medici, first grand duke of Tuscany. In 1574 the construction of a line of defensive walls was begun, which are still well preserved today, while the surrounding swampy plain was drained. Grosseto, however, remained a minor town, with only 700 inhabitants at the beginning of the 18th century.

Under the rule of the House of Lorraine, Grosseto flourished. It was given the title of capital of the new Maremma province.

In 1943, the city was heavily bombed by the Allies. On 22 March 1944, the Maiano Lavacchio massacre took place into the countryside between Grosseto and Magliano in Toscana.

In 2024, Grosseto was selected as the European Green Pioneer of Smart Tourism. This accolade, awarded by the European Commission, recognizes small, non-traditional, and emerging sustainable tourism destinations in Europe, with Grosseto being chosen ahead of 40 other cities.

==Geography==
=== Climate ===
Grosseto has a Mediterranean climate with very mild wet winters and very hot dry summers. On average there are 25 nights a year where the low reaches or dips below freezing but there are also 41 days where the high is at or surpasses . There are 12 days of fog on an average year.

==Government==
=== Subdivisions ===
The Municipality of Grosseto was subdivided into eight districts (&quot;circoscrizioni&quot;) from 1977 to 2011.

===Frazioni===
====Alberese====
Alberese, located south-east of the capital, is the heart of the Natural Park of Maremma. The name is also extended to the surrounding rural areas which go from the first foothills of the hinterland hills to the sea through the northern slopes of the Uccellina Mountains.

====Batignano====

Of uncertain origins, Batignano developed in the Medieval period, around the castle which controlled the outlet of the road towards Siena on the plain of Grosseto and some lead and silver mines. It was a feud of the Aldobrandeschi and in 1213 belonged to Manto da Grosseto. In the 14th century, it then passed under the dominion of Siena, hosting many immigrants from Corsica, and so in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In 1738 it was reunited with the comune of Grosseto.

====Braccagni====

Once being simply an appendix of Montepescali, Braccagni is seen today more independently as it is believed to be the nodal point of the economy of the area. The railway station, the Aurelia, many activities which have developed in the last few years, new habitations, these have all created its new identity as a modern town, in continuous evolution.

====Istia d&#x27;Ombrone====
Istia d&#x27;Ombrone is a town situated about east of the capital. The center of Istia emerged as a fortified settlement along the valley of the river Ombrone and it was owned by the bishops of Roselle since 862.

====Marina di Grosseto====
Marina di Grosseto is a famous tourist destination located from Grosseto; it is an important seaside resort in Maremma. Once a fishing village, it is known for its hilly hinterland, rich in macchia and wide beaches overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea, with a vast pine forest that extends from Punta Ala to Alberese.

====Montepescali====

Montepescali is a small town of medieval origins. The site, from which the scenic panorama of the coastal strip and the Tuscan Archipelago up to Corsica can be seen, is also known as &quot;Terrace or balcony of the Maremma&quot;.

====Principina a Mare====
Principina a Mare is a seaside resort. The center, sparsely populated land in winter, consists primarily of houses of holidaymakers, hotels, high class and a camp category average. However, the location is quite popular due to its proximity to the mouth of the river Ombrone and the Natural Park of Maremma.

====Principina Terra====
The village of Principina Terra is located south-west of the capital city, almost halfway between the city center and the seaside resorts of Marina di Grosseto and Principina a Mare. The area surrounding the village was washed from the shores of ancient Lake Prile.

====Rispescia====
Rispescia is a modern residential area, located about south-east of the capital, near the Natural Park of Maremma and the &quot;frazione&quot; of Alberese.

====Roselle====

Roselle, in Latin &quot;Rusellae&quot;, now a municipal &quot;frazione&quot; of Grosseto, was once the main city in the area. Of Etruscan origin, it was built on a hill that offered protection and commanded all the nearby valley. The extent of its dominion is not clear, but probably at its peak included most of the Vetulonia territory. The city&#x27;s splendour ended in 294 BCE, when, according to Livy, the Roman Republic conquered it. After the end of the Roman Empire, in the 5th century, Roselle was still the most important centre of what is now southern Tuscany. Its gradual decline began in 1138, when the diocesan seat was moved to Grosseto.

Etruscan ruins had been discovered in Roselle, including cyclopean walls, in circumference, and sulphur baths, which in the last century were restored for medicinal uses. There was formerly an amphitheatre.

==Culture==
===Language===
===Literature===
Andrea da Grosseto was born in Grosseto in the first half of the 1200&#x27;s. He is very important in Italian literature, because he is considered the first writer in the Italian language. Andrea da Grosseto translated from Latin the Moral Treaties of Albertano of Brescia, in 1268. His texts were written in the Italian language, without too many redundancies and constructions, words and typical ways of speech of the vernacular and the dialect. The writer intended to not utilise his own Grossetan dialect, but to use a general &quot;Italian national language&quot;. In fact he twice refers to the vernacular which he uses defining it &quot;italico&quot; (Italic). So Andrea da Grosseto was the first to intend to use vernacular as a national unifying language from the north to the south of the entire Peninsula.

==Main sights==

===The Medicean Walls===

The walls were commissioned by Cosimo I de Medici in 1564, in order to replace those from the 12th-14th centuries, as part of his policy of making Grosseto a stronghold to protect his southern border. The design was by Baldassarre Lanci, and construction began in 1565. Until 1757 the exterior was surrounded by a ditch with an earthen moat. There were two main gates: Porta Nuova on the north and Porta Reale (now Porta Vecchia) on the south.

The walls are now used as a public park and walking area.
===Religious architecture===

====Cathedral====

The Romanesque cathedral, the main monument of the city, is named for its patron St. Lawrence, and was begun at the end of the 13th century, by architect Sozzo Rustichini of Siena. Erected over the earlier church of Santa Maria Assunta, it was only finished in the 15th century (mainly due to the continuing struggles against Siena).

The façade of alternate layers of white and black marble is Romanesque in style, but is almost entirely the result of 16th century and 1816–1855 restorations: it retains decorative parts of the originary buildings, including Evangelists&#x27; symbols. The layout consists of a Latin cross, with transept and apse. The interior has a nave with two aisles, separated by cruciform pilasters. The main artworks are a wondrously carved baptismal font from 1470–1474 and the &quot;Madonna delle Grazie&quot; by Matteo di Giovanni (1470).

The campanile (bell tower) was finished in 1402, and restored in 1911.

====Churches in the city centre====

*Church of San Francesco. Situated on the square with the same name, it was built in the 13th century, initially a Benedictine, later Franciscan convent.

*&quot;Convent of Clarisse&quot;. Located on &quot;strada Vinzaglio&quot;, the convent is annexed to the Church of Bigi. The convent of Clarisse and the church of Bigi are now deconsecrated.

Today the convent hosts the &quot;Museolab Città di Grosseto&quot; and the university.

<text>Wein, Weib und Gesang (&quot;Wine, Woman, and Song&quot;), Op. 333, is a Viennese waltz by Johann Strauss II. It is a choral waltz in its original form, although it is seldom heard in this version today. It was commissioned for the Vienna Men&#x27;s Choral Association&#x27;s so-called Fools&#x27; Evening on 2 February 1869 with a dedication to the Association&#x27;s honorary chorus-master Johann Herbeck. Its fanciful title was drawn from an old adage: &quot;Who loves not wine, women and song remains a fool his whole life long.&quot;

The waltz&#x27;s admirers include the famous opera composer Richard Wagner and Strauss&#x27; good friend Johannes Brahms. There is an arrangement for piano, harmonium and string quartet by Alban Berg.

The waltz&#x27;s primary home key is in E-flat major, with its introduction interpolating with B-flat major as well as B major. The first waltz melody, with its tapping quality is quintessentially Viennese in nature. Further waltz themes alternate between lush passion and good-humored cheekiness, ending with a swirling finish in the principal home key underlined by a brass fanfare and snare drumroll, as is the usual style of concluding a piece in Strauss&#x27; works dating around that period.

The title is also a German expression for having fun.

<text>Loren C. Murchison (December 17, 1898 – June 11, 1979) was an American athlete, double gold medal winner in 4×100 m relay at the Olympic Games.

==Biography==
Born in Farmersville, Texas, Loren Murchison was an AAU Champion in in 1920 and 1923 and in in 1918 and 1923. He also won the British AAA Championships in both and at the 1925 AAA Championships.

At the 1920 Summer Olympics, Murchison finished fourth in 200 m and sixth in 100 m. He also ran the third leg in the gold medal winning United States 4x100 m relay team, which set a new world record of 42.2 s in the Olympic final. At the 1924 Summer Olympics, Murchison was again sixth in 100 m and won his second Olympic gold medal as an opening leg in the world record (41.0 s) setting American 4×100 m relay team.

Murchison was an outstanding indoor runner. He won 14 titles (9 individual and 5 in the relay) at the United States premier indoor athletics meet, the Millrose Games. He was also national indoor champion at the 60 y in 1919–20 and 1922–24, and 300 y in 1919–20 and 1923–24.

Murchison was also a prolific breaker of records indoors. Amongst the world best times he equaled or broke are:
* equaled 60 y best of 6.4 s in 1920, 1922 and 1923;
* established new 60 y best of 6.2 s in 1923;
* 50 m of 6.0 s in 1925;
* 300 y of 31.2 s;
* 220 y best of 22.4 s.

It was such exploits that inspired Charley Paddock (1920 Olympic 100 m champion) to call Murchison &quot;the greatest indoor sprinter of his generation and the finest starter of all-time.

In 1925 Murchison was struck with spinal meningitis and paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life.

A resident of Leisure Village in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, Murchison died at the age of 80 on June 11, 1979, at Point Pleasant Hospital in Point Pleasant, New Jersey.

<text>The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) is an umbrella organization for trade unions in Nigeria.

==History==
The Nigerian Labour Congress was founded in December 1978, as a merger of four different organisations: the Nigeria Trade Union Congress (NTUC), Labour Unity Front (LUF), United Labour Congress (ULC) and Nigeria Workers&#x27; Council (NWC). However, the recently established Federal Military Government, led by Murtala Mohammed, refused to recognise the new organisation, and instead set up the Adebiyi Tribunal to investigate the activities of trade unions and their leaders. The Tribunal reported in 1976 and claimed that all the existing trade union centres propagated Cold War ideologies, depended on funding from international union federations, and mismanaged funds. This was used as a justification to ban all four centres, with M. O. Abiodun appointed as the administrator of trade unions. He accepted the establishment of a new Nigeria Labour Congress, on the condition that the approximately 1,500 affiliated unions were restructured into 42 industrial unions, plus 19 unions representing senior staff.

In 1978, the Nigeria Labour Congress was established, with the 42 industrial unions affiliated. It was to be the only legal trade union federation. Its leadership included many of the leading figures from its four predecessors, with Wahab Goodluck becoming its founding president.

During its history, conflicts with the military regime twice led to the dissolution of the NLC&#x27;s national organs, the first in 1988 under the military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida and the second in 1994, under the regime of General Sani Abacha. In 1996, the 42 affiliates of the NLC were merged into 29, by Act of Parliament. Under Nigeria&#x27;s military governments, labour leaders were frequently arrested and union meetings disrupted. Following democratic reforms in the country, some of the anti-union regulations were abolished in January 1999. The same month Adams Oshiomhole was elected President of the reformed organisation.

In the early 2000s, conflict between the government and the NLC escalated due to the organisation&#x27;s opposition to higher fuel prices. The price increases are the result of decisions by the Olusegun Obasanjo government to dramatically reduce subsidies and to deregulate the purchase and sale of fue The NLC has led several general strikes protesting the government&#x27;s fuel price policy.

In September 2004, the NLC gave the federal government an ultimatum to reverse the decision to reintroduce the controversial fuel tax or face a nationwide protest strike. The strike threat was made despite the fact that a Federal High Court judgement in an earlier dispute had declared the organisation lacking legal power to call a general strike over government policies.

Following the announcement of the strike plans, the NLC claimed President Adams Oshiomhole was arrested October 9, 2004 at a protest at Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport. According to the organisation, Oshiomhole was &quot;abducted by a team of operatives of the State Security Services (SSS) numbering over fifteen, who overpowered him, wrestled him to the ground and bundled him into a standby Peugeot 504 station wagon, which bore no licence plates.&quot; The State Security Services called the claim &quot;sensational and inaccurate reporting&quot;, saying that the NLC president had a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; with field operatives, but that the matter was soon resolved. A presidential spokesperson claimed that Oshiomhole was only invited for a &quot;chat&quot; at the airport, no arrest having taken place.

In 2005, the law was changed to permit other trade union federation to receive government recognition, and also to permit senior staff unions to join the NLC. In 2016, about 25 affiliates left to form the United Labour Congress, but they rejoined the NLC in 2020. By the end of the year, it had 43 affiliates, which as of 2016 represented more than 4,000,000 members.

One of the strongest protest of the NLC can be traced to January 2012 during the President Goodluck Jonathan administration. The president and his economic team had argued that fuel subsidy payments was making the country lose billions of naira and it will save around &quot;£4.2bn annually to invest in underperforming refineries that have forced Nigeria to import its own oil once it has been refined&quot;. The president said his government was no more interested in the payment of fuel subsidy to petroleum markerters. This will move fuel prices which was sold for N65 a litre with subsidy inclusive to around N141 which implies more than a hundred per cent increase.

The campaign for fuel subsidy removal was supported by the ministers in his cabinet and mostly chaired by the then finance minister/coordinating minister for economy Dr. Ngozi Okonjo Iweala. The government announced that fuel subsidy was going to be removed by January 2012 and this announcement was not welcomed by the Nigeria Labour Congress. Abdulwahed Omar, the then NLC president challenged the government that there will be wide spread mass protest in Nigeria if it continued with its plans to remove fuel subsdy. The NLC was able to rally other trade unions and civicl societies to support its planned protest. This challenge was marked by actions when the government moved on with the removal of payments for fuel subsidy. By 9 January 2012, massive protest erupted around Nigeria and in major cities including Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and Kano. These protest crippled the economy as there was a total shutdown of the Nations different workforce and it lasted more than five working days. This led the then president Jonathan to announce on live TV that government will now subsidize fuel prices and reduce it to about $2.75 (£1.80) a gallon. The protest was eventually suspended after this broadcast by the federal government.

Together with the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria, the NLC supported Peter Obi and the Labour Party in the 2023 Nigerian general election, a party the NLC started in 2002. This is the first time the union has expressed explicit support for a political party.

==Women&#x27;s wing==
The National Women Commission is the national women&#x27;s wing of NLC. It was created in 2003 to increase the participation of women in the affairs of the union. Beginning in 1983, demand for more recognition of working women led to the establishment of women&#x27;s wing in state capitals. Currently state branches of NLC have a women&#x27;s committee and the chairperson of the committee is an automatic member of the administrative council of the state&#x27;s NLC. On the national level, the head of the National Women Commission is automatically a vice-president of NLC.The president of the National Women Commission is Comrade Rita Goyit. The women wing also engages in massive rallies and protest in support for women rights and against gender based violence against women.

<text>Maria Gloria Aspillera Diaz (; born April 5, 1951) is a Filipino actress, model and beauty queen who won Miss Universe 1969, becoming the first Filipino to hold the Miss Universe title.

==Early life and family==
Diaz is one of the twelve children of lawyer Jaime Diaz and model and socialite Teresa Aspillera. Her sister, Rio Díaz, was also an actress and beauty queen.

==Pageantry==
Aged 18, while studying in college, Díaz entered and won Binibining Pilipinas 1969. 

Díaz then entered and won Miss Universe 1969, at Miami Beach, Florida, U.S. on July 19, 1969. In the final question round, her answer to the question regarding &quot;men in the moon&quot; charmed the audience and the judges. She was the first Filipina to win the Miss Universe crown. News of her victory (and her measurements) were communicated to the Apollo 11 crew members during their space mission.

During her reign, Díaz travelled through several countries to promote the advocacies supported by the Miss Universe Organization as well as appeared in many public and television events in the United States.

==Controversy==
In a &quot;TV Patrol&quot; interview shortly after the Miss Universe 2010 pageant on August 23, Díaz commented on Binibining Pilipinas contestant Venus Raj becoming 4th runner-up. She suggested in the interview that perhaps Raj and other Filipinas would benefit from answering pageant questions via the use of an interpreter rather than in English. Díaz further said that: 

Her remark sparked outrage amongst many Cebuanos, who felt that Díaz insulted their English proficiency by championing the controversial issue of Tagalog imperialist culture in the Philippines. Cebuano politicians such as Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia and Congresswoman Rachel del Mar called on her to apologise. In response to the controversy, Díaz declared there was no need to apologize and instead clarified her remarks:

On September 1, 2010, the Vice Mayors&#x27; League of the Philippines-Cebu passed a resolution declaring Díaz a &quot;persona non grata&quot; within Cebu City.

<text>Wiener Bonbons (Vienna Sweets), Op. 307, is a waltz by Johann Strauss II written in 1866. It was first performed on 28 January 1866 at the ball of the Association of Industrial Societies held in the ball rooms of the Vienna Hofburg and was dedicated to the influential Princess Pauline Metternich-Winneburg, the wife of then Austrian ambassador to Paris.

The festivity was meant to raise funds to be donated to the construction of German hospitals in Paris and Strauss&#x27; younger brother Josef was initially supposed to be conducting music at the ball without his brother Johann&#x27;s anticipated presence. Johann himself was happy to draw back from conducting at such occasions in addition to allowing Josef to compose a dedication piece for the event although at the last minute, the elder brother opted to contribute a waltz of his own to glorify the event. The result was the waltz &quot;Wiener Bonbons&quot;, a Viennese waltz with Parisian flair. The title, &quot;Vienna Bonbons&quot;, draws on both nationalities.

&lt;/score&gt;

The waltz&#x27;s introduction starts with clarinet and pizzicato strings in a relatively tense mood. Shortly, the first waltz theme makes a bold entry, long chords with a strong first beat in 3/4 time. Later sections are cheeky and flamboyant, contrasted with gentle and reflective melodies. After a short coda, the first waltz theme reappears before accelerating into its rousing finish, complete with a brass flourish underlined by a snare drumroll.

<doc id="1054782" wikidata="Q836169" url="?curid=1054782" title="Qasim Khanate">
<text>The Qasim Khanate (also known as &quot;Qasimov&quot;, &quot;Kasimov&quot; or &quot;Kasim&quot;) was a Tatar-ruled khanate, a vassal of the Principality of Moscow (later Tsardom of Russia), which existed from 1452 until 1681 in the territory of modern Ryazan Oblast in Russia with its capital at Kasimov, in the middle course of the Oka River. It was established in the lands which Grand Prince Vasily II of Moscow (reigned 1425–1462) presented in 1452 to the Kazan prince Qasim Khan (d. 1469), son of the first Kazan khan Olug Moxammat.

== Origins ==
The original populations were the Volga Finnic tribes Meshchyora and Muroma, Mordvins. The land was under Kievan Rus&#x27; and Volga Bulgaria&#x27;s influence. Local tribes were tributaries of Ruthenian dukes. Later, the area was incorporated into Vladimir-Suzdal. In 1152, Duke of Vladimir Yuri Dolgoruky founded Gorodets-Meshchyorskiy. After the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27;, the territory was incorporated into the territory of the Golden Horde. Turkic settlers appeared in those areas, and most of them accepted Islam under the influence from the Volga Bulgars. The semi-independent principality Mishar Yurt was founded by Hordian Mohammad Shirin beg. From 1393, the area became part of Muscovy. After the battle of Suzdal in 1445, Olug Moxammad claimed to return those lands to the Tatars.

According to some historians, such as Khudyakov, Vassily executed the claim and Moxammat&#x27;s son Qasim was crowned as a ruler of Meshchyora lands. The area and capital were renamed after him. Another version is that Qasim came into Muscovite service and was granted those lands to create a buffer state between the Principaltity of Moscow and the Khanate of Kazan. However, the Khanate was a vassal of Muscovy. From the beginning, Khans governed the Khanate&#x27;s territory, but the outer politics were controlled by Muscovy (later Russia).

==Population==

The land was inhabited mainly by Mordvins, some of them as well as other Volga Finnic peoples like the Meshchyora and Muroma have been assimilated by Tatars and became Mishar Tatars. Later, the land was settled by the Russians. Some Kazan Tatars resettled to Qasim lands, and were called &quot;Qasim Tatars&quot;. Most of the Qasim Tatars served at the khan&#x27;s palace or served in the khan&#x27;s military. This group had been assimilated into the Mishar Tatars, but nearly 1,000 Qasim Tatars are still living in the city of Kasimov.

The noble families were the Manghyt (Manğıt), Arghyn (Arğın), Jalair (Cälair), Qipchaq (Qıpçaq). Moscow&#x27;s administrators elected the khans from ruling families of the Tatar khanates: Khanate of Kazan, the Crimean Khanate, and the Siberia Khanate.

==History==

Qasim khans with their guard participated in all of Moscow&#x27;s raids into Kazan (1467–1469, 1487, 1552). Qasim khan Şahğäli (1515–1567) was three times crowned as Kazan khan with the aid of Muscovy. After the conquest of Kazan, the self-government of the khans was abolished and the khanate came to be governed by Russian voyevodas. However, khans still reigned. One of the khans, Simeon Bekbulatovich, was baptised and proclaimed Grand Duke of Moscow in 1574. He never really reigned and was used for a short period by Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible as a puppet head of state. At the reign of Sayed Borhan khan (1627–1679) Russia started a policy of Christianization. Begs, who had a status equal to Boyars, were switched to Serving Tatars, equal to Dvoryans. This policy provoked a Tatar revolt in 1656. After the death of khanbika (queen) Fatima Soltan in 1681, the Khanate was abolished.

<text>Sabratha (; also &quot;Sabratah&quot;, &quot;Siburata&quot;), in the Zawiya District of Libya, was the westernmost of the ancient &quot;three cities&quot; of Roman Tripolis, alongside Oea and Leptis Magna. From 2001 to 2007 it was the capital of the former Sabratha wa Sorman District. It lies on the Mediterranean coast about west of modern Tripoli. The extant archaeological site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.

== Ancient Sabratha ==

Sabratha&#x27;s port was established, perhaps about 500BCE, as the Phoenician trading-post of Tsabratan (, , or , ). This seems to have been a Berber name, suggesting a preëxisting native settlement. The port served as a Phoenician outlet for the products of the African hinterland.
Greeks called it Sabrata (), Sabaratha (), Sabratha ()
 and also Abrotonon (). After the demise of Phoenicia, Sabratha fell under the sphere of influence of Carthage.

Following the Punic Wars, Sabratha became part of the short-lived Numidian kingdom of Massinissa before this was annexed to the Roman Republic as the province of Africa Nova in the 1st century BC. It was subsequently romanized and rebuilt in the 2nd and 3rd centuriesCE. The Emperor Septimius Severus was born nearby in Leptis Magna, and Sabratha reached its monumental peak during the rule of the Severans, when it nearly doubled in size. The city was badly damaged by earthquakes during the 4th century, particularly the quake of 365. It fell under control of the Vandal kingdom in the 5th century, with large parts of the city being abandoned. It enjoyed a small revival under Byzantine rule, when multiple churches and a defensive wall (although only enclosing a small portion of the city) were erected. The town was site of a bishopric. Within a hundred years of the Muslim invasion of the Maghreb, trade had shifted to other ports and Sabratha dwindled to a village.

===Archaeological site===
Sabratha has been the place of several excavation campaigns since 1921, mainly by Italian archaeologists. It was also excavated by a British team directed by Dame Kathleen Kenyon and John Ward-Perkins between 1948 and 1951. Besides its that retains its three-storey architectural backdrop, Sabratha has temples dedicated to Liber Pater, Serapis and Isis. There is a Christian basilica of the time of Justinian and also remnants of some of the mosaic floors that enriched elite dwellings of Roman North Africa (for example, at the Villa Sileen, near Khoms). However, these are most clearly preserved in the colored patterns of the seaward (or Forum) baths, directly overlooking the shore, and in the black and white floors of the theater baths. There is an adjacent museum containing some treasures from Sabratha, but others can be seen in the national museum in Tripoli.

In 1943, during the Second World War, archaeologist Max Mallowan, husband of novelist Agatha Christie, was based at Sabratha as an assistant to the Senior Civil Affairs Officer of the Western Province of Tripolitania. His main task was to oversee the allocation of grain rations, but it was, in the words of Christie&#x27;s biographer, a &quot;glorious attachment&quot;, during which Mallowan lived in an Italian villa with a patio overlooking the sea and dined on fresh tunny fish and olives.

=== Erosion and weathering damage===
According to an April 2016 report, due to soft soil composition and the nature of the coast of Sabratha, which is mostly made up of soft rock and sand, the Ruins of Sabratha are undergoing dangerous periods of coastal erosion. The public baths, olive press building and &#x27;harbor&#x27; can be observed as being most damaged as the buildings have crumbled due to storms and unsettled seas. As the most common building material in Sabratah, calcarenite, is highly susceptible to physical, chemical and biological weathering (particularly marine spray), the long-term conservation of the monuments is endangered. Rising sea levels can also compromise the integrity of the site.

This erosion of the coast of Ancient Sabratha can be seen yearly with significant differences in beach layout and recent crumbled buildings. Breakwaters set in the vicinity of the harbor and olive press are inadequate and too small to efficiently protect the Ancient City of Sabratha.

==Modern Sabratha==
The city is home to Sabratha University. Wefaq Sabratha is the football club, playing at Sabratha Stadium.

As noted in the 2021 documentary &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot;, directed by Peter Jackson, the Sabratha Theater was considered as a possible location where the Beatles could hold their final live concert as a group (they instead performed their last concert on the rooftop of their Apple Corps headquarters).

==Climate==
Sabratha has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;).

<text>Sexten (; ) is a &quot;comune&quot; and a village in South Tyrol in northern Italy. The village is famous as a summer and winter sport resort in the mountains.

== Linguistic distribution ==
According to the 2024 census, 92.37% of the population speak German, 7.38% Italian and 0.25% Ladin as first language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung 2024/Censimento della popolazione 2024&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The town sits in a branch of the Puster Valley, near Innichen and Toblach, where the Drava rises. The district borders East Tyrol, Austria, to the north and the border is formed by the Carnic Alps. To the south lie the Sexten Dolomites and nature park, which includes the famous Drei Zinnen (Tre Cime di Lavaredo).

The commune is bordered, clockwise from the west, by Toblach, Innichen, Sillian (Austria), Kartitsch (Austria), Comelico Superiore (Belluno) and Auronzo di Cadore, (Belluno).

==History==
The village&#x27;s name is of Latin origin: &quot;ad horam sextam&quot;, meaning &quot;at the sixth hour&quot;, referring to its location south of Innichen. &quot;Sexta&quot; is documented starting from 965 AD, due to its connections to the Bavarian Prince-Bishopric of Freising. During World War I, Sexten was on the front line between Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and suffered much damage.

It was conquered by Italy in November 1918. Later it received further fortifications during the Fascist Era.
It is the hometown of tennis player Jannik Sinner.

==Coat-of-arms==
The emblem is azure and represents three argent peaks with a sable chamois standing in the centre; the three peaks symbolize the Tre Cime di Lavaredo. The emblem was granted in 1972 but was in use before World War I.

==Twin towns==
Sexten is twinned with:

* Sankt Veit in Defereggen, Austria
* Zermatt, Switzerland

==Notable residents==

* Jannik Sinner (born 2001), tennis player was raised in Sexten

<doc id="1054800" wikidata="Q261962" url="?curid=1054800" title="Tanith Lee">
<text>Tanith Lee (19 September 1947 – 24 May 2015) was a British science fiction and fantasy writer. She wrote more than 90 novels and 300 short stories, and was the winner of multiple World Fantasy Society Derleth Awards, the World Fantasy Lifetime Achievement Award and the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement in Horror. She also wrote a children&#x27;s picture book (&quot;Animal Castle&quot;), and many poems. She wrote two episodes of the BBC science fiction series &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7 (Sand&quot; and &quot;Sarcophagus)&quot;.

She was the first woman to win the British Fantasy Award best novel award (also known as the August Derleth Award), for her book &quot;Death&#x27;s Master&quot; (1980).

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Tanith Lee was born on 19 September 1947 in London, to professional dancers Bernard and Hylda Lee. Despite a persistent rumour, she was not the daughter of Bernard Lee (the actor who played &quot;M&quot; in the James Bond series films between 1962 and 1979). According to Lee, although her childhood was happy, she was the &quot;traditional kid that got bullied,&quot; and had to move around frequently due to her parents&#x27; work. Although her family was poor, they maintained a large paperback collection, and Lee read weird fiction, including &quot;Silken Swift&quot; by Theodore Sturgeon and &quot;Gabriel Ernest&quot; by Saki, and discussed such literature as &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Dracula&quot; with her parents. Lee attended many different schools in childhood. She was at first &quot;incapable&quot; of reading due to a mild form of dyslexia, which was diagnosed later in life, but when she was aged 8, her father taught her to read in about a month, and she began to write at the age of 9.

=== Education ===
Because Lee&#x27;s parents had to move for jobs, Lee attended numerous primary schools, then the Prendergast Grammar School for Girls. After secondary school, Lee attended Croydon Art College for a year. Realising that was not what she wanted to do, she dropped out of her course and held a number of jobs, including file clerk, waitress, shop assistant, and assistant librarian.

=== Writing career ===
She began publishing with &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (1968), a short story privately printed by a friend, but started serious writing with several children&#x27;s fantasies. Of these, &quot;The Dragon Hoard&quot; (1971), her first novel, is a comic fantasy, in which an enchantress compels the quest-ridden protagonist to shapeshift into a raven at unpredictable moments. &quot;Princess Hynchatti &amp; Some Other Surprises&quot; (collection of linked stories in 1972) puts its cast through various travails. In &quot;Companions on the Road&quot; (1975) the companions are the villains, a trio of hellish revenants who kill through their control of Dreams as they search for the holders of a magic chalice. &quot;The Winter Players&quot; (1976) – assembled with the previous book as &quot;Companions on the Road and The Winter Players: Two Novellas&quot; (1977) – dramatises the interaction between a young woman and the accursed wanderer whom she ultimately redeems. Even in these early works, several characteristic motifs dominate: the Rite of Passage whereby a young protagonist comes to terms – often via Metamorphosis – with his or her extraordinary nature, and strives for Balance in a riven world; vivid, but indeterminate, landscapes serving as almost interchangeable backdrops for psychic dramas; and a fine indifference to any moralistic settling of scores, her tales tending to close with Good and Evil characters settling into uneasy equipoise.

Her first professional sale came from &quot;Eustace,&quot; a ninety-word vignette at the age of 21 in 1968. She continued to work in various jobs for almost another decade, due to rejection of her books. Her first novel (for children) was &quot;The Dragon Hoard&quot;, published in 1971 by Macmillan. Her career took off with the acceptance in 1975 by DAW Books USA of her adult fantasy epic &quot;The Birthgrave&quot; – a mass-market paperback. Many British publishers rejected &quot;The Birthgrave&quot; so she approached DAW Books. Lee subsequently maintained a prolific output in popular genre writing. &quot;The Birthgrave&quot; allowed Lee to be a full-time writer and stop doing &quot;stupid and soul-killing jobs.&quot;

During the nineties her &quot;career went through the doldrums&quot; because of trends in publishing. Major publishing companies were less accepting of Lee&#x27;s later works. The companies which Lee worked with for years refused to look at her proposals. Smaller companies were publishing just a few of Lee&#x27;s works. The refusals did not stop her from writing and she had numerous unpublished novels and short stories. Letters from fans asked if she were dead because no new work had been published. Lee tried changing her genre, but to no success. However, Internet sales succeeded in reviving her writing.

==== Book sales ====
Lee had &quot;quietly phenomenal sales&quot; at certain periods throughout her career. When she tried changing genres, some of her works were liked by critics and published by small publishers, but it made no difference. The royalties were good before the publishers went bankrupt.

=== Personal life and death ===
In 1987, Lee met artist and writer John Kaiine. In 1992, the couple married. They lived in the south of England.

Lee died at her home in East Sussex of breast cancer on 24 May 2015.

== Works ==
Lee often uses the transitional character of the bildungsroman, or coming-of-age stories. For instance, the protagonist of Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Birthgrave&quot; undertakes a journey to understanding her identity and culture.

Lee&#x27;s two longest werewolf stories, &quot;Wolfland&quot; and &quot;Lycanthia&quot;, follow Lee&#x27;s custom of reversing the images of popular culture icons. Lee approximates the werewolves&#x27; behaviours according to the social and hunting patterns of wild wolves. In altering this trope, she endows werewolf stories with a new and more positive mythos.

Lee&#x27;s 1971 debut was the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Dragon Hoard&quot;; her first adult book was &quot;The Birthgrave&quot; in 1975. Lee&#x27;s prolific output spans a host of different genres, including adult fantasy, children&#x27;s fantasy, science fiction, horror, Gothic horror, Gothic romance, and historical fiction. Her series of interconnected tales called &quot;The Flat-Earth Cycle&quot;, beginning with &quot;Night&#x27;s Master&quot; and &quot;Death&#x27;s Master&quot;, is similar in scope and breadth to Jack Vance&#x27;s &quot;The Dying Earth&quot;.

&quot;Night&#x27;s Master&quot; contains allegorical tales involving Azhrarn, a demonic prince who kidnaps and raises a beautiful boy and separates him from the sorrow of the real world. Eventually, the boy wants to know more about the earth, and asks to be returned, setting off a series of encounters between Azhrarn and mankind, some horrific and some positive. Later tales are loosely based on Babylonian mythology. In the science fiction &quot;Four-BEE&quot; series, Lee explores youth culture and identity in a society which grants eternally young teenagers complete freedom. They are even killed and receive new bodies, gender and/or identity over and over again. Lee has also written a historical novel with &quot;The Gods are Thirsty&quot;, set during the French Revolution.During the late 1980s she published three collections - &quot;Dreams of Dark and Light&quot; (1986), &quot;Women as Demons&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Forests of the Night&quot; (1989).

A large part of Lee&#x27;s output was children&#x27;s fantasy, which has spanned her career from &quot;The Dragon Hoard&quot; in 1971 to the more recent &quot;The Claidi Journals&quot; containing &quot;Wolf Tower&quot;, &quot;Wolf Star&quot;, &quot;Wolf Queen&quot; and &quot;Wolf Wing&quot; in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Lee was published by various imprints, particularly depending on whether she is offering adult fiction or children&#x27;s fantasy. Her earlier children&#x27;s fantasy novels were published in hardcover by Macmillan UK and subsequently printed as paperbacks in the US often by DAW, with occasional hardcovers by St. Martin&#x27;s Press. Some of her work was only printed in paperback, mainly in the US by DAW in the 1970s to the early 1980s. She has received some small press treatment, such as the Arkham House edition of short stories &quot;Dreams of Dark and Light: The Great Short Fiction of Tanith Lee&quot; in 1986, and in the first &quot;Night Visions&quot; instalment published by Dark Harvest.

== Writing style ==
Lee&#x27;s style is frequently remarked upon for its use of rich poetic prose and striking imagery. Critics describe her style as weird, lush, vibrant, exotic, erotic, rich, elegant, perverse, and darkly beautiful. The technique she used is very descriptive and poetic to match the themes she used in her mythical stories. She was praised for her ability to balance her weird style with the challenges of writing a faraway world, but some critics counter that her style is not always easy on the reader; she sometimes leaves the reader with unanswered questions.

== Themes ==
Lee&#x27;s writing frequently featured nonconformist interpretations of fairy tales, vampire stories, myths, and the fantasy genre; as well as themes of feminism and sexuality. She also wrote lesbian fiction under the pseudonym Esther Garber. Other than feminism and sexuality, Lee used a wide range of other themes in her stories. From 1975 to 1980, she began writing Gothic science fiction; her first Gothic novel &quot;Sabella or the Bloodstone&quot; features themes of loneliness and fear. Lee&#x27;s most celebrated story &quot;Elle Est Trois&quot;, which examines the relationship between self-destruction and creativity &quot;has themes of psychosis and sexuality, the subjugation of women, and the persuasive power of myth interwoven through it&quot;. Myth is again apparent (along with race) in her stories &quot;The Storm Lord&quot;, &quot;Anackire&quot;, and &quot;The White Serpent&quot;. Three unique horror series were produced by Lee in the &#x27;90s; the first story, &quot;The Book of the Damned&quot;, features themes of body thievery and shape-shifting. Themes of homophobia, racism, and sexism are seen in Lee&#x27;s sequence &quot;The Blood Opera&quot;, and &quot;The Venus Cycle&quot; features themes of love, loss, and revenge. Her collection &quot;Disturbed By Her Song&quot; features themes of eroticism, despair, isolation, and the pressure of an unforgiving and unwelcoming society. These themes reoccur in her 1976 novel &quot;Don&#x27;t Bite the Sun&quot; where the characters are involved in a very erotic lifestyle and the protagonist experiences despair. Eroticism shows up again in her novel &quot;Death&#x27;s Master&quot; which examines the childhood origins of eroticism and the &quot;later conflicts that arise from it&quot;. The sequel to &quot;Don&#x27;t Bite the Sun&quot;, &quot;Drinking Sapphire Wine&quot;, is thematically similar to her other works, in that it features themes of Death and renewal, sexuality, and love. The theme of recognition also appears in &quot;Drinking Sapphire Wine&quot;, where the characters are forced to recognize others and themselves in a world where physical form is so readily alterable.

== Influences ==
Tanith Lee was influenced by multiple genres, including other writers, music, movies, and &quot;small things&quot;. Her Flat Earth Series was inspired by a game she played with her mother; some of her other works are influenced by fairy tales her mother told her. Much of her work comes from &quot;small things&quot; rather than major inspirations.

=== Authors ===
Lee was inspired by writers and playwrights, including Graham Greene, Rebecca West, Elizabeth Bowen, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, Theodore Sturgeon, Angela Carter, Jane Gaskell, Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, William Blake, Anton Chekov, Harold Pinter, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Ibsen, August Strindberg, Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Bunin, James, Rosemary Sutcliff, Mary Renault, Jean Rhys, John Fowles, John le Carré, Brontë family, E.M. Forster, W. Somerset Maugham, Isabel Allende, Margaret Atwood, Ruth Rendell, Lawrence Durrell, Elroy Flecker, and Ted Hughes. Lee considered Virginia Woolf and C.S. Lewis to be influential on her from a young age.

=== Other genres ===
Lee was influenced by painters, movies, television, and music. She cites Sergei Prokofiev, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Dmitri Shostakovich (whose symphonies influenced certain scenes in Anackire), George Frideric Handel, Annie Lennox and Johnny Cash as musical influences. Film influences include &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (with Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains), Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, The &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; (subtitled version), Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The various Quatermass TV series and films inspired Lee, along with the films &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956), Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (1957) and &quot;Plunkett &amp; Macleane&quot; (1999). The TV version of Georg Büchner&#x27;s play &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; (1978), inspired her to write her French historical novel. The painters that have inspired her include Vincent van Gogh, Cotman, J. M. W. Turner, Gustav Klimt, Rousseau, Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, and several pre-Raphaelites.

===Formation and &quot;The Lonely Position of Neutral&quot; (1997–2002)===
Originally formed in Montgomery, Alabama in 1997 under the name 41Down, the band began with vocalist/guitarist Kevin Palmer and drummer Jason Singleton before recruiting bassist Josh Moates and guitarist James Fukai. After building a local fan-base and releasing a self-titled album as well as a couple demos, the band went on to sign a major label deal with Geffen Records. On March 3, 2002, the band changed their name to Trust Company to avoid confusion with the Canadian band Sum 41.

Trust Company&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Lonely Position of Neutral&quot;, was released on July 23, 2002. The album was well received, with the lead single, &quot;Downfall,&quot; gaining heavy exposure through MTV2. Subsequently, the song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles charts. A second single &quot;Running from Me&quot; followed with more moderate success. &quot;The Fear&quot; was released in 2003 as the album&#x27;s third single. &quot;The Lonely Position of Neutral&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA, and the band went on to tour with artists such as Thirty Seconds to Mars and Papa Roach. They also toured with Korn and Disturbed as part of the Pop Sux Tour in 2002.

===&quot;True Parallels&quot; and hiatus (2003–2006)===
Trust Company was scheduled to play at Ozzfest 2003 but was forced to back out by their label in order to work on their second album, &quot;True Parallels&quot;, which was belatedly released on March 22, 2005, after an 8–10 month delay. Several months prior to the album&#x27;s release, original bassist Josh Moates left the group and was replaced by Walker Warren. Despite little promotion from their label, the album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts at No. 32, and has gone on to sell in excess of 200,000 copies. The first and only single from the album, &quot;Stronger,&quot; made a moderate impact on mainstream rock radio. According to drummer Jason Singleton on the band&#x27;s website message board, the second single may have been &quot;The War is Over.&quot;

In August 2005, the band decided to take a break and focus on side projects and spend some time at home. Soon after the break, Palmer and original bassist Josh Moates came together to form a new band called Amity Lane. The band released its debut album &quot;The Sound of Regret&quot; on October 31, 2006. In an interview with IndyConcerts.com following their show in Indianapolis on April 6, 2011, Kevin Palmer was quoted as saying the Amity Lane album was never intended to be released. The whole album was just a fun side project and not even studio-produced. Palmer went on to say that he and Moates recorded the whole album on a computer. Jason Singleton played drums for several bands in Montgomery, including Arm in Arms, The Spicolis, and The Escape Frame. James Fukai reunited with his old band, Hematovore.

===Reunion, &quot;Dreaming in Black and White&quot; and inactivity (2007–present)===
On August 11, 2007, the four original members of the band – Palmer, Moates, Singleton, and Fukai – announced they were reuniting and planned two reunion shows in Montgomery, Alabama and that they will be writing and recording a new album for release sometime in 2008. On March 18, 2008, the band posted two new songs titled &quot;Waking Up&quot; and &quot;Stumbling&quot; on their Myspace page. The band stated in a blog that these were demos and may be re-recorded. They later announced that they would be handing out CDs with previously unreleased or rare material from past years at concerts with the purchase of a T-shirt.

Josh Moates chose to leave the band and was replaced by bassist Eric Salter. Eric Salter left the band in 2009 and was replaced by Wes Cobb.

Trust Company carried out a small US tour at the end of 2010 to promote their new single, &quot;Heart in My Hands&quot;, from their third studio album, &quot;Dreaming in Black and White&quot;, which was released on March 8, 2011. The lead single was released on iTunes on October 5, 2010. In late October 2010, the band finished the music video for &quot;Heart in My Hands&quot; and the video premiered on Vevo on December 15, 2010. The music video features bass player Rachel Bolan of heavy metal band Skid Row. The band went on a two-month tour with Drowning Pool on the promotion of the album.

Trust Company&#x27;s social media has been virtually untouched since 2015, except for on March 3, 2017, when the original unreleased music video for &quot;Stronger&quot; was posted on Facebook, and a post made on Twitter on March 7, 2017, marking 15 years since &quot;The Lonely Position of Neutral&quot; was released.

On October 16, 2017 the official Trust Company Twitter account replied to a fan and stated that a new album is currently in the process of being written. After another two years of inactivity, the band&#x27;s Twitter again confirmed that a new album was in the process of being written on February 22, 2020, although the band stated that it did not have plans to tour at that time.

Trust Company&#x27;s original lineup performed at Blue Ridge Rock Festival in 2023.

<text>Morris Marshall Kirksey (September 13, 1895 – November 25, 1981) was an American track and field athlete and rugby union footballer who won two gold medals at the 1920 Summer Olympics. He is one of the few athletes to win gold medals in two different Olympic sports.

==Biography==
Born in Waxahachie, Texas, Kirksey moved to the San Francisco Bay Area when he was about thirteen years old, and graduated from the Palo Alto High School in 1913.

At the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Kirksey finished second in the 100-meter sprint behind Charley Paddock. Six days later, he anchored the United States 4x100-meter relay team that won the gold medal in a world record time of 42.2 seconds. Two weeks later, Kirksey won his second gold medal, helping the American rugby team defeat France 8–0.

As a Stanford University student, Kirksey won the IC4A championships in in 1921, and repeated the Paddock&#x27;s world record in of 9.6.

Kirksey earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy from Stanford and then a degree from the St. Louis Medical College. He worked as a staff psychiatrist for the state Department of Corrections, assigned to San Quentin and Folsom prisons.

<doc id="1054807" wikidata="Q923468" url="?curid=1054807" title="Creole pig">
<text>The Creole pig is a landrace of pig indigenous to Hispaniola.

Creole pigs are well adapted to local conditions, such as available feed and conditions needed for their management as livestock, and were popular with the Haitian peasant farmers until an extermination campaign in the 1980s. They served as a type of savings account for the Haitian peasant: sold or slaughtered to pay for marriages, medical emergencies, schooling, seeds for crops, or Voodoo ceremonies. The dark black pigs are known for their boisterous nature and have been incorporated into elements of vodou folklore and the oral history of the Haitian Revolution.

In the late 1970s an outbreak of African swine fever hit the neighboring Dominican Republic and spread to Haiti. Officials feared it would spread to the United States, where it could devastate the pork industry. The United States Agency for International Development, USAID, and the Haitian government led a campaign, known by the French acronym PEPPADEP (), to exterminate Haiti&#x27;s pigs. Farmers who were compensated received pigs imported from the United States that were far more vulnerable to Haiti&#x27;s environment and expensive to keep. In the year following the slaughter, levels of enrollment in schools were dramatically lower throughout Haiti&#x27;s countryside.

In the Haitian peasant community, the government&#x27;s eradication and repopulation program was highly criticized. The peasants protested that they were not fairly compensated for their pigs and that the breed of pigs imported from the United States to replace the hardy Creole pigs was unsuitable for the Haitian environment and economy.

In recent years, Haitian and French agronomists have bred a new variety of pig similar to Haiti&#x27;s Creole pig. An effort to repopulate Haiti with these pigs is underway. The original creole pig is reported to have survived in small numbers in the Haitian countryside.

<text>John Cohen Coyle (28 September 1932 –14 May 2016) was a Scottish footballer.

Coyle started his career with Dundee United for whom he signed in 1950. His early years were interrupted by his National Service, while he also spent time on loan to Brechin City. As a result, by the beginning of the 1955-56 season he had made only eight first team appearances. From that point onwards however, his form was a revelation, with 77 goals in 88 appearances in the following two and a half seasons.

Despite Coyle&#x27;s goals, United could do no better than mid-table mediocrity in Division Two and when Clyde expressed interest in December 1957, Coyle expressed his desire to move to the Division One side. An £8,000 deal was concluded and Coyle moved to Glasgow where he made an immediate impression with the &quot;Bully Wee&quot;, scoring frequently during the second half of the 1957-58 season. He also scored the winning goal in the 1958 Scottish Cup Final, as Clyde defeated Hibernian 1–0 at Hampden Park.

Coyle&#x27;s meteoric rise was confirmed when he was selected in the Scotland squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup that summer. He did not make an appearance during the finals in Sweden however and indeed never actually played for the Scotland national side.

Coyle&#x27;s younger brother Jimmy was also a professional footballer, being signed for Dundee United during the same period as his brother (Jimmy Reid and two other players also made the move at the same time) and playing alongside him at Tannadice Park for a season.

He died on 14 May 2016.

<text>The Suwon Samsung Bluewings () are a South Korean football club based in Suwon that competes in the K League 2, the second tier of South Korean football. Founded in December 1995, they have won the K League on four occasions (1998, 1999, 2004 and 2008), as well as the Asian Club Championship twice, in 2000–01 and 2001–02.

==History==
The club was officially founded in December 1995 by Samsung Electronics, becoming the ninth member of the K League from the 1996 season. It was also the first club to be founded in one specific city, a plan which led to the K-League initiating plans to encourage its other clubs to forge similar links with local communities.

Former South Korean national team manager Kim Ho took charge of the side from their first season in the K-League, and the team finished runners-up in the championship play-off that season. The championship was secured in 1998 and retained in 1999 as Suwon started to dominate Korean football.

Suwon lifted the Asian Club Championship twice in succession in 2000–01 and 2001–02, and also added the Asian Super Cup to their roll of honors on two occasions.

In the 2002 season, Suwon also won the Korean FA Cup for the first time, achieving a continental double.

The departure of Kim Ho in 2003 saw Korean football legend Cha Bum-kun appointed manager ahead of the 2004 season, and the club won its third league title in his debut season as manager.

Suwon finished runners-up in both major domestic competitions in 2006, as Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma claimed victory in the K-League championship play-off final and Chunnam Dragons won in the FA Cup final, thwarting Suwon&#x27;s attempts to win the first ever domestic double in South Korean football.

The 2008 season became one of the most successful seasons in the club&#x27;s history. Suwon achieved a domestic double by winning the K League Championship and the League Cup.

Since the appointment of coach Seo Jung-won in 2013, the team started focusing on financial self-sufficiency and reducing expenditures, marking a shift away from its previous approach of receiving generous support from its parent company Samsung Electronics, with ownership eventually being transferred to Cheil Worldwide, a Samsung affiliate. The club began transitioning from being a &quot;team that wins by effectively utilizing the parent company&#x27;s budget&quot; to &quot;a team that generates its own revenue and maintains appropriate performance.&quot;

Major financial changes at the club led to poor results, and in the 2023 season, the club was relegated to the second-tier K League 2 for the first time in its history after finishing last.

==Crest and colours==
===Crest===

The current crest has been used by the Bluewings since 2008. It depicts the Hwaseong Fortress, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a prominent symbol of the city of Suwon. The wing on the top of the crest is the club&#x27;s first crest and symbolises their will to rise to the of world football.

===Colours===
The Bluewings&#x27; colours are blue, red and white. Blue is the colour of Samsung and also symbolises youth and hope. Red is the symbol of bravery, passion, challenge, vitality and dynamism. White represents benevolence, purity and fair play.

==Stadium==
The Suwon Samsung Bluewings used the 11,808-seat Suwon Sports Complex as their home stadium from 1995 through 2001.

Samsung began building the Suwon World Cup Stadium, the current home of the Bluewings, in 1996, but construction stopped in 1998 due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. With the support of the city of Suwon and Gyeonggi Province, the stadium was completed in May 2001. It was used as a venue for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Based on the shape of the roof of the stadium, fans sometimes call the stadium the &quot;Big Bird&quot;.

The Bluewings&#x27; training ground is located in Dongtan, a district of Hwaseong.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Frente Tricolor is the official Suwon Samsung Bluewings supporters group. The group is known for its fanatical support for the club, especially versus its major rivals, which has sometimes led to violent incidents between Suwon supporters and rival fans.

The club&#x27;s official theme song is &quot;My Love, My Suwon&quot; by the South Korean punk rock band No Brain. It is based on the song &quot;Little Baby&quot;, released in 2003, and Suwon fans sang it by changing the lyrics.

The club shares its most fierce rivalry with FC Seoul in a derby dubbed the Super Match. The origins of the derby comes from when FC Seoul was based in the city of Anyang, where its previous parent company LG had a major presence. The derby was not only a rivalry between the cities of Anyang and Suwon, but one between Samsung and LG, two of the largest electronics companies in South Korea. The rivalry has continued since FC Seoul&#x27;s relocation to Seoul. The derby now represents a rivalry between Seoul, the largest city in South Korea, and Suwon, the capital of Gyeonggi Province, the most populous administrative unit in South Korea that surrounds Seoul.

The club also shares rivalries with other major clubs in the Seoul Capital Area, including cross-town Suwon FC (Suwon Derby), FC Anyang (Jijidae Derby), Incheon United (Suin Derby), and Seongnam FC (Magye Derby), although its rivalry with Seongnam has weakened since Seongnam has declined as a major force in the K League.

<doc id="1054825" wikidata="Q966668" url="?curid=1054825" title="Punching bag">
<text>A punching bag (or British English punchbag) is a sturdy bag designed to be repeatedly punched. A punching bag is usually cylindrical and filled with various materials of suitable hardness.

==History==

Punching bags have been used in martial arts and swordplay for the entire written history of military training. Similar apparatus in Asian martial arts include the Okinawan makiwara and the Chinese mook jong, which may have padded striking surfaces attached to them.

In martial arts and combat sports—such as karate, taekwondo, and Muay Thai—&quot;heavy&quot; bags, standing bags, and similar apparatuses have been adapted for practicing kicking and other striking maneuvers in addition to developing punching technique.

==Construction==
Punching bags are often filled with grains, sand, rags, or other material, and are usually hung from the ceiling or affixed to a stand. Other bags have an internal bladder to allow them to be filled with air or water. The design of a punching bag allows it to take repeated and constant physical abuse without breaking. The bag must also absorb the impact of blows without causing harm to the user.

==Types==
There are different types of punching bags, with different names based on their size, use and mounting method. Almost all punching bags are covered with either leather or synthetic materials such as vinyl which resist abrasion and mildew. Canvas can also be used as a bag material where there is lower use and humidity.

 
Speed bags (AKA, speedballs) are small, air-filled bags anchored at the top to a rebound platform parallel to the ground. Speed bags help a fighter learn to keep their hands up, improve hand-eye coordination, and learn to shift weight between feet when punching. They are also known as speedballs or speed ball bags. They are generally filled with air and fitted around a tight PU-based or leather material. They come in various sizes, ranging from the large and , midsize , and , to the small , and . Generally the larger the bag, the slower it is and the more force is required to keep it going. Large bags are used more for building strength and endurance, while smaller bags allow the training athlete to focus on faster hand speed, timing and coordination. Beginners might view this bag more as a &quot;control bag&quot;, not a speed bag, for they will not be able to punch both quickly and repetitively until they gain control over their swinging force and speed.

A boxer normally hits the speed bag from the front with his or her fists, but it is also possible to use fists and elbows to hit the bag from all around it, including the front, back and sides. In this method the user may perform many diverse punching combinations that create improvised rhythmic accents.

Although speed bags are normally hung vertically, recently the additional method of hanging a bag horizontally on a wall has regained popularity. This was very popular during the early twentieth century, specifically the 1920s–1940s era. The same punching skills may be used on the horizontal bag that are used when it hangs vertically. A coordination bag is a new type of speed bag that moves unpredictably rather than rhythmically. Additionally, due to the tedious mounting and anchoring necessary when installing a traditional speed bag platform, a portable speed bag platform that installs in a doorway has been created. Designed so that downward pressure stabilizes this portable speed bag platform, it can be installed and removed through a tension system that allows for use in any doorway.

Swerve balls/floor-to-ceiling balls/double-end bags are almost the same as speed bags, with the only differences being that the bag&#x27; size, shape and material may be different, and that the cable system is attached to both the ceiling and a clip on the floor — when the boxer makes any strike on the ball, it reacts by swinging fast towards them, the object being to swerve, punch, dodge and improve co-ordination. The harder and faster these bags are hit, the more they rebound and react in different motions and angles, thus giving broader practice to the fighter. Double-floor to ceiling balls which allow for training body-head combinations also exist.

Maize bags or slip bags are not punched with great force, but are used in boxing training to improve the athlete&#x27;s head motion and ability to evade an opponent&#x27;s punch, their name deriving from the fact that traditionally they are filled with maize.

A heavy bag is a larger, cylindrical bag, usually suspended by chains or ropes and used for practicing powerful body punches, and can be used to toughen hands or any other limb used to hit the bag. Heavy bags are for developing power; technique is best learned on the punch mitts or pads. Some variants of heavy bag are a Banana Bag used in Muay Thai, which is longer than a regular heavy bag and is used to train low kicks and knee strikes, and a slim line bag that is thinner than a heavy bag.

Freestanding heavy bags are heavy bags mounted on a weighted pedestal rather than being hung from above. The base is typically filled with sand or water to give more stability to the bag and prevent it from moving around. While they serve the same purpose as hanging heavy bags, they can also be toppled over and used for ground-and-pound practice. Other variations on the standard heavy bag include horizontal suspension from both ends to practice uppercut punches, and non-cylindrical shapes. Freestanding reflex bags (freestanding speed bags) also exist.

Uppercut bags began to appear towards the beginning of the 21st century. With so many different variations of bags and training equipment for boxing taking off, the uppercut bag was and is still a common sight in clubs and gyms.

Designed for uppercut practice, jabbing, curl punching and quick bursts of high and low punching practice, it allows the fighter to punch at different lengths, different speeds and different forces compared to the standard average 4-foot straight PU (polyurethane) punching bags. Some types of uppercut bags: An angle bag a variant of uppercut bag used for training hooks and uppercuts; an uppercut horizontal punching tag, teardrop bag, body snatcher/wrecking ball bag or bowling pin bag are used for training knees and uppercuts.

A wall bag is a type of bag that is attached to a wall and can be used for training hooks and uppercuts.

Body-shaped training aids such as the modern &quot;body opponent bag&quot; are made primarily of synthetic materials, and punching bags are sometimes mounted on a weighted pedestal rather than hanging from above. These bags try to simulate a live opponent while providing an opportunity to practice vital area strikes which are generally unsafe to perform on a sparring partner. These are not considered punching bags in the strict sense, but modern versions of apparatus such as the wooden man apparatus of Chinese Wing Chun, the medieval quintain, and target dummies used in modern bayonet training. Large inflatable balloons with weighted bases are another kind of punching bag, often painted with a picture and sold as a children&#x27;s toy.

==Safety precautions==

Heavy bags are typically filled with dense material which have little &quot;give&quot; (e.g., packed sand, grains, etc.); in order to avoid injury, hand protection (boxing gloves, bag gloves, training gloves, hand wraps, etc.) is used during practice.

Powerful strikes to the heavy bag are not recommended for inexperienced, or younger athletes (&lt;18 female, &lt;21 male), as risk of sprain, strain, or bone-plate damage may adversely affect bone structures. It is highly recommended to carefully focus strikes to reduce chance of injury (such as boxer&#x27;s fracture).

<text>Joseph Knefler Taussig (30 August 1877 – 29 October 1947) was a vice admiral in the United States Navy. He served in the Spanish–American War, Philippine–American War, China Relief Expedition, Cuban Pacification, World War I, Second Nicaraguan Campaign, and World War II.

==Biography==
The son of German-Jewish parents Rear Admiral Edward D. Taussig and his wife Ellen Kneffler, the daughter of Frederick Knefler, Joseph Taussig was Jewish and was born in Dresden, Germany, where his father, a lieutenant (navy) was on special service at the European Station (February 1877 – January 1880). One of five sons, he entered the United States Naval Academy (USNA) in 1895. His older brother, Paul Taussig, had been enrolled at the USNA but died the previous July of a sudden onset of acute appendicitis. Joseph Taussig, like his late brother, excelled in athletics at USNA. A football star, he was quarterback for the 1899 Navy team. He also excelled at track and field events and was president of the USNA Athletic Association. He was the second of a four-generational family of United States Naval Academy graduates that served from 1863 to 1970 starting with his father, Rear Admiral Edward D. Taussig (1847–1921), continuing with his son Captain Joseph K. Taussig Jr. (1920–1999), and ending with his grandson, Captain Joseph K. Taussig III USMC (1945–). One of his daughters married George Philip for whom the USS George Philip was named.

==Spanish–American War==
When the Spanish–American War began in April, 1898, Taussig was in his final year as a cadet (as midshipmen at USNA were known from the latter part of the 19th century until 1902). He was assigned to the flagship of Admiral William T. Sampson, the cruiser , and was on board during the bombardment of Aguadores and Santiago and the pivotal naval Battle of Santiago de Cuba on July 3, 1898, where the Spanish fleet was wiped out and Admiral Pascual Cervera taken prisoner.

Taussig was a prolific and talented journalist and writer during his entire 46-year naval career. In later years, his direct and honest candor earned him the professional disfavor of Assistant Secretary of the Navy (and later President of the United States) Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels. In the daily 125 page journal (with an additional 35 pages of imprints) that Taussig maintained of his experiences and observations during the Spanish–American War, he wrote about the troops embarkation from Tampa, Florida, the Army landing at Daiquirí and Siboney, the condition of the Cuban and Spanish armies, the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, a visit to Morro Castle in Havana Harbor and the fleet&#x27;s triumphal and feted return to New York Navy Yard after the end of hostilities in August 1898. Taussig&#x27;s journal includes his pencil sketches of troops, ships, locations, maps, and prints of naval personnel involved in the war. He also wrote numerous letters to his father and brother Charles Taussig, who became a well-known attorney in New York City. Returning to complete his studies at the USNA, Taussig graduated in the class of 1899.

==Philippine–American War==
Following graduation, he was assigned to the protected cruiser which departed New York Naval Yard in March 1899 bound for the Philippines. The ship made ports of call in the Caribbean, Caracas (Venezuela), Montevideo (Uruguay) and ports in Chile and Peru before heading up the California coast to Mare Island Navy Yard near San Francisco for outfitting and repairs prior to deployment with the Asiatic Squadron. Departing from the West Coast, made stops in Hawaii and Guam in transit to the Western Pacific and arrived in Cavite in November 1899. For the next five months, was station ship at Vigan on the island of Luzon. During that time, Taussig was part of a landing party that embarked at Pamplona to rescue American citizens being held hostage by Insurrectos opposed to U.S. control of the Philippines. However, once there, the landing party was ordered to return to the ship. In December, moved to Aparri where it accepted the surrender of the Insurrectos in the provinces of Isabela, Cagayan and Bataan.

==China Relief Expedition (Boxer Rebellion)==
In April 1900, was ordered to sail to Japan and then to Taku, China as part of the multinational China Relief Expedition being mobilized to rescue the foreign legations in Peking that were then besieged by the Boxers, a movement that opposed the growing influence of European business interests and Christian missionaries in China. The joint naval force was under the command of Vice Admiral Edward Hobart Seymour, Royal Navy with Captain Bowman H. McCalla, USN of the , second in command. As a naval cadet member of the multinational landing force that came to be known as the Seymour Relief Expedition Taussig served alongside and began a long and fraternal professional association with Royal Navy officers Captain John Jellicoe and Lieutenant David Beatty who later advanced to First Sea Lords of the Royal Navy.

On June 7, 1900, the 2,100 strong Seymour Relief Expedition set out from Tientsin by train with the destination Peking and the objective the release of the besieged foreign legations. However, progress was repeatedly halted due to stretches of track that had been torn up by the Boxers and intermittent attacks. The imperial forces of the Dowager Empress were allied with the Boxers and joined in the attacks. Just seven days into its rescue mission, the expedition was forced to retreat to Tientsin due to the rail-bed both north and south of Yang Tsun being destroyed by the Boxers, cutting off the force&#x27;s supply replenishment. During the retreat, Taussig was seriously wounded in the leg during a Boxer attack. He recovered in Japan and was advanced four numbers in grade because of his injury. Forty-three years later he was awarded the Purple Heart for his combat wounds.

As he had done during the Spanish–American War, Taussig maintained a daily journal of the time he was in the Philippines and subsequently China while attached to as a naval cadet. These include detailed descriptions of his shipmates and officers including Captain Bowman H. McCalla of the , Vice Admiral Seymour, the progress and setback of the Seymour Expedition, the political dynamics, social customs and recreation in China, and drawings of engineering details of and urban scenes in Vigan and Pamplona. Of tactical significance, the journal includes a list of the ports of call for and an intelligence report on the fortifications of Sydney, Australia and the government of New South Wales. Taussig submitted his journal to Captain John Fremont of the who attested to it and pronounced it an excellent piece of work. The 120 page journal that Taussig wrote during his time attached to was the basis for his April 1927 article on the Seymour Relief Expedition, one of forty-four articles that he eventually authored for the U.S. Naval Institute magazine &quot;Proceedings&quot;.

==Cuban pacification and inter-war years==
Following recuperation from his leg wound, Taussig was assigned to the in the Philippines and then to the , a supply ship carrying food stores for the Army from Australia to the Philippines. Following that, he was assigned to commanded by his father, Commander Edward D. Taussig USN. While serving on at Yokohama Harbor, Taussig rescued a shipmate who had gone to the rescue of another drowning man. Both men were saved and for his heroism, Taussig was awarded the Silver Life Saving Medal by the U.S. Treasury Department in 1902. Of the numerous personal decorations and service medals he was awarded, it was the medal that Taussig prized most throughout his life.

After two years as a naval cadet, and having participated in three separate conflicts initiated by native interests opposing foreign intervention by the age of twenty-three, Taussig was commissioned ensign on 28 January 1901 to begin a series of promotions and distinctions that would underscore his service to the navy. Returning to the United States from the Asiatic Squadron in 1902, he was assigned to and next served as navigator on . In 1905 he was on , the station ship at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The following year he was navigator and executive officer on . In 1907, Taussig joined the officer staff of , one of the ships of the Great White Fleet that circumnavigated the globe in 1907 as a demonstration of U.S. Naval seapower and global presence. After the fleet rounded Cape Horn and steamed up the western coasts of South and North America, he detached from at Mare Island Navy Yard and was assigned to the staff of his father, Edward D. Taussig, by then a rear admiral and commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. In 1910 he was appointed flag secretary and aide to Rear Admiral Charles Vreeland, commander of the 2nd and 4th Divisions of the Atlantic Fleet.

Promoted to lieutenant commander, in 1911 he took command of the destroyer , followed by an assignment to the Bureau of Navigation in Washington, D.C., until 1915. This duty gave Taussig the background experience which resulted in his exposing personnel shortcomings in the navy following World War I. In 1915, he first locked horns with then Assistant Navy Secretary Franklin D. Roosevelt and Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels when he and several other navy officers, notably Admiral William Sims, were critical of a program that provided for the use of paroled criminals to fill the depleted ranks of enlisted personnel. In 1915, Taussig returned to sea in command of the newly commissioned destroyer and Division 6, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. The following year, Taussig received promotion to the rank of commander.

==World War I==

In July 1916, after serving in battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and on staffs afloat, Taussig was assigned command of Division 8, Destroyer Force (DesDiv 8), Atlantic Fleet. The US entered World War I in April 1917. At that time, Britain was suffering from unchecked U-boat attacks on merchant shipping in the North Atlantic, so in May 1917 President Woodrow Wilson ordered DesDiv 8 to Queenstown, Ireland, to assist the British Royal Navy - the first group of American destroyers sent abroad during the war.

After a nine-day Atlantic crossing, most of the time in a severe southeast gale, DesDiv 8 reached Queenstown. The British commander at Queenstown, Vice Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly, hosted a dinner in the Americans&#x27; honor on the night of their arrival. At the dinner, Bayly asked Commander Taussig &quot;When will you be ready to go to sea?&quot; Taussig replied in the now famous words: &quot;We are ready now, sir; that is, as soon as we finish refueling.&quot;

For an attack on a German U-boat on 29 July 1917, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, at that time the Navy&#x27;s second highest valor award. In December 1917, he returned to the US to take command of the newly commissioned destroyer . By May 1918, &quot;Little&quot; was in Europe, patrolling off the coast of France. The journal that Commander Taussig kept of his service in World War I was published in 1996 by the Naval War College Press under the title &quot;The Queenstown Patrol, 1917&quot;. With the war winding down, he was detached to the Bureau of Navigation in August 1918.

==Conflict with Assistant Navy Secretary Franklin D. Roosevelt==
Promoted to captain in September 1918, he was assigned to head the Division of Enlisted Personnel of the Bureau of Navigation. Aware of the inadequacies of manpower from his experience in the fleet during World War I, in 1920, he was embroiled in a publicized dispute with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Navy Affairs regarding the personnel shortage in the navy, stating that navy department heads had failed &quot;to take adequate steps to provide personnel necessary for the proper conduct of the navy during the war.&quot; For his outspoken views, Taussig earned the lifetime enmity of Roosevelt, who was in a political fight with the Republican Party over his nomination as Vice President, and wrote a sharp letter to the navy subcommittee denying Taussig&#x27;s charges.

Taussig candidly maintained that, &quot;the Navy was far from being ready for War... and the enlisted personnel was entirely inadequate for the proper manning of our already completed ships on a peace time basis, and was dangerously inadequate should we suddenly be thrown into war.&quot; Secretary Josephus Daniels was angered by Taussig&#x27;s dissent and denied publication of Taussig&#x27;s prize-winning essay on naval personnel in the Naval Institute press.

==Inter-war years==
In 1919 he attended the senior course at the Naval War College, graduating in 1920 and appointed to the staff of the president of the Naval War College. The following year he was a staff member in the Tactics Department. In 1921 he was assigned to command , later renamed &quot;Columbia&quot;, briefly flagship of the United States Atlantic Fleet. In 1922 his ship, , rendered assistance to the victims of an earthquake and tsunami in Chile. For his actions, he was awarded the Order of the Merit of Chile for his efforts in the earthquake relief during 1922. In 1923, he was Assistant Chief of Staff, to Admiral Hilary P. Jones, Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet for six months.

From July 1923 to June 1926, he was on the staff of the Naval War College where he was Chairman of the Strategy Department. In 1926, he was given command of the light cruiser . From 1927 to 1930, he returned to the Naval War College as Chief of Staff and on 16 May 1930, was given command of the battleship . He was promoted to rear admiral on 1 July 1931 and served as chief of staff to Admiral Richard H. Leigh, Commander, Battle Fleet. In 1933 he was appointed Assistant Chief of Naval Operations in the Navy Department. However, with Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) having been inaugurated President of the United States in January of that year, according to Admiral Frederic S. Withington, Taussig never had a chance of promotion beyond rear admiral because of his dispute with FDR in the 1920s. FDR was criticized by newspaper columnists Drew Pearson and Robert S. Allen in 1936 when instead of appointing Taussig commander of the United States Fleet, he was assigned to command Battleship Division 3, Battle Force, with his flag on the . In 1937, still with the rank of rear admiral, he was appointed commander of Cruisers, Scouting Force, with his flag on the heavy cruiser . In May 1938, he was attached as commandant, Norfolk Navy Yard and Fifth Naval District, a billet his father Edward D. Taussig had filled thirty years earlier.

==Another clash with FDR==
In May 1940, Taussig again locked horns with now-president Franklin D. Roosevelt, when Massachusetts Senator David I. Walsh invited Taussig to testify at Senate hearings on plans to expand the navy. Taussig advocated the building of and s and offered testimony to the aggressive, imperialistic designs of the Empire of Japan that planned to annex China, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies. He warned of the superiority of the Japanese Merchant fleet to that of the US, and the need to replenish U.S. bases in the Pacific Ocean and prepare for defense of the Philippines, stating, &quot;I cannot see how we can escape being forced into war based on the present trends of events.&quot; He also claimed that the Tanaka Memorial was genuine. Taussig&#x27;s testimony set off a controversy that lasted in the press for weeks and infuriated FDR who wanted Taussig relieved of his command of Norfolk Navy Yard and the Fifth Naval District. However, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Harold R. Stark convinced Roosevelt to reconsider and Roosevelt took no action; however, Stark publicly stated that Taussig&#x27;s views were contrary to the Navy Department&#x27;s and on 23 April 1940, issued a reprimand that was placed in Taussig&#x27;s file.

==World War II==
Rear Admiral Taussig was forced to retire in September 1941 due to his age, despite his petition to continue on active duty with the impending international crisis. He was promoted to vice admiral on 22 October 1941 due to his service in the Boxer Rebellion. He had testified to the Senate committee on naval affairs in April 1940 that war with Japan over the Philippines was inevitable without a change in policy. His testimony included accurate predictions on the coming war in the Pacific. According to a May 9, 1940 article by Drew Pearson, Taussig was forced into retirement due to his public prediction that war with Japan was inevitable. In a June 9, 1940 article authored by Drew Pearson and Robert S. Allen, Taussig was referred to as &quot;the star scholar and strategist of the navy.&quot;

On 8 December 1941, President Roosevelt ordered the reprimand removed from Taussig&#x27;s personnel file, after his son, Ensign Joseph K. Taussig Jr. was severely wounded and lost his leg, earning a Navy Cross while serving on the during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

Taussig&#x27;s request to return to active duty was ultimately granted in 1943 and he served in the
office of the Secretary of the Navy on the Naval Clemency and Prison Inspection Board, the Naval Discipline Policy Review Board, and the Procurement and Retirement Board, until 1 June 1947, only a few months before his death.

Vice Admiral Taussig died on 29 October 1947 at Bethesda Naval Hospital. He was one of a very few individuals who served in the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II.

His survivors then included his wife of 38 years, Lulie Johnston Taussig, of Washington, D.C. and Jamestown, RI; two daughters, Mrs. Emily Whitney Sherman, of Newport, RI and Mrs. Margaret Philip Helmer of Irvine, CA and his son Captain Joseph K. Taussig, Jr. of Annapolis, MD. His daughter Margaret had been married to Commander George Philip Jr. until his death in 1945.

<doc id="1054828" wikidata="Q7795462" url="?curid=1054828" title="Thomas de Cantilupe">
<text>Thomas de Cantilupe (25 August 1282; also spelled &quot;Cantelow, Cantelou, Canteloupe&quot;, Latinised to &quot;de Cantilupo&quot;) was Lord Chancellor of England and Bishop of Hereford. He was canonised in 1320 by Pope John XXII. He has been noted as &quot;an inveterate enemy of the Jews&quot;, and his demands that they be expelled from England were cited in the evidence presented for his canonization.

==Origins==
Thomas was the third son of William II de Cantilupe (died 1251) (anciently &quot;Cantelow, Cantelou, Canteloupe, etc&quot;, Latinised to &quot;de Cantilupo&quot;), 2nd feudal baron of Eaton Bray in Bedfordshire, who was steward of the household to King Henry III (as his father William I de Cantilupe (died 1239) had been to Henry&#x27;s father King John). Thomas&#x27;s mother was Millicent (or Maud) de Gournai (died 1260), a daughter of Hugh de Gournai and widow of Amaury VI of Montfort-Évreux (died 1213), Earl of Gloucester. He was born at Hambleden in Buckinghamshire, a manor belonging to his mother&#x27;s first husband but awarded to her during her lifetime as her dowry. Thomas&#x27;s uncle was Walter de Cantilupe (died 1266), Bishop of Worcester.

==Career==
Cantilupe was educated at Oxford, Paris and Orléans, and was a teacher of canon law at the University of Oxford, where he became Chancellor in 1261.

During the Second Barons&#x27; War, Cantilupe favoured Simon de Montfort and the baronial party. He represented the barons before King Louis IX of France at Amiens in 1264.

On 25 February 1264, when he was Archdeacon of Stafford, Cantilupe was made Lord Chancellor of England, but was deprived of the office after de Montfort&#x27;s death at the Battle of Evesham, and lived abroad for a while. Following his return to England, he was again appointed Chancellor of Oxford University, where he lectured on theology and held several ecclesiastical appointments.

==Bishop of Hereford==

In 1274 Cantilupe attended the Second Council of Lyons and on 14 June 1275 he was appointed Bishop of Hereford, being consecrated on 8 September 1275.

Cantilupe was now a trusted adviser of King Edward I and when attending royal councils at Windsor Castle or at Westminster he lived at Earley in Berkshire. Even when differing from the king&#x27;s opinions, he did not forfeit his favour.

Cantilupe asked special permission from Edward I to preach to the Jews of Hereford to convert them. Later, during the coin clipping crisis, where large numbers of Jews were targeted and accused of tampering with the currency, Cantilupe objected to the use of a converted Jew to investigate the charges. He then demanded that any unconverted Jews should be expelled from the Kingdom as “enemies of God and rebels against the faith” (&quot;inimici Dei et rebelles fidei&quot;), threatened to resign and broke down in tears. The King was reported to have capitulated to his demands.

Cantilupe had a &quot;great conflict&quot; in 1290 with the &quot;Red Earl&quot;, Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester, 6th Earl of Hertford, concerning hunting rights in Malvern, Worcestershire, and a ditch dug by de Clare. The issue was settled by costly litigation.

After the death in 1279 of Robert Kilwardby, Archbishop of Canterbury, a friend of Cantilupe&#x27;s, and formerly his confessor, a series of disputes arose between him and John Peckham, the new archbishop. The disagreements culminated in Peckham excommunicating Cantilupe, who proceeded to Rome to pursue the matter with the pope.

==Death, burial, and canonization==

Cantilupe died at Ferento, near Orvieto, in Italy, on 25 August 1282, on his way to Rome. He is buried in Hereford Cathedral. His cult was swiftly established at Hereford, and his canonization was promoted by his protege, the next Bishop, Richard Swinefield. Miracles were recorded by 1283; however Cantilupe&#x27;s dispute with Peckham continued to haunt him after his death, as Peckham was outraged that Cantilupe was being put forward as a saint, as Cantilupe was still excommunicated in his view, which would preclude him for consideration.

Supporters of his cult included Edward I, who attended the ceremony to translate Cantilupe&#x27;s body to its new position in 1287, seen as a step towards confirmation of his sainthood. Edward I is recorded as saying that he was keen &quot;to have as a sympathetic patron in heaven him whom we had in our household on earth&quot;.
===Evidence for his canonization===
Among the evidence gathered and submitted to the Pope was evidence of his hostility to Jews, particularly his insistence to Edward I that those that did not convert should be expelled from England.

One of the many miracles cited in his cause of canonization was the supposed raising from the dead of William Cragh, a Welsh rebel who was hanged in 1290, eight years after Cantilupe&#x27;s death. 

A papal inquiry was convened in London on 20 April 1307 to determine whether or not Cantilupe had died excommunicate, since this would have precluded his being canonized. Forty-four witnesses were called and various letters produced, before the commissioners of the inquiry concluded that Cantilupe had been absolved in Rome before his death. It was difficult for his cause of death to be determined as much of his body had disintegrated.

After a papal investigation lasting almost 13 years, Cantilupe was canonized by Pope John XXII on 17 April 1320. His feast day was fixed on 2 October.

===Cult and shrine===
His shrine became a popular place of pilgrimage, but only its base survived the Reformation until a new upper section (a feretory) was recreated in 2008 under the guidance of Nicholas Quayle. The new section is in vivid colours with a painted scene of the Virgin and Child holding the Mappa Mundi. A reliquary containing his skull has been held at Downside Abbey in Somerset since 1881.

It is generally believed that the Hereford Mappa Mundi was created to be used as part of his cult. A number of references on the map itself, such as a hunting scene, may refer to him directly. The belief system on the map includes a number of derogatory or anti-Semitic images that identify the Exodus and devil worship with contemporaneous Jewry, which may echo the beliefs of Cantilupe himself. Architectural features of the Cathedral, which are also thought to relate to the cult, echo similar anti-Jewish themes, in particular &quot;Synagoga&quot;, a blindfolded Jew with a broken staff, dropping twin tablets of God&#x27;s law.

Records of his cult and financial receipts for it still exist and have formed the basis of several studies. These provide one of the few extensive records of a pre-Reformation cult in England. Objects venerating Cantilupe have been found across a wide area, suggesting that his cult may have been more extensive than has previously been assumed.

===Current Catholic veneration===
In the current Latin edition of the Roman Martyrology (2004 edition), Cantilupe is listed under 25 August as follows: &quot;At Montefiascone in Tuscia, the passing of Saint Thomas Cantelupe, Bishop of Hereford in England, who, resplendent with learning, severe toward himself, to the poor however showed himself a generous benefactor&quot;.

==Legacy==
Cantilupe is still regarded by many as an exemplary bishop in both spiritual and secular affairs. These depend on the reports made at the time of his canonisation, which were unusually extensive. In these, it is said that his charities were large and his private life blameless. He is presented as constantly visiting his diocese, correcting offenders and discharging other episcopal duties. These also present his efforts on behalf of the diocese, and it is clear from other documentary evidence that he took action on behalf of his diocese, such as compelling neighbouring landholders to restore estates which he contended belonged to the see of Hereford.

The records associated with his canonisation have been the subject of academic investigation, leading to some reassessment, for instance looking at the process by which miracles were sought and attributed, to better comprehend how such reports were generated and understood at the time. Others have sought to use them to understand the medical conditions associated with reports of miraculous recoveries.

His anti-Semitism and misogyny depicted in the depositions have been highlighted by some scholars. These emphasise his direct appeals for the expulsion of the Jews, and his refusal to socialise with women, believing this to be extreme even for his time; this includes reinterpretation of objects associated with his cult, such as the &quot;Mappa Mundi&quot;.

His veneration in the Catholic church and Church of England continues. Cantilupe has been lauded as the &quot;Father of Modern Charity,&quot; and is cited as an inspiration by Mother Teresa and Melinda Gates. Books celebrating his life have been published by the Bishopric in recent years, and personal pilgrimage to his shrine is encouraged.

===In culture and society===
The Cantilupe Society was a text publication society founded in 1905 to publish the episcopal registers of the See of Hereford, of which Cantilupe&#x27;s is the earliest to survive, and other records relating to the cathedral and diocese. It fell into abeyance after 1932.

Cantilupe is referred to in Graham Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;Travels With My Aunt&quot; (1969), when the narrator&#x27;s sharp-tongued aunt opines &quot;I would have thought he was very lucky to die in Orvieto rather than in Hereford. A small civilized place even today with a far, far better climate and an excellent restaurant in the Via Garibaldi.&quot;

<doc id="1054829" wikidata="Q936128" url="?curid=1054829" title="Louis Clarke (athlete)">
<text>Louis Alfred &quot;Pinky&quot; Clarke (November 23, 1901 – February 24, 1977) was an American chemist and former sprinter and track and field athlete, who won a gold medal in the world record time of 41.0 seconds in the 4 × 100 meter relay race at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.

Clarke was Jewish. He was born in Statesville, North Carolina to Mr. and Mrs. Sol Clarke on November 23, 1901.

== College ==
After winning the AAU Junior 220-yard sprint in 1922, Clarke enrolled at Johns Hopkins University and finished second in the 100 yard and third in the 220-yard sprints at the 1923 annual IC4A (Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America). In February 1924, he posted a world record of 9.8 seconds for the 100 yard indoors and later in the year placed third on both the 100-yard and 220-yard sprints at the IC4A.

He won the NCAA championship in 1923 while a student at Johns Hopkins. 
In perhaps his most significant achievement in the Olympic year, Clarke also took the world indoor 100-yard record, at 9.8 seconds, in February 1924.

== Olympic gold medal ==

Clarke was trained for Olympic competition in May 1924 by the Olympic Coach and former American Olympic medalist Lawson Robertson at Franklin Field in Philadelphia. Robertson would later coach Jessie Owens in the 1936 Olympics. Clarke sailed for Cherbourg, France and then headed for Paris with the American Team that summer on the U.S.S America.

At the Paris Olympics that July, Clarke ran the second leg for the American 4 × 100-meter relay team, winning the gold medal in a new world record time of 41.0 seconds. Clarke had a 5-meter lead when he handed off the baton in the medal winning final, helping the U.S. Team to set the world record, in the same 41 second time they had run the semi-final. The British team finished a close second at 41.2 and included the Jewish sprinter and 100-meter champion Harold Abrahams. On their return to New York, the Olympic participants received medals from the Mayor of New York, and on their return to Baltimore, the Baltimore coaches and Olympians including Clarke marched in a parade in their Olympic uniforms and were presented medals by Baltimore&#x27;s mayor.

In early 1925, Clarke briefly coached Track and Field at the Baltimore Y.M.H.A.

After completing College, Clarke continued to compete with the Newark Athletic Club, where in 1926, he was a member of the club&#x27;s 4x100-meter team that captured the AAU National title and broke the world record (twice).

==Career after track==
In April 1946, he notified the Greenwich Draft Board of his inactive status, having served as an Officer in the armed services with a commission.

He began work with the Texaco Company shortly after college in the mid-1920&#x27;s and retired in 1966 as a chemist and patent liaison for Texaco where he had been employed for over forty years. In June 1936, he applied for and received a patent on a solvent extraction of hydrocarbon oil for which his company took full rights. In late 1963, Clarke was named Supervisor for Suggestion Activities, while serving as Senior Representative at the Texaco Research Center in Glenham, New York, a mile and a half Southeast of Fishkill.

Clarke died at Vassar Hospital, Poughkeepsie, New York, ten miles North of his home in Fishkill, New York on February 24, 1977, at the age of 75. He had been a member of the American Chemical Society. He was buried at Fishkill Rural Cemetery, and was survived by his widow Olive, a son, David who was a 1964 graduate of Dartmouth College, and two grandchildren.

==Honors==
In 1994, he was inducted into the Johns Hopkins University Athletics Hall of Fame.

<text>Lambrusco (, ) is the name of both an Italian red wine grape and a wine made principally from said grape. The grapes and the wine originate from four zones in Emilia-Romagna and one in Lombardy―principally around the central provinces of Modena, Parma, Reggio-Emilia, and Mantua. The grape has a long winemaking history, with archaeological evidence indicating that the Etruscans cultivated the vine. In Roman times Lambrusco was highly valued for its productivity and high yields, with Cato the Elder stating that produce of two-thirds of an acre could make enough wine to fill 300 amphoras.

The most highly rated of its wines are the frizzante (slightly sparkling) red wines, designed to be drunk young, from one of the eight Lambrusco &quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) regions: Colli di Parma Lambrusco, Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro, Lambrusco di Sorbara, Lambrusco Salamino di Santa Croce, Reggiano Lambrusco, Colli di Scandiano e Canossa Lambrusco, Modena Lambrusco, and Lambrusco Mantovano. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s sweet Lambrusco was the biggest selling import wine in the United States. During that time the wine was also produced in a white and rosé style made by limiting the skin contact with the must.

==Grape==
The most commonly found six Lambrusco varieties are Lambrusco Grasparossa, Lambrusco Maestri, Lambrusco Marani, Lambrusco Montericco, Lambrusco Salamino, and Lambrusco Sorbara. All of these various Lambrusco grapes are indigenous to Emilia and neither clones nor sub-clones. Most Lambruscos are made from more than one Lambrusco variety and additionally often blended with a number of specific blending grapes (max. 15%), such as Ancellotta (for color), Marzemino, Malbo Gentile, Cabernet Sauvignon (for body and structure), and others. The grape vines are often trained high above the ground to prevent the development of mildew. Historically the vines were trained to climb up poplar trees. The grape itself is not particularly sweet but many of the commercial Lambrusco versions are sweetened by either partial fermentation or with the addition of rectified concentrated grape must. When not fermented sweet, the Lambrusco grape is capable of producing an excellent dry wine with strawberry notes and a slight bitter finish.

By the end of the 20th century, ampelographers had identified over 60 varieties of Lambrusco scattered throughout Italy, including in Piedmont, Sicily and the Veneto. The most widely planted variety is Lambrusco Salamino.

==Italian wine==

Today, there are various levels of dryness / sweetness, including &quot;secco&quot; (bone dry / dry), &quot;amabile&quot; (off-dry / sweet) and &quot;dolce&quot; (very sweet). Sweet Lambrusco became hugely popular in the United States in the late 1970s–1980s, reaching a high of over 13 million cases exported to the country in 1985. The wine is noted for high acidity and berry flavours. Many of the wines now exported to the United States include a blend of Lambruscos from the different DOCs and are sold under the &quot;indicazione geografica tipica&quot; (IGT) designation &quot;Emilia&quot;.

The wine is rarely made in a &quot;champagne&quot; (&quot;metodo classico&quot;) style; instead, it is typically made using the Charmat process where a second fermentation is conducted in a pressurized tank.

===Wine regions===

*&quot;Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro&quot; – the smallest wine-producing region located south of the town of Modena. The region is home to Grasparossa of which the DOC requires 85% of the wine to be composed of lambrusco. The wine of this region is typically dry and full bodied with a deep purplish-red coloring. Grasparossa produces the most tannic Lambrusco.
*&quot;Lambrusco Mantovano&quot; – the only major Lambrusco region outside of Emilia Romagna, in the Lombardy region. This style is typically dry, but some semi-dry styles are also made.
*&quot;Lambrusco Reggiano&quot; – the largest producing region of Lambrusco and the source of most of the exported DOC designated wines. The 4 Lambrusco grapes that can be used are Maestri, Marani, Montericco, and Salamino. Up to 15% of added Ancellotta grapes are permitted in the DOC as well. The sweet versions of the wine are typically in the light bodied frizzante style while the drier wines are more full bodied and darker in color.
*&quot;Lambrusco Salamino di Santa Croce&quot; – located west of the village Sorbara, the wines of this region must be composed of at least 90% of the local Salamino. The wines are typically light in color and body with a frizzante style being both made in both semi-sweet and dry styles. The variety gets its name from the resemblance of the grape clusters to a sausage of salami.
*&quot;Lambrusco di Sorbara&quot; – located north of Modena near the village of Sorbara, Sorbara is generally regarded as the highest quality variety producing the most fragrant wines. It has some similarities to Lambrusco Salamino but produces a darker and more full-bodied wine. The color can range from a deep ruby to a purplish hue. In this wine region only Sorbara and Salamino are permitted in the DOC designated wine with at least 60% needing to be Sorbara. The Salamino and Sorbara varieties tend to produce the most acidic wines. One of the reasons why Sorbara tends to produce the highest quality Lambrusco is the tendency of the vine to drop its flowers, which reduces fruit yields and concentrates flavors.
*&quot;Casteller&quot; – in Trentino, Lambrusco is allowed as a blending grape in the red wine blends of Casteller DOC.

==Other regions==
In Australia a number of cheaper bottled and box wines are produced by Australian vineyards and sold as &quot;Lambrusco&quot;. They are typically medium-sweet, around 10% ABV and styled as an &quot;easy drinking&quot; product.

In Argentina, Lambrusco Maestri accounts for several hundred planted hectares.

<doc id="1054838" wikidata="Q273654" url="?curid=1054838" title="Olga Neuwirth">
<text>Olga Neuwirth (; born 4 August 1968) is an Austrian contemporary classical composer, visual artist and author. She is famed especially for her operas and music theater works, many of which have treated sociopolitical themes. She has emphasized an open-ended, interdisciplinary approach in her work, collaborating frequently with Elfriede Jelinek, exploiting live electronics, and incorporating video. In her opera &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, she adapted David Lynch&#x27;s surrealist film with the same name. She has also written music for historic and contemporary films. Luigi Nono has inspired her both musically and politically.

==Biography==

===Youth===
Neuwirth was born in Graz, the daughter of Griseldis Neuwirth and pianist Harald Neuwirth. She is the niece of Gösta Neuwirth and the sister of sculptor Flora Neuwirth. As a child at the age of seven, Neuwirth began lessons on the trumpet but was forced to abandon her original plans to study trumpet after an accident that left her with a jaw injury.

===Studies and formative experiences===
As a high school student, Neuwirth took part in composition workshops with Hans Werner Henze and Gerd Kühr. At the age of 16, she met writer Elfriede Jelinek, the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the two artists have since enjoyed an artistically &quot;fruitful collaboration&quot;. The then-17-year-old composer named her first commissioned composition &quot;Die gelbe Kuh tanzt Ragtime&quot;. The work was composed for the opening of the steirischer herbst festival in 1985.

In 1985/86, she studied music and art at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music with Elinor Armer. She also studied painting and film at the San Francisco Art College. She continued her studies at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna under Erich Urbanner while studying at the Institute for Composition and Electroacoustics. Her master&#x27;s thesis was written on the film score of Alain Resnais&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Amour à mort&quot;.

In 1993/94 she studied with Tristan Murail and worked at IRCAM, producing such works as &quot;...?risonanze!...&quot; for viola d&#x27;amore. She received significant inspiration in this period from Adriana Hölszky (&quot;Nicht beirren lassen! Weitermachen!&quot;) and Luigi Nono, who had similarly radical politics, and who she said was a strong influence in her life.

===Adulthood and advocacy===
Neuwirth has served as a professor at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna since 2021. She is a member of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts, the Academy of Arts (Berlin) and the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.

Neuwirth has long reflected on the everyday life of professional composers, especially women composers, who are marginalized within contemporary art circles. She has conveyed her thoughts on this issue in a number of texts. She frequently expresses herself on political issues more broadly, calling for vigilance in the face of social and political changes (for example, with a speech in front of the Vienna State Opera at a mass protest held on 19 September 2000, entitled &quot;I will not be yodeled out of existence&quot;).

==Music==

Neuwirth has created several full-length music theatre works, including the video opera &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (2003), based on David Lynch&#x27;s film; &quot;Bählamms Fest&quot; (1993/1997), drawing on the work of Leonora Carrington; &quot;The Outcast,&quot; referencing Herman Melville; and &quot;American Lulu,&quot; her free adaptation of Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot;. She collaborated with Elfriede Jelinek on the opera &quot;Bählamms Fest.&quot;

Neuwirth&#x27;s opera of David Lynch&#x27;s film &quot;Lost Highway&quot; incorporates both live and pre-recorded audio and visual feeds, alongside other electronics. Its premiere took place in Graz in 2003, performed by the Klangforum Wien with the electronics realized at the Institut für Elektronische Musik (IEM). The American premiere of the opera took place at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, and featured further performances at Columbia University&#x27;s Miller Theatre in New York City, produced by Oberlin Conservatory and the Oberlin Contemporary Music Ensemble. The surround-sound recording released by Kairos was awarded the Diapason d&#x27;Or. The UK premiere took place at the Young Vic in London in April 2008, in a co-production with the English National Opera, directed by Diane Paulus and conducted by Baldur Brönnimann.

Neuwirth&#x27;s opera &quot;Orlando&quot;, based on the novel by Virginia Woolf, is the first full-length opera composed by a woman and commissioned by the Vienna State Opera to be performed in Vienna. The world premiere took place on 8 December 2019. It was later selected as the world premiere of the year in an international critics&#x27; poll conducted by the trade journal &quot;Opernwelt&quot;.

She also has numerous chamber music works released on the Kairos label.

===Style===
Neuwirth&#x27;s original compositional style is characterized by the use of diverse compositional techniques and hybrid sound materials, with a constant questioning of artistic and sociopolitical norms. She refers to an &quot;art in-between.&quot; Stefan Drees remarked:

====Openness====
Usually assigned to the category of contemporary classical music, her works since the late 1980s have sought to transcend the genre restrictions imposed by the music business. She has drawn from a range of sources for inspiration, including &quot;art, architecture, literature and music, intellectual history, psychology, natural science, and everyday reality&quot;. Her aim has been to create works that are both distinctive and multidimensional. For example, in &quot;Le Encantadas o le avventure nel mare delle meraviglie&quot; (2014), Neuwirth has been described as creating a &quot;fictional adventure novel through multiple spatial sound effects&quot;, drawing on Herman Melville&#x27;s novella &quot;The Encantadas&quot; (1894) and Luigi Nono&#x27;s sound world, especially that of his 1984 &quot;Prometeo&quot;. The starting point of this composition is an acoustical survey (Neuwirth: &quot;preservation of acoustic heritage&quot;) of the Chiesa San Lorenzo in Venice.

In the 1990s, Neuwirth began crossing genre boundaries between theatrical drama, opera, radio drama, performance art and video. She has expressed interest in a broad spectrum of stimuli and possibilities of expression. This has been reflected in the titles of her works, for example in &quot;The Outcast&quot;, a musicstallation-theater with video.

====Innovative means====
Neuwirth often set herself the goal of breaking up established forms of concert presentation in order to arrive at a &quot;fluid form&quot;. For example, during the breaks in her two &quot;portrait concerts&quot; at the 1998 Salzburg Festival, the sound of wind-up toy instruments on a reinforced metal plate was transmitted into the concert hall&#x27;s auditorium by means of several loudspeakers, with visuals projected live onto a screen, creating an immersive listening experience. In addition, &quot;prompt texts&quot; for the audience’s behavior, written by Jelinek, were inserted into the work.

Neuwirth&#x27;s works have expanded from the concert hall into public spaces, for example in &quot;Talking Houses&quot; (1996), a sound installation for shops along the main square of Deutschlandsberg, Austria (created jointly with Hans Hoffer), and in the sound installation &quot;...le temps désechanté ... ou dialogue aux enfers&quot; (2005) at the Place Igor Stravinsky in Paris (near the &quot;Stravinsky Fountain&quot;). For this latter work, commissioned in 2005 by IRCAM Paris, a motion-capture camera was used to allow electroacoustic sounds to interact with the streams of people moving through the square. As the number of passers-by rose, a musical transformation was set in motion. However, the Paris police ultimately ordered the sound installation to be shut down.

====Interdisciplinary collaboration====
Neuwirth frequently collaborates with artists working in other disciplines or mediums, such as architect Peter Zumthor (Bregenz 2017), the New York architects of Asymptote Architecture (ZKM 2017), and the computer music and audio/acoustics research artist Markus Noisternig. She worked with video artist Tal Rosner to create the interactive installation &quot;Disenchanted Island&quot; at Centre Pompidou in Paris (2016).

She is interested in the relationship between music and visual art and has continually expanded the scope of her activities by writing texts and film scripts, producing short films, and organizing performances and photo series. In 2007, she participated in the documenta 12 contemporary art exhibition, for which she produced a sound/film installation. She recently collaborated with French installation, video, and conceptual artist Dominique Gonzales-Foerster on the multimedia installation &quot;...ce qui arrive.…&quot;

===Film scores===
Olga Neuwirth has also composed a number of film scores, including music for the silent films &quot;Symphonie diagonale&quot; (1924), &quot;Maudite soit la Guerre&quot; (1914) and &quot;City Without Jews&quot; (1924), as well as soundtracks to films by Kurt Mayer and Josef Dabernig. The composer also wrote music for the feature films &quot;Das Vaterspiel&quot; by director Michael Glawogger, which was screened at the Berlinale film festival in 2009, and &quot;Ich seh, Ich seh&quot; by directors Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, which premiered in 2014 at the Venice International Film Festival.

==Reception==

===Commissions and music residencies===
Neuwirth has received commissions from international institutions including Carnegie Hall, the Lucerne Festival, the Salzburg Festival, the Elbphilharmonie Hamburg, the Vienna State Opera and many others. She was composer in residence at the Salzburg Festival in 1999, the Koninklijk Filharmonisch Orkest van Vlaanderen in Antwerp in 2000, the Lucerne Festival in both 2002 and 2016, the Festival d&#x27;Automne in 2011, and the Elbphilharmonie Hamburg and the Wiener Konzerthaus in 2019.

===Performing relationships===
Her works have been performed by the conductors Pierre Boulez, Peter Eötvös, Daniel Harding, Matthias Pintscher, Valerij Gergjev, Susanna Mälkki, François-Xavier Roth and Alan Gilbert, among others. Leading orchestras and ensembles have included Neuwirth&#x27;s compositions in their programs, including the Vienna Philharmonic, the Berliner Philharmoniker, the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, the NDR Symphony Orchestra, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the ORF Radio Symphony Orchestra, Ensemble Intercontemporain, the Ensemble Modern, the ICE Ensemble, the Talea Ensemble, Klangforum Wien, the London Sinfonietta, Ensemble Musikfabrik, the Phace Ensemble and the Arditti Quartet.

Numerous soloists, including Hakan Hardenberger, Antoine Tamestit, Thomas Larcher, Jochen Kowalski, Robyn Schulkowsky, Marino Formenti, Claire Chase and Andrew Watts have participated in performances of Neuwirth&#x27;s works.

<text>Collins John (born 17 October 1985) is a former professional footballer who played as a striker. Born in Liberia, he represented the Netherlands national team.

John notably played in the Premier League for Fulham where he notched up 23 goals in 111 appearances, in all competitions, in a five-year stay at Craven Cottage. He also played in the English football league for Leicester City, Watford, and Barnet, in the Eredivisie for FC Twente and NEC Nijmegen, in Belgium for K.S.V. Roeselare, the United States for Chicago Fire, Azerbaijan for Gabala FC and in Iran for Mes Sarcheshmeh F.C.

==Career==

===Club===
John started his professional career at Dutch first division side FC Twente as a 17-year-old, going on to score 11 league goals during one and a half seasons combined. He was signed by Fulham on 31 January 2004, cited by manager Chris Coleman as a way to expand attacking options in the future. He signed for a fee thought to be in the region of £600,000 where he was introduced at Loftus Road by John Collins, his reverse namesake. His debut for the club came as a substitute for Mark Pembridge against Chelsea in a 2–1 defeat at Stamford Bridge on 20 March. He then scored two goals in each of his next two games against Leicester City and Blackburn Rovers.

Following an auspicious start, John scored 11 league goals in 2005–06, despite only starting 15 of the 37 in which he appeared. With a further two goals in other competitions, he was Fulham&#x27;s top goalscorer that season. A goal against Middlesbrough on 20 November 2005, a volley from his weaker foot, was later to be named &quot;Goal of the Month&quot; by the BBC, and was in the running for &quot;Goal of the Season&quot;.

John started six of the first seven Premiership games of 2006–07, but then lost his place and started only three more times in 2006. Coming on as a second-half substitute, and having had two goals disallowed earlier in the match, he scored his twentieth league goal at Manchester City, in November 2006.

John signed for Leicester City on 23 October 2007 on a three-month loan deal. He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United a few hours later, and scored his first league goal in a 2–0 win over Barnsley on 27 October.

John scored his last goal against Colchester United six days later, in a 1–1 away draw. He returned to Fulham after making a total of eleven league appearances for Leicester.

On 25 January 2008, John joined Watford on a loan deal until the end of the 2007–08 season, with the option of a permanent move after that. He struggled with his fitness during his time at the club, making only three starts and two substitute appearances. In April 2008 he returned to Fulham after tearing a thigh muscle.

On the 2008 transfer deadline day, John moved to NEC Nijmegen on a one-year loan deal, with the Dutch side also obtaining a transfer option. In Nijmegen John suffered with continual problems. Although he was important as a substitute in two UEFA Cup matches, he failed to make an impression in the Dutch league. In January 2009 he went on trial at Charlton Athletic but wasn&#x27;t offered a contract. Back in Nijmegen he was suspended to the reserve squad by manager Mario Been. On 3 March John returned to Fulham after both NEC and John didn&#x27;t see any reason for continuing the loan. In March, John requested to train with Dutch side Heracles Almelo, alongside his brother Paddy, till the end of the 2008–09 season. The request was denied because John had no intention to play for Heracles in the next season.

He chose to sign for Belgian Pro League side Roeselare signing a 2-year contract. On 3 December, John was suspended and demoted to the reserve squad for disciplinary reasons by manager Dennis van Wijk. On 14 December Roeselare terminated John&#x27;s contract.

John joined Major League Soccer club Chicago Fire during their pre-season training camp on 29 January 2010 with a view to signing before the start of the 2010 MLS season. On 11 March 2010, Chicago Fire hired him on a free transfer. After a disappointing season in MLS, John was released by Chicago on 24 November 2010.

John joined Gabala FC in Azerbaijan on 25 January 2011. After failing to revive his career in Azerbaijan, John handed in a transfer request. John went on trial with Nottingham Forest and flew to Portugal with them for a pre-season break.

He signed a one-year contract with Iran Pro League side Mes Sarcheshmeh on 20 December 2011. In the summer of 2012, John agreed to sign for Gençlik Gücü S.K. in Northern Cyprus, but the transfer fell through. On 22 September 2012, John joined League Two side Barnet.
 On 12 October 2012 John was joined at the club by fellow former Dutch international Edgar Davids. John made his debut against Plymouth Argyle, but was substituted after just 15 minutes due to a thigh injury. He also played in the FA Cup against Oxford United, but he was to make only two appearances for the club, and after a string of injuries, had his contract terminated by mutual consent in January 2013.

On 25 June 2013 John joined Eredivisie side Go Ahead Eagles on trial. After failing to win a contract with Go Ahead Eagles, John held talks with Polish Ekstraklasa side Piast Gliwice, and later claimed on Twitter that he had signed a two-year deal, but in fact was only training with the club until he had proven his fitness. He eventually made his debut in the Ekstraklasa on 1 September against Śląsk Wrocław as an 82nd-minute substitute.

In March 2014 it was announced the John had signed for the Pittsburgh Riverhounds of the USL Pro, the third division of the United States soccer pyramid. John debuted for the club in their second matchday of the season against the Richmond Kickers on 5 April 2014. After coming on as a 65th-minute substitute for Jason Johnson, John scored his first goal for the club in his debut, the Riverhounds&#x27; only goal in the 1–3 defeat. In the Riverhounds&#x27; next match, John scored again during his first game at Highmark Stadium against Wilmington Hammerheads FC, for a total of two goals in two matches. Following that match, John was suspended for three matches for &quot;violent conduct&quot;. After making thirteen appearances and scoring four goals for the Riverhounds, John and the club mutually terminated the player&#x27;s contract in July 2014, citing John&#x27;s desire to return his family to Europe.

John joined Crawley Town on trial in July 2014, scoring in a friendly against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

From the 2016–17 season, John coached the under-19 team of SC Buitenboys. He joined their first team as a player in mid-2019, competing in the Derde Klasse.

===International===
John was part of the Netherlands under-21 squad that won the 2006 European Championship in Portugal.

Previously, he had already made his main team debuts, appearing in a 2–2 friendly match against Sweden, on 18 August 2004. He then made his second appearance for the Netherlands when they played in a friendly match against Liechtenstein.

==Personal life==

<doc id="1054879" wikidata="Q816911" url="?curid=1054879" title="Benedict of Poland">
<text>Benedict of Poland (Latin: &quot;Benedictus Polonus&quot;, Polish &quot;Benedykt Polak&quot;) (c. 1200 – c. 1280) was a Polish Franciscan friar, traveler, explorer, and interpreter.

Benedict accompanied Giovanni da Pian del Carpine in his journey as delegate of Pope Innocent IV to the Great Khan Güyük of the Mongol Empire in 1245–1247. He was the author of the brief chronicle &quot;De itinere Fratrum Minorum ad Tartaros&quot; (On the Journey of the Franciscan Friars to the Tatars), not published until 1839 in France, and a year later in Poland, and the source for a longer work, &quot;Hystoria Tartarorum&quot; (History of the Tatars), discovered later and eventually published in 1965. The report of Benedict includes a copy of the letter of the Great Khan to the Pope. De Itinere Fratrum Minorum ad Tartaros, which is an account of the first expedition of Europeans to the capital of the Mongol Empire, which lasted from April 16, 1245 to November 18, 1247.

Little is known about the life of Benedict beyond the story of the journey. He may have been taken prisoner during the Mongol invasion of Poland in 1241. He was well educated and spoke and wrote Latin, Polish, and Old Rusin. He had become a friar in the Franciscan friary in Wrocław about 1236. This was the first major stop of Friar Giovanni after leaving on the mission from Lyon in April 1245. Benedict was chosen to accompany him as an interpreter because he had also acquired a knowledge of the Old East Slavic language and the first part of their journey was to Kyiv. He may have even acquired some Mongolian as a prisoner.

Benedict made his accounts of the journey during and after their return in 1247. After returning from the voyage he probably settled in the Franciscan monastery in Kraków where he spent the rest of his life. Later he was also a witness at the canonization of Saint Stanislaus of Szczepanów in 1252.

<text>Hot Space is the tenth studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 4 May 1982 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Marking a notable shift in direction from their earlier work, they employed many elements of disco, funk, R&amp;B, dance, pop and new wave music on the album. Combined with the ongoing backlash against disco music, this made the album less popular with fans who preferred the traditional rock style they had come to associate with the band. Queen&#x27;s decision to record a dance-oriented album germinated with the massive success of their 1980 hit &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; in the US.

&quot;Under Pressure&quot;, Queen&#x27;s collaboration with David Bowie, was released in 1981 and became the band&#x27;s second number one hit in the UK. Although included on &quot;Hot Space&quot;, the song was a separate project and was recorded ahead of the album, before the controversy over Queen&#x27;s new disco-influenced rock sound. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Body Language&quot;, peaked at number 11 on the US charts.

===Overview===

Before 1979, Queen had never used synthesisers on their albums. Beginning with &quot;The Game&quot;, Queen began using Oberheim OB-X synthesisers on their songs, including &quot;Play the Game&quot; and &quot;Save Me&quot;. On &quot;Hot Space&quot;, the band went even further, introducing the drum machine for the first time. A departure from their trademark 70s sound, most of &quot;Hot Space&quot; is a mixture of rhythm and blues, funk, dance and disco, while the rock songs continued in a pop rock direction similar to their previous album (an exception is the song &quot;Put Out the Fire&quot;).

During an interview in 1984, Roger Taylor affirmed that &quot;it was really John [Deacon]&quot; who turned the band towards a more disco sound. Elaborating, he said: &quot;John’s always been R&amp;B orientated, our bass player who wrote &#x27;Another One Bites The Dust&#x27;, ... which turned out to be the biggest selling record of the year. And I think that was the song that catapulted us into taking that road. I think we went too far and did too much. ... Everybody in the band feels that way now.&quot;

Disliking the new sound, Brian May and Taylor were critical of the influence that Paul Prenter, Freddie Mercury&#x27;s personal manager between 1977 and 1984, had on the singer. Recalling the recording process in 2011, Taylor openly criticized the direction in which Prenter was taking Mercury (and thus the rest of the band), stating that &quot;[Prenter] wanted our music to sound like you&#x27;d just walked in a gay club...and I didn&#x27;t&quot;. May also noted that the making of the album in Munich took much longer than usual and that all of the band got into &quot;deep emotional trouble&quot; in the city, blaming a mixture of drink, drugs and partying as the reason for the relatively lengthy recording sessions. According to Mack, Queen&#x27;s producer, Prenter loathed rock music and was in Mercury’s ear throughout the &quot;Hot Space&quot; sessions. Prenter also refused all requests from US radio stations to speak to Mercury. May states, &quot;this guy, in the course of one tour, told every record station to fuck off. But not just &quot;fuck off&quot;, but &quot;Freddie says, ‘fuck off’&quot;. Queen roadie Peter Hince wrote &quot;None of the band cared for him [Prenter], apart from Freddie&quot;, with Hince regarding Mercury&#x27;s favouring of Prenter as an act of &quot;misguided loyalty&quot;.

===Side one===
====&quot;Staying Power&quot;====
The horn arrangement for Mercury&#x27;s &quot;Staying Power&quot; was added by Arif Mardin (who also produced Chaka Khan and added horn sections to Bee Gees and Aretha Franklin records). &quot;Staying Power&quot; would be performed on the band&#x27;s accompanying Hot Space Tour, albeit much faster and heavier, with real drums replacing the drum machine and guitars and keyboards replacing the horns. (This arrangement contained no actual bass guitar, as John Deacon played guitar in addition to May.) It was also played on Queen&#x27;s The Works Tour, until it was dropped from the setlist halfway through the European leg of the tour. In Japan, the band released &quot;Staying Power&quot; as a single in July 1982. Mardin&#x27;s contributions were recorded at Record Plant Studios in New York. The original demo of the track featured a guitar instead of horns.

====&quot;Dancer&quot;====
The bassline of May&#x27;s &quot;Dancer&quot; was played on an Oberheim OB-Xa synthesiser by him. The song itself – a fusion of rock and disco – is something of a follow-up to &quot;Dragon Attack&quot; from the band&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;The Game&quot; in that it fuses heavy elements of music with danceable ones, as Led Zeppelin did. The phone message at the end of &quot;Dancer&quot; (&quot;Guten Morgen, Sie wünschten, geweckt zu werden.&quot;) is in German, and was recorded in a hotel room in Munich; it translates as &quot;Good morning, you wanted to be woken up.&quot;. The lyrics of &quot;Dancer&quot; are also notable for being the only ones on the album that make reference to the album title itself.

====&quot;Back Chat&quot;====
&quot;Back Chat&quot;, written by John Deacon, is the track most influenced by black music. In addition to normal bass duties, Deacon also plays rhythm guitar and synthesiser on the song. As the album&#x27;s final single, it stalled at number 40 on the UK charts and failed to chart in the US.

====&quot;Body Language&quot;====
&quot;Body Language&quot; is atypical among Queen songs, as there is very little guitar on the track, with the song being driven by a rhythmic bassline. Mercury, who composed the song on synth bass, had previously explored the instrument&#x27;s potential with his contributions to the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; soundtrack. The song&#x27;s lyrics describe the gay cruising culture which Mercury was immersed in at the time. The &quot;Body Language&quot; video, featuring scantily clad models writhing around each other in a bathlike setting, proved somewhat controversial and was banned in a few territories. The song also appeared in the 1984 documentary film &quot;Stripper&quot;, being performed to by one of the dancers. Whilst the video was restricted to late-night showings on MTV, it nonetheless helped the song become the album&#x27;s biggest hit in America, reaching number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June 1982.

====&quot;Action This Day&quot;====
&quot;Action This Day&quot;, one of two Taylor songs that appear on the album, was clearly influenced by the new wave movement/style current at the time; the track is driven by a pounding electronic drum machine in 2/4 time and features a saxophone solo, played by Italian session musician Dino Solera. &quot;Action This Day&quot; takes its title from a Winston Churchill catchphrase that the statesman would attach to urgent documents, and recapitulates the theme of social awareness that Taylor espoused in many of his songs. The band performed &quot;Action This Day&quot; at every show on the Hot Space Tour with a more conventional arrangement, replacing the drum machine and bass synth with a rock rhythm section and replacing the saxophone solo with an actual synthesizer. The verses are duets between Taylor and Mercury, while the chorus is sung by both.

===Side two===
====&quot;Put Out the Fire&quot;====
&quot;Put Out the Fire&quot; is an anti-firearm song written by May, featuring lead vocals and falsetto by Mercury, and backing vocals by Mercury, May and Taylor. May recorded its guitar solo under the influence of alcohol (after many unsuccessful attempts).

Though never released as a single, &quot;Put Out the Fire&quot;, the album&#x27;s most traditional Queen song, later appeared on the &quot;Queen Rocks&quot; compilation in 1997. A new video was also produced for the accompanying video compilation, featuring a live performance of the song intercut with footage of fire and explosions.

====&quot;Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)&quot;====
Mercury wrote &quot;Life Is Real&quot; as a tribute to John Lennon, whose murder in 1980 had also previously prompted the band to perform his song &quot;Imagine&quot; on tour. It is also one of the few Mercury songs whose lyrics were written before the music.

&quot;Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)&quot; was not played live on the European leg of the tour. It was only played a couple of times on the North American leg.

====&quot;Calling All Girls&quot;====
The first Queen song written by Taylor to be released as a single (albeit in selected countries, including the US and Australia, but not the UK), &quot;Calling All Girls&quot; failed to create much of an impact on the charts where it peaked at number 60 in the US and number 33 in Canada, despite its music video based on the George Lucas film &quot;THX 1138&quot;. Taylor composed &quot;Calling All Girls&quot; on guitar and played the feedback noises during the song&#x27;s break. Queen never performed the song in Europe, and a live recording from Japan in 1982 is commercially available on the &quot;Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl&quot; DVD, where &quot;Calling All Girls&quot; accompanies the photo gallery. The single was released in July 1982.

====&quot;Las Palabras de Amor (The Words of Love)&quot;====
May&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;Las Palabras de Amor&quot; were inspired by Queen&#x27;s close relationship with their Latin-American fans, and have been interpreted as an allegory for the Falklands War. A top 20 hit in the UK, &quot;Las Palabras de Amor&quot; marked the band&#x27;s fifth single to feature at least one in-studio appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the others being &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; (three performances, only partially still existing), &quot;Killer Queen&quot; (two performances, one of which only partially exists), &quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot; (two performances, with only one of them partially existing) and &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot; (one performance). For this mimed performance, May is seen playing a grand piano, although he only played synthesisers on the recording. May also sang lead vocals for the harmonised line &quot;this night and evermore&quot;.

====&quot;Cool Cat&quot;====

&quot;Cool Cat&quot;, written by Mercury and Deacon, originally featured David Bowie on backing vocals and a few lines of spoken word to a rhythm during the middle eight. According to Mercury in a 1982 TV interview, Bowie was unhappy with the results and requested that his vocals be removed days before its parent album was slated to be released. With the exception of the electric piano (which was played by Mercury), all the instruments are played by Deacon, including guitars, synths and a drum machine. On the album version, Mercury sings the entire song in falsetto. The alternate take with Bowie&#x27;s vocals still intact is widely available on various bootleg recordings and surfaces from an early 1982 vinyl &quot;Hot Space&quot; test pressing from the US. Deacon can be heard using the slap bass technique throughout the track. The song was used in 2023 in an Amazon Prime commercial featuring a young woman who, among other things, has a bobblehead of Mercury and buys a jacket on Prime similar to the one the bobblehead is wearing.

====&quot;Under Pressure&quot;====

A duet with Bowie, &quot;Under Pressure&quot; was the result of an impromptu jam session in the band&#x27;s studio in Montreux. When it was released in 1981, &quot;Under Pressure&quot; reached number one in the UK singles chart. Although it was credited to the entire band and Bowie, Mercury was the primary director of this track, with him and Bowie being the main lyricists (each writing the lines they sang). John Deacon came up with the bass riff. Part of the chord progression is based on a rough demo of an unreleased song, &quot;Feel Like&quot;. The songwriting is credited to all five participants.

==Tour==

The 1982 Hot Space Tour was Queen&#x27;s last tour of North America until the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005. The band did not tour North America for The Works tour in 1984, nor The Magic tour in 1986, after which they ceased touring, due to Mercury&#x27;s ill-health with AIDS.

==Release and reception==

Due to its dance-pop sound, &quot;Hot Space&quot; is widely considered by critics to be one of Queen&#x27;s most artistically disappointing albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said of the album that &quot;the band that once proudly proclaimed not to use synthesizers on their albums has suddenly, dramatically reversed course, devoting the entire first side of the album to robotic, new wave dance-pop, all driven by drum machines and colored by keyboards, with Brian May&#x27;s guitar coming in as flavor only on occasion.&quot; Alex Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the album two stars and said: &quot;Like Queen, disco was melodramatic, unrepentantly camp, extravagantly arranged and omnivorous in its influences. Or at least it had been. By the time of 1982&#x27;s &quot;Hot Space&quot;, disco had mutated into the weird, skeletal, dubby electronic sound pioneered by DJ Larry Levan, which really didn&#x27;t suit Queen at all.&quot; Despite this, &quot;Under Pressure&quot; remains one of the band&#x27;s staple songs.

Sandy Robertson of &quot;Sounds&quot; gave the album four stars, describing it as &quot;fairly lickable funkpop&quot; featuring &quot;&#x27;Put Out The Fire&#x27;... with, plenty screaming Brian May axe histrionics ... a ballad in the old boy&#x27;s mode called &#x27;Life Is Real&#x27; ... a candymix of phasers, acoustics and electrics in &#x27;Calling All Girls&#x27; ... sleazy keyboard/vocal pomp sobs in &#x27;Las Palabras De Amor&#x27; ... a languid summer streak and slow slide through &#x27;Cool Cat&#x27; and the cornerstone &#x27;Under Pressure&#x27; itself.&quot;

==Legacy==
Michael Jackson, who was close friends with the band during the time, later cited &quot;Hot Space&quot; as an influence for his own album &quot;Thriller&quot;.

In a 2015 interview with Greg Prato of Songfacts, Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt described how &quot;Hot Space&quot; had been an important album for him as a musician. &quot;I think it&#x27;s interesting because that album taught me two things. It taught me that even if you&#x27;re in a band as a guitar player, music doesn&#x27;t have to be driven by guitar - it&#x27;s about the song, first. But I think the main thing is that Queen actually did an album like that - it was the fans&#x27; least favorite, but it was one of my favorites because it took a risk and branched out. All those synth parts they did and horns, I could always hear them with guitar in my head somehow. But quite oddly enough, or coincidentally enough, the title &quot;Hot Space&quot; is exactly what it meant: it&#x27;s all the space between the music. That&#x27;s what makes it funky and that&#x27;s what makes it have a pocket.&quot;
In the 2011 documentary &quot;Queen: Days of our Lives&quot;, Queen&#x27;s former manager Jim Beach described &quot;Hot Space&quot; as &quot;a disaster really [...] it didn&#x27;t appeal to the hardcore Queen fans who would turn up to concerts with &#x27;Disco Sucks&#x27; banners.&quot; After the conclusion of the Hot Space tour in late 1982, the band would rarely include songs from the album in their later live set-lists with only &quot;Under Pressure&quot; remaining as a staple until their final concerts in 1986.

<text>Tomasz Radzinski (born 15 December 1973) is a former professional soccer player who played as a striker and winger. He featured for clubs including North York Rockets in Canada, Germinal Ekeren, Anderlecht (where he won the national championship twice), Lierse and Waasland-Beveren in Belgium, Everton and Fulham in England and Skoda Xanthi in Greece. Born in Poland, he represented Canada at international level having moved there as a teenager, receiving 46 full caps between 1995 and 2009.

==Club career==
Prior to his moving to Canada, Radziński began his playing career as a youth with Cuiavia Inowrocław in his native Poland, and Germany&#x27;s VfL Osnabrück. He joined the North York Rockets of the Canadian Soccer League in 1990 and remained with the club through the league&#x27;s demise in 1992 to the club&#x27;s last year, played in the National Soccer League (NSL), in 1993. He played in the summer of 1994 with the St. Catharines Wolves (of the same league which however was by then renamed to the Canadian National Soccer League).

Radziński returned to Europe, joining Germinal Ekeren in Belgium in 1994. From there he eventually signed for Belgian giants Anderlecht for whom he scored 57 goals in 90 appearances – including five UEFA Champions League strikes in his last season with the Belgian champions – before moving to Everton for around £4.5 million, the highest transfer fee paid for a Canadian up to that time.

At Everton, Radziński scored 25 times in 91 Premiership outings before requesting a transfer, eventually securing a three-year deal with Fulham F.C. worth £1.75 million. Radzinski wasn&#x27;t as prolific at Fulham as he was in his previous side, but won over the fans with several crucial goals. Radzinski was released at the end of the 2006–07 season by new manager Lawrie Sanchez, totalling 17 goals in 117 appearances.

On 28 August 2007, he signed for Greek team Skoda Xanthi, on a free transfer.

One year later, on 30 August 2008, he signed a one-year contract for Belgian Second Division club Lierse, although his previous contract was valid until 2010. Lierse first had their eye on Peter Utaka, but when he transferred to Odense, they elected to sign Radzinski. Radzinski had disclosed to the press his belief that members of Skoda Xanthi had been involved in match fixing and was seeking a transfer.

On 29 January 2012, Belgian Second Division side Waasland-Beveren announced they had signed Radzinski on a short-term deal until the end of the 2011–12 season with an option for an additional year.

==International career==
Radzinski made his debut for the Canada national team in a June 1995 friendly match against Turkey. He earned a total of 46 caps, scoring 10 goals making him tied 9th with Paul Peschisolido in all-time scoring for Canada.

In October 1999, Radzinski had been called up to the Canada national team by coach Holger Osieck, he promised to attend, failed to turn up and later refused to be interviewed about it. The Canadian Soccer Association approached FIFA to have Radzinski prevented from playing for Anderlecht as a result. Kevan Pipe, the head of the CSA called Radzinski&#x27;s actions &quot;an insult to his teammates, his coach and the country&quot;. In October 2001, he announced that he&#x27;d like to play for Canada again as they had a friendly against European opponents, Malta. He has represented Canada in 19 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. in three FIFA World Cup qualification campaigns (1998, 2006 and 2010)

He also holds a Belgian passport through his marriage.

==Post-playing career==
Radzinski was the technical director of Belgian soccer club Lierse S.K. from 2013 to 2015.

<doc id="1054902" wikidata="Q1517946" url="?curid=1054902" title="Sweetness of wine">
<text>The subjective sweetness of a wine is determined by the interaction of several factors, including the amount of sugar in the wine, but also the relative levels of alcohol, acids, and tannins. Sugars and alcohol enhance a wine&#x27;s sweetness, while acids cause sourness and bitter tannins cause bitterness. These principles are outlined in the 1987 work by Émile Peynaud, &quot;The Taste of Wine&quot;.

== History ==
&quot;Vintage: The Story of Wine&quot;, a book authored by British wine writer Hugh Johnson, presents several methods that have been used throughout history to sweeten wine. The most common way was to harvest the grapes as late as possible. This method was advocated by Virgil and Martial in Roman times. In contrast, the ancient Greeks would harvest the grapes early, to preserve some of their acidity, and then leave them in the sun for a few days to allow them to shrivel and concentrate the sugar. In Crete, a similar effect was achieved by twisting the stalks of the grape to deprive them of sap and letting them dry on the vine—a method that produced passum and the modern Italian equivalent, passito.

Stopping the fermentation also enhanced a wine&#x27;s potential sweetness. In ancient times, this was achieved by submerging the amphorae in cold water till winter.

Wine can also be sweetened by the addition of sugar in some form, after fermentation is completed – the German method like the &quot;Süssreserve&quot;. In Roman times, this was done in preparing mulsum, wine freshly sweetened with honey and flavored with spices, used as an apéritif, and also in the manufacture of conditum, which had similar ingredients but was matured and stored before drinking.
It was also common from the Roman era until quite recently to sweeten wine with &quot;sugar of lead&quot;, a toxic substance that increases the apparent sweetness of wines and other beverages. The practice continued well into the 19th century, although the leading was mostly restricted to very cheap wines after the harmful nature of lead was demonstrated in the 17th century.

==Residual sugar==
Among the components influencing how sweet a wine will taste is residual sugar. It is usually measured in grams of sugar per litre of wine, often abbreviated to g/L. Residual sugar typically refers to the sugar remaining after fermentation stops, or is stopped, but it can also result from the addition of unfermented must (a technique practiced in Germany and known as Süssreserve) or ordinary table sugar. 

Even among the driest wines, it is rare to find wines with a level of less than 1 g/L, due to the unfermentability of certain types of sugars, such as pentose. By contrast, any wine with over 45 g/L would be considered sweet, though many of the great sweet wines have levels much higher than this. For example, the great vintages of Château d&#x27;Yquem contain between 100 and 150 g/L of residual sugar. The sweetest form of the Tokaji, the Eszencia, contains over 450 g/L, with exceptional vintages registering 900 g/L. Such wines are balanced, keeping them from becoming cloyingly sweet, by carefully developed use of acidity. This means that the finest sweet wines are made with grape varieties that keep their acidity even at very high ripeness levels, such as Riesling and Chenin blanc. 

How sweet a wine will taste is also controlled by factors such as the acidity and alcohol levels, the amount of tannin present, and whether the wine is sparkling or not. A sweet wine such as a Vouvray can actually taste dry due to the high level of acidity. A dry wine can taste sweet if the alcohol level is elevated. Medium and sweet wines have a perception among many consumers of being of lower quality than dry wines. However, many of the world&#x27;s great wines, such as those from Sauternes (including Barsac) or Tokaj, have a high level of residual sugar, which is carefully balanced with additional acidity to produce a harmonious result.

== Süssreserve ==

Süssreserve (; ) is a wine term referring to a portion of selected unfermented grape must, free of microorganisms, to be added to wine as a sweetening component. This technique was developed in Germany and is used with German-style wines such as semi-sweet Riesling or Müller–Thurgau. The technique not only raises the sugar level of the wine, but also lowers the amount of alcohol. Under German law, no more than fifteen percent of the final wine&#x27;s volume may be the reserved juice. This practice is allowed also for Prädikatswein, the highest level in the German wine classification. It is often used for semi-sweet Kabinett and Spätlese, but more rarely for Auslese and upward.

The use of Süssreserve results in a different composition of sugars in the wine in comparison to residual sugar from arrested fermentation. Grape must contains mainly the sugars glucose and fructose. When wine ferments, glucose is fermented at a faster rate than fructose. Thus, arresting fermentation after a significant portion of the sugars have fermented results in a wine where the residual sugar consists mainly of fructose, while the use of Süssreserve will result in a wine where the sweetness comes from a mixture of glucose and fructose.

== Terms used to indicate sweetness of wine ==
===European Union terms for wine===
According to EU regulation 753/2002, the following terms may be used on the labels of table wines and quality wines.

===European Union terms for sparkling wine===

Sparkling wines have ratings according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 607/2009 of 14 July 2009.

Article 58 points out &quot;the sugar content may not differ by more than 3 grams per litre from what appears on the product label&quot;, so there is some leeway. For example, a sparkling wine with 9 grams per litre of residual sugar may be labelled as either the drier, less sweet, classification of &quot;Extra Brut&quot; (because 9 - 3 = 6 grams per litre), or the slightly sweeter classification of &quot;Brut&quot; or even &quot;Extra Dry/Extra Sec/Extra Seco&quot; (because 9 + 3 = 12 grams per litre).

The rules applicable to labellings before 14 July 2009 were:

==Wine-producing countries==

=== Austria ===
In Austria, the Klosterneuburger Mostwaage (KMW) scale is used. The scale is divided into Klosterneuburger Zuckergrade (°KMW), and very similar to the Oechsle scale (1 °KMW =~ 5 °Oe). However, the KMW measures the exact sugar content of the must.

===Canada===
In Canada, the wine industry measures wine sweetness as grams of sucrose in 100 grams of grape juice or grape must at 20 °C in degrees Brix.

=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===
In Czech Republic and Slovakia, the Normalizovaný Moštoměr (°NM) scale is used. The scale measures kg of sugar in 100 L of must.

=== France ===
In France, the Baumé scale is occasionally used. Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN) is French for &quot;selection of noble berries&quot; and refers to wines made from grapes affected by noble rot. SGN wines are sweet dessert wines with rich, concentrated flavours. Alsace wines were the first to be described as &quot;Sélection de Grains Nobles&quot;, with the legal definition introduced in 1984. The term is also used in some other wine regions of France, such as Loire.
=== Germany ===
In Germany, sweetness of must and wine is measured with the Oechsle scale, and below are ranges of minimum must weights for Riesling, depending on the region.

Kabinett – 67–82 °Oe

Spätlese – 76–90 °Oe

Auslese – 83–100 °Oe

<text>The postage stamps and postal history of Aitutaki describes the stamps used in Aitutaki.

== First stamps ==
Aitutaki used the postage stamps of the Cook Islands from 1892 to 1903, when New Zealand overprinted its own stamps with &quot;AITUTAKI.&quot; and the denomination written in local dialect. Seven of the eight values were issued in Auckland on 12 June 1903 and in Aitutaki 29 June, with the 2d arriving later, on 9 November. Similar sets of overprints appeared periodically from 1911 to 1920.
== Later stamps ==
In 1920, New Zealand produced an omnibus issue for the several Cook Islands, each inscribed with the island&#x27;s name. A similar idea was used for a set of three in 1924–1927.

On 15 March 1932, stamps of the Cook Islands again replaced the Aitutaki issues. This lasted for forty years.

== Separate postal service ==
In 1972, Aitutaki established a separate postal service, and has issued its own stamps (mostly printed by Heraclio Fournier in Spain) since then. These issues are primarily intended for sale to collectors.

<doc id="1054905" wikidata="Q549488" url="?curid=1054905" title="Area codes 805 and 820">
<text>Area codes 805 and 820 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the U.S. state of California. The numbering plan area (NPA) includes most or all of the counties of San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and the southernmost portions of Monterey County. 805 was split from area code 213 in 1957, and area code 820 was added to the NPA in 2018, creating an area code overlay.

==History==
Area code 805 was created in 1957, when one of the original North American area codes in California, 213, was reduced in size to provide more central office codes in the Los Angeles area.
In 1998, the California-Nevada Code Administration (CNCA) determined that California was under &quot;substantial number growth&quot; which required exhaustion mitigation in the 805 numbering plan area, by splitting the eastern part of the NPA into a new plan area with the area code 661. The split was effective on February 13, 1999, for the San Joaquin Valley, Santa Clarita Valley, and Antelope Valley.

In August 2016, the California Public Utilities Commission held a series of hearings for the decision of providing a relief area code in NPA 805 in the form of an overlay or an area code split. On May 25, 2017, the Commission approved 820 as an overlay area code. New telephone numbers of 820 area code began service in June 2018, requiring ten-digit dialing for all calls.

In addition to the municipalities below, area code 805 also serves the US military facilities in Kwajalein, Republic of the Marshall Islands with a Paso Robles prefix (805-355). This arrangement originated from the US Army&#x27;s first satellite communications station having been built at nearby Camp Roberts.

<text>Elvis Zark Hammond (born 6 October 1980) is a retired Ghanaian footballer who last played for Kingstonian as a striker.

==Club career==
Hammond was born in Accra before moving to London aged six. He was a product of the Fulham Academy, joining at under-16 level. He made his debut for Fulham on 19 September 2000 against Chesterfield in the League Cup. Hammond join Bristol Rovers on loan for the start of 2001–02 season in order to get first team experience. In July 2002, Hammond signed a one-year contract with Fulham, before signing a two-year contract with the club in May 2003. At the beginning of the following season, he spent a month on loan at Norwich City, making four league appearances during their 2003–04 season after which they were promoted to the Premier League as First Division champions. He joined RBC Roosendaal on loan in January 2005, where he scored twice in 15 matches playing in the Eredivisie – the top division of Dutch football. He then went on loan before transferring permanently to Leicester City for a fee of £250,000 in September 2005.

Hammond grabbed his first Leicester City goal in a 2–1 home defeat to QPR in September 2005. He was also on target in the 3–2 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup third round tie later that season.

On 4 June 2007, Hammond was placed on the transfer list by his then manager Martin Allen. In May 2008, Hammond was one of six players released by the club after his contract was not renewed. Hammond joined Cheltenham Town on 11 November 2008 on a short-term contract until January 2009, linking up with former manager Martin Allen. Hammond left Cheltenham Town by mutual consent in March 2010. He joined Sutton United in October 2010, scoring on his debut against Margate. Hammond would then go on to join Woking later that month, seeing out the season and signing a one-year contract in the summer of 2011. Hammond was released by Woking in May 2012, after having helped Woking to the Conference South title.

He was subsequently jailed for his role in an international money laundering scam.

== International career ==
Hammond received his first and only cap for Ghana against Mexico on 1 March 2006 in a pre-2006 FIFA World Cup friendly.

<text>During the period of the Company and Crown rule in India, the Commander-in-Chief, India (often &quot;Commander-in-Chief &quot;in&quot; or &quot;of&quot; India&quot;) was the supreme commander of the Indian Army from 1833 to 1947. The Commander-in-Chief and most of his staff were based at GHQ India, and liaised with the civilian Governor-General of India. Following the Partition of India in 1947 and the creation of the independent dominions of India and Pakistan, the post was abolished. It was briefly replaced by the position of Supreme Commander of India and Pakistan before the role was abolished in November 1948. Subsequently, the role of Commander-in-Chief was merged into the offices of the Commanders-in-Chief of the independent Indian Army and Pakistan Army, respectively, before becoming part of the office of the President of India from 1950 and of the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army from 1947.

Prior to independence, the official residence was the Flagstaff House, which later became the residence of the first Prime Minister of India; as Teen Murti Bhavan (Teen Murti House), it is now a museum.

This is a list of people who were the military Commander-in-Chief, India until 1947. The rank and title are the final ones for the officer&#x27;s career and not necessarily applicable to his tenure as Commander-in-Chief in India.

P.R. Cadell wrote an article correcting and elaborating on the early commanders-in-chief of the East India Company&#x27;s forces in the &quot;Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research&quot; in 1944.

<text>A straight-14 engine or inline-14 engine is a fourteen-cylinder piston engine with all fourteen cylinders mounted in a straight line along the crankcase. This design results in a very long engine, therefore it has only been used as marine propulsion engines in large ships.

The only straight-14 engine known to reach production is part of the Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C family of 6-cylinder to 14-cylinder two-stroke marine engines. This engine is used in the Emma Mærsk, which was the world&#x27;s largest container ship when it was built in 2006. The engine produces and displaces , has a bore of and a stroke of .

<doc id="1054916" wikidata="Q298688" url="?curid=1054916" title="AT (form factor)">
<text>In the era of IBM compatible personal computers, the AT form factor comprises the dimensions and layout (form factor) of the motherboard for the IBM AT. Baby AT motherboards are slightly smaller, measuring 8.5&quot; by 13&quot;. Like the IBM PC and IBM XT models before it, many third-party manufacturers produced motherboards compatible with the IBM AT form factor, allowing end users to upgrade their computers for faster processors. The IBM AT became a widely copied design in the booming home computer market of the 1980s. IBM clones made at the time began using AT compatible designs, contributing to its popularity. In the 1990s many computers still used AT and its variants. Since 1997, the AT form factor has been largely supplanted by ATX.

==Design==

The original AT motherboard, later known as &quot;Full AT&quot;, is , which means it will not fit in &quot;mini desktop&quot; or &quot;minitower cases&quot;. The board&#x27;s size also means that it takes up space behind the drive bays, making installation of new drives more difficult. (In IBM&#x27;s original heavy-gauge steel case, the two &quot; full-height drive bays overhang the front of the motherboard. More precisely, the left bay overhangs the motherboard, while the right bay is subdivided into two half-height bays and additionally extends downward toward the bottom of the chassis, allowing a second full-height fixed disk to be installed below a single half-height drive.)

The power connectors for AT motherboards are two nearly identical 6-pin plugs and sockets. As designed by IBM, the connectors are mechanically keyed so that each can only be inserted in its correct position, but some clone manufacturers cut costs and used unkeyed (interchangeable) connectors. Unfortunately, the two power connectors it requires are not easily distinguishable, leading many people to damage their boards when they were improperly connected; when plugged in, the two black wires on each connector must be adjacent to each other, making a row of four consecutive black wires (out of the total 12). Technicians developed mnemonic devices to help assure proper installation, including &quot;black wires together in the middle&quot; and &quot;red and red and you are dead&quot;.

==Variants==
In 1987, the Baby AT form factor was introduced, based on the motherboard found in the IBM PC/XT 286 (5162) and soon after all computer makers abandoned AT for the cheaper and smaller Baby AT form factor, using it for computers that spanned several generations, from those that used 286 processors to the P5 Pentium and a limited number of Pentium II systems. These motherboards have similar mounting hole positions and the same eight card slot locations as those with the AT form factor, but are wide and marginally shorter than full-size AT boards, with a maximum length of . However, Baby AT boards were mostly shorter than this, typically . The size and flexibility of this kind of motherboard were the key to success of this format. The development of bigger CPU coolers—and the fact that they blocked full-length PCI and ISA cards—spelled the end of Baby AT and was the main impetus for its successor ATX. While the AT standard is now considered to be mostly obsolete, some industrial computers still use it.

In 1995, Intel introduced ATX, a form factor which gradually replaced older Baby AT motherboards. During the late 1990s, a great majority of boards were either Baby AT or ATX. Many motherboard manufacturers favored Baby AT over ATX as many computer cases and power supplies in the industry were still designed for AT boards and not ATX boards. Also, the lack of an eighth slot on ATX motherboards kept it from being used in some servers. Later Baby AT boards supported both AT and ATX power connectors in addition to ATX features such as standby power (allowing for a low voltage power switch, as well as Wake-on-LAN/Wake-on-Modem Ring) and USB by use of an ATX Form Card. After the industry shifted to ATX motherboard configurations, it became common to design cases and power supplies to support both Baby AT and ATX motherboards.

== Power connector ==
The connector at the board is two Molex 15-48-0106 connectors. This mates with a Molex 90331.

<doc id="1054920" wikidata="Q284381" url="?curid=1054920" title="Four Freedoms Award">
<text>The Four Freedoms Award is an annual award presented to &quot;those men and women whose achievements have demonstrated a commitment to those principles which US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proclaimed in his to the United States Congress on January 6, 1941, as essential to democracy: &quot;freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear&quot;. The annual award is handed out in alternate years in New York City by the Roosevelt Institute to Americans and in Middelburg, Netherlands, by the Roosevelt Stichting to non-Americans.

==History==

The awards were first presented in 1982 on the centennial of President Roosevelt&#x27;s birth as well as the bicentennial of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Netherlands. The awards were founded to celebrate the Four Freedoms espoused by President Roosevelt in his speech:
#Freedom of speech
#Freedom of worship
#Freedom from want
#Freedom from fear

For each of the four freedoms an award was instituted, as well as a special Freedom medal. In 1990, 1995, 2003 and 2004 there were also special awards.

In odd years the awards are presented to American citizens or institutions by the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in New York City, though in the past the American awards were given in Hyde Park, New York. In even years the award ceremony is held in Middelburg and honors non-Americans. The choice of Middelburg was motivated by the suspected descendance of the family Roosevelt from Oud-Vossemeer in the municipality Tholen.

<text>Claus William Jensen (; born 29 April 1977) is a Danish professional football manager, and former player. During his active playing career, he played as an attacking midfielder for homeland clubs Næstved and Lyngby, as well as three other clubs in England. Jensen also made 47 appearances for the Denmark national team, in which he scored eight goals. He also represented Denmark at the 2002 World Cup and 2004 European Championship tournaments. He is the cousin of former winger Anders Due, who currently works as his assistant at Nykøbing.

==Playing career==
Jensen was born in Nykøbing Falster, and played for a number of Danish lower-league teams, making his debut for the Danish under-19 national team in November 1995. In May 1996, he was loaned out from Danish second division club Nykøbing Falster Alliancen to Næstved in the Danish Superliga. He played four games while at Næstved, but could not prevent the club from being relegated at the end of the season. He moved permanently to Superliga club Lyngby in June 1996, signing a contract alongside later Danish international Dennis Rommedahl.

He played two years at Lyngby, before moving to play in England in July 1998. He was bought by First Division club Bolton Wanderers in a deal worth 1.8 million DKK. While at Bolton, he debuted for the Danish national team in March 2000.

In July 2000, he moved to London to join promoted Premier League club Charlton Athletic for £4 million, and became a popular player with fans due to his influence during games. The Charlton fans would sing his name to the tune &quot;charge&quot; (often used during baseball matches), using Jensen for the build-up and singing his full name, Claus William Jensen, at the climax. He was called up to the Danish squad for the 2002 World Cup, where he made a single appearance as a substitute. In February 2003, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 friendly win against Egypt; one of the goals was scored from a direct free kick. He also represented Denmark at the 2004 European Championship, where he took part in three of Denmark&#x27;s four matches.

After more than 100 games for Charlton, in July 2004, he moved to the Addicks&#x27; London rivals Fulham in a deal worth £1.25 million. He made his Fulham debut at Manchester City on 14 August 2004. He spent three years with Fulham, but was plagued by injury, and on 17 May 2007, Fulham manager Lawrie Sanchez decided to release him; Jensen claims his release was inevitable because he did not fit into Sanchez&#x27;s long ball tactics. After three years with repeating injuries, he chose to end his professional career on 25 August 2007.

==Post retirement career==
In May 2015, Claus Jensen was part of a small group of investors, including TV chef Claus Meyer, comedian Mick Øgendahl and former football player Biri Biri, who bought into Nykøbing FC. At the same time, Jensen joined the board as sports director. In the summer of 2016, he stepped up and also became chairman of the club after the club was promoted to the 2016-17 Danish 1st Division.

On 7 January 2020, Jensen was appointed manager of Nykøbing; a position where he had to combine the role of sports director with the role of head coach of the club&#x27;s first team. After five years as head coach of the club, the club confirmed on 4 January 2025 that Jensen would continue in the role of Director of Football at the club from the new year.

<text>Zeshan Rehman (; born 14 October 1983) is a former professional footballer who played as a defender. He is currently first team development coach at Portsmouth FC. Born in England, he represented the Pakistan national team. He was the first British Asian to start a Premier League match and is the first to have played in all four divisions of professional football in England. He is also the first Pakistani international footballer to play professional football in England, Thailand, Hong Kong and Malaysia.

Rehman started his career at Fulham and made a total of 30 appearances, having loan spells at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Norwich City. A transfer to Queens Park Rangers followed and he went on to make 50 appearances for the club. During his three years there he went on loan to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Blackpool and Bradford City, moving permanently to the latter on a free transfer in June 2009. 

Having previously represented England at under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels, in 2005 he made his debut for Pakistan national team.

==Early life==
Rehman was born on 14 October 1983 in Birmingham. His father is Khalid Rehman. As a child in Birmingham he played for his local Sunday league team, Kingshurst. He was brought up in the Aston area of the city and often played football on the streets in addition to representing his school, his district and his county in football.

==Club career==
===Fulham===

==== Early years ====
When he was just twelve years old he was spotted by a scout, and moved with his family to London where he joined the Fulham Academy. He progressed through the junior, youth and reserve teams at Fulham, which led him to sign his first professional contract. Although a centre back by trade, Rehman was used as a holding midfielder as well as right back in his career at Fulham.

==== 2003–04 ====
In the 2003–04 season, Rehman made his professional debut on 23 September 2003 in a 1–0 defeat away to Wigan Athletic in the second round of the Football League Cup, coming on as a substitute for Junichi Inamoto after 57 minutes. Six days later, he was sent on loan to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion of the Second Division, initially for one month until November. He scored on his debut for the club on 30 September, concluding a 3–1 away win at Rushden &amp; Diamonds. On 11 October, he opened a 3–0 win against Grimsby Town at the Withdean Stadium, finishing a corner by Leon Knight in Bob Booker&#x27;s first match in charge. Rehman&#x27;s loan was extended to three months ending in January 2004. He made eleven league appearances, scoring two goals.

He made his Premier League debut for Fulham in a goalless draw at Anfield against Liverpool on 17 April 2004, replacing Bobby Petta for the final minute of the match. In doing so, he garnered media attention from British Asian groups by being the first British Asian player to play in the top division of English football. In June, Rehman signed a new contract, to keep him until 2006.

==== 2005–06 ====
On 21 September 2005 in the League Cup second round, Rehman scored his only goal for Fulham, opening a 5–4 extra-time win over Lincoln City at Craven Cottage by heading in Heiðar Helguson&#x27;s cross. In January 2006 he signed for Championship club Norwich City on loan for the rest of the season as defensive cover for the club. He made five starts for them. Having made 30 appearances in all competitions for Fulham, 26 from the starting line-up and four as a substitute, Rehman had to consider his options if he was to get regular football. Although he had two years remaining on his contract, he wanted to play regular first team football, and as a result, he decided to spend the next two seasons getting as much experience as possible.

===Queens Park Rangers===

On 8 August 2006, just prior to the start of the 2006–07 season, Rehman signed for Championship club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) from Fulham on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. In his first season at QPR, Rehman made 27 appearances.

Towards the end of the season Rehman was sent on loan to former club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion for a month where he gained more first team football experience. He made his debut on 24 March 2007 in a 0–0 draw against Huddersfield Town. He ended his loan stint by playing the full 90 minutes, and earning a yellow card in the process, for the final game of the League One season in a 1–1 draw at Cheltenham Town on 5 May 2007, claiming an assist for the opening goal. He featured in eight full games during his loan spell.

Returning to QPR at the start of the new season, chances were limited. The 3–1 victory over Leicester City on New Years Day 2008 was Rehman&#x27;s 50th game in all competitions since leaving Fulham in 2006. Rehman finished the 2007–08 season in the starting line for QPR against the Championship&#x27;s new champions, West Bromwich Albion.

====Blackpool (loan)====
Rehman joined Blackpool in a six-month loan deal on 31 July 2008, along with teammate Daniel Nardiello, who joined the club on a permanent basis, while Blackpool defender Kaspars Gorkšs moved to QPR in exchange. He made his debut for Blackpool as a second-half substitute for Jermaine Wright in a 2–0 defeat at League Two club Macclesfield Town in the first round of the 2008–09 League Cup on 12 August 2008. He was used as an emergency striker due to injuries to three of the club&#x27;s strikers. He made his league debut the following Saturday, in a 1–1 draw at Norwich City, coming on early in the second half to replace defender Danny Coid.

Three months into his loan spell, in early October, Rehman said of his move to play for Blackpool: &quot;I&#x27;m quite glad to get away from all the hustle and bustle of London. I really like it up here in Blackpool; it&#x27;s a good club with an ambitious young manager. Hopefully, over the next few months I can convince Simon Grayson I&#x27;m worthy of a long-term contract.&quot; On 31 December he returned to QPR after having made three league appearances, all of which were as a substitute.

====Bradford City (loan)====
On 26 January 2009, Rehman signed a loan deal with League Two club Bradford City, which was to last until the end of the 2008–09 season. Rehman had turned down a chance to move to Luton Town and team up with Mick Harford, who was previously the assistant manager at QPR, and said he was only prepared to drop down to League Two if he joined Bradford City. Rehman said of the move, &quot;I was only prepared to drop down the leagues to play for this club. I spoke to the manager and chairmen and I know they want to get Bradford back up to where they belong. I&#x27;ve been involved in relegation battles in the past and it&#x27;s nice to be joining a club pushing for promotion – that&#x27;s a good pressure to have.&quot; He made his debut the following day in a 1–0 defeat to Bury at Gigg Lane, and in doing so became the first British Asian to play in all four divisions of professional football in England. He made his home debut on 31 January, playing at right back, in a 2–0 home win over Grimsby Town at Valley Parade. In March he turned down the chance to play for Pakistan in the Asian Football Confederation Challenge Cup qualifiers in order to help Bradford&#x27;s push for promotion.

===Bradford City===

After leaving QPR on 19 May 2009,
Rehman signed a two-year deal with Bradford City on 19 June, saying of the move, &quot;My gut feeling told me to sign for Bradford and I&#x27;ve absolutely no regrets. From day one I felt at home here. I&#x27;m fortunate enough to have played in all the divisions and I see this as the next step of my journey.&quot; The Bradford manager, Stuart McCall also revealed that Rehman had taken a large pay cut by joining the club, adding, &quot;Zesh is certainly not signing for Bradford for money—he wants to be a success here, and it will be great to have him on board.&quot; He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw with Barnet on 19 September 2009.

Rehman captained the club during the 2009–10 season and went on to play 42 games. He won the PFA Player in the Community awards on 25 March at The Football League Awards.

At the start of the following season new manager Peter Taylor kept Rehman as club captain hailing him a &quot;supremely professional individual and a superb ambassador for the football club&quot;. Struggling to get playing time, making only 12 appearances, Rehman in an interview to &quot;BBC Radio&quot; said that he was not pleased to sit in the substitute bench in the past few matches. He also added that being the skipper of the team, his experience would help the team to perform. For making these comments, he was stripped of his captainship and put in the transfer list.

===Muangthong United===
Rehman signed a two-year deal with Thai Premier League side Muangthong United on 19 December 2010. He made his debut on 30 January 2011, in the King&#x27;s Trophy against Chonburi Sharks at the Suphachalasai Stadium; his new side lost 2–1. His appearance made him the first Pakistan international to play in Thailand. About his debut Rehman commented &quot;I can honestly say I loved the experience. The passion from the 40,000 fans in the crowd made it a day to remember&quot;. During his stint in the club, it was managed by English striker Robbie Fowler. He made a total of thirty league appearances for the Thai club.

===Kitchee===
Rehman signed a deal with Hong Kong First Division League side Kitchee on 11 January 2012. He made his debut in a 2–1 win over Sun Hei on 31 January. Rehman scored his first goal for his new club in the AFC Cup against Sông Lam Nghệ An of Vietnam. Rehman won his first piece of silverware of his Hong Kong career by playing a leading role in Kitchees 2–1 League Cup win over cloes rivals TSW Pegasus at the Mong Kok Stadium on 15 April 2012. Rehman helped Kitchee retain the Hong Kong First Division League title with a 4–1 victory over Biu Chun Rangers in the last league game to clinch the title, it was his second trophy for the club and it put them in pole position to complete the domestic treble in Hong Kong Rehman and Kitchee finished the season in impressive fashion by overcoming Pegasus after penalties to win Hong Kong FA Cup Final at The Hong Kong Stadium. The victory was a historic moment for the club as Kitchee were crowned domestic treble winners, a feat that has never been matched by a Hong Kong club. Rehman made it into the Hong Kong BMA First Division League team of the season at The HKFA Annual Awards dinner. Rehman also achieved the feat of becoming the first Pakistani player to play in AFC Cup.

On 29 August 2012 Rehman played the full game in a pre-season friendly against Premier League giants Arsenal in front of a 40,000 crowd as the Hong Kong Champions drew 2–2 with the Gunners at The Hong Kong Stadium. On 11 May 2013 Rehman won the Hong Kong FA Cup through a 1–0 victory over last year finalist Sun Pegasus FC. On 26 May 2013 Rehman helped Kitchee beat Tuen Mun 3–0 in the final of the play-off to ensure his teams passage into the AFC Cup 2014. Rehman played fifteen league games for the club during the 2012/13 season, which was followed by six appearances in the next season.

===Pahang FA===
In December 2013, Rehman signed for Malaysian club Pahang FA on a two-year contract. His former club Kitchee&#x27;s president Ken Ng commented &quot;Zesh has contributed hugely to Kitchee&#x27;s success over the last 2 years and he will be truly missed&quot;. His new club&#x27;s manager Zainal Abidin Hassan said that they were &quot;delighted&quot; as he &quot;has chosen to come to Pahang ahead of several other teams.&quot; He justified his reason of joining the club as &quot;his destiny&quot;. In his first season with the club, he won three trophies – Malaysia FA Cup, Malaysia Cup and Piala Sumbangsih thus winning qualification to the 2015 AFC Cup. In the cup, he played six times without scoring a goal.

On 28 June 2016, Zesh announce via his social media accounts he had amicably agreed to terminate with Pahang FC after a successful 3-year spell at the club. Zesh said, &quot;I would love a future return in a coaching role, something which was offered to me at the start of this season but was not the right moment for me. I will be back to visit my sons birthplace of Kuantan. Pahang have the best fans in Malaysia &amp; are by far the best I have played for. Leaving here on excellent terms with the hierarchy, fantastic memories &amp; many formed friendships. Good luck to all the staff &amp; team for the rest of the season. Thank you&quot;.

===Gillingham===

On 23 February 2017, Rehman returned to English football by joining League One side Gillingham until the end of the 2016-17 season. Rehman made his debut for the club in a 2–1 Victory over Southend, drawing praise from manager Adrian Pennock for his performance and leadership after helping Gillingham avoid relegation from League One on the final day of the season with a 0-0 draw at Northampton.

===Southern===
On 14 June 2017, Rehman announced via his Twitter page that he had signed with Southern, returning to Hong Kong for the first time since 2013.
Rehman chose Southern ahead of several other offers from around the world, citing the lure of working with head coach Cheng Siu Chung as the main attraction.

On 28 April 2020, Southern announced an agreement with Rehman to extend his contract.

==Coaching career==

===Southern===

On 16 May 2020, towards the end of the 2019-20 season when COVID started Rehman was named as a player-manager for Southern, achieving his first coaching role since obtaining his UEFA Pro License. He spent two seasons prior to this operating as a development coach working closely with the club&#x27;s emerging youth prospects that won the U18 League and FA Youth Cup.

On 30 May 2021, Rehman completed his first full season as player head coach leading Southern to a 5th place mid-table finish, a remarkable achievement in the duo role while operating on the lowest budget in the league, working with the youngest coaching team and himself being the youngest head coach in the Hong Kong Premier League.

In January 2022, at the halfway point of the new season, Rehman guided Southern to the top of the league with the second-highest number of goals scored, the best defensive record in the league, and the most clean sheets beating Asian Champions league side Kitchee and last years league runners up Eastern along the way. Southern was also in the top three of the Sapling Cup League.

In May 2022 Rehman announced his retirement, and called time on a 21 year playing career which spanned two decades across several countries. He described his time as an amazing experience both on and off the pitch.

===Portsmouth===
Having finished his playing career, in June 2022 Rehman took a role with Portsmouth FC as U18 Coach.

In January 2023, after the dismissal of Danny Cowley and Nicky Cowley as head coach and assistant head coach, Rehman became interim first team assistant manager.

Rehman remained in the interim assistant head coach role after the appointment of John Mousinho as the new head coach.

The pairs first game in charge resulted in a 2-0 home win against visitors Exeter City on Saturday 21 January 2023, their first EFL League One home win since 3 September 2022. Three days later on 24 January 2023, Portsmouth travelled to Fleetwood Town and defeated them 0-2, their first EFL League One away win since 22 October 2022.

On March 23, 2023 Rehman was announced as the First Team Development Coach. During the season, Rehman became the first British Pakistani former player to be working as a coach within a first-team set-up across the English professional leagues.

==International career==
Rehman originally represented England, and played for them at under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels. Becoming the first English-born Pakistani to don an England senior football shirt seemed too far away, however, due to lack of first team opportunities at Fulham. Due to his Pakistani parentage, and because he possessed dual Pakistani and British nationality, Rehman also qualified to represent Pakistan, and he eventually opted to play for them, as he considered it to be a more realistic option. A lot of British Asian groups were against this and wanted him to fight more for an England place to set a standard for English-Asian youth.

It was, however, an unrealistic aspiration. With that in mind, and with the blessings of his father, Rehman was approached by Malik Riaz Hai Naveed, a young football manager and made his international debut for Pakistan in a 1–0 win over Sri Lanka in the 2005 South Asian Football Federation Championship on 7 December 2005 at the Peoples Football Stadium in Karachi. Pakistan ultimately reached the semi-finals before losing out to Bangladesh 1–0.

Rehman was named in the Pakistan squad for the 2010 World Cup qualifying matches against Iraq in October 2007, and played the match in Lahore but could not help contain Asian champions Iraq from winning 7–0. In the second leg on 28 October he captained Pakistan to a 0–0 draw. However, he also had to withdraw from the squad for the SAFF Championship 2008 when he came down with food poisoning. After nearly four years out, Rehman returned to the Pakistan team for the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers.

=== 2013–19 ===
In September 2013 Rehman represented Pakistan at the SAFF Championship which was held in Nepal. He played all of the games for Pakistan who narrowly missed out on a semi-final spot despite beating Bangladesh in the last group game. His commanding displays during the tournament earned him a place in the Team of the Tournament. In October 2013, Rehman captained Pakistan in both of their games at The Peace Cup held in the Philippines, and scored the winning goal in the opener against Chinese Taipei.

In September 2018 played in his final SAFF Tournament for Pakistan in Bangladesh since his first game in the competition some 13 years earlier. He played all of the games helping the team progress to the semi-final stage of the competition against rivals India.

In June 2019 Zesh Captained the team for the 2022 Asian World Cup Qualifiers against Cambodia over two legs. Pakistan fell short of a place in the group stage of the competition with consecutive defeats in Phnom Penh and in Doha, this was his final game in an international shirt.

=== Controversy ===
Rehman caused controversy in 2007 when in an interview with the British weekly newspaper the &quot;Eastern Eye&quot; he said that players of Asian descent should consider sticking to their roots rather than dreaming of playing for England. Rehman pointed to Michael Chopra and David Nugent, who both were top scorers in the Championship, but Nugent was called up for England while Chopra was not.

==Personal life==
Rehman has said that, his &quot;sole purpose in trying to be a success as a professional footballer is to inspire other Asian players to follow my lead and achieve their goals.&quot; He is an ambassador for the Asian Football Network (AFN), a grassroots community-led initiative designed to support and facilitate the development of grassroots Asian football in the UK. He has also worked with the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA) to try to increase the number of British Asians taking up a career in professional football, and has attended meetings with the PFA in order to achieve this goal. He has also been involved in the Show Racism the Red Card campaign and he has taken part in Chelsea&#x27;s &quot;Search for an Asian Star&quot; campaign. On 12 July 2008, he took part in the Islam Expo event at the Olympia exhibition centre in West Kensington, London, a four-day event whose primary purpose was to build bridges between Britain&#x27;s Muslim communities and the rest of society. Rehman took part in a panel giving feedback from his own experiences about the positive use of sport.

In April 2008, Rehman appeared on the United States-based Afghan satellite television network Noor TV and Bangladesh-based Islamic TV discussing being a Muslim footballer and how it is possible to pursue a career in football while sticking to Islamic roots. On 20 April 2008, he was a guest on the BBC Asian Network radio station show &quot;Breakdown&quot; revealing his favourite Desi music tunes. In May 2008, Rehman was awarded the &quot;Community Commitment Award&quot; at QPR. In April 2008, Rehman took part in a radio documentary on BBC Radio 1Xtra about British Asians in football which followed his &quot;journey from playground to Premier League&quot;.

In May 2010, he launched The Zesh Rehman Foundation at Valley Parade to encourage children from all backgrounds to participate in football and sport to better themselves. He was named as one of the 50 World Cup Bid Ambassadors for The FA&#x27;s World Cup 2018 bid, entered the Show Racism Red Card Hall of Fame, and was invited onto the PFA management committee by Gordon Taylor.

In 2014, he was named as on the special South East Asia contributor for the ESPN South East Asia section by writing blogs and columns about football in the rapidly growing football region of Asia. Rehman wrote his second blog for the ESPN South East Asia section a few days after his side recorded victory in the Malaysia Cup quarter-finals.

<doc id="1054938" wikidata="Q3150251" url="?curid=1054938" title="Area code 650">
<text>Area code 650 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the San Francisco Bay Area in the U.S. state of California. It was split from area code 415 on August 2, 1997, and includes most of San Mateo County (except the northernmost portion), part of San Francisco, and the northwestern portion of Santa Clara County including Palo Alto, Mountain View, and Los Altos.

Prior to October 2021, area code 650 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, &quot;988&quot; was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing. This area code was therefore scheduled to transition to ten-digit dialing by October 24, 2021.

<doc id="1054939" wikidata="Q5595982" url="?curid=1054939" title="Granmar">
<text>Granmar was a king of Södermanland, in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s Heimskringla. The same king also appears in the Volsunga saga.

Granmar was married to Hilda, the daughter of the Geatish king Högne of East Götaland, and his son-in-law was the seaking Hjörvard of the Ylfings as he was married to Hildagun. These three kings defended themselves against the Swedish king Ingjald Ill-ruler.

According to the Heimskringla, he had no sons, but the legends of Helgi Hundingsbane relate that he had the sons Hothbrodd, Gudmund and Starkad who were slain by Helgi.

Snorri relates that when the Swedish king Ingjald ill-ruler invited seven petty kings in order to burn them all to death inside his hall, Granmar did not arrive and so he escaped being murdered.

The same summer, the Sea-king Hjörvard of the Ylfings arrived at &quot;Myrkva Fjord&quot; (Mörköfjärden, an inlet that is still used to pass between Mälaren and the Baltic Sea and divides Södermanland in two parts). Hjörvard was invited to a feast with Granmar and he agreed as he had never pillaged in the area before. He was gladly welcomed and the kings sat with one woman each as was the custom, while the others formed a single group. Hjörvard&#x27;s Vikings did not like that as it was their law that everyone at a feast should drink together. Hjörvard then sat in a high seat opposing Granmar and his men sat on the same bench as him.
Granmar&#x27;s daughter Hildigunn, who was very beautiful, was told by her father to serve beer to the men. She took a silver goblet, filled it and bowed to Hjörvard, telling him &quot;success to all Ylfings, this cup is to the memory of Hrólf Kraki&quot; drank half of it and offered the rest to Hjörvard. He drank it, took her hand and asked her to sit beside him. She answered that it was not Viking custom, but he asked her not to mind. This evening they drank and talked a great deal with each other, and the next day, as he was leaving, Hjörvard asked for her hand. Granmar asked his wife, Queen Hilda and the people he respected, telling them to trust Hjörvard. They all agreed. There was a wedding and as Granmar had no sons, Hjörvard stayed to help Granmar defend his kingdom.
In the autumn, Ingjald assembled his forces in order to attack Södermanland. However, when Granmar and Hjörvard heard this they did the same thing and allied with Granmar&#x27;s father-in-law Högne, the king of East Götaland, and his son Hildur.

Ingjald invaded Södermanland with superior forces, and a battle commenced. After some ferocious fighting, the chiefs of Fjärdhundraland, West Götaland, Nerike and Attundaland began to flee from the battle in their ships. Ingjald was severely wounded and Svipdag the Blind and his sons Gautvid and Hylvid fell. Ingjald retreated and returned to Uppsala and realised that the forces he had gained from the conquered petty kingdoms were not faithful to him.

After a long standstill, some friends of both sides wanted to bring about a reconciliation. Ingjald had a meeting with Granmar and Hjörvard and they decided to have peace for as long as the three men lived. The following spring, Granmar was travelling to Uppsala to confirm the peace between him and Ingjald, but he realised that Ingjald had not promised him a long life and so he returned.

The next autumn, King Granmar and Hjörvard were at a feast in one of their farms on the island Selaön. During the night, they were surrounded by Ingjald and his men and the hall was set on fire burning everyone inside to death. Ingjald then installed chiefs to rule Södermanland.

King Högne of East Götaland and his son Hildur often made raids into the Swedish provinces killing many of Ingjald&#x27;s men. Högne defended his kingdom successfully until he died.

King Hogne was reported to be killed with a son Bragi by Helgi the Ylfing from the legends of Helgi Hundingsbane and his daughter taken by Helgi as a wife. The sons of Granmer unnamed by Snorri were also killed by Helgi as Snorri relates he only had a daughter. This could be true if they were killed before Hildagun married Hjörvard the Ylfing. This suggests he was involved in a civil war with Hogne, Granmer, and Hjörvard, and him possibly being allied with Ingjald who was reported to kill Granmer and Hjörvard. Helgi was later killed by Dag another son of Hogne unnamed by Snorri.

Dag could be Hildur as Bragi was killed by Helgi, this is unclear. More unclear is Hothbrod trying to marry Sigrun daughter of Hogne, as Granmer was married to Hilda daughter of Hogne. This would make Sigrun his aunt. More likely, Helgi killed Granmers sons as rivals to his own claim and possibly took his wife Hilda Ylfing as a price after the death of Granmer and Hjörvard by his ally Injald. This would mean Sigrun was the same person as Helgi and at least makes sense. What is known for sure is that Hjörmund reclaimed the throne later. Sögubrot relates that Ivar Vidfamne gave the East Geatish throne to Hjörmund, the son of Hjörvard, after Ingjald&#x27;s death since it had been the kingdom of Hjörmund&#x27;s father Hjörvard. Ivar Vidfamne was supposedly great grandson of Valder himself a son of Hrothgar and his Ulfing wife Wealhþēow. Making Hjörmund his kin and Ivar Vidfamne indebted to the Ulfings for protecting Hrothgars kingly line.</text><links>

<text>O&#x27;Briens Irish Sandwich Cafe, also known as O&#x27;Briens, is an Irish franchise sandwich cafe chain founded in Ireland in 1988 by Brody Sweeney. As of October 2009, O&#x27;Briens was operated by the AIL Group, who owns Abrakebabra.

==Foundations==
In 1988, Irish businessman, Brody Sweeney set up his first sandwich shop in Dublin. Sweeney reportedly chose the name O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s because it was the most common name in the phone book and he wanted a very common Irish surname in the event of expansion overseas.

In 2009, the company went into liquidation and was purchased by Abrakebabra Investments Limited.

Initially operating only in Ireland, the chain once operated sandwich bars in Australia, China, Gibraltar, Indonesia, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

<text>Michael Anthony Timlin (born 19 March 1985) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for National League South club Dulwich Hamlet.

Born in Lambeth, England, Timlin graduated through the Fulham Academy, making his debut in a League Cup game in 2004. During this time he spent time on loan at Scunthorpe United, Doncaster Rovers and Swindon Town before joining Swindon permanently in 2008. In 2010, he moved to Southend United on loan, reuniting him with former Southend manager Paul Sturrock again having previously played under him at Swindon. In January 2012, Timlin made a permanent transfer to Southend United, after his second loan spell with them had ended. He helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2014–15. The midfielder signed for Stevenage in June 2018 and played an integral part during their 2018/2019 season. Timlin was out of contract the following summer and, for personal reasons, decided not to agree to an extension. Subsequently, Timlin re-signed for the club in September 2019 on a short-term contract playing under a different manager to his previous spell. In January 2020, Timlin signed for Ebbsfleet United however due to a transfer embargo in place on the club at the time, he was unable to make his debut until mid-February. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the National League season was curtailed in April with Timlin having made just 4 league appearances. In August 2020 it was announced the midfielder had joined Dulwich Hamlet in a role combining playing for the first team and coaching in the academy.

Timlin has played internationally for the Republic of Ireland eight times at under-21 level.

==Club career==

===Fulham===
Timlin joined the Fulham Academy at a young age and, with first team appearances being limited, he spent loan spells at Scunthorpe United, Doncaster Rovers and Swindon Town. After making his debut in a League Cup match against Boston United in 2004, Timlin only played a few competitive games (four in total). At the end of the 2007/2008 season Timlin agreed a permanent move to Swindon Town.

That debut season was otherwise one of frustration, as injuries to the back and metatarsal ruled the Irishman out for long periods. Having initially played as a winger while at the Fulham Academy, he has now matured into a central midfielder.

Timlin also captained the Ireland U-21s to victory in the 2006 Madeira Cup.

===Swindon Town===
In November 2006, he joined League Two promotion chasers Swindon Town. He made his debut for Swindon against Bury on 25 November. He scored his first goal for Swindon at home to Notts County, which earned them a point. Timlin&#x27;s performances saw Paul Sturrock attempt to extend the loan deal. Chris Coleman agreed to the extension on the terms that Timlin extended his full contract with Fulham.

On 13 March 2008, Timlin rejoined Swindon on loan for the remainder of the season, making 10 appearances. On 3 May, hours after the conclusion of the 2007–08 League One season, it was announced that he had joined Swindon on a permanent two-year deal. He officially joined his new club on 1 July 2008. Ahead of the 2008–09 season, Timlin was given the number 4 shirt.

Timlin began the 2008/2009 season in his preferred central midfield role. However, Maurice Malpas took Timlin out for the visit of Leeds United, and on his return to the squad a week later, he appeared on the left side of midfield. Towards the end of October, when Malpas&#x27; defensive-minded approach hadn&#x27;t appeared to work, Timlin was moved to yet another new position on the left side of the defence to fill the gap of injured Jamie Vincent. Adapting well, Timlin also stood in as captain in the absence of Hasney Aljofree. Maurice Malpas was sacked in November, and Timlin moved back to central midfield under caretaker manager David Byrne.

As Danny Wilson took charge, Timlin was playing at left side of defence again, but after Wilson&#x27;s first game in charge, Timlin was moved to the left side of midfield and then back to central midfield. Timlin was ever-present in the centre of midfield for the remainder of the season, only missing two games through suspension. The 2009–10 season was frustrating for Timlin as he spent most of the season on the bench, during which time the club was making their attempt to reach the Championship, losing out to Millwall in the Playoff Final at Wembley. Despite a lack of first opportunities, Timlin signed a new one-year deal after being offered a new contract.

At the start of the 2010–11 season, Timlin appeared on the bench for a number of games before joining Southend United on loan. Upon his return from a loan spell with Southend United, Timlin made his first appearance since September, when Swindon Town played Brentford in the quarter final of Southern Section.

Timlin signed a two-year contract extension with Swindon on 23 June 2011. stating that he had never considered leaving the Robins despite recurring interest from Southend United. Ahead of the 2011–12 season, Timlin praised newly manager Paolo Di Canio for his influence. Despite signing the contract extension, Timlin re-joined Southend on loan again at the end of August 2011 which resulted in a permanent switch in January 2012.

===Southend United===
On 15 September 2010, Timlin joined League Two side Southend United on a one-month loan. Timlin made his debut on 25 September 2010, scoring his first goal from a 30-yard free-kick in a 3–1 win over Hereford United. Timlin made an impressive performance for Southend United and expressed an interest to extend his loan spell. Swindon Town initially agreed but later changed their mind and recalled him back to the club.

On 31 August 2011, Timlin re-joined Southend United on loan for a second spell, this time on a 4-month contract. His last match on loan to Southend was on Monday 2 January 2012 against Dagenham and Redbridge. In the evening of Thursday 5 January, three days after his loan spell came to an end, it was confirmed that he would be moving to Southend United permanently for an &#x27;undisclosed fee&#x27;

On 5 February 2013, in a match against Leyton Orient, Timlin suffered a broken leg and was out of action for 8–9 months. He then missed the second leg of that game, the JPT Area Final, and the subsequent Wembley final. It was hoped that he would be back for the start of the next season 2013–14. Despite the injury, Timlin was offered, and signed, a new 2-year contract. He made his return from injury after appearing on the bench for three matches, when he came on as a substitute in the 83rd minute, in a 2–1 loss against Chesterfield on 24 August 2013. At the end of the 2014–15 season he played for Southend in the League Two play-off final against Wycombe Wanderers. Southend won in a penalty shoot-out and were promoted to League One.

On 2 July 2015 Timlin signed a new 2-year contract at Southend and then a further year extension which saw him contracted until May 2018.

At the end of the 2017/2018 season, Timlin held positive talks about a contract extension at Southend United but a change in circumstances at the club unfortunately resulted in him being released much to his disappointment and that of the clubs supporters with whom he was a fans favourite. Timlin went on to sign for Stevenage in June 2018.

===Stevenage===
Timlin signed for League Two club Stevenage on a free transfer on 11 June 2018. He made his Stevenage debut in the club&#x27;s opening game of the 2018–19 season, playing the first 64 minutes in a 2–2 draw against Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way. Timlin scored his first goal for the club, which turned out to be his only goal for the club,&lt;ref name=&quot;Games played by Michael Timlin in 2018/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in Stevenage&#x27;s 1–0 victory over Morecambe on 18 August 2018. He played regularly throughout the season in the centre of midfield, making 46 appearances in all competitions. Timlin was released by Stevenage at the end of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevenage retained / released list&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Timlin re-joined Stevenage on 20 September 2019 on a short-term contract. The club stated Timlin had previously chosen not to agree a new contract in the summer for personal reasons.

Stevenage confirmed in January 2020 that Timlin had left the club having been unable to agree terms on a new contract.

===Ebbsfleet United===
On 21 January 2020, Timlin signed for Ebbsfleet United however due to a transfer embargo in place on the club at the time, he was unable to make his debut until mid-February. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the National League season was suspended and subsequently curtailed in April with Timlin having made just 4 league appearances. Whilst positive talks were held about Timlin remaining at Ebbsfleet, he explained during the summer that he had received an offer he just could not turn down which meant he would not be extending his time at the club. He said that had it not been for this specific offer, he would definitely have loved to remain at Ebbsfleet and finish his playing career with them.

===Dulwich Hamlet===
After a brief spell playing at Ebbsfleet United, cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, Timlin agreed to sign for Dulwich Hamlet in August 2020 in a role that would allow him to continue playing and also continue his coaching ambitions working within their Academy. Timlin is keen to pass on his experience to the next generation of players and is working towards becoming a UEFA licensed coach. The midfielder explained, when signing for the club, that the opportunity to play for the team in the area he grew up in and work under good friends and mentors Gavin Rose and Junior Kadi, was just too good a chance to turn down.

==Personal life==
On 5 June 2013, Timlin was sentenced to an 84-day prison sentence for perverting the course of justice in regards to traffic offences, although he was told he would only serve half. He was also given an £80 fine and four points on his driving license. On 17 July, Timlin was released from prison having served his 42 days. He linked up with the Southend squad to continue his rehabilitation on his broken leg and opened talks with manager Phil Brown about a new contract

<text>Tytus Aureliusz Chałubiński (29 December 1820, Radom – 4 November 1889, Zakopane) was a Polish physician, naturalist, and co-founder of the Polish Tatra Society. His collections of natural history specimens are now held in the Tatra Mountains Museum in Zakopane.

== Life and work ==
Chałubiński was born in Radom (some biographers give it as Bialograj where his grandfather lived), son of judge Szymon. His mother Theodosia came from the Wnorowski family of nobles. He studied medicine at Vilnius from 1838, the medical school there had been founded by Jedrzej Sniadecki (1768-1838) and his writings on physiological chemistry would have been an influence. The school was closed in 1840 and in the same year his mother lost all her wealth and she committed suicide. He moved to Dorpat wrote his thesis on sexual reproduction in plants and completed his medical studies at the University of Würzburg. He returned to Warsaw and practiced at the clinic of the Evangelic Hospital under Ferdynand Dworzaczek (1804-1877) whose clinical techniques were another influence. Chałubiński&#x27;s practice was disturbed during the Polish insurrection of 1863 and ended with Russification in 1873. He then spent time on botany and mineralogy spending time in the Tatra mountains. He helped in promoting the Zakopane region. He collected numerous specimens of mosses, algae, and other plants.

In 1874 he published a book on identifying therapeutic indications. He considered disease to be a disturbance in the normal equilibrium and sough a holistic approach to treatment and health. He considered each patient to be unique and suggested that a physician needs to deal with symptoms carefully dealing with multiple symptoms starting with the most important one first. 

Chałubiński established tuberculosis sanatoria in Zakopane, in the Tatra Mountains. He was a professor at the Medical-Surgical Academy and Principal School in Warsaw.

== Personal life ==
Chałubiński&#x27;s son was Ludwik Chałubiński, a Polish alpinist and chemical engineer. His granddaughter was Aniela Chałubińska was a Polish geographer, geologist and university professor.

<text>Postage stamps and postal history of the [[Azores]] surveys the postal history of the Portuguese archipelago, situated in the north Atlantic.
==Early history==
The first stamps used in the Azores were Portuguese stamps issued in 1853 depicting the effigy of Queen D. Maria II, which were designed by Francisco de Borja Freire and printed by the &quot;Casa da Moeda&quot;. The stamps were inspired by English stamps issued between 1847 and 1848, presenting a bust of the Queen (similar to coin minted in the period) and printed one-by-one in sheets of 24 examples, without perforations and arranged irregularly. The first two stamps (that began circulating on 1 July 1853) had a facial cost of 5 and 25 réis. The following day, issues of 100 réis, and on 22 July 1853, 50 réis were available. Portugal was the 45th nation to adopt the use of postage stamp.

In the Azores, then known as the &quot;Ilhas Adjacentes&quot; (&quot;Adjacent Islands&quot;), stamps were cancelled with circular postmark between 1853 and 1869 (referred to as the First Reform) that included numerals corresponding to the localities: 
* 48 – Angra do Heroísmo (Terceira)
* 49 – Horta (Fayal)
* 50 – Ponta Delgada (São Miguel)
Between 1869 and 1878 oval postmarks began to be used (the Second Postal Reform), with new postal designations:
* 42 – Angra do Heroísmo (Terceira)
* 43 – Horta (Faial)
* 44 – Ponta Delgada (São Miguel)

== Stamp issues ==

The first stamps for the Azores appeared in 1868, and continued until 1930. Nearly all of the stamps issued in the Azores were Portuguese stamps overprinted with &quot;AÇORES&quot;. The exceptions were the 1898 Vasco da Gama commemorative issue, the 1906 King Carlos issue, and the 1910 King Manuel issue (including revolutionary overprints on the Manuel issue). After 1930, Portuguese stamps were used in the Azores. 
=== District issues ===
Between 1892 and 1906, the three administrative districts of the Azores had stamps issued inscribed with their names: Angra, Horta and Ponta Delgada. The designs were identical to those of the regular Portuguese stamps (which were inscribed &quot;CONTINENTE&quot;), with the colors generally the same, although some were lighter or darker.
== Modern issues ==
On 2 January 1980, the use of separate stamps for the Azores (and Madeira) were revived. The modern stamps are inscribed both &quot;PORTUGAL&quot; and &quot;AÇORES&quot;.

Personalized and regional stamps began to be issued from 2008 by the Portuguese postal service. These stamps have no special purpose beyond the expression of local pride; all are sold and valid in Portugal. About 5–10 are issued each year, generally with themes relating to the Azores.

<doc id="1054952" wikidata="Q2298554" url="?curid=1054952" title="Alain Goma">
<text>Alain Goma (born 5 October 1972) is a French former professional footballer who played as a right back or a central defender. In a 16-year professional career he appeared in 196 Ligue 1 games, mostly for Auxerre. He then played 147 matches in the Premier League, with Newcastle and Fulham.

==Club career==
Born in Sault, Vaucluse, Goma started his football career playing for Paris-suburb club Versailles, joining Auxerre&#x27;s famed youth academy in 1988 at the age of 15. Three years later, he made his Ligue 1 debut for the team led by legendary Guy Roux.

In 1992–93, Goma took part in Auxerre&#x27;s unprecedented semifinal run in the UEFA Cup, where they lost in the semi-finals to Ajax in a penalty shootout. At the end of the season, he signed his very first professional contract, going on to be instrumental in the side&#x27;s 1996 double while also helping them to the 1996–97 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals – losing to eventual winners Borussia Dortmund – after winning the group stage over Ajax.

After ten years at Auxerre, Goma moved to Paris Saint-Germain, conquering the 1998 Trophée des Champions soon after signing. After that single campaign, he joined Newcastle United for £4.7 million, becoming an important player at the start of 2000–01 and scoring in a 3–1 win against Middlesbrough in October 2000.

On 13 March 2001, following a dispute with the Magpies, Goma signed with First Division leaders Fulham, who paid a club record £4 million for his services. On 21 April 2001 he made his debut in a 1–1 draw at Portsmouth, and became a vital player for the club in its debut season in the Premier League, eventually serving as captain under countryman Jean Tigana.

Goma&#x27;s form earned him a new contract during 2003–04, to keep him at the Cottagers until the summer of 2006. Despite missing two months due to injury, he made his 100th appearance during the campaign but, after the emergence of younger players such as Zat Knight, his importance and role gradually diminished in 2005–06; he was the most notable of six players released on 18 May 2006, after being unable to agree on a new deal.

Goma subsequently retired, aged 33. However, in 2007, he came out of retirement, joining Al-Wakrah in Qatar, and retiring for good the following year.

==International career==
After starting representing the French under-21s in 1992, Goma would go on to earn two caps for the senior side. The first was on 9 October 1996, starting in a 4–0 friendly win against Turkey, and the second was in another exhibition game, coming on as a substitute for Frank Lebœuf for the last ten minutes of a 2–2 draw in Austria on 19 August 1998.

<text>Paddy Power is an Irish gambling company founded in 1988. Its product offering includes sports betting, online casino, online poker, and online bingo. Business operations are led from its headquarters in Dublin, alongside a satellite office in Malta. In February 2016, Paddy Power merged with Betfair to create Flutter Entertainment.

== History ==

Paddy Power was founded in 1988 by a merger of the forty shops of three Irish bookmakers: Stewart Kenny, David Power, and John Corcoran. Stewart Kenny and Vincent O&#x27;Reilly had sold Kenny O&#x27;Reilly Bookmakers to Coral in 1986, and then opened ten shops of their own by 1988; Kenny was group CEO from 1988 to 2002, and chairman from 2002 to 2003. John Corcoran&#x27;s shops had traded as Patrick Corcoran. David Power was a son of Richard Power and one of several inheritors trading under the Richard Power name. The Power name was considered the strongest brand among the merged shops, while the &quot;Paddy&quot; name and green colouring emphasised the chain&#x27;s Irishness at a time when the fragmented Irish industry was facing competition from British betting chains entering the market in response to changes in the Irish tax code. David Power&#x27;s son, whose name happens to be Paddy Power (b. 1974/5), is a marketing spokesman for the company.

== Expansion ==
Paddy Power had an aggressive expansion strategy involving opening prominent shops in most Irish towns, rather than side streets previously favoured. The firm&#x27;s novelty bets broadened its media coverage beyond the horseracing news. Its share of the Irish off-course betting market grew from 8% in 1988 to 33% in 2001.

Power Leisure, the parent company of Paddy Power PLC, listed on the London Stock Exchange in December 2000, to fund an expansion in the UK.

At the end of 2005, Paddy Power operated 195 outlets (150 in Ireland and 45 in the UK). The total number of employees was 1,374. On 27 May 2008, it acquired the Northern Irish independent bookmaker McGranaghan Racing, bringing its shop count to 191 in Ireland. In February 2010, the chain had 356 shops with 209 in Ireland, 8 in Northern Ireland and 139 in Great Britain.

The bookmaker is known for offering odds on controversial markets in order to garner publicity, e.g., in November 2008, 16–1 was laid that United States President Barack Obama &#x27;would not finish&#x27; his first term (this was widely interpreted as his odds of assassination).

After English Premier League new entrants Stoke City lost their opening game of the 2008–09 season 3–1 to Bolton Wanderers, Paddy Power controversially paid out on bets on them being relegated. When the club finished in mid-table at the end of the season the company took out a full page advert in &quot;The Sentinel&quot; apologising to the club and its supporters.

In May 2010, Paddy Power acquired a majority stake in Australian bookmaker Sportsbet.com.au.

In July 2010, the company took the unusual step of refunding bets placed on Felipe Massa to win the 2010 Germany Grand Prix following the notorious &quot;team orders&quot; incident, which led to Fernando Alonso being allowed to win the race, despite Massa&#x27;s clear lead.

In October 2011, the company paid out early on New Zealand winning the 2011 Rugby World Cup, four days before the final against France on 23 October 2011. The All Blacks were Paddy Power&#x27;s 4/6 tournament favourites and were 1/9 odds on to win the final, with France at 13/2. The company boss said: &#x27;New Zealand have left all of their opposition so far feeling black and blue and it&#x27;s inevitable us bookies will be taking a hammering from them on Sunday too, so punters might as well collect now.&#x27; New Zealand did indeed go on to win the match.

As of November 2011, Paddy Power was the largest bookmaker in Europe by total share value. Its group income was €444m in 2010.

Paddy Power was placed 6th in the 2011 &quot;Management Today&quot; list of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Most Admired Companies&quot;.

Paddy Power and British rival Betfair agreed terms for a merger in September 2015. The transaction was structured as an acquisition of Betfair by Paddy Power and the enlarged entity, named Paddy Power Betfair, is based in Dublin. The merger was completed in February 2016.

Paddy Power CEO Andy McCue became COO of Paddy Power Betfair, with Breon Corcoran, CEO of Betfair, becoming CEO of the combined group and Paddy Power&#x27;s Gary McGann becoming chairman. Andy McCue left the company in April 2016 to pursue other opportunities.

In February 2020, Paddy Power won the GGA London &quot;Betting Shop Operator of the Year&quot; award. In July 2021, it won for a second consecutive year.

June 2022 saw the launch of the Paddy Power Games vertical which replaced the online casino and live casino properties in a bid to soften the image of playing online casinos in-line with UKGC regulations.

==Criticism==
Paddy Power has drawn criticism for offering controversial markets, such as odds on the first species to be driven to extinction by the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, on a prospective assassination of United States President Barack Obama, and on the potential extinction of the polar bear in December 2009.

Paddy Power&#x27;s advertising campaigns have also been criticized. One showed sight-impaired footballers kicking a cat, about which the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 400 complaints. Another involved the model Imogen Thomas alongside a tagline using a double entendre. Paddy Power also received hundreds of complaints and was accused of transphobia by members of the LGBT community in February 2012 when the company released an advertising campaign to distinguish &quot;the stallions from the mares&quot; by placing transgender women in the crowds at the Cheltenham Festival. The ASA ruled that the advert could not be broadcast in the United Kingdom.

Additionally, the company has been criticised for not paying out on bets with large odds. In May 2009, when Shane Lowry won the Irish Open, it stated that it would not pay out on the 3000/1 odds which it had mistakenly offered and instead reached &#x27;an arrangement&#x27; with the customers involved.

During a UEFA Euro 2012 match between Denmark and Portugal on 13 June 2012, Danish forward Nicklas Bendtner celebrated his second goal by lowering his shorts and lifting his shirt to reveal a pair of Paddy Power underpants, leading to criticism from the national team&#x27;s sponsor Ladbrokes and tournament organisers UEFA. Bendtner was fined €100,000 by UEFA and banned for one game. He described his actions as being regrettable and not premeditated.

In early March 2014, 5,525 complaints, the most ever recorded, were made to the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) via an online petition launched for Paddy Power to withdraw an offer for betting on the outcome of the South African trial of Oscar Pistorius for murder of his girlfriend. On 19 March 2014, the ASA upheld all 5,525 complaints that the advertisement was insensitive, made light of disability, the death of a woman and a murder trial, and brought advertising itself into disrepute. The advert was discussed on an episode of &quot;The Last Leg&quot;, where Adam Hills made an impassioned speech condemning it.

Prior to the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Paddy Power posted a photo on its Twitter account, sourced from Reddit, allegedly showing an overhead view of a Brazilian rainforest with the message &quot;C&#x27;MON ENGLAND PP&quot; spelled out by the former locations of trees that had been cut down. Following major criticisms over the advert from users, it was revealed on 8 June 2014 that the images were fake, and part of a campaign by Paddy Power to promote its anti-deforestation charity effort.

In July 2014, Paddy Power was criticised by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office for its response to an incident in 2010, where a hacker was able to obtain personal information of more than 649,000 people from its website. The data included addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and security questions and answers. Paddy Power did not inform the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office until four years later.

In September 2017, Paddy Power offered odds on a dead footballer, Ugo Ehiogu, to become the new manager of Birmingham City F.C. The company said it had made an error. For the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Paddy Power was criticised for its controversial polar bear graffiti stunt, with a Russian polar bear being emblazoned with an England flag. Paddy Power claimed the stunt was to raise awareness of the plight of polar bears in the Russian Arctic.

In October 2018, Paddy Power Betfair received a £2.2 million fine from the UK Gambling Commission, after an investigation revealed that the company broke the commission&#x27;s rules regarding social responsibility and anti-money laundering.

In December 2018, Paddy Power and William Hill faced further criticism after allegations that they allowed a gambling addict to wager thousands of pounds in stolen cash. Victims of the theft seek £965,000 from Paddy Power that has not been compensated after the previous fine from October of that year.

In May 2023, Paddy Power was fined £490,000 by The Gambling Commission for sending a promotional push notification to customers who had signed up to exclude themselves from gambling and inviting them to bet on a football match.

<doc id="1054961" wikidata="Q2977391" url="?curid=1054961" title="Claude Fournier (filmmaker)">
<text>Claude Fournier (July 23, 1931 – March 16, 2023) was a Canadian film director, screenwriter, editor and cinematographer. He is one of the forerunners of the Cinema of Quebec. He was the twin brother of Guy Fournier.

==Career ==
Claude Fournier began his career in journalism then moved to the Radio-Canada as a news cameraman. He joined the National Film Board of Canada in 1957 as a writer and director, and he worked on early cinéma-vérité films such as &quot;À Saint-Henri le cinq septembre&quot; and &quot;La lutte&quot;. He left the Board to work in the United States with famed documentary filmmakers Richard Leacock and D.A. Pennebaker, then returned to Montreal in 1963 to set up his own production company, Rose Films.

In 1970, he directed &quot;Two Women in Gold (Deux femmes en or)&quot;, one of the most successful Quebec films of its time. In the private sector, Fournier produced over 100 short films, co-wrote the Sophia Loren film &quot;A Special Day&quot;, a Canada-Italy co-production that was nominated for an Oscar, and directed &quot;The Tin Flute&quot; with Marilyn Lightstone and &quot;The Book of Eve&quot; with Claire Bloom. &quot;The Tin Flute&quot; was entered into the 13th Moscow International Film Festival. His 1988 TV series &quot;The Mills of Power (Les Tisserands du pouvoir)&quot; won him a Gémeaux Award for best direction of a television drama and a Genie Award for Best Screenplay.

Donald Sutherland described him as &quot;one of the truly wretched directors of the world.&quot;

Also a published poet, novelist and essayist, Claude Fournier is one of the most durable and respected Quebec filmmakers of his generation.

==Death ==
Claude Fournier died at the Montreal University Hospital Centre on 16 March 2023, at the age of 91. He had been hospitalised after suffering a heart attack during a trip to Martinique.

<text>Seán Boylan (born 12 December 1949) is an Irish former Gaelic football manager from Dunboyne, County Meath. He retired from his position as manager of the senior Meath county team on the evening of 31 August 2005 after twenty-three years in charge. This was an inter-county managerial record with one team that was only surpassed in Gaelic games by Brian Cody in 2022, his 24th and last season as manager of the Kilkenny senior hurling team.

During his time with Meath, he managed the team to: the Centenary Cup; eight Leinster Senior Football Championship titles; four All-Ireland Senior Football Championship titles (1987, 1988, 1996, 1999); three National Football League titles.

He also managed the Meath county hurling team, whom he also played with for 21 years. He managed Ireland in the 2006 and 2008 International Rules Series.

On 6 August 2020, a documentary called &quot;Seán&quot;, directed by Alan Bradley, aired on RTÉ about Boylan&#x27;s life on and off the pitch.

==Gaelic games==
In recognition of his services to Meath GAA and his services to Meath as a county, Boylan was conferred as Freeman of the County of Meath – the first (and only) person ever to be bestowed with the title – on 23 April 2006. He was entered into the GAA Hall of Fame for his services to Meath football at a ceremony after Meath&#x27;s Leinster Minor Football Championship victory over Offaly in Croke Park on 16 July 2006.

In August 2006, he was once again nominated for the role of Meath senior hurling team manager, the position he originally expected to have been nominated for when he ended up as Meath&#x27;s inter-county football manager.

He has also been involved with UCD in the Sigerson Cup and was announced as part of Conor Laverty&#x27;s Down under-20 backroom team in December 2020.

In 2011, he was ratified as Meath&#x27;s Director of Football, representing the Meath Co Committee in the sport&#x27;s development at all levels and having a role in appointing all managers of county teams.

After Colm O&#x27;Rourke was appointed as Meath senior manager in 2022, he wrote that Boylan &quot;will have open access to the team as adviser, counsellor, motivator or whatever else he wants to be&quot;.

==International rules football==
Boylan coached the Ireland team against Australia in the 2006 International Rules Series in two games in Pearse Stadium, Salthill, Galway and Croke Park, Dublin in October 2006. Australia won the series by 30 points but the game was overshadowed by violent incidents in the first quarter of the second test match, including a serious injury sustained by Graham Geraghty. He also admitted that he brought his players off at the end of the first quarter in protest and did not want them to return, later saying: &quot;I said I&#x27;d do it. Only the players themselves changed my mind. They said they wanted to go out and give it a go, they wanted to play football.&quot;

Boylan coached the international side again in the 2008 International Rules Series. Ireland won on an aggregate score of 102–97.

==Outside Gaelic games==
Boylan&#x27;s late father, also called Seán, was a leader of the Irish independence movement in the early twentieth century, being a prominent member of the IRA in County Meath during the Irish War of Independence.

Like another Meath football icon, Colm O&#x27;Rourke, Boylan has strong County Leitrim connections as his late mother hailed from near the small village of Cloone near Mohill.

Boylan is a traditional medical herbalist, practising out of his home at Edenmore, Dunboyne.

He had prostate cancer in 2009. In January 2021, he gave an interview to RTÉ Radio, during which he said he had tested positive for COVID-19 the previous March, lost ten kilograms in six days, and was in Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown until the 31st of the same month. Less than three months later, Boylan said he was &quot;shocked&quot; after photographs circulated of Dublin secretly training during Level 5 restrictions, breaching both GAA rules and Government regulations.

<text>The Roof Gardens (formerly known as Kensington Roof Gardens) is a private roof garden covering on top of the former Derry &amp; Toms building on Kensington High Street in central London. 

Originally opened in 1938, the gardens were open to the public until January 2018 when the leaseholder, Virgin Limited Edition, was unable to reach an agreement with the freeholder about renewal of the lease.

==History==
Derry and Toms new Art Deco department store was opened in 1933. The gardens were laid out between 1936 and 1938 by Ralph Hancock, a landscape architect who had just created the &quot;Gardens of the Nations&quot; on the 11th floor of the RCA Building in New York, on the instructions of Trevor Bowen (then vice-president of Barkers, the department store giant that owned the site and constructed the building). They cost £25,000 to create and visitors were charged 1 shilling to enter. Money raised was donated to local hospitals and £120,000 was raised during the next 30 years.

The building housed the department store Derry and Toms until 1973, and then Biba until 1975. In 1978, the garden&#x27;s Art Deco tea pavilion was redeveloped into a Régine&#x27;s nightclub, in 1981 Virgin Limited Edition bought the lease to the roof garden and the pavilion, and in 2001 Virgin turned the pavilion into the Babylon restaurant.

The more than 100 trees in the garden were given a tree preservation order by Kensington &amp; Chelsea council in 1976, the roof garden buildings were Grade II* listed by English Heritage in 1981 as part of a listing given the whole building, and the garden itself was given a Grade II listing in 1998 within the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Virgin ceased its operation of the Roof Gardens in January 2018 and the site is currently closed to the public. Stephen Fitzpatrick, Founder of OVO Energy and Vertical Aerospace acquired the site in 2021 and will be re-opening The Roof Gardens as a three-storey social club in 2024.

==The gardens==
It is divided into three themed gardens:

*a Spanish garden, in a Moorish style based upon the Alhambra in Spain, with fountains, vine-covered walkways and Chusan palms;
*a Tudor style garden, characterised by its archways, secret corners and hanging wisteria. Roses, lilies and lavender contribute the rich summer scent to the garden;
*an English water garden, with over 100 species of trees, a stream, and a garden pond that is the home to pintail ducks and four flamingos called Bill, Ben, Splosh and Pecks. There are over 30 different species of trees in the water garden, including trees from the original planting over sixty years ago. The roof was designed to bear the load of one hundredweight per square foot (approximately 500 kilogrammes per square metre) with a drainage layer of brick and clinker beneath the soil. Although they are on a rooftop, the trees were made the subject of tree preservation orders in 1976.

<doc id="1054976" wikidata="Q3756394" url="?curid=1054976" title="Páidí Ó Sé">
<text>Páidí Ó Sé (; 16 May 1955 – 15 December 2012) was an Irish Gaelic football manager and player, whose league and championship career at senior level with the Kerry county team spanned fifteen seasons from 1974 to 1988. Ó Sé is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of his generation.

Born in Ceann Trá, County Kerry, Ó Sé was named after the Kerry Gaelic footballer of the time; Paudie Sheehy. He was encouraged as a Gaelic footballer by his mother, who recognised his &quot;raw talent&quot; and nurtured it. As a boarder at St Brendan&#x27;s College Ó Sé excelled in the sport at colleges level and won back-to-back Corn Uí Mhuirí medals, however, an All-Ireland medal remained elusive.

At just fourteen-years of age Ó Sé joined the Gaeltacht senior team in 1970. He won numerous divisional championship titles in the course of his career, while he was also selected for the West Kerry divisional team. Ó Sé won back-to-back county senior championship medals in 1984 and 1985.

Ó Sé made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was selected for the Kerry minor team in 1971. He enjoyed three championship seasons with the minor team, however, he was a Munster runner-up all three occasions. Ó Sé subsequently joined the Kerry under-21 team, winning back-to-back All-Ireland medals in 1975 and 1976. By this stage he had also joined the Kerry senior team, making his debut during the 1973-74 league. Over the course of the next fifteen seasons, Ó Sé won eight All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph in 1975, a record-equalling four championships in-a-row from 1978 to 1981 and three championships in-a-row from 1984 to 1986. He also won eleven Munster medals, four National Football League medals and five successive All-Stars. Ó Sé played his last game for Kerry in May 1988 before being dropped from the starting fifteen for the subsequent Munster final defeat by Cork, a move which effectively brought an end to his inter-county career.

After being chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1976, Ó Sé was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen until 1985. During that time he won four Railway Cup medals.

Even during his playing days Ó Sé became involved in team management and coaching. He was player-manager of the West Kerry team that secured championship honours in 1985, before guiding the team to a second championship title from the sideline in 1990. Ó Sé was overlooked for the position of Kerry senior football team manager in 1989 and again in 1992, however, he was appointed manager of the Kerry under-21 team in 1993. After winning the All-Ireland Championship in this grade in 1995, he was later appointed manager of the Kerry senior team. In his eight seasons in charge Ó Sé guided the team to two All-Ireland Championships, six Munster Championships and one National League. As manager he was instrumental in developing the inter-county careers of his three nephews, Darragh, Tomás and Marc Ó Sé, however, his tenure as manager ended acrimoniously after a heavy defeat by Tyrone which followed some controversial comments about the Kerry supporters. Ó Sé remained in inter-county management and was appointed manager of the westmeath senior team in 2003. His tenure was a successful one, with Westmeath securing a first ever Leinster Championship in 2004. Ó Sé ended his inter-county managerial career with a one-year stint as manager of the Clare senior team.

Ó Sé was renowned as a tough defender and tight marker, a trait best exemplified in the fact that he conceded just one solitary point in ten All-Ireland final appearances. He was regarded as a larger-than-life character both on and off the field and he remains an iconic figure in the annals of Gaelic football in Kerry. Ó Sé&#x27;s sudden death in December 2012 led to a widespread outpouring of grief amongst the people of Kerry and a deep sense of loss throughout the wider Gaelic football community.

==Early life==
Páidi Ó Sé was born in the heart of the Gaeltacht in Ceann Trá, County Kerry in 1955. He was the third of three boys, with two older brothers Mícheál and brother Tom. A native Irish speaker, he was educated locally at Cill Mhic a&#x27; Domhnaigh National School. He later attended Dingle CBS, St Brendan&#x27;s College in Killarney (from which he was expelled), before completing his Leaving Certificate (which he failed) at St Michael&#x27;s College in Listowel. While receiving his secondary school education, Ó Sé&#x27;s interest in Gaelic football was nurtured. During his secondary schooling, he won four consecutive Kerry senior colleges&#x27; titles from 1971 until 1974. Ó Sé won back-to-back Corn Uí Mhuirí titles in 1972 and 1973 with St Brendan&#x27;s, before adding a Munster &#x27;B&#x27; colleges&#x27; title to his collection in 1974 with St Michael&#x27;s. He subsequently trained to be a Garda Síochána and was based in Limerick for four years. He also played rugby for Young Munster for one year. He quit the guards to become a publican as it suited his football career.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Ó Sé played his club football with an Ghaeltacht. He made his senior debut as a fourteen-year-old in 1969, before going on to win a West Kerry divisional medal in 1970. It was with divisional side West Kerry that Ó Sé enjoyed his greatest success. As player-manager of the team in 1984 he guided West Kerry to a County Championship final. South Kerry provided the opposition; however, a narrow 1-7 to 1-6 victory gave Ó Sé a Championship medal. A second Championship medal was added to Ó Sé&#x27;s collection in 1985 as West Kerry retained their title following a defeat of Feale Rangers. Ó Sé finished off his club career with an Ghaeltacht, winning a West Kerry League medal in 1988.

===Minor and under-21===
Ó Sé first played for Kerry as a member of the county&#x27;s minor football team. He enjoyed little success in this grade, before later joining the Kerry under-21 football team.

After missing Kerry&#x27;s Munster final triumph in 1973, Ó Sé was a key addition to the team for the subsequent All-Ireland final. Mayo provided the opposition on that occasion; however, Kerry recorded a 2-13 to 0-13 victory. The win gave Ó Sé an All-Ireland medal.

In 1975, Ó Sé captured a Munster medal following a nine-point trouncing of Waterford. Ó Sé&#x27;s side later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Dublin providing the opposition. A 1-15 to 0-10 score line gave Kerry the victory and gave Ó Sé a second All-Ireland medal.

In 1976, Ó Sé added a second Munster medal to his collection as Kerry retained their provincial crown at the expense of Cork. He later lined out in a third All-Ireland final. Kildare provided the opposition on that occasion; however, they were no match for Kerry. Ó Sé collected a third All-Ireland medal following a 0-14 to 1-3 trouncing.

===Senior===
Ó Sé made his first senior appearance for Kerry in a National League game against Galway in 1974. It was a successful campaign as Kerry subsequently reached the final against Roscommon. A drawn game was followed by 0-14 to 0-8 victory for Kerry. It was Ó Sé&#x27;s first National League medal. He later made his championship debut against Waterford.

In 1975, a new-look Kerry team was formed under the management of former player Mick O&#x27;Dwyer. It was the beginning of a glorious era for Kerry football and Ó Sé played a key role in orchestrating much of the success for the team that would come to be regarded as the greatest of all-time. That year he won his first Munster medal, dethroning Cork as provincial champions in the process. Ó Sé later lined out in his first senior All-Ireland final. Reigning champions Dublin provided the opposition and were installed as the red-hot favourites over the youngest Kerry team of all-time. On a rain-soaked day John Egan and substitute Ger O&#x27;Driscoll scored two goals and the Dubs were ambushed by 2-12 to 0-11. It was Ó Sé&#x27;s first All-Ireland medal at senior level. Ó Sé later said, &quot;To this day, winning that All-Ireland medal is my greatest thrill. The oldest person on the team was Brendan Lynch and he was only 25. Nobody gave us a chance: we were just a team of 15 bachelors from Kerry up for the day&quot;.

Ó Sé captured his second Munster medal in 1976 before later lining out in his second All-Ireland final. Once again it was Dublin who provided the opposition. Both sides were hoping for success; however, new player Kevin Moran was causing havoc with the Kerry defence. Jimmy Keaveney converted a penalty to help Dublin to a 3-8 to 0-10 victory and defeat for Ó Sé.

1977 proved to be another frustrating year. The year began with Ó Sé capturing a second National League medal and a third consecutive Munster medal following another win over Cork. Kerry later took on Dublin for the third consecutive year; however, this time it was in the All-Ireland semi-final. In one of the greatest games of football ever-played, the Dubs triumphed and Ó Sé was still left waiting for a second All-Ireland medal.

In 1978, Kerry once again faced little competition in the Provincial Championship. Kerry defeated Cork, on a scoreline of 3-14 to 3-7, giving Ó Sé a fourth Munster medal in-a-row. Kerry later qualified for a third All-Ireland final in four years. Old rivals Dublin provided the opposition; however, the game turned into a rout. The game is chiefly remembered for Mikey Sheehy&#x27;s sensational goal. The Kerry forward lobbed the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen, who was caught off his line arguing with the referee. New full-forward Eoin Liston scored a hat-trick of goals. Pat Spillane played all over the field, including goalkeeper after Charlie Nelligan was sent off. At the full-time whistle Kerry were the winners by 5-11 to 0-9.

Kerry made it five-in-a-row in Munster in 1979 as Cork fell by ten points in the provincial final. Ó Sé later went in search of a third All-Ireland medal as he lined out in a fourth All-Ireland championship decider. Dublin provided the opposition for the fifth consecutive occasion. Kerry were handicapped throughout the game. Ger Power did not start the game, while John O&#x27;Keeffe got injured and Ó Sé was sent off during the encounter. Two goals by Mikey Sheehy and a third by John Egan helped the Kingdom to a 3-13 to 1-8 victory. It was Ó Sé&#x27;s third All-Ireland medal.

Kerry&#x27;s dominance continued in 1980. Another defeat of Cork in the provincial final gave Ó Sé a sixth successive Munster medal. Another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned, this time with Roscommon providing the opposition. The Connacht champions shocked Kerry and took a five-point lead inside the first twelve minutes. Mikey Sheehy popped up again to score the decisive goal, as Kerry went on to claim a 1-9 to 1-6 victory in a game that contained sixty-four frees. The victory gave Kerry a third All-Ireland title in succession, while Ó Sé added a fourth All-Ireland medal to his ever-growing collection.

In 1981, Ó Sé won his seventh consecutive Munster title, before lining out in the All-Ireland final against Offaly. Kerry had an easy win with seven players combining for a great goal. He captured his fifth All-Ireland medal that day as Kerry won by 1-12 to 0-8.

Ó Sé won his third National League medal in 1982 before Kerry secured an eighth consecutive Munster final victory over Cork. The All-Ireland final pitted the Kingdom against Offaly for the second year in-a-row. Kerry had the upper hand for much of the game and were leading by two points with two minutes left to be played. The game, however, was not over as Offaly substitute Séamus Darby, who had entered the game almost unnoticed, produced the most spectacular of finishes by scoring a late goal. Kerry failed to score again to level the match and Offaly went on to win their third All-Ireland title ever on a score line of 1-15 to 0-17.

Kerry missed out on an historic nine-in-a-row in Munster in 1983, as Cork finally triumphed after so many defeats. The Kingdom bounced back the following year with Ó Sé winning his fourth National League medal and his ninth Munster medal. The centenary-year All-Ireland final pitted Kerry against old rivals and reigning champions Dublin. Kerry dominated the game from start to finish. Only two Dublin forwards scored as Kerry ran out easy winners by 0-14 to 1-6. It was Ó Sé&#x27;s sixth All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal.

In 1985, Ó Sé was appointed captain of the Kerry team. A two-goal victory over Cork gave Ó Sé a remarkable tenth Munster medal. Another All-Ireland final beckoned, with Dublin providing the opposition for a second consecutive year. Jack O&#x27;Shea scored a key goal after eleven minutes and Kerry stormed to a nine-point lead at half-time. The Dubs came storming back with Joe McNally scoring two goals. The gap could not be bridged and Kerry won by 2-12 to 2-8. The victory gave Ó Sé a record-equalling seventh All-Ireland medal, while he also had the honour of lifting the Sam Maguire Cup.

In 1986, Kerry&#x27;s dominance showed no sign of disappearing. Cork fell again in the provincial final, giving Ó Sé an eleventh Munster medal. A tenth All-Ireland final appearance quickly followed and it turned out to be an historic occasion. Tyrone provided the opposition in their first-ever championship decider. A Peter Quinn goal gave the Ulster men a six-point lead in the second-half; however, the game was far from over. Pat Spillane ran fifty yards up the field for a hand-passed goal to get Kerry back on track. Mikey Sheehy scored a second goal to give the Kingdom a 2-15 to 1-10 victory. It was a record-breaking eighth All-Ireland medal for Ó Sé. He only conceded one point to his opponent in his ten All-Ireland final appearances.

The glory days were now over for Kerry as Cork captured the Munster title in 1987. Following Kerry&#x27;s 1988 Championship exit, Mick O&#x27;Dwyer dropped Ó Sé from the inter-county team. They did not speak for three years.

===Inter-provincial===
O Sé also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success. He first played for his province in 1976 as Munster reached the decider. A 2-15 to 2-8 defeat of Leinster gave Ó Sé a Railway Cup medal. After an absence of a year, Ó Sé returned to the provincial team in 1978. Munster reached the decider once again; however, a 2-7 apiece draw with Ulster was the result on that occasion. Munster won the replay by 4-12 to 0-19 and Ó Sé collected a second Railway Cup medal. Ó Sé lined out with Munster until 1985, winning two more Railway Cup medals following back-to-back defeats of Connacht in 1981 and 1982.

==Managerial career==
===Kerry===
In late 1995, Ó Sé returned to the limelight when he was appointed manager of the Kerry senior football team. The task ahead was enormous as Kerry had fallen down the pecking order in terms of championship aspirations. The county hadn&#x27;t won an All-Ireland title since Ó Sé was a player almost a decade earlier in 1986. Kerry&#x27;s last Munster title came in 1991; however, since then near rivals Cork had dominated the provincial series. In Ó Sé&#x27;s first Munster campaign in 1996 Kerry reached the final. Cork, a team looking for an eighth title in ten years, provided the opposition, however, Ó Sé&#x27;s touch worked the oracle as the Kingdom won by 0-14 to 0-11. It was a sign that Kerry were on the way back; however, a defeat by Mayo in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final highlighted the fact that the team was lacking in some quarters.

In 1997, Ó Sé&#x27;s Kerry announced their arrival when they captured the National League title at the start of the year. A second Munster title soon followed after a demolition of Clare in the provincial decider. Kerry subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final, with Mayo providing the opposition. The game saw both sides share periods of dominance. Kerry&#x27;s Maurice Fitzgerald scored nine of his team&#x27;s points while Mayo scored 1-2 in a two-minute spell. The Connacht champions failed to score in the last twenty minutes as Kerry held on to win by 0-13 to 1-7. The win was all the more significant for Ó Sé as he became one of the few people who captained and managed his county to an All-Ireland title.

1998 saw Ó Sé&#x27;s Kerry team make it three Munster titles in a row. But, his side were later defeated by Mick O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s Kildare in the All-Ireland semi-final.

After losing their provincial title in 1999, Kerry were back in 2000, securing a fourth Munster title in five campaigns. Kerry later defeated Armagh, after a draw and a replay which featured extra-time, to set up an All-Ireland final meeting with Galway. That game saw Ó Sé&#x27;s side take a seven-point lead; however, Galway fought back to force a 0-14 apiece draw and a replay. A disputed free gave Kerry the lead with seventeen minutes left and Ó Sé&#x27;s side eventually held on to win by 0-17 to 1-10.

At this point it looked as if Ó Sé&#x27;s side would dominate football for the foreseeable future. In 2001 he guided Kerry to another Munster title and it looked as if a second consecutive All-Ireland title was on the cards. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final proved to be a reality check as Meath trounced the Kingdom by 2-14 to 0-5.

In 2002, Kerry were still the masters of provincial football and Ó Sé guided his county to a sixth Munster title. Kerry later reached a third All-Ireland final under Ó Sé, this time with Armagh providing the opposition. At half-time it looked as if Kerry were on course for the ultimate victory. The Ulstermen lost John McEntee to concussion while Oisín McConville missed a penalty just before the interval. With a four-point lead and playing into the wind Kerry were set. McConville, however, scored a decisive goal in the fifty-fifth minute which stunned Kerry. Ó Sé&#x27;s side failed to score for the last seventeen minutes as Armagh went on to claim their first All-Ireland title with a 1-12 to 0-14 victory.

2003 saw Ó Sé&#x27;s tenure as manager dogged by controversy. In January of that year he gave a controversial interview to the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; in which he described the Kerry supporters as &quot;the roughest type of fucking animals you could ever deal with&quot;. Ó Sé was forced to issue an embarrassing apology; however, he still guided his team to a seventh Munster title in eight years. Kerry, however, were later trounced by eventual champions Tyrone in the All-Ireland semi-final. Ó Sé later described the result as a &quot;disastrous defeat&quot;. He was fired as manager. Speaking from his second home in Marbella, Ó Sé said: &quot;I have to put it on record that I was extremely disappointed in the manner it [his sacking] was done.&quot;

===Westmeath===
One week after being sacked as Kerry manager, Ó Sé was unveiled as the new senior manager of the Westmeath county football team. On Sunday, 10 March 2004, Westmeath took on Jack O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Kerry team in a fourth-round league match, with Kerry winning by a scoreline of 2-10 to 0-10 victory, as Ó Sé sat on the bench, later admitting in the documentary &quot;Marooned&quot; that it was &quot;the hardest day of my life outside bereavements and things like that&quot;. Things improved a little and Ó Sé led the county to their first ever Leinster Championship title in his first season in charge. The 0-12 to 0-10 defeat of Laois in the provincial decider proved that Ó Sé was a manager of some considerable skill. However, Westmeath&#x27;s dream season came to an abrupt halt with a defeat by Derry in the All-Ireland quarter-final.

Ó Sé&#x27;s second season in charge was less successful. Westmeath were dumped out of the provincial championship on their first outing. A defeat of Tipperary in the subsequent All-Ireland qualifiers was followed by a loss to Clare. This defeat brought Ó Sé&#x27;s tenure to an end, and he was replaced by his understudy Tomás Ó Flatharta.

===Clare===
In 2007, Ó Sé was linked with a possible return to Kerry as manager; however, instead he was appointed manager of the Clare senior footballers. Once again expectations were high that Ó Sé would work his magic in a non-traditional football county. His tenure got off to a bad start when Clare were defeated by Waterford in the opening round of the provincial campaign and dumped out of the Championship. Speculation was rife that Ó Sé had abandoned Clare after this defeat. However, he returned and Clare later participated in the Tommy Murphy Cup, though a defeat by Antrim in the semi-final brought Ó Sé&#x27;s tenure as manager to a premature end. He never again managed at inter-county level.

==Personal life==
Ó Sé married his wife Máire, a schoolteacher, in 1984 and together they had three children - Neasa, Siún and Pádraig Óg. Ó Sé has three nephews that have also played for Kerry; Darragh, Tomás and Marc Ó Sé. All three have been selected for All Stars Awards teams. Daughter Siún married Paul Geaney in December 2018.

==Business career==
Ó Sé ran a famed pub in Ceann Trá, the opening of which was attended by Taoiseach Charles Haughey, who flew into Kerry on one of his helicopters. The wall of his famous pub is adorned with portraits of figures such as Bill Clinton, Tom Cruise, Martin Sheen, Dolly Parton, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen.

==Politics==
A friend of government ministers, chat show hosts and Hollywood actors, as well as a director of Fáilte Ireland, Ó Sé was a fervent supporter of the centrist Fianna Fáil political party which dominated Ireland&#x27;s national political scene during his lifetime. He regarded Charles Haughey as a great Taoiseach, openly admired Bertie Ahern and, ahead of the EU/IMF/ECB troika intervention in the country&#x27;s affairs, he defended Brian Cowen as a &quot;magnificent leader&quot; in whom he had the &quot;fullest of faith&quot;. When asked in 2004, he said he would like Cowen to be the next Finance Minister and admitted an interest in property investments. He was a good friend of Bertie Ahern; when Ahern was Taoiseach, he once brought the entire cabinet to the launch, at Dublin&#x27;s Burlington Hotel, of the Páidí Ó Sé Football Weekend. Ó Sé was often spoken of as a future national politician himself, though he never pursued a political career.

==Death==
Ó Sé died suddenly at his home in Ceann Trá early on 15 December 2012. His death, at the age of 57, was unexpected and was thought to have been as a result of a heart attack. Having got up in the morning, he had gone to lie down again after experiencing what he thought was indigestion, and his wife Maire found his body soon after.

Many figures from sport and politics offered their condolences, including President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins. Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore described Ó Sé as &quot;arguably the best defender to grace Croke Park [...] a one-off – truly unique&quot;. Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht minister and former teammate Jimmy Deenihan was &quot;shocked&quot; to learn of the death. Sports minister Michael Ring said it was as &quot;a sad day for Ireland, the GAA, for Kerry and for Irish culture&quot;. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin called him a GAA giant and gentleman.

Ó Sé&#x27;s fellow Kerry legend Pat Spillane said he was &quot;heartbroken&quot;. John O&#x27;Mahony, who both played against and managed against Ó Sé, said he was &quot;deeply shocked&quot;. Dara Ó Cinnéide described the deceased as &quot;an exception to every rule&quot;. Joe Kernan, whose Armagh team triumphed over Ó Sé&#x27;s Kerry team in the 2002 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, said: &quot;The reaction to his death up here in Ulster has been incredible. Every GAA man, woman and child in any part of the country felt they knew Páidí. He was just one of those great characters that people loved. It&#x27;s hard to believe he&#x27;s gone&quot;. Colm Cooper, who first played for Kerry when Ó Sé was manager, was said to be devastated.

There was an outpouring of grief on Twitter. Many personalities used it to express their sorrow. Tadhg Kennelly wrote on Twitter, &quot;Woke up to find the sad news of another Kerry hero who has gone to the &quot;kingdom of Heaven&quot;.&quot; Kevin Cassidy wrote, &quot;Shocked to hear of the passing of Paidi O Se wat a man typified all that I love about the GAA skill heart passion had it all and a great guy&quot;. Aidan Walsh wrote, &quot;Very sad to hear about Paudie o Shea..one of the best footballers of all time.&quot; Marty Morrissey wrote, &quot;Heartbroken.&quot;

Kerry GAA released the following statement: &quot;It is with deep regret that Coiste Chontae Chiarraí has been informed of the unexpected death earlier this morning of one of the county&#x27;s most outstanding footballers, Páidí Ó Sé. The Chairman of Coiste Chontae Chiarrai, Mr Patrick O&#x27;Sullivan, on behalf of all GAA Gaels, wishes to express his deep sympathy to the Ó Sé family on this sad occasion.&quot;

President Ó Néill said: &quot;There was hardly a person on the island of Ireland, never mind in the GAA, who did not recognise or know of Páidí Ó Sé, such was his contribution to the Association and to Irish life over a prolonged period.&quot;

The body of Páidí Ó Sé lay in repose at his home in Ceann Trá, with &quot;a constant stream of mourners&quot; seen going in and out during the wake.

Ó Sé was also remembered by the BBC at their 2012 Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony, which was held the evening after his death. Des Cahill of RTÉ Sport called it a &quot;fantastic gesture&quot; by the broadcaster in the neighbouring country.

<text>Barsac (; ) is a commune on the left bank of the Garonne river in the Gironde department in southwestern France.

==Geography==
Barsac is located 37 km upstream the Garonne river of Bordeaux. Barsac station has rail connections to Langon and Bordeaux.

==Population==
==Wine==
The town gives its name to a wine making appellation, Barsac AOC, that produces sweet white wines.

The town and its vineyards are separated from the area of Sauternes to the south by the Ciron river, whose cooling effect is of key importance in encouraging the annual action of the &quot;Botrytis&quot; fungus on the Sémillon grapes. The area is marginally flatter than its neighbour and its wines are considered to be marginally lighter. The area is however permitted to use the Sauternes appellation.

Producers from the area include the First Growths Château Climens, and Château Coutet.

==Personalities==
* Venerable Marie-Thérèse de Lamourous (1754 – 1836), a French Lay-woman, member of the underground Church during the French Revolution, and foundress of the Sister of the Miséricorde of Bordeaux.

<doc id="1054980" wikidata="Q5253262" url="?curid=1054980" title="Contra-rotating">
<text>Contra-rotating, also referred to as coaxial contra-rotating, is a technique whereby parts of a mechanism rotate in opposite directions about a common axis, usually to minimise the effect of torque. Examples include some aircraft propellers, resulting in the maximum power of a single piston or turboprop engine to drive two propellers in opposite rotation. Contra-rotating propellers are also common in some marine transmission systems, in particular for large speed boats with planing hulls. Two propellers are arranged one behind the other, and power is transferred from the engine via planetary gear transmission. The configuration can also be used in helicopter designs termed coaxial rotors, where similar issues and principles of torque apply.

Contra-rotating propellers should not be confused with counter-rotating propellers, a term which describes propellers rotating in opposite directions but sitting apart from each other on separate shafts instead of sharing a common axis. Tandem-rotor helicopters such as the CH-47 Chinook also use a counter-rotating arrangement.

The efficiency of a contra-rotating propeller is somewhat offset by its mechanical complexity. Nonetheless, coaxial contra-rotating propellers and rotors are moderately common in military aircraft and naval applications, such as torpedoes, where the added maintenance cost is not a primary concern.

==Aircraft propulsion and lift==
While several nations experimented with contra-rotating propellers in aircraft, only the United Kingdom and Soviet Union produced them in large numbers. The U.S. worked with several prototypes, including the tail-sitting Convair XFY and Lockheed XFV &quot;Pogo&quot; VTOL fighters, but jet engine technology was advancing rapidly and the designs were deemed unnecessary.

Some helicopters use contra-rotating coaxial rotors mounted one above the other. The H-43 Huskie helicopter uses non-coaxial intermeshing rotors turning in opposite directions.

The F-35B variant of the F-35 Lightning II strike fighter uses a lift fan with contra-rotating blades.

<text>John Ignatius Quinn, commonly known as Seán Quinn (born 5 December 1947), is an Irish businessman and conglomerateur. In 2008 he was the richest person in the Republic of Ireland, but in 2012 he was declared bankrupt.

The &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; in 2008 estimated his personal worth to be €4.722 billion or
£3.73 billion, thereby making him the richest person in Ireland. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 Rich List listed him again as the richest person in Ireland, in 164th place amongst the wealthiest individuals in the world. His net worth, as of February 2008, was estimated at $6.0 billion, approximately £3.084 billion.

In November 2005 the Quinn Group, which was then privately owned by the Quinn family, was elsewhere estimated to be worth between €4 billion and €5 billion. In 2007 the group made a pre-tax profit of £439m. In April 2011 Kieran Wallace of KPMG was appointed as share receiver to Anglo Irish Bank (to which the Quinn Group owe over €2.8 billion) and took control of the Quinn family&#x27;s equity interest in Quinn Group. Sean Quinn and the Quinn family no longer have any role in the management, operations or ownership of the Quinn Group. Quinn was declared bankrupt on 11 November 2011 in Northern Ireland; this was annulled on appeal but he was declared bankrupt in the Republic of Ireland on 16 January 2012. He did not oppose the application. He owed over €2 billion to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation.

Quinn was sentenced at the High Court in Dublin on 2 November 2012 to nine weeks in jail, due to contempt of court. Quinn&#x27;s son-in-law, Niall McPartland, successfully used &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; legislation to remove articles from internet search listings that highlighted their lavish lifestyle before becoming bankrupt, along with key parts of Quinn&#x27;s bankruptcy.

==Irish business==
=== Foundation and early years ===
Quinn took over the family farm in late 1967, after the passing of his father, Hugh, who had bought it for £2,000. A number of other local farmers had excavated gravel in the 1950s and 1960s—the land, while being agriculturally poor, was mineral rich. Farming had not made the family much money and Quinn did not particularly enjoy it.

In an interview with Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Business Post&quot;, Quinn attributed his initial success to the contacts he developed through the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). These contacts enabled him to build a company spanning both sides of the Irish border when, in 1973, he borrowed £100 and started extracting gravel from his family farm, washing it and selling it to local builders. The company was called Seán Quinn Quarries Ltd. From this came Quinn Cement, the basis of his wealth. In recent years Quinn diversified with his Quinn Group playing a leading role in Ireland&#x27;s hospitality industry, setting up Quinn Hotels. The centrepiece hotel was the Slieve Russell Hotel in Ballyconnell, County Cavan. He maintains interests in Ireland&#x27;s glass, radiator and plastics industries with Quinn Glass, based in Fermanagh, and Quinn Lite Pac, based in County Longford. As of 2009, the Quinn Group employed more than 5,500 people throughout Ireland.

Quinn Financial Services, founded in 1996, includes the Quinn Direct insurance business. With its headquarters in Cavan, it made €123 million profit in the first six months of 2006 (up 38% on the previous year), on sales of €386 million between January and June 2006.

In January 2007 the Quinn Group purchased Ireland&#x27;s second biggest health insurance provider, Bupa Ireland, for €150 million in a deal that saved BUPA from leaving Ireland&#x27;s health insurance industry. In the same month Quinn increased his share holding in the Anglo Irish Bank to approximately 5%, for an equivalent value of €570 million – financed through the group&#x27;s equity and through a deal with the Swiss-based giant Credit Suisse.

Throughout 2007 peaking in July 2008 Quinn increased his family&#x27;s stake to 15% in Anglo Irish Bank. The bank along with all financial institutions in Ireland saw its share price collapse in the latter half of 2008, and on 15 January 2009 the Irish government announced it had taken control of the bank. Shares were trading for as little as 22c (from a high of €17 in May 2007) before the takeover.

==Recession of 2008==
&quot;Forbes&quot; Rich List had estimated that the Quinn family&#x27;s net worth took a major hit in 2008–09, with Denis O&#x27;Brien replacing Quinn as Ireland&#x27;s wealthiest person.

===Anglo-Irish Bank investment===
A large part of the subsequent loss can be linked to the well-publicised near collapse of the Anglo Irish Bank, which wiped out at least €2.8 billion of the family&#x27;s wealth. Between October 2005 and July 2007 Quinn built up a 28% stake in the bank, mainly through contracts for difference, a financial instrument used to gamble on the bank share price. Quinn admitted at the time in an RTÉ Prime Time interview that it had &quot;set the company back 2 to 3 years&quot;.

In 2008 the shares or contracts for difference bought in Anglo Irish Bank dropped in value and the bank had to find a buyer for Quinn&#x27;s shares. A group of clients known as the &quot;Golden Circle&quot; bought the shares, and, controversially (and illegally), the bank lent them €451 million to buy them. The €451 million was never repaid as the Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy emerged, following which the bank was nationalised in 2009.

===Quinn Insurance===
In 2008, Quinn Insurance was levied a record €3.25 million fine from the Financial Regulator in the Republic of Ireland with Quinn personally being fined €200,000. These fines were related to loans issued from Quinn Insurance to an associated company that he controlled. &quot;These loans breached insurance regulations and as a result of this the Financial Regulator has sanctioned Quinn Insurance and myself. I accept complete responsibility for this breach of regulation.&quot; The fines arose from a failure to notify the regulator of a loan of €288 million from Quinn Insurance to other firms in his group. The cash was used by the Quinn family to cover falling stock market investments and finance share-buying in Anglo Irish Bank. On the back of the fines, Quinn stepped down from the board of Quinn Insurance and a number of other Quinn Group boards announcing plans to restructure the boards to reflect those of a public company. In March 2010 The High Court in Dublin ruled that Quinn Insurance should be placed into administration.

Quinn Insurance had made losses of €905m in 2009, and €160m in 2010, and the Irish Government passed the Insurance (Amendment ) Bill 2011 which imposed a 2% levy on all other Insurance policies to meet an estimated €280m shortfall to the state&#x27;s Insurance Compensation Fund. Because part of the losses were caused by Quinn Insurance loans to fund speculative investments for other Quinn family companies, Clare Daly commented that – &quot;A large percentage of insurance losses result from speculative gambling on the property market by the family and, in effect, the legislation provides for the transfer of those gambling debts on to the shoulders of hard pressed taxpayers and working people who need to insure cars, homes and so on.&quot; The cost to Irish policyholders will come to €65m annually over five years.

===Liquidation litigation from 2010===
With Anglo Irish Bank&#x27;s financial difficulties Quinn was pursued in 2010 for his loans from it, then about €2.8 billion secured on property worth much less. In April 2011 the loans were formally called, and an ongoing series of court cases are underway in several jurisdictions. In particular, his overseas holding company, Quinn Investments Sweden, was wound up in July 2011.

In July 2011 Anglo Irish Bank was renamed as the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC).

It was found in late 2011 that some of the Swedish company&#x27;s assets had been transferred to family-controlled companies in Cyprus, leading to a fresh round of litigation there. It was alleged by the liquidator that property owned in Russia worth $193m had been sold to a cousin, Peter Quinn, for $1,000 and a laptop computer. The Quinn family described the allegations as &quot;baseless and hardly deserving of comment&quot;. Other property in Kyiv, Ukraine, that was 93% controlled from Sweden was the subject of further proceedings in December 2011.

Separately, Quinn&#x27;s wife and children have started legal proceedings in Dublin in 2011 alleging that the €2.34 billion that he borrowed from Anglo-Irish Bank to buy the bank should not be repayable because the money was lent for the unlawful purpose of supporting the bank&#x27;s share price. He has been joined as a third party in the case.

The Quinn Group liquidator&#x27;s staff have said that since its liquidation in April 2011 an unusual amount of damage has been caused to the Quinn Group&#x27;s property, and an executive&#x27;s car was burnt out at his home.

On 11 November 2011, Quinn said that he had applied for voluntary bankruptcy in Belfast, and issued a statement asking the media to consider his views as well as the bank&#x27;s. The case was filed under his legal name of John Ignatius Quinn, using an address in Northern Ireland, and he admitted debts of €194m. Within days the IBRC said it would challenge the Belfast application in the commercial court in Dublin, alleging that Quinn had only used a Republic of Ireland address in directors&#x27; filings for 95 companies and none in Northern Ireland (at the time, personal bankruptcies lasted for 12 years in the Republic, but only for 1 year in Northern Ireland).

However a check of the electoral register for County Cavan clearly showed Quinn registered as a resident of the Republic of Ireland, having a vote in all elections, obviously contradicting the evidence given to the Belfast Court that he was only resident in County Fermanagh.

On 10 January 2012 the High Court in Belfast annulled the Bankruptcy Order against Quinn, and later that day the High Court in Dublin agreed to expedite the hearing of a petition to render him bankrupt in the Republic of Ireland. He was declared bankrupt in the Republic of Ireland on 16 January 2012.

In July 2012, Seán Quinn, his son Seán Jr and Peter Darragh Quinn were served with around 30 coercive court orders intended to reverse asset-stripping measures, after courts had earlier found that all three acted in contempt of orders restraining asset-stripping. Seán Quinn was not jailed as the judge agreed to a request by IBRC that he remain free to secure compliance with the coercive orders. However, representatives of IBRC have complained that Seán Quinn Sr. has &quot;done nothing to purge his contempt and reverse the asset stripping since the July 20th coercive orders were made&quot;. The bank was concerned that asset-stripping was still going on and that assets could be &quot;irretrievably lost&quot;. Seán Quinn was sentenced by Ms Justice Elizabeth Dunne at the High Court in Dublin on 2 November 2012 to 9 weeks in jail, noting that &quot;In my view he has only himself to blame.&quot;

Quinn was released from Mountjoy Prison on 3 January 2013, although he had been allowed to attend the christening of his granddaughter in December. On 24 January, a two-day cross-examination began in court of all five adult children of Quinn. The cross-examination was conducted by lawyers for IBRC and the goal was to establish whether the members of the Quinn family have complied with court orders to provide full details of their bank accounts and other assets. As it turned out, substantial sums of money had been paid by Russian subsidiaries of Quinn&#x27;s real estate business to his children and other family members in 2011/12. For example, Colette Quinn received €340,000 after having allegedly signed a contract &quot;without understanding it as it was in Russian&quot; and having &quot;had no documents indicating what work she was expected to do&quot;. She also admitted to being a director of &quot;about eight Cypriot companies&quot;. Most of the money has allegedly since been spent, but no receipts were available to support that claim.

Since the government liquidated IBRC in February 2013, the Quinn family has been thinking about a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the IBRC act. This act put an immediate stay on all existing legal proceedings against IBRC, including one brought by the Quinn family which claims that they are not liable for a €2.34bn loan made to Quinn by Anglo Irish. A court hearing on the validity of the stay has been set for 7 March.

In July 2013 Mr Justice Peter Kelly of the High Court said that it was &quot;simply incredible&quot; to accept claims by five Quinn children and three of their spouses that they could not produce documents about their alleged employment by Russian companies. He said they had been paid &quot;very large&quot; sums that together came to nearly two million euro &quot;in a very strange way&quot;. In a judgement he said that they had made &quot;substandard&quot; disclosure of documents and directed defendands (except Brenda Quinn – not employed by any company in IPG) to make fuller disclosures about their &quot;highly lucrative&quot; contracts of employment with IPG companies. The full hearing was then parked pending legal proceedings against some former executives of Anglo Irish Bank.

==Overseas business==
The Quinn Group had expanded into the hospitality industry overseas, with hotels in the Czech Republic, United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Poland. The Quinn Group took control of the Prague Hilton, the largest five-star hotel in Prague, in 2004. It paid €145 million for the 788-room Hilton and the Ibis Karlin. The group also acquired the Hilton Hotel in Sofia, Bulgaria.
 In 2005 the group bought The De Vere Belfry hotel and golf course in England. In 2004 Quinn Direct insurance expanded into the UK motor and commercial insurance market. Quinn Direct Insurance sponsored the British Masters tournament there in May 2006.

On 7 March 2007, Quinn spoke publicly for the first time in 10 years at a conference at the Slieve Russell hotel organised by the Cavan County Enterprise Board, at which he outlined the strategic aims of the Quinn Group in the immediate future. As of April 2011 Quinn and the Quinn family no longer have any role in the management, operations or ownership of the Quinn Group.

The currently ongoing litigation about asset-stripping involves former properties of Quinn&#x27;s in Ukraine and Russia. In Kyiv, the IBRC has been trying to establish control over the Univermag &quot;Ukraina&quot; mall – so far unsuccessfully. In fact, IBRC has hired Russian Alfa Group&#x27;s asset recovery arm to enforce its claims. In Russia, IBRC is still struggling to establish its control over the Kutuzoff (or Kutuzov) Tower.

==Personal life==
Quinn was born in Derrylin, County Fermanagh, near the border with County Cavan. In the 1960s, there was much poverty in the area and few diversions other than football, a pursuit at which Quinn spent much of his teenage years. He and his brother Peter played Gaelic football for Teemore Shamrocks. The team won the Fermanagh County Championship in 1969, the first for the club since 1935. The club won three more county titles in the 1970s, and Seán Quinn eventually captained the Fermanagh county team.

Peter became a financial advisor, and in 1990 he was elected President of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Ireland&#x27;s largest sporting and cultural organisation, a position he held between 1991 and 1994.

The Quinn Group was also an important sponsor of Fermanagh GAA. Quinn&#x27;s involvement in the GAA was, in the words of one commentator, &quot;a constant theme throughout the group&quot;. In the words of one associate, &quot;The GAA forms a big part of Seán&#x27;s life. Aside from that, he drinks the occasional jar in pubs in Ballyconnell and enjoys the odd game of poker.&quot; Quinn also donated land to Kildallan GFC, which was used in the development of a training field.

On 18 May 1999, Quinn was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws from NUI Maynooth. He also holds an Honorary Doctorate from Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (QUB).

Quinn is married to Patricia, and they have five children. His children – Seán Jnr, Colette, Ciara, Aoife and Brenda – all work in the family business. His son, Seán Jnr, lined out for the Fermanagh minor team. Collette Quinn was also director of BOUVERIE NO.1 LIMITED Ultimate Holding Company QUINN PROPERTY INVESTMENTS LIMITED, Shareholder funds -£87,531,000 – now in liquidation [creditsafe.uk]

In 2012, Quinn was jailed for three months for contempt of court, having allegedly engaged in asset stripping, e.g., by arranging a payment of US$500,000 to the general director of Quinn Properties Ukraine, just before losing control of the company. Quinn lives with his wife and family in Ballyconnell, Tullyhaw, County Cavan, next to his Slieve Russell Hotel and just down the road from his birthplace in Derrylin.

<text>General Sir Edward Paget (3 November 1775 – 13 May 1849) was a British Army officer.

==Career==
Born the fourth son of Henry Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge, Edward Paget became a cornet in the 1st Regiment of Life Guards in 1792. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Caernarvon Boroughs from 1796 to 1806.

In 1808, he was with John Moore in Gothenburg to assist the Swedish in the Finnish War. Moore&#x27;s disagreements with Gustavus IV soon led to their being sent home where they were ordered to Portugal.
He served in the British Army during the Peninsular War commanding the reserve at the Battle of Corunna in 1809 and then conducting the advance to Oporto in 1809, during which he lost his right arm. He was second in command under Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington in 1811 and was captured by French cavalry in 1812 and kept a prisoner for two years until the end of the War.

From 1816 to 1821 he was a Groom of the Bedchamber in the service of George IV, including a period 1816-1820 when the latter was Prince Regent during the mental illness of his father, George III.

Briefly serving as the Governor of Ceylon in 1822, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, India on 13 January 1823 and conducted the Burmese campaigns of 1824 to 1825, relinquishing his role of as Commander-in-Chief on 7 October 1825. He commanded the British troops who suppressed the Barrackpore mutiny of 1824. In 1826 he was appointed Governor of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was also Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 1837 until 1849.

His eldest brother Henry William, 2nd Earl of Uxbridge (1768–1854), was in 1815 created Marquess of Anglesey and is best remembered for leading the charge of the heavy cavalry at the Battle of Waterloo. The third eldest brother, Sir Arthur Paget (1771–1840), was an eminent diplomat during the Napoleonic Wars, the fifth, Sir Charles Paget (1778–1839), served with distinction in the navy, and rose to the rank of vice-admiral.

<text>Diet Pepsi, currently stylised in all caps as PEPSI DIET, is a diet carbonated cola soft drink produced by PepsiCo, introduced in 1964 as a variant of Pepsi with no sugar. First test marketed in 1963 under the name Patio Diet Cola, it was re-branded as &quot;Diet Pepsi&quot; the following year, becoming the first diet cola to be distributed on a national scale in the United States. In the 1960s and 1970s, its competition consisted of the Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s subsequently discontinued Tab. The United States represents the largest single market for Diet Pepsi.

== History ==
Diet Pepsi was originally test marketed in the United States under the name Patio in 1963. Following a positive reception attributed to the shifting dietary habits and preferences among Baby Boomers, the drink was launched nationally as Diet Pepsi the following year. It became the first diet cola to be distributed on a national scale in the US. Distribution was extended to the United Kingdom in 1983, where it is also referred to as Pepsi Diet.

Distribution has since expanded to other countries around the world; though an alternate name is used in certain countries. In Italy, Czechia, Poland, Argentina, Spain Greece, Turkey,
Russia, Ukraine, and Brazil, the beverage is known as &quot;Pepsi Light&quot;.

Diet Pepsi competed primarily with The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s Tab in the 1960s and 1970s; however, The Coca-Cola Company introduced Diet Coke in 1982, which has since been the principal competing product to Diet Pepsi. As of 2010, Diet Pepsi represented a 5.3 percent share of all carbonated soft drink sales in the United States, and was ranked as the #7 soft drink brand by volume. In the same year, Diet Coke was recorded as having a 9.9 percent market share.

In December 2012, an AP article reported that Diet Pepsi was changing its sweetener to sucralose ahead of a major rebranding of the soft drink set for January 2013. In 2015, some people on Facebook and Twitter expressed their distaste for the new formula. In response, Pepsi revived its aspartame formulation, as &quot;Diet Pepsi Classic Sweetener Blend&quot; for US markets in September 2016, and it was sold alongside the new formula. PepsiCo later announced plans to revert Diet Pepsi&#x27;s sweetener from sucralose to aspartame. The new formulation was released marketwide on February 25, 2018.

==Flavor variations==
Additional variations of Diet Pepsi have been introduced over the years, wherein other flavors (such as wild cherry, vanilla, lemon, and lime) have been added to the cola. A caffeine-free version of Diet Pepsi is also produced. In Australia, this variant is known as Pepsi Light Caffeine Free and has a gold label. It&#x27;s only available in 1.25 litre bottles, and the ingredients are listed as Carbonated Water, Caramel Color, Phosphoric Acid, Aspartame, Sodium Benzoate, Acesulfame Potassium, Flavour (Natural), and Citric Acid. The availability and brand identification of Diet Pepsi flavor variants varies by country. In addition to Diet Pepsi, PepsiCo also produces the low-calorie colas Pepsi Max and Pepsi Zero Sugar, depending on the country.

==Composition==

In the United States, Diet Pepsi is marketed as having zero calories, as FDA guidelines categorize products with fewer than five calories per serving to be labeled as containing &quot;zero calories&quot;.

Though Diet Pepsi is represented worldwide as a low- or no-calorie beverage, the ingredients comprising its makeup vary in some cases by the country of origin. In the US, its ingredients are recorded as &quot;carbonated water, caramel color, aspartame, phosphoric acid, potassium benzoate (preserves freshness), caffeine, citric acid, natural flavor, acesulfame potassium; phenylketonurics: contains phenylalanine&quot;. In Canada, the ingredient listing reads: &quot;carbonated water, caramel color, phosphoric acid, aspartame (124 mg/355 ml, contains phenylalanine), sodium benzoate, caffeine, flavor, acesulfame potassium (32 mg/355ml), citric acid, dimethylpolysiloxane&quot;. Comparatively in the UK, Diet Pepsi is listed as consisting of &quot;carbonated water, colour (caramel E150d), flavorings (including caffeine), phosphoric acid, sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame K), acidity regulator (sodium citrate), preservative (sodium benzoate), citric acid, contains a source of phenylalanine&quot;.

The initial formulation of Diet Pepsi was sweetened with the artificial sweetener saccharin, although concerns over saccharin emerged in the 1970s, prompting a shift to an alternative sweetener, aspartame, which was marketed as the brand NutraSweet, in 1983. Aspartame has been the subject of controversy, most notably in 1996 following a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report on concerns alleging that aspartame might be linked to the development of brain tumors in humans. Critics of aspartame have expressed concerns that numerous health risks may be associated with its consumption; however, peer-reviewed comprehensive review articles and independent reviews by governmental regulatory bodies have analyzed the published research on the safety of aspartame and have described it as safe for consumption at current levels. Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by regulatory agencies in their respective countries, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.K. Food Standards Agency, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and Health Canada.

==Packaging and logo==
When it was first introduced in 1964, Diet Pepsi was packaged in glass bottles, and was also made available in can format. In 1994, Diet Pepsi became the first product to list a &quot;freshness date&quot; on each individual can and bottle, a practice that would later become a widespread standard in the packaged food and beverage industry. As of 2020, the product is distributed in plastic bottles, cans, and glass bottles, as well as via soda fountains in retail operations such as restaurants and convenience stores.

The logo used in the packaging and advertisement of Diet Pepsi has changed multiple times since its original iteration. In October 2008, PepsiCo announced it would be redesigning its logo and re-branding many of its products, including Diet Pepsi. At this time the brand&#x27;s blue and red Pepsi Globe logo became a series of &quot;smiles,&quot; with the central white band arcing at different angles depending on the product. In the case of Diet Pepsi, the logo consisted of the small &quot;smile&quot;. Starting in mid-2010, all Pepsi variants, both regular and diet, began using the original &quot;smile&quot; logo.

The Classic Sweetener Blend variety was distinguished by its use of the 2003-2006 wordmark along with the &quot;smile&quot; logo, and a light blue label background in contrast to the modern formulation&#x27;s silver label. By mid-2017, packages of Classic Sweetener Blend dropped the 2003 wordmark and began using the modernized wordmark instead. With the restoration of aspartame as the main sweetener in the regular version, the alternate label was dropped, and packages bore the title &quot;Classic Diet Pepsi Taste&quot; which is very reminiscent to the &quot;Coca-Cola Classic&quot; title that was in use from 1985 to 2009, when New Coke received backlash.

==Advertising and promotion==

While it was initially advertised alongside Pepsi, Diet Pepsi began to be promoted independently in the late 1960s. The first television advertisement to feature Diet Pepsi as a standalone product was &quot;Girlwatchers,&quot; which placed focus on the cosmetic aspects of the beverage. The musical jingle from this ad generated popular culture appeal to the extent that it was eventually recorded and played on the radio, and later became a Top 40 hit.

Since its inception, musicians, professional athletes, actors and actresses have been featured prominently in the promotion of Diet Pepsi. In 1985, immediately following Super Bowl XIX, the game&#x27;s respective quarterbacks, Joe Montana (of the San Francisco 49ers) and Dan Marino (of the Miami Dolphins), met in a hallway of what appeared to be a football stadium. Montana, of the winning 49ers, buys Marino a Diet Pepsi, and Marino promises to buy the drink the next time. A Diet Pepsi advertisement in the same year featured Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to run for vice-president in the U.S. When the feature film &quot;Top Gun&quot; was released on home video cassette in 1987, it was promoted via television advertisements – consisting of a Top Gun pilot flying upside down while holding a bottle of Diet Pepsi – which were paid for by Pepsi. In exchange, the film&#x27;s production studio, Paramount Pictures, included a 60-second Diet Pepsi advertisement on all Top Gun VHS tapes. The resulting cross-promotion was the first of its kind, and after it set record videocassette sales, it was described as &quot;the beginning of a trend&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Michael J. Fox appeared in commercials for Diet Pepsi, including a memorable commercial that featured him making a robot clone of himself. In that commercial, Fox&#x27;s girlfriend (played by Lori Loughlin) shows up and accidentally hits Fox with the door, causing him to fall down a chute into the basement. The girlfriend takes the robot clone on a date and leaves the real Fox trapped.

During the early 1990s, R&amp;B singer Ray Charles was featured in a series of Diet Pepsi ads featuring the brand&#x27;s then-current tagline, &quot;You got the right one, baby!&quot; Supermodel Cindy Crawford became a recurring celebrity endorser for the Diet Pepsi brand at this time as well, beginning with a 1991 television ad in which she purchases a can of the drink from a vending machine on a hot summer day. Cindy Crawford was also brought back in 2002 to introduce a new packaging design for Diet Pepsi, and again in 2005 to promote the revised slogan &quot;Light, crisp, refreshing&quot; with an ad which debuted during Super Bowl XXXIX. In 2005 and 2006, recording artist Gwen Stefani appeared in advertisements related to a campaign in which codes printed underneath Diet Pepsi bottle caps could be redeemed for music downloads on Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store.

<doc id="1055001" wikidata="Q1777836" url="?curid=1055001" title="Contra-rotating propellers">
<text>Aircraft equipped with contra-rotating propellers (CRP) coaxial contra-rotating propellers, or high-speed propellers, apply the maximum power of usually a single piston engine or turboprop engine to drive a pair of coaxial propellers in contra-rotation. Two propellers are arranged one behind the other, and power is transferred from the engine via a planetary gear or spur gear transmission. Although contra-rotating propellers are also known as &quot;counter-rotating propellers&quot;, the term is much more widely used when referring to airscrews on separate non-coaxial shafts turning in opposite directions.

== Operation==
When airspeed is low, the mass of the air flowing through the propeller disk (thrust) causes a significant amount of tangential or rotational air flow to be created by the spinning blades. The energy of this tangential air flow is wasted in a single-propeller design, and causes handling problems at low speed as the air strikes the vertical stabilizer, causing the aircraft to yaw left or right, depending on the direction of propeller rotation. To use this wasted effort, the placement of a second propeller behind the first takes advantage of the disturbed airflow.

A well designed contra-rotating propeller will have no rotational air flow, pushing a maximum amount of air uniformly through the propeller disk, resulting in high performance and low induced energy loss. It also serves to counter the asymmetrical torque effect of a conventional propeller (see P-factor). Some contra-rotating systems were designed to be used at takeoff for maximum power and efficiency under such conditions, and allowing one of the propellers to be disabled during cruise to extend flight time.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The torque on the aircraft from a pair of contra-rotating propellers effectively cancels out.

Contra-rotating propellers have been found to be between 6% and 16% more efficient than normal propellers.

However they can be very noisy, with increases in noise in the axial (forward and aft) direction of up to 30 dB, and tangentially 10 dB. Most of this extra noise can be found in the higher frequencies. These substantial noise problems limit commercial applications. One possibility is to enclose the contra-rotating propellers in a shroud. It is also helpful if the tip speed or the loading of the blades is reduced, if the aft propeller has fewer blades or a smaller diameter than the fore propeller, or if the spacing between the aft and fore propellers is increased.

The efficiency of a contra-rotating propeller is somewhat offset by its mechanical complexity and the added weight of this gearing that makes the aircraft heavier, thus some performance is sacrificed to carry it. Nonetheless, coaxial contra-rotating propellers and rotors have been used in several military aircraft, such as the Tupolev Tu-95 &quot;Bear&quot;.

They are also being examined for use in airliners.

==Use in aircraft==
While several nations experimented with contra-rotating propellers in aircraft, only the United Kingdom and Soviet Union produced them in large numbers. The first aircraft to be fitted with a contra-rotating propeller to fly was in the US when two inventors from Ft Worth, Texas tested the concept on an aircraft.

===United Kingdom===
A contra-rotating propeller was patented by F. W. Lanchester in 1907.

Some of the more successful British aircraft with contra-rotating propellers are the Avro Shackleton, powered by the Rolls-Royce Griffon engine, and the Fairey Gannet, which used the Double Mamba Mk.101 engine. In the Double Mamba two separate power sections drove one propeller each, allowing one power section (engine) to be shut down in flight, increasing endurance.

Another naval aircraft, the Westland Wyvern had contra-rotating propellers. The Martin-Baker MB 5 test aircraft also used this propeller type.

Later variants of the Supermarine Spitfire and Seafire used the Griffon with contra-rotating props. In the Spitfire/Seafire and Shackleton&#x27;s case the primary reason for using contra-rotating propellers was to increase the propeller blade-area, and hence absorb greater engine power, within a propeller diameter limited by the height of the aircraft&#x27;s undercarriage. The Short Sturgeon used two Merlin 140s with contra-rotating propellers.

The Bristol Brabazon prototype airliner used eight Bristol Centaurus engines driving four pairs of contra-rotating propellers, each engine driving a single propeller.

The post-war SARO Princess prototype flying boat airliner also had eight of its ten engines driving contra-rotating propellers.

===USSR, Russia and Ukraine===
In the 1950s, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Kuznetsov Design Bureau developed the NK-12 turboprop. It drives an eight-blade contra-rotating propeller and, at , it is the most powerful turboprop in service. Four NK-12 engines power the Tupolev Tu-95 &quot;Bear&quot;, the only turboprop bomber to enter service, as well as one of the fastest propeller-driven aircraft. The Tu-114, an airliner derivative of the Tu-95, holds the world speed record for propeller aircraft. The Tu-95 was also the first Soviet bomber to have intercontinental range. The Tu-126 AEW aircraft and Tu-142 maritime patrol aircraft are two more NK-12 powered designs derived from the Tu-95.

The NK-12 engine powers another well-known Soviet aircraft, the Antonov An-22 Antheus, a heavy-lift cargo aircraft. At the time of its introduction, the An-22 was the largest aircraft in the world and is still by far the world&#x27;s largest turboprop-powered aircraft. From the 1960s through the 1970s, it set several world records in the categories of maximum payload-to-height ratio and maximum payload lifted to altitude.

Of lesser note is the use of the NK-12 engine in the A-90 Orlyonok, a mid-size Soviet ekranoplan. The A-90 uses one NK-12 engine mounted at the top of its T-tail, along with two turbofans installed in the nose.

In the 1980s, Kuznetsov continued to develop powerful contra-rotating engines. The NK-110, which was tested in the late 1980s, had a contra-rotating propeller configuration with four blades in front and four in back, like the NK-12. Its was smaller than the NK-12&#x27;s diameter, but it produced a power output of , delivering a takeoff thrust of . Even more powerful was the NK-62, which was in development throughout most of the decade. The NK-62 had an identical propeller diameter and blade configuration to the NK-110, but it offered a higher takeoff thrust of . The associated NK-62M had a takeoff thrust of , and it could deliver of emergency thrust. Unlike the NK-12, however, these later engines were not adopted by any of the aircraft design bureaus.

In 1994, Antonov produced the An-70, a heavy transport aircraft. It is powered by four Progress D-27 propfan engines driving contra-rotating propellers. The characteristics of the D-27 engine and its propeller make it a propfan, a hybrid between a turbofan engine and a turboprop engine.

===United States===

The United States worked with several prototypes, including the Northrop XB-35, XB-42 Mixmaster, the Douglas XTB2D Skypirate, the Curtiss XBTC, the A2J Super Savage, the Boeing XF8B, the XP-56 Black Bullet, the Fisher P-75 Eagle and the tail-sitting Convair XFY &quot;Pogo&quot; and Lockheed XFV &quot;Salmon&quot; VTOL fighters and the Hughes XF-11 reconnaissance plane. The Convair R3Y Tradewind flying boat entered service with contra-rotating propellers. However, both piston-engined and turboprop-powered propeller-driven aircraft were reaching their zenith and new technological developments such as the advent of the pure turbojet and turbofan engines, both without propellers, meant that the designs were quickly eclipsed.

The US propeller manufacturer, Hamilton Standard, bought a Fairey Gannet in 1983 to study the effects of counter rotation on propeller noise and blade vibratory stresses. The Gannet was particularly suitable because the independently-driven propellers provided a comparison between counter and single rotation.

===Ultralight applications===
An Austrian company, Sun Flightcraft, distributes a contra-rotating gearbox for use on Rotax 503 and 582 engines on ultralight and microlight aircraft. The Coax-P was developed by Hans Neudorfer of NeuraJet and allows powered hang-gliders and parachutes to develop 15 to 20 percent more power while reducing torque moments. The manufacturer also reports reduced noise levels from dual contra-rotating props using the Coax-P gearbox.

<text>Robert Menasse (born 21 June 1954) is an Austrian writer.

==Biography==
Menasse was born in Vienna. As an undergraduate, he studied German studies, philosophy and political science in Vienna, Salzburg and Messina. In 1980 he completed his PhD thesis &quot;Der Typus des Außenseiters im Literaturbetrieb. Am Beispiel Hermann Schürrer&quot; (&quot;The outsider phenotype within literature&quot;).
Between 1981 and 1988 Menasse worked as a junior lecturer at the Institute of Literature Theory at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. He has been working as a freelance publicist, columnist and translator of novels from Portuguese into German ever since.

His first novel &quot;Sinnliche Gewissheit&quot;, published in 1988, is a semi-autobiographical tale of Austrians living in exile in Brazil. 
The magazine &quot;Literatur und Kritik&quot; published Menasse&#x27;s first poem (&quot;Kopfwehmut&quot;) in 1989. 
His later novels were &quot;Selige Zeiten, brüchige Welt&quot; (1991, translated into English as &quot;Wings of Stone&quot; ), &quot;Schubumkehr&quot; (1995, Engl. &quot;Reverse Thrust&quot;) and &quot;Die Vertreibung aus der Hölle&quot; (2001, Engl. &quot;Expulsion from Hell&quot;).

Menasse&#x27;s language is at times playful and at times subtly sarcastic. Recurring themes in his
novels are loneliness and alienation within human relationships and as a result of his character&#x27;s lives&#x27; circumstances. In his work Menasse often criticises what he sees as the latent form of antisemitism still widespread in the German-speaking world today.

Menasse has also written some essays on Austria (especially on Austrian identity and history; &quot;Land ohne Eigenschaften&quot; (1992) a.o.). More recently, he wrote about the future of Europe and the European Union, criticizing tendencies of re-nationalization (especially in Germany, but also elsewhere) and anti-European integration movements, which he interprets as a reaction to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and its aftermath (Euro crisis) (&quot;Der europäische Landbote&quot;, 2012).

Since returning to Europe from Brazil, Menasse has mainly lived in the cities of Berlin, Vienna and Amsterdam. He currently lives in Vienna and is married. Since 2011 Menasse has been curating a writer in residence programme with the one world foundation in Sri Lanka.

His books have been translated in over twenty languages, among others: Arabic, Bask, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish, and Swedish.

Today, Menasse lives alternately in Vienna, in the Waldviertel (Forest Quarter) in Lower Austria, and in Brussels. He is the son of the footballer Hans Menasse and the brother of the journalist and writer Eva Menasse.

==Novels==
Robert Menasse&#x27;s first short story &quot;Nägelbeißen&quot; (Engl. Nail-Biting) was published in the journal &quot;Neue Wege&quot; in 1973. From 1975 to 1980 he worked on his unfinished and unpublished novel &quot;Kopfwehmut&quot; (Engl. Mind&#x27;s Melancholy), a social novel set in 1970s Vienna. His first published novel, &quot;Sinnliche Gewißheit&quot; (Engl. Sensual Certainty) appeared in 1988 as the first part of a trilogy started in Brazil &quot;Trilogie der Entgeisterung&quot; (Engl. Trilogy of Dismay), which also includes the 1991 novel &quot;Selige Zeiten, brüchige Welt&quot; (Engl. &quot;Wings of Stone&quot;, 2000), which is at once a crime story, a philosophical novel and a Jewish family saga, and finally the 1995 novel &quot;Schubumkehr&quot; (Engl. &quot;Reverse Thrust&quot;, 2000) as well as the postscript Phänomenologie der Entgeisterung (1995, Engl. Phenomenology of Dismay).

In &quot;Schubumkehr&quot;, against the background of the private life of the literature teacher Roman, who was already introduced in &quot;Selige Zeiten, brüchige Welt&quot;, Menasse describes the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 and the breakdown of the familiar order in a small Austrian village. This novel, which is not least an artistic treatment of the spirit of the age, was awarded the Grimmelshausen Prize in 1999 and made the author a household name. As suggested already by the title of the novel &quot;Schubumkehr&quot; and in the &quot;Trilogie der Entgeisterung&quot; Menasse turns Hegel&#x27;s Phenomenology of Spirit on its head. In contrast to Hegel, who assumes a development of human consciousness to all-embracing spirit, Menasse postulates a regressive development, whose final stage will be &quot;sensual certainty&quot;, according to Hegel the most naïve form of consciousness.

In his novel &quot;Die Vertreibung aus der Hölle&quot; (2001; Engl. Expulsion from Hell) Menasse casts doubt on the objectivity of history, coupled with the personal history of the author and his Jewish roots. As a spin-off of his researches on the character and real person Menasseh Ben Israel for his novel &quot;Die Vertreibung aus der Hölle&quot; translated in ten languages, Menasse formulated the hypothesis of Abaelard‘s influence on Menasseh Ben Israel and Spinoza, published among others in his essay &quot;Enlightenment as Harmonious Strategy&quot;. In 2007 he published &quot;Don Juan de la Mancha&quot;, where he tells of more or less fictitious events from the (love) life of the newspaper editor Nathan – a mixture of listlessness, drive, lust and the search for the fulfilment of love. As a character, Nathan stands for the generation that was socialised in the 1970s with the claim for the “sexual revolution&quot;.

In 2017 Menasse published his analytical novel &quot;Die Hauptstadt&quot; (The Capital), which has been described as the first novel about Brussels as the European Union&#x27;s capital, and which received the German Book Prize. The story is focused on officials from the Department of Culture, who are expected to add polish to the image of the EU Commission on its birthday. The main character in this novel, Pote, explores his family&#x27;s history. This is to be accomplished with a &quot;Big Jubilee Project&quot; event with concentration camp survivors in Auschwitz. The life stories of characters lead the reader into six EU countries. The stage director Tom Kühnel and the dramaturg Ralf Fiedler translated the novel into a theatrical version with about twenty characters played by seven actors, which was premiered in January 2018 at the Theater am Neumarkt in Zürich. The English translation, &quot;The Capital&quot; by Jamie Bulloch, was published by MacLehose Press in February 2019.

==Essays and writings on cultural theory==
In his political and journalistic work, Menasse is seen as an &quot;old-style Enlightenment thinker,&quot; whose intellectual predecessors are especially Hegel and Marx but also Georg Lukács, Ernst Bloch and the philosophers of the Frankfurt School. Essays like &quot;Die sozialpartnerschaftliche Ästhetik&quot; (1990; The Aesthetics of Social Partnership) and &quot;Das Land ohne Eigenschaften&quot; (1992; The Country without Qualities), which brought Menasse fame as an essayist, but also provoked criticism for &quot;fouling his own nest,&quot; were followed in time by the essay collections &quot;Hysterien und andere historische Irrtümer&quot; (1996; Hysterics and Other Historical Errors) and &quot;Dummheit ist machbar&quot; (1999; Stupidity is Doable), &quot;Erklär mir Österreich&quot; (2000; Explain Austria to Me) and &quot;Das war Österreich&quot; (2005; That Was Austria). In these texts the author deals in critical-ironic way with political history, mentality history and literary history of the second Republic of Austria, takes a position on the current cultural policy situation in his homeland and recurrently draws attention to the latent continuity of Austrofascism.
Since 2005, i.e. since his Frankfurt Poetics Lecture, &quot;Die Zerstörung der Welt als Wille und Vorstellung&quot; (The Destruction of the World as Will and Representation), Menasse has increasingly devoted his essays to themes around the EU and globalisation. In this European or worldwide context Menasse criticises in particular what he sees as the deficits in democratic policies and the idea that these deficits are structurally determined, which he argues obscures the prospects of possible alternatives. In doing so he does not oppose the European Union in principle but bases his critique of democratic deficits especially in the influence and power of individual nation states, while valuing positively the purely European institutions, such as the Commission. In &quot;Der Europäische Landbote&quot; (2012; Engl. transl. 2016 as &quot;Enraged Citizens, European Peace and Democratic Deficits: Or Why the Democracy Given to Us Must Become One We Fight For The European Messenger&quot;), he draws a portrait of the non-petty-minded supranational organs and bureaucracies of the EU in Brussels and further develops the &quot;Habsburg Myth&quot; of Claudio Magris into a &quot;European Myth&quot;. This also leads to a different and more positive retrospective of the Habsburg Monarchy. In this connection Menasse also speaks in favour of the specific vision and its realization of a “European Republic” formulated together with the political scientist Ulrike Guérot on the basis of a Europe of regions beyond the nation states.

=== Controversy about fake quotations ===

In December 2018, Welt am Sonntag revealed that Robert Menasse had fabricated several quotes attributed to Walter Hallstein (1901-1982), one of the founding fathers of the EU) to support his argument for overcoming nation states. Menasse had been using these alleged quotes in many of his articles, essays and speeches since 2013, and they had been taken up in parliamentary debates and publications by other authors. Menasse defended himself arguing that these sentences reflected what Hallstein had meant and that Hallstein &quot;would have had nothing against&quot; Menasse invoking his authority in this way. However, historian Heinrich August Winkler disputed Menasse&#x27;s interpretation of Hallstein&#x27;s actual statements on the matter.

<doc id="1055010" wikidata="Q373207" url="?curid=1055010" title="Oxo (food)">
<text>Oxo (stylized OXO) is a brand of food products, including stock cubes, herbs and spices, dried gravy, and yeast extract. The original product was the beef stock cube, and the company now also markets chicken and other flavour cubes, including versions with Chinese and Indian spices. The cubes are broken up and used as flavouring in meals or gravy or dissolved into boiling water to produce a bouillon.

In the United Kingdom, the OXO brand belongs to Premier Foods. In South Africa, the Oxo brand is owned and manufactured by Mars, Incorporated and in Canada is owned and manufactured by Knorr.

== History ==
Around 1840, Justus von Liebig developed a concentrated meat extract. Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat Company (Lemco; established in the United Kingdom) promoted it, starting in 1866. The original product was a viscous liquid, containing only meat extract and 4% salt. In 1899, the company introduced the trademark Oxo; the origin of the name is unknown, but presumably comes from the word &quot;ox.&quot; Since the cost of liquid Oxo remained beyond the reach of many families, the company launched a research project to develop a solid version that could be sold in cubes for a penny. After much research, Oxo produced their first cubes in 1910 and further increased Oxo&#x27;s popularity. During World War I, 100 million Oxo cubes were provided to the British armed forces, all of them individually hand-wrapped.

The Vestey Group acquired Lemco in 1924, and the factory was renamed El Anglo. Vestey merged with Brooke Bond in 1968, which was in turn acquired by Unilever in 1984. Unilever sold the Oxo brand to the Campbell Soup Company in 2001, and Premier Foods bought Campbell&#x27;s UK operation in 2006. This sale included sites at both Worksop and Kings Lynn. The Worksop plant currently produces Oxo cubes.

In South Africa, Oxo is now a brand of Mars, Incorporated. The only product marketed under the Oxo brand in South Africa was a yeast-extract-based spread. The product also contained a small portion of beef extract, giving it a slightly &quot;beefier&quot; taste than other yeast extracts. At the beginning of 2015, Mars Consumer Products Africa (Pty), Ltd discontinued Oxo spread in South Africa, with no prior communication to the public.

==Marketing==
In 1908, Oxo (alongside Odol mouthwash and Indian Foot Powder) was one of the sponsors of the London Olympic Games (despite claims by Coca-Cola of being the &quot;first&quot; commercial sponsor of the games) and supplied marathon runners with Oxo drinks &quot;to fortify them.&quot; During the first half of the 20th century, Oxo was promoted through the issue of recipes, gifts, and sponsorships, before fading into the background as a part of the fabric of English life in the latter parts of the century.
In the 1920s, the Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat Company acquired the a Wharf on the south bank of the river Thames in London. There they erected a factory, demolishing most of the original building and constructing a tower, with distinctive windows appearing to spell out &#x27;OXO&#x27;, which became known as the Oxo Tower

In 1958, Oxo commenced their longest running television advertising campaign, &quot;Life with Katie.&quot; Katie was played by Mary Holland, and her long-suffering husband by Peter Moynihan. The campaign ran until the early 1970s, including two seasons where the family traveled to the US to film. By this time, the couple were joined by their &quot;son.&quot;

As styles and tastes changed, Oxo moved to a more up-to-date format with Dennis Waterman as the sole face of the brand in the mid &#x27;70s.

In 1966, Oxo had a sponsored show on the offshore radio station, Wonderful Radio London. The show was presented by Tony Windsor; his assistant was a woman called &quot;Katie.&quot; Oxo presented a new recipe in each episode.

Oxo launched another long-running advertising campaign in the UK in 1983, when a second &quot;Oxo Family&quot; debuted on commercial television. The father was played by Michael Redfern, the mother was played by Lynda Bellingham, while the children were played by Blair MacKichan, Colin McCoy and Alison Reynolds. The advertisements typically featured the family sitting down to a meal at which Oxo gravy would be served. The product was not always mentioned by name, occasionally appearing only as a logo in the corner of the screen at the end of the commercial. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the family were seen to grow older, and, when the campaign was retired in 1999, the family moved out of the house.

On 11 November 2014, it was announced that a 1984 Oxo advert starring Lynda Bellingham would be screened on Christmas Day as a tribute to the actress, who had died of colon cancer the previous month. It was aired during a commercial break of &quot;Coronation Street.&quot;
