<text>I Am the Cheese is a young adult novel by the American writer Robert Cormier, published in 1977.

==Plot==

The novel opens with protagonist Adam Farmer biking from his home in the fictional town of Monument, Massachusetts, (based on Cormier&#x27;s hometown of Leominster, Massachusetts) to visit his father in the fictional town of Rutterburg, Vermont. The story alternates with transcripts of tapes between a &quot;subject&quot; and a doctor, Brint. The subject receives psychotherapy and is interrogated by Brint.

As the book continues, it is revealed that Adam is the subject, formerly Paul Delmonte of a small New York town. His father, &quot;David Farmer&quot;, was a newspaper reporter who was enrolled in the Witness Protection Program (WPP). The family moved to Monument and escaped several close calls with their identities, but Adam&#x27;s mother is killed in the penultimate chapter in a car collision, with his father fleeing the scene. Adam/Paul survives and is taken to a government mental asylum. The last chapter implies that WPP agents killed Adam/Paul&#x27;s father and reveals that Paul is regularly interrogated on the topic. Each time, Paul is unable to handle the realization of his past and embarks on a delusional bike ride across the ground of the facility. At the end of the last tape, Brint recommends that Adam is &quot;terminated&quot; or continued to be questioned.

== Characters ==

* Adam Farmer (Paul Delmonte) – teenage protagonist
* David Farmer (Anthony Delmonte) - Adam&#x27;s father, a former newspaper man. He pretends to work for an insurance company.
* Louise Farmer/Delmonte - Adam&#x27;s mother
* Amy Hertz - Adam&#x27;s friend and love interest
* Brint - Adam&#x27;s questioner and &quot;guide&quot; as his doctor
* Mr. Grey - agent in the Witness Protection Program 
* Arthur - a fat man in the town of Hookset who tells Adam of Junior Varney
* Dr. Dupont - a friendly doctor in a mental hospital; Adam is his patient
* Junior Varney - a troublemaker and thief in Hookset
* Whipper and friends - bullies in Carver
* Old man by the gas station - warns him about trusting strangers
* The elderly couple - the man helps him out of the ditch, while the woman criticizes him
*Aunt Martha - the only relative they&#x27;re allowed to talk to

==Title==

This quote is the last verse from &quot;The Farmer In The Dell&quot;, a song that Adam sings during the book:

The cheese stands alone
The cheese stands alone
Heigh-ho, the merry-o
The cheese stands alone
He sings many of these songs throughout the novel. The song contains several characters, each taking someone with them when the farmer leaves, yet the cheese has nobody.

Adam believes that he is the cheese. He is the bait in a trap. Adam is alone in the world, his mother dead and his father missing, and he lives in a hospital.

Another point is that his father had taught him the song, possibly as a way to reinforce the new name, &quot;Farmer,&quot; they had adopted.

==Literary significance and criticism==

Started in 1975, &quot;I Am the Cheese&quot; began Cormier&#x27;s experimentation with first-person, present-tense narration. When Cormier sent the manuscript to the publisher of his previous novel, &quot;The Chocolate War&quot;, he was confused and depressed, convinced that he was alienating his new young adult audience because of the complex and ambiguous story. However, &quot;I Am the Cheese&quot; proved to be a success.

==Awards and nominations==

&quot;I Am the Cheese&quot; was named to five annual book lists according to the publisher description of the 20th anniversary edition. It won the 1997 Phoenix Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association as the best English-language children&#x27;s book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book&#x27;s rise from obscurity.

==Film adaptation==

&quot;I Am the Cheese&quot; was released as a movie in 1983, directed by Robert Jiras and starring Robert MacNaughton, Hope Lange, Don Murray, Lee Richardson, Cynthia Nixon and Robert Wagner. The screenplay was written by David Lange (Hope Lange&#x27;s brother) and Robert Jiras.

<doc id="1044681" wikidata="Q24503377" url="?curid=1044681" title="Mesh">
<text>A mesh is a barrier made of interlaced strands of metal, fiber or other flexible or ductile materials. A mesh is similar to a web or a net in that it has many interwoven strands.

==Types==
* A plastic mesh may be extruded, oriented, expanded, woven or tubular. It can be made from polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, PVC or PTFE.
* A metal mesh may be woven, knitted, welded, expanded, sintered, photo-chemically etched or electroformed (screen filter) from steel or other metals.
* In clothing, mesh is loosely woven or knitted fabric that has many closely spaced holes. Knitted mesh is frequently used for modern sports jerseys and other clothing like hosiery and lingerie
* A meshed skin graft is a piece of harvested skin that has been systematically fenestrated to create a mesh-like patch. Meshing of skin grafts provides coverage of a greater surface area at the recipient site, and also allows for the egress of excess serous or sanguinous fluid, which can compromise the graft establishment via formation of haematoma or seroma. However, it results in a rather pebbled appearance upon healing that may ultimately look less aesthetically pleasing.
*Fiberglass mesh is a neatly woven, crisscross pattern of fiberglass thread that can be used to create new products such as door screens, filtration components, and reinforced adhesive tapes. It is commonly sprayed with a PVC coating to make it stronger, last longer, and to prevent skin irritation.
*Coiled wire fabric is a type of mesh that is constructed by interlocking metal wire coils via a simple corkscrew method. The resulting spirals are then woven together to create a flexible metal fabric panel. Coiled wire fabric mesh is a product that is used by architects to design commercial and residential structures. It is also used in industrial settings to protect personnel and contain debris. Additionally, coiled wire fabric mesh is used for zoo enclosures, typically aviary and small mammal exhibits. 

==Uses==
* Meshes are often used to screen out insects. Wire screens on windows and mosquito netting are meshes.
* Wire screens can be used to shield against radio frequency radiation, e.g. in microwave ovens and Faraday cages.
* Metal and nylon wire mesh filters are used in filtration.
* Wire mesh is used in guarding for secure areas and as protection in the form of vandal screens.
* Wire mesh can be fabricated to produce park benches, waste baskets and other baskets for material handling.
* Woven meshes are basic to screen printing.
* Surgical mesh is used to provide a reinforcing structure in surgical procedures like inguinal hernioplasty, and umbilical hernia repair.
* Meshes are used as drum heads in practice and electronic drum sets.
* Fence for livestock or poultry (chicken wire or hardware cloth)
* Humane animal trapping uses woven or welded wire mesh cages (chicken wire or hardware cloth) to trap wild animals like raccoons and skunks in populated areas.
* Meshes can be used for eyes in masks.

<doc id="1044683" wikidata="Q7894536" url="?curid=1044683" title="University Canada West">
<text>University Canada West (UCW) is a private, for-profit university in British Columbia, Canada. It was founded in 2005 by David F. Strong, the former president of the University of Victoria. UCW was purchased in 2008 by the Eminata Group and in 2014 sold to Global University Systems, its present owners. Based in downtown Vancouver, the university offers undergraduate and graduate programs in business and management. As of 2023, with nearly 14,000 international study permits, it is second only to Conestoga College for number of permits for post-secondary institutions in Canada. 

==History==
===Initial years (2005 – 2008)===
University Canada West was founded as a for-profit university by David Strong, the former president of the University of Victoria, and a group of investors. It was intended to cater to British Columbian students who had been turned away from the province&#x27;s public universities as well as the Asian Pacific market and had projected an eventual enrolment of 3000 students. The establishment of the university marked the first time in British Columbia that a for-profit institution had been authorized to use the designation &quot;university,&quot; the result of the province&#x27;s recently enacted, controversial Degree Authorization Act. UCW was approved in 2004 and opened its doors in 2005 in the former Blanshard Elementary School in Victoria, British Columbia. It initially offered undergraduate degrees in commerce, communications, geography, tourism, and economics and a master&#x27;s degree in business. However, the geography, tourism, and economics programs were later dropped.

In an effort to expand its program offerings, UCW bought Victoria College of Art in 2006. The intention was to start a Bachelor in Fine Arts degree. However, after the takeover, enrolment at the art college dropped drastically from 150 students to 12. The university subsequently withdrew its request to the British Columbia Degree Quality Assessment Board for approval for the new degree. UCW opened a second campus in Vancouver in 2008.

===Eminata Group ownership (2008 – 2014)===
In 2008, the university was sold to the Eminata Group. At the time of the sale, it was reported that UCW was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and struggling to attract students. Faced with declining enrolment at its Victoria campus, the university closed the site in February 2011. At the time of its closure the Victoria campus had only 24 students enrolled in academic degree programs. The announcement of the imminent closure was made one day after the deadline for a tuition refund had passed. The students were given the option of transferring to another college or to UCW&#x27;s Vancouver campus. However, some students interviewed on CBC News said their preferred college was unwilling to transfer their UCW course credits, and they could not afford moving to Vancouver.

In March 2012, a two-part investigative feature in the British Columbian paper &quot;The Province&quot; reported on student complaints at UCW and two other Canadian colleges owned by Eminata. In October of that year, the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; published an article reporting on interviews with over 30 students, graduates, faculty and former teachers and employees of UCW who &quot;alleged that it [was] a university only in name, and that many of them were duped.&quot; The article noted that the university &quot;vehemently&quot; denied the allegations that the students were misled about the value of UCW degrees saying that it had many students who secured positions in industry and government, both in Canada and abroad. At the time of the article&#x27;s publication, approximately 90% of UCW&#x27;s students were from India. Earlier that year, when student complaints about UCW had begun to surface, India&#x27;s Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University pulled out of a Memorandum of Understanding with UCW to jointly run an MBA exchange programme.

UCW&#x27;s founder David Strong had been replaced as the university&#x27;s president in December 2009. He was succeeded by Verna Magee-Shepherd, a former acting president of British Columbia Institute of Technology. Magee-Shepherd resigned in March 2012, and four months later Arthur Coren was named UCW&#x27;s new president and vice-chancellor. Coren was previously the dean of Kwantlen Polytechnic University&#x27;s business school.

===Global University Systems ownership (2014 – present)===
Eminata sold University Canada West to the Netherlands-based company Global University Systems in November 2014 at which time it had approximately 400 students enrolled in its in-person and online programs. According to a 2017 interview with Coren in &quot;The PIE News&quot; (an industry publication for the international education sector), the university&#x27;s enrolment had increased since 2014 with 80% of its students coming from outside Canada. UCW had 52 graduates in the class of 2018. Of these, 14 came from India, 4 from the Middle East, 9 from the Far East, 10 from Canada, 7 from Africa, 4 from the Middle East, 4 from Europe, and 4 from Central and South America. The majority of the graduates were on the MBA program. Since then, the university has grown exponentially, with over 14,000 students from over 110 countries as of September 2023.

In 2019, Brock Dykeman was named new president of the university. In October 2023, Bashir Makhoul, President and Vice-Chancellor at the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) in the United Kingdom was named the university&#x27;s new president and Vice-Chancellor, replacing Sheldon Levy.

In 2023, University Canada West accounted for 13,913 international study permits, more than any other post-secondary institution in British Columbia, and more than any other institution in Canada other than Conestoga College. This means, of their 14485 students, only 572 (4% of the total student body) were not on international study permits. 

==Campus==
Earlier sited on two floors of an office building on Melville Street in downtown Vancouver, the university relocated in 2014 to the nearby London Building. The 10-storey London Building is located at 626 West Pender Street and was originally built in 1912 for the London and British North American Company.

University Canada West opened a new second campus, Vancouver House, in October 2020, which can accommodate up to 3,400 students. The Vancouver House campus is part of Vancouver House development, which was named by CNN in 2019 as one of the most anticipated buildings set to shape the world in 2020.

==Ranking==
In 2021, University Canada West received a 5-star QS Stars rating, an opt-in evaluation service that require the institution to pay a fee to be rated. University Canada West is not on the list of QS World University Rankings, as it is outside top 1,500.

==Governance==
In line with the bicameral system at many other Canadian universities, the governance structure of UCW is composed of an Academic Council and a Board of Governors. The Board of Governors oversees the strategic direction of the university including its fiduciary, legal and financial responsibilities. It is composed of two members nominated by Global University Systems (the university&#x27;s owner), the university&#x27;s president, and a minimum of four members external to both the university and its owner. As of 2018, the Board of Governors was chaired by Alfred Morris. He also serves on the board of directors at two other institutions owned by Global University Systems, Arden University and University of Law. The Academic Council oversees the university&#x27;s academic programs and policies. It is composed of representatives from the university&#x27;s staff, faculty, students and alumni.

Cyndi McLeod is the current chair of the Board of Governors.

In 2023, the Academic Council was renamed the Senate.

Although UCW does not receive public funds, the British Columbia Ministry of Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills requires the institution to file audited financial statements. The institution also undergoes an annual quality review by the Degree Quality Assessment Board.

==Academics==
The university is accredited by the British Columbia Ministry of Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills, and carries the Education Quality Assurance (EQA) accreditation under the 2003 Degree Authorization Act. The university is also a member of the British Columbia Council on Admission &amp; Transfer. In 2017 the university&#x27;s bachelors and post-graduate business degrees received accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).

As of 2019 UCW offers a Bachelor of Commerce, a Bachelor of Arts in Business Communication, and an MBA. The mode of study for these degrees is either full-time on campus or part-time online. It also offers an Associate of Arts degree.

<doc id="1044685" wikidata="Q936692" url="?curid=1044685" title="Comb filter">
<text>In signal processing, a comb filter is a filter implemented by adding a delayed version of a signal to itself, causing constructive and destructive interference. The frequency response of a comb filter consists of a series of regularly spaced notches in between regularly spaced &quot;peaks&quot; (sometimes called &quot;teeth&quot;) giving the appearance of a comb.

Comb filters exist in two forms, &quot;feedforward&quot; and &quot;feedback&quot;; which refer to the direction in which signals are delayed before they are added to the input.

Comb filters may be implemented in discrete time or continuous time forms which are very similar.

==Applications==

Comb filters are employed in a variety of signal processing applications, including:

* Cascaded integrator–comb (CIC) filters, commonly used for anti-aliasing during interpolation and decimation operations that change the sample rate of a discrete-time system.
* 2D and 3D comb filters implemented in hardware (and occasionally software) in PAL and NTSC analog television decoders, reduce artifacts such as dot crawl.
* Audio signal processing, including delay, flanging, physical modelling synthesis and digital waveguide synthesis. If the delay is set to a few milliseconds, a comb filter can model the effect of acoustic standing waves in a cylindrical cavity or in a vibrating string.
* In astronomy the astro-comb promises to increase the precision of existing spectrographs by nearly a hundredfold.

In acoustics, comb filtering can arise as an unwanted artifact. For instance, two loudspeakers playing the same signal at different distances from the listener, create a comb filtering effect on the audio. In any enclosed space, listeners hear a mixture of direct sound and reflected sound. The reflected sound takes a longer, delayed path compared to the direct sound, and a comb filter is created where the two mix at the listener. Similarly, comb filtering may result from mono mixing of multiple mics, hence the 3:1 rule of thumb that neighboring mics should be separated at least three times the distance from its source to the mic.

==Discrete time implementation==
===Feedforward form===
The general structure of a feedforward comb filter is described by the difference equation: 
:formula_1

where formula_2 is the delay length (measured in samples), and is a scaling factor applied to the delayed signal. The transform of both sides of the equation yields:
:formula_3

The transfer function is defined as:
:formula_4

====Frequency response====

The frequency response of a discrete-time system expressed in the -domain is obtained by substitution formula_5 where formula_6 is the imaginary unit and formula_7 is angular frequency. Therefore, for the feedforward comb filter:
:formula_8

Using Euler&#x27;s formula, the frequency response is also given by
:formula_9

Often of interest is the &quot;magnitude&quot; response, which ignores phase. This is defined as:
:formula_10

In the case of the feedforward comb filter, this is:
:formula_11

The formula_12 term is constant, whereas the formula_13 term varies periodically. Hence the magnitude response of the comb filter is periodic.

The graphs show the periodic magnitude response for various values of formula_14 Some important properties:
*The response periodically drops to a local minimum (sometimes known as a &quot;notch&quot;), and periodically rises to a local maximum (sometimes known as a &quot;peak&quot; or a &quot;tooth&quot;).
*For positive values of formula_15 the first minimum occurs at half the delay period and repeats at even multiples of the delay frequency thereafter: 
::formula_16
*The levels of the maxima and minima are always equidistant from 1.
*When formula_17 the minima have zero amplitude. In this case, the minima are sometimes known as &quot;nulls&quot;.
*The maxima for positive values of formula_18 coincide with the minima for negative values of formula_19, and vice versa.

====Impulse response====
The feedforward comb filter is one of the simplest finite impulse response filters. Its response is simply the initial impulse with a second impulse after the delay.

====Pole–zero interpretation====
Looking again at the -domain transfer function of the feedforward comb filter:
:formula_20

the numerator is equal to zero whenever . This has solutions, equally spaced around a circle in the complex plane; these are the zeros of the transfer function. The denominator is zero at , giving poles at . This leads to a pole–zero plot like the ones shown.

===Feedback form===
Similarly, the general structure of a feedback comb filter is described by the difference equation:
:formula_21

This equation can be rearranged so that all terms in formula_22 are on the left-hand side, and then taking the transform:
:formula_23

The transfer function is therefore:
:formula_24

====Frequency response====

By substituting formula_25 into the feedback comb filter&#x27;s -domain expression:
:formula_26

the magnitude response becomes:
:formula_27

Again, the response is periodic, as the graphs demonstrate. The feedback comb filter has some properties in common with the feedforward form:
*The response periodically drops to a local minimum and rises to a local maximum.
*The maxima for positive values of formula_19 coincide with the minima for negative values of formula_15 and vice versa.
*For positive values of formula_15 the first maximum occurs at 0 and repeats at even multiples of the delay frequency thereafter:
::formula_31

However, there are also some important differences because the magnitude response has a term in the denominator:
*The levels of the maxima and minima are no longer equidistant from 1. The maxima have an amplitude of .
*The filter is only stable if is strictly less than 1. As can be seen from the graphs, as increases, the amplitude of the maxima rises increasingly rapidly.

====Impulse response====
The feedback comb filter is a simple type of infinite impulse response filter. If stable, the response simply consists of a repeating series of impulses decreasing in amplitude over time.

====Pole–zero interpretation====
Looking again at the -domain transfer function of the feedback comb filter:
:formula_32

This time, the numerator is zero at , giving zeros at . The denominator is equal to zero whenever . This has solutions, equally spaced around a circle in the complex plane; these are the poles of the transfer function. This leads to a pole–zero plot like the ones shown below.

== Continuous time implementation ==
Comb filters may also be implemented in continuous time which can be expressed in the Laplace domain as a function of the complex frequency domain parameter formula_33 analogous to the z domain. Analog circuits use some form of analog delay line for the delay element. Continuous-time implementations share all the properties of the respective discrete-time implementations.

=== Feedforward form ===
The feedforward form may be described by the equation:

:formula_34

where is the delay (measured in seconds). This has the following transfer function:

:formula_35

The feedforward form consists of an infinite number of zeros spaced along the jω axis (which corresponds to the Fourier domain).

=== Feedback form ===
The feedback form has the equation:

:formula_36

and the following transfer function:

:formula_37

The feedback form consists of an infinite number of poles spaced along the jω axis.

<doc id="1044703" wikidata="Q3492819" url="?curid=1044703" title="Spearmint (band)">
<text>Spearmint are a London-based independent band founded in 1995, comprising Shirley Lee (guitar, singing), Simon Calnan (keyboards, singing), James Parsons (guitar, bass) and Ronan Larvor (drums). 

Original bassist Martin Talbot left the band after five shows, being replaced by Parsons in September 1995. Following Talbot&#x27;s death, the band dedicated their debut album &quot;A Week Away&quot; to him in 1999. The dedication was repeated in 2009 when a 10th anniversary edition of the album was issued, including a new seven-song-cycle &#x27;Life In Reverse&#x27;, also in memory of Talbot. 

All the group&#x27;s records have been released on their own &#x27;hitBACK&#x27; label, enabling them to maintain control over their artistic output. Most recent album &#x27;Holland Park&#x27; is the 57th release on the label. 

The band have worked together continuously since 1995, even while Parsons released a side project by Telley in 2009, and Lee released a solo double-album in 2011. At various times, the group has also been aided by Dickon Edwards, Andy Lewis and Rhodri Marsden.
The group has received coverage in the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Time Out&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Uncut&quot; magazines. and were referenced in the film &quot;(500) Days of Summer&quot; wherein Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s character states “It pains me we live in a world where nobody&#x27;s heard of Spearmint.”

In 2009, Image Comics of Berkeley, California released the book &#x27;This Is A Souvenir&#x27;, a collection of graphic novellas based on the songs of Spearmint and Shirley Lee. 

Spearmint released their tenth album &#x27;This Candle Is For You&#x27; in late 2023. The album was very positive received critically, with Mojo placing it at number 53 in their Top 100 albums of 2023.

<text>The IFBB Pro Arnold Sports Festival, also known as the Arnold Schwarzenegger Sports Festival, is an annual multi-sport event consisting of professional bodybuilding (&quot;Arnold Classic&quot;), strongman (&quot;Arnold Strongman Classic&quot;), armlifting, fitness, figure, bikini and several others as a weekend expo. It was established in 1989 and is named after Arnold Schwarzenegger. The main event is held annually around late February or early March in Columbus, Ohio, by the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness Professional League (IFBB Pro League). It is considered the second-most-prestigious event in professional men&#x27;s bodybuilding, physique, figure and bikini after Joe Weider&#x27;s Olympia.
When the Ms. International competition was hosted, until 2013, it was the second-most-prestigious event in professional female bodybuilding (after Ms. Olympia).
==History==
A lucrative sports competition, the ASF offers a number of large prizes. Most notably, first prize in bodybuilding consists of a $130,000 check, a Hummer vehicle, and an Audemars Piguet watch. Since the Mr. Olympia bodybuilding title pre-dates and offers higher prize money than the ASF, a rivalry in prestige and popularity has sprung up. The ASF is always hotly contested, often with one or two competition points separating the winners.

All-star cheerleading competitions span a two-day period (usually all day Saturday, and to midday Sunday). More than 4,000 competitors entered the cheerleading event in 2014. Each team (of 15–30 cheerleaders) prepares to perform a two and one-half minute routine. After the teams&#x27; routines are complete, they are scored by a panel of judges, each judge being an expert on one area of cheerleading (jumps, tumbling, stunting, etc.). Once scoring is complete, every team entered in the competition is called to the mat for awards, during which each team has a chance of winning multiple times. The ASF&#x27;s awards consist of the following: National Champion jackets, trophies for every team, custom medals, limited edition patches and Grand Champion banners, and possible partial or full paid bid to Cheerleading World contests.

On June 7, 2013, the ASF&#x27;s event promoter, Jim Lorimer, announced that from 2014 on, the ASF&#x27;s &quot;212&quot; (a professional, men&#x27;s bodybuilding division) would permanently replace the Ms. International women&#x27;s bodybuilding competition. Lorimer, in a statement, said &quot;The Arnold Sports Festival was proud to support women&#x27;s bodybuilding through the Ms. International for the past quarter century, but in keeping with demands of our fans, the time has come to introduce the Arnold Classic 212 beginning in 2014. We are excited to create a professional competitive platform for some of the IFBB Pro League&#x27;s most popular competitors.&quot;

On March 3, 2020 Ohio governor Mike DeWine cancelled most of the Arnold Sports Festival due to the oncoming COVID-19 pandemic in Ohio, before any cases or deaths had been reported. The cancellation was widely regarded as &#x27;radical&#x27; at the time.

== Curiosities ==

* Arnold Classic Ohio is the largest multi-sport championship in the world, ahead of even the Olympics.
** There are around 20,000 athletes from more than 80 countries competing in 60 sports, while the 2024 Olympic Games brought almost 11,000 athletes in 32 sports and 48 disciplines. The Arnold is second only to the number of countries: 206 at the Olympics.
* The event also promotes several amateur sports for fans to learn about and practice.
* The Arnold Classic Ohio is the second most prestigious event in professional bodybuilding, behind only the Mr. Olympia.
* Jim Lorimer, who founded the Arnold Classic with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1989, was a special agent for the FBI.
* Like Arnold, Lorimer ventured into politics, becoming mayor of Worthington, Ohio.
* The biggest Arnold Classic Ohio champion is a woman, Iris Kyle (USA), with 7 titles (interestingly, she is also the biggest Mr. Olympia winner, with 11 titles). Among men, Dexter Jackson (USA) is the biggest winner with 5 titles.

<doc id="1044712" wikidata="Q5036225" url="?curid=1044712" title="Capri Cafaro">
<text>Capri Silvestri Cafaro (born November 21, 1977) is a former Democratic member of the Ohio Senate, representing the 32nd District from 2007 to 2016. From the Mahoning Valley, Cafaro served three terms as an Ohio State Senator (2007 to 2016), including a stint as Minority Leader from 2009 to 2012. Her district included all of Trumbull County, Ashtabula County and portions of Geauga County (including the City of Chardon; but excluding Chardon Township).

She is a TV personality, appearing as a contributor on Fox News Channel, primarily as a semi-regular co-host of the afternoon talk show &quot;Outnumbered&quot;.

==Early life, family and education==
Cafaro was born and raised in Youngstown, Ohio. Her father is shopping mall developer John Cafaro. She is of Italian descent.

She attended Youngstown private schools Kennedy School and then Ursuline High School at age 12. By age 19, she graduated from Stanford University with a BA in American Studies and from Georgetown University with a MALS in International Studies.

==Career==
Cafaro served on the Trumbull County Senior Services Advisory Council and was a State Policy Liaison for Ohio with the National Patient Advocate Foundation. She was also a State Advocate Representative for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and served as a councilor for the Medicare Rights Center. Cafaro has also acted as an Economic Policy Associate for Global Action on Aging, an NGO with consultative status at the United Nations.

As a political novice, Cafaro won a surprise victory in the 2004 Democratic primary for Ohio&#x27;s 14th congressional district, topping a five-candidate field, which included 2002 nominee Dale V. Blanchard, columnist Herb Hammer, U.S. Marine Charles L. Wolfe, and Ohio state Rep. Ed Jerse (who received the endorsement of the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; newspaper). Cafaro polled 54% of the vote, while Jerse, the second-place finisher, managed 19%. In the general election, however, she lost to Republican Steve LaTourette.

Cafaro again ran for the Democratic nomination in the open 13th Congressional District in 2006, placing second in a nine-candidate primary, behind future Congresswoman Betty Sutton. That seat was vacated by U.S. Representative Sherrod Brown, Democrat who replaced Republican Senator Mike DeWine in the U.S. Senate after defeating him on November 7, 2006.

As of 2017, Cafaro was the Executive in Residence at American University&#x27;s School of Public Affairs and gave commentary on political events as a contributor on Fox News.

==Ohio Senate==
In 2007, Cafaro was appointed to the 32nd District of the Ohio Senate to replace Marc Dann after Dann won the Ohio Attorney General&#x27;s race on November 7, 2006.

One year after becoming a member of the Ohio General Assembly, Cafaro secured a leadership position as the assistant minority whip for the Senate Democrats.

In 2008, Cafaro was elected to her first full term after running unopposed in the general election. Soon after, she was elected Minority Leader by her colleagues for the 128th General Assembly. Cafaro again served as Minority Leader in the 129th General Assembly. Cafaro would serve as Leader for three years until she stepped down and was replaced in 2012 as Ohio Senate Minority Leader by Senator Eric Kearney. She won a second full term to her Senate seat in the 2012 general election, defeating Republican Nancy McArthur 67% to 33%.

Cafaro played a prominent role in the Medicaid expansion efforts in Ohio, and has sought to codify the expansion permanently in Ohio law. She has offered legislation numerous times to do so.

Cafaro did not seek reelection to the Ohio state senate in 2016 due to term limits.

<doc id="1044716" wikidata="Q3614120" url="?curid=1044716" title="America³">
<text>America (pronounced &quot;America Cubed&quot;) is the name of both a syndicate that vied for the America&#x27;s Cup in 1992 and 1995 and its boats.

==1992 Cup victory==

The program was operated by Bill Koch and Harry &quot;Buddy&quot; Melges in the 1992 America&#x27;s Cup. After winning the Defender Series, &quot;America&quot; defeated the Italian challenger &quot;Il Moro di Venezia&quot; to successfully defend the Cup.

The yacht, named America³, was built by Goetz Custom Sailboats Inc. in Rhode Island and the carbon fiber mast package was built by the Offshore Spars Co. in Michigan.

==1995 Cup defense==
In 1995, Bill Koch revamped the program to begin the first nearly all-female, America&#x27;s Cup boat. &quot;America&#x27;s&quot; successor, &quot;Mighty Mary&quot;, was on her way to a race-off with &quot;Young America&quot;, the boat of the third syndicate that year, to determine who went through to the 1995 America&#x27;s Cup, in the lead of what ended up being the last race of the Defender Series over &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot;. But with a commanding lead of nearly 5 minutes, Dave Dellenbaugh (the only man on the otherwise all-female crew) committed a crucial tactical error and &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; skipper Dennis Conner made a series of moves to beat &quot;Mighty Mary&quot; to the finish line by scant seconds. After winning the Defender Series, Conner opted to use &quot;Young America&quot; to defend the cup, losing to Team New Zealand, 5–0.

There are a number of different methods that can be used to provide the service, these include checking different databases with negative or account history, checking that routing and account numbers are valid using algorithms, or contacting the bank that issued the check to get confirmation about the account status.

== Business ==

Check verification services have been most common in the United States, in Europe a cheque guarantee system operated for a number of years that could be used by merchants until the usage of cheques declined to the point where it was no longer necessary. Outside the United States the decline in check usage in favour of debit cards and credit cards has meant that cheques are rarely accepted by merchants thus rendering cheque verification services obsolete. In the United States, there are a number of third-party companies that provide check verification services.

Some banks bundle a level of this service with a business checking account or with a bank credit card acceptance program. Check verification companies will often offer one, two, or all of the different services in their own system. Some check verification services also offer collection agency service for the civil prosecution of check fraud.

==Verification methods==
Check verification services can use a number of different methods or may combine a number to verify the validity of a check.

===Negative check database===
A negative check database contains a comprehensive list of people who either wrote a bad check at a retail location, paid a bill with a check that was returned, also called &quot;bouncing a check&quot;.

Historical data check verification services that use a national network with a negative check database can be difficult for consumers and businesses to remove themselves from once they get on, even in the case of errors.

These databases are often bundled with &quot;check guarantee&quot; services like ChexSystems. This leaves companies that use historical data reliant systems in a position of sometimes denying customers that have a valid check, but managed to get on the negative check database.

This type of verification is usually linked to the person writing the check and runs the verification using their driver&#x27;s license number. This type of information is a valuable tool for loss prevention because it identifies historically or habitual check bouncers who are more likely to re-offend. Negative check database systems can cause customer service issues between retailers and their own customers, because there is no limit to the time period that is considered.

===Account history database===
The account history database offers a database with historical data on the account itself, and not just the person writing the check. This type of system keeps records of the account number for all checks that don&#x27;t clear and can tell if that particular checking account has had returns in the past.

Because this type of system is based on the history of all checks written against the account, it can provide valuable information, just like the negative check database except the information is not based on the identity of the person writing the check.

This is particularly valuable for taking business checks or company checks because often the identity of the person writing the check has little to do with the company check. In the account history database, a good account with no flags would receive full approval, regardless of the status of the employee who writes the check because identity is not verified.

===Account current status verification===
There is also a checking account validation network that can poll the results of the actual bank account to get the current status from the bank. Newer systems provide a result that is based on the bank account&#x27;s actual status provided by the bank as of that business banking day are increasing in popularity for companies that take checks by phone, manage monthly check payments, or automatic billing with bank drafts, or who process ACH transactions received by phone or for monthly billing.

Account status verification systems give you the status of the account as of the beginning of the business banking day. They tell you if there is an open active account at that bank and if the check is likely to clear. Status messages such as closed account, NSF, stop payment or invalid account can help determine if a check or ACH transaction will be good.

The results are based on account validity, so there is no way to know if the check will actually clear when it is presented, or if the exact dollar amount is going to be available.

This type of system is used less at retail establishments, and more for companies that do checks by phone sales, monthly check drafting, monthly billing via ACH and online sales. It reduces the number of bad payments that are deposited due to human error, fraud or account status.

===Merchant funds verification===
Often called &quot;verifying funds&quot; or &quot;merchant funds verification&quot;, it was common practice until the mid-2000s that any business or individual could call the bank where the check was drawn and ask for check verification. The bank would ask for the account number, the name on the check, the amount and the check number and just look up the account.

Due to banks issuing privacy policies designed to protect identity and fraud, telephone merchant funds verification by calling the bank directly is now rare for any bank or credit union to offer this service.

Some banks still offer merchant funds verification, while others are limiting the information they will provide to telling you if the account is open with a positive balance, only.

Other banks provide this service as a pay-per-call, or offer bank validation for a fee. The majority of banks do not provide any direct telephone account verification.

===Routing number verification===
Yet another form of check verification is to cross reference the ABA routing transit number, also called the Routing Number or ABA Number, with the bank to check against the actual item being presented. The routing number verification can provide the bank&#x27;s name, address for processing, and phone number.

Some routing number verification systems use an algorithm to validate the routing number, rather than cross reference the results in a database.

Routing number verification is limited to verifying the bank name, address and phone number and cannot determine if the checking account is valid of perform funds verification. It can be valuable in locating fraudulent checks or drafts, and in getting contact information for the bank for merchant funds verification or account validation. Using the bank phone number, a business can attempt merchant funds verification if the bank offers the service.

<doc id="1044721" wikidata="Q92879" url="?curid=1044721" title="Tony Fadell">
<text>Anthony Michael Fadell (born March 22, 1969) is an American engineer, designer, entrepreneur, and investor. He was senior vice president of the iPod division at Apple Inc. and founder and former CEO of Nest Labs.

Fadell joined Apple Inc. in 2001 and oversaw all iPod hardware, software, and accessories development. He is known as the &quot;father of the iPod&quot;. As the co-creator of the iPhone, he also worked on the first three generations of the iPhone and oversaw all iPhone hardware, firmware, and accessories development from March 2006 to November 2008.

In May 2010, he co-founded Nest Labs, which announced its first product, the Nest Learning Thermostat, in October 2011. Nest was acquired by Google in January 2014 for $3.2B.

Fadell has authored more than 300 patents and was named one of &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World&quot; in 2014. In 2016 &quot;Time&quot; named the Nest Learning Thermostat, the iPod and the iPhone as three of the “50 Most Influential Gadgets of All Time&quot;.

== Education and early life ==
Fadell was born on March 22, 1969, in Michigan, to a Lebanese father and Polish mother. Fadell is an alumnus of Grosse Pointe South High School in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. He graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Computer Engineering in 1991.

== Career ==
===General Magic===
After college, Fadell worked for Apple spinoff General Magic for three years, working with Sony, Philips, Matsushita, Toshiba and other consumer electronics firms in the &quot;General Magic Alliance&quot; to develop a line of personal handheld communicators. He started in 1992 as a diagnostics engineer and progressed to a systems architect.

===Philips Electronics===
In 1995, he was hired by Philips where he co-founded their Mobile Computing Group and served as the chief technology officer, and director of engineering. He developed a number of Windows CE-based hand-held devices, notably the Philips Velo and Nino PDA. Fadell went on to become a vice president of Philips Strategy and Ventures where he was in charge of developing Philips&#x27;s digital audio strategy consisting of technology direction for silicon and software, as well as its investment portfolio and potential business models.

===Fuse===
After Philips Fadell worked at RealNetworks for six weeks.

In July 1999, Fadell started his own company called Fuse to develop the &quot;Dell of the Consumer Electronics&quot;. One of the devices he had in mind was a small hard disk-based music player and an online-store-for-music. Fuse failed, however, to find a second round of funding, and Fadell started exploring developing the product at other companies.

===Apple Inc.===
Fadell is known as the &quot;father of the iPod&quot;. Fadell found support for his business idea of an MP3 player complemented by an online music store in Apple. In 2001 Fadell was hired by Apple as a contractor designing the iPod and planning Apple&#x27;s audio product strategy. His idea for a small hard disk-based music player and an online-store-for-music had caught Steve Jobs&#x27;s attention. During that time, he created the concept and initial design of the iPod. He was then hired by Apple to assemble and run its iPod &amp; Special Projects group in April 2001. He was tasked with overseeing the design and production of the iPod and iSight devices.

Due to the engineers and resources at Apple being constrained with the Mac line, Fadell hired engineers from his startup company, Fuse, and veteran engineers from General Magic and Philips to build the core iPod development team. He also hired an outside company to develop the software for the player.

He was promoted to vice president of iPod engineering in 2004 and on October 14, 2005, Apple announced that Fadell would replace the retiring Jon Rubinstein as Senior Vice President of the iPod Division on March 31, 2006.

On November 3, 2008, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; broke the story of Fadell&#x27;s departure from Apple.

=== Nest Labs, Inc. ===

While building his energy-efficient home near Lake Tahoe in California, Fadell searched for a thermostat and was frustrated by the limited features, high cost and lack of energy efficiency gains provided by available devices. After he left Apple, he spent time around the world and realized people everywhere were having similar energy saving dilemmas as he was in his Tahoe house. Fadell developed the business plan for Nest while living in Paris in 2009.

Together with Matt Rogers, a former Apple colleague, he set out to redesign the traditional thermostat. In May 2010 Fadell and Rogers co-founded Nest Labs in Palo Alto, CA. Nest announced its first product, the Nest Learning Thermostat, in October 2011. Nest was acquired by Google in January 2014 for $3.2B. Fadell announced his resignation from Nest on June 3, 2016.

===Build Collective===
As of 2017, Fadell has been running a venture fund originally called Future Shape, now called Build Collective.

===Author===
His book &quot;Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making&quot; was released May 3, 2022. &quot;Build&quot; has been named a &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot; best seller.

===Awards and honors===
In 2012, he was the recipient of the Alva Award, honoring him as &quot;the next great serial inventor&quot;. Vanity Fair also recognized him as a trailblazer on their 2012 Next Establishment list. In 2013, Fadell was acknowledged as one of Business Insider&#x27;s Top 75 Designers in Technology, Fast Company&#x27;s 100 Most Creative People, and CNBC&#x27;s Top 50 Disruptors.

<text>Chateau Musar is a Lebanese winery located in Ghazir, Lebanon, north of the capital Beirut. Musar grapes grow in the Beqaa Valley, a fertile sunny valley at an elevation of , situated east of Beirut. 
==History==
The winery was established by Gaston Hochar in 1930 after returning from Bordeaux. Gaston Hochar was succeeded by his sons, Ronald and Serge Hochar, with the latter managing the estate from 1959 until his death while swimming in Mexico in 2014, and Ronald Hochar assuming marketing and finance department responsibilities from 1962. Serge Hochar&#x27;s sons have succeeded him at the winery. Gaston Hochar is now in charge of the day-to-day running of the winery, and Marc Hochar is in charge of the winery&#x27;s commercial aspects. 

In the 1930s and 1940s when Lebanon was under French control, the winery was an important customer for local French Army troops stationed in Lebanon. A French officer named Ronald Barton (whom Gaston named his second son after), and was stationed in Lebanon, was highly influential to the early development of Chateau Musar&#x27;s wines, as Barton was affiliated with the Bordeaux wineries Château Langoa-Barton and Château Léoville Barton.

In 1959, Serge Hochar becomes Chateau Musar winemaker, while completing his winemaking studies at the University of Oenology in Bordeaux, under the tutorage of Jean Riberau and Emile Peynaud.

Before the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990), the Chateau Musar wines were mostly sold to domestic markets, however the war changed that. Gaston Hochar&#x27;s son Ronald Hochar helped market the wine abroad and from the late 1970s and early 1980s the wine became more popular abroad.

The international discovery of Musar took place at the Bristol Wine Fair of 1979 when auctioneer and taster Michael Broadbent and journalist Roger Voss selected Musar 1967 as the &quot;discovery of the Fair&quot;.

Despite war in Lebanon and frequent tension, with the exception of the 1976 vintage, wine has been produced at the Château every year, with employees sometimes working under high-risk conditions. (1984 was made, despite difficulties in transporting the grapes to the winery. It has not yet been released commercially.) The 1992 red Chateau Musar production was declassified due to a weak vintage.

Though comparisons are sometimes made with Bordeaux wine, Burgundy wine or Rhône wine, it is most frequently maintained that the wine of Musar is unique. Due to the winemaking philosophy of Serge Hochar, its vintages are notoriously inconsistent.

==Production==
The red wine, which is the best known is made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Cinsault, Carignan, Grenache, and Mourvèdre grapes in varying amounts each year. The whites are made from Obaideh (related to Chardonnay) and Merwah (related to Sémillon). Both wines contain classic Bordeaux grapes, however they are very different, as they are made in a natural wine style with significant bottle variation. The wines generally improve with age, both the red and whites. 

They also produce a single vineyard wine, Hochar, which is similar to the red Musar but is oak aged for only 9 months, and can be drunk younger, as well as the Cuvée Musar range, both produced as a red, white and a rosé.

<text>Erle Palmer Halliburton was an American businessman specializing in oil field services.

==Early life==
Halliburton was born on September 22, 1892, near Henning, Tennessee, the son of Lou Emma (Cothran) and Edwin Graves Halliburton. When Halliburton was 12 years old, his father died. At 14, Halliburton left home to support the family. As a youth, he learned how to operate heavy machinery such as a locomotive, a steam crane, and a steam shovel. Later, Halliburton was a salesman in New York.

==Business career==
Before the United States entered into World War I, Halliburton gained exposure to shipboard engineering as a member of the United States Navy. After his honorable discharge in 1915, he headed for the oilfields of California, where he was able to apply techniques analogous to the technology with which he had worked in the Navy. His drive and his sense of innovation soon brought him into conflict with his boss, Almond Perkins. Halliburton later quipped that getting hired and getting fired by the Perkins Oil Well Cementing Company were the two best opportunities he had ever received.

Halliburton then moved to Duncan, Oklahoma, where he invented, perfected, and patented a new method of oil well cementing. According to one of the inscriptions on the pictured monument, Halliburton&#x27;s method &quot;isolates the various downhole zones, guards against a collapse of the casing and permits control of the well during its producing life.&quot; In 1919, based on this new method, Halliburton started Duncan&#x27;s New Method Oil Well Cementing Company. By 1922, the company was operating as the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company. On July 5, 1961, it became known as the Halliburton Company.

Halliburton also founded Southwest Air Fast Express, which was later acquired by American Airlines.

Halliburton designed the aluminum suitcases which are now manufactured by Zero Halliburton.
Halliburton was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1957.

Halliburton died on October 13, 1957, in Los Angeles at the age of 65.

== Private life ==
Halliburton was married to Vida C. Taber Halliburton. They had 5 children: Erle P., Jr., David, Zola Catherine, Vida Jessie, and Ruth Lou.
Erle Halliburton was a cousin of the famed adventure writer Richard Halliburton.

<doc id="1044747" wikidata="Q2777431" url="?curid=1044747" title="Key money">
<text>Key money is one of several forms of payment made to a landlord. The term has various meanings in different parts of the world. It sometimes means money paid to an existing tenant who assigns a lease to a new tenant where the rent is below market. It sometimes means a bribe to a landlord. In other parts of the world, it is used synonymously with normal security deposits, which are used to cover nonpayment of rent and excessive damage to a rental unit.

== Oceania ==

===Australia===
In many states of Australia (New South Wales, Victoria, etc.), the Retail Leases Act calls key-money a payment or benefit without true consideration, expected from a tenant in order for a lease being granted, renewed or modified, and makes such payment illegal.

==Asia==

===Japan===
In Japan, is a mandatory payment to the landlord that is often the same amount as the original deposit (). However, &quot;&quot; can be the equivalent of six months (or more) of rent, but is typically the same as one to three months of rent. This money is considered a gift to the landlord and is not returned after the lease is canceled.

There are regional variations – in Kantō (Eastern Japan, including Tōkyō), a is typically charged at contract renewal, similar to repetition of key money, while in Ōsaka key money is instead deducted from a large security deposit, which is known as , from .

In recent years, an increasing number of landlords and real estate agencies have begun to offer &quot;reikin&quot;-free rental housing, and the semipublic Urban Renaissance Agency does not charge key money or renewal fees.

===South Korea===

In South Korea, the key money system (as opposed to monthly rent or ) requires the lessee to make a deposit of about one-third to two-thirds the total cost of the leased property in lieu of monthly payment. The key money is returned when the lease expires. The key money deposit will not be returned before termination of the lease unless another lessee replaces the outgoing lessee.

===Pakistan===
It is goodwill and non-refundable. It is known as PAGHRI.

==Europe==

===France===
In France, a tenant who has a lease that is below market can assign that lease to a new tenant. The new landlord is required to accept the original rent from the new tenant. The new tenant essentially buys the lease from the original tenant. The capitalization factor is financial and strategic, depending on cost of money, importance of the site to the taker and the location of the site. The ratio used goes from 0 (poor locations) to 12 (top locations). The remaining number of years of the contract has little or no impact unless it falls under the legal provision of , in which the landlord is automatically allowed to ask for a new, market-rate rent regardless of the rent paid so far.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, it is illegal for the landlord or an existing tenant to ask for compensation for an apartment lease, but a significant black market for rental contracts is believed to exist in some cities such as Stockholm. The Swedish Union of Tenants believes that the illegal practice of demanding key money or other compensation happens at most private landlord companies, while the landlords&#x27; advocacy group Fastighetsägarna believes that as much as half of the rental contracts are wrongly obtained at any time, and proposes a reduction of rent control as a solution. Merely paying key money is not a crime, but is considered by many to be a way of cheating (since you sidestep the queue system). It typically results in immediate termination of your lease if discovered.

However, it is legal to require a security deposit when renting out an apartment or house. It is rarely done when a commercial or public landlord is renting out an apartment to an individual, since it is easy for the landlord to get any debts collected. When individuals rent out to other individuals, or when businesses rent commercial premises, a security deposit of 1–6 months is usually requested.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, key money () is a payment without consideration, often required by either the landlord or by the vacating tenant. The amount can vary from a symbolical amount up to one or more monthly lease terms. However, key money is deemed illegal and repayment can be enforced by legal means. As the Netherlands experience a shortage in living space (especially in Amsterdam and other large cities in the west), landlords and tenants nevertheless often ask for key money despite it being illegal.

== North America ==

===United States===

In the United States, it is common to require key money in the form of a security deposit. The tenant pays one or two months&#x27; rent up-front. These funds are then held in escrow and are used to offset delinquent payments or damage to the property. If neither happens, the money is refunded (typically with statutory interest) when the tenant vacates. It is illegal but common for unscrupulous landlords to refuse to refund some or all of this deposit, instead keeping it for unneeded &quot;cleaning&quot; or &quot;repairs&quot;. Landlord-tenant laws in the United States typically specify that a landlord must provide a detailed accounting of all deductions from a security deposit on request and normally cannot charge for &quot;normal wear and tear&quot;, such as replacing old carpets or painting walls that have not been painted for many years.

Generally in the United States, apartment leases are not transferable without the consent of the landlord. The primary exception is the right to rent a space in a mobile home park, which is frequently transferable, frequently rent-controlled, and frequently subject to French-style &quot;key money&quot; payments to the original tenant in the form of buying the current mobile home at an inflated price. The new tenant can then junk the existing, outdated trailer and replace it with a modern one while keeping the terms of the original lease for the land under it.

When renting commercial properties in which the premises already contains various trade-fixtures, equipment, electric, and plumbing (items typically left when a former tenant vacates), such items have a value above the typical rent for an empty &quot;vanilla shell&quot; premises. The landlord would charge the tenant key money in order for the tenant to have the right to use and take over all of the existing equipment.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico, key money is referred to as &quot;guante&quot; (translating to &quot;glove&quot; in English).

==Covert key money==
Since key money is in many cases illegal for the reason that it is a payment without consideration or even a bribe, it is often disguised as other costs:
* Made-up additional charges for &#x27;cleaning&#x27;, &#x27;contract drafting&#x27;, &#x27;administration&#x27;, &#x27;registration&#x27;, etc.
* An obligation for the tenant to take over furniture or other items from the landlord or vacating tenant, for an amount which does not reflect the true economic value of these items.
* Demanding large security deposits which are only repayable at face value (thus without interest). Unscrupulous landlords could even as a matter of principle not return any security deposits at all.

<doc id="1044750" wikidata="Q2411973" url="?curid=1044750" title="Brettanomyces">
<text>Brettanomyces is a non-spore forming genus of yeast in the family Saccharomycetaceae, and is often colloquially referred to as &quot;Brett&quot;. The genus name Dekkera is used interchangeably with &quot;Brettanomyces&quot;, as it describes the teleomorph or spore forming form of the yeast, but is considered deprecated under the one fungus, one name change. The cellular morphology of the yeast can vary from ovoid to long &quot;sausage&quot; shaped cells. The yeast is acidogenic, and when grown on glucose rich media under aerobic conditions, produces large amounts of acetic acid. &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; is important to both the brewing and wine industries due to the sensory compounds it produces.

In the wild, &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; lives on the skins of fruit.

==History==
In 1889, Seyffert of the Kalinkin Brewery in St. Petersburg, Russia was the first to isolate a &quot;Torula&quot; from English beer which produced the typical &quot;English&quot; taste in lager beer, and in 1899 JW Tullo at Guinness described two types of &quot;secondary yeast&quot; in Irish stout. However N. Hjelte Claussen at the Carlsberg brewery was the first to publish a description in 1904, following a 1903 patent (UK patent GB190328184) that was the first patented microorganism in history.

===Etymology===
The term &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; comes from the Greek for &quot;British fungus&quot;. İt is a compound of Ancient Greek Βρεττανός (Brettanós) : &quot;British&quot; and μύκης (múkēs) : &quot;fungus&quot;.

==Wine==

When &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; grows in wine it produces several compounds that can alter the palate and bouquet. At low levels some winemakers agree that the presence of these compounds has a positive effect on wine, contributing to complexity, and giving an aged character to some young red wines. Many wines even rely on &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; to give their distinctive character, such as Château Musar. However, when the levels of the sensory compounds greatly exceed the sensory threshold, their perception is almost always negative. The sensory threshold can differ between individuals, and some find the compounds more unattractive than others. While it can be desirable at lower levels, there is no guarantee that high levels will not be produced. As &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; can potentially spoil a wine it is generally seen as a wine spoilage yeast, and its presence in wine as a wine fault.

Wines that have been contaminated with &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; taints are often referred to as &quot;&quot;Bretty&quot;, &quot;metallic&quot;, or as having &quot;Brett character&quot;&quot;. &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; taint in wine is also sometimes incorrectly identified as cork taint.

===Sensory compounds===
The compounds responsible contributing certain sensory characters to wine are;
*4-ethylphenol: Band-aids, barnyard, horse stable, antiseptic
*4-ethylguaiacol: Bacon, spice, cloves, smoky
*isovaleric acid: Sweaty saddle, cheese, rancidity
These compounds can impart completely different sensory properties to a wine when they are present in different ratios.

===Origins in the winery===
&quot;Brettanomyces&quot; is most associated with barrel aged red wines, but has also been found in Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. In some cases the yeast has caused contamination in sparkling wines produced by the méthode champenoise when &quot;en tirage&quot;. It is thought &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; can be introduced to a winery by insect vectors such as fruit flies, or by purchasing &quot;Brett&quot;-contaminated wine barrels. The ability to metabolise the disaccharide cellobiose, along with the irregular surface of a barrel interior, provide ideal conditions for &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; growth. Once the yeast is in a winery it is hard to eradicate and is spread readily by unsanitised equipment.

===Control measures===
The growth of &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; is best controlled by the addition of sulfur dioxide, to which the yeast is particularly sensitive. The addition of other sterilising compounds such as dimethyl dicarbonate often has a similar effect. Alternatively the wine can be bottled after sterile filtration, which physically removes the yeast. Wines that are vinified to low residual sugar levels, such as &lt;1.0g/L, are also less likely to be spoiled as the main growth substrate has been limited. However growth has been reported at levels below this and it is assumed that the yeast can use other substrates.

== Beer ==
In most beer styles &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; is typically viewed as a contaminant and the characteristics it imparts are considered unwelcome &quot;off-flavours&quot;. However, in certain styles, particularly certain traditional Belgian ales, it is appreciated and encouraged. Gueuze and other lambic beers owe their unique flavour profiles to &quot;Brettanomyces&quot;, as do wild yeast &quot;saison&quot; or farmhouse styles; and it is also found in Oud Bruin and Flanders red ale.

In Orval &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; is added before the final bottle fermentation.

Several American craft breweries intentionally use &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; in their beers. This use began with a renewed interest in Belgian style ales and later formed new styles altogether (Brewers Association, 2007 Great American Beer Festival Style Guidelines, section 13a, 16). Some breweries use 100% &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; for the fermentation of some of their beers, and omit &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; from the recipe. Some American brewers that use &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; may also include lactic acid producing bacteria such as &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Pediococcus&quot; in order to provide sourness to the beer.

While &quot;Brett&quot; is sometimes pitched into the fermenter, aging in wood barrels previously inoculated with &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; is another method used to impart the complexity contributed by these strains of yeast.

<text>De Phenomenis in Orbe Lunae is a 1612 book by Collegio Romano philosophy professor Giulio Cesare la Galla that describes emission of light by a stone. La Galla&#x27;s inspiration came from Galileo&#x27;s debate with Vincenzo Casciarolo regarding a &quot;lapis solaris,&quot; a stone that emitted light seemingly on its own. In &quot;De Phenomenis&quot;, de Galla asserts that the stone was only able to emit light after the stone itself had calcified. It released &quot;a certain quantity of fire and light&quot; that it had absorbed, just as water would be absorbed by a sponge.

Robert Burton discusses &quot;De Phenomenis&quot; in &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy.&quot;

<doc id="1044754" wikidata="Q5288261" url="?curid=1044754" title="Dog communication">
<text>Dog communication refers to the methods dogs use to transfer information to other dogs, animals, and humans. Dogs may exchange information vocally, visually, or through smell. Visual communication includes mouth shape and head position, licking and sniffing, ear and tail positioning, eye contact, facial expression, and body posture. Auditory communication can include barks, growls, howls, whines and whimpers, screams, pants and sighs. Dogs also communicate via gustatory communication, utilizing scent and pheromones.

Humans can communicate with dogs through a wide variety of methods. Broadly, this includes vocalization, hand signals, body posture and touch. The two species also communicate visually. Through domestication, dogs have become particularly adept at &quot;reading&quot; human facial expressions. Dogs recognise and infer emotional information from humans. When communicating with a human, their level of comprehension is generally comparable to a toddler.

== Dog–human communication ==
Dogs tend to be highly responsive to human cues, especially the direction of a gaze and the direction in which a human points. Dogs rely on the gestures of humans more than verbal cues, most importantly eye contact. Eye contact is considered an ostensive cue. A human-dog gaze helps dogs establish stronger relationships by being able to communicate better with humans, as well as other dogs. Dogs will start to act and react much like their owners do. Dogs will pick up on how their owners respond to strangers and non-friendly dogs.

Both humans and dogs are characterized by complex social lives with complex communication systems, but it is also possible that dogs, perhaps because of their reliance on humans for food, have evolved specialized skills for recognizing and interpreting human social-communicative signals. Four basic hypotheses have been put forward to account for the findings.
# Dogs, by way of their interactions with humans, learn to be responsive to human social cues through basic conditioning processes.
# By undergoing domestication, dogs not only reduced their fear of humans but also applied all-purpose problem-solving skills to their interactions with people. This largely innate gift for reading human social gestures was inadvertently selected via domestication.
# Dogs&#x27; co-evolution with humans equipped them with the cognitive machinery to not only respond to human social cues but to understand human mental states; a so-called theory of mind.
# Dogs are adaptively predisposed to learn about human communicative gestures. They come with a built-in &quot;head start&quot; to learn the significance of people&#x27;s gestures, in much the same way that white-crowned sparrows acquire their species-typical song and ducklings imprint on their own kind.
The pointing gesture is a human-specific signal and is referential. Human infants acquire it weeks before the first spoken word. In 2009, a study compared the responses to a range of pointing gestures by dogs and human infants. The study showed little difference in the performance of 2-year-old children and dogs, while 3-year-old children&#x27;s performances were higher. The results also showed that all subjects were able to generalize from their previous experience to respond to relatively novel pointing gestures. This can be explained as a joint outcome of their evolutionary history as well as their socialization in a human environment.
Most people can tell from a bark whether a dog/canine was alone or being approached by a stranger, playing or being aggressive, and able to tell from a growl how big the dog is. This is thought to be evidence of human-dog coevolution.

==Visual==

Dogs communicating emotions through body positioning were illustrated in Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; published in 1872.
In her book &quot;On Talking Terms with Dogs&quot;, Turid Rugaas identifies around 30 signals that she calls calming signals. The notion of dominance and submission is much debated. In her book, she does not use these terms to differentiate behaviour. She describes calming signals as a way for dogs to calm themselves or other humans/dogs around them. These are some of the signals she identifies:
By moving different parts of their bodies, whether facial expressions or postures, dogs can express a wide range of emotions and signals.
===Mouth shape===
* Mouth relaxed and slightly open; tongue perhaps slightly visible or draped over the lower teeth – this is the sign of a content and relaxed dog.
* Mouth closed, no teeth or tongue visible. Usually associated with the dog looking in one direction, and the ears and head may lean slightly forward – shows attention, interest, or appraisal of a situation.
* Curling or pulling the lips to expose the teeth and perhaps the gums – a warning signal. The other party has time to back down, leave, or show a pacifying gesture.
* Mouth elongated as if pulled back, stretching out the mouth opening and showing the rear teeth – a submissive dog yielding to the dominant dog&#x27;s threat.
* &quot;Smiling:&quot; a calming signal.

===Head position===
* A dominant or threatening dog that looks directly at another individual – a threat. It is pointing its weapons (muzzle/teeth).
* A dominant dog turning its head away from a submissive dog – a calming action, indicating that it is not going to attack.
* A less dominant dog approaching a dominant dog with its head down, and only on occasion quickly pointing its muzzle towards the higher-status dog – shows no fight is intended.
* In an alternative interpretation that does not involve dominance and submission, turning the head away is recognized as a calming signal.

===Yawn===
Similarly to humans, dogs yawn in an attempt to awaken. Dogs will also yawn when under stress, or as a pacifying signal when being menaced by aggression signals from another dog. Yawning, accompanied by a head turned away from the aggressor, can defuse a potentially threatening situation. It is also recognized as a calming signal.

===Licking and sniffing=== 
Licking behavior has multiple causes and meanings and should not be simply interpreted as affection. Dogs that are familiar with each other may lick each other&#x27;s faces in greeting, then sniff any moist membranes where odors are strongest (i.e. mouth, nose, anal region, or urogenital region.) Mating behaviors are characterized by licking in a more vigorous manner than used during greetings. Licking can communicate information about dominance, intentions, and state of mind, and, like the yawn, is mainly a pacifying behavior. All pacifying behaviors contain elements of puppy behavior, including licking. Puppies lick themselves and their littermates as part of the cleaning process, and it appears to build bonds. Later in life, licking ceases to be a cleaning function and forms a ritualized gesture indicating friendliness. When stressed, a dog might lick the air, its own lips, or drop down and lick its paws or body. Lip-licking and sniffing are also recognized as calming signals.

===Ears===
Dogs&#x27; ability to move their ears is different among each breed. In addition, some ears move very little if they are artificially altered or cropped by humans.

* Ears erect or slightly forward – signals attention or alertness.
* Ears pulled back flat against the head, teeth bared – signals an anxious dog that will defend itself.
* Ears pulled back flat against the head, teeth not bared – signals submission.
* Ears pulled slightly back and slightly splayed – signals indecision, or uneasy suspicion that may become aggression.
* Ears flickering, slightly forward, then slightly back or downward – signals indecision with a submissive or fearful component.
* Ears pulled close to the head to give a &quot;round face&quot; – a calming signal.
*Ears pulled back in varying angles – expresses arousal.
*Ears flattened or pressed down – indicates fear, anger, or frustration.
*Ears pressed tightly to the head – expresses extreme fear.
*Ears held sideways – indicates conflicting emotions due to an unsettling situation.

===Eyes===
When dogs want to threaten a perceived adversary, they will stare. In contrast, dogs will avoid eye contact if trying to decrease tension. They can communicate emotional states by having &quot;soft&quot; eyes or &quot;hard&quot; eyes. Soft eyes are used when a dog feels relaxed and not threatened. Hard eyes are used when feeling tension and unease about a potentially threatening situation. The eyes are slightly closed, the brow area is wrinkled, and their teeth may be showing. A dog should not be approached when they are communicating this way and should be removed from the high tension situation, if possible.

* Direct eye-to-eye stare – a threat, expression of dominance, or warning that an attack is about to begin.
* Eyes turned away to avoid direct eye contact – breaking off eye contact signals submission; it is also recognized as a calming signal.
* Blinking – a calming signal.

===Tail===

* Tail held high – communicates confidence, arousal, and willingness to be approached by other dogs or humans
*Tail horizontal, pointing away from the dog but not stiff – signals attentiveness.
* Tail horizontally straight out, stiff, and pointing away from the dog – displays an initial challenge that could lead to aggression if feeling threatened or anxious.
* Tail up, between the horizontal and vertical position – conveys dominance .
* Tail up and slightly curved over back – signals confidence; seen in a dominant dog that feels in control.
* Tail held lower than horizontally but still some distance off from the legs, perhaps with an occasional swishing back and forth – an unconcerned, relaxed dog.
* Tail down, near hind legs, legs straight, tail swings back and forth slowly – dog feeling unwell, slightly depressed or in moderate pain.
* Tail down, near hind legs, hind legs bent inwards to lower the body – expresses timidity, apprehension, or insecurity.
* Tail tucked between legs – expresses fear, anxiety, or nervousness; can also be a ritualized pacifying signal to fend off aggression from another dog. The expression &quot;tail between one&#x27;s legs&quot; is used in English about people too.
* Tail fast wagging – excitement.
* Slight tail wag, each swing of only a small size – greeting.
* Broad tail wag – friendly.
* Broad tail wag, with wide swings that pull the hips from side to side – happy greeting.
* Slow tail wag with tail at half-mast – unsure of what to do next, insecure.
* Tail wagging is also recognized as a calming signal.
* Tail wagging to the left side of the body – the dog senses a negative situation, such as unfamiliar dogs or people.
* Tail wagging to the right side of the body – the dog feels comfortable and safe.
Dogs are said to exhibit a left-right asymmetry of the tail when interacting with strangers, and will show the opposite right-left motion with people and dogs they know.

Dogs&#x27; ability to move their tails can be different among different breeds due to the fact that humans can dock their tails or remove them completely. In addition, some breeds, such as the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog, are born with extremely short tails, or other breeds, such as the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, may be born without a tail altogether.

===Body===

Dogs&#x27; bodies alone can communicate a lot. By increasing the size and tension of their bodies and making themselves look larger, they can communicate confidence, alertness, or even threat. Actions meant to reduce the size of the body, such as lowering to the floor with tail tucked and lowered ears, can communicate stress, fear, nerves, or a desire to avoid conflicts.

* Stiff-legged, upright posture or slow, stiff-legged movement forward – dominant dog.
* Body slightly sloped forward, feet braced – challenge to a dominant dog, conflict may follow.
* Hair bristles on back of shoulders – possible aggression, may also indicate fear and uncertainty.
* Lowering the body or cringing while looking up – submission.
* Muzzle nudge – occurs when a submissive dog gently pushes the muzzle of the dominant dog, showing acceptance.
* Dog sits when approached by another, allowing itself to be sniffed – signals acceptance of dominance but does not signal weakness.
* Dog rolls on side or exposes underbelly and completely breaks off eye contact – extreme pacifying or submission signal.
* Dog sits with one front paw slightly raised – stress, social fear and insecurity. It is also recognized as a calming signal.
* Dog rolls on its back and rubs its shoulders on the ground – contentment.
* Dog crouches with front legs extended, rear body and tail up, facing its playmate directly – classic &quot;play-bow&quot; to commence play. It is also recognized as a calming signal.

==Auditory==

Long-distance contact calls are common in Canidae, typically in the form of either barks (termed &quot;pulse trains&quot;) or howls (termed &quot;long acoustic streams&quot;). The long-distance howling of wolves and coyotes is one way in which dogs communicate.

By the age of four weeks, the dog has developed the majority of its vocalizations. The dog is the most vocal canid and is unique in its tendency to bark in myriad situations. Barking appears to have little more communication functions than excitement, fighting, the presence of a human, or simply because other dogs are barking. Subtler signs such as discreet bodily and facial movements, body odors, whines, yelps, and growls are the main sources of actual communication. The majority of these subtle communication techniques are employed at a close proximity to another, but for long-range communication, only barking and howling are employed.

One study has indicated that dogs are able to tell how big another dog is just by listening to its growl. The research also shows that dogs do not, or cannot, misrepresent their size, and this is the first time research has shown animals can determine another&#x27;s size by the sound they make. The test, using images of many kinds of dogs, showed a small and big dog and played a growl. Twenty of the 24 test dogs looked at the image of the appropriately sized dog first and looked at it longest.

Depending on the context, a dog&#x27;s bark can vary in timing, pitch, and amplitude. It is possible that these have different meanings.

===Barks===
* Barking in rapid strings of 3 or 4 with pauses in between, midrange pitch – alerting call, the dog senses something but not yet defined as a threat.
* Rapid barking, midrange pitch – basic alarm bark.
* Barking still continuously but a bit slower and lower pitch – imminent threat, prepare to defend.
* A prolonged string of barks, with moderate to long intervals between each one – lonely, in need of companionship, often exhibited when confined.
* One or two sharp, short barks of high or midrange pitch – typical greeting sound, usually replaces the alarm bark when visitor is identified as friendly or the dog feels insecure.
* Single sharp short bark, lower midrange pitch – annoyance, used by a mother dog disciplining her puppies or by a dog disturbed from its sleep.
* Single short bark, higher midrange pitch – surprised or startled.
* Stutter bark, midrange pitch – used to initiate play.
* Rising bark – indicates having fun, used during play-fighting or when the owner is about to throw an object.

===Growls===
* Soft, low-pitched growling that seems to come from the chest – used as a threat by a dominant dog.
* Soft growling that is not so low-pitched and seems more obviously to come from the mouth – stay away.
* Low-pitched growl-bark – growl leading to a bark is both a threat and a call for assistance.
* Higher midrange-pitched growl-bark – higher pitch means less confident, frightened but will defend itself.
* Undulating growl, going from midrange to high midrange – dog is terrified, it will either defend itself or run away.
* Noisy growl, medium and higher pitch, with teeth hidden from view – can signal intense concentration, may be found during play-aggression, however knowledge of the whole body language is required for a definitive answer.

===Howls===
* Yip-howl – lonely, in need of companionship.
* Howling – indicates the dog is present, or indicating that this is its territory.
* Bark-howl, 2–3 barks followed by a mournful howl – dog is relatively isolated, locked away with no companionship, calling for company or a response from another dog.
* Baying – can be heard during tracking to call pack-mates to the quarry.
===Whines and whimpers===
Whining and whimpers are short, high pitched sounds designed to bring the listener closer to show either fear or submission on the behalf of the whiner or whimperer. These are also the sounds that puppies make as pacifying and soliciting sounds.
* Soft whining and whimpering – hurting or scared.
* Moan or moan-yodel, lower pitched than whines or whimpers – spontaneous pleasure or excitement.
* Single yelp or high-pitched bark – response to sudden, unexpected pain such as a too-hard play bite.
* Series of yelps – severe fear or pain.

===Screaming===
A yelp for several seconds in length much like a human child, then repeated – anguish or agony, a call to the pack-mates for help, is rarely heard. It could be an indication of severe injury. It is recommended to take a dog to a veterinarian immediately if they scream.

===Panting===

Panting is an attempt to regulate body temperature. Excitement can raise the body temperature in both humans and dogs. Although not an intentional communication, if the dog pants rapidly even though it is not exposed to warm conditions or intense physical activity, then this signals excitement due to stress.

===Sighs===
Sighs are an expression of emotion, usually when the dog is lying down with its head on its paws. When the eyes are half-closed, it signals pleasure and contentment. When the eyes are fully open, it signals displeasure or disappointment.

=== Play Sneezing ===
Play sneezing is another calming signal that dogs use to indicate that they are not being aggressive, or that they are just playing. Play sneezes are not actual sneezes, but more of an expulsion of air that resembles a sneeze, and occur frequently during play.

==Olfactory==

Dogs have an olfactory sense 40 times more sensitive than a human&#x27;s and they commence their lives operating almost exclusively on smell and touch. Pheromones are the special scents that dogs use for communication. Pheromones are composed of natural chemicals that mediate olfactory communication with conspecifics. These pheromones that contain chemical signals serve to send information to other dogs about social status, age, sexual or reproductive status, aggressive behavior, and territorial marking. They can serve to either attract or repel other dogs. 

Pheromone signals are received in the vomeronasal organ (VNO) that is included in the olfactory tract. In order for a dog to detect a stimulus, or odor, the VNO has to be opened. It is opened when a pheromone attaches to the membrane of the nervous cells in the vomeronasal organ. From the VNO, the pheromone signals are sent to the accessory olfactory bulb and transferred to the amygdala. The pheromone will finally be sent to the ventromedial hypothalamus, where the signal is perceived. The Flehmen Response is a behavior in dogs in which the upper lip curves up to reveal to their teeth; this behavior strengthens the intake of pheromones.

Chemical signals are diffused into the environment by anal secretions, pedal glands, urine and fecal deposits, body odor, and rubbing their body on certain items. This is called scent marking, when individuals leave strong smelling scents on specific areas in the environment in order to mark their territory. The scent mark contains chemical messages about the sender. For example, when a female is in estrus, she will urinate more frequently to attract a potential mate. The urine contains information about a female&#x27;s reproductive status and it also conveys messages to the receiver about the female&#x27;s location. The compound p-hydroxybenzoate is found in the pheromones that attract a male to a female in estrus.

The most common type of scent marking is urine-marking to identify their territory. Adult males prefer to mark vertical surfaces with urine, using the raised-leg posture. The raised-leg posture provides increased dispersal of the elevated mark, allowing the wind to carry it further. Females; however, tend to utilize a squatting posture and urinate less frequently than males. Additionally, smaller dogs can use a higher leg raise when urinating to embellish their competitive ability.

Overmarking is when an individual covers another&#x27;s scent mark with its own. Both males and females practice overmarking, although it is more common in males. Overmarking is used to send information about social status and dominance. It enables dogs to find potential mates or acknowledge potential competitors. Such as males may overmark a female&#x27;s urine to guard a potential mate.

Scratching the ground is a common behavior seen after urination or defecation and is another way in which chemical signals are secreted. Pheromones are excreted from the pedal glands, aiding in territorial marking or adding additional odor to the scent mark. The chances of a dog scratching the ground increases when the individual is aggressively aroused. It is also usually followed by another male counter marking with urine in order to cover the area with their own scent and more prevalent when there is a female in estrus around.

Dogs also receive information about a conspecific by sniffing particular glands. When greeting, dogs tend to be more attentive to the neck, face, inguinal, and peripheral areas. There are specific glands in these areas that produce different odors, such as glands at the corner of the mouth, in the ear pinnae, the preputial and vaginal glands, and anal glands. Dogs gain social information by sniffing particular odors secreted from these areas. Dogs can also gain information from anal secretions. All canines have two symmetric sacs on either side of the anal sphincter that produce anal secretions during defecation. These are important in marking territory and sending information about social status.

<doc id="1044766" wikidata="Q1977685" url="?curid=1044766" title="Neo-Freudianism">
<text>Neo-Freudianism is a psychoanalytic approach derived from the influence of Sigmund Freud but extending his theories towards typically social or cultural aspects of psychoanalysis over the biological.

The neo-Freudian school of psychiatrists and psychologists were a group of loosely linked American theorists/writers of the mid-20th century &quot;who attempted to restate Freudian theory in sociological terms and to eliminate its connections with biology.&quot;

==Dissidents and post-Freudians==

=== Dissidents ===
The term &quot;neo-Freudian&quot; is sometimes loosely (but inaccurately) used to refer to those early followers of Freud who at some point accepted the basic tenets of Freud&#x27;s theory of psychoanalysis but later dissented from it. &quot;The best-known of these dissenters are Alfred Adler and Carl Jung.… The Dissidents.&quot;

An interest in the social approach to psychodynamics was the major theme linking the so-called neo-Freudians: Alfred Adler had perhaps been &quot;the first to explore and develop a comprehensive social theory of the psychodynamic self.&quot; Following &quot;Adler&#x27;s death, some of his views…came to exert considerable influence on the neo-Freudian theory.&quot; Indeed, it has been suggested of &quot;Horney and Sullivan ... that these theorists could be more accurately described as &#x27;neo-Adlerians&#x27; than &#x27;neo-Freudians&#x27;.&quot;

=== Post-Freudians ===
The Independent Analysts Group of the British Psycho-Analytical Society (&quot;Contemporary Freudians&quot;) are—like the ego-psychologists (e.g. Heinz Hartmann) or the intersubjective analysts in the States—perhaps best thought of as &quot;different schools of psychoanalytic thought,&quot; or as &quot;Post-Freudians…post-Freudian developments.&quot; They are distinct from the Kleinian schools of thought and include figures such as Christopher Bollas, D. W. Winnicott, and Adam Phillips.

==Neo-Freudian ideas==

=== History ===
As early as 1936, Erich Fromm had been independently regretting that psychoanalysts &quot;did not concern themselves with the variety of life experience…and therefore did not try to explain psychic structure as determined by social structure.&quot; Karen Horney, too, &quot;emphasised the role culture exerts in the development of personality and downplayed the classical driven features outlined by Freud.&quot;

Erik H. Erikson, for his part, stressed that &quot;psychoanalysis today is…shifting its emphasis…to the study of the ego&#x27;s roots in the social organisation,&quot; and that its method should be &quot;what H. S. Sullivan called &#x27;participant&#x27;, and systematically so.&quot;

Doctor and psychotherapist Harald Schultz-Hencke (1892–1953) was thoroughly busy with questions like impulse and inhibition and with the therapy of psychoses as well as the interpretation of dreams. He worked with Matthias Göring in his institute (&quot;Deutsches Institut für psychologische Forschung und Psychotherapie&quot;), and created the name &quot;Neopsychoanalyse&quot; in 1945. The &quot;Neo-Freudian revolt against the orthodox theory of instincts&quot; was thus anchored in a sense of what Harry Stack Sullivan termed &quot;our incredibly culture-ridden life.&quot; By their writings, and &quot;in accessible prose, Fromm, Horney, and others mounted a cultural and social critique which became almost conventional wisdom.&quot;

Through informal and more formal institutional links, such as the William Alanson White Institute, as well as through likeness of ideas, the neo-Freudians made up a cohesively distinctive and influential psychodynamic movement.

=== Basic anxiety ===
Karen Horney theorized that to deal with basic anxiety, the individual has three options:
# Moving toward others&quot;:&quot; Accept the situation and become dependent on others. This strategy may entail an exaggerated desire for approval or affection.
# Moving against others: Resist the situation and become aggressive. This strategy may involve an exaggerated need for power, exploitation of others, recognition, or achievement.
# Moving away from others: Withdraw from others and become isolated. This strategy may involve an exaggerated need for self-sufficiency, privacy, or independence.

=== Basic personality ===
The neo-Freudian Abram Kardiner was primarily interested in learning how a specific society acquires adaptation concerning its environment. He does this by forming within its members what he names a &quot;basic personality.&quot; The &quot;basic personality&quot; can initially be traced to the operation of primary institutions. It ultimately creates clusters of unconscious motivations in the specific individual &quot;which in turn are projected in the form of secondary institutions,&quot; such as reality systems. The basic personality finds expression in the secondary institutions.

==Criticism==
&quot;Fenichel developed a stringent theoretical critique of the neo-Freudians&quot;, which informed and fed into the way &quot;Herbert Marcuse, in his &#x27;Critique of Neo-Freudian Revisionism&#x27;...icily examines the tone of uplift and the Power of Positive Thinking that pervades the revisionists&#x27; writings, and mocks their claims to scientific seriousness.&quot;

In comparable fashion, &quot;an article…by Mr Edward Glover, entitled &quot;Freudian or Neo-Freudian&quot;, directed entirely against the constructions of Mr Alexander&quot; equally used the term as a form of orthodox reproach.

In the wake of such contemporary criticism, a &quot;consistent critique levelled at most theorists cited above is that they compromise the intrapersonal interiority of the psyche;&quot; but one may accept nonetheless that &quot;they have contributed an enduring and vital collection of standpoints relating to the human subject.&quot;

==Influence, successors, and offshoots==
In 1940, Carl Rogers had launched what would become person-centred psychotherapy, &quot;crediting its roots in the therapy of Rank...&amp; in the neo-Freudian analysts—especially Karen Horney.&quot; A decade later, he would report that it had &quot;developed along somewhat different paths than the psychotherapeutic views of Horney or Sullivan, or Alexander and French, yet there are many threads of interconnection with these modern formulations of psychoanalytic thinking.&quot;

A half-century further on, whether by direct or by indirect influence, &quot;consistent with the traditions of these schools, current theorists of the social and psychodynamic self are working in the spaces between social and political theory and psychoanalysis&quot; once again.

===Cultural offshoots===
In his skit on Freud&#x27;s remark that &quot;if my name were Oberhuber, my innovations would have found far less resistance,&quot; Peter Gay, considering the notional eclipse of &quot;Oberhuber&quot; by his replacement Freud, adjudged that &quot;the prospect that deviants would have to be called neo-Oberhuberians, or Oberhuberian revisionists, contributed to the master&#x27;s decline.&quot;

<text>Sanak Island () is an island in the Fox Islands group of the Aleutian Islands in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is located at .

Sanak Island and Caton Island are the largest islands in the Sanak Islands subgroup of the Fox Islands.

Travel to the island is currently done by fishing vessel. The trip takes about five hours to cross the roughly 40 mile distance from King Cove to Sanak.

==History==
Like many of the other Aleutian Islands, Sanak was inhabited by the Aleut people for thousands of years. In 1828, the administrators of Russian America removed the island&#x27;s population to the Alaska Peninsula in order to maintain access to the sea otter hunting grounds in surrounding waters.
Two famous shipwrecks, one in 1906 and another in 1943, occurred near Sanak. The U.S. Navy operated a small naval base at Sanak Island during World War II.

Although Sanak is no longer occupied, the island is still owned by its former residents, who visit the island occasionally to harvest the feral cattle that live there.

===Archaeology===
In 2004, 2006, and 2007 teams of archeologists and ecologists visited Sanak Island to study the effects of long-term human occupation on the island. Over 100 archeological sites were excavated with the oldest sites dating to 5600 years before present.

Researchers, led by investigators from Idaho State University studied both the living plants and animals as well as the remains of food animals such as fish, sea mammals, and shellfish preserved in archeological sites.

<text>Shafiq Rasul (born 15 April 1977) is a British citizen who was a detainee held at Guantanamo Bay by the United States, which treated him an unlawful combatant. His detainee ID number was 86.

His family discovered his detention when the British Foreign Office contacted them on 21 January 2002. He was released in March 2004, shortly after his return to the United Kingdom, more than three months before &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot; was decided.

In August 2004, Rasul, Asif Iqbal, and Ruhal Ahmed, all from Tipton - and known as the Tipton Three - compiled a report on their abuse and humiliation while in US custody.

In &quot;Rasul v. Rumsfeld&quot;, plaintiffs Rasul, Asif Iqbal, Ruhal Ahmed, and Jamal Al-Harith, four former Guantánamo Bay detainees, sued former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. They charge that illegal interrogation tactics were permitted to be used against them by Secretary Rumsfeld and the military chain of command.

The Hague Justice Portal gives access to the official Court documents related to &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot;.

In late February 2017, ISIL spokesmen issued a press release, stating that Jamal al-Harith, another former Guantanamo captive, had traveled to Iraq, and had used a suicide bomb to attack a military site there. Rasul denounced the attack, asserted that there was &quot;no excuse&quot; for the attack, and that he had been able to move past his experiences, and didn&#x27;t understand why al-Harith hadn&#x27;t.

<doc id="1044787" wikidata="Q420019" url="?curid=1044787" title="Silver fulminate">
<text>Silver fulminate (AgCNO) is the highly explosive silver salt of fulminic acid.

Silver fulminate is a primary explosive, but has limited use as such due to its extreme sensitivity to impact, heat, pressure, and electricity. The compound becomes progressively sensitive as it is aggregated, even in small amounts; the touch of a falling feather, the impact of a single water droplet, or a small static discharge are all capable of explosively detonating an unconfined pile of silver fulminate no larger than a dime and no heavier than a few milligrams. Aggregating larger quantities is impossible, due to the compound&#x27;s tendency to self-detonate under its own weight.

Silver fulminate was first prepared in 1800 by Edward Charles Howard in his research project to prepare a large variety of fulminates. Along with mercury fulminate, it is the only fulminate stable enough for commercial use. Detonators using silver fulminate were used to initiate picric acid in 1885, but since have been used only by the Italian Navy. The current commercial use has been in producing non-damaging novelty noisemakers as children&#x27;s toys.

==Structure==

Silver fulminate occurs in two polymorphic forms, an orthorhombic one and a trigonal one with a rhombohedral lattice. The trigonal polymorph consists of cyclic hexamers, (AgCNO)6.
==Properties==
Fulminates are toxic, about the same as cyanides. When pure, silver fulminate is chemically stable, not decomposing after years of storage. Like many silver salts, it darkens with light exposure. It is slightly soluble in cold water and can be recrystallized using hot water. It can also be recrystallized from a 20% solution of ammonium acetate. It is not hygroscopic and can explode when moist or under water; it was reported to remain explosive after 37 years under water. It explodes upon contact with concentrated sulfuric acid or chlorine or bromine, but not when contacting iodine. It is insoluble in nitric acid, but dissolves in ammonia, alkali chlorides, alkali cyanides, aniline, pyridine, and potassium iodide by forming complexes. Concentrated hydrochloric acid decomposes it non-explosively with a hissing noise; thiosulfate also decomposes it non-explosively, and can be used for disposal.

==Preparation==
This compound can be prepared by pouring a solution of silver nitrate in nitric acid into ethanol, under careful control of the reaction conditions, to avoid an explosion. The reaction is usually done at 8090 °C; at 30 °C, the precipitate may not form. Only tiny amounts of silver fulminate should be prepared at once, as even the weight of the crystals can cause them to self-detonate.
Another way to make silver fulminate is to react silver carbonate with ammonia in solution.

:4 Ag2CO3 + 4 NH3 → 4 AgCNO + 6 H2O + 4 Ag + O2

Silver fulminate also forms when nitrogen oxide gas is passed through a solution of silver nitrate in ethanol.

Silver fulminate can be prepared unintentionally, when an acidic solution of silver nitrate comes in contact with alcohol. This is a hazard in some formulations of chemically silvering mirrors.

== Novelty explosive ==

Silver fulminate, often in combination with potassium chlorate, is used in trick noise-makers known as &quot;throw-downs&quot;, &quot;crackers&quot;, &quot;snappers&quot;, &quot;whippersnappers&quot;, &quot;pop-its&quot;, or &quot;bang snaps&quot;, a popular type of novelty firework. They contain approximately 200 milligrams of fine gravel coated with a minute quantity (approximately 80 micrograms) of silver fulminate. When thrown against a hard surface, the impact is sufficient to detonate the tiny quantity of explosive, creating a small salute from the supersonic detonation. Snaps are designed to be incapable of producing damage (even when detonated against skin) due to the buffering effect provided by the much greater mass of the gravel medium. It is also the chemical found in Christmas crackers having first been used for that purpose by Tom Smith in 1860. The chemical is painted on one of two narrow strips of card, with abrasive on the second. When the cracker is pulled, the abrasive detonates the silver fulminate.

A fulminate mixture with 1020% potassium chlorate is cheaper and more brisant than the fulminate alone.

==Silver fulminate and &quot;fulminating silver&quot;==
Silver fulminate is often confused with silver nitride, silver azide, or fulminating silver. &quot;Fulminating silver&quot;, though always referring to an explosive silver-containing substance, is an ambiguous term. While it may be a synonym of silver fulminate, it may also refer to the nitride or azide, the decomposition product of Tollen&#x27;s reagent, or an alchemical mixture, which does not contain the fulminate anion.

<doc id="1044788" wikidata="Q4309761" url="?curid=1044788" title="Mews">
<text>A mews is a row or courtyard of stables and carriage houses with living quarters above them, built behind large city houses before motor vehicles replaced horses in the early twentieth century. Mews are usually located in desirable residential areas, having been built to cater for the horses, coachmen and stable-servants of prosperous residents.

The word mews comes from the Royal Mews in London, England, a set of royal stables built 500 years ago on a former royal hawk mews. The term is now commonly used in English-speaking countries for city housing of a similar design.

After the Second World War, mews were replaced by alleys and the carriage houses by garages for automobiles.

==Hawk mews==
&quot;Mews&quot; derives from the French , &#x27;to moult&#x27;, reflecting its original function to confine a hawk to a mews while it moulted. William Shakespeare deploys &quot;to mew up&quot; to mean confine, coop up, or shut up in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;: &quot;What, will you mew her up, Signor Baptista?&quot; and also &quot;Richard III&quot;: &quot;This day should Clarence closely be mewed up&quot;.

The term &quot;mews&quot; is still used today in falconry circles in English-speaking countries to refer to the housing of the birds of prey used in falconry. 

From 1377 onwards, the king&#x27;s falconry birds were kept in the King&#x27;s Mews at Charing Cross.

==Mews stables==
The first recorded use meaning stables is dated 1548, after the royal stables were built at Charing Cross, on the site of the royal hawk mews. Those royal stables moved to Buckingham Palace Road in 1820. There were also royal mews at St James&#x27;s Palace.

The name mews was taken up for domestic stables in the city during the 17th century. The 18th-century Washington Mews in Greenwich Village, New York City matches the London buildings in period, purpose and name.

&quot;Mews&quot; has since been applied to any stable buildings in any space, lane, alley or back street onto which these buildings open, and to any new residential buildings of similar character throughout the English-speaking world that have motor vehicles taking the place of horses and carriages.

==Description==
===London===


Mews was applied to service streets and the stables in them in cities, primarily London. In the 18th and 19th centuries, London housing for wealthy people generally consisted of streets of large terraced houses with stables at the back, which opened onto a small service street. The mews had horse stalls and a carriage house on the ground floor, and stable servants&#x27; living accommodation above. Generally this was mirrored by another row of stables on the opposite side of the service street, backing onto another row of terraced houses facing outward into the next street. Sometimes there were variations such as small courtyards. Most mews are named after one of the principal streets which they back onto. Most but not all have the word &quot;mews&quot; in their name.

Mews are often found in the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster (particularly Mayfair and Marylebone).

===Europe===
This arrangement was different from most of Continental Europe, where the stables in wealthy urban residences were usually off a front or central courtyard. The advantage of the British system was that it hid the sounds and smells of the stables away from the family when they were not using the horses. Nevertheless 45 of the buildings in in Amsterdam were originally the stables and coach houses of houses in Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht, between which it runs.

===Stables not known as mews===
The word &quot;mews&quot; is not used for large individual non-royal British stable blocks, a feature of country houses. For example, the grand stable block at Chatsworth House is referred to as &quot;the stables,&quot; not &quot;the mews.&quot;

==Cars==
Mews lost their equestrian function in the early 20th century when motor cars were introduced. At the same time, after World War I and especially after World War II, the number of people who could afford to live in the type of houses which had a mews attached fell sharply. One place where a mews may still be in equestrian use is Bathurst Mews in Westminster, near Hyde Park, London, where several private horses are kept. Nearby, the mews&#x27; stables have been put to commercial use. Some mews were demolished or put to commercial use, but the majority were converted into homes.

Contemporary movements to revitalise and creatively re-use historical and traditional features of urban environments have also cast some appreciative light on mews. A contemporary presentation of the some 500 former horse stables in the city of London appears in the book &quot;The Mews of London: A Guide to the Hidden Byways of London&#x27;s Past&quot; (1982), including individual chapters providing history and walking maps for mews in six districts surrounding (and adjacent to) Hyde Park: Bayswater, Notting Hill, Kensington, Belgravia, Mayfair, and Marylebone.

In 2015 a survey of the mews in London estimated that there were 391 original and surviving mews properties still in existence, and 239 which had been redeveloped. The survey classified an &quot;Authentic Mews&quot; property as &quot;A property in a Mews – a lane, alley, court, narrow passage, cul de sac or back street originally built behind houses in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries to provide access for stables or coach house accommodation (often with associated living accommodation) – that is now most likely to be a modernised residential dwelling, possibly with commercial premises. An Authentic Mews property will still retain the approximate appearance, form and footprint of the original Mews but it may have been re-developed to a degree and no longer retains all original Mews features.&quot;

==In contemporary urban planning and construction==
The use of mews in new urban development is advocated by Leon Krier, who is himself a strong influence on the New Urbanism movement in the United States. (For his foundational contributions to the movement, Krier received the first Athena Medal awarded by the Congress for the New Urbanism in 2006.)

In the Smart Growth, Traditional Neighborhood Development and New Urbanism movements, the term is used frequently, but definitions of the term are rare. The East Village Redevelopment Plan for Calgary, Alberta, Canada, explains that &quot;Mews are narrow, intimate streets that balance the access and service functions of a lane with active building frontages, accessory uses, and a street space shared by cars and pedestrians.&quot;

<text>The Keys to the Kingdom is a fantasy-adventure book series written by Garth Nix, comprising seven books published between 2003 and 2010. The series chronicles the adventures of a boy named Arthur, who becomes involved with a magical world called the &#x27;House&#x27;; he is on a quest to take back the House from seven antagonistic &#x27;Trustees&#x27;.

== Story ==
=== Plot ===
Arthur, a young boy, has a severe asthma attack one day as two mysterious people, one of which is called Monday, give him a &#x27;Key&#x27;, a magical artifact that saves his life, against Monday&#x27;s intentions. He discovers there exists a world called the &#x27;House&#x27;, which is split into seven parts, each ruled by a &#x27;Trustee&#x27;, of which Monday is one. A divine being known as the &#x27;Architect&#x27; has disappeared and left behind a &#x27;Will&#x27;, leaving the House and the seven Keys to her seven Trustees, but the Trustees have split up the Will and hidden the parts, intent on not letting the Will be fulfilled.

The first part of the Will has managed to break free and, by convenience, has chosen Arthur as the &#x27;rightful heir&#x27; who must recover the other lost parts of the Will; this has led to Monday giving up half of his Key to him. In the first book, Arthur defeats Monday and takes control of the first part of the House. Books two to five follow a somewhat regular pattern: in each, Arthur tries to gain control over one part of the House, and ultimately succeeds after various challenges, setting free one part of the Will. Each book features one main antagonist, usually the Trustee of that part of the House, with the exception of one Trustee, Wednesday, who wants the Will to be fulfilled but has been overthrown by the other Trustees. Sometimes, the Trustees sow chaos on Earth while he is away in the House.

One important recurring part of the story is Arthur limiting his use of the powerful Keys, as using them too much will turn him into an immortal, and the presence of an immortal on Earth causes harm. Past six tenths &#x27;Denizen&#x27;, the process will be irreversible.

At the end of the sixth book, Arthur has freed the sixth part of the Will but not yet claimed that part of the House, and the sixth Trustee is busy invading the domain of the seventh Trustee. In the seventh book, Arthur ultimately manages to free the last part of the Will, but then everything is destroyed and Arthur faces the divine being known as the &#x27;Architect&#x27;, who explains that the true purpose of the Will was to let her die and hand over the responsibility of being Architect to him. Having become the New Architect, he recreates the universe as it was, though the House will be made anew. He splits himself into the New Architect and a human Arthur, whom he sends back to Earth. 

=== Characters ===
*Arthur Penhaligon – A 12-year-old boy who is chosen to take back a magical world called the &#x27;House&#x27; from the seven &#x27;Trustees&#x27; and free each Trustee&#x27;s part of the &#x27;Will&#x27;
*Leaf – A 12-year-old human girl who befriends Arthur. She becomes involved with Arthur&#x27;s adventures in the House.
*Suzy Turquoise Blue – A female inhabitant of the House, a &#x27;Piper&#x27;s Child&#x27; (meaning she was brought there by the &#x27;Piper&#x27;) who chooses to work with Arthur and becomes his friend. Has been in the House for centuries, but has the appearance and behaviour of a child. 
*Fred Initial Numbers Gold – Another &#x27;Piper&#x27;s Child&#x27;, a cheerful, talkative, happy-go-lucky boy who quickly befriends Arthur.
*Dame Primus – The personification of the parts of the &#x27;Will&#x27; that Arthur has taken back so far at any point in the series.
*The Trustees – Each named after a day of the week and embodying one of the seven deadly sins; they are the rulers of the seven parts of the House and Arthur&#x27;s antagonists.
*The Mariner – A powerful independent inhabitant of the House, an ally to Arthur for most of the series.
*The Piper – Another powerful independent House creature, boss of the &#x27;Piper&#x27;s Children&#x27;. Intends to take control of the House.
*The Architect – God figure. Creator of the House and the Secondary realms. Mother of the Piper, the Mariner, and Lord Sunday.
*The Old One – Prometheus figure, condemned to the &quot;coal cellar&quot; to have his eyes gouged out every 12 hours. Husband of the architect and father of the Piper, the Mariner, and Lord Sunday.

=== World ===
Central to the story is the magical world called the House. The house is divided into seven parts, each with its Trustee:

*The Lower House – ruled by Mister Monday. Contains the prison of the divine being the &#x27;Old One&#x27;, contains the &#x27;Front Door&#x27;, which is a dome with many two-way portals including one connected with Earth, and the &#x27;Seven Dials&#x27;, which allows travel to anywhere in the universe.
*The Far Reaches – a grand cavern containing a massive pit, ruled by Grim Tuesday.
*The Border Sea – an ocean, formally the domain of Drowned Wednesday but not under her control.
*The Great Maze – a gigantic, chessboard-like battlefield, the squares of which teleport every dusk, ruled by Sir Thursday.
*The Middle House – a giant, thrice-terraced mountain, ruled by Lady Friday.
*The Upper House – a tower of nearly 2,000 floors, the place where sorcerers are trained, ruled by Superior Saturday.
*The Incomparable Gardens – the most important and oldest part of the House, a beautiful garden, ruled by Lord Sunday

House time is constant, while time in the universe is malleable; it is even possible to make it flow backwards with sufficient power, such as a Key. Thus, a day may pass on Earth while half a year passes in the House, or one might spend a year in a secondary realm only to return fifteen minutes later House time. The House has &#x27;Elevators&#x27; that allow travel between the different demesnes. There are also attachable &#x27;Wings&#x27; which are used as an everyday means of short-distance travel. The House has an internal postal service, but it is notoriously poor. In addition, there is a large number of telephones for long-distance communication.

The original inhabitants of the House are called &#x27;Denizens&#x27; and are nearly immortal, though there are a few things that can kill them. Denizens are not supposed to interfere with the normal universe, but they are capable of this to some extent (a Trustee can only interfere in the secondary realms on their &quot;day&quot;) and they do. Apart from original House creatures, there are also the &#x27;Piper&#x27;s Children&#x27; and &#x27;Raised Rats&#x27; (a group of anthropomorphic rats), which were both brought into the House by an immortal called the Piper, and so-called &#x27;Nithlings&#x27;. Nithlings are creatures that come into existence out of the magical substance &#x27;Nothing&#x27;; they can kill Denizens and go to the universe freely, becoming sprites. Hordes of Nithlings fight with the Denizens, but there are also Nithlings that are allied with the Denizens and are used, for example, to wreak havoc on Earth.

The substance called &#x27;Nothing&#x27; causes damage to things in the House and ultimately wipes it out when the Will is complete. One of the Trustees, Tuesday, makes various things out of it using his Key. The Piper creates an army of so-called &#x27;Newniths&#x27; from it.

==Books in the series==
The title of each book refers to the trustee that Arthur fights in the novel.

==Possible film adaptation==
In an interview, Garth Nix said that he was willing to sell the rights to studios and directors for an adaptation of the series, if they were &quot;the right person&quot;.
His reason is that he does not want to sell it to any studio over concerns that the studio would ruin the film. At the 2012 Texas Book Festival, Nix stated that &quot;(I) have no plans for movies but would like to see a card game.&quot;

As of 2019, Herschend Entertainment Studios have secured the film and TV rights to the series, with Nix set to act as executive producer alongside Julie Philips, the vice president of Herschend.

<doc id="1044805" wikidata="Q822225" url="?curid=1044805" title="Bernard-René Jourdan de Launay">
<text>Bernard René Jourdan, marquis de Launay (8/9 April 1740 – 14 July 1789) was a French Royal Army officer and nobleman who served as the governor of the Bastille. He was the son of a previous governor, and commander of the Bastille&#x27;s garrison when it was stormed on 14 July 1789.

== Early life ==
The marquis Bernard-René Jordan de Launay was born on the night of 8/9 April 1740 in the Bastille where his father, René Jourdan de Launay, was governor. At the age of eight, he was appointed to an honorary position in the King&#x27;s Musketeers (&quot;mousquetaires du roi&quot;). He subsequently joined the French Guards Regiment, which was permanently stationed in Paris except in time of war.

In 1776 de Launay succeeded M. de Jumilhac as governor of the Bastille. As was the custom with many senior positions under the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, the marquis purchased the office of governor from his predecessor as a form of investment. The 13 years he spent in this position were mostly uneventful, but on 19 December 1778, he reportedly made the mistake of failing to fire the cannon of the Bastille as a salute on the birth of King Louis XVI&#x27;s daughter Madame Royale. In August 1785, he was given responsibility for the imprisonment of two prime figures in the royal necklace scandal: Cardinal Louis de Rohan and Jeanne de La Motte-Valois. De Launay behaved correctly and considerately with both although the latter was an extremely difficult inmate.

Until 1777, he was Seigneur of Bretonnière in Normandy. He also owned and rented out houses in the &quot;rue Saint-Antoine&quot;, neighbouring the Bastille.

==Role on 14 July 1789: storming of the Bastille==
The permanent garrison of the Bastille, under de Launay, consisted of about 82 &quot;invalides&quot; (veteran military pensioners) no longer considered suitable for regular army service. On 12 July, in response to the growing civil urest, they were reinforced by 32 Swiss grenadiers from the Salis-Samade Regiment. 

Unlike Sombreuil, the governor of the Hôtel des Invalides, who had accepted the revolutionaries&#x27; demands earlier that day, de Launay refused to surrender the prison fortress and hand over the arms and the gunpowder stored in the cellars. He promised that he would not fire unless attacked, and he tried to negotiate with two delegates from the Hôtel de Ville, but the discussions were drawn out. Part of the impatient crowd started to enter the outer courtyard of the fortress after a small group had broken the chains securing the drawbridge.

After shouting warnings, the garrison opened fire. The besiegers interpreted that as treachery on the part of de Launay. The ensuing fighting lasted about four hours and resulted in about 100 casualties among the exposed crowd but only one death and three wounded amongst the well-protected defenders firing from loopholes and battlements.

With no source of water and only limited food supplies within the Bastille, de Launay decided to capitulate on the condition that nobody from within the fortress would be harmed. In a note passed out through an opening in the drawbridge, he threatened that he would blow up the entire fortress and the surrounding district if those conditions were rejected. De Launay&#x27;s conditions were rejected, but he nevertheless capitulated reportedly after members of the garrison prevented him from entering the cellars in which the gunpowder was stored. At about 5 p.m., firing from the fortress ceased, and the drawbridge was suddenly lowered.

De Launay was then seized, and his sword and baton of rank were torn from him. He was supposed to have been taken to the Hôtel de Ville by one of the leaders of the insurrection, the soldier Pierre-Augustin Hulin. However, on the way there, the furious crowd assaulted the governor, beat him and eventually killed him by stabbing him repeatedly with their knives, swords and bayonets and shooting him once. The actual killing was reported to have taken place near the Hôtel de Ville when the struggling de Launay, desperate and abused, cried out &quot;Enough! Let me die!&quot; and kicked an unemployed cook named Desnot in the groin.

After he had been killed, Launay&#x27;s head was sawn off by Mathieu Jouve Jourdan, a butcher. It was fixed on a pike, carried through the streets for some hours, and thrown into the Seine the next day. Three officers of the Bastille&#x27;s permanent garrison and two of their veterans were also lynched, and two of the Swiss were unaccounted for. However, most of the defenders were escorted through the mob by French Guards, who had joined the attackers, and were eventually released.

==Family, legacy and character==
De Launay had three daughters by two wives. Some of his brother&#x27;s descendants (Boris Delaunay and Vadim Delaunay) settled in Russia.

Historian Simon Schama describes de Launay as a &quot;reasonably conscientious if somewhat dour&quot; functionary, who treated prisoners more humanely than his predecessors had. The Marquis de Sade, who had been transferred from the Bastille to another prison shortly before 14 July, commented that de Launay was &quot;a so-called marquis whose grandfather was a servant&quot;.
The officer commanding the Swiss detachment sent to reinforce de Launay, Lieutenant Deflue, subsequently accused his late superior of military incompetence, inexperience and irresolution, which he had allegedly displayed before the siege. Deflue&#x27;s report, which was copied into the log book of his regiment and has survived, may not be fair to de Launay, who was put in an impossible position by the failure of the senior officers commanding the Royal troops concentrated in and around Paris to provide him with effective support. However Marshal de Broglie, who as Minister of War was in overall charge of the abortive efforts to suppress the disturbances of 1789, had written on 5 July that &quot;there are two sources of anxiety concerning the Bastille; the person of the commandant (de Launay) and the nature of the garrison there&quot;.

The killing of de Launay is described graphically in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (Book II, Chapter 21) and also in Hilary Mantel&#x27;s &quot;A Place of Greater Safety&quot;.

<text>Lawrence Taylor Shaw (November 9, 1924 – April 1, 1985) was an American Hugo Award-winning science fiction fan, author, editor and literary agent who usually published as Larry T. Shaw.

Shaw joined a group of science fiction writers known as the Futurians during the early 1940s. From 1948 through the early 1950s, he wrote short fiction before becoming an editor for the magazines &quot;If&quot; and later &quot;Infinity Science Fiction&quot;. He published Harlan Ellison&#x27;s first magazine story &quot;Glowworm&quot; (1955) in &quot;Infinity Science Fiction&quot;, after Ellison&#x27;s first sale to EC Comics.

From 1954 to 1955 Shaw edited &quot;Rodding and Re-Styling&quot;, an automotive sports magazine.

After those magazines terminated during 1958, Shaw edited monster movie magazines, automotive magazines and other material until 1963, when he began editing for Irwin Stein&#x27;s company Lancer Books. He continued working as an editor until 1975, when he began work mainly as a literary agent. He received a Special Hugo Award during 1984 for lifetime achievement as an editor.

<text>Lee Hoffman, born Shirley Bell Hoffman, (August 14, 1932 in Chicago, Illinois – February 6, 2007 in Port Charlotte, Florida) was an American science fiction fan, an editor of early folk music fanzines, and an author of science fiction, Western and romance novels.

==Career==
In 1950–53, she edited and published the highly regarded science fiction fanzine, &quot;Quandry&quot;. In November 1951, she began publication of &quot;Science-Fiction Five-Yearly&quot;, which has appeared regularly since then (the 2006 issue ran 58 pages). Hoffman used a gender-neutral name within science fiction fandom, and many believed that she was a man. In 1951, she &#x27;came out&#x27; as a leading editor of the science fiction fanzine &quot;Quandry&quot; at the 1951 World Science Fiction Convention. Briefly married to editor Larry Shaw from 1956 to 1958, she was the assistant editor on the science fiction magazines he edited, &quot;Infinity Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Science Fiction Adventures&quot;. During that same time, she began editing and publishing her folk music publications, &quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;Gardyloo&quot;, which found a readership through Izzy Young&#x27;s Folklore Center as the folk music scene expanded during the late 1950s.

Hoffman won the Western Writers of America Spur Award for her novel &quot;The Valdez Horses&quot; (Doubleday, 1967). In Spain, John Sturges directed the 1973 film adaptation, &quot;The Valdez Horses&quot;/&quot;Valdez, il Mezzosangue&quot; (aka &quot;Chino&quot;), starring Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland. Under the pseudonym Georgia York, she wrote historical romances for Fawcett Books during the years 1979 to 1983.

In her autobiographical writings, she described the mid-1960s events that led to her Western novels:
:Ted White became a very good friend. He was great company, interested in just about everything. He was an excellent artist and an expert in jazz and comic books as well as any number of other subjects. He&#x27;d started writing science-fiction professionally, and shared his enthusiasm, inspiring me to try writing a book myself. A Western came most naturally to me. It was a typical horse opera very much in the tradition of the Western paperbacks I&#x27;d enjoyed for so long. Don and Jo Meisner critiqued the manuscript for me. Ted read it and encouraged me to submit it.

:Another friend, Terry Carr, was assistant to the editor, Don Wollheim, at Ace Books. Ace had a reputation for giving new writers a break. I submitted my manuscript to Terry. I hadn&#x27;t yet gotten a response on it, when Terry phoned and asked me if I &quot;had time&quot; to write a comic Western. I had plenty of time, but wasn&#x27;t sure I had the ability. Terry had faith that I did. I wrote some chapters and an outline. Ace bought it, and published it ahead of the action Western I&#x27;d done first. I couldn&#x27;t think of titles, so Terry provided names for both of them, &quot;The Legend of Blackjack Sam&quot; for the comic one, and &quot;Gunfight at Laramie&quot; for the horse opera.

:The literary agent, Henry Morrison, was a longtime fan. He handled Ted White and some other friends who had become professional writers. He accepted me as a client. With two sales, and another book in the works I quit working regular hours for other people.

She went on to write seventeen Western novels between the years 1966 and 1977 for several publishers—Ace, Avon, Ballantine, Dell, Doubleday, Dell, NAL/Signet—with various editions in Germany, Italy and the UK.

During that same time period, she wrote four science fiction novels: &quot;Telepower&quot; (Belmont, 1967), &quot;The Caves of Karst&quot; (Ballantine, 1969), &quot;Always the Black Knight&quot; (Avon, 1970) and &quot;Change Song&quot; (Doubleday, 1972). Her short stories include &quot;Soundless Evening&quot;, published in Harlan Ellison&#x27;s &quot;Again, Dangerous Visions&quot; (1972).

In 1987, Hoffman was presented the Rebel Award, a lifetime achievement award for a science fiction fan &quot;who has done a great deal for Southern Fandom.&quot;

==Death==
She died in Port Charlotte, Florida of a massive heart attack on February 6, 2007.

<doc id="1044819" wikidata="Q741247" url="?curid=1044819" title="MD2 (hash function)">
<text>The MD2 Message-Digest Algorithm is a cryptographic hash function developed by Ronald Rivest in 1989. The algorithm is optimized for 8-bit computers. MD2 is specified in IETF RFC 1319. The &quot;MD&quot; in MD2 stands for &quot;Message Digest&quot;.

Even though MD2 is not yet fully compromised, the IETF retired MD2 to &quot;historic&quot; status in 2011, citing &quot;signs of weakness&quot;. It is deprecated in favor of SHA-256 and other strong hashing algorithms.

Nevertheless, , it remained in use in public key infrastructures as part of certificates generated with MD2 and RSA.

==Description==

The 128-bit hash value of any message is formed by padding it to a multiple of the block length (128 bits or 16 bytes) and adding a 16-byte checksum to it. For the actual calculation, a 48-byte auxiliary block and a 256-byte S-table are used. The constants were generated by shuffling the integers 0 through 255 using a variant of Durstenfeld&#x27;s algorithm with a pseudorandom number generator based on decimal digits of (pi) (see nothing up my sleeve number). The algorithm runs through a loop where it permutes each byte in the auxiliary block 18 times for every 16 input bytes processed. Once all of the blocks of the (lengthened) message have been processed, the first partial block of the auxiliary block becomes the hash value of the message.

The S-table values in hex are:

 { 0x29, 0x2E, 0x43, 0xC9, 0xA2, 0xD8, 0x7C, 0x01, 0x3D, 0x36, 0x54, 0xA1, 0xEC, 0xF0, 0x06, 0x13,

==MD2 hashes==
The 128-bit (16-byte) MD2 hashes (also termed &quot;message digests&quot;) are typically represented as 32-digit hexadecimal numbers. The following demonstrates a 43-byte ASCII input and the corresponding MD2 hash:

 MD2(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;) = 
 03d85a0d629d2c442e987525319fc471

As the result of the avalanche effect in MD2, even a small change in the input message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a completely different hash. For example, changing the letter to in the message results in:

 MD2(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;) = 
 6b890c9292668cdbbfda00a4ebf31f05

The hash of the zero-length string is:

 MD2(&quot;&quot;) = 
 8350e5a3e24c153df2275c9f80692773

==Security==
Rogier and Chauvaud presented in 1995 collisions of MD2&#x27;s compression function, although they were unable to extend the attack to the full MD2. The described collisions was published in 1997.

In 2004, MD2 was shown to be vulnerable to a preimage attack with time complexity equivalent to 2104 applications of the compression function. The author concludes, &quot;MD2 can no longer be considered a secure one-way hash function&quot;.

In 2008, MD2 has further improvements on a preimage attack with time complexity of 273 compression function evaluations and memory requirements of 273 message blocks.

In 2009, MD2 was shown to be vulnerable to a collision attack with time complexity of 263.3 compression function evaluations and memory requirements of 252 hash values. This is slightly better than the birthday attack which is expected to take 265.5 compression function evaluations.

In 2009, security updates were issued disabling MD2 in OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and Network Security Services.

<doc id="1044821" wikidata="Q3309308" url="?curid=1044821" title="Primitive Methodist Church">
<text>The Primitive Methodist Church is a Methodist Christian denomination within the holiness movement. It began in England in the early 19th century, with the influence of American evangelist Lorenzo Dow (1777–1834).

In the United States, the Primitive Methodist Church had eighty-three parishes and 8,487 members in 1996. In Great Britain and Australia, the Primitive Methodist Church merged with other denominations, to form the Methodist Church of Great Britain in 1932 and the Methodist Church of Australasia in 1901. The latter subsequently merged into the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977.

==History==
===United Kingdom ===
The leaders who originated Primitive Methodism were attempting to restore a spirit of revivalism as they felt was found in the ministry of John Wesley, with no intent of forming a new church. The leaders were Hugh Bourne (1772–1852) and William Clowes (1780–1851), preachers in the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Bourne had joined a Methodist society at Burslem, but business taking him at the close of 1800 to the colliery district of Harriseahead and Kidsgrove, he was so impressed by the prevailing ignorance that he began a religious revival of the district, and Clowes joined him in 1805.

The two preachers heard from Lorenzo Dow of the results of American camp meetings, and held a fourteen-hour camp meeting on May 31, 1807, at Mow Cop on the Staffordshire and Cheshire border, which resulted in many converts. But the Wesleyan Church refused to admit these converts to the church, and reprimanded Bourne and Clowes. Refusing to cease holding open-air meetings, they were dismissed from the church. For a while they took separate paths, but after waiting two years for readmittance to the church, they founded the Primitive Methodists in the year of 1810. Clowes&#x27;s personality drew a number of strong men after him, and a society meeting held in a kitchen and then in a warehouse became the nucleus of a circuit, a chapel being built at Tunstall in July 1811, and there in February 1812 they took the name &quot;The Society of the Primitive Methodists&quot;. The name is meant to indicate they were conducting themselves in the way of Wesley and the &quot;original&quot; Methodists, particularly in reference to open-air meetings and allowing female ministry. The last of the women roving preachers died in 1890.

Primitive Methodist workers played an important role in the formative phase of the Trade Union movement in England. They were always the most working class of the main Methodist bodies in Great Britain. They also used women at an early date as ministers (&quot;itinerants&quot;) and preachers, a notable development in women&#x27;s emancipation.

The Primitive Methodist Church formed one of the three streams of Methodism then extant in England. In 1932 it merged with the Wesleyan Methodist Church and the United Methodists to form the Methodist Church of Great Britain. The story of Primitive Methodism is kept alive at Englesea Brook, the museum of Primitive Methodism.

===United States===
The first missionaries to America arrived in Brooklyn, New York, in 1829. The societies founded in the United States were under the control of the British Primitive Methodist Conference until 1840, when the &quot;American Primitive Methodist Church&quot; was established on September 16. A combining of various organizational structures occurred in May 1975, and the current (2004) official name—&quot;The Primitive Methodist Church in the United States of America&quot;—was chosen.

The denomination holds an annual conference. A president, elected every four years, is the chief leader of the denomination and their headquarters are located in his home. In 2000 the American body had 79 congregations with 4502 members.

===Australia===
Primitive Methodist congregations were also established in Australia. In 1902 the Primitive Methodist Church, Wesleyan Methodist Church, Bible Christians and the United Methodist Free Churches formed the Methodist Church of Australasia. In 1977 the Methodist Church of Australasia joined with the Congregational Union of Australia and Presbyterian Church of Australia to form the Uniting Church in Australia.

==Beliefs==
The Primitive Methodist Church recognizes the dominical sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion, as well as other rites, such as Holy Matrimony.

==Missions==
The Primitive Methodist Church in the United States has missions in Spain, Guatemala and other countries throughout the world. Its mission work in Africa dates back to 1897 and its mission work in Guatemala was started in 1921.

==Ecumenical relations==
The Primitive Methodist Church in the United States, with respect to ecumenism, is a member of the Christian Holiness Partnership, an organization of churches in the Wesleyan–Arminian tradition, and a member of the National Association of Evangelicals.

<doc id="1044822" wikidata="Q21129" url="?curid=1044822" title="Elodea">
<text>Elodea is a genus of eight species of aquatic plants often called the waterweeds described as a genus in 1803. Classified in the frog&#x27;s-bit family (Hydrocharitaceae), &quot;Elodea&quot; is native to the Americas and is also widely used as aquarium vegetation and laboratory demonstrations of cellular activities. It lives in fresh water. An older name for this genus is &quot;Anacharis&quot;, which serves as a common name in North America.

The introduction of some species of &quot;Elodea&quot; into waterways in parts of Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand has created a significant problem and it is now considered a noxious weed in these areas.

&quot;Elodea canadensis&quot;, sometimes called American or Canadian water weed or pond weed, is widely known as the generic water weed. The use of these names causes it to be confused with similar-looking plants, like Brazilian elodea (&quot;Elodea densa&quot;) or hydrilla (&quot;Hydrilla verticillata&quot;). American water weed is an attractive aquarium plant and is a good substitute for Brazilian elodea. It can be used for science experiments in classrooms demonstrating how plants use carbon dioxide with the usage of bromothymol blue.

The American water weed lives entirely underwater with the exception of small white flowers which bloom at the surface and are attached to the plant by delicate stalks. It produces winter buds from the stem tips that overwinter on the lake bottom. It also often overwinters as an evergreen plant in mild climates. In the Autumn, leafy stalks will detach from the parent plant, float away, root, and start new plants. This is the American water weed&#x27;s most important method of spreading, while seed production plays a relatively minor role.

Silty sediments and water rich in nutrients favor the growth of American water weed in nutrient-rich lakes. However, the plants will grow in a wide range of conditions, from very shallow to deep water, and in many sediment types. It can even continue to grow uprooted, as floating fragments. It is found throughout temperate North America, where it is one of the most common aquatic plants.

American water weed is an important part of lake ecosystems. It provides good habitat for many aquatic invertebrates and cover for young fish and amphibians. Waterfowl, especially ducks, as well as beaver, muskrat and aquatic turtles eat this plant. It is also of economic importance as an attractive and easy to keep aquarium plant, although in the states of Alabama, New Hampshire, New York, and South Carolina it has been deemed Elodea densa an invasive species and is illegal to sell.

;Species
# &quot;Elodea bifoliata&quot; – Canada (AB, SK), W United States (OR + CA to NM + MN) 
# &quot;Elodea callitrichoides&quot; – Argentina, Uruguay
# &quot;Elodea canadensis&quot; – most of United States + Canada
# &quot;Elodea densa&quot; 
# &quot;Elodea granatensis&quot; – much of South America
# &quot;Elodea heterostemon&quot; 
# &quot;Elodea najas&quot; 
# &quot;Elodea nuttallii&quot; – much of United States + Canada 
# &quot;Elodea potamogeton&quot; – Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador

== Chemical control ==
Chemical methods are ineffective in eradicating Elodea – at best they only slow growth for a season or two. As Elodea spreads into new ecosystems, it experiences rapid growth for 5–6 years and then slows as soil nutrients are used up. Elodea is threatening aquatic environments across Europe. Chemicals may be used in places that cause undue economic concerns, but very few aquatic herbicides are registered for aquatic use in the EU. Fluridone, the most commonly used aquatic herbicide is highly effective against Hydrilla, but only marginally effective against Elodea, especially at lower use rates.

== Mechanical control ==

The plants can also be removed from lakes and rivers mechanically. They are extracted either by hand or by using rakes, chains, mowing boats or weed buckets. The problem is that through vegetative reproduction via fragments, mechanical removal methods can contribute to the spread of the plant. Torn fragments can be transported downstream or are introduced to new environments via attachment to boats and anchor chains.

<doc id="1044842" wikidata="Q2412868" url="?curid=1044842" title="Kinnikuman">
<text>is a Japanese manga series created by the duo Yoshinori Nakai and Takashi Shimada, known as Yudetamago. It follows Suguru Kinniku, a superhero who must win a wrestling tournament to retain the title of prince of Planet Kinniku. Nakai and Takashi planned the series when they were attending high school originally as a parody to &quot;Ultraman&quot;.

The manga was originally published in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1979 to 1987, and was first adapted by Toei Animation into a 137-episode anime series broadcast on Nippon Television from 1983 to 1986. It restarted publication in 2011 in Shueisha&#x27;s web magazine &quot;Shū Play News&quot;, and has spawned spin-off manga and anime series, video games, anime films, and several &quot;Kinnikuman&quot;-related merchandise.

There is also a sequel, the manga that was serialized in &quot;Weekly Playboy&quot; between 1998 and 2004. It was published in North America by Viz Media under the title of &quot;Ultimate Muscle&quot;. It was also adapted into three different television series, all of which were broadcast on TV Tokyo in Japan and released in North America by 4Kids Entertainment.

&quot;Kinnikuman&quot; is one of the best-selling manga series in Japan, selling over 77 million copies by 2021. As popular as was the anime series and its merchandise, such as Kinkeshi, a line of action figures released as M.U.S.C.L.E. in North America. It received the Shogakukan Manga Award for children&#x27;s manga in 1984.

A new anime television series adaptation produced by Production I.G, based on the 2011 revival manga and celebrating the 40th anniversary of the original anime television series, aired from July to September 2024 on CBC and TBS&#x27; programming block , and is to be streamed worldwide on Netflix. The second season premiered on the same programming block in January 2025.

==Plot==
===&quot;Kinnikuman&quot;===

The story involves Kinnikuman (real name Suguru Kinniku), a clumsy, foolish, comical superhero who discovers that he is the missing prince of the planet Kinniku (known for producing the greatest superheroes in the universe). Since he is a clumsy fool, however, he must prove himself worthy of the throne. To do so he enters wrestling competitions and battles evil Chojin, culminating in a tournament between Kinnikuman and five pretenders to the throne: Kinnikuman Big Body, Soldier, Zebra, Mariposa and Super Phoenix. Many of Kinnikuman&#x27;s allies begin as villains (Ramenman, Buffalo Man, Ashuraman and Warsman) or arrogant heroes (Terryman, Robin Mask and Wolfman). The heroes and villains are collectively known as , which literally means &quot;supermen&quot;.

===&quot;Ultimate Muscle&quot;===

Mantaro Muscle (also known as Kid Muscle, &quot;Mantaro Kinniku&quot; in the Japanese version) is the spoiled son of superhero wrestler King Muscle (&quot;Kinnikuman&quot; in the Japanese version). After 28 years of peace, the Seigi Choujins&#x27; (Muscle League) old enemies regroup and form the Demon Manufacturing Plant (dMp, known in the English version as Destruction, Mayhem and Pain). The Muscle League has lost its edge and are overwhelmed by the young, well-trained fighters. Recognizing their weakness, the Seigi Chojin reopen the Hercules Factory (a school for superheroes) and begin training a new generation of heroes to take on the dMp. At first unwilling, Mantaro (Kid Muscle) is one of the young heroes and defeats his father to prove his readiness to graduate. He and the other new Seigi Choujin defeat several members of the dMp and meet Kevin Mask, who quits dMp when he discovers their lack of honor. They also battle Sunshine and his pupils, who destroy the dMp after developing a renewed respect for the fighting spirit of the Seigi Choujins. The manga continues with the New Generation Replacement Tournament, Mantaro&#x27;s challenge to master his inherited potential (&quot;Kajiba no Kuso Chikara&quot;, &quot;burning inner strength&quot; or &quot;the fire&quot;), the return of the Chojin Olympics, a fight with the Demon Seed (a villainous group), a backstory for Robin Mask and a tag-team tournament set in the past. Although the manga begins as a fairly lighthearted, humorous (albeit violent) story, later arcs (the No Respect and Demon Seed storylines in particular) have a darker tone and frequently deal with psychological trauma.

==Media==
===Manga===

Yoshinori Nakai and Takashi Shimada (collectively known as &quot;Yudetamago&quot;), friends since fourth grade, decided to create a manga series in high school. Before its regular publication, the series (originally a parody of &quot;Ultraman&quot;) was released as two one-shots in Shueisha&#x27;s magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in December 1978 and March 1979: which won the Akatsuka Award, and &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; was serliazed in the same magazine from the May 28, 1979, to the May 4, 1987 issues. Shueisha collected its 387 chapters into 36 , releasing them from February 15, 1980, to April 15, 1988.

The first 36 volumes were re-published as part of the &quot;Jump Comics Selection&quot; line in 26 volumes from July 19, 1994, to August 26, 1996, as part of the &quot;Jump Comics Deluxe&quot; line in 18 volumes from January 14 to November 18, 1999, and on June 6, 2013, all 36 were published in format.

A one-shot, , was published in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Kakutō Ace&quot; in January 1996. Despite the title, the series only began regular publication on November 28, 2011, in &quot;Shū Play News&quot;, Shueisha&#x27;s web version of &quot;Weekly Playboy&quot;. The 37th was released on January 29, 2010, and the latest—the 87th volume—was released on January 4, 2025. Starting on July 5, 2012, e-book volumes began to be published as part of the &quot;Jump Comics Digital&quot; line; the latest digital volume publication date coincides with the print edition.

Since the series&#x27; 2011 restart, Yudetamago has published two related one-shots in Shueisha&#x27;s magazines. In 2015, a 43-page one-shot titled &quot;Kinnikuman Chōjin Retsuden&quot; (Kinnikuman Superman Biographies) was released in &quot;Grand Jump&quot; to unfold the story of &quot;supermen&quot; characters. Four years later, the 47-page &quot;Sayonara, Kinnikuman!! no Maki&quot; (The &#x27;Goodbye, Kinnikuman&#x27; Story) appeared in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, depicting these supermen&#x27;s arrival during the main character&#x27;s retirement ceremony.

====Sequel and spin-offs====
The first manga spun off from &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; was , a series focused on Ramenman which was published in &quot;Fresh Jump&quot; from 1982 to 1988. It was compiled into twelve volumes released between 1983 and 1989. In 1998 and 1999, &quot;Tatakae!! Ramenman&quot; was re-published in 9 volumes, in 2002 in 8 volumes, between 2004 and 2006 in 12 volumes, and in 2009 in 5 volumes. Toei Animation adapted it into a 35-episode anime series, which was broadcast from January 10 to September 11, 1988. In 1988, a film was released on July, and a video game on August. On March 21, 2009, the anime series and film were released in a box set. Also, a spin-off of &quot;Tatake!! Ramenman&quot;, subtitled , was released in 1995.

With the manga&#x27;s popularity, Bandai produced a brand of eraser-like action figures (keshi) titled Kinkeshi between 1983 and 1987. In Japan, Bandai has released 418 different types of figures, and it was mainly sold through Gashapon. As it attracted the Northern American market&#x27;s interest, it was brought out by Mattel under the name M.U.S.C.L.E., and a total of 236 figures were traded domestically in the 1980s. 

In 2007, Toei asked fans if they would like to see all 418 figure types included in the &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; complete box set. On December 20, 2008, the box set with all the two first series episodes, all seven films, a TV special, and all the figures was released. 

Aside from this most known series of products, a myriad of other &quot;Kinnikuman&quot;-based merchandise were released both in Japan and in the America, which vary from action figures to plush dolls, from key holders to pen drives, from picture books to trading card games.

==Reception==
The manga series has received several awards and sold well during both its 1980s serialization and its 2010s revival. In 1984, &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; won the 30th Shogakukan Manga Award in the category Best Children&#x27;s Manga. The 2013 edition of Takarajimasha&#x27;s guidebook &quot;Kono Manga ga Sugoi!&quot;, a survey of the manga and publishing industries, named &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; the seventh-best manga series for male readers. Media Factory&#x27;s &quot;Da Vinci&quot; magazine ranked it 23rd on the &quot;Book of the Year&quot; in 2019. Several volumes of the series have been featured on Oricon&#x27;s weekly chart of best-selling manga in Japan; all volumes between the 40th and the 66th have reached the top 20. Between 2008 and 2010, five volumes of &quot;Kinnikuman II Sei: Kyūkyoku no Chōjin Tag Hen&quot; also ranked on Oricon&#x27;s top 30 list. The series as whole has sold more than 77 million copies in Japan as of 2021. As well as &quot;Kinnikuman&quot;″s manga was considered a hit, the series&#x27; merchandise in general was also successful. Bandai reports that over 180 million units of Kinkeshi were sold in Japan. Shaenon K. Garrity said, &quot;The M.U.S.C.L.E. figurines ... were the sole American extrusion of a 1980s manga/anime/licensing phenomenon.&quot;

The original 1983 anime series was popular, premiering with a rating over 20 percent. Despite being considered &quot;too old to be marketable on American television&quot; by 4Kids in the 2000s, the 2008 &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; complete box set had 25,000 reservation requests by August in Japan. In 2005, Japanese television network TV Asahi conducted a &quot;Top 100&quot; online web poll and nationwide survey; &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; placed 97th in the online poll and &quot;Ultimate Muscle&quot; placed 39th in the survey. In 2006, TV Asahi conducted another online poll for the top one hundred anime, and &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; placed 12th in the &quot;Celebrity List&quot;. In France, however, it caused some controversy because of the depiction of a character&#x27;s garment featuring a swastika; the episode in which the character appeared was requested to be removed from air.

Garrity called &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; a &quot;cross between superhero parody and pro-wrestling goofiness&quot;. Liann Cooper of the Anime News Network said that the &quot;artwork alone is enough to clothesline itself and the whole concept of superhero wrestlers is like a manga-fied &quot;Mucha Lucha&quot;&quot;, but &quot;Ultimate Muscle&quot; &quot;is actually pretty funny&quot;. Eduardo M. Chavez of Mania.com wrote that in 1979, &quot;the series relied on its comedy and action to bring in an audience.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Muscle&quot;, while &quot;keeping some of the old silliness&quot;, adds &quot;some depth through a mature writing style and better action scenes.&quot; On T.H.E.M Anime Reviews, Christi wrote, &quot;Overall, &quot;Ultimate Muscle&quot; is the best thing about the FoxBox anthology.&quot; She praised the &quot;funny, and in their own disgusting way, charming&quot; characters, its &quot;crisp and well-done&quot; animation and the &quot;very clean and appealing&quot; character designs.

===Legacy===
Widely regarded as a classic manga series, it has been cited by &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; creator Hiromu Arakawa as a series she &quot;love[s]&quot; and as an influence to her work, as well as by &quot;Fairy Tail&quot;″s Hiro Mashima. &quot;Assassination Classroom&quot;″s Yūsei Matsui cited it as one of his favorite manga, while Yoshihiro Togashi was influenced by &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; on shifting the focus of his &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; from occult detective fiction to the martial arts genre based on a similar shift &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; did from comedy to action.

Moreover, &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; has inspired real life wrestling events. At the Fight Entertainment Group&#x27;s Dynamite!! 2008 martial arts event at the Saitama Super Arena, Bob Sapp fought Kid Muscle (played by Akihiko Tanaka) in an MMA match. Toei Animation announced a Kinnikumania 2009 wrestling event, scheduled at the JCB Hall in Tokyo Dome City on May 29, 2009, for the manga&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

Kinnikuman&#x27;s enduring popularity is also shown by it being used to co-promote &quot;Green Lantern&quot; in 2011 for the Japanese release of the film, and other characters of it appearing other merchandise, such as a series-themed , and a pollen mask advertisement.

<text>is a Japanese manga artist. His manga series, &quot;Naruto&quot;, which was in serialization from 1999 to 2014, has sold over 250 million copies worldwide in 46 countries as of May 2019. The series has been adapted into two anime and multiple films, video games, and related media. Besides the &quot;Naruto&quot; manga, Kishimoto also personally supervised the two canonical anime films, &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and has written several one-shot stories. In 2019, Kishimoto wrote &quot;Samurai 8: The Tale of Hachimaru&quot; which ended in March 2020. From May 2016 through October 2020 he supervised the &quot;&quot; manga written by Ukyō Kodachi and illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto. In November 2020 it was announced that he had taken over as writer on the series, replacing Kodachi.

A reader of manga from a young age, Kishimoto showed a desire to write his own manga, citing authors Akira Toriyama and Katsuhiro Otomo as his main influences. As a result, Kishimoto spent several years working to write his own &quot;shōnen manga&quot; for &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine which he was a fan of.

==Early life==
Masashi Kishimoto was born in Okayama Prefecture, Japan on November 8, 1974, as the older identical twin of Seishi Kishimoto. His home was close to Hiroshima where his grandfather originated. Kishimoto&#x27;s grandfather often told him about stories of war and how it was related to grudges. During his childhood, Kishimoto showed interest in drawing characters from the anime shows he watched, such as &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;″s Arale and &quot;Doraemon&quot;″s titular protagonist.

In elementary school, Kishimoto started watching the &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; anime alongside his brother. During the following years, Kishimoto started idolizing &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;″s creator Akira Toriyama, enjoying not only his series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, but also &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, a series of role-playing video games for which Toriyama is the character designer. While he could not afford to buy &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; where the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga was published, he followed the series thanks to a friend from school who had subscribed to the magazine. By high school, Kishimoto started losing interest in manga as he started playing baseball and basketball, sports he practiced at his school. However, upon seeing a poster for the animated film &quot;Akira&quot;, Kishimoto became fascinated with the way the illustration was made and wished to imitate the series&#x27; creator Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s style. Other series he enjoyed reading are &quot;Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade;&quot; &quot;Ninku;&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;.

During his last years before graduating from Kyushu Sangyo University, Kishimoto spent time drawing manga and went to an art college with the hopes of becoming a manga artist. Upon entering college, Kishimoto decided he should try creating a Chanbara manga since &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; had not published a title from that genre. However, during the same year, Kishimoto started reading Hiroaki Samura&#x27;s &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot; and Nobuhiro Watsuki&#x27;s &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; (the latter of which was published in &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;), which used the said genre. Kishimoto recalls having never been surprised by manga ever since reading &quot;Akira&quot; and found that he still was not able to compete against them.

In his second year of college, Kishimoto started drawing manga for magazine contests. However, he noted that his works were similar to &quot;seinen manga&quot;, aimed towards an adult demographic, rather than the &quot;shōnen manga&quot; read by children and teenagers. Wishing to write a manga for &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; (which targets a young demographic), Kishimoto found his style unsuitable for the magazine. When watching the anime series &quot;Hashire Melos!&quot;, Kishimoto was surprised by the character designs employed by the animators and he started researching works from animators. He later met Tetsuya Nishio, the designer from the anime adaptation of the manga &quot;Ninku,&quot; whom he deemed a big influence. Having emulated the drawing style of multiple character designers from anime series, Kishimoto noted that his own style began to resemble that of &quot;shōnen&quot; series.

== Career ==
=== Early works ===
Kishimoto&#x27;s first successful manga pilot was , which he submitted to Shueisha in 1995. This earned him an honorable mention in Shueisha&#x27;s monthly &quot;Hop Step Award&quot; in 1996, granted to promising rookie manga artists. At this point he was assigned an editor, Kosuke Yahagi, and worked on a number of rejected drafts including a slice-of-life manga, , and an action manga, . In 1997, he wrote a one-shot version of which was published in &quot;Akamaru Jump Summer&quot;.

In December 1997, while redeveloping &quot;Karakuri&quot; for serialization, Kishimoto was offered a one-shot in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. The new version of &quot;Karakuri&quot; debuted two weeks later in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump 1998 No. 4-5&quot;, but was hampered by the sudden deadline and performed poorly in reader surveys, being canceled immediately.

Following the failure of &quot;Karakuri&quot;, Kishimoto reduced his output and began moving in a seinen direction with drafts for a baseball manga, , and a mafia manga, , hoping to find better luck with a seinen magazine. Yahagi persuaded him to give the shōnen genre one last shot and Kishimoto began working on storyboards for a fantasy one-shot, , but stopped when Yahagi called and asked him to instead develop storyboards for serialization. The two decided to submit a version of &quot;Naruto&quot; with a reworked story and world and produced storyboards for the first three chapters, winning a spot in the magazine. With a six-month lead time, Kishimoto repeatedly revised and redrew the first several chapters of the series.

=== &quot;Naruto&quot; ===
In September 1999, the serialized version of &quot;Naruto&quot; premiered in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump 1999 No. 43&quot; and quickly became a hit. It ended on November 10, 2014, after more than 15 years of serialization, with a total of 700 chapters collected in 72 volumes. Sales have exceeded 113 million copies in Japan and over 95 million copies in the US, followed by over 93 million copies worldwide (outside Japan and United States) as of volume 36. This makes total sales for the series approximately 301 million copies.

Kishimoto was also the winner of &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; for the series in the Agency for Cultural Affairs. It was adapted into two successful anime series, 
&quot;Naruto&quot; and &quot;Naruto Shippuden&quot;. Kishimoto requested that Tetsuya Nishio oversee the character designs of &quot;Naruto&quot; when the manga was adapted into an anime series. The &quot;Naruto&quot; manga series became one of Viz Media&#x27;s top properties, accounting for nearly 10% of all manga sales in the US in 2006. The seventh volume of Viz&#x27;s release became the first manga to ever win a Quill Award when it claimed the award for &quot;Best Graphic Novel&quot; in 2006.

War is a theme Kishimoto wanted to tell in the manga based on the Hiroshima crisis he was told from his grandfather. Despite understanding that war has no good side, Kishimoto wrote the concept of war in &quot;Naruto&quot; with a hopeful theme. Responding to &quot;Naruto&quot;&#x27;s success, Kishimoto said in &quot;Naruto Collector Winter 2007/2008&quot; that he was &quot;very glad that the American audience has accepted an understood ninja. It shows that the American audience has good taste... because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them.&quot; While writing the manga, Kishimoto met Eiichiro Oda, author of &quot;One Piece&quot; who he considered his rival. When &quot;Naruto&quot; ended, Oda left a message in the series&#x27; final volume acknowledging him as a rival. According to Kishimoto &quot;That felt so gratifying.&quot;

Additionally, before the anime adaptation&#x27;s premiere of &quot;My Hero Academia&quot;, he praised Kōhei Horikoshi&#x27;s work, believing it would be a success overseas. Additionally, Kishimoto referred to Yoshihiro Togashi as one of his favorite artists.

For the video game &quot;Tekken 6&quot;, Kishimoto redesigned its new character, Lars Alexandersson. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama said he was attracted by this design and thus asked the &quot;Tekken&quot; staff if he could include Lars in the video game &quot;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2&quot;. For &quot;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution&quot;, Kishimoto was responsible for Mecha Naruto upon being suggested by the staff to include a new character. Kishimoto decided on adding a character that would create a big impact worldwide, which resulted in Mecha Naruto. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama was surprised when seeing the new character.

For the ninth &quot;Naruto&quot; film, &quot;Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie&quot;, Kishimoto was responsible for both the story planning and the characters&#x27; designs. The designs used for the film were the designs Kishimoto made for a planned Part 3 of Naruto, however that idea was scrapped for Boruto so they were repurposed for The Last. To promote the film, Kishimoto worked in &quot;Motion Comic Naruto,&quot; a DVD that showed scenes from the manga in 3D that was given to the first 1.5 million people who went to the cinema. Regarding &quot;Naruto&quot;″s publication, Kishimoto told Tetsuya Nishio in July 2012 that the series would take over a year and a half to end. However, Kishimoto admitted that it now appears that the manga will continue beyond that timeframe.

Throughout 2014, Kishimoto supervised the film &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot;, which would act as a bridge connecting the series&#x27; conclusion and epilogue, providing the story concept and character designs. The &quot;Naruto&quot; series finally concluded on November 10, 2014, with &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; premiering a month later on December 6, 2014.

Kishimoto also worked on several other projects during &quot;Naruto&quot;″s serialization. In 2010, Kishimoto produced a one-shot baseball manga, , as part of &quot;Jump&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Top of the Super Legend&quot; project, a series of six one-shot manga by famed &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; artists. In April 2012, it was announced that Kishimoto would publish a one-shot version of his long-postponed mafia manga, &quot;Mario&quot;, in &quot;Jump Square&quot;, based on the rough, 160-page manuscript he began working on before &quot;Naruto&quot; became serialized. Throughout 2013, several of Kishimoto&#x27;s one-shots saw their English-language debut in issues of the &quot; Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; digital magazine, including &quot;Mario&quot;, &quot;Bench&quot;, and the original &quot;Naruto&quot; pilot. In 2015, Kishimoto also illustrated the cover of violinist Chisako Takashima&#x27;s album &quot;Strings on Fire&quot;.

=== After &quot;Naruto&quot; ===
Following &quot;Naruto&quot;″s conclusion, Kishimoto became involved in the &quot;Start of a New Era Project&quot; commemorating both the manga&#x27;s conclusion and 15th anniversary. On the last page of the final chapter, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; announced that a spin-off miniseries, also authored by Kishimoto, would be released in 2015. The miniseries, &quot;&quot;, ran from April to July 2015, leading up to the premiere of &quot;&quot; on August 7, 2015, which he supervised and co-wrote with Ukyō Kodachi. He also illustrated several light novels set during the same time period as &quot;The Last&quot;. When asked by Boruto Uzumaki&#x27;s voice actress Yūko Sanpei to continue making &quot;Naruto&quot; films, Kishimoto stated that he was taking a break and could not physically do so.

In August 2015, Kishimoto announced that he already has finalized what he wants to do for his next manga series. A sci-fi manga, the series will feature a unique protagonist, with Kishimoto having already completed the character designs. He plans for the work to surpass &quot;Naruto&quot; in quality, and plans to release the series monthly via the digital magazine &quot;Shonen Jump Plus&quot; due to the taxing effort required for a weekly series. Kishimoto had not yet finalized when he plans to officially announce the series, as he wants to spend time with his family.

On December 19, 2015, it was announced that Kishimoto would supervise the monthly manga series beginning in Spring 2016. The new spinoff will be illustrated by Kishimoto&#x27;s chief assistant on &quot;Naruto&quot;, Mikio Ikemoto, and written by his writing partner for &quot;Boruto: Naruto the Movie&quot;, Ukyo Kodachi. It was preceded by a &quot;Naruto: The Path Lit by the Full Moon&quot; one-shot written and illustrated by Kishimoto. In the June 10, 2019 issue of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; it was announced that &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot; would transition to the magazine&#x27;s sister publication, &quot;V Jump&quot;, beginning with its June 20, 2019 issue.

In December 2017 at Jump Festa 2018 it was confirmed that Kishimoto was developing a new science fiction adventure series tentatively scheduled to debut in 2018. A year later at Jump Festa 2019 the series was formally announced as . Kishimoto will be handling the script and rough storyboards, while Akira Ōkubo, a former assistant on &quot;Naruto&quot; and brother of Atsushi Ōkubo, is responsible for illustrating the final manuscript. The series debuted in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on May 13, 2019, as the magazine&#x27;s first new series of Japan&#x27;s Reiwa period, following a 4-page preview chapter on April 27, 2019, marking the end of the Heisei period. The series however failed to find an audience and concluded a year later in the 17th issue of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on March 23, 2020.

In November 2020 it was announced that after 51 chapters and 13 volumes Kodachi would step down as writer of the &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot; manga, with Kishimoto assuming full writing duties and Ikemoto continuing as illustrator beginning with chapter 52 in the upcoming December issue of &quot;V Jump&quot; magazine, published on November 21, 2020.

== Personal life ==
Kishimoto is the twin brother of Seishi Kishimoto, the author of &quot;666 Satan&quot; and &quot;Blazer Drive&quot;. In 2003, Kishimoto married, but did not take a honeymoon with his wife until 2015 due to being busy with &quot;Naruto&quot;. In the making of &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot;, Kishimoto based the idea of Hinata Hyuga wanting to make a scarf for Naruto Uzumaki on how his wife had once done the same for him. The couple has one son.

== Influences and style==

While Kishimoto enjoyed reading manga as a child, he was inspired to write one after seeing a promotional image for the film &quot;Akira&quot;. This made him analyze the artwork of &quot;Akira&quot;″s original author, Katsuhiro Otomo, as well as Akira Toriyama, another artist he admired. Realizing both had their own style regarding the designs, Kishimoto decided to draw manga while crafting his own images. While attending art school, Kishimoto was also an avid reader of Hiroaki Samura&#x27;s &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot;, and extensively studied Samura&#x27;s page layouts, action sequences, and anatomical techniques.

When Kishimoto was originally creating the &quot;Naruto&quot; series, he looked to other &quot;shōnen&quot; manga for influences while attempting to make his characters as unique as possible. Kishimoto cites Akira Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series as one of his influences, noting that Goku, the protagonist, was a key factor when creating Naruto Uzumaki due to his energetic and mischievous personality. Kishimoto cited &quot;The Matrix&quot; as an inspiration for the redesigned character outfits. He has also cited Yoshihiro Togashi as one of his favorite manga authors, while the manga &quot;Sasuke&quot; by Sanpei Shirato inspired Kishimoto in the developing Sasuke Uchiha.

Kishimoto has also cited other influences such as Takeshi Kitano and Quentin Tarantino. He also mentioned Michael Bay&#x27;s technique &quot;of shooting a scene against the background light&quot; but found it difficult to make. Another technique inspired by Jackie Chan&#x27;s films he used in the &quot;Naruto&quot; manga is the &quot;double-action&quot;; in this action, a punch is shown in three different angles in order to give a big impact on the punch&#x27;s strength. This was first shown in Naruto Uzumaki&#x27;s battle against Haku. Kishimoto sometimes draws panels as intentionally confusing during fight scenes to add a sense of speed. On the other hand, Kishimoto commented that for the fights between Naruto and Sasuke, he added action from the top of the page to the bottom in order for them to be easier to follow.

During the series&#x27; publication, Kishimoto got married and had children. The changes to his personal life affected the story as he made Naruto Uzumaki meet his parents, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experiences as a father.

When drawing the characters, Kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch; drafting; inking; shading; and coloring. These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of &quot;tankōbon;&quot; the cover of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump;&quot; or other media. The toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; cover but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.

Masashi and his twin brother Seishi have been drawing manga together since early childhood; thus their styles are similar. As a result, each has been frequently accused of copying the other- not just artwork, but story elements as well. Seishi notes that the similarities are not intentional but are likely because they were influenced by many of the same things.

Kishimoto has admitted he made no plans in regards to the development of &quot;Naruto&quot;″s story developments. For example, when introducing Sasuke, the character says he wants to kill a person named &quot;Itachi&quot; who he had to redesign a number of times. By this time, Kishimoto only thought that Sasuke&#x27;s brother, Itachi, had done a wrong deed in the past but was not certain of what was exactly. By volume 16 of the series which featured Itachi&#x27;s actual introduction, Kishimoto decided Itachi was an agent working for Konohagakure to kill all members from the Uchiha clan except Sasuke. This is later revealed in volume 43 of the manga. Another one was the revelation that the late Minato Namikaze would be Naruto&#x27;s father. When Kishimoto had the idea that Minato would be Naruto&#x27;s father, he started adding hints of that to the reader such as giving the Hokage mountain from Konohagakure spiky hair similar to Naruto&#x27;s.

In the making of the film &quot;&quot; Kishimoto paid tribute to several movies, the most notable being the 1996 film &quot;The Rock&quot; and the 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. The tribute to &quot;The Rock&quot; was mostly done by using &quot;Kishōtenketsu&quot;, which is a common way of structuring stories in Japan. He also claimed he was a fan of Avi Arad, most notably his films based on the Spider-Man comic book character.

<doc id="1044849" wikidata="Q206435" url="?curid=1044849" title="Turning Torso">
<text>Turning Torso is a neo-futurist residential skyscraper built in Malmö, Sweden, in 2005. It was the tallest building in the Nordic region until September 2022, when it was surpassed by Karlatornet in Gothenburg. Located on the Swedish side of the Öresund strait, it was built and is owned by Swedish cooperative housing association HSB. It is regarded as the second twisted skyscraper in the world to receive the title after Telekom Tower in Malaysia.

It was designed by Spanish architect, structural engineer, sculptor and painter Santiago Calatrava and officially opened on 27 August 2005. It reaches a height of with 54 stories and 147 apartments. Turning Torso won the 2005 Gold Emporis Skyscraper Award; and in 2015, the 10 Year Award from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.

==Design==
Turning Torso is based on &quot;Twisting Torso&quot;, a white marble sculpture by Calatrava that was based on the form of a twisting human being.

In 1999, HSB Malmö&#x27;s former managing director, Johnny Örbäck, saw the sculpture in a brochure presenting Calatrava in connection with his contribution to the architectural competition for the Öresund Bridge. It was on this occasion that Örbäck was inspired to build HSB Turning Torso. Shortly afterwards he travelled to Zurich to meet Calatrava, and ask him to design a residential building based on the idea of a structure of twisting cubes.
It is a solid, immobile building constructed in nine segments of five-story pentagons that twist relative to each other as it rises; the topmost segment is twisted 90 degrees clockwise from the ground floor. Each floor consists of an irregular pentagonal shape rotating around the vertical core, which is supported by an exterior steel framework. The two bottom segments are intended as office space. Segments three to nine house 147 rental apartments.

==Construction==
Construction started in February 2001. One reason for building Turning Torso was to re-establish a recognisable skyline for Malmö since the removal in 2002 of the Kockums Crane, which was located less than from Turning Torso. The local politicians deemed it important for the inhabitants to have a new symbol for Malmö in lieu of the crane that had been used for shipbuilding and somewhat symbolised the city&#x27;s blue collar roots.

The construction of part of this building was featured on Discovery Channel &quot;Extreme Engineering&quot; TV programme which showed how a floor of the building was constructed.

Prior to the construction of Turning Torso, the Kronprinsen had been the city&#x27;s tallest building.

The apartments were initially supposed to be sold, but insufficient interest resulted in the apartments being let. The owner has several times unsuccessfully tried to sell the building. Construction costs for the building were over twice the initial budgeted costs.

==Events==
On 18 August 2006, Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner parachuted onto the Turning Torso, and then jumped off it.

Floor 49 is home to the public observation deck while floors 50–52 contain a private club, meeting events, the reception, and the venue restaurant.

Floor 53 and 54 in the Turning Torso are conference floors booked and managed by Sky High Meetings. Since 2009 the owner, HSB, has decided to let the public visit these floors but only on special scheduled days, and pre-booking is required.

<text>The Royal Corps of Army Music (RCAM, widely known by its former acronym CAMUS) is a Corps of the British Army dedicated to the provision and promotion of military music.

==History==
The formation of the Corps of Army Music was triggered by a defence review known as &quot;Options for Change&quot; in 1991 and followed a 1993 announcement by the Chief of the General Staff that the number of regular army bands was to be reduced from 69 to 30. The period saw the number of personnel fall from 2,000 to 1,100, with Lieutenant Colonel Roger Tomlinson of the Royal Military School of Music describing it as &quot;a gloomy time for those of us in the military music business&quot;. The Queen signed a warrant on 13 August 1994 to allow the formation of the Corps of Army Music. All regular army officers who were Directors of Music in the various corps and regiments and all regular army musicians would transfer to the Corps of Army Music - now the newest and most junior corps in the army - on 1 September 1994.

The home of the corps was established at Kneller Hall in Twickenham, a site that already encompassed the Royal Military School of Music. The school was founded by the Duke of Cambridge, soon after his appointment as Commander in Chief in 1857, when the first class of military musicians was formed, a &#x27;Class of Music&#x27;. The establishment was retitled as The Royal Military School of Music by Queen Victoria in 1887.

The Future Army Structure review of 2004 saw the bands of the Regular Army reduced from 30 to 23. In 2019 the number of Regular Army bands was further reduced to 14.

===2019 restructuring===
In 2019, the Corps of Army Music was restructured with a number of bands being co-located and re-named. In a process of &#x27;Military Music Optimization&#x27;, the regular Army band laydown was adjusted to enable several smaller bands to train and perform as larger bands for more significant Army events: &#x27;Co-locating 11 of the smaller bands in three major garrisons and Sandhurst has increased the flexibility of CAMUS to perform at a huge breadth of events without compromising any of the traditional bands that have been performing for many years&#x27;.

===Renaming and move===
During a visit to Kneller Hall in December 2020, the Earl and Countess of Wessex announced the Corps of Army Music would be renamed the Royal Corps of Army Music from January 2021. This change was formally marked with a new title presentation in January 2021 with the Countess in attendance.

In September 2021, the Corps Headquarters moved to Gibraltar Barracks in Minley, whilst the Royal Military School of Music moved to HMS &quot;Nelson&quot; alongside the Royal Marines School of Music.

== Bands of the Corps ==
The 14 constituent bands of the Corps are as follows:

*Band of the Household Cavalry, at Combermere Barracks, Windsor
*Band of the Grenadier Guards, at Wellington Barracks, Westminster, London
*Band of the Coldstream Guards, at Wellington Barracks, Westminster, London
*Band of the Scots Guards, at Wellington Barracks, Westminster, London
*Band of the Irish Guards, at Wellington Barracks, Westminster, London
*Band of the Welsh Guards, at Wellington Barracks, Westminster, London
*Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, at Dreghorn Barracks, Edinburgh
*Band and Bugles of The Rifles, at Worthy Down Barracks, Winchester
*Countess of Wessex&#x27;s String Orchestra, at Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich Station, London
*British Army Band Catterick, at Piave Lines, Catterick Garrison 
**Band of the Royal Armoured Corps
**Band of the King&#x27;s Division
**Band of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers
*British Army Band Tidworth, at Lucknow Barracks, Tidworth Camp
**Royal Artillery Band
**Band of the Royal Engineers
**Band of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps
*British Army Band Sandhurst, at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Camberley
**Band of the Royal Corps of Signals
**Band of the Royal Logistic Corps
*British Army Band Colchester, at Merville Barracks, Colchester Garrison
**Band of the Queen&#x27;s Division (originally disbanded in 2018)
**Band of the Parachute Regiment
**Band of the Army Air Corps
*Band of the Prince of Wales, at Brecon

In addition to providing personnel for all the above bands, the Corps of Army Music provides &#x27;technical support&#x27; for the Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas, based at Shorncliffe Camp, Folkestone, which is separately constituted. Other bands may be formed from time to time by drawing together personnel from different ensembles; for example the British Army Brass Band (founded by two Army Bandmasters in 2007) is &#x27;made up of players across all bands of the Army, Regulars and Reservists&#x27;.

==Army Reserve bands==

===Army Volunteer bands===
All Army Volunteer Bands serve in a voluntary capacity and have no army reserves commitment but still perform for various mess functions, church parades and civic functions, supporting their regiment and the wider regimental family. The uniform worn is that of the regular regiment which is headquartered in the Tower of London.

<doc id="1044856" wikidata="Q1763371" url="?curid=1044856" title="Shotgun cartridge">
<text>A shotgun cartridge, shotshell, or shell is a type of rimmed, cylindrical (straight-walled) ammunition used specifically in shotguns. It is typically loaded with numerous small, spherical sub-projectiles called [[shot (pellet)|shot]]. Shotguns typically use a smoothbore barrel with a tapered constriction at the muzzle to regulate the extent of scattering.

Some cartridges contain a single solid projectile known as a [[shotgun slug|slug]] (sometimes fired through a rifled slug barrel). The casing usually consists of a paper or plastic tube with a metallic base containing the primer. The shot charge is typically contained by wadding inside the case. The caliber of the cartridge is known as its gauge.

The projectiles are traditionally made of lead, but other metals like steel, tungsten and bismuth are also used due to restrictions on lead, or for performance reasons such as achieving higher shot velocities by reducing the mass of the shot charge. Other unusual projectiles such as saboted flechettes, rubber balls, rock salt and magnesium shards also exist. Cartridges can also be made with specialty non-lethal projectiles such as rubber and bean bag rounds.

Shotguns have an effective range of about with buckshot, with birdshot, with slugs, and well over with saboted slugs in rifled barrels.

Most shotgun cartridges are designed to be fired from a smoothbore barrel, as &quot;shot&quot; would be spread too wide by rifling. A rifled barrel will increase the accuracy of sabot slugs, but makes it unsuitable for firing shot, as it imparts a spin to the shot cup, causing the shot cluster to disperse. A rifled slug uses rifling on the slug itself so it can be used in a smoothbore shotgun.

==History==
Early shotgun cartridges used brass cases, not unlike pistol and rifle cartridge cases of the same era. These brass shotgun hulls or cases resembled large rifle cartridges, in terms of both the head and primer portions of the cartridge, as well as in their dimensions. Card wads, made of felt, leather, and cork, as well as paperboard, were all used at various times. Waterglass (sodium silicate) was commonly used to cement the top overshot wad into these brass casings. No roll crimp or fold crimp was used on these early brass cases, though roll crimps were eventually used by some manufacturers to hold the overshot wad in place securely. The primers on these early shotgun cartridges were identical to pistol primers of the same diameter.

Starting in the late 1870s, paper hulls began replacing brass hulls. Paper hulls remained popular for nearly a century, until the early 1960s. These shotgun cartridges using paper hulls were nearly always roll crimped, although fold crimping also eventually became popular. The primers on these paper hull cartridges also changed from the pistol primers used on the early brass shotgun shells to a primer containing both the priming charge and an anvil, making the shotgun primer taller. Card wads, made of felt and cork, as well as paperboard, were all used at various times, gradually giving way to plastic over powder wads, with card wads, and, eventually, to all plastic wads. Starting from the early 1960s to the late 1970s, plastic hulls started replacing paper hulls for the majority of cartridges and by the early 1980s, plastic hulls had become universally adopted.

== Typical construction ==
Modern shotgun cartridges typically consist of a plastic hull, with the base covered in a thin brass or plated steel covering. Paper cartridges used to be common and are still made, as are solid brass shells. Some companies have produced what appear to be all-plastic shells, although in these there is a small metal ring cast into the rim of the cartridge to provide strength. More powerful loads may use &quot;high brass&quot; shells, with the brass extended up further along the sides of the cartridge, while light loads will use &quot;low brass&quot; shells. The brass does not provide a significant amount of strength, but the difference in appearance gives shooters a way to quickly differentiate between high and low powered ammunition.

The base of the cartridge is fairly thick to hold the large primer, which is longer than primers used for rifle and pistol ammunition. Modern smokeless powders are far more efficient than the original black powder, so little space is actually taken by propellant; shotguns use small quantities of double base powders, equivalent to quick-burning pistol powders, with up to 50% nitroglycerin. After the powder comes the wadding or wad. The primary purpose of a wad is to prevent the shot and powder from mixing, and to provide a seal that stops gas from blowing through the shot rather than propelling it. The wad design may also encompass a shock absorber and a cup that holds the shot together until it is out of the barrel.

A modern wad consists of three parts, the powder wad, the cushion, and the shot cup, which may be separate pieces or be one part. The powder wad acts as the gas seal (known as obturation), and is placed firmly over the powder; it may be a paper or plastic part. The cushion comes next, and it is designed to compress under pressure, to act as a shock absorber and minimize the deformation of the shot; it also serves to take up as much space as is needed between the powder wad and the shot. Cushions are almost universally made of plastic with crumple zones, although for game shooting in areas grazed by farm stock or wildlife biodegradable fiber wads are often preferred. The shot cup is the last part of the cartridge, and it serves to hold the shot together as it moves down the barrel. Shot cups have slits on the sides so that they peel open after leaving the barrel, allowing the shot to continue on in flight undisturbed. Shot cups, where used, are also almost universally plastic. The shot fills the shot cup (which must be of the correct length to hold the desired quantity of shot), and the cartridges is then crimped, or rolled closed.

The only known shotgun cartridge using rebated rims is the 12 Gauge RAS12, specially made for the RAS-12 semi automatic shotgun.

==Sizes==
===Standard===
Shotgun cartridges are generally measured by &quot;gauge&quot;, which is the weight, in fractions of a pound, of a pure lead round ball that is the same diameter as the internal diameter of the barrel. In Britain and some other locations outside the United States, the term &quot;bore&quot; is used with the same meaning. This contrasts with rifles and handguns, which are almost always measured in &quot;caliber&quot;, a measurement of the internal diameter of the barrel measured in millimeters or inches and, consequently, is approximately equal to the diameter of the projectile that is fired.

For example, a shotgun is called &quot;12-gauge&quot; because a lead sphere that just fits the inside diameter of the barrel weighs . This measurement comes from the time when early cannons were designated in a similar manner—a &quot;12 pounder&quot; would be a cannon that fired a cannonball; inversely, an individual &quot;12-gauge&quot; shot would in fact be a pounder. Thus, a 10-gauge shotgun has a larger-diameter barrel than a 12-gauge shotgun, which has a larger-diameter barrel than a 20-gauge shotgun, and so forth.
The most popular shotgun gauge by far is 12-gauge. The bigger 10-gauge, once popular for hunting larger birds such as goose and turkey, is on the decline with the advent of the longer, &quot;magnum&quot; 12-gauge cartridges, which offer similar performance. The mid-size 20-gauge is also a very popular chambering for smaller-framed shooters who favor its reduced recoil, those hunting smaller game, and experienced trap and skeet shooters who like the additional challenge of hitting their targets with a smaller shot charge. Other less-common, but commercially available gauges are 16 and 28. Several other gauges may be encountered, but are considered obsolete. The 4, 8, 24, and 32 gauge guns are collector items. There are also some shotguns measured by diameter, rather than gauge. These are the .410 (10.4mm), .380 (9mm), and .22 (5.5mm); these are correctly called &quot;.410 bore&quot;, not &quot;.410-gauge&quot;.

The .410 bore is the smallest shotgun size which is widely available commercially in the United States. For size comparison purposes, the .410, when measured by gauge, would be around 67- or 68-gauge (it is 67.62-gauge), The .410 is often mistakenly assigned 36-gauge. The 36 gauge had a 0.506&quot; bore. Reloading components are still available.

===Other calibers===
 

Snake shot (AKA: bird shot, rat shot, and dust shot) refers to handgun and rifle cartridges loaded with small lead shot. Snake shot is generally used for shooting at snakes, rodents, birds, and other pests at very close range. The most common snake shot cartridges are .22 Long Rifle, .22 Magnum, .38 Special, 9×19mm Luger, .40 Smith &amp; Wesson, .44 Special, .45 ACP, and .45 Colt.

Commonly used by hikers, backpackers and campers, snake shot is ideally suited for use in revolvers and derringers, chambered for .38 Special and .357 Magnum. Snake shot may not cycle properly in semi-automatic pistols. Rifles specifically made to fire .22 caliber snake shot are also commonly used by farmers for pest control inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly injure livestock with a ricochet. They are also used for airport and warehouse pest control. 

Shot shells have also been historically issued to soldiers, to be used in standard issue rifles. The .45-70 &quot;Forager&quot; round, which contained a thin wooden bullet filled with birdshot, was intended for hunting small game to supplement the soldiers&#x27; rations. This round in effect made the .45-70 rifle into a small gauge shotgun, capable of killing rabbits, ducks, and other small game.

During World War II, the United States military developed the .45 ACP M12 and M15 shot cartridges. They were issued to pilots, to be used as foraging ammunition in the event that they were shot down. While they were best used in the M1917 revolvers, the M15 cartridge would actually cycle the semi-automatic M1911 pistols action.

===Garden guns===
Garden guns are smooth-bore firearms specifically made to fire .22 caliber snake shot, and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for pest control. Garden guns are short-range weapons that can do little harm past 15 to 20 yards, and they are quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to standard ammunition. These guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly injure livestock with a ricochet. They are also used for pest control at airports, warehouses, stockyards, etc.

==Shotgun gauge diameter formula==

The standard definition of shotgun gauge assumes that a pure lead ball is used. The following formulas relate the bore diameter &quot;dn&quot; (in inches) to the gauge &quot;n&quot;:

:formula_1

:formula_2

For example, the common bore diameter &quot;dn&quot; = 0.410 inches (.410 bore) is effectively gauge &quot;n&quot; = 67.6 .

==Lead free==
By 1957, the ammo industry had the capability of producing a nontoxic shot, made out of either iron or steel. In 1976, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service took the first steps toward phasing out lead shot by designating steel-shot-only hunting zones for waterfowl. In the 1970s, lead-free ammunition loaded with steel, bismuth, or tungsten composite pellets instead of more traditional lead-based shot was introduced and required for Migratory Bird Hunting (Ducks &amp; Geese). Lead shot in waterfowl hunting was banned throughout the United States in 1991. Due to environmental regulations, lead-loaded ammunition must be used carefully by hunters in Europe. For instance, in France, it cannot be fired in the vicinity of a pond. In fact, the laws are so complex that some hunters in Europe prefer not to risk getting into problems for firing lead pellets in the wrong places, so they opt for composite pellets in all situations. The use of lead shot is banned in Canada and the United States when hunting migratory game birds, like ducks and geese, forcing the use of non-toxic shot in these countries for waterfowl hunting (lead shot can still legally be used in the United States for hunting game other than waterfowl). This means that manufacturers need to market new types of lead-free shotgun ammunition loaded with alternative pellets to meet environmental restrictions on the use of lead, as well as lead-based and cheaper shotshell ammunition, to remain competitive worldwide.

The C.I.P. enforces approval of all ammunition a manufacturer or importer intends to sell in any of the (mainly European) C.I.P. member states. The ammunition manufacturing plants are obliged to test their products during production against the C.I.P. pressure specifications. A compliance report must be issued for each production lot and archived for later verification if needed.

Besides pressure testing, cartridges containing steel pellets require an additional Vickers hardness test. The steel pellets used must have a hardness under 100 HV1, but, even so, steel is known to wear the barrel excessively over time if the steel pellet velocities become too high, leading to potentially harmful situations for the user. As a result, the measurement of pellet velocity is also an additional obligation for cartridges in 12-, 16-, and 20-gauges in both standard and high performance versions sold in Europe. The velocity of pellets must be below , and respectively for the standard versions. Another disadvantage of steel pellets is their tendency to ricochet unpredictably after striking any hard surface. This poses a major hazard at indoor ranges or whenever metal targets or hard backstops (e.g. concrete wall vs. a dirt berm) are used. For this reason, steel shot is explicitly banned at most indoor shooting ranges. Any shooters who are considering to buy ammo loaded with steel for anything other than hunting purposes should first find out if using it will not cause undue hazard to themselves and others.

However, data supporting the danger of firing high velocity cartridges loaded with steel shot causing barrel wear has not been published and the US equivalent of CIP, SAAMI, does not have any such restrictive limitations on the velocity of commercial steel shot cartridges sold in the United States. Similarly, shotgun manufacturers selling shotguns in the United States select their own appropriate standards for setting steel hardness for shotgun barrels and for velocities of steel shot ammunition.

Some indoor shooting ranges prohibit the use of steel shot over concern of it causing a spark when hitting an object down range and causing a fire.

==Shot sizes==

Cartridges are loaded with different sizes of shot depending on the target. For skeet shooting, a small shot such as a No. 8 or No. 9 would be used, because range is short and a high density pattern is desirable. Trap shooting requires longer shots, and so a larger shot, usually # is used. For hunting game, the range and penetration needed to assure a clean kill is considered. Shot loses its velocity very quickly due to its low sectional density and ballistic coefficient (see external ballistics). Small shot, like that used for skeet and trap, will have lost all appreciable energy by around , which is why trap and skeet ranges can be located in relatively close proximity to inhabited areas with negligible risk of injury to those outside the range.

===Birdshot===

Birdshots are designed to be used for waterfowl and upland hunting, where the game is agile small/medium-sized birds. Their sizes are numbered similarly to the shotgun gauges—the smaller the number, the larger the shot (except in the obsolete Swedish system, where it is reversed). Generally birdshot is just called &quot;shot&quot;, such as &quot;number 9 shot&quot; or &quot;BB shot&quot;. 

To make matters more complex, there are small differences in the size of American, Standard (European), Belgian, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish, British, and Australian shot. That is because some systems go by diameter in inches (American), some go by diameter in millimeters (European), and the British system goes by the number of lead shot per ounce. Australia has a hybrid system due to its market being flooded with a mixture of British, American, and European cartridges.

For American shot, a useful method for remembering the diameter of numbered shot in inches is simply to subtract the shot size from 17. The resulting answer is the diameter of the shot in hundredths of an inch. For example, #2 shot gives 17−2 = 15, meaning that the diameter of #2 shot is or . B shot is , and sizes go up in increments for BB and BBB sizes. 

In metric measurement, #5 shot is 3 mm; each number up or down represents a 0.25 mm change in diameter, so e.g. #7 shot is 2.5 mm.

Number 11 and number 12 lead shot also exists. Shot of these sizes is used in specialized cartridges designed to be fired at close range (less than four yards) for killing snakes, rats and similar-sized animals. Such cartridges are typically intended to be fired from handguns, particularly revolvers. This type of ammunition is produced by Federal and CCI, among others.

====Birdshot selection====
For hunting, shot size must be chosen not only for the range, but also for the game. The shot must reach the target with enough energy to penetrate to a depth sufficient to kill the game. Lead shot is still the best ballistic performer, but environmental restrictions on the use of lead, especially with waterfowl, require steel, bismuth, or tungsten composites. Steel, being significantly less dense than lead, requires larger shot sizes, but is a good choice when lead is not legal and cost is a consideration. It is argued that steel shot cannot safely be used in some older shotguns without causing damage to either the bore or to the choke due to the hardness of steel shot. However, the increased pressure in most steel cartridges is a far greater problem, causing more strain to the breech of the gun. Since tungsten is very hard, it must also be used with care in older guns. Tungsten shot is often alloyed with nickel and iron, softening the base metal. That alloy is approximately 1/3 denser than lead, but far more expensive. Bismuth shot falls between steel and tungsten shot in both density and cost. The rule of thumb in converting appropriate steel shot is to go up by two numbers when switching from lead. However, there are different views on dense patterns versus higher pellet energies.

Larger sizes of shot, big enough that they must be carefully packed into the cartridge rather than simply dumped or poured in, are called &quot;buckshot&quot; or just &quot;buck&quot;. Buckshot is used for hunting medium to large game, as a tactical round for law enforcement and military personnel, and for personal self-defense. Buckshot size is most commonly designated by a series of numbers and letters, with smaller numbers indicating larger shot. Sizes larger than &quot;0&quot; are designated by multiple zeros. &quot;00&quot; (usually pronounced &quot;double-aught&quot; in North American English) is the most commonly sold size.

The British system for designating buckshot size is based on the amount of shot per ounce. The sizes are LG (large grape – from grapeshot derived from musket shooting), MG (medium grape), and SG (small grape). For smaller game, SSG shot is half the weight of SG, SSSG shot is half the weight of SSG, SSSSG shot is half the weight of SSSG, and so on. The Australian system is similar, except that it has 00-SG, a small-game cartridge filled with 00 buckshot.

Loads of 12-gauge 00 buckshot are commonly available in cartridges holding from 8 (eight) to 18 (eighteen) pellets in standard lengths ( inches, 3 inches, and ). Reduced-recoil 00 buckshot is often used in tactical and self-defense rounds, minimizing shooter stress and improving the speed of follow-up shots.

===Specialist loads===
Other rounds include:
*Ferret rounds: rounds designed to penetrate a thin barrier (e.g. a car door) and release a gas payload.
*Bolo rounds: two large lead balls attached by a wire.
*Piranha rounds: loaded with sharp tacks.
*Dragon&#x27;s breath rounds: loaded with incendiary chemicals that create a /flame when discharged, and can ignite a flammable target at close range.

==Spread and patterning==
Most modern sporting shotguns have interchangeable choke tubes to let the shooter change the spread of shot that comes out of the gun. In some cases, it is not practical to do this; the gun might have a fixed choke, or a shooter firing at receding targets may want to fire a wide pattern immediately followed by a narrower pattern out of a single barrelled shotgun. The spread of the shot can also be altered by changing the characteristics of the cartridge.

===Narrower patterns===
A buffering material, such as granulated plastic, sawdust, or similar material can be mixed with the shot to fill the spaces between the individual pellets. When fired, the buffering material compresses and supports the shot, reducing the deformation the shot pellets experience under the extreme acceleration. Antimony-lead alloys, copper plated lead shot, steel, bismuth, and tungsten composite shot all have a hardness greater than that of plain lead shot, and will deform less. Reducing the deformation will result in tighter patterns, as the spherical pellets tend to fly straighter. One improvised method for achieving the same effect involves pouring molten wax or tar into the mass of shot. Another is a partial ring cut around the case intended to ensure the shot comes out tightly bunched along with the portion of the case forward of the cut, creating a &#x27;cut-shell&#x27;. This can be dangerous, as it is thought to cause higher chamber pressures—especially if part of the cartridge remains behind in the barrel and is not cleared before another shot is fired.

===Wider patterns===
Shooting the softest possible shot will result in more shot deformation and a wider pattern. This is often the case with cheap ammunition, as the lead used will have minimal alloying elements such as antimony and be very soft. Spreader wads are wads that have a small plastic or paper insert in the middle of the shot cup, usually a cylinder or &quot;X&quot; cross-section. When the shot exits the barrel, the insert helps to push the shot out from the center, opening up the pattern. These often result in inconsistent performance, though modern designs are doing much better than the traditional improvised solutions. Intentionally deformed shot (hammered into ellipsoidal shape) or cubical shot will also result in a wider pattern, much wider than spherical shot, with more consistency than spreader wads. Spreader wads and non-spherical shot are disallowed in some competitions. Hunting loads that use either spreaders or non-spherical shot are usually called &quot;brush loads&quot;, and are favored for hunting in areas where dense cover keeps shot distances very short.

===Spread===
Most shotgun cartridges contain multiple pellets to increase the likelihood of a target being hit. A shotgun&#x27;s shot spread refers to the two-dimensional pattern that these projectiles (or shot) leave behind on a target. Another less important dimension of spread concerns the length of the in-flight shot string from the leading pellet to the trailing one. The use of multiple pellets is especially useful for hunting small game such as birds, rabbits, and other animals that fly or move quickly and can unpredictably change their direction of travel. However, some cartridges only contain one metal shot, known as a &quot;slug&quot;, for hunting large game such as deer.

As the shot leaves the barrel upon firing, the three-dimensional shot string is close together. When the shot moves further away, the individual pellets increasingly spread out and disperse. This leads to the effective range of a shotgun, when firing a multitude of shot, being limited to approximately . To control this effect, shooters may use a constriction within the barrel of a shotgun called a &quot;choke&quot;. The choke, whether fixed or selectable within a barrel, effectively reduces the diameter of the end of the barrel, forcing the shot even closer together as it leaves the barrel, thereby increasing the effective range. The tighter the choke, the narrower the end of the barrel. Consequently, the effective range of a shotgun is increased with a tighter choke, as the shot column is held tighter over longer ranges. Hunters or target shooters can install several types of chokes, on guns having selectable chokes, depending on the range at which their intended targets will be located. For fixed-choke shotguns, different shotguns or barrels are often selected for the intended hunting application at hand. From tightest to loosest, the various choke sizes are: full choke, improved modified, modified, improved cylinder, skeet, and cylinder bore.

A hunter who intends to hunt an animal such as rabbit or grouse knows that the animal will be encountered at a close range—usually within —and will be moving very quickly. An ideal choke would be a cylinder bore (the loosest) as the hunter wants the shot to spread out as quickly as possible. If this hunter were using a full choke (the tightest) at , the shot would be very close together and cause an unnecessarily large amount of damage to the rabbit, or, alternatively, a complete miss of the rabbit. This would waste virtually all of the meat for a hit, as the little amount of meat remaining would be overly-laden with shot and rendered inedible. By using a cylinder bore, this hunter would maximize the likelihood of a kill, and maximize the amount of edible meat. Contrarily, a hunter who intends to hunt geese knows that a goose will likely be approximately away, so that hunter would want to delay the spread of the shot as much as possible by using a full choke. By using a full choke for targets that are further away, the shooter again maximizes the likelihood of a kill, and maximizes the amount of edible meat. This also maximizes the chances of a swift and humane kill as the target would be hit with enough shot to kill quickly instead of only wounding the animal.

For older shotguns having only one fixed choke, intended primarily for equally likely use against rabbits, squirrels, quail, doves, and pheasant, an often-chosen choke is the improved cylinder, in a barrel, making the shotgun suitable for use as a general all-round hunting shotgun, without having excess weight. Shotguns having fixed chokes intended for geese, in contrast, are often found with full choke barrels, in longer lengths, and are much heavier, being meant for fixed use within a blind against distant targets. Defensive shotguns with fixed chokes generally have a cylinder bore choke. Likewise, shotguns intended primarily for use with slugs invariably also are found with a choke that is a cylinder bore.

==Dram equivalence==

&quot;Dram&quot; equivalence is sometimes still used as a measure of the powder charge power in a cartridge. Today, it is an anachronistic equivalence that represents the equivalent power of a cartridge containing this equivalent amount of black-powder measured in drams avoirdupois. A dram in the avoirdupois system is the mass of  pound or  ounce or 27.3 grains. The reasoning behind this archaic equivalence is that when smokeless powder first came out, some method of establishing an equivalence with common loads was needed in order to sell a box of cartridges. For example, a cartridge containing a 3 or -dram load of black powder was a common hunting field load, and a heavy full-power load would have contained about a 4 to -dram load, whereas a cartridge containing only a 2-dram load of black powder was a common target practice load. A hunter looking for a field or full-power load familiar with black-powder shotgun loads would have known exactly what the equivalence of the cartridges would have been in the newly introduced smokeless powder. Today, however, this represents a poorly understood equivalence of the powder charge power in a cartridge. To further complicate matters, &quot;dram&quot; equivalence was defined only for 12-gauge cartridges and only for lead shot, although it has often been used for describing other gauges of shells and even steel shot loads. Furthermore, &quot;dram&quot; equivalence came around only about 15 years after smokeless powder had been introduced, long after the need for an equivalence had started to fade, and actual black-powder-loaded shotshells had largely vanished. In practice, &quot;dram&quot; equivalence today most commonly equates just to a velocity rating equivalence in feet per second, while assuming lead shot.

A secondary impact of this equivalence was that common cartridges needed to stay the same size, physically, e.g., or -inch shells, in order to be used in pre-existing shotguns when smokeless powder started being in the place of black-powder. As smokeless powder did not have to be loaded in the same volume as black-powder to achieve the same power, being more powerful, the volumes of wads had to increase, to fill the cartridge enough to permit proper crimps still to be made. Initially, this meant that increased numbers of over-powder card wads had to be stacked to achieve the same stack-up length. Eventually, this also led to the introduction of one-piece plastic wads in the late 1950s through the early 1960s, to add additional wad volumes, in order to maintain the same overall cartridge length.

Dram equivalence has no bearing on the reloading of cartridges with smokeless powder; loading a cartridge with an equivalent dram weight of smokeless powder would cause a shotgun to explode. It only has an equivalence in reloading with black powder.

<text>Breath spray is a product sprayed into the mouth for the purpose of temporarily eliminating or at least covering up bad breath. The masking effect is short-term and reported to last for 4-6 hours. Breath sprays are occasionally advertised as being for smokers or those who dip tobacco, and occasionally to cover up the smell of cigarette/cigar smoking. Common flavours include cinnamon, spearmint and peppermint, as well as company-specific flavors, such as &quot;&quot;Ice Mint&quot;, &quot;Cool Mint&quot; or &quot;Supermint&quot;&quot;.

Some breath sprays are purported by their manufacturers to have antibacterial or anti-plaque properties, containing ingredients, such as chlorine dioxide, chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, essential oils, hinokitiol, and zinc ions. As alcohol is frequently a prime ingredient of breath sprays, some brands advertise their products as alcohol-free. Alcohol is thought to be responsible for causing dry mouth when alcohol-containing breath sprays or mouthwashes are used too frequently. Some brands also advocate for using sugar-free formulations considering the disadvantageous consequences of sugar of causing caries.

<text>Chester Cheetah is a fictional character and the official mascot for Frito-Lay&#x27;s Cheetos brand snacks as well as Chester&#x27;s Snacks which consists of flavored fries, popcorn and puffcorn.

==History==
===1986–2003: Traditional animation===
Cheetos&#x27; original mascot was the Cheetos Mouse, who debuted in 1971 and disappeared around 1979. In 1986 Chester Cheetah was created by Brad Morgan, who art directed the commercials and designed the character, and Stephen Kane who wrote the original scripts for television commercials. The original 24-frame animation was done by Richard Williams. After Chester&#x27;s introduction, the sly, smooth voiced cheetah began starring in more commercials and eventually became Cheetos&#x27; official mascot. He used the slogans &quot;It&#x27;s not easy being cheesy&quot; and &quot;The cheese that goes crunch!&quot; from 1986 to 1997, until it became &quot;Dangerously cheesy!&quot; from 1997 onward.

From the mid-1980s to early 2000s, television adverts often featured Chester&#x27;s desperate attempts to eat other people&#x27;s Cheetos. The self-described &quot;hip kitty&quot; would often speak in rhyme and sneak up on an unsuspecting stranger at a beach or public park. The result would always involve cartoon violence in the vein of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, such as Chester riding a motorcycle off a bridge, getting thrown to the top of a coliseum, or plunging miles through the air to unwittingly grab a hang-gliding bodacious babe, only to cast her aside in favor of Cheetos. These spots were first directed by Keith Van Allen and later by &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; creator David Feiss.

In 1992, Chester&#x27;s own television program called &quot;Yo! It&#x27;s the Chester Cheetah Show!&quot; was under development for the Fox Kids Saturday morning fall lineup. However, an ethics debate erupted over Chester&#x27;s status as an advertising character, and likely due to the protests of Action for Children&#x27;s Television, the show was prevented from airing. Their petition marked the first time that the organization protested something before it actually became a program. In 2019 a petition appeared on change.org for someone to make the series happen sometime for Nickelodeon.

Chester&#x27;s character underwent slight revamping in 1997. With the introduction of the &quot;Dangerously cheesy!&quot; slogan and Pete Stacker replacing Joel Murray as his voice actor. Chester began appearing in live-action/animated hybrid advertisements where he entered the real world. During this time, the ads began portraying him in a less antagonistic manner; he went from being bumbling to suave and cool, and he actually managed to eat Cheetos unlike in the older commercials.

===2003–2009: Jump to CGI===
In the United States in 2003, Chester was rendered as a computer generated character, but he continued to appear in his old animation style in other countries.

In one specific 2006 commercial series, Chester emerged victorious over competitor Chef Pierre in a baking competition to develop Baked Cheetos. This resulted in an advertising campaign called Chester Goes Undercover, wherein Pierre steals the Baked Cheetos formula while wearing a shadow, and Chester pursues him by tracking down hints that point him in the direction of Pierre&#x27;s goons, Twisty McGee, Flamin&#x27; Hot Fiona, and The Cruncher. When Chester confronted Chef Pierre, he gave the order for his operatives to show up, capture Pierre and his henchmen, and retrieve the stolen formula. There was an interactive web campaign associated with these commercials.

===2008–present: OrangeUnderground redesign===
By 2008, Cheetos took aim at an adult demographic with a series of ads featuring the mascot in promotion of OrangeUnderground.com. In this incarnation, Chester (originally a puppet) is computer generated, but now with photorealistic textures/detail; he speaks with a British-sounding Mid-Atlantic accent and encourages people to use their Cheetos in acts of revenge or to solve problems (e.g. plug the nostrils of a snoring man or dirty the cubicle of a ), sometimes referring to himself as &quot;Papa Chester&quot;. In this incarnation, Chester is voiced by Adam Leadbeater.

==Merchandise==
Chester starred in two video games produced by Kaneko for the Sega Genesis and Super NES: &quot;Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild Quest&quot; in 1993.

Chester Cheetah makes a cameo appearance in Archie Comics&#x27; &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series.

The Angry Birds Cheetos and Angry Birds Cheetos 2 Facebook games were released in 2012 and 2013. With the exception of the addition of a new Cheetos bag power up in both games, the games are quite identical to past Angry Birds versions. A normal Cheetos bag that behaves like the Blue bird and splits into many Cheetos is added in the first game, and a flaming hot Cheetos bag that behaves like the Bomb bird and explodes on impact is added in the sequel.

A promotional plush doll was produced, featuring dark sunglasses and lace-up shoes. It was 18&quot; tall. A 10&quot; doll is still available today.

In 2023, the company Jada Toys released an action figure of Chester Cheetah.

== Video games ==

=== &quot;Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool&quot; ===
&quot;Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool&quot; is a 1992 video game that starred Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah, only released in North America.

The game is composed of simple side-scrolling platform levels. On each level there is a hidden &quot;scooter&quot; part. In game, Chester can dash and stun enemies by jumping on their heads.

The instruction manual contains a popular Engrish recognized by many gamers: &quot;As is Chester Cheetah way, is one-person play.&quot; The Engrish spawned due to bad translations and an attempt to rhyme in anapestic tetrameter like Dr. Seuss. No actual mention of the Cheetos snack food is made in the game, but Chester&#x27;s health points are represented as Cheetos Paws.

&quot;Time Extension&quot; listed &quot;Too Cool to Fool&quot; as one of the worst SNES games.

=== &quot;Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild Quest&quot; ===

Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild Quest is a 1993 video game by Kaneko for the Super NES and Sega Genesis. The game stars Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah and is the sequel to &quot;Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool&quot;.

The player dies in one hit unless they have a cheese puff on hand. Collecting 100 paws per level results in a new continue, and there are three difficulty levels. Some stages involve controlling vehicles, like a car or a motorcycle.

The game was shown at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 1994.

After breaking out of a zoo, Chester Cheetah is going to Hip City when Mean Eugene tears up his map into 10 pieces and scatters it across the United States. Chester Cheetah must then travel across America to recover the map. Chester visits fictional cities in states such as Nebraska, California, Florida, Arkansas, and Alaska.

The game was released only in America.

Both the Genesis and SNES versions of the game received mixed reviews. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reviewed both the versions. They gave the SNES version a score of 28 out of 50, and the Genesis version 24 out of 40. The reviewers praised the graphics and animations but cited poor control as a negative.

&quot;Sega Visions&quot; gave it a score of 12 out of 20, and gave it strong score for sound and music.

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; reviewed the SNES version and stated it had stiff controls, low challenge, but had good audio and graphics. They gave it an average score of 3.3/5.

&quot;GamePro&quot; magazine called it &quot;High on the list of unnecessary sequels&quot; and said &quot;like the cheese puffs themselves, Chester might sound like a tempting idea, but you&#x27;ll get no nourishment and you&#x27;ll soon be hungry again&quot;.

=== &quot;Just Dance 4&quot; ===
Chester Cheetah made a cameo appearance in the background of the redeemable version of the song &quot;You Make Me Feel...&quot; featured on the &quot;Just Dance 4&quot; video game. The track could be unlocked with a code found in a Cheetos bag, having exclusive traits on its background like a throne, and Chester Cheetah appearing sometimes on the back pillars and dancing along with the coach. Since the offer expired, the map it became available as a downloadable track for all consoles in all regions, however, without the special characteristics, equivalent to following games said map is featured in, such as &quot;Just Dance Now&quot; and &quot;Just Dance Unlimited&quot;. Along with the redeemable version, a commercial was released to promote it.

==Health concerns and legal status across countries==
Chester Cheetah, as well as other mascots featured in products targeted to children (such as Kellogg’s Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam), has been the subject of controversy in several countries. A study published in the journal &quot;Obesity Reviews&quot;, suggested familiar media character branding appeared to be &quot;a powerful influence on children&#x27;s preferences, choices and intake of less healthy foods.&quot; Chester and similar mascots, have been banned from being featured in packaging and advertising in countries like Chile, Peru, Argentina and Mexico. A study by a coalition that included Action on Sugar and Children&#x27;s Food Campaign in the UK, found that 51% of 526 assessed &quot;child-friendly&quot; food and drink products with popular cartoon characters on their packaging were high in sugar, saturated fat, salt and fat, with only 18 healthy products such as fruit, vegetables and water were found to use child-friendly cartoons. Tom Watson of the Labour Party said using playful characters to appeal to children is “grossly irresponsible”, and the Health and Social Care Select Committee issued calls for a blanket ban on ‘brand-generated characters or licensed TV and film characters which are used to promote foods high in fat, sugar or salt.&quot; Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks dropped 25 percent in the 18 months after Chile adopted these regulations, which also included octagon front-of-package warning labels and a ban on junk food in schools.

<text>John Michael Gibbons (born June 8, 1962) is an American professional baseball coach, manager and former player. Gibbons played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher with the New York Mets in 1984 and 1986.

Gibbons became a coach for the Toronto Blue Jays in 2002 and then became manager in 2004. He was fired during the 2008 season. He coached for the Kansas City Royals from 2009 to 2011 and managed in the minor leagues in 2012 before managing the Blue Jays again from 2013 to 2018. He is currently the bench coach for the New York Mets.

==Early life==
Gibbons was born in Great Falls, Montana, and raised in San Antonio, Texas, where he attended Douglas MacArthur High School. The son of United States Air Force colonel William Gibbons, he had his first Little League Baseball at-bat while playing in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, where the family lived temporarily.

==Playing career==
Gibbons was selected by the New York Mets with the 24th overall pick of the 1980 amateur draft. He spent the next three years moving up through the Mets minor-league system. In 1984, he was considered to be the Mets&#x27; top catching prospect, and was set to start the season in the majors. However, a collision with the Phillies&#x27; Joe Lefebvre in late March landed him on the 15-day disabled list. He eventually started six games at catcher in April 1984, but batted only .040 in that stretch. He went back on the disabled list with a sore arm at the end of April, and was sent back to AAA Tidewater after that.

Gibbons was next called up to the majors in the 1986 Mets season. He appeared in 8 games and batted .474 (9 for 19), but the Mets already had the majors&#x27; best catcher in Gary Carter and an established backup in Ed Hearn. Gibbons served as the Mets&#x27; bullpen catcher during the 1986 postseason, and earned a World Series ring when the Mets won the World Series.

Gibbons spent the next four seasons on five different AAA teams. He retired as a player after the 1990 season.

==Coaching and managerial career==
===Minor leagues===
Gibbons began his coaching career with the Mets in 1990 as a minor league roving catching instructor. In 1994, he joined the Mets&#x27; South Atlantic League franchise, the Capital City Bombers, as a hitting coach.

Gibbons began his minor-league managing career in the Mets&#x27; organization with the Kingsport Mets, guiding them to the Appalachian League championship in 1995. He followed that by guiding the St. Lucie Mets to the Florida State League title the next season. In 1998, he led the Eastern League&#x27;s Binghamton Mets to the playoffs, and then followed that with three seasons as manager of the Norfolk Tides. He led the Tides to the International League playoffs in 2001.

===Toronto Blue Jays (2002–2008)===

Hired by the Toronto Blue Jays&#x27; former general manager J. P. Ricciardi in 2002, as a bullpen catcher, Gibbons worked his way up to first base coach in June 2002. Ricciardi was his former roommate in the minor leagues.

After Ricciardi fired manager Carlos Tosca in 2004, Gibbons was promoted to the manager position. The Blue Jays went 20–30 with Gibbons at the helm.

At the end of the 2004 regular season, Gibbons signed a one-year contract as the manager for the 2005 season. He was later given a two-year contract extension just a week into the 2005 season. Gibbons went on to lead the Jays to an 80–82 record in his first full season as a big league manager.

Expectations were higher in 2006, after the Blue Jays acquired A. J. Burnett, Troy Glaus, Lyle Overbay, B. J. Ryan, and Bengie Molina. Toronto ended the season in second place in the American League East division with an 87–75 record, one game ahead of the Boston Red Sox. Although they finished 10 games out of first, it was the first time the Jays had finished higher than third since 1993, when they won their second of two consecutive World Series titles.

With the Blue Jays mired in a slump that put them five games below .500, Gibbons was fired on June 20, 2008. He was replaced by former Jays manager Cito Gaston. He finished with a record of 305 wins and 305 losses.

===Kansas City Royals and San Antonio Missions (2009–2012)===
On October 10, 2008, Gibbons was hired as the bench coach by the Kansas City Royals, replacing Dave Owen, who became the third base coach.

Gibbons was hired at the end of the 2011 season to manage the San Diego Padres&#x27; Double-A affiliate, the San Antonio Missions.

===Second stint with Toronto (2013–2018)===

On November 20, 2012, the Blue Jays re-hired Gibbons as their manager on a two–year rolling contract. Gibbons was named to the 2013 American League All-Star coaching staff by Detroit Tigers manager Jim Leyland. The Blue Jays finished the 2013 season with a 74–88 record, putting them last in the AL East.

The Blue Jays were six games up in the AL East title race on June 6, 2014, but posted a 45–54 record from that point on, including a 9–17 record in August. They would finish the season with a record of 83–79, good enough for third place in the AL East, and five games back of a wild card spot.

On June 22, 2015, the Blue Jays defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 8–5 for Gibbons&#x27; 500th managerial win. On August 2, Gibbons was ejected for the third time in the 2015 season, for arguing with umpire Jim Wolf. Gibbons returned to the field later in the game during a bench-clearing incident, and was subsequently suspended for one game. On September 25, Gibbons and the Blue Jays ended the team&#x27;s 22-year playoff drought by clinching a playoff berth. Five days later, the Blue Jays defeated the Baltimore Orioles 15–2, and clinched the American League East. On October 14, 2015, the Blue Jays defeated the Texas Rangers to win the American League Division Series after losing the first two games of the series. The Blue Jays moved on to play in their first American League Championship Series since 1993. They were defeated by the eventual World Series champions, the Kansas City Royals, in six games.

On April 5, 2016, after a 3–2 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays ended on a questionable slide by José Bautista which was ruled as a double play, Gibbons stated, &quot;Maybe we&#x27;ll come out and wear dresses tomorrow. Maybe that&#x27;s what everybody&#x27;s looking for.&quot; A day later, after he received criticism for his initial comment, he said that &quot;the world needs to lighten up a little bit&quot;. On May 17, Gibbons was suspended three games by Major League Baseball for his role in a benches-clearing incident between the Blue Jays and Texas Rangers on May 15 involving Rangers infielder Rougned Odor and Blue Jays outfielder José Bautista. On September 11, Gibbons was ejected for the eighth time in the 2016 season, tying the team&#x27;s single-season record set by Bobby Cox; he led the major leagues in 2016. In 2016, he was successful on a lower percentage of replay challenges than any other MLB manager with 10 or more challenges, at 38.8%. The Blue Jays made the playoffs for the second consecutive season, and defeated Baltimore in the Wild Card Game to advance. In the Division Series, the Blue Jays swept the Texas Rangers in three games. Toronto was eliminated by the Cleveland Indians in the Championship Series, four games to one.

On April 1, 2017, Gibbons signed a two-year extension with the Blue Jays, that also included an option for the 2020 season. In 2017, he was again successful on a lower percentage of replay challenges than any other MLB manager with 10 or more challenges, at 26.7%.

On September 26, 2018, it was confirmed by the Blue Jays that Gibbons would not return for the 2019 season. Toronto mayor John Tory proclaimed the 26th as &quot;John Gibbons Day&quot; in Toronto, noting Gibbons&#x27; &quot;tremendous contributions to the Toronto Blue Jays franchise.&quot; His final game was a 9–4 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. The Blue Jays finished the 2018 season with a 73–89 record. In 2018 he was ejected seven times, more than any other manager in the major leagues. During his second stint as Blue Jays manager, he finished with a record of 488 wins and 484 losses. Overall, Gibbons has a 793–789 record from both stints as Blue Jays manager.

===New York Mets===
On November 22, 2023, it was announced that Gibbons was expected to be hired as the bench coach of the New York Mets.

<doc id="1044875" wikidata="Q598633" url="?curid=1044875" title="Back to School">
<text>Back to School is a 1986 American comedy film starring Rodney Dangerfield, Keith Gordon, Sally Kellerman, Burt Young, Terry Farrell, William Zabka, Ned Beatty, Sam Kinison, Paxton Whitehead, Robert Downey Jr., M. Emmet Walsh, and Adrienne Barbeau. It was directed by Alan Metter. The plot centers on a wealthy but uneducated father (Dangerfield) who goes to college to show solidarity with his discouraged son Jason (Gordon) and learns that he cannot buy an education or happiness.

Kurt Vonnegut has a cameo as himself, as does the band Oingo Boingo, whose frontman Danny Elfman composed the score for the film. The University of Wisconsin–Madison was used as a backdrop for the movie, although it was called &quot;Grand Lakes University&quot;. The diving scenes were filmed at the since-demolished Industry Hills Aquatic Club in the City of Industry, California.

Before the end credits, the message &quot;For ESTELLE Thanks For So Much&quot; is shown in dedication to Estelle Endler, one of the executive producers of the film, who died during production. She was Dangerfield&#x27;s long-time manager, who helped him get into films such as &quot;Caddyshack&quot;.

==Plot==
Thornton Meloni, a child of Italian immigrants, returns from school one day to his father&#x27;s tailor shop, bearing a report card with poor grades. His ambition is to go into his father&#x27;s line of work, but the latter warns Thornton that &quot;If a man has no education, he&#x27;s got nothing.&quot;

As decades pass, Thornton Anglicizes his surname from Meloni to &quot;Melon&quot; and becomes a self-made corporate giant, with a successful chain of plus-size clothing stores and other business ventures. He also has a son named Jason. Jason becomes a college student who avoids Thorton despite their previous closeness. Jason&#x27;s mother has died, Thorton has remarried to a gold digger named Vanessa. When Vanessa splurges on an expensive party, Thornton reaches his breaking point and wishes to see Jason. He divorces Vanessa for adultery and instructs Lou, his bodyguard and chauffeur, to take him to Grand Lakes University.

On the campus, Thornton learns that the reason for Jason&#x27;s distant attitude with his father was that he is a C-student, unhappy with college life, and intends to drop out. He is a towel boy for the diving team instead of a member, was rejected by the fraternities, is antagonized by diver and jock Chas Osborne, and has no friends except for his roommate Derek Lutz. Thornton motivates him to stay in college by deciding to enroll alongside him. Despite Thornton&#x27;s lack of academic qualifications, the dean David Martin admits him when he bribes Martin with a donation for a new campus building.

Thornton&#x27;s bribery earns him the wrath of Dr. Philip Barbay, dean of the business school. His displeasure is further exacerbated by Thornton&#x27;s canny practical experience clashing with Barbay&#x27;s hypothetical theorizing in class and ivory tower ways. Thornton also develops a romantic interest in Barbay&#x27;s girlfriend, the literature professor Dr. Diane Turner. Meanwhile, Jason begins to attract the interest of Valerie Desmond, a girl whom Chas has been trying to impress. Thornton becomes a popular man on campus, throwing huge parties and exhibiting generosity to the fellow students. Jason earns a spot on the diving team, after Thornton, a former diver himself, convinces the diving coach to reconsider his abilities. Despite all this, Jason still feels he is living in Thornton’s shadow.

As a student, even though Diane is inspiring a deeper appreciation of literature, Thornton prefers partying to studying. He hires a team of professionals to complete his assignments, including Kurt Vonnegut to write a paper on Vonnegut for literature class. To Thornton&#x27;s surprise, Diane gives the paper a failing grade for obviously not being his own work and becomes disillusioned by his frivolous behavior. Jason is also upset with Thornton for trivializing education, while mistakenly believing Thornton bribed the coach into accepting him on the team.

Dr. Barbay accuses Thornton, in the presence of Dean Martin, of academic fraud. He challenges Thornton to an oral examination conducted by all of his professors, facing expulsion if he fails any part of it. Believing he has no chance of passing, Thornton packs up and prepares to leave. Jason stops Thornton and encourages him to stay and prepare for the challenge.

With limited time to prepare, Thornton crams for the examination with help from Jason, Derek, Lou, and Diane. When the big day comes, Barbay begins by intimidating Thornton with a single, 27-part question. Nevertheless, Thornton answers every part, though the effort is so much that he wants to forfeit. Diane inspires him to finish by asking him to recite a Dylan Thomas poem, &quot;Do not go gentle into that good night,&quot; which he does.

At the championship dive meet later that day, Thornton and Jason reconcile, while Grand Lakes University takes the lead. To spite Jason for his performance and for winning over Valerie, Chas fakes a cramp in an attempt to make his team lose. The coach decides to recruit Thornton as a last-minute replacement. Thornton helps the team win by performing the legendary but dangerous &quot;Triple Lindy&quot; dive. Afterwards, Thornton learns from Diane that he has passed the examination with all D&#x27;s, except for a single A from her. At the end of the school year, Thornton gives the commencement speech.

==Cast==
==Production==
Harold Ramis suggested a rewrite to the script. The producers originally wanted Jim Carrey to play the role of Professor Terguson, but he was later rejected as he was deemed too young for the part.

==Reception==
&quot;Back to School&quot; yielded $91.3 million domestically, and was the 6th highest-grossing film of 1986, as well as the second highest grossing comedy film of the year, behind &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (records state that in addition to the rental and theatrical gross it received, it went on to gross $108,634,920 globally).

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 80% rating based on 70 reviews, with an average rating of 6.50/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Back to School&quot; gives Rodney Dangerfield plenty of room to riff—and supports the freewheeling funnyman with enough of a story to keep things interesting between punchlines.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that &quot;Dangerfield seems to be setting the film&#x27;s brisk pace and flawless timing himself.&quot; Nina Darnton wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;the film is a good-natured potpourri of gags, funny bits, populist sentiment and anti-intellectualism.&quot; Roger Ebert&#x27;s &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; three-star review described the film as &quot;routine but pleasant&quot;, yet elevated by Dangerfield&#x27;s persona: &quot;This is exactly the sort of plot Marx or Fields could have appeared in. Dangerfield brings it something they might also have brought along: a certain pathos.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack was released on MCA, available in LP or Cassette (no CD), but cues from the score were released that year with selections from the score of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; (both re-recordings made in London) on CD.

==In popular culture==
The competition scene was parodied in the music video for Canadian rock band Sum 41&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;In Too Deep&quot;.

<text>The market town of Bad Fischau-Brunn is an Austrian municipality in the district of Wiener Neustadt-Land in Lower Austria. It is situated some 50 km south of Vienna at the edge of Viennese Basin.

Bad Fischau-Brunn is divided into two &quot;Katastralgemeinden&quot;: 
*Bad Fischau
*Brunn an der Schneebergbahn.

==History==

The oldest traces of settlement in the area of the municipality date back to the Hallstatt culture (8th-6th century BC). A Roman road passed through the area, and the sources of Fischau were already used in the Roman era. The name &quot;Fischau&quot; was first mentioned in the 9th century. It was mentioned as a market town in 1166, and was site of the mint, too. However, it lost its importance after Wiener Neustadt, founded at the end of the 12th century, became the site of the mint.

Exploitation of the mineral springs of Fischau took a rise in 1872, when the spa resort (&quot;Kristalltherme&quot;) was opened. It was rebuilt and expanded to its current state in 1900. The prefix &quot;Bad&quot; (spa town) has been added to the name in 1929. The current market town was formed in 1969 by merging the municipalities of Brunn an der Schneebergbahn and Bad-Fischau.

<text>Michael Lorri Scioscia ( ; born November 27, 1958), nicknamed &quot;Sosh&quot; and &quot;El Jefe&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The Boss&quot;), is an American former Major League Baseball catcher and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). He managed the Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels from the 2000 season through the 2018 season, and was the longest-tenured manager in Major League Baseball and second-longest-tenured coach/manager in the &quot;Big Four&quot; (MLB, NFL, NHL, and NBA), behind only Gregg Popovich at the time of his retirement. As a player, Scioscia made his major league debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers in . He was selected to two All-Star Games and won two World Series over the course of his 13-year MLB career, which was spent entirely with the Dodgers; this made him the only person in MLB history to spend his entire playing career with one team and entire managing career with another team with 10+ years in both places. He was signed by the San Diego Padres and Texas Rangers late in his career, but never appeared in a major league game for either team due to injury.

After his playing career ended, Scioscia spent several seasons as a minor league manager and major league coach in the Dodgers organization before being hired as the Angels manager after the 1999 season. As a manager, Scioscia led the Angels to their only-to-date World Series championship in . He is the Angels&#x27; all-time managerial leader in wins, games managed, and division titles. Scioscia was honored with the American League Manager of the Year Award in and . On May 8, 2011, Scioscia became the 56th manager to win 1,000 or more games, and the 23rd to have all 1,000 or more victories with a single team.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Scioscia was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first round (19th overall pick) of the 1976 amateur draft.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (1980–1992)===
Scioscia debuted for the Dodgers in 1980 (replacing Steve Yeager) and went on to play 12 years for the team. Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda helped lobby Scioscia to sign with the Dodgers after the team drafted him out of Springfield (Delaware County) High School, a public school located in the suburbs of Philadelphia in 1976.

Scioscia made himself invaluable to the Dodgers by making the effort to learn Spanish in order to better communicate with rookie sensation Fernando Valenzuela in 1981. 

Scioscia went to the San Diego Padres in 1993, but suffered a torn rotator cuff injury during spring training that year and did not play in any regular season games for the team. He closed out his career with the Texas Rangers in 1994 after a failed attempt to come back from the injury, again without having played in any regular season games that year.

Exclusively a catcher, the 6-foot, 2-inch, 230 pound Scioscia was primarily known for his defense. Former Dodgers vice president Al Campanis once called Scioscia the best plate-blocking catcher he had seen in his 46-year baseball career. In one collision with St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; slugger Jack Clark in July 1985, Scioscia was knocked unconscious but still held onto the ball. Scioscia, however, has claimed he had an even harder plate collision the following season.

Scioscia&#x27;s technique for blocking the plate and making a tag varied slightly from the traditional manner employed by most catchers. When applying the tag, most catchers hold the baseball in their bare hand, with that hand then being inside their catcher&#x27;s mitt to apply the tag with both hands. Scioscia preferred to hold the ball in his catcher&#x27;s mitt without making use of his bare hand. Also, Scioscia felt he was less prone to injury in a collision if he positioned his body so that he was kneeling on both knees and turned to the side, whereas most catchers make their tag either standing or on one knee.

Indeed, Scioscia was noted for his durability. After missing most of the 1983 season after tearing his rotator cuff, Scioscia played in more than 100 games each season for the remainder of his career with the Dodgers. Offensively, Scioscia was generally unspectacular, but he was known as a solid contact hitter, striking out fewer than once every 14 at-bats over the course of his career. Because of his ability to make contact, he was sometimes used as the second hitter in the batting order—an atypical slot for a player with Scioscia&#x27;s large-set frame and overall batting average. He had a particularly strong season on offense in 1985, batting .296 and finishing second in the National League in on-base percentage.

Scioscia also hit a dramatic, ninth inning, game-tying home run off the New York Mets&#x27; Dwight Gooden in Game 4 of the 1988 National League Championship Series. With the Dodgers going on to win that game in extra innings, Scioscia&#x27;s blast (which came after he had hit only three home runs that entire season) proved crucial to the Dodgers&#x27; ultimately prevailing in that series.

Scioscia was a key player on the Dodgers&#x27; 1981 and 1988 World Series champion teams, and is the Dodgers&#x27; all-time leader in games caught (1,395). In 1990, Scioscia became the first Dodger catcher to start in an All-Star Game since Hall of Famer Roy Campanella. Alfredo Griffin, Scioscia&#x27;s teammate from the 1988 Dodger team, served on Scioscia&#x27;s coaching staff with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim from 2000 to 2018. Scioscia earned as much as $2,183,333/year in salary toward the end of his career, and earned the unofficial total sum of $10,109,999 over his career.

Scioscia was involved in three no-hitters in his career: he was on the losing end of Nolan Ryan&#x27;s fifth no-hitter on September 26, 1981 vs. the Houston Astros, and on the winning side, he caught Fernando Valenzuela&#x27;s on June 29, 1990 vs. the St. Louis Cardinals and Kevin Gross&#x27;s on August 17, 1992 vs. the San Francisco Giants. He caught 136 shutouts during his career, ranking him fourth all-time among major league catchers. Scioscia used the same catcher&#x27;s mitt for most of his playing career.

&lt;br&gt;Career statistics&lt;br&gt;
==Managerial career==

===Anaheim Angels / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels (2000–2018)===
After spending several years as a coach in the Dodgers&#x27; organization, Scioscia was hired by new Angels general manager Bill Stoneman to be the Angels&#x27; manager after the 1999 season, following the late-season resignation of Terry Collins and interim managerial tenure of Joe Maddon. Scioscia would retain Maddon as an assistant until Maddon received his own managerial position with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in .

Under the leadership of Stoneman and Scioscia, the Angels ended their 16-year playoff drought in 2002, winning the AL Wild Card and ultimately winning the franchise&#x27;s first World Series, a series that pitted the Angels against a San Francisco Giants team managed by Scioscia&#x27;s former Dodgers teammate Dusty Baker. In winning the series, Scioscia became the 17th person to win a World Series as both a player and a manager (not including those who won as a player-manager).

Scioscia was honored as 2002 American League Manager of Year by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (the official Manager of the Year award, as recognized by Major League Baseball). He was also named 2002 A.L. Manager of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, &quot;USA Today Sports Weekly&quot;, and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. He was further named the overall Major League 2002 Manager of the Year by &quot;Baseball America&quot;.

The Angels under Scioscia would go on to enjoy a period of on-field success never before seen in franchise history, winning five American League West division titles in six years (surpassing the number won by all previous Angels managers combined). Scioscia&#x27;s Angels broke the franchise single-season win record with 99 wins in 2002, and again with 100 wins in 2008. However, they have yet to win another American League pennant or World Series since their memorable 2002 run.

Scioscia is the Angels&#x27; all-time leader in wins and games managed, surpassing original manager Bill Rigney&#x27;s totals in both categories in and , respectively. He was also the longest tenured manager in Major League Baseball. In January 2009, he received a multi-year extension on his contract; his former contract ran through the 2010 season. The number of additional years created through this contract was 10 years, through 2018. Scioscia was honored as 2009 American League Major League Manager of Year by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (the official Manager of the Year award, as recognized by Major League Baseball).

Scioscia became the first manager to reach the playoffs in six of his first ten seasons. On May 8, 2011, the Angels defeated the Cleveland Indians, which marked Scioscia&#x27;s 1,000th win as a major league manager.

A rift developed between Scioscia and Jerry Dipoto, the Angels&#x27; general manager, when Dipoto fired Mickey Hatcher from the role of the team&#x27;s hitting coach in 2012. Despite rumors that the Angels might replace either Dipoto or Scioscia after the 2013 season, Moreno announced that both would return to the Angels for the 2014 season.

Tension between Dipoto and Scioscia continued during the 2015 season regarding the way Scioscia and his coaches delivered statistical reports developed by Dipoto and the front office to their players. Dipoto resigned his post on July 1, 2015, despite efforts from the Angels to convince him to stay. Former Angels general manager Bill Stoneman, who hired Scioscia before the 2000 season, was hired as the interim general manager.

After 19 seasons as manager, following the conclusion of the 2018 season, Scioscia announced that he would step down as manager of the Angels on September 30, 2018. He finished with a record of 1,650 wins and 1,428 losses.

===United States national team===

On April 6, 2021, USA Baseball announced that Scioscia would manage the United States national baseball team during qualifying for baseball at the 2020 Summer Olympics, held in Tokyo in 2021. The team subsequently qualified, with Scioscia serving as manager for the Olympics. The team went on to win silver, falling to Japan in the gold-medal game.

On July 26, 2024, it was announced that Scioscia would helm the United States national team at the 2024 WBSC Premier12.

===Managerial record===

==Television appearances==

In addition to his more orthodox work in baseball, Scioscia is also notable for a guest appearance as himself on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; in 1992, while he was still a player. In the storyline, Scioscia is one of several Major League players recruited by Smithers to work a token job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant so that he could play on the plant&#x27;s softball team against a rival power plant. Scioscia tells Smithers, who found him while deer hunting, that while he enjoyed playing baseball, he always wanted to be a blue collar power plant employee, and consequently is the only player who takes the power plant job seriously. His character is ultimately hospitalized with a life-threatening case of radiation poisoning that leaves him unable to play.

&quot;They called and asked if I&#x27;d be interested in doing it, and it so happened that it was my favorite show. I was excited . . . Every year I get a (residual) check for like $4 . . . I cash &#x27;em. I don&#x27;t want to mess up their accounting department.&quot;
:— Mike Scioscia, about his appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;

Scioscia made a second appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; with the episode &quot;MoneyBart&quot;, which premiered on October 10, 2010. Having survived the radiation poisoning, he tells Marge and Bart that it gave him superhuman managing powers (as well as the ability to de-magnetise credit cards) and that the best players listen to their managers.

Scioscia acted as a celebrity endorser of the Howard&#x27;s Appliance &amp; Big Screen Superstore chain in Southern California.

==Personal life==

Early in his career after signing with the Dodgers, Scioscia spent the off-seasons attending Penn State University, working toward a computer science degree.
Scioscia and his wife Anne have two children and reside in Westlake Village, California.

Their son Matthew, who played baseball for Notre Dame, was selected in the 45th round by the Angels in the 2011 MLB Draft. He signed on June 20, and was assigned to the AZL Angels. He was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Trevor Gretzky, son of Wayne Gretzky, on March 20, 2014. He was released by the Windy City ThunderBolts on June 14.

<doc id="1044880" wikidata="Q4769307" url="?curid=1044880" title="Annie Henrietta Yule">
<text>Annie Henrietta Yule, Lady Yule ( Yule; 1 August 1874 – 14 July 1950) was a British film financier and a breeder of Arabian horses. She co-founded the British National Films Company and Hanstead Stud, and commissioned the superyachts of her day.

==Early life and marriage==

Annie Henrietta Yule was the only daughter of entrepreneur Andrew Yule and his wife, Emma Porter. She had a brother. The family&#x27;s money came largely from the jute trade. 

She was born in Calcutta on 1 August 1874. By the time she was six years old, the family were living in Dulwich, then part of Surrey.

Her father founded the conglomerate bearing his name, now owned by the Indian government, and (indirectly) Yule Catto &amp; Co, now known as Synthomer plc. She married her cousin, Sir David Yule, on 12 December 1900 at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. He had come out from Britain to join the family business. They had one child, a daughter, Gladys Meryl Yule (1903-1957).

Soon after the wedding, the couple moved to England; she refused to live in India after an attack of malaria, although her husband&#x27;s business interests remained there, and so he was unable to spend much time in the UK. They purchased Hanstead, a country house estate in Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, five miles from St Albans and not far from London. 

Lady Yule and her daughter lived there for the rest of their lives. In 1925, the Yules commissioned a new house for the site, designed to appear Georgian.

==Widowhood and wealth==
Sir David died in 1928, leaving his widow and daughter extremely wealthy women.
Indeed, at one point, Lady Yule was known as the richest woman in the UK, even surpassing Lucy, Lady Houston, but, on her death, she left only $1.6 million. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that he left an estate of $100,000,000, equivalent to $1.6 billion in 2022 money.

==Yachts and travel==
Lady Yule and Gladys were world travellers who reportedly shared an interest in big game hunting: Hanstead House was said to have been adorned by a large stuffed bear which they had killed in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. In the grounds they kept a seal, penguins, and wallabies. 

To facilitate their travels, Lady Yule ordered the large steam yacht &quot;Nahlin&quot;, from John Brown &amp; Company of Clydebank, Glasgow. The name is taken from a Native American word meaning &quot;fleet of foot&quot; and the yacht has a figurehead depicting a Native American wearing a feathered headdress beneath the bowsprit.

Mother and daughter enjoyed a world cruise on the &quot;Nahlin&quot; from 1931 to 1933. The archives of this voyage, including the guest book, are held by the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. 

In 1936 they chartered the &quot;Nahlin&quot; to King Edward VIII for a summer cruise on the Adriatic with Wallis Simpson, then still married to her American husband. He had succeeded to the throne only months before, and chose a private hire, rather than the royal yacht , to &quot;enable the avoidance of formality accorded to Royalty&quot;. As Lady Yule was a strict teetotaler, the king took over the library on the shade deck where he replaced the books with bottles. The presence of Simpson on board the yacht first &quot;alerted the world&#x27;s media to the impending abdication crisis.&quot; Informal photographs of Edward and Simpson on board together during the cruise were not published in Britain but became front-page news in the United States. During the cruise, &quot;Nahlin&quot; was escorted by , a Royal Navy destroyer.

The Yules sold the &quot;Nahlin&quot; to Carol II of Romania on the eve of World War II. The vessel, of a class now known colloquially as a superyacht, is as of 2022 owned by Sir James and Lady Dyson.

==Film financing==

Her biographer in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, historian Richard Davenport-Hines, describes her as &quot;restless and easily bored&quot; and suggests she joined the film industry &quot;as a diversion&quot; from her widowhood, as her &quot;commitment to filming was spasmodic&quot;. 

According to the 1986 autobiography of the director Michael Powell, &quot;A Life in Movies&quot;, &quot;she was casual, patriotic, and somewhat eccentric and saw in films a possible way to promote the British way of life.&quot; (Davenport-Hines also said she had &quot;strong religious opinions, a sharp tongue, and imperious habits.&quot;) She co-founded British National Films Company with J. Arthur Rank and producer John Corfield in 1934, and was one of the first investors in Pinewood Film Studios, although she left the management of these investments to others.

A 1952 biography of Rank devotes a chapter to &quot;Lady Yule and Religion&quot;.

==Horse breeding==

Lady Yule was more hands-on in the breeding farm she set up with her daughter at their home. They bred prize-winning cattle, and in 1925 turned their attention to Arabian horses. The Hanstead Stud became of national and international significance, &quot;second only in importance to&quot; Crabbet Arabian Stud. She showed more kindness to animals than to people, equipping her stables with mechanical drinking-troughs but expecting her staff to abstain from alcohol, as she did herself (although she was a heavy smoker). 

In 1927, she purchased Balaton Lodge, a racing stable in Newmarket, the centre of thoroughbred breeding. In 1947, she handed that property over to the Veterinary Educational Trust (later the Animal Health Trust), and, in 1956, Gladys made it an outright gift. 
Posthumously named after her, the Gladys Yule Surgical Wing, with cutting-edge facilities to anesthetise horses, was opened by the Queen in 1961. The Trust was based at Balaton until 1999. The lodge and stable courtyard have been renovated, and are now separate dwellings.

== Death ==
Lady Yule died at her home on 14 July 1950, aged 75. She left £523,198 16s. 7d. to her daughter, an amount equivalent to £18,330,000.00 in 2022. Her only child, Gladys, survived her by seven years.

<text>The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA, P.L. 95-128, 91 Stat. 1147, title VIII of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1977, &quot;et seq.&quot;) is a United States federal law designed to encourage commercial banks and savings associations to help meet the needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Congress passed the Act in 1977 to reduce discriminatory credit practices against low-income neighborhoods, a practice known as redlining.

The Act instructs the appropriate federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage regulated financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered, consistent with safe and sound operation (). To enforce the statute, federal regulatory agencies examine banking institutions for CRA compliance, and take this information into consideration when approving applications for new bank branches or for mergers or acquisitions ().
==Enforcement==
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 sought to address discrimination in loans made to individuals and businesses from low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Act mandates that all banking institutions that receive Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance be evaluated by Federal banking agencies to determine if the bank offers credit in a manner consistent with safe and sound operation (as per and ) in all communities in which they are chartered to do business. The law does not list specific criteria for evaluating the performance of financial institutions. Rather, it directs that the evaluation process should accommodate the situation and context of each individual institution. Federal regulations dictate agency conduct in evaluating a bank&#x27;s compliance in five performance areas, comprising twelve assessment factors. This examination culminates in a rating and a written report that becomes part of the supervisory record for that bank.

The law, however, emphasizes that an institution&#x27;s CRA activities should be undertaken in a safe and sound manner, and does not require institutions to make high-risk loans that may bring losses to the institution. An institution&#x27;s CRA compliance record is taken into account by the banking regulatory agencies when the institution seeks to expand through merger, acquisition or branching. The law does not mandate any other penalties for non-compliance with the CRA.

===Regulations===
The same banking agencies that are responsible for supervising depository institutions are also the agencies that conduct examinations for CRA compliance. These agencies are the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). In 1981, to help achieve the goals of the CRA, each of the Federal Reserve Banks established a Community Affairs Office to work with banking institutions and the public in identifying credit needs within the community and ways to address those needs.

Implementation of the CRA by these financial supervisory agencies is enacted by Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); Parts 25, 228, 345, and 563e with the addition of Part 203 as it relates to sections of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).

The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) coordinates inter-agency information about the CRA. Information about the CRA ratings of individual banking institutions from the three responsible agencies (Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC), is publicly available from the website of the FFIEC. These ratings were first made available by the Clinton administration to enable public participation and public comment on CRA performance.

In addition to the regulatory framework in place, each federal financial supervisory agency&#x27;s Inspector General performs regular audits on any regulatory changes made to see if the intended goals are actually being fulfilled.

==History==

The original Act was passed by the 95th United States Congress and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on October 12, 1977 (, ). The CRA was passed as a result of national pressure to address the deteriorating conditions of American cities—particularly lower-income and minority neighborhoods.

Community activists, such as Gale Cincotta of National People&#x27;s Action in Chicago, led the national fight to pass, and later to enforce the Act. Several legislative and regulatory revisions have since been enacted. 

===Original act===
The CRA followed similar laws passed to reduce discrimination in the credit and housing markets including the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA). The Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other personal characteristics. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires that financial institutions publicly disclose mortgage lending and application data. In contrast with those acts, the CRA seeks to ensure the provision of credit to all parts of a community, regardless of the relative wealth or poverty of a neighborhood.

Before the Act was passed, there were severe shortages of credit available to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In their 1961 report, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that African-American borrowers were often required to make higher downpayments and adopt faster repayment schedules. The commission also documented blanket refusals to lend in particular areas (redlining).

The allegations of &quot;redlining&quot; certain neighborhoods originated with the Federal Housing Administration in the 1930s. The &quot;residential security maps&quot; created by the Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation (HOLC) for the FHA were used by private and public entities for years afterwards to withhold mortgage capital from neighborhoods that were deemed &quot;unsafe&quot;. Contributory factors in the shortage of direct lending in low- and moderate-income communities were a limited secondary market for mortgages, informational problems to do with the lack of credit evaluations for lower-income borrowers, and lack of coordination among credit agencies.

In Congressional debate on the Act, critics charged that the law would create unnecessary regulatory burdens. Partly in response to these concerns, Congress included little prescriptive detail and simply directs the banking regulatory agencies to ensure that banks and savings associations serve the credit needs of their local communities in a safe and sound manner. Community groups only slowly organized to take advantage of their right under the Act to complain about law enforcement of the regulations.

The years in which the legislative revisions were made appear in bold text preceding the Public Laws that enacted them. The links to the &quot;codification&quot; and &quot;section notes&quot; may provide additional information about the legislative changes as well.
===Legislative changes 1989===
The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) was enacted by the 101st Congress and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush in the wake of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. As part of the subsequent general reform of the banking industry, FIRREA added section 807 (12. U.S.C. § 2906) to the existing CRA statutes in an effort to improve the area concerning insured depository institution examinations.

The new language now required the appropriate Federal regulatory agency to prepare a written evaluation after completing the examination of an institution&#x27;s record in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including any low- and moderate-income neighborhoods within it. These evaluation reports were divided into separate sections - one confidential; allowing the evaluated institution to retain its proprietary and personal information integrity at the same time the beginnings of the related databases were being compiled, and the other made public; intended to increase access and oversight of the CRS examination process. The public section introduced a four-tiered CRA examination rating system with performance levels of &#x27;Outstanding&#x27;, &#x27;Satisfactory&#x27;, &#x27;Needs to Improve&#x27;, or &#x27;Substantial Noncompliance&#x27;, each supplemented with a written synopsis of the agencies&#x27; evaluation reasoning using any available facts to support their conclusions.

According to Ben Bernanke, this law greatly increased the ability of advocacy groups, researchers, and other analysts to &quot;perform more-sophisticated, quantitative analyses of banks&#x27; records&quot;, thereby influencing the lending policies of banks. Over time, community groups and nonprofit organizations established &quot;more-formalized and more-productive partnerships with banks.&quot;

===Legislative changes 1991===
Around the time of the introduction of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), the appropriate Federal regulatory agencies had reliably compiled enough institution examination data to warrant its inclusion in the public section of the written evaluations first established in 1989. With the passage of this Act in December 1991, section 807 (12. U.S.C. § 2906) was amended to require the inclusion of any examination data relevant in determining an institutions CRA rating as well.

A week earlier that same December, the existing CRA statute was amended once again upon the enactment of the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991. It allowed the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) to make available any branch of any savings association located in any predominantly minority neighborhoods that the RTC had been appointed the conservator or receiver of any minority depository institution or women&#x27;s depository institution with favorable conditions. Upon the addition of section 808 (12. U.S.C. § 2907) to the existing CRA statutes by the Act, any depository institution which donated, sold with favorable terms (as determined by the appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency), or made available on a rent-free basis any branch of such institutions located in any predominantly minority neighborhood to any minority depository institution or women&#x27;s depository institution, the amount of the contribution or the amount of the loss incurred in connection with such activity would go towards meeting the credit needs of the institution&#x27;s community and would be taken into consideration when CRA examinations were evaluated.

===Legislative changes 1992===
Although minor amendments were made directly to the Community Reinvestment Act concerning the during evaluations first established in 1991, other portions of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 &quot;indirectly&quot; affected the CRA practices at the time in requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government sponsored enterprises that purchase and securitize mortgages, to devote a percentage of their lending to support affordable housing.

===Legislative changes 1994===
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which repealed restrictions on interstate banking, listed the &quot;Community Reinvestment Act&quot; ratings received by the out-of-state bank as a consideration when determining whether to allow interstate branches.

According to Bernanke, a surge in bank merger and acquisition activities followed the passing of the act, and advocacy groups increasingly used the public comment process to protest bank applications on &quot;Community Reinvestment Act&quot; grounds. When applications were highly contested, federal agencies held public hearings to allow public comment on the bank&#x27;s lending record. In response many institutions established separate business units and subsidiary corporations to facilitate CRA-related lending. Local and regional public-private partnerships and multi-bank loan consortia were formed to expand and manage such CRA-related lending.

===Regulatory changes 1995===
In July 1993, President Bill Clinton asked regulators to reform the CRA in order to make examinations more consistent, clarify performance standards, and reduce cost and compliance burden.

Robert Rubin, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, under President Clinton, explained that this was in line with President Clinton&#x27;s strategy to &quot;deal with the problems of the inner city and distressed rural communities&quot;. Discussing the reasons for the Clinton administration&#x27;s proposal to strengthen the CRA and further reduce red-lining, Lloyd Bentsen, Secretary of the Treasury at that time, affirmed his belief that availability of credit should not depend on where a person lives, &quot;The only thing that ought to matter on a loan application is whether or not you can pay it back, not where you live.&quot; Bentsen said that the proposed changes would &quot;make it easier for lenders to show how they&#x27;re complying with the Community Reinvestment Act&quot;, and &quot;cut back a lot of the paperwork and the cost on small business loans&quot;.

By early 1995, the proposed CRA regulations were substantially revised to address criticisms that the regulations, and the agency&#x27;s implementation of them through the examination process to date, were too process-oriented, burdensome, and not sufficiently focused on actual results. The CRA examination process itself was reformed to incorporate the pending changes. Information about banking institutions&#x27; CRA ratings was made available via web page for public review as well. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also moved to revise its regulation structure allowing lenders subject to the CRA to claim community development loan credits for loans made to help finance the environmental cleanup or redevelopment of industrial sites when it was part of an effort to revitalize the low- and moderate-income community where the site was located.

During one of the Congressional hearings addressing the proposed changes in 1995, William A. Niskanen, chair of the Cato Institute, criticized both the 1993 and 1994 sets of proposals for political favoritism in allocating credit, for micromanagement by regulators and for the lack of assurances that banks would not be expected to operate at a loss to achieve CRA compliance. He predicted the proposed changes would be very costly to the economy and the banking system in general. Niskanen believed that the primary long-term effect would be an artificial contraction of the banking system. Niskanen recommended Congress repeal the &quot;Act&quot;.

Niskanen&#x27;s, and other respondents to the proposed changes, voiced their concerns during the public comment &amp; testimony periods in late 1993 through early 1995. In response to the aggregate concerns recorded by then, the Federal financial supervisory agencies (the OCC, FRB, FDIC, and OTS) made further clarifications relating to definition, assessment, ratings and scope; sufficiently resolving many of the issues raised in the process. The agencies jointly reported their final amended regulations for implementing the &quot;Community Reinvestment Act&quot; in the Federal Register on May 4, 1995. The final amended regulations replaced the existing CRA regulations in their entirety. (See the notes in the &quot;1995&quot; column of Table I. for the specifics)

===Legislative changes 1999===
In 1999 the Congress enacted and President Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the &quot;Financial Services Modernization Act&quot;. This law repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933. A similar bill was introduced in 1998 by Senator Phil Gramm but it was unable to complete the legislative process into law. Resistance to enacting the 1998 bill, as well as the subsequent 1999 bill, centered around the legislation&#x27;s language which would expand the types of banking institutions of the time into other areas of service but would not be subject to CRA compliance in order to do so. The Senator also demanded full disclosure of any financial &quot;deals&quot; which community groups had with banks, accusing such groups of &quot;extortion&quot;.

In the fall of 1999, Senators Dodd and Schumer prevented another impasse by securing a compromise between Sen. Gramm and the Clinton Administration by agreeing to amend the &quot;Federal Deposit Insurance Act&quot; () to allow banks to merge or expand into other types of financial institutions. The FDIC related provisions of the new &quot;Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&quot;, along with the addition of sub-section § 2903(c) directly to Title 12, insured any bank holding institution wishing to be re-designated as a financial holding institution by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System would also have to follow &quot;Community Reinvestment Act&quot; compliance guidelines before any merger or expansion could take effect.

At the same time the &quot;G-L-B Act&#x27;s&quot; changes to the &quot;Federal Deposit Insurance Act&quot; would now allow for bank expansions into new lines of business, non-affiliated groups entering into agreements with these bank or financial institutions would also have to be reported as outlined under the newly added section to Title 12, § 1831y (CRA Sunshine Requirements), to satisfy Gramm&#x27;s concerns.

In conjunction with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act changes, smaller banks would be reviewed less frequently for CRA compliance by the addition of §2908. (Small Bank Regulatory Relief) directly to , (the existing CRA laws), itself. The 1999 Act also mandated two studies to be conducted in connection with the &quot;Community Reinvestment Act&quot;:
:* the first report by the Federal Reserve, to be delivered to Congress by March 15, 2000, is a comprehensive study of CRA to focus on default and delinquency rates, and the profitability of loans made in connection with CRA;
:* the second report to be conducted by the Treasury Department over the next two years, is intended to determine the impact of the Act on the provision of services to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and people, as intended by CRA.

On signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, President Clinton said that it, &quot;establishes the principles that, as we expand the powers of banks, we will expand the reach of the [Community Reinvestment] Act&quot;.

===Regulatory changes 2005===
In 2002 there was an inter-agency review of the effectiveness of the 1995 regulatory changes to the Community Reinvestment Act and new proposals were considered. In 2003, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York noted that dramatic changes in the financial services landscape had weakened the CRA, and that in 2003 less than 30 percent of all home purchase loans were subject to intensive review under the CRA.

In early 2005, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) implemented new rules that – among other changes – allowed thrifts with over $1 billion in assets to tweak the long-standing 50-25-25 CRA ratings thresholds by continuing to meet 50 percent of their overall CRA rating through lending activity as always but the other 50 percent could be any combination of lending, investment, and services that the thrift wanted. The obligations to adhere to 25 percent for services and 25 percent for investments became optional and the means to securing a satisfactory CRA rating was left to the discretion of the qualifying thrifts instead (See the notes in the &quot;2005&quot; column of Table I. for the specifics).

In April 2005, a contingent of Democratic Congressmen led by Representative Barney Frank issued a letter protesting these changes, saying they undercut the ability of the CRA to &quot;meet the needs of low and moderate-income persons and communities&quot;. The changes were also opposed by community groups concerned that it would weaken the CRA.

After enacting a technical regulatory amendment in the interim incorporating a different formula for stratifying both metropolitan and rural zones to better align with an expanded definition of them under the CRA in the process, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also put a new set of regulations into effect in September 2005 - mirroring much of what the OTS had already initiated earlier in the year (See the notes in the &quot;2005&quot; column of Table I for specifics). These regulations also included less restrictive definitions of &quot;small&quot; and &quot;intermediate small&quot; banks. &quot;Intermediate small banks&quot; were defined as banks with assets of less than $1 billion but more than $250 million, which allowed these banks to opt for examination as either as a small bank or a large bank. Currently banks with assets greater than $1.061 billion have their CRA performance evaluated according to lending, investment and service tests. The agencies use the Consumer Price Index to adjust the asset size thresholds for small and large institutions annually.

===Regulatory changes 2007===
The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) proposed revising and started to solicit public comment regarding the complete alignment of its CRA rule with the CRA rules of the other three federal banking agencies in November 2006. The agency referenced several factors for the proposed realignment, in particular, that a consistent CRA standard applied to both the banking and the thrift industries would facilitate objective evaluations of CRA performance; ensure accurate assessments of banks and thrifts that operated in the same markets; and permit the public to make reasonable comparisons of bank and thrift CRA performance.

OTS Director at the time, John Reich announced the final decision to go ahead and implement the proposed revisions in four main areas of its existing &quot;Community Reinvestment Act&quot; (CRA) regulations to reestablish uniformity between its rules and those of the other federal banking agencies. Reaffirming the basis for the revised rules as first proposed, Reich stated, &quot;OTS is making these revisions to promote consistency and facilitate objective evaluations of CRA performance across the banking and thrift industries. Consistent standards will allow the public to make more effective comparisons of bank and thrift CRA performance.&quot; He noted the changes reinforce CRA objectives consistent with thrifts&#x27; performance in meeting the financial services needs of their communities.

This OTS rule revision aligned with that of the other agencies by:
# eliminating the option of alternative weights for lending, investment, and service under the large, retail savings association test;
# defining institutions with assets between $250 million and $1 billion as &quot;intermediate small savings associations&quot; subject to a new community development test;
# indexing the asset threshold for &quot;small&quot; and &quot;intermediate small&quot; savings associations annually based on changes to the Consumer Price Index (CPI); and
# clarifying the adverse impact on a savings association&#x27;s CRA rating where the OTS finds evidence of discrimination or other illegal credit practices.

These four changes generally mirror the ones made by the other three federal agencies in late 2005. The agency noted that latitude would be provided for a short period of time to institutions in the context of examinations conducted after the effective date, July 1, 2007, in order to implement program changes under the new rule smoothly.

===Legislative changes 2008===
With the passage of the Higher Education Opportunity Act into law, , on August 14, 2008, each appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency shall now consider, as a factor in assessing and taking into account the record of a financial institution&#x27;s CRA compliance, any &amp; all low-cost education loans provided by the financial institution to low-income borrowers. All the affected Federal financial supervisory agencies have one year after the date of enactment to issue rules in final form to implement the change into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) according to Title X, Subtitle C, Section 1031 of the Act.

===CRA reform proposals===
In 2007, Ben Bernanke suggested further increasing the presence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the affordable housing market to help banks fulfill their CRA obligations by providing them with more opportunities to securitize CRA-related loans.

On February 13, 2008, the United States House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing on the Community Reinvestment Act&#x27;s impact on the provision of loans, investments and services to under-served communities and its effectiveness. There were 15 witnesses from government and the private sector.

On April 15, 2008, an FDIC official told the same committee that the FDIC was exploring offering incentives for banks to offer low-cost alternatives to payday loans. Doing so would allow them favorable consideration under their Community Reinvestment Act responsibilities. It had recently begun a two-year pilot project with an initial group of 31 banks.

Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson introduced new legislation, the , on March 12, 2009, to expand the scope of CRA to include non-bank financial institutions, such as credit unions. There were other attempts to legislatively &quot;modernize&quot; the Community Reinvestment Act in previous sessions of Congress, such as in / and , among others. The United States House Committee on Financial Services held hearings on September 16, 2009 on &quot;Proposals to Modernize the Community Reinvestment Act&quot; with 10 witnesses, including Johnson. Another hearing was held on April 15, 2010 on &quot;Perspectives and Proposals on the Community Reinvestment Act&quot; with eight witnesses.

On June 24, 2010, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) jointly published proposed revisions to the rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act. These agencies, with the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), make up the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), which coordinates regulation of financial institutions, including implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act. The proposed revisions to CRA rules are intended to revise the term &quot;community development&quot; to &quot;include loans, investments and services that support, enable or facilitate projects or activities&quot; that meet the criteria described in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) and are conducted in designated target areas identified under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program established by HERA and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Among other things, this would expand the range of persons served to include middle-income households. 

In 2009, The Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and San Francisco published &quot;Revisiting the CRA: Perspectives on the Future of the Community Reinvestment Act&quot;, which assembles views from a wide range of academic researchers, regulators, community development practitioners and financial service industry representatives on how to improve the CRA going forward. 

The Obama administration has increased scrutiny of the provision of credit to poor and African American neighborhoods. Lenders have come under investigation for not operating in such areas, whether they have halted service there or have never operated in them before. Former &quot;Atlantic&quot; associate editor Daniel Indiviglio attributes increasing noncompliance with the CRA to the tightening of lending requirements.

In 2020, the OCC proposed a final rule for CRA that was billed as an attempt to modernize the act to keep with changes in the financial sector, particularly the growth of digital banking. It did this unilaterally without support from the FDIC and the Federal Reserve.

Community groups were also opposed to the 2020 proposal. Led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC), 1,594 or 83% of the 1,922 unique comments submitted disagreed with the OCC’s rule; 674 of those comments cited NCRC or used some of the organization’s suggested language. An additional 10,000 comments from individuals, submitted through an online petition campaign, also supported NCRC’s point of view. 

Despite this opposition, the OCC published the final rule in 2020. Immediately after, NCRC and the California Reinvestment Coalition (CRC), represented by Democracy Forward and Farella Braun + Martel, filed a lawsuit seeking to vacate the OCC’s CRA rule, claiming that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and was finalized without sufficient data to support the revisions. In February 2020, a federal judge rejected the OCC’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, a key hurdle in moving the claim forward. 

In January 2021, with the inauguration of President Joe Biden, the OCC went under new leadership, and on December 14, 2021, the OCC fully rescinded its 2020 CRA rule. 

Community groups submitted a position paper on March 1, 2022, to the OCC, FDIC and Federal Reserve about the key reforms they wanted to see. These included a consideration of race on CRA exams, more objective measures of performance that reduce ratings inflation, and expanded CRA assessment areas that include not only where banks have branches but also areas with significant amounts of bank lending and/or deposit activity. 

The groups also recommended that CRA be expanded to apply throughout the financial sector, beyond banks. This would require Congressional legislation, but there were precedents in state CRA laws that apply to mortgage companies and credit unions, not just banks.

New regulations with the support of consumer advocates were proposed in October 2023, that would count online loans to target demographics regardless of geographic location. These were the subject of a lawsuit by the American Bankers Association.

==Criticisms==
===Effectiveness===
The first major research study of CRA was the 1993 book &quot;Community Reinvestment Performance&quot; (1993, Probus Publishing) by Kenneth H. Thomas, Ph.D., a Finance Lecturer at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The main conclusion of the book, which was based on an analysis of the results of 6,706 CRA exams, was that the law was needed and it works but it must be improved, mainly through better and more objective enforcement to avoid &quot;CRA Grade Inflation&quot;. Many of the recommendations in that book were included in the 1995 CRA reform. &quot;The CRA Handbook&quot; (1998, McGraw Hill) carefully examined over 1,500 CRA exams under the 1995 reforms and identified further CRA Grade Inflation and made specific recommendations to improve the law&#x27;s effectiveness, primarily through more objective and quantifiable standards.

Some economists have questioned if the CRA was – or at least had become – irrelevant, because it was not needed to encourage banks to make profitable loans to a variety of borrowers. In a 2003 research paper, economists at the Federal Reserve could not find clear evidence that the CRA increased lending and home ownership more in low income neighborhoods than in higher income ones. A 2008 Competitive Enterprise Institute study resulted in a similar finding.

Former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke has stated that an underlying assumption of the CRA – that more lending equals better outcomes for local communities – may not always be true, pointing to &quot;recent problems in mortgage markets&quot;. However, he notes that at least in some instances, &quot;the CRA has served as a catalyst, inducing banks to enter under-served markets that they might otherwise have ignored&quot;.

The Woodstock Institute, a Chicago-based policy and advocacy nonprofit, found in an analysis of 1996 Chicago-area survey data that low income areas still lagged behind in access to commercial loans. Most small business loans made by CRA regulated banks went to higher income areas; 16.6% in low-income areas, 18.4% in low- and moderate-income tracts; 21.8% in middle-income areas and 23.1% in upper-income areas.

In a 1998 paper, Alex Schwartz of the Fannie Mae Foundation found that CRA agreements were &quot;consistently successful in meeting their goals for mortgages, investments in low-income housing tax credits, grant giving to community-based organizations, and in opening (and keeping open) inner-city bank branches.&quot; In a 2000 report for the US Treasury, several economists concluded that the CRA had the intended impact of improving access to credit for minority and low-to-moderate-income consumers.

In a 2005 paper for the &quot;New York University Law Review&quot;, Michael S. Barr, professor at the University of Michigan Law School, presented evidence to demonstrate that the CRA had overcome market failures to increase access to credit for low-income, moderate-income, and minority borrowers at relatively low cost. He contends that the CRA is justified, has resulted in progress, and should be continued.

Speaking to the February 2008 Congressional Committee on Financial Services hearing on the CRA, Sandra L. Thompson, Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection at the FDIC, lauded the positive impact of CRA, noting that, &quot;studies have pointed to increases in lending to low- and moderate-income customers and minorities in the decades since the CRA&#x27;s passage.&quot; She cited a study by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, that found that &quot;data for 1993 through 2000 show home purchase lending to low- and moderate-income people living in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods grew by 94 percent – more than in any of the other income categories&quot;.

In his statement before the same hearing, New York University economics professor Larry White stated that regulator efforts to &quot;lean on&quot; banks in vague and subjective ways to make loans is an &quot;inappropriate instrument for achieving those goals&quot;. In a world of national banking enterprises, these policies are more likely to drive institutions out of neighborhoods. He stated that better ways to accomplish the goals would be vigorous enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, of antitrust laws to promote competition, and federal funding of worthy projects directly through an &quot;on-budget and transparent process&quot; like the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.

According to a 2012 study &quot;credit markets enabled a substantial fraction of Hispanic families to live in neighbourhoods with fewer black families, even though a substantial fraction of black families were moving to more racially integrated areas. The net effect is that credit markets increased racial segregation&quot;.

Politico has reported that the Community Reinvestment Act may sometimes push poor people out of their own neighborhoods by facilitating investment by outsiders.

===Sound practices and profitability===
According to a 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends in 305 U.S. cities between 1993 and 1998, $467 billion in mortgage credit flowed from CRA-covered lenders to low- and medium-income borrowers and areas. In that period, the total number of loans to poorer Americans by CRA-eligible institutions rose by 39% while loans to wealthier individuals by CRA-covered institutions rose by 17%. The share of total US lending to low and medium income borrowers rose from 25% in 1993 to 28% in 1998 as a consequence.

Responding to concerns that the CRA would lower bank profitability, a 1997 research paper by economists at the Federal Reserve found that &quot;[CRA] lenders active in lower-income neighborhoods and with lower-income borrowers appear to be as profitable as other mortgage-oriented commercial banks&quot;.

Concerns at the time over the 1995 regulatory change causing an increase in the inability of financial institutions to expand through mergers or acquisition due to regulatory denial based on poor CRA compliance were unfounded. Over the 1993-97 period, one regulatory agency, the Federal Reserve Board, actually approved more applications than the average percentages of those without a detailed CRA review taking place. Of the 1,100 merger or acquisition cases the FRB reviewed on average per year where the relevant institutions were subject to CRA, only 70 instances on average were identified with potential CRA problems regardless of public opposition or internal reporting raising the concern. On average, 22 of these were ultimately identified as CRA compliance being the primary reason for both application withdrawal or FRB denial.

In October 1997, First Union Capital Markets and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co launched the first publicly available securitization of Community Reinvestment Act loans, issuing $384.6 million of such securities. The securities were guaranteed by Freddie Mac and had an implied &quot;AAA&quot; rating. The public offering was several times oversubscribed, predominantly by money managers and insurance companies who were not buying them for CRA credit.

In October 2000, to expand the secondary market for affordable community-based mortgages and to increase liquidity for CRA-eligible loans, Fannie Mae committed to purchase and securitize $2 billion of &quot;MyCommunityMortgage&quot; loans. In November 2000 Fannie Mae announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (&quot;HUD&quot;) would soon require it to dedicate 50% of its business to low- and moderate-income families.&quot; It stated that since 1997 Fannie Mae had done nearly $7 billion in CRA business with depository institutions, but its goal was $20 billion. In 2001 Fannie Mae announced that it had acquired $10 billion in specially-targeted Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) loans more than one and a half years ahead of schedule, and announced its goal to finance over $500 billion in CRA business by 2010, about one third of loans anticipated to be financed by Fannie Mae during that period.

Speaking in 2007, the 30th anniversary of the CRA, Ben Bernanke, Chair of the Federal Reserve System since 2006, stated that the high costs of gathering information, &quot;may have created a &#x27;first-mover&#x27; problem, in which each financial institution has an incentive to let one of its competitors be the first to enter an underserved market&quot;. Bernanke notes that at least in some instances, &quot;the CRA has served as a catalyst, inducing banks to enter underserved markets that they might otherwise have ignored&quot;. In the same 2007 speech, Bernanke also noted that, &quot;managers of financial institutions found that these loan portfolios, if properly underwritten and managed, could be profitable&quot; and that the loans &quot;usually did not involve disproportionately higher levels of default&quot;.

===Housing advocacy groups===
CRA regulations give community groups the right to comment on or protest banks&#x27; purported non-compliance with CRA. Such comments could help or hinder banks&#x27; planned expansions. Groups at first only slowly took advantage of these rights. Regulatory changes during the Clinton administration allowed these community groups better access to CRA information and enabled them to increase their activities.

In an article for the &quot;New York Post&quot;, economist Stan Liebowitz wrote that community activists&#x27; intervention at yearly bank reviews resulted in their obtaining large amounts of money from banks, since poor reviews could lead to frustrated merger plans and even legal challenges by the Justice Department. Michelle Minton noted that Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to ACORN around the same time they were to apply for permission to merge and needed to comply with CRA regulations.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, some of these housing advocacy groups provided early warnings about the potential impact of lowered credit standards and the resulting unsupportable increase in real estate values they were causing in low to moderate income communities. Ballooning mortgages on rental properties threatened to require large rent increases from low and moderate income tenants that could ill afford them.

According to &quot;Inner City Press&quot;, &quot;Bronx-based Fair &quot;Finance Watch&quot; commented to the Federal Reserve about the practices of now-defunct non-bank subprime lender New Century, when U.S. Bancorp bought warrants for 24% of New Century&#x27;s stock. The Fed, rather than take any action on New Century, merely waited until U.S. Bancorp sold off some of the warrants, and then said the issue was moot.&quot; However, subprime loans were so profitable, that they were aggressively marketed in low-and moderate-income communities, even over the objections and warnings of housing advocacy groups like ACORN.

===Predatory lending===
In a 2002 study exploring the relationship between the CRA and lending looked at as predatory, Kathleen C. Engel and Patricia A. McCoy noted that banks could receive CRA credit by lending or brokering loans in lower-income areas that would be considered a risk for ordinary lending practices. CRA regulated banks may also inadvertently facilitate these lending practices by financing lenders. They noted that CRA regulations, as then administered and carried out by Fannie Mae and Freddie MAC, did not penalize banks that engaged in these lending practices. They recommended that the federal agencies use the CRA to sanction behavior that either directly or indirectly increased predatory lending practices by lowering the CRA rating of any bank that facilitated in these lending practices.

The FDIC has tried to address this issue by &quot;stopping abusive practices through the examination process and supervisory actions; encouraging banks to serve all members and areas of their communities fairly; and providing information and financial education to help consumers make informed choices&quot;. FDIC policy currently states that &quot;predatory lending can have a negative effect on a bank&#x27;s CRA performance.&quot;

Competition also played a part in lending practices. In order to gain market share lenders lowered their standards.

===Relationship to the 2008 financial crisis===

Economist Stan Liebowitz wrote in the &quot;New York Post&quot; that a strengthening of the CRA in the 1990s encouraged a loosening of lending standards throughout the banking industry. He charged the Federal Reserve with ignoring the negative impact of the CRA. According to Manhattan Institute scholar Howard Husock, the CEO of a midsize bank reported that 20% of his institution&#x27;s CRA-related mortgages were delinquent in their first year and probably 7% would end in foreclosure. In a commentary for CNN, Congressman Ron Paul, who serves on the United States House Committee on Financial Services, charged the CRA with &quot;forcing banks to lend to people who normally would be rejected as bad credit risks.&quot; In a &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; opinion piece, economist Russell Roberts wrote that the CRA subsidized low-income housing by pressuring banks to serve poor borrowers and poor regions of the country.

Other economists have examined the issue and concluded that the CRA did not contribute to the financial crisis, notably economist Paul Krugman, Tim Westrich of the Center for American Progress, Robert Gordon of the American Prospect, Ellen Seidman of the New America Foundation, Daniel Gross of &quot;Slate&quot;, Dean Baker of The Center For Economic and Policy Research, and Aaron Pressman from &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;. Law professor Michael S. Barr, a Treasury Department official under President Clinton, stated that approximately 50% of subprime loans were made by independent mortgage companies that were not regulated by the CRA, and another 25% to 30% came from only partially CRA regulated bank subsidiaries and affiliates. Barr noted that institutions fully regulated by CRA made &quot;perhaps one in four&quot; sub-prime loans, and that &quot;the worst and most widespread abuses occurred in the institutions with the least federal oversight&quot;.

According to American Enterprise Institute fellow Edward Pinto, Bank of America reported in 2008 that its CRA portfolio, which constituted 7% of its owned residential mortgages, was responsible for 29 percent of its losses. He charged that &quot;approximately 50 percent of CRA loans for single-family residences ... [had] characteristics that indicated high credit risk&quot;, yet, per the standards used by the various government agencies to evaluate CRA performance at the time, were not counted as &quot;subprime&quot; because borrower credit worthiness was not considered. Krugman argues that Pinto&#x27;s category of &quot;other high-risk mortgages&quot; incorrectly includes loans that were not high-risk, that instead were like traditional conforming mortgages. Gene Epstein of Barron&#x27;s disputed Krugman&#x27;s claims and those of the article he cited as erroneous and misleading. Another CRA critic, Joseph Fried, concedes that &quot;some of this CRA subprime lending might have taken place, even in the absence of CRA. For that reason, the direct impact of CRA on the volume of subprime lending is not certain.&quot; A study by the economists, Agarwal, Benmelich, and Bergman, found that banks undergoing CRA-related regulatory exams took additional mortgage lending risk.

The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission formed by the US Congress in 2009 to investigate the causes of the 2008 financial crisis, concluded &quot;the CRA was not a significant factor in subprime lending or the crisis&quot;. Ben Bernanke, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, wrote that experience and research contradict &quot;the charge that CRA was at the root of, or otherwise contributed in any substantive way to, the current mortgage difficulties.&quot; Government economists and officials, including Janet Yellen, then President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan, and Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner, also hold that the CRA did not significantly contribute to the subprime crisis. According to Yellen, former Chair of the Federal Reserve, independent mortgage companies made risky &quot;higher-priced&quot; loans at more than twice the rate of the banks and thrifts; most CRA loans were responsibly made, and were not the &quot;higher-priced&quot; loans that have contributed to the current crisis. During a 2008 House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the financial crisis, including in relation to the Community Reinvestment Act, when asked if the CRA provided the &quot;fuel&quot; for increasing subprime loans, former Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines said it might have been a catalyst encouraging bad behavior, but it was difficult to know. Raines also cited information that only a small percentage of risky loans originated as a result of the CRA.

In 2015, Federal Reserve Board economists Neil Bhutta and Daniel Ringo published a summary of available studies on the issue. They concluded that &quot;CRA-related loans were a small fraction of the subprime market during the mortgage boom&quot;, and hence it was not a significant contributor to the financial crisis.

<text>The British National Films Company was formed in England in 1934 by J. Arthur Rank, Lady Annie Henrietta Yule of Bricket Wood, and producer John Corfield.

==Origin==
Joseph Arthur Rank was a devout member of the Wesleyan Methodist Church and the son of a millionaire flour miller. On the first day of the week, he was a Sunday school teacher, and he discovered that if he screened religious films instead of lecturing his class, he got a positive response.

His idea spread to other classes held by other churches, and in 1933 this motivated Rank to form the Religious Film Society to distribute the films that he wanted to show to other Sunday schools.

Following distribution, Rank then decided to go into the business of producing religious films. &quot;Mastership&quot; was his first religious film production. It was a twenty-minute film made at Merton Park Studios at a cost of £2,700. &quot;Mastership&quot; was never shown commercially because it was merely intended as a form of evangelism and shown within other churches. Rank was pleased with the results, and other films went into production in Elstree at the better-equipped Rock Studios, which were later renamed British National.

==Press challenge==
In the 1930s, the &quot;Methodist Times&quot; newspaper in England began attacking the low moral standards exhibited by British films and by American films shown in Britain. In response, the London &quot;Evening News&quot; answered the &quot;Methodist Times&quot; by suggesting that if the Methodist Church was so concerned about the effect that the film industry was having upon family life in Britain, it should start producing its own family-friendly films. It was this exchange that motivated Rank to expand his film interests into the commercial market.

==Lady Yule==
A young producer named John Corfield introduced Rank to Lady Annie Henrietta Yule of Bricket Wood, who was both extremely wealthy and extremely bored with life. In order to fill her life with activity, she engaged in big game hunting and breeding Arabian horses with a degree of success and lasting fame; her Hanstead Stud won international recognition. She also commissioned luxury yachts, including the &quot;Nahlin&quot;, which she chartered in 1936 to the new king, Edward VIII. Upon meeting Rank, she decided to add the making of films to her list. However, when it came to the business side of film production, Lady Yule did not share the same ideas as Rank with regard to making and distributing films to improve society; she did not believe in giving discounts to religiously motivated film productions. She thought that films were an interesting hobby and similar to her financial interests in Arabian horse breeding.

==Formation of the company==
In 1934, Rank, Lady Yule and John Corfield formed the British National Films Company and went into production in answer to the challenge by the &quot;Evening News&quot;.

British National&#x27;s first feature film was &quot;Turn of the Tide&quot;, which was released in 1935. The script was based upon a 1932 novel by Leo Walmsley called &quot;Three Fevers&quot;. The setting, which Rank knew from childhood, was Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay on the north coast of Yorkshire, England. Having read the book, Rank decided that it would make an excellent family-friendly British film in answer to the Hollywood-style films that Alexander Korda was making at the Denham Film Studios.

Although &quot;Turn of the Tide&quot; featured a good cast, British National were unable to gain wide distribution for the film, and when they did, it was as the second half of a double feature. The company struggled to recoup its costs. Rank knew that for British National to make a profit, he had to create a commercial version of his Religious Film Society to control distribution and exhibition.

==Pinewood Film Studios==
In 1934, Charles Boot had undertaken to construct a new film studio in the village of Iver Heath in Buckinghamshire. His location was set among the pine trees on the estate grounds of a mansion called Heatherden Hall that Boot had recently bought at auction. The complex was named Pinewood Film Studios and was completed within a year. By 1935, Boot had approached British National about taking over ownership and management of the new studios, and a contract was entered into. Corfield eventually resigned from the board of Pinewood Film Studios, and Lady Yule sold her shares to Rank.

==Film distribution==
The problems that British National experienced in distributing &quot;Turn of the Tide&quot; were eventually solved by Rank.

<text>Four Horsemen Studios is a collectible figure design studio and manufacturer, specializing in creating sculptures of toys and action figures. The company was founded in the late 1990s as a contractor to Mattel, and have since grown to an independent studio creating their own lines of figures as well as manufacturing third party designs under license.

==History==
The current members and co-owners of Four Horsemen studios are Jim Preziosi, Eric Treadway, and H. Eric “Cornboy” Mayse. The three met while employed as figure sculptors at McFarlane Toys. In September 1999, the three left McFarlane to found Four Horsemen Studios along with former partner, Chris Dahlberg, where, in a partnership with Mattel, they created hundreds of figures for Mattel&#x27;s Masters of the Universe, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, Harry Potter, DC Universe Classics and &quot;Man of Steel&quot; toy lines, among others.

In 2005, Four Horsemen Studios began creating their own properties and designing and manufacturing the toys to support them. The studio has developed several in house properties including: Seventh Kingdom, Gothitropolis, Magma Corps, Symbiotech, and Mythic Legions

In early 2010, the Horsemen made the leap into licensed action figures. The studio signed a deal to produce figures based on the 1960s sci-fi toy line The Outer Space Men. A second license, 1980′s brand The Power Lords, was purchased in 2013.

===Original lines===
====Seventh Kingdom====

The first original line to make it into production, Seventh Kingdom&#x27;s Xetheus won the first Fantastic Exclusive competition in 2005.

====Magma CORPS====

Magma CORPS was the second original line to see actual product. A vinyl figure of Argus a leader within the Mercury City police force was created in 2006.

====Gothitropolis====

The third original line to actually be produced as figures, Gothitropolis includes Scarabus, the Time Keepers, and all the members of the Raven Flocks via two kickstarters.

====Symbiotech====

The fourth original line, Symbiotech has yet to see any actual production but has down quite well over the years in Fan Ex voting. The line was announced as the next to go into production but has since been put on hold while licensed lines take precedence.

Symbiotech designs that have been shown to the public suggest a humanoid and beast character in symbiosis with each other. Each design had two figures that could combine or interact.

====Mythic Legions====

Mythic Legions is a fantasy line of action figures from Four Horsemen Studios. &quot;The action figure line consists of an endless variety of characters ranging from heroic knights and dwarves to evil orcs and skeleton soldiers.&quot; The property started with a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2015 after the success of a campaign for Gothitropolis. Initially planned as a 1/18 scale line using the Glyos system of swappable parts, the line was changed to 1/12 scale, and the studio worked hard to maintain that interchangeability.

===Licensed Lines===
====The Outer Space Men====
Licensed from their original creator, Mel Birnkrant in 2010, The Outer Space Men take a new look at the 1968 action figure line by the Colorforms company. Using Mel&#x27;s designs and a new joint technology created by Onell Designs called Glyos, Four Horsemen Toy Design Studios produced a new line of figures with interchangeable parts.

====Power Lords====
The Power Lords license was acquired in 2012 and the first figures went into production in 2013. Working again with the original designer of a classic toy line (this time with Wayne Douglas Barlowe) and the Glyos joint system from Onell Design, Four Horsemen Toy Design Studios added to both giving us new characters and the expanded Glyos joint system.

===Work For Mattel===
====DC Comics Lines====

Mattel has commissioned Four Horsemen Studios for most if not all the figures in the DC Comics lines including Man of Steel, Dark Knight Rises. DC Universe Classics, and Young Justice.

====Masters of the Universe====

Four Horsemen Studios were responsible for the figure sculpts of the 200x re-imaging of Mattel&#x27;s Masters of the Universe toy line and helped bring about the Masters of the Universe Classics, an Adult Collectors figure line. They will continue to work for Mattel in the new 2015 Club 200X line.

====Thundercats====
4H Studios are currently sculpting all the figures for Mattel&#x27;s Thundercats line, which is being sold exclusively on Mattel&#x27;s direct-to-consumer site MattyCollector.com. The characters are in scale with Mattel&#x27;s Masters of the Universe Classics figures. Thundercats is licensed to Mattel by Warner Bros.

====Max Steel (Overseas Figures)====

Many of the Gigantor figures that were part of the Max Steel line in Europe and Latin America are sculpts by members of Four Horsemen Studios

===Work For Others===
====NECA====

NECA Four Horsemen Studios were contracted to sculpt the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles line in 2008.

====Toy Biz====

Several figures that were part of the Toy Biz Marvel Comics lines from 2001 to 2005 were sculpted by Four Horsemen Studios

===The Fan Ex Project===

In 2005 Four Horsemen Studios created a whole new way to interact with their fan base and let those fans participate in the design process called the Fantastic Exclusive Project, quickly shortened by the fan base to be called the Fan Ex Project. They started by giving the fans several original line names and brief descriptions than let the fans choose which one would be made into actual figures. Once the line was chosen fans would then decide which figure, then scale, articulation, accessories, and even repaints. The final choices would be combined into a figure and sold by the studio.

====Fan Ex 2005====

The Seventh Kingdom line was the winner of the first vote in the newly created Fan Ex. The character the fans chose was Xetheus, the Champion of Mynothecea, a Minotaur from the Animal Kingdom. There were 7 variations of the figure produced in very limited numbers. There were about 250 of each figure with Xetheus himself getting around twice that.

====Fan Ex 2006====

For the second year of voting Seventh Kingdom again and this time Ramathorr, Captain of the Anitherian Guard. Also from the Animal Kingdom Ramathorr was an Elephant and there were a total of nine figures offered. 4 Elephants, 2 Mutants, 1 Rhino, 1 Hippo and 1 Boar. Unfortunately production issues left many of the original figures with breakage issues. Four Horsemen Studios paid for a second production run to make sure fans ended up with quality product.

====Fan Ex 2007====

In the third year a new line won the first round of voting. Gothitropolis took the stage and the big bad of the story line, Scarabus. 10 figures would be released in this year but production issues (rising costs at the Chinese factories) pushed the actual sales of these figures to 2010. In between Four Horsemen Studios offered The Time Keepers, also from Gothitropolis 2008 and Queens court, 11 ladies representing 5 of the seven Kingdoms.

<text>Heinrich Boie (4 May 1794, Meldorf, Holstein – 4 September 1827, Bogor, West Java, Indonesia) was a German zoologist. He was the brother of Friedrich Boie. In the field of herpetology they described 49 new species of reptiles and several new species of amphibians.

Heinrich Boie studied law at Kiel and Göttingen. At university he became interested in natural history through the lectures of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and Friedrich Tiedemann. He was appointed Coenraad Jacob Temminck&#x27;s assistant at Leiden. In 1825, he travelled to Java with Salomon Müller in order to collect specimens for the museum. He died there of gall fever.

A species of Indian gecko, &quot;Cnemaspis boiei&quot;, is named in honor of Heinrich Boie or his brother Friedrich Boie.

<doc id="1044900" wikidata="Q464797" url="?curid=1044900" title="American Guild of Organists">
<text>The American Guild of Organists (AGO) is an international organization of academic, church, and concert organists in the US, headquartered in New York City with its administrative offices in the Interchurch Center. Founded as a professional educational association, it was chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York in 1896, with the authority to grant certificates of associate or fellow to members who passed examinations.

Membership is not limited to professional organists, but is open to anybody with an interest in organs and organ music. As of 2020, there are approximately 14,000 voting members in all categories of membership. The AGO&#x27;s current president is Eileen Hunt, elected in 2022.

The guild seeks to set and maintain high musical standards and to promote understanding and appreciation of all aspects of organ and choral music.

==Founders==
Among the 145 founding members of the guild were Benjamin Dwight Allen, John W. Bischoff, Dudley Buck, George Whitefield Chadwick, Kate Sara Chittenden, Charles Whitney Coombs, Gaston Dethier, Clarence Dickinson, Clarence Eddy, Mary Chappell Fisher, Arthur Foote, William Gilchrist, Henry Houseley Henry Holden Huss, Bruno Klein, Ernst R. Kroeger, Benjamin Johnson Lang, Peter C. Lutkin, Charlotte Wells Saenger, Fannie Morris Spencer, Samuel Prowse Warren (also served as President of the AGO in 1902), and Herve D. Wilkins. Clifford Demarest also played an important role in its first two decades.

==Organization==
The American Guild of Organists is geographically divided into seven regions and 298 chapters. The AGO has chapters in Australia (Sydney), Barbados, Hong Kong, Kenya (Nairobi), Finland (Helsinki), Singapore, Shanghai, and Taiwan. The European chapter is the oldest chapter outside of the US, with many members in France and Germany, as well as other countries.

The leadership of the AGO consists of a National Council, seven regional councillors forming a Board of Regional Councillors, and various local chapters within each region. The national headquarters is located at 475 Riverside Drive, Suite 1260, in New York, New York, in the Interchurch Center.

The National Council is the governing body of the American Guild of Organists. The four national officers, five national councillors with committees in portfolio, and the chair of the board of regional councillors (selected by the seven regional councillors from among their number) are members of the National Council. The executive director is a non-voting member of the National Council. The chaplain is an honorary member of the National Council.

The national officers of the guild consist of a president, a vice president/councillor of competitions and new music, a secretary/councillor for communications, and a treasurer/councillor for finance and development. National councillors coordinate and represent to the National Council specific areas of the work of the guild—education, membership, competitions and new music, conventions, young organists, and finance and development.

The regional councillors are elected by the members of the guild assigned to chapters within each of the seven regions. Regional councillors are responsible for supervision and coordination of the work of the guild in their regions and representation of the region on the National Council through the chair of the Board of Regional Councillors. The Board of Regional Councillors meets in person with the National Council once per year with voice, but no vote.

Appointed district conveners are responsible for the development of the guild&#x27;s interests in each state or area located within the region. The district convener assists the regional councillor in the work of the region.

In addition to district conveners, regional coordinators are appointed to assist the regional councillor and a national councillor in coordinating work of a specific portfolio area of the guild within the region, such as education, regional competitions for young organists, and professional development.

In 2014, the formerly nine regions were consolidated into seven:
* Northeast
* Mid-Atlantic
* Southeast
* Great Lakes
* North Central
* Southwest
* West

Over the years, a number of international chapters have been formed and are grouped into the following AGO regions:
* Northeast: 
** Europe, Finland
* Southeast: 
** Barbados, Nairobi
* West:
** Hong Kong, Sydney (Australia), Shanghai, Singapore, Taiwan

These international chapters formally affiliate with the AGO rather than other professional associations that may already exist in their country, such as the Royal Canadian College of Organists or Royal College of Organists (UK).

Eileen Hunt is currently president, elected in 2022 to a two-year term to succeed Michael Bedford (2016–2022). Other past presidents serving in the 21st century, and their terms in office, include John Walker (organist) (2014–2016), Eileen Guenther (2008–2014) and Frederick Swann (2002–2008).

==Programs and publications==

The organization holds national conventions in even-numbered years and regional conventions in odd-numbered years. The 2010 national convention held in Washington, D.C., on July 4–8, for example, included workshops and concerts at prominent Washington-area churches, with premieres of newly commissioned works. The 2014 national convention, attended by more than 1,700 members, featured several notable venues in the Boston area, including Memorial Church of Harvard University and Trinity Church. The 2020 national convention planned for July in Atlanta, Georgia, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The AGO sponsors a number of education programs, including &quot;Pipe Organ Encounters&quot;, which are intended to introduce youth to the organ and its workings. It also produces a series of instructional DVDs for organists, providing insights into advanced playing technique, organ registration, improvisation, and interpretation. Renowned organists on these &quot;Master Series&quot; videos are: Catharine Crozier (vol. 1), Marie-Claire Alain (vol. 2), Frederick Swann (vol. 3), Gerre Hancock (vol. 4), and Marilyn Mason (vol. 5).

The AGO issues several professional certificates and designations upon completion of the appropriate exams and membership in good standing: the &quot;Service Playing Certificate&quot; (SPC), &quot;Colleague&quot; (CAGO), &quot;Choir Master&quot; (ChM), &quot;Associateship&quot; (AAGO), and &quot;Fellowship&quot; (FAGO), the highest level of certification bestowed upon accomplished organists by the organization&#x27;s Board of Examiners.

==&quot;The American Organist&quot;==
Until November 1967, the journal &quot;The Diapason&quot; (published by Scranton-Gillette) was billed as the Official Journal of the American Guild of Organists, and the Official Magazine of the Royal Canadian College of Organists. In 1967, the AGO began publishing &quot;Music Magazine&quot;, a news journal for its membership. Now titled The American Organist, the monthly magazine is the official journal of the AGO for members and non-member subscribers. The illustrated periodical features news about new and restored pipe organs, concert programs, research into organ literature, chapter activities, and reviews of new organ recordings. &quot;The American Organist&quot; is also the official magazine for the Associated Pipe Organ Builders of America. Its masthead proclaims the journal&#x27;s goal, to further the AGO&#x27;s &quot;ideals, objectives, and cultural and educational aspirations&quot;. From October, 1968, to June, 2009, &quot;The American Organist&quot; was also the official journal of the Royal Canadian College of Organists. The AGO also is an affiliate with the online journal &quot;Vox Humana&quot;.

== Contests ==
The AGO organizes several awards and competitions, including the Pogorzelski-Yankee Competition, the AGO/ECS Publishing Award in Choral Composition, and the AGO/Marilyn Mason Award in Organ Composition.

The AGO/Marilyn Mason Award has its roots in the Holtkamp Organ Composition Contest, which was inaugurated in 1978 by Walter Holtkamp (president of the Holtkamp Organ Company) and Donald Hinshaw (president of Hinshaw Music) to encourage composers under 30 years of age. The Holtkamp Organ Composition was held annually until 1984 in conjunction with the International Contemporary Organ Music Festival at the Hartt School of Music. Winners of the Holtkamp Organ Composition Contest included:

* 1978: Thomas Crawford and Frank Wiley, co-winners; Steven Errante and Paul Hofreiter, honorable mentions
* 1979: Richard Campanelli, winner; Robert Sirota, honorable mention
* 1980: Thomas Crawford and Blair Sanderson, co-winners; Frank Wiley, honorable mention
* 1982: James Primosch

In 1984 the award was rebranded as the AGO/Holtkamp Award which awards a commission (and publication) for an organ work and a cash prize. It&#x27;s held every two years in conjunction with AGO&#x27;s national convention. In 2010 the award was rebranded as the AGO/Marilyn Mason Award to honor Marilyn Mason. Until 2016 the winning compositions were published by Hinshaw music; since then they have been published by H. T. FitzSimons. Winners include:

* 1984: Ingrid Arauco for What Seraphs Are Afoot

<doc id="1044901" wikidata="Q7997459" url="?curid=1044901" title="Who are the Most Beloved People?">
<text>Who are the Most Beloved People? () is the title of a famous essay about the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) in Korea written by Chinese journalist Wei Wei.

== Content ==
The essay revolves around the theme that the Chinese soldiers are the &quot;most beloved people&quot;. To illustrate this point, Wei Wei lists three examples of the soldiers&#x27; sacrifices. The first example describes the battle between the Chinese 38th Corps and the US 2nd Infantry Division at the Battle of the Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on River and how a company of soldiers sacrificed themselves during combat. The second example shows an artilleryman rescued a child in the aftermath of an air strike and volunteers for rifleman duty in order to avenge the aggressions against the Korean people. The third example records a conversation from a soldier and his selfless commitment towards the liberation of Korea. The essay ends with a reminder that the peace at home is not possible without the sacrifices from the &quot;most beloved people&quot;.

== Impacts ==
Described as smooth reading and moving, the essay became instantly popular in China after it was published on April 11, 1951, in the People&#x27;s Daily newspaper. The essay had also earned praises from the top Chinese leaders. Considered the most famous literary and propaganda piece produced by China during the Korean War, the essay succeed in elevating the soldiers&#x27; traditionally low social status within the Confucian culture, and helped to boost the recruitment of soldiers for the Korean War. In the decades following the essay&#x27;s publication, the phrase &quot;most beloved people&quot; has become synonymous with the PVA and PLA in mainland China, while the essay has become required reading in Chinese school curriculum.

<text>A flipper is a broad, flattened limb adapted for aquatic locomotion. It refers to the fully webbed, swimming appendages of aquatic vertebrates that are not fish.

In animals with two flippers, such as whales, the flipper refers solely to the forelimbs. In animals with four flippers, such as pinnipeds and sea turtles, one may distinguish fore- and hind-flippers, or pectoral flippers and pelvic flippers.

Animals with flippers include penguins (whose flippers are also called wings), cetaceans (e.g., dolphins and whales), pinnipeds (e.g., walruses, earless and eared seals), sirenians (e.g., manatees and dugongs), and marine reptiles such as the sea turtles and the now-extinct plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and metriorhynchids.

Usage of the terms &quot;fin&quot; and &quot;flipper&quot; is sometimes inconsistent, even in the scientific literature. However, the hydrodynamic control surfaces of fish are always referred to as &quot;fins&quot; and never &quot;flippers&quot;. Tetrapod limbs which have evolved into fin-like structures are usually (but not always) called &quot;flippers&quot; rather than fins. The dorsal structure on cetaceans is called the &quot;dorsal fin&quot; and the large cetacean tails are referred to primarily as flukes but occasionally as &quot;caudal fins&quot;; neither of these structures are flippers.

Some flippers are very efficient hydrofoils, analogous to wings (airfoils), used to propel and maneuver through the water with great speed and maneuverability (see Foil). Swimming appendages with the digits still apparent, as in the webbed forefeet of amphibious turtles and platypus, are considered &quot;paddles&quot; rather than flippers.

== Locomotion ==
For all species of aquatic vertebrates, swimming performance depends upon the animal&#x27;s control surfaces, which include flippers, flukes and fins. Flippers are used for different types of propulsion, control, and rotation. In cetaceans, they are primarily used for control while the fluke is used for propulsion.

The evolution of flippers in penguins was at the expense of their flying capabilities, in spite of evolving from an auk-like ancestor that could &#x27;fly&#x27; underwater as well in the air. Form constrains function, and the wings of diving flying species, such as the murre or cormorant have not developed into flippers. The flippers of penguins became thicker, denser and smaller while being modified for hydrodynamic properties.

=== Hydrodynamics ===
Cetacean flippers may be viewed as being analogous to modern engineered hydrofoils, which have hydrodynamic properties: lift coefficient, drag coefficient and efficiency. Flippers are one of the principal control surfaces of cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) due to their position in front of the center of mass, and their mobility which provides three degrees of freedom.

Flippers on humpback whales (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;) have non-smooth leading edges, yet demonstrate superior fluid dynamics to the characteristically smooth leading edges of artificial wings, turbines and other kinds of blades. The whale&#x27;s surprising dexterity is due primarily to its non-conventional flippers, which have large, irregular looking bumps called tubercles across their leading edges. The tubercles break up the passage of water, maintaining even channels of the fast-moving water, limiting turbulence and providing greater maneuverability.

The foreflippers used by the pinnipeds act as oscillatory hydrofoils. Both fore and hind flippers are used for turning. A 2007 study of Steller&#x27;s sea lion found that a majority of thrust was produced during the drive phase of the fore flipper stroke cycle. Although previous findings on eared seals suggested that thrust was generated by the initial outward movement of the fore flippers or the terminal drag-based paddling phase, the 2007 study found that little or no thrust was generated during those phases. Swimming performance in sea lions is modulated by changes in the duration and intensity of movements without changing their sequence. Using criteria based on velocity and the minimum radius of turns, pinnipeds&#x27; maneuverability is superior to cetaceans but inferior to many fish.

== Evolution of flippers ==
Marine mammals have evolved several times, developing similar flippers. The forelimbs of cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sirenians presents a classic example of convergent evolution. There is widespread convergence at the gene level. Distinct substitutions in common genes created various aquatic adaptations, most of which constitute parallel evolution because the substitutions in question are not unique to those animals.

When comparing cetaceans to pinnipeds to sirenians, 133 parallel amino acid substitutions occur. Comparing and contrasting cetaceans-pinnipeds, cetaceans-sirenians, and pinnipeds-sirenians, 2,351, 7,684, and 2,579 substitutions occur, respectively.

=== Digit processes ===

Whales and their relatives have a soft tissue flipper that encases most of the forelimb, and elongated digits with an increased number of phalanges. Hyperphalangy is an increase in the number of phalanges beyond the plesiomorphic mammal condition of three phalanges-per-digit. This trait is characteristic of secondarily aquatic vertebrates with flippers. Hyperphalangy was present among extinct ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs.

Cetaceans are the sole mammals to have evolved hyperphalangy. Though the flippers of modern cetaceans are not correctly described as webbed feet, the intermediate webbed limbs of ancient semiaquatic cetaceans may be described as such. The presence of interdigital webbing within the fossils of semi-aquatic Eocene cetaceans was probably the result of BMP antagonists counteracting interdigital apoptosis during embryonic limb development. Modifications to signals in these tissues likely contributed to the origin of an early form of hyperphalangy in fully aquatic cetaceans about 35 million years ago. The process continued over time, and a very derived form of hyperphalangy, with six or more phalanges per digit, evolved convergently in rorqual whales and oceanic dolphins, and was likely associated with another wave of signaling within the interdigital tissues.

Although toothed cetaceans have five digits, most baleen whales have four digits and even lack a metacarpal. In the latter (mysticetes), the first digit ray may have been lost as late as 14 million years ago.

=== Flipper evolution in turtles ===

Sea turtles evolved in the Cretaceous. Their flippers developed gradually by a series of stepwise adaptations, with the most fundamental traits of flippers appearing in the deepest nodes (the earliest times) in their phylogeny. These initial traits evolved only once among chelonioids, and the bauplan was refined through a secondary process of specialization.

Evers et al. identified characters related to the pectoral girdle and forelimb that are related to the modification of sea turtle arms and hands into flippers.

Key biomechanical features of flippers

* flattening of elements
* lengthening of the humerus
* reduction of mobility between individual flipper elements

Fundamental traits for flipper movement

* lateral position of the humeral process
* change in the angle of the internal scapula

== Foraging behavior ==
Because of the specialization of flippers and their hydrodynamic constraints, it was thought that they were not used to significantly interact with the environment, unlike the legs of terrestrial tetrapods. However, the use of limbs for foraging is documented in marine tetrapods. Use of the flippers for foraging behavior is observed in marine mammals such as walruses, seals, and manatee, and even in reptiles such as sea turtles. Among turtles, observed behaviors include a green turtle holding a jellyfish, a loggerhead rolling a scallop on the sea floor, and a hawksbill turtle pushing against a reef for leverage to rip an anemone loose. Based on presumed limb use in ancestral turtles, these behaviors may have occurred as long ago as 70 million years.

<text>Julian Heward Bell (4 February 1908 – 18 July 1937) was an English poet, and the son of Clive and Vanessa Bell (who was the elder sister of Virginia Woolf). The writer Quentin Bell was his younger brother and the writer and painter Angelica Garnett was his half-sister. His relationship with his mother is explored in Susan Sellers&#x27; novel &quot;Vanessa and Virginia&quot;.

==Background==
Julian Heward Bell was born in St Pancras, London, and was brought up at Charleston, Sussex. He was educated at Leighton Park School and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he joined the Cambridge Apostles. He was a friend of some of the Cambridge Five, including Anthony Blunt, to whom he lost his virginity. (In the BBC dramatisation &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; he appears as Blunt&#x27;s lover and Guy Burgess&#x27;s unrequited love interest). After graduating he worked towards a college fellowship, without success.

In 1935 he went to China, to a position teaching English at Wuhan University. He wrote letters describing his relationship with a married lover, K. - Ling Shuhua, the wife of Professor Chen Yuan (better known by his pen-name, Chen Xiying). The identity of &#x27;K&#x27; became a sensitive issue when the Chinese-British novelist Hong Ying published a fictionalised account, &quot;&quot; in 1999. After a 2002 ruling by a Chinese court, that the book was &#x27;defamation of the dead&#x27;, the author rewrote the book, which was published in 2003 under the title &quot;The English Lover&quot;.

Bell was initially a pacifist and edited an anthology of memoirs of conscientious objectors from the First World War, &quot;We Did Not Fight&quot;.

In 1937, Bell became increasingly supportive of the socialist and anti-fascist movements and decided to enlist in the Spanish Civil War. His parents and his aunt Virginia tried to dissuade him; eventually, they persuaded Julian to get a job as an ambulance driver on the Republican side, rather than a soldier. His motive for going to Spain was general sympathy for the cause of the Spanish Republic, plus &quot;the usefulness of war experience in the future and the prestige one would gain in literature and – even more – Left politics&quot;. After just a month in Spain he found himself in the thick of the action, driving an ambulance for the British Medical Unit attached to the International Brigades at the Battle of Brunete. He was hit by bomb fragments on a stretch of road just outside Villanueva de la Cañada, sustaining a massive lung wound, and later died in a military hospital at El Escorial. He was 29.

<text>Jean Baptiste Masse (c. 1700 – c. 1757) was a French composer and violoncello player.

He was an &quot;Ordinaire de la Chambre du Roi&quot; and a member of the King&#x27;s Bande of Twenty-Four Violins and of the orchestra of the &quot;Comédie Française&quot;.

Little is known of his life other than the publication dates of his first three volumes of sonatas and the appearance of his name on the payroll of the &quot;Comédie Française&quot; in 1752 as cellist and bass player.

According to Jules Bonnassies (&quot;La Musique à la Comédie Française (1774)&quot;) the same musicians were employed from 1752 until 1758 when Masse&#x27;s name no longer appears on the record; given these dates and the dedication of Book I of the sonatas it is probable that he was employed there between at least 1736 and 1757.

Masse published five volumes of sonatas. Book I (1736), dedicated to &quot;Messieurs les Comédiens Français&quot;, Book II (1739), dedicated to &quot;Monsieur Gaudion de le Grange Conseiller du Parlement&quot;, and Book V are for two cellos and basso continuo. Books III and IV are for two solo cellos without a figured bass. Masse indicates that they may be played by bassoons, viols or violins.

He also composed a &quot;Premier Suite de Menuets nouveaux à 2 violoncelles&quot;. The Masse sonatas are some of the first virtuoso pieces written for cello and basso continuo.

<text>The Inco Superstack in Sudbury, Ontario, with a height of , is the tallest chimney in Canada and the Western Hemisphere, and the second-tallest freestanding chimney in the world after the Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Station in Kazakhstan. It is also the second-tallest freestanding structure of any type in Canada, behind the CN Tower but ahead of First Canadian Place. As of 2023, it is the 51st-tallest freestanding structure in the world. The Superstack is located on top of the largest nickel smelting operation in the world at Vale&#x27;s Copper Cliff processing facility in the city of Greater Sudbury.

In 2018, Vale announced that the stack would be decommissioned and dismantled, beginning in 2020. Two new, smaller stacks were constructed under the company&#x27;s Clean Atmospheric Emissions Reduction Project. In July 2020, Vale announced that the Superstack had been officially taken out of service, but would remain operational in standby mode for two more months as a backup in the event of a malfunction in the new system, following which the dismantling of the Superstack would begin. Although some have called for the stack to be left in place as a tourist attraction, in September 2024, Vale announced an updated plan which will see the stack dismantled by 2029.

In addition to further reducing sulphur dioxide emissions by 85 per cent, the decommissioning of the stack was expected to cut the complex&#x27;s natural gas consumption in half.

==History==
The Superstack was built by Inco Limited (and later purchased by Vale) at an estimated cost of 25 million dollars. Construction on the structure was underway during the Sudbury tornado of August 20, 1970; the structure swayed heavily in the wind, but remained standing and suffered only minor damage. Six workers were on top of the construction platform when the storm hit, and all survived. The same day was the final day of construction on the stack, with the construction fully completed by the evening of August 21, 1970.

The stack entered into full operation in 1972. From the date of its completion until the Ekibastuz GRES-2 chimney was constructed in 1987, it was the world&#x27;s tallest smokestack. Between the years 1972–75 it was the tallest freestanding structure in Canada.
Prior to the construction of the Superstack, the waste gases contributed to severe local ecological damage. The Copper Cliff smelter was already home to some of the world&#x27;s tallest stacks, including two chimneys constructed in 1928-29 and 1936. However, these proved to be insufficient and compounded by open coke beds in the early to mid-20th century and logging for fuel, an inevitable near-total loss of native vegetation occurred. Of particular interest to geologists are the now exposed rocky outcrops, which have been permanently stained charcoal black, first by the pollution wafting over the decades from the roasting yards, then by the acid rain in a layer which penetrates up to three inches into the once pink-grey granite.

The Superstack was built to disperse sulphur gases and other byproducts of the smelting process away from the city of Sudbury. It did this by placing the gases high in the air, where they normally blew right past the city on the prevailing winds. As a result, these gases could be detected in the atmosphere around Greater Sudbury in a radius of the Inco plant. During the 1970s and 80s, the sulphur dioxide plume formed a permanent, opaque, cloud-like formation running across the entire horizon as seen from a distance. Periodic inversions would cause the plume to fall into the city.

Construction of the Superstack was followed by an environmental reclamation project which included rehabilitation of existing landscapes and selected water bodies such as Lake Ramsey. An ambitious regreening plan saw over three million new trees planted within the Greater Sudbury area. In 1992, Inco and the city were given an award by the United Nations in honour of their environmental rehabilitation programmes.

On November 3, 2014, Vale announced that they may decide to stop using the stack, following a $1 billion project to reduce emissions by 85% that negates the need for the stack. If no other use for it is found, Vale may decommission the superstack, demolish it, and replace it with a much smaller chimney. In 2017, Vale announced plans to decommission the Superstack upon the construction of two smaller, more energy efficient stacks. On July 28, 2020, Vale updated that news, stating that the stack at its Copper Cliff Complex had been taken out of service. It would remain on &quot;hot standby&quot; for about two months while the replacement flue connections were tested but the stack would then be demolished over the years.

==Emissions==

While the Superstack lowered the ground-level pollution in the city, it has dispersed sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide gases over a much larger area. Though not the single source of lake acidification, it appears the heavily industrialized Ohio Valley has contributed to the ecological problem of lakes as far north as northern Ontario. Research from data gleaned up to the late 1980s demonstrated acid rain to have affected the biology of some 7,000 lakes.

Prior to Vale&#x27;s purchase of Inco, a major construction effort by Inco in the early 1990s dramatically scrubbed waste gases before pumping them up the Superstack. These upgrades were completed in 1994 and emissions from then on have been much reduced. By comparison to the plume prior to installation, the plume now disperses quite rapidly and is often see-through even at the stack site.

Emissions reductions and increases in thermal efficiency have reached the point where natural draught is no longer sufficient to draw flue gas up the stack, necessitating the use of induced draught fans and/or reheating of the flue gas using natural gas burners.

As well as SO2 emissions, Inco&#x27;s Superstack has had very high arsenic, nickel and lead emissions to the atmosphere. In 1998, Inco emitted 146.7 tonnes of lead from Copper Cliff while producing 238,500 tonnes of nickel-copper matte. This is 150 times more lead emission than would be permitted by a US EPA-regulated lead smelter producing 238,500 tonnes of lead. As a result of the excessive lead emissions from the Inco Superstack, the surrounding community of Copper Cliff was found to have levels of lead in soil tests at a level sufficient to cause harm to young children.

<doc id="1044920" wikidata="Q1262619" url="?curid=1044920" title="White-throated hawk">
<text>The white-throated hawk (Buteo albigula) is a bird of prey in subfamily Buteoninae, the &quot;soaring&quot; hawks, of family Accipitridae. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The white-throated hawk has at various times been considered a dubious taxon, a subspecies of short-tailed hawk (&quot;B. brachyurus&quot;), or a sister species with the short-tailed. None of these treatments are currently (2022) accepted. The white-throated hawk is monotypic.

==Description==

The white-throated hawk is long with an wingspan. Females are up to 20% larger than males and both sexes have the same plumage. Adults have a brownish black face and upperparts. Their tail has a dark brown upper surface and a grayish lower surface with up to 10 narrow dark bands. Their chin, throat, and underparts are white with brown streaking on the breast and belly and rufous barring on the thighs. Their eye is brown and their cere, legs, and feet yellow. Juveniles are similar to adults but with heavy blackish streaking on the breast and flanks, streaked cheeks, and buff thighs with brown bars.

==Distribution and habitat==

The white-throated hawk is found in the Andes from northwestern Venezuela south through Colombia and Ecuador into Peru and Bolivia and in central Chile and western Argentina. It inhabits humid montane forest, elfin forest, cloudforest and adjacent open landscapes such as puna grassland. In the northern part of its range it is found at elevations between , in Patagonia between , and in Chile from near sea level to .

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The white-throated hawk is certainly migratory in the southern part of its range, moving north in the non-breeding season. Its behavior in its northern range is not well known. Some authors believe that all of the northern occurrences are by migrants from the south; others believe that at least in some northern areas they are year-round residents with some migrants from the south also present in the austral winter. The South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society lists it as a non-breeding visitor to Bolivia and Ecuador, hinting that it only passes through those countries in migration.

===Feeding===

The white-throated hawk&#x27;s hunting strategy has not been documented. Its diet has not been extensively studied but is known to include insects, rodents, and birds, the last as large as Magellanic woodpecker (&quot;Campephilus magellanicus&quot;).

===Breeding===

The white-throated hawk is known to breed only in Chile and Argentina, though there is limited evidence that it also breeds in parts of its northern range. Its breeding season spans from September at least to April. Pairs make undulating display flights. The nest is made of live and dead sticks and often is covered with lichen, and is placed above the ground. The clutch size is one or two eggs that are incubated mostly by the female. The incubation period is about one month and fledging occurs about 40 days after hatch. Males provision the female and young.

===Vocalization===

The white-throated hawk is thought to be mostly silent. It does make a &quot;squealing &#x27;kee-ah&#x27; during breeding season&quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the white-throated hawk as being of Least Concern. It has a fairly large range. The trend of its estimated population of 670 to 6700 mature individuals is not known. No immediate threats have been identified. In its known breeding range it is considered uncommon to fairly common but rare and local in much of its northern range. &quot;Preferred altitudinal range relatively less affected by human activities, especially transformation; also shows tolerance of disturbed habitat.&quot;

<doc id="1044926" wikidata="Q7669087" url="?curid=1044926" title="T4 (Channel 4)">
<text>T4 was a scheduling slot on Channel 4 (&quot;T4 Saturday&quot; usually 9 am until 2 pm) and E4 (&quot;T4 Sunday&quot; usually 9 am until 5 pm). It also aired on weekdays in the school holidays. The slot had a separate station identification on screen graphic from Channel 4 and E4. Channel 4 originally produced the strand in-house until 2002, when production was passed onto independent companies. The slot was targeted at the 16–24 age group.

Until 25 March 2012, &quot;T4&quot; aired on Channel 4 both Saturday and Sunday. To make way for the introduction of &quot;Sunday Brunch&quot; in March 2012, &quot;T4 Sunday&quot; was later moved to run on E4. &quot;T4 Saturday&quot; remained on Channel 4 and some programmes that previously appeared within the &quot;T4&quot; block, such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, remained on Channel 4 on Sunday afternoons.

On 12 October 2012, Channel 4 announced that it would be axing &quot;T4&quot; at the end of December 2012. The show ended on 29 December 2012.

==Early history==
Early on in &quot;T4&quot;″s run, programmes aimed at children often aired in addition to the content aimed at older viewers, with shows such as &quot;CatDog&quot; and &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot; appearing in the early schedule of the strand. Around 2001, this was dropped and the strand refocused entirely towards the teen/youth market. For the first few months of &quot;T4&quot;″s life, its idents consisted of an animated spaceman like character. In 1999, this character instead appeared on the idents during the early morning pre-school shows, in addition to the weekend children&#x27;s programmes that fell outside the &quot;T4&quot; strand. These idents continued in use until 2004.

===&quot;T4&quot; on E4, 2001===
After E4&#x27;s launch in 2001, &quot;T4&quot; initially also had a slot on the channel, however this was short lived. It also had an equally short lived Friday evening slot on Channel 4. Following the sale of &quot;Quiz Call&quot; by Channel 4, it was rumoured that a T4 channel was one of the proposals to fill the vacant slot on Freeview (and subsequently on satellite and cable). However, the plan is also thought to have been rejected by director of television Kevin Lygo, as the slot was filled by Film4 +1 (now replaced, in turn, by Channel 4 +1).

==Later years==
Initially broadcast only on Sundays, the success of &quot;T4&quot; saw the strand subsequently extended to include a Saturday block.

In more recent years, &quot;T4&quot; had provided Channel 4 a broadcast window of programmes that are also broadcast in primetime slots on E4, such as &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. In addition, following Channel 4&#x27;s acquisition of terrestrial broadcast rights to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the series began to feature regularly within &quot;T4&quot;. &quot;Friends&quot; featured regularly within &quot;T4&quot; until Channel 4 relinquished the rights to the sitcom in 2011.

Vernon Kay, Dermot O&#x27;Leary, Miquita Oliver and Alexa Chung returned for the last show on 29 December 2012 alongside current presenters Matt Edmondson, Nick Grimshaw, Jameela Jamil, Georgie Okell and Will Best.

==&quot;T4 on the Beach&quot;==

&quot;T4&quot; also staged an annual summer concert, &quot;T4 on the Beach&quot;, in the resort of Weston-super-Mare (for its first two years in 2003 and 2004, it was held in Great Yarmouth under the name &quot;Pop Beach&quot;), and previous musical acts that have appeared include McFly, Calvin Harris, Little Boots, and The Zutons. The concert in July 2010 was the sixth year running that the event had taken place in Weston-super-Mare which featured Dizzee Rascal and Florence and the Machine, among others. After the strand&#x27;s cancellation, there was going to be a replacement titled &quot;Summer Sets on the Beach&quot; which would air live on ITV2 on 31 August 2013, but it was axed due to a lack of ticket sales.

==&quot;T4 Stars Of...&quot;==
Normally bookended at the tail end of the year, the &quot;T4 Stars Of...&quot; concert was broadcast live from Earls Court. The event was first held in 2009 and since then had become an annual fixture in the &quot;T4&quot; events calendar. The &quot;Stars Of...&quot; title usually preceded the year in which it was being held e.g. &quot;Stars of 2010&quot;, as it was widely regarded as the replacement show for the now defunct &quot;Smash Hits Poll Winners Party&quot; that &quot;T4&quot; broadcast from 2001 to 2005.

<text>In organizational studies, resource management is the efficient and effective development of an organization&#x27;s resources when they are needed. Such resources may include the financial resources, inventory, human skills, production resources, or information technology (IT) and natural resources.

In the realm of project management, processes, techniques and philosophies as to the best approach for allocating resources have been developed. These include discussions on functional vs. cross-functional resource allocation as well as processes espoused by organizations like the Project Management Institute (PMI) through their Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) methodology of project management. Resource management is a key element to activity resource estimating and project human resource management. Both are essential components of a comprehensive project management plan to execute and monitor a project successfully. As is the case with the larger discipline of project management, there are resource management software tools available that automate and assist the process of resource allocation to projects and portfolio resource transparency including supply and demand of resources. 

== Corporate resource management process ==
Large organizations usually have a defined corporate resource management process which mainly guarantees that resources are never over-allocated across multiple projects. Peter Drucker wrote of the need to focus resources, abandoning less promising initiatives for every new project taken on, as fragmentation inhibits results.

== Techniques ==
One resource management technique is resource-leveling. It aims at smoothing the stock of resources on hand, reducing both excess inventories and shortages.

The required data are: the demands for various resources, forecast by period into the future as far as is reasonable, as well as the resources&#x27; configurations required in those demands, and the supply of the resources, again forecast by time into the future as far as is reasonable.

The goal is to achieve 100% utilization but that is very unlikely, when weighted by important metrics and subject to constraints, for example: meeting a minimum service level but otherwise minimizing cost. A Project Resource Allocation Matrix (PRAM) is maintained to visualize the resource allocations against various projects.

The principle is to invest in resources as stored capabilities, then unleash the capabilities as demanded.

A dimension of resource development is included in resource management by which investment in resources can be retained by a smaller additional investment to develop a new capability that is demanded, at a lower investment than disposing of the current resource and replacing it with another that has the demanded capability.

In conservation, resource management is a set of practices pertaining to maintaining natural systems integrity. Examples of this form of management are air resource management, soil conservation, forestry, wildlife management and water resource management. The broad term for this type of resource management is natural resource management (NRM).

<text>The common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) is a species of lizard with a large distribution in Europe and well-established introduced populations in North America, where it is also called the European wall lizard. It can grow to about in total length. The animal has shown variation in the places it has been introduced to. Fossils have been found in a cave in Greece dating to the early part of the Holocene.

==Description==

The common wall lizard is a small, thin lizard whose small scales are highly variable in colour and pattern. Its coloration is generally brownish or greyish, and may occasionally be tinged with green. In some individuals, the row of spots along their backs may form a line, while others may have a reticulated pattern with dark spots on the side and scattered white spots that can be blue in the shoulder region. The tail is brown, grey or rust in colour, and may also have light bars on the sides. The belly region has six rows of larger rectangular scales that are generally reddish, pink, or orangish. Common wall lizards may also have dark markings on the throat. This lizard has six distinct morphological forms which are identified by the colouration of its throat and underbelly. Three of these are pure morphs consisting only of solid colours on their scales: white, red (orange) or yellow, and three other morphs are distinguished by a combination of colours: white-yellow, white-red and yellow-red.

==Ecology==
The common wall lizard prefers rocky environments, including urban settings, where it can scurry between rock, rubble, debris and buildings. In the southern part of its range it tends to occur in humid or semi-humid habitats, compared to drier habitats in the north.

== Chemical communication ==
Common wall lizards rely both on visual and chemical signals to communicate with conspecifics. Male wall lizards are equipped with femoral glands, which produce a waxy secretion used for chemical signalling. Both the proteinic and lipophilic compounds in the secretions are known to carry socially relevant information.

==Polymorphism==

The six morphs of this lizard are primarily identifiable by colour and can be distinguished with the naked eye. However, they are commonly confirmed by digital photo and colour analysis. Source of colouration comes from different pigments within the lizard, with yellow colouration originating from carotenoids, and the expression of red/orange colour from pteridines. This is indicative that a phenomenon such as multiple alleles or epistasis may have a role in determining morphology. Morphs also differ in aspects other than colouration: differences between morphs are seen with femoral gland secretion, immune competence and body size. For males, colouration is visible on the underbelly, but in females of all the morphs there is less colouration seen in this region, indicating that sexual dimorphism occurs within this species. A study found sexual dimorphism in the digit ratios. Namely, they found a significant difference (after Bonferroni correction) of the 2D:4D ratio on both forepaws and the 2D:3D ratio on the left forepaw, with all ratios being larger in male animals. This study was conducted on a sample set of 18 male and 18 female museum specimens.

=== Variations between morphs ===
Aside from differences in colour, the morphs vary by length, survival rate, and immune resistance/response to infection.

Susceptibility to infection also varies between morphs, red and yellow-red morphs are the most susceptible to infection by the haemogregarine parasite, a common parasite for these lizards. White morphs are the most resistant to this parasite and the yellow morphs are at an intermediate value of immune resistance and intensity. Certain traits can also lead to a variation in snout-vent length in each of these morphs. For example, in orange morphs, sexual selection favours larger morphs which makes them, on average, larger than the other morphs.

The femoral gland secretions of males differ in chemical composition according to each respective morph. Secretions are used by males for intra-species communication, such as marking of territories and attracting potential mates. Individuals share the same organics within the secretions, but the concentrations of certain key compounds differ. For example, α-tocopherol is present in higher concentrations in the secretions of red morphs. This molecule allows for scents to remain in the environment longer by reducing the rate of oxidation in humid environments. This indicates that red morphs tend to be more territorial and maintain territories for longer periods of time compared to other morphs. This phenomenon is also seen when it comes to the age of lizards. Similarly, older, more territorial lizards have higher levels of α-tocopherol compared to younger individuals who are more prone to roaming regardless of morph. Again, indicating that the composition of the secretions relate to the function. Furanones are found in higher concentrations in white morphs, followed by yellow, then red morphs.

Among females, reproductive strategies differ by morph; yellow females are &quot;r&quot; strategists, producing many smaller eggs in their clutch which would allow for numerous offspring to be produced and proliferate in smaller populations with less competition. White females are &quot;K&quot; strategists, producing fewer, larger eggs which makes offspring more likely to survive in harsher, more competitive environments. Red females can be &quot;r&quot; or &quot;K&quot; strategists based on the environment they are in. The existence of alternate strategies points to how morphs have adapted to different environments and hints to the maintenance of colour polymorphism as with fluctuations in environments each morph will eventually be the fittest and as such will not be selected out of the population.

The differences observed between morphs are unique evolutionary trade offs employed by each morph to promote survival within the different environments they face in light of limited ability to adapt perfectly to each pressure. Such a trade off is seen when comparing orange morphs to white morphs: morphs, on average, have larger body sizes compared to the white morphs but, in exchange, they are more prone to parasitic infection. In orange morphs, more emphasis is placed on being larger and having the ability to physically compete and ward of potential threats, but in white morphs, metabolic emphasis is placed on having a more hardy immune system to resist infection. Again, these trade offs can arise as there are selective differences in the environment each morph prefers. The differences in the relative proportions of the morphs with respect to location show that environmental pressures differ and some morphs&#x27; trade offs are more successful in specific environments than another&#x27;s.

==Distribution and status==
The natural range spans much of the mainland Europe except from the north and very south and extends to Turkey. It occurs as introduced populations in southern Britain, where one such population in the seaside town of Ventnor on the Isle of Wight has become somewhat famous, and also in North America. There has been some scientific debate as to whether the populations in Southern England represent the northern edge of their native range. The population of common wall lizards in the mediterranean may have been caused by the hand of human activities such as pet releases and trade. 

===North America===
&quot;Podarcis muralis&quot; has been introduced in the United States and is spreading throughout the Cincinnati metropolitan area. It is commonly observed living in limestone outcrops, rock walls, and rubble along the Ohio River basin.

It is referred to locally in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area as the &quot;Lazarus lizard&quot;, as it was introduced to the area around 1950 by George Rau, a boy who was a member of the family who owned the Lazarus department store chain (now absorbed into Macy&#x27;s). After he returned from a family vacation to northern Italy, he released about 10 of the reptiles near his Cincinnati home. Genetic testing has revealed that as few as only three of these lizards survived long enough to reproduce, meaning they were subject to an extreme genetic bottleneck. This prolific lizard has reproduced exponentially; it continues to expand its distribution range annually, and has established itself so well in southwest Ohio, it is now considered a naturalized species by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and is protected under state law (it is illegal to harm, capture, or possess this animal without a proper licence).

Besides Ohio, &quot;P. muralis&quot; has also been introduced in other U.S. states. Populations occur in Kenton and Campbell counties in Kentucky, and in parts of Indiana. 

The European wall lizard was also introduced to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada in 1970, when a dozen individuals were released into the wild from a small private zoo.

<text>Fantavision is an animation program by Scott Anderson for the Apple II and published by Broderbund in 1985. Versions were released for the Apple IIGS (1987), Amiga (1988), and MS-DOS (1988).

Fantavision allows the creation of vector graphics animations using the mouse and keyboard. The user creates frames, and the software generates the frames between them. Because this is done in real-time, it allows for creative exploration and quick changes. The program uses a graphical user interface in the style of the Macintosh with pull-down menus and black text on a white background. 

Advertisements claimed Fantavision a revolutionary breakthrough that brings the animation features of &quot;tweening&quot; and &quot;transforming&quot; to home computers.

==Reception==
&quot;Compute!&quot; in 1989 called Fantavision the best animation program for the IBM PC, although it noted the inability to draw curves.

<text>Richard Edward Arnold (May 15, 1918 – May 8, 2008) was an American country music singer. He was a Nashville sound (country/popular music) innovator of the late 1950s, and scored 147 songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country music charts, second only to George Jones. He sold more than 85 million records. A member of the Grand Ole Opry (beginning 1943) and the Country Music Hall of Fame (beginning 1966), Arnold ranked 22nd on Country Music Television&#x27;s 2003 list of &quot;The 40 Greatest Men of Country Music.&quot;

== Early years ==
Arnold was born on May 15, 1918, on a farm near Henderson, Tennessee. His father, a sharecropper, played the fiddle, while his mother played guitar. Arnold&#x27;s father died when he was just 11, forcing him to leave school and begin helping on the family farm. This led to him later gaining his nickname, the Tennessee Plowboy. Arnold attended Pinson High School in Pinson, Tennessee, where he played guitar for school functions and events. He quit before graduation to help with the farm work, but continued performing, often arriving on a mule with his guitar hung on his back. Arnold also worked part-time as an assistant at a mortuary.
In 1934, at age 16, Arnold made his debut on WTJS-AM in Jackson, Tennessee. He began performing at local nightclubs and was hired permanently by WTJS in 1937. In 1938, he was hired by WMPS-AM in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was one of its most popular performers. He soon left WMPS for KWK-AM in St. Louis, Missouri, followed briefly by a spot at WHAS-AM in Louisville, Kentucky.

He performed for WSM (AM) on the Grand Ole Opry during 1943 as a solo artist. In 1944, Arnold signed a contract with RCA Victor, and with manager Colonel Tom Parker who would later manage Elvis Presley. Arnold&#x27;s first single was little noticed, but the next, &quot;Each Minute Seems a Million Years&quot;, scored number five on the country charts in 1945. Its success began a decade of unprecedented chart performance; Arnold&#x27;s next 57 singles all ranked in the top 10 in the US country charts, including 19 number-one successes.

In 1946, Arnold scored his first major success with &quot;That&#x27;s How Much I Love You&quot;. In 1948, he had five successful songs on the charts simultaneously. That year, he had nine songs in the top 10; five of these were number one and scored there for 40 of the year&#x27;s 52 weeks. With Parker&#x27;s management, Arnold continued to dominate, with 13 of the 20 best-scoring country music songs of 1947–1948. He became the host of Mutual Radio&#x27;s Purina-sponsored segment of the &quot;Opry&quot; and of Mutual&#x27;s &quot;Checkerboard Jamboree&quot;, a midday program shared with Ernest Tubb that was broadcast from a Nashville theater. Recorded radio programs increased Arnold&#x27;s popularity, as did the CBS Radio series &quot;Hometown Reunion&quot; with the Duke of Paducah. Arnold quit the Opry during 1948, and his &quot;Hometown Reunion&quot; briefly broadcast in competition with the Opry on Saturday nights. In 1949 and 1950, he performed in the Columbia movies &quot;Feudin&#x27; Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Hoedown.&quot;

Arnold began working for television in the early 1950s, hosting &quot;The Eddy Arnold Show&quot;. The summer program was broadcast successively by all three television networks, replacing the Perry Como and Dinah Shore programs. He also performed as a guest and a guest host on the ABC-TV show &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; from 1955 to 1960. Arnold featured in the syndicated &quot;Eddy Arnold Time&quot; from 1955 to 1957. From 1960 to 1961, he hosted NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Today on the Farm&quot;.

== Second career: The Nashville sound ==
With the rise of rock and roll in the mid 1950s, Arnold&#x27;s record sales began to decline, though fellow RCA Victor country recording artist Jim Reeves found a greater audience with popular-sounding string-laced arrangements. Arnold annoyed many in the country music establishment by recording with Hugo Winterhalter and his Orchestra at the RCA Victor Studios in New York. Winterhalter&#x27;s pop-oriented arrangements of &quot;The Cattle Call&quot; and &quot;The Richest Man (in the World)&quot;, however, helped to expand Arnold&#x27;s appeal beyond its country music base. This style, pioneered by Reeves and Arnold, became known as the &quot;Nashville Sound&quot;. During 1953, Arnold and Tom Parker had a dispute, and Arnold fired him. From 1954 to 1963, Arnold&#x27;s performances were managed by Joe Csida; in 1964, Csida was replaced by Jerry Purcell.

Arnold embarked on a second career that brought his music to a more diverse audience. In the summer of 1965, he had his first number-one country song in 10 years, &quot;What&#x27;s He Doing in My World&quot; and struck gold again six months later with the song that became his most well-known, &quot;Make the World Go Away&quot;, accompanied by pianist Floyd Cramer on piano and featuring the Anita Kerr Singers. As a result, Arnold&#x27;s rendition became an international success. &quot;Make The World Go Away&quot; became his only top ten pop hit.

Bill Walker&#x27;s orchestra arrangements provided the lush background for 16 continuous successes sung by Arnold in the late 1960s. Arnold performed with symphony orchestras in New York City, Las Vegas, and Hollywood. He performed in Carnegie Hall for two concerts, and in the Coconut Grove in Las Vegas. In 1966, Arnold was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, the youngest performer to receive the honor. The following year, Arnold was voted the first-ever awarded Country Music Association&#x27;s Entertainer of the Year. Two years later, he released an autobiography named &quot;It&#x27;s A Long Way From Chester County&quot;.

Having been with RCA Victor since 1944, Arnold left the label in 1973 for MGM Records, where he recorded four albums, which included several top-40 successes. He returned to RCA in 1976 and recorded for the company for the remainder of his career.

== Later years and death ==
During the 1980s, Arnold declared himself semi-retired, but he continued recording. In 1984, the Academy of Country Music awarded Arnold its Pioneer Award. His next album, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Miss A Thing&quot;, was not released until 1991. Arnold performed road tours for several more years. By 1992, he had sold nearly 85 million records, and had a total of 145 weeks of number-one songs, more than any other singer.

In 1996, RCA issued an album of Arnold&#x27;s main successes since 1944 as part of its &#x27;Essential&#x27; series. Arnold, then 78 years old, retired from active singing, though he still performed occasionally. On May 16, 1998, the day after his 80th birthday, he announced his final retirement during a concert at the Hotel Orleans in Las Vegas. That same year, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences inducted the recording of &quot;Make The World Go Away&quot; into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2000, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 2005, Arnold received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy, and later that year, released a final album for RCA titled &quot;After All These Years&quot;.

Arnold died from natural causes on May 8, 2008, in a care facility in Nashville, at age 89. His wife of 66 years, Sally Gayhart Arnold, had preceded him in death by two months. They are survived by two children (Richard E. Arnold, Jr., and JoAnn Arnold Pollard), two grandchildren (K. Michelle Pollard and R. Shannon Pollard, Jr.), and four great-grandchildren (Katie E. Pollard, Jack Pollard, Rowan Pollard, and Ben Johns).

On May 31, 2008, RCA released &quot;To Life&quot; as a single from the album &quot;After All These Years&quot;. It debuted at number 49 on the Hot Country Songs charts, Arnold&#x27;s first entry in 25 years and the recording by the oldest person to chart in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. It set the record for the longest span between a first chart single and a last: 62 years and 11 months (&quot;Each Minute Seems Like a Million Years&quot; debuted on June 30, 1945), and extended Arnold&#x27;s career chart history to seven decades.

<text>In bookkeeping, an account refers to assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and equity, as represented by individual ledger pages, to which changes in value are chronologically recorded with debit and credit entries. These entries, referred to as postings, become part of a &quot;book of final entry&quot; or ledger. Examples of common financial accounts are sales, accountsreceivable, mortgages, loans, PP&amp;E, common stock, sales, services, wages and payroll.

A chart of accounts provides a listing of all financial accounts used by particular business, organization, or government agency.

The system of recording, verifying, and reporting such information is called accounting. Practitioners of accounting are called accountants.

==Classification of accounts==
===Based on nature===
An account may be classified as real, personal or as a nominal account.
Example: A sales account is opened for recording the sales of goods or services and at the end of the financial period the total sales are transferred to the revenue statement account (Profit and Loss Account or Income and Expenditure Account).

Similarly expenses during the financial period are recorded using the respective Expense accounts, which are also transferred to the revenue statement account. The net positive or negative balance (profit or loss) of the revenue statement account is transferred to reserves or capital account as the case may be.

===Based on periodicity of flow===
The classification of accounts into real, personal and nominal is based on their nature i.e. physical asset, liability, juristic entity or financial transaction.

The further classification of accounts is based on the periodicity of their inflows or outflows in the context of the fiscal year:
* Income is a short term inflow during the fiscal year.
* Expense is short term outflow during the fiscal year.
* An asset is a long term inflow with implications extending beyond the financial period and by the traditional view could represent unclaimed income. Alternatively, an asset could be valued at the present value of its future inflows.
* Liability is a long term outflow with implications extending beyond the financial period and by the traditional view could represent unamortised expense. Alternatively, a liability could be valued at the present value of future outflows.

Items in accounts are classified into five broad groups, also known as the &quot;elements&quot; of the accounts:
* Asset, Liability, Equity, Revenue, Expense

The classification of equity as a distinctive element for classification of accounts is disputable on account of the &quot;entity concept&quot;, since for the objective analysis of the financial results of any entity the external liabilities of the entity should not be distinguished from any contribution by the shareholders.

<doc id="1044956" wikidata="Q256121" url="?curid=1044956" title="Romanian Communist Party">
<text>The Romanian Communist Party ( ; PCR) was a communist party in Romania. The successor to the pro-Bolshevik wing of the Socialist Party of Romania, it gave an ideological endorsement to a communist revolution that would replace the social system of the Kingdom of Romania. After being outlawed in 1924, the PCR remained a minor and illegal grouping for much of the interwar period and submitted to direct Comintern control. During the 1920s and the 1930s, most of its activists were imprisoned or took refuge in the Soviet Union, which led to the creation of competing factions that sometimes came into open conflict. That did not prevent the party from participating in the political life of the country through various front organizations, most notably the Peasant Workers&#x27; Bloc. In 1934–1936, PCR reformed itself in the mainland of Romania properly, with foreign observers predicting a possible communist takeover in Romania. The party emerged as a powerful actor on the Romanian political scene in August 1944, when it became involved in the royal coup that toppled the pro-Nazi government of Ion Antonescu. With support from Soviet occupational forces, the PCR pressured King Michael I into abdicating, and it established the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic in December 1947.

The party operated as the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Partidul Muncitoresc Romîn&quot; between 1948 and 1964 and &quot;Partidul Muncitoresc Român&quot; in 1964 and 1965) until it was officially renamed by Nicolae Ceaușescu, who had just been elected secretary general. Other legal, political parties existed in Romania, but their influence was limited and they were subordinate to the constitutionally-authorised leading role of the PCR. All other legal parties and entities were part of the Communist-dominated National Front. The PCR was a communist party, organized based on democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin, which entails a democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed-upon policies. The highest body within the PCR was the Party Congress, which began in 1969 to convene every five years. The Central Committee was the highest body when Congress was not in session. Because the Central Committee met only twice a year, most day-to-day duties and responsibilities were vested in Politburo. The party leader held the office of General Secretary and, after 1945, held significant influence over the government. Between 1974 and 1989, the General Secretary also held the office of President of Romania.

Ideologically, the PCR was committed to Marxism–Leninism, a fusion of the original ideas of German philosopher and economic theorist Karl Marx, and Lenin, was introduced in 1929 by the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, as the party&#x27;s guiding ideology and would remain so through much of its existence. In 1948, the Communist Party absorbed the Romanian Social Democratic Party and attracted various new members. In the early 1950s, the group around Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, with support from Stalin, defeated all other factions and achieved full control over the party and country. After 1953, the party gradually theorized a &quot;national path&quot; to communism. At the same time, however, the party delayed the time to join its Warsaw Pact brethren in de-Stalinization. The PCR&#x27;s nationalist and national communist stance was continued under the leadership of Nicolae Ceaușescu. Following an episode of liberalization in the late 1960s, Ceaușescu again adopted a hard line by imposing the &quot;July Theses&quot;, re-Stalinizing the party&#x27;s rule by intensifying the spreading of communist ideology in Romanian society and at the same time consolidating his grip on power whilst using the Party&#x27;s authority to brew a persuasive cult of personality. Over the years, the PCR massively increased to become entirely submitted to Ceaușescu&#x27;s will. From the 1960s onward, it had a reputation for being far more independent of the Soviet Union than its brethren in the Warsaw Pact. However, it also became the most hardline party in the Eastern Bloc, which harmed its relationship with even the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It collapsed in 1989 in the wake of the Romanian Revolution, but Romania kept its socialist-era constitution until 1991. Romania also retained its membership in the Warsaw Pact until its dissolution on 1 July 1991; that role had been largely symbolic since the late 1960s.

The PCR co-ordinated several organizations during its existence, including the Union of Communist Youth, and organized training for its cadres at the Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy (future SNSPA). In addition to &quot;Scînteia&quot;, its official platform and main newspaper between 1931 and 1989, the party issued several local and national publications at various points in its history (including, after 1944, &quot;România Liberă&quot;).

==History==
===Establishment===


The party was founded in 1921 when the Bolshevik-inspired maximalist faction won control of Romania&#x27;s Social-Democratic party—the Socialist Party of Romania, successor to the defunct Romanian Social-Democratic Workers&#x27; Party and the short-lived Social Democratic Party of Romania (the latter was refounded in 1927, reuniting those opposed to communist policies). The establishment was linked with the socialist group&#x27;s affiliation to the Comintern (just before the latter&#x27;s Third Congress): after a delegation was sent to Bolshevist Russia, a group of moderates (including Ioan Flueraș, Iosif Jumanca, Leon Ghelerter, and Constantin Popovici) left at different intervals beginning with January 1921.

The party renamed itself the Socialist-Communist Party () and, soon after, the Communist Party of Romania ( or &quot;PCdR&quot;). Government crackdown and competition with other socialist groups brought a drastic reduction in its membership—from the ca. 40,000 members the Socialist Party had, the new group was left with as much as 2,000 or as little as 500; after the fall of one-party rule in 1989, Romanian historians generally asserted that the party only had around 1,000 members at the end of World War II. Other researchers argue that this figure may have been intentionally based on the Muscovite faction figures and, as such, underestimated to undermine the influence of the internal faction; this estimate was afterwards promoted in post-communist historiography to reinforce a stereotypical image of the regime as illegitimate.

The early Communist Party had little influence in Romania. This was due to a number of factors: the country&#x27;s lack of industrial development, which resulted in a relatively small working class (with industry and mining employing fewer than 10% of the active population) and a large peasant population; the minor impact of Marxism among Romanian intellectuals; the success of state repression in driving the party underground and limiting its activities; and finally, the party&#x27;s &quot;anti-national&quot; policy, as it began to be stated in the 1920s—supervised by the Comintern, this policy called for the breakup of Greater Romania, which was regarded as a colonial entity &quot;illegally occupying&quot; Transylvania, Dobruja, Bessarabia and Bukovina (regions that, the communists argued, had been denied the right of self-determination). In 1924, the Comintern provoked Romanian authorities by encouraging the Tatarbunary Uprising in southern Bessarabia, in an attempt to create a Moldavian republic on Romanian territory; also in that year, a Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, roughly corresponding to Transnistria, was established inside the Soviet Union.

At the same time, the left-wing political spectrum was dominated by Poporanism, an original ideology which partly reflected Narodnik influence, placed its focus on the peasantry (as it notably did with the early advocacy of cooperative farming by Ion Mihalache&#x27;s Peasants&#x27; Party), and usually strongly supported the post-1919 territorial status quo—although they tended to oppose the centralized system it had come to imply. (In turn, the early conflict between the PCdR and other minor socialist groups has been attributed to the legacy of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&#x27;s quasi-Poporanist ideas inside the latter, as an intellectual basis for the rejection of Leninism.)

The PCdR&#x27;s &quot;foreign&quot; image was because ethnic Romanians were a minority in its ranks until after the end of World War II: between 1924 and 1944, none of its general secretaries was of Romanian ethnicity. Interwar Romania had a minority population of 30%, and it was largely from this section that the party drew its membership—a large percentage of it was Jews, Hungarians and Bulgarians. Actual or perceived ethnic discrimination against these minorities added to the appeal of revolutionary ideas in their midst.

===Communist Party of Romania (1921–1948)===
====Comintern and internal wing====
Shortly after its creation, the PCdR&#x27;s leadership was alleged by authorities to have been involved in Max Goldstein&#x27;s bomb attack on the Parliament of Romania; all major party figures, including the general secretary Gheorghe Cristescu, were prosecuted in the Dealul Spirii Trial. Constantin Argetoianu, the Minister of the Interior in the Alexandru Averescu, Take Ionescu, and Ion I. C. Brătianu cabinets, equated Comintern membership with conspiracy, ordered the first in a series of repressions, and, in the context of trial, allowed for several communist activists (including Leonte Filipescu) to be shot while in custody—alleging that they had attempted to flee. Consequently, Argetoianu stated his belief that&quot;communism is over in Romania&quot;, which allowed for a momentary relaxing of pressures—begun by King Ferdinand&#x27;s granting of an amnesty to the tried PCdR.

The PCdR was thus unable to send representatives to the Comintern, and was virtually replaced abroad by a delegation of various activists who had fled to the Soviet Union at various intervals (Romanian groups in Moscow and Kharkiv, the sources of a &quot;Muscovite wing&quot; in the following decades). The interior party only survived as an underground group after it was outlawed by the Brătianu government through the &quot;Mârzescu Law&quot; (named after its proponent, Minister of Justice Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu), passed in early 1924; Comintern sources indicate that, around 1928, it was losing contact with Soviet overseers. In 1925, the question of Romania&#x27;s borders as posed by the Comintern led to protests by Cristescu and, eventually, to his exclusion from the party (&quot;see Balkan Communist Federation&quot;).

Around the time of the party&#x27;s Fifth Congress in 1931, the Muscovite wing became the PCdR&#x27;s main political factor: Joseph Stalin replaced the entire party leadership, including the general secretary Vitali Holostenco—appointing instead Alexander Stefanski, who was at the time a member of the Communist Party of Poland.

The interior wing began organizing itself as a more efficient conspiratorial network through regained Comintern control. The onset of the Great Depression in Romania, and the series of strikes infiltrated (and sometimes provoked) by the interior wing signified relative successes (&quot;see Lupeni Strike of 1929&quot;), but gains were not capitalized—as lack of ideological appeal and suspicion of Stalinist directives remained notable factors. In parallel, its leadership suffered changes that were meant to place it under an ethnic Romanian and working-class leadership—the emergence of a Stalin-backed group around Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej before and after the large-scale Grivița Strikes.

In 1934, Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Popular Front&quot; doctrine was not fully passed into the local party&#x27;s politics, mainly due to the Soviet territorial policies (culminating in the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) and the widespread suspicion other left-wing forces maintained toward the Comintern. The Communists did, nevertheless, attempt to reach consensus with other groupings on several occasions (in 1934–1943, they established alliances with the Ploughmen&#x27;s Front, the Hungarian People&#x27;s Union, and the Socialist Peasants&#x27; Party), and small Communist groups became active in the leftist sections of mainstream parties. In 1934, Petre Constantinescu-Iași and other PCdR supporters created &quot;Amicii URSS&quot;, a pro-Soviet group reaching out to intellectuals, itself banned later in the same year.

During the 1937 elections, the Communists backed Iuliu Maniu and the National Peasants&#x27; Party against King Carol II and the Gheorghe Tătărescu government (who had intensified repression of Communist groups), finding themselves placed in an unusual position after the Iron Guard, a fascist movement, signed an electoral pact with Maniu; participation in the move was explained by Communist historiography as provoked by the Social-Democrats&#x27; refusal to collaborate with the PCdR.

In the years following the elections, the PCdR entered a phase of rapid decline, coinciding with the increasingly authoritarian tone of King Carol&#x27;s regime (but in fact inaugurated by the 1936 Craiova Trial of Ana Pauker and other high-ranking Communists). Journals viewed as associates of the party were closed down, and all suspected PCdR activists faced detention (&quot;see Doftana Prison&quot;). Siguranța Statului, the Romanian secret police, infiltrated the small interior wing and probably obtained valuable information about its activities. The financial resources of the party, ensured by Soviet support and by various satellite organizations (collecting funds in the name of causes such as pacifism or support for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War), were severely drained—by political difficulties at home, as well as, after 1939, by the severing of connections with Moscow in France and Czechoslovakia.

Consequently, the executive committee of the Comintern called on Romanian Communists to infiltrate the National Renaissance Front (FRN), the newly created sole legal party of Carol&#x27;s dictatorship, and attempt to attract members of its structures to the revolutionary cause.

Until 1944, the group active inside Romania became split between the &quot;prison faction&quot; (political prisoners who looked to Gheorghiu-Dej as their leader) and the one around Ștefan Foriș and Remus Koffler. The exterior faction of the party was decimated during the Great Purge: an entire generation of party activists was killed on Stalin&#x27;s orders, including, among others, Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea, David Fabian, Ecaterina Arbore, Imre Aladar, Elena Filipescu, Dumitru Grofu, Ion Dic Dicescu, Eugen Rozvan, Marcel Pauker, Alexander Stefanski, Timotei Marin, and Elek Köblös. It was to be Ana Pauker&#x27;s mission to take over and reshape the surviving structure.

====World War II====
In 1940, Romania had to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union and Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria (&quot;see Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, Treaty of Craiova&quot;); in contrast with the general mood, the PCdR welcomed both gestures along the lines of its earlier activism. Official history, after ca. 1950, stated that the PCdR protested Northern Transylvania&#x27;s cession to Hungary later in the same year (the Second Vienna Arbitration), but evidence is inconclusive (party documents attesting the policy are dated after Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union). As the border changes sparked a political crisis leading to an Iron Guard takeover—the National Legionary State—the interior wing&#x27;s confusion intensified: the upper echelon faced investigation from Georgi Dimitrov (as well as other Comintern officials) on charges of &quot;Trotskyism&quot;, and, since the FRN had crumbled, several low-ranking party officials actually began collaborating with the new regime. At around the same time, a small section of the exterior wing remained active in France, where it eventually joined the Resistance to German occupation—it included Gheorghe Gaston Marin and the &quot;Francs-tireurs&quot;&#x27; Olga Bancic, Nicolae Cristea and Joseph Boczov.

As Romania came under the rule of Ion Antonescu and, as an Axis country, joined in the German offensive against the Soviets, the Communist Party began approaching traditional parties that were engaged in semi-clandestine opposition to Antonescu: alongside the Social Democrats, it began talks with the National Peasants&#x27; and the National Liberal parties. At the time, virtually all the interior leadership was imprisoned at various locations (most of them interned at Caransebeș or in a concentration camp near Târgu Jiu). Some communists, such as Petre Gheorghe, Filimon Sârbu, Francisc Panet or Ștefan Plavăț, tried to establish organised resistance groups; however, they were quickly captured by the Romanian authorities and executed, as were some of the more active propagandists, such as Pompiliu Ștefu. A statistic of the &quot;Siguranţa&quot; reports that, in Bucharest, between January 1941 and September 1942, 143 individuals were tried for communism, of which 19 were sentenced to death and 78 to prison terms or forced labour. The antisemitic Antonescu regime established a distinction between PCdR members of Jewish Romanian origin and those of ethnic Romanian or other heritage, deporting the majority of the former, alongside Romanian and Bessarabian Jews in general, to camps, prisons and makeshift ghettos in occupied Transnistria (&quot;see Holocaust in Romania&quot;). Most Jews from the PCdR category were held in Vapniarka, where improper feeding caused an outbreak of paralysis, and in Rîbnița, where some 50 were victims of the authorities&#x27; criminal negligence and were shot by retreating German troops in March 1944.

In June 1943, at a time when troops were suffering major defeats on the Eastern Front, the PCdR proposed that all parties form a &quot;Blocul Național Democrat&quot; (&quot;National Democratic Bloc&quot;), in order to arrange for Romania to withdraw from its alliance with Nazi Germany. The ensuing talks were prolonged by various factors, most notably by the opposition of National Peasants&#x27; Party leader Iuliu Maniu, who, alarmed by Soviet successes, was trying to reach a satisfactory compromise with the Western Allies (and, together with the National Liberals&#x27; leader Dinu Brătianu, continued to back negotiations initiated by Antonescu and Barbu Știrbey with the United States and the United Kingdom).

====1944 Coup====
In early 1944, as the Red Army reached and crossed the Prut River during the Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, the self-confidence and status gained by the PCdR made possible the creation of the Bloc, which was designed as the basis of a future anti-Axis government. Parallel contacts were established, through Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu and Emil Bodnăraș, between the PCdR, the Soviets, and King Michael. A seminal event also occurred during those months: Ștefan Foriș, who was still general secretary, was deposed by with Soviet approval by the rival &quot;prison faction&quot;(at the time, it was headed by former inmates of Caransebeș prison); replaced with the troika formed by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Constantin Pîrvulescu, and Iosif Rangheț, Foriș was discreetly assassinated in 1946. Several assessments view Foriș&#x27;s dismissal as the complete rupture in historical continuity between the PCdR established in 1921 and what became the ruling party of Communist Romania.

On 23 August 1944, King Michael, a number of Romanian Armed Forces officers, and armed Communist-led civilians supported by the National Democratic Bloc arrested dictator Ion Antonescu and seized control of the state (&quot;see King Michael&#x27;s Coup&quot;). King Michael then proclaimed the old 1923 Constitution in force, ordered the Romanian Army to enter a ceasefire with the Red Army on the Moldavian front, and withdrew Romania from the Axis. Later party discourse tended to dismiss the importance of both the Soviet offensive and the dialogue with other forces (and eventually described the coup as a revolt with large popular support).

The King named General Constantin Sănătescu as prime minister of a coalition government which was dominated by the military, but included one representative each from the National Liberal Party, National Peasants&#x27; Party and Social Democratic Party, with Pătrășcanu as Minister of Justice—the first Communist to hold high office in Romania. The Red Army entered Bucharest on 31 August, and thereafter played a crucial role in supporting the Communist Party&#x27;s rise to power as the Soviet military command virtually ruled the city and the country (&quot;see Soviet occupation of Romania&quot;).

====In opposition to Sănătescu and Rădescu====

After having been underground for two decades, the Communists enjoyed little popular support at first, compared to the other opposition parties (however, the decrease in popularity of the National Liberals was reflected in the forming of a splinter group around Gheorghe Tătărescu, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, who later entered an alliance with the Communist Party). Soon after 23 August, the Communists also engaged in a campaign against Romania&#x27;s main political group of the time, the National Peasants&#x27; Party, and its leaders Iuliu Maniu and Ion Mihalache. In Victor Frunză&#x27;s account, the conflict&#x27;s first stage was centered on Communist allegations that Maniu had encouraged violence against the Hungarian community in newly recovered Northern Transylvania.

The Communist Party, engaged in a massive recruitment campaign, was able to attract ethnic Romanians in large numbers—workers and intellectuals alike, including some former members of the fascist Iron Guard. By 1947, it grew to around 710,000 members. Although the PCR was still highly disorganized and factionalized, it benefited from Soviet backing (including that of Vladislav Petrovich Vinogradov and other Soviet appointees to the Allied Commission). After 1944, it was leading a paramilitary wing, the Patriotic Defense (&quot;Apărarea Patriotică&quot;, disbanded in 1948), and a cultural society, the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union.

On PCdR initiative, the National Democratic Bloc was dissolved on 8 October 1944; instead, the Communists, Social Democrats, the Ploughmen&#x27;s Front, Mihai Ralea&#x27;s Socialist Peasants&#x27; Party (which was absorbed by the former in November), the Hungarian People&#x27;s Union (MADOSZ), and Mitiţă Constantinescu&#x27;s Union of Patriots formed the National Democratic Front (FND), which campaigned against the government, demanding the appointment of more Communist officials and sympathizers, while claiming democratic legitimacy and alleging that Sănătescu had dictatorial ambitions. The FND was soon joined by the Liberal group around Tătărescu, Nicolae L. Lupu&#x27;s &quot;Democratic Peasants&#x27; Party&quot; (the latter claimed the legacy from the defunct Peasants&#x27; Party), and Anton Alexandrescu&#x27;s faction (separated from the National Peasants&#x27; Party).

Sănătescu resigned in November, but was persuaded by King Michael to form a second government which collapsed within weeks. General Nicolae Rădescu was asked to form a government and appointed Teohari Georgescu to the Ministry of the Interior, which allowed for the introduction of Communists into the security forces. The Communist Party subsequently launched a campaign against the Rădescu government, including the mass demonstration of 24 February that resulted in four deaths among the participants. According to Frunză, this culminated in a 13 February 1945 demonstration outside the Royal Palace, and followed a week later by street fighting between Georgescu&#x27;s Communist forces and supporters of the National Peasants&#x27; Party in Bucharest. In a period of escalating chaos, Rădescu called for elections. The Soviet deputy foreign minister Andrey Vyshinsky went to Bucharest to request the monarch that he appoint Communist sympathizer Petru Groza as Prime Minister, with the Soviet government suggesting it would reinstate Romanian sovereignty over Northern Transylvania only in such a scenario. Frunză claimed however that Vyshinsky also intimated a Soviet takeover of the country if the King failed to comply, and that, under pressure from Soviet troops who were supposedly disarming the Romanian military and occupying key installations, Michael agreed and dismissed Rădescu, who fled the country.

====First Groza cabinet====

On 6 March, Groza became leader of a Communist-led government and named Communists to lead the Romanian Armed Forces as well as the ministries of the Interior (Georgescu), Justice (Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu), Communications (Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej), Propaganda (Petre Constantinescu-Iaşi) and Finance (Vasile Luca). The non-Communist ministers came from the Social Democrats (who were falling under the control of the pro-Communists Lothar Rădăceanu and Ștefan Voitec) and the traditional Ploughmen&#x27;s Front ally, as well as, nominally, from the National Peasants&#x27; and National Liberal parties (followers of Tătărescu and Alexandrescu&#x27;s dissident wings).

As a result of the Potsdam Conference, where Western Allied governments refused to recognize Groza&#x27;s administration, King Michael called on Groza to resign. When he refused, the monarch went to his summer home in Sinaia and refused to sign any government decrees or bills (a period colloquially known as &quot;greva regală&quot;—&quot;the royal strike&quot;). Following Anglo-American mediation, Groza agreed to include politicians from outside his electoral alliance, appointing two secondary figures in their parties (the National Liberal Mihail Romniceanu and the National Peasants&#x27; Emil Hațieganu) as Ministers without Portfolio (January 1946). At the time, Groza&#x27;s party and the PCR came to disagree on some issues (with the Front publicly affirming its support for private land ownership), before the Ploughmen&#x27;s Front was eventually pressured into supporting Communist tenets.

In the meantime, the first measure taken by the cabinet was a new land reform that advertised, among others, an interest into peasant issues and a respect for property (in front of common fears that a Leninist program was about to be adopted). According to Frunză, although contrasted by the Communist press with its previous equivalent, the measure was supposedly much less relevant—land awarded to individual farmers in 1923 was more than three times the 1945 figures, and all effects were canceled by the 1948–1962 collectivization.

It was also then that, through Pătrășcanu and Alexandru Drăghici, the Communists consecrated their control of the legal system—the process included the creation of the Romanian People&#x27;s Tribunals, charged with investigating war crimes, and constantly supported by agitprop in the Communist press. During the period, government-backed Communists used various means to exercising influence over the vast majority of the press, and began infiltrating or competing with independent cultural forums. Economic dominance, partly responding to Soviet requirements, was first effected through the SovRoms (created in the summer of 1945), directing the bulk of Romanian trade towards the Soviet Union.

====1945 restructuring and second Groza cabinet====

The Communist Party held its first open conference (16–22 October 1945, at the Mihai Viteazul High School in Bucharest) and agreed to replace the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej–Constantin Pîrvulescu–Iosif Rangheț troika with a joint leadership reflecting an uneasy balance between the external and internal wings: while Gheorghiu-Dej retained his general secretary position, Ana Pauker, Teohari Georgescu, and Vasile Luca became the other main leaders.

The Central Committee had 27 full members
*Gheorghe Apostol
*Emil Bodnăraș
*Constantin Câmpeanu
*Nicolae Ceaușescu
*Iosif Chișinevschi
*Miron Constantinescu – Politburo member
*Dumitru Coliu
*Constanța Crăciun
*Teohari Georgescu – Politburo member, Secretary
*Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej – Politburo member, Secretary
*Vasile Luca – Politburo member, Secretary
*Gheorghe Maurer
*Alexandru Moghioroș
*Andrei Neagu
*Constantin Pârvulescu – President of Central Control Commission
*Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu
*Andrei Pătrașcu
*Ana Pauker – Politburo member, Secretary
*Emil Popa
*Ilie Popa
*Iosif Rangheț
*Leontin Silaghi
*Chivu Stoica – Politburo member
*
*Gheorghe Vasilichi – Politburo member

and 8 candidate members
*Ilie Drăgan
*Alexandru Drăghici
*Dumitru Focșăneanu
*Mihai Mujic
*Ion Petre
*Gheorghe Radnev
*Mihail Roșianu

The post-1945 constant growth in membership, by far the highest of all Eastern Bloc countries, was to provide a base of support for Gheorghiu-Dej. The conference also saw the first mention of the PCdR as the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), the new name being used as a propaganda tool suggesting a closer connection with the national interest.

Party control over the security forces was successfully used on 8 November 1945, when the opposition parties organised a demonstration in front of the Royal Palace to express solidarity with King Michael, who was still refusing to sign his name to new legislation, on the occasion of his name day. Demonstrators were faced with gunshots; around 10 people were killed, and many wounded. The official account, according to which the Groza government responded to a coup attempt, was disputed by Frunză.

The PCR and its allies, grouped in the Bloc of Democratic Parties, won the Romanian elections of 19 November, although there is evidence of widespread electoral fraud. Years later, historian Petre Ţurlea reviewed an incomplete confidential PCR report about the election that confirmed the Bloc won around 48 percent of the vote. He concluded that had the election been conducted fairly, the opposition parties could have won enough votes between them to form a coalition government, albeit with far less than the 80 percent support opposition supporters long claimed.

The following months were dedicated to confronting the National Peasants&#x27; Party, which was annihilated after the Tămădău Affair and show trial of its entire leadership. On 30 December 1947, the Communist Party&#x27;s power was consolidated when King Michael was forced to abdicate. The Communist-dominated legislature then abolished the monarchy and proclaimed Romania a &quot;People&#x27;s Republic&quot;, firmly aligned with the Soviet Union. According to the king, his signature was obtained after the Groza cabinet representatives threatened to kill 1,000 students they had rounded up in custody.

===Romanian Workers&#x27; Party (1948–1965)===

====Creation====

In February 1948, the Communists ended a long process of infiltrating the Romanian Social Democratic Party (ensuring control through electoral alliances and the two-party &quot;Frontul Unic Muncitoresc&quot;—Singular Workers&#x27; Front, the PCR had profited from the departure of Constantin Titel Petrescu&#x27;s group from the Social Democrats in March 1946). The Social Democrats merged with the PCR to form the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Partidul Muncitoresc Român, PMR&quot;) which remained the ruling party&#x27;s official name until 24 July 1965 (when it returned to the designation as &quot;Romanian Communist Party&quot;). Nevertheless, Social Democrats were excluded from most party posts and were forced to support Communist policies on the basis of democratic centralism; it was also reported that only half of the PSD&#x27;s 500,000 members joined the newly founded grouping. Capitalizing on these gains, the Communist government shunted most of the remaining parties aside after the 1948 elections (the Ploughmen&#x27;s Front and the Hungarian People&#x27;s Union dissolved themselves in 1953). The PMR fought the elections as the dominant partner of the People&#x27;s Democratic Front (FND), which won with 93.2 percent of the vote. By then, however, the FND had taken on the same character as other &quot;popular fronts&quot;in the Soviet bloc. The member parties became completely subservient to the PMR, and had to accept its&quot;leading role&quot;as a condition of their continued existence. Groza, however, remained Prime Minister.

A new series of economic changes followed: the National Bank of Romania was passed into full public ownership (December 1946), and, in order to combat the Romanian leu&#x27;s devaluation, a surprise monetary reform was imposed as a stabilization measure in August 1947 (severely limiting the amount convertible by people without an actual job, primarily members of the aristocracy). The Marshall Plan was being overtly condemned, while nationalization and a planned economy were enforced beginning 11 June 1948. The first five-year plan, conceived by Miron Constantinescu&#x27;s Soviet-Romanian committee, was adopted in 1950. Of newly enforced measures, the arguably most far-reaching was collectivization—by 1962, when the process was considered complete, 96% of the total arable land had been enclosed in collective farming, while around 80,000 peasants faced trial for resisting and 17,000 others were uprooted or deported for being &quot;chiaburi&quot; (the Romanian equivalent of &quot;kulaks&quot;). Chiaburs were defined by the Party as the common enemies of communism in Romania. Thus, they were subjected to abuses by the cadres. In 1950, the party, which viewed itself as the vanguard of the working class, reported that people of proletarian origin held 64% of party offices and 40% of higher government posts, while results of the recruitment efforts remained below official expectations.

====Internal purges====
During the period, the central scene of the PMR was occupied by the conflict between the &quot;&quot;Muscovite wing&quot;, the &quot;prison wing&quot;led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, and the newly emerged and weaker&quot;Secretariat wing&quot;&quot;led by Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. After October 1945, the two former groups had associated in neutralizing Pătrăşcanu&#x27;s—exposed as&quot;bourgeois&quot;and progressively marginalized, it was ultimately decapitated in 1948. Beginning that year, the PMR leadership officially questioned its own political support, and began a massive campaign to remove&quot;foreign and hostile elements&quot; from its rapidly expanded structures. In 1952, with Stalin&#x27;s renewed approval, Gheorghiu-Dej emerged victorious from the confrontation with Ana Pauker, his chief &quot;Muscovite&quot;rival, as well as purging Vasile Luca, Teohari Georgescu, and their supporters from the party—alleging that their various political attitudes were proof of&quot;right-wing deviationism&quot;. Out of a membership of approximately one million, between 300,000 and 465,000 members, almost half of the party, was removed in the successive purges. The specific target for the &quot;verification campaign&quot;, as it was officially called, were former Iron Guard affiliates.

The move against Pauker&#x27;s group echoed Stalinist purges of Jews in particular from other Communist Parties in the Eastern bloc—notably, the anti-&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; campaign in which Joseph Stalin targeted Jews in the Soviet Union, and the Prague Trials in Czechoslovakia which removed Jews from leading positions in that country&#x27;s Communist government. At the same time, a new republican constitution, replacing its 1948 precedent, legislated Stalinist tenets, and proclaimed that &quot;the people&#x27;s democratic state is consistently carrying out the policy of enclosing and eliminating capitalist elements&quot;. Gheorghiu-Dej, who remained an orthodox Stalinist, took the position of Premier while moving Groza to the presidency of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly (de facto President of the People&#x27;s Republic). Executive and PMR leaderships remained in Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s hands until his death in 1965 (with the exception of 1954–1955, when his office of PMR leader was taken over by Gheorghe Apostol).

From the moment it came to power and until Stalin&#x27;s death, as the Cold War erupted, the PMR endorsed Soviet requirements for the Eastern Bloc. Aligning the country with the Cominform, it officially condemned Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s independent actions in Yugoslavia; Tito was routinely attacked by the official press, and the Romanian-Yugoslav Danube border became the scene of massive agitprop displays (&quot;see Tito–Stalin split and Informbiro&quot;).

====Gheorghiu-Dej and de-Stalinization====
Uncomfortable and possibly threatened by the reformist measures adopted by Stalin&#x27;s successor, Nikita Khrushchev, Gheorghiu-Dej began to steer Romania towards a more &quot;independent&quot; path while remaining within the Soviet orbit during the late 1950s. Following the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in which Khurshchev initiated De-Stalinization, Gheorghiu-Dej issued propaganda accusing Pauker, Luca and Georgescu of having been an arch-Stalinists responsible for the party&#x27;s excesses in the late 1940s and early 1950s (notably, in regard to collectivization)—despite the fact that they had occasionally opposed a number of radical measures advocated by the General Secretary. After that purge, Gheorghiu-Dej had begun promoting PMR activists who were perceived as more loyal to his own political views; among them were Nicolae Ceauşescu, Gheorghe Stoica, Ghizela Vass, Grigore Preoteasa, Alexandru Bârlădeanu, Ion Gheorghe Maurer, Gheorghe Gaston Marin, Paul Niculescu-Mizil, and Gheorghe Rădulescu; in parallel, citing Khrushchevite precedents, the PMR briefly reorganized its leadership on a plural basis (1954–1955), while Gheorghiu-Dej reshaped party doctrine to include ambiguous messages about Stalin&#x27;s legacy (insisting on the defunct Soviet&#x27;s leader contribution to Marxist thought, official documents also deplored his personality cult and encouraged Stalinists to self-criticism).

In this context, the PMR soon dismissed all the relevant consequences of the Twentieth Soviet Congress, and Gheorghiu-Dej even argued that De-Stalinization had been imposed by his team right after 1952. At a party meeting in March 1956, two members of the Politburo who were supporters of Khruschevite reforms, Miron Constantinescu and Iosif Chişinevschi, criticized Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s leadership and identified him with Romanian Stalinism. They were purged in 1957, themselves accused of being Stalinists and of having been plotting with Pauker. Through Ceaușescu&#x27;s voice, Gheorghiu-Dej also marginalized another group of old members of the PMR, associated with Constantin Doncea (June 1958).

On the outside too, the PMR, leading a country that had joined the Warsaw Pact, remained an agent of political repression: it fully supported Khurshchev&#x27;s invasion of Hungary in response to the Revolution of 1956, after which Imre Nagy and other dissident Hungarian leaders were imprisoned on Romanian soil. The Hungarian rebellion also sparked student protests in such places as Bucharest, Timișoara, Oradea, Cluj and Iași, which contributed to unease inside the PMR and resulted in a wave of arrests. While refusing to allow dissemination of Soviet literature exposing Stalinism (writers such as Ilya Ehrenburg and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn), Romanian leaders took active part in the campaign against Boris Pasternak.

Despite Stalin&#x27;s death, the massive police apparatus headed by the Securitate (created in 1949 and rapidly growing in numbers) maintained a steady pace in its suppression of&quot;class enemies&quot;, until as late as 1962–1964. In 1962–1964, the party leadership approved a mass amnesty, extended to, among other prisoners, ca. 6,700 guilty of political crimes. This marked a toning down in the violence and scale of repression, after almost twenty years during which the Party had acted against political opposition and active anti-communist resistance, as well as against religious institutions (most notably, the Romanian Roman Catholic and Greek-Catholic Churches). Estimates for the total number of victims in the 1947/1948-1964 period vary significantly: as low as 160,000 or 282,000 political prisoners, and as high 600,000 (according to one estimate, about 190,000 people were killed or died in custody— ). Notorious penal facilities of the time included the Danube-Black Sea Canal, Sighet, Gherla, Aiud, Pitești, and Râmnicu Sărat; another method of punishment was deportation to the inhospitable Bărăgan Plain.

====Gheorghiu-Dej and the &quot;national path&quot;====
Nationalism and national communism penetrated official discourse, largely owing to Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s call for economic independence and distancing from the Comecon. Moves to withdraw the country from Soviet overseeing were taken in quick succession after 1953. Khrushchev allowed Constantinescu to dissolve the SovRoms in 1954, followed by the closing of Romanian-Soviet cultural ventures such as Editura Cartea Rusă at the end of the decade. Industrialization along the PMR&#x27;s own directives highlighted Romanian independence—one of its consequences was the massive steel-producing industrial complex in Galați, which, being dependent on imports of iron from overseas, was for long a major strain on the Romanian economy. In 1957, Gheorghiu-Dej and Emil Bodnăraş persuaded the Soviets to withdraw their remaining troops from Romanian soil. As early as 1956, Romania&#x27;s political apparatus reconciled with Josip Broz Tito, which led to a series of common economic projects (culminating in the Iron Gates venture).

A drastic divergence in ideological outlooks manifested itself only after autumn 1961, when the PMR&#x27;s leadership felt threatened by the Soviet Union&#x27;s will to impose the condemnation of Stalinism as the standard in communist states. Following the Sino-Soviet split of the late 1950s and the Soviet-Albanian split in 1961, Romania initially gave full support to the Khrushchev&#x27;s stance, but maintained exceptionally good relations with both Maoist China and Communist Albania. Romanian media was alone among Warsaw Pact countries to report Chinese criticism of the Soviet leadership from its source; in return, Maoist officials complimented Romanian nationalism by supporting the view that Bessarabia had been a traditional victim of Russian imperialism.

The change in policies was to become obvious in 1964, when the Communist regime offered a stiff response to the &quot;Valev Plan&quot;, a Soviet project of creating trans-national economic units and of assigning Romanian areas the task of supplying agricultural products. Several other measures of that year also presented themselves as radical changes in tone: after Gheorghiu-Dej endorsed Andrei Oţetea&#x27;s publishing of Karl Marx&#x27;s Russophobic texts (uncovered by the Polish historian Stanisław Schwann), the PMR itself took a stand against Khrushchevite principles by issuing, in late April, a declaration published in &quot;Scînteia&quot;, through which it stressed its commitment to a &quot;national path&quot; towards Communism (it read: &quot;There does not and cannot exist a &quot;parent&quot; party and a &quot;son&quot; party or &quot;superior&quot; party and &quot;subordinate&quot; parties&quot;). During late 1964, the PMR&#x27;s leadership clashed with new Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev over the issue of KGB advisers still present in the Securitate, and eventually managed to have them recalled, making Romania the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s first country to have accomplished this.

These actions gave Romania greater freedom in pursuing the program which Gheorghiu-Dej had been committed to since 1954, one allowing Romania to defy reforms in the Eastern Bloc and to maintain a largely Stalinist course. It has also been argued that Romania&#x27;s emancipation was, in effect, limited to economic relations and military cooperation, being as such dependent on a relatively tolerant mood inside the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the PMR&#x27;s nationalism made it increasingly popular with Romanian intellectuals, and the last stage of the Gheorghiu-Dej regime was popularly identified with liberalization.

===Romanian Communist Party (1965–1989)===
====Ceaușescu&#x27;s rise====

Gheorghiu-Dej died in March 1965 and was succeeded by a collective leadership made up of Nicolae Ceaușescu as general secretary, Chivu Stoica as president and Ion Gheorghe Maurer as Premier. Ceaușescu removed rivals such as Stoica, Alexandru Drăghici, and Gheorghe Apostol from the government, and ultimately from the party leadership, and began accumulating posts for himself. By 1969, he was in complete control of the Central Committee. The circumstances surrounding this process are still disputed, but theories evidence that the support given to him by Ion Gheorghe Maurer and Emil Bodnăraș, as well as the ascendancy of Ilie Verdeț, Virgil Trofin, and Paul Niculescu-Mizil, were instrumental in ensuring legitimacy. Soon after 1965, Ceaușescu used his prerogatives to convoke a Party Commission headed by Ion Popescu-Puțuri, charged with investigating both Stalinist legacy and Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s purges: resulting in the rehabilitation of a large number of Communist officials (including, among others, Ștefan Foriș, Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, Miron Constantinescu, Vasile Luca, and Romanian victims of the Soviet Great Purge). This measure was instrumental in consolidating the new leadership while further increasing its distance from Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s political legacy.

In 1965, Ceaușescu declared that Romania was no longer a People&#x27;s Democracy but a Socialist Republic and changed the name of the party back to the Romanian Communist Party—steps which were meant to indicate that Romania was following strict Marxist policies while remaining independent. He continued Romanianization and de-Sovietization efforts by stressing notions such as sovereignty and self-determination. At the time, Ceauşescu made references to Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s own personality cult, while implying that his was to be a new style of leadership. In its official discourse, the PCR introduced the dogmas of &quot;socialist democracy&quot; and direct communication with the masses. From ca. 1965 to 1975, there was a noted rise in the standard of living for the Romanian population as a whole, which was similar to developments in most other Eastern bloc countries. Political scientist Daniel Barbu, who noted that this social improvement trend began ca. 1950 and benefited 45% of the population, concluded that one of its main effects was to increase the citizens&#x27; dependency on the state.

A seminal event occurred in August 1968, when Ceaușescu highlighted his anti-Soviet discourse by vocally opposing the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia; a highly popular measure with the Romanian public, it led to sizable enrollments in the PCR and the newly created paramilitary Patriotic Guards (created with the goal of meeting a possible Soviet intervention in Romania). From 1965 to 1976, the PCR rose from approximately 1.4 million members to 2.6 million. In the contingency of an anti-Soviet war, the PCR even sought an alliance with the maverick Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito—negotiations did not yield a clear result. Although military intervention in Romania was reportedly taken into consideration by the Soviets, there is indication that Leonid Brezhnev had himself ruled out Romanian participation in Warsaw Pact maneuvers, and that he continued to rely on Ceaușescu&#x27;s support for other common goals.

While it appears that Romanian leaders genuinely approved of the Prague Spring reforms undertaken by Alexander Dubček, Ceaușescu&#x27;s gesture also served to consolidate his image as a national and independent communist leader. One year before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Ceaușescu opened up diplomatic ties with West Germany, and refused to break links with Israel following the Six-Day War. Starting with the much-publicized visit by France&#x27;s Charles de Gaulle (May 1968), Romania was the recipient of Western world support going well into the 1970s (significant visits were paid by United States Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, in 1969 and 1975 respectively, while Ceaușescu was frequently received in Western capitals).

====Ceaușescu&#x27;s supremacy====

Ceaușescu developed a cult of personality around himself and his wife Elena (herself promoted to high offices) after visiting North Korea and noting the parallel developed by Kim Il Sung, while incorporating in it several aspects of past authoritarian regimes in Romania (&quot;see Conducător&quot;). During the early 1970s, while curbing liberalization, he launched his own version of China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, announced by the &quot;July Theses&quot;. In effect, measures to concentrate power in Ceaușescu&#x27;s hands were taken as early as 1967, when the general secretary became the ultimate authority on foreign policy.

At the time, a new organization was instituted under the name of Front of Socialist Unity (eventually renamed the Front of Socialist Unity and Democracy). Ostensibly a popular front affiliating virtually all non-party members, it was actually tightly controlled by party activists. It was intended to consolidate the impression that the entire population was backing Ceaușescu&#x27;s policies. As a result of these new policies, the Central Committee, which acted as the main PCR body between Congresses, had increased to 265 full members and 181 candidate members (supposed to meet at least four times a year). By then, the general secretary also called for women to be enrolled in greater numbers in all party structures. In parallel, the political doctrine in respect to minorities claimed interest in obtaining allegiance from both Hungarians and Germans, and set up separate workers&#x27; councils for both communities.
Members of the upper echelons of the party who objected to Ceaușescu&#x27;s stance were accused of supporting Soviet policies; they included Alexandru Bârlădeanu, who criticized the heavy loans contracted in support of industrialization policies. In time, the new leader distanced himself from Maurer and Corneliu Mănescu, while his career profited from the deaths of Stoica (who committed suicide) and Sălăjan (who died while undergoing surgery). Instead, he came to rely on a new generation of activists, among them Manea Mănescu.

At the XIth Party Congress in 1974, Gheorghe Cioară, the Mayor of Bucharest, proposed to extend Ceaușescu&#x27;s office as General Secretary for life, but was turned down by the latter. Shortly before that moment, the collective leadership of the Presidium was replaced with a Political Executive Committee, which, in practice, elected itself; together with the Secretariat, it was controlled by Ceaușescu himself, who was president of both bodies. During the same year, the general secretary also made himself President of the Socialist Republic, following a ceremony during which he was handed a sceptre; this was the first in a succession of titles, also including &quot;Conducător&quot; (&quot;Leader&quot;), &quot;supreme commander of the Romanian People&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;honorary president of the Romanian Academy&quot;, and &quot;first among the country&#x27;s miners&quot;. Progressively after 1967, the large bureaucratic structure of the PCR again replicated and interfered with state administration and economic policies. The President himself became noted for frequent visits on location at various enterprises, where he would dispense directives, for which the termed &quot;indicații prețioase&quot; (&quot;valuable advice&quot;) was coined by official propaganda.

Despite the party&#x27;s independent, &quot;national communist&quot; course, the absolute control that Ceaușescu had over the party and the country led to some non-Romanian observers describing the PCR as one of the closest things to an old-style Stalinist party. For instance, Encyclopædia Britannica referred to the last 18 years of Ceaușescu&#x27;s tenure as a period of &quot;neo-Stalinism&quot;, and the last edition of the Country Study on Romania referred to the PCR&#x27;s &quot;Stalinist repression of individual liberties.&quot;

====Late 1970s crisis====
The renewed industrialization, which based itself on both a dogmatic understanding of Marxian economics and a series of autarkic goals, brought major economic problems to Romania, beginning with the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, and worsened by the 1979 energy crisis. The profound neglect of services and decline in quality of life, first manifested when much of the budget was diverted to support an over-sized industry, was made more drastic by the political decision to pay in full the country&#x27;s external debt (in 1983, this was set at 10 billion United States dollars, of which 4.5 billion was accumulated interest). By March 1989, the debt had been paid in full.

Two other programs initiated under Ceaușescu had massive consequences on social life. One of them was the plan, announced as early as 1965, to &quot;systemize rural areas&quot;, which was meant to urbanize Romania at a fast pace (of over 13,000 communes, the country was supposed to be left with 6,000); it also brought massive changes for the cities—especially Bucharest, where, following the 1977 earthquake and successive demolitions, new architectural guidelines were imposed (&quot;see Ceaușima&quot;). By 1966, Romania outlawed abortion, and, progressively after that, measures were endorsed to artificially increase the birth rate—including special taxes for childless couples. Another measure, going hand in hand with economic ones, allowed ethnic Germans a chance to leave Romania and settle in West Germany as &quot;Auslandsdeutsche&quot;, in return for payments from the latter country. Overall, around 200,000 Germans left, most of them Transylvanian Saxons and Banat Swabians.

Although Romania adhered to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (1973) and signed the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, Ceauşescu also intensified political repression in the country (beginning in 1971). This took a drastic turn in 1977, when, confronted with Paul Goma&#x27;s movement in support for &quot;Charter 77&quot;, the regime expelled him and others from the country. A more serious disobedience occurred in August of the same year, when Jiu Valley miners went on strike, briefly took hold of Premier Ilie Verdeţ, and, despite having reached an agreement with the government, were repressed and some of them expelled (&quot;see Jiu Valley miners&#x27; strike of 1977&quot;). A newly created and independent trade union, SLOMR, was crushed and its leaders arrested on various charges in 1979. Progressively during the period, the Securitate relied on involuntary commitment to psychiatric hospitals as a means to punish dissidence.

====1980s====

A major act of discontent occurred inside the party during its XIIth Congress in late November 1979, when PCR veteran Constantin Pîrvulescu spoke out against Ceaușescu&#x27;s policy of discouraging discussions and relying on obedient cadres (he was subsequently heckled, evicted from the Congress hall, and isolated). In 1983, Radu Filipescu, an engineer working in Bucharest, was imprisoned after distributing 20,000 leaflets which called for a popular rally against the regime, while a protests of miners in Maramureș County against wage cuts was broken up by Securitate forces; three years later a strike organized by Romanian and Hungarian industrial workers in Turda and Cluj-Napoca met with the same result. Also in 1983, fearing the multiplication of &quot;samizdat&quot; documents, Minister of the Interior George Homoștean ordered all citizens to hand over their typewriters to the authorities. This coincided with a noted popular rise in support for outspoken dissidents who were kept under house arrest, among whom were Doina Cornea and Mihai Botez.

By 1983, membership of the PCR had risen to 3.3 million, and, in 1989, to 3.7–3.8 million—meaning that, in the end, over 20% of Romanian adults were party members, making the PCR the largest communist group of the Eastern Bloc after the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 64,200 basic party units, answering to county committees, varying in number and representing various areas of Romanian society, were officially recorded in 1980. Statistics also indicated that, during the transition from the 1965 PMR (with 8% of the total population) to the 1988 PCR, the membership of workers had grown from 44 to 55%, while that of peasants had dropped from 34 to 15%. In the end, these records contrasted the fact that the PCR had become completely subservient to its leader and no longer had any form of autonomous activity, while membership became a basic requirement in numerous social contexts, leading to purely formal allegiances and political clientelism.

At the same time, the ideological viewpoint was changed, with the party no longer seen as the vanguard of the working class, but as the main social factor and the embodiment of the national interest. In marked contrast with the &quot;Perestroika&quot; and &quot;Glasnost&quot; policies developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Gorbachev, Romania adopted Neo-Stalinist principles in both its internal policies and its relations with the outside world.

As recorded in 1984, 90% of the PCR members were ethnic Romanians, with 7% Hungarians (the latter group&#x27;s membership had dropped by more than 2% since the previous Congress). Formal criticism of the new policies regarding minorities had also been voiced by Hungarian activists, including Károly Király, leader of the PCR in Covasna County. After 1980, the nationalist ideology adopted by the PCR progressively targeted the Hungarian community as a whole, based on suspicions of its allegiance to Hungary, whose policies had become diametrically opposed to the methods of Romanian leaders (&quot;see Goulash Communism&quot;).
Especially during the 1980s, clientelism was further enhanced by a new policy, &quot;rotația cadrelor&quot; (&quot;cadre rotation&quot; or &quot;reshuffling&quot;), placing strain on low-level officials to seek the protection of higher placed ones as a means to preserve their position or to be promoted. This effectively prompted activists who did not approve of the change in tone to retire, while others—Virgil Trofin, Ion Iliescu and Paul Niculescu-Mizil among them—were officially dispatched to low-ranking positions or otherwise marginalized. In June 1988, the leadership of the Political Executive Committee was reduced from 15 to 7 members, including Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife.

While some elements of the PCR were receptive to Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms, Ceaușescu himself wanted nothing to do with &quot;glasnost&quot; or &quot;perestroika.&quot; As a result, the PCR remained an obstinate bastion of hardline Communism. Gorbachev&#x27;s distaste for Ceaușescu was well known; he even went as far as to call Ceaușescu &quot;the Romanian führer. &quot;In Gorbachev&#x27;s mind, Ceaușescu was part of a &quot;Gang of Four&quot; inflexibly hardline leaders unwilling to make the reforms he felt necessary to save Communism, along with Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Gustáv Husák, Bulgaria&#x27;s Todor Zhivkov and East Germany&#x27;s Erich Honecker. At a meeting between the two, Gorbachev upbraided Ceaușescu for his inflexible attitude. &quot;You are running a dictatorship here,&quot; the Soviet leader warned. However, Ceaușescu refused to bend.

====Downfall====
Announced by a February 1987 protest of workers and students in Iași, the final crisis of the PCR and its regime began in the autumn, when industrial employees in Brașov called a strike that immediately drew echoes with the city&#x27;s population (&quot;see Brașov Rebellion&quot;). In December, authorities convened a public kangaroo trial of the movement&#x27;s leaders, and handed out sentences of imprisonment and internal exile.

Inaugurated by Silviu Brucan&#x27;s public criticism of the Braşov repression, and inspired by the impact of changes in other Eastern Bloc countries, protests of marginalized PCR activists became notorious after March 1989, when Brucan and Pârvulescu, together with Gheorghe Apostol, Alexandru Bârlădeanu, Grigore Răceanu and Corneliu Mănescu, sent Ceaușescu their so-called &quot;Letter of the Six&quot;, publicized over Radio Free Europe. At around the same time, systematization provoked an international response, as Romania was subjected to a resolution of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which called for an inquiry into the state of ethnic minorities and the rural population; the political isolation experienced by Communist Romania was highlighted by the fact that Hungary endorsed the report, while all other Eastern bloc countries abstained. This followed more than a decade of deteriorating relations between the PCR and the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party.

In the face of the changes that unfolded in the rest of Eastern Europe in 1988 and 1989, the PCR retained its image as one of the most unreconstructed parties in the Soviet bloc. It even went as far as to call for a Warsaw Pact invasion of Poland after that country&#x27;s Communists announced a power-sharing agreement with the Solidarity trade union—a sharp reversal of its previous opposition to the Brezhnev Doctrine and its vehement opposition to the invasion of Czechoslovakia 21 years earlier. It initially appeared that the PCR would ride out the anti-Communist tide sweeping through Eastern Europe when on 24 November—two weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the same day that Communist rule effectively ended in Czechoslovakia—Ceaușescu was reelected for another five-year term as General Secretary.

A month later, both Ceaușescu and the party were overthrown in the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, begun as a popular rebellion in Timișoara and eventually bringing to power the National Salvation Front, comprising a large number of moderate former PCR members who supported Gorbachev&#x27;s vision. Having fled the PCR&#x27;s headquarters under pressure from demonstrators, Ceauşescu and his wife were captured, tried, and executed by the new authorities in Târgoviște. No formal dissolution of the PCR took place. Rather, the party simply disappeared. The speed with which the PCR, one of the largest parties of its kind, dissolved, as well as its spontaneity, were held by commentators as additional proof that its sizable membership presented a largely false image of its true beliefs. In nearly every other Eastern Bloc country, the former ruling Communist parties recast themselves into social democratic or democratic socialist parties, and remain major players to this day.

Many former members of the PCR have been major players in the post-1989 political scene. For example, until 2014 every post-revolution president had formerly been a member of the PCR. Among other small parties an unregistered party of the same name and the small Romanian Socialist Party claim to be the successors of the PCR, with the latter entering Parliament in the 1992–1996 legislature under its former name of &quot;Socialist Party of Labour&quot;.

<text>The 1878 Canadian federal election was held on September 17, 1878, to elect members of the House of Commons of the 4th Parliament of Canada. It resulted in the end of Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s Liberal government after only one term in office. Canada suffered an economic depression during Mackenzie&#x27;s term, and his party was punished by voters for it. The Liberals&#x27; policy of free trade also hurt their support with the business establishment in Toronto and Montreal.

Sir John A. Macdonald and his Conservative Party were returned to power after having been defeated four years before amidst scandals over the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

<text>Eumenes I () was dynast (ruler) of the city of Pergamon in Asia Minor from 263 BC until his death in 241 BC. He was the son of Eumenes, the brother of Philetaerus, the founder of the Attalid dynasty, and Satyra, daughter of Poseidonius. As he had no children, Philetaerus adopted Eumenes to become his heir.

Although nominally under Seleucid control, Pergamon under Philetaerus enjoyed considerable autonomy. However, upon his succession, Eumenes, perhaps with the encouragement of Ptolemy II, who was at war with the Seleucids, revolted, defeating the Seleucid king Antiochus I near the Lydian capital of Sardis in 261 BC. He was thus able to free Pergamon, and greatly increase the territories under his control. In his new possessions, he established garrison posts in the north at the foot of Mount Ida called Philetaireia after his adoptive father, and in the east, northeast of Thyatira near the sources of the river Lycus, called Attaleia after his grandfather, and he extended his control south of the river Caïcus to the Gulf of Cyme as well. Demonstrating his independence, he began to strike coins with the portrait of Philetaerus, while his predecessor had still depicted Seleucus I Nicator.

After the revolt from the Seleucids, there are no records of any further hostilities involving Pergamon during Eumenes&#x27; rule, even though there continued to be conflict between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies, and even though the Galatian Gauls were continually plundering throughout the region. If Eumenes was able to keep Pergamon free from the ravages of the Gauls, it was probably because he paid them tribute.

Although never assuming the title of &quot;king,&quot; Eumenes did exercise all of the powers of one. Imitating other Hellenistic rulers, a festival in Eumenes&#x27; honour, called &quot;Eumeneia&quot;, was instituted in Pergamon.

It is not known whether he had children. A &quot;Philetaerus son of Eumenes&quot; is mentioned in an inscription in the town of Thespiae; some regard him as Eumenes&#x27; son, who would then have died before his father&#x27;s death in 241. Eumenes adopted his first cousin once removed, Attalus I, who succeeded him as ruler of Pergamon.

<doc id="1044976" wikidata="Q7166540" url="?curid=1044976" title="Peptoid">
<text>Peptoids (root from the Greek πεπτός, &quot;peptós&quot; &quot;digested&quot;; derived from πέσσειν, &quot;péssein&quot; &quot;to digest&quot; and the Greek-derived suffix -oid meaning &quot;like, like that of, thing like a ______,&quot; ), or poly-&quot;N&quot;-substituted glycines, are a class of biochemicals known as biomimetics that replicate the behavior of biological molecules. Peptidomimetics are recognizable by side chains that are appended to the nitrogen atom of the peptide backbone, rather than to the α-carbons (as they are in amino acids). 

==Chemical structure and synthesis==

In peptoids, the side chain is connected to the nitrogen of the peptide backbone, instead of the α-carbon as in peptides. Notably, peptoids lack the amide hydrogen which is responsible for many of the secondary structure elements in peptides and proteins. Peptoids were first invented by Reyna J. Simon, Ronald N. Zuckermann, Paul Bartlett and Daniel V. Santi to mimic protein/peptide products to aid in the discovery of protease-stable small molecule drugs for the East Bay company Chiron.

Following the sub-monomer protocol originally created by Ron Zuckermann, each residue is installed in two steps: acylation and displacement. In the acylation step, a haloacetic acid, typically bromoacetic acid activated by diisopropylcarbodiimide reacts with the amine of the previous residue. In the displacement step (a classical SN2 reaction), an amine displaces the halide to form the &quot;N&quot;-substituted glycine residue. The submonomer approach allows the use of any commercially available or synthetically accessible amine with great potential for combinatorial chemistry.

==Unique characteristics==
Like D-Peptides and β peptides, peptoids are completely resistant to proteolysis, and are therefore advantageous for therapeutic applications where proteolysis is a major issue. Since secondary structure in peptoids does not involve hydrogen bonding, it is not typically denatured by solvent, temperature, or chemical denaturants such as urea (see details below).

Notably, since the amino portion of the amino acid results from the use of any amine, thousands of commercially available amines can be used to generate unprecedented chemical diversity at each position at costs far lower than would be required for similar peptides or peptidomimetics. To date, at least 230 different amines have been used as side chains in peptoids.

== Structure ==
Peptoid oligomers are known to be conformationally unstable, due to the flexibility of the main-chain methylene groups and the absence of stabilizing hydrogen bond interactions along the backbone. Nevertheless, through the choice of appropriate side chains it is possible to form specific steric or electronic interactions that favour the formation of stable secondary structures like helices, especially peptoids with C-α-branched side chains are known to adopt structure analogous to polyproline I helix. Different strategies have been employed to predict and characterize peptoid secondary structure, with the ultimate goal of developing fully folded peptoid protein structures
The cis/trans amide bond isomerization still leads to a conformational heterogeneity which doesn’t allow for the formation of homogeneous peptoid foldamers. Nonetheless, scientists were able to find trans-inducer &quot;N&quot;-Aryl side chains promoting polyproline type II helix, and strong cis-inducer such as bulky naphtylethyl and tert-butyl side chains. It was also found that n→π* interactions can modulate the ratio of cis/trans amide bond conformers, until reaching a complete control of the cis conformer in the peptoid backbone using a functionalizable triazolium side chain.

==Applications==
The first demonstration of the use of peptoids was in screening a combinatorial library of diverse peptoids, which yielded novel high-affinity ligands for 7-transmembrane G-protein-couple receptors.

Peptoids have been developed as candidates for a range of different biomedical applications, including antimicrobial agents, synthetic lung surfactants, ligands for various proteins including Src Homology 3 (SH3 domain), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) receptor 2, and antibody Immunoglobulin G biomarkers for the identification of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Due to their advantageous characteristics as described above, peptoids are also being actively developed for use in nanotechnology, an area in which they may play an important role.

=== Antimicrobial agents ===
Researchers supported by grants from the NIH and NIAID tested the efficacy of antimicrobial peptoids against antibiotic-resistant strands of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;. Antimicrobial peptoids demonstrate a non-specific mechanism of action against the bacterial membrane, one that differs from small-molecule antibiotics that bind to specific receptors (and thus are susceptible to mutations or alterations in bacterial structure). Preliminary results suggested &quot;appreciable activity&quot; against drug-sensitive bacterial strands, leading to a call for more research into the viability of peptoids as a new class of tuberculocidal drugs.

Researchers at the Barron Lab at Stanford University (supported by a NIH Pioneer Award grant) are currently studying whether upregulation of the human host defense peptide LL-37 or application of antimicrobial treatments based on LL-37 may prevent or treat sporadic Alzheimer’s dementia. Lead researcher Annelise Barron discovered that the innate human defense peptide LL-37 binds to the peptide Ab, which is associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Barron&#x27;s insight is that an imbalance between LL-37 and Ab may be a critical factor affecting AD-associated fibrils and plaques. The project extends focus upon the potential relationship between chronic, oral &quot;P. gingivalis&quot; and herpesvirus (HSV-1) infections to the progression of Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia.

<text>The Idiots () is a 1998 Danish black comedy drama film written and directed by Lars von Trier. It is his first film made in compliance with the Dogme 95 Manifesto, and is also known as Dogme #2. It is the second film in von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Golden Heart Trilogy&quot;, preceded by &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; (1996) and succeeded by &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; (2000). It is among the first films to be shot entirely with digital cameras.

It was screened at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d’Or, despite being met with widespread criticism upon release.

==Plot==
A seemingly anti-bourgeois group of adults spend their time seeking their &quot;inner idiot&quot; to release their inhibitions. They do so by behaving in public as if they were mentally disabled.

At a restaurant, the patrons are disturbed by the group&#x27;s antics, which are barely contained by their supposed &quot;handler&quot;, Susanne. The group refers to this behavior as &quot;spassing&quot;, a neologism derived from &quot;spasser&quot;, the Danish equivalent of &quot;spaz&quot;. Unaware that the group is pretending, Karen, a single diner, is initially sympathetic to what she believes are their genuine disabilities. One of the group members holds her hand, compelling her to go along with them in a taxi. During the ride, she discovers their act, leading to a mix of discomfort and curiosity. Upon arriving at a large house, she learns that Stoffer, the apparent leader of the group, is supposed to be selling the property (which belongs to his uncle), but instead, it becomes the focal point for the group&#x27;s activities.

The &quot;spassing&quot; is a self-defeating attempt by the group to challenge the establishment through provocation. The self-styled idiots feel that the society-at-large treats their intelligence uncreatively and unchallengingly; thus, they seek the uninhibited self-expression that they imagine a romantic ideal of disability will allow.

Stoffer, at his birthday party, wishes for a &quot;gangbang&quot;, so the group members have group sex (without participation of Karen). Josephine wanders off separately, and is followed by Jeppe. The two privately engage in intercourse, in an awkwardly deep connection. However, the next morning, Josephine&#x27;s father arrives. After chastising the group, he reprimands Josephine for not taking her medication and orders her to return home. Several try to stop her, including Jeppe who lunges himself desperately onto the hood of the car, but is ultimately removed after a tearful exchange between him and Josephine.

Then an agitated Stoffer calls for the group members to let idiocy invade their personal daily lives. Most of the members refuse to take up the challenge and decide to leave the group, leading the group to be dissolved. But Karen decides to take up the challenge. Karen takes Susanne back to her house, where they are greeted with surprise by Karen&#x27;s mother. Karen has been missing for two weeks, following the death of her young baby; she offers no explanation of where she has been. Karen attempts to spaz in front of her family by dribbling her food, but this results in a violent slap from her husband, Anders. Karen and Susanne leave the house together.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;The Idiots&quot; is a co-production of companies from Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden. It was filmed during May and June 1997. The script was written over just four days, between 16-19 May. A Sony DCR-VX1000 was used for filming, operated by von Trier himself.

==Style==
The confession of a Dogme 95 film is an idea adapted by Thomas Vinterberg in the first Dogme 95 film: Make a confession if there were things happening on the shoot which are not in accordance with the strict interpretation of the Dogme 95 rules. It is written from the director&#x27;s point of view. Accordingly, von Trier made the following confession:

In relation to the production of Dogme 2 &quot;The Idiots&quot;, I confess:
* To have used a stand-in in one case only (the sexual intercourse scene).
* To have organised payment of cash to the actors for shopping of accessories (food).
* To have intervened with the location (by moving sources of light – candlelight – to achieve exposure).
* To have been aware of the fact that the production had entered into an agreement of leasing a car (without the knowledge of the involved actor).

All in all, and apart from the above, I feel to have lived up to the intentions and rules of the manifesto: Dogme95.

In order to not violate Dogme 95 rule 2, forbidding the use of non-diegetic music, a harmonica player was recorded during the shooting of some scenes, including the end credits, even if he is not seen onscreen.

==Release==
&quot;The Idiots&quot; provoked a storm of publicity and debates, one of which was about the fictional representation of disability. Film critic Mark Kermode&#x27;s reaction was to shout &quot;Il est merde! Il est merde! (sic)&quot; from the back of the auditorium during the official screening of the film at Cannes, a spontaneous review for which he was ejected from the venue.

Channel 4 aired the film unedited in 2005 as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;Banned&quot; season exploring censorship and cinematic works. Viewer complaints prompted an Ofcom investigation, which came out in favour of Channel 4. In its ruling, Ofcom found the film &quot;not in breach&quot; of the relevant Code under the specific circumstances of the broadcast, that is &quot;the serious contextualisation of the film within a season examining the censorship of film and television, its artistic purpose, the channel which transmitted it, the strong warnings before the film and prior to the scene in question and the scheduling after midnight&quot;. Ofcom added the caveat that &quot;while we do not consider the film was in breach of the Code on this occasion, we must consider carefully the acceptability of any similar content on an individual basis&quot;.

The film is classified as adult-only in Argentina, Australia (though it has been shown uncut on TV with an MA rating), Chile, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. In Switzerland and Germany, the film ran uncut with a 16-years rating in theaters, followed by a DVD release with the same rating and several uncut television airings. Following their acquisition of 11 of Von Trier’s films, Mubi theatrically released a 4K restoration of the film on June 16, 2023, in celebration of its 25th anniversary.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 72% score based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Idiots&quot; feels more like an experiment than a coherent narrative, but director Lars von Trier&#x27;s provocative style and rumination on civilization will leave most audience members feeling like satisfied test subjects&quot;. Metacritic reports a 47 out of 100 rating based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Reactions to the film ranged from strong criticism to strong praise. A.O. Scott wrote a critical review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, calling the film &quot;a two-hour, semi-pornographic Mentos commercial&quot; and singled out the final scene in particular for strong criticism, stating that the film &quot;descends to truly contemptible emotional brutality&quot;. Conversely, Owen Glieberman in &quot;Entertainment Weekly &quot;described the film as &quot;a raw, funny, maddening ramble&quot; where von Trier &quot;seeks catharsis by pushing everything to extremes&quot; and described the final scene as &quot;a gripping moment of high torment&quot;.

&quot;The Idiots&quot; was ranked #76 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. The magazine had previously given it a full five star rating on its release in UK cinemas. It is listed as #941 in the film reference book &#x27;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&#x27;.

===Sexually explicit scenes===
More controversy arose over the sexual content, which was unusually explicit for a narrative film. &quot;The Idiots&quot; contains a shower scene in which a member of the group (in character as an &quot;idiot&quot;) has an erection and, later, a group sex scene that includes one couple (faces not seen, stand-ins from the porn industry) having unsimulated penetrative (vaginal) sexual intercourse. Both instances of explicit content are in view only for a few seconds. The film was cleared for theatrical release by the British Board of Film Classification, receiving an 18 certificate. When it was shown on Film4 (then &quot;FilmFour&quot;) in 2000, the erection and the intercourse were obscured by pixelization, following an order from the Independent Television Commission.

===Accolades===
The film was shown in competition at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.

<text>The Timetable For Action is a policy document by the U.K. Conservative Party, in which leader Michael Howard spells out some key actions he would take if elected Prime Minister, within the first hour, day, week, and month of a Conservative government.

==Timing and rationale==
The document was released during the Conservative Party&#x27;s annual party conference in October 2004, widely speculated to be the last before a rumoured general election in May 2005. Key to Howard&#x27;s address to the conference were the issues of accountability and trust; the &quot;Timetable&quot; was intended to give the voters a sort of checklist, so they could tell if a (hypothetical) Conservative government was keeping its promises.

At roughly the same time, opinion polls suggested that only 12% of the British people believed Howard would win the next election. Most predicted that the ruling Labour Party under Tony Blair would prevail.

==&quot;Timetable&quot; highlights==
These are some of the policies Howard lays out. There are others.

: Within the first hour:
:* &quot;I will make the Office for National Statistics independent of ministers.&quot;

: Within the first day:
:* &quot;I will set a date for the referendum on the European Constitution.&quot;
:* &quot;The Health Secretary will abolish targets imposed by Whitehall on hospitals.&quot;
:* &quot;I will announce the appointment of a Minister for Homeland Security with responsibility for counter-terrorism and emergency planning.&quot;

: Within the first week:
:* &quot;The Home Secretary will announce the ending of Labour&#x27;s early release from prison scheme.&quot;
:* &quot;The Health Secretary will make it possible for people to have access to information about hospital performance, including on infection rates.&quot;

: Within the first month:
:* &quot;We will set out our program of legislation to:&quot;
::* &quot;Introduce a points system for immigration ... priority [will be] given to people who want to come to Britain to work hard and make a positive contribution.&quot;
::* &quot;Require drug addicts to choose between immediate rehabilitation in secure accommodation or prosecution and prison.&quot;
::* &quot;Abolish student fees and provide more money to universities.&quot;
:* &quot;The Immigration Minister will set in train 24-hour surveillance at ports of entry.&quot;
:* &quot;The Home Secretary will start our new prison building programme, and the recruitment of an extra 5,000 police officers each year.&quot;

==Comments==
Many of the policies are traditional Conservative policies - the party (and Michael Howard) have always been seen as tough on crime, as Eurosceptic, and as taking a hard line on immigration. Others aim at reducing bureaucracy (e.g. hospital targets) and creating a &quot;smaller government&quot;, on the theory that workers in the public services should be allowed to simply get on with their jobs. The policy of making the Office for National Statistics independent appears to be an attempt to capitalise on a public perception of Labour as a &quot;party of spin&quot; who manipulate figures.

Notable by its absence is any firm commitment to reducing tax. In his speech at the party conference, Howard said that he would not make promises he could not keep.

<doc id="1044987" wikidata="Q1002" url="?curid=1044987" title="Chukchi Peninsula">
<text>The Chukchi Peninsula (also Chukotka Peninsula or Chukotski Peninsula; , &quot;Chukotskiy poluostrov&quot;, short form , &quot;Chukotka&quot;), at about 66° N 172° W, is the easternmost peninsula of Asia. Its eastern end is at Cape Dezhnev near the village of Uelen. The Chukotka Mountains are located in the central/western part of the peninsula, which is bounded by the Chukchi Sea to the north, the Bering Sea to the south, and the Bering Strait to the east, where at its easternmost point it is only about from Seward Peninsula in Alaska; this is the smallest distance between the land masses of Eurasia and North America. The peninsula is part of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia.

The peninsula is traditionally the home of tribes of the indigenous peoples of Siberia as well as some Russian settlers. It lies along the Northern Sea Route, or Northeast Passage. Industries on the peninsula are mining (tin, lead, zinc, gold, and coal), hunting and trapping, reindeer raising, and fishing.

In the Bering Strait about halfway between the peninsula and the Seward Peninsula are the fairly small Diomede Islands; the western one is Big Diomede, Russia and the eastern one is Little Diomede Island, Alaska. The much larger St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, is about southeast of the peninsula&#x27;s southernmost point.

The Eturerveyem River flows into Kolyuchin Bay on the peninsula.

<doc id="1045002" wikidata="Q1073341" url="?curid=1045002" title="St George's Hall, Liverpool">
<text>St George&#x27;s Hall is a building on St George&#x27;s Place, opposite Lime Street railway station in the centre of Liverpool, England. Opened in 1854, it is a Neoclassical building which contains concert halls and law courts, and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. On the east side of the hall, between it and the railway station, is St George&#x27;s Plateau and on the west side are St John&#x27;s Gardens. The hall is included in the William Brown Street conservation area.

In 1969 the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner expressed his opinion that it is one of the finest neo-Grecian buildings in the world, although the building is known for its use of Roman sources as well as Greek. In 2004, the hall and its surrounding area were recognised as part of Liverpool&#x27;s World Heritage Site until its revocation of World Heritage status in 2021. The Liverpool Register Office and Coroner&#x27;s Court have been based in the hall since 2012.

==History==
The site of the hall was formerly occupied by the first Liverpool Infirmary from 1749 to 1824. Triennial music festivals were held in the city but there was no suitable hall to accommodate them. Following a public meeting in 1836 a company was formed to raise subscriptions for a hall in Liverpool to be used for the festivals, and for meetings, dinners and concerts. Shares were made available at £25 each and by January 1837 £23,350 () had been raised. In 1838 the foundation stone was laid to commemorate the coronation of Queen Victoria.

A competition was announced on 5 March 1839 via an advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot; to design the hall, first prize was 250 guineas, second prize 150 guineas. By July more than eighty entries had been received, and the competition was won by Harvey Lonsdale Elmes, a London architect aged 25 years, the second prize went to George Alexander of London. The requirement was:
:&quot;There is to be accommodation in the main hall for 3000 persons; and there is also to be a concert room, capable of accommodating 1000 persons, applicable to other purposes such as lectures and smaller meetings...the cost of the building will be £35,000&quot;

There was a need for assize courts in the city and a competition to design these with first prize £300 and second prize £200 was announced. There were eighty-six entries and it was also won by Elmes. The original plan was to have separate buildings but in 1840 Elmes suggested that both functions could be combined in one building on a scale which would surpass most of the public buildings in the country at the time. Construction started in 1841 and the building opened in 1854 (with the small concert room opening two years later). 
:&quot;How frequently I observe the great &amp; true end &amp; aim of Art entirely lost sight of in the discussion of some insignificant detail or quaint Antiquarianism. Bold and original conceptions never can find favour while so much stress is laid upon precedent&quot; Harvey Lonsdale Elmes in a letter to Robert Rawlinson.

Elmes died in 1847 and the work was continued by John Weightman, Corporation Surveyor, and Robert Rawlinson, structural engineer, until in 1851 Charles Cockerell was appointed architect. Cockerell was largely responsible for the decoration of the interiors. The eventual cost of the building exceeded £300,000 (roughly equivalent to £33,000,000 in 2019). Following the implementation of the Courts Act 1971, the former assizes court was re-designated Liverpool Crown Court. The Crown Court moved to the new Law Courts in Derby Square in 1984.

During the 2000s a major restoration of the hall took place costing £23m and it was officially reopened on 23 April 2007 by Prince Charles. The magnificent sculpture of the exterior was by William Grinsell Nicholl.

==Structure==

===Plan===

The Great Hall (also known as the Concert Hall) is the largest room, rectangular in shape, and occupies the centre of the building with an organ on its north wall. Two long corridors flank the east and west walls of the Great Hall. To the north of the Concert Hall is the Civil Court and beyond this is the North Entrance Hall; above this, reached by two staircases, is the elliptical Small Concert Room. To the south of the Great Hall is the Crown Court, beyond this is the South Entrance Hall above which reached by two staircases is the Grand Jury Room. In the middle of the west front is the Law Library, to the north of this is the Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s Court, to the south of the Law Library is the Sheriff&#x27;s Court. The floor below consists of a cavernous basement with cells for prisoners along the west wall.

===Exterior===
The main entrance is in the centre of the east façade and is approached by a wide flight of steps. On the steps is a statue of Benjamin Disraeli by Charles Bell Birch, moved here to make way for Liverpool&#x27;s cenotaph. At the south-east corner is a bronze statue of Major-General William Earle by the same sculptor. This front has a central portico of 16 Corinthian columns flanked on each side by series of square, unfluted columns, between which are reliefs that were added between 1882 and 1901 by Thomas Stirling Lee, C. J. Allen and Conrad Dressler. The west front has a projecting central part with square columns supporting a large entablature. The north front has a semicircular apse with columns and three doorways that are flanked by statues of nereids or tritons bearing a cornucopia with lamps attached, the central doors on the south and east fronts have similar statues, and were sculpted by William Nicholl.

The south front has an octastyle portico (eight columns wide), two columns deep, on steps above a rusticated podium. On the south portico entablature is a classical Latin inscription using V where U would now be used, that reads ‘ARTIBVS LEGIBVS CONSILIIS LOCVM MVNICIPES CONSTITVERVNT ANNO DOMINI MDCCCXLI’ (For Arts, Law and Counsel the townspeople built this place in 1841). 

The tympanum in the pediment above the south portico once contained sculptures of Britannia enthroned at the centre protecting agriculture and the arts and offering an olive branch to the four quarters of the globe, carved by William Nicholl; 

The completed sculpture has the following written description:

These sculptures were removed for safety&#x27;s sake in 1950 (the sculptures having become unsafe due to erosion by atmospheric pollution), and subsequently lost, reputedly turned into hardcore.

===Interior===

The main entrance crosses a corridor and leads into the Great Hall. This measures by and is high. The inspiration for the Great Hall are the Baths of Caracalla. The roof is a tunnel vault, built of hollow brick was designed by Robert Rawlinson completed 1849, it is carried on eight columns, in height, of polished red Cairngall granite, these reduce the span to , the spandrels contain allegorical plaster work angels, twelve in total, designed by Cockerell, representing fortitude, prudence, science, art, justice and temperance etc. The vault also decorated with plaster work by Cockerell, contains coffering, the centres of the main coffers have coat of arms of Liverpool, or the coats of arms of Lancashire or St George and the dragon, in the centre of the vault are the Royal Arms used by Queen Victoria this is above a matching coat of arms in the Minton floor. The walls have niches for statues. The highly decorated floor consists of Minton encaustic tile and it is usually covered by a removable floor to protect it. It contains over 30,000 tiles. The doors are bronze and have openwork panels which incorporate the letters SPQL (the Senate and the People of Liverpool) making an association with the SPQR badge of ancient Rome. The ten brass and bronze chandeliers in the Great Hall, designed by Cockerell, originally powered by town gas weigh 15 cwt, are decorated with prows of ships, heads of Neptune and Liver birds.

The organ is at the north end and at the south end is a round arch supporting an entablature between whose columns is a gate leading directly into the Crown Court. The niches contain the statues of William Roscoe by Chantrey, Sir William Brown by Patrick MacDowell, Robert Peel by Matthew Noble, George Stephenson by John Gibson, Hugh Boyd M‘Neile by George Gamon Adams, Edward Whitley by A. Bruce Joy, S. R. Graves by G. G. Fontana, Rev Jonathan Brookes by B. E. Spence, William Ewart Gladstone by John Adams-Acton, the 14th Earl of Derby by William Theed the Younger, the 16th Earl of Derby by F. W. Pomeroy, and Joseph Mayer by Fontana. In 2012 a statue of Kitty Wilkinson by Simon Smith was unveiled, the first in 101 years, and the first of a woman. The stained glass in the semicircular windows at each end of the hall was added in 1883–84 by Forrest and Son of Liverpool. Sharples and Pollard regard this as &quot;one of the greatest Victorian interiors&quot;.

The Crown Court has a tunnel vault on red granite columns and the Civil Court a coved ceiling on grey granite columns. The South Entrance Hall is approached through the portico, is low and has Ionic columns. Below this is a larger vaulted space which was adapted to form a new entrance in 2003–05. The North Entrance Hall has Doric columns on its landing and a Doric ambulatory around the apse with two bronze Torchères by Messengers of Birmingham decorated with allegorical scenes, the apse contains stairs, unlike the other main entrances where the stairs are external. A copy in plaster of part of the Parthenon frieze runs round its walls. In the centre of the south wall is a marble statue of Henry Booth shown standing up, carved 1874 by William Theed the Younger, placed here in 1877, flanking the statue are sculptures of caryatids.
The Small Concert Room designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and completed in 1856, is elliptical measuring by , when built it had a capacity for 1,100 people, the stage is by , and is lavishly decorated. In the past it was known as the Golden Concert Room. A balcony supported by caryatids runs round the room. At the back of the platform are attached columns, decorated with arabesques, supporting a frieze with griffins and between the columns are mirrors. The concert room was refurbished between 2000 and 2007. This included making alterations to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act, restoring the historical painting scheme and restoring the chandelier, which consists of 2,824 crystal pieces. It has seating for an audience of 480.

===Ventilation and heating of the building===

In the basement is part of a unique heating and ventilation system devised by Dr Boswell Reid. This was the first attempt at providing air conditioning in a public building in the United Kingdom, its aim being to warm and ventilate the building without draughts. Air drawn in via two shafts at either end of the eastern portico was warmed by five hot water pipes, that were heated by two coke-fired boilers and two steam boilers, these latter two were only used in extremely cold weather. The air was circulated by four fans wide driven by a 10 horsepower steam engine. In hot weather the air was cooled using cold mains water, small fountains in the air shafts cooling the incoming air. The air from the system entered the Great Hall via grilles at the back of the sculpture niches and in the risers of the seating tiers in the Small Concert Hall, stale air was drawn out through grilles in the ceilings. The air flow was controlled by a large number of workers opening and closing a series of canvas flaps via ropes and pulleys, though the court rooms had valves beneath the benches that could be controlled by the occupants. The system treated different parts of the building as zones allowing separate heating. In 2005 the Heritage Group of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers awarded its first Blue Plaque to St George&#x27;s Hall recognising it as the World&#x27;s First Air Conditioned Building.
===Assizes===
Until 1984 the Liverpool Assizes (later the Crown Court) were held in the courtroom at the southern end of St George&#x27;s Hall. Notable cases heard include those of Florence Maybrick in 1889 and William Herbert Wallace in 1931. The court now often doubles for the Old Bailey in film and TV dramas.
==Events held at the building==

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited St George&#x27;s Hall on 9 October 1851, although complete externally work was still underway internally. The inaugural event opened by the mayor and borough council and was started on 18 September 1854, and was a three-day festival of music, followed on 22 September, with the British Association for the Advancement of Science holding the first of many meetings at the Hall. On 15 April 1857 a banquet for 800 people was held in honour of William Brown benefactor of Liverpool&#x27;s museum and library. On 23 April 1864 a Fancy Dress ball was held in aid of St Ann &#x27;s Dispensary. The Small Concert Room it was regularly host to Charles Dickens, who held many of his readings there. Prior to Dickens sailing to America a banquet was hosted in the Great Hall for him on 10 April 1869. A cross section of activities in the 1880s include 24 March 1886, evening concert in an aid of District Cotton Porters and Dock Labourers; 1 November 1886 Large Hall, benevolent fund Liverpool Operative Platerworkers&#x27; Association; 5 April 1887 &#x27;Special&#x27; Grand Jury Room. To exhibit the new and improved method of applying gas to high class cookery; 22 December 1888, Large Hall, People&#x27;s concert, Messiah.

During the 1911 Liverpool general transport strike, many meetings were held there, including the rally which sparked the &#x27;Bloody Sunday&#x27; attacks, when police baton charged thousands of people who had gathered to hear the syndicalist Tom Mann speak.
On 15 March 1915 Lord Kitchener inspect 12,000 soldiers of the Liverpool Pals on St George&#x27;s Plateau, by September 1914, more than 30,000 men had enlisted at St George&#x27;s Hall. The Plateau has been associated with public rallies and gatherings, including events following the deaths of the Beatles members John Lennon and George Harrison, and the homecomings of Liverpool and Everton football teams after Cup Final victories.

The opening of the European Capital of Culture celebrations in 2008 saw Ringo Starr play on the roof of the building to over 50,000 people. The Weeping Window sculpture was displayed at St George&#x27;s Hall from 7 November 2015 to 17 January 2016, it was made from ceramic poppies from Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red. The commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster saw from 13 April 2019 nine banners hung from the front of St George&#x27;s Hall, featuring the images of the 96 who lost their lives, along with the powerful words ‘Never Forgotten’ on the Monday morning 15 April 96 lanterns were lit on the steps of the Hall, and members of the public paid their respects and left tributes.

The hall hosted the semi-final allocation draw for the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 on 31 January 2023.

==Organ and organists==

The organ was built by Henry Willis and completed in 1855 with 100 speaking stops across four manual divisions (of non-standard compass, 63 notes GG to a) and pedals (30 notes). It comprised a total of 119 ranks of pipes, plus 10 couplers, 10 composition pedals, and 36 pistons to set combinations of stops. It was initially tuned to meantone temperament to the specification of S. S. Wesley but in 1867 W. T. Best, city organist, had it retuned to equal temperament. The organ was rebuilt in 1896 when the key action was changed from the Willis-Barker lever assisted tracker (i.e. pneumatic assisted mechanical) action to pneumatic action. Also the manual compass was changed to the now standard CC to c, 61 notes, making the bottom 5 pipes on every manual stop redundant.

In 1931 the organ was reconstructed by Henry Willis III when the number of stops was increased to 120 and electro-pneumatic action introduced for the combination systems and some of the key action. Its power source was still the Rockingham electric blowing plant which had replaced the two steam engines (one of 1855 and a second which had been added in about 1877 to run the increased pressure required since 1867 for some reed stops. In the interim this higher pressure had been hand blown!) The 1924 electric blowers remained in use until 2000 when the present new low and high pressure blowers were fitted by David Wells.

In 1979 it was given a general clean and overhaul by Henry Willis IV. The total number of registers, including 24 couplers, is 144. With 7,737 pipes, it was the largest organ in the country until a larger one was built at the Royal Albert Hall in 1871, after which an organ even larger than the one at the Royal Albert Hall was constructed at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral, using over 10,000 pipes. Repairs were made to the organ as part of the restoration of the hall in 2000–2007, including replacement of the bellows leather. The organ is maintained by David Wells, Organ Builders.

The first organist was W. T. Best (1826–97) who was appointed in 1855 and served until 1894. He was succeeded in 1896 by Dr Albert Lister Peace (1844–1912) who continued in the post until the year of his death. In 1913 Herbert Frederick Ellingford (1876–1966) was appointed organist. On 21 December 1940 the hall and its organ were damaged in an air-raid. It was not possible to obtain sufficient money to rebuild the organ until the 1950s. In 1954 Henry Willis &amp; Sons were asked to undertake this project and Dr Caleb E. Jarvis (1903–1980) was its consultant. Dr Jarvis was appointed organist in 1957 and on his death in 1980 he was succeeded by Noel Rawsthorne (1929–2019), who had just retired as organist to the Anglican Cathedral. Noel Rawsthorne served as organist to the hall for four years. Following his retirement in 1984, Professor Ian Tracey, who is also Organist Titulaire of the Anglican Cathedral, was appointed to the post.

==St George&#x27;s Plateau==

This is the flat space between the hall and the railway station and contains statues of four lions by Nicholl and cast iron lamp standards with dolphin bases. Also on the plateau are monuments, including equestrian bronzes of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria by Thomas Thornycroft, and a monument to Major-General William Earle by Birch. Between the equestrian statues is the Grade I Liverpool Cenotaph which was unveiled in 1930, designed by L. B. Budden and sculpted by H. Tyson Smith. It consists of a simple horizontal block with a bronze relief measuring over on each side. Sharples and Pollard regard it as one of the most remarkable war memorials in the country.

In 2017 Liverpool City Council announced a £45m programme to re-design several major streets in the city centre, including Lime Street which would involve expanding the plateau. The work is timetabled to be completed by winter 2021.

==Restoration==

Following the restoration leading to the reopening of the hall in April 2007 it was granted a Civic Trust Award. It included the creation of a Heritage Centre which gives an introduction to the hall and its history. Guided tours, a programme of exhibitions and talks are arranged. Over the Christmas periods of 2007 and 2008 an artificial skating rink was installed in the Concert Hall. In January 2008 Liverpool started its tenure as European Capital of Culture with the People&#x27;s Opening at St George&#x27;s Hall with a performance which included the Beatles&#x27; drummer Ringo Starr playing on its roof. The building has since been regularly used as a stage and backdrop for major civic and cultural events, from the city&#x27;s Christmas Markets to the World War 1 tribute Weeping Window in 2015 and the Liverpool Giants in 2014 and 2018.

==As a filming location==
The exterior of St George&#x27;s Hall has been used a filming location for several films and television series, including the BBC series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; and &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, the 1993 film &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;, and the 2022 film &quot;The Batman&quot;. A 1987 advertisement for Coca-Cola was filmed inside the building.

St George&#x27;s Hall was the main hub for the paranormal investigation show &quot;Most Haunted Live&quot; which based their January 2009 &quot;Search for Evil&quot; live event from the hall. The live events ran for a full week, running from Saturday 10 January 2009 until Friday 16 January 2009. The Most Haunted Live team investigated the alleged paranormal activities in the hall, as well as other locations across the north west. The hall was the main studio hub and interactive hub for this special live event which aired on the satellite/cable channel Living TV.

On 31 January 2023, St George&#x27;s Hall hosted the semi-final allocation draw for the Eurovision Song Contest, which was held in Liverpool later in the year. The draw was broadcast live on BBC television and YouTube.

==Quotes about St George&#x27;s Hall==
&quot;This magnificent edifice will be a perennial monument of the energy and public spirit, in the nineteenth century, of the people of Liverpool; a place which of all the cities and towns in the British Empire is surpassed only by the metropolis in magnitude, wealth and importance; and which in the quick yet solid growth of its commercial greatness surpasses even the metropolis itself&quot;. The Illustrated London News 23 September 1854

&quot;The combination of a magnificent interior with an even grander exterior, is an achievement of which ancient Rome itself could offer no parallel, for however splendid and well organised were the interiors of the great thermae, basilicas and other structures, we have nothing to show that the exteriors of their buildings ever reached the same level of coherence and dignity. Indeed, all the remains point in the other direction. Hence the real greatness of Elmes&#x27; achievement&quot;. Charles Herbert Reilly

&quot;The south end of St. George&#x27;s Hall is quite conventional and rather resembles Donaldson&#x27;s project for the Royal Exchange. Except for the superior proportions and the splendid pile of steps at the base (by Cockerell) - which rise however, much too abruptly from an exiguous terrace along St. John&#x27;s Lane- this porticoed and pedimented facade is, in fact not very different from Tite&#x27;s at the Exchange. The north end is not identical but has a semicircular projection housing the Concert Room in the first storey. The different treatment of the two ends hardly ever seen at once either from the east or west. The extreme severity of the rounded north end is quite out of accord with the new visual tastes of the Victorian Age for sharpened accents and complex rhythms. The podium below is barely broken by the simple frames of the two entrance doors (this is an error there are three doors at the north end); the parapet above is absolutely continuous and unornamented. Thus there is no central focus of interest and nothing to distract attention from the even half-circle of giant Corinthian columns. 

The unbroken length of the east portico is surmounted by an equally unbroken attic masking the vault of the main hall. Thus the effect is even more severe. Ranges of square pilasters, for two-thirds of their height, are used here along the side wings. Such pilasters also rise like an open screen in the projecting middle section of the west front. These novel members provide a very interesting kind of structural articulation recalling the more original aspects of Schinkel&#x27;s Classicism as much as the long east portico does that of his more conventional Altes Museum. Though the tremendous scale of the composition is new to Britain, the spirit is still that of the classical rationalism which dominated the end of the 18th century. The great scale and general severity reflect the dreams of French architects like Ledoux and Boulée in the Revolutionary epoch, dreams that were codified by Durand in his &quot;Précis des leçons d&#x27;architecture données à l&#x27;École royale polytechnique&quot; (1802–05) and thus transmitted to a later generation. Behind and between the columnar and pseudo-columnar elements which dominate the facades the wall surfaces are rather flat. The relief of the various panels articulating these surfaces and that of the rare window frames is very low. Windows are completely suppressed on the south and the east fronts; the mouldings throughout, though large in size because of the tremendous scale, are extremely refined, cold and quite unornamented.&quot; 
Henry-Russell Hitchcock

The following is about the Small Concert Hall:
&quot;Exquisite in color and covered with most elegant decoration in low relief, this room is above all a masterly exercise in the use of those &#x27;shams&#x27; Camdenians most abominated. The balconies are of cast iron designed to look like some sort of woven wickerwork; of iron also are the pierced ventilating grilles along the front of the stage and in the ceiling panels around the central skylight. The delicate arabesques of the pilasters and friezes are papier-mâché. The graceful caryatids, seemingly sustaining the balcony on their fingertips, must be of iron or some synthetic composition; they were certainly never carved in stone. Whether these are themselves supports or whether the balcony is cantilevered on iron beams, the real construction is concealed. The wall panels not of wood but of plaster, supebly [sic] grained and varnished. Only the mirrors between the columns on the stage are what they seem; yet by a final paradox they create a faery unreality by their repeated reflection.&quot; Henry-Russell Hitchcock

&quot;Judging from his numerous perspective sketches, Elmes had the ability to rapidly design a building in perspective; not only did he prepare numerous sketches of the exterior, but also perspective views of the interior of the great loggia, and various other features. His full-size details, although Classic in spirit, are essentially modern in character; every suite of mouldings received due consideration as to its placing, and its ultimate relation to the scheme as a whole. Nothing could surpass the beauty of the Neo-Grec ornament selected for terminating the dominating attic. The whole building fulfils the highest canons of the academic style, and is unsurpassed by any other modern building in Europe. Albert Richardson

<text>Rodolfo Amando (or Rudolph Amandus) Philippi (14 September 1808 – 23 July 1904) was a German–Chilean paleontologist and zoologist. Philippi contributed primarily to malacology and paleontology, but also published a major work on Diptera of Chile. His grandson, Rodulfo Amando Philippi Bañados (1905-1969), was also a zoologist and in order to avoid confusion in zoological nomenclature, the elder is referred to as &quot;Philippi [Krumwiede]&quot; to distinguish him from his grandson &quot;Philippi [Bañados]&quot;.

== Early life ==
Philippi was born in Charlottenburg, Berlin to Johann Wilhelm Eberhard Philippi, a Prussian government auditor, and his third wife Maria Anna Krumwiede (m. 1806). The father had five children from two earlier marriages and Philippi was the eldest from the third marriage. In 1818, Philippi, his younger brother Bernhard Eunom (1811–1852) and their mother went to Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland, where they were educated at the Pestalozzian Institute founded by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746–1827). The teaching included the use of natural objects for teaching and Philippi was involved in collecting plants and butterflies at a young age. The move was caused by an affair of their father with the housekeeper and led to the separation of the parents. The three returned to Berlin in 1822 where Philippi went to the Königliche Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster (founded in 1574) and in 1826 he moved to the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin and graduated in 1830. His studies included medicine, surgery, comparative anatomy, botany and zoology. His dissertation was on the orthoptera of Berlin (&quot;Orthoptera Berolinensia&quot;). Respiratory illness forced him to leave Berlin in 1830 to warmer parts of Italy where he travelled around with the geologists Friedrich Hoffmann and Arnold Escher von der Lind who were studying Etna and Vesuvius. Philippi began to look at fossils here. He also collected molluscs and interacted with the Italian Benedictine priest and malacologist Emiliano Guttadauro (1759–1836) who encouraged him to study molluscs. He returned briefly to Berlin to complete his medical studies and qualified as a physician in 1833. He then worked as a teacher at Kassel from 1835. In 1836 he married a cousin, Caroline Krumwiede, who came from a well-to-do family and hoped that the means would let him study molluscs.

==Early career==
His first major work on molluscs based on his collections from Sicily was published in 1836. For this work, he received a medal from Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm III thanks to a recommendation from Alexander von Humboldt. Along with 14 others, he founded the Vereins für Naturkunde (Natural History Society) of Kassel the same year. In 1837 he was diagnosed with pneumonia and told that he had to move to a drier climate. He then moved to Sicily living there for several years, recovering his health. He began to collect molluscs in earnest, making use of a collector trained by Italian malacologist Arcangelo Scacchi (1810–1893). In 1840 he returned to Kassel, with a stop in Neuchâtel where he met Louis Agassiz. At Kassel, he interacted with the local malacologists who included Karl Menke, who had begun the first journal in German, &quot;Zeitschrift für Malakozoologie&quot; in 1844. This led to an increased productivity, and he wrote several books including &quot;Abbildungen&quot; (illustrated monographs), leading to a medal from the new King, Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm IV. His brother Bernhard Eunom Philippi in the meantime became a successful merchant and sailed to Chile several times, making collections for museums. Bernhard moved to Chile in 1841 and encouraged Germans to emigrate to Punta Arenas, an area that he helped seize control of, and had been made a governor of the Magellan Province.

==Move to Chile==
Philippi was caught up in the German revolutions of 1848-1849 and was seen as a liberal and threatened. He escaped Kassel with help from another malacologist Friedrich Carl Ludwig Koch (1799–1852), whose daughter had been engaged to Bernhard. He stayed underground in Karlshütte (near Delligsen, Lower Saxony) and left Germany on 20 July 1851 aboard the &quot;Bonito.&quot; He left the rest of his family behind and received letters of introduction from Alexander von Humboldt to aid his travels in Chile. Bernhard was killed in Punta Arenas in 1852. Philippi directed a high school in Valdivia from 1853 and he was also appointed professor of zoology and botany at the Universidad de Chile (Santiago), as well as director of the natural history museum there. He was also sent on an expedition into the Atacama Desert. Philippi&#x27;s wife and children moved to Chile in 1856 but his wife died in 1867 and two children died young. He worked on several books on natural history in Chile and collaborated with travelling European naturalists like Christian Ludwig Landbeck as well as with museums in Europe. Philippi received an honorary doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1890 and a second one in 1900. On his 90th birthday, a celebration was held in his honour at the university with the military band playing Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. Philippi described a number of species across taxa, including three new species of South American lizards. It was shortly after completing a monograph on the Chilean frogs in 1904 that he was diagnosed with pneumonia, leading to his death. A state holiday was announced the next day and his body was kept for public viewing and was visited by 10000 people. The 284-horse-drawn cortege was lined along its route by 30,000 people including schoolchildren and the entire Chilean parliament and cabinet were in attendance. He was buried in the Santiago Catholic Church where Philippi, as being Lutheran, was buried in a corner called the Patio de Disidentes.

==Legacy==
Philippi described more than 2500 new taxa of molluscs (both extant and fossil) in 40 genera and three families, and more than 425 new species of Diptera. A species of snake, &quot;Tropidodipsas philippii&quot;, is named in his honor. In 1897, botanist Carlos Luigi Spegazzini published &quot;Philippiella&quot;, a monotypic genus of flowering plants from Argentina and Chile, belonging to the family Thymelaeaceae named after him. Museo de la Exploración Rudolph Amandus Philippi in Valdivia is named after him.

Philippi&#x27;s youngest son, Federico Philippi (1838–1910), was also a zoologist and botanist.

<text>Black Bear Road or Black Bear Pass, and officially Forest Service Road 648, is a dirt road that starts from the summit of Red Mountain Pass on U.S. Highway 550 (between Ouray and Silverton) to Telluride, Colorado. The road crests at Black Bear Pass, elevation , and descends over a set of switchbacks as it navigates the heights above Telluride. The road passes Bridal Veil Falls, the highest waterfall in Colorado. In 1975, the road was the subject of a spoken-word song and album of the same title by country musician C. W. McCall.

Black Bear Road is open a few months of the year, from late summer (usually the last week of July) to early fall. The road is traveled only downhill from Red Mountain Pass — except for the annual Jeeper&#x27;s Jamboree in which travel is reversed for one day only. The start of the trail was formerly marked along U.S. 550 with a sign that read:
After repeated thefts of the sign, the local authorities stopped replacing it.
