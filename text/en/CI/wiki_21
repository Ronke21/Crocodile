<text>Colin Ivor Moulding (born 17 August 1955) is an English bassist, singer, and songwriter who was one of the core members of the rock band XTC. Moulding wrote their first three charting UK singles: &quot;Life Begins at the Hop&quot; (1979), &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; (1979) and &quot;Generals and Majors&quot; (1980).

==Life and career==
Moulding is self-taught as a bass player; he was learning rock riffs at the age of 15. He cites Andy Fraser of Free as an early musical influence, and has stated a preference for an intuitive approach to writing and playing rather than study. When writing songs Moulding has used guitars and keyboards rather than the bass guitar.

Outside his work with XTC (and their alter-ego side project The Dukes of Stratosphear), Moulding released a non-charting solo single (&quot;Too Many Cooks in the Kitchen&quot; b/w &quot;I Need Protection&quot;) in 1980 under the pseudonym &quot;The Colonel&quot;.

In 1986, David Gilmour approached Moulding over becoming Pink Floyd&#x27;s new bass player following Roger Waters&#x27; departure. He turned it down as XTC were in the midst of recording &quot;Skylarking&quot;.

He later played bass and co-produced one track on the 1994 Sam Phillips album &quot;Martinis and Bikinis&quot;, and in 2005, he contributed to Billy Sherwood&#x27;s Pink Floyd tribute album &quot;Return to the Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, playing bass and singing lead vocal on &quot;Brain Damage&quot;.

In 1995, Moulding contributed bass on several tracks of French band L&#x27;Affaire Louis&#x27; Trio&#x27;s album &quot;L&#x27;Homme aux mille vies&quot;.

In February 2007, Partridge told music website Pitchfork Media that Moulding was &quot;not interested in music any more, and doesn&#x27;t want to write&quot;. Moulding concurred in having a recent loss of interest in music. 

In November 2008, he emerged for an interview about &quot;Making Plans For Nigel&quot; for an installment in the series of interviews by Todd Bernhardt. He gave a two-hour interview in December on the Todd Rundgren fansite, &quot;Rundgren Radio&quot;.

Moulding made vocal contributions to a Billy Sherwood progressive rock album (&quot;The Prog Collective&quot;, August 2012), combining with Rick Wakeman on &quot;Check Point Karma&quot;. He performed a lead vocal for the song &quot;The Man Who Died Two Times&quot; from the album &quot;In Extremis&quot; by the progressive rock band Days Between Stations (released 15 May 2013) and appears in the video for the song, released in June 2014. 

In 2012, he appeared on Sherwood&#x27;s tribute album to Supertramp.

Moulding played bass on &quot;High Noon&quot;, a track on Anton Barbeau&#x27;s 2016 release &quot;Magic Act&quot;, and contributed vocals to the title track of &quot;Little World&quot;, a 2016 collaboration between Barbeau and Sacramento singer Allyson Seconds. Moulding also appeared in both the &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;Little World&quot; videos.

In 2017, Moulding and former XTC drummer Terry Chambers recorded an EP titled &quot;Great Aspirations&quot; that was credited to &quot;TC&amp;I&quot;. It was released on 20 October 2017. In October/November 2018 TC&amp;I, featuring Moulding, Chambers, Steve Tilling, Gary Bamford, Susannah Bevington and Moulding&#x27;s son Lee, played a series of six gigs at the Swindon Arts Centre. The sets consisted of a selection of Moulding&#x27;s songs from XTC&#x27;s career plus material from the TC&amp;I EP and a cover of Andy Partridge&#x27;s &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot;. Highlights of the concerts were released in August 2019 on CD and in download format under the title &#x27;Naked Flames: Live at Swindon Arts Centre&#x27;.

<text>XL Recordings is a British independent record label founded in 1989 by Tim Palmer and Nick Halkes. It has been run and co-owned by Richard Russell since 1996. It forms part of the Beggars Group.

It releases an average of six albums a year. The label releases albums worldwide and operates across a range of genres.

==History==
===1980s and 1990s===
Originally launched in 1989 to release rave and dance music, the label began as an imprint of Beggars Banquet&#x27;s more commercial dance label Citybeat, which was known for records by acts such as Freeez, Rob Base &amp; EZ Rock, Starlight, Dream Frequency and the Ultramagnetic MCs. However, with the success of acts such as the Prodigy and SL2, XL superseded Citybeat in its lineup.

During the early 1990s, XL releases were dance-oriented, ranging from Belgian techno (T99&#x27;s &quot;Anasthasia&quot;) to breakbeat hardcore (SL2&#x27;s &quot;On a Ragga Tip&quot;) to drum and bass (Jonny L&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Leavin&#x27;&quot;). This period of XL&#x27;s history has been recorded on the &quot;XL Recordings Chapters&quot; compilation series. In 1993, Halkes left XL to form the EMI-owned commercial dance label Positiva, and subsequently his own independent commercial dance label Incentive. After Palmer retired in 1996, Russell took over the business.

Russell later broadened the label&#x27;s musical horizons, whilst maintaining a credo of working with artists he saw as original and inventive. In 1994, the label released the Prodigy&#x27;s second album, &quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; which debuted atop the UK Albums Chart, and in 1997 it released the group&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; which entered atop the British and American charts and went on to be number one in 26 countries.

===2000s===
June 2000 saw the release of Badly Drawn Boy&#x27;s &quot;The Hour of Bewilderbeast&quot; which won the 2000 Mercury Music Prize. The next year, the White Stripes&#x27; third album &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; was released together with reissues of the band&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;The White Stripes&quot; and &quot;De Stijl&quot;. In 2003, XL Recordings won the &quot;Music Week&quot; A&amp;R award, and also released the White Stripes&#x27; fourth album &quot;Elephant&quot; which was their first UK number one album and eventually reached double platinum certification in Britain. That same year, XL released Dizzee Rascal&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Boy in da Corner&quot; for which Dizzee was awarded the Mercury Prize for the best album of 2003.

In March 2005, M.I.A.&#x27;s debut album &quot;Arular&quot; was released after several months&#x27; delay. Thom Yorke, from Radiohead, released his first solo record, &quot;The Eraser&quot;, on the label in July 2006. In October 2007, Radiohead completed negotiations to sign with XL for physical release of their seventh studio album, &quot;In Rainbows&quot;. Radiohead subsequently went on to release through XL, and have so far released everything since their eighth studio album &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; on the label. As director of XL Recordings, Richard Russell was included in a 2007 &quot;Evening Standard&quot; list of the most influential people in London, and in August of that year M.I.A.&#x27;s second album &quot;Kala&quot; was released—Rolling Stone named it the ninth best album of the decade.

In March 2008, XL added Friendly Fires and the Horrors. In 2009 the label won the &quot;Music Week&quot; Best Independent Label award; Adele won the awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards, and at the same ceremony Radiohead won Best Alternative Album for &quot;In Rainbows&quot; as well as Best Boxed or Special Edition Album. Also in 2009, the xx&#x27;s debut album &quot;xx&quot; was released on XL Recordings partner label Young, and in September Giggs was signed.

===2010s===
On 11 January 2010, XL Recordings released Vampire Weekend&#x27;s second album &quot;Contra&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album to top the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s thirteenth studio album &quot;I&#x27;m New Here&quot; was released in February; it was Scott-Heron&#x27;s first release of original material in sixteen years and would ultimately be his last studio album before his death the following May. Recording sessions for the album took place between 2007 and 2009 and production was handled by XL Recordings-owner Richard Russell.

In July, XL signed Jai Paul, who was shortlisted for BBC&#x27;s Sound of 2011, and in September the xx&#x27;s eponymous debut album won the Barclaycard Mercury Prize, acquiring best British and Irish album of the year.

On 24 January 2011, XL Recordings released the album &quot;21&quot; by Adele. In February the (then) 19-year-old OFWGKTA member Tyler, the Creator was signed for a one-album deal for his debut studio album and commercial debut &quot;Goblin&quot;. Singer Gil Scott-Heron died in May and his final recordings, &quot;I&#x27;m New Here&quot; (produced by Richard Russell), and the remix album, &quot;We&#x27;re New Here&quot; made with Jamie xx were released on XL Recordings. The label also released new albums by Radiohead, Friendly Fires, and the Horrors and singles by Jai Paul and Portishead, as well as the Adele Blu-ray/DVD, &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;.

On 24 April 2012, XL released &quot;Blunderbuss&quot;, the debut solo record by Jack White. It entered the UK album charts at number one, displacing &quot;21&quot; by Adele.
In 2012, XL Recordings was named &#x27;Label of the Year&#x27; at the Music Week Awards in London. XL also won awards for &#x27;Best A&amp;R&#x27; and &#x27;Best Artist Campaign&#x27;. Label head, Richard Russell, became the youngest ever recipient of the lifetime achievement &#x27;Strat Award&#x27;.

Sales of Adele&#x27;s &quot;21&quot; helped increase XL Recordings&#x27; bank balance from £3 million to £32 million over 12 months. As of March 2011, XL Recordings had released three albums that had sold over a million copies in the UK: The Prodigy&#x27;s &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot;, Adele&#x27;s &quot;19&quot;, and Adele&#x27;s &quot;21&quot;.

In April 2016, Radiohead&#x27;s Parlophone albums transferred to XL Recordings. A month later, on 8 May, the band released their ninth studio album, &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot;, through XL to critical acclaim.

== XL Studio ==
In early 2008, Russell transformed the rear garage of the label&#x27;s Ladbroke Grove headquarters into a small, in-house recording and mixing studio called XL Studio. It served as a makeshift studio space for the label&#x27;s various artists and his own projects until producer Rodaidh McDonald was assigned in September of that year to manage and properly equip it in preparation for the xx to record their self-titled debut album. According to McDonald, &quot;before Richard brought me in to be Studio Manager, it was just a bit of a free-for-all. Artists could come in and rehearse, demo or write here and things like that ... but it was good idea and we decided we should be stepping it up and making records here.&quot; Russell and McDonald were inspired by the success of modest studios such as Hitsville U.S.A. and wanted to create an economic, non-commercial space.

Set up specifically with the xx in mind, XL Studio features little outboard gear and is equipped with a Neotek Élan custom 24-channel mixing console, Yamaha NS10 studio monitors, and instruments that include an upright piano, Roland Juno-60, Moog Prodigy, Vox Continental organ, and Sequential Circuits Pro-One synthesizer. Russell and McDonald augmented the studio to twice its original size after the xx&#x27;s album, which was done in what became the studio&#x27;s control room; they incorporated an adjacent office as the studio&#x27;s live room for musicians.

In 2016, the WSDG completed the construction of a new recording studio in the basement of the XL Recordings offices in New York City.

<text>Frederick Feast (5 October 1929 – 25 June 1999) was a British television actor, best remembered for playing the role of Fred Gee in 552 episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; between 1976 and 1984.

==Early life==
He attended the Scarborough High School for Boys and served as a physical training instructor for the Parachute Regiment with the rank of sergeant. This led him to become an adviser on, and appear in, the 1954 British World War II film &quot;The Red Beret&quot;. He worked as a variety artist and stand-up comic at the Windmill Theatre and appeared in summer seasons and pantomimes. Other occupations included driving instructor, butcher, compere of a performing dolphin show, barman and carpet salesman.

==Early roles==
Feast acted in numerous television dramas throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, including the BAFTA winning ITV play &quot;Another Sunday and Sweet FA&quot;, written by Jack Rosenthal, and the first episode of the ITV series &quot;The Organization&quot;. He also had guest roles television dramas including &quot;Nearest and Dearest&quot;, &quot;Country Matters&quot;, &quot;South Riding&quot; and the mining drama &quot;Sam&quot; (1973). He appeared in the Ken Loach directed wartime series &quot;Days of Hope&quot; (1975), written by Jim Allen. Also in 1975, Feast appeared in the Granada Television daytime drama, &quot;Crown Court,&quot; playing the role of Frank Chadwick, a farmer whose wife stands trial on a charge of malicious wounding.

==&quot;Coronation Street&quot;==
Feast was best known for his role as the Rovers Return&#x27;s potman Fred Gee in the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, a role he played from 1976 to 1984. He had appeared briefly in the soap four years earlier, before being asked back in 1976 by new producer, Bill Podmore. In the story, landlady Annie Walker was advised by the brewery, Newton &amp; Ridley, that she needed a man to do the heavy work. Feast joined &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1976 after his character&#x27;s wife Edna died in a fire. The character was described in Feast&#x27;s &quot;Times&quot; obituary as the &quot;grumpiest barman in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, with a temperament to turn the very beer sour&quot;.

One of his best known storylines was when Fred took barmaids Bet Lynch and Betty Turpin out for a picnic in Annie Walker&#x27;s prized Rover 2000 in 1983, only to see the car roll into a lake. Another memorable storyline was when he got a wig and was roundly ridiculed by the Rovers regulars. In 1983, the fictional Fred married Eunice Nuttall in the hope that married status would improve his chances of having his own pub. After Annie Walker left, her son Billy returned and took over the tenancy. Fred ended up thumping Billy and lost his job. He then became a van driver for Mike Baldwin but was sacked and left the Street.

Feast departed abruptly from the serial in 1984, after 552 episodes. Podmore was reportedly furious at Feast&#x27;s refusal to sign a new contract after allegedly agreeing verbally to do so, or to allow storyline writers extra time to write his character out. &quot;The Times&quot; reported he left &quot;exhausted through overwork&quot;.

Feast was reportedly offended by &quot;Coronation Street&quot;&#x27;s shift towards more explicit sexual material. The programme, he thought, was sinking into the &quot;swamp of ordinary soap opera&quot;.

Fred Gee last appeared in the soap in November 1984. His departure was abrupt and his position at the Rovers was taken by Jack Duckworth (William Tarmey). When the character&#x27;s wife Eunice (Meg Johnson) made a brief return to the show in 1999, she mentioned that Fred had died of a heart attack in the interim.

==Later roles==
After leaving &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, Feast went on to play knackerman Jeff Mallock in a three-year stint in the BBC1 series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, taking over from Frank Birch.

Feast was dogged by ill health for most of the 1990s, and had a malignant tumour removed from his throat after cancer was diagnosed. He made a short-lived comeback starting in 1996 when Liz Dawn asked him to play the barman in her video &quot;Liz Dawn&#x27;s House Party.&quot; An appearance on the regional celebrity Yorkshire TV quiz show &quot;Cryer&#x27;s Crackers&quot; followed, as did a guest role in &quot;Heartbeat&quot; in 1998. The same year he took on the small role of pigeon fancier Arthur in the hit film &quot;Little Voice&quot;, set in Scarborough and starring Brenda Blethyn, Jane Horrocks, Ewan McGregor, Michael Caine and Jim Broadbent. Feast also appeared in pantomimes, and on television chat shows during his two-year return in the public eye.

==Death==
Feast died on 25 June 1999, aged 69, after his last illness which involved major abdominal surgery. This was less than six months after his character, Fred Gee, had been officially proclaimed as having died (offscreen) on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, though the character had not been seen onscreen for almost 15 years.

<text>The Autozam Scrum, later known as Mazda Scrum, is a cabover microvan and kei truck sold exclusively in Japan by Japanese automaker Mazda. Originally part of the company&#x27;s Autozam marque, it was first introduced in June 1989 (DG41, DH41 for 4WD versions). Mazda still sells the Scrum under its own name. The Scrum is a rebadged version of the Suzuki Carry/Every and used Suzuki engines. The first model year had 550-cc Suzuki F5B engines producing , or with an intercooled turbo; after only nine months, this generation was replaced by the larger-engined DG/DH51 (660 cc, , with a turbo) as the kei car standards were changed that year.

A passenger car version called the Scrum Wagon was added for 2000, while the commercial truck and van were updated.

The Mazda Scrum uses a 660-cc, three-cylinder engine in a variety of specifications including turbocharged, and is available with either four-wheel drive(4WD) or two-wheel drive (2WD). The 4WD version can also be switched between 4WD and 2WD and has high- and low-gear ranges.

The name &quot;scrum&quot; comes from a maneuver from the game of rugby, signifying toughness.

<doc id="1050383" wikidata="Q598441" url="?curid=1050383" title="King Street (Toronto)">
<text>King Street is a major east–west commercial thoroughfare in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was one of the first streets laid out in the 1793 plan of the town of York, which became Toronto in 1834.

After the construction of the Market Square in 1803 at King and Jarvis streets, to house the first St. Lawrence Market farmer&#x27;s market, the street became the primary commercial street of York and early Toronto. This original core was destroyed in the 1849 Great Fire of Toronto but was subsequently rebuilt. The original street extended from George Street to Berkeley Street and was extended by 1901 to its present terminuses (both with Queen Street) at Roncesvalles Avenue in the west and the Don River in the east.

==Description==
King Street&#x27;s western terminus is at an intersection with The Queensway to the west, Roncesvalles Avenue to the north, and Queen Street West to the east. King runs to the south-east briefly before curving to the east until just west of Parliament Street. There, it curves north-east until terminates at a merge with Queen Street East just west of the Don River and north of the Corktown Common. Prior to a realignment, Eastern Avenue was the East end of King Street and crossed the Don at the King Street Bridge (which has since been abandoned). Yonge Street, the north–south divider of many Toronto east–west streets, divides King Street into King Street East and King Street West.

Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame runs along King Street from John Street to Simcoe Street and south on Simcoe. It is a tribute in granite to Canadians who have gained fame in the fields of music, literature, journalism, dance, sports, acting, entertainment and broadcasting.

King Street West is considered Toronto&#x27;s Fashion District and is known for trendy restaurants, design shops and boutique condo developments. Previously industrial, this neighborhood has undergone considerable urban development since the early 2000s.

King Street East is predominantly known as the high-end, luxury furniture district of downtown Toronto, with dozens of stores on King Street and in the surrounding area.

, King Street is served along its entire length by two overlapping Toronto Transit Commission streetcar routes: the 504A King and the 504B King, which together are the busiest streetcar routes in the fleet, with an average ridership of 65,000 passengers per day. They connect with the Yonge–University subway line (Line 1) at St. Andrew station at University Avenue, and at King station at Yonge Street. They connect with the Bloor–Danforth subway line (Line 2) at Dundas West station and Broadview station. The street was also served by the 508 Lake Shore route until it was discontinued in June 2015. It was subsequently replaced by the 514 Cherry route in June 2016, which was then cancelled in October 2018 and replaced by the two 504 King branches.

===Transit mall===

The section of King Street between Bathurst Street and Jarvis Street is a transit mall with restrictions on how vehicles can use intersections. In the mall, trucks and cars are unable to continue straight through or turn left at intersections: they must turn right off of King Street. The road also has sidewalk cafes and public art pieces on the road. On April 16, 2019, the transit mall was made permanent.

==History==
In the original 1793 plan of the Town of York, King Street was the original name of the section of today&#x27;s Front Street from George Street east to Parliament Street. This was changed in 1797, when York was extended to the west. The original King Street became Palace Street, and Duke Street was renamed King Street. The new King Street was extended west to York Street. In 1798, King Street was extended further west, to Peter Street. In the 1837 westerly extension of Toronto, King Street was extended west to Garrison Creek. By this time, King Street was the main commercial east–west street of Toronto, having St. Lawrence Market at the intersection of King and New (or Nelson) (today&#x27;s Jarvis) streets, and an commercial core extending around the Market. In the 1849 Great Fire, much of the business core at King and Jarvis was destroyed. New commercial buildings were built. By 1901, King Street West was completed to its present-day intersection at Roncesvalles and Queen Streets.

In recent years there has been a proliferation of chic restaurants, clubs and galleries in the area as King Street West becomes more oriented to Toronto&#x27;s nightlife crowd, and is near major attractions such as the Rogers Centre (formerly SkyDome), Scotiabank Arena (formerly Air Canada Centre), the Distillery District, Hockey Hall of Fame, Roy Thomson Hall, Meridian Hall (formerly Sony Centre for the Performing Arts), St. Lawrence Market and the historic Omni King Edward Hotel.

<text>Audiology (from Latin &#x27;to hear&#x27;; and from Greek branch of learning , &quot;&quot;) is a branch of science that studies hearing, balance, and related disorders. Audiologists treat those with hearing loss and proactively prevent related damage. By employing various testing strategies (e.g. behavioral hearing tests, otoacoustic emission measurements, and electrophysiologic tests), audiologists aim to determine whether someone has normal sensitivity to sounds. If hearing loss is identified, audiologists determine which portions of hearing (high, middle, or low frequencies) are affected, to what degree (severity of loss), and where the lesion causing the hearing loss is found (outer ear, middle ear, inner ear, auditory nerve and/or central nervous system). If an audiologist determines that a hearing loss or vestibular abnormality is present, they will provide recommendations for interventions or rehabilitation (e.g. hearing aids, cochlear implants, appropriate medical referrals).

In addition to diagnosing audiologic and vestibular pathologies, audiologists can also specialize in rehabilitation of tinnitus, hyperacusis, misophonia, auditory processing disorders, cochlear implant use and/or hearing aid use. Audiologists can provide hearing health care from birth to end-of-life.

==Audiologist==
An audiologist is a health care provider specializing in identifying, diagnosing, treating, and monitoring disorders of the auditory and vestibular systems. Audiologists are trained to diagnose, manage and/or treat hearing, tinnitus, or balance problems. They dispense, manage, and rehabilitate hearing aids and assess candidacy for and map hearing implants, such as cochlear implants, middle ear implants and bone conduction implants. They counsel families through a new diagnosis of hearing loss in infants, and help teach coping and compensation skills to late-deafened adults. They also help design and implement personal and industrial hearing safety programs, newborn hearing screening programs, school hearing screening programs, and provide special or custom fitted ear plugs and other hearing protection devices to help prevent hearing loss. Audiologists are trained to evaluate peripheral vestibular disorders originating from pathologies of the vestibular portion of the inner ear. They also provide treatment for certain vestibular and balance disorders, such as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). In addition, many audiologists work as auditory or acoustic scientists in a research capacity.

Audiologists are trained in anatomy and physiology, hearing aids, cochlear implants, electrophysiology, acoustics, psychophysics and psychoacoustics, neurology, vestibular function and assessment, balance disorders, counseling and communication options such as sign language. Audiologists may also run a neonatal hearing screening program which has been made compulsory in many hospitals in US, UK and India.
An audiologist usually graduates with one of the following qualifications: BSc, MSc(Audiology), AuD, STI, PhD, or ScD, depending on the program and country attended.

==History==
The use of the terms &quot;audiology&quot; and &quot;audiologist&quot; in publications has been traced back only as far as 1946. The creator of the term remains unknown, but Berger identified possible originators as Mayer BA Schier, Willard B Hargrave, Stanley Nowak, Norman Canfield, or Raymond Carhart. In a biographical profile by Robert Galambos, Hallowell Davis is credited with coining the term in the 1940s, saying the then-prevalent term &quot;auricular training&quot; sounded like a method of teaching people how to wiggle their ears. The first US university course for audiologists was offered by Carhart at Northwestern University, in 1946.

Audiology was born of interdisciplinary collaboration. The substantial prevalence of hearing loss observed in the veteran population after World War II inspired the creation of the field as it is known today. The International Society of Audiology (ISA) was founded in 1952 to &quot;...facilitate the knowledge, protection and rehabilitation of human hearing&quot; and to &quot;...serve as an advocate for the profession and for the hearing impaired throughout the world.&quot; It promotes interactions among national societies, associations and organizations that have similar missions, through the organization of a biannual world congress, through the publication of the scientific peer-reviewed International Journal of Audiology and by offering support to the World Health Organization&#x27;s efforts towards addressing the needs of the hearing impaired and deaf community.

==Requirements==
The International Society of Audiology maintains , which is a portal in Wikiversity that provides information of audiology education and practice around the world. Summary information is provided below:

===Australia===
In Australia, Audiologists must hold a Master of Audiology, Master of Clinical Audiology, Master of Audiology Studies or alternatively a bachelor&#x27;s degree from overseas certified by the private agency Vocational Education, Training and Assessment Services (VETASSESS). Although audiologists in Australia are not required to be a member of any professional body, audiology graduates can undergo a clinical training program or internship leading to accreditation with Audiology Australia (AudA) or the Australian College of Audiology (ACAud) which involves supervised practice and professional development, and typically lasts one year.

To provide rehabilitative services to eligible pensioners, war veterans, and children and young adults under the age of 26 as part of the Hearing Services Program, an audiologist must hold a qualified practitioner (QP) number which can be sought by first obtaining accreditation.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, audiology training is part of speech pathology and audiology undergraduate, four-year courses. The University of São Paulo was the first university to offer a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and it started operations in 1977. At the federal level, the recognition of the educational programs and the profession of speech pathologist and audiologist took place on December 9, 1981, signed by President João Figueiredo (law no. 6965). The terms  &quot;audiology&quot; and  &quot;audiologist&quot; can be tracked in Brazilian publications since 1946. The work of audiologists in Brazil was described in 2007.

===Canada===
In Canada, a masters of science (MSc) is the minimum requirement to practice audiology in the country. The profession is regulated in New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, where it is illegal to practice without being registered as a full member in the appropriate provincial regulatory body.

===Bangladesh===
A BSc (Hons) in audiology and speech language pathology is required.

===India===
To practice audiology, professionals need to have either a bachelor&#x27;s or a master&#x27;s degree in audiology and be registered with Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI).

===Malaysia===
Three Malaysian educational institutions offer degrees in audiology.

===United Kingdom===
There are currently five routes to becoming a registered audiologist:
* FdSc in hearing aid audiology
* BSc in audiology
* MSc in audiology
* Fast-track conversion Diploma for those with a BSc in another relevant science subject, available at Southampton, Manchester, UCL, London, and Edinburgh
* BSc(Hons) in clinical physiology (audiology) available at Glasgow Caledonian University (all applicants must be NHS employees)

===United States===
In the United States, audiologists are regulated by state licensure or registration in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Starting in 2007, the doctor of audiology (AuD) became the entry-level degree for clinical practice for some states, with most states expected to follow this requirement very soon, as there are no longer any professional programs in audiology which offer the master&#x27;s degree. Minimum requirements for the AuD degree include a minimum of 75 semester hours of post-baccalaureate study, meeting prescribed competencies, passing a national exam offered by Praxis Series of the Educational Testing Service, and practicum experience that is equivalent to a minimum of 12 months of full-time, supervised experience. Most states have continuing education renewal requirements that must be met to stay licensed. Audiologists can also earn certification from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association or through the American Board of Audiology (ABA). Currently, there are over 70 AuD programs in the United States.

In the past, audiologists have typically held a master&#x27;s degree and the appropriate healthcare license. However, in the 1990s the profession began to transition to a doctoral level as a minimum requirement. In the United States, starting in 2007, audiologists were required to receive a doctoral degree (AuD or PhD) in audiology from an accredited university graduate or professional program before practicing. All states require licensing, and audiologists may also carry national board certification from the American Board of Audiology or a certificate of clinical competence in audiology (CCC-A) from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, a master&#x27;s or doctoral degree in audiology is required to practice this profession. This medical degree must come from a recognised institute, most of which are government, otherwise the person didn&#x27;t get the license to practice the audiology. Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) issues the practicing license to all the medical students. Besides these, the person who provides the medical instruments to these doctors should also have the certificate of accreditation, issued by the Pakistan National Accreditation Council (PNAC).

===Portugal===
The exercise of audiologist profession in Portugal necessarily imply the qualifications degree in audiology or legally equivalent as defined in Decree-Law 320/99 of August 11 Article 4.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, there are currently five institutions offering training in audiology. The institutions offer different qualifications that make one eligible for practicing audiology in South Africa. The qualifications are as follows, I) B. Audiology, II) BSc. Audiology, III) B. Communication Pathology (Audiology), and IV) B. Speech Language Pathology and Audiology (BSLP&amp;A). All practicing audiologists are required to be registered with the Health Professional Council of South Africa (HPCSA).
===Turkey===
Audiology in Turkey started in 1968 as an audiology master&#x27;s degree program at Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ear, Nose and Throat. The program, which was carried out as Audiology until 1989, has been revised since this year and continued as &quot;Audiology and Speech Disorders&quot; Master&#x27;s and Doctoral education. The first undergraduate program was opened in 2011, and as of 2011, Audiologist has become a profession defined and officially recognized by the state of the Republic of Turkey.

<text>The Autozam AZ-1, known by the framecode PG6SA, is a mid-engined kei-class sports car, designed and manufactured by Mazda under its Autozam brand. Suzuki provided the engine as well as the inspiration for the design.

Manufactured from October 1992 to October 1994, the AZ-1 was noted for its gullwing doors. Power came from the same Suzuki-sourced 657 cc turbocharged engine used by the Suzuki Alto that produced at 6,500 rpm and at 4,000 rpm.

Suzuki later produced its own badge engineered version named the Suzuki Cara (PG6SS).

==History==
===Pre-production===
====Suzuki prototypes====
The proposal for the AZ-1 goes as far back as 1985 when Suzuki created the &quot;Suzuki RS/1&quot; as a mid-engine sports car project for volume production. Suzuki&#x27;s design for the Tokyo Motor Show was a fully functional car with a front/rear weight distribution of 45:55, powered by a modified 1.3-liter G13B engine borrowed from the Cultus GTi.

This was followed up by the Tatsumi Fukunaga-designed RS/3, unveiled for the 1987 Tokyo Motor Show. This version of the car retained many of its design features of the predecessor, but many of its design features were modified to meet Japanese safety regulations as well as for practicality. However, the project was abandoned in favor of the roadster project they had been working on, named later the Cappuccino.

Mazda&#x27;s design team, led by Toshihiko Hirai, who was also responsible for the MX-5, took over the design project, despite having a limited budget and capacity.

====Mazda prototypes====
The redesigned cars, constructed in tube frame with floors and bulkheads constructed from aluminium honeycomb, clad in three different body styles constructed in fiberglass. The cars were constructed around the Kei car regulations of the time (maximum length , maximum engine capacity 550 cc), until this was changed for the following March, hence its model name, AZ-550 Sports.

First introduced at the 1989 Tokyo Motor Show as the AZ-550 with three versions.

The &quot;Type A&quot; is a red sports car with pop-up headlights, front air vent and gull-wing doors.

The &quot;Type B&quot;, themed as &quot;High-tuned pure sports&quot;, was inspired by the trends in the tuning industry and in current concept car design, featuring greenhouse pyramid roof without a rearward sweep to the C-pillar. It had a racing car inspired interior, unlike Type A, it was aiming for the rough and spartan look and was the only model that had a more conventional forward door hinging. It featured a pair of bulging headlamps and incorporated dual mufflers.

The &quot;Type C&quot;, has a more distinctive body design as it was inspired by Mazda&#x27;s Group C sports prototype racers, incorporating its signature colour scheme of blue on white and the number it bore at the 24 hours of Le Mans. Featuring a bigger air intake than the former two, venting to the forward-positioned radiator and exits it along the front rim of the cowl. There are many design cues typical to an endurance racer such as the wing mirror and BBS style brake-cooling wheel discs. Compared to the Type B, this version is far more spartan.

====Pre-production====
As the cars were well received by the visiting public and the motoring press, Mazda executives decided on production of the car. Although Type C was the better received of the three, Type A was given the green light by executives as they believed that it would be the one most commercially accepted by the buying public. The Type A would only receive a minor design alteration prior to production, as the pop-up headlights were dropped in favour of fixed units, purely for structural rigidity reasons. The front air vent was the other design alteration made to the car prior to production.

Nonetheless, the car took three years to get into production as the engineering team changed the car&#x27;s internal skeleton frame to steel to allow for further rigidity. The dashboard design was also changed, to a less futuristic but still sporting look.

Much of the development work was carried out in the United Kingdom, undergoing extensive testing at Lotus&#x27; Millbrook Proving Ground, despite the fact that the car was never intended for sale outside Japan.

===Production===
The car was made available to the buying public in January 1992, with two color options, Siberia blue and classic red. Both colors came with Venetian gray lower panels. Each car was sold through the Autozam dealer network in Japan.

Unfortunately by the time car came into production, the recession in Japan had just come into force. Selling for 1,498 million ¥ (the equivalent of $12,400), it was slightly less than a Eunos Roadster, but marginally higher than its competitor, the Honda Beat, selling at 1,388 million ¥ and the Suzuki Cappuccino at ¥1,458 million, the AZ-1 was considered to be both too expensive and too cramped for a kei car. The car failed to sell within its target of 800 per month, in the midst of an economic recession. Production of the car ended after the following year, but Mazda had plenty of stock to sell off.

With a total production of 4,392 over a year, plus 531 Suzuki Cara, compared to 28,010 Cappuccinos and 33,600 Beats (both with production reaching into the latter half of the 1990s).

==Alternative versions==
In a bid to shift unsold stock, Mazda made an effort to produce special versions. First to come was the &quot;Type L&quot; option, featuring an enhanced audio system including a sub-woofer in the boot. There were no exterior changes made to the car.

===Mazdaspeed===

Mazda also introduced the Mazdaspeed version to showcase the parts that were available for the car, the &quot;A-spec&quot;, the body kit features an enhanced hood, front spoiler and rear wing. Unlike the production version, the car came in an all-red or blue body color. It also came with a host of options including shock absorbers with sports spring sets, strut bars for the front and rear, mechanical LSD, enhanced air filter and a stainless steel and ceramic muffler. It also came with its own brand of alloy wheels as opposed to the production&#x27;s steel wheels.

===M2 1015===
For 1994, There was also the &quot;M2 1015&quot; by M2 Incorporated. The most distinguishing part of the car is the front fog lights incorporated into the bonnet, and the all-new front bumper and rear spoiler. The car came in three different colours: white, black and silver. Like the Mazdaspeed version, the car was painted entirely in a single color.

Originally, only fifty units were to be produced by M2, then sold through Autozam dealers. They were so popular, production continued and estimates of between 300-350 were ultimately sold. A genuine &quot;M2 1015&quot; can be identified by the rear emblem stating the version name. More details can be found in “M2 Voice” (linked below)

===Suzuki Cara===
:&quot;See Suzuki Cara in Japanese Wikipedia&quot;
&lt;br&gt;The AZ-1 was also sold by Suzuki as the &quot;Cara&quot;, with only minor detail changes including the addition of fog lamps.

<doc id="1050393" wikidata="Q1079513" url="?curid=1050393" title="Autozam Clef">
<text>The Autozam Clef is a mid-size sedan that was built Mazda for their Autozam sales channel from May 1992 until December 1994.

==Description==
It shared Mazda&#x27;s GE platform with cars like the ɛ̃fini MS-6 and Mazda MX-6 coupé. The word &quot;clef&quot; is a musical notation, and Mazda chose it to signify that the Clef was meant to serve as a reference point by which other Autozam products would become to be known or regarded as. The Clef was mechanically related to the Mazda Cronos (626 in global markets), but featured different bodywork, and rear side window designs. The front end in particular was designed to have the Autozam corporate &quot;face&quot;, reminiscent of the Carol and Revue.
The Clef had the same width dimensions as the Mazda Cronos which shared the engine lineup. Engine size and exterior dimensions have particular significance in Japan, due to dimension regulations, where Japanese consumers pay an additional annual tax for larger vehicles as well as higher road tax obligations. The Clef was Autozam&#x27;s first car to exceed the compact car dimensions. The front-wheel drive Clef was only offered with a four-speed automatic transmission; the base 2.0 was also available with four-wheel drive.

==In the market==
As the Clef was the top level sedan at Autozam, which was introduced as a retailer of entry level products to Japanese consumers, the width dimension presented an issue in that buyers in Japan were liable for yearly taxes, and because the Clef was largely identical to other Mazda GE platform cars, Japanese buyers who were willing to pay extra taxes for a wide car from Mazda had many choices and the Clef wasn&#x27;t usually the first choice. Additionally, Autozam mostly targeted young, female customers, who were unlikely to trade up from the subcompact Revue and Carol to the expensive Clef. The car&#x27;s grilleless fascia was more cute than prestigious or sporty, further harming sales. Late in the production run, a version with a redesigned front bumper incorporating a grille was introduced. Called the Clef Limited-X, it was only offered for a short while and was built in very small numbers.

Of all Autozam products sold at the time, only the Clef exceeded the width dimension stipulation; other Autozam products were either kei class vehicles or supermini products.

<text>The .357 Maximum, formally known as the .357 Remington Maximum or the .357 Max, is a super magnum handgun cartridge originally developed by Elgin Gates as the wildcat .357 SuperMag. The .357 Maximum was introduced into commercial production as a joint-venture by Remington Arms Company and Ruger in 1983 as a new chambering for the Ruger Blackhawk. Shortly thereafter, Dan Wesson Firearms and Thompson/Center Arms introduced firearms in this cartridge. United Sporting Arms chambered it in their Silhouette series single-action revolvers. It is a .357 Magnum case lengthened . Based on the .357 Magnum cartridge, a revolver or single-shot pistol designed for the .357 Remington Maximum will chamber and fire the .360 Dan Wesson, .357 Magnum, .38 Special, .38 Long Colt, and .38 Short Colt cartridges. Intended primarily as a silhouette cartridge, such high velocity and energy levels have hunting applications. SAAMI pressure level for this cartridge is set at .

Despite the cartridge&#x27;s good performance, the higher pressure and velocity caused flame cutting to the top strap and erosion of the forcing cone, due to the use of light bullets, therefore it has since been dropped by all manufacturers who chambered revolvers in this cartridge. Single shot pistols and rifles (i.e. Thompson/Center Contender) are still available in this caliber, and remain popular among handloaders. Unprimed brass is still produced every few years by Remington, and is also a stock item from Starline.

==Performance==

==Legacy==
Guns designed for the .357 Maximum were built on a larger frame than their predecessors. Although Ruger only made about 7,700 Blackhawks chambered in .357 Maximum, the frame size has been used as a base gun to build bigger revolvers in .375 SuperMag, .414 SuperMag, .445 SuperMag, .475 Linebaugh Long/Maximum, and .500 Linebaugh Long/Maximum.

In the movie, &quot;Flypaper (2011)&quot;, Wyatt &quot;Jelly&quot; Jenkins (Pruitt Taylor Vince) uses a Dan Wesson Model 40 VH which is chambered in .357 Remington Maximum as his main sidearm, for the majority of the film.

<text>The 9×23mm Largo (9mm Largo, 9mm Bergmann–Bayard, 9mm Bayard Long) centerfire pistol cartridge was developed in 1903 for the Bergmann–Bayard pistol. It was adopted by the Spanish and Danish militaries, with the former using it until the 1980s, when it was replaced by the 9×19mm Parabellum.

== Description and history ==

The 9mm Largo was developed by Theodor Bergmann and Hugo Schmeisser for the Bergmann–Bayard 1903 pistol. According to &quot;Janes&quot;, the Spanish military loads had a muzzle velocity of and a muzzle energy of 656 J. While it&#x27;s a powerful round, it was used in unlocked breech weapons such as the Astra pistol.

This pistol was adopted by the Spanish army in 1905 as the &quot;Pistola Bergmann de 9 mm. modelo 1905&quot;. Unable to find a German manufacturer to complete the Spanish order for 3,000 pistols, Bergmann turned to a Belgian manufacturer, Anciens Etablissements Pieper (who used the trademark &quot;Bayard&quot;), to complete the order. The final pistol, modified by AEP, was known as the &quot;Bergmann Bayard 1908&quot;, or in Spain as the &quot;Pistola Bergmann de 9 mm. modelo 1908&quot;. Although adopted in 1908, first deliveries did not take place until the next year. Meanwhile, other manufacturers such as Campo-Giro had adopted the 9mm Bergmann–Bayard round and, due to its long history of use in Spanish submachine guns, carbines and pistols, today it is most commonly known as the &quot;9mm Largo&quot;.

In 1910, the Bergmann–Bayard model 1910 semi-automatic pistol was adopted by the Danish military. By 1918, the Bergmann-Bayard was considered obsolete and production was discontinued, though about 1,000 pistols were assembled circa 1918−1920. The Spanish continued using the 9mm Largo in military and police weapons until the 1980s, when it was finally replaced by the 9×19mm Parabellum.

The cartridge headspaces on the mouth of the case. It has a rimless straight-tapered brass, Berdan-primed case. The bullet is round nosed, lead-cored with a gilded steel jacket. The cartridge have a total weight of . The 9mm Largo and the 9×23mm Steyr have almost identical dimensions, but they can be distinguished by the gilded jacketed bullet on the former, and the Austrian headstamp on the latter.

While external dimensions are almost identical, the 9×23mm Largo is a very different cartridge from the modern, high-performance 9×23mm Winchester. Firing the thicker-walled 9×23mm Winchester round in a 9×23mm Largo pistol is dangerous, as old 9mm Largo pistols cannot handle the pressure generated by the 9×23mm Winchester.

<text>The .38 S&amp;W, also commonly known as .38 S&amp;W Short (referred to as such to differentiate it from .38 Long Colt and .38 Special), 9×20mmR, .38 Colt NP (New Police), or .38/200, is a revolver cartridge developed by Smith &amp; Wesson in 1877. Versions of the cartridge were the standard revolver cartridges of the British military from 1922 to 1963, in Webley, Enfield, and Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers. Though similar in name, it is not interchangeable with the later .38 Special due to a different case shape and slightly larger bullet diameter.

==History==

The round was first introduced in 1877 for use in the S&amp;W .38 Single Action. As standard for the era, it featured heeled bullet with the same diameter of bullet and case neck equal to .38 inch; later versions discarded the feature and downsized the bullet, but the designation did not change.

After World War I, the British military sought to replace pre-war revolvers with easier-to-handle weapons. Webley demonstrated a lighter version of their Mk III revolver with modified .38 S&amp;W ammunition, firing a heavy bullet. It received favorable reports, and the revolver was accepted in principle. 

As Webley had used the .38 S&amp;W cartridge dimensions for their revolver, and the cartridge length was fixed by the size of the cylinder of the revolver (the same as for the wider .455), Kynoch produced a cartridge with the same dimensions as the .38 S&amp;W but with 2.8 grains (0.18 g) of &quot;Neonite&quot; nitrocellulose powder and a 200 grain (13.0 g) bullet. In tests performed on cadavers and live animals, it was found that the lead bullet, being overly long and heavy for its calibre, become unstable after penetrating the target, somewhat increasing target effect. The relatively low velocity allowed all of the energy of the cartridge to be spent inside the human target, rather than the bullet passing through. This was deemed satisfactory and the design for the cartridge was accepted as the &quot;.38/200 Cartridge, Revolver Mk I&quot;.

After a period of service, it was realized that the soft lead bullet could arguably contravene the Hague Conventions, which outlawed the use of bullets designed so as to &quot;expand or flatten easily in the human body&quot;. A new cartridge was therefore adopted as &quot;Cartridge, Pistol, .380 Mk II&quot; or &quot;.380 Mk IIz&quot;, firing a 180 gr (11.7 g) full metal jacket bullet. The .38/200 Mk I loading was retained in service for marksmanship and training purposes. However, after the outbreak of war, supply exigencies and the need to order readily available and compatible ammunition, such as the .38 S&amp;W Super Police, from U.S. sources forced British authorities to issue both the .38/200 Mk I and MkII/IIz cartridges interchangeably to forces deploying for combat.

The Cartridge S.A. Ball Revolver .380 inch Mark II and Cartridge S.A. Ball Revolver .380 inch Mark IIz cartridge were theoretically phased out of British service in 1963, when the 9×19mm semi-automatic Browning Hi-Power pistol was finally issued to most British and Commonwealth forces.

==Variants==
The &quot;.38 Colt New Police&quot; was Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company&#x27;s proprietary name for what was essentially the .38 S&amp;W with a flat-nosed bullet.

The U.S. &quot;.38 S&amp;W Super Police&quot; cartridge was nearly identical to the British .38/200 Mk I, using a lead alloy bullet with a muzzle velocity of and a muzzle energy of , and was supplied by several U.S. manufacturers to the British government as equivalent to the Mk I loading.

MKE &quot;9.65 mm Normal&quot; (9.2×23mmR (.38 Smith &amp; Wesson)) cartridge has a lead-antimony alloy bullet with a gilding-metal full metal jacket and a Boxer-primed brass case. The &quot;normal&quot; designation differentiates it from their 9.65mm Special (9.1×29mmR (.38 Special)) round. It uses the 9.65mm (.38-caliber) nominal bore rather than its 9.2mm (.361-caliber) actual bore. It has a muzzle velocity of .

==Current status==
The .380 Mk IIz is still produced by the Ordnance Factory Board in India, for use in revolvers. Commercially, only Ruger makes limited runs of revolvers (e.g., Service Six) in this caliber for overseas sales, and only a few companies still manufacture ammunition. Most of those that do so offer it in only a lead round-nose bullet, though Fiocchi still markets full metal jacket bullet rounds. Some companies, such as Buffalo Bore, manufacture several different types of ammunition for self-defense and/or hunting.

<doc id="1050414" wikidata="Q7011971" url="?curid=1050414" title="New Street, Birmingham">
<text>New Street is a street in central Birmingham, England. It is one of the city&#x27;s principal thoroughfares and shopping streets linking Victoria Square to the Bullring Shopping Centre. It gives its name to New Street railway station, although the station has never had direct access to New Street except via Stephenson Place and latterly Grand Central shopping centre.

==History==
New Street is first mentioned as &quot;novus vicus&quot; in the surviving borough rental records of 1296, at which point it was partly built upon with burgage plots, but was also the site of most of the few open fields remaining within the borough, including &quot;Barlycroft&quot;, &quot;Stoctonesfeld&quot; and &quot;Wodegrene&quot;. It is mentioned again, this time as &quot;le Newestret&quot; in the rentals of 1344–45. The street may have been created at the time of the establishment of Birmingham&#x27;s market in 1166, as a more direct route from the centre of the new town at the Bull Ring to the home of the de Birmingham family&#x27;s feudal overlords at Dudley Castle.

The street underwent large development during the 18th and 19th century and in an 1840s guide, shortly after the building of the Town Hall it is described as &quot;the Bond Street of Birmingham; what with its glittering array of shops, its inns; its fine Elizabethan School, its School of Arts, its Theatre, its Post-office, it gives the tone to that part of the town.&quot;

In 1974, the Birmingham pub bombings took place in two pubs on New Street; one inside King Edward House, the other under the Rotunda. A total of 21 people died as a result of their injuries in these blasts.

===Lost buildings===


*Free Grammar School, originally the Guild of the Holy Cross. Rebuilt twice on this site and then moved to Edgbaston in 1939 resulting in the demolition of the Charles Barry building.
*The Hen and Chickens Inn (1798, James Wyatt), which was replaced by King Edward VI High School for Girls (1896, J. A. Chatwin), also demolished and moved to Edgbaston.
*The Theatre Royal (1774–1956), which had been rebuilt twice following fires. A portico, designed by Samuel Wyatt following a recommendation by Matthew Boulton, was added in 1780.
*The Birmingham Society of Artists, which had a prominent Greek Doric portico jutting into the street (1829, Thomas Rickman) (Demolished, rebuilt in a more conventional style, 1822. Royal Birmingham Society of Artists subsequently moved to near St Paul&#x27;s Square)
*Christ Church, 1805–1899, a church located in what is now Victoria Square.
*Colonnade Hotel, a conglomerate of buildings some of which remain. Many have been demolished.
*Museum or Bazaar, a building containing art and curiosities owned by James Bisset and visited by Horatio Nelson in 1802.
* Warwick House, Birmingham&#x27;s first department store.
* The Exchange - prominent commercial building which faced onto both New Street and Stephenson Place. It was opened in 1865, and demolished exactly a century later in 1965.

==Today==

Victoria Square, containing Birmingham Town Hall, the old Post Office building, and Antony Gormley&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, is at the western end. The Bull Ring and High Street shopping areas and the Rotunda are at the eastern end.

New Street today is mostly pedestrianised, although commercial vehicles are still permitted to enter. It is a popular shopping area which provides a busy link from Corporation Street to the Bullring Shopping Centre and the High Street. It has many well known retailers including; JD Sports, Adidas, Jack Wills, Tesco Metro, Boots and various other stores. Restaurants include Bella Italia, Café Rouge, Pizza Hut, Pret a Manger, Eat and Starbucks.

Many of the city&#x27;s Banks are located up New Street including; Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Bank, NatWest, HSBC and Santander.

A farmers&#x27; market occurs on the first and third Wednesday of each month. Every Christmas a Frankfurt market is held on the street and in Victoria Square, its wooden huts selling items such as jewellery, ornaments, clothing and German food.

Bennetts Hill, notable as the birthplace of the artist, Edward Burne-Jones, runs off New Street roughly in the direction of St Philip&#x27;s Cathedral. 

The Burlington Hotel, formerly known as the Midland Hotel, is located next to an Apple Store, which occupies the former grade II listed Midland Bank building, designed by Edward Holmes and built between 1867 and 1869. In 1875, a five-storey extension of offices was added to the building. The Burlington Arcade, the front area to the Burlington Hotel, underwent a renovation under the design of Malcolm Payne architects who designed a glass roof to cover the area which was once known as Burlington Passage. The lettering of the Midland Hotel is still visible however on the rear of the building fronting Stephenson Street. This was the building where Enoch Powell delivered his controversial 1968 Rivers of Blood speech regarding Commonwealth immigrants.

<doc id="1050419" wikidata="Q126877547" url="?curid=1050419" title="Bridgwater (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Bridgwater is a parliamentary constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom since 2024 by Ashley Fox of the Conservative Party. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

From 2010 to 2024 it was replaced by the Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency. Further to the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat has been re-established for the 2024 general election, primarily formed from the now abolished of Bridgwater and West Somerset seat but excluding the area comprising the former District of West Somerset.

== History ==
Bridgwater was one of the original Parliamentary Constituencies in the House of Commons, having elected Members of Parliament since 1295, the Model Parliament.

The original borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption in 1870. From 4 July 1870 the town was incorporated within the county constituency of West Somerset.

From Parliament&#x27;s enactment of the major Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 which took effect at the 1885 general election, a new county division of Bridgwater was created, which lasted with modifications until 2010. The constituency expanded considerably beyond Bridgwater town itself from 1885.

Bridgwater frequently compared to other seats had a radical or game-changing representative, though since 1950 this became less noticeable in its candidates elected.

The seat received particular fame in late 1938 when a by-election took place in the aftermath of the signing of the Munich Agreement. Opponents of the agreement persuaded the local Labour and Liberal parties to not field candidates of their own against the Conservative candidate, but to instead jointly back an independent standing on a platform of opposition to the Government&#x27;s foreign policy, in the hope that this would be the precursor to the formation of a more general Popular Front of opposition to the government of Neville Chamberlain in anticipation of the General Election due in either 1939 or 1940. The noted journalist Vernon Bartlett stood as the independent Popular Front candidate and achieved a sensational victory in what was hitherto a Conservative seat. He represented the constituency for the next twelve years.

In 1970 another by-election in the constituency achieved fame as it was the first occasion when 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds were able to vote in a UK Parliamentary election. The first teenager to cast a vote was Trudy Sellick, 18 on the day of the poll. The by-election was won by the future Conservative Cabinet Minister Tom King who held the seat for the next thirty-one years, followed by another Conservative, Ian Liddell-Grainger, until its abolition in 2010. 

Liddell-Grainger served as the MP for Bridgwater and West Somerset from 2010 to 2024, but opted to stand at the 2024 general election for the new seat of Tiverton and Minehead, which he failed to win. Ashley Fox was selected as the Conservative candidate for the re-established constituency, which he narrowly won.

== Boundaries ==

=== Historic ===

1885–1918: The Municipal Borough of Bridgwater, the Sessional Division of Bridgwater, and parts of the Sessional Divisions of Taunton and Ilminster.

1918–1950: The Municipal Borough of Bridgwater, the Urban Districts of Burnham-on-Sea, Highbridge, Minehead, and Watchet, and the Rural Districts of Bridgwater and Williton.

1950–1983: The Municipal Borough of Bridgwater, the Urban Districts of Burnham-on-Sea, Minehead, and Watchet, and the Rural Districts of Bridgwater and Williton. &quot;Highbridge Urban District had been absorbed by Burnham-on-Sea UD in 1933, but the constituency boundaries remained unchanged.&quot;

1983–2010: The District of Sedgemoor wards of Cannington and Combwich, Central, Dowsborough, Eastern Quantocks, Eastover, East Poldens, Hamp, Huntspill, Newton Green, North Petherton, Parchey, Pawlett and Puriton, Quantock, Sandford, Sowey, Sydenham, Victoria, Westonzoyland, West Poldens, and Woolavington, and the District of West Somerset wards of Alcombe, Aville Vale, Carhampton and Withycombe, Crowcombe and Stogumber, Dunster, East Brendon, Holnicote, Minehead North, Minehead South, Old Cleeve, Porlock and Oare, Quantock Vale, Watchet, West Quantock, and Williton.

=== Current ===

Under the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the re-established constituency was defined as being composed of the following as they existed on 1 December 2020:
* The District of Sedgemoor wards of: Berrow; Bridgwater Dunwear; Bridgwater Eastover; Bridgwater Fairfax; Bridgwater Hamp; Bridgwater Victoria; Bridgwater Westover; Bridgwater Wyndham; Burnham Central; Burnham North; Cannington and Wembdon; Highbridge and Burnham Marine; Huntspill and Pawlett; King&#x27;s Isle; North Petherton; Puriton and Woolavington; Quantocks.
With effect from 1 April 2023, the District of Sedgemoor was abolished and absorbed into the new unitary authority of Somerset. Consequently, the constituency now comprises the following electoral divisions of Somerset from the 2024 general election:

* Brent (part); Bridgwater East and Bawdrip; Bridgwater North and Central; Bridgwater South; Bridgwater West; Burnham on Sea North; Cannington; Highbridge and Burnham South; Huntspill (majority); King Alfred (small part); North Petherton.

It comprises: 

* The bulk of the parts of the former District of Sedgemoor in the abolished Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency (74% of the electorate), mainly consisting of the town of Bridgwater itself.
* Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge, previously in the now abolished constituency of Wells.

<text>Telstar Records was a British record label that operated from 1982 to 2004.

==Background==

Telstar Records was founded in 1982 by Sean O&#x27;Brien and Neil Palmer with a government loan of £120,000. It was launched as a specialist compilation marketing label and had hits with a range of compilation franchises such as the Deep Heat, Kaos Theory and 100% ranges. As well as these brands, the company licensed a number of major artist recordings (for example ABBA and the Four Tops) to release telemarketed compilations.

In the mid-1990s, it diversified its output into the singles market and long-term artist development. Until then, Telstar normally only released singles that were telemarketed or associated with acts like The Chippendales or Byker Grove&#x27;s PJ &amp; Duncan. Many of PJ &amp; Duncan/Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s early records came out XSRhythm, Telstar&#x27;s dance music label, though by the mid-1990s this had been superseded by Multiply Records. This dance label was run by Mike Hall and originally featuring a large amount of acts licensed on a track-by-track basis from overseas companies, before becoming home to acts such as The Cheeky Girls.

Acts signed in the late 1990s period included Conner Reeves, Phats &amp; Small and a Tony Mortimer-free version of East 17, while Craig David had two UK number one singles on the Wildstar label, a joint-venture between Telstar and the Capital Radio Group (now known as media company Global), which was run by music managers Ian McAndrew and Colin Lester.

Other artists included Victoria Beckham (in a £1.5 million deal arranged with Simon Fuller&#x27;s 19 Recordings), Rosie Ribbons, Skream!, Danny Erskine and Mis-Teeq. In the late 1990s, Telstar became closely associated with BMG Records, especially with the Telstar TV compilation label.

Telstar Records went bankrupt in 2004, largely due to the company&#x27;s habit of giving large advances to artists such as Claire Sweeney and Victoria Beckham who failed to make them any money. In the media much of the blame for the label&#x27;s failure was placed on their most high-profile signing, Victoria Beckham. However, as most of Telstar&#x27;s artists were not directly signed to the label, instead being either sub-licensed or part of a number of joint ventures, BMG (soon to be merged with Sony) declined to buy the label&#x27;s assets outright.

The majority of Telstar&#x27;s back catalogue (the artists signed directly to the label not sub-licensed) ended up with Phoenix Music International alongside the rights to songs from Gut Records, Jet Star and Azuli, whilst Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s hits ended up being sub-licensed to BBC Studios&#x27; Crimson Productions/DMG TV in the early 2010s (which resulted in a number one hit for DMG TV&#x27;s Edsel label in 2013 when &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready to Rhumble&quot; charted again). In February 2017, the remains of Wildstar was bought by Sony Music Entertainment UK, a company who signed Craig David in 2016 (in a deal which was part of another joint venture called Insanity Records), whilst Ian McAndrew runs management company Wildlife, home to Miles Kane, Psychedelic Porn Crumpets and Royal Blood.

<doc id="1050430" wikidata="Q658310" url="?curid=1050430" title="Frock">
<text>Frock has been used since Middle English as the name for an article of clothing, typically coat-like, for men and women.

==Terminology==
In British English and in Commonwealth countries the word may be used as an alternative term for a girl&#x27;s or woman&#x27;s dress, in particular for a dress suitable for a smart occasion but (in UK English usage) with a hemline higher than a full-length ballgown. In Australia it is frequently used this way, with the phrase &quot;to frock up&quot; meaning to wear a formal dress or gown for a special occasion.

Relatedly, a frock coat is a men&#x27;s coat style of the 19th century, characterized by full skirts reaching to the lower thigh or knee. Despite the similarity in the name, the frock coat should be regarded as being a distinct garment quite separate from the frock. In the French language the frock coat is called &#x27;une redingote&#x27; (from English &quot;riding coat&quot;), and so unlike the English language implies no immediate relationship to the frock which is called &#x27;une fraque&#x27;. Indeed, the modern French word for a tail coat is &quot;un frac&quot; which better betrays the historical relationship between the tail coat and the frock. In construction the frock coat could scarcely be more different from the frock for unlike the latter it is usually double breasted, lacks any pockets, lacks a high collar, has V-shaped lapels, is closely fitted and is constructed with a waist seam.

== History ==

Originally, a &quot;frock&quot; was a loose, long garment with wide, full sleeves, such as the habit of a monk or priest, commonly belted. (This is the origin of the modern term defrock or unfrock, meaning &quot;to eject from the priesthood&quot;.)

Throughout the early modern period, &quot;frock&quot; continually applied to various types of clothing, but generally denoting a loosely fitted garment in practice seemingly ranging in styles from resembling a banyan to a tunic.

From the 16th century to the early 20th century, &quot;frock&quot; was applied to a woman&#x27;s dress or gown, in the fashion of the day, often indicating an unfitted, comfortable garment for wear in the house, or (later) a light overdress worn with a slip or underdress.

From the 17th century on, a &quot;frock&quot; was a thigh- or full-length loose outer garment worn by shepherds, workmen, and farm workers in Great Britain, generally of heavy linen with a broad flat collar, now usually called a smock-frock. In some areas, this traditional frock buttons up the front in the manner of a coat, while in others it is a pullover style.

As such, a &quot;frock&quot; remains a dense knitted overgarment worn by sailors and fishermen, as &quot;guernsey frock&quot;, &quot;jersey frock&quot; (now usually simply guernsey and jersey).

===18th century===
In 18th century Britain and the United States, a &quot;frock&quot; was an unfitted men&#x27;s coat for hunting or other country pursuits, with a broad, flat collar, derived from the traditional working-class frock.

The precise historical evolution of the frock after the second half of the 18th century is obscure, as is its contrasting features to the justaucorps, the evening wear dress coat, and the supplanting 19th century frock coat.

===19th century===

Some late in the 18th century versions had it made with a cutaway front without a waist seam. This may have been one of the predecessors of the frock coat or at least the dress coat with horizontally cutaway fronts worn for daytime wear by the early 19th century and from which the modern-day evening wear tail dress coat for white tie is derived. The frock coat in turn became cut away into the modern morning coat, giving us the two modern version of tail coats, but the evolution is blurry. Notwithstanding, it seems as if the frock was gradually supplanted by the frock coat in the early 19th century, whereas the former frock style was relegated to evening wear.

Shapewise, also the great coat may similarly be historically derived from the frock as it similarly is single breasted, with a high and broad collar, waist pockets, and also lacked a waist seam early in its history as can be seen in an example in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

==Contemporary feminine connotations==

In contemporary times, a &quot;frock&quot; may still designate a woman&#x27;s or girl&#x27;s, or child&#x27;s dress or light overdress.

<doc id="1050479" wikidata="Q861203" url="?curid=1050479" title="BloodRayne 2">
<text>BloodRayne 2 is an action hack and slash video game developed by Terminal Reality for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows. It does not follow on directly from where &quot;BloodRayne&quot; finished; instead, it takes place 60 and 70 years later in a contemporary 2000s setting.

A remastered version titled BloodRayne 2: Terminal Cut was released on November 20, 2020, and later on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch as BloodRayne 2: ReVamped on November 18, 2021.

==Plot==
The FMV opens with a flashback set shortly after the first game. Rayne is seen entering a library (called Blood Library), with a few Nazis inside. She finds that Brimstone members have been slaughtered and realizes her vampiric father Kagan is here, acting as an influential Nazi. Rayne rushes to confront him for revenge for her mother&#x27;s rape and the murder of her family, and Kagan mocks Rayne by saying he does not recognize her, as he sired numerous offspring that way. He finds what he was looking for, called the Vesper Shard. Knowing Rayne still wants to kill him, he then brings Professor Trumain up from the floor, strangled by his own small intestine, but barely alive. Kagan knows that they know each other, and that Trumain &quot;stole&quot; yet another offspring from him. While Kagan mocks Rayne, Truman pulls out a detonator, first giving time for Rayne to run, then detonating the grenade, killing himself and seemingly taking Kagan with him.

Denied the pleasure of killing him herself, Rayne spends the 60 years after the war seeking out and destroying Kagan&#x27;s offspring. These offspring, Rayne&#x27;s half-siblings, have banded together to form a group called the Cult of Kagan. The Cult has created the Shroud, a substance that can render sun rays harmless to vampires, allowing them to surface at all times of the day, and which twists nature into a nightmarish perversion (trees dying almost instantly, grass catching on fire, corpses twitching). Using the Shroud, the Cult has pledged to create a new era of vampiric supremacy, continuing Kagan&#x27;s legacy.

Rayne and her ally Severin find high ranking members of the Cult, who are responsible for hundreds of disappearances in a city. Rayne learns of their plot and defeats her ambitious half-sister Ferrill, the apparent leader of the cult. It is soon revealed that Kagan himself has long survived over the years and has come out of hiding. After Kagan has Ferrill dispatched, he sets about the plot to activate the Shroud, blocking out the sun and setting loose an army of vampires and demonic entities to destroy the city, making it his kingdom. Rayne again sets her sights on killing Kagan.

With Kagan&#x27;s army having taken over the city, Rayne seeks out his tower to face him once and for all, fighting his army to get to him. A vengeful Ferrill makes an army of her own to usurp Kagan. After Rayne dispatches the last of her half-siblings, she confronts Kagan in his throne room, with Kagan mocking her one last time about the effort he took to create her. A fight ensues and Rayne kills her father, avenging her family.

Despite Kagan&#x27;s death, the vampires still plague the city, and Severin suggests that Rayne should run it now. Brimestone declares martial law to rescue the surviving humans, cracking down hard on all vampires and more vampire overlords setting their sights on the city.

==Development==
The game was developed by a team of around 20 people.

==Reception==
&quot;BloodRayne 2&quot; received &quot;average&quot; reviews on all platforms, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

<doc id="1050502" wikidata="Q17078706" url="?curid=1050502" title="Holing cane">
<text>Holing cane was a process by which slave labor gangs planted sugar cane on plantations.

Field slaves were generally divided into three gangs based on their ability to work. The lead gang was responsible for digging cane holes; the second gang would plant the cane cuttings, and the third gang—typically composed of the least able-bodied workers and the very young—would be required to weed the fields, catch rats, and serve as gofers.

The process began with white field supervisors marking off the cane field in a checkerboard of squares. Within each square the lead gang would dig a hole approximately deep and long. This back-breaking labor was often complicated by wet weather or parched soil, and a network of cut canes and roots from the previous year&#x27;s planting.

The secondary gang would set cuttings of the previous year&#x27;s cane in the holes and cover them with a mixture of manure and soil. The manure mixture was carried by hand in baskets to avoid damage to the plantings. The cuttings would be arranged in rows to allow the prevailing winds to disperse moisture in and around the cane, reducing the chances of fungal diseases, which ruined many crops each year (see List of sugarcane diseases).

Cane holing was such brutal work that many plantation owners contracted with jobbing gangs to plant the crop in order to protect their capital investment in their own enslaved workforce.

<doc id="1050503" wikidata="Q16158024" url="?curid=1050503" title="Act of Proscription 1746">
<text>The Act of Proscription (19 Geo. 2. c. 39), also called the Act of Proscription 1746 or the Disarming the Highlands, etc. Act 1745, was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain, which came into effect in Scotland on 1 August 1746. It was part of a series of efforts to assimilate the Scottish Highlands, ending their ability to revolt, and the first of the &quot;King&#x27;s laws&quot; that sought to crush the clan system in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745. These laws were finally repealed on 1 July 1782.

==Background==

From 1745 to 1746, government forces led by the Duke of Cumberland gradually suppressed the Jacobite rising of 1745. As the majority of the Jacobite Army consisted of men from the Scottish Highlanders, the Hanoverian regime made plans to suppress the Highland clan system to prevent future rebellions.

==Penalties==
It was mainly a restatement of the earlier Disarming Act, but with more severe punishments which this time were rigorously enforced. Punishments started with fines, with jail until payment and possible forced conscription for late payment. Repeat offenders were &quot;liable to be transported to any of his Majesty&#x27;s plantations beyond the seas, there to remain for the space of seven years&quot;, effectively indentured servitude.

The penalties for wearing &quot;highland clothing&quot; as stated in the Dress Act 1746 were &quot;imprisonment, without bail, during the space of six months, and no longer; and being convicted for a second offence before a court of justiciary or at the circuits, shall be liable to be transported ...&quot; No lesser penalties were allowed for.

==Geographical coverage==
The elements of the act relating to the proscription of arms applied to the Highlands of Scotland, i.e. the counties of Dunbarton, on the north side of the water of Leven, Stirling on the north side of the river of Forth, Perth, Kincardine, Aberdeen, Inverness, Nairn, Cromarty, Argyll, Forfar, Banff, Sutherland, Caithness, Elgin and Ross.

The Dress Act applied to the whole of Scotland.

==Comment==
Samuel Johnson commented that &quot;the last law by which the Highlanders are deprived of their arms, has operated with efficacy beyond expectations ... the arms were collected with such rigour, that every house was despoiled of its defence&quot;.

==Sections of the act==
A new section, which became known as the Dress Act, banned wearing of &quot;the Highland Dress&quot;. Provision was also included to protect those involved in putting down the rebellion from lawsuits. Measures to prevent children from being &quot;educated in disaffected or rebellious principles&quot; included a requirement for school prayers for the King and royal family.

The most severe penalties, at a minimum six months&#x27; incarceration and transportation to a penal colony for a second offence, made these the most severe portion of this act.

==Following act==
The Act of Proscription was followed by the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746 which removed the authority the clan chieftains had enjoyed. Scottish heritable sheriffdoms reverted to the Crown, and other heritable jurisdictions, including regalities, came under the power of the courts.

<text>In organic chemistry, a glycosyl group is a univalent free radical or substituent structure obtained by removing the hydroxyl () group from the hemiacetal () group found in the cyclic form of a monosaccharide and, by extension, of a lower oligosaccharide. Glycosyl groups are exchanged during glycosylation from the glycosyl donor, the electrophile, to the glycosyl acceptor, the nucleophile. The outcome of the glycosylation reaction is largely dependent on the reactivity of each partner. Glycosyl also reacts with inorganic acids, such as phosphoric acid, forming an ester such as glucose 1-phosphate.

== Examples ==
In cellulose, glycosyl groups link together 1,4-β--glucosyl units to form chains of (1,4-β--glucosyl)n.
Other examples include ribityl in 6,7-Dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, and glycosylamines.

== Alternative substituent groups==

Instead of the hemiacetal hydroxyl group, a &quot;hydrogen&quot; atom can be removed to form a substituent, for example the hydrogen from the C3 hydroxyl of a glucose molecule. Then the substituent is called -glucopyranos-3-&quot;O&quot;-yl as it appears in the name of the drug Mifamurtide.

Recent detection of Au3+ in vivo used &quot;C&quot;-glycosyl pyrene. Its fluorescence and permeability through cell membranes helped detect Au3+.

<text>A fluffer is a person employed to keep a porn performer&#x27;s penis erect on the set. After setting up the desired angle, the director asks the actors to hold position and calls for the fluffer to &quot;fluff&quot; the actors for the shot. These duties are considered part of the makeup department. While fluffing does not necessarily involve touching the actors, it could entail sexual acts such as fellatio or non-penetrative sex.

According to some pornographic actors, including Aurora Snow, James Deen and Keiran Lee, fluffers are no longer needed, saying that the role might have existed in the past, but disappeared due to medical advancements, such as Viagra and implants, and with advancements in prosthetics. Hunter Skott, who has worked as a fluffer, contended in an interview that they &quot;are only used for a gangbang or bukkake, not for regular [porn] movies&quot;. 

Predating the pornographic usage, which came into use in the 1970s, &quot;fluffer&quot; has been used by the real estate industry to refer to a person that stages homes and as a term for a maid or housekeeper who fluffs pillows, or in general cleans and prepares work equipment.

== In popular culture ==

In the 1998 video game &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, it is possible for the player to become a fluffer for a post-apocalyptic studio engaged in the porn industry.

The 2001 film &quot;The Fluffer&quot; is about a film buff with a crush on a porn star who is straight, for whom he would end up working as a fluffer in gay porn.
In episode 3 of season 2 of &quot;New Girl&quot; entitled &quot;Fluffer&quot;, Nick Miller tells the protagonist Jessica Day that he will not be her &quot;emotional fluffer&quot;, after he realises that he is providing her sentimental stimulation which allows her to maintain a more active sex life with a recurring character named Sam Sweeney.

The oneiric slasher &quot;Knife+Heart&quot; follows a group of &quot;low grade&quot; gay pornographers in 1970s France. The film depicts a character named Mouth of Gold, or Mouth, who is a fluffer. In the film, he is a middle-aged man who works for free as he lives with his mother.

<text>The Otago Daily Times (ODT) is a newspaper published by Allied Press Ltd in Dunedin, New Zealand. The &quot;ODT&quot; is one of the country&#x27;s four main daily newspapers, serving the southern South Island with a circulation of around 26,000 and a combined print and digital annual audience of 304,000. Founded in 1861 it is New Zealand&#x27;s oldest surviving daily newspaper – Christchurch&#x27;s &quot;The Press&quot;, six months older, was a weekly paper until March 1863.

Its motto is &quot;Optima Durant&quot; or &quot;Quality Endures&quot;.

==History==
===Founding===
The &quot;ODT&quot; was founded by William H. Cutten and Julius (later Sir Julius) Vogel during the boom following the discovery of gold at the Tuapeka, the first of the Otago goldrushes. Co-founder Vogel had learnt the newspaper trade while working as a goldfields correspondent, journalist and editor in Victoria prior to immigrating to New Zealand.
Vogel had arrived in Otago in early October 1861 at the age of 26 and soon took up employment at the &quot;Otago Colonist&quot;, which was owned and edited by William Lambert. Within several weeks he left and joined its rival the weekly &quot;Otago Witness&quot; newspaper as editor and also became its co-owner when he purchased a half share in the business from Cutten. The business becoming Cullen and Vogel. Vogel convinced Cutten that due to the explosion due to the gold rush in population (from 12,691 in 1860 to over 29,000 by the end of 1861) now was the time to publish a daily newspaper.

Originally styled &quot;The Otago Daily Times&quot;, the &quot;ODT&quot; was first published on 15 November 1861, making it New Zealand&#x27;s oldest surviving daily newspaper. The first issue which had four pages was sold for threepence and was printed by hand on a cylinder printing machine imported from Melbourne. It soon had a circulation of 2,750 compared with the 250 of the &quot;Otago Witness&quot;. From the start, the &quot;ODT&quot; held a strong position among South Island newspapers. 
Vogel was editor, with the day to day commercial management under the control of Benjamin Farjeon, who had come to Dunedin from Victoria in 1861. Farjeon also acted as sub-editor, contributor and frequently compositor. During Farjeon&#x27;s time at the &quot;ODT&quot; he wrote the novels. &quot;Shadows on the Snow&quot; (1965) and &quot;Grif: a story of colonial life&quot; (1866) and he composed and set them in type in the office of the newspaper. Daniel Campbell, who had been Cutten&#x27;s manager for some years, became manager of the mechanical departments of the business.

The transformation of Dunedin in a short space of time into a large and prosperous town eager for news combined with the literary control of Vogel and management skills of Farjeon lead to the &quot;ODT&quot; rapidly gaining readers and advertisers. Vogel&#x27;s strong political views saw an outlet in the &quot;ODT&quot;&#x27;s pages, notably for advocacy of provincial government. The newspaper&#x27;s original literacy staff consisted of Vogel, chief reporter Edward Thomas Gillon and William Harrison. Another reporter that Vogel later hired, was Ebenezer Fox who went on to have a notable career in politics.

By early March 1862 its number of pages had doubled. Raising demand lead to a steam-powered two-cylinder printing press being imported from the United Kingdom, which was fortunate as it was being used to printed a circulation of 7,000 copies by August 1862. This was despite an increase in the newspapers price to sixpence due to a combination of increasing newsprint and labour costs.

Vogel also acted as editor of the &quot;Otago Witness&quot;, which for a period was practically only a reprint of the &quot;ODT&quot;.

The &quot;ODT&quot; was originally published from premises in Princes Street, but within a fortnight of its first issue a fire on 1 December 1861 swept through the premises. William Lambert the owner of the &quot;Otago Colonist&quot; offered the use of his printing plant, with the condition that as he was deeply religious, they could use it until after midnight on what was to him the sacrosanct Sunday. The &quot;ODT&quot; appeared the next day reduced in size and with no advertisements. Following repairs, the business moved back into the premises and stayed there until they moved to a new building at the corner of Dowling and Burlington Streets at the foot of Bell Hill in 1879. It stayed here until 1928 when it moved into larger premises on the other side of Burlington Street facing Queen&#x27;s Gardens, where they stayed until 1977.

As more and more people were attracted to the goldfields the business had trouble retaining employees, despite paying staff such as compositors double that of those in similar positions in Melbourne. It was soon necessary to offer compositors another 50% increase in an attempt to retain them. As a result, they could earn £12 to 14 a week during the height of the gold rush. Despite this on one occasion all but one compositor had left for the gold fields, which required Farjeon (who had trained as a printer&#x27;s devil and then as a compositor) to step and assist in the publication.

In 1862 the &quot;Evening News&quot; was launched as an afternoon rival and by 1863 had achieved a circulation of 1,000, but it closed the next year. It is not to be confused with the &quot;Evening Star&quot; which launched on 1 May 1863 as a daily afternoon newspaper (selling for a penny) and which was the longest-lived rival to the &quot;ODT&quot;.

===Impact of the telegraph===
Vogel identified that the completion of telegraph lines as the country was opened up gave the daily &quot;ODT&quot; an advantage The completion of a telegraph line from Campbelltown later Bluff) to Dunedin in August 1862 in particular allowed the &quot;ODT&quot; to gain quicker access to international news as Bluff was the first New Zealand port of call for ships carrying English and Australian newspapers before travelling up the coast to Dunedin. Vogel arranged for summaries of the foreign news to be prepared by an employee of the Argus newspaper in Melbourne, put on a mail ship and then dispatched by telegraph to the &quot;ODT&quot; when it arrived in Bluff. When the telegraph line reached Hokitika, he also arranged for international news arriving upon a ship to also be dispatched from there. Originally, he reserved the information of the sole use of the &quot;ODT&quot;. Once a telegraph line was opened across Cook Strait, Vogel made his telegrams available for sale to Wellington and soon after other North Island newspapers. This ability for a daily to more quickly convey the latest news to the public gave the &quot;ODT&quot; an advantage over a weekly newspaper. As a result, Cutten&#x27;s and Vogel&#x27;s own &quot;Otago Witness&quot; declined in importance and slowly became a digest of reprints from its daily sister and original material oriented towards country readers.

The &quot;Otago Colonist&quot; which had previously been a weekly responded by becoming a daily in July 1862. Its owners launched in early January 1863 a new daily newspaper called the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and reverted the &quot;Otago Colonist&quot; to a weekly with a change of name to the &quot;Weekly Colonist&quot;. This made Dunedin the first New Zealand city to have two daily newspapers until both the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Weekly Colonist&quot; closed on 9 April 1864. Twelve weeks later the &quot;Otago Daily Mail&quot; was launched but it was not competitive and had closed by April 1865.

In January 1863 the &quot;ODT&quot; halved its price to threepence (3d).

In 1864 the &quot;ODT&quot; was successfully sued by the New Zealand Banking Corporation for libel after it had claimed that it was not a legally constituted joint stock bank. The bank was awarded £500 in damages which highlighted to Cutten, a man of a contented disposition, that as well as the pressures of producing a daily edition there was also sufficient financial risks. This was enough to induce him to sell his share in the newspaper to Vogel in November 1864. Vogel took on Farjeon as his junior partner in what became J. Vogel &amp; Co.

By early 1865 the business was struggling financially. With Vogel beginning his political career, the partners sold a majority shareholding in the business in March 1865 to a number of prominent Dunedin citizens on the condition that they were kept on as manager and editor respectively. The new owners formed a public company in 1860, the Otago Daily Times and Witness Newspapers Co. Ltd which was funded by issuing £6,000 worth of debentures at 10% offering interest. Vogel, John Bathgate, F.C. Simmons and James Rattray as directors. Farjeon retired as business manager in December 1867, and Campbell was appointed in his place.

===Ousting of Vogel===
The end of the gold rush lead to Dunedin enduring a major economic downturn from 1868 to 1869. As Vogel became more and more involved in the politics. The other more commercially minded directors who were by now Rattray and W.D. Murison with Bathgate now the company secretary, aware of the need for the newspaper to earn sufficient income pay the interest on the debentures came to believe that Vogel&#x27;s use of the newspaper to advocate on behalf of his political beliefs, was impacting on the business. Murison and Bathgate also had political interests which may have entered into the decision to dispense with Vogel&#x27;s services in April 1868. The rest of the entire editorial staff were also soon let go. At an extraordinary general meeting of the company in July of that year Vogel made an unsuccessful attempt at retaining his position by offering to lease the company. His offer was rejected by 96 to nil. Using the offices of the &quot;Evening Star&quot; Vogel in partnership with others launched the &quot;New Zealand Sun&quot; on 16 November 1868 as a morning rival to the &quot;ODT&quot; but it lasted only until 20 March 1869.
Following the departure of Vogel, the newspaper became an opponent of his political policies and thus once he became a member of the government it was anti-government from 1869 to 1876.
One of the people sacked from the &quot;ODT&quot; in the purge of editorial staff in 1868 was George Bell who in January 1869 started the evening daily &quot;Evening Independent&quot;. In June of that same year Bell purchased the &quot;Evening Star&quot; and merged the &quot;Evening Independent&quot; into it.

===Telegram libel case===
Meanwhile, the editorship &quot;ODT&quot; was given to lawyer George Burnett Barton. 
Despite circulation falling from its high of 7,000 copies in 1862 and the departure of Vogel the &quot;ODT&quot; remained the province&#x27;s dominant newspaper through the 1860s. 
Poor economic conditions in the early 1870s made things difficult for the &quot;ODT&quot;. In 1871 it saw off a threat from the short lived daily &quot;The Southern League and Daily Advertiser&quot; which began publication in early July and which despite a name change to &quot;The Daily Advertiser and Southern League&quot; it had closed by 10 November 1871.
Barton was not however a success, as a number of libel actions were taken against the newspaper, most notably a celebrated case which became known as the &quot;Telegram Libel Case&quot;. In October 1870 Barton had published articles in the alleging that the Telegraph Department delayed news telegrams for the &quot;ODT&quot; until summaries had been given to pro-government newspaper in Wellington.
The government took exception to these comments. Vogel was serving in a senior position in the government and there was suspicions that as Vogel&#x27;s departure from the newspaper had been somewhat acrimonious, he still harboured a significant grudge:
The government managed to locate evidence that identified that Barton was author of the articles and prosecuted him for libel. In the process of gathering evidence the government offered Otago Daily Times staff a &#x27;pardon in advance&#x27; so they would not incriminate themselves in giving evidence against Barton. After he was committed for trial in January 1871, the case was dropped. Barton was not inclined to let matters rest and in March 1871, he launched a writ against Charles Lemon the head of the Telegraph Department, accusing him of a breach of the Telegraph Act (1865) over the so-called Stafford Timaru speech affair. In his writ Barton accused him of obtaining a copy of a report that a reporter had sent by telegraph on a speech by William Stafford in April 1870 and allowing it to be used for political purposes. Barton argued that the telegram was effectively the private property of &quot;ODT&quot;, but his claim was rejected by the court. Following the conclusion of the case in 1871 Barton resigned and was succeeded as editor by William Murison. About two years previously J. G. Fraser had been appointed to the position of manager of the company. Murison held the editorship until 1877 when he was succeeded by George M Reed who only in turn held the position until 1878.

===Increasing competition===
George Bell, the owner of the afternoon &quot;Evening Star&quot; made a direct foray into directly completing with the &quot;ODT&quot; by launching the &quot;Morning Star&quot; in December 1872, but while the combined circulation of the two newspapers was over 4,000 this was still less than that of the &quot;ODT&quot;. In 1873 what eventually was to be called the Guardian Printing and Publishing Company was formed to purchase the &quot;Morning Star&quot; which they intended to rename the &quot;Daily News&quot;, but by the time it appeared on 23 July 1873 it was called the &quot;Otago Guardian&quot; a new daily morning rival. It was edited by Robert Creighton, who had formerly been editor of the Auckland&#x27;s &quot;Southern Cross&quot;.
Evening newspapers always had an advantage over the morning &quot;ODT&quot; as they had access to the latest news that had come in over the telegraph during the day. The telegraph office closed at midnight, which with the exception of local news, meant that the morning newspaper could only print the previous days national and international news.

In January 1874 the Guardian Printing and Publishing Company began publishing the weekly &quot;Southern Mercury&quot; which was edited by Vincent Pyke.
By the mid-1870s the &quot;Otago Guardian&quot; was struggling against the &quot;ODT&quot;. Following the resignation of its manager Captain Baldwin in 1875 George Fenwick took up the position. Soon recognizing after several months in the position that it was impossible to make headway against the &quot;ODT&quot; and thus stem the losses that the business was incurring Fenwick recommended to the directors of the company that they sell both the &quot;Otago Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Southern Mercury&quot; if possible, and, if not, to cease the publication. Taking his advice, a new owner was found in April 1876 the form of George McCullagh Reed who had moved to Dunedin earlier in that same year and, possibly with financial assistance from his former partner in the &quot;Auckland Star&quot;, Henry Brett, established in partnership with George Jones a new paper, a third iteration of the &quot;Evening News&quot;, for the purpose of supporting the threatened provincial system.
When deciding to purchase the publications Reed believed that he could redeem the newspaper&#x27;s fortunes by the sheer force and power of bis writing and editing. Against his better judgment, Fenwick was influenced by Reed&#x27;s conviction, and stayed on in his position and also became a partner. Later that year Fenwick also became a partner in the &quot;Evening News&quot; which was later closed in 1878.

===Takeover by Fenwick and Reed===
Despite Reed and Fenwick&#x27;s best efforts the finances of the &quot;Otago Guardian&quot; continued to deteriorate and it took little more than a year&#x27;s experience for Reed by 1877 to come to share Fenwick&#x27;s view that Dunedin was not able to support two daily morning newspapers, theirs and the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;. Fenwick had a brainstorm and staggered Reed when he proposed that they should endeavour to obtain the ownership, via a reverse takeover of the much larger and more prosperous &quot;ODT&quot; and the &quot;Otago Witness&quot;. Thus by amalgamating their publications with their older-established more successful rivals, they could transform the two concerns into a lucrative business. The directors of their rivals were adamantly opposed and it was necessary for Fenwick and Reed by using W. H. Reynolds as secret negotiator and by raising and offer £30,000 before they gained control. As soon as Reed and Fenwick assumed control of the &quot;ODT&quot; and &quot;Otago Witness&quot;, the staff of the rival publications were merged and the &quot;Otago Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Southern Mercury&quot; ceased publication.
Reed took on the editorship of both the &quot;ODT&quot; and &quot;Otago Witness&quot; while Silas Spragg from the &quot;Otago Guardian&quot; became the chief reporter of the &quot;ODT&quot;.

===Staff depart to start a rival newspaper===
The amalgamation of the various newspapers necessarily involved some reduction in the number of the employees, and it was the intention of Reed and Fenwick to endeavour to equalise matters by selecting their permanent employees in fair proportions from the respective staffs of the former rivals. However the former &quot;ODT&quot; employees took up the position that unless they were all retained, they would not accept a job under the new owners. This condition the owners declined to accede to, and the result was that the &quot;&quot;ODT&quot; employees started an opposition paper, the &quot;Morning Herald&quot; which was launched in December 1877 aggressively priced at one penny, as against threepence being charged for the &quot;ODT&quot;.
The men had many sympathisers and the former directors of the Times Company and their friends gave the new venture all the help they possibly could. The rival soon had a circulation of compatible with that of the &quot;ODT&quot;. In 1878 out of a combined population of 32,792 for the city and suburbs the average daily circulation of the &quot;ODT&quot; (which varied between 2,500 and 4,000) was about the same as the 10.7% of the &quot;Daily Morning Herald&quot; (approximately 3,000), well short of the 22.3% of afternoon &quot;Evening Star&quot;, the 17.8% of the &quot;Evening Tribune&quot; while the weekly &quot;Otago Witness&quot; was 20% and another weekly, the &quot;Penny Post&quot; was 6.1%. The &quot;Saturday Advertiser&quot; is believed to have reached around 20% of the total population.

===Sold back into public ownership===
The loss of circulation and thus revenue to the &quot;Morning Herald&quot;, coupled with the collapse in 1878 of the City of Glasgow Bank leading to a withdrawal of British funds which impacted on Otago runholders and weakened a struggling economy had a serious financial impact on the business. Reed and Fenwick had also assumed a considerable debt to buy their rival. In desperation Fenwick urged Reed to take the prudent course and protect themselves to the floating of the business as a public company. 
A prospectus was issued in April 1878 with William H. Reynolds, H. S. Chapman, Sir John L. C. Richardson, Robert Stout, Robert Campbell, Thomas Hocken, George Fenwick, James Marshall, Walter Guthrie, Bendix Hallenstein, Henry F. Hardy, John Reid, and Richard H. Leary listed as among the provisional directors, of a company to be known as the Otago Daily Times and Witness Newspapers Company, Ltd. The capital was £40,000 in 4,000 shares of £10 each, of which £7.10s was to be called up.

The flotation of the company was successful, and at a meeting of shareholders held on 10 June 1878. William H. Reynolds, Thomas Hocken, Richard H. Leary, Walter Guthrie, James Smith, and George Fenwick were elected directors. Reynolds was appointed chairman and Fenwick was made managing director. Reed remained editor of the &quot;ODT&quot; but departed in 1878 to become New Zealand&#x27;s immigration agent in Ireland.

Fenwick believed that the only one course open to the company to gain circulation and stop the progress of their rival was to reduce the price of the &quot;ODT&quot; to match that of the &quot;Morning Herald&quot;; but it took several years before his more conservative colleagues on the board would agree to this, the &quot;ODT&quot; reducing its price to one penny on 1 February 1881. The result completely justified as the reduction as the circulation of the &quot;ODT&quot; rapidly increased initially to 4,100 and then to 4,000 to 6,000 in 1882 at the expense of its rival which steadily declined until after a hopeless struggle it became an evening paper in May 1884 and changing its name to the &quot;Evening Herald&quot;’ Despite this and a change of ownership it ceased publication in August 1890 when it merged with the &quot;Globe&quot; a liberal publication that had been launched in response to a maritime shrike. The &quot;Globe&quot; creased publication in 1893. The &quot;ODT&quot; was still however less popular than that of the &quot;Evening Star&quot; which had a circulation of 5,300 a day in 1876 and over 7,500 in 1881.

The newspapers opposition to the policies of both Vogel and Sir George Grey changed when it became a public company under the chairmanship of W. H. Reynolds as he was an ally of both Vogel and Grey.

The business added a lithographic department in 1879.
When Richard Twopeny resigned from the editorship of the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; in 1890 after a disagreement with the directors, Fenwick also took on the editorship duties.
The introduction of linotype machines in 1898 lead to the redundancy of 30 compositors.
In 1909 Fenwick handed the editorship of the newspaper to James Hutchison. While William Easton succeeded him as manager in 1919, Fenwick remained managing director of the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; until his death.
By the first decade of the twentieth century weekday issues of the &quot;ODT&quot; had eight pages, which occasionally doubled on Saturdays. By late 1910 the weekday issues had increased to 10 to 12 pages.

===Impact of World War I===
Prior to the commencement of the First World War the cost of imported newsprint, was £12 a ton (landed). As the war progressed freight cost began to increase and contracts became more onerous which forced the &quot;ODT&quot; to increase its price to 1½d, the first price increase since 1881. Even after the end of the war the landed cost of newsprint continued to climb, reaching at its peak £60 a ton which forced the newspaper to increase in price on 8 March 1920 to 2d a copy.

===Amalgamation===
As has been seen most of its Dunedin opposition papers were short lived, with only the &quot;Evening Star&quot; surviving until it merged with the &quot;ODT&quot; in 1975 forming a new company, Allied Press, and the ODT moved to the Evening Star Building (now the Allied Press Building) in Stuart Street in June 1977. The &quot;Evening Star&quot; ceased publication in November 1979 because its readership was declining. As a result, the Allied Press, now publishes the &quot;ODT&quot; and several smaller papers throughout New Zealand, including the &quot;Greymouth Star&quot; and the former &quot;The Lakes District and Central Otago News&quot;.

On 5 January 1998 the &quot;ODT&quot; published for the first time on a new Goss International printing press; on the same day it introduced a new masthead reading simply &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;, marking Otago&#x27;s 150th anniversary year of Pākehā settlement.

===Into the 21st century===
On 16 March 2016, the newspaper launched a metered paywall on its website limiting readers to between 15 and 20 free articles per month before having to pay a NZ$27 monthly subscription. While &quot;The Spinoff&quot; claimed that this made the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; the first major news publisher in New Zealand to implement a paywall, StopPress stated that the &quot;ODT&quot; was following the lead of other domestic news publications including the &quot;Ashburton Guardian&quot;, the &quot;Gisborne Herald&quot;, and the &quot;National Business Review&quot;. The &quot;ODT&quot; did not implement its paywall until September 2022, with new subscribers being charged NZ$15 a month while print subscribers were able to access online content for free.

==Policies and personages==
While having politically conservative views during Fenwick&#x27;s long tenure, the &quot;ODT&quot; was active in many campaigns for social reform, none more important than the exposure of sweat shop following the sermon by Presbyterian minister Rutherford Waddell in October 1888 &quot;On the sin of cheapness&quot;, against sweat-shop labour in the clothing industry. The cause was taken up by George Fenwick in a series of articles written by the newspaper&#x27;s chief reporter Silas Spragg (1852–1935) and published in January 1889 which described working conditions in Dunedin. In response to newspaper&#x27;s articles which stirred many of the local community into action, a royal commission on sweating was established in 1890. Its conclusions and recommendations formed the basis of many of the country&#x27;s social reforms of the following decade.
In 1894, the newspaper attacked conditions in Dunedin&#x27;s slaughter-houses, which resulted in a poll in April 1895 which approved the establishment of public abattoirs.
During Fenwick&#x27;s editorship the newspaper also supported funding of the University of Otago, a women&#x27;s hospital ward, the expansion of the University of Otago Medical School, and the Hocken Library.

Sid Scales was a cartoonist for the &quot;ODT&quot; for 30 years until his retirement in 1981. Queenstown artist Garrick Tremain was then the principal cartoonist until he stopped working for the paper in the wake of the 2019 measles cartoon controversy (see below).

== Controversy ==
In December 2019, the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; was heavily criticized for publishing a cartoon by the Queenstown–based cartoonist and painter Garrick Tremain which seemed to mock a measles outbreak in Samoa. The measles crisis caused 4,000 confirmed cases and killed 55 people, most of them children under the age of 4. The newspaper later apologized, saying, &quot;The content and timing of the cartoon were insensitive, and we apologise without reservation for publishing it&quot;. On 23 December, the New Zealand Media Council ruled that Tremain&#x27;s cartoon was &quot;gratuitously hurtful and discriminatory&quot; in response to 130 complaints.

University of Otago student, Millie Lovelock, was a student columnist of &quot;A Situation Report&quot; from late 2014 to March 2017. She addressed issues of sexism, cuts to humanities courses and concerns on the future for young women. Her views on misogyny and the &quot;toxic masculinity&quot; evidenced by the nation&#x27;s rugby culture drew considerable complaint in the &quot;ODT&quot;″s letters to the editor pages. &quot;ODT&quot; journalist Vaughan Elder reported that she was &quot;so polarising&quot; and that &quot;predominantly older white men&quot; took issue with her opinions. After finishing her master&#x27;s degree, Lovelock left journalism to continue her career as a musician and won the Taite Music Prize for Best Independent Debut in May 2020 for her album &quot;Relief&quot; (2019).

<doc id="1050513" wikidata="Q6488359" url="?curid=1050513" title="Lapland Ranger Regiment">
<text>The Lapland Ranger Regiment (), designations I 22, I 22/Fo 66 and I 22/GJ 66, was a Swedish Army light infantry regiment, one of the few new formations raised in the 20th century. The regiment was garrisoned in Lapland. The unit was disbanded as a result of the disarmament policies set forward in the Defence Act of 2000.

== History ==

The regiment traced its origins from the elite &quot;Skidlöparbataljonen&quot; (Skirunners Battalion), of Norrbotten Regiment (I 19), the battalion was raised in 1910 as the first modern ranger unit of the Swedish Army and the first unit specializing in arctic warfare. The battalion was garrisoned in northern Lapland Kiruna in 1940 and was renamed in 1943 as &quot;Jägarbataljon K&quot; (Ranger Battalion K), K for Kiruna, which became Sweden&#x27;s first special operation unit. In 1945 the battalion became an independent training unit under the army high command as the Army Ranger School for setting up and training three army corps ranger battalions and long range recon companies and special operation units. The unit received independent regimental status with a regimental standard from the hands of the King in 1975, and was renamed &quot;Lapplands jägarregemente I 22&quot;, I 22 stood for infantry regiment no 22. The Lapland Ranger Regiment was finally disbanded in 2000. Its tasks and personnel were largely transferred to the heavier equipped Norrland Dragoon Regiment (K 4), a former mounted ranger cavalry unit that had a de facto light infantry role, later in turn reorganized and downsized as the Army Ranger Battalion as part of the Norrbotten Regiment, the original mother regiment of Lapland Rangers.

The rangers of the Lapland Ranger Regiment and the Ranger School wore a green &quot;commando&quot; beret, from 1960 onward, with the unit&#x27;s insignia a crowned wolf&#x27;s head. For ranger qualification the soldiers had to pass a demanding 7-day march exercise, with daily distances between 25 and 50 kilometers (15–31 miles) carrying 35 to 50 kilo (77–110 pounds) rucksacks, in rough mountain terrain. Despite this the pass rate was high, due to 2 to 3 months prior extensive tough heavy load marching training for recruits.

== Organisation ==
The regiment raised independent ranger companies, one or two per year, that was specialized in behind enemy lines operations in Arctic environment on small unit bases, ranger troops. The requirement was for a ranger troop to be able to sustain high combat capability for at least 30 days of operations behind enemy lines without supplies.

<text>Quilpie ( ) is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Quilpie, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Quilpie had a population of 530 people.

The town is the administrative centre of the Quilpie Shire local government area. The town of Toompine is also within the locality.

The economy of the area is based on the grazing and mining industries. The area has one of the largest deposits of boulder opal in the world, and also has extensive deposits of gas and oil.

== Geography ==
Quilpie is in Channel Country on the banks of the Bulloo River. It is on the Diamantina Developmental Road, west of Charleville, west of Toowoomba and west of the state capital, Brisbane. Quilpie is the administrative centre of the Quilpie Shire.

The town of Quilpie is in the north of the locality, while the smaller town of Toompine () is in the south of the locality.

Quilpie has quite a few trees but sometimes drought takes over and the landscape can become dry and desolate.

== History ==
Quilpie is believed to lie on the border of the Bunthamurra and Margany Indigenous Australian tribal areas.

Margany (also known as Marganj, Mardigan, Marukanji, Maranganji) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Margany people. The Margany language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Quilpie Shire, taking in Quilpie, Cheepie and Beechal extending towards Eulo and Thargomindah, as well as the properties of Dynevor Downs and Ardoch.

The township of Toompine was surveyed in 1870. The name &quot;Toompine&quot; is an Indigenous language word meaning &quot;leech&quot;.

Toompine Provisional School and Duck Creek Provisional School both opened in 1900. In 1901, they became half-time schools (meaning they shared a single teacher between the two schools). Toompine Provisional School closed in July 1902, enabling Duck Creek Provisional School to revert to full-time status. Due to low student numbers, Duck Creek Provisional School closed in 1905.

Quilpie was gazetted as a town in 1917 owing to the Western railway line that was laid down from Brisbane. It takes its name from the Indigenous Australian word for stone curlew, &quot;quilpeta&quot;. The name was proposed by pastoralist James Hammond of Tenham Station. The Queensland Railways Department mistakenly named the railway station &quot;Quillpill&quot;. The town and station name were standardised to Quilpie on 16 June 1917 by the Governor in Council. From 1954 to 1994, The Westlander was split at Charleville. the Quilpie Section (3Q02) was known as the &quot;Flying Flea&quot; and it consisted of two passenger carriages, a guards van and power van. both 3Q02 and 3V02 were withdrawn in 1994 and replaced by TrainLink bus services

Quilpie State School opened on 10 September 1918. The school began offering secondary education in 1966. On 5 December 2008, it was renamed Quilpie State College.

The first post office was opened in 1921. Two years later the telephone reached Quilpie .

A fire destroyed a block of the main street in 1926. With no town water the residents watched helplessly.

In 1927, the first court house was established.

Prior to 1930, Quilpie was within the Shire of Adavale, headquartered at Adavale. However, the decision to route the railway line through Quilpie rather than Adavale had led to a population drift away from Adavale making Quilpie the larger town. On 17 July 1930, there was a re-organisation of local government in the district, resulting in the abolition of the Shire of Adavale and the creation of the Shire of Quilpie with Quilpie as its headquarters.

St Finbarr&#x27;s Catholic Church was officially opened and dedicated on Sunday 14 December 1930 by the Bishop of Toowoomba, James Byrne. It was built from timber. In 1972, it was replaced with a brick church designed by W. Durack.

A bore was sunk into the Great Artesian Basin in 1933. It provided drinking water for the town and between 1952 and 1963 the hot water was used to generate electricity for the town.

On 15 October 1936, St Matthew&#x27;s Anglican Church was officially opened and dedicated by Bishop Dixon. It was built from timber and could seat 100 people. The church bell was donated by the people of Cunnamulla.

St Finbarr&#x27;s Catholic School opened in early 1950, shortly after the arrival in January 1950 of three Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, Sisters Macrina, Carmel and Magdalen. By the end of 1950, over 60 children were enrolled. A boarding school for boys and girls was opened in 1951. The first lay teacher, Michael West, was appointed in 1983. When the boarding facility closed in 2008, it was the last rural Catholic primary boarding school in Queensland. In 2009, the first lay principal, Aaron Wells, was appointed and the administration of the school passed from the Sisters to the Catholic Education Office of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Toowoomba who operate the school in the Mary MacKillop tradition (MacKillop being the founder of the Sisters of St Joseph).

Goombie State School opened on Goombie Station (north of the town of Quilpie at ) on 27 January 1875 and closed on 9 December 1977.

The current Quilpie Public Library building opened in 2005.

<text>Alexander Bruce Bielaski (April 2, 1883 – February 19, 1964) was an American lawyer and government official who served as the second director of the Bureau of Investigation (now the Federal Bureau of Investigation) from 1912 to 1919.

==Early life and education==
Bielaski was born in Montgomery County, Maryland to the son of Methodist minister Alexander Bielaski. His grandfather was the Civil War Captain Alexander Bielaski and his uncle was the first Polish American in Major League Baseball, Oscar Bielaski. His sister, Ruth Shipley, would head the Passport Division of the United States Department of State for 27 years. 

He received a law degree from The George Washington University Law School in 1904 where he was a founding father of the Gamma Eta chapter of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. 

==Career==
That same year he joined the Department of Justice. Like his predecessor Stanley Finch, Bielaski worked his way up through the Justice Department. He served as a special examiner in Oklahoma where he &quot;straightened out the court records&quot; and aided in the reorganization of Oklahoma&#x27;s court system when the Oklahoma Territory became a state. Returning to Washington, Bielaski entered the Bureau of Investigation and rose to become Finch&#x27;s assistant. In this position he was in charge of administrative matters for the Bureau. At the end of April 1912, Attorney General George W. Wickersham appointed Bielaski to replace Finch. As Chief, Bielaski oversaw a steady increase in the resources and responsibilities assigned to the Bureau.

After leaving the Bureau in 1919, Bielaski entered into private law practice. According to The New York Times, while on a trip to Cuernavaca, Mexico in 1922, Bielaski was kidnapped.&quot; He escaped three days later, saving himself and the ten thousand dollars gathered to rescue him. The local Mexican press accused him of &quot;self-abduction&quot; to gain notoriety. Two weeks later, after he testified before a judge, the case was closed. 

Bielaski was very involved in the Delta Tau Delta fraternity and the greater fraternity community. He served three terms as international president of Delt from 1919 to 1925. In 1924 He was elected Chairman of the National Interfraternity Conference (currently known as the North American Interfraternity Conference).

Bielaski worked undercover as a Prohibition agent operating a decoy speakeasy in New York City. From 1929 to 1959 he headed the National Board of Fire Underwriters&#x27; team of arson investigators. In 1938, he served as president of the Society of Former Special Agents. He died on February 19, 1964, at the age of eighty.

<text>The Chen-style tai chi () is a Northern Chinese martial art and the original form of tai chi. Chen-style is characterized by silk reeling, alternating fast and slow motions, and bursts of power (&quot;fa jin&quot;).

Traditionally, tai chi is practiced as a martial art but has expanded into other domains of practice such as health or performances. Some argue that Chen-style tai chi has preserved and emphasized the martial efficacy to a greater extent.

== History ==

=== Origin theories ===
It is not clear how the Chen family actually came to practise their unique martial style and contradictory &quot;histories&quot; abound. What is known is that the other four tai chi styles (Yang, Sun, Wu and Wu (Hao)) trace their teachings back to Chen village in the early 1800s.

The Chen family were originally from Hongtong County in Shanxi. In the 13th or 14th century, later documents claim that the head of the Chen family, Chen Bu (陳仆; 陈卜), migrated to Wen County, Henan. The new area was originally known as Changyang Cun () and grew to include a large number of Chen descendants. Because of the three deep ravines beside the village it came to be known as Chen Jia Gou (). According to Chen Village family history, Chen Bu was a skilled martial artist who started the martial arts tradition within Chen Village. For generations onwards, the Chen Village was known for their martial arts. 

The special nature of tai chi practice was attributed to the ninth generation Chen Village leader, Chen Wangting. He codified pre-existing Chen training practice into a corpus of seven routines. This included five routines of 108 form Long Fist (一百零八勢長拳) and a more rigorous routine known as Cannon Fist (炮捶一路). Chen Wangting integrated different elements of Chinese philosophy into the martial arts training to create a new approach that we now recognize as the Internal martial arts. These included the principles of Yin Yang, the techniques of &quot;Daoyin&quot;, &quot;Tui na&quot;, &quot;Qigong&quot;, and the theory of meridians. Those theories are encountered in Classical Chinese Medicine and described in such texts as the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;. In addition, Wangting incorporated the boxing theories from sixteen different martial art styles as described in the classic text &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot;, written by the Ming dynasty General Qi Jiguang.

Chen Changxing, a 14th-generation Chen Village martial artist, synthesized Chen Wangting&#x27;s open fist training corpus into two routines that came to be known as &quot;Old Frame&quot; (老架; lao jia). Those two routines are named individually as the First Form (Yilu; 一路) and the Second Form (Erlu; 二路, more commonly known as the Cannon Fist 炮捶). Chen Changxing, contrary to Chen family tradition, also took the first recorded non-family member as a disciple, Yang Luchan, who went on to popularize the art throughout China, but as his own family tradition known as Yang-style tai chi. The Chen family system was only taught within the Chen village region until 1928.

Chen Youben, also of the 14th Chen generation, is credited with starting another Chen training tradition. This system also based on two routines is known as &quot;Small Frame&quot; (). Small Frame system of training eventually lead to the formation of two other styles of tai chi that show strong Chen family influences, Zhaobao tai chi and &quot;Hulei jia&quot; (). However, these are not considered a part of the Chen family lineage.

==== Other origin stories ====
Some legends assert that a disciple of Zhang Sanfeng named Wang Zongyue taught Chen family the martial art later to be known as tai chi.

Other legends speak of , reputedly a monk from Wudang mountain who came to Chen village. He is said to have helped transform the Chen family art with Chen Wangting by emphasizing internal fighting practices. However, there are significant difficulties with this explanation, as it is no longer clear if their relationship was that of teacher/student or even who taught whom.

===Recent history===
During the second half of the 19th century, Yang Luchan and his family established a reputation of Yang-style tai chi throughout the Qing empire. Few people knew that Yang Luchan first learned his martial arts from Chen Changxing in the Chen Village. Fewer people still visited the Chen village to improve their understanding of tai chi. Only Wu Yuxiang, a student of Yang Luchan and the eventual founder of Wu (Hao)-style tai chi, was known to have briefly studied the Chen Family small frame system under Chen Qingping. This situation changed with the fall of the Qing empire when Chinese society sought to discover and improve their understanding of traditional philosophies and methods.

The current availability and popularity of Chen-style tai chi is reflective of the radical changes that occurred within Chinese society during the 20th century. In the decline of the Qing dynasty, the creation of the Republic of China and subsequently the Chinese Communist Revolution, Chen-style tai chi underwent a period of re-discovery, popularization, and finally internationalization.

In 1928, (1893–1972) and later his uncle, Chen Fake moved from Chen village to teach in Beiping (now known as Beijing). Their Chen-style practice was initially perceived as radically different from other prevalent martial art schools (including established tai chi traditions) of the time. Chen Fake proved the effectiveness of Chen-style tai chi through various private challenges and even a series of &quot;lei tai&quot; matches. Within a short time, the Beijing martial arts community was convinced of the effectiveness of Chen-style tai chi and a large group of martial enthusiasts started to train and publicly promote it.

The increased interest in Chen-style tai chi led Tang Hao, one of the first modern Chinese martial art historians, to visit and document the martial lineage in Chen Village in 1930 with Chen Ziming. During the course of his research, he consulted with a manuscript written by 16th generation family member Chen Xin (陳鑫; Ch&#x27;en Hsin; 1849–1929) detailing Chen Xin&#x27;s understanding of the Chen Village heritage. Chen Xin&#x27;s nephew, Chen Chunyuan, together with Chen Panling (president of Henan Province Martial Arts Academy), Han Zibu (president of Henan Archives Bureau), Wang Zemin, Bai Yusheng of Kaiming Publishing House, Guan Baiyi (director of Henan Provincial Museum) and Zhang Jiamou helped publish Chen Xin&#x27;s work posthumously. The book entitled &quot;Chen Style Taijiquan Illustrated and Explained&quot; (太極拳圖說 see tai chi classics) was published in 1933 with the first print run of thousand copies.

For nearly thirty years, until his death in 1958, Chen Fake diligently taught the art of Chen-style tai chi to a select group of students. As a result, a strong Beijing Chen-style tradition centered around his &quot;New Frame&quot; variant of Chen Village &quot;Old Frame&quot; survived after his death. His legacy was spread throughout China by the efforts of his senior students.

The Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) resulted in a period of Chen-style tai chi decline. Radical students led a campaign to suppress the &quot;Four Olds&quot;, which included the practice of martial arts. Training facilities were closed and practitioners were prosecuted. Many Chen masters were publicly denounced. For example, Chen Zhaopei was pushed to the point of attempting suicide, and Hong Junsheng was left malnourished. Training was continued in secret and at great personal risk ensuring the continuation of the tradition.

During the Era of Reconstruction (1976–1989), the policy of repression of traditional Chinese culture was reversed. Under this new climate, Chen-style tai chi was once again allowed to be practiced openly. Through a series of government-sponsored meetings and various provincial and national tournaments, Chen-style tai chi regained its reputation as an important branch of Chinese martial arts. In addition, those meetings created a new generation of Chen-style teachers.
The start of the internationalisation of Chen-style can be traced to 1981. A tai chi association from Japan went on a promotional tour to the Chen village. The success of this trip created interest in Chen-style tai chi both nationally and internationally. Soon tai chi enthusiasts from other countries started their pilgrimage to Chen village. The increasing interest led all levels of the Chinese governments to improve the infrastructure and support of the village including the establishment of martial art schools, hotels and tourist associations.

In 1983, martial artists from the Chen village received full government support to promote Chen-style tai chi abroad. Some of the best Chen stylists became international &quot;roaming ambassadors&quot; known as the &quot;Four Buddha Warrior Attendants&quot;. Those four Chen stylists including Chen Xiaowang, Chen Zhenglei, Wang Xian (王西安) and Zhu Tiancai (朱天才) traveled relentlessly giving global workshops and creating an international group of Chen-style practitioners.

Other well known Chen teachers active in China or overseas include:
*Chen Yu (陳瑜; grandson of Chen Fake)
*Chen Bing (陳炳; Chen Village)
*Chen Boxiang (陈伯祥; Chen Village)
*Chen Xiaoxing (陳小星; Chen Village)
*Chen Peishan (陳沛山) and Chen Peiju (陳沛匊) have been influential in promoting the less-known Chen Village Small Frame tradition
* Tian Jianhua (田剑华; the last living student of Chen Fake, younger brother of Tian Xiuchen, teaching in Beijing)
* Zhang Xuexin (張學信; 1928–2023 disciple of Feng Zhiqiang; teaching in the US),
* Han Kuiyuan (韩奎元; born 1948), disciple of both Tian Xiuchen and Feng Zhiqiang. He is teaching in Hungary.
* Cheng Jincai (程進才; disciple of Chen Zhaokui; The founder of International Chen Style Tai Chi Development Center, Houston, Texas),
* Li Enjiu (李恩久; disciple of Hong Junsheng)
* Joseph Chen Zhonghua (disciple of Hong Junsheng and Feng Zhiqiang; teaching throughout North America),
* Wu (Peter) Shi-zeng (吴仕增; a student of Hong Junsheng in Australia)
* Chen Huixian (陈会贤; Disciple of Chen Zhenglei teaching in the US)
* Chou Wenpei (周文沛; Berkeley, California): Student of , has promoted and documented Chen-style tai chi since 1996.
* Gil Rodrigues, Disciple of Master Chen Ziqiang. He is teaching in Brazil.

In recent decades Chen-style tai chi has come to be recognized as a major style of martial art within China and around the world. A strong Chen tradition have developed in countries such as the US, Canada, Britain, Austria, New Zealand, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia.

=== Tai chi lineage tree with Chen-style focus ===

The story of Chen-style tai chi is rich and complex. The lineage tree is a concise summary and highlights some of the important personalities that contributed to its history. However, there are some missing details that can provide insight to the current understanding of this art.

Chen Xin (1849–1929), 8th generation Chen family member, provided one of the most important written description of the Chen style. He was the grandson of Chen Youshen (陈有恒), 6th generation Chen family member. Chen Youshen was the brother of Chen Youben (陈有本), the creator of Small Frame. Chen Xin&#x27;s father was Chen Zhongshen and Chen Xin&#x27;s uncle, Chen Jishen were twins. In that 7th generation Chen family, Chen Zhongshen, Chen Jishen, Chen Gengyun (陈耕耘, the son of Chen Chanxing), Yang Luchan (杨露禅, founder of Yang Style) and Chen Qingping (陈清萍, promoter of Zhaobao style tai chi) were all martial artists with exceptional abilities.

Chen Xin initially trained with his father but his father ordered him to study literature rather than the martial arts. It was only later that he decided to use his literature skills to describe his understanding of the secrets of Chen style. In Chen Xin&#x27;s generation, his older brother, Chen Yao and his cousin, Chen Yanxi (陈延熙, father of Chen Fake) were considered masters of the Chen style. Chen Xin&#x27;s legacy is his book and his student, Chen Ziming (陈子明). Chen Ziming, went on to promote Chen style small frame throughout China and wrote books promoting the art. Chen Ziming was in the same generation as Chen Fake.

== Forms ==
Forms, also called &quot;Taolu&quot; (Chinese: 套路, tàolù: routine, pattern, standard method), play a fundamental role in Chen-style tai chi as choreographed sequences of movements that serve as repositories for various methods, techniques, stances, and types of energy and force production. Within the Chen-style tai chi tradition, there are at least two forms: &quot;Yi Lu&quot; (First Form) and &quot;Er Lu&quot; (Second Form). These forms represent the embodiment of the intricate theories unique to the Chen style. In the words of Chen Fake, the last great proponent of the Chen style in the modern era, &#x27;This set of Taijiquan does not have one technique which is useless. Everything was carefully designed for a purpose&#x27; (&#x27;这套拳没有一个动作是空的, 都是有用的&#x27;). A correct Chen-style tai chi form is grounded in the same fundamental principles, transcending mere external appearances.

Within the Chen-style tai chi umbrella, there are various teaching traditions, and their practices may often vary somewhat from one another - often due to differences in how they cultivated their skill throughout their decades of practice. Chen Ziming wrote, &quot;In the beginning of the training, conform to patterns. At an intermediate level, you may change patterns. Then finally, patterns are driven by spirit.” Over time and distance within the Chen style, these interpretations have given rise to subdivisions. Each variation is influenced by its own history and the training insights of master teachers. The current subdivisions include historical training methods from Chen Village, forms derived from the lineage of Chen Fake (commonly known as Big or Large Frame, including Old Frame and New Frame), Chen family Small Frame attributed to teachings within the Chen village, training methods from Chen Fake&#x27;s students, and closely related traditions like Zhaobao tai chi. In the past, the effectiveness of training methods was determined through actual combat, but such tests of skill are less common in the modern era. With no recognized central authorities for tai chi, authenticity is often determined through anecdotal stories or appeals to historical lineage. However, the Chen style practitioner upholds a more stringent requirement, focusing on the underlying principles rather than external appearances. 

As practitioners delve into the different frames and forms within Chen-style tai chi, they strive to honor and embody the profound principles handed down through the Chen Family&#x27;s tai chi legacy. While uncertainties may exist due to the lack of written sources and the reliance on oral traditions, practitioners endeavor to interpret each subdivision. The Chen Family&#x27;s tai chi legacy continues to captivate practitioners, as they aspire to unlock the essence of Chen-style tai chi and integrate its profound principles into their dedicated practice.

=== Fundamental principles ===

The fundamental principles of Chen-style tai chi find their roots in various poems, stories from Chen Village, and the teachings of Chen Fake. These principles, which encapsulate the essence of the art, can be summarized as follows:

* Keep the head suspended from above (虚领顶劲, xū lǐng dǐng jìn)
* Keep the body centered and upright (立身中正, lìshēn zhōngzhèng)
* Loosen the shoulders and sink the elbows (松肩沉肘, sōng jiān chén zhǒu)
* Hollow the chest and settle the waist (含胸塌腰, hán xiōng tā yāo)
* Drop the heart/mind energy [to the dantian] (心气下降, xīn qì xià jiàng)
* Breathe naturally (呼吸自然, hū xī zì rán)
* Loosen the hips and keep the knees bent (松胯屈膝, sōng kuà qū xī)
* The crotch is arch shaped (裆劲开圆, dāng jìn kāi yuán)
* Empty and solid separate clearly (虚实分明, xū shí fēn míng)
* The top and bottom coordinate (上下相随. shàng xià xiāng suí)
* Hardness and softness facilitate each other (刚柔相济, gāng róu xiāng jì)
* Fast and slow alternate (快慢相间, kuài màn xiāng jiàn)
* The external shape travels a curve; (外形走弧线, wài xíng zǒu hú xiàn)
* The internal energy travels a spiral path (内劲走螺旋, nèi jìn zǒu luó xuán)
* The body leads the hand (以身领手, yǐ shēn lǐng shǒu)
* The back waist is an axis (以腰为轴, yǐ yāo wèi zhóu)

=== Historical forms from Chen Village ===
The term &#x27;historical forms&#x27; refers to training methods described in traditional boxing manuals from Chen Village, as well as through oral recollections and verbal histories. Although efforts have been made to find and recover them, most of these forms are considered lost and are no longer practiced.

Chen Wangting, a ninth generation Chen Village leader, was credited with the creation of seven routines:
* The First Set of Thirteen Movements with 66 Forms (头套十三势 66式)
* The Second Set with 27 forms (二套 27式)
* The Third Set with 24 forms also known as the Four Big Hammer Set (三套24式 又称大四套捶)
* Red Fist with 23 forms (红拳 23式)
* The Fifth Set with 29 forms (五套29式)

* The Long Fist with 108 forms (长拳 108式)
* The Cannon Fist with 71 forms now commonly known as the Second Form, Erlu (炮捶 俗称二路71式)
* Weapon forms including the broadsword, the sword, the staff and the hook (器械 刀, 枪, 棍, 钩等多种)
* Two man training routines (对练套路)

The first five sets were a curriculum known as the five routines of tai chi (太極拳五路). The 108-form Long Fist (Boxing) (一百零八勢長拳, Yībǎi líng bā shì zhǎngquán) and a form known as Cannon Fist (Pounding) (炮捶, Pào chuí) were considered to be a separate curriculum.

Most of these forms were not commonly practiced after the time of Chen Changxing (陳長興, 1771–1853) and Chen Youben (陳有本, 1780–1858) of the 14th generation. Around that time, the curriculum was streamlined into two forms representing the two paths of curricula, the Yilu, the First Path, or Road, trained by the Thirteen Movements (十三势, Shísān shì) form, and the Erlu, the Second Path, trained by the Cannon Fist (炮捶, Pào chuí) form.

In order to preserve it, Chen Xin (1849–1929) recorded the 66-movement Thirteen Postures (十三势) form as it was passed to him in his book, &quot;Chen Family Taijiquan Illustrated and Explained&quot; (陳氏太極拳圖說, Chén shì tàijí quán túshuō).

Push hands as a means of training was not mentioned in the Chen historical manuals, rather it was described as a form of pair training. From a military perspective, empty-hand training was a foundation for weapons training and push hands training was a method to prevail in the bind (two weapons locked or pressed against each other). In terms of weapons, the Chen clan writings described a variety of weapons training including: spear, staff, swords, halberd, mace, and sickles, but the manuals specifically described training for spear (枪, qiāng), staff (棍, gùn), broadsword (saber)(刀, dāo), and straight sword (剑, jiàn).

== Existing Chen Village forms ==
The two paths represent the two main forms used in any Chen-style tai chi training. The main variants in training with direct connection to Chen Village are: Large Frame (Old Frame and New Frame) and Small Frame. These frames developed and passed down by key figures such as Chen Zhaopei, Chen Zhaokui and others, embody distinct lineages and training approaches. From the dedication of Chen Zhaopei in preserving the art to Chen Zhaokui&#x27;s introduction of innovative practices in New Frame, the evolution of Chen-style tai chi continues. The Small Frame gaining international recognition, shares similarities with teachings by Chen Xin and Chen Ziming. Despite their differences, these frames share common origins and principles, making them integral to the Chen-style tai chi system.

=== Two-path curriculum ===
Today, the two-path curriculum, originally developed by Chen Changxing, a master of the 14th generation, serves as the foundation for training in all branches of Chen-style tai chi. Each path is typically associated with a specific form: the First Form (Yi Lu), also known as the Thirteen Movements (十三势, Shísān shì), and the Second Form (Er Lu), sometimes referred to as Cannon Fist (炮捶, Pào Chuí). These paths follow distinct approaches to training.

The Yilu form initiates students into the fundamental principles of tai chi. It emphasizes essential aspects such as footwork, stances, and overall movement. Internal development, including silk reeling training, is also a key focus. The Yilu form aims to teach practitioners how to synchronize their minds, bodies, and internal energy in accordance with tai chi principles. Chen-style practitioners describe the Yilu form as having large and stretching movements, brisk and steady footwork, a naturally straight body, and the integration of internal energy throughout the entire body. (拳架舒展大方，步法轻灵稳健，身法中正自然，内劲统领全身。)

The Yilu form requires the practitioner to closely coordinate their mind, intent, internal energy, and body. Externally, the form&#x27;s movements follow an arc, while internally, the energy flows in a spiral pattern. This interplay between soft external actions and corresponding hard internal actions is a hallmark of the Yilu form. (练习时，要求意、气、身密切配合，外形走弧线，内劲走螺旋，缠绕圆转，外柔内刚。) Training application on this path is through the method of push hands. Push hands, a partner exercise, is commonly used to apply the principles learned in Yilu training. Push hands involves controlling an opponent through yielding, attaching, redirecting, manipulating, grappling, breaking structure, and other skills. Originally focused on refining the usage of tai chi, push hands has evolved over time into a competitive sport that is somewhat disconnected from its martial roots.

Erlu, the Second Path, typically comes after a student has achieved proficiency in Yilu. Erlu training concentrates on expressing the internal skills cultivated during Yilu practice. The applications in Erlu incorporate more striking, jumping, lunging, and athletically demanding movements. While Yilu emphasized using the body to guide the hands (以身领手, yǐ shēn lǐng shǒu), Erlu shifts the emphasis to using the hands to lead the body (以手领身, yǐ shǒu lǐng shēn). In terms of appearance, the Erlu form is often executed at a faster pace and is characterized by more explosive movements compared to Yilu. The intent of Erlu is focused on self-defense, with each posture training the practitioner for strikes or breaks rather than grappling. The techniques in Erlu employ smaller and tighter circles to generate power. 

It is worth noting that while the Cannon Fist form is widely taught in various traditions, very few teach the self-defense skills associated with Erlu due to their inherent dangers. Even when taught, Erlu self-defense techniques are typically reserved for a select few trusted students. In some training traditions today, both forms may be employed to train practitioners in each path of the curriculum.

=== Frames - Large and Small, Old and New ===
Within the Chen Family, there are currently three main variants, or frames, of Chen-style forms that are practiced today. Each frame represents a distinct perspective within the Chen-style tai chi tradition. The concept of frames (架, jià, frame, rack, framework) refers to the general width of stances and range of motion employed in the forms. For example, in the Large Frame (大架, Dà jià ), the standard horse stance is at least two and a half shoulder widths wide, and the hand techniques appear large and expansive. On the other hand, the Small Frame (小架, Xiǎo jià), the standard horse stance is two shoulders width wide and the hand techniques are perceived as generally shorter and more compact. 

The classification of all tai chi styles into &quot;frames&quot; based on the size of stance and other criteria was introduced by Tang Hao in the late 1930s and became common practice by the 1950s. Chen Fake&#x27;s Chen-style tai chi was classified as Large Frame, while Wu Yuxiang&#x27;s Wu (Hao)-style tai chi was classified as Small Frame at the time, based on research into the Hao family branch. Chen Qingping, Wu Yuxiang&#x27;s Chen-style teacher, is associated with the Zhaobao style which includes large and small frame training, and this also suggested a small frame lineage. To simplify matters for new students, the Chen Family divided their tai chi into Large Frame, originating from Chen Fake, and Small Frame, associated with Chen Ziming. Large Frame may be further divided: Old Frame (老架, Lǎo jia) taught in the Chen Village by Chen Zhaopei and New Frame (新架, Xīn jià) taught in the Chen Village by Chen Zhaokui. Both teachers of Large Frame were students of Chen Fake.

Although the frames share more similarities than differences, the variations provide valuable insights. Despite the existence of clear lineage charts, many students are known to have trained with multiple teachers, often without strict adherence to a single lineage. For instance, Chen Zhaopei studied with his father Chen Dengke, his father&#x27;s uncle Chen Yanxi, and Yanxi&#x27;s son Chen Fake, all of whom are now considered practitioners of the Large Frame. However, Chen Zhaopei also studied theory with Chen Xin, who is now recognized as a Small Frame practitioner.

==== Large Frame: Old Frame (Laojia) tradition ====
In 1958, Chen Zhaopei (陈照丕, 1893–1972), nephew of Chen Fake, returned to visit Chen Village. There, he found that war, hardship, and migration had reduced Chen Style practitioners still teaching in the Village to a couple of aging teachers with a handful of students. He immediately took early retirement and returned to the hardships of village life in order to ensure the survival of his family martial art. His teachings are known today as Laojia (Old Frame).

In Laojia, there are 74 moves in the First Form and 44 moves in the Second Form. Chen Zhaopei recorded photographs of his First Form with instructions in a book, &quot;General Explanations of Taiji Boxing Fundamentals&quot; (太極拳學入門總解, &quot;Tàijí quán xué rùmén zǒng jiě&quot;) published in 1930. In Chen Village, &quot;Laojia&quot; is considered the foundation form. Because it is steady, fluid, and readily comprehended, it is always taught first.

==== Large Frame: New Frame (Xinjia) tradition ====

Near the end of the Cultural Revolution and later after Chen Zhaopei&#x27;s death in 1972, tai chi practitioners in Chen Village petitioned Chen Zhaokui (陈照奎, 1928 – 1981), Chen Fake&#x27;s only living son, to come and continue their education in the art. When Chen Zhaokui visited Chen Village to assist and later succeed Chen Zhaopei in training a new generation of practitioners, (e.g. the &quot;Four Jingang&quot;, aka the &quot;Four Tigers&quot;: Chen Xiaowang (陈小旺), Chen Zhenglei, Wang Xi&#x27;an (王西安), and Zhu Tiancai (朱天才)), he taught Chen Fake&#x27;s practice methods that were unfamiliar to them. He made three separate visits, totaling under two years. Zhu Tian Cai, who was a young man at the time, claimed that they all started calling it &quot;Xinjia&quot; (New Frame) because it seemed adapted from the teachings they had previously learned from Chen Zhaopei, which they called “Laojia” (Old Frame).

In Xinjia, there are 83 moves counted in the First Form and 71 moves in Second Form. Chen Xiaoxing, Chen Xiaowang’s brother and a student of Chen Zhaokui, said the primary differences between the Xinjia and Laojia are the small circles, which highlight the turning of the wrists and make visible the folding of the chest and waist. &quot;Xiongyao zhedie&quot; (chest and waist layered folding) is the coordinated opening and closing of back and chest along with a type of rippling wave (folding) running vertically up and down the dantian/waist area, connected to twisting of the waist/torso. Rotations of the waist and dantian become more apparent in Xinjia.

Chen Zhaopei also added &quot;tuishou&quot; (push hands) and martial application methods over a series of visits. Chen Zhaokui&#x27;s teaching of the Xinjia was explicitly practiced with the purpose of developing tangible and effective martial arts methods based on spiral energy usage, fajin (energy release) and qinna (joint locking) movements. The stances in Xinjia tend to be more compact with the goal of training for better mobility in fighting applications, while they still remain quite low. This includes more dynamic, springing and jumping movements. This form tends to emphasize manipulation, seizing and grappling (qin na) and a tight method of spiral winding for both long and shorter range striking. Zhu Tian Cai has commented that the Xinjia emphasizes the silk reeling movements to help beginners more easily learn the internal principles in form and to make application more obvious in relation to the Old Frame forms. The New Frame Cannon Fist is generally performed faster than other empty hand forms.

Chen Xiaoxing also emphasized that &quot;the fundamental principles of the two frames, (Laojia and Xinjia), are the same with regards to postural requirements and movement principles. Both require the practitioner to exhibit movements that are continuous, round and pliant, connecting all movements section by section and closely synchronising the actions of the upper and lower body...The Old and New Frames should not be viewed as different entities because both are foundation forms. If you look beyond the superficial differences, the Old Frame and New Frame are the same style, sharing the same origin and guiding principles. In Chen Village, people have the advantage of knowing both the first routines.&quot; However, because of common fundamentals and training methods, either frame, Laojia or Xinjia, can each be trained as a complete curriculum.

==== Small Frame tradition ====
The Small Frame (小架, Xiǎo jià) is the most recent subdivision of the Chen Family martial art to gain international recognition. It closely resembles both the 66-movement form described in Chen Xin&#x27;s (陈鑫, 1849–1929) book &quot;Chen Family Taijiquan Illustrated and Explained&quot; (陳氏太極拳圖說, Chén shì tàijí quán túshuō) published posthumously in 1933 and the photographed form of his student, Chen Ziming (陳子明, d.:1951), in his book &quot;Inherited Chen Family Taiji Boxing Art’&quot;’ (1932)&quot;.

The name, nature, and teachings of this Chen subdivision have been a source of confusion for nearly a century. Chen Ziming, in describing the lineage of his art from Chen Wangting to himself, mentioned changes in the Chen Village that led to the division of the art into &quot;old frame&quot; (laojia) of Chen Wangting and &quot;new frame&quot; (xinjia) that he learned. This was the first published reference dividing Chen-style tai chi into frames. Chen Xin&#x27;s book did not mention frames since there was little or no formal distinction between lineages or branches of teaching methods within the Chen Village.

In Xiaojia, there are 78 moves in the First Form and 50 moves in the Second Form. And, some lineages teach additional forms that may date back to Chen Wangting&#x27;s original system. Xiaojia is known mainly for encouraging students to seek to internalize spiral movements while practicing the form. Most spiral silk reeling action is within the body. The limbs are the last place the motion occurs. Stances seem smaller because the feet do not turn outward in order to maintain a rounded crotch, the front hip is allowed to fold, and the pelvis is not forced forward. The palms must stay below the eyebrows and may not cross the center line of the torso. The body is constrained from shifting left and right horizontally except when stepping. Fajin may be expressed, but it is more calm.

Despite its growing international recognition, authentic Xiaojia instructors are still rare, especially internationally. However, this is beginning to change, and there is a growing body of online and video material available.

==Closely related Chen traditions==
Since the popularization of Chen-style tai chi by Chen Fake and the discovery of the rich martial heritage of Chen Village, there have been numerous training methods claiming to be part of Chen-style tai chi. According to Hong Junsheng, a close student of Chen Fake, only direct descendants of the Chen family can truly consider themselves practitioners of Chen Family tai chi. All other practitioners of Chen-style tai chi are regarded as Chen stylists (陈式) as long as they adhere to the unique principles of Chen style. There are several closely related Chen traditions that are recognized, including the Chen tai chi Beijing Branch, which continues the training of Chen Fake, Xinyi Hunyuan tai chi by Feng Zhiqiang, the Practical Method of Hong Junsheng, Zhaobao tai chi, and modern synthetic forms.

===Beijing Branch===
After Chen Fake’s death, his students began passing on what they had learned to their own students. These teachers and their students collectively are referred to as the Beijing Branch. The Beijing forms are counted similarly to those called Xinjia (New Frame, 新架) by Chen Zhaokui&#x27;s students in Chen Village. They are attributed to Chen Fake, and some regard him as the originator of the branch.

When Chen Zhaokui (Chen Fake&#x27; son) returned to Chen Village, he taught Chen Fake&#x27;s form. The unfamiliar teachings became coined as &quot;Xinjia&quot; (New Frame), because they seemed adapted from the earlier frame they had learned, which they then called Old Frame (&quot;Laojia&quot;). Because of this distinction, Chen Fake&#x27;s disciples in Beijing decided to name their master&#x27;s style &quot;Beijing Chen Style&quot; to differentiate it from Chen Village &quot;Xinjia&quot;, and they considered the 1st generation as Chen Fake (17th generation member of Chen clan and 9th generation Grandmaster of Chen-style tai chi). This means that the Beijing disciples of Chen Fake continued the Chen-style tai chi master-lineage (10th, 11th, 12th, 13th generation, etc...), but some also start counting from Chen Fake.

Important for the diffusion of this style was Tian Xiuchen (田秀臣; 1917–1984; 10th generation master of Chen-style tai chi and 2nd generation master of Beijing Chen-style tai chi), the disciple that learned Chen style with Chen Fake for the longest continuous time. He introduced tai chi teaching in Chinese universities. The lineage of this branch continued with masters Tian Qiutian, Tian Qiumao and Tian Qiuxin (11th generation Chen style and 3rd generation Beijing Chen Style).

Because of his location in Beijing, Chen Yu (19th generation member of Chen clan and 11th generation master of Chen-style tai chi and 3rd generation master of Beijing Chen-style tai chi), Chen Zhaokui&#x27;s son (Chen Fake&#x27;s grandson), is often counted among the Beijing Branch, however he is a member of the Chen Family. He studied under his father&#x27;s supervision starting at seven years old. Oftentimes, his style is called &quot;&quot;Chen Taijiquan Gongfu&quot; or &quot;Gongfujia&quot;&quot;, since Chen Yu rebuts the idea that either his father or grandfather (i.e. Chen Fake) ever called their style &quot;Xinjia&quot; or believed that what they practiced was newer than other branches of Chen-style tai chi.

===Xinyi Hunyuan tai chi===
Chen-style Xinyi Hunyuan tai chi (陈式心意混元太极拳), called Hunyuan tai chi for short, was created by Feng Zhiqiang (冯志强; 1928–2012; 10th generation master of Chen-style tai chi and 2nd generation master of Beijing Chen-style tai chi), one of Chen Fake&#x27;s senior students and a student of Hu Yaozhen (胡耀貞; 1897–1973). It is much like the traditional forms of the Beijing branches of Chen-style tai chi with an influence from Xing Yi Quan and Qigong, learned from Hu Yaozhen and Tongbeiquan, learned in his youth. Feng, who died on 5 May 2012, was widely considered the foremost living martial artist of the Chen tradition.

&quot;Hun Yuan&quot; refers to the strong emphasis on circular, &quot;orbital&quot; or spiraling internal principles at the heart of this evolved Chen tradition. While such principles already exist in mainstream Chen-style, the Hun Yuan tradition develops the theme further. Its teaching system pays attention to spiraling techniques in both body and limbs, and how they may be harmoniously coordinated together.

Specifically, the style synthesizes Chen-style tai chi, Xinyi, and Tongbeiquan (both Qigong and, to a lesser degree, martial movements), the styles studied by Feng Zhiqiang at different times. Outwardly, it appears similar to the New Frame Chen forms and teaches beginners/seniors a 24 open-fist form as well as a 24 Qigong system.

The training syllabus also includes 35 Chen Silk-Reeling and condensed 38 and 48 open-fist forms in addition to Chen Fake&#x27;s (modified) Big Frame forms (83 and 71).

The Hunyuan tradition is internationally well organized and managed by Feng&#x27;s daughters and his long-time disciples. Systematic and comprehensive theory/practice international teaching conventions are held yearly. Internally trained instructors teach tai chi for health benefits with many also teaching Chen martial-art applications. Feng&#x27;s specially trained &quot;disciple instructors&quot; teach Chen internal martial art skills of the highest level.

Grandmaster Feng in his late years rarely taught publicly but devoted his energies to training Hun Yuan instructors and an inner core of nine &quot;disciples&quot; that included Cao Zhilin, Chen Xiang, Pan Houcheng, Wang Fengming and Zhang Xuexin.

Han Kuiyuan (韩奎元; 1948-), who is another recognized disciple of Feng Zhiqiang (and formerly Tian Xiuchen), has been teaching Chen style Xinyi Hunyuan tai chi in Hungary since 1997.

===The Practical Method===
This branch of Chen-style tai chi descends through the students of Hong Junsheng, a senior student of Chen Fake, who became a disciple in 1930 and studied daily through 1944 when Hong moved to his ancestral home in Jinan, Shandong. Hong continued to practice and returned to study with Chen Fake in 1956. Modifications to the original forms taught by Chen Fake to Hong and later used in the Practical Method were made during this visit.

Hong appended the term, &quot;Practical Method&quot; (实用拳法, shí yòng quán fǎ), to his teaching method to emphasize the martial aspects of his study and training, as well as the harmonized training syllabus joining gōng (功) and fǎ (法) aspects of training within the Yilu (first road). Some started calling the system Hong-style tai chi, but Hong Junsheng objected to this designation. He claimed he was not the creator of anything. Everything he taught was Chen-style tai chi as taught to him by his teacher, Chen Fake.

Hong taught, in traditional Chen-style tai chi, the First Path (Yilu) used the First Form, without explosive &quot;fajin&quot; (发劲, Send out Strength), and related foundation exercises as a curriculum focused on learning to control one&#x27;s self and move in a tai chi manner. Push hands was the method to learn how to use the First Form’s movements to control opponents. With these situational control skills, the Second Path (Erlu), could be learned as self-defense with the objective of injuring and disabling an attacker as quickly as possible. For this curriculum, the First Form was repurposed to include fajin and the Second Form added. Training methods also included sparring (散手, sǎn shǒu), fighting technique (拳法, quán fǎ: ) and weapons training. Today, however, Yilu and Erlu are used generally to refer to the First and Second Forms, respectively, and teachers often use Second Path skills to demonstrate martial efficacy while teaching the First Form.

In the Practical Method, there are 81 moves in the First Form and 64 moves in the Second Form, which may be joined together, not repeating the joining move, for a form of 144 moves. The sequence and names of the movements are similar to Xinjia and Beijing forms. The Second Form was reduced by naming fewer, but not deleting, moves. However, the manifested small circles and turning of the wrists characteristic of Xinjia are reduced to spirals and helices and internalized. This gives the Practical Method forms more of the look of Laojia.

Hong said Chen Fake taught, &quot;Taijiquan is learned according to the rules (规矩, gui ju).&quot; In this regard, theoretically, the Practical Method aligns closely with the writings of Chen Xin and, hence, Xiaojia, except that one foot is allowed to turn outward 45° so that both hips (kua, 胯) may stay open to round the crotch. Pragmatic oral instructions were passed from Chen Fake to illuminate theoretical principles, such as: Lead inward with the elbow do not lead inward with the hand; Go out with the hand do not go out with the elbow. (收肘不收手，出手不出, Shōu zhǒu bù shōu shǒu, chū shǒu bù chū zhǒu.); Only rotate don&#x27;t move. (只转不动, Zhǐ zhuǎn bù dòng); Better to advance one hair than to retreat one foot. (宁进一毫，不退一尺, Níng jìn yī háo, bù tuì yī chǐ); and many others.

One innovation by Hong Junsheng for teaching movement in the form was the nomenclature, &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; circles. Previously, &quot;shùn chán&quot; (顺缠, following coiling) and &quot;nì chán&quot; (逆缠, opposing coiling) were used to describe silk-reeling rotations and inward and outward arcs and circles of the extremities. This worked well for describing the longitudinal rotations of the arms and legs, but arcs and circles would often have both &quot;shun&quot; and &quot;ni&quot; rotations within them. Hong found it confusing to students to describe complete revolutions. A Positive (formerly &quot;shùn&quot;) Circle rotates inward (&quot;shùn chán&quot;) at the bottom and outward (&quot;nì chán&quot;) at the top, and a Negative (formerly &quot;nì&quot;) Circle rotates inward (&quot;shùn chán&quot;) at the top and outward (&quot;nì chán&quot;) at the bottom. This terminology has been adopted by teachers of many styles of martial arts.

Currently, Li Enjiu is the Standard Bearer and Chen Zhonghua is International Standard bearer of Chen-style tai chi Practical Method. The Chen Style tai chi Practical Method is taught by teachers around the world.

===Zhaobao tai chi and Chen-style tai chi forms===
Zhaobao Village (Zhaopucun 赵堡村) lies about 2 miles (3 km) to the northeast of Chen Village. Since the village was a local trade center and not settled by a single family, Zhaobao tai chi is a true village martial art, and the style was passed master to disciples among the villagers. Village martial arts developed as skills could be brought to a village. There they were merged with prior knowledge and evolved and were taught primarily for common defense. Zhaobao tai chi designates several lineages and traditions rather than a single one. Also, tai chi forms from other nearby villages get grouped with Zhaobao, such as Huleijia (Sudden thunder frame), even though they are not directly related.

The villages proximity allowed residents of the Chen Village to intermarry or move to Zhaobao, so there has been an influence from Chen tai chi for centuries. Several Zhaobao lineages trace their roots to Jiang Fa (1574–1655), who lived with Chen Wangting. They claim that Jiang Fa moved to Zhaobao Village and taught tai chi there for a number of years.

Several other notable Chen Family members also lived in Zhaobao. The best documented was Chen Qingping, who moved and taught there. Some Zhaobao lineages include Chen Qingping. So, Zhaobao tai chi shares many stylistic similarities with Chen-style tai chi, particularly Xiaojia, because it was influenced by Chen Family stylists. His disciples, such as He Zhaoyuan and Wu Yuxiang, promoted this unique style.

Zhaobao tai chi is village style rather than one of the tai chi &quot;family&quot; styles, and it does not originate through the teaching interaction of Chen Changxing with Yang Luchan as do other styles of tai chi. Despite the similarities in appearance to Chen tai chi, this style has its own theory, philosophy, and long history. It is truly a different &quot;style&quot; of tai chi. Some consider it to be a distinct and separate traditional Chinese martial art altogether.

=== Modern Chen forms ===

Similar to other family styles of tai chi, Chen-style has had its frame adapted by competitors to fit within the framework of wushu competition. A prominent example is the 56 Chen Competition form (Developed by professor Kan Gui Xiang of the Beijing Institute of Sport under the auspice of the Chinese National Wushu Association. It is composed based on the lao jia routines (classical sets), and to a much lesser extent the 48/42 Combined Competition form (1976/1989 by the Chinese Sports Committee developed from Chen and three other traditional styles).

In the last ten years or so even respected grandmasters of traditional styles have begun to accommodate this contemporary trend towards shortened forms that take less time to learn and perform. Beginners in large cities do not always have the time, space or the concentration needed to immediately start learning old frame (75 movements). This proves all the more true at workshops given by visiting grandmasters. Consequently, shortened versions of the traditional forms have been developed even by the &quot;Four Buddha’s warriors&quot;. Beginners can choose from postures of 38 (synthesized from both lao and xin jia by Chen Xiaowang), 19 (1995 Chen Xiaowang), 18 (Chen Zhenglei) and 13 (1997 Zhu Tiancai). There is even a 4-step routine (repeated 4 times in a circular progression, returning to start) useful for confined spaces (Zhu Tiancai).

In a sense, shorter and well composed sets of forms are modernizing tai chi to suit modern needs and lifestyle. As well as that some composers incorporated up to day medical knowledge to improve tai chi&#x27;s efficacy for health and wellness.

== Weapon forms ==
Chen Tai Chi has several unique weapon forms.
* the 49 posture Straight Sword (&quot;Jian&quot;) form
* the 13 posture Broadsword (&quot;Dao&quot;) form
* Spear (&quot;Qiang&quot;) solo and partner forms
* 3, 8, and 13 posture &quot;Gun&quot; forms
* 30 posture Halberd (Da Dao/&quot;Guandao&quot;) form
* several double weapons forms utilizing the above-mentioned items

== Additional training ==
Before teaching the forms, the instructor may have the students do stance training such as &quot;zhan zhuang&quot; and various &quot;qigong&quot; routines such as silk reeling exercises.

Other methods of training for Chen-style using training aids including pole/spear shaking exercises, which teach a practitioner how to extend their silk reeling and &quot;fa jing&quot; skill into a weapon.

In addition to the solo exercises listed above, there are partner exercises known as pushing hands, designed to help students maintain the correct body structure when faced with resistance. There are five methods of push hands that students learn before they can move on to a more free-style push hands structure, which begins to resemble sparring.

==Martial application==

The vast majority of Chen stylists believe that tai chi is first and foremost a martial art; that a study of the self-defense aspect of tai chi is the best test of a student&#x27;s skill and knowledge of the tai chi principles that provide health benefit. In compliance with this principle, all Chen forms retain some degree of overt &quot;fa jing&quot; expression.

In martial application, Chen-style tai chi uses a wide variety of techniques applied with all the extremities that revolve around the use of the eight gates of tai chi to manifest either &quot;kai&quot; (expansive power) or &quot;he&quot; (contracting power) through the physical postures of Chen forms. The particulars of exterior technique may vary between teachers and forms. In common with all neijia, Chen-style aims to develop internal power for the execution of martial techniques, but in contrast to some tai chi styles and teachers includes the cultivation of fa jing skill. Chen family member Chen Zhenglei has commented that between the new and old frame traditions there are 105 basic fajin methods and 72 basic Qinna methods present in the forms.

<text>William Ellam Allen (1880–1960) was an acting director of the U.S. Bureau of Investigation (BOI) during 1919. The BOI was a predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

A former assistant in war matters to the chief of the Bureau of Investigation, Allen was appointed acting director on February 10, 1919. Allen resigned the post from June 30, 1919, and was replaced by William J. Flynn.

<text>William James Flynn (November 18, 1867 – October 14, 1928) was the third director of the Bureau of Investigation from July 1, 1919, to August 21, 1921.

==Early life and education==
Flynn was born in New York City and began his government career in 1897, after receiving a public school education.

==Early career==
Flynn began his career as a Manhattan plumber. His first law enforcement job was as an agent in the United States Secret Service. He spent many years combating counterfeiting, which led to his investigation and arrests of Black Hand extortionists and members of the American mafia, many of them associated with the Morello crime family.

Flynn collaborated with New York Police Department Detective Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Petrosino, who was murdered in 1909 in Palermo, Sicily, where he was tracing the backgrounds of the gangsters plaguing New York City. Petrosino&#x27;s murder was never officially solved, but the author and historian Mike Dash implicates the likely gunman and his accomplice and says there is little doubt that Giuseppe Morello was behind it. Flynn and his operatives built the case that culminated in the 1910 convictions of Morello and his associates and their imprisonment in Atlanta Federal Prison.

Flynn gained recognition in 1911, when he successfully reorganized the New York City detective force. He later returned to the Secret Service as Chief (1912–1917). During World War I he investigated threats of sabotage. In 1915 he investigated espionage involving a German-owned wireless station on the coast of Long Island in Sayville, New York. It was suspected of sending communications related to the war which were prohibited. He enlisted an amateur radio operator named Charles E. Apgar who recorded the transmissions. These recordings provided evidence that led to the facility being seized by the United States government to stop the activity.

==BOI career==

In 1919, Flynn was named director of the Bureau of Investigation. Attorney General Palmer praised his new appointee as &quot;the leading, organizing detective of America...Flynn is an anarchist chaser...the greatest anarchist expert in the United States.&quot; In one of Flynn&#x27;s high-profile incidents, one of his operatives who was trailing the German diplomat Dr. Heinrich Albert on a streetcar, snatched Albert&#x27;s briefcase, which contained sensitive documents. The papers documented Albert&#x27;s having spent $27 million to build up a spy network in the United States, using German money to fund dock strikes, attacks on shipping, and bombs planted in munitions plants.

===Resignation===
Flynn&#x27;s hard-line approach to counterespionage and his scaremongering public statements meant to rouse the US to the threat of German espionage angered the German and Irish communities, and eroded Flynn&#x27;s support in Washington, ending in his resignation.

After resigning, Flynn &quot;accepted a sinecure as head of the Federal Railway Administration Police&quot;.

===Reinstatement and replacement===
Two years after leaving the Secret Service, in the wake of concerted terrorist action, including a bomb that &quot;shook the home of A. Mitchell Palmer, the attorney general of the United States, virtually demolishing it&quot;, Palmer &quot;dedicated his Department of Justice to tracking down the men responsible&quot;. He appointed Flynn director of the Bureau of Investigation. Flynn took charge of hunting down the bombers and assigned &quot;an ambitious Justice Department clerk by the name of J. Edgar Hoover&quot; to monitor suspected radicals.

Through painstaking work, Flynn&#x27;s team identified the likely suspects. However, they were unable to obtain the type of evidence that would stand up in court. Public opinion turned against the bureau, as the public wanted arrests, and Hoover launched a series of &quot;Palmer Raids&quot; that became a public relations nightmare. These events resulted in low morale among Flynn&#x27;s staff, and the new Harding Administration replaced Flynn with William J. Burns.

===Semi-retirement===

After his forced retirement, Flynn went into business for himself. He founded a New York detective agency with his daughter Veronica and son Elmer as partners, which generated some income. However, according to Dash, the partnership was unsuccessful and contributed to the business&#x27;s ultimate demise: Veronica and Elmer &quot;were running the detective business into the ground. Both heavy drinkers, they overspent and upset clients. The pair&#x27;s increasingly erratic behavior distressed their more abstemious father, and the worry weakened him.&quot;

Flynn earned the bulk of his income, at that point, from writing. He had occasionally contributed articles, typically about his greatest cases, to such journals as &quot;The New York Herald&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; since 1911. After retiring, he worked briefly as a crime novelist. Flynn also became a scenario writer for the motion picture industry through his acquaintance with the actor King Baggot who, Dash notes, was considered the greatest film star in the country at that time in 1912. The producers Theodore and Leopold Wharton commissioned him to write story lines for their films, including &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;, and eventually adapted Flynn&#x27;s experiences into a 20-part spy thriller titled &quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1918), starring Baggot. The same year they were also published as weekly installments in &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;&#x27;s magazine section under the title &quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Eye: True Story of the Imperial German Government&#x27;s Spies and Intrigues in America&quot;. Some of these episodes were published in a book with the same name in 1919.

He also edited a magazine which bore his name, &quot;Flynn&#x27;s Weekly Detective Fiction&quot;, and became the longest-running, most successful journal of its genre. After Flynn&#x27;s death, the periodical was temporarily renamed &quot;Detective Fiction Weekly (formerly Flynn&#x27;s)&quot; before resuming its original title; the periodical published a total of 703 issues.

==Death==
Flynn died at age 60 of heart disease in October 1928, in Larchmont, New York. He is buried in a family plot in Valhalla, New York.

<text>Guys and Balls (German: Männer wie wir, literally &quot;Men like us&quot;, UK title: Balls) is a 2004 German sports comedy/romance film by German American director Sherry Hormann about a gay goalkeeper who assembles a gay-only soccer team to play against his ex-team, which fired him due to homophobia.

==Plot==
Ecki (Maximilian Brückner) lives with his parents who own a bakery in Boldrup, a (fictitious) small German town near Dortmund. Football, the German national pastime, is particularly popular in this heavily industrialized region and Ecki has been an avid and successful player in a local club FC Boldrup, since his childhood days.

In a decisive game, he fails to keep a ball at a penalty and the team fails to get the promotion to the district league. The team are devastated and get drunk at a party. Ecki is then evicted from the team, with his mistake being used to cover the real reason—the revelation that he is gay that comes about when he is observed by some of his teammates kissing another player Tobias on the mouth.

Ecki is defiant and immediately sets out to form his own team and beat his ex-teammates at their game. So he sets off for Dortmund to find members for his new team with the help of his sister Susanne, who is living there. From the fans of his favorite club Borussia Dortmund he finds confusion, but he gradually succeeds in others places, such as a kebab shop and the leather bar &#x27;Steel Tube&#x27; to recruit more homosexual players for his team. Among the greatest hopes are the two Brazilians Ronaldo and Ronaldinho and the actually hidden heterosexual bookseller Klaus.

Meanwhile, he also manages to win the heart of dreamboy Sven (David Rott), who becomes his first boyfriend. Training of the team is done by Karl (Rolf Zacher), an ex-soccer player himself who quit the sport years ago after a stinging defeat.

When the big day of the game comes, the match starts out badly for Ecki&#x27;s team, but ultimately they are able to triumph over his old teammates by allowing their homophobia to turn against themselves.

==Reaction==
&quot;Männer wie wir&quot; may be regarded as the first major German sports comedy. While this genre is far more established in the United States with movies such as &quot;Hardball&quot; (2001) or &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1992) in which an underdog team is posed to somehow find the spirit to win an important game against a far superior opponent, these kinds of movies are relatively rare in German cinema. It may therefore not be surprising that this particular movie was made by an American-born director.

===Critical reception===

Joshua Katzman of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called the film &quot;engaging&quot; and &quot;well-paced&quot; with &quot;a vibrantly funny script&quot;. Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; states that the film is &quot;by-the-numbers ensemble dramedy that hits every underdog and gay-fish-out-of-water cliche on the nose&quot;. Jeanette Catsoulis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the &quot;script groans with double-entendres&quot; and it contains &quot;lots of cheerful nudity, loving threesomes and more synonyms for &quot;gay&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="1050542" wikidata="Q2579424" url="?curid=1050542" title="William J. Burns">
<text>William John Burns (October 19, 1861 – April 14, 1932) was an American private investigator and law enforcement official. He was known as &quot;America&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes&quot; and earned fame for having conducted private investigations into a number of notable incidents, such as clearing Leo Frank of the 1913 murder of Mary Phagan, and for investigating the deadly 1910 Los Angeles Times bombing conducted by members of the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers. From August 22, 1921, to May 10, 1924, Burns served as the fourth director of the Bureau of Investigation (BOI), predecessor to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 

He was born in Baltimore and educated in Columbus. As a young man, Burns performed well as a United States Secret Service Agent and parleyed his reputation into the William J. Burns International Detective Agency, now a part of Securitas Security Services USA. A combination of natural ability as a detective combined with an instinct for publicity made Burns a national figure. His exploits made national news, the gossip columns of New York City newspapers, and the pages of detective magazines, in which he published true crime stories based on his exploits.

==Marriage and children==
Burns married Annie M. Ressler in 1880. The couple had six children. Burns&#x27;s sons, Raymond J. and William Sherman, also worked as detectives for the William J. Burns National Detective Agency.

==&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; bombing==
The City of Los Angeles hired Burns to catch those responsible for the bombing of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; building on October 1, 1910, which killed 20 people. Revenge or anger was the suspected motive as &quot;Times&quot; publisher Harrison Gray Otis was a staunch opponent of labor unions, and the incident was similar to a nationwide series of dozens of earlier but not-fatal bomb attacks that Burns had been investigating for the National Erector Association. 

After months of investigation, Burns&#x27;s son Raymond and police officers from the Detroit and Chicago police departments arrested Jim McNamara and associate Ortie McManigal on April 14, 1911, in Detroit. Ironworkers Union secretary-treasurer John McNamara, Jim&#x27;s brother, was arrested later that month in Indianapolis, Indiana. Extradited to Los Angeles, the brothers pleaded guilty to murder in the bombing. The MacNamara brothers were important members of the Ironworkers Union and the investigation implicated numerous other members of the union up to President Frank M. Ryan. Burns&#x27;s investigation found the Ironworkers Union leadership knew and approved of over 100 bombings between 1905 and 1910, perhaps the largest domestic terrorism campaign in American history.

==BOI career==
Burns was considered well qualified to direct the Bureau of Investigation, and was friends with President Warren Harding&#x27;s Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty. Burns was confirmed as Director of the Bureau of Investigation on August 22, 1921. He continued to run the Burns Detective Agency throughout his tenure as Director of the BOI. Under Burns, the Bureau shrank from its 1920 high of 1,127 personnel to 600 employees in 1923. Burns was responsible for hiring the first female special agents, Alaska P. Davidson in 1922 and Jessie B. Duckstein in 1923.

At the request of Attorney General Daugherty, Burns sent agents to investigate Montana Sen. Thomas J. Walsh for evidence of criminal wrongdoing. The investigation was actually a pretext for retaliation; the congressman had been instrumental in opposing oil leases granted by Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall, a friend of Daugherty and fellow cabinet member. Burns later refused to turn over Department of Justice documents to Congressional investigators, who in turn began investigating the BOI; Senate hearing revelations of BOI misdeeds were avidly covered in the press, and became known as the Daugherty-Burns scandal. Burns&#x27;s BOI field agents made visits to the offices of newspapers around the country who had presented the BOI&#x27;s actions in a negative light; their clumsy attempts to intimidate newspaper editors caused a backlash in public opinion and Congress. Burns was forced to resign in 1924 at the request of Attorney General Harlan Fiske Stone and on May 10, 1924, J. Edgar Hoover took over the position on a provisional basis.

==Burns Detective Agency and Teapot Dome==

In October 1924, the CPUSA&#x27;s &quot;Daily Worker&quot; newspaper reported that Jacob Spolansky, recently resigned from the BOI, had joined the Burns Detective Agency, run by &quot;Bill&quot; Burns, &quot;King of Dicks.&quot;

Burns also became indirectly involved in the Teapot Dome Scandal, involving the secret leasing of naval oil reserve lands to private companies. In November 1927, Harry F. Sinclair went on trial in federal court for conspiracy to defraud the US in the leasing of the Teapot Dome naval oil reserve. At the request of Sinclair oil executive Henry Mason Day, Burns secretly hired a squad of 14 men from the William J. Burns Detective Agency to &quot;investigate&quot; his jurors. Day arranged for their compensation and received their daily reports. Midway through the trial the government&#x27;s investigators discovered Burns&#x27;s agents, and a mistrial was immediately declared.

At a new hearing, Sinclair&#x27;s defense was that he had had the jurors followed to protect them against federal influences and that in no case had the operatives made direct contact with the jurors. Sinclair was convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to six months in jail, Day to four months&#x27; imprisonment, William J. Burns to 15 days&#x27; imprisonment, and Burns&#x27;s son, William Sherman Burns, was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine. The father immediately appealed, and the Supreme Court later reversed his conviction (&quot;Sinclair v. United States&quot;, 279 US 749 – Supreme Court 1929).

==Later life and death==
After his retirement from the Burns Detective Agency, Burns moved to Florida and for several years published detective and mystery stories based on his long career. He died of a heart attack in Sarasota, Florida, in April 1932.

Burns was portrayed by actor Paul Dooley in the television miniseries &quot;The Murder of Mary Phagan&quot;. A fictionalized version of Burns was played by Gary Basaraba in the film &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot;; this character was an amalgamation of Burns and other private investigators that were hired to look into the Osage Indian murders.

<doc id="1050544" wikidata="Q629703" url="?curid=1050544" title="Sharp PC-1211">
<text>The Sharp PC-1211 is the first pocket computer ever released, marketed by Sharp Corporation in March 1980. The computer was powered by two 4-bit CPUs laid out in power-saving CMOS circuitry. One acted as the main CPU, the other dealt with the input/output and display interface. Users could write computer programs in BASIC.

A badge-engineered version of the PC-1211, the TRS-80 Pocket Computer (model PC-1), was marketed by Radio Shack in July 1980 as the first iteration of the TRS-80 Pocket Computer with just a marginally different look (outer plastic parts in black, not brown, gray display frame)

==Technical specifications==
*24 digit dot matrix LCD
*Full QWERTY-style keyboard
*Integrated beeper
*Connector for printer and tape drive
*Programmable in BASIC
*Uses four MR44 Mercury button cells
*Battery life in excess of 200 hours
*1424 program steps, 26 permanent variable locations (- or -) and 178 variables shared with program steps
*Built out of off-the-shelf CMOS components, including SC43177/SC43178 processors at and three TC5514P RAM modules

===Accessories===
*CE-121 Cassette Interface
*CE-122 Printer

==TRS-80 Pocket Computer (&quot;PC-1&quot;)==
A badge-engineered version of the Sharp PC-1211 was marketed by Radio Shack as the original TRS-80 Pocket Computer. This was later referred to as the &quot;PC-1&quot; to differentiate it from subsequent entries (PC-2 onwards) in the TRS-80 Pocket Computer line.

Introduced in July 1980, the &quot;PC-1&quot; measured 175 × 70 × 15 mm and weighed 170 g, and had a one-line, 24-character alphanumeric LCD.

The TRS-80 Pocket Computer was programmable in BASIC, with a capacity of 1424 &quot;program steps&quot;. This memory was shared with variable storage of up to 178 locations, in addition to the 26 fixed locations named A through Z. The implementation was based on Palo Alto Tiny BASIC.

Programs and data could be stored on a Compact Cassette through an optional external cassette tape interface unit. A printer/cassette interface was available, which used an ink ribbon on plain paper.

<text>Castor is a town in Alberta, Canada. It is located at the intersection of Highway 12 and Highway 861, approximately east of the City of Red Deer. It has an elevation .

&quot;Castor&quot; is French (also Latin) for beaver. The town is known for its duck and geese migration in the fall since its territory includes many stopping points well frequented by migrating waterfowl.

== History ==

The area was settled after the turn of the century, and Castor was incorporated on July 13, 1910.

== Demographics ==

Castor&#x27;s tourism peaks during the summer months. Each year Castor&#x27;s lake-like creek that wraps around the north-east end of the town, is a large drawing point for visitors. This one of a kind creek is framed by sandstone cliffs, and a visit will usually be filled with numerous wildlife sightings. The creek is one of the best places on the Alberta prairies for Kayaking and paddle-boarding. Other creek activities include motor-boating and swimming. On dry years natural beaches form at the base of some of the cliffs, giving visitors opportunities to dock their kayaks, during parts of creek. In addition to the creek, the town hosts many museums, including the towns original hospital dating back to 1911, the Machine Shed Museum, the Pharmacy Museum housed in the towns original drug store, the Beaver School Museum, the historic All Saints Anglican Church, the Grain Elevator Historical Site, and the Train Station Museum.

<text>Wonka (formerly Nestlé Candy Shop and The Willy Wonka Candy Company) was a confectionery brand owned and licensed by the Swiss corporation Nestlé. In 2018, the branding and production rights were sold to the Ferrero Group.

==History==
===Origins===
The previous inception of the Wonka brand came from materials licensed from the British author Roald Dahl. His classic 1964 children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, and its film adaptations are the sources of both the packaging and the marketing styles of the Wonka brand. Dahl had licensed the &quot;Wonka&quot; name to film director Mel Stuart. The film&#x27;s producer, David L. Wolper, convinced the Quaker Oats Company to advance $3 million to finance the film in exchange for the right to use the Wonka name to sell candy bars. Quaker, which had no previous experience in the film industry, bought the rights to the book and financed the picture to promote their new &quot;Wonka Bar&quot;. The title of the film was changed to &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; for promotional purposes.

The brand was launched on 17 May 1971, one month before the release of the novel&#x27;s first film adaptation on 30 June 1971. In 1975, Breaker Confections was acquired by Sunmark Corporation of Saint Louis, Missouri, US. In 1980, the Breaker Confections brand name was changed to &quot;Willy Wonka Brands&quot; in an attempt to develop the &quot;Wonka&quot; brand image. The company was sold in 1986 to Rowntree Mackintosh Confectionery of the UK, who were then acquired in 1988 by Swiss company Nestlé. In 1993, Nestlé renamed it the &quot;Willy Wonka Candy Company&quot;, and then &quot;Nestlé Candy Shop&quot; in 2015. The original &quot;Wonka Bars&quot; never saw store shelves due to factory production problems before the film&#x27;s release; however, subsequent Wonka product releases were highly successful, including the Everlasting Gobstopper in 1976 and Nerds in 1983.

From 1988 to 2017, Nestlé sold sweets and chocolate under the Wonka brand name in numerous countries. The cessation of the Wonka brand was due to the impending sale of branding rights to the Ferrero Group.

To promote the 2023 film &quot;Wonka&quot;, Ferrero revived the Wonka brand name for promotional &quot;Magic Hat Gummies&quot;.

==Acquisition by Ferrero==
On 18 January 2018, Ferrero announced that it would be purchasing the Nestlé US candy business and all of its US products, office locations, and manufacturing plants. The deal gave Nestlé a value of approximately $US2.8 billion.

<doc id="1050549" wikidata="Q127289" url="?curid=1050549" title="Volcano Entertainment">
<text>Volcano Entertainment (sometimes referred to as Volcano Records) is an American all-round music record label founded in 1996 which released albums by Tool, 311, Survivor and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. (The latter two were former Scotti Bros. Records artists and the only artists retained from that label.) The Volcano Records catalog is owned by RCA Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment.

==History==
Volcano Records was founded in 1996 by Kevin Czinger. It is essentially the continuation of Zoo Entertainment which Czinger bought from BMG in 1996. Initially, the company was meant to have two divisions &quot;Zoo/Volcano&quot; and &quot;Volcano&quot; which would be a hip-hop imprint. The first album released with the new ownership was Tool&#x27;s album &quot;Ænima&quot; followed by actor Keanu Reeves&#x27; band Dogstar&#x27;s album &quot;Our Little Visionary&quot;. However, the Zoo name was eventually phased out and many of Zoo artists became the cornerstone of the Volcano roster.

In October 1997, Volcano merged with Dallas Austin&#x27;s Rowdy Records to become Freeworld Entertainment. Freeworld was short-lived, as the label was plagued with financial trouble and the relationship with Austin faltered. Many of the label&#x27;s employees were either cut or left. Additionally, the label&#x27;s flagship artist Tool was attempting to leave the label which resulted in a lengthy lawsuit.

In the spring of 1998, Freeworld was purchased and &quot;saved&quot; by the Zomba Label Group. Though the Zoo branding was briefly reintroduced, Zomba quickly returned the Volcano moniker, abandoning Zoo altogether. A month later, Q Prime, led by top managers Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch, purchased a 50% stake in Volcano and made sure that hard-rock artist Tool would stay. They would sell their share back to Zomba in the early 2000s.

1998 also marked the year that Volcano acquired the contracts and masters of Scotti Bros. Records which had just been purchased by Pearson PLC. Volcano also purchased Capricorn Records in December 2000.

In 2002, Zomba was purchased by BMG, returning Volcano to the BMG umbrella it had previously been a part of as Zoo Entertainment in the early nineties. Volcano now controls the Scotti Bros. Records, Capricorn Records (later) and Zoo Entertainment catalogs.

With Yankovic fulfilling his Sony contract on their main label RCA, with his 2014 album &quot;Mandatory Fun&quot;, Volcano functions primarily as a reissue label. Tool released its contract fulfillment album for Volcano, &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot;, on August 30, 2019, through Tool Dissectional/Volcano/RCA, completing their five-album requirement.

==Artists==
==Releases==

Volcano products were initially distributed by BMG. When Zomba purchased the label in 1998, distribution was handled through the Zomba network which, depending on the territory, may have been BMG, Virgin, Zomba itself or other smaller labels. When Zomba was purchased by BMG, BMG became the sole worldwide distributor again. Between 2004 and late 2008 distribution switched to Sony BMG in accordance with the merger of Sony and BMG. Since early 2009, Sony Music Entertainment distributes Volcano products worldwide.

<doc id="1050551" wikidata="Q1895805" url="?curid=1050551" title="Multiple-criteria decision analysis">
<text>Multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) or multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a sub-discipline of operations research that explicitly evaluates multiple conflicting in decision making (both in daily life and in settings such as business, government and medicine). It is also known as multiple attribute utility theory, multiple attribute value theory, multiple attribute preference theory, and multi-objective decision analysis.

Conflicting criteria are typical in evaluating options: cost or price is usually one of the main criteria, and some measure of quality is typically another criterion, easily in conflict with the cost. In purchasing a car, cost, comfort, safety, and fuel economy may be some of the main criteria we consider – it is unusual that the cheapest car is the most comfortable and the safest one. In portfolio management, managers are interested in getting high returns while simultaneously reducing risks; however, the stocks that have the potential of bringing high returns typically carry high risk of losing money. In a service industry, customer satisfaction and the cost of providing service are fundamental conflicting criteria.

In their daily lives, people usually weigh multiple criteria implicitly and may be comfortable with the consequences of such decisions that are made based on only intuition. On the other hand, when stakes are high, it is important to properly structure the problem and explicitly evaluate multiple criteria. In making the decision of whether to build a nuclear power plant or not, and where to build it, there are not only very complex issues involving multiple criteria, but there are also multiple parties who are deeply affected by the consequences.

Structuring complex problems well and considering multiple criteria explicitly leads to more informed and better decisions. There have been important advances in this field since the start of the modern multiple-criteria decision-making discipline in the early 1960s. A variety of approaches and methods, many implemented by specialized decision-making software, have been developed for their application in an array of disciplines, ranging from politics and business to the environment and energy.

==Foundations, concepts, definitions==

MCDM or MCDA are acronyms for &quot;multiple-criteria decision-making&quot; and &quot;multiple-criteria decision analysis&quot;. Stanley Zionts helped popularizing the acronym with his 1979 article &quot;MCDM – If not a Roman Numeral, then What?&quot;, intended for an entrepreneurial audience.

MCDM is concerned with structuring and solving decision and planning problems involving multiple criteria. The purpose is to support decision-makers facing such problems. Typically, there does not exist a unique optimal solution for such problems and it is necessary to use decision-makers&#x27; preferences to differentiate between solutions.

&quot;Solving&quot; can be interpreted in different ways. It could correspond to choosing the &quot;best&quot; alternative from a set of available alternatives (where &quot;best&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;the most preferred alternative&quot; of a decision-maker). Another interpretation of &quot;solving&quot; could be choosing a small set of good alternatives, or grouping alternatives into different preference sets. An extreme interpretation could be to find all &quot;efficient&quot; or &quot;nondominated&quot; alternatives (which we will define shortly).
The difficulty of the problem originates from the presence of more than one criterion. There is no longer a unique optimal solution to an MCDM problem that can be obtained without incorporating preference information. The concept of an optimal solution is often replaced by the set of nondominated solutions. A solution is called nondominated if it is not possible to improve it in any criterion without sacrificing it in another. Therefore, it makes sense for the decision-maker to choose a solution from the nondominated set. Otherwise, they could do better in terms of some or all of the criteria, and not do worse in any of them. Generally, however, the set of nondominated solutions is too large to be presented to the decision-maker for the final choice. Hence we need tools that help the decision-maker focus on the preferred solutions (or alternatives). Normally one has to &quot;tradeoff&quot; certain criteria for others.

MCDM has been an active area of research since the 1970s. There are several MCDM-related organizations including the International Society on Multi-criteria Decision Making, Euro Working Group on MCDA, and INFORMS Section on MCDM. For a history see: Köksalan, Wallenius and Zionts (2011).
MCDM draws upon knowledge in many fields including:

* Mathematics
* Decision analysis
* Economics
* Computer technology
* Software engineering
* Information systems

===A typology===

There are different classifications of MCDM problems and methods. A major distinction between MCDM problems is based on whether the solutions are explicitly or implicitly defined.

* &quot;Multiple-criteria evaluation problems&quot;: These problems consist of a finite number of alternatives, explicitly known in the beginning of the solution process. Each alternative is represented by its performance in multiple criteria. The problem may be defined as finding the best alternative for a decision-maker (DM), or finding a set of good alternatives. One may also be interested in &quot;sorting&quot; or &quot;classifying&quot; alternatives. Sorting refers to placing alternatives in a set of preference-ordered classes (such as assigning credit-ratings to countries), and classifying refers to assigning alternatives to non-ordered sets (such as diagnosing patients based on their symptoms). Some of the MCDM methods in this category have been studied in a comparative manner in the book by Triantaphyllou on this subject, 2000.
* &quot;Multiple-criteria design problems (multiple objective mathematical programming problems)&quot;: In these problems, the alternatives are not explicitly known. An alternative (solution) can be found by solving a mathematical model. The number of alternatives is either finite or infinite (countable or not countable), but typically exponentially large (in the number of variables ranging over finite domains.)

Whether it is an evaluation problem or a design problem, preference information of DMs is required in order to differentiate between solutions. The solution methods for MCDM problems are commonly classified based on the timing of preference information obtained from the DM.

There are methods that require the DM&#x27;s preference information at the start of the process, transforming the problem into essentially a single criterion problem. These methods are said to operate by &quot;prior articulation of preferences&quot;. Methods based on estimating a value function or using the concept of &quot;outranking relations&quot;, analytical hierarchy process, and some rule-based decision methods try to solve multiple criteria evaluation problems utilizing prior articulation of preferences. Similarly, there are methods developed to solve multiple-criteria design problems using prior articulation of preferences by constructing a value function. Perhaps the most well-known of these methods is goal programming. Once the value function is constructed, the resulting single objective mathematical program is solved to obtain a preferred solution.

Some methods require preference information from the DM throughout the solution process. These are referred to as interactive methods or methods that require &quot;progressive articulation of preferences&quot;. These methods have been well-developed for both the multiple criteria evaluation (see for example, Geoffrion, Dyer and Feinberg, 1972, and Köksalan and Sagala, 1995 ) and design problems (see Steuer, 1986).

Multiple-criteria design problems typically require the solution of a series of mathematical programming models in order to reveal implicitly defined solutions. For these problems, a representation or approximation of &quot;efficient solutions&quot; may also be of interest. This category is referred to as &quot;posterior articulation of preferences&quot;, implying that the DM&#x27;s involvement starts posterior to the explicit revelation of &quot;interesting&quot; solutions (see for example Karasakal and Köksalan, 2009).

When the mathematical programming models contain integer variables, the design problems become harder to solve. Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) constitutes a special category of such problems posing substantial computational difficulty (see Ehrgott and Gandibleux, 2002, for a review).

===Representations and definitions===

The MCDM problem can be represented in the criterion space or the decision space. Alternatively, if different criteria are combined by a weighted linear function, it is also possible to represent the problem in the weight space. Below are the demonstrations of the criterion and weight spaces as well as some formal definitions.

====Criterion space representation====

Let us assume that we evaluate solutions in a specific problem situation using several criteria. Let us further assume that more is better in each criterion. Then, among all possible solutions, we are ideally interested in those solutions that perform well in all considered criteria. However, it is unlikely to have a single solution that performs well in all considered criteria. Typically, some solutions perform well in some criteria and some perform well in others. Finding a way of trading off between criteria is one of the main endeavors in the MCDM literature.

Mathematically, the MCDM problem corresponding to the above arguments can be represented as

:: subject to

where is the vector of &quot;k&quot; criterion functions (objective functions) and is the feasible set, .

If is defined explicitly (by a set of alternatives), the resulting problem is called a multiple-criteria evaluation problem.

If is defined implicitly (by a set of constraints), the resulting problem is called a multiple-criteria design problem.

The quotation marks are used to indicate that the maximization of a vector is not a well-defined mathematical operation. This corresponds to the argument that we will have to find a way to resolve the trade-off between criteria (typically based on the preferences of a decision maker) when a solution that performs well in all criteria does not exist.

====Decision space representation====

The decision space corresponds to the set of possible decisions that are available to us. The criteria values will be consequences of the decisions we make. Hence, we can define a corresponding problem in the decision space. For example, in designing a product, we decide on the design parameters (decision variables) each of which affects the performance measures (criteria) with which we evaluate our product.

Mathematically, a multiple-criteria design problem can be represented in the decision space as follows:

: formula_1

where is the feasible set and is the decision variable vector of size n.

A well-developed special case is obtained when is a polyhedron defined by linear inequalities and equalities. If all the objective functions are linear in terms of the decision variables, this variation leads to multiple objective linear programming (MOLP), an important subclass of MCDM problems.

There are several definitions that are central in MCDM. Two closely related definitions are those of nondominance (defined based on the criterion space representation) and efficiency (defined based on the decision variable representation).

&quot;Definition 1.&quot; is nondominated if there does not exist another such that and .

Roughly speaking, a solution is nondominated so long as it is not inferior to any other available solution in all the considered criteria.

&quot;Definition 2.&quot; is efficient if there does not exist another such that and .

If an MCDM problem represents a decision situation well, then the most preferred solution of a DM has to be an efficient solution in the decision space, and its image is a nondominated point in the criterion space. Following definitions are also important.

&quot;Definition 3.&quot; is weakly nondominated if there does not exist another such that .

&quot;Definition 4.&quot; is weakly efficient if there does not exist another such that .

Weakly nondominated points include all nondominated points and some special dominated points. The importance of these special dominated points comes from the fact that they commonly appear in practice and special care is necessary to distinguish them from nondominated points. If, for example, we maximize a single objective, we may end up with a weakly nondominated point that is dominated. The dominated points of the weakly nondominated set are located either on vertical or horizontal planes (hyperplanes) in the criterion space.

&quot;Ideal point&quot;: (in criterion space) represents the best (the maximum for maximization problems and the minimum for minimization problems) of each objective function and typically corresponds to an infeasible solution.

&quot;Nadir point&quot;: (in criterion space) represents the worst (the minimum for maximization problems and the maximum for minimization problems) of each objective function among the points in the nondominated set and is typically a dominated point.

The ideal point and the nadir point are useful to the DM to get the &quot;feel&quot; of the range of solutions (although it is not straightforward to find the nadir point for design problems having more than two criteria).

====Illustrations of the decision and criterion spaces====

The following two-variable MOLP problem in the decision variable space will help demonstrate some of the key concepts graphically.

: formula_2
In Figure 1, the extreme points &quot;e&quot; and &quot;b&quot; maximize the first and second objectives, respectively. The red boundary between those two extreme points represents the efficient set. It can be seen from the figure that, for any feasible solution outside the efficient set, it is possible to improve both objectives by some points on the efficient set. Conversely, for any point on the efficient set, it is not possible to improve both objectives by moving to any other feasible solution. At these solutions, one has to sacrifice from one of the objectives in order to improve the other objective.

Due to its simplicity, the above problem can be represented in criterion space by replacing the with the as follows:



:: subject to







We present the criterion space graphically in Figure 2. It is easier to detect the nondominated points (corresponding to efficient solutions in the decision space) in the criterion space. The north-east region of the feasible space constitutes the set of nondominated points (for maximization problems).

===Generating nondominated solutions===

There are several ways to generate nondominated solutions. We will discuss two of these. The first approach can generate a special class of nondominated solutions whereas the second approach can generate any nondominated solution.

* &quot;Weighted sums&quot; (Gass &amp; Saaty, 1955)

If we combine the multiple criteria into a single criterion by multiplying each criterion with a positive weight and summing up the weighted criteria, then the solution to the resulting single criterion problem is a special efficient solution. These special efficient solutions appear at corner points of the set of available solutions. Efficient solutions that are not at corner points have special characteristics and this method is not capable of finding such points. Mathematically, we can represent this situation as

:: subject to

By varying the weights, weighted sums can be used for generating efficient extreme point solutions for design problems, and supported (convex nondominated) points for evaluation problems.

* &quot;Achievement scalarizing function&quot; (Wierzbicki, 1980)

Achievement scalarizing functions also combine multiple criteria into a single criterion by weighting them in a very special way. They create rectangular contours going away from a reference point towards the available efficient solutions. This special structure empower achievement scalarizing functions to reach any efficient solution. This is a powerful property that makes these functions very useful for MCDM problems.

Mathematically, we can represent the corresponding problem as

::subject to

The achievement scalarizing function can be used to project any point (feasible or infeasible) on the efficient frontier. Any point (supported or not) can be reached. The second term in the objective function is required to avoid generating inefficient solutions. Figure 3 demonstrates how a feasible point, , and an infeasible point, , are projected onto the nondominated points, and , respectively, along the direction using an achievement scalarizing function. The dashed and solid contours correspond to the objective function contours with and without the second term of the objective function, respectively.

===Solving MCDM problems===

Different schools of thought have developed for solving MCDM problems (both of the design and evaluation type). For a bibliometric study showing their development over time, see Bragge, Korhonen, H. Wallenius and J. Wallenius [2010].

Multiple objective mathematical programming school

(1) &quot;Vector maximization&quot;: The purpose of vector maximization is to approximate the nondominated set; originally developed for Multiple Objective Linear Programming problems (Evans and Steuer, 1973; Yu and Zeleny, 1975).

(2) &quot;Interactive programming&quot;: Phases of computation alternate with phases of decision-making (Benayoun et al., 1971; Geoffrion, Dyer and Feinberg, 1972; Zionts and Wallenius, 1976; Korhonen and Wallenius, 1988). No explicit knowledge of the DM&#x27;s value function is assumed.

Goal programming school

The purpose is to set apriori target values for goals, and to minimize weighted deviations from these goals. Both importance weights as well as lexicographic pre-emptive weights have been used (Charnes and Cooper, 1961).

Fuzzy-set theorists

Fuzzy sets were introduced by Zadeh (1965) as an extension of the classical notion of sets. This idea is used in many MCDM algorithms to model and solve fuzzy problems.

Ordinal data based methods

Ordinal data has a wide application in real-world situations. In this regard, some MCDM methods were designed to handle ordinal data as input data. For example, Ordinal Priority Approach and Qualiflex method.

Multi-attribute utility theorists

Multi-attribute utility or value functions are elicited and used to identify the most preferred alternative or to rank order the alternatives. Elaborate interview techniques, which exist for eliciting linear additive utility functions and multiplicative nonlinear utility functions, may be used (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976). Another approach is to elicit value functions indirectly by asking the decision-maker a series of pairwise ranking questions involving choosing between hypothetical alternatives (PAPRIKA method; Hansen and Ombler, 2008).

French school

The French school focuses on decision aiding, in particular the ELECTRE family of outranking methods that originated in France during the mid-1960s. The method was first proposed by Bernard Roy (Roy, 1968).

Evolutionary multiobjective optimization school (EMO)

EMO algorithms start with an initial population, and update it by using processes designed to mimic natural survival-of-the-fittest principles and genetic variation operators to improve the average population from one generation to the next. The goal is to converge to a population of solutions which represent the nondominated set (Schaffer, 1984; Srinivas and Deb, 1994). More recently, there are efforts to incorporate preference information into the solution process of EMO algorithms (see Deb and Köksalan, 2010).

Grey system theory based methods

In the 1980s, Deng Julong proposed Grey System Theory (GST) and its first multiple-attribute decision-making model, called Deng&#x27;s Grey relational analysis (GRA) model. Later, the grey systems scholars proposed many GST based methods like Liu Sifeng&#x27;s Absolute GRA model, Grey Target Decision Making (GTDM) and Grey Absolute Decision Analysis (GADA).

Analytic hierarchy process (AHP)

The AHP first decomposes the decision problem into a hierarchy of subproblems. Then the decision-maker evaluates the relative importance of its various elements by pairwise comparisons. The AHP converts these evaluations to numerical values (weights or priorities), which are used to calculate a score for each alternative (Saaty, 1980). A consistency index measures the extent to which the decision-maker has been consistent in her responses. AHP is one of the more controversial techniques listed here, with some researchers in the MCDA community believing it to be flawed.

Several papers reviewed the application of MCDM techniques in various disciplines such as fuzzy MCDM, classic MCDM, sustainable and renewable energy, VIKOR technique, transportation systems, service quality, TOPSIS method, energy management problems, e-learning, tourism and hospitality, SWARA and WASPAS methods.

<text>Augathella is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Murweh, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Augathella had a population of 328 people.

== Geography ==
Augathella lies on the Matilda Highway, is north of the town of Charleville, west of Roma and west of Brisbane (Queensland&#x27;s capital). The town lies on the banks of the Warrego River.

Grazing is still the predominant industry of the area.

==History==
===Aboriginal people===
&quot;Bidjara&quot; (also known as &quot;Bidyara, Pitjara,&quot; and &quot;Peechara&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Bidjara people. The Bidjara language region includes the local government areas of the Shire of Murweh, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall as well as the properties of Nive Downs and Mount Tabor.

&quot;Gungabula&quot; (also known as &quot;Kongabula&quot; and &quot;Khungabula&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the headwaters of the Dawson River in Central Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Maranoa Region, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall and as well as the Carnarvon Range.

Gunya (Kunya, Kunja, Kurnja) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gunya people. The Gunya language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Paroo Shire Council, taking in Cunnamulla and extending north towards Augathella, east towards Bollon and west towards Thargomindah.

===British colonisation===
The first British explorer to enter the region was Edmund Kennedy, whose 1847 expedition encountered an Aboriginal community who communicated the words &quot;Yo, Yo&quot; to express affirmation. Kennedy subsequently called the creek where he found this community Yo Yo Creek.

Pastoralists started to take land in the region in early 1862 with the arrival of James Norman, who took up vast leaseholds on behalf of Joseph Fleming and Adeline Dollman. Norman established the Burenda, Yo Yo and Augathella properties.

Aboriginal resistance to colonisation in the region was notable in that several victories were achieved against the paramilitary units of the Native Police on the upper Warrego and Ward rivers. However, in 1864 a Native Police barracks was built on Yo Yo Creek, and punitive expeditions under officers such as Sub-Lieutenant Carr crushed any further resistance.

===Augathella township===
The town, built up gradually over what was Kunja tribal territory, came into being initially as a resting place for bullock teams lying at the convergence of three bullock tracks from Morven, Tambo, and Charleville. Originally called Burenda it was renamed Ellangowan (still the name of the local watering hole) and when gazetted in 1883 called Augathella. This is apparently an Indigenous Australian word meaning &quot;camp on a waterhole&quot;, referring the Warrego River. A service centre sprang up to service their needs and the needs of the burgeoning grazing industry.

Burenda Post Office opened on 1 September 1869. It was renamed Ellangowan in 1877 and Augathella in 1883.

Augathella Provisional School opened on 1 January 1884. On 7 August 1893 it became Augathella State School.

On Sunday 10 July 1892 St Luke&#x27;s Anglican church was officially opened by Bishop Nathaniel Dawes. A new church was built at a cost of £8300 and dedicated in 1957.

On 1 October 1928 Rev W.C. Radcliffe officially opened the Augathella Presbyterian Church.

The 1956 film Smiley was based on Moore Raymond&#x27;s novel of the same name, which was set in a fictionalised version of Augathella.

The town&#x27;s service centre was bypassed by the new Matilda Highway during the 1980s. Some new businesses have slowly encroached back onto the highway frontage.

Augathella and the surrounding district suffered extensive flood damage in April 1990 when the Warrego River burst its banks and flooded the town with more than 50 houses inundated.

The Augathella Library opened in 2000.

Since 2011 the main street of the town has been marked by 4.5m steel and copper giant sculpture of a meat ant - in a reference to its former junior football team, named the &quot;Mighty Meat Ants&quot;.

==Demographics==
In the , the town of Augathella had a population of 395 people.

In the , the locality of Augathella had a population of 449 people.

In the , the locality of Augathella had a population of 328 people.

<text>Royal Air Force Long Kesh, or more simply RAF Long Kesh, is a former Royal Air Force station at Maze, Lisburn, Northern Ireland.

Various aircraft operated from the airfield during the Second World War, including the Supermarine Seafire and Spitfire.

==History==
In 1940–1941, during Second World War, RAF Long Kesh was a primary attack target in &quot;Operation Green&quot;, a planned second front to accompany &quot;Operation Sea Lion&quot; for the conquest of the British Isles by Nazi Germany. RAF Long Kesh was to be attacked and wrecked by German airborne forces, whilst Aldergrove, Nutts Corner and Langford Lodge were to be captured.

Hangars were constructed at the airfield by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the use of Short Brothers to assemble the Short Stirling bomber. Some Stirlings were also built at the site, before their assembly line moved to RAF Maghaberry, the aircraft production facilities at RAF Long Kesh then concentrated on aircraft wing manufacturing. One of the RAF Long Kesh hangars was later used by Miles Aircraft for final assembly and test flying work of the Miles Messenger, which was made at its factory in a linen mill at Banbridge. The hangars are now the home of the Ulster Aviation Society and their collection of military, civil and general aviation aircraft.

== Long Kesh Detention Centre ==

From August 1971, during The Troubles, the then disused airfield and facilities of RAF Long Kesh became the Long Kesh Detention Centre, where Irish paramilitary suspects were detained by the British government without trial (under the Special Powers Act of 1922) during the Operation Demetrius phase of Operation Banner. In May 1974 Long Kesh housed 747 internees. On 15 October 1974 internees burned 21 of the compounds used to house the internees thereby destroying much of the camp. From 1976 the makeshift structures housing the detainees were replaced by newly constructed &quot;H-Blocks&quot;, and the facility was re-designated HM Prison Maze.

<text>Valiant Records was an independent record label distributed in the 1960s by Warner Bros. Records (and briefly by Four Star Television). The label was sold to Warner Bros. in 1967.

==History==

Valiant Records was formed in 1960 in California, by singer−songwriter Barry De Vorzon and manager Billy Sherman.

Valiant charted with its first release, &quot;Angel On My Shoulder&quot; recorded by Shelby Flint. De Vorzon&#x27;s own group, Barry and the Tamerlanes, hit in 1963 with &quot;I Wonder What She&#x27;s Doin&#x27; Tonight.&quot; Flint scored again in 1966 with a soft vocal version of &quot;Cast Your Fate To The Wind.&quot;

In 1966 De Vorzon rescued folk-rockers The Association from their obscurity at Jubilee Records. They debuted on Valiant (which had just ended a brief distribution stint with Four Star Television, the distributor of such shows as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; and &quot;Honey West&quot;) with a non-charting version of &quot;One Too Many Mornings.&quot; The next single records—&quot;Along Comes Mary,&quot; &quot;Cherish,&quot; &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Golden Heebie Jeebies,&quot; and &quot;No Fair At All&quot;—helped establish The Association as one of the premier Sunshine Pop groups of the 1960s.

==Demise==
In 1967, after a little over 110 singles and 11 albums (seven under Warner Bros. and four under Four Star/independent distribution), the Valiant Records label itself ceased to exist and was folded into Warner Bros. Records. Its output remains desirable to collectors, with the early years featuring a string of obscure but worthwhile white pop titles, and the later years an intriguing mix of slick Southern California psych and pop.

==Label variations==

===Singles===
*1960–1966 (Warner Bros. distribution) – Purple labels with silver print
*1966 (Four Star Television distribution) – Red label with black shield logo and &quot;A SUBSIDIARY OF FOUR STAR TELEVISION&quot; at the bottom perimeter of the label in either small or large letters
*1966–1967 (Independent distribution) – Same as above but with either the Four Star byline covered by a black bar or removed altogether

===Albums===
*1960–1966 (Warner Bros. distribution) – Purple or red labels with silver print
*1966 (Four Star distribution – VLM 5001/VLS 25001 only) – Red label with black shield and white knight head logos and &quot;A SUBSIDIARY OF FOUR STAR TELEVISION&quot; in small letters at the bottom perimeter of the label
*1966–1967 (Independent distribution) – Same as above but with either the Four Star byline covered by a black bar or removed altogether

===Numbering series ===
On a collectors note, Valiant singles sported three separate numbering series. The very first Valiant release bore the catalog number 45-111. But that record, &quot;Angel On My Shoulder&quot; by Shelby Flint became too big a hit for the new label to handle so Warner Bros. Records picked it up with a new catalog number, 6001. For Warner distributed singles, the 6000 series (6001–6062) ran from 1960 to 1966, followed by the 700 series (700-739 under Four Star Television, 740-762 as an independent label) from 1966–1967. Some numbers from 6002 to 6013 were shared with Montclare Records, a very short-lived Warner subsidiary, as well as several one-shot labels such as Elloma and Burbank. The first five numbers of the Four Star series (701-705) were reissues of the most popular singles of the 6000 series. Six catalog numbers from the second series were unused: 706, 707, 708, 710, 722, and 746.

Albums were also given different numbering sets. The seven albums distributed by Warner Bros. were numbered from W/WS 401–407, the four albums under Four Star/independent were issued VLM 5001–5004 for mono, VLS 25001–25004 for stereo. Warner Bros. reissued the Four Star/independent albums using numbers W (mono)/WS (stereo) 1701–1704 in alignment with the original issues.

==Unrelated labels also called Valiant==
In 1960, record label owner Joe Banashak started a New Orleans–based Valiant label, but threats of a lawsuit by Warner Bros. prompted Banashak to rename the label Instant Records in 1961.

Valiant Records was also the name of an unrelated label headquartered variously in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, and Bronx, New York, that re-released some albums originally issued on the Somerset Records label, largely for inexpensive supermarket and variety store distribution.

<doc id="1050604" wikidata="Q2348254" url="?curid=1050604" title="Uptown Records">
<text>Uptown Records is an American record label, based in New York City, founded in 1986 by old school rapper ‘Dr Jekyll’ - Andre Harrell. From the late 1980s into the early 1990s, it was a leader in New Jack Swing, R&amp;B, hip hop., and Hip Hop-Soul

==Beginnings and success==
In 1986, Andre Harrell, one half of short-lived rap duo Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, founded Uptown Records. Its compilation album, &quot;Uptown Is Kickin&#x27; It&quot; (1986) included the label&#x27;s signees Heavy D &amp; The Boyz and was distributed by MCA Records. The acts who recorded on the album were collectively known as The Uptown Crew. The Heavy D &amp; The Boyz&#x27; debut album, &quot;Living Large&quot; (1987) was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and found moderate mainstream success. Another artist that put Uptown on the map was Al B. Sure!, with his debut album &quot;In Effect Mode&quot; (1988) seeing commercial success and distributed by Warner Records. 1988 also saw two further successful releases from the label: the Gyrlz&#x27; debut album, &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot;, distributed by Capitol Records, and the eponymous album of Guy, a group whose lead member, Teddy Riley would lead the sound &quot;new jack swing&quot;. The &quot;Guy&quot; album reached No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart. Guy&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Future&quot;, was met with further success in 1990. Heavy D &amp; The Boyz&#x27; second album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Big Tyme&quot;, preceded their third album, &quot;Peaceful Journey&quot;, honoring the group&#x27;s member Trouble T Roy, who died as a result of an accidental fall while on tour.

By 1990, 20-year-old Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs began an internship at Uptown. Combs worked with newly signed acts Jodeci, Father MC, and Mary J. Blige, who altogether placed a number of singles on the R&amp;B chart. Marking a fusion of hip hop and R&amp;B was Mary J. Blige&#x27;s debut album &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot;, released in July 1992, whereby she was dubbed the Queen of Hip Hop Soul. Led by her single &quot;You Remind Me&quot;, it was certified three times platinum, honoring three million copies sold.

In 1991, Harrell was executive producer of the comedy film &quot;Strictly Business&quot;, starring Tommy Davidson and Halle Berry, as well as its soundtrack. The following year, Harrell and MCA reached a multimedia deal that eventuated in development of FOX&#x27;s hit television series &quot;New York Undercover&quot;—a police drama originally named &quot;Uptown Undercover&quot;—which aired from 1994 to 1998. The record label itself was renamed Uptown Enterprises. By 1993, it was the leading urban label.

In February 1993, the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; live, acoustic series featured Jodeci, Father MC, Mary J. Blige, Christopher Williams, and Heavy D, resulting in release of &quot;Uptown Unplugged&quot; as both album and home video. A resulting single, Jodeci&#x27;s live cover of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Lately&quot; peaked at #1 on the R&amp;B chart and #4 on the pop singles chart, the Billboard Hot 100. Later in 1993, Uptown released the soundtrack to the hip-hop film &quot;Who&#x27;s the Man?&quot;. Closing 1993, Uptown released Jodeci&#x27;s second album, &quot;Diary of a Mad Band&quot;.

==Decline==
In July 1993, amid issues with Harrell, Uptown fired Combs. Within two weeks, he launched his own label, Bad Boy, while taking with him The Notorious B.I.G. Uptown promptly suffered, yet Combs still executive produced Mary J. Blige&#x27;s second album, &quot;My Life&quot;, released December 1994, soon certified 3x Multi-Platinum in the U.S.

Increasingly dissatisfied, Mary J. Blige and Jodeci both signed to West Coast Management, the firm of Suge Knight, CEO of Death Row, based in Los Angeles. Thus, they gained double the royalty rates, more creative control, and sizable back payments. Meanwhile, the final Heavy D &amp; The Boyz album, &quot;Nuttin&#x27; But Love&quot;, was released in 1994, and soon certified Platinum in the U.S.

In 1995, Uptown&#x27;s new R&amp;B group Soul for Real&#x27;s debut album &quot;Candy Rain&quot; was released, as was Jodeci&#x27;s third and final studio album for Uptown Records, &quot;The Show, the After Party, the Hotel&quot;. Later in 1995, Harrell left Uptown to become CEO of Motown Records, while Heavy D, executive vice president of Uptown, became Uptown&#x27;s president and CEO. Prominent acts like Mary J. Blige and Jodeci signed directly to Uptown&#x27;s distribution label, MCA.

By 1996, MCA along with Universal Studios, the filmmaking house, was bought by the owners of Seagram&#x27;s, and became Universal Music Group. In 1997, Heavy D resigned as CEO of Uptown, absorbed into Universal Music during 1999. In December 2019, television network BET announced production of a miniseries on the history of Uptown Records.

==Present day==
As of 1999, the label was thought to be defunct. However in 2022, Ciara announced that she had signed a deal with Uptown Records via Republic Records, which would see the label assist in distributing her eighth studio album.

<text>Charles Ashenoff (born Carlos Santiago Espada Moises; January 6, 1964), better known by his ring name Konnan, is a Cuban-born American professional wrestling personality, manager, and former professional wrestler. He is signed to Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA). In Impact, he was the manager of The Latin American Xchange (LAX) and serves as a member of the creative team. During a career spanning almost three decades, he has wrestled for independent and national promotions in the United States and Mexico, and held fifteen title belts in nine promotions. He was also involved in the creation of Lucha Underground, where he was supposed to serve as a writer and producer, but ended up in an on-camera role as manager to Prince Puma throughout the first season. Outside of wrestling, Konnan is an occasional rapper.

He is best known to United States audiences for his run in World Championship Wrestling as part of the nWo stable and as part of The Filthy Animals. He also formed 
the 3 Live Kru for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in the early 2000s and later the Latin American Xchange (LAX) stable there. In Mexico, Konnan was the first-ever CMLL World Heavyweight Champion, and the leader of the Foreign Legion in AAA when they were the top stable.

==Early life==
Konnan was born Carlos Santiago Espada Moises in Santiago, Cuba, of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. In 1966, he and his mother arrived in Boston. Soon after landing in Boston, she met a young half-Jewish, half-Puerto Rican private investigator from New York named Richard Ashenoff. They soon married, and raised Carlos together. By 1967, the family relocated to Carol City in South Florida. When Richard formally adopted Carlos, he listed Carlos&#x27;s legal name as Charles Ashenoff.

By 1976, under the influence of older friends and neighbors, Ashenoff had gotten into stealing cars. He learned how to drive at 12, learned to box, and was an &quot;avid weightlifter&quot;. Ashenoff was expelled from several schools before landing at Miami Southwest High. In 1982, he graduated a year early from Southwest Miami Senior High School, and was arrested and charged as a juvenile with credit card theft and motorcycle theft. Shortly after his 18th birthday, Ashenoff was caught selling drugs and charged as an adult. He was given a choice of going to jail or entering the military. He chose the latter, joining the United States Navy.

After basic training, Ashenoff was relocated to San Diego, and assigned to a destroyer tender in the Pacific Fleet – the &quot;USS Cape Cod (AD-43)&quot;. He won the California state (amateur) Middleweight Boxing Championship in 1983. He set a goal to qualify for the Junior Olympics in boxing, but injured his shoulder in training and was deployed to the Middle East subsequent to the U.S. Embassy bombing in Beirut on April 18, 1983. His ship was in the Strait of Hormuz when the US Marine barracks (along with the French paratrooper barracks) were bombed on October 24, 1983. By 1984, the &quot;Cape Cod&quot; was rotated out of the Persian Gulf. Ashenoff returned to San Diego, and received an honorable discharge.

==Professional wrestling career==
=== Early career (1988–1996) ===

In San Diego, Konnan met John Roberts. Dave Meltzer of the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; then details Ashenoff&#x27;s first foray in to professional wrestling:

Carlos traveled to Tijuana on Wednesday, January 6, 1988, (his 24th birthday), where he was led to the dressing area and introduced to Manuel de los Santos, the promoter of the show, and who also wrestled in the main event as &quot;Kiss&quot;. De los Santos took one look at the 215-pound bodybuilder and did the classic double-take—what the hell is this guy doing here, and, how quickly can I get this guy in the ring. Konnan introduced himself and explained how he was brought here by his manager/agent, John Roberts. Roberts had already bragged to de los Santos that Carlos had been a wrestler in Florida. Suddenly, a big roar (laughter) went up from another wrestler, Miguel Lopez, who wrestled as Rey Misterio. Lopez/Misterio explained to Carlos that Roberts was just a nutty fan, always in the front row, but that he did nothing involved with managing or agent-ing or anything else in the business. Still, the wrestlers asked Carlos, want to give it a try?

Billed as El Centurión (&quot;The Centurion&quot;), Ashenoff debuted for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) on January 6, 1988.

In the early part of his career, he wrestled for many different promotions. After making his debut for UWA, Konnan wrestled for the UWA Heavyweight title against El Canek at UWA 14 on January 29, 1989, and wrestled six- and eight-man tag matches intermittently for the promotion until 1994, with the likes of Dos Caras, Mascara Sagrada, and others. All of his matches for UWA after 1991 were cross-promotions with EMLL and AAA.

Konnan wrestled in a six-man, two out of three falls, tag team match as &quot;Konnan El Barbaro&quot; (&quot;Konnan the Barbarian&quot;) with Lizmark and Yoshihiro Asai against As Charro, Indio Yori and Negro Casas on February 3, 1989, for World Wrestling Association. Konnan joined Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre (EMLL) later that year. He used &quot;Konnan El Barbaro&quot; with EMLL as well.

Konnan&#x27;s first stint with World Championship Wrestling lasted only a few weeks. His debut was at Starrcade on December 16, 1990. Teaming with his trainer and mentor, Rey Misterio, Konnan entered the Pat O&#x27;Connor Memorial International Cup Tag Team Tournament held at the event. They defeated Norman Smiley and Chris Adams in the quarter-finals, but lost to eventual winners, the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) in the semi-finals. He then won a televised match on WCW Power Hour against Chuck Coates on January 19, 1991. Konnan would not return to the promotion until 1996.

While still part of WCW, Konnan was contacted by talent scout Pat Patterson on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1990, which led to a meeting with Vince McMahon, where the initial idea for what became Max Moon was discussed. According to Konnan, &quot;When I was wrestling in Japan, I saw this Japanese anime cartoon robot on TV that shot confetti and fire. [Vince] asked if I knew anybody that could design it.&quot; Konnan was given an outfit (purchased by the WWF at the cost of $15,000) bedecked with circuitry and a pyrotechnic gun that shot sparkles into the crowd. Konnan recollected later that the costs associated with the costume led to problems between himself and the promotion right from the start.

Days later he received a tryout on January 7, 1991, at a &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; taping in Amarillo, Texas defeating Ultraman. He returned again on March 26 in Las Vegas, Nevada, defeating Louie Spicolli in a &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; dark match. He would defeat Spicolli again one night later at a &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; taping in Reno. Konnan returned again on January 7, 1992, at a &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; taping in Daytona Beach, FL. wrestling this time as The Latin Fury, he defeated The Heartbreaker. The next day he defeated The Juicer in a dark match at a &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; taping in Fort Myers, Florida. Konnan would wrestle twice more as The Latin Fury, the final time at a house show in Hyannis, Massachusetts on July 19, 1992, when he defeated Pete Doherty.

The next day, when he appeared at a &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; taping in Worcester, Massachusetts against The Mercenary, he was renamed El Relámpago. He wrestled again as El Relámpago the following night against Luis Mendieta.

A little over a month later he received the gimmick that he would become known for, Max Moon (although he was originally called The Comet Kid for a handful of appearances). The Moon character, created by Konnan, was that of a cyborg from &quot;The Future&quot; or &quot;Outer Space&quot;.

Back in EMLL, Konnan lost his mask to Perro Aguayo in a &quot;Lucha de Apuesta&quot; mask versus hair match. on June 9, 1991, by disqualification. After the match, a young boy—introduced as Konnan&#x27;s brother—entered the ring crying and handed Konnan his mask back, generating considerable bonhomie towards Konnan from the sympathetic crowd.

In 1991, EMLL changed its name officially to &quot;Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre&quot; (CMLL). Konnan then became the first-ever CMLL World Heavyweight Champion later that year by winning a tournament consisting of four matches at four events: an eight-man elimination match for the first round on May 24, 1991; a four-man battle royal quarterfinal on May 31; a two-out-of-three falls semifinal match on June 7; and finally, a two-out-of-three falls match against Cien Caras at EMLL Super Viernes in Mexico City on June 9, 1991.

In 1992, Konnan, along with several other EMLL wrestlers, joined Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA). Shortening his ring name to simply &quot;Konnan&quot;, he feuded with Cien Caras.

Back in AAA, following interference from Jake Roberts, Konnan lost a two out of three falls retirement match by count-out to Caras at Triplemanía I on April 30, 1993, in front of 48,000 fans in Mexico City, setting the all-time attendance record for a Mexican wrestling event. Konnan did not comply with the stipulations of the match and returned to defeat Roberts in a hair versus hair match at Triplemanía II on May 27, 1994, in Tijuana.

Later in 1994, Konnan began a storyline where he betrayed his tag team partner, Perro Aguayo, and formed a heel alliance known as Los Gringos Locos with Eddie Guerrero, Art Barr and Madonna&#x27;s Boyfriend. Aguayo gained his revenge on Konnan by defeating him in the only AAA pay-per-view, &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, in a steel cage match. He eventually became the AAA booker. Konnan defeated Killer on February 2, 1996, in Querétaro to become the first ever AAA Heavyweight Champion. He vacated the title after leaving AAA in October 1996 to form his own promotion, Promo Azteca, and the title remained inactive until 2004. Konnan&#x27;s Mexican wrestling career was hampered in the late-1990s by his American wrestling commitments, and &quot;Promo Azteca&quot; closed in 1998. He made a return to the Mexican wrestling circuit in the 2000s after a six-year absence, selling out arenas in Mexico City and Guadalajara.

===World Wrestling Federation (1992–1993)===
Konnan made his WWF debut on September 1, 1992, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, during a &quot;Superstars&quot; taping under the name The Comet Kid when he pinned Barry Horowitz. After three televised matches, Konnan abruptly left the WWF following a disagreement with WWF owner Vince McMahon in 1992. Konnan was not showing up for WWF events due to his rising fame in Mexico, and his supposed &quot;bad attitude&quot; and heat from fellow WWF workers leading to a very strained relationship with McMahon, who had invested heavily in the Max Moon character, both financially and creatively, up until that point.

Konnan was still working in Mexico while under contract to WWF, and was also simultaneously appearing in a Mexican &quot;telenovela&quot; aimed at children called . As he was becoming more popular in Mexico, he was not as focused on making it in America. Konnan recollected, &quot;Wrestling was so hot in Mexico, because they had lifted this 30-year ban on wrestling on TV in Mexico City. I was able to capitalize on that wrestling boom. I was wrestling three times in one day on many weekends. The amount of work was incredible. It was like when Raw and Nitro were going head-to-head and there was work for everybody.&quot;

There was also some locker room tension over the costs associated with the costume, Konnan&#x27;s perceived attitude, and Konnan also was missing tapings because he was more successful in Mexico and was not focusing on WWF. In the end, the Max Moon character was given to Paul Diamond, who appeared as the character on the first episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; on January 11, 1993. After a brief run, the character was abandoned.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995)===
After meeting Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) booker Paul Heyman while on a wrestling tour of Singapore, Konnan joined ECW in 1995 and feuded with The Sandman. He appeared at ECW November to Remember on November 18, 1995, squashing Jason Knight. He also wrestled at an event co-promoted by ECW and the AAA in Chicago, Illinois.

===World Championship Wrestling (1996–2001)===
====United States Heavyweight Champion and Dungeon of Doom (1996–1997)====
Konnan returned to WCW on a full-time basis on the January 22, 1996, edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, where he announced that he would defend his &quot;Mexican Heavyweight Championship&quot; against Psicosis, the following night at Clash of the Champions, where Konnan retained the title. As a WCW employee, he was largely responsible for the hiring of several prominent Mexican wrestlers by WCW, including Rey Mysterio Jr., Psicosis, Juventud Guerrera and La Parka. Konnan defeated One Man Gang for the United States Heavyweight Championship on January 29, 1996. During his reign, he continued to defend his IWAS and AAA Heavyweight Championships in Mexico (these championships were billed as a &quot;Mexican Heavyweight Title&quot; wherever Konnan wore one or the other to a WCW ring). Konnan successfully defended the United States Heavyweight Championship against One Man Gang at SuperBrawl VI, Eddie Guerrero at Uncensored, Jushin Liger at Slamboree and El Gato at The Great American Bash before losing the title to Ric Flair on July 7 at Bash at the Beach following interference from Flair&#x27;s valets Miss Elizabeth and Woman.

Several months after losing the United States Championship, Konnan became a villain and joined The Dungeon of Doom. However, the gimmick was already on its way out. According to Kevin Sullivan (the originator of the stable), speaking in a retrospective interview in July 2016, Konnan &quot;didn&#x27;t fit in The Dungeon of Doom. He was forced into it.&quot; Sullivan also praised Konnan highly: [He&#x27;s] a fabulous performer and has a great mind for the wrestling business. He should have been on his own. Putting him with us, he just lost all the steam he had. He brought the luchadors into WCW, so he had a real effect on professional wrestling.&quot;

====New World Order and World Television Champion (1997–1999)====

Konnan joined the New World Order (nWo) on July 14, 1997. Konnan developed an increasingly hip-hop based gimmick and was nicknamed &quot;K-Dogg.&quot; During his first stint in the nWo, Konnan feuded with the Luchadores whom he had brought to WCW. During this storyline, he wrestled in a Mexican Death match at Road Wild against Rey Mysterio, Jr. and a match against Juventud Guerrera at Uncensored in March 1998. When the nWo divided into two rival factions on the May 4, 1998, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Konnan sided with the nWo Wolfpac, led by Kevin Nash. The Wolfpac feuded with nWo Hollywood, led by Hollywood Hogan and became tweeners. On the November 30, 1998, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Konnan defeated Chris Jericho for the World Television Championship. His reign lasted until December 28, 1998, when he lost to nWo Hollywood member Scott Steiner on &quot;Nitro&quot; following interference from Buff Bagwell. When the two halves of the nWo reunited in January 1999, Konnan was thrown out of the nWo for standing up for Rey Mysterio, Jr and was attacked by Lex Luger. As a result, he became a face and teamed with Mysterio to fight the nWo. After feuding with nWo member Lex Luger, Konnan and Mysterio, Jr. were defeated by The Outsiders at SuperBrawl IX, with The Outsiders removing Mysterio&#x27;s mask in the process. Konnan later criticized WCW for not respecting Mexican wrestling culture by writing storylines that saw several Mexican wrestlers unceremoniously unmasked (Juventud Guerrera, Psicosis, and Mysterio). He compared asking a &quot;luchador&quot; to remove their mask to &quot;going to Japan and telling the Japanese they have to eat with a fork instead of chopsticks.&quot;

====No Limit Soldiers and Filthy Animals (1999–2001)====

Konnan was kicked out of the NWO Wolfpac on January 11, 1999. A week later he would enter the ring using the &quot;Psycho&quot; theme music which would later on becoming Rey Mysterio&#x27;s theme song after his unmasking and the Filthy Animals theme for a while till it was replaced with &quot;The Reason&quot;.
Konnan spent several months feuding with Disco Inferno, and then he began a rivalry with Stevie Ray. He and Mysterio formed an alliance with Master P and his No Limit Soldiers and fought with The West Texas Rednecks. After Master P left WCW, Konnan formed a stable known as The Filthy Animals. He and Mysterio, representing the Filthy Animals, defeated Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) for the WCW World Tag Team Championship on October 18, 1999. They were scheduled to defend the titles against Harlem Heat in the MGM Grand Garden Arena on October 24, 1999, at Halloween Havoc, but on the night of the event Mysterio was announced as being injured. The title was then contested in a three-way tag match pitting Konnan and Billy Kidman, representing the Filthy Animals, against Harlem Heat and the First Family (Hugh Morrus and Brian Knobs). Harlem Heat regained the title after Stevie Ray pinned Morrus. Konnan and Kidman defeated Harlem Heat for the title the next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, but lost to Harris Brothers (Ron and Don Harris) on November 22, 1999.

Konnan was inactive throughout early 2000, as he was suspended for three months by Bill Busch after requesting his release from WCW, unhappy with the way he was being used. Shortly after returning from suspension and reforming the Filthy Animals, Konnan was sidelined once again, this time with a legitimately torn triceps muscle, damaged when Van Hammer threw Juventud Guerrera at him during a match and Guerrera&#x27;s elbow connected with Konnan&#x27;s upper arm as he attempted to catch him. Throughout 2000, the Filthy Animals feuded with other stables, including The Misfits In Action, The Natural Born Thrillers and Team Canada. At WCW&#x27;s final pay-per-view event, Greed on March 18, 2001, Lance Storm and Mike Awesome (representing Team Canada) defeated Hugh Morrus and Konnan. The assets of WCW were sold to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) five days later, on March 23.

===Independent Circuit (2001–2003)===
Following the sale of WCW, Konnan returned to wrestling for multiple independent promotions. He first went to Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW), where he took part in a tournament for the then-vacant XPW Television title on August 25, 2001. He defeated Johnny Webb and Vic Grimes in the first and second rounds, respectively, and then lost the final to Kaos. He then wrestled a match with Damian Steele on October 13, 2001. He wrestled Steele again on November 24, 2001, in a &quot;Loser Leaves XPW&quot; match at &quot;XPW Revolution&quot; at Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, California. Konnan won the match.

Konnan wrestled in Australia, the UK, and Germany for World Wrestling All-Stars from October to December 2001. His first match with the promotion was October 19, 2001, where he defeated Gangrel. He would win two further matches against Gangrel during his time at the promotion, but his singles record was generally poor: he lost in the first round of the WWA Heavyweight Championship title in a dog collar match against Road Dogg on October 26, 2001, and lost three tables matches against Norman Smiley on December 8, 9 and 11, 2001. Konnan&#x27;s tag-team record was much better: Konnan went 6–0 teamed with Nathan Jones (exclusively against the team of Lenny Lane and Lodi, better-known formerly as The West Hollywood Blondes in WCW) between November 27 – December 11, 2001.

After a no-contest match against Sandman on January 12, 2002, at &quot;XPW New Year&#x27;s Revolution 2&quot;, Konnan then went to World Wrestling Council, where he won the World Wrestling Council World Tag Team Championship with Carly Colón, defeating Thunder and Lightning on May 26, 2002.

Konnan appeared on the inaugural Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) pay-per-view on June 19, 2002, in the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama. He entered the Gauntlet for the Gold match for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but he was chokeslammed and subsequently eliminated by Malice.
He then went to Maximum Xtreme Pro Wrestling, where he lost another heavyweight title match; this time against Simon Diamond for the MXPW Heavyweight Title on August 12, 2002. He lost yet another title match upon returning to World Wrestling Council, losing by disqualification to Carly Colón in a match for the Universal Heavyweight title at WWC 29th Aniversario on September 14, 2002. Konnan finally won the title by defeating Colón on November 2, 2002, only to lose the title back to Colón 21 days later.

Returning to World Wrestling All-Stars in November and December 2002, Konnan defeated Norman Smiley twice in singles matches on November 28 and 29, 2002, and won in three minutes against Nate Webb on December 6, 2002, at &quot;WWA The Retribution&quot; in Glasgow. Subsequent to that, Konnan tag-teamed with Smiley against Disco Inferno and Malice for three matches between December 8–13, 2002, and won all three.

Konnan made two final appearances for World Wrestling All-Stars in May 2003, before the promotion folded. He also wrestled a tag match teamed with Norman Smiley for MXPW in September 2003. These would be his last extended stints in the independent circuit for nearly a decade.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003–2007)===
====Authentic Luchadores and 3 Live Kru (2003–2005)====

Konnan returned to TNA on February 12, 2003, and formed a short-lived villainous alliance, the Authentic Luchadores, with fellow Hispanic wrestlers Juventud Guerrera, Super Crazy and The S.A.T.(Spanish Announce Team). The stable feuded with Jerry Lynn until April 2, 2003, when Lynn claimed that he had been heavily influenced by &quot;lucha libre&quot; and that he respected his Mexican opponents, thus earning the friendship of Konnan.

Throughout May and June 2003, Konnan began teaming with B.G. James and Ron Killings, and in July 2003 the trio formed a stable known as the 3 Live Kru. The Kru first wrestled as a unit on August 13, 2003, defeating The New Church (Sinn, Vampire Warrior and Tempest). On November 26, the Kru defeated Simon Diamond, Johnny Swinger and Glenn Gilberti in a six-man tag team match with the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championships on the line. The championship was held by all three members of the Kru, until January 28, 2004, when they were defeated by Kevin Northcutt and Legend in Nashville. After several abortive attempts to regain the tag title, the Kru began supporting Ron Killings&#x27;s bid to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. The Kru later feuded with Jarrett&#x27;s mercenaries, The Elite Guard (Chad Collyer, Hotstuff Hernandez, and Onyx).

While with TNA, Konnan also returned to Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, making his first appearance at &quot;AAA Sin Limite - Guerra De Titanes 2004&quot; on May 12, 2004. Konnan was teamed with Rikishi and lost to Cibernetico and La Parka by disqualification.

On July 14, 2004, the 3 Live Kru, Dusty Rhodes and Larry Zbyszko defeated Jarrett, Ken Shamrock and the Elite Guard in a ten-man tag team match. The Kru began feuding with Team Canada in August 2004, and at the inaugural three-hour TNA pay-per-view, Victory Road on November 7, 2004, Konnan and James defeated Team Canada members Bobby Roode and &quot;Showtime&quot; Eric Young for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Their reign lasted one month, with Team Canada regaining the title on December 5, 2004, at Turning Point with the help of the injured Johnny Devine.

Throughout early 2005, the Kru feuded with Michael Shane and Kazarian, Team Canada and The Naturals. Dissension arose after James&#x27;s former tag team partner from the WWF, Billy Gunn, joined TNA as &quot;The New Age Outlaw&quot; and began trying to convince James to reform their highly successful tag team, the New Age Outlaws. Konnan and Killings feuded with The Outlaw and &quot;The Alpha Male&quot; Monty Brown, with James&#x27;s loyalties divided. From March 2005 onwards, Konnan was also feuding with Vampiro and La Parka in AAA. The feud went on intermittently through 2006.

Brown and The Outlaw, who had by now renamed himself &quot;Kip James&quot;, defeated Konnan and Killings at No Surrender on July 17, 2005, with James declining to help either team. Konnan and Killings became increasingly frustrated, at one point referring to themselves as the &quot;2Live Kru&quot;. The two teams faced one another in a No Surrender rematch on August 14, 2005, at Sacrifice, with James appointed guest referee by Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko, and James reaffirmed his loyalty to the Kru by attacking Kip, enabling Konnan to pin him and win the match. The Kru, apparently undivided, celebrated together following the match.

Over the following weeks, Kip James began assisting the 3 Live Kru, and on October 23, 2005, at Bound for Glory, he saved Konnan from a beating at the hands of Team Canada. On the November 26 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, B.G. James brought Kip James and the 3 Live Kru to ringside, then asked Killings and Konnan whether James could join the stable. Following a heated argument between the still skeptical Konnan and B.G., both Killings and Konnan gave their assent, and the 4 Live Kru was born. At Turning Point the 4 Live Kru faced Team Canada in an eight-man tag match. In the course of the match, Konnan attacked both B.G. and Kip James.

====Latin American Xchange (2005–2007)====

On the December 31, 2005, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Konnan told B.G.&#x27;s father, Bob Armstrong, that he was a &quot;hothead&quot; and invited Armstrong to accompany him backstage for an apology. Instead of apologizing, Konnan turned heel by leading Armstrong into an ambush at the hands of Apolo and the debuting Homicide. The trio, later identified as The Latin American Xchange (LAX), then instructed an unconscious Armstrong to tell B.G. and Kip to &quot;take care of their own business&quot;. At Final Resolution on January 15, 2006, Konnan and Homicide defeated The Naturals. After Apolo was released by TNA, he was replaced by Machete, who was in turn evicted from LAX by Konnan and Homicide. In subsequent weeks, Konnan began feuding with Bob Armstrong. On the April 8, 2006, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Konnan faced Armstrong in an &quot;Arm Wrestling Challenge&quot;; the contest ended in a no-contest after LAX member Hernandez attacked Armstrong. At Lockdown on April 23, 2006, Konnan was defeated by Armstrong in an arm wrestling contest held within the confines of a steel cage; following the bout, each member of the LAX received ten lashes from the James Gang.

May 2006 was very busy for Konnan. In AAA, he made his first appearance with &quot;La Legión Extranjera&quot; (with Chessman and Ron Killings) on May 1, 2006, losing to El Zorro, Octagon and Vampiro Canadiense at &quot;AAA Sin Limite&quot;. He soon became the leader of the stable, which was active through 2009. That same month, Konnan became the &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; Spanish color commentator. Additionally, he and the LAX began a storyline that saw them refuse to wrestle (as well as himself and Moody Jack refuse to commentate), claiming that Latinos were discriminated against within TNA.

On June 24, 2006, Konnan participated in the first &quot;lucha libre&quot; event in San Diego. He stated that &quot;Unfortunately there has never been &quot;lucha libre&quot; in the South Bay, there has never been &quot;lucha libre&quot; for &quot;la raza.&quot; Finally they will be able to see the &quot;lucha libre&quot; that they watch on television live here a few minutes from their home.&quot;

In early 2007, Konnan underwent hip replacement surgery, and his appearances in TNA from then on saw him frequently using a wheelchair. In June, Konnan left TNA, as did Ron Killings. Konnan gave several interviews about the drug abuse problem in pro wrestling around that time, most notably to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, which indicated that Konnan believed his &quot;hip degenerated after years of steroid abuse and the physical toll of his sport, and...painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs ruined [his] kidney.&quot; He would reiterate the issue on his podcast some years later He successfully underwent kidney transplant surgery on July 23, 2007.

===Return to AAA (2004–2006)===
While with TNA, Konnan also returned to AAA (Asistencia, Asesoría y Administración de Espectáculos), making his first appearance at &quot;AAA Sin Limite - Guerra De Titanes 2004&quot; on May 12, 2004. Konnan was teamed with Rikishi and lost to Cibernetico and La Parka by disqualification. From March 2005 onwards, Konnan was also feuding with Vampiro and La Parka in AAA. The feud went on intermittently through 2006. On May 1, 2006, he made his first appearance with &quot;La Legión Extranjera&quot; (with Chessman and Ron Killings), losing to El Zorro, Octagon and Vampiro Canadiense at &quot;AAA Sin Limite&quot;. He soon became the leader of the stable, which was active through 2009.

On June 24, 2006, Konnan participated in the first &quot;lucha libre&quot; event in San Diego. He stated that &quot;Unfortunately there has never been &quot;lucha libre&quot; in the South Bay, there has never been &quot;lucha libre&quot; for &quot;la raza.&quot; Finally they will be able to see the &quot;lucha libre&quot; that they watch on television live here a few minutes from their home.&quot;

===Second return to AAA and independent promotions (2007–2012)===
Despite having left TNA in June 2007, Konnan did not wrestle for AAA until October, and only wrestled in four matches during the remainder of the year, due to his aforementioned surgeries. Konnan returned to World Wrestling Council at &quot;WWC Euphoria Tour 2008&quot; on January 6, 2008, with Ron Killings of the 3 Live Kru, losing a tag team match against Eddy and Orlando Colon. In March 2008, Konnan sued TNA for racism and discrimination, alleging that while the company said that they would help pay for his hip replacement surgery, they did not. Konnan also claimed that TNA helped pay for Scott Steiner&#x27;s operation, but did not pay for Ron Killings&#x27;s surgery from around the same time.

On October 24, 2008, Konnan took part in an &quot;Eight Man Domo De La Muerte Steel Cage Winner Gets Control Over AAA&quot; match where &quot;La Legión Extranjera&quot; (consisting of Konnan, Electroshock, Kenzo Suzuki, and Rellik) defeated La Parka, Latin Lover, Octagon and Super Fly. On March 15, 2009, Konnan lost a Hair vs. Hair match against Vampiro Canadiense. He continued to wrestle with &quot;La Legión&quot; until February 2010.

On June 12, 2010, in a Four Way Elimination Match for the vacant AAA Parejas Increibles Tag Team Title, Cibernetico and Konnan defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. and Silver Cain, Electroshock and Super Fly, and LA Par-K and La Parka to become the champions. Konnan wrestled his last official match for AAA on October 1, 2010, a three-on-two Handicap Hardcore match pitting Joe Lider and Nicho el Millonario as &quot;La Hermandad Extrema&quot; against the threesome of Damian 666, Halloween and Konnan as &quot;La Sociedad&quot;. Konnan&#x27;s team lost the match.

Konnan then made a series of appearances for independent promotions again, beginning with his only appearance as a performer for El Hijo de Perro Aguayo&#x27;s promotion Perros del Mal on November 6, 2010. &quot;La Sociedad&quot; defeated Charlie Haas, Super Crazy and Tony Wilson at &quot;PDM The War&quot; at Auditorio Municipal Fausto Gutierrez Moreno in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.

On July 3, 2011, Konnan, together with El Canek and El Rayo de Jalisco Jr, defeated Los Hermanos Dinamita (Cien Caras, Mascara Ano 2000, and Universo 2000) by disqualification at International Wrestling Revolution Group&#x27;s &quot;Festival De Las Mascaras 2011&quot; at Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan de Juarez, Estado de Mexico, Mexico. He then took part in a Mixed Five-on-four Handicap Match on August 7, 2011, where the team of Dr. Wagner Jr., Electroshock, El Elegido and El Zorro defeated Konnan, Chessman, Jennifer Blake, Mini Psicosis and Nicho el Millonario as part of a telethon benefit show in Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico. On October 7, 2011, Konnan and Nicho el Millonario, wrestling as La Sociedad lost by DQ to El Mesias and Extreme Tiger in an event for Promociones MV held at the Auditorio Municipal Fausto Gutierrez Moreno in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.

At &quot;Pro Wrestling Superstars&#x27; WrestleReunion VI&quot; held at The Westin Los Angeles Airport in Los Angeles, California, on January 28, 2012, Konnan took part in a 20-man Battle Royal featuring Brutus Beefcake, Gangrel, Greg Valentine, and others. The match was eventually won by The Godfather. Konnan then defeated The Convict at High Impact Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;HIW Summer Invasion 2012&quot; at Treaty Grounds in La Loche, Saskatchewan, Canada on August 23, 2012.

===Final match and outside-the-ring roles (2013–present)===
On February 3, 2013, Konnan was (in-storyline) fired from AAA. However, he returned to the promotion on April 15, announcing that he was once again becoming an in-ring performer. However, he instead moved on to other duties. He told Stephen Dean Johnson of &quot;SLAM! Wrestling&quot; that he is &quot;kind of a jack-of-all-trades with Triple AAA. I write, produce, act as agent, and international liaison for talent. I am also on TV as one of the main managers for heels.&quot; In that same interview, he teased the then-upcoming deal that would lead to &quot;Lucha Underground&quot;. Konnan wrestled what appears to be his final match to date on September 15, 2013, in a six-man tag match. He, El Mariachi and Kafu defeated Derek Sanders, Oliver John and Vaquero Fantasma at an event taking place at the Santa Cruz County Fair in Watsonville, California.

In August 2014, Konnan had his left hip replaced. He was also very critical of WWE on Twitter regarding Alberto Del Rio&#x27;s release from WWE for &quot;unprofessional conduct regarding an alleged racist joke made by a WWE employee and a concurrent contract dispute involving Rey Mysterio where WWE extended Mysterio&#x27;s contract without permission.

In September 2014, Konnan was announced as one of the AAA wrestlers to star in the El Rey network&#x27;s new television series &quot;Lucha Underground&quot;. In the first season, he appeared as the manager of Prince Puma and claimed responsibility for bringing Fénix, Pentagón Jr. and Drago into the promotion.

On March 20, 2015, Konnan was ringside at a show organized by the independent promotion The Crash, in Tijuana, Mexico, when El Hijo del Perro Aguayo died in a freak accident during a match. He was named Crash&#x27; Head of creative until December 2017, when he was released.

In February 2016, Konnan stated that he had lost his creative position in AAA and was now merely a consultant for the promotion. He then levelled several accusations at AAA regarding non-payment of talent.

Konnan was named Head of Creative of Aro Lucha. 

=== Return to Impact Wrestling (2017–2019) ===
In March 2017, Konnan returned to Impact Wrestling as the manager of The Latin American Xchange (Homicide, Ortiz, Santana and Diamante). On January 23, 2019, it was revealed that Konnan would now be working as a member of the creative team for Impact Wrestling.

=== Third return to AAA (2018–present) ===
On June 4 in &quot;Verano de Escándalo&quot;, Konnan returned to the AAA helping Jeff Jarrett win the AAA Mega Championship against Rey Wagner and Rey Mysterio Jr. before being faced by Fénix. On July 14 in Querétaro, Konnan and his group MAD make their debut, but were interrupted by La Parka, starting a rivalry.

During 2024, Konnan began to clash with Latin Lover, who had been appointed as an authority figure on-screen. At Triplemanía XXXII: Mexico City, after Alberto el Patrón turned villainous, Konnan aligned himself with Alberto and attacked Latin Lover.

=== Major League Wrestling (2018–2022) ===
Starting in 2018 Konnan began appearing in Major League Wrestling as a manager for Pentagon Jr. and Fenix, among other AAA wrestlers. He and his clients engaged in a feud with MLW World Heavyweight Champion Low Ki. On December 14, 2018, Konnan challenged Low Ki in a no-disqualification match for his championship, in a losing effort. The match was stopped by the referee when Low Ki, Ricky Martinez, and Hijo de L.A. Park would not stop attacking Konnan. Low Ki then &quot;shanked&quot; Konnan with some object, but Tom Lawlor ran out to make the save.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2020–2021) ===
On November 17, 2020, Konnan returned to TNT for the first time since 2001, when he appeared on an episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;. During his appearance, Konnan reunited with former LAX members Santana and Ortiz, both of whom were now wrestling for All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and were also members of Chris Jericho&#x27;s wrestling stable Inner Circle. The reunion occurred during an Inner Circle party in Las Vegas. Konnan later appeared at AEW&#x27;s marquee event Double or Nothing on May 30, 2021. During the main event match, which was a Stadium Stampede match that involved The Inner Circle, Konnan had a cameo appearance as a DJ inside a club in the TIAA Bank Field stadium, briefly assisting Santana and Ortiz.

<text>USS &quot;Walrus&quot; (SS-437), a World War II &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the walrus, a gregarious, aquatic mammal found in Arctic waters, related to the seal and a prime source of leather, oil, ivory, and food. Like the second USS &quot;Walrus&quot; (SS-431), she was not completed.

&quot;Walrus&quot;″s keel was laid down on 21 June 1945 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. Work on the submarine was suspended on 7 January 1946 when the contract for her construction was cancelled, although she was launched on 20 September 1946, sponsored by Miss Winifred P. Nagle.

&quot;Walrus&quot;″s hull was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, New London Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on 9 December 1952. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 June 1958 and she was sold incomplete for scrapping.

<text>The [[coat of arms]] of the city of Rybnik in Poland consists of a blue shield bearing a white pike rising diagonally between two floral patterns. The arms are an example of canting arms, since &quot;ryb&quot; means &quot;fish&quot;. This coat was adopted by the Rybnik City Council on November 20, 2000.

A formal blazon in English is: &quot;Azure, a pike bendwise between two floral patterns of a water-nut, all argent.&quot;

<text>A clear box is an amplifier used by phreaks to use post-pay pay phones without paying. In some locations, especially rural areas in the United States and Canada, pay phones were configured for &quot;post-pay&quot; operation. In this mode, the handset microphone is muted until payment is made. The user of a post-pay pay phone would dial first, wait until the called party answered, and at that point the user would be prompted to insert the coins. Upon receiving the correct payment for the call, the pay phone would then connect the microphone and allow the caller to speak. An artifact of this scheme was that the called party usually heard the ACTS tones produced by the pay phone upon coin deposit.

The clear box circumvented the handset mute by providing the phreak with another microphone, whose output is amplified and fed into an induction coil. The induction coil is then placed on the pay phone&#x27;s line or on its case near a sensitive circuit, introducing the caller&#x27;s voice via induction and bypassing the muted handset.

Several text files on the subject of the clear box observe that some calls, such as to time and weather services and other information lines, do not require voice input from the caller. On post-pay phones, calls to such numbers were effectively free without the use of a clear box.

The clear box has become obsolete with the widespread conversion of post-pay phones to pre-pay operation.

<text>The Ponderosa Ranch was a theme park based on the television western &quot;Bonanza&quot;, which housed the land, timber and livestock-rich Cartwright family. The amusement park operated in Incline Village, Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, from 1968 until 2004. Portions of the last five seasons of the TV series and three television films were also filmed at that location.

==Origins==
===TV origins of the fictional Ponderosa Ranch===

The Ponderosa was the fictional setting for &quot;Bonanza&quot;. According to the 9th episode (&quot;Mr. Henry Comstock&quot;) in the first season, it was a thousand-square mile (640,000 acre or 2,600 km2) ranch on the shores of Lake Tahoe, nestled high in the Sierra Nevada, with a large ranch house in the center of it. Ben Cartwright was said to have built the original, smaller homestead after moving from New Orleans with his pregnant third wife Marie and his two sons, Adam and Hoss. The grown Adam, an architect/engineer, designed the later sprawling ranch house as depicted on TV (&quot;Bonanza, The Philip Diedesheimer Story&quot;, Oct. 31, 1959, NBC-TV; &quot;Bonanza: The Return&quot;, April 1993, NBC-TV). The fictional ranch was roughly a two-hour horse ride from Virginia City, Nevada. (Note: There are slight variations as to the origin of the Ponderosa Ranch, from the original &quot;Bonanza&quot; series, Lorne Greene&#x27;s 1964 song &quot;Saga of the Ponderosa&quot;, the 1988–95 TV movies, and the 2001 PAX prequel series &quot;Ponderosa&quot;). The ranch house was a single-level structure that had a facade second storey. Inside, a staircase seemingly led to the second-floor corridor, but it was a dead end. The bedroom scenes were filmed at Burbank Studios. David Dortort, the show&#x27;s producer, said that the inspiration for the name was the large number of Ponderosa pines, which grow above 5,000 foot altitude, in the fictional ranch&#x27;s location. A Latin derivation would be &quot;large&quot; (root of the English word &quot;ponderous&quot;). The exteriors for the television show were occasionally shot in Nevada, usually out of sequence. Crews were sometimes able to complete an entire season&#x27;s work in just a few days.

The first Virginia City set used on the show from 1959–1970 was located on a back lot at Paramount. It was also used in episodes of &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot; and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. In the 1970 &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;The Night Virginia City Died&quot;, Deputy Clem Foster&#x27;s pyromaniac fiancée leveled the town in a series of fires. This allowed for a switch to the less-expensive Warner Studios from September 1970 through January 1973. Very few of the original &quot;Bonanza&quot; episodes were shot at the theme park&#x27;s Virginia City site, although the town was prominently featured in three &quot;Bonanza&quot; television movies. Because the movies showcased the next generation of Cartwrights, they began circa 1905. The Ponderosa park expanded beyond the buggy era to include an exhibit featuring antique cars. It was a fledgling endeavor as tourists wanted to see horses flanked by Cartwright saddles.

===Origins of the theme park===
The idea for the theme park came about in 1965. Bill and Joyce Anderson owned a small horse ranch, which was located in about the same area as the fictional Ponderosa on the burning map. According to the Andersons, tourists would regularly show up at their gates asking where the Ponderosa was. Smelling opportunity, the Andersons contacted NBC and &quot;Bonanza&quot; creator-producer David Dortort. They proposed turning their small ranch into a theme park. NBC, Dortort, and the cast saw the tie-in as a &quot;bonanza&quot; for everyone. All parties being of one accord, the cast agreed to promos being shot at the ranch site and the Virginia City set including the nearby Silver Dollar Saloon for financial consideration. The ads stimulated revenue for the park.

The park opened to the public in 1968, complete with a scale replica of the Cartwright ranch house and barn similar to the ones seen on television. A replica of Virginia City was later added. The original plan was to open the set to tourists once filming had wrapped. However, shuttling cast and crew up to Incline Village on a weekly basis became cost-prohibitive. Thus, only 15 episodes of &quot;Bonanza&quot; were shot there. A majority of ranch-specific scenes were shot on a sound stage at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Outdoor scenes were filmed on location at nearby Big Bear Lake, Red Rock Canyon, Mojave, or eastern Kern County, California. However, Michael Landon, Lorne Greene, Dan Blocker, and David Canary often made appearances at the ranch in costume to mingle with fans and sign autographs. Blocker died in 1972, and NBC canceled the series the following year. Canary, dressed in character as Candy, made his last visit there in 2002 for a PAX-TV special. Mitch Vogel (Jamie Cartwright) appeared at the ranch for the Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;TV Road Trip&quot; in 2002, in which he pitched a behind-the-scenes look at the Ponderosa Ranch and Incline Village. Copies of the &quot;Ponderosa Map&quot;, autographed by three of the Cartwrights, became souvenirs at the ranch for decades afterward, along with tin cups bearing their likenesses. Episodes that were filmed entirely or in part at the ranch bear a title plate at the end of the credits. These episodes are from the tenth season through the end of the series (1968–73).

==The Ponderosa experience==
Parking for visitors was at the highway level; only official vehicles, such as the park&#x27;s Conestoga wagons, were allowed at the top of the ridge, where the park was located. Depending on the time of day, a park visit could include breakfast. Lunch, including a &quot;Hoss Burger&quot;, could also be purchased. Estimates are that more than three million of these were sold during the park&#x27;s existence.

A visit to the park consisted of visitors riding up on the wagon, being &quot;robbed&quot; by &quot;outlaws&quot;, and then disembarking at the main house. Adjacent to the house were the &quot;graves&quot; of Ben Cartwright&#x27;s three wives, each of whom had given birth to one of the three (half) brothers. Graves of the Cartwrights and cook Hop Sing were later added, following the deaths of Dan Blocker (1972), Victor Sen Yung (1980), Lorne Greene (1987), and Michael Landon (1991). The house contained a less-than-realistic carved figure of Ben Cartwright sitting at his desk, and of Hop Sing working in the kitchen. The only parts of the house that actually existed were the living room, dining room, kitchen, and office. The stairs led nowhere, as the &quot;bedrooms&quot; were actually located on a sound stage in Hollywood. Thus, the tour of the house took very little time.

The main attraction was the ranch&#x27;s version of Virginia City, which was miles from the real Virginia City but immediately adjacent to the rear of the house set (on the show, the ranch was about a two-hour ride on horseback from Virginia City). There were activities such as a haunted house, panning for gold, amusements based on old-time Wild West shows, as well as concessions and souvenirs.

Only the front of the ranch house was ever shown on television because a highway ran directly to the right of the house. In episodes shot in-studio, the home exterior has a backdrop of sky and trees. The ranch house was a single-story structure, although from the outside it appeared to have a second story. Little Joe&#x27;s green corduroy jacket and Hoss&#x27;s brown suede vest were displayed hanging on a rack.

When the ranch opened in 1967, Pernell Roberts (Adam Cartwright) had long since departed the series. Consequently, he was not featured in Ponderosa&#x27;s promotional campaign until after the show&#x27;s initial run. At that time most of the shows broadcast in syndication featured the Adam Cartwright character. His picture was in the group painting on the sign promoting the park at the entrance. When the park folded in autumn 2004 Pernell Roberts was still alive, so no Adam grave marker was added. Pernell Roberts died on January 24, 2010.

Near the main house were sculptures of the horses ridden by Lorne Greene, Dan Blocker and Michael Landon that visitors could have their pictures taken either on or alongside of. The park also had a church that could be reserved for weddings near the church where the grave markers are located. In 1999, a VHS tour was made available to patrons. In 2002, David Canary appeared at the ranch in Candy&#x27;s wardrobe for a special produced by PAX TV.

==Closure==
The ranch and park remained a popular seasonal attraction for decades after the network run of &quot;Bonanza&quot; ended, having outlived most of the series&#x27; original cast. Business remained strong into the late 1990s. The land was purchased by billionaire software entrepreneur David Duffield in 2004. In September of that year he closed the Ponderosa &quot;indefinitely&quot;. In 2020, it was sold for 38m $ by Engel &amp; Völkers, Inc.

<doc id="1050651" wikidata="Q4530262" url="?curid=1050651" title="Ecological validity">
<text>In the behavioral sciences, ecological validity is often used to refer to the judgment of whether a given study&#x27;s variables and conclusions (often collected in lab) are sufficiently relevant to its population (e.g. the &quot;real world&quot; context). Psychological studies are usually conducted in laboratories though the goal of these studies is to understand human behavior in the real-world. Ideally, an experiment would have generalizable results that predict behavior outside of the lab, thus having more ecological validity. Ecological validity can be considered a commentary on the relative strength of a study&#x27;s implication(s) for policy, society, culture, etc.

This term was originally coined by Egon Brunswik and held a specific meaning. He regarded ecological validity as the utility of a perceptual cue to predict a property (basically how informative the cue is). For example, high school grades have moderate ecological validity for predicting college grades. Hammond argued that the now common use of the term to refer to generality of research results to the &quot;real world&quot; is inappropriate because it robs the original usage of its meaning.

Due to the evolving and broad definition of ecological validity, problematic usage of this term in modern scientific studies occurs because it is often not clearly defined. In fact, in many cases just being specific about what behavior/context you are testing makes addressing ecological validity unnecessary.

== Comparing ecological validity to mundane realism and external validity ==
The term &quot;ecological validity&quot; is now widely used by researchers unfamiliar with the origins and technical meaning of the term to be broadly equivalent to mundane realism. Mundane realism references the extent to which the experimental situation is similar to situations people are likely to encounter outside the laboratory. For example, mock-jury research is designed to study how people might act if they were jurors during a trial, but many mock-jury studies simply provide written transcripts or summaries of trials while in a classroom or office settings. Such experiments do not approximate the actual look, feel, and procedure of a real courtroom trial, and therefore lack mundane realism.

The better-recognized concern is that of external validity: if the results from such a mock-jury study are reproduced in and generalized across trials where these stimulus materials, settings, and other background characteristics vary, then the measurement process may be deemed externally valid. External validity refers to the ability to generalize study findings in other contexts. Ecological validity, the ability to generalize study findings to the real world, is a subcategory of external validity.  

Another example highlighting the differences between these terms is from an experiment that studied pointing—a trait originally attributed uniquely to humans—in captive chimpanzees. This study certainly had external validity because when testing if captive chimps will gesture towards food by pointing, the results were reproduced in different trials and under different conditions. Nevertheless, the ecological validity and mundane realism of this study came into question because researchers were attempting to do cognitive research while disrupting these animals’ natural environment.

Because the experimental conditions that are conducive to pointing (i.e. watching humans point) will never be experienced by chimpanzees outside the laboratory, this study is by definition lacking mundane realism. Furthermore, pointing doesn&#x27;t emerge in wild chimpanzees; therefore, one could argue that because captive chimps were taken out of their natural environment, there is no point in studying a trait that wasn&#x27;t adaptive through natural selection (holding no ecological validity). However, a counter-argument to this claim is that captive chimpanzees are under the ecological framework merely by existing. It is plausible that captivity is the context that leads to the development of this trait. Furthermore, if this trait can be taught to captive chimpanzees, it is certainly possible that if faced with particular circumstances, wild chimpanzees would also learn to point.

Thus, ecological validity is a sliding scale. Humans have dramatically changed the natural world to the extent that behavior traits that animals adapt in response to human intervention (such as pointing) could technically hold ecological validity. With this in mind, perhaps instead of attempting to broaden the definition of this term, a new term should be identified to define traits that have only emerged due to direct human interference.

<text>Recess is an American animated television series created by Paul Germain and Joe Ansolabehere (credited on marketing materials and late-series title cards as &quot;Paul and Joe&quot;) and produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, with animation done by Grimsaem, Anivision, Plus One Animation, Sunwoo Animation, and Toon City. The series focuses on six elementary school students and their interaction with other classmates and teachers. The title refers to the recess period during the daily schedule, in the North American tradition of educational schooling, when students are not in lessons and are outside in the schoolyard. During recess, the children form their own society, complete with government and a class structure, set against the backdrop of a regular school.

&quot;Recess&quot; premiered on September 13, 1997, on ABC, as part of Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning block (later known as ABC Kids). The series ended on November 5, 2001, with 65 half-hour episodes and six seasons in total. The success and lasting appeal of the series saw it being syndicated to numerous channels, including 
ABC&#x27;s sister channels Disney Channel and Toon Disney (which later became Disney XD).

In 2001, Walt Disney Pictures released a theatrical film based on the series, &quot;&quot;. It was followed by a direct-to-video second film entitled &quot;Recess Christmas: Miracle on Third Street&quot; that same year. In 2003, two more direct-to-video films were released: &quot;Recess: All Growed Down&quot; and &quot;Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade&quot;. The characters made their final appearance in a crossover episode for &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;.

==Overview==
&quot;Recess&quot; portrays the lives of six fourth graders—cheeky and popular lovable rogue Theodore Jasper &quot;T.J.&quot; Detweiler (Ross Malinger, Andrew Lawrence), jock Vince LaSalle (Rickey D&#x27;Shon Collins), tomboy Ashley Spinelli (Pamela Adlon), wise fool Mikey Blumberg (Jason Davis), nerdy child prodigy Gretchen Grundler (Ashley Johnson), and awkward new kid Gus Griswald (Courtland Mead)—as they go about their daily lives in a school environment at Third Street Elementary School. A major satirical point of the show is that the community of students at school is a microcosm of traditional human society complete with its own government, class system, and set of unwritten laws. They are ruled by a monarch, a sixth grader named King Bob, who has various enforcers to make sure his decrees are carried out. The society has a long list of rigid values and social norms that imposes a high expectation of conformity upon all the students.

&quot;Recess&quot; is illustrated to be a symbol of liberty—a time when children can express themselves and develop meaningful relationships. Most episodes involve one or more of the main six characters seeking a rational balance between individuality and social order. They are often defending their freedom against perceived threats by adults and school administration or social norms. The group&#x27;s leader, T.J. Detweiler, tends to have the most complete vision of this struggle, though even he has times when he inadvertently leads the group too far toward an extreme of conformity or non-conformity, and needs to be drawn back to even ground by his friends.

This interpretation is confirmed by the Cold War motifs found throughout the show. For example, Miss Grotke&#x27;s philosophical and activist attitudes (attributed to her belonging to the counterculture of the 1960s) are juxtaposed with the authoritarian and conservative views of her colleagues such as Miss Finster and Principal Prickly. The presence of government officials either confiscating objects for national security (Episode 37, &quot;The Substitute&quot;) or removing persons for challenging authority (Episode 71, &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Playground&quot;), serve as subtle reminders on the authority of the US government. Several references by the show&#x27;s characters convey the fraught political realities of the Cold War period. In Episode 85, &quot;Here Comes Mr. Perfect&quot;, Randall suggests blackmailing a student for being a supposed Communist, while in Episode 37, &quot;The Substitute&quot;, Mr. E demands a student write an essay on why it&#x27;s wrong to bully people, &quot;unless it&#x27;s in the geopolitical interests of the United States&quot;. Cold War themes are most seen in Episode 101, &quot;The Secret Life of Grotke&quot;, where Miss Grotke is suspected by the Recess gang as an anti-American spy due to her mysterious after-school life, as well as Episode 118, &quot;The Army Navy Game&quot;, where T.J. masquerades as a Soviet spy to bring Gus and Theresa&#x27;s military fathers to reconcile.

The show&#x27;s introductory music, art design and style often evoked the feel of prison escape movies such as &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, and the playground hierarchy and school administration were often depicted in ways that paid homage to common themes in such films.

==Cast and characters==
===Main characters===
* Theodore Jasper &quot;T.J.&quot; Detweiler Jr. (voiced by Ross Malinger, Seasons 1–2; Andrew Lawrence, Seasons 2–6): T.J. is the main protagonist of the series, the leader of his five best friends, and usually spends time planning pranks against the teachers. Rarely seen without his red baseball hat, which he always wears backwards, he uses his catchphrase &quot;whomps&quot; as a child-friendly substitute swear word for something unpleasant as well as &quot;tender&quot; whenever something good happens. While not excelling well in academics, T.J. has excellent leadership skills, confidence in public speaking, a quick wit and the ability to talk his way out of any situation, as shown in &quot;Good Ol&#x27; T.J.&quot;. Despite his precarious acts, T.J. is a hero, as he cares about the well-being of his fellow peers at school, often rallying them and convincing them to work together to stand up for their rights. His only sibling is an older sister (around 17 or 18) named Becky, who was seen in &quot;&quot; (voiced by Melissa Joan Hart) and &quot;Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade&quot; (voiced by Tara Strong), although T.J. mentions an older brother in &quot;The Great Jungle Gym Standoff&quot;. 
* Vincent &quot;Vince&quot; Pierre LaSalle (voiced by Rickey D&#x27;Shon Collins): Vince is the most physically fit student at Third Street School. Along with his superior athletic ability, he comes across as a bit of a &quot;Jock&quot;, but in the end he always knows to make the best choice to help others. His athletic/competitive skills are far superior, so much so that he seemingly excels at most, if not all, challenges, such as cooking, golf, and even improvised playground games. He has a rivalry with Erwin Lawson, a fifth grade jock bully. He has an older brother named Chad whom he thinks is the coolest boy he knows, even if his peers see him as a geek. His catchphrase is &quot;Whompinbobyulah!&quot; to exclaim surprise. Respected and brave, he is T.J.&#x27;s right-hand man. 
* Ashley Funicello Spinelli (voiced by Pamela Adlon): Usually going simply by her last name, Spinelli is a wrestling fan and the tomboy of the group. Although short in stature for her age, she maintains a powerful tough-girl image, often attempting to solve her problems via violence. During the gang&#x27;s misadventures, Spinelli is the one who gets reluctant kids to talk, usually by threatening or intimidating them during interrogation. With her reputation, a lot of Spinelli&#x27;s problems happen when she is shown to have a weakness, as she prefers to be unflappable and strong-willed. While she doesn&#x27;t dislike her first name since she was named after her great aunt, the first woman to win the Iditarod Sled Race, she keeps it hidden to avoid being associated with &quot;the Ashleys&quot;, the school&#x27;s clique of snobby girls. She has a talent for art, though she claims she &quot;only does it to blow off steam&quot;. Her fiery and fearless personality has gotten on the good side of Miss Finster multiple times as well as her bad side. It is revealed on Parent-Teacher Night, by Spinelli&#x27;s mother, that Spinelli has a crush on T.J.
* Gretchen Priscilla Grundler (voiced by Ashley Johnson): Gretchen is an academically gifted and an extremely intelligent student. A child prodigy, she has shown the ability for academic feats that other students in her grade find difficult. She is still a young kid at heart and her imagination sometimes overwhelms her, as she is quite naive despite her high IQ. She is assisted by an interactive, calculator-sized, hand-held computer-like machine called Galileo (voiced by Eric Idle), which she is very protective of. Though her friends don&#x27;t share her passion for science, Gretchen considers the gang much more important than finding intellectual colleagues. She also has a unique talent with yo-yos. She was called &quot;the doughy queen of beauty&quot; by Frank &quot;Tiny&quot; Sedgwick in &quot;Lord of the Nerds&quot;.
* Michael &quot;Mikey&quot; Blumberg (voiced by Jason Davis; singing voiced by Robert Goulet): Mikey is an overweight, kind-hearted, and philosophical nine-year-old. He is good at playing goalie in soccer due to his towering height and body power. He writes poetry, performs ballet, and believes in notions of peace that the others often dismiss. Though known as a &quot;sweet-souled giant&quot;, he is also an incredibly talented singer, possessing a baritone opera voice that contrasts starkly with his normal speaking voice.
* Gustav Patton &quot;Gus&quot; Griswald (voiced by Courtland Mead): Gus is a new student at Third Street Elementary with a blonde crew cut; though absent in the first episode, he was introduced in the following episode as &quot;The New Kid&quot;. Gus is usually oblivious to the rules of the playground and its traditions, as he comes from a military family and therefore has had to move around frequently (he has attended 12 schools in six years but according to the movie/episode &quot;&quot;, he briefly attended Third Street School for a few days in kindergarten, prior to his return for fourth grade). Although normally shy and meek, he has great leadership abilities similar to T.J.&#x27;s when faced with danger. He is exceptionally skilled in dodgeball, and was once feared at Jesse James Elementary School, a previous school of his, as &quot;El Diablo&quot;; however, as shown in &quot;Dodgeball City&quot;, when he accidentally hit a little boy hard in the face, greatly traumatizing the kid, he stopped playing it in shame. In this same episode, he shows he doesn&#x27;t care for marbles, either because of dodgeball or dislike. Gus is both brave and swallows his pride when he addresses certain situations. Even though everyone sees him as a pushover, he has repeatedly proven otherwise; for instance, he stood up to Gelman (The School Bully) in &quot;Gus&#x27; Last Stand&quot;, and in &quot;All Grown Down&quot;, it was revealed that during his brief tenure at Third Street as a kindergartner, he helped overthrow Randall&#x27;s manipulation of Mikey (who believed he was being taunted), which was confirmed by Finster apparently bearing a grudge towards him at the end of the film.

===School staff===
*Muriel Periwinkle Finster (voiced by April Winchell): Miss Finster is an elderly assistant teacher who monitors the students during lunch, recess, and in the halls. She is an assertive authoritarian feared by the students, and seeks to keep them in line and maintain order, with her assistant Randall Weems reporting to her on any wrongdoing. She was a Navy commodore in the 1950s, frequently reminiscing her time in Guam, and has worked at Third Street since the 1960s. Though she is often at odds with the students, Finster has been shown to genuinely care about their safety. In a few of the series&#x27; episodes and in the film &quot;Recess: School&#x27;s Out&quot;, she is revealed as having been attractive and popular when she was young but eventually became a strict, grouchy and fussy figure as she grew older. She becomes the gang&#x27;s fifth grade teacher in the film &quot;Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade&quot;. In the film &quot;Recess: All Growed Down&quot; it is revealed that she was the gang&#x27;s kindergarten teacher and she was initially pleasant but became hot-tempered and intimidating after seeing her kindergarten students all messy and having fun during recess. In &quot;That Stinking Feeling.&quot; it is implied that she was once in a relationship with someone when she was younger, as, she says to Spinelli that, &quot;even if he does leave you in Paris with no money and a broken axel on the VW the end, love is all worth it despite the fact that she will end up having feelings that will want to make her stand on a rooftop and yell to the heaven and crawl into a hole and pull off her skin.&quot; 
*Principal Peter Prickly (voiced by Dabney Coleman): Principal Prickly is the principal of Third Street School. A former student at the school, he became a teacher out of a desire to help children and has been principal of Third Street since 1968. He is frequently angered by the children&#x27;s antics, and ultimately seeks to become principal of a middle school. He has a strong rivalry with his older brother Paul, who is also a school principal. While frequently portrayed as a heartless authority figure, Prickly has been shown to have a more friendly, laid-back personality and ultimately tries to protect the student&#x27;s welfare. He is also a secret fan of Señor Fusion, a comic book hero.
*Miss Alordayne Grotke (voiced by Allyce Beasley) is the 4th grade teacher of the main cast. She is known for her mild-mannered, yet eccentric personality, basically being that of a hippie, including her vocabulary. She is well loved by her students, especially for her tendency to stick up for their rights and encourages them to express themselves. Her dialogue establishes her as an advocate for the environment and race/gender rights. She also moonlights as a magician.

===School students===
*Randall J. Weems (voiced by Ryan O&#x27;Donohue) is a fourth grade student at the school. His hair cut and color (a reddish/brown perm curly style) resembles his father&#x27;s. Well known as the playground snitch, informing Miss Finster of any playground misbehavior, he is consequently disliked on the playground but will ally with his classmates if the situation calls for it. In &quot;All Grown Down&quot; it is revealed he hatched a plan to get Mikey on his side by gossiping about the other kids to Mikey. Mikey assumes this is true and believes that the other kids are making fun of him. However, Gus destroys his plans before he could succeed in possibly becoming king in 6th grade.
*Erwin Lawson (voiced by Erik von Detten) is a fifth grader. He is primarily a bully to the younger students and serves as a rival to Vince and T.J. at various sports and games. He is portrayed as unintelligent. In the episode &quot;Nobody Doesn&#x27;t Like TJ&quot; Lawson can even admit that TJ&#x27;s still a pretty alright guy.
*King Robert &quot;Bob&quot; (voiced by Toran Caudell) is a sixth grader and the &quot;King of the Playground&quot;. He enforces the unwritten rules of the playground established by other previous playground kings and acts as the primary authority of playground disputes. He was previously a renowned playground prankster, holding the title of &quot;Prankster Prince&quot; before becoming King. He has bequeathed the title to T.J. He is also incredibly respectful and reminiscent of previous playground kings, which can be seen in episodes such as &quot;Pharaoh Bob&quot; and &quot;The Rules&quot;. In the &#x27;School&#x27;s Out&#x27; movie, upon leaving the school and graduating to the seventh grade, he passes the role as &#x27;King&#x27; onto a boy named Freddy.
*The Ashleys are a group of four girls (Ashley Armbruster (voiced by Anndi McAfee), Boulet (voiced by Francesca Marie Smith), Quinlan (voiced by Rachel Crane), and Tomassian (voiced by Camille Winbush)) who usually go by Ashley A, B, Q, and T respectively. The girls, while usually acting like the stereotypical popular girl clique, including being well-off and obsessing with fashion and beauty, often put down others either verbally or through a variety of underhanded schemes, resulting in them being seldom popular with anybody except during their occasional moments of kindness. They are even ostracized by many of their classmates (though they do maintain an air of superiority). They have a mutual despisement with Spinelli, due mainly to her first name being Ashley and her outright refusal to join their group as well as her frequent hostility towards them. Their catchphrase is saying &quot;ooh, scandalous!&quot; as well as constantly using the preposition &quot;like&quot; in unison. They each have a little brother named Tyler who are collectively known as &quot;The Tylers&quot;, and a little sister named Brittany who are collectively known as &quot;The Brittanys&quot;. The Ashleys are probably based on the titular characters from the 1988 film &quot;Heathers&quot;, though their fashion obsessions and mannerisms seem to be based on the main characters from the 1995 film &quot;Clueless&quot;.
*Hustler Kid (voiced by Michael Shulman) is the playground&#x27;s supplier of contraband goods and other hard to get merchandise for the right price. In &quot;Hustler&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, he is revealed to be part of an association of hustlers from every school and his real name is revealed to be Francis.
*Guru Kid (voiced by Klee Bragger and Ross Malinger in the series, and Ryan O&#x27;Donohue in &quot;&quot;) is the source of spiritual advice for the other students. He always sits in a meditative pose with his shirt wrapped around his head like a turban.
*Swinger Girl (voiced by Francesca Marie Smith) is, as her name suggests, a girl who is always at the swing set and whose ultimate goal is to swing over the top of the swing set. She dresses like a WWII fighter pilot.
*Upside Down Girl (voiced by Francesca Marie Smith) spends her time hanging upside down from the jungle gym. In &quot;The Great Jungle Gym Standoff&quot; it is revealed her real name is Laura Jameson.
*Menlo (voiced by Blake McIver Ewing) is a student who works as an office aide to the school secretary Miss Lemon and is obsessed with organization. He was once good friends with T.J. before they drifted apart, but T.J. still attends Menlo&#x27;s birthday parties in honor of that friendship.
*Megan (voiced by Pamela Adlon in &quot;The New Kid&quot;, Kath Soucie in &quot;Call Me Guy&quot;, Anndi McAfee in &quot;The Candidates&quot;, and Danielle Judovits in Recess: School&#x27;s Out), a girl with brown hair in pigtails, and wears a red jacket (like T.J.) appears as a background character, though occasionally speaks. Not much is known about her, but she is seen hanging with several other background girls.
*The Diggers (voiced by Ryan O&#x27;Donohue and Klee Bragger) are a pair of kids who spend their time at recess digging holes in the dirt and are dressed as miners. One is named Dave and the other is named Sam, and despite looking alike they aren&#x27;t related.
*Kristen Kurst (voiced by Mayim Bialik), &quot;Kurst the Worst&quot;, is a gluttonous and messy fifth grade girl bully who often times can be found stealing food from the cafeteria. She once befriended Mikey over their shared love of desserts.
*Cornchip Girl (voiced by Anndi McAfee, Francesca Marie Smith, Ashley Johnson, Elizabeth Daily, and Aria Curzon), whose real name is Theresa Laverne LaMaise, is a sweet and polite little girl in the first grade, known for throwing corn chips to mark the arrival of King Bob at events, as well as collecting interesting looking corn chips. Her father is in the Navy.
*Butch (voiced by Kath Soucie) is a fifth grade boy who often times pops up to tell the kids about bad experiences, with T.J. almost always prompting Butch&#x27;s stories with the words, &quot;What&#x27;re you talking about, Butch?&quot;. He wears a leather jacket and has a white streak in his hair.
*Gelman (voiced by Justin Shenkarow) is the school bully, and picks on kids that are smaller than him (most notably Gus). Gelman is overweight, lazy and mean; he normally sports a black T-shirt, dark gray pants and light brown hair.
*Singing Kid (voiced by Michael Shulman), real name Brandon, is the school&#x27;s official singer. He usually sings everything rather than regular speaking.

== Production ==
&quot;Recess&quot; first aired on ABC on August 31, 1997, as a &quot;sneak preview&quot;, after which it transitioned to ABC&#x27;s Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning programming block, premiering on September 13, 1997. The series&#x27; success spawned three direct-to-video titles &quot;Recess&quot; Trilogy: &quot;Recess Christmas: Miracle on Third Street&quot; in 2001, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; in 2003; and one theatrical film, &quot;&quot;, which was released on February 16, 2001. The series ended on November 5, 2001; reruns continued to air on UPN until 2003 and ABC until 2004.

Disney Channel added &quot;Recess&quot; to their lineup on September 3, 2003. &quot;Fillmore!&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot;, and &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot; were all pre-empted in favor of a 90-minute showing of the series. It temporarily ceased airing on September 2, 2005, but resumed on August 26, 2008 replacing &quot;The Buzz on Maggie&quot;, and continued until June 30, 2010.

Toon Disney aired the show from September 3, 2003 to February 12, 2009. When Toon Disney was converted to Disney XD, the series was carried over and aired from April 14, 2009 to October 27, 2011.

The creators were credited by their first names only due to concerns by Disney to not put their full names on the series as not to overshadow Walt Disney&#x27;s name.

Disaster strikes when Dr. Hämsterviel and his henchman, Gantu, try to use an escaped alien experiment to make everyone relaxed while he takes over the world. Luckily, Gretchen saves the day, since she believes work is relaxing.

== Critical reception ==
Television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz wrote favorably about &quot;Recess&quot; in their 2016 book &quot;TV (The Book)&quot;, stating that the series is &quot;Easily one of the smartest, most prankishly playful adult cartoons ever passed off as children&#x27;s entertainment... &quot;Recess&quot; is a highly ritualized bit of entertainment that strikes the same notes over and over again, but always in infinite variation and with a surprising eye for psychological grace notes, especially when characters you thought of as brusque and one-dimensional reveal their fears and dreams to one another.&quot;

==Possible revival==
In 2022, Joe Ansolabehere revealed that he and Paul Germain had been working on a potential revival stating, &quot;We&#x27;ve come up with several different angles and we&#x27;ve tried different things. It&#x27;s been four years that we&#x27;ve been working on it, but that&#x27;s an example of how things have changed... things are slower.&quot;

<text>Birchen Edge is a gritstone rock face in the Peak District, England, popular with walkers and novice climbers as most of the climbing routes are in the lower grade.

==Walking==
Birchen Edge provides an easy high-level walk with views over the nearby village of Baslow and part of the Chatsworth House estate. The edge is backed by a moorland plateau. Access is via a public footpath from the Robin Hood Inn on the A619 road, about from Chesterfield. Nearby Gardom&#x27;s Edge and Blackstone Edge may be incorporated into a circular walk. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs along the edge past Nelson&#x27;s Monument.

==Nelson&#x27;s Monument==
The monument consists of a 3-metre gritstone column with a 30 cm ball on top. It was erected in 1810 by a local businessman from Baslow called John Brightman, in honour of Lord Nelson and was restored in 1992 by the 1805 Club. Three nearby outcrops called the &quot;Ship Rocks&quot; have been carved with the names of three of Nelson&#x27;s ships: &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Defiance&quot; and &quot;Royal Soverin&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;).

==Climbing==
There are generally good belays to be found at the tops although there are a couple of areas such as Stoker&#x27;s Wall where it can be tricky. The starts can also be quite awkward where the crag is undercut. Classic routes include The Crow&#x27;s Nest (climbing grade VS), Nelson&#x27;s Slab (HVS), Sail Buttress (VS), Sail Chimney (S), Topsail (VS), Orpheus Wall (HVS), Peaches (E4), Trafalgar Crack (V Diff), Camperdown Crawl (VS) and Powder Monkey Parade (S – but do not underestimate it).

It was also the titular inspiration for the recently built Birchen Apartments at Sheffield University.

<doc id="1050685" wikidata="Q119421" url="?curid=1050685" title="Nicholson Street">
<text>Nicholson Street is a street in inner Melbourne. It is named after William Nicholson, who is remembered as the &quot;father of the ballot&quot;. He was also a member of the Legislative Council, and later became Premier of Victoria (from 1859-1860).

==Geography==

Nicholson Street runs north-south through inner northern Melbourne. At its southernmost end, it connects to Spring Street near Bourke Street. Between Victoria Parade and Alexandra Parade, it forms the boundary between Carlton and Fitzroy; between Alexandra Parade and Brunswick Road, it forms the boundary between Carlton North and Fitzroy North; north of Brunswick Road, its remaining length is in Brunswick East. Nicholson Street merges into Albion Street, Brunswick East, just north of its intersection with Blyth Street.

Nicholson Street, Brunswick East, is often confused with nearby Nicholson Street, Coburg, which also runs north to south. Nicholson Street, Coburg, is a continuation of Holmes Street, which is a continuation of Lygon Street; itself not to be confused with the much smaller Lygon Street in Coburg.

==Route==
Nicholson Street runs from Spring Street in the city, and heads in a north-northeasterly direction for approximately 5 km, before it runs through a series of 3 bends for 500m before merging into Albion Street in Brunswick East, to the north.

Tram route 96 runs along virtually the entire length of the street, entering from Spring Street at the city end and terminating at Blyth Street, just a few hundred metres short of the street&#x27;s end.

==History==
Nicholson Street was built in 1854 to provide a road from Melbourne to the stone quarries of Brunswick East. It initially ended at Brunswick Road. Residents to the north of Brunswick Road had to travel west to Sydney Road in order to travel into Melbourne, adding several miles to the journey. These residents began a public campaign to have Nicholson Street extended to the north. Two land owners sold their land at inflated prices in order for the extension to go ahead, which happened in 1868.

Nicholson Street has been known by several names. It was originally known as West Government Road. Also, one section of Nicholson Street between Spring Street and Victoria Parade was originally known as Evelyn Street. 

In 2013, Public Transport Victoria proposed changed traffic conditions to much of the street by enforcing dedicated tram lanes along the length of Route 96, which would result in the removal of all on-street parking in favour of through traffic lanes and less delays for trams.

==Landmarks==
Several Melbourne landmarks are located on Nicholson Street, including Parliament House and the Princess Theatre at its southern terminus. Just to the north lie the Royal Exhibition Building and the Melbourne Museum, both in Carlton Gardens, and St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital. Melbourne&#x27;s oldest complete row of terraced house, known as Royal Terrace, is located at 50-68 in Fitzroy. Further north in Brunswick East, at the corner of Blyth Street, Melbourne alternative radio station 3RRR makes its home.

<text>UK Records was a music label launched in 1972 by Jonathan King to distribute his own releases and those by some other artists. The abbreviation UK stands for &quot;United King&quot;. The label was distributed at first by Decca Records and, after 1976, by PolyGram (which later bought out Decca in 1980).

When the label was established, its UK operations were first run by Chris Denning, then by former DJ Don Wardell and by John Peel&#x27;s Dandelion Records chief, Clive Selwood. Its releases included UK singles chart hits for Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs (fronted by Jona Lewie), 10cc, and Shag, a pseudonym used by King himself. The label&#x27;s only UK no.1 record was 10cc&#x27;s &quot;Rubber Bullets&quot;; eight of the band&#x27;s singles were released by the label. The UK label also released successful singles by the First Class, Carl Malcolm, Kevin Johnson, Roy C, Lobo, and by Jonathan King himself, as well as recording Freddie Garrity and the Kursaal Flyers among others. Successful albums included two by 10cc (&quot;10cc&quot; and &quot;Sheet Music&quot;), as well as the King-produced Original London Stage Soundtrack of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;.

The label was dissolved in the 1970s.

<text>Lençóis Paulista is a municipality in the Central West region of the state of São Paulo. The population is 68,990 (2020 est.) in an area of 810 km². The elevation is 550 m.

It is home of the largest library in the interior of the State of São Paulo, an institution of higher learning, and a SENAI technical school.

==History==
The city was founded on April 28, 1858. It was originally named &quot;Lençóis&quot;, but a 1940s&#x27; decree by then Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas determined that there could be no homonymous cities in Brazil, and since there was already an older city called Lençóis (in Bahia state), the city was renamed Lençóis Paulista. The original proposal was to rename it Ubirama, but the population wanted to keep the original name.

==Geography==
The territory is drained by waters of the Lençóis River, which is also the source responsible for the water supply of the city. The climate is subtropical, with maximum temperatures around 38 °C between November and February, and minimum temperatures around 4 °C between June and August.

The neighboring municipalities of Lençóis Paulista are Macatuba, Pederneiras and Agudos to the north; Borebi to the west; Avaré and Botucatu to the south; and Pratânia, Areiópolis and São Manuel to the east.

==Economy==
The economic foundation of the city is its industry, which highlights its production of sugar, alcohol, cellulose, oil, metal structures, renewable energy and food. Its main agricultural products are sugar cane, corn, beans, and wood. The city&#x27;s commerce, which for many years was subordinate to the neighboring city of Bauru, today is passing through a period of expansion with the building of the Lençóis Paulista Shopping.

The municipality has a Commercial and Industrial Association, the ACILPA, which develops work in partnership with SEBRAE, SENAI and the municipal government. It has the second highest GDP of the Administrative Region of Bauru, and has become the central hub of a commercial micro-region that includes the municipalities of Macatuba, Areiópolis, Borebi and Pederneiras. The city has a mall and an annual industrial trade fair called the FACILPA.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1050701" wikidata="Q1188570" url="?curid=1050701" title="Gunbai">
<text>The is a type of signal baton and Japanese war fan. Once held by military leaders (such as daimyō) and priests in the past, it is used in the modern day by umpires in sumo wrestling.

==Description==
&quot;Gunbai&quot;, from the Sino-Japanese roots meaning &quot;military-apportioned [fan]&quot;, were a specialized form of fan used by samurai officers in Japan to communicate commands to their troops. Unlike regular fans, &quot;gunbai&quot; were solid, not folding, and usually made of wood, wood covered with metal, or solid metal.
It is also a key accessory of a &quot;gyōji&quot; (referee) in professional sumo. The main use is at the end of a bout, when the &quot;gyoji&quot; decides the victor and points the &quot;gunbai&quot; to either the east or west position (each wrestler is assigned to start from either the east or west position each tournament day). Reflecting this, the gyōji&#x27;s decision itself is often informally referred to as a &quot;gunbai&quot;. If this is called into question and the judges hold a consultation, a decision to uphold the gyōji&#x27;s judgement is announced as &quot;gunbai-dōri&quot; (軍配通り), literally &quot;according to the &quot;gunbai&quot;, while a decision to overturn it is &quot;gunbai-sashichigae&quot; (軍配差し違え), literally &quot;gunbai&quot; mispointed&quot;. In modern times, all &quot;gyōji&quot; will take either the family name &quot;Kimura&quot; or &quot;Shikimori&quot; as their professional name, depending on the tradition of the stable that they join. There are exceptions to this naming convention, but they are rare. Additionally, there are different styles to how a &quot;gyōji&quot; will hold his &quot;gunbai&quot; depending on which family he is in. The Kimura family hold their &quot;gunbai&quot; with their palm and fingers faced up, while the Shikimori will hold theirs with their palm and fingers faced down.

==Family crest (Mon)==
The &quot;Gunbai-Uchiwa&quot;, along with the &quot;Touchiwa&quot; (&quot;Karauchiwa&quot;), is also used as a &quot;Mon&quot; (family crest).

<doc id="1050705" wikidata="Q510092" url="?curid=1050705" title="Uni Records">
<text>Uni Records (short for the label&#x27;s legal name Universal City Records and rendered as UNI) was a record label owned by MCA Inc. The brand, which long featured a distinctive UNi logo, was established in 1966 by MCA executive Ned Tanen and developed by music industry veteran Russ Regan. Notable artists on Uni included Strawberry Alarm Clock, the Foundations, Hugh Masekela, Brian Hyland, Desmond Dekker, Bill Cosby, Elton John, Neil Diamond, Dave and Ansil Collins, Fever Tree, Olivia Newton-John, Betty Everett, and the Factory (Lowell George, Dallas Taylor, et al.). In 1967, Uni took over management of MCA&#x27;s newly acquired Kapp Records. Uni also operated [[Revue Records]], a soul music subsidiary, from about 1967 to 1970. In 1971 Uni was merged with Kapp and the co-owned American Decca Records, to form MCA Records. The Decca, Kapp, and Uni labels continued to be used for new releases for a short time, but in late 1972, new releases by their former artists began appearing on the MCA Records label; before long, their back catalogs were transferred to MCA as well. That year, Regan left MCA to revive 20th Century Records for 20th Century Fox.

In 1988, Uni was briefly revived by MCA Records as a niche hipster label, à la Sire Records, with a roster that included Transvision Vamp, Big Bam Boo, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Swans, Steve Earle, Lord Tracy and a distribution deal with the Bronx-based hip hop label Strong City Records. By the end of 1989, however, Swans was dropped, the deal with Strong City was terminated, and the others were absorbed by the MCA label.

On November 13, 1990, MCA revamped the Uni moniker once more when it changed the name of its music distribution network from MCA Music Distribution Corp to Uni Distribution Corp. In 1996, in the wake of Seagram&#x27;s purchase of MCA and the merger of the MCA and PolyGram families of labels, it was renamed Universal Music &amp; Video Distribution Inc. In June 2001, it was renamed Universal Music &amp; Video Distribution Corp., and it was changed again in 2006, after the sale of Universal Pictures to NBC, to Universal Music Distribution. Geffen Records manages the Uni catalog today after absorbing the MCA label in 2003.

==Label variations==
*1967–1973: Mustard yellow label with lime green, blue, and magenta swirls, followed by lime green colored Uni logo in yellow swirl and another lime green swirl. Many albums during this run were also pressed with custom labels.
*1988–1989: Blue label with Uni logo in black at top.

<doc id="1050706" wikidata="Q721657" url="?curid=1050706" title="Gundestrup cauldron">
<text>The Gundestrup cauldron is a richly decorated silver vessel, thought to date from between 200 BC and 300 AD, or more narrowly between 150 BC and 1 BC. This places it within the late La Tène period or early Roman Iron Age. The cauldron is the largest known example of European Iron Age silver work (diameter: ; height: ). It was found dismantled, with the other pieces stacked inside the base, in 1891, in a peat bog near the hamlet of Gundestrup in the Aars parish of Himmerland, Denmark (). It is now usually on display in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, with replicas at other museums; it was in the UK on a travelling exhibition called &quot;The Celts&quot; during 2015–2016.

The cauldron is not complete, and now consists of a rounded cup-shaped bottom making up the lower part of the cauldron, usually called the base plate, above which are five interior plates and seven exterior ones; a missing eighth exterior plate would be needed to encircle the cauldron, and only two sections of a rounded rim at the top of the cauldron survive. The base plate is mostly smooth and undecorated inside and out, apart from a decorated round medallion in the centre of the interior. All the other plates are heavily decorated with repoussé work, hammered from beneath to push out the silver. Other techniques were used to add detail, and there is extensive gilding and some use of inlaid pieces of glass for the eyes of figures. Other pieces of fittings were found. Altogether it weighs just under .

While the vessel was found in Denmark, it was probably not made there or nearby; it includes elements of Gaulish and Thracian origin in the workmanship, metallurgy, and imagery. The techniques and elements of the style of the panels relate closely to other Thracian silver, while much of the depiction, in particular of the human figures, relates to the Celts, though attempts to relate the scenes closely to Celtic mythology remain controversial. Other aspects of the iconography derive from the Near East.

Hospitality on a large scale was probably an obligation for Celtic elites, and although cauldrons were therefore an important item of prestige metalwork, they are usually much plainer and smaller than this. This is an exceptionally large and elaborate object with no close parallel, except a large fragment from a bronze cauldron also found in Denmark, at Rynkeby; however the exceptional wetland deposits in Scandinavia have produced a number of objects of types that were probably once common but where other examples have not survived. It has been much discussed by scholars, and represents a fascinatingly complex demonstration of the many cross-currents in European art, as well as an unusual degree of narrative for Celtic art, though we are unlikely ever to fully understand its original meanings.

==Discovery==
The Gundestrup cauldron was discovered by peat cutters in a small peat bog called &quot;Rævemose&quot; (near the larger &quot;Borremose&quot; bog) on 28 May 1891. The Danish government paid a large reward to the finders, who subsequently quarreled bitterly amongst themselves over its division. Palaeobotanical investigations of the peat bog at the time of the discovery showed that the land had been dry when the cauldron was deposited, and the peat gradually grew over it. The manner of stacking suggested an attempt to make the cauldron inconspicuous and well-hidden. Another investigation of Rævemose was undertaken in 2002, concluding that the peat bog may have existed when the cauldron was buried.

The cauldron was found in a dismantled state with five long rectangular plates, seven short plates, one round plate (normally called the &quot;base plate&quot;), and two fragments of tubing stacked inside the curved base.
In addition, there is a piece of iron from a ring originally placed inside the silver tubes along the rim of the cauldron. It is assumed that an eighth short plate is missing because the circumference of the seven outer plates is smaller than the circumference of the five inner plates.

A set of careful full-size replicas have been made. One is in the National Museum of Ireland,
and several are in France, including the Musée gallo-romain de Fourvière at Lyon and the Musée d&#x27;archéologie nationale at Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

==Reconstruction==
Since the cauldron was found in pieces, it had to be reconstructed. The traditional order of the plates was determined by Sophus Müller, the first of many to analyze the cauldron. His logic uses the positions of the trace solder located at the rim of the bowl. In two cases, a puncture mark penetrating the inner and outer plates also helps to establish the order. In its final form, the plates are arranged in an alternation of female-male depictions, assuming the missing eighth plate is of a female.

Not all analysts agree with Müller&#x27;s ordering, however. Taylor has pointed out that aside from the two cases of puncturing, the order cannot be determined from the solder alignments. His argument is that the plates are not directly adjacent to each other, but are separated by a 2 cm gap; thus, the plates in this order cannot be read with certainty as the true narrative, supposing one exists. However, Larsen indicates, not only did his study vindicate the order for the inner plates established, by Muller, Klindt-Jensen, and Olmsted, but the order of the outer plates is also established by the rivet holes, the solder alignments, and the scrape marks.

==Metallurgy==
The Gundestrup cauldron is composed almost entirely of silver, but there is also a substantial amount of gold for the gilding, tin for the solder and glass for the figures&#x27; eyes. According to experimental evidence, the materials for the vessel were not added at the same time, so the cauldron can be considered as the work of artisans over a span of several hundred years. The quality of the repairs to the cauldron, of which there are many, is inferior to the original craftsmanship.

Silver was not a common material in Celtic art, and certainly not on this scale. Except sometimes for small pieces of jewellery, gold or bronze were more usual for prestige metalwork. At the time that the Gundestrup cauldron was created, silver was obtained through cupellation of lead / silver ores.

From comparisons of the concentration of lead isotopes with the silver work by other cultures, it seems that the silver came from multiple ore deposits, mostly from Celtic northern France and western Germany in the pre-Roman period. Lead isotope studies also indicate that the silver for manufacturing the plates was prepared by repeatedly melting ingots and/or scrap silver. Three to six distinct batches of recycled silver may have been used in making the vessel. Specifically, the circular &quot;base plate&quot; may have originated as a phalera, and it is commonly thought to have been positioned in the bottom of the bowl as a late addition, soldered in to repair a hole. By an alternative theory, this phalera was not initially part of the bowl, but instead formed part of the decorations of a wooden cover.

The gold can be sorted into two groups based on purity and separated by the concentration of silver and copper. The less pure gilding, which is thicker, can be considered a later repair, as the thinner, purer inlay adheres better to the silver. The adherence of the overall gold is quite poor. The lack of mercury from the gold analysis suggests that a fire-gilding technique was not used on the Gundestrup cauldron. The gilding appears to have instead been made by mechanical means, which explains the function of closely spaced punch marks on the gilded areas.

An examination of lead isotopes similar to the one used on the silver was employed for the tin. All of the samples of tin soldering are consistent in lead-isotope composition with ingots from Cornwall in western Britain. The tin used for soldering the plates and bowl together, as well as the glass eyes, is very uniform in its high purity.

Finally, the glass inlays of the Gundestrup cauldron have been determined through the use of X-ray fluorescence radiation to be of a soda-lime type composition. The glass contained elements that can be attributed to calcareous sand and mineral soda, typical of the east coast of the Mediterranean region. The analyses also narrowed down the production time of the glass to between the second century BC and first century AD.

==Flow of raw material==

The workflow of the manufacturing process consisted of a few steps that required a great amount of skill. Batches of silver were melted in crucibles with the addition of copper for a subtler alloy. The melted silver was cast into flat ingots and hammered into intermediate plates.

For the relief work, the sheet-silver was annealed to allow shapes to be beaten into high repoussé; these rough shapes were then filled with pitch from the back to make them firm enough for further detailing with punches and tracers. The pitch was melted out, areas of pattern were gilded, and the eyes of the larger figures were inlaid with glass. The plates were probably worked in a flat form and later bent into curves to solder them together.

It is generally agreed that the Gundestrup cauldron was the work of multiple silversmiths. Using scanning electron microscopy, Benner Larson has identified 15 different punches used on the plates, falling into three distinct tool sets. No individual plate has marks from more than one of these groups, and this fits with previous attempts at stylistic attribution, which identify at least three different silversmiths. Multiple artisans would also explain the highly variable purity and thickness of the silver.

==Origins==

The silverworking techniques used in the cauldron are unknown from the Celtic world, but are consistent with the renowned Thracian sheet-silver tradition. The scenes depicted are not distinctively Thracian, but certain elements of composition, decorative motifs, and illustrated items (such as the shoelaces on the antlered figure) identify it as Thracian work.

Taylor and Bergquist have postulated that the Celtic tribe known as the Scordisci commissioned the cauldron from native Thracian silversmiths. According to classical historians, the Cimbri, a Teutonic tribe, went south from the lower Elbe region and attacked the Scordisci in 118 BC. After withstanding several defeats at the hands of the Romans, the Cimbri retreated north, possibly taking with them this cauldron to settle in Himmerland, where the vessel was found.

According to the art style of the Gundestrup cauldron is that utilized in Armorican coinage dating to as exemplified in the billon coins of the Coriosolites. This art style is unique to northwest Gaul and is largely confined to the region between the Seine and the Loire, a region in which, according to Caesar, the wealthy sea-faring Veneti played a dominant and hegemonic role. Agreeing with this area of production, determined by the art style, is the fact that the
: &quot;lead isotope compositions of the [Gundestrup] cauldron plates&quot; [mostly included] &quot;the same silver as used in northern France for the Coriosolite coins&quot;.
Not only does the Gundestrup cauldron enlighten us about this coin-driven art style, where the larger-metalwork smiths were also the mint-masters producing the coins, but the cauldron also portrays cultural items, such as swords, armor, and shields, found and produced in this same cultural area, confirming the agreement between art style and metal analysis. If as and suggest, the Veneti also produced the silver phalerae, found on the Isle of Sark, as well as the Helden phalera, then there are a number of silver items of the type exemplified by the Gundestrup cauldron originating in northwest France, dating to just before the Roman conquest.

Nielsen believes that the question of origin is the wrong one to ask and can produce misleading results. Because of the widespread migration of numerous ethnic groups like the Celts and Teutonic peoples and events like Roman expansion and subsequent Romanization, it is highly unlikely that only one ethnic group was responsible for the development of the Gundestrup cauldron. Instead, the make and art of the cauldron can be thought of as the product of a fusion of cultures, each inspiring and expanding upon one another. In the end, based on accelerator datings from beeswax found on the back of the plates, Nielsen concludes that the vessel was created within the Roman Iron Age. However, an addendum to Nielson&#x27;s article indicates that results from the Leibniz Lab on the same beeswax dated some 400 years earlier than reported in his article.

According to Ronald Hutton, because the cauldron&#x27;s source metals have been traced to the Black Sea region, and depicts elephants, the cauldron should no longer be considered [strictly] Celtic.

==Iconography==

===Base plate===

The decorated medallion on the circular base plate depicts a bull. Above the back of the bull is a female figure wielding a sword; three dogs are also portrayed, one over the bull&#x27;s head and another under its hooves. Presumably all of these figures are in combat; the third dog, located beneath the bull and near its tail, seems to be dead, and is only faintly shown in engraving, and the bull may have been brought down. Below the bull is scrolling ivy that draws from classical Greco-Roman art. The horns of the bull are missing, but there is a hole right through the head where they were originally fitted; perhaps they were gold. The head of the bull rises entirely clear of the plate, and the medallion is considered the most accomplished part of the cauldron in technical and artistic terms.

===Exterior plates===
Each of the seven exterior plates centrally depicts a bust. Plates a, b, c, and d show bearded male figures, and the remaining three are female.

===Interior plates===

==Interpretation and parallels==


For many years, some scholars have interpreted the cauldron&#x27;s images in terms of the Celtic pantheon, and Celtic mythology as it is presented in much later literature in Celtic languages from the British Isles. Others regard the latter interpretations with great suspicion. Much less controversially, there are clear parallels between details of the figures and Iron Age Celtic artifacts excavated by archaeology.

Other details of the iconography clearly derive from the art of the ancient Near East, and there are intriguing parallels with ancient India and later Hindu deities and their stories. Scholars are mostly content to regard the former as motifs borrowed purely for their visual appeal, without carrying over anything much of their original meaning, but despite the distance some have attempted to relate the latter to wider traditions remaining from Proto-Indo-European religion.

===Celtic archaeology===
Among the most specific details that are clearly Celtic are the group of carnyx players. The carnyx war horn was known from Roman descriptions of the Celts in battle and Trajan&#x27;s Column, and a few pieces are known from archaeology, their number greatly increased by finds at Tintignac in France in 2004.
:&quot;Their trumpets again are of a peculiar barbarian kind; they blow into them and produce a harsh sound which suits the tumult of war&quot;.

Another detail that is easily matched to archaeology is the torc worn by several figures, clearly of the &quot;buffer&quot; type, a fairly common Celtic artefact found in Western Europe, most often France, from the period the cauldron is thought to have been made.

Other details with more tentative Celtic links are the long swords carried by some figures, and the horned and antlered helmets or head-dresses and the boar crest worn on their helmet by some warriors. These can be related to Celtic artefacts such as a helmet with a raptor crest from Romania, the Waterloo Helmet, Torrs Pony-cap and Horns and various animal figures including boars, of uncertain function. The shield bosses, spurs and horse harness also relate to Celtic examples.
The antlered figure in plate A has been commonly identified as Cernunnos, who is named (the only source for the name) on the 1st-century Gallo-Roman Pillar of the Boatmen, where he is shown as an antlered figure with torcs hanging from his antlers. Possibly the lost portion below his bust showed him seated cross-legged as the figure on the cauldron is. Otherwise there is evidence of a horned god from several cultures.

The figure holding the broken wheel in plate C is more tentatively thought to be Taranis, the solar or thunder &quot;wheel-god&quot; named by Lucian and represented in a number of Iron Age images; there are also many wheels that seem to have been amulets.

===Near East and Asia===
The many animals depicted on the cauldron include elephants, a dolphin, leopard-like felines, and various fantastic animals, as well as animals that are widespread across Eurasia, such as snakes, cattle, deer, boars and birds. Celtic art often includes animals, but not often in fantastic forms with wings and aspects of different animals combined. There are exceptions to this, some when motifs are clearly borrowed, as the boy riding a dolphin is borrowed from Greek art, and others that are more native, like the ram-headed horned snake who appears three times on the cauldron. The art of Thrace often shows animals, most often powerful and fierce ones, many of which are also very common in the ancient Near East, or the Scythian art of the Eurasian steppe, whose mobile owners provided a route for the very rapid transmission of motifs and objects between the civilizations of Asia and Europe.

In particular, the two figures standing in profile flanking the large head on exterior plate F, each with a bird with outstretched wings just above their head, clearly resemble a common motif in ancient Assyrian and Persian art, down to the long garments they wear. The figure is usually the ruler, and the wings belong to a symbolic representation of a deity protecting him. Other plates show griffins borrowed from Ancient Greek art of that of the Near East. On several of the exterior plates the large heads, probably of deities, in the centre of the exterior panels, have small arms and hands, either each grasping an animal or human in a version of the common Master of Animals motif, or held up empty at the side of the head in a way suggesting inspiration from this motif.

===Celtic mythology===
Apart from Cernunnos and Taranis, discussed above, there is no consensus regarding the other figures, and many scholars reject attempts to tie them in to figures known from much later and geographically distant sources. Some Celticists have explained the elephants depicted on plate B as a reference to Hannibal&#x27;s crossing of the Alps.

Because of the double-headed wolfish monster attacking the two small figures of fallen men on plate b, parallels can be drawn to the Welsh character Manawydan or the Irish Manannán, a god of the sea and the Otherworld. Another possibility is the Gaulish version of Apollo, who was not only a warrior, but one associated with springs and healing besides.

Olmsted relates the scenes of the cauldron to those of the &quot;Táin Bó Cuailnge&quot;, where the antlered figure is Cú Chulainn, the bull of the base plate is Donn Cuailnge, and the female and two males of plate e are Medb, Ailill, and Fergus. Olmsted also toys with the idea that the female figure flanked by two birds on plate f could be Medb with her pets or Morrígan, the Irish war goddess who often changes into a carrion bird. Olmsted sees Cernunnos as Gaulish version of Irish Cu Chulainn. As Olmsted indicates, the scene on the upper right of plate A, a lion, a boy on a dolphin, and a bull, can be interpreted after the origin of the bulls of the Irish &quot;Táin&quot;, who take on various matched animal forms, fighting each other in each form, as indicated in the two lions fighting on the lower right of plate A.

Plate B could be interpreted after a Gaulish version of the beginning of the Irish &quot;Táin&quot;, where Medb sets out to get the Donn bull after making a circuit around her army in her chariot to bring luck to the &quot;Táin&quot;. Olmsted interprets the scene on plate C as a Gaulish version of the Irish &quot;Táin&quot; incidents where Cu Chulainn kicks in the Morrigan&#x27;s ribs when she comes at him as an eel and then confronts Fergus with his broken chariot wheel.

 interprets the scene with warriors on the lower part of Plate E as a Gaulish version of the &quot;Aided Fraich&quot; episode of the &quot;Táin&quot; where Fraich and his men leap over the fallen tree, and then Fraech wrestles with his father Cu Chulainn and is drowned by him, while his magic horn blowers play &quot;the music of sleeping&quot; against Cu Chulainn. In the &quot;Aided Fraich&quot; episode, Fraich&#x27;s body is then taken into the underworld by weeping &quot;banchuire&quot; to be healed by his aunt and wife Morrigan. This incident is depicted on outer plate f, which is adjacent and opposite to plate E.

Both Olmsted and Taylor agree that the female of plate f might be Rhiannon of the Mabinogion. Rhiannon is famous for her birds, whose songs could &quot;awaken the dead and lull the living to sleep&quot;. In this role, Rhiannon could be considered the Goddess of the Otherworld.

Taylor presents a more pancultural view of the cauldron&#x27;s images; he concludes that the deities and scenes portrayed on the cauldron are not specific to one culture, but many. He compares Rhiannon, whom he thinks is the figure of plate f, with Hariti, an ogress of Bactrian mythology. In addition, he points to the similarity between the female figure of plate B and the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, whose depictions are often accompanied by elephants. Wheel gods are also cross-cultural with deities like Gaulish Taranis and Hindu Vishnu.

<text>A dohyō (, ) is the space in which a sumo wrestling bout occurs. A typical &quot;dohyō&quot; is a circle made of partially buried rice-straw bales 4.55 meters in diameter. In official professional tournaments (&quot;honbasho&quot;), it is mounted on a square platform of clay 66 cm high and 6.7m wide on each side.

==Configuration and construction==

In professional sumo, a new &quot;dohyō&quot; is built prior to each tournament by the &quot;yobidashi&quot; (ring attendants), who are responsible for this activity. The process of building the &quot;dohyō&quot; and its 66 cm high platform takes three days and is done with traditional tools. The clay used is taken from the banks of the Arakawa River in Saitama Prefecture. However, due to growing urbanization, clay from Ibaraki Prefecture has started to be used. The surface is covered by sand. The &quot;dohyō&quot; is removed after each tournament and, in the case of the Nagoya tournament, pieces are taken home by the fans as souvenirs. The &quot;yobidashi&quot; also build the &quot;dohyō&quot; for training stables and sumo touring events.

The diameter of the ring is 15 &quot;shaku&quot; (4.55 meters), which increased from 13 &quot;shaku&quot; (3.94 meters) in 1931. The rice-straw bales (&quot;tawara&quot; (俵)) which form the ring are one third standard size and are partially buried in the clay of the &quot;dohyō&quot;. Four of the &quot;tawara&quot; are placed slightly outside the line of the circle at the four cardinal directions, these are called privileged bales (&quot;tokudawara&quot;). Originally, this was to allow rain to run off the surface, when sumo tournaments were held outdoors in the open. Today, a wrestler under pressure at the edge of the ring will often try to move himself round to one of these points to gain leverage in order to push back more effectively against the opponent who is trying to force him out.
At the center are two white lines, the , behind which the wrestlers must position themselves at the start of the bout. First introduced in the spring tournament of 1928, they are painted 90 cm long, 6 cm wide and 70 cm apart. The &quot;shikiri-sen&quot; are touched up by &quot;yobidashi&quot; at the end of each day with white enamel paint. The painted lines are notably slicker than the surrounding dirt, but rarely cause a wrestler to slip due to their narrowness. Around the ring is finely brushed sand called the &quot;ja-no-me&quot; (蛇の目, snake&#x27;s eye), which can be used to determine if a wrestler has just touched his foot, or another part of his body, outside the ring. The &quot;yobidashi&quot; ensure this is clean of any previous marks immediately prior to each bout.

A roof resembling that of a Shinto shrine (which has been of the Shinmei-zukuri style since the May 1953 tournament) is suspended above the &quot;dohyō&quot;, called the &quot;tsuriyane&quot;. The roof weighs 6.25 tons and is supported by cables that can hold up to 30 tons. Around the &quot;tsuriyane&quot; hangs a purple banner which is embroidered with the Japan Sumo Association&#x27;s &quot;mon&quot;. Prior to the September 1952 tournament, the &quot;tsuriyane&quot; had been supported by columns, but they were removed to allow fans an uninterrupted view of the &quot;dohyō&quot;. Colored tassels (&quot;fusa&quot;), which replaced the colored columns, are suspended from the corners. They represent the four seasons and the four spirits of directions:

*Green – Azure Dragon of the East (青龍), Spring 
*Red – Vermilion Bird of the South (朱雀), Summer
*White – White Tiger of the West (白虎), Fall
*Black – Black Tortoise of the North (玄武), Winter

The &quot;dohyō&quot; in training stables is not raised but is otherwise the same as those used in tournaments. One &quot;dohyō&quot; is standard, although some larger stables have built two.

==&quot;Dohyō matsuri&quot;==
After the &quot;dohyō&quot; has been built, a ceremony called the &quot;dohyō matsuri&quot; (ring ceremony) is held. The &quot;dohyō matsuri&quot; is said to have been introduced by Yoshida Zenzaemon sometime during the Edo period. The Yoshida family was a prominent &quot;gyōji&quot; family.

The ceremony is done to purify and consecrate the &quot;dohyō&quot;, while also inviting the kami (Shinto deities) down to watch sumo. The ceremony is led by one of the &quot;tategyōji&quot; (head referee) along with two other &quot;gyōji&quot;. The &quot;gyōji&quot; take the place of Shinto priests. The &quot;tategyoji&quot; will pray for the safety and well-being of the wrestlers. In the middle of the &quot;dohyō&quot; a square hole is cut in where the &quot;tategyoji&quot; will then place inside: torreya nuts, dried chestnuts, salt, washed rice, dried squid or cuttlefish and kombu (seaweed). The &quot;tategyoji&quot; will then will pour sacred sake into the hole, and around several other places around the &quot;dohyō&quot; before he will put more clay into the hole. The &quot;yobidashi&quot; will eventually cover up the hole. The sacred sake is then shared with everyone in attendance.

To conclude the ceremony, the &quot;yobidashi&quot; in a procession with taiko drums called a &quot;fure-daiko&quot; will begin. The procession will go around the &quot;dohyō&quot; three times before leaving the proceeding out into the street to announce the beginning of the tournament.

At the end of the tournament, one &quot;gyōji&quot; is thrown into the air by the low ranking wrestlers as a way of sending off the kami and officially ending the tournament.

<text>The name Matthew was used for three tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, replacing Mitch after 1998.

* Tropical Storm Matthew (2004) - brought heavy rain to the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, causing light damage but no deaths.
* Tropical Storm Matthew (2010) - made landfall in Central America and later moved into Mexico, causing $171million in damages and 126 deaths.
* Hurricane Matthew (2016) - an intense Category 5 hurricane that caused $15.1 billion in damages and at least 603 deaths throughout the Caribbean and the United States.

After the 2016 storm, the name was retired and replaced with &quot;Martin&quot; for the 2022 season.</text><links>

<doc id="1050731" wikidata="Q6652645" url="?curid=1050731" title="Little Band scene">
<text>The Little Band scene was an experimental post-punk scene which flourished in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia from late 1978 until early 1981. Instigated by groups Primitive Calculators and Whirlywhirld, this scene was concentrated in the inner suburbs of Fitzroy and St Kilda, and involved many short-lived bands that played live only once or twice before changing names and swapping members.

The little bands played in small venues, often pubs, and their shows were recorded and broadcast by radio announcer Alan Bamford on community station 3RRR. In the scene, the distinctions between performers and audience were blurred, with many little bands made up of non-musicians on borrowed equipment and encouraging spontaneous participation during their shows.

The scene gave rise to several notable bands, including Dead Can Dance and Hunters &amp; Collectors, and also served as the backdrop for the 1986 cult film &quot;Dogs in Space&quot;, starring INXS frontman Michael Hutchence. The little band concept has been intermittently revived into the 21st century, with the Melbourne Fringe Festival and a number of Melbourne pubs hosting Little Band Nights.

==History==

In 1978, members of Primitive Calculators, an experimental post-punk group from Melbourne, formed a short-lived side band, the Leapfrogs. Using it as their own opening act, they decided to form other &quot;little bands&quot; with friends, including members of Whirlywirld, who lived next door to the group in Fitzroy North, with rehearsal spaces in each house. The little bands grew in number, sharing instruments and equipment, and the term &quot;North Fitzroy Beat&quot; was coined to describe their sound. Soon they started staging &quot;Little Band Nights&quot; at various inner city venues, notably the Champion Hotel in Fitzroy, the Crystal Ballroom in St Kilda and the Exford in Chinatown, with occasional appearances in Carlton, Collingwood and Richmond. At first, strict rules were imposed: no little band was allowed to play more than twice and could have no more than fifteen minutes worth of material. According to Primitive Calculators frontman Stuart Grant, it was &quot;the punk ethos of disposability, novelty and working against the grain of the standard modes of procedure in the music business.&quot;

Many of the little bands were composed of painters, poets, filmmakers, performance artists, and other non-musicians who enjoyed the opportunity to realise their naive musical ideas. Little band member John Murphy explained that &quot;a lot of the original participants were artists who applied the Dada sort of approach of their painting&quot;. One journalist described the little bands&#x27; output as &quot;sloppy, clangy and discordant. By turns, they could sound equally fantastic: a mixture of epileptic drum machine rhythms, stabbing synth lines and creepy/witty lyrics making for oddly compelling results.&quot; Some members of the scene had received proper training in electronic music and composition, including Whirlywirld&#x27;s Ollie Olsen, who studied under Melbourne-based composer Felix Werder.

Little band member and radio announcer Alan Bamford began recording Little Band Nights using a TEAC reel-to-reel tape recorder and a Shure microphone. Immediately following each gig, he caught a tram to 3RRR&#x27;s Fitzroy premises, where he broadcast the tapes on his midnight show. The scene continued to grow, and at later nights, up to ten little bands would perform.

The little bands interacted with other distinct post-punk scenes in Melbourne, such as the St Kilda scene centred at the Crystal Ballroom, where they occasionally supported The Birthday Party and Crime &amp; the City Solution. The &quot;wild and chaotic&quot; nature of the little bands stood in stark contrast to &quot;the more academic form of experimentalism&quot; of Essendon Airport, Tsk Tsk Tsk, Paul Schütze, Ernie Althoff, and others associated with the Organ Factory, an artist-run space in Clifton Hill. According to Murphy, the little bands reviled the &quot;Clifton Hill mob&quot; for being against emotion in music, while Tsk Tsk Tsk founder Philip Brophy regarded the Little Band scene as anti-intellectual, and its music &quot;harsh and sometimes painful&quot;.

After the Calculators and Whirlywirld left Melbourne for Europe and London in early 1980, the Little Band scene centred on the shared spaces of Use No Hooks and The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed Up Zombies. The scene had effectively ended by early 1981.

===Aftermath===

Several lasting musical partnerships were forged in the scene: Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry went on to achieve international fame as Dead Can Dance; members of the Jetsonnes regrouped to form Hunters &amp; Collectors; Kim Beissel and Chris Astley joined the Melbourne incarnation of Crime &amp; the City Solution; and the Serious Young Insects later became Boom Crash Opera. Zorros also formed out of an impromptu jam during one of the Champion Hotel&#x27;s Little Band Nights in early 1980.

==Recordings and releases==
Alan Bamford collaborated with Max Robenstone, owner of Climax Records in Fitzroy, in paying for the pressing of &quot;Little Bands&quot; (1980), an EP featuring studio recordings by Morpions, Ronnie and the Rhythm Boys, The Take and Too Fat to Fit Through the Door. The first phase of the scene—up to the departure of the Calculators and Whirlywirld—was documented on an unreleased double LP, &quot;No Sin Like Dancing&quot;, that is catalogued in Clinton Walker&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;Inner City Sound&quot;. Several little bands can also be found on the 1981 &quot;One Stop Shopping&quot; compilation curated by Severed Heads member Tom Ellard and released through Terse Tapes, as well as on issues of &quot;Fast Forward&quot; (1980–82), a cassette magazine founded and edited by Bruce Milne of Au Go Go Records. Bootleg copies of Alan Bamford&#x27;s live recordings of the little bands are also known to exist.

Since the scene ended, little band recordings have appeared on Chapter Music releases, including the 2007 &quot;Primitive Calculators and Friends&quot; CD, the &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop It!&quot; compilation series, and &quot;The Job&quot; (2020), which features previously unreleased Use No Hooks recordings. In 2016, German label Vinyl On Demand released &quot;Magnetophonics: Australian Underground Music 1978–1984&quot;, featuring several little bands.

==Legacy and influence==

Influenced by the little bands concept in Melbourne, post-punk group Pel Mel started a similar scene in Sydney in 1980, albeit smaller in scale and more studio-based.

The Little Band scene was fictionalised in the 1986 cult film &quot;Dogs in Space&quot;, directed by Richard Lowenstein and starring INXS frontman Michael Hutchence. Primitive Calculators briefly reformed to star in the film, playing a new version of their song &quot;Pumping Ugly Muscle&quot;. Original little band Thrush and the Cunts also appear with the song &quot;Diseases&quot;, and little band figurehead Marie Hoy performs a cover of &quot;Shivers&quot; by the Boys Next Door. The live music scenes were supervised by Whirlywirld&#x27;s Ollie Olsen, who also appears in the film. Coinciding with the film&#x27;s long-awaited re-release, Lowenstein revisited &quot;Dogs in Space&quot;, the Little Band scene and Melbourne post-punk in general in the 2009 documentary &quot;We&#x27;re Livin&#x27; on Dog Food&quot;, featuring rare footage and interviews with various members of the scene.

In 2010, the Melbourne Fringe Festival staged two shows dedicated to Little Band scene&#x27;s ethos of ephemerality. Participants included members of contemporary bands the Boat People, the Crayon Fields, the Devastations, Dick Diver and Pikelet, among others. Chapter Music&#x27;s Guy Blackman also participated, as well as members of Primitive Calculators with special guests the Take, an original little band which reformed for the first time in 30 years. Since then, several Melbourne venues, including The Tote, have helped to revive the little bands concept with shows headlined by the reformed Primitive Calculators.

<doc id="1050736" wikidata="Q108977" url="?curid=1050736" title="List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita">
<text>This is a list of countries by nominal GDP per capita.

GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country&#x27;s standard of living; however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income. Measures of personal income include average wage, real income, median income, disposable income and GNI per capita.

Comparisons of GDP per capita are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries, &quot;see&quot; List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita. PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.

The figures presented here do not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country&#x27;s currency. Such fluctuations change a country&#x27;s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.

For change of GDP per capita over time as a measure of economic growth, see real GDP growth and real GDP per capita growth.

Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here (except Kosovo and Taiwan), but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in &quot;italics&quot;. Four UN members (Cuba, Liechtenstein, Monaco and North Korea) do not belong to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), hence their economies are not ranked below. Kosovo, despite not being a member of the United Nations, is a member of IMF. Taiwan is not a IMF member but it is still listed in the official IMF indices.

Several leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions may be considered tax havens, and their GDP data subject to material distortion by tax-planning activities. Examples include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Luxembourg.

== Table ==
&quot;All data are in current United States dollars. Historical data see list of countries by past and projected GDP (nominal) per capita.&quot;

&quot;The table initially ranks each country or territory by its IMF estimate, and can be reranked by any of the sources.&quot;


Notes:
* Data unavailable for the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Holy See (Vatican City), Jersey, Niue, the Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, Tokelau, and Western Sahara.
* Nearly all country links in the table (except that of Zanzibar) take to articles titled &quot;Income in &quot;country&quot; or &quot;territory&quot;&quot; or to &quot;Economy of &quot;country&quot; or &quot;territory&quot;&quot;.

==Distorted GDP-per-capita for tax havens==
Many of the leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions are tax havens whose economic data is artificially inflated by tax-driven corporate accounting entries. For instance, the Irish GDP data above is subject to material distortion by the tax planning activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. To address this, in 2017 the Central Bank of Ireland created &quot;modified GNI&quot; (or GNI*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI*.

Further discussion on this topic can be found in the List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita article.

<text>Lins is a municipality in the western part of the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 78,503 (2020 est.) in an area of 570 km2. The elevation is 437 m. Distance is 455 km from the state capital, São Paulo.

==History==

The town was founded in the beginning of the 20th century, at first with the name of &quot;Santo Antônio do Campestre&quot;, and grew after the arrival of the &quot;Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil&quot; (The Northwest railroad of Brazil). It became an independent municipality in 1920, when it was separated from the municipality Pirajuí. It was named after Manoel Joaquim de Albuquerque Lins, who was the president of the state of São Paulo from 1908 to 1912.

<doc id="1050741" wikidata="Q2039117" url="?curid=1050741" title="Pythagorean trigonometric identity">
<text>The Pythagorean trigonometric identity, also called simply the Pythagorean identity, is an identity expressing the Pythagorean theorem in terms of trigonometric functions. Along with the sum-of-angles formulae, it is one of the basic relations between the sine and cosine functions.

The identity is
:formula_1

As usual, formula_2 means formula_3.

==Proofs and their relationships to the Pythagorean theorem==

===Proof based on right-angle triangles===

Any similar triangles have the property that if we select the same angle in all of them, the ratio of the two sides defining the angle is the same regardless of which similar triangle is selected, regardless of its actual size: the ratios depend upon the three angles, not the lengths of the sides. Thus for either of the similar right triangles in the figure, the ratio of its horizontal side to its hypotenuse is the same, namely .

The elementary definitions of the sine and cosine functions in terms of the sides of a right triangle are:

formula_4

The Pythagorean identity follows by squaring both definitions above, and adding; the left-hand side of the identity then becomes

formula_5

which by the Pythagorean theorem is equal to 1. This definition is valid for all angles, due to the definition of defining and for the unit circle and thus and for a circle of radius and reflecting our triangle in the and setting and .

Alternatively, the identities found at Trigonometric symmetry, shifts, and periodicity may be employed. By the periodicity identities we can say if the formula is true for then it is true for all real . Next we prove the identity in the range . To do this we let , will now be in the range . We can then make use of squared versions of some basic shift identities (squaring conveniently removes the minus signs):

formula_6

Finally, it remains is to prove the formula for ; this can be done by squaring the symmetry identities to get

formula_7

====Related identities====

The two identities formula_8 are also called Pythagorean trigonometric identities. If one leg of a right triangle has length 1, then the tangent of the angle adjacent to that leg is the length of the other leg, and the secant of the angle is the length of the hypotenuse.

formula_9

In this way, this trigonometric identity involving the tangent and the secant follows from the Pythagorean theorem. The angle opposite the leg of length 1 (this angle can be labeled ) has cotangent equal to the length of the other leg, and cosecant equal to the length of the hypotenuse. In that way, this trigonometric identity involving the cotangent and the cosecant also follows from the Pythagorean theorem.

The following table gives the identities with the factor or divisor that relates them to the main identity.

===Proof using the unit circle===

The unit circle centered at the origin in the Euclidean plane is defined by the equation:

:formula_10

Given an angle &quot;θ&quot;, there is a unique point &quot;P&quot; on the unit circle at an anticlockwise angle of &quot;θ&quot; from the &quot;x&quot;-axis, and the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-coordinates of &quot;P&quot; are:

formula_11

Consequently, from the equation for the unit circle, formula_12
the Pythagorean identity.

In the figure, the point has a -coordinate, and is appropriately given by , which is a negative number: . Point has a positive -coordinate, and . As increases from zero to the full circle , the sine and cosine change signs in the various quadrants to keep and with the correct signs. The figure shows how the sign of the sine function varies as the angle changes quadrant.

Because the - and -axes are perpendicular, this Pythagorean identity is equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem for triangles with hypotenuse of length 1 (which is in turn equivalent to the full Pythagorean theorem by applying a similar-triangles argument). See Unit circle for a short explanation.

===Proof using power series===
The trigonometric functions may also be defined using power series, namely for (an angle measured in radians):

formula_13

Using the multiplication formula for power series at Multiplication and division of power series (suitably modified to account for the form of the series here) we obtain

formula_14

In the expression for , must be at least 1, while in the expression for , the constant term is equal to 1. The remaining terms of their sum are (with common factors removed)

formula_15

by the binomial theorem. Consequently,
formula_16
which is the Pythagorean trigonometric identity.

When the trigonometric functions are defined in this way, the identity in combination with the Pythagorean theorem shows that these power series parameterize the unit circle, which we used in the previous section. This definition constructs the sine and cosine functions in a rigorous fashion and proves that they are differentiable, so that in fact it subsumes the previous two.

===Proof using the differential equation===
Sine and cosine can be defined as the two solutions to the differential equation:

formula_17

satisfying respectively , and , . It follows from the theory of ordinary differential equations that the first solution, sine, has the second, cosine, as its derivative, and it follows from this that the derivative of cosine is the negative of the sine. The identity is equivalent to the assertion that the function

formula_18

is constant and equal to 1. Differentiating using the chain rule gives:

formula_19
so is constant. A calculation confirms that , and is a constant so for all , so the Pythagorean identity is established.

A similar proof can be completed using power series as above to establish that the sine has as its derivative the cosine, and the cosine has as its derivative the negative sine. In fact, the definitions by ordinary differential equation and by power series lead to similar derivations of most identities.

This proof of the identity has no direct connection with Euclid&#x27;s demonstration of the Pythagorean theorem.

===Proof using Euler&#x27;s formula===

Using Euler&#x27;s formula formula_20 and factoring formula_21 as the complex difference of two squares,

formula_22

<doc id="1050744" wikidata="Q1542119" url="?curid=1050744" title="United Artists Records">
<text>United Artists Records was an American record label founded by Max E. Youngstein of United Artists in 1957 to issue movie soundtracks. The label expanded into other genres, such as easy listening, jazz, pop, and R&amp;B.

== History ==
=== Genres ===
In 1958, United Artists released an album of music from the film &quot;The Big Country&quot;, for which composer Jerome Moross received an Academy Award nomination.

In 1959, United Artists released &quot;Forest of the Amazons,&quot; a cantata by Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos adapted from the music he composed for MGM&#x27;s &quot;Green Mansions&quot;, with the composer conducting the Symphony of the Air. Brazilian soprano Bidu Sayão was the featured soloist on the unusual recording, which was released on both LP and reel-to-reel tape.

United Artists releases included soundtracks and cover versions from the James Bond movies, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; starring the Beatles (1964), &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966), &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1971), and &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1972). The soundtrack album of United Artists&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) was released by Columbia Records, which had also released the Broadway cast album. Also, the American version of the soundtrack album of United Artists&#x27;s &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), also starring the Beatles, was released on Capitol Records.

As Henry Mancini was signed to RCA Victor, that company handled the soundtracks of the United Artists films that he composed the music for, most notably &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;; exceptions include &quot;Gaily, Gaily&quot;, &quot;The Hawaiians&quot;, &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot;. Many of these soundtracks have reverted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, whose MGM Music unit licensed them to other labels for reissue, first Rykodisc, then Universal Music and EMI. As owner of Columbia and RCA Victor, Sony released the &quot;West Side Story&quot; original cast album and film soundtrack on CD. Sony has owned most of Mancini&#x27;s soundtrack albums since its music division&#x27;s merger with BMG in 2004.

The label produced rock and roll and R&amp;B hits from 1959 and into the 1960s by the Clovers, Marv Johnson, the Falcons, the Exciters, Patty Duke, the Delicates, Bobby Goldsboro, Jay and the Americans, and later Manfred Mann and the Easybeats. Berry Gordy placed a number of early Motown acts with United Artists, including Marv Johnson and Eddie Holland in 1959. Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were hired to produce artists signed to the label after they left Atlantic. These included the Exciters, Bobby Goldsboro, Jay and the Americans, the Clovers, and Mike Clifford. United Artists covered folk music when it added Gordon Lightfoot to its roster and easy listening with the addition of piano duo Ferrante &amp; Teicher.

United Artists&#x27; involvement with jazz was significant. The company hired Alan Douglas in 1960 to run its jazz division. Other producers were George Wein, Jack Lewis, and Tom Wilson. United Artists released jazz albums by Count Basie, Art Blakey, Ruby Braff, Betty Carter, Teddy Charles, Kenny Dorham, Mose Allison, Duke Ellington, Art Farmer, Bud Freeman, Curtis Fuller, Benny Golson, Billie Holiday, Milt Jackson, Dave Lambert, Booker Little, Howard McGhee, Gerry Mulligan, Oliver Nelson, Herb Pomeroy, Bill Potts, Zoot Sims, Rex Stewart, Billy Strayhorn, and the Modern Jazz Quartet. Many of the album covers were designed by Frank Gauna.

In 1966, the Solid State division was begun, recording several albums by The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra. Other subsidiary labels were Unart, Ascot, United Artists Jazz, Musicor (United Artists was half owner of the company from 1960 to 1964 before selling in 1965, Ultra Audio (an audiophile label), UA Latino (Spanish-language music,) and Veep. Unart was created in 1958 and was in operation until 1959, producing singles by vocal groups; it was reinstated in 1967 for budget albums.

In 1966 United Artists acquired the masters of Sue Records, an R&amp;B and soul record label in New York City which produced Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Baby Washington, and jazz organist Jimmy McGriff. Some material produced by Sue was reissued on Unart.

United Artists produced a series of children&#x27;s records under the &quot;Tale Spinners for Children&quot; name throughout the 1960s. These were album-length adaptations of classic fairy tales and children&#x27;s stories done in an audio drama format.

=== Other UA labels ===
United Artists Special Projects were budget records designed for product and movie tie-ins. Examples are &quot;The Incredible World of James Bond&quot;, an album sold by Pepsi Cola and Frito Lay of cover version themes and original soundtrack music of the first three James Bond films, and &quot;Music from Marlboro Country&quot;, various cover versions of the theme to &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and original soundtrack music from Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Return of the Seven&quot; that was sold by Philip Morris as a tie-in to its Marlboro cigarette brand.

=== Merger ===

In 1969, United Artists merged with co-owned Liberty Records and its subsidiary, Imperial Records. In 1971, Liberty/UA Records dropped the Liberty name in favor of United Artists.

Mainstream pop acts were signed to the label, among them Traffic, the Spencer Davis Group, Peter Sarstedt, Shirley Bassey, and War. The label attempted to update the style of 1950s rock group Bill Haley &amp; His Comets with a 1968 single. After UA bought Mediarts Records, the roster grew to include Don McLean, Merrilee Rush, Paul Anka, Chris Rea, Dusty Springfield, Bill Conti, Northern Calloway, Johnny Rivers, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Gerry Rafferty, and Crystal Gayle. Later, through a distribution deal with Jet Records, Electric Light Orchestra was signed. UA also distributed the otherwise-independent Grateful Dead Records in the early-to-mid 1970s.

In England, Andrew Lauder, who had been head of A&amp;R at the UK branch of Liberty Records, transferred to UA when Liberty was shut down in 1971. His signings included the Groundhogs, Aynsley Dunbar (only in the UK), Hawkwind, Bonzo Dog Band, Brinsley Schwarz, Man (all originally Liberty artists), High Tide, Help Yourself, Dr. Feelgood, the Buzzcocks, the Stranglers and 999. He also licensed UK releases for several influential German bands during the early 70s, the best known of which were Can, Neu! and Amon Düül II. Lauder left UA in late 1977 to help found Radar Records.

The label&#x27;s most commercially successful artist was country artist Kenny Rogers who signed to UA in the mid-1970s, enjoying a long string of hit singles and albums.

In the mid-to-late 1970s, the company was known as United Artists Music and Records Group (UAMARG).

=== Sale to EMI ===
In 1978, UA executives Artie Mogull and Jerry Rubinstein bought the record company from Transamerica with a loan from EMI, which took over distribution of the label. The official name of the company was changed to Liberty/United Records, but the United Artists Records name was retained under license. The deal led to an immediate setback, as the change of ownership allowed Jet Records to end its relationship with UA and switch its distribution to CBS Records, with the Jet back catalog transferring to CBS distribution as well. UA dumped many ELO albums into the cutout market, which CBS was unable to prevent. However, CBS reissues of early ELO albums through &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1977) contained copyright notices for United Artists Music and Records Group. Unable to generate enough income to cover the loan, Liberty/United Records was sold to EMI in 1979 for $3 million and assumed liabilities of $32 million.

EMI dropped the United Artists name in 1980 and revived the Liberty label for releases by artists who had been signed to UA. This incarnation of Liberty Records operated between 1980 and about 1986, when it was deactivated and its artists assigned to other EMI labels.

Many albums from the United Artists Records catalog were reissued on Liberty during these years. Two significant exceptions were a couple of Beatles albums not previously controlled by EMI in the United States: the &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964) soundtrack album, and &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970). The &quot;Let It Be&quot; album was actually released by Apple Records in both the UK and the US but because the movie had been distributed by United Artists Pictures, in America the album was distributed by United Artists rather than EMI. Both previously non-EMI Beatles albums were reissued on the Capitol label, which already controlled the rest of the Beatles&#x27; catalog in the United States.

=== UAR today ===
When producer Jerry Weintraub was enlisted to revive the United Artists movie studio in 1986, he attempted to revive the United Artists Records label as well. However, only one album was released: the soundtrack for &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;, a film Weintraub had produced for Columbia Pictures before being hired at UA. A single from the movie&#x27;s soundtrack, Mancrab&#x27;s &quot;Fish for Life,&quot; was also released on United Artists Records.

The United Artists catalog is controlled by Capitol Records, now part of Universal Music Group (who also owns the non-soundtrack catalog of MGM Records, once owned by UA&#x27;s current parent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer). Capitol Records also has the rights to soundtrack albums UA Records released under license from MGM Music. The catalog of most British acts who were signed to the British branch of UA Records is today controlled by the Parlophone unit of Warner Music Group, with North American distribution by Rhino Entertainment. One exception is the band The Vapors, whose rights to their UA/Liberty recordings are owned by RT Industries, which acquired them from WMG in 2018. However, Warner&#x27;s services division Alternative Distribution Alliance serves as RT&#x27;s distributor.

<doc id="1050748" wikidata="Q77640" url="?curid=1050748" title="Karl Maximovich">
<text>Carl Johann Maximovich, also Karl Ivanovich Maximovich (Russian: Карл Иванович Максимович; 23 November 1827 – 16 February 1891) was a Russian botanist. Maximovich spent most of his life studying the flora of the countries he had visited in the Far East, and naming many new species. He worked at the Saint Petersburg Botanical Gardens from 1852 as curator of the herbarium collection, becoming Director in 1869.

== History ==
Born a Baltic-German, his name at birth was Karl Ivanovich Maksimovich, but he changed it to the German version of his name for his scientific work. He graduated in biology from the institution which is now University of Tartu, Estonia in (1850), he was a pupil of Alexander G. von Bunge.

From 1853 to 1857 he traveled around the world. He travelled with another Baltic-German Leopold von Schrenck to the Amur region in eastern Asia. From 1859 to 1864 he also he visited China, Korea and Japan. He arrived in Japan in late 1860, initially basing his operations in Hakodate. He traveled extensively in southern Japan and for much of 1862 including the region of Yokohama and Mount Fuji, he ended that year in Nagasaki. He also explored much of Kyūshū.

He was particularly involved with the flora of Japan, following the footsteps of notably Carl Peter Thunberg, and Philipp Franz von Siebold. His assistant in Japan was Sukawa Chonosuke, whose name was given by Maximovich to the flower Trillium tschonoskii.

He also studied the flora of Tibet, concluding that it was chiefly composed of immigrants from Mongolia and the Himalaya.

Commissioned by the Russian Academy of Sciences, he purchased from von Siebold&#x27;s widow the set of eight volumes of the famous collection of Japanese botanical illustrations drawn by several Japanese artists. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1888.

<text>The Clarendon ministry was forged out of the royalist camp of Charles II, who was returned to the throne (the English Restoration) in 1660. Two years previously, Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon) had been appointed Lord Chancellor, and in 1660, he was joined by several other powerful statesmen, including the heir presumptive of the English throne, the Duke of York. After the Second Anglo-Dutch War, however, Charles lost confidence in his ministers, and in 1667, five statesmen took cooperative power in the Cabal ministry.

Lord Clarendon was impeached by the House of Commons and forced to flee; the Duke of Albemarle sold his position to George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham; and Sir George Carteret simply left his position, eventually being forced out of the House two years later.

==Committee for Foreign Affairs==
The Privy Council Committee for Foreign Affairs served as the ministry; other significant statesmen not in the committee are listed in the next section. As the name of the ministry would suggest, Lord Clarendon (earlier Lord Hyde) was, in effect, the leader of the government.

<text>The Thorp T-18 is an American, two-place, all-metal, plans-built, homebuilt aircraft designed in 1963 by John Thorp.

The aircraft was originally designed as an open cockpit aircraft, powered by a military surplus Lycoming O-290G ground power unit engine, but evolved into a fully bubble canopied aircraft powered by engines of up to .

==Design and development==
The T-18 was designed to be easily constructed from sheets of aluminum, and use a modified Lycoming O-290G. It was originally designed with an open cockpit and with the cylinder heads protruding through the engine cowling in the interest of simplicity. Even as originally designed, the cruising speed was quite high. The design showed great potential for higher performance and so modifications were created to install larger, cowled Lycomings and a bubble canopy. These modifications allow a T-18 with to cruise at and higher-powered examples to cruise in excess of . Some aircraft have been constructed with retractable landing gear.

These performance improvements made the T-18 one of the most popular homebuilt designs of the 1970s and early 1980s until the Van&#x27;s Aircraft RV kitplane series came on the market.

The T-18 was designed to use the Lycoming O-290G Ground Power Unit. At the time the T-18 was developed, these engines were inexpensive and widely available as military surplus generator motors. When converted for aircraft use they are virtually identical to the O-290D or O-290D2 aircraft engines.

Other Lycoming engines can be used, including the Lycoming O-320, Lycoming O-340, Lycoming O-360 and the Lycoming IO-360.

T-18 plans were available to builders from Eklund Engineering, which was also developing a laser-cut kit version and as of 2009 had aileron, flap and empennage kits. Classic Sport Aircraft at one time supplied plans, parts, and kits for the S-18 and the S-18T tricycle gear version, but went out of business in 2014. Thorp Central acquired the assets of Classic Sport Aircraft and now provides S-18 plans and parts.

By 2011 over 1600 sets of plans had been sold and 400 examples were flying.

==Operational history==
One T-18, N455DT, was built by Donald Taylor of California and flown around the world from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in 1976. This was the first successful circumnavigation of the world by a homebuilt aircraft. Taylor subsequently flew N455DT to the geographical North Pole, using a Sperry hybrid inertial navigation system.

Clive Canning flew another T-18 from Australia to England earlier the same year.

<doc id="1050768" wikidata="Q3998998" url="?curid=1050768" title="Triponzo">
<text>Triponzo is a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune&quot; of Cerreto di Spoleto in the Province of Perugia, Umbria, central Italy. It stands at an elevation of 420 metres above sea level. At the time of the Istat census of 2001 it had 45 inhabitants.

The name of the town must surely derive from Latin &quot;*Tripontium&quot;, meaning &quot;three bridges&quot;, presumably one over each branch of the rivers; but no Roman bridge has survived. It is famous among epigraphers for a Roman inscription (CIL IX.4541 = ILLRP 1275a), carved in the live rock on the outer face of the modern SS 209 road tunnel a few hundred metres W of the town, which records the building of the Roman road from Spoletium to Nursia by order of the Roman Senate.

Triponzo is also notable for at least one medieval church, S. Caterina, and sulphureous springs, about 1.5 km (1 mi) NE of town, the water of which is considered to have therapeutic properties: a combination spa and hydroelectric facility have been under construction here since the late 20th century.

The famous Valnerina (Valley of the Nera River) in Umbria was characterized by more than 50 medieval fortifications with watchtowers. Over the years, most of the towers were lost due to war and seismic events. The tower of Triponzo was the largest of these lying at the crux of two important valleys. Built in the 1300s it was badly damaged during the earthquake of September 1997. Given that it was one of the few remaining structures, the authorities expressed the desire to see it rebuilt in part to cancel traumatic events from memory however rebuilding the tower would have required its total demolition and removing the fallen parts would have meant an unacceptable risk for the workers. With the help of modern building technology, a new project was created by Architects Martin Stubenrauch, Moreno Orazi and Engineer Fabrizio Menghini. The fallen tower parts were stabilized, the facade preserved and a monumental modern steel spine was added to uphold and re-identify the monument in modern terms. Today the tower leaps into view upon approaching the town by roadway. The tower is unique in its bold approach to historic reconstruction.

<doc id="1050773" wikidata="Q1668940" url="?curid=1050773" title="Judge (sumo)">
<text>or Shinpan are the ring-side judges of a professional sumo bout. In a sumo &quot;honbasho&quot; tournament, five &quot;shimpan&quot; sit around the ring to observe which wrestler wins the matchup, with two additional &quot;shimpan&quot; serving as video review officials in another room. When judging tournament bouts, they wear formal Japanese dress of &quot;otokomono&quot;, &quot;haori&quot; with &quot;mon&quot;, and &quot;hakama&quot;. At the end of each bout, an initial decision is given by the &quot;gyōji&quot; (the ring referee), which is usually correct and no action is taken by the &quot;shimpan&quot;.
==Seating and status==
Five &quot;shimpan&quot; sit around the ring during the tournament. The order of importance of the &quot;shimpan&quot; is determined by where they sit. The order of importance goes North, East, South East, South West, West. They will rotate where they sit every day to maintain equality. However, in the top division, only the chief &quot;shimpan&quot; and his two deputies may sit in the North. The South East &quot;shimpan&quot; also acts as the timekeeper and gives a signal to the &quot;gyōji&quot; (referee) when preparation time is up and the wrestlers should fight. Prior to September 1952, the raised shire roof (&quot;tsuriyane&quot;) was supported by columns and the &quot;shimpan&quot; would sit in front of the columns. 

==&quot;Mono-ii&quot;==
If one of the &quot;shimpan&quot; disagrees or is unsure about the decision, then he raises his hand and the five of them climb into the ring, or &quot;dohyō&quot; to hold a &quot;mono-ii&quot;. A &quot;mono-ii&quot; (of the &quot;shimpan&quot; only) can in principle also be called by any of the four sumo wrestlers awaiting their bout around the ring, although this is an extremely rare occurrence.

During the &quot;mono-ii,&quot; the five &quot;shimpan&quot; give their views on what happened. The &quot;gyōji&quot; is usually able to listen in but is not expected to take part unless invited to do so. (In a famous case in January 1972, when the &quot;shimpan&quot; overruled the &quot;gyōji&quot; and said that Kitanofuji was the winner because his opponent was &quot;shini-tai&quot; and Kitanofuji was entitled to put his hand down first to prevent injury (&quot;kabai-te&quot;), the &quot;gyōji&quot; was seen to be arguing with the officials.) Overturning a call can be a serious matter for a &quot;gyōji,&quot; as he has to file a report and it can hinder his promotion, lead to suspension for a number of days, or in very rare cases resignation. For top division matches, two further &quot;shimpan&quot; in a separate room serve as replay review officials, in communication with the chief &quot;shimpan&quot; (who is always one of the three senior members of the judging committee) via an audio link in his ear.

The use of video was brought in as a result of a famous bout in March 1969 in which the &quot;yokozuna&quot; Taihō was adjudged to have lost the bout despite subsequent replays and photographs indicating otherwise. The referee had originally given the victory to Taihō, but the judges reversed his decision. The loss of this bout broke an extremely unusual 45 bout winning streak by the &quot;yokozuna&quot; and consequently the decision received much adverse publicity. One of the two &quot;shimpan&quot; in the video booth must now also be one of the three most senior judges. This rule was brought in as a result of judging controversies in the 1990s.

The result of the &quot;mono-ii&quot; can be to uphold the &quot;gyōji&#x27;s&quot; decision (so-called &quot;gunbai-dōri&quot;), reverse his decision (&quot;gunbai-sashichigai&quot;), or call a rematch (&quot;torinaoshi&quot;). Prior to 1926, draws (&quot;azukari&quot;) were allowed. The head &quot;shimpan&quot; is responsible for making the announcement and a brief explanation to the wrestlers and spectators.

On the rarest of occasions, a rematch () can be called due to a judging error. In a top division match between Kotozakura and Atamifuji at the January 2025 tournament, judge Asahiyama (former Kotonishiki) raised his hand to stop the contest believing that Kotozakura&#x27;s foot stepped out of the . Video replays confirmed that the foot did not touch the ground outside of the straw bales at the time the hand was raised, and the judges decided to order a rematch.

==Status of the &quot;shimpan&quot;==
All the &quot;shimpan&quot; are &quot;oyakata&quot;, or sumo elders, of the Japan Sumo Association and are members of its judging committee. At the end of each &quot;honbasho&quot; tournament, the judging committee members also have the responsibility to decide the ranking of the wrestlers for the following tournament, which includes making the initial formal recommendation for the promotion of a wrestler to the rank of &quot;ōzeki&quot; to the Sumo Association board of directors. A special advisory body of external members is responsible for initial recommendations of promotion to the top rank of &quot;yokozuna&quot;.

The judging committee has 23 members at any one time. The three chief &quot;shimpan&quot;, who are nearly always former &quot;yokozuna&quot; or &quot;ōzeki&quot;, serve two-year terms, while the other 20 members serve one-year terms. An &quot;oyakata&quot; is normally expected to have reached at least a high &quot;maegashira&quot; rank as an active wrestler and must usually wait at least five years after retirement to become a &quot;shimpan&quot;. One exception was Nishonoseki (the 72nd &quot;yokozuna&quot; Kisenosato), who was named to the judging committee just three years after his retirement.

<doc id="1050778" wikidata="Q7673709" url="?curid=1050778" title="Tachi-ai">
<text>The is the initial charge between two sumo wrestlers at the beginning of a bout. It is a combination of two Japanese words that mean “stand” and “meet”.

There are several common techniques that wrestlers use at the tachi-ai, with the aim of getting a decisive advantage in the bout:

; Charge head-first
: Usually to attempt to use one&#x27;s weight and momentum to force the opponent backwards out of the ring. Such a headlong charge in a low position can lead a more agile opponent to dodge out of the way and slap the charger on the back to push him to his knees. 
; Try to raise the opponent up into a vertical position
: Makes the opponent more vulnerable to being pushed backwards toward the ring edge and also to certain types of throw and pull down moves.
; Thrust the opponent&#x27;s chest
: Again force the opponent backwards towards the ringedge, or to unbalance him sufficiently to execute a beltless arm throw or a pull down move. Powerful thrusts can on occasion be enough to force the opponent to fall over in the ring.
; Slap the opponent&#x27;s face
: Shock the opponent into lowering his guard to gain an advantageous position, in certain cases the slap has been known to be enough to stun an opponent into falling to his knees. 
; Grab the opponent&#x27;s belt
: Use the belt to gain leverage to force an opponent backwards, or to execute a belt throw
; React to the opponent&#x27;s move
: Includes dodging out of the way of an incautious charge as described above (known as &quot;henka&quot;), or dodging the attempted slap and using the opponent&#x27;s lack of balance to gain an advantageous position.
; Jump over the opponent
: Used famously by retired rikishi Hayateumi and Mainoumi, involves jumping high at the charge and hoping the opponent charges out of the ring.
; Surprise the opponent
: Includes such moves as clapping one hands in front of the opponent&#x27;s face (nekodamashi) and using the momentary blink to duck underneath to get a strong belt or leg grip to try to subsequently throw the opponent. See also Henka.

The rules state that the wrestlers must touch down both fists on the floor before the &quot;tachi-ai&quot;. By the 1970s and early 1980s, the rule had come to be widely ignored, with wrestlers charging from a virtually standing position. A crackdown by the Japan Sumo Association in 1984 led to the fist-down rule being enforced once again, but has also led to concerns that it increases the likelihood of wrestlers charging head-first into each other and suffering concussion.

<doc id="1050784" wikidata="Q753016" url="?curid=1050784" title="Diabase">
<text>Diabase (), also called dolerite () or microgabbro,
is a mafic, holocrystalline, subvolcanic rock equivalent to volcanic basalt or plutonic gabbro. Diabase dikes and sills are typically shallow intrusive bodies and often exhibit fine-grained to aphanitic chilled margins which may contain tachylite (dark mafic glass).

&quot;Diabase&quot; is the preferred name in North America, while &quot;dolerite&quot; is the preferred name in the rest of the English-speaking world, where sometimes the name &quot;diabase&quot; refers to altered dolerites and basalts. Some geologists prefer to avoid confusion by using the name &quot;microgabbro&quot;.

The name &quot;diabase&quot; comes from the French &#x27;, and ultimately from the Greek&#x27; (meaning &quot;act of crossing over, transition&quot;) whereas the name &quot;dolerite&quot; comes from the French &quot;&quot;, from the Greek &quot;doleros&quot; (“deceitful, deceptive”), because it was easily confused with diorite.

==Petrography==

Diabase normally has a fine but visible texture of euhedral lath-shaped plagioclase crystals (62%) set in a finer matrix of clinopyroxene, typically augite (20–29%), with minor olivine (3% up to 12% in olivine diabase), magnetite (2%), and ilmenite (2%). Accessory and alteration minerals include hornblende, biotite, apatite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, serpentine, chlorite, and calcite. The texture is termed &quot;diabasic&quot; and is typical of diabases. This diabasic texture is also termed &quot;interstitial&quot;. The feldspar is high in anorthite (as opposed to albite), the calcium endmember of the plagioclase anorthite-albite solid solution series, most commonly labradorite.

==Locations==

Diabase is usually found in smaller, relatively shallow intrusive bodies such as dikes and sills. Diabase dikes occur in regions of crustal extension and often occur in dike swarms of hundreds of individual dikes or sills radiating from a single volcanic center.

The Palisades Sill which makes up the New Jersey Palisades on the Hudson River, near New York City, New York, United States, is an example of a diabase sill. The dike complexes of the British Tertiary Volcanic Province includes Skye, Rum, Mull, and Arran of western Scotland, the Slieve Gullion region of Ireland, and dolerite dike swarms extending across northern England towards the Midlands, for example Rowley Rag. Parts of the Deccan Traps of India, formed at the end of the Cretaceous, also include dolerite. It is also abundant in large parts of Curaçao, an island off the coast of Venezuela. Another example of diabase dikes has been recognized in the Mongo area within the Guéra Massif of Chad in Central Africa.

In the Death Valley region of California, Precambrian diabase intrusions metamorphosed pre-existing dolomite into economically important talc deposits.

In the Thuringian-Franconian-Vogtland Slate Mountains of central Germany the diabase is entirely of Devonian age. They form typical domed landscapes, especially in the Vogtland. One geotourist attraction is the &quot;Steinerne Rose&quot; near Saalburg, a natural monument, whose present shape is due to the typical weathering of lava pillows.

===Gondwanaland and Australia===
A geological event known as the Oenpelli Dolerite intrusive event occurred about 1,720 million years ago in western Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory, forming curved ridges of Oenpelli Dolerite stretching over . Further west, on the northern coast of Arnhem Land, a &quot;subsurface radial dyke swarm&quot; known as Galiwinku Dolerite, taking its name from the Aboriginal name for Elcho Island, occurs on the Gove Peninsula and continues under the Arafura Sea and on Wessel Islands, including Elcho and Milingimbi Islands.

In the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia, a Proterozoic long dolerite dike, the Norseman-Wiluna greenstone belt is associated with the non-alluvial gold mining area between Norseman and Kalgoorlie, which includes the largest gold mine in Australia, the Super Pit gold mine. West of the Norseman–Wiluna Belt is the Yalgoo-Singleton greenstone belt, where complex dolerite dike swarms obscure the volcaniclastic sediments. Large dolerite sills such as the Golden Mile Dolerite can exhibit coarse-grained texture, and show a large diversity in petrography and geochemistry across the width of the sill.

The vast areas of mafic volcanism/plutonism associated with the Jurassic breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent in the Southern Hemisphere include many large diabase/dolerite sills and dike swarms. These include the Karoo dolerites of South Africa, the Ferrar Dolerites of Antarctica, and the largest of these, the most extensive of all dolerite formations worldwide, are found in Tasmania. Here, the volume of magma which intruded into a thin veneer of Permian and Triassic rocks from multiple feeder sites, over a period of perhaps a million years, may have exceeded 40,000 cubic kilometres. In Tasmania, dolerite dominates much of the landscape, particularly alpine areas, with many examples of columnar jointing.

Early Jurassic activity resulted in the formation of dolerite intrusion in Prospect in Sydney, and quarrying of basalt for roadstone and other building materials has been an important activity there for over 180 years.

==Use==

Diabase is crushed and used as a construction aggregate for road beds, buildings, railroad beds (rail ballast), and within dams and levees.

Diabase can be cut for use as headstones and memorials; the base of the Marine Corps War Memorial is made of black diabase &quot;granite&quot; (a commercial term, not actual granite). Diabase can also be cut for use as ornamental stone for countertops, facing stone on buildings, and paving. A form of dolerite, known as bluestone, is one of the materials used in the construction of Stonehenge.

Diabase also serves as local building stone. In Tasmania, where it is one of the most common rocks found, it is used for building, for landscaping and to erect dry-stone farm walls. In northern County Down, Northern Ireland, &quot;dolerite&quot; is used in buildings such as Mount Stewart together with Scrabo Sandstone as both are quarried at Scrabo Hill.

Balls of diabase were used by the ancient Egyptians as pounding tools for working softer (but still hard) stones.

<text>Annamarie Castrilli is a former politician, lawyer, educator and rights advocate in Ontario, Canada.

==Background==
Castrilli was educated at the University of Toronto, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969, a Master of Arts degree in 1970, and a Ph.D. in 1977. She subsequently attended Osgoode Hall Law School, receiving an LL.B. in 1984. She began her law career with the firm of Harries, Hauser, Loudon &amp; Syron from 1985 to 1989 and was a Tax Partner with Bratty and Partners in 1990. From 1991 to 1995, she ran a private practice as a corporate lawyer.

Castrilli also served on the Governing Council of the University of Toronto from 1989 to 1995 (including two years as its chair), was a trustee with the Sunnybrook Hospital from 1993 to 1995, and was a director of the Royal Ontario Museum, also from 1993 to 1995. She was a founding member of the Italian Canadian Women&#x27;s Alliance in 1976, and of the Women&#x27;s Intercultural Council in 1988.

Her other achievements include serving as National President of the National Congress of Italian Canadians; President of the Universal Youth Foundation; Member of the Canada 21 Council; Member of the Ontario Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Board of Review; a Director of the Legal Education Action Fund Foundation; member of Canadian Friends of Hebrew University; a Director of North York Branson Hospital; a Director of The John Cabot (1997) 500th Anniversary Corporation; a Director of the Integrated Growth Fund; Chair of the Canadian Centre for Italian Culture and Education; a Director and then Chair of the Association of Chairs of Colleges and Universities; Member of the Board of Presidents, Canadian Ethnocultural Council; founding member and then President of the Women&#x27;s Intercultural Network; Vice-Magister, Phi Delta Phi, Osgoode Inn; a Director of The Canadian Stage Company; Governor of the YMCA; founder and member of the Advisory Board of Amani Canada, an organization dedicated to supporting the work of Amani, which runs homes and schools for street children in Tanzania, Africa.

During her mandate as President of the National Congress of Italian Canadians she led the fight to have the Government of Canada acknowledge the injustice done to Italian Canadians during World War II. In 1990 at an evening organized by the National Congress of Italian Canadians, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney apologized for the internment of Italian Canadians during World War II and other acts of injustice directed at them.

Before entering politics, she had written a great deal on multiculturalism, women&#x27;s issues, constitutional, civil and human rights. She had also been involved in the constitutional debate in Canada. She was a member of the National Coalition on the Constitution; Member of the Council for Canadian Unity; a member of the Federal Task Force on Multiculturalism; a member of the Premier of Ontario&#x27;s Advisory Group on the Constitution (Charlottetown Accord) and Vice-Chair of the Ontario Canada Committee (the “Yes Committee”) in the Charlottetown Referendum.

==Politics==
In the provincial election of 1995, Castrilli was elected as a Liberal in the northwest Toronto riding of Downsview, defeating incumbent New Democrat Anthony Perruzza. The general election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Castrilli became the Opposition Critic for Colleges and Universities, also serving as Opposition Critic for Women&#x27;s Issues Critic to the Attorney-General. She was subsequently appointed Chair of the Standing Committee on Social Development and a member of the Tripartite Legislative Committee of the Ontario Government on the Calgary Constitutional Accord, overseeing the Calgary Accord constitutional referendum in Ontario.

When Lyn McLeod resigned as Liberal leader in 1996, Castrilli initially entered the race to succeed her, ultimately giving her support to eventual winner Dalton McGuinty. (See Ontario Liberal Leadership Conventions.)

Castrilli initially planned to run as a Liberal in the 1999 provincial election, but was defeated for the party&#x27;s nomination in York Centre by fellow caucus member Monte Kwinter. The Progressive Conservative government had previously reduced the number of constituencies from 130 to 103, forcing several incumbent Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) to compete against one another for renomination.

On the last sitting day of the legislature, Castrilli crossed the floor to sit as a Progressive Conservative. She won the PC nomination in the Parkdale—High Park constituency, and lost to Liberal MPP Gerard Kennedy in the general election. Kennedy and Castrilli were both candidates for the Liberal party leadership in 1996.

==Later life==
She was appointed by Premier Mike Harris as the director of &quot;Partnership with Ontarians&quot;, an office created to promote the province for international business.

In the federal election of 2004, Castrilli supported Conservative Party candidate Michael Mostyn. Later in the year, she was co-chair of Jim Flaherty&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to lead the provincial Tories.

She is also the founding partner of Castrilli Law, a director of SEADAC Strategic Consultants Inc., a director of the Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians and the Chair of the Educational Foundation of the Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians.

<text>The National Coal Board (NCB) was the statutory corporation created to run the nationalised coal mining industry in the United Kingdom. Set up under the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, it took over the United Kingdom&#x27;s collieries on &quot;vesting day&quot;, 1 January 1947. In 1987, the NCB was renamed the British Coal Corporation, and its assets were subsequently privatised.

== Background ==
Collieries were taken under government control during the First and Second World Wars. The Sankey Commission in 1919 gave R. H. Tawney, Sidney Webb and Sir Leo Chiozza Money the opportunity to advocate nationalisation, but it was rejected.

Coal reserves were nationalised during the war in 1942 and placed under the control of the Coal Commission, but the mining industry remained in private hands. At the time, many coal companies were small, although some consolidation had taken place in the years before the war.

== Formation and organisation ==
The NCB was one of a number of public corporations created by Clement Attlee&#x27;s post-war Labour government to manage nationalised industries. The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 received royal assent on 12 July 1946 and the NCB was formally constituted on 15 July, with Lord Hyndley as its chairman. On 1 January 1947 a notice posted at every colliery in the country read, &quot;This colliery is now managed by the National Coal Board on behalf of the people&quot;. Opencast operations were taken over on 1 April 1952.

The NCB acquired 958 collieries, the property of about 800 companies. Compensation of £164,660,000 was paid to the owners for the collieries and £78,457,000 to former owners and for other assets such as 55 coke ovens, 85 brickworks and 20 smokeless fuel plants. The collieries it had acquired varied considerably in size and output. Coal was mined from seams that varied from 20 to 200 inches thick and the average pit produced 245,000 tons annually. More than a third of collieries produced less than 100,000 tons and 50 collieries produced more than 700,000 tons. 

The coal board divided the country into divisions, corresponding to the major coalfields, and each division was divided into areas with an output of approximately 4 million tons. The board also took over power stations at some collieries and railway sidings. It managed an estate of more than 140,000 houses and more than 200,000 acres of farmland. At its inception the NCB employed nearly 800,000 workers which was four percent of Britain&#x27;s total workforce. Its national headquarters were established in Hobart House, London.

== Formal duties ==
The formal duties of the National Coal Board (defined by section 1 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946) were:

==History==
In 1947, about half the collieries were in need of immediate attention and a development programme was begun. Between 1947 and 1956, the NCB spent more than £550 million on major improvements and new sinkings, much of it to mechanise the coal-getting process underground and by 1957 Britain&#x27;s collieries were producing cheaper coal than anywhere in Europe. The &quot;Plan for Coal&quot; produced in 1950 aimed at increasing output from 184 million to 250 million tons by 1970.

Competition from cheap oil imports arrived in the end of the 1950s, and in 1957 the coal industry began to contract. Between 1958 and 1959, 85 collieries closed. In 1960, Alf Robens became the chairman of the NCB, and he introduced a policy concentrating on the most productive pits. During his ten-year tenure, productivity increased by 70%, but with far fewer pits and a much reduced workforce. In 1967, the NCB reorganised its structure into 17 new areas each employing about 20,000 men. In 1956, 700,000 men produced 207 million tons of coal; by 1971, fewer than 290,000 workers were producing 133 million tons at 292 collieries. 

On 21 October 1966, a catastrophic collapse of a colliery spoil tip above the Welsh village of Aberfan, near Merthyr Tydfil in Wales caused the Aberfan disaster. The tip had been created on a mountain slope above the village and overlaid a natural spring. Heavy rain led to a build-up of water within the tip which caused it to suddenly slide downhill as a slurry, killing 116 children and 28 adults as it engulfed Pantglas Junior School and a row of houses. The tip was the responsibility of the National Coal Board (NCB), and the subsequent inquiry placed the blame for the disaster on the organisation and nine named employees.

The 1974 &quot;Plan of Coal&quot; produced in the aftermath of the 1972 miners&#x27; strike envisaged that the coal industry would replace 40 million tons of obsolete capacity and ageing pits while maintaining its output. By 1983, the NCB would invest £3,000 million on developing new collieries.

In 1984, it was alleged that the NCB had a list of collieries earmarked for closure and its chairman, Ian MacGregor indicated that the board was looking to reduce output by 4 million tons, a contributory factor in the 1984-85 miners&#x27; strike. The strike was one of the longest and most bitter in history and caused great suffering for the striking miners. During the strike, the NCB lost markets and 23 collieries had closed before the end of 1985.

On 5 March 1987, the Coal Industry Act 1987 (c. 3) received royal assent, signalling the end of the NCB and the formation of its successor, the British Coal Corporation.

== Other activities ==
===Research===
The NCB&#x27;s Coal Research Establishment (CRE) at Stoke Orchard in Gloucestershire was founded in 1950 with Jacob Bronowski as Director of Research. It closed following privatisation of the coal mining industry. The Stoke Orchard library was safeguarded after closure and is now held by the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers.

The Mining Research and Development Establishment was formed in 1969 by merger of the Central Engineering Establishment and Mining Research Establishment to undertake research into and testing of mining equipment and procedures. It was based in Bretby, Derbyshire. Following the rationalisation of the NCB from 1985, the MRDE merged with the Mining Department. 

===Railways===
The NCB operated extensive industrial railway systems at its collieries, employing steam traction until autumn 1982 when Bold Colliery ended regular use of steam locomotives. 

===Subsidiaries===
NCB subsidiaries managed coal based chemical products (Coal Products Division) and the production of helmets and other mining equipment (Tredomen Engineering Ltd). In the mid 1970s, the activities of Coal Products Division were transferred to two new companies; National Smokeless Fuels Ltd and Thomas Ness Ltd, although they remained wholly owned by the NCB.
===Films===
In 1952, the NCB established a film unit. The board was keen to train its staff and new recruits and initiated a scheme to produce technical films as well as commissioning films from outside companies. More than nine hundred films were made before the unit closed in 1984.
===Housing===

The NCB was a major landlord, owning thousands of houses rented to miners and others involved in the industry. At the time of the 1984-85 miners strike, it owned around 170,000 houses of various ages. Shortly after this the government instructed the NCB to sell its stock of houses, some of which were bought by the miners or former miners, and others were sold to property speculators.

<text>A memorandum (: memorandums or memoranda; from the Latin &quot;memorandum&quot;, &quot;(that) which is to be remembered&quot;), also known as a briefing note, is a written message that is typically used in a professional setting. Commonly abbreviated memo, these messages are usually brief and are designed to be easily and quickly understood. Memos can thus communicate important information efficiently in order to make dynamic and effective changes. 

In law, a memorandum is a record of the terms of a transaction or contract, such as a policy memo, memorandum of understanding, memorandum of agreement, or memorandum of association. In business, a memo is typically used by firms for internal communication, while letters are typically for external communication.

Other memorandum formats include briefing notes, reports, letters, and binders. They may be considered grey literature. Memorandum formatting may vary by office or institution. For example, if the intended recipient is a cabinet minister or a senior executive, the format might be rigidly defined and limited to one or two pages. If the recipient is a colleague, the formatting requirements are usually more flexible.

==Policy briefing note==
A specific type of memorandum is the policy briefing note (alternatively referred to in various jurisdictions and governing traditions as policy issues paper, policy memorandums, or cabinet submission amongst other terms), a document for transmitting policy analysis into the political decision making sphere. Typically, a briefing note may be denoted as either “for information” or “for decision”.

===Origins of term===
The origins of the term “briefing” lie in legal “briefs” and the derivative “military briefings”. The plural form of the Latin noun &quot;memorandum&quot; so derived is properly &quot;memoranda&quot;, but if the word is deemed to have become a word of the English language, the plural &quot;memorandums&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;memos&quot;, may be used. (See also Agenda, Corrigenda, Addenda).

“The word memorandum come from the Latin, from the verb remind in Latin (memorare). For the decade 1540 meant the note itself. This word was introduced in Spain in the year 1824. This type of document is usually use in the business world, or official documents. 
The items for do this document are the next: This document must be brief, the information that you want to transmit must be clear and concise, it’s don´t need request. 
Finally, when writing a memo, it is necessary to identify the sender and the receiver, to identify the subject matter. Add the place where it was written and the date.”

===Purpose===
There are many important purposes of a memorandum. Bringing notice to problems, and helping to solve a problem through clear and concise communication are two. Memos support decision making and to “help (or sometimes influence) a decision-maker to make a better decision in a particular problem situation than he might otherwise have made without the analysis”. Other purposes that the briefing note can serve include: conveying information; informing decisions, making a request, providing a response to a question, making a suggestion, presenting an informal report, proposing a solution to a problem, or documenting a reference for future use. Memorandums can be used to make brief appeals or give suggestions. These actions in a brief paper can help significantly expedite business actions to make a positive impact in an organization.

===Structure===
As the communication mechanism of the policy analysis process, the briefing note should provide a coherent synopsis of a policy problem, identify different policy options for addressing the problem, articulate opposing perspectives and advocate a recommended option. The typical structure for a briefing note includes a description of the proposed policy; relevant background information; a discussion of key considerations (including implementation concerns, financial considerations, stakeholder impacts, and possible unanticipated consequences), a summary of arguments for and against the policy and a recommended decision. Policy documents that start with a proposal and assemble an argument for that position are more accurately referred to as a government white paper. A government green paper which raises a policy option and is meant to open a dialogue on the proposal is more similar in tone to a briefing note than is a white paper.

A memo&#x27;s concise format is relatively standardized in order to create accessibility to any reader. They open with a heading including a &quot;to,&quot; &quot;from,&quot; &quot;date,&quot; and &quot;subject&quot;. A break in the text would then be followed by an opening paragraph, which would more than likely describe the purpose of the memo. Context is then added to the document, followed by a section of specific actions. Examples could include &quot;You asked that I look at...&quot; or &quot;To determine the best method of promoting the new fall line, I will...&quot;. Actions are followed by discussion, which is typically the longest part of a memo, before concluding the message.

===Quality criteria===
There is no universal standard for a briefing note, but it is generally understood to be a concise, coherent summary of a public policy problem with a clearly articulated logic for following a recommended course of action. ”Next to a political nose, and a logical brain, the most important skill of the good treasury [person] resides in [their] fine drafting hand. The concise, coherent and penetrating note is the final expression of all other talents.” In many governance settings based on the Westminster system, policy analysts are expected to analyze the issue and write the briefing note from a neutral civil service perspective. However, the briefing note “for decision” must contain a recommendation, acknowledging that “to say anything of importance in public policy requires value judgments, which must be explained and justified”.

In addition to keeping a proper memo concise and easily comprehensible, there are a few other important features. The style and tone of a memo should always be kept professional, no matter who the audience may be. This etiquette ensures that no matter who reads the message, it is presented professionally and respectfully. It is common to also see briefing notes with numbered paragraphs, in order to create an efficient and well-organized paper. Since entering the digital age, signatures are not commonly seen at the end of a memo. However, when a briefing note was handwritten in earlier years, they typically included a signature. Today it is still acceptable to sign or initial a memo if the writer wishes to.
