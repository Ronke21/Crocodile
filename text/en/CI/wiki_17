<text>Kanesatake (&quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; in Mohawk) is a Mohawk (&quot;Kanien&#x27;kéha:ka&quot; in Mohawk) settlement on the shore of the Lake of Two Mountains in southwestern Quebec, Canada, at the confluence of the Ottawa and Saint Lawrence rivers and about west of Montreal. People who reside in &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; are referred to as Mohawks of Kanesatake (&quot;Kanehsata&#x27;kehró:non&quot; in Mohawk). As of 2022, the total registered population was 2,751, with a total of about 1,364 persons living on the territory. Both they and the Mohawk of Kahnawake, Quebec (&quot;Kahnawà:ke&quot; in Mohawk), a reserve located south of the river from Montreal, also control and have hunting and fishing rights to Doncaster 17 Indian Reserve (&quot;Tiowéro:ton&quot; in Mohawk).

The Mohawk people historically are the most easterly nation of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot; (Six Nations Iroquois). By 1730, this confederacy was made up of six Iroquoian-speaking nations who were based mostly east and south of the Great Lakes, in present-day New York along the Mohawk River west of the Hudson, and in Pennsylvania. They also controlled hunting territory by right of conquest that extended into the Ohio and Shenandoah valleys.

After French exploration and its beginnings of colonial developments, its traders worked with the Mohawk in villages in the Mohawk Valley. Jesuit missionaries evangelized their people. Some Mohawk moved closer for trade with French colonists in what became Quebec, Canada, or settled in nearby mission villages. In the mid-nineteenth century, after Great Britain had taken over former French territory east of the Mississippi River following its defeat of France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, its colonial government formally recognized the people of &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; as one of the Seven Nations of Canada. These were First Nations who were allies of the British. 

Today this territory, classified by the federal government as an interim land base, is one of several major settlements in Canada where the Mohawk are self-governing; the others are classified under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; as reserves. The reserves include Kahnawake and Akwesasne along the St. Lawrence River, both formed during the French colonial period; the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation, a reserve organized after the American Revolutionary War by the Crown to provide the Iroquois with land in compensation for what they lost of their former territories in the Thirteen Colonies; and Tyendinaga, where the Mohawk constitute the majority of residents.

==History==
By the 14th century, some Iroquoian-speaking peoples, later called the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, had created fortified villages along the fertile valley of what is now called the St. Lawrence River. They spoke a discrete Laurentian language. Among their villages were &quot;Stadacona&quot; and &quot;Hochelaga&quot;, recorded as visited in 1535–1536 by French explorer Jacques Cartier.

By the time Samuel de Champlain explored the same area 75 years later, the villages had disappeared. The &quot;Kanienkehaka&quot; (Mohawk), based in other Iroquoian territories, used the valley for hunting grounds and routes for war parties. Historians are continuing to examine the St. Lawrence Iroquoian culture, but theorize that the stronger &quot;Kanienkehaka&quot; (Mohawk) waged war against this people to get control of the fur trade and hunting along the valley downriver from Tadoussac. (The Montagnais controlled Tadoussac, which was closer to the Atlantic coast.) For a period the Wyandot people (also known as Huron), another Iroquoian-speaking people based north of Lake Ontario, may also have hunted here.

As noted above, by 1600, the Mohawk of the Iroquois Confederacy, based largely in present-day New York and Pennsylvania south of the Great Lakes, used the St. Lawrence Valley for hunting grounds. The Mohawk were the easternmost of the Five Nations. While the Mohawk and contemporary Iroquoian nations shared certain culture with the earlier Iroquoian groups, archeological and linguistic studies since the 1950s have demonstrated that the Mohawk and St. Lawrence Iroquoians were distinctly separate peoples. Historians and anthropologists believe the Mohawk pushed out or destroyed the St. Lawrence Iroquoians.

In the colonial period, the French established trading posts and missions with the Mohawk. They also had intermittent conflict with the tribe and raiding took place between them. Some Mohawk moved near or in Montreal for trading and protection at mission villages, located south of the St. Lawrence River. 

In 1717, the King of France granted the Mohawk in Quebec a tract of land 9 miles long by 9 miles wide about 40 miles to the northwest of Montreal, under the condition that they leave the island of Montreal. The settlement of Kanesatake was formally founded as a Catholic mission, a seigneury under the supervision of the Sulpician Order for 300 Christian Mohawk, about 100 Algonquin, and approximately 250 Nipissing peoples in their care. Over time the Sulpicians claimed total control of the land, gaining a deed that gave them legal title. But the Mohawk had believed that this land was being held in trust for them. 

The Sulpician mission village of Lake of Two Mountains (Lac des Deux Montagnes), west of Montreal, became known both by its Algonquin name &quot;Oka&quot; (meaning &quot;pickerel&quot;), and the Mohawk language &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; (&quot;sandy place&quot;); however, the Algonquin also called the village &quot;Ganashtaageng&quot; after the Mohawk-language name.

During the colonial period, a majority of the Mohawk in Quebec converted to Catholicism. They grew wary of the Sulpicians due to mistreatment and unjust dealings with regard to their right to the land. The Sulpicians sold some of it for settlement, and the village of Oka developed around the Kanesatake reserve. In 1787 Chief Aughneeta complained by letter to Sir John Johnson, the British superintendent general of Indian Affairs, that the Mohawk had moved to Kanesatake only after being promised a deed to the land by the King of France.
By 1851, the Mohawk made seven other protests about the land to the government. Mohawk dissent increased, and their conversion to Protestantism in 1851 was avoided only when the Sulpicians excommunicated 15 activists. In 1868 the Mohawk selected Sosé Onasakenrat as chief at the age of 22. Baptized as Joseph, he had been educated by the Sulpicians in a Catholic seminary and worked with them afterward at Oka. That year he traveled to Montreal to present the Mohawk land claim to the seigneury, but to no avail. Later that year, he and many other Mohawk converted to the Protestant Methodist Episcopal Church, as they were outraged by their treatment by the Catholic Church.

In 1880 Onasakenrat was ordained and became a Methodist missionary to the Mohawk-dominated communities at Kahnawake and Akwesasne. These later were designated as First Nations reserves, primarily occupied by Mohawk. He began to urge moderation and acceptance of a Sulpician offer to buy land for the Mohawk away from Oka and to pay for their move. He lost the support of many followers by this change in position and died in 1881 at age 35. Six months later, when the Sulpicians had completed arrangements for the relocation, only 20 percent of the Mohawk left &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; to relocate to present-day Wahta Mohawk Territory near Muskoka, Ontario. 

In 1910 the Sulpician Order claim to the land was upheld by the Canadian Supreme Court. Kanesatake has been defined by the federal government as an &#x27;interim land base&#x27;, unlike the reserves, which are a creation of the Indian Act.

==Governance==
The Mohawk at &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; continued &quot;custom&quot;, or the traditional practice of having clan mothers select chiefs from clans with hereditary leadership responsibility. Clan mothers made the selection and could remove their support from a chief whose actions displeased them, causing him to step down. Like the other Iroquois nations and many other Native American tribes, the Mohawk had a matrilineal kinship system, with inheritance and property passed through the maternal line.

In the late 20th century, the Mohawk renewed a land claim case to recover their property at Kanesatake. The courts ruled against them on technical issues. The settlement is surrounded by the city of Oka, Quebec. 

In 2001 Parliament passed S-24, to clarify the relationship between Kanesatake and the federal government, and make the band&#x27;s relationship with provincial and federal governments comparable to those of the governments of reserves. Different members of the community have disputed the interpretation of the intent and implementation of this act. Disagreements over this legislation added to internal tensions among different groups on the reserve.

===Kanehsatà:ke Resistance===

&quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; is the oldest continuing Mohawk community today and existed pre-European contact. It was the first community to accept &quot;kaianera&#x27;kó:wa&quot; (the &#x27;great law of peace&#x27;), and is mentioned in the condolence ceremony (&quot;hi hi&quot;) of a chief and clan mother. The town of Oka developed along the Lake of Two Mountains through the fraudulent sale of land of the Mohawk community of &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; by the Sulpician order. The Sulpicians sold off land to French settlers and were the biggest landowners in the region. 

Since 1717, when the Sulpician priests arrived with their Mohawk, Nippising, and Algonquin Christian converts, the Mohawk have contested the Sulpician land claim. They argue that the King of France, Louis XIV, never owned the land and thus the Crown did not have the right to grant the land to the Sulpician Order. 

Included in this territory is a pine forest and cemetery that was long used by the Mohawk. It is still accessible, although it is not part of the Kanesatake reserve. The Mohawks of Kanesatake have tried many times to resolve the land dispute (as part of their land claim against the government and Sulpician mission), but were rejected by the Crown on technical issues.

In 1990, the town of Oka unilaterally approved plans to expand their 9-hole golf course to an 18-hole course and related buildings. The Mohawk protested formally because the development would affect the historic cemetery, and they considered the land to be sacred. The city persisted in letting the developer proceed in spite of protests from the community. In response, the Mohawk barricaded a secondary dirt road leading into the pines slated for development, in order to prevent the developers from cutting any trees. 

After the city gained three injunctions against the barricade, and the Mohawk had tried to gain a moratorium on development, the provincial &quot;Sûreté du Québec&quot; (SQ) police raided the barricade in the early morning hours of July 11, 1990. Oka requested support from the SQ, which barricaded Route 344 leading to &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot;. In the first days of the confrontation, a police officer was killed in an exchange of gunfire with the protesters. 

The SQ were joined by a paramilitary squad of Canadian army and Montreal police. The Quebec government requested support from the Canadian Army, which sent in 3700 troops. This was the beginning of a 78-day standoff between the Mohawk Nation and their allies (both aboriginal and non-aboriginal) against the SQ and Canadian Army. 

The sister community of Kahnawake erected a barricade on the Mercier Bridge at the South Shore of Montreal, in support of the Mohawk at Kahnesatake. Non-Mohawk residents of the area became enraged about traffic delays in trying to get through the area and across the river.

Provincial and national leaders participated in negotiations between the Mohawk and the provincial government. Negotiations between the Mohawk nation and the Quebec and the Canadian governments did not resolve the land issue. The International Federation of Human Rights, based in Paris, France, investigated and concluded that neither the provincial nor federal governments acted in good faith during negotiations. But the Mohawk at &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; were forced by the Canadian Army to remove their barricades. Police and military forces pushed the remaining protesters back until they were confined to the Onentokon Treatment Centre and surrounded by the military.

In the end, the Mohawk chose to leave the treatment center, although they did not formally surrender. Those who remained at the treatment center were immediately arrested, with the men and the women separated and sent to the Farnham army base. Other Mohawk activists were ultimately arrested for criminal acts committed before the army moved into the community. These Mohawk were convicted.

All the Mohawk arrested at the treatment center on the issue of the barricades were acquitted. A separate trial was held for individual Mohawks, who were charged. As of 2019, the land dispute is still ongoing.

===Representation in other media===
*Some of the events and history are explored in Alanis Obomsawin&#x27;s documentary film, &quot;&quot; (1993).
*&quot;Beans&quot;, a fictional semi-autobiographical film written and directed by Tracey Deer, was featured in the 2021 New York International Children&#x27;s Film Festival. Set during the Oka crisis, the film features a lead role played by Kiawenti&#x27;io Tarbell, a young Mohawk actress from Akwesasne. 

===Electoral changes===
In 1991, the people adopted an electoral political system for the first time (see Governance below). Because they do not come under the Indian Act, their choice was still considered &quot;custom.&quot; There has continued to be internal division over how chiefs are selected. In the first election, Jerry Peltier was elected as grand chief and served two terms into 1996.

In 2013 the &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; Health Centre Inc. was the first Indigenous health centre in North America to receive a Baby Friendly Accreditation.

That same year, the local Pikwadin group, a funded initiative of the First Nations Human Resource and Development Commission of Quebec, began a re-vamp of the local radio station CKHQ 101.7 FM. It had become idle after its previous manager died in 2003. In 2004, the station failed to renew its broadcasting licence with the CRTC. The radio station was running under a pirate radio status pending a licence renewal until it was accepted on June 17, 2014. The Montréal-based non-profit organization Exeko assisted with the licensing process through their idAction program. 

The band has had a traditional form of governance under the longhouse, a system that existed pre-contact. This is still practiced by much of the community. Canada refuses to recognize the longhouse and excludes its leaders from any form of decision-making on land rights.

===Governance===
Following the Oka Crisis, the Mohawk of &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot; altered their method of governance, under provisions of the Indian Act. In 1991, citizens held the first general elections for grand chief and six council chiefs. Chiefs previously had traditional hereditary claims to positions through their clans under the matrilineal kinship system, in which inheritance and property were passed through the maternal lines. Chiefs were nominated and could be unseated by clan mothers. 

In 1991, Jerry Peltier was elected as grand chief and served until 1996. He also served as Chairman for the Quebec First Nations Education Council.

In the 1990s, the nation began to exercise more autonomy and established its own police force.

In 2004 and 2005, disputes over the governance practices of Grand Chief James Gabriel, who had been elected three times in succession, resulted in violence and political disruption in &quot;Kanehsatà:ke&quot;. Chiefs Pearl Bonspille, Steven Bonspille and John Harding (&quot;Sha ko hen the tha&quot;) opposed Gabriel. They and other opponents effectively ended Gabriel&#x27;s tenure as grand chief.

John Harding and fellow council chiefs Steven Bonspille (who was elected to the council in 2001) and Pearl Bonspille said they opposed Gabriel&#x27;s attempt to control policing. In January 2004, in concert with Quebec provincial police, Gabriel brought in more than 60 officers from other reserves and forces for a drug raid. These three chiefs considered Gabriel&#x27;s action to be an unlawful attempt to usurp the power of the Police Commission. After 200 community members surrounded the police station, the 67 special constables were forced to take shelter there. Gabriel lost his home when it was burned in an alleged arson incident; he left the community for Montreal. Following his departure, &quot;A long criminal trial resulted in multiple convictions of Kanesatake residents for arson, rioting and other offences.&quot;

Meanwhile, the reserve organized a Community Watch team to counter the lack of a police force. A liaison team was established with the SQ. Political communication lines were opened up with the Quebec government to prevent another crisis like the one in 1990 at Oka.

Following the overthrow of Gabriel, elections were held on June 26, 2005. Steven Bonspille defeated Gabriel in the election for grand chief. Harding and Pearl Bonspille were both replaced as chiefs on the council when six Gabriel allies were elected to the open posts. The Nation operated under a federal trusteeship, while an investigation was conducted of alleged spending excesses under Gabriel. Findings were not conclusive.

Tribal engagement in politics has remained high. In 2008 some 25 candidates ran for seven seats on the council. Steven Bonspille did not run for re-election, having moved off the reserve to Oka. More than 2300 Kanesatake voters were registered: 1685 who live on the reserve territory and 664 outside.

As of 2015, the grand chief of Kanesatake was Serge Otsi Simon. Soon after his election, he spoke in an interview with the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; about the Oka Crisis.

==Education==
The French school board is &quot;Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Îles&quot;. The zoned schools are:
* École des Pins (Oka)
* École secondaire d&#x27;Oka (Oka)

The area English school board is the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board. As of 2014, 55 students from Kanesatake choose to attend Lake of Two Mountains High School in Deux-Montagnes. Kanesatake is in the attendance boundary of Lake of Two Mountains. Mountainview Elementary School and Saint Jude Elementary School, both in Deux-Montagnes, also serve this community.

<doc id="1048773" wikidata="Q1929720" url="?curid=1048773" title="N.W.A. and the Posse">
<text>N.W.A. and the Posse is a compilation album, re-releasing N.W.A and associated groups&#x27; underground rap songs from the Los Angeles area&#x27;s rap scene on November 6, 1987. It is regarded as American rap group N.W.A&#x27;s first but neglected album; N.W.A&#x27;s authorized debut studio album, rather, is &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, released in January 1989. Whereas the &quot;Straight&quot; album was certified platinum, one million copies sold that July, the &quot;Posse&quot; album was certified gold, half as many copies sold, in April 1994.

Originally not N.W.A&#x27;s intended album release, the &quot;Posse&quot; album was released by Macola Records—which was then the Los Angeles hip hop scene&#x27;s main distributor—by collecting songs, mainly N.W.A&#x27;s EP titled &quot;N.W.A&quot;, that Macola had distributed for N.W.A&#x27;s record label, Ruthless Records. Macola omitted the N.W.A track &quot;A Bitch iz a Bitch&quot; (not included on the EP either) to favor party, electro sounds, like the &quot;Panic Zone&quot; track, that led the Los Angeles rap scene until N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Straight&quot; album hit. Months after &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was released the new Ruthless distributor, Priority Records, re-issued the &quot;Posse&quot; album with the &quot;Bitch&quot; track replacing &quot;Scream&quot;.

==Backstory==
Six of the 11 tracks on the &quot;Posse&quot; album are from then-N.W.A members: Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and Arabian Prince. MC Ren and DJ Yella were not yet in N.W.A, however Ren does appear on the cover photograph. One track is of Microphone Mike, later called Myka 9, along with Rappinstine, a traveling faction of the DJ crew World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru, whose core had yielded N.W.A&#x27;s Dr. Dre and DJ Yella.

Four of the &quot;Posse&quot; album&#x27;s tracks are from the Fila Fresh Crew, a rap crew including Doc-T, who soon renamed himself The D.O.C. Dr. Dre discovered them in Texas, where a DJ friend of his, Dr. Rock, had invited him to perform at a nightclub, where the Fila Fresh Crew was performing. These four tracks had previously been distributed by Macola Records.

== Macola ==
The World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru&#x27;, including future N.W.A members Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, led by Grandmaster Lonzo, along with C.I.A which included future member Ice Cube were signed to Lonzo&#x27;s label Kru-Cut Records, a sublabel of Macola Records, the area&#x27;s leading distributor of rap records. The success of Eazy’s single &quot;Boyz-n-the-Hood&quot; prompted Eazy&#x27;s call for an N.W.A EP, distributed by Macola. The EP&#x27;s five songs included Eazy and Cube on &quot;Dopeman&quot;, Eazy on &quot;8 Ball&quot;, and Arabian&#x27;s production &quot;Panic Zone.&quot;

After the release of the EP, N.W.A left Macola and signed to Priority. Macola wasn’t too happy and wanted to cash in on the group so they took the songs from Eazy’s Boyz-n-the-Hood single as well as the N.W.A EP and combined them with a bunch of random songs that Macola had in their library and this resulted in the N.W.A. and the Posse album.

== Cover photo ==
For the EP&#x27;s cover photo which is the same cover used for the album, Eazy summoned N.W.A&#x27;s members to pose for the camera in a Hollywood alleyway near Macola&#x27;s office. Reportedly, some who were photographed wound up there by merely driving or accompanying another. Future N.W.A rapper MC Ren, living near Eazy, although photographed, was not yet in N.W.A. On the other hand, DJ Yella, is absent, due to being sick on the day the photo was taken. (Although he also wasn’t active within the group yet, just a close friend of Dre). 

== Track list ==
All songs produced by either Dr. Dre, Arabian Prince or both.

<doc id="1048775" wikidata="Q3409577" url="?curid=1048775" title="Mayor of Auckland">
<text>The Mayor of Auckland is the directly elected head of the Auckland Council, the local government authority for the Auckland Region in New Zealand, which it controls as a unitary authority. The position exists since October 2010 after the amalgamation of various territorial authorities. The mayor is supported by a deputy mayor.

== Background ==
The position was first filled by election on 9 October 2010 for the establishment of the Auckland Council on 1 November 2010. The Council replaced seven territorial authority councils, including the Auckland City Council, and also the Auckland Regional Council. Before 2010, &quot;Mayor of Auckland&quot; was an informal term applied to the Mayor of Auckland City, head of the Auckland City Council.

Until October 2013, when new mayoral powers set out in the Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Act 2012 came into effect, the Mayor of Auckland had more powers compared to other mayors in New Zealand.

==Role of mayor==
The mayor has the powers to establish their own office, create and dissolve governing body committees and appoint the chairpersons of the council&#x27;s committees. The mayor chairs the governing body and may exercise a casting vote if a tie arises during a vote.

== History of mayoral contests ==
During the first mayoral election for Auckland Council in 2010, outgoing Mayor of Manukau City Len Brown was elected, defeating outgoing Mayor of Auckland City John Banks, outgoing Mayor of North Shore City Andrew Williams and prominent Christian businessman Colin Craig, amongst others. The mayoral office had a budget of $4.1 million and a staff of 18 in 2011. Brown preferred not to use the honorific &quot;His Worship&quot;.

Contenders in the 2013 Auckland mayoral election included Brown, John Minto and John Palino. Brown was re-elected.

Brown announced in November 2015 that he would not contest the 2016 mayoral election. There were 19 contenders for the position, and Phil Goff won with 49% of the vote, against Victoria Crone, John Palino, and Chlöe Swarbrick.

In the 2019 mayoral election, Goff won re-election against 21 contenders with 49% of the vote. Other contenders who received a high share of the vote include John Tamihere (22%), Craig Lord (8%), John Hong (4%) and Ted Johnston (4%).

In February 2022, Goff announced he would not stand in the October 2022 mayoral election. The election was won by Wayne Brown, with 45% of the vote.

==List of mayors==
==Role of deputy mayor==
The deputy mayor is the second highest elected official in the Auckland Council. The deputy mayor acts in support of the Mayor of Auckland. It is the second highest elected position in the council. However, like the position of Deputy Prime Minister, this seniority does not necessarily translate into power. They are appointed by the mayor from the elected ward councillors. The current deputy mayor is Desley Simpson, who represents the Ōrākei ward on the Auckland Council. Simpson was selected to be deputy by incoming mayor Wayne Brown.

Beyond committees of the whole council, the deputy mayor is an ex-officio member of the following Auckland Council committees:
* Performance and Appointments Committee
* Audit and Risk Committee
* Civil Defence &amp; Emergency Management Committee
* Community Development and Safety Committee
* Council-Controlled Organisation Direction and Oversight Committee
* Expenditure Control and Procurement Committee
* Regulatory and Safety Committee
* Auckland Domain Committee
Like any other councillor, the deputy mayor may be appointed to additional committees which the mayor wishes to appoint them to.

<text>Heads &amp; Tales is the first studio album by the American singer/songwriter Harry Chapin, released in 1972. The album contains Chapin&#x27;s first hit, &quot;Taxi.&quot; The album and single both charted successfully for over six months, with both selling over 1 million copies each.

Early LP pressings of &quot;Heads &amp; Tales&quot; featured a die-cut front cover with a square hole in it, allowing the &quot;cover&quot; photo of Chapin (which is actually on an enclosed poster/lyric sheet) to be seen through the hole, creating a three-dimensional effect.

&quot;Taxi&quot; was released as a 45 rpm single, and charted at number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100.

<text>Wanup is a dispersed rural community and unincorporated place in the geographic township of Dill in the southeast of the city of Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Wanup became part of Greater Sudbury on January 1, 2001, when that city was created by amalgamating the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury, to which the townships of Dill and Cleland (along with other townships) were added.

==Geography==
The community is located along Highway 537, near the interchange with Highway 69. It is on the right bank of the Wanapitei River.

The smaller community of St. Cloud, which is treated as part of Wanup for postal delivery and telephone exchange purposes, is located a few kilometres north of Wanup, on the opposite bank of the Wanapitei River, in the geographic township of Cleland.

==History==
Settlement of Wanup dates back to the early 1900s, when large numbers of Finns arrived in Canada. Leaving their homeland to escape the political instability of the time and the spectre of war with Russia many Finns chose this area to resume their primarily agricultural lifestyles. This area was popular among the Finns due to the geographical similarities with many parts of Finland. Another important factor was the abundance of available work from the construction of the CN and CP rail lines which pass through the area. Wanup has acted as base for many generations of Finnish Canadians and still retains a high number of Finnish families.

On June 2, 2013, a rail bridge crossing the Wanapitei River at Wanup collapsed, causing a train derailment.

<doc id="1048798" wikidata="Q5950118" url="?curid=1048798" title="Civil law (legal system)">
<text>Civil law is a legal system rooted in the Roman Empire and was comprehensively codified and disseminated starting in the 19th century, most notably with France&#x27;s Napoleonic Code (1804) and Germany&#x27;s Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (1900). Unlike common law systems, which rely heavily on judicial precedent, civil law systems are characterized by their reliance on legal codes that function as the primary source of law. Today, civil law is the world&#x27;s most common legal system, practiced in about 150 countries.

The civil law system is often contrasted with the common law system, which originated in medieval England. Whereas the civil law takes the form of legal codes, the common law comes from uncodified case law that arises as a result of judicial decisions, recognising prior court decisions as legally binding precedent.

Historically, a civil law is the group of legal ideas and systems ultimately derived from the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;, but heavily overlain by Napoleonic, Germanic, canonical, feudal, and local practices, as well as doctrinal strains such as natural law, codification, and legal positivism.

Conceptually, civil law proceeds from abstractions, formulates general principles, and distinguishes substantive rules from procedural rules. It holds case law secondary and subordinate to statutory law. Civil law is often paired with the inquisitorial system, but the terms are not synonymous. There are key differences between a statute and a code. The most pronounced features of civil systems are their legal codes, with concise and broadly applicable texts that typically avoid factually specific scenarios. The short articles in a civil law code deal in generalities and stand in contrast with ordinary statutes, which are often very long and very detailed.

==Overview==
The civil law system is the most widespread system of law in the world, in force in various forms in about 150 countries. 
=== Origin and features ===
Civil law is sometimes referred to as neo-Roman law, Romano-Germanic law or Continental law. The expression &quot;civil law&quot; is a translation of Latin &quot;jus civile&quot;, or &quot;citizens&#x27; law&quot;, which was the late imperial term for its legal system, as opposed to the laws governing conquered peoples (&quot;jus gentium&quot;); hence, the Justinian Code&#x27;s title &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;. Civil law practitioners, however, traditionally refer to their system in a broad sense as &quot;jus commune&quot;. It draws heavily from Roman law, arguably the most intricate legal system before the modern era.

In civil law legal systems where codes exist, the primary source of law is the law code, a systematic collection of interrelated articles, arranged by subject matter in some pre-specified order. Codes explain the principles of law, rights, and entitlements, and how basic legal mechanisms work. The purpose of codification is to provide all citizens with manners and a written collection of the laws which apply to them and which judges must follow. Law codes are laws enacted by a legislature, even if they are in general much longer than other laws. Rather than a compendium of statutes or catalog of case law, the code sets out general principles as rules of law.

While the typical French-speaking supreme court decision is short, concise, and devoid of explanation or justification, in Germanic Europe, the supreme courts can and do tend to write more verbose opinions, supported by legal reasoning. A line of similar case decisions, while not precedent &quot;per se&quot;, constitute &quot;jurisprudence constante&quot;. While civil law jurisdictions place little reliance on court decisions, they tend to generate a phenomenal number of reported legal opinions. However, this tends to be uncontrolled, since there is no statutory requirement that any case be reported or published in a law report, except for the councils of state and constitutional courts. Except for the highest courts, all publication of legal opinions is unofficial or commercial.

=== Subcategories ===
Civil law systems can be divided into:
* those where Roman law in some form is still living law but there has been no attempt to create a civil code: Andorra and San Marino
* those with uncodified mixed systems in which civil law is an academic source of authority but common law is also influential: Scotland and the Roman-Dutch law countries (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and Guyana)
* those with codified mixed systems in which civil law is the background law but has its public law heavily influenced by common law: Puerto Rico, Philippines, Quebec and Louisiana
* the Scandinavian legal systems, which are of a hybrid character since their background law is a mix of civil law and Scandinavian customary law and they have been partially codified. Likewise, the laws of the Channel Islands (Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark) mix Norman customary law and French civil law.
* those with comprehensive codes that exceed a single civil code, such as France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Chile, Mexico, Russia, Spain: it is this last category that is normally regarded as typical of civil law systems, and is discussed in the rest of this article.

=== Prominent civil codes ===
A prominent example of a civil law code is the Napoleonic Code (1804), named after French emperor Napoleon. The Napoleonic code comprises three components:
* the law of persons
* property law, and
* commercial law.
Another prominent civil code is the German Civil Code ( or BGB), which went into effect in the German empire in 1900. The German Civil Code is highly influential, inspiring the civil codes in countries such as Japan, South Korea and Switzerland (1907). It is divided into five parts:

# The General Part, covering definitions and concepts, such as personal rights and legal personality.
# Obligations, including concepts of debt, sale and contract;
# Things (property law), including immovable and movable property;
# Domestic relations (family law); and
# Succession (estate law).

==History==
Civil law takes as its major inspiration classical Roman law (&quot;c&quot;. AD 1–250), and in particular &quot;Justinian&quot; law (6th century AD), and further expanded and developed in the late Middle Ages under the influence of canon law. The Justinian Code&#x27;s doctrines provided a sophisticated model for contracts, rules of procedure, family law, wills, and a strong monarchical constitutional system. Roman law was received differently in different countries. In some it went into force wholesale by legislative act, i.e., it became positive law, whereas in others it was diffused into society by increasingly influential legal experts and scholars.

Roman law continued without interruption in the Eastern Roman Empire until its final fall in the 15th century. However, given the empire&#x27;s influence on the continent in Late Antiquity and then multiple incursions and occupations by Western European powers in the late medieval period, its laws became widely implemented in the West. It was first received in the Holy Roman Empire partly because it was considered imperial law, and it spread in Europe mainly because its students were the only trained lawyers. It became the basis of Scots law, though partly rivaled by received feudal Norman law. In England, it was taught academically at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, but underlay only probate and matrimonial law insofar as both were inherited from canon law, and maritime law, adapted from &quot;lex mercatoria&quot; through the Bordeaux trade.

Consequently, neither of the two waves of Roman influence completely dominated in Europe. Roman law was ultimately a secondary source that was applied only when local customs and laws were found lacking on a certain subject. However, after a time, even local law came to be interpreted and evaluated primarily on the basis of Roman law, since it was a common European legal tradition of sorts, and thereby in turn influenced the main source of law. Eventually, the work of civilian glossators and commentators led to the development of a common body of law and writing about law, a common legal language, and a common method of teaching and scholarship, all termed the , or law common to Europe, which consolidated canon law and Roman law, and to some extent, feudal law.

==Codification==

An important common characteristic of civil law, aside from its origins in Roman law, is the comprehensive codification of received Roman law, i.e., its inclusion in civil codes. The earliest codification known is the Code of Hammurabi, written in ancient Babylon during the 18th century BC. However, this, and many of the codes that followed, were mainly lists of civil and criminal wrongs and their punishments. The codification typical of modern civilian systems did not first appear until the Justinian Code.

Germanic codes appeared over the 6th and 7th centuries to clearly delineate the law in force for Germanic privileged classes versus their Roman subjects and regulate those laws according to folk-right. Under feudal law, a number of private custumals were compiled, first under the Norman empire (&quot;Très ancien coutumier&quot;, 1200–1245), then elsewhere, to record the manorial—and later regional—customs, court decisions, and the legal principles underpinning them. Custumals were commissioned by lords who presided as lay judges over manorial courts in order to inform themselves about the court process.

The use of custumals from influential towns soon became commonplace over large areas. In keeping with this, certain monarchs consolidated their kingdoms by attempting to compile custumals that would serve as the law of the land for their realms, as when Charles VII of France in 1454 commissioned an official custumal of Crown law. Two prominent examples include the &quot;Coutume de Paris&quot; (written 1510; revised 1580), which served as the basis for the Napoleonic Code, and the &quot;Sachsenspiegel&quot; (c. 1220) of the bishoprics of Magdeburg and Halberstadt which was used in northern Germany, Poland, and the Low Countries.

The concept of codification was further developed during the 17th and 18th centuries AD, as an expression of both natural law and the ideas of the Enlightenment. The political ideals of that era was expressed by the concepts of democracy, protection of property and the rule of law. Those ideals required certainty of law; recorded, uniform law. So, the mix of Roman law and customary and local law gave way to law codification. Also, the notion of a nation-state implied recorded law that would be applicable to that state. There was also a reaction to law codification. The proponents of codification regarded it as conducive to certainty, unity and systematic recording of the law; whereas its opponents claimed that codification would result in the of the law.

In the end, despite whatever resistance to codification, the codification of Continental European private laws moved forward. Codifications were completed by Denmark (1687), Sweden (1734), Prussia (1794), France (1804), and Austria (1811). The French codes were imported into areas conquered by Napoleon and later adopted with modifications in Poland (Duchy of Warsaw/Congress Poland; Kodeks cywilny 1806/1825), Louisiana (1807), Canton of Vaud (Switzerland; 1819), the Netherlands (1838), Serbia (1844), Italy and Romania (1865), Portugal (1867) and Spain (1888). Germany (1900), and Switzerland (1912) adopted their own codifications. These codifications were in turn imported into colonies at one time or another by most of these countries. The Swiss version was adopted in Brazil (1916) and Turkey (1926).

Louisiana is the only U.S. state whose private civil law is based heavily on the French and Spanish codes, as opposed to English common law. In Louisiana, private law was codified into the Louisiana Civil Code. Current Louisiana law has converged considerably with American law, especially in its public law, judicial system, and adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code (except for Article 2) and certain legal devices of American common law. In fact, any innovation, whether private or public, has been decidedly common law in origin. 

In theory, codes conceptualized in the civil law system should go beyond the compilation of discrete statutes, and instead state the law in a coherent, and comprehensive piece of legislation, sometimes introducing major reforms or starting anew. In this regard, civil law codes are more similar to the Restatements of the Law, the Uniform Commercial Code (which drew from European inspirations), and the Model Penal Code in the United States. In the United States, U.S. states began codification with New York&#x27;s 1850 Field Code (laying down civil procedure rules and inspired by European and Louisiana codes). Other examples include California&#x27;s codes (1872), and the federal revised statutes (1874) and the current United States Code (1926), which are closer to compilations of the statute than to systematic expositions of law akin to civil law codes.

For the legal system of Japan, beginning in the Meiji Era, European legal systems—especially the civil law of Germany and France—were the primary models for emulation. In China, the German Civil Code was introduced in the later years of the Qing dynasty, emulating Japan. In addition, it formed the basis of the law of the Republic of China, which remains in force in Taiwan. Furthermore, Taiwan and Korea, former Japanese colonies, have been strongly influenced by the Japanese legal system.

==Comparison with other legal systems==
Civil law is primarily contrasted with the English common law that influenced the legal traditions of the English-speaking countries.

The primary contrast between the two systems is the role of written decisions and precedent as a source of law (one of the defining features of common law legal systems). While common law systems place great weight on precedent, civil law judges tend to give less weight to judicial precedent. For example, the Napoleonic Code expressly forbade French judges to pronounce general principles of law. There is no doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot; in the French civil law tradition. There are regular, good-quality law reports in France, but it is not a consistent practice in many of the existing civil law jurisdictions. In French-speaking colonial Africa there were no law reports and what little is known of those historical cases comes from publication in journals. Civil law codes must be changed constantly because the precedent of courts is not binding and because courts lack authority to act if there is no statute. 

In some civil law jurisdictions the judiciary does not have the authority to invalidate legislative provisions. For example, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Armenian Parliament, with substantial support from USAID, adopted new legal codes. Some of the codes introduced problems which the judiciary was not empowered to adjudicate under the established principles of the common law of contracts - they could only apply the code as written. 

Codification, however, is by no means a defining characteristic of a civil law system. For example, the statutes that govern the civil law systems of Sweden and other Nordic countries and the Roman-Dutch countries are not grouped into larger, expansive codes like those in French and German law. 

In actual practice, an increasing degree of precedent is creeping into civil law jurisprudence, and is generally seen in many nations&#x27; highest courts.

Some authors consider civil law the foundation for socialist law used in communist countries, which in this view would basically be civil law with the addition of Marxist-Leninist ideals. Even if this is so, civil law was generally the legal system in place before the rise of socialist law, and some Eastern European countries reverted to the pre-socialist civil law following the fall of socialism, while others continued using a socialist legal system.

==Subgroups==
The term &quot;civil law&quot; comes from English legal scholarship and is used in English-speaking countries to lump together all legal systems of the &quot;jus commune&quot; tradition. However, legal comparativists and economists promoting the legal origins theory prefer to subdivide civil law jurisdictions into distinct groups:
* Napoleonic: France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Chile, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, other CPLP countries, Macau, former Portuguese colonies in India (Goa, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli), Malta, Romania, and most of the Arab world (e.g. Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, etc.) when Islamic law is not used. Former colonies include Quebec (Canada) and Louisiana (U.S.).
** The Chilean Code is an original work of jurist and legislator Andrés Bello. Traditionally, the Napoleonic Code has been considered the main source of inspiration for the Chilean Code. However, this is true only with regard to the law of obligations and the law of things (except for the principle of abstraction), while it is not true at all in the matters of family and successions. This code was integrally adopted by Ecuador, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Colombia, Panama and Venezuela (although only for one year). According to other Latin American experts of its time, like Augusto Teixeira de Freitas (author of the &quot;Esboço de um Código Civil para o Brasil&quot;) or Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield (main author of the Argentinian Civil Code), it is the most important legal accomplishment of Latin America.
** Cameroon, a former colony of both France and the United Kingdom, is bi-juridical/mixed
* Germanistic: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia, Roman-Dutch, Czech Republic, Russia, Lithuania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Ukraine, Turkey, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand
** South Africa, a former colony of the Netherlands and later the United Kingdom, was heavily influenced by English colonists and therefore is bi-juridical/mixed.
* Nordic: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden
* Chinese (except Hong Kong and Macau) is a mixture of civil law and socialist law. Presently, Chinese laws absorb some features of common law system, especially those related to commercial and international transactions. Hong Kong, although part of China, uses common law. The Basic Law of Hong Kong ensures the use and status of common law in Hong Kong. Macau continues to have a Portuguese legal system of civil law.

However, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:

Napoleonic to Germanistic influence: The Italian civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing German elements as a result of its World War II Axis alliance. This approach has been imitated by other countries, including Portugal (1966), the Netherlands (1992), Brazil (2002) and Argentina (2014). Most of them have innovations introduced by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the civil and commercial codes.

Germanistic to Napoleonic influence: The Swiss civil code is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code. The civil code of the Republic of Turkey is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s presidency as part of the government&#x27;s progressive reforms and secularization.

Some systems of civil law do not fit neatly into this typology, however. Polish law developed as a mixture of French and German civil law in the 19th century. After the reunification of Poland in 1918, five legal systems (French Napoleonic Code from the Duchy of Warsaw, German BGB from Western Poland, Austrian ABGB from Southern Poland, Russian law from Eastern Poland, and Hungarian law from Spisz and Orawa) were merged into one. Similarly, Dutch law, while originally codified in the Napoleonic tradition, has been heavily altered under influence from the Dutch native tradition of Roman-Dutch law (still in effect in its former colonies). Scotland&#x27;s civil law tradition borrowed heavily from Roman-Dutch law. Swiss law is categorized as Germanistic, but it has been heavily influenced by the Napoleonic tradition, with some indigenous elements added in as well.

Quebec law, whose private law is also of French civil origin, has developed along the same lines, adapting in the same way as Louisiana to the public law and judicial system of Canadian common law. By contrast, Quebec private law has innovated mainly from civil sources. To a lesser extent, other states formerly part of the Spanish Empire, such as Texas and California, have also retained aspects of Spanish civil law into their legal system, for example community property. The legal system of Puerto Rico exhibits similarities to that of Louisiana: a civil code whose interpretations rely on both the civil and common law systems. Because Puerto Rico&#x27;s Civil Code is based on the Spanish Civil Code of 1889, available jurisprudence has tended to rely on common law innovations due to the code&#x27;s age and in many cases, obsolete nature.

Several Islamic countries have civil law systems that contain elements of Islamic law. As an example, the Egyptian Civil Code of 1810 that developed in the early 19th century—which remains in force in Egypt is the basis for the civil law in many countries of the Arab world where the civil law is used— is based on the Napoleonic Code, but its primary author Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri attempted to integrate principles and features of Islamic law in deference to the unique circumstances of Egyptian society.

Japanese Civil Code is considered a mixture drawing roughly 60% from the German civil code, roughly 30% from the French civil code, 8% from Japanese customary law, and 2% from English law. Regarding the latter, the code borrows the doctrine of ultra vires and the precedent of Hadley v Baxendale from English common law system.

<doc id="1048806" wikidata="Q1248654" url="?curid=1048806" title="Talian dialect">
<text>Talian (, ), or Brazilian Venetian, or Vêneto is a Venetian dialect spoken primarily in the Serra Gaúcha region in the northeast of the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. It is also spoken in other parts of Rio Grande do Sul, as well as in parts of Espírito Santo and of Santa Catarina.

Talian is mainly a Venetian dialect mixed with Italian dialects from the Veneto region as well as Lombardy and other Italian regions, influenced by local Portuguese.

==History==

Italian settlers first began arriving into these regions in a wave of immigration lasting from approximately 1875 to 1914. These settlers were mainly from Veneto, a region in Northern Italy, where Venetian was spoken, but also from Trentino and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. In the south of Brazil these immigrants settled as smallholders in the region of Encosta da Serra. There they created three settlements: Conde D&#x27;Eu (now Garibaldi), Dona Isabel (now Bento Gonçalves), and Campo dos Bugres (now Caxias do Sul). As more people arrived, the Italian settlement expanded beyond these localities. Approximately 100,000 immigrants from Northern Italy arrived between 1875 and 1910. As time went by, a uniquely southern Brazilian dialect emerged. Veneto became the basis for Italian-Brazilian regionalism.

Talian has been very much influenced not only by other Italian languages but also Portuguese, the national language of Brazil; this can be seen in the employment of numerous non-Venetian loanwords. It has been estimated that there have been 130 books published in Talian, including works of both poetry and prose.

Similar to Riograndenser Hunsrückisch (&quot;hunsriqueano riograndense&quot;), the main German dialect spoken by southern Brazilians of German origin, Talian has suffered great deprecation since the 1940s. At that time, president Getúlio Vargas started the so-called Nationalization Campaign to force non-Portuguese speakers of Brazil to &quot;better integrate&quot; into the national mainstream culture. Speaking Talian or German in public, especially in education and press, was forbidden.

==Current status==

Talian has historically been spoken mainly in the southern Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paraná, as well as in Espírito Santo. Nowadays, there are approximately 3 million people of Italian ancestry in Rio Grande do Sul, about 30% of the local population, and approximately 1.7 million people in Espírito Santo, which accounts for 65% of the local population. According to some estimates, there are up to one million Italian descendants; Ethnologue reported 4,000,000 Italian descendants in the year 2006, but these numbers do not reflect absolutely the number of Talian speakers. During the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; period of the government of Getúlio Vargas, the use of Talian was declared illegal. As a result of the traumas of Vargas&#x27; policies, there is, even to this day, a stigma attached to speaking these languages.

In 2009, the legislative assemblies of the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina approved laws declaring the Talian dialect to be an integral part of the historical heritage of their respective states. In 2009, the city of Serafina Corrêa, in Rio Grande do Sul, elected Talian as co-official language, alongside Portuguese. Finally, in 2014 Talian was declared to be part of the cultural heritage of Brazil (&quot;Língua e referência cultural brasileira&quot;) by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage.

In 2015 Serafina Corrêa received the title of national capital of Talian. In 2019 Nova Erechim was recognized as the capital of Talian in Santa Catarina. In 2021, Governor Ratinho Júnior sanctioned state law 20,757, which makes the municipality of Colombo the capital of Talian in Paraná.

Newspapers in the Talian-speaking region feature articles written in the language. There are some radio programs broadcast in Talian.

<doc id="1048808" wikidata="Q4845152" url="?curid=1048808" title="Battle of Wippedesfleot">
<text>The Battle of Wippedesfleot took place in or around 465 CE between the Anglo-Saxons (or Jutes), said to have been led by Hengest, and the Britons.

The battle is described in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; thus:
:465: 
:465: This year Hengist and Æsc fought against the Welsh near Wippidsfleet, [Ebbsfleet?] and there slew twelve Welsh ealdormen, and one of their own thanes was slain there, whose name was Wipped.

This battle is said to have resulted in much bloodshed and slaughter on both sides, to the extent that hostilities abated for a while thereafter. Some historians believe in a Saxon victory, but that is not what is mentioned in the text. The limited number of casualties is an indication that the battle was a small one. The number of &quot;warriors&quot; involved must not have reached 200 men.

Wippedesfleot is thought to be Ebbsfleet in Kent, near Ramsgate. Its location made the author of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; think that all Saxons had now been driven out of Britain. &quot;Wippedes&quot; is possibly a corruption of Latin &quot;oppidis&quot; in reference to the creek&#x27;s position by the twin forts of Rutupiæ and Rutupiæ alteræ (Regulbium). Ramsgate is the main place upon the former Island of Thanet, &quot;which was given to the Saxons by Vortigern&quot;. It was the very place where, according to the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, the Saxons first landed. Ramsgate is on the North East coast of Kent. Ebbsfleet is close to Pegwell Bay, not to be confused with Ebbsfleet near Gravesend.

The only contemporary Brittonic source, the &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot; of Gildas, does not mention the battle specifically, instead reporting that &quot;sometimes our countrymen, sometimes the enemy, won the field&quot; until the Battle of Badon.

<text>Phillip George Vassar Jr. (born May 28, 1962) is an American country music artist. Vassar made his debut on the country music scene in the late 1990s, co-writing singles for several country artists, including Tim McGraw (&quot;For a Little While&quot;, &quot;My Next Thirty Years&quot;), Jo Dee Messina (&quot;Bye, Bye&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot;), Collin Raye (&quot;Little Red Rodeo&quot;), and Alan Jackson (&quot;Right on the Money&quot;). In 1999, he was named by American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) as Country Songwriter of the Year.

Later that same year, Vassar was signed to Arista Nashville as a recording artist. His debut album, &quot;Phil Vassar&quot;, was released in early 2000, producing five hits on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles charts and earning a gold certification in the United States. He followed it in 2002 with &quot;American Child&quot;, &quot;Shaken Not Stirred&quot; in 2004, and finally &quot;Greatest Hits, Vol. 1&quot; in 2006 before Vassar left the label for Universal South Records (now Show Dog-Universal Music). His first album for that label, &quot;Prayer of a Common Man&quot;, was released in early 2008. He has charted nineteen singles on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Country Songs, including two which peaked at No. 1: 2000&#x27;s &quot;Just Another Day in Paradise&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;In a Real Love&quot;.

==Biography==
Vassar was born May 28, 1962, in Lynchburg, Virginia. He attended James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. While there, Vassar had taken up playing the piano, and eventually found work as a singer in clubs. He was also a member of the Eta Kappa chapter of the Theta Chi fraternity. He then decided to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music. Eventually, he was signed to a small publishing contract, but was unable to land any hits on this contract.

==Musical career==

===As a songwriter===
Starting in the late 1990s, Vassar began writing songs that were recorded by several country music artists. Among the artists who recorded his material were Blackhawk (&quot;Postmarked Birmingham&quot;), Collin Raye (&quot;Little Red Rodeo&quot;), Jo Dee Messina (&quot;Bye, Bye&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot;), Tim McGraw (&quot;For a Little While&quot;), Alan Jackson (&quot;Right on the Money&quot;), and Neal McCoy (&quot;I Was&quot;). Of them, &quot;Bye, Bye&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot;, and &quot;Right on the Money&quot; all reached No. 1 on the country chart. &quot;Bye, Bye&quot; earned Vassar his first American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) award for Song of the Year, and in 1999 he was named ASCAP&#x27;s Songwriter of the Year.

===As a singer===

In late 1999, Vassar was signed to his first recording contract, with the Arista Nashville label. His debut single, &quot;Carlene&quot;, was issued that year, and by mid-2000 the song had gone on to peak at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. It featured a backing vocal from Collin Raye.

The song was the lead-off single to Vassar&#x27;s self-titled debut album, which he co-produced with Byron Gallimore. &quot;Carlene&quot; was followed by &quot;Just Another Day in Paradise&quot;, his first No. 1 hit as a singer. Shortly after that song peaked, Tim McGraw topped the charts with &quot;My Next Thirty Years&quot;, which Vassar co-wrote. Overall, &quot;Phil Vassar&quot; produced three more singles: the No. 16 &quot;Rose Bouquet&quot;, &quot;Six-Pack Summer&quot; at No. 9, and finally &quot;That&#x27;s When I Love You&quot;, with a backing vocal from Jo Dee Messina, at No. 3. In addition, the album earned a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping 500,000 copies. Its success led to tours with Kenny Chesney.

Vassar also co-wrote the tracks &quot;God Bless This Town&quot; and &quot;Live It Up&quot; on Marshall Dyllon&#x27;s late 2000 debut album &quot;Enjoy the Ride&quot;, in addition to co-producing them with Robert Byrne. The latter was released as a single.

===&quot;American Child&quot;===
&quot;American Child&quot; was Vassar&#x27;s second album, once again co-produced with Gallimore. It was released in 2002, the same year in which he married Julie Wood, with whom he co-wrote &quot;That&#x27;s When I Love You&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track served as its lead-off single, reaching a peak of No. 5 on the country charts, and the album itself peaked at No. 4 on the Top Country Albums charts. In mid-2002, he also co-wrote and performed a charity single called &quot;Words Are Your Wheels&quot; to promote literacy. Released exclusively through Walmart stores, this song featured guest vocals from Kenny Chesney, Brooks &amp; Dunn, Martina McBride, and Sara Evans.

While &quot;American Child&quot; was climbing the charts, Arista tested another song written by Vassar, &quot;This Is God&quot;. The song was so well received by test audiences that &quot;American Child&quot; was re-released in early 2003. The re-issue featured &quot;This Is God&quot; along with a cover of Huey Lewis and the News&#x27;s &quot;Workin&#x27; for a Livin&#x27;&quot;, with Dann Huff producing both recordings. &quot;This Is God&quot; was issued as the album&#x27;s second single, becoming a Top 20 country hit. After it, came &quot;Ultimate Love&quot;, which peaked at No. 41.

===&quot;Shaken Not Stirred&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===
In 2004, Vassar released his third studio album, &quot;Shaken Not Stirred&quot;. The album produced Vassar&#x27;s second No. 1 as a singer in the song &quot;In a Real Love&quot;. Also released from this album were the No. 17 &quot;I&#x27;ll Take That as a Yes (The Hot Tub Song)&quot; and the No. 22 &quot;Good Ole Days&quot;. Unlike with his first two albums, Vassar recorded &quot;Shaken Not Stirred&quot; with his road band. Vassar produced the album with Nick Brophy and Frank Rogers.

Vassar&#x27;s first greatest hits compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits, Vol. 1&quot;, was issued in 2006. This album comprised the biggest hits from his studio albums to that point, as well as his renditions of &quot;Bye, Bye&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot;, &quot;My Next Thirty Years&quot;, and &quot;Little Red Rodeo&quot;. The album also included three new songs. Two were released as singles, starting with the No. 2 &quot;Last Day of My Life&quot;, which Vassar was inspired to write after attending the funeral of his friend Robert Byrne, with whom he co-wrote his 2001 single &quot;Rose Bouquet&quot;. The second and final single from &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;The Woman in My Life&quot; (another song co-written by Vassar and his wife), reached No. 20 on the country chart, shortly before Vassar parted ways with Arista Nashville.

===&quot;Prayer of a Common Man&quot;===
In March 2007, Vassar signed to Universal South Records, which became part of Show Dog-Universal Music in December 2009. His first single for the label, &quot;This Is My Life&quot;, was released in mid-2007, peaking at No. 35 on the country music charts. Succeeding it was &quot;Love Is a Beautiful Thing&quot; This song was co-written by Jeffrey Steele and Craig Wiseman, and was previously recorded in 1999 by Canadian singer Paul Brandt under the title &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Thing&quot;. By April 2008, &quot;Love Is a Beautiful Thing&quot; had reached No. 2 on the country charts, and Vassar&#x27;s first album for Universal South (&quot;Prayer of a Common Man&quot;) was released. A third single from this album, &quot;I Would&quot;, was issued in July 2008 and peaked at No. 26. It was followed in early 2009 by the album&#x27;s title track, which became the lowest-peaking single of his career at No. 53.

===&quot;Traveling Circus&quot;===
One week after &quot;Prayer of a Common Man&quot; fell from the chart, Vassar charted his eighteenth single, &quot;Bobbi with an I&quot;. Released in April 2009, it was the first single from Vassar&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Traveling Circus&quot;, released in December 2009. It peaked at No. 46 after eight weeks on the chart, and was followed by &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot;.

===&quot;American Soul&quot;===
Vassar signed with Rodeowave Entertainment in 2011, releasing the single &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot;. This song made the top 40 late in the year, followed by &quot;Don&#x27;t Miss Your Life&quot; in early 2012. On March 18, 2013, Vassar released his twenty-second single, &quot;Love is Alive&quot;. On November 15, 2016, Vassar announced via his Facebook page that his new album, &quot;American Soul&quot; would be released on December 2, 2016.

===&quot;Stripped Down&quot;===
Released on January 17, 2020, the album’s production puts the songs front and center. It features songs written over the past 20 years but never-before recorded and new music, including &quot;This Is Where the End Starts&quot;, co-written with daughter, Haley Vassar. Vassar&#x27;s take on &quot;Postmarked Birmingham,&quot; a hit he wrote for Blackhawk, is on the album. Numerous hit songwriters collaborated with Vassar on the album, including Ross Copperman, John Rich, Don Sampson, and Charlie Black.

==Personal life==
On March 26, 2002, Vassar married Julie Wood, with whom he co-wrote his singles &quot;That&#x27;s When I Love You&quot; and &quot;The Woman in My Life&quot;. Vassar has two daughters: Haley (born August 27, 1998), from a previous marriage, and Presley Jade (born December 4, 2003) with Wood. Vassar and Wood divorced in 2007.

Vassar is a fan of the Baltimore Orioles and the Baltimore Ravens.

He is linked to many southern Chinese martial arts including the five major family styles of Hung, Lau and Choy gar, Lee gar and Mok gar, Ng Ga Kuen/Ng Gar King and Wing Chun.

==History==
Chi Sin is said to have originally been a resident monk of the Original Northern Song Shan Shaolin Temple, in Henan. He was a survivor of the destruction of a Southern Shaolin Temple, situated in Fujian.

Others say that Chi Sin and the other Five Elders escaped the burning of the temple at Quanzhou 泉州 in Fujian. They went their separate ways and Chi Sin built the second southern temple at Jiulian Shan 九連山 (Nine Lotus Mountain), also in Fujian. Chi Sin was a revolutionary who planned to overthrow the Qing Government. However two of the Five Elders, Bak Mei and Fung Dou Dak joined forces with the Qing army and destroyed the second southern Shaolin Temple with a huge army outnumbering the monks 10 to 1. Chi Sin, the Abbot of the temple, was killed by Pak Mei in a duel during the attack.

Chi Sin features prominently in &quot;Legends of Southern Shaolin” 南少林傳奇 written by Chiew Sek (Cantonese) and published in 1993. All of the legendary figures of Southern Shaolin and more widely, southern Chinese martial arts (&#x27;Nanquan/Nam Kuen&#x27;) 南拳 are in some way associated with the legendary figure of Chi Sin such as Fong Sai-Yuk 方世玉, Ng Mui, Luk Ah Choi陸阿采, Lei Jou Fan 李祖寬, Wu Wai Kin 胡惠乾 and Hung Hei Gun 洪熙官 to name a few. Chi Sin has been portrayed in many Chinese martial arts movies.

<text>The Constitutions of Clarendon were a set of legislative procedures passed by Henry II of England in 1164. The Constitutions were composed of 16 articles and represent an attempt to restrict ecclesiastical privileges and curb the power of the Church courts and the extent of papal authority in England. In the anarchic conditions of Henry II&#x27;s predecessor, Stephen (reigned 1135–1154), the church had extended its jurisdiction by taking advantage of the weakness of royal authority. The Constitutions were claimed to restore the law as it was observed during the reign of Henry I (1100–1135).
The Constitutions take their name from Clarendon Palace, Wiltshire, the royal hunting lodge at which they were promulgated.

==Purposes==
The Constitutions&#x27; primary goal was to deal with the controversial issue of &quot;criminous clerks&quot;, or clergy who had been accused of committing a serious secular crime but were tried in ecclesiastical courts by &quot;benefit of clergy&quot;. Unlike royal courts, these ecclesiastical courts were strictly limited in the punishments to which a convicted felon could be subjected; in particular the spilling of blood was prohibited. An ecclesiastical case of murder often ended with the defendant being defrocked (dismissed from the priesthood). In a royal court, murder was often punished with mutilation or death.

The Constitutions of Clarendon were Henry II&#x27;s attempts to deal with these problems (and conveniently increase his own power at the same time) by claiming that once the ecclesiastical courts had tried and defrocked clergymen, the Church could no longer protect the individual, and convicted former clergy could be further punished under the jurisdiction of secular courts.

It was formerly supposed that Henry wanted all clerics accused of crimes to be tried in the King&#x27;s Courts. But this impression, as F. W. Maitland showed, is certainly wrong. A rather complicated arrangement was proposed by which cognizance of the case was first to be taken in the King&#x27;s Court.

If the culprit proved to be a cleric, the case was to be tried in the ecclesiastical court, but an officer of the King&#x27;s Court was to be present. The officer, if the accused was found guilty, was to conduct him back to the King&#x27;s Court after degradation, where he would be dealt with as an ordinary criminal and adequately punished.

The king&#x27;s contention was that flogging, fines, degradation, and excommunication, beyond which the spiritual courts could not go, were insufficient as punishment. The archbishop urged that, apart from the principle of clerical privilege, to degrade a man first and to hang him afterwards was to punish him twice for the same offence. Once degraded, he lost all his rights, and if he committed another crime, he might then be punished with death like any other felon.

==Effect==
Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury (1162–1170), resisted the Constitutions, especially the clause concerning &quot;criminous clerks&quot;. As a result, Henry put Becket up for trial at Northampton. Becket fled into exile with his family. Bishops were in agreement over the articles until the Pope disapproved and then Becket repudiated his arguments. The controversy resulted, becoming so bitter that Becket was murdered on 29 December 1170. After this Henry felt compelled to revoke the two controversial clauses, which went against canon law. However, the rest stayed in effect as law of the land.

<text>Johannes Frederik Janse Van Rensburg(known as Hans) (24 September 1898 – 25 September 1966) was a South African lawyer, and leader of the &quot;Ossewabrandwag&quot;.

He was born in Winburg and died in Cape Town, a descendant of the Loyalist Johannes Frederik Janse Van Rensburg. He received his MA in German from the University of Stellenbosch, and his bachelor&#x27;s and doctorates in law from University of Pretoria.

Van Rensburg qualified as a solicitor and was hired as the personal secretary of Tielman Roos, the Minister of Justice. In 1933, he became Secretary of Justice (under Smuts as Minister). As Secretary, he traveled overseas. In Germany, he met Adolf Hitler, Hermann Göring, and other top Nazi officials. He was greatly impressed by Hitler&#x27;s leadership and the discipline he observed in Germany.

In 1938, Van Rensburg helped organize the &quot;Ossewabrandwag&quot; as a vehicle for Afrikaner nationalism though often at odds with the National Party, which was the main driver of Afrikaner Nationalism at the time. Van Rensburg was the commander general of the &quot;Ossewabrandwag&quot; from 1941 until 1952. Like most members of the &quot;Ossewabrandwag&quot;, he was regarded as a German sympathizer during World War II. In August 1940, the Ossewabrandwag informed the Abwehr that they were willing to launch an uprising against Jan Smuts. The organization said they had 160,000 members and 15,000 soldiers, who had not taken the &quot;Africa oath&quot; of willingness to fight against the Axis anywhere on the continent, ready to strike. There is also evidence that Van Rensburg was the mastermind of German espionage operations in South Africa, and a treason case was built against him. However, the case was terminated after the National Party victory in 1948.

Van Rensburg died on 25 September 1966 in Cape Town, and was buried with military honors.

<text>Kingsford is a suburb in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Kingsford is located 6 kilometres south-east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Randwick.

==Location==

Kingsford is a mainly residential area, situated directly south of the University of New South Wales, which is in Kensington. Many of the residents are students living in medium and high density housing. A large Australian Army depot lies in the east of Kingsford. Kingsford surrounded by Daceyville to the south, Eastlakes to the west, Randwick to the north, and Maroubra to the south,

At the centre of Kingsford, on Anzac Parade and Gardeners Road, there was a large roundabout connecting a public transport system to nine possible destinations via a large number of bus services. For this reason, this part of Kingsford is sometimes referred to as &quot;nine-ways&quot;. Due to construction on light rail, the roundabout has since been converted into an intersection with traffic lights. Kingsford is less than 5 km from Coogee Beach.

== History ==
The area was originally known as South Kensington. In 1936 it was renamed Kingsford to honour Australian aviator Sir Charles Kingsford Smith (1897–1935), as was the nearby Sydney Airport. Kingsford was undeveloped until a land boom in the 1920s.

On 19 December 1936, the coffin of Eileen O&#x27;Connor, who was likely to become Australia&#x27;s second Catholic saint, was opened in a funeral home at 347 Anzac Parade, Kingsford. The body was found to be incorrupt although Eileen had died in 1921. The body was reinterred in the Coogee home of Our Lady&#x27;s Nurses for the Poor, an order which Eileen had founded.

In the 1940s, many Greeks settled in the area, particularly migrants from the island of Castellorizo (or Kastellorizo). Many opened businesses in the area; and, in 1973, they built the Castellorizian Club on Anzac Parade. Kingsford was originally intended to be the terminus of the Eastern Suburbs railway line; but, as a cost-cutting measure, the line was terminated at Bondi Junction in 1979. A new light rail project linking Kingsford to the CBD via Anzac Parade opened in April 2020.

=== Charles Kingsford Smith Tribute ===
In 2010, a tribute was created to Charles Kingsford Smith in Gardeners Lane, off Anzac Parade. The tribute consisted of a mosaic of Smith, a mosaic of his plane, the Southern Cross, and a Trans Pacific Mural depicting the Southern Cross. The tribute was unveiled on 11 August 2010 by Mayor John Procopiadis. It was designed by Masoud Nodous; the artist was Tim Cole. In 2014, the mural depicting the Southern Cross was added. The artist was Annette Barlow.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census, there were people in Kingsford. 46.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 8.3%, Indonesia 4.3%, India 2.8%, England 2.8% and Malaysia 2.5%. The most common ancestries in Kingsford were Chinese 20.8%, English 17.5%, Australian 16.7%, Irish 9.1% and Greek 8.8%. 51.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 9.8%, Greek 6.0%, Indonesian 4.0%, Cantonese 3.7% and Spanish 2.1%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion, so described 34.6%, Catholic 22.0%, Eastern Orthodox 9.0% and Anglican 5.4%.

==Public transport==

Kingsford is the terminus of the light rail Kingsford Line which runs to Circular Quay.

At the federal government level of politics, Kingsford is part of the Division of Kingsford Smith in the Australian House of Representatives. Kingsford Smith has always been a Labor (ALP) stronghold. Kingsford is located within the boundaries of the electoral districts of Maroubra, Coogee and Heffron. In terms of local government Kingsford is a part of Randwick City Council.

<text>An immunotoxin is an artificial protein consisting of a targeting portion linked to a toxin. When the protein binds to that cell, it is taken in through endocytosis, and the toxin kills the cell. They are used for the treatment of some kinds of cancer and a few viral infections.

==Design==
These chimeric proteins are usually made of a modified antibody or antibody fragment, attached to a fragment of a toxin. The targeting portion is composed of the Fab portion of an antibody that targets a specific cell type. The toxin is usually an AB toxin, a cytotoxic protein derived from a bacterial or plant protein, from which the natural binding domain has been removed so that the Fv directs the toxin to the antigen on the target cell.

Sometimes recombinant fusion proteins containing a toxin and a growth factor are also referred to as recombinant immunotoxins, although they do not contain an antibody fragment. A more specific name for this latter kind of protein is recombinant fusion toxin.

==Production==
They were originally produced by attaching the antibody to the toxin using a chemical linker. They are now made using recombinant DNA techniques, are produced in bacteria like &quot;E. coli&quot; called recombinant immunotoxins.

==Function==
The antibody (or other targeting moiety) binds to an antigen on the target cell and the toxin then enters and kills the cell.

==Clinical application==
The best clinical success has been achieved in treating patients with refractory hairy cell leukemia. These patients were treated with the recombinant immunotoxin which targets the CD22 cell surface receptor on these leukemic cells. In two uncontrolled clinical studies, about half of participants achieved a complete response after BL22 treatment. This therapeutic has been superseded by HA22, a slightly modified version.

A recent Phase I study of Resimmune found an 89% response rate in a subgroup of nine patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma. This subgroup was Stage IB-IIB with mSWAT scores of less than 50. The complete response rate was 50% (two of which are over 72 months duration and could represent cures).

<text>SS &quot;Palo Alto&quot; was a concrete ship built as a tanker at the end of World War I. Completed too late to see war service, she was mothballed until 1929, when she was intentionally grounded off Seacliff State Beach in the Monterey Bay, becoming part of a pleasure pier entertainment complex. &quot;Palo Alto&quot; was damaged by the sea, leading her to be stripped and used only as a fishing pier. Subsequent decades have seen her be further broken by the sea, but large sections of her wreck remain somewhat intact.

== History ==
SS &quot;Palo Alto&quot; was built by the San Francisco Shipbuilding Company at the U.S. Naval Shipyard in Oakland, California. She was launched on 29 May 1919, too late to see service in the war. Her sister ship was the .

&quot;Palo Alto&quot; was mothballed in Oakland until 1929, when she was bought by the Seacliff Amusement Corporation and towed to Seacliff State Beach in Aptos, California. A pier was built leading to the ship in 1930, and she was sunk in a few feet in the water so that her keel rested on the bottom. There she was refitted as an amusement ship, with amenities including a dance floor, a swimming pool and a café.The company went bankrupt two years later during the Great Depression, and the ship cracked at the midsection during a winter storm. The State of California purchased the ship, and she was stripped of her fittings and left as a fishing pier. She was a popular site for recreational fishing, but eventually she deteriorated to the point where she was unsafe for this purpose, and she was closed to the public in 1950. Following an attempt at restoration in the 1980s, she reopened for fishing for a few years, then closed again. The fishing pier opened to foot traffic once again in the summer of 2016, but later closed for repairs.

Nicknamed the &quot;Cement Ship&quot;, &quot;Palo Alto&quot; serves as an artificial reef for marine life. Pelicans and other seabirds perch on the wreck, sea perch and other fish feed on algae that grow in the shelter of the wreck, and sea lions and other marine mammals visit the wreck to feed on the fish.

In the spring of 2005, oil found on wildlife nearly two years earlier, killing dozens of seabirds, was traced back to the ship, whose fuel tanks had cracked and were leaking fuel oil. In September 2006, a clean-up project was started that cost an estimated $1.7 million, approximately the same as the estimated $1.5 million cost of the original construction of the ship in 1919. During the clean-up, workers pumped 500 U.S. gallons (416 Imperial gallons; 1,893 liters) of oil from the ship and discovered the carcasses of 200 more birds and two harbor seals inside the wreck.

The ship continued to deteriorate after the clean-up. While she had over the decades been broken into four roughly segmented pieces, winter storms in February 2016 pushed the wreck onto her starboard side and broke her rear half open. On 21 January 2017, another winter storm tore the stern off the ship. On 5 January 2023, yet another winter storm destroyed portions of the pier leading to the ship.

<text>Ras Dashen (Amharic: ራስ ዳሸን &quot;rās dāshn&quot;) or Ras Dejen (Amharic: ራስ ደጀን) is the highest mountain in Ethiopia. Located in the Simien Mountains National Park in the North Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region, it reaches an elevation of 4,550 metres (14,930 ft).

The English form &quot;Ras Dashen&quot; is a corruption of its Amharic name, &quot;Ras Dejen&quot;, the term used by the Ethiopian Mapping Authority (EMA) that alludes to the traditional head or general who fights in front of the Emperor.

==Overview==
According to Erik Nilsson, Ras Dashen is the eastern peak of the rim of &quot;an enormous volcano, the northern half of which is cut down about [a] thousand metres by numerous ravines, draining into the Takkazzi River.&quot; Its western counterpart is Mount Biuat (4,437 meters), separated by the valley of the Meshaha River. The mountain often sees violent snowfalls during the night, but given that day and night temperatures vary greatly, the snow is almost completely melted in a few hours (during the hottest period of the year), for the temperature may be over 5 degrees Celsius by midday. In winter snow falls normally, since the majority of Ethiopia&#x27;s yearly rainfall is in the summer, but if it does it usually lasts for weeks or months.

The first recorded ascent by a European was in 1841, by French officers Ferret and Galinier. There is no verifiable evidence of earlier ascents by locals, but the summit climate and conditions are relatively hospitable, and there are nearby high-altitude pastoral settlements. A small fort is still partially standing at around 4,300 metre SRTM data.

<text>Mount Foraker is a mountain in the central Alaska Range, in Denali National Park, southwest of Denali. It is the second highest peak in the Alaska Range, and the third highest peak in the United States. It rises almost directly above the standard base camp for Denali, on a fork of the Kahiltna Glacier also near Mount Hunter in the Alaska Range.

Its north peak was first climbed on August 6, 1934, and its higher south peak was climbed four days later on August 10, by Charles Houston, T. Graham Brown, and Chychele Waterston, via the west ridge.

==Name==
Mount Foraker was named in 1899 by Lt. J. S. Herron after Joseph B. Foraker, then a sitting U.S. Senator from Ohio.

The Koyukon native peoples in the Lake Minchumina area had a broadside view of the mountains and thus gave distinctive names to both Foraker and Denali. According to Hudson Stuck, the Koyukon had two names for Mount Foraker: &quot;Sultana&quot; meaning &quot;the woman&quot; and &quot;Menlale&quot; meaning &quot;Denali&#x27;s wife&quot;. The Denaʼina of the Susitna River valley called the mountain Be&#x27;u meaning his wife (Denali) and the Lower Tanana Athabascans to the north are reported to have had the same name (Denali) for Mt. Foraker as they had for Denali (federally designated as Mount McKinley), and it appears that the names were not applied to individual peaks but instead to the Denali massif. The mountain, along with Denali, was called &quot;Bolshaya Gora&quot; (&quot;big mountain&quot;) in Russian.

<text>French River, also known by the French equivalent Rivière des Français, is a municipality in the Canadian province of Ontario, in the Sudbury District. The municipality had a population of 2,828 in the 2021 Canadian census. It was formed on January 1, 1999, through the merger of the Township of Cosby, Mason and Martland and surrounding unincorporated portions of the Unorganized South Sudbury District. It was named after the French River, which flows through the municipality.

The borders of the municipality are composed of Highway 69 to the west (the French River Trading Post and French River Inn properties are also included within the municipal boundary), West Arm to the north on Highway 535 (just east of Shaw Rd.), the end of Wolseley Bay Rd to the east (Highway 528) and the community of Monetville to the northeast.

Along with the municipalities of St. Charles, Killarney, and Markstay-Warren, it is part of the region known as Sudbury East. These communities partner together on several ventures, including the Sudbury East Planning Board, Sudbury East Municipal Association, Manitoulin-Sudbury District Services Board (MSDSB) and Sudbury East Board of Trade.

==Communities==

The municipality comprises the communities of Alban, Bigwood, Chartrand Corner, Delamere, Dokis First Nation, French River Station, Happy Landing, Jamot, Monetville, Noëlville, North Monetville, Ouellette, Rutter, Sucker Creek Landing and Wolseley Bay.

===Alban===
The community of Alban was originally established in 1907 as Rutter, named for the nearby railway station in 1907, but in 1937 the community was renamed for Rev. J. Alban Filiatrault. In 1934, the Parish of Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes was created. Jean-Baptiste Rochon donated several acres of land to the people of Alban to erect a church. During the night of February 6, 1953, the church burned to the ground. The following Sunday, Father Oliva Campeau proposed the immediate reconstruction of the church. This time, it was to be constructed with brick and the walls of plaster instead of wood.

===Monetville===
Originally known as Martland, the community was first settled in 1895 by Cyrille Monette (né Alexandre Boisvert) and four other pioneers. It became a municipality in 1906 and adopted the name Monetville. Monetville is divided into two areas; North Monetville and Monetville. &quot;South&quot; Monetville is generally from Dokis Road south to Bear Lake and Shanty Bay (Baie des Chantiers) of Lake Nipissing. North Monetville extends generally from Dokis Road north to the West Arm of Lake Nipissing and Chapel Island, which Highway 64 crosses on the West Arm. North Monetville was settled by the Douglas Family, the Mercer Family and the Purcell family in the early 1900s.

On August 27, 2020, the West Nipissing Historical Society held an unveiling ceremony for the erection of a stone cairn monument in recognition of Cyrille Monette as the founder of Monetville and the first pioneer to the area. The monument bears two plaques, one in English, one in French, briefly describing M. Monette&#x27;s contributions to the development of the area. This project was funded by the Society and several sponsors and donors who helped to make it possible. Cyrille Monette&#x27;s original and real name was apparently &#x27;Alexandre Boisvert&#x27;, a name which he would have relinquished between 1863 and 1871 (Le lien entre Louis Riel et le Nord de l&#x27;Ontario) after participating in the Red River uprising with Louis Riel. Approximately 80 people attended the unveiling, about half of whom were descendants of the Monette family. Mayor Gisele Pageau of the Municipality of French River and Mayor Joanne Savage of West Nipissing were among the presenters. Elder Richard Meilleur of the Métis Nipissing Families shared a tobacco ceremony to honour the ancestors. The Monette Monument is located at 5690 Highway 64 in Monetville (Municipality of French River) Facebook: West Nipissing Historical Society

===Noëlville===

Noëlville, originally known as Cosby, was founded in 1905 with the arrival of settlers in the region. Noëlville families travelled by boat, to the south-west end of Lake Nipissing, to establish themselves between Lake Nipissing and the French River. To pay homage to Noël Desmarais, the village&#x27;s first merchant and the first businessman of the region, the town of Cosby became Noëlville in 1911. Desmarais is a grandfather of businessman Paul Desmarais. Noël Desmarais was one of the first to start his family business in Noëlville.

===North Monetville===
The North Monetville area straddles the municipal boundary between French River and West Nipissing. Designated in the 1970s to aid the delivery of supplies to the Monetville Public School, which was located several kilometers north on Highway 64 from the signposts designating the town of Monetville. Sucker Creek Landing and Chapel Island are both considered to be part of North Monetville, with Highway 64 crossing Chapel Island and bridging the West Arm Narrows of Lake Nipissing at both ends of the island. Most residents of North Monetville simply state their address as &quot;Monetville&quot; even if they do live in the north end of the village.

The Community of Christ cemetery, 339 East Road, has a Canadian World War II hero buried there. Sgt. Wallace Edmond Firlotte, who served with the Lincoln and Welland Regiment during the war, was bestowed six war decorations. Firlotte was one of only a very few Canadians that was bestowed the Order of the Bronze Lion for heroism from the Crown of the Netherlands. This award is presented for &quot;Deeds of extreme bravery and leadership in battle favouring the Netherlands&quot;. The Prince personally presented this Order to Sgt. Firlotte by Royal Decree on December 8, 1945.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, French River had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Government==
The municipal office is located at 44 St-Christophe Street in Noëlville. The council is composed of the mayor and six councillors. The current mayor is Gisèle Pageau.

French River utilizes the mail-in balloting system for municipal elections rather than polling stations. Voter turnout in the 2010 elections was 62%.
The 2019 operating budget for French River was approximately $8 million. The municipality employs approximately 30 staff and has 20 volunteer firefighters.

<doc id="1048896" wikidata="Q5132837" url="?curid=1048896" title="Cliffhangers (TV series)">
<text>Cliffhangers is an American drama television series that aired on NBC from February 27 to May 1, 1979. It attempted to revive the genre of movie serials in a television format. Each hour-long episode was divided into three 20-minute segments: a mystery, &quot;Stop Susan Williams&quot;; a science fiction/Western hybrid, &quot;The Secret Empire&quot;; and a horror story, &quot;The Curse of Dracula&quot;.

==Series overview==
* Stop Susan Williams was a take-off of the old serial &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;. It starred Susan Anton as globetrotting newspaper photographer Susan Williams, who is investigating the mysterious death of her brother Alan, and stumbles across a vast international conspiracy. 
* The Secret Empire was a pastiche of the Gene Autry movie serial &quot;The Phantom Empire&quot;, detailing the 1880s Wild West adventures of Marshal Jim Donner (Geoffrey Scott) who stumbles upon the futuristic underground city of Chimera, which is run by aliens. Scenes on the surface were sepia-toned, while the scenes in Chimera were shown in color.
* The Curse of Dracula revolved around a young woman&#x27;s quest to avenge her mother against Count Dracula (Michael Nouri), who is living undercover as a college teacher in San Francisco.

To add to the &quot;in-progress&quot; feeling of the proceedings, all three series started with different chapter numbers (although this was the first broadcast for all of them). &quot;Stop Susan Williams&quot; began at Chapter II, &quot;The Secret Empire&quot; started with Chapter III, and &quot;The Curse of Dracula&quot; with Chapter VI.

&quot;Cliffhangers&quot; was an expensive production due to three simultaneous production units being required. The hope was that if one of the serials caught on, it could be spun off into its own series, however the show aired opposite &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, the #1 and #2 most popular shows in television at the time. The show was cancelled after only 10 episodes had aired, by which point only &quot;The Curse of Dracula&quot; had reached its conclusion. However, one unaired episode (which did air overseas) featured the two concluding chapters of &quot;The Secret Empire&quot; as well as the final part of &quot;Stop Susan Williams.&quot; American viewers later got a chance to see the concluding part of &quot;Stop Susan Williams&quot; when its eleven installments were re-edited into a single two-hour television movie &quot;The Girl Who Saved the World&quot;. &quot;Curse of Dracula&quot; was also re-edited as two television movies, &quot;Dracula &#x27;79&quot; and &quot;World of Dracula&quot;.

<text>ROOT is an object-oriented computer program and library developed by CERN. It was originally designed for particle physics data analysis and contains several features specific to the field, but it is also used in other applications such as astronomy and data mining. The latest minor release is 6.32, as of 2024-05-26.

== Description ==
CERN maintained the CERN Program Library written in FORTRAN for many years. Its development and maintenance were discontinued in 2003 in favour of ROOT, which is written in the C++ programming language.
ROOT development was initiated by René Brun and Fons Rademakers in 1994. Some parts are published under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and others are based on GNU General Public License (GPL) software, and are thus also published under the terms of the GPL. It provides platform independent access to a computer&#x27;s graphics subsystem and operating system using abstract layers. Parts of the abstract platform are: a graphical user interface and a GUI builder, container classes, reflection, a C++ script and command line interpreter (CINT in version 5, cling in version 6), object serialization and persistence.

The packages provided by ROOT include those for
* Histogramming and graphing to view and analyze distributions and functions,
* curve fitting (regression analysis) and minimization of functionals,
* statistics tools used for data analysis,
* matrix algebra,
* four-vector computations, as used in high energy physics,
* standard mathematical functions,
* multivariate data analysis, e.g. using neural networks,
* image manipulation, used, for instance, to analyze astronomical pictures,
* access to distributed data (in the context of the Grid),
* distributed computing, to parallelize data analyses,
* persistence and serialization of objects, which can cope with changes in class definitions of persistent data,
* access to databases,
* 3D visualizations (geometry),
* creating files in various graphics formats, like PDF, PostScript, PNG, SVG, LaTeX, etc.
* interfacing Python code in both directions,
* interfacing Monte Carlo event generators.

A key feature of ROOT is a data container called &quot;tree&quot;, with its substructures &quot;branches&quot; and &quot;leaves&quot;. A tree can be seen as a sliding window to the raw data, as stored in a file. Data from the next entry in the file can be retrieved by advancing the index in the tree. This avoids memory allocation problems associated with object creation, and allows the tree to act as a lightweight container while handling buffering invisibly.

ROOT is designed for high computing efficiency, as it is required to process data from the Large Hadron Collider&#x27;s experiments estimated at several petabytes per year. ROOT is mainly used in data analysis and data acquisition in particle physics (high energy physics) experiments, and most experimental plots and results in those subfields are obtained using ROOT.

The inclusion of a C++ interpreter (CINT until version 5.34, Cling from version 6.00) makes this package very versatile as it can be used in interactive, scripted and compiled modes in a manner similar to commercial products like MATLAB.

On July 4, 2012 the ATLAS and CMS LHC&#x27;s experiments presented the status of the Standard Model Higgs search. All data plotting presented that day used ROOT.

==Applications==
Several particle physics collaborations have written software based on ROOT, often in favor of using more generic solutions (e.g. using ROOT containers instead of STL).

== Criticisms ==
Criticisms of ROOT include its difficulty for beginners, as well as various aspects of its design and implementation. Frequent causes of frustration include extreme code bloat, heavy use of global variables, and an overcomplicated class hierarchy. From time to time these issues are discussed on the ROOT users mailing list. While scientists dissatisfied with ROOT have in the past managed to work around its flaws, some of the shortcomings are regularly addressed by the ROOT team. The CINT interpreter, for example, has been replaced by the Cling interpreter, and numerous bugs are fixed with every release.

<text>Garhwal (IPA: /ɡəɽʋːɔɭ/) is one of the two administrative divisions of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Lying in the Himalayas, it is bounded on the north by Tibet, on the east by Kumaon, on the south by Uttar Pradesh state, and on the northwest by Himachal Pradesh state. It includes the districts of Chamoli, Dehradun, Haridwar, Pauri Garhwal, Rudraprayag, Tehri Garhwal, and Uttarkashi. The people of Garhwal are known as Garhwali and speak the Garhwali language. The administrative center for Garhwal division is the town of Pauri. The Divisional Commissioner is the administrative head of the Division, and is a senior Indian Administrative Service officer. As the administrative head of the division, the Commissioner is overall incharge of the 7 districts in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, and is aided in his duties by an additional commissioner and the district magistrates. Sushil Kumar is the divisional commissioner of the Garhwal Division since December 2021.

==History==

The Garhwal Himalayas appear to have been a favourite locale for the voluminous mythology of the Puranic period. The traditional name of Garhwal was kedarkhand means &quot;the land of God&quot;. Excavations have revealed that it formed part of the Mauryan Empire.

The earliest reference regarding Garhwal and its pride spots are cited in the Skanda Purana and the Mahabharata in the Van Parva. Skanda Purana defines the boundaries and extend of this holy land. It also finds mention in the 7th-century travelogue of Huen Tsang. However, it is with Adi Shankaracharya that the name of Garhwal will always be linked, for the great 8th-century spiritual reformer visited the remote, snow-laden heights of Garhwal, established a Joshimath and restored some of the most sacred shrines, including Badrinath and Kedarnath.

The history of Garhwal as a unified whole began in the 15th century, when king Ajai Pal merged the 52 separate principalities, each with its own garh or fortress. For 300 years, Garhwal remained one kingdom, with its capital at Srinagar (on the left bank of Alaknanda river). Then Pauri and Dehradun were perforce ceded to the Crown as payment for British help, rendered to the Garhwalis during the Gurkha invasion, in the early 19th century.

The earliest ruling dynasty of Garhwal known is of the Katyuris. The Katyuri Raja of Uttarakhand (Kumaon and Garhwal) was styled &#x27;Sri Basdeo Giriraj Chakara Churamani&#x27;. The earliest traditions record that the possessions of Joshimath Katyuris in Garhwal extended from Satluj as far as Gandaki and from the snows to plains, including the whole of Rohilkhand. Tradition gives the origin of their Raj at Joshimath in the north near Badrinath and subsequent migration to Katyur Valley in Almora district, where a city called Kartikeyapura was founded.

Katyuris ruled Uttarakhand up to the 11th century and in certain pockets even after their decline. In Garhwal their disruption brought into existence 52 independent chiefs. One of the important principalities in that period was that of Parmars, who held their sway over Chandpur Garhi or Fortress. Katyuris ruled Uttarakhand up to the 11th century and in certain pockets even after their decline. Kanak Pal was progenitor of this dynasty. Raja Ajay Pal, a scion of the Parmars in the 14th century is credited with having brought these chiefs under his rule. After his conquest Ajay Pal&#x27;s domain was recognised as Garhwal owing to exuberance of forts. It is possible that after annexing all principalities, Raja Ajay Pal must have become famous as Garhwala, the owner of forts. With the passage of time his kingdom came to be known as Garhwal.

===Garhwal Kingdom===
Garhwal Kingdom was founded by Parmars. Nearly 700 years ago, one of these chiefs, Ajai Pal, reduced all the minor principalities under him and founded the Garhwal Kingdom. He and his ancestors ruled over Garhwal and the adjacent state of Tehri-Garhwal, in an uninterrupted line till 1803, when the Gurkhas invaded Kumaon and Garhwal, driving the Garhwal chief into the plains. For 12 years the Gurkhas ruled the country with an iron rod, until a series of encroachments by them on British territory led to the Gurkha War in 1814. At the termination of the campaign, Garhwal and Kumaon were converted into British districts, while the Tehri principality was restored to a son of the former chief.

The British district of Garhwal was in the Kumaon Division of the United Provinces, and had an area of . After annexation, Garhwal rapidly advanced in material prosperity. IN 1901 the population was 429,900. Two battalions of the Indian army (the 39th Garhwal Rifles) were recruited in the district, which contained the military cantonment of Lansdowne. Grain and coarse cloth were exported, and salt, borax, livestock and wool were imported. Trade with Tibet was considerable. The administrative headquarters was at the village of Pauri, but Srinagar was the largest city. It was an important mart, as was Kotdwara, the terminus of a branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand railway from Najibabad.

During the turn of the 19th century, the Gurkhas attacked Garhwal and drove the rulers of Garhwal down to the plains (Rishikesh, DehraDun). Pradyumna Shah died fighting at the battle of Khurbura. Thereafter the rulers of Garhwal took the help of the British forces in India and regained their kingdom. The rulers of Garhwal gave away 60% of their kingdom for the support the British gave them in driving back the Gurhkas.

During the Second World War, the Raja Narendra Shah contributed his troops and aircraft to the British war effort. In recognition for his services, the British gave him the title of &quot;Maharaja&quot;, made him a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI) and knighted him. Thus his full title was Sir Maharaja Narendra Shah KCSI.

==Geography==

The region consists almost entirely of rugged mountain ranges running in all directions and separated by narrow valleys, which in some cases become deep gorges or ravines. The only level portion of the district was a narrow strip of waterless forest between the southern slopes of the hills and the fertile plains of Rohilkhand. The highest mountains are in the eastern Chamoli district, the principal peaks being Nanda Devi , Kamet , Chaukhamba , Trisul , Dunagiri , and Kedarnath .

The Alaknanda River, one of the main sources of the Ganges, receives with its affluents the whole drainage of the district. At Devprayag the Alaknanda joins the Bhagirathi, and thenceforward the united streams bear the name of the Ganges. Cultivation is principally confined to the immediate vicinity of the rivers, which are employed for irrigation.

In June 2013 a multi-day cloudburst centered in the mountainous valleys of the area resulted in widespread damage and over 5,000 deaths. It was India&#x27;s worst natural disaster insofar as death toll since the 2004 tsunami.

==Demographics==
===People===
The majority of the inhabitants are Garhwalis. The culture of the present Garhwal is an amalgamation of influences from the indigenous population coupled with traditions superimposed by immigrants who settled in the region. A majority of the people are involved in the agriculture, tourism and the defence industry.

===Languages===
Native to million people, Hindi has official status and is widely used in administration and education. Garhwali, spoken by about million people as of the 2011 census, is the majority language in all but the two southern districts of Haridwar and Dehradun, where the language with the largest proportion of speakers according to the census was Hindi. Other languages with large numbers of speakers are Urdu (, mostly in Haridwar and Dehradun), Jaunsari ( people mostly in the Jaunsar–Bawar region of Dehradun), Nepali ( speakers, with the largest concentration in Dehradun), and Punjabi (, mostly in Dehradun). The set of indigenous languages also includes Mahasu Pahari (found in the north-western district of Uttarkashi in the north-west), and the Sino-Tibetan languages Jad (also in Uttarkashi) and Rongpo (of Chamoli district).

<text>An artificial reef (AR) is a human-created freshwater or marine benthic structure.
Typically built in areas with a generally featureless bottom to promote marine life, it may be intended to control erosion, protect coastal areas, block ship passage, block the use of trawling nets, support reef restoration, improve aquaculture, or enhance scuba diving and surfing. Early artificial reefs were built by the Persians and the Romans.

An opportunity artificial reef is built from objects that were intended for other purposes, such as sinking oil rigs (through the Rigs-to-Reefs program), scuttling ships, or by deploying rubble or construction debris. Shipwrecks may become artificial reefs when preserved on the seafloor. A conventional artificial reef uses materials such as concrete, which can be molded into specialized forms (e.g. reef balls). Green artificial reefs incorporate renewable and organic materials such as vegetable fibres and seashells to improve sustainability and reduce energy consumption, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. In some cases, artificial reefs have been developed as artworks.

Artificial reefs generally provide hard surfaces where algae and invertebrates such as barnacles, corals, and oysters attach and spaces where different sizes of fishes can hide. The accumulation of attached marine life in turn provides intricate structures and food for assemblages of fish. The ecological impact of an artificial reef depends on multiple factors including where it is situated, how it is constructed, and the ages and types of species involved. While the artificial reefs allow for coral growth, it changes the ecosystem as the relative growth for different species is not always the same. Studies have found that macroalgal, cyanobacterial groups, and coral that are fast growing, grow in artificial reefs at different rates than they would grow in natural reefs.

Considerable research is being done into construction methods and the effects of artificial reefs. Many of the materials used early on are now considered undesirable. A 2001 literature review suggested that about half of the reefs studied met their objectives. Long-term planning and ongoing management were identified as essential factors in success.
A more recent analysis of reefs world wide between 1990 and 2020 concludes that artificial reefs can be useful tools for restoring marine ecosystems if they are strategically designed to suit their specific location and its resource needs.

== History ==
The construction of artificial reefs began in ancient times.
According to historian Diodorus Siculus, the Romans blocked the harbor of Lilybaeum during the First Punic War against the Carthaginians around 250 BC. They built an artificial reef &quot;with stones and construction material&quot; and put poles in the channels using &quot;large timbers and anchors&quot;.
Persians blocked the mouth of the Tigris River to thwart Arabian pirates by building an artificial reef.

Artificial reefs to increase fish yields or for algaculture began no later than 17th-century Japan, when rubble and rocks were used to grow kelp. The earliest recorded artificial reef in the United States is from the 1830s, when logs from huts were used off the coast of South Carolina to improve fishing. In the Philippines a traditional native fishing technique known as fish nests (natively known by various names like &quot;gango&quot;, &quot;amatong&quot;, or &quot;balirong&quot;), is basically an artificial reef. It uses rocks and waterlogged wood to build mounds inside excavated trenches on shallow tidal waters that attract fish and crustaceans. The mounds are then harvested every few weeks during low tide by surrounding them with nets and dismantling them piece by piece. They are rebuilt after every harvest. Fish nests are often used to capture grouper fingerlings to be used as seeds for aquaculture. Fish nests were in common use since before 1939.

Beginning before the 1840s, US fishermen used interlaced logs to build artificial reefs. More recently, refuse such as old refrigerators, shopping carts, ditched cars and out-of-service vending machines replaced the logs in ad hoc reefs. Officially sanctioned projects have incorporated decommissioned ships, subway cars, battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, oil drilling rigs and beehive-like reef balls.

==Purposes ==

Artificial reef structures (ARs) have a variety of intended uses, ranging from the protection, enhancement and restoration of marine ecosystems to the support of human activities like fishing, recreational diving and surfing. Artificial reefs can be used as active restoration tools to mitigate environmental damage and habitat loss, restore degraded ecosystems such as kelp forests and coral reefs, and promote biodiversity.
In fisheries management, artificial reefs may be intended to increase production of species of recreational and commercial interest, enhance fishing yield, and support recreational, artisanal or commercial fisheries. They may be designed to protect benthic habitats from illegal trawling and restore fish stocks.
They may be placed to protect against coastal erosion.
They may also be developed to support eco-tourism, promote recreational activities like scuba diving and surfing, and mitigate tourism pressure on corals.

The design and construction of an artificial reef may be very different depending on its proposed location and intended goals. A reef that is designed for one purpose may be unsuitable for others. Early attempts to create artificial reefs frequently failed, or at best, met with mixed results. More recent reviews of work from 1990-2020 suggest that a correctly implemented artificial reef, designed to fit its target ecosystem, can be useful as a tool for the restoration of marine ecosystems. Reviewers call for better before/after and control comparisons of artificial and natural reefs, increased monitoring of reefs over their lifespan, and attention to the spatial orientation, complexity, and shape of reef substrate, among others.

=== Artificial reef communities===

On artificial reef structures intended for ecosystem enhancement, reef communities tend to develop in more or less predictable stages. First, where an ocean current encounters a vertical structure, it can create a plankton-rich upwelling that provides a reliable feeding spot for small fish such as sardines and minnows, which draw in pelagic predators such as tuna and sharks. Next come creatures seeking protection from the ocean&#x27;s lethal openness—hole and crevice dwellers such as grouper, snapper, squirrelfish, eels and triggerfish. Opportunistic predators such as jack and barracuda also appear. Over months and years the reef structure becomes encrusted with algae, tunicates, hard and soft corals and sponges.
An electrified reef is an artificial reef where a small low voltage electric charge is applied to a sub-sea metallic structures that causes limestone to precipitate onto a metal frame onto which coral planulae can then attach and grow; the process also speeds up post-attachment growth.

3D printing technology has been employed both to create molds to optimize the environment for target species, and to directly create cast ceramic and concrete artificial reefs. Work has also been done to develop environmentally friendly materials. For example, Archireef has designed 3D-printed terracotta Reef Tiles, which are nontoxic, biodegradable, and have a pH-level that is compatible with coral. The tiles are small enough to be handled and installed by a diver. An installation in Hong Kong reported a 95 percent coral survival rate after three years, more than four times the survival rate of more traditional restoration methods.

Restoration and mitigation actions on artificial reefs can include activities such as coral transplantation, larval resettlement, and gardening. 
For example, the Coral Restoration Foundation in the Florida Keys raises keystone species such as elkhorn (Acropora palmata) and staghorn (Acropora cervicornis) in coral tree nurseries and replants the corals onto degrading coral reefs. Application of such technologies to artificial reefs could help to restore marine ecosystems. A 2023 review article states: &quot;The implementation of artificial reefs to restore marine ecosystems can be well done, investing resources in studies specifically aimed at determining the appropriate characteristics of ARs for each location.&quot;

=== Carbon sequestration ===

There is interest in the possibility that artificial reefs can be used to support carbon sequestration and counter climate change. Coastal vegetation ecosystems (mangrove, salt marsh, and seagrass), algal beds, and phytoplankton have been identified as potential carbon sinks. It is hoped that increasing biomass at artificial reefs can provide another form of blue carbon storage.

RGV Reef, a 1,650-acre artificial reef created in 2017 in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Texas, is being studied to assess its potential for carbon capture. Another study area is located off Juehua Island in the Bohai Sea. Biological, physical, social and technological factors must all be considered in calculating carbon capture flow in aquatic systems. Near Juehua Island, M-shaped artificial reefs improved hydrodynamic conditions for creating a carbon sink, but local marine species had limited availability. Development of active marine management strategies and the introduction of appropriate biological species were suggested as ways to increase carbon capture potential.

In the Caribbean, researchers have found that the placement of breeze blocks as artificial reefs near tropical seagrass meadows can create a positive feedback loop. The reef structures attracted fish by providing shelter, and the fish in turn fertilized the seagrass and increased its productivity, providing both food and shelter. The combination of seagrass and reef structures provided added protection from fish nets as well as increasing biomass in the seagrass meadow. Estimates suggest that Caribbean seagrass beds can provide substantial pools for global carbon.

===Erosion prevention===
Some artificial reefs are used to prevent coastal erosion.
Geometric and hydrodynamic properties of reefs are particularly important in determining their ability to mitigate coastal erosion.
Artificial reefs to prevent erosion can be designed to act in multiple ways. Some are designed to force waves to deposit their energy offshore rather than directly on the coastline.

Other reefs are designed to hold sediment on beaches by trapping the sediment. Reefs are generally custom-designed for each unique zone. Some are designed to support customizable habitat for local target species as well.

===Artificial surfing reefs===
Some types of artificial reefs, such as surfing reefs, do not have ecosystem enhancement as a major goal. Hoppy&#x27;s Reef was an early but unsuccessful attempt to create a surfing reef, off Hermosa Beach, California (1971). Artificial surfing reefs have been created at 
Cable Station Reef (Perth, Western Australia, 1999)
Narrowneck Reef (Gold Coast, Queensland, 2000)
Chevron Reef, also known as Pratte&#x27;s Reef (El Segundo, California, 2000, removed 2008).
and Boscombe Surf Reef (Dorset, England, 2009, closed 2011).

The construction of artificial surfing reefs has involved a variety of structures including concrete, rock, and geotextile bags filled with sand. Life expectancy of such materials varies widely. Geotextile structures have been found to degrade more quickly than anticipated under ocean conditions. Some analysts argue that they are fundamentally flawed. While use of stone blocks has raised concerns about possible safety hazards for surfers, it has been suggested that using stone may be structurally preferable.

In addition to improving surfing conditions, objectives of building an artificial surfing reef or multi-purpose reef have included stabilizing beachfront, coastal protection and coastal research. Habitat enhancement is sometimes considered as well.
 However, different materials are preferred for the construction of artificial surfing reefs and the development of reefs for ecosystem enhancement.

A 2012 review of artificial reefs indicated that artificial surfing reefs performed poorly in terms of their intended purpose and successfulness, rarely achieving primary or secondary objectives of &quot;Surfing Enhancement&quot;. 
For Pratte&#x27;s reef, woven polypropylene bags were used in a first phase, and woven polyester bags in a second stage filling an area of approximately 1600 cubic meters. The area involved was too small to be successful. Even after doubling the original budget, the materials used degraded rapidly, and the resulting remediation cost more than the installation. Mount Reef at Mount Maunganui in New Zealand used more durable containers and a volume of around 6,000 cubic meters of sand. Although somewhat successful in creating waves, it too deteriorated and had to be removed. The Narrowneck Reef was much larger, at least 60,000 cubic meters, and was somewhat successful in its primary objective of shoreline stabilization, but less so in improving surfing.

Several projects in Australia have used stone to augment existing sites. Cable Station Reef added limestone rocks to an existing reef. At Burkitts Reef on the Woongarra Coast, large boulders were broken down to fill gaps in an existing boulder and gravel reef. At Palm Beach Reef on the Gold Coast of Australia, stone boulders were used to adapt the shape of an existing breakwater and protect added sand. Another artificial stone reef, located in Borth, Wales, was designed primarily for coastal protection.

A major issue is that changes occurring in the lee of submerged reef structures are complex, not well understood, and difficult to model and predict. As of 2012, existing prototypes have been characterized as &quot;trial or experimental only&quot;, and predictive models have not achieved &quot;accuracy or reliability&quot;, although it has been hoped that &quot;ongoing construction and monitoring of submerged constructed reefs (SCRs) will result in a better understanding of the processes and refined methods for predicting shoreline response&quot;. Even in cases which were initially seen as successful, subsequent changes and deterioration of structures have led to poor outcomes.

Surfers&#x27; expectations of artificial reefs, particularly &quot;an expectation by the general public of consistent, quality waves during a wide range of environmental conditions&quot; have also led to disappointment. 
Surfing science is a relatively new field. 
The ability to achieve consistency of surfing waves in a range of conditions in natural environments generally requires wave pre-conditioning or large scale breaking
features or both. The scale of early artificial surfing reefs was too small to achieve such consistency.

===Recreational dive sites===
Thousands of popular wreck diving sites throughout the world are shipwrecks sunk as artificial reefs. Some of these wrecks were sunk deliberately to attract divers. The and in Florida, and in North Carolina, and in Grenada draw thousands of divers annually.

In other areas, dive sites have been developed in collaboration with artists as artworks. 
For example, the Museo Subacuático de Arte in the Cancún National Marine Park contains hundreds of life-size statues, offering divers an alternative to sensitive coral reefs in the region. Each statue is made from a plaster mold of a living person, using a PH neutral &quot;marine cement&quot;, by Jason deCaires Taylor.

In Lisbon, 13 artworks by Alexandre Farto (Vhils) will be placed in an artificial reef off the coast of Albufeira as of June 2024. The works are made from parts of decommissioned power stations.

A study in Barbados showed a marked variation in diver satisfaction with artificial reef diving experiences. Novice divers tended to be more satisfied than more experienced divers, who had a strong preference for natural reefs and large shipwrecks.
== Environmental concerns ==
Environmental concerns about artificial reefs include
possible physical damage to existing natural sites in the installation area; 
their potential to disrupt existing patterns of marine life by introducing non-native species and by attracting fish, eggs and larvae from surrounding natural habitats;
their potential to concentrate fish in areas where it becomes easier to catch them, 
leading to overfishing and long-term damage to fisheries; 
and the potential for the materials used in artificial reefs to degrade and cause damage to the natural habitat. This can include toxicity from contaminants such as paint, oil, and plastics, as well as parts of the reef breaking away and becoming ocean waste or washing onto natural reefs and beaches.

===Changing populations===
Many marine organisms exhibit a high degree of movement or dispersal. The fish attracted to artificial reef zones vary from reef to reef depending on the reef&#x27;s age, size and structure. Preferred habitats vary both between and within species, depending on an organism&#x27;s developmental stage and behavior. Environments that are well-suited to larval to juvenile stages may differ from those favored by adults. For example, 1-2 year old Red Snapper (&quot;Lutjanus campechanus&quot;), show a much higher attraction to living in vertical artificial reef structures than older Red Snapper. By ages 6–8, adults return to muddy and sand bottom habitats, which provide a home for the species&#x27; pelagic larval phase. Being aware of how organisms relate to the marine habitat is critical to mapping marine resources and understanding how artificial reefs affect marine processes.
The siting of artificial reefs should consider the presence of existing natural habitats and the needs of species at multiple developmental stages, including the need for reproductive and early stage habitat.

The opportunistic use of shipwrecks and oil derricks as artificial reefs creates a new trophic structure for the local ecosystem. The trophic structure of artificial and natural reefs has been shown to differ strongly. Artificial reefs do not develop the same functions and diversity as natural reefs over time, unless their structure is similar to natural reefs. For example, the Sint Eustatius reef, nearly 200 years old, has developed a diverse and healthy ecosystem, but it has different and less abundant coral species than a nearby natural reef.

As a result, artificial reefs can unbalance the natural ecosystem and affect nearby habitats, in some cases attracting non-native and invasive species that disrupt local ecosystems. 
In 2008, at Palmyra Atoll south of Hawaii, iron leaching from a shipwreck led to increases in algae and a sea anemone called a corallimorph, smothering existing coral to create a &quot;black reef&quot;.

Artificial reefs can show quick increases in local fish population, 
coral reef and algae growth. However, the attraction–production dilemma is the question of whether local increases in fish stocks result from broader-area distributional changes in populations (the attraction hypothesis) or increases in local production (the production hypothesis).
Some researchers, such as James Bohnsack, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), have argued that the amount of biomass found on artificial reefs is attracted away from nearby areas rather than developing there. According to this view, artificial reefs do not increase fish populations. Instead they operate as a type of fish aggregating device (FAD) bringing in fish, eggs and larvae from other reefs. However, there is some evidence to suggest that artificial reefs can be a source of production as well as attraction. A 2022 review concluded that &quot;the attraction-production question around ARs ... can only be assessed on a case-by-case basis for each AR, and
validated after their installation.&quot;
Concentrating fish on a reef makes for easier fishing.
The increased concentration of fish on artificial reefs can make it easier to harvest fish stocks, with the potential for overfishing and long-term damage to fisheries. This has implications for artisanal and industrial fishing management.

=== Debris ===
There are concerns that the placement of opportunity artificial reefs will be abused and become a pretext for disguised ocean dumping. Regulatory measures have been put forward by the U.S. and internationally in an effort to counter abuses, but may provide little protection.
Some artificial reefs have been found to be less stable than originally hoped, breaking into component parts that become ocean refuse, washing onto natural reefs and beaches and damaging them.
In the early 1970s waste tires were used to create a number of artificial reefs. Tropical storms later demolished the tire containment system, washing tires onto beaches, destroying nearby coral reefs and inhibiting new coral growth. On the Osborne Reef off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, storms broke the nylon straps holding the original tire bundles together. As of November 2019, 250,000 of an estimated 700,000 tires have been removed. 
France has begun removing its tire reefs. The Ocean Conservancy now includes tire removal during the International Coastal Cleanup in September of each year.
Since 2021, 4Ocean has added collecting tires from the bottom to their cleanup operations as well.

Some attempts to construct artificial surfing reefs have also been problematic. A number of early surfing installations used geotextile bags filled with sand which degraded more quickly than anticipated. Cases such as Pratte&#x27;s Reef in California and Mount Reef at Mount Maunganui in New Zealand have required extensive remediation work to remove materials. In some cases, remediation has cost more than the original installation. It has been argued that this approach to reef construction is fundamentally flawed.

===Toxicity===
Artificial reefs, particularly opportunistic ones involving materials that were not originally intended for marine use, can degrade and cause damage to the natural habitat. 
If inappropriate materials are used in an artificial reef, they can interfere with the growth of algae which provide a food source for coral, causing the coral to die.

PVCs, 
plastics,
oil,
paint, asbestos, iron and other rusting metal, can release toxic contaminants such as Poly-chlorinated biphenols (PCBs) and heavy metals ( Pb, Cu, Ni, Cd, Zn, Ag, and Hg ).
Toxic materials can potentially enter the food chain and affect it at all levels, including fish and humans. However, consumption of seafood from artificial reefs and wrecks is considered unlikely to pose a long-term health risk for humans at average levels of consumption, with the exception of urchins and other grazing shellfish which should be avoided.

International recommendations state that artificial reefs should use inert materials. Under the 2009 &quot;Specific Guidelines for Assessment of Inert, Inorganic Geological Material&quot; developed by the London Convention and Protocol/UNEP, inert materials cannot cause contamination through leaching, physical and chemical deterioration, or biological activity.

Attempts continue to be made to create stable waste-based materials that will not pose a hazard, for use in artificial reefs. For example, oil and coal fly ash have been stabilized with cement and lime to create experimental artificial reef blocks. However, as with the use of tires, there continue to be environmental concerns about the potential for leaching.

In the United States, best practices for preparing vessels for use in artificial reefs include assuming that divers may access all locations, removing potential hazards to divers, removing all polluting or toxic materials, including PCBs (in compliance with applicable water quality standards for class III ocean waters), and clearing debris and floatables.
However, if materials over the pollutant threshold are too difficult to remove, permission to bypass their removal can be given by the EPA, as happened in the case of the ex-&quot;USS Oriskany&quot;. In spite of spending $20 million to decontaminate the vessel, the ship still contained an estimated 700 pounds of PCBs when it was sunk in 2006. Subsequent testing by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission over a four-year period found elevated levels of PCBs in fish living in the ship&#x27;s &quot;reef&quot;.

Off the coast of California, an artificial reef has been constructed to lure fish away from a toxic site. Over 35 years, the Montrose Chemical Corporation of California, a maker of DDT, improperly disposed of toxic chemical waste through the sewer system and by dumping barrels of waste into the ocean. As part of remediation efforts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 70,000 tons of quarry rock were placed on the ocean bottom nearer the beach in 2020, creating a new habitat to attract fish and kelp to a safer area.

==Examples==

===Florida===
Florida is the site of many artificial reefs, many created from deliberately sunken ships, including Coast Guard cutters Duane and Bibb and the U.S. Navy landing ship Spiegel Grove.

====Osborne Reef====
In the early 1970s, more than 2,000,000 used vehicle tires were dumped off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida to form an artificial reef. However, the tires were not properly secured to the reef structures, and ocean currents broke them loose, sending them crashing into the developing reef and its natural neighbors.

====Neptune Reef====
Neptune Memorial Reef was originally conceived as an art project called The Atlantis Reef Project and was envisioned and created by Gary Levine and Kim Brandell. Burial at sea became a way of financing the project. As of 2011, about 200 &quot;placements&quot; had occurred. Cremated remains are mixed with concrete and either encased in columns or molded into sea-star, brain-coral, castings of lions or other shapes before entering the water.

====Ex-USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot;====
In 1921 the US battleship was scuttled in shallow water off the coast of Pensacola, Florida and then used as a target for experimental artillery. In 1956 the ship was declared the property of the state of Florida by the Florida Supreme Court. Since 1993 the wreck has been a Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve and is included in the National Register of Historic Places. She serves as an artificial reef and recreational dive site.

====Ex-USS &quot;Oriskany&quot;====

The world&#x27;s largest artificial reef was created by sinking of the 44,000 ton aircraft carrier off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, in 2006.

====Ex-USNS &quot;Hoyt S. Vandenberg&quot;====
The second-largest artificial reef is USNS &quot;Hoyt S. Vandenberg&quot;, a former World War II era troop transport that served as a spacecraft-tracking ship after the war. The Vandenberg was scuttled seven miles off Key West on May 27, 2009, in of clear water. Supporters expected the ship to draw recreational divers away from natural reefs, allowing those reefs to recover from damage from overuse.

====Ex-USS &quot;Spiegel Grove&quot;====

The ex-USS is located on Dixie Shoal, off the Florida Keys in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. 
Her location is .

===SS &quot;United States&quot; (Planned)===
The SS United States is currently on her final voyage to Mobile, Alabama. In Mobile, she will have any hazardous materials and valuable items stripped. Once after that, she will make her voyage, and off the coast of Okaloosa County, Florida, specifically Destin-Fort Walton Beach. She will be sunk by flooding parts of the ship, until she fully sinks. Once she fully sinks, she will become the worlds largest artificial reef, being visible as high as 60 feet and as low as 180 feet, with her funnels removed. As of February 19th, the SS United States has finally departed Philadelphia, heading for Mobile. 

===Georgia===
In 1970, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) began building a network of artificial reefs to provide habitats for game fish. Georgia generally lacks natural coral reefs because the ocean floor off the coast is generally too sandy and too low-sloping to promote coral growth. These artificial reefs attract a huge variety of organisms; according to marine ecologist from Georgia Southern University, &quot;the diversity rivals natural coral reefs.&quot;

====L Reef====
L Reef was established in 1976. It is located roughly east of Ossabaw Island and is below the ocean&#x27;s surface. It contains a variety of different debris, including New York City subway cars, M-60 tanks formerly used by the United States Army, and concrete culverts. In 2023, on the 21st of December, the DNR unloaded two retired railcars from the Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority. In August 2024, divers discovered soft coral growing on the railcars and counted nine species of game fish.

===North Carolina===

====Ex-USS &quot;Yancey&quot;====
 was sunk as an artificial reef off Morehead City, North Carolina in 1990, as AR-302. She is lying on her starboard side at a depth of 

====Ex-USCGC &quot;Spar&quot;====

 was scuttled in June 2004 by Captain Tim Mullane in of water, off Morehead City, North Carolina, where she serves as an artificial reef.

====Ex-USS &quot;Indra&quot;====

 was sunk as an artificial reef, 4 August 1992 in of water.Its coordinates are .

====Ex-USS &quot;Aeolus&quot;====
 was sunk to form an artificial reef in August 1988 as AR-305. The ex-&quot;Aeolus&quot;, is located 18.3 nautical miles from Beaufort Inlet Sea Buoy in of water.

===Delaware===

====Redbird Reef====
In the late 2000s, the New York City Transit Authority decided to retire an outdated fleet of subway cars to make room for new R142 and R142A trains. The obsolete subway cars, (nicknamed &quot;Redbirds&quot;), had run on the A Division (former Interborough Rapid Transit Company routes) of the New York City Subway system for 40 years. Each car was stripped, decontaminated, loaded on a barge, and sunk in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Delaware, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Some cars had number plates removed because of rust, which were then auctioned off on eBay. A total of 1,200 subway cars were sunk for this project.

In September 2007, the NYCTA approved a further contract with Weeks Marine worth $6 million, to send 1,600 of its retired subway cars to be used as artificial reefs. The old models were sheathed in stainless steel, except for the fiberglass reinforced plastic front ends, which were removed before sinking. The retired fleet included old work trains and cars that were badly damaged beyond repair.

=== Canada ===

==== British Columbia ====
In 2006, a Boeing 737-200 that was deemed no longer airworthy by Air Canada was sunk by the Artificial Reef Society of British Columbia.

===Mexico===

====Cancun Underwater Museum====
Since November 2009, artist Jason deCaires Taylor has created more than 400 life size sculptures off the coast of Cancun, Mexico at the Cancun Underwater Museum. The coral reefs in this region suffered heavy degradation due to repetitive hurricane abuse. This project was funded by The National Marine Park and the Cancun Nautical Association. It was designed to emulate coral reefs using a neutral ph clay. Taylor constructed unique settings depicting daily activities ranging from a man watching TV to a 1970s replica of a Volkswagen Beetle. This artificial reef relieved pressure from the nearby Manchones Reef.

===Australia===
Since the late 1990s, the Australian government has been providing decommissioned warships for use as artificial reefs for recreational scuba diving. So far, seven ships have been sunk:

* at Dunsborough in Western Australia during December 1997.
* at Albany in Western Australia during November 2001.
* in Yankalilla Bay in South Australia during November 2002.
* off the Sunshine Coast in Queensland during July 2005.
* at a site west of the entrance to Port Phillip Bay in Victoria during October 2009.
* off Terrigal on the New South Wales Central Coast during April 2011
* off Hervey Bay on the Queensland Coast on 29 June 2018 

Cooper Reef is a purpose-built artificial reef off the coast of Esperance, Western Australia. It is at a depth of 30m and consists of 128 dome-like concrete modules designed to attract fish and enhance fish stocks, thereby creating new fishing and recreation opportunities for tourists, anglers and local families.

===Costa Rica===
At Playa Hermosa, the Playa Hermosa Artificial Reef Project has created an artificial reef using discarded porcelain insulators.

===Curacao===
On Curaçao, Secore International has created 12 artificial reefs using the cost-effective technique with small tetrapod-shaped concrete structures, seeded with coral larvae.

===Canary Islands===
Near Playa de Garcey on Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands, the SS &quot;America&quot; (1939) lays as a more recent artificial reef. In 1994, while traveling to Thailand, the tugboats&#x27; cable on bringing the ship to Thailand, where she would be converted into a floating hotel, snapped. After multiple attempts to re-connect the cables, they were unsuccessful. The next day, she landed off the coast of the Canary Islands, where she deteriorated for years. In 1995, due to the rough waves, she split into two, both sides sank slowly. By 2007, atleast 5% of the ship was visible. In 2024, nothing was left, where it had become an artificial reef.

===Saba and Statia===
The AROSSTA project is located in the Caribbean Dutch islands of St. Eustatius and Saba. Based on comparisons of the effectiveness of reef balls, layered cakes, and rock for artificial reefs, researchers have developed MOREEF (Modular Restoration Reef) to provide a more complex internal structure and increase shelter availability.

===Gibraltar===
The Gibraltar Reef was first proposed by Eric Shaw in 1973. Initial experiments with tires proved unsuccessful as the tires were swept away by currents or buried underneath sand. In 1974, boats from local marinas and the Gibraltar Port Authority were donated. The first two were barges that were sunk in Camp Bay. In 2006, a 65-ton wooden boat, &quot;True Joy&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;) was sunk there as well.

Shaw helped to found the Helping Hand Trust in 1994. The Trust works with researchers from around the world to expand the reef and to conserve, protect and monitor the natural world. The artificial reef, which contains more than 30 scuttled and wrecked vessels, was the first to be constructed in Europe. It continues to be one of the largest.

Expansion of the Artificial Reef halted after the cargo vessel &#x27;New Flame&#x27; collided with the &#x27;Torm Gertrud&#x27; and sank in an area known as &#x27;Los Picos&#x27;. Los Picos was one of two natural reefs within Gibraltar&#x27;s EU registered area of special interest, with a high level of biodiversity. After two years of salvage work, it was determined that attempting to remove the remaining keel and bottom would harm the natural reef. Authorities decided to leave the rest where it was.

In 2013, more than 70 concrete blocks were sunk by the government of Gibraltar (independent of Eric Shaw&#x27;s trust), each one square meter in size with protruding metal bars. This led to heated debate between the United Kingdom and Spain, with Gibraltar accusing Spain of over forty incursions into their waters per month and Spain accusing Gibraltar of including metal bars in the reef to stop Spanish fishermen trawling the seabed for fish. The dropping led to a diplomatic conflict between the two countries because Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory.
By 2015, Shaw reported that there was &quot;all kinds of life in the new reef from microbiological species to conger and moray eels&quot;.

===India===

====Temple Reef====
Experimentation with artificial reef structures at the Temple reef dive site off the coast of Pondicherry, India began as early as 2013. The diving centre Temple Adventures built a Temple-shaped structure in 2015 at a depth of , using recycled materials such as concrete, rocks, trees, palms, and iron bars.

The Temple Reef Foundation was founded in 2017 to support marine conservation and the further development of artificial surfing reefs in the area. In 2019 Bennington&#x27;s Reef was added to the Temple reef dive site using a patented design for cement-dolomite blocks. The initial block was 3D printed, and further blocks were built using molded frames. In 2020, the project began testing a new block prototype that uses eggshell waste, sand, pebbles, and cement, stabilized with iron rebar.

===Dubai===

Pearl of Dubai is an art-inspired Lost City off the coast of Dubai. The site encompasses five acres and is located at the World Islands. At a depth of , the site is designed as an ancient lost city, complete with temples and statues using regional design cues from 800 BC. In 2023, designs for the world&#x27;s largest ocean restoration and ecotourism project was unveiled in Dubai. The project named Dubai Reefs, aims to use 3D printing technology to create the world&#x27;s largest artificial reef.

===Aqaba, Jordan===

Jordan made an under-water military vehicles museum, which is intended to form an artificial reef over time.

===Philippines===
Underwater Chocolate Hills is an artificial reef project undertaken by Spindrift Reefs Dive Center off the coast of Panglao Island in the Philippines. It consists of broken coral harvested by local divers, who attach it to wire structures. The structures are built in the same shape as the Chocolate Hills, which can be found in the Bohol Region. The intent is to create a new dive site and new marine habitat.

===Lebanon===

In 2018, the Lebanese Army donated 10 stripped tanks to an NGO and sunk them 3 km away from the coast of Sidon, South Lebanon.

=== Malta ===
Following a gas explosion that occurred on 3 February 1995, the Libyan-owned motor tanker Um El Faroud was scuttled off the coast of Malta as an artificial reef.

<text>New Tehri is a city and a municipal board in Tehri Garhwal District in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is the administrative headquarters of Tehri Garhwal District. This urban municipality area has 11 wards, from Vidhi Vihar to Vishwakarma Puram (Koti colony).

Seema Krishali is the chairperson of Nagar Palika Tehri, and is the first female chairperson of Tehri. She won as an independent. Tehri is represented by the Tehri assembly seat of Uttarakhand and the Tehri Lok Sabha seat of India, which are represented by Dhan Singh Negi (Bhartiya Janta Party) and Mala Rajya Laxmi Shah (Bhartiya Janta Party) respectively.

==History==
The old town of Tehri sat at the confluence of the Bhagirathi and Bhilangna rivers. It was formerly known as Ganeshprayag. It adjoined the district of Garhwal, and its topographical features were similar. It contained the sources of both the Ganges and the Yamuna, which are visited by thousands of Hindu pilgrims.

Construction of the Tehri Dam totally submerged the old town of Tehri, and the population was shifted to the town of New Tehri. The town is famous for being the site of the protests against the dam by Sundarlal Bahuguna and his followers during the Chipko movement. Currently, the old Tehri town no longer exists.

==Demographics==
 India census, Tehri had a population of 24,014. Males constitute 65% of the population and females 35%. Tehri has an average literacy rate of 78%, higher than the national average of 74%: male literacy is 81% and female literacy is 71%. In Tehri, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age.

==Tourist places==

The most visited places that are actively maintained are Devi Kunjapuri Temple, Chandrabadani Devi, Shri Adinath Digambar Jain Mandir, Mahasar Taal, Sehstra Taal, and Khatling Glacier. Some areas of Tehri are view-able but neglected by the Uttrakhand government, including Panwali Kantha, Belhbagi Bugyal, and Khait parvat. Panwali Kantha is one of the most popular treks in Uttarakhand which is listed by Outlook Traveller in their write-up. These places have the potential to attract tourists for trekking and mountaineering. The new district headquarters at New Tehri can be looked at as a future tourist spot where views of Tehri Lake can be seen. Dobra Chanti Bridge is one of the major tourist attraction due to the lightening work. It is India&#x27;s longest motorable single lane suspension bridge with 440 meter long way from Dobra to Chanti. Located in the proximity of Tehri Garhwal, Narendranagar is a tourist attraction where visitors can see the River Ganga and Doon valley.

== In Literature ==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration on Davis Cox&#x27;s picture &#x27;The Grass-Rope Bridge at Teree, in the Province of Gurwall&#x27;, refers back to the time when the hill country of this province was resorted to for recuperation by Europeans suffering from the heat of the plains.

<doc id="1048928" wikidata="Q1135783" url="?curid=1048928" title="Cory Gibbs">
<text>Cory Gibbs (born January 14, 1980) is an American former soccer player. A defender, played professionally for clubs in Germany, the Netherlands and England. He also played 19 international matches for the U.S. national soccer team, including at the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

==Career==

===College and amateur===
Gibbs was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He played college soccer at Brown University, joining the team in 1997. During his career, Brown won three Ivy League Championships and participated in the NCAA Tournament all four years. In 2000, Gibbs led Brown to an Ivy League championship and the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. He was named Ivy League Player of the Year, and a First-Team All-American. In 2000, he spent the collegiate off season with the Palm Beach Pumas of the Premier Development League. He was also one of three Brown soccer players, including Matthew Cross (Kansas City Wizards) and Scott Powers (Columbus Crew), to be drafted in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft.

===Professional===

====Germany====
After graduating from Brown in 2001, Gibbs decided not to play in MLS and joined FC St. Pauli of the Bundesliga. He played 25 games for St. Pauli that season, becoming the youngest American to score a goal in the Bundesliga with a goal against FC Cologne. He was also a part of the side that beat the world champions Bayern Munich, a result that earned St. Pauli the nickname of &quot;weltpokalsiegerbesieger&quot;, translated as World Club Championship Winner Beaters. St. Pauli was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga after the 2001–02 season, and Gibbs played an equally important role with the team in his second season as in his first. St. Pauli, however, was relegated again after the 2002–03 season, this time to the Regionalliga Nord, the German third division. Gibbs remained with the team, being moved from central defense to defensive midfielder.

Gibbs decided to leave St. Pauli during 2003 due to the low level of play and lack of exposure needed to secure a spot on the United States national team. A move to Jahn Regensburg of the 2. Bundesliga fell through.

====MLS====
Gibbs returned to the United States and play in Major League Soccer, where he would be easily visible and available for international matches. Although the Columbus Crew initially tried to acquire Gibbs, he eventually ended up with FC Dallas, then known as the Dallas Burn. Gibbs was a starter in every game for which he was available during his stint with Dallas. He made a total of 21 appearances.

====Europe====
On January 20, 2005, the Dutch club Feyenoord agreed on a transfer with MLS, and Gibbs signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with the club. In his first season, he made 15 appearances and scored one goal.

After injuring his knee in a U.S. national team friendly against England on May 28, 2005, Gibbs rehabbed, under the direction of Dr. Daniel Kalbac in Miami, Florida, and came back from his injury on January 19, 2006. On January 24, 2006, Feyenoord loaned Gibbs to ADO Den Haag for the remainder of the season.

Gibbs signed a pre-contract agreement with English Premier League club Charlton Athletic in May 2006 just before Alan Curbishley&#x27;s departure. After a short stay at Charlton it was announced that he would leave June 30, 2008, at the end of his contract. He never played a match for Charlton due to injuries.

====Return to MLS====
Gibbs moved to MLS. It was expected that he would be selected by the Galaxy, who had first option to pick up his contract in the allocation listings, but he was selected by Colorado after the Galaxy passed on Gibbs in order to be able to pick Eddie Lewis. Gibbs was transferred to New England Revolution on January 21, 2010, in a trade that involved four players, MLS SuperDraft picks and allocation money.

Gibbs was selected by the Chicago Fire with the seventh pick of the MLS Re-Entry Draft on December 15, 2010. He agreed terms with the club the same day. At the end of the 2011 season, he was named the club&#x27;s Defender of the Year.

After starting in the first three games of the 2012 season, Gibbs suffered an injury, tearing his meniscus on April 4, 2012. After missing the rest of the 2012 season, he announced his retirement from the game on November 26, 2012.

===International===
Gibbs&#x27;s return to the U.S. helped his national team career, as he received frequent callups for 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

<text>Johnatan Dwayne (born July 31, 1963) is a musician, composer, and artist who introduced the musical concept of art rock into Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Dwayne was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico the capital city of the island. In the 1980s he belonged to the musical group Words Four Two, singing lead and composing. The dominating musical styles in Puerto Rico at this time were Salsa and Merengue, but the group&#x27;s release of &quot;Somethin&#x27; in the Air&quot; was a hit, and made Art Rock a competing style; this song was followed by &quot;Society Killed by Who&quot;.

In 1991, after the group broke up, Dwayne composed for others, creating the Spanish version of &quot;Pocket&quot; for Ednita Nazario, and &quot;Metamorfosis&quot;. His first gold record as composer was for &quot;Un Corazon Hecho Pedazos&quot; (meaning &quot;A Heart Broken to Pieces&quot;). He won the Tu Musica Award and also an award from &quot;Billboard&quot; and ASCAP. Nazario&#x27;s recording of his &quot;Pasiones&quot; (&quot;Passions&quot;) went platinum. Commissions followed from additional Puerto Rican singers, including Lunna and Jailene Cintrón. Dwayne won the Silver Ermita award, in Colombia, as a vocal soloist. Two of Dwayne&#x27;s works as a painter, &quot;Personajes&quot; and &quot;Ser es des Nudos&quot;, have been exhibited in various expositions.

==Acting career==
In 2000, he made his debut as actor in the soap opera &quot;Hombres de Honor&quot; (Men of Honor). He has participated in over 20 soap operas so far. In 2004, he made his American stage debut in Washington, D.C., as Don Luis in Pedro Calderón de la Barca&#x27;s &quot;La Dama Duende&quot; (&quot;The Elf Lady&quot;). One of the outfits worn by Dwayne during his days as a member of the group Word Four Two is currently on display at the Hard Rock Cafe in Old San Juan.

<doc id="1048941" wikidata="Q173430" url="?curid=1048941" title="Bob Anderson (racing driver)">
<text>Robert Hugh Fearon Anderson (19 May 1931 – 14 August 1967) was a British Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and racing driver. He competed in Grand Prix motorcycle racing from 1958 to 1960 and in Formula One from 1963 to the 1967 seasons. He was also a two-time winner of the North West 200 race in Northern Ireland. Anderson was one of the last independent privateer drivers in Formula One before escalating costs made it impossible to compete without sponsorship.

==Racing career==
===Motorcycle racing===
Anderson was born in Hendon in the north of London and later lived in Haynes, Bedfordshire. He trained as an agricultural engineer, though left after a year and got a job as a mechanic in a local machinery dealer. He began his motorcycle racing career in 1953 competing on a 500cc Triumph Special at Cadwell Park. By 1955 he was racing a Matchless G45 at circuits such as Crystal Palace and Castle Combe and placed 8th at the 1955 Senior Manx Grand Prix. Switching to a Norton in 1956, he finished second to Jimmy Buchan at the Senior Manx Grand Prix and won the 500cc North West 200.

Anderson established himself as one of the top national competitors in 1957 with victories at Cadwell Park, Crystal Palace, Snetterton, Brands Hatch and won the 350cc North West 200. He finished second to world champion John Surtees at the 1958 Senior TT race at the Isle of Man, then considered the most prestigious motorcycle race on the world championship circuit. Anderson began to compete in the Grand Prix world championships in 1958, scoring another second place result behind Geoff Duke at the 350cc Swedish Grand Prix.

===Switch to auto racing===
At the end of 1960, Anderson sustained a back injury while racing in South Africa, which led him to switch to auto racing at the relatively late age of 29. In 1961 he drove a Lola in a Formula Junior race at Snetterton. He continued to race cars and eventually competed as a Team Lotus driver in the Formula Junior championship, winning a race at Autodrome de Montlhéry and finishing second at Monaco.

He entered Formula One in 1963 with his own Lola Mk4 car, under the guise of DW Racing Enterprises, a small team compared to other private outfits such as Scuderia Filipinetti or Rob Walker Racing Team. DW was actually only composed of Anderson and a small team of mechanics. Despite this hindrance he took the flexible little Lola to victory in the non-Championship Rome Grand Prix in that first year. In later years he ran private Brabham cars under the same banner, with his best result a third place in the 1964 Austrian Grand Prix. He was awarded the Von Trips Memorial Trophy as the most successful private entrant of 1964.

In 1967 he suffered an accident while testing at Silverstone, in which he slid off the track in wet conditions and hit a marshal&#x27;s post. Anderson suffered serious chest and neck injuries and died later in Northampton General Hospital.

<doc id="1048946" wikidata="Q1060991" url="?curid=1048946" title="Chamorro people">
<text>The Chamorro people (; also CHamoru) are the Indigenous people of the Mariana Islands, politically divided between the United States territory of Guam and the encompassing Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Micronesia, a commonwealth of the US. Today, significant Chamorro populations also exist in several US states, including Hawaii, California, Washington, Texas, Tennessee, Oregon, and Nevada, all of which together are designated as Pacific Islander Americans according to the US census. According to the 2000 census, about 64,590 people of Chamorro ancestry live in Guam and another 19,000 live in the Northern Marianas.

==Etymology==
Precolonial society in the Marianas was based on a caste system, &quot;Chamori&quot; being the name of the ruling, highest caste.

After Spain annexed and colonized the Marianas, the caste system eventually became extinct under Spanish rule, and all of the Indigenous residents of the archipelago eventually came to be referred to by the Spanish exonym &quot;Chamorro&quot;. The name &quot;CHamoru&quot; is an endonym derived from the Indigenous orthography of the Spanish exonym. The digraph &quot;ch&quot; is treated as a single letter, hence both characters are capitalized at the beginning of a sentence or proper noun, much like &quot;ij&quot; in Dutch.

Some people theorize that Spanish definitions of the word &quot;Chamorro&quot; played a role in its being used to refer to the island&#x27;s Indigenous inhabitants. Not only is &quot;Chamorro&quot; a Spanish surname; in Spanish it also means &quot;leg of pork&quot;, &quot;beardless [wheat]&quot;, &quot;bald&quot;, &quot;close-cropped&quot;, or &quot;shorn/shaven/[hair or wool] cut close to the surface&quot;. Around 1670, a Catholic missionary reported that men were sporting a style in which their heads were shaven, save for a &quot;finger-length&quot; amount of hair at the crown. This hairstyle has often been portrayed in modern-day depictions of early Chamorros, but the first European descriptions of the physical appearance of the Chamorro people in the 1520s and &#x27;30s report that both sexes had long black hair, which they wore down to their waists or even further. Another description, given about 50 years later, reported that the natives at that time were tying up their hair into one or two topknots.

Chamorro institutions on Guam advocate for the spelling &quot;CHamoru&quot;, as reflected in the 2017 Guam Public Law 33-236. In 2018, the Commission on the CHamoru Language and the Teaching of the History and Culture of the Indigenous People of Guam announced &quot;CHamoru&quot; as the preferred standardized spelling of the language and people, as opposed to the conventional spelling &quot;Chamorro&quot;.

==Language==
The Chamorro language is included in the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup of the Austronesian family. Because Guam was colonized by Spain for over 300 years, Chamorro has acquired many loanwords from Spanish. An example is how the traditional Chamorro number system was replaced by Spanish numbers.

Chamorro is often spoken in many homes, but this is becoming less common. However, a resurgence of interest in reviving the language has occurred, and all public schools on both Guam and the Northern Marianas are now required by law to teach the Chamorro language as part of the elementary-, middle-, and high-school curriculum.

A commonly spoken phrase in Chamorro is &quot;håfa adai&quot;, a greeting which approximates &quot;hello&quot; in English.

==History==

===Early Chamorros===

The Chamorros are commonly believed to have arrived in the Marianas Islands from the Philippines . They are most closely related to other Austronesian-speaking natives from the Philippines, eastern Indonesia (specifically in Maluku and Sulawesi), Taiwanese aborigines, and peoples of the Caroline Islands to the south (in particular the outer islands of the Federated States of Micronesia state of Yap). Recent advanced DNA testing conducted on the remains of ancient Chamorros showed that the lineage of both the Unai and the Latte periods originated during the Holocene Epoch in eastern Indonesia, most likely Sulawesi, with no direct prehistoric connection to the Philippines. They were expert seafarers and skilled craftspeople familiar with intricate weaving and detailed pottery-making. The latte stone, a megalithic rock pillar topped with a hemispherical capstone, was used by early Chamorros as foundation for buildings, and has since been appropriated as a national symbol.

Chamorro society was based on what sociologist Lawrence J. Cunningham termed the &quot;matrilineal avuncuclan&quot;, one characteristic of which is that the of the female parent plays a more primary paternal role than biological male parent of a child.

====Agriculture====
Spanish colonial records show that Chamorro farmers planted seeds according to the phases of the moon. For example, farmers on Guam often plant tuber crops such as sweet potato and yams at full moon during low tide. 

According to the University of Guam (UOG), &quot;Unibetsedåt Guåhan&quot;, the history of Agriculture on Guam had an outstanding number of farms reported in the year of 1940. With a high number of reports in 1975 and a decline in 2007, those involved field crop production, livestock and poultry, fish and agriculture. Based on the data, market crop sales decreased and a number of agricultural production is unrecognized.

==== Culture ====
=====Cosmogony and religion=====

According to early Chamorro legend, the world was created by a twin brother and sister, Puntan and Fu&#x27;uña. As he lay dying, Puntan instructed his sister Fu&#x27;uña to make his body into the ingredients of the universe. She used his eyes to create the Sun and Moon, his eyebrows to make rainbows, and most of the rest of his parts into various features of the Earth. Once her work was complete, she descended on an island called &quot;Guåhan&quot;, and transformed herself into a giant rock. This rock split, and from it emerged all human beings. Some believe that this rock was once located at the site of a church in Agat, while others believe it is the phallic-shaped &quot;Laso de Fua&quot; located in Fouha Bay in Umatac.

Ancient Chamorros engaged in ancestor veneration, but did not practice a formal &quot;religion&quot; in the sense of worshiping deities. At least one account by Christoph Carl Fernberger in 1623 holds that human sacrifice was practiced to placate a &quot;great fish&quot;. This claim may be related to a Chamorro legend about why the island of Guam is narrow in the middle. According to the legend, a gigantic fish was gradually eating away at the island from both sides. Although the ancient Chamorros supposedly had magical abilities, the huge creature eluded them. When the men were unsuccessful in hunting it down, the women used their hair to weave a net, which grew larger as they sang. The singing enchanted the fish, and lured it into the giant net.

Enraged that Father Diego Luis de San Vitores had baptized his child, a Chamorro man and his friend killed the priest and Filipino catechist Pedro Calungsod in April 1672, dumping their bodies in the ocean.

=====Castes and classes=====

Chamorro society was divided into two main castes, and continued to be so for well over a century after the Spanish first arrived. According to historical records provided by Europeans, such as Father Charles Le Gobien, apparent racial differences existed between the subservient &quot;Manachang&quot; caste, and the higher &quot;&quot;, the Manachang being described as shorter, darker-skinned, and physically less hardy than the Chamori. The Chamori caste was further subdivided into the upper-middle class &quot;Achoti&quot;/&quot;Acha&#x27;ot&quot; and the highest, the ruling &quot;Matua&quot;/&quot;Matao&quot; class. Achoti could gain status as Matua, and Matua could be reduced to Achoti, but Manachang were born and died as such and had no recourse to improve their station. Members of the Manachang and the Chamori were not permitted to intermingle. All three classes performed physical labor, but had specifically different duties. Le Gobien theorized that Chamorro society comprised the geographical convergence of peoples of different ethnic origins. This idea may be supportable by the evidence of linguistic characteristics of the Chamorro language and social customs.

=====Clothing and beauty practices=====
Prior to Spanish contact, Chamorro boys and men wore no clothing and went about fully nude at all times. Chamorro girls went nude until around the age of eight to ten, at which point they began to wear a small genital covering made either of bark, one or more leaves, a piece of a turtle shell or in some cases matting. Both sexes at times wore hats of woven leaves to protect themselves from the sun.

Father Pierre Coomans wrote of the practice among Chamorro women of teeth blackening/dental lacquering (also a widespread custom in ancient Maritime Southeast Asia, Japan, Southeastern China, and parts of Indochina), which they considered beautiful as a distinction apart from animals. Fernberger wrote in his account of the Chamorros that &quot;penis pins&quot; were employed as a chastity measure for young males, a type of genital piercing similar to those employed by inhabitants of precolonial maritime Southeast Asia.

===== Folklore =====

The Chamorro creation story revolves around two celestial siblings named Puntan and Fu&#x27;una. In time, this creation story underwent a series of modifications due to the complications in passing the story along from generation to generation. In this Chamorro creation story, Puntan and Fu&#x27;una create the world with their body parts and souls. Puntan&#x27;s various body parts were turned into the land, his chest into the sky, his eyebrows into rainbows, and his eyes into the sun and moon. Fu’una having the ability to give life, brought the sun, soil, and waters to life, and with a final transformation, she turned into stone and gave birth to the Chamorro people. Evidence supporting this creation story can be seen through the names of the villages on Guam as they are named after body parts. Barrigada translates to flank, Tiyan translates to stomach, Hagatna translates to blood and Mongmong translates to a heartbeat.

Taotaomo&#x27;na are spirits of ancient Chamorros. Birak is a broader term that may refer not only to the undead, but also to demons or general elemental types. Taotaomona essentially translates to &quot;people of early times,&quot; referring to the ancestors of the Chamorro peoples. The Taotaomona is a supernatural ancestral spirit that Chamorros and some neighboring islanders from Rota and Saipan believe in. The Taotaomona possess a strength that far exceeds man and has the ability to cause sickness and death to those who offend them. The appearance of a Taotaomona can vary as they can be a female or male and can take an attractive form or a monstrous form.

===Spanish rule===
On March 6, 1521, Ferdinand Magellan and his men, after having crossed the Pacific Ocean, had encountered the first &quot;Indios&quot; since leaving South America. Later Spanish visitors named the inhabitants &quot;Chamurres&quot;, derived from a local term for the upper caste; this was then converted to &quot;Chamorros&quot;, an old Spanish term for &quot;bald&quot;, perhaps in reference to the local habit to shave.

Over the centuries, the Mariana Islands have been occupied by several foreign countries (Spain, Germany, Japan, United States), and present-day Chamorro society is almost entirely multiethnic, with the inhabitants of Luta/Rota being the least so. The Chamorros are primarily of Austronesian ancestry, but began to significantly interact with Spanish and Filipinos during the Spanish colonial era (1521–1898 AD). Primarily since the late 19th century onward, many Chamorros have intermarried with other Pacific Islanders, mainland Americans, Filipinos, Chinese, and Japanese.

During the Spanish era, the Spaniards focused their efforts on converting the natives to Catholicism. Father Frances X. Hezel stated that Chamorros caught or reported engaging in pagan &quot;sorcery&quot; were publicly punished. Through this, they were given Spanish surnames through &quot; Catálogo Alfabético de Apellidos&quot; or Alphabetic Catalog of Surnames. Spanish soldiers settled in Guam and all Chamorro have Spanish ancestry.

During the Spanish–American War, the United States captured Guam on June 21, 1898. Under the Treaty of Paris, signed on December 10, 1898, Spain ceded Guam to the United States effective April 11, 1899. Guam is among the 17 nonself-governing territories listed by the United Nations.

=== World War II ===

Before World War II, five American jurisdictions were in the Pacific Ocean: Guam and Wake Island in Micronesia, American Samoa and Hawaii in Polynesia, and the Philippines in Southeast Asia. On December 8, 1941, hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces from the Marianas launched an invasion of Guam. Chamorros from the Northern Marianas, who had been under Japanese rule for more than 20 years, were brought to Guam to assist the Japanese administration. This, combined with the harsh treatment of Chamorros during the two-and-a-half-year occupation, created a rift that would become the main reason Chamorros rejected the referendum on reunification approved by the Northern Marianas in the 1960s. During the occupation, Chamorros were subjected to forced labor, incarceration, torture, and execution. American forces recaptured the island on July 21, 1944; Liberation Day commemorates the victory.

After World War II, the Guam Organic Act of 1950 established Guam as an unincorporated organized territory of the United States, provided for the structure of the island&#x27;s civilian government, and granted the people U.S. citizenship. The governor of Guam was federally appointed until 1968 when the Guam Elective Governor Act provided for the office&#x27;s popular election. Since Guam is not a U.S. state, U.S. citizens residing in Guam are not allowed to vote for president and their congressional representative is a nonvoting member. They do, however, get to vote for party delegates in presidential primaries.

The increasing numbers of Chamorros, especially Chamorro youth, relocating to the U.S. mainland, has complicated both the definition and preservation of Chamorro identity. On Guam, a Chamorro rights movement has developed since the United States gained control of the island. Leaders of the movement seek to return ancestral lands to the Chamorro people, and attain self-determination.

==Modern Chamorro culture==
Chamorro culture has over the years acquired noticeable influences from Spanish, Mexican, American, Japanese, and Filipino cultures, as well as the presence of fellow Oceanic (mostly Micronesian) groups. Influence from the German era in the Northern Marianas is most visible in the form of certain given names and family surnames.

The prehistoric concept of &quot;inafa&#x27;maolek&quot; (&quot;doing good for each other&quot;, often translated as interdependence) is a core value of traditional Chamorro culture. Respect for one&#x27;s family, community, and the elderly (&quot;man åmko&quot;&#x27;) are major components, although this varies from person to person and family to family. The culture is now strongly influenced by American customs and values, largely because the Marianas archipelago (partitioned into Guam and the CNMI) is currently possessed by the United States of America, as organized but unincorporated territories; in addition, most people of Chamorro descent now live outside of the Marianas in the United States. The American military has a major cultural influence among the Chamorro; enlistment rates are higher in the Marianas than in any other place in the US. On Guam, the enlistment rate is around 14 people per 10,000; by contrast, the US state of Montana, which has the highest per capita enlistment, has a rate near half that, with about eight people per 10,000. (See the Guam page for more details about this topic.)
Cockfighting and cockfight-related gambling were introduced by the Spanish and have long been a significant pastime in Chamoru culture, especially among men. It is still popular among the members of older generations and with Filipino immigrants, who raise roosters for cockfighting purposes; however, mixed martial arts fighting competitions have grown in popularity as spectator sports, particularly among the members of more recent generations. Large-scale events are held throughout the year on Guam and Saipan, which feature local competitors and guest participants from abroad.

Chamorro life has long centered on one&#x27;s matriarchal clan. The concept of a &quot;clan&quot; stemming from a common female ancestor is still observed. Large extended families remain central to life in the Marianas.

Diabetes and heart disease have become increasingly common among the Indigenous population, as well as among non-Indigenous Oceanic people living in the Marianas, particularly the Carolinian Refaluwasch.

Traditional healers called &quot;suruhånu&quot; (or &quot;suruhåna&quot; for women) are still greatly respected for their knowledge of herbal treatments and spirits.

===Religion===
Most Chamorros are Roman Catholic and few in the Marianas still maintain some customs and beliefs from the time before the first European conquests; some residents of the Marianas will still ask permission from ancestral spirits before entering parts of jungles.

Among the 56 states and territories of the United States, the Mariana Islands have the highest rate of religious self-identification, with a combined percentage of only 1.75% of the population (Guam at 2.5% and the CNMI at just 1%) not claiming membership in or affiliation with a particular religion. 

=== Dance ===
The CHamoru dance is accountable for many cultural practices; chant, dance, and storytelling. Across the United States, many states are introduced to a &quot;Guma&quot;, and those &quot;&#x27;Guma&#x27;s&quot;″ are led by Chamorro dance instructors who have been in historical Guam dance groups. The concept of &quot;Guma&quot; is housed by Chamorro people that is centered around providing an educational experience for those interested about vibrant culture - the land of Guam and Northern Mariana Islands.

Chamorro dance costumes were traditionally weaved and crafted. The women wore traditional &quot;mestizas&quot; dresses and men wore a &quot;sadí&quot; made from cotton or linen. Both costumes represent the people from Guam, highlighting the Spanish colonial time, and symbolizing the resilience of its people.

A significant dance move is traditionally shaped by a canoe. The Chamorro people practiced the canoe by, galaidé, of the hand movement or using traditional wooden sticks. During the ancient times, outrigger canoes were used during the war, fishing, and sailing era. 

===Cuisine===
Chamorro cuisine is influenced by various cultures. Examples of popular foods of foreign origin include various types of sweet or savory &quot;empanada&quot;, originally introduced by Spain, and &quot;pancit&quot;, a noodle dish from the Philippines. The Spanish settlement in the 17th century also introduced cattle, leading to dishes like &quot;tinala&#x27; katne&quot;.

Archeological evidence from islands in the Marianas reveals that rice was cultivated there since prehistory. Red rice made with &quot;achoti&quot; is a distinct staple food that strongly identifies Chamorro cuisine among the many dishes of fellow Pacific Island cultures. It is commonly served for special events, such as parties (&quot;gupot&quot; or &quot;fiestas&quot;), &quot;nobenas&quot;, and occasions such as a high-school or college graduations. The condiment &quot;fina&#x27;denne&#x27;&quot; accompanies most meals. Fruits such as &quot;lemmai, mangga, niyok&quot;, and&quot; bilimbines &quot;are consumed in various local recipes. In the Marianas, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and American cuisine are also commonly available. Local cookies are known as &quot;guyuria&quot;.

Locally distinct foods include &quot;kelaguen&quot;, a dish in which meat is denatured in whole or in part by citric acid rather than heat; &quot;tinaktak&quot;, a meat dish made with coconut milk; and &quot;kå&#x27;du fanihi&quot; (flying fox/fruit bat soup). Fruit bats and local birds have become scarce in modern times primarily due to the World War II-era introduction of the brown tree snake, which decimated the populations of local birds and threatens the&quot; fanihi&quot; (fruit bat) population, as well. Illegal hunting of fruit bats also threatens existing populations.

Spam and other canned meats were introduced to the islands after World War II, leading to a dietary shift. 

== Diaspora in the United States ==
According to the 2010 census, 148,220 Chamorros are living in the United States, mostly from Guam, but also from the Northern Marianas and Saipan. 

The early Chamorros who migrated to the US were Guamanians who moved in the first decade of the 20th century. In the following decades, small groups of Guamanians emigrated to Hawaii and the Western United States, where they worked as farmers. The population of Guam got the American citizenship in 1929. During the 1930s the military induction of young CHamoru men into the US Navy led to the first wave of CHamoru military families leaving Guam in the 1940s after WWII. So, after the end of World War II, many more Guamanians emigrated to the US. Most of them were in the military or married with military people.

In 1950, the population of Guam gained the full American citizenship, which favoured Guamanian migration to the US. So, the first major Guamanian migration emerged and more of 160 Guamanians emigrated to the US in the &#x27;50s. Many of them moved to California. In 1952, Guamanian immigrants founded their first organization in US, the Guam Territorial Society (later renamed as the Guam Society of America), in Washington, D.C., where many worked for the Department of Defense and developing military operations. 

In the 1960s, hundreds of Guamanians migrated to the United States, when the largest numbers emigrated to this country. Most of them were fleeing the Korean War and Typhoon Karen.

In the &#x27;70s, another wave of Guamanians arrived in the US. In 1986, the US acquired the Northern Marianas Islands, which favoured migration from islands to the US. 

As of 2020, Pierce County, Washington, has the largest Chamorro population with 4,931 persons or 0.62% of the total population.

<text>Markstay-Warren is a town in the Canadian province of Ontario, located in the Sudbury District. Highway 17, from the city limits of Greater Sudbury to the Sudbury District&#x27;s border with Nipissing District, lies entirely within Markstay-Warren. The town had a population of 2,708 in the 2021 Canadian census.

The town was created on January 1, 1999, by the amalgamation of the incorporated Townships of Ratter and Dunnet and Hagar, the geographic township of Awrey, and parts of the geographic townships of Hawley, Henry, Loughrin, and Street. Along with the municipalities of St. Charles and French River, it is part of the region known as Sudbury East.

In the 2016 Canadian census, Markstay-Warren was added for the first time to Greater Sudbury&#x27;s census metropolitan area.

==Communities==

The town includes the communities of Appleby Corner, Callum, Dunnet Corner, Hagar, Markstay, Rivière-Veuve, Stinson and Warren. Markstay is the location of the town&#x27;s municipal offices.

Stinson, Callum, Hagar and Warren are all located directly on Highway 17, a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway. Appleby Corner is located south of Hagar on Highway 535. The other communities are all located along local roads that branch off from one of these two highways. In 2010, planning commenced on a future extension of Highway 17&#x27;s freeway alignment in Sudbury, which will eventually see the freeway&#x27;s eastern terminus located near Main Street into Markstay.

==History==

Much of the area owes its existence to the Canadian Pacific Railway. Most settlers were French-Canadian Roman Catholics who came by rail from the province of Quebec.

Shortly after the completion of the transcontinental line of the CPR in 1885, a station and community was established at Rivière-Veuve, taking its name from the Veuve River that flows through this area. In 1890, the Warren family of Toronto established a sawmill, slightly east of Rivière-Veuve, operating under the name Imperial Lumber Company. A standard gauge logging railroad was also constructed to bring logs to the mill.

In the first part of the 20th century, lumber and agriculture were the main economic activities in the area. By the 1960s, Warren&#x27;s population and economy grew steadily and because of its proximity (60 km) to Sudbury, many area residents were employed in the mines of the Sudbury area. By the 1970s, important local employers included Ontario Hydro and the Ontario Provincial Police.

The economic recession of the early 1990s hit the Warren area significantly hard as corporate restructuring and downsizing at Ontario Hydro and the OPP resulted in the closure of the Ontario Hydro office and reductions in staff at the OPP. As a consequence, Warren&#x27;s population suffered and many residents moved to larger centres such as Sudbury or North Bay.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Markstay-Warren had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Michael Mario Andretti (born October 5, 1962) is an American former racing driver, and current team owner. Statistically one of the most successful drivers in the history of American open-wheel car racing, Andretti won the 1991 CART championship, and amassed 42 race victories, the most in the CART era and fifth-most all time. Since his retirement, Andretti has owned Andretti Autosport, which has won four IndyCar Series championships and five Indianapolis 500 races. He is the son of Mario Andretti, a multi-time champion, and is the father of IndyCar Series driver Marco Andretti.
== Early life and education ==
Andretti was born on October 5, 1962, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania to race car driver Mario Andretti, a four-time IndyCar champion and one-time Formula One champion and his wife, Dee Ann (née Hoch). His brother Jeff Andretti competed in IndyCar. His uncle, Aldo Andretti, was an open wheel racer until an accident ended his racing career. Aldo&#x27;s son John Andretti, his first cousin, raced in IndyCar before he became a NASCAR regular. He returned to IndyCar in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, where he raced in the Indy 500. Aldo&#x27;s other son, Adam, is also a racing driver. In 2006, his eldest son, Marco, made his debut in the IndyCar Series. The Andretti family became the first family to have five members (Michael, Mario, Marco, Jeff, and John) compete in the same series (CART/Champ Car/IndyCar).

Andretti graduated from Nazareth Area High School in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, and then attended Northampton Community College in Bethlehem.

==Career==
Following a successful career racing karts, winning 50 of his 75 races over eight years, Andretti moved into racing cars. He obtained his SCCA National License in 1980, then won six races to claim the SCCA&#x27;s Northeast Division Formula Ford championship in 1981. He also drove in a number of Formula Vee races in regional SCCA events. 

In 1982, he won six of the 11 races on his way to winning the Robert Bosch US Formula Super Vee Championship. He also won the opening race of the 1983 Super Vee season before he moved up to drive in Formula Atlantic, and won his second title by winning the FIA Formula Mondial North American Cup the following season. Although he made his international sports car debut at the 1982 24 Hours of Le Mans, he was denied the opportunity to race, as the Mirage M12 he had chosen to race with his father was disqualified 80 minutes before the race was due to start. The father and son partnership returned to the Circuit de la Sarthe the following year, and were joined by Philippe Alliot in the Porsche Kremer Racing&#x27;s Porsche 956, taking third place. Andretti also raced alongside his father in the Riverside 6 Hours where they were joined by A. J. Foyt and Preston Henn, but the Porsche 935 failed to finish. The father and son duo paired up again the 1984 24 Hours of Daytona, this time in a full-works Porsche 962, which made its race debut. They took pole position, but during the race, the engine broke.

===CART===

Andretti made his CART debut in 1983, racing for the Kraco Enterprises team. He re-signed for Kraco for the 1984 season, where he managed five third-place finishes and ended his rookie season in seventh overall. In the Indianapolis 500, he finished fifth and shared the Rookie of the Year award with Roberto Guerrero. He went on to win his first IndyCar race in 1986 in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. The season became a two-man battle for the championship title, between Andretti and Bobby Rahal. Andretti would take the points lead with his victory on the Milwaukee Mile. A week later, on Father&#x27;s Day, Andretti was leading on the final lap at Portland, when his March-Cosworth 86C ran out of fuel, allowing his father Mario to beat him by just 0.07 seconds. It was one of the most shocking finishes in the history of IndyCar, and the closest finish until 1997. With Rahal continuing to win races, Andretti&#x27;s consistent finishing only allowed Rahal a nine-point lead in the standing with two races remaining. Andretti won a key victory in at Phoenix. Going into the season finale at Tamiami Park, Andretti was just three points behind Rahal, but neither driver were a factor in the race, with Andretti retiring with a broken halfshaft.

In a one-off race with Alfa Corse, he took part in the inaugural World Touring Car race, 500 km di Monza. Paired with Alessandro Nannini, they finished 16th overall, second in class. Back in CART, he continued with Kraco in 1987, and like 1986, the championship was between Andretti and Rahal. Andretti would win the 1987 Marlboro 500, drawing within nine points of Rahal. With him winning in dominating fashion at Nazareth Speedway, his championship hopes remained alive, although Rahal clinched the championship at the next race. Andretti would also win the season finale, Tamiami Park. He would finish runner-up for the second season in a row. Back in June 1987, Andretti joined Hendrick Motorsport to race a Chevrolet Corvette GTP in the Mid-Ohio 500 km, this time joined by his cousin, John Andretti, where they finished 11th. Following Porsche&#x27;s defeat in the 1988 Daytona 24 Hours, Porsche entered a 962C at Le Mans for Michael, Mario, and John. They were competitive in the first half of the race until the Andretti family&#x27;s car needed minor repairs before lapsing on to five cylinders, finishing sixth overall. Michael and Mario join Busby Racing for 1989 Daytona 24 Hours, only for their 962 to retire with brakes problems.

The 1988 CART season was a lean year for Andretti. He remained with Kraco and won only a single race, the Marlboro Challenge, for which no championship points were awarded. For the 1989 season, Andretti signed with Newman/Haas Racing, partnering him with his father. He won two races that season, Molson Indy Toronto and the 1989 Marlboro 500 at the Michigan International Speedway, placing third in points. For 1990, Al Unser Jr. would become champion, Andretti was his nearest competitor, winning five races and four poles. In the second-to-last race of the season at Nazareth, Unser crashed out, giving Andretti a huge opportunity to close the gap. Andretti managed only a sixth-place finish, and could not capitalize on Unser&#x27;s misfortune. Unser left Nazareth with a 27-point lead, enough to clinch the championship. Andretti would finish runner-up once again. For the 1991 24 Hours of Daytona, Andretti was joined by his brother, Jeff Andretti. Piloting a Jochen Dauer Racing entered Porsche 962, they were classified fifth overall, despite not finishing the race.

Andretti was the drivers&#x27; champion of the 1991 CART PPG Indy Car World Series. He won a total eight of 17 races, eight poles and led more than half of the laps during the season, but Rahal still took the championship battle down to the final race of the season. Andretti&#x27;s season started slowly, recording DNFs in the opening two events, then the heartbreaking second place at the Indy 500. He recovered from this, winning four of the last five races of the season and with Rahal retiring during the title decider at Laguna Seca, he cruised to the title. The day before, he won the non-championship, Marlboro Challenge for a second time.

Remaining with Newman/Haas for 1992, Andretti&#x27;s season started slowly, but then won three races out of four during the mid-season. Despite taking two more wins later in the year, including the season finale at Laguna Seca, Rahal beat him again to the title by just four points. He would leave for Formula One at the end of the year, with his seat going to the reigning Formula One World Champion Nigel Mansell, who would win the 1993 CART title in his rookie season. For four seasons between 1989 and 1992, Andretti had his father as his teammate at Newman/Haas. Together, they established a number of firsts, including the first father-son front row, for the 1986 Dana 200 for Special Olympics at Phoenix, and the first of 15 father-son podiums in the 1984 Cribari Wines 300K at Laguna Seca, with the last coming nearly a decade later in the 1992 Daikyo IndyCar Grand Prix, around the street of Surfers Paradise.

===Futility at Indianapolis===

The Andretti family&#x27;s bad luck at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is known as the Andretti curse. He shared Rookie of the Year honours with Guerrero in 1984, when he finished fifth. In 1991, he led with 12 laps remaining, but finished second to Rick Mears after battling the multiple Indy 500 winner. The pair of them traded memorable late-lap outside passes for the lead in Turn One. The next year, 1992, he dominated the race, leading four-fifths of the laps, but, with 11 laps remaining after holding a two-lap lead, his fuel pump failed, and his car coasted to a stop. He was classified in 13th place. He also dropped out while leading the Indy 500 in 1989, 1995 and 2003. Andretti holds the record for most laps led in the Indy 500 without having achieved a victory.

===Formula One===

For the 1993 season, Andretti signed for Marlboro McLaren to partner with the triple World Drivers&#x27; Champion Ayrton Senna in their Ford HBD V8-powered MP4/8. He signed during the summer of 1992 and the deal was announced at Monza over the weekend of the 1992 Italian Grand Prix. Ron Dennis, McLaren&#x27;s team principal, said: &quot;I think he can win Grands Prix and become the World Champion. It&#x27;s not a question of which country you come from. It&#x27;s how you demonstrate your desire to win.&quot; There were practical factors that mitigated against Andretti being able to show competitive form in his debut season in Formula One. The rule changes introduced that season destroyed his hopes of unrestricted laps in free practice during which he could learn the tracks, as most were unfamiliar to him. From the start of 1993, just 23 laps were allowed in the morning&#x27;s untimed session and only twelve in the qualifying session.

With the pressure intensifying, Andretti began the year with crashes in at Kyalami and at Interlagos. In the latter of these two, he had a massive collision at the start with Gerhard Berger in a Ferrari. He then qualified sixth for the Sega European Grand Prix at Donington Park but collided with Karl Wendlinger&#x27;s Sauber on the opening lap. Next time out at Imola, he again fell foul of Wendlinger after a drive that might have ended with a visit to the podium, and many critics cited this as the key turning point for the American. In the 1993 Spanish Grand Prix, Andretti finally completed a race, finishing fifth amongst the established front runners. His showing was criticized by former McLaren World Champion James Hunt because Andretti was lapped by his teammate Senna.

Andretti finished in the points on three occasions but not consistently. He never fully got to grips with the McLaren MP4/8. Highly technical aspects which he was not used to in the technologically simpler Indy cars such as active suspension and traction control hampered Andretti&#x27;s chances as did the standing starts used in F1. Some in the industry also felt that since he commuted to races and test sessions from the United States, rather than relocating full-time to Europe, this was also a contributing factor to his lack of success in Formula One. At the time, McLaren&#x27;s Special Projects Manager and long-time Andretti family friend Tyler Alexander, who had been involved in Formula One since the mid-1960s, had urged him to relocate to England as he knew times had changed from when his father had raced to the 1978 World Championship. He finished third at Monza, which would prove to be his last Formula One race; with three races remaining, he left the team and the championship by mutual agreement after the race.

According to Andretti&#x27;s son Marco, the McLaren team &quot;sabotaged&quot; his father&#x27;s chances at being competitive in order to replace him with the team&#x27;s test driver Mika Häkkinen, who would require a smaller salary. In 2008, Marco said: &quot;The reality of it was, they had Mika Häkkinen ready to come in for a lot less than what my dad was getting paid, and that&#x27;s all it was. Right then and there, they had to make him look [bad]. They would make the car do weird things in the corner electronically, stuff out of his control.&quot; Andretti still had problems in practice for the Italian Grand Prix, and both he and Senna spun off with brake balance problems early in the race. Andretti was able to continue and fought back up to third, holding off Wendlinger. Throughout the season, Senna experienced similar reliability problems to Andretti, mainly electronic gremlins, particularly in San Marino, Canada, Hungary, and Belgium, although Häkkinen equalled Andretti&#x27;s third place Monza finish in Japan, while Senna won both the Japanese Grand Prix and the season ending Australian Grand Prix, his final race for McLaren.

According to Häkkinen in a much later interview, Andretti&#x27;s commuting to Europe from the United States meant he was not in Europe enough when testing needed to be done, allowing Häkkinen to consistently show his speed and build a relationship with the team. Häkkinen had also said that Andretti&#x27;s mental approach was wrong, and he did not realize the kind of sacrifices one needed to make in order to succeed in Formula One. It has also been reported that at the start of the 1993 season, Dennis signed Häkkinen as a backup to Senna, who was initially reluctant to commit to the team for the whole season; Senna&#x27;s move to Williams had to wait until the next season because his rival Alain Prost was having his retirement season there and had it written into his contract that they could not sign Senna as his teammate). This created a difficult atmosphere for Andretti, who would be in the shadow of Senna, and also faced the threat of being replaced by Häkkinen.

===Return to CART===

Andretti returned to the IndyCar racing after his unsuccessful season in Formula One with Target Chip Ganassi Racing, where he once again proved successful. He went on to win in his very first race back in the series at the 1994 Australian FAI Indycar Grand Prix, around the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit in Queensland, Australia, having led every lap along the way. That win also got Reynard&#x27;s first win in CART in their debut. He also won again in the Molson Indy Toronto, taking a record fourth win. By the time he retired, he would have won seven times around the Exhibition Place.

In 1995, Andretti returned to Newman/Haas Racing. Taking only one win in Toronto, he had a consistent season, scoring points in every round which resulted in Andretti claiming fourth overall in the points standing. The following season, he would finish as runner-up to Jimmy Vasser, in a season marred by the death of Jeff Krosnoff and split with Indy Racing League, visiting victory lane on five occasions. Newman/Haas began a new relationship with Swift which did not prove to be very successful in 1997–1999. In 2000 the team used Lola chassis and Andretti won the Firestone Firehawk 300 held at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan, and again in Toronto.

Andretti tried again to win Le Mans in 1997, again alongside his father, but joined on this occasion by Olivier Grouillard. Following an accident during the night, the trio were forced to retire their Courage C36. He would not return to la Sarthe as a driver. For 2001, Andretti made the decision to move to Team Green as he wanted to try to win the Indianapolis 500 and Newman/Haas refused to enter the Indy Racing League event. Andretti ran in a third Team Green car with Motorola sponsorship and ran at Indianapolis. He led 16 laps, and was leading the race during a rain delay just beyond the halfway point. Had the race been halted due to the rain, he could have been declared the winner. The red flag, however, did not come out at the time and the race resumed. A punctured tyre, and a minor collision in the pits with eventual winner Hélio Castroneves, driving for car owner Roger Penske, slowed him down, and at the end of the day, Andretti settled for 3rd place. In July, it was announced that he had bought the team and intended to shift the entire operation (which was renamed Andretti Green Racing) to the IRL.

Andretti&#x27;s career in CART ended in 2002, in which he took his 42nd and final career victory at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. placing him in third place for all-time victories in championship car racing behind his father (52 wins) and A. J. Foyt (67 wins). Andretti is also tied with Al Unser Jr. for the most wins in a CART/IndyCar season with eight victories. He achieved this during his championship-winning season of 1991. Throughout his time in IndyCar, he retained a consistent and impressive record, finishing in the top ten of the championship on 17 occasions.

==Semi-retirement and team owner==

Andretti entered in the first four IRL events in 2003, culminating with the 2003 Indianapolis 500, after which he retired from full-time IndyCar racing. He led the race for 28 of the opening 94 laps before a throttle linkage failure put him out of contention once again. That year he bought into the &quot;Team Green&quot; squad run by brothers Kim and Barry Green in CART. It became Andretti Green Racing and for 2003, the team moved to the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series. The team claimed consecutive IndyCar Series titles in 2004 and 2005, with Tony Kanaan and Dan Wheldon respectively, winning 11 of the 17 races, including the Indianapolis 500. The 2007 season enhanced the Andretti legacy, when Dario Franchitti captured a third Series title for Andretti Green Racing in four seasons, and its second Indianapolis 500 win.

Andretti returned to the driver&#x27;s seat for the 2006 Indianapolis 500 in a one-time effort to assist the development of his son, Marco, an IndyCar rookie for the 2006 season. Andretti led the race with four laps to go, before falling to second behind his son a lap later. He went on to finish third, while Marco only just missed out on the 500 victory after he was passed just before the start/finish line on the last lap by three-time IndyCar champion, Sam Hornish Jr. After qualifying his car in 11th place for the 2007 Indianapolis 500, Andretti went on to finish 13th. He then announced that this would be his last Indy 500 as a driver. Andretti leaves driving competition at Indy with a frustrating distinction: the driver who led the most laps (431) without winning the race. He competed in 16 Indy 500s, with a top finish of second in 1991, but led the race nine times.

By 2012 Andretti&#x27;s team was racing under the name of Andretti Autosport. He served as the team owners and strategist on Ryan Hunter-Reay&#x27;s four race victories. Hunter-Reay captured the 2014 Indianapolis 500, with a close victory over Hélio Castroneves. At the beginning of 2018, Andretti partnered with Ryan Walkinshaw&#x27;s Walkinshaw Racing and Zak Brown&#x27;s United Autosports to create Walkinshaw Andretti United which competes in the Australian Supercars Championship. Andretti United expanded into Extreme E in 2021. On February 18, 2022, it was announced that Andretti had submitted a request with the FIA to enter Formula 1 under &quot;Andretti Global&quot;. Formula One announced on January 31, 2024, that it had rejected Andretti&#x27;s latest bid to join the sport by 2026, but that it was leaving the door open for an admission from 2028.

In October 2024, Andretti stepped down as CEO of Andretti Global, with the company announcing that he will remain involved in a strategic advisory capacity while the search for a new CEO begins.

==Other activities==

In 1996, Andretti invested in a Toyota dealership in his home state of Pennsylvania. Among his personal appearances, Andretti appeared as a contestant on season 5 of the reality TV series &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, which debuted in February 2012. Andretti joined the show as a last-minute replacement for his son Marco, who dropped out when Marco&#x27;s friend Dan Wheldon was killed in the 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship hours before &quot;Apprentice&quot; filming was scheduled to begin. Andretti was fired in the fourth episode, after a presentation for Buick executives of the Buick Verano. In March 2012, Andretti Sports Marketing took over as promoter of the Milwaukee Mile IndyCar race. The company also promoted the Indy Grand Prix of Louisiana, the Miami ePrix and the Global RallyCross Championship events at Washington and New York.

==Personal life==
Andretti was married to Sandra &quot;Sandy&quot; Spinozzi from November 1985 to 1996 and they had two children, son Marco (born March 13, 1987) and daughter Marissa (born October 31, 1990). He remarried on December 24, 1997, to Leslie Wood. They had a son, Lucca, born September 16, 1999. Andretti officially separated from Wood in 2003, and filed for divorce on September 7, 2004. Two years later, on July 15, 2006, Andretti announced his engagement to former Miss Oregon Teen USA 1994, Playboy Playmate of the Year 1999, model and actress Jodi Ann Paterson. The couple were married on October 7, 2006, at the Andretti Winery in Napa Valley, California. They have twin children, Mario and Miati (Mia), born February 13, 2014. The couple resides in Fishers, Indiana.

==Awards==

Andretti was inducted into National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 2002, the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2008, the Long Beach Grand Prix Walk of Fame in 2010, the Canadian Motorsports (International Division) Hall of Fame in 2012, and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 2012.

<text>The Buddhist Society is a UK registered charity which aims to encourage the study and practice of Buddhist principles.

The Buddhist Society is an inter-denominational and non-sectarian lay organisation. It offers talks and classes on the teachings of all the different major mainstream Buddhist schools and traditions, as well as a structured programme of courses on general Buddhism, for both the public and members. It has a publishing programme and in its premises houses one of the main libraries in Britain on Buddhism. It is managed by an elected council and its patron is the 14th Dalai Lama.

Among other publications, it produces &quot;The Buddhist Directory&quot;, a reference book which lists the vast majority of Buddhist groups, centres and other related organisations in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and &quot;The Middle Way&quot;, a quarterly journal (referring to the Buddhist concept of a Middle Way).

==History==
The Society was originally created in 1924 in London as an offshoot of a Theosophical Lodge by Christmas Humphreys, a British judge and convert to Buddhism. It became an independent body in 1926, by then Buddhist and no longer associated with Theosophy, and Humphreys remained its president until his death in 1983. In 1961 the 14th Dalai Lama became patron of the Society, the first organisation in the West to be so honoured.

The Buddhist Society was one of the first Buddhist organisations outside Asia and remains one of the oldest in Europe to date.

== Activities ==

The Buddhist Society runs a number of classes, courses and lectures, many of which are open to the general public. This includes Saturday meditation classes and popular Tuesday and Thursday lunchtime sessions. More specific members classes are offered in the Zen, Theravadan and Tibetan traditions. The Society is open on occasional Sundays to the public for &#x27;Zen Sundays&#x27;, &#x27;Theravadan Sundays&#x27; and a Pure Land class.

Three courses are taught at the Society representing three levels of Buddhist study, the first of which, ‘Introducing Buddhism’, is free and open to the public. This can be followed by the Intermediate and advanced, &#x27;Great Way&#x27; courses. A Correspondence Course is also available to those who are unable to study at a Buddhist centre.

Free public lectures are held at least once a month on a Wednesday evening. Topics are varied and concern not only the practical application of Buddhism but its cultural and historical aspects too. The guest speakers include academic as well as spiritual scholars of Buddhism. Special function days are held four times a year on Saturdays and are intended for those who do not live in London.
A Summer School is held annually in August, too. This one-week residential course is open to members of all Buddhist schools and explores the major aspects of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings and their practice. The Summer School is highly popular and is now in its 63rd year (2014).

== Publishing ==
For more than 50 years The Buddhist Society has published Buddhist works and continues to do so today. The Buddhist Directory is a comprehensive directory of Buddhist groups and organisations in the UK and Ireland. It also gives details of sizeable library collections, publishers and retailers of Buddhist literature and items.

The Society continues to print a selection of Buddhist classics and important new works including some titles by its founder Christmas Humphreys. Books can be bought by mail-order or in person at the Society.

&quot;The Middle Way&quot; is the quarterly journal of the Buddhist Society and has been in print since 1926 originally under the title &quot;Buddhism in England&quot;. The journal is respected worldwide and contains news and articles on Buddhist practice and history as well as details of the Society&#x27;s programme. Non-members can take out a subscription without joining the society.

== Facilities ==

In 1956 the Buddhist Society moved to its present location at 58 Eccleston Square in south-west London. The library on the ground floor, which began with just a few volumes in 1926, is now a collection in excess of 4,500 volumes. Members can request books by post and renew them by email and there is an online catalogue on the Society&#x27;s website. The library also houses a small bookstall and offers items such as incense and cards for sale.

The Society&#x27;s Audio Department offers CDs and tapes of public lectures and courses for sale at a small cost and there is a free tape library for the registered blind.

The building also has a lecture hall and two shrine rooms and is a treasure house of Buddhist statuary and artefacts presented to the Society by donors from around the world.

== Membership ==

Membership includes subscription to &quot;The Middle Way&quot;, access to all lectures, classes and courses and full use of the library services.

The Buddhist Society is located close to Victoria Station and is open to all Monday to Friday from 2pm to 6pm and on Saturdays until 5pm.

<text>Universidad del Sagrado Corazón (English: University of the Sacred Heart), abbreviated &quot;USC&quot; and often called simply Sagrado, is a private Catholic university in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is one of the oldest and largest educational institutions in Puerto Rico with origins dating back to the 1880 establishment of an elementary school by the Society of the Sacred Heart.

The university is situated in an area which was urbanized in the first decades of the twentieth century with great residences that belonged to the privileged families of the time and is rich in architectural styles. Renowned architect Antonín Nechodoma located his residence in Monteflores and some residences designed by him are still in the area. Including buildings with the unique French-style neoclassic architectural characteristics of the residence of Pablo Ubarri, Count of Santurce, which is now the center of the university&#x27;s main campus. Such buildings abound along with Puerto Rican adaptations of Victorian architecture. There are also homes in the &quot;tropical&quot; U.S. influenced Mission Revival, French-gothic, Spanish Colonial Revival, Prairie School, and several apartment structures of the &quot;Art Deco&quot; periods in Bouret street.

== History ==
It was the year 1880 when three nuns of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus landed on the docks of San Juan, coming from Havana, Cuba. Their mission was to establish in Puerto Rico the educational and spiritual work that just 80 years before Mother Madeleine Sophie Barat had begun in France.

At the beginning of the 20th century the institution acquired the Count of Santurce Estate and established the foundations of what makes-up today&#x27;s campus.

In 1935, the local government issued the Letter Foundation, whereby it established the College of the Sacred Heart. Four years later, in 1939, the institution granted its first academic degrees. The original founding purpose was as an educational center for women in Puerto Rico to achieve ample knowledge, not only for their personal enrichment, but for the benefit of the territory.

In 1970, the religious order opted to transfer ownership and governance of the institution to the Board of Trustees (composed of some religious, but mostly lay members). This transition allowed for the notable expansion of academic offerings and student body.

In February 1972, a change in the institution&#x27;s original vision took place. The Board of Trustees approved the establishment of an entirely co-ed institution. In December 1976, the Board of Trustees authorized the use of the new official name: &quot;Universidad del Sagrado Corazon&quot; (USC) or University of the Sacred Heart (USH). In &quot;1985&quot;, the university established the first three graduate programs in: Education, Communications, and Business Administration.

In October 1984, Pope John Paul II held a mass at the university during the first and only Papal visit to Puerto Rico.In 1990, the university began to limit the number of undergraduate students accepted, in order to raise academic standards.

In January 2019, the division of continuing education was rebranded Sagrado Global, the School of Professional Studies at Sagrado, and started offering professional certificates in Digital marketing, Data Analytics, and Graphic Design, among others. These professional certificates, some of which are also offered remotely, require taking 6 courses and can be completed in 1 year or less.

In 2019, the university had its first School of Music graduates with seven obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in music.
In 2019, Socorro Juliá- one of the oldest faces of the university was interviewed by El Vocero. She stated that she has been affiliated with the university since she was 5 years old, long before her religious calling.

In 2019, the university joined forced with the Santurce Cultural Center in an initiative to help business owners by offering free business workshops and help local business explore ways to grow their business.

<text>Keith Philip Andrews (June 15, 1920 – May 15, 1957) was an American racecar driver. He was killed after crashing his car during practice for the 1957 Indianapolis 500.

==Death==
Giuseppe Farina was the only European driver on the entry list for the 1957 Indy 500, however, he did not attempt to qualify. Farina had difficulty getting his car up to speed, and had experienced handling problems. On May 15, Andrews stepped into Farina&#x27;s car for a test run, but crashed. Down the frontstretch, Andrews began to slide, and when he attempted to correct, the car backed into the inside wall separating the pit area. Andrews was crushed to death between the cowl and the fuel tank, but no fire broke out. Farina withdrew after Andrews was killed, with no backup car to use.

<text>The Green Mountain Peace and Justice Party (GMPJP), previously named the Liberty Union Party (LUP) until 2021, is a socialist political party in Vermont, United States. LUP was formed in 1970 by progressives to contest the 1970 Senate election.

GMPJP is a self-proclaimed &quot;non-violent socialist party&quot;. In 1995, LUP was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as the cradle of progressivism in Vermont.

GMPJP is the fourth-largest party in Vermont after the Democratic, Republican, and Progressive parties.

Notable past and present members include William H. Meyer, Peter Diamondstone, Bernie Sanders, Michael Parenti, and Mary Alice Herbert.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The Liberty Union party (LUP) was formed to contest the Vermont elections of 1970. LUP co-founders included former Congressman William H. Meyer, Peter Diamondstone, Dennis Morrisseau and others.

=== 1970s–1990s ===
In 1971, People&#x27;s Party was formed as a national umbrella party for various socialist-oriented state parties, including the LUP.

In 1971, Bernie Sanders joined LUP and became the party&#x27;s candidate for several offices. At the first party meeting he attended, in 1971, LUP nominated Sanders as the LUP Senate candidate in the January 1972 special election; he placed third with 2% of the vote. In 1974, Bernie Sanders ran again as the Senate candidate, but received 4.13% of the vote. In 1976, Sanders was the party&#x27;s candidate for Vermont governor, where he received 6.1% of the vote, which remains the best result for any LUP candidate for governor as of 2021. In October 1977, At the time of his resignation from the party, Sanders was party chairman. Sanders quit due to the inactivity of the party between elections. As an independent politician, Sanders became Vermont&#x27;s congressional representative in 1991 and US senator in 2007. He ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020.

In 1974, political scientist Michael Parenti was the party&#x27;s candidate for election to the House of Representatives; he placed third with 7.1 percent of the vote.

In 1976, the party&#x27;s Vermont lieutenant governor candidate John Franco took enough votes to force the election to the Vermont General Assembly&#x27;s House. The party also lost the outspoken members, Nancy Kaufman and Martha Abbott before the 1978 election cycle. Despite Liberty Union co-founder, Peter Diamondstone, appearing biennially on the ballot from 1970 through 2016, none of the party&#x27;s candidates were elected during that period.

=== 2000s–present ===
In 2009, David Van Deusen, endorsed by LUP and the Vermont Progressive Party (VPP), won a contested race for a seat on the Moretown Select Board. Van Deusen was a District Vice President of the Vermont AFL-CIO, active within US Labor Against The War, cofounder of the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective, and received the backing of organized labor. This victory represented an electoral high water mark for the Liberty Union Party (previous Liberty Union wins included a Representational Town Meeting Delegate in Brattleboro, and a single Justice of the Peace position some decades earlier). In 2010 Van Deusen again ran and again won a contested seat on the Moretown Select Board. Again he was endorsed by the Liberty Union, the Progressives, the Socialist Party USA, and organized labor. In this election Van Deusen was the top vote-getter among four Select Board candidates (three candidates, including Van Deusen running for two one year seats, and one candidate running as a write-in for one open three-year seat). In 2011 Van Deusen did not seek re-election to the Select Board. In this election he ran for First Constable of Moretown (a position he held in 2007). While Van Deusen won the election, he did not seek the endorsement of the Liberty Union Party. This time he had the endorsement of the local Progressive Party alone. During Van Deusen&#x27;s two terms on the Moretown Select Board, he was able to win &quot;livable wages&quot; for all non-elected town employees, doubled property tax relief for disabled military veterans (through a Town Meeting article), successfully advocated for the use of the Town Hall for a free weekly children&#x27;s play group, made strides in opening up the local democratic process to all town residents, and publicly supported a Vermont run single-payer healthcare system.

In 2012, the party once again re-qualified for major party status as a result of a 13.1% showing for Liberty Union candidate Mary Alice Herbert in the election for Vermont Secretary of State against Democrat Jim Condos.

In 2014, the party re-qualified for major party status yet again as a result of a 10.32 showing for Liberty Union candidate Mary Alice Herbert in the election for Vermont Secretary of State. In the race for Treasurer Murray Ngoima received 8.3% of the vote. For Attorney General the LU candidate, Rosemary Jackowski, received 3.9% of the vote. In VT State Senate races, Ben Bosley won 13.9% of the vote for Grand Isle district. In the Windham County Senate contest, Jerry Levy &amp; Aaron Diamondstone won on 5.0% &amp; 4.6% of the ballots.

In the 2016 Vermont gubernatorial election, former Boston Red Sox and Montreal Expos pitcher Bill &quot;Spaceman&quot; Lee ran as the Liberty Union&#x27;s candidate for governor. Lee supported single payer healthcare and ran far to the left of the Democratic Party while at the same time remaining an advocate for the right of Vermonters to own firearms. Lee received 2.8% which was the highest percentage for a LUP candidate for governor since the 1978 Vermont election and at the same time garnered 8,912 votes, second highest number for a Liberty Union gubernatorial candidate in the party&#x27;s history.

In other 2016 races, Murray Ngoima received 3.9% of the vote for Treasurer, Mary Alice Herbert 9.7% for secretary state, Marina Brown 4.7% for Auditor and Rosemarie Jackowski 3.7% for attorney general. For US House, Erica Clawson received 9.2% of the vote. Liberty Union Party co-founder, Peter Diamondstone received 1.0% of the vote for US Senate.

In 2018 elections, Emily Peyton received 0.6% of the vote for Governorship, Murray Ngoima received 1.5% for lieutenant governor, Mary Alice Herbert received 3.6% for Secretary of State, Marina Brown received 3.9% for Auditor and Rosemarie Jackowski received 3.4% for Attorney General. For US House, Laura Potter received 1.4% of the vote. For US Senate, Reid Kane received 0.4% of the vote.

In 2020, the Liberty Union Party did not nominate any candidates for statewide office. They only nominated Gloria La Riva for presidency.

In September 2021, the party changed its name from Liberty Union to Green Mountain Peace and Justice. Jessica Diamondstone, party chair and daughter of the party&#x27;s founder stated that she feared the old name might make the party sound as if it had right-wing positions. Diamondstone felt the new name would be more clear on the political positions of the party.

In 2022, under its new name, Green Mountain Peace and Justice Party nominees ran only for US Senate and Lieutenant Governor seats. For US Senate, Natasha Diamondstone-Kohout received 0.5% of the vote and for Lieutenant Governor, Ian Diamondstone received 2.9% of the vote. Both candidates were related to Peter Diamondstone.

In 2024 elections, Justin Schoville received 1.24% of the vote for governorship, Ian Diamondstone received 3.9% for lieutenant governor, Kevin Gustafson received 4.95% for Attorney General. For US House of Representatives Jessy Diamondstone received 2.15% of the vote and for US Senate Justin Schoville received 0.92% of the vote.

<doc id="1048972" wikidata="Q1138539" url="?curid=1048972" title="Samoa national rugby union team">
<text>The Samoa national rugby union team represents the Samoa Rugby Union in men&#x27;s international rugby union. They are also known as &quot;Manu Samoa&quot;, which is thought to derive from the name of a Samoan warrior. They perform a traditional Samoan challenge called the siva tau before each game. Samoa Rugby Union were formerly members of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) along with Fiji and Tonga. They are ranked 11th in the world.

Rugby was introduced to Samoa in the early 1920s and a governing body was soon formed. The first international was played as Western Samoa against Fiji in August 1924. Along with Tonga, these nations would meet regularly and eventually contest competitions such as the Pacific Tri-Nations – with Western Samoa winning the first of these. From 1924 to 1997 Samoa was known as Western Samoa.

Samoa have been to every Rugby World Cup since the 1991 tournament. That tournament, along with the 1995 competition, saw them make the quarterfinals. Under their new coach, former New Zealand and Samoan international player Michael Jones, Samoa competed in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. However, Samoa had a dismal World Cup campaign, winning only one match and finishing fourth in their group. Samoa showed an improved performance at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, winning two matches by comfortable margins, and losing close matches to South Africa and Wales.

==History==
The Marist Brothers brought rugby to Western Samoa in 1924 and The Western Samoa Rugby Football Union was formed in 1924. On 18 August 1924, Western Samoa played its first international against Fiji in the capital Apia, the visitors winning 6–0. The match was played at 7am to allow the Samoans time to get to work afterwards and was played on a pitch with a large tree on the halfway line. The return match was won 9–3 by Samoa to draw the series.

In 1954 Western Samoa visited both Pacific Island neighbors Fiji and Tonga, but had to wait a further 20 years before a tour of New Zealand took place. The Samoans won one of eight matches on that tour.

The traditional tri-series between Tonga, Fiji and Western Samoa was established in 1982 with Western Samoa winning the first tournament. Wales visited Western Samoa and won the test 32–16 at Apia. The tour led to a return visit to Wales which brought Western Samoa out of International limbo, although Western Samoa were not invited to the first Rugby World Cup in 1987.

The following year a 14-match tour of Europe took place before a World Cup elimination series in Tokyo, which gave Western Samoa a place in the 1991 Rugby World Cup in Britain. They made a huge impact. After sweeping aside Wales 16–13 in Cardiff and defeating Argentina 35–12, and narrowly losing 3–9 to eventual champions Australia in their pool match, Western Samoa, a country with a population of 160,000, found itself in the quarterfinals against Scotland at Murrayfield. The Scots won comfortably 28–6, but the Samoans were clearly the personality team of the tournament. One Welsh fan ruefully remarked after Wales&#x27;s defeat, &quot;It&#x27;s a good job we weren&#x27;t playing all of Samoa.&quot;

Over the next two years, the side had a number of notable wins. The most outstanding achievements were in Sevens where it won the 1993 Hong Kong and 1992 Middlesex Sevens. The 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa proved that the team belonged in top company. They again reached the quarterfinals after wins over Argentina and Italy, but were beaten 42–14 by the eventual winners South Africa. After the Cup, Manu Samoa made a 13-match tour of England and Scotland, drawing 15–15 with the Scots and going down 27–9 to England.

With the advent of professional rugby in 1995 it was vital for Manu Samoa to develop a new administrative structure. This was made possible with Fay Richwhite and the Western Samoan Rugby Union joining forces to form Manu Samoa Rugby Limited. Fay Richwhite invested $5 million from 1995 to 2004 into Samoan rugby.

Samoa emerged from the 1999 World Cup with its honor intact after another shock 38–31 victory over host nation Wales in the pool stages. They again lost out to Scotland in the quarterfinal play-off.

Manu Samoa qualified for the 2003 World Cup with a 17–16 loss against Fiji, Earl Va&#x27;a missing an injury-time penalty. They recovered to beat Tonga both home and away and avenged that Fijian defeat with a 22–12 win in Nadi. They ultimately had to settle for second place in the round robin, behind Fiji on points difference, and a place in the tougher of the two Rugby World Cup 2003 pools alongside automatic qualifiers England and South Africa. In one of the games of the tournament, they led eventual champions England for most of the game before losing 35–22.

Samoa qualified for the 2011 World Cup after beating Papua New Guinea 73–12 in Port Moresby on 18 July 2009. They won 188–19 on aggregate over two matches against Papua New Guinea, having won 115–7 at Apia Park the previous week.

Samoa began their 2011 World Cup campaign preparation with a flying start, after registering an upset against No.2 ranked Australia with a four-try-to-two win of 32–23.

In November 2017, Samoa&#x27;s prime minister and SRU chairman Tuila&#x27;epa Sa&#x27;ilele Malielegaoi announced that the organisation was bankrupt, although those claims were denied by world governing body World Rugby.

==Overall record==

Below is table of the representative rugby matches played by a Samoa national XV at test level up until 21 September 2024.

==New Zealand connection==

Western Samoa&#x27;s triumph in the 1991 Rugby World Cup was inspired by their assistant coach Bryan Williams, who was a New Zealand-born (of Samoan descent) All Black great of the 1970s. The 1991 Samoan World Cup team included many New Zealand born or raised players; the catalyst was Auckland prop Peter Fatialofa, who in 1989, became the first major New Zealand-based player to play for Samoa. By the time of the 1991 World Cup several other New Zealand-born Samoans like Pat Lam, Stephen Bachop, Frank Bunce and Apollo Perelini had joined him. New Zealand born players with Samoan parentage have played for Samoa, such as Earl Va&#x27;a, Pat Lam and Lome Fa&#x27;atau.

The rugby relationship that exists between New Zealand and Samoa is a complex one. Close ties exist between the two countries, these bonds first being formed with the start of mass Polynesian migration to New Zealand in the latter half of the twentieth century. At the 2007 World Cup, there were 14 New Zealand-born players in the Samoan squad. The only team with more foreign born players in their squad was Italy who had 15.

==Strips==

Manu Samoa play in blue and white uniforms, with the home strip consisting of blue jerseys, white shorts and blue socks and the away kit being with the colours reversed. Since 2007, the flag of Samoa has been featured on the left sleeve and pe&#x27;a-like patterns were incorporated into the jerseys. Sponsored logos appear on jerseys for matches other than the Rugby World Cup, where branding, except for equipment manufacturers, is not allowed.

<text>Elio de Angelis (26 March 1958 – 15 May 1986) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . De Angelis won two Formula One Grands Prix across eight seasons.

De Angelis competed in Formula One for Shadow, Lotus and Brabham, winning two Grands Prix across eight seasons. He finished third in the 1984 World Drivers&#x27; Championship with Lotus. De Angelis was a very competitive and highly popular presence in Formula One during the 1980s, and is sometimes referred to as Formula One&#x27;s &quot;last gentleman player&quot;.

In May 1986, de Angelis was killed in an accident whilst testing the Brabham BT55 at Paul Ricard. 

==Early life==
De Angelis was born in Rome. His father Giulio was an inshore and offshore powerboat racer who won many world championships in the 1960s and 1970s.

After a brief spell with karts, de Angelis went on to win the Italian Formula Three Championship in 1977. In 1978 he raced in Formula Two for Minardi and then for the ICI British F2 Team, he also competed in one round of the British Formula One championship and won the prestigious Monaco F3 race.

==Formula One==
At the end of the 1977 season, de Angelis was on Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s short list to replace Niki Lauda. De Angelis successfully tested the Ferrari at the Fiorano circuit but eventually Ferrari decided to hire Gilles Villeneuve. De Angelis&#x27;s debut Formula One season was in with Shadow. He finished seventh in his maiden Grand Prix in Argentina and 15th in the championship with three points.

De Angelis&#x27;s performance with Shadow caught the eye of Lotus boss Colin Chapman, who hired him to partner Mario Andretti in . At the age of 21, de Angelis became the youngest Grand Prix podium finisher of all time when he finished second at the Brazilian Grand Prix, run at the Interlagos circuit.

His first victory came in the 1982 Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring, 0.05 seconds ahead of the Williams of eventual World Champion Keke Rosberg. The win was the last hailed by Colin Chapman&#x27;s act of throwing his cloth cap into the air. Chapman died in December that year and Peter Warr became the new Lotus team manager.

In , Lotus switched from the Cosworth DFV they had been using since , to Renault turbo engines, but it was a disappointing season, suffering multiple mechanical failures. De Angelis&#x27;s best result was a fifth place in the 1983 Italian Grand Prix.

In , de Angelis had a much better season, scoring a total of 34 points and finishing third in the standings with three podiums. His best result was a second place at the Detroit Grand Prix. De Angelis was the only driver to finish in the top 5 in 1984 not to score a race win, showing his consistent performances throughout the season with the improving Lotus-Renault.

In , de Angelis was joined at Lotus by Ayrton Senna, who had left the Toleman team. De Angelis&#x27;s second win came in the third race of the season, at the 1985 San Marino Grand Prix, after Alain Prost was disqualified when his McLaren MP4/2B was found 2 kg underweight. De Angelis also claimed his last Formula One pole position that year in Canada. He finished fifth in the championship, with 33 points, five points behind his teammate. However, de Angelis chose to leave Lotus at the end of the season, frustrated that the team&#x27;s efforts were being focused mostly on Senna.

De Angelis&#x27;s drive for was with Brabham, as a replacement for twice World Champion Nelson Piquet, who had moved to Williams to join de Angelis&#x27;s former Lotus teammate Nigel Mansell. Fellow Italian Riccardo Patrese was his teammate. Patrese was returning to the Bernie Ecclestone owned team after two unhappy years with Alfa Romeo.

The 1986 Brabham-BMW, the BT55, was the brainchild of long time Brabham designer Gordon Murray. The BT55 was a lowline car with a reduced frontal area, the idea being to have a cleaner airflow over the car to create more downforce, while at the same time reducing the car&#x27;s drag. The chassis proved effective, unlike the I4 BMW turbo that had to be tilted to an angle of 72°. This caused severe oil surge and an even greater lack of throttle response than the BMW had become famous for. Although the team worked hard to overcome these problems, it was clear from early in the season that Brabham had fallen behind the leading pack.

==Death and aftermath==
In May 1986, during tests at the Paul Ricard circuit in France, the rear wing of de Angelis&#x27;s BT55 detached at high speed resulting in the car losing downforce on the rear wheels, which instigated a cartwheel over a crash barrier, causing the car to catch fire. The impact itself did not kill de Angelis but he was unable to extract himself from the car unassisted. The situation was exacerbated by the lack of track marshals on the circuit who could have provided him with emergency assistance. A 30-minute delay ensued before a helicopter arrived and de Angelis died 29 hours later, at the hospital in Marseille where he had been taken, from smoke inhalation. His actual crash impact injuries were only a broken collar bone and light burns on his back. 

De Angelis&#x27;s death also saw the end of Formula One using the full 5.812 km (3.612 mi) Paul Ricard Circuit. F1 cars started using the 3.812 km (2.369 mi) &quot;Club&quot; version of the circuit, bypassing the Verriere curves where the Brabham had crashed, and cutting the length of the Mistral Straight from 1.8 to 1 km in length. The move was unpopular with many of the drivers, although others did like the reduced straight length as it was easier on the engines. Paul Ricard would not host a race on the full layout until , which featured sharper Verriere curves and a chicane on Mistral effectively cutting the straight to two 800m straights.

De Angelis&#x27;s place in the Brabham team was subsequently taken by Derek Warwick, allegedly because Warwick was the only available top level driver who did not contact team owner Bernie Ecclestone immediately after de Angelis&#x27;s death asking to replace him. McLaren driver Keke Rosberg, who was a close friend of de Angelis, retired at the end of the 1986 season.

De Angelis was the last driver to die in a Formula One car until Roland Ratzenberger died during qualifying for the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola eight years later. The day after Ratzenberger&#x27;s death, de Angelis&#x27;s former Lotus teammate and three times World Champion Ayrton Senna died from injuries sustained in a crash on the seventh lap when his Williams-Renault crashed into the Tamburello Curve wall at approximately .

==Legacy==
De Angelis was a concert-standard pianist, and famously kept his fellow Formula One drivers entertained with his skills by playing multiple concertos by Chopin and Mozart, while they locked themselves in a Johannesburg hotel before the 1982 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami when the Grand Prix Drivers Association held a strike in protest at the new Super Licence conditions imposed by the governing body, the FIA.

The French-Italian driver Jean Alesi, who broke into the sport in , wore a helmet that matched de Angelis&#x27;s design, in tribute to his semi-compatriot. 

In 2017 de Angelis was honoured at the Ludovico Scarfiotti Memorial in Rome.

<text>Marco Apicella (born 7 October 1965) is an Italian former professional racing driver. He competed in one Formula One Grand Prix for the Jordan team in the 1993 Italian Grand Prix. He later won the 1994 Japanese Formula 3000 Championship driving for Dome.

== Career ==
Marco Apicella was born in Bologna on 7 October 1965. He began competing in Formula Three racing in 1984, and took victory for Scuderia Coloni in the first two rounds of the 1986 Italian Formula Three season. Apicella competed in the 1985 Macau Grand Prix, where he failed to finish.
=== International Formula 3000 (1987–1991) ===
Apicella&#x27;s first season in International Formula 3000, 1987, was uncompetitive in the EuroVenturini Dallara car, only scoring one point thanks to a fifth place at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit. During the same year, he tested the Minardi Formula One car at the Autódromo do Estoril circuit. Apicella moved to the FIRST team for the 1988 season and was a title favourite for the season. He bought the March Engineering car to a second-place finish in the Monza race, but was not as competitive as teammate Pierluigi Martini. The team underperformed, but in 1989, again with FIRST (who had made a change to Reynard Motorsport cars), Apicella achieved several podium finishes on his way to finishing fourth overall in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Apicella looked like a championship contender for the 1990 season and continued with the FIRST team, but his performances worsened as the season progressed, ending with a disqualification in the Brands Hatch round. A crash at the Pau Grand Prix prevented him from claiming his first win. Despite a poor 1990 season, Apicella had the chance to test drive with the Modena and Minardi teams. Late in the year, he went to Japan and did some tests for Bridgestone in a Reynard-Mugen Formula One prototype car. Apicella chose to change teams for the 1991 season, moving to Paul Stewart Racing, teaming up with Stewart himself. He was classified fifth overall at the end of the season. Apicella was able to score podiums, but not victories, in the Lola car. Apicella started more International F3000 races than any other winless driver.

=== Japanese Formula 3000 (1992–1993) ===
With no offers for a drive in International F3000 for 1992, Apicella went to Japan to drive in the Japanese Formula 3000 series, setting up a relationship with the Dome team. Apicella came tenth in the standings, the best of any Dome driver. Apicella, driving the Dome F103 won the fifth round of the championship that year. He continued to improve, finishing fourth in the 1993 season, winning at the Sugo race circuit.

=== Formula One ===
Apicella&#x27;s good performances in Japan during 1992 and early 1993 gave him a drive at the Jordan Formula One team for his home race in the 1993 season, with team boss Eddie Jordan wanting to try out up-and-coming Formula 3000 drivers. He replaced Thierry Boutsen. Apicella tested the Jordan 193 car at Imola before the race weekend. During practice for the race he spun on the moist tarmac at the second Lesmo corner. He qualified in 23rd position, half a second behind teammate Barrichello, who set his times later in the session after the circuit had become less damp. It was the first time Apicella had driven a racing car with a semi-automatic gearbox. Apicella retired at the first corner of the first lap of the race after a multi-car collision. He was replaced by Emanuele Naspetti for the following round in Portugal. As a result of this, he is falsely considered to have had the shortest Formula 1 career out of any driver, a record held by Ernst Loof. Apicella retired after driving 800 metres, while Loof&#x27;s car broke down as it was pulling away from the starting grid.

=== Japanese Formula 3000/Formula Nippon (1994–1996) ===
For 1994, Apicella continued with Dome in Japanese Formula 3000, winning at the Mine, Suzuka and Fuji circuits on his way to winning the title. He continued in Japanese F3000 for 1995 and 1996 (the series being renamed Formula Nippon for 1996), this time with Team 5Zigen, but his activities were limited, as he chose to do other motor sport activities such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Apicella was appointed Chief Test Driver with Dome for 1996, testing the Dome F105 car alongside Shinji Nakano and Katsumi Yamamoto from April to June 1996 at the Suzuka Circuit. The aim was for the car to produce a base for them to mount a challenge into Formula One, but the project was shelved after the car was substantially damaged in an accident.

Apicella&#x27;s last season in the Formula Nippon series was in 1997, driving for the Stellar International team. His best result for the team was a fourth place at the Mine circuit.

=== Other series (1999–2009) ===
Apicella moved back to Italy for 1999, competing in the Italian Formula 3000 championship. He scored two wins during the season on his way to third place in the championship. Apicella also tried to qualify for the Spa round of the International Formula 3000 championship in 1999 for Monaco Motorsport, but failed to do so due to adverse weather conditions. Apicella has since gone back to Japan, to compete in touring cars with the All Japan GT Championship.

Apicella has also competed in several 24 Hours of Le Mans races. He was scheduled to compete in the 2007 event with the JLOC Isao Noritake team, but on the first day of practice he was involved in an accident on the Mulsanne Straight, which heavily damaged his Lamborghini Murciélago car. Apicella competed in the 2009 event, again with the JLOC team. This and a start for JLOC in the 2009 Super GT Series saw the end of Apicella&#x27;s professional racing career.

<doc id="1048987" wikidata="Q2120121" url="?curid=1048987" title="Self-incompatibility">
<text>Self-incompatibility (SI) is a general name for several genetic mechanisms that prevent self-fertilization in sexually reproducing organisms, and thus encourage outcrossing and allogamy. It is contrasted with separation of sexes among individuals (dioecy), and their various modes of spatial (herkogamy) and temporal (dichogamy) separation.

SI is best-studied and particularly common in flowering plants, although it is present in other groups, including sea squirts and fungi. In plants with SI, when a pollen grain produced in a plant reaches a stigma of the same plant or another plant with a matching allele or genotype, the process of pollen germination, pollen-tube growth, ovule fertilization, or embryo development is inhibited, and consequently no seeds are produced. SI is one of the most important means of preventing inbreeding and promoting the generation of new genotypes in plants and it is considered one of the causes of the spread and success of angiosperms on Earth.

==Mechanisms of single-locus self-incompatibility==
The best studied mechanisms of SI act by inhibiting the germination of pollen on stigmas, or the elongation of the pollen tube in the styles. These mechanisms are based on protein-protein interactions, and the best-understood mechanisms are controlled by a single locus termed S, which has many different alleles in the species population. Despite their similar morphological and genetic manifestations, these mechanisms have evolved independently, and are based on different cellular components; therefore, each mechanism has its own, unique S-genes.

The S-locus contains two basic protein coding regions – one expressed in the pistil, and the other in the anther and/or pollen (referred to as the female and male determinants, respectively). Due to their physical proximity, these are genetically linked, and are inherited as a unit. The units are called S-haplotypes. The translation products of the two regions of the S-locus are two proteins which, by interacting with one another, lead to the arrest of pollen germination and/or pollen tube elongation, and thereby generate an SI response, preventing fertilization. However, when a female determinant interacts with a male determinant of a different haplotype, no SI is created, and fertilization ensues. This is a simplistic description of the general mechanism of SI, which is more complicated, and in some species the S-haplotype contains more than two protein coding regions. 

Following is a detailed description of the different known mechanisms of SI in plants. 

===Gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI)===
In gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI), the SI phenotype of the pollen is determined by its own gametophytic haploid genotype. This is the most common type of SI. Two different mechanisms of GSI have been described in detail at the molecular level, and their description follows. 

====The RNase mechanism====
In this mechanism, pollen tube elongation is halted when it has proceeded approximately one third of the way through the style. The female component ribonuclease protein, termed S-RNase probably causes degradation of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) inside the pollen tube, in the case of identical male and female S alleles, and consequently pollen tube elongation is arrested, and the pollen grain dies.

Within a decade of the initial confirmation their role in GSI, proteins belonging to the same RNase gene family were also found to cause pollen rejection in species of Rosaceae and Plantaginaceae. Despite initial uncertainty about the common ancestry of RNase-based SI in these distantly related plant families, phylogenetic studies and the finding of shared male determinants (F-box proteins) strongly supported homology across eudicots. Therefore, this mechanism likely arose approximately 90 million years ago, and is the inferred ancestral state for approximately 50% of all plant species.

In the past decade, the predictions about the wide distribution of this mechanism of SI have been confirmed, placing additional support of its single ancient origin. Specifically, a style-expressed T2/S-RNase gene and pollen-expressed F-box genes are now implicated in causing SI among the members of Rubiaceae, Rutaceae, and Cactaceae. Therefore, other mechanisms of SI are thought to be recently derived in eudicots plants, in some cases relatively recently. One particularly interesting case is the Prunus SI systems, which functions through self-recognition (the cytotoxic activity of the S-RNAses is inhibited by default and selectively activated by the pollen partner SFB upon self-pollination), [where &quot;SFB&quot; is a term that stands &quot;for S-haplotype-specific F-box protein&quot;, as explained (parenthetically) in the abstract of], while SI in the other species with S-RNAse functions through non-self recognition (the S-RNAses are selectively detoxified upon cross-pollination).

====The S-glycoprotein mechanism====
In this mechanism, pollen growth is inhibited within minutes of its placement on the stigma. The mechanism is described in detail for &quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot; and so far appears restricted to the plant family Papaveraceae. 

The female determinant is a small, extracellular molecule, expressed in the stigma; the identity of the male determinant remains elusive, but it is probably some cell membrane receptor. The interaction between male and female determinants transmits a cellular signal into the pollen tube, resulting in strong influx of calcium cations; this interferes with the intracellular concentration gradient of calcium ions which exists inside the pollen tube, essential for its elongation. The influx of calcium ions arrests tube elongation within 1–2 minutes. At this stage, pollen inhibition is still reversible, and elongation can be resumed by applying certain manipulations, resulting in ovule fertilization.

Subsequently, the cytosolic protein p26, a pyrophosphatase, is inhibited by phosphorylation, possibly resulting in arrest of synthesis of molecular building blocks, required for tube elongation. There is depolymerization and reorganization of actin filaments, within the pollen cytoskeleton. Within 10 minutes from the placement on the stigma, the pollen is committed to a process which ends in its death. At 3–4 hours past pollination, fragmentation of pollen DNA begins, and finally (at 10–14 hours), the cell dies apoptotically.

===Sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI)===
In sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI), the SI phenotype of the pollen is determined by the diploid genotype of the anther (the sporophyte) in which it was created. This form of SI was identified in the families: Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Convolvulaceae, Betulaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Sterculiaceae and Polemoniaceae. Up to this day, only one mechanism of SSI has been described in detail at the molecular level, in &quot;Brassica&quot; (Brassicaceae). 

Since SSI is determined by a diploid genotype, the pollen and pistil each express the translation products of two different alleles, i.e. two male and two female determinants. Dominance relationships often exist between pairs of alleles, resulting in complicated patterns of compatibility/self-incompatibility. These dominance relationships also allow the generation of individuals homozygous for a recessive S allele.

Compared to a population in which all S alleles are co-dominant, the presence of dominance relationships in the population raises the chances of compatible mating between individuals. The frequency ratio between recessive and dominant S alleles reflects a dynamic balance between reproductive assurance (favoured by recessive alleles) and avoidance of selfing (favoured by dominant alleles).

====The SI mechanism in &quot;Brassica&quot;====
As previously mentioned, the SI phenotype of the pollen is determined by the diploid genotype of the anther. In &quot;Brassica&quot;, the pollen coat, derived from the anther&#x27;s tapetum tissue, carries the translation products of the two S alleles. These are small, cysteine-rich proteins. The male determinant is termed SCR or SP11, and is expressed in the anther tapetum as well as in the microspore and pollen (i.e. sporophytically). There are possibly up to 100 polymorphs of the S-haplotype in &quot;Brassica&quot;, and within these there is a dominance hierarchy. 

The female determinant of the SI response in &quot;Brassica&quot;, is a transmembrane protein termed SRK, which has an intracellular kinase domain, and a variable extracellular domain. SRK is expressed in the stigma, and probably functions as a receptor for the SCR/SP11 protein in the pollen coat. Another stigmatic protein, termed SLG, is highly similar in sequence to the SRK protein, and seems to function as a co-receptor for the male determinant, amplifying the SI response.

The interaction between the SRK and SCR/SP11 proteins results in autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain of SRK, and a signal is transmitted into the cell of the stigma. Another protein essential for the SI response is MLPK, a serine-threonine kinase, which is anchored to the plasma membrane from its intracellular side. A downstream signaling cascade leads to proteasomal degradation that produces an SI response.

==Other mechanisms of self-incompatibility==
These mechanisms have received only limited attention in scientific research. Therefore, they are still poorly understood.

===2-locus gametophytic self-incompatibility===
The grass subfamily Pooideae, and perhaps all of the family Poaceae, have a gametophytic self-incompatibility system that involves two unlinked loci referred to as &quot;S&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;. If the alleles expressed at these two loci in the pollen grain both match the corresponding alleles in the pistil, the pollen grain will be recognized as incompatible. At both loci, &quot;S&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;, two male and one female determinant can be found. All four male determinants encode proteins belonging to the same family (DUF247) and are predicted to be membrane-bound. The two female determinants are predicted to be secreted proteins with no protein family membership.

===Heteromorphic self-incompatibility===

A distinct SI mechanism exists in heterostylous flowers, termed heteromorphic self-incompatibility. This mechanism is probably not evolutionarily related to the more familiar mechanisms, which are differentially defined as homomorphic self-incompatibility.

Almost all heterostylous taxa feature SI to some extent. The loci responsible for SI in heterostylous flowers, are strongly linked to the loci responsible for flower polymorphism, and these traits are inherited together. Distyly is determined by a single locus, which has two alleles; tristyly is determined by two loci, each with two alleles. Heteromorphic SI is sporophytic, i.e. both alleles in the male plant, determine the SI response in the pollen. SI loci always contain only two alleles in the population, one of which is dominant over the other, in both pollen and pistil. Variance in SI alleles parallels the variance in flower morphs, thus pollen from one morph can fertilize only pistils from the other morph. In tristylous flowers, each flower contains two types of stamens; each stamen produces pollen capable of fertilizing only one flower morph, out of the three existing morphs.

A population of a distylous plant contains only two SI genotypes: ss and Ss. Fertilization is possible only between genotypes; each genotype cannot fertilize itself. This restriction maintains a 1:1 ratio between the two genotypes in the population; genotypes are usually randomly scattered in space. Tristylous plants contain, in addition to the S locus, the M locus, also with two alleles. The number of possible genotypes is greater here, but a 1:1 ratio exists between individuals of each SI type.

===Cryptic self-incompatibility (CSI)===
Cryptic self-incompatibility (CSI) exists in a limited number of taxa (for example, there is evidence for CSI in &quot;Silene vulgaris&quot;, Caryophyllaceae). In this mechanism, the simultaneous presence of cross and self pollen on the same stigma, results in higher seed set from cross pollen, relative to self pollen. However, as opposed to &#x27;complete&#x27; or &#x27;absolute&#x27; SI, in CSI, self-pollination without the presence of competing cross pollen, results in successive fertilization and seed set; in this way, reproduction is assured, even in the absence of cross-pollination. CSI acts, at least in some species, at the stage of pollen tube elongation, and leads to faster elongation of cross pollen tubes, relative to self pollen tubes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of CSI have not been described. 

The strength of a CSI response can be defined, as the ratio of crossed to selfed ovules, formed when equal amounts of cross and self pollen, are placed upon the stigma; in the taxa described up to this day, this ratio ranges between 3.2 and 11.5.

===Late-acting self-incompatibility (LSI)===
Late-acting self-incompatibility (LSI) is also termed ovarian self-incompatibility (OSI). In this mechanism, self pollen germinates and reaches the ovules, but no fruit is set. LSI can be pre-zygotic (e.g. deterioration of the embryo sac prior to pollen tube entry, as in &quot;Narcissus triandrus&quot;) or post-zygotic (malformation of the zygote or embryo, as in certain species of &quot;Asclepias&quot; and in &quot;Spathodea campanulata&quot;).

The existence of the LSI mechanism among different taxa and in general, is subject for scientific debate. Criticizers claim, that absence of fruit set is due to genetic defects (homozygosity for lethal recessive alleles), which are the direct result of self-fertilization (inbreeding depression). Supporters, on the other hand, argue for the existence of several basic criteria, which differentiate certain cases of LSI from the inbreeding depression phenomenon.

==Self-compatibility (SC)==
Self-compatibility (SC) is the absence of genetic mechanisms which prevent self-fertilization resulting in plants that can reproduce successfully via both self-pollen and pollen from other individuals. Approximately one half of angiosperm species are SI, the remainder being SC. Mutations that disable SI (resulting in SC) may become common or entirely dominate in natural populations. Pollinator decline, variability in pollinator service, the so-called &quot;automatic advantage&quot; of self-fertilisation, among other factors, may favor the loss of SI. 

Many cultivated plants are SC, although there are notable exceptions, such as apples and Brassica oleracea. Human-mediated artificial selection through selective breeding is often responsible for SC among these agricultural crops. SC enables more efficient breeding techniques to be employed for crop improvement. However, when genetically similar SI cultivars are bred, inbreeding depression can cause a cross-incompatible form of SC to arise, such as in apricots and almonds. In this rare, intraspecific, cross-incompatible mechanism, individuals have more reproductive success when self-pollinated rather than when cross-pollinated with other individuals of the same species. In wild populations, intraspecific cross-incompatibility has been observed in &quot;Nothoscordum bivalve&quot;.

<text>WMPG (90.9 FM) is a community radio station broadcasting from Portland, Maine. It is located on Bedford Street at the University of Southern Maine Portland Campus. It is affiliated with the college, and a mix of USM students and volunteers from the greater Portland community produce all the music and local public affairs programs. It broadcasts 4.5 kilowatts on 90.9 (licensed to Gorham, where the main campus of USM is located).

==History==

The station was founded in 1970 by then eighteen year old freshman of the University of Southern Maine Howard Allen. Allen began that station in his dorm room in Anderson Hall on the Gorham campus with a small pirate-radio transmitter, a set of turntables, and his private record collection. At its inception, it was a carrier current station broadcasting under the call sign WGOR. Soon, other students became involved in the station, a club was formed to manage it which was subsequently recognized by the student government, and funded by the student activity fee. The club set up a large antenna on the roof of Anderson Hall which allowed the station&#x27;s weak signal to reach further into the town of Gorham. Since most radio stations in the 1970s were transmitting on the AM frequency, Allen selected a frequency on the FM frequency, and WGOR began emitting a 100 milliwatt signal on 91.FM.

The school administration did not become aware of the station until 1972 when a local newspaper wrote an article about WGOR. Seeing the station&#x27;s educational potential, university administration arranged for Bill Crosby, the chief engineer of Maine Public Broadcasting Network (MPBN) in Orono, to help Allen and the club apply for FCC licensure. The broadcast license was granted by the FCC in the summer 1973 with a 10 watt signal reaching from Gorham to most of Portland. Allen graduated in 1974 leaving the station in the hands of future students.

In 1988 the station upgraded its signal to 1.11 kilowatts and shifted frequency to 90.9 MHz. A 50 watt translator on 104.1 MHz located on Portland&#x27;s Munjoy Hill went on the air in 1999. In 2008 WMPG was granted a construction permit to increase power to 4.5 kilowatts and move transmitting facilities from the Gorham campus of the University of Southern Maine to Blackstrap Mountain in Falmouth. After a lengthy fund-raising effort and a $120,000 US Department of Commerce grant WMPG started broadcasting at half its licensed upgraded power from the new transmitter site on December 14, 2011, one day before the construction permit was to expire. The 104.1 translator was sold to MPBN in 2016.

<text>Sir James Key Caird, 1st Baronet (7 January 1837 – 9 March 1916) was a Scottish jute baron and mathematician. He was one of Dundee&#x27;s most successful entrepreneurs, who used the latest technology in his Ashton and Craigie Mills.

Caird was noted for his interest in providing financial aid for scientific research. He was one of the sponsors of Sir Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s ill-fated Antarctic expedition of 1914 to 1916. The ship&#x27;s boat, the &quot;James Caird&quot;, in which six of Shackleton&#x27;s expedition made an epic voyage of from Elephant Island to South Georgia, was named in appreciation of Caird&#x27;s contribution.

==Biography==
James Caird was born in Dundee, and was the son of Edward Caird (1806–1889) who had founded the firm of Caird (Dundee) Ltd in 1832. The business was originally based in a 12 loom shed at Ashtown Works. The elder Caird was one of the first textile manufacturers to weave cloth composed of jute warp and weft. As the use of jute became increasingly popular, the Caird business expanded and thrived.

===Business career===
In 1870 James Caird succeeded his father as head of Caird (Dundee) Ltd. Under his leadership Ashton Works was re-built, expanded and equipped with the latest machinery. In 1905, the firm also took over Craigie Works, which had formerly supplied Caird with much of his yarn. Eventually the two works employed 2,000 hands. &quot;The Dundee Advertiser&quot; reported that Caird was a good employer who ran an efficient business which was also &quot;a model of comfort for the workers&quot;.

===Family===
In 1873, Caird married Sophy Gray (1843–82), sister-in-law of the painter John Everett Millais. Her mental health was poor and Caird appears to have been rather neglectful towards her. They had one daughter, Beatrix Ada (1874–1888). His wife died at the age of 38 in 1882, possibly as a result of her longstanding battle with anorexia. The couple&#x27;s daughter died in 1888 at the age of 14. After the death of his closest family, Caird increasingly devoted himself to philanthropic causes.

===Philanthropy and research funding===
James Caird made a substantial fortune from his business interests and reinvested much of it in his home city. He gave both the Caird Hall, which dominates City Square, and Caird Park in the north of city to the people of Dundee which also includes Mains Castle also known as Fintry Castle. The Marryat Hall, given by his sister Mrs Emma Grace Marryat, links to Caird Hall. In total, between 1895 and 1914 James Caird gave £240,940 in donations to various good causes institutions and organisations in Dundee and elsewhere. In 1902 Caird offered £18,500 to the directors of the Dundee Royal Infirmary so they could erect a hospital for the treatment of cancer. He also provided £1,000 a year for five years to fund research &quot;into the nature of this mysterious disease.&quot; The resulting facility opened in 1906 and admitted its first patients in January 1907. His father had earlier left a legacy to Dundee Royal Infirmary, among other good causes.

Caird was created a baronet on 8 February 1913.

Caird was noted for his interest in providing financial aid for scientific research. In 1913, he presented the Royal Society with a cheque for £5,000, which was to be used to fund physical research. Caird also offered University College, Dundee expansive plans for a Physics laboratory, but this offer was rejected by the College Council in 1905.

Caird helped to fund Sir Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s Antarctic expedition of 1914 to 1916 on &quot;Endurance&quot;. The largest of the ship&#x27;s boats, the &quot;James Caird&quot;, in which six of &quot;Endurance&quot; crew made their epic small-boat voyage of from Elephant Island to South Georgia, was named in appreciation of Caird&#x27;s contribution. Caird himself died two months prior to Shackleton&#x27;s arrival at Stromness, South Georgia. Thus, Caird died without ever learning of the successful rescue of &quot;Endurance&quot;&#x27;s personnel whom he helped financing.

Caird was awarded an honorary degree from the University of St. Andrews.

===Death===
Caird died at his Perthshire estate, Belmont Castle near Meigle, which he had purchased after the death of its previous owner Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. The baronetcy became extinct upon his death. He is buried with his father in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh just west of the central roundel, under a modest stone..

<text>The voyage of the &quot;James Caird&quot; was a journey of from Elephant Island in the South Shetland Islands through the Southern Ocean to South Georgia, undertaken by Sir Ernest Shackleton and five companions to obtain rescue for the main body of the stranded Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. Many historians regard the voyage of the crew in a ship&#x27;s boat through the &quot;Furious Fifties&quot; as the greatest small-boat journey ever completed.

In October 1915, pack ice in the Weddell Sea had sunk the main expedition ship &quot;Endurance&quot;, leaving Shackleton and his 27 companions adrift on a floe. They drifted northward until April 1916, when the floe on which they were camped broke up; they made their way in the ship&#x27;s boats to Elephant Island. Shackleton decided to sail one of the boats with a small crew to South Georgia to seek help. It was not the closest human settlement but the only one that did not require them to sail into the prevailing westerlies.

Of the three boats, the &quot;James Caird&quot; was deemed the most likely to survive the journey (Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird, a Dundee philanthropist whose sponsorship had helped finance the expedition). Before its voyage, the ship&#x27;s carpenter, Harry McNish, strengthened and adapted the boat to withstand the seas of the Southern Ocean, sealing his makeshift wood and canvas deck with lamp wick, oil paint and seal blood.
After surviving a series of dangers, including a near capsizing, the small crew and boat reached the southern coast of South Georgia after a 17-day voyage. Shackleton, Tom Crean and Frank Worsley crossed the island&#x27;s mountains to a whaling station on the north side. Here they organised the relief of the three men left on the south side of the island and of the larger Elephant Island party. Ultimately, the entire &quot;Endurance&quot; crew returned home, without loss of life. After the First World War, in 1919, the &quot;James Caird&quot; was moved from South Georgia to England. Since 1922 it has been on regular display at Shackleton&#x27;s alma mater, Dulwich College.

== Background ==

On 5 December 1914, Shackleton&#x27;s expedition traveled via the ship &quot;Endurance&quot; from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea, on the first stage of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. They were making for Vahsel Bay, the southernmost explored point of the Weddell Sea at 77° 49&#x27; S, where a shore party was to land and prepare for a transcontinental crossing of Antarctica. Before reaching its destination, the ship became trapped in pack ice, and by 14 February 1915 was held fast, despite prolonged efforts to free her. During the following eight months the crew stayed with the ship as she drifted northward in the ice until, on 27 October, she was crushed by the pack&#x27;s pressure, finally sinking on 21 November.

As his 27-man crew set up camp on the slowly moving ice, Shackleton&#x27;s focus shifted to how best to save his party. His first plan was to march across the ice to the nearest land, and try to reach a point that ships were known to visit. The march began, but progress was hampered by the nature of the ice&#x27;s surface, later described by Shackleton as &quot;soft, much broken up, open leads intersecting the floes at all angles&quot;.

After struggling to make headway over several days, they abandoned the march; the party established &quot;Patience Camp&quot; on a flat ice floe, and waited as the drift carried them further north, towards open water. They had managed to salvage the three boats, which Shackleton had named after the principal backers of the expedition: &quot;Stancomb-Wills&quot;, &quot;Dudley Docker&quot; and &quot;James Caird&quot;. The party waited until 8 April 1916, when they finally took to the boats as the ice started to break up. Over a perilous period of seven days they sailed and rowed through stormy seas and dangerous loose ice, to reach the temporary haven of Elephant Island on 15 April.

== Elephant Island ==
Elephant Island, on the eastern limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from anywhere that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes. No relief ship would search for them there, and the likelihood of rescue from any other outside agency was equally negligible. The island was bleak and inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh water, and a relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of the tents in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. The pressures and hardships of the previous months were beginning to tell on the men, many of whom were in a run-down state both mentally and physically.

In these conditions, Shackleton decided to try to reach help, using one of the boats. The nearest port was Stanley in the Falkland Islands, away, but was made unreachable by the prevailing westerly winds. A better option was to head for Deception Island, away at the western end of the South Shetland chain. Although it was uninhabited, Admiralty records indicated that this island held stores for shipwrecked mariners, and was also visited from time to time by whalers. However, reaching it would also involve a journey against the prevailing winds—though in less open seas—with ultimately no certainty when or if rescue would arrive. After discussions with the expedition&#x27;s second-in-command, Frank Wild, and ship&#x27;s captain Frank Worsley, Shackleton decided to attempt to reach the whaling stations of South Georgia, to the north-east. This would mean a longer boat journey of across the Southern Ocean, in conditions of rapidly approaching winter, but with the help of following winds it appeared feasible. Shackleton thought that &quot;a boat party might make the voyage and be back with relief within a month, provided that the sea was clear of ice, and the boat survive the great seas&quot;.

== Preparations ==
The South Georgia boat party could expect to meet hurricane-force winds and waves—the notorious Cape Horn Rollers—measuring from trough to crest as much as . Shackleton therefore selected the heaviest and strongest of the three boats, the long &quot;James Caird&quot;. It had been built as a whaleboat in London to Worsley&#x27;s orders, designed on the &quot;double-ended&quot; tradition. Knowing that a heavily laden open sea voyage was now unavoidable, Shackleton had already asked the expedition&#x27;s carpenter, Harry McNish to modify the boats during the weeks the expedition spent at Patience Camp. Using material taken from &quot;Endurance&#x27;s&quot; fourth boat, a small motor launch which had been broken up with this purpose in mind before the ship&#x27;s final loss, McNish had raised the sides of the &quot;James Caird&quot; and the &quot;Dudley Docker&quot; by 8–10 inches (20–25 cm). Now in the primitive camp on Elephant Island, McNish was again asked if he could make the &quot;James Caird&quot; more seaworthy. Using improvised tools and materials, McNish built a makeshift deck of wood and canvas, sealing his work with oil paints, lamp wick and seal blood. The craft was strengthened by having the mast of the &quot;Dudley Docker&quot; lashed inside, along the length of her keel. She was then fitted as a ketch, with her own mainmast and a mizzenmast made by cutting down the mainmast from the &quot;Stancomb-Wills&quot;, rigged to carry lug sails and a jib. The weight of the boat was increased by the addition of approximately 1 long ton (1 tonne) of ballast, to lessen the risk of capsizing in the high seas that Shackleton knew they would encounter. Worsley believed that too much extra ballast (formed from rocks, stones and shingle taken from the beach) was added, making the boat excessively heavy, giving an extremely uncomfortable &#x27;stiff&#x27; motion and hampering the performance for sailing upwind or into the weather. However, he acknowledged that Shackleton&#x27;s biggest concern was preventing the boat capsizing during the open-ocean crossing.

The boat was loaded with provisions to last six men one month; as Shackleton later wrote, &quot;if we did not make South Georgia in that time we were sure to go under&quot;. They took ration packs that had been intended for the transcontinental crossing, biscuits, Bovril, sugar and dried milk. They also took two 18-gallon (68-litre) casks of water (one of which was damaged during the loading and let in sea water), two Primus stoves, paraffin, oil, candles, sleeping bags and odd items of spare clothing.

Shackleton&#x27;s first choices for the boat&#x27;s crew were Worsley and Tom Crean, who had apparently &quot;begged to go&quot;. Crean was a shipmate from the Discovery Expedition, 1901–04, and had also been with Scott&#x27;s Terra Nova Expedition in 1910–13, where he had distinguished himself on the fatal polar march. Shackleton was confident that Crean would persevere to the bitter end, and had great faith in Worsley&#x27;s skills as a navigator, especially his ability to work out positions in difficult circumstances. Worsley later wrote: &quot;We knew it would be the hardest thing we had ever undertaken, for the Antarctic winter had set in, and we were about to cross one of the worst seas in the world&quot;.

For the remaining places Shackleton requested volunteers, and of the many who came forward he chose two strong sailors in John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy. He offered the final place to the carpenter, McNish. &quot;He was over fifty years of age&quot;, wrote Shackleton of McNish (he was in fact 41), &quot;but he had a good knowledge of sailing boats and was very quick&quot;. Vincent and McNish had each proved their worth during the difficult boat journey from the ice to Elephant Island. They were both somewhat awkward characters, and their selection may have reflected Shackleton&#x27;s wish to keep potential troublemakers under his personal charge rather than leaving them on the island where personal animosities could fester.

== Open-boat journey ==
Before leaving, Shackleton instructed Frank Wild that he was to assume full command as soon as the &quot;James Caird&quot; departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The &quot;James Caird&quot; was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, and the boat was quickly out of sight of the land.

Shackleton ordered Worsley to set a course due north, instead of directly for South Georgia, to get clear of the menacing ice-fields that were beginning to form. By midnight they had left the immediate ice behind, but the sea swell was rising. At dawn the next day, they were from Elephant Island, sailing in heavy seas and force 9 winds. Shackleton established an on-board routine: two three-man watches, with one man at the helm, another at the sails, and the third on bailing duty. The off-watch trio rested in the tiny covered space in the bows. The difficulties of exchanging places as each watch ended would, Shackleton wrote, &quot;have had its humorous side if it had not involved us in so many aches and pains&quot;. Their clothing was designed for Antarctic sledging rather than open-boat sailing. It was not waterproof, and contact with the icy seawater left their skins painfully raw.

Success depended on Worsley&#x27;s navigation, which was based on brief sightings of the sun as the boat pitched and rolled. The first observation was made after two days, and showed them to be north of Elephant Island. The course was changed to head directly for South Georgia. They were clear of floating ice but had reached the dangerous seas of the Drake Passage, where giant waves sweep round the globe, unimpeded by any land. The movement of the boat made preparing hot food on the Primus nearly impossible, but Crean, who acted as cook, somehow kept the men fed.

The next observation, on 29 April, showed that they had travelled . Thereafter, navigation became, in Worsley&#x27;s words, &quot;a merry jest of guesswork&quot;, as they encountered the worst of the weather. The &quot;James Caird&quot; was taking on water in heavy seas and in danger of sinking, kept afloat by continuous bailing. The temperature fell sharply, and a new danger presented itself in the accumulations of frozen spray, which threatened to capsize the boat. In turns, they had to crawl out on to the pitching deck with an axe and chip away the ice from deck and rigging. For 48 hours they were stopped, held by a sea anchor, until the wind dropped sufficiently for them to raise sail and proceed. Despite their travails, Worsley&#x27;s third observation, on 4 May, put them only from South Georgia.

On 5 May the worst of the weather returned, and brought them close to disaster in the largest seas so far. Shackleton later wrote: &quot;We felt our boat lifted and flung forward like a cork in breaking surf&quot;. The crew bailed frantically to keep afloat. Nevertheless, they were still moving towards their goal, and a dead reckoning calculation by Worsley on the next day, 6 May, suggested that they were now from the western point of South Georgia. The strains of the past two weeks were by now taking their toll on the men. Shackleton observed that Vincent had collapsed and ceased to be an active member of the crew, McCarthy was &quot;weak, but happy&quot;, McNish was weakening but still showing &quot;grit and spirit&quot;.
On 7 May Worsley advised Shackleton that he could not be sure of their position within ten miles. To avoid the possibility of being swept past the island by the fierce south-westerly winds, Shackleton ordered a slight change of course so that the &quot;James Caird&quot; would reach land on the uninhabited south-west coast. They would then try to work the boat round to the whaling stations on the northern side of the island. &quot;Things were bad for us in those days&quot;, wrote Shackleton. &quot;The bright moments were those when we each received our one mug of hot milk during the long, bitter watches of the night&quot;. Late on the same day floating seaweed was spotted, and the next morning there were birds, including cormorants which were known never to venture far from land. Shortly after noon on 8 May came the first sighting of South Georgia.

As they approached the high cliffs of the coastline, heavy seas made immediate landing impossible. For more than 24 hours they were forced to stand clear, as the wind shifted to the north-west and quickly developed into &quot;one of the worst hurricanes any of us had ever experienced&quot;. For much of this time they were in danger of being driven on to the rocky South Georgia shore, or of being wrecked on the equally menacing Annenkov Island, five miles from the coast. On 10 May, when the storm had eased slightly, Shackleton was concerned that the weaker members of his crew would not last another day, and decided that whatever the hazard they must attempt a landing. They headed for Cave Cove near the entrance to King Haakon Bay, and finally, after several attempts, made their landing there. Shackleton was later to describe the boat journey as &quot;one of supreme strife&quot;; historian Caroline Alexander comments: &quot;They could hardly have known—or cared—that in the carefully weighted judgement of authorities yet to come, the voyage of the &quot;James Caird&quot; would be ranked as one of the greatest boat journeys ever accomplished&quot;.

== South Georgia ==
As the party recuperated, Shackleton realised that the boat was not capable of making a further voyage to reach the whaling stations, and that Vincent and McNish were unfit to travel further. He decided to move the boat to a safer location within King Haakon Bay, from which point he, Worsley and Crean would cross the island on foot, aiming for the station at Stromness.

On 15 May the &quot;James Caird&quot; made a run of about to a shingle beach near the head of the bay. Here the boat was beached and up-turned to provide a shelter. The location was christened &quot;Peggotty Camp&quot; (after Peggotty&#x27;s boat-home in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;David Copperfield&quot;). Early on 18 May Shackleton, Worsley and Crean began what would be the first confirmed land crossing of the South Georgia interior. Since they had no map, they had to improvise a route across mountain ranges and glaciers. They travelled continuously for 36 hours, before reaching Stromness. Shackleton&#x27;s men were, in Worsley&#x27;s words, &quot;a terrible trio of scarecrows&quot;, dark with exposure, wind, frostbite and accumulated blubber soot. Later that evening, 19 May, a motor-vessel (the Norwegian whale catcher &quot;Samson&quot;) was despatched to King Haakon Bay to pick up McCarthy, McNish and Vincent, and the &quot;James Caird&quot;. Worsley wrote that the Norwegian seamen at Stromness all &quot;claimed the honour of helping to haul her up to the wharf&quot;, a gesture which he found &quot;quite affecting&quot;.

The advent of the southern winter and adverse ice conditions meant that it was more than three months before Shackleton was able to achieve the relief of the men at Elephant Island. His first attempt was with the British ship &quot;Southern Sky&quot;. Then the government of Uruguay loaned him a ship. While searching on the Falkland Islands he found the ship &quot;Emma&quot; for his third attempt, but the ship&#x27;s engine blew. Then, finally, with the aid of the steam-tug &quot;Yelcho&quot; commanded by Luis Pardo, the entire party was brought to safety, reaching Punta Arenas in Chile on 3 September 1916.

== Aftermath ==
The &quot;James Caird&quot; was returned to England in 1919. In 1921, Shackleton went back to Antarctica, leading the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition. On 5 January 1922, he died suddenly of a heart attack, while the expedition&#x27;s ship was moored at South Georgia.

Later that year John Quiller Rowett, who had financed this last expedition and was a former school friend of Shackleton&#x27;s from Dulwich College, South London, decided to present the &quot;James Caird&quot; to the college. It remained there until 1967, although its display building was severely damaged by bombs in 1944.

In 1967, thanks to a pupil at Dulwich College, Howard Hope, who was dismayed at the state of the boat, it was given to the care of the National Maritime Museum, and underwent restoration. It was then displayed by the museum until 1985, when it was returned to Dulwich College and placed in a new location in the North Cloister, on a bed of stones gathered from South Georgia and Aberystwyth. This site has become the &quot;James Caird&quot;″s permanent home, although the boat is sometimes lent to major exhibitions and has taken part in the London Boat Show and in events at Greenwich, Portsmouth, and Falmouth. It has travelled overseas to be exhibited in Washington, D.C., New York, Sydney, Australia, Wellington (Te Papa) New Zealand and Bonn, Germany.
The James Caird Society was established in 1994, to &quot;preserve the memory, honour the remarkable feats of discovery in the Antarctic, and commend the outstanding qualities of leadership associated with the name of Sir Ernest Shackleton&quot;.

In 2000, German polar explorer Arved Fuchs built a detailed copy of Shackleton&#x27;s boat—named &quot;James Caird II&quot;—for his replication of the voyage of Shackleton and his crew from Elephant Island to South Georgia. The &quot;James Caird II&quot; was among the first exhibitions when the International Maritime Museum in Hamburg was opened. A further replica, &quot;James Caird III&quot;, was built and purchased by the South Georgia Heritage Trust, and since 2008 has been on display at the South Georgia Museum at Grytviken.

==Replica==
In 2013, Australian explorer Tim Jarvis and five others successfully recreated Shackleton&#x27;s crossing of the Southern Ocean in the &quot;Alexandra Shackleton&quot;, a replica of the &quot;James Caird&quot;. The construction of the replica &quot;James Caird&quot; was started in June 2008 and was finished in 2010, and was officially launched on 18 March 2012 in Dorset. Using the same materials, clothing, food, and chronometer, Jarvis and the team sailed their replica &quot;James Caird&quot; from Elephant Island to South Georgia, just as Shackleton did in 1916.

<text>The New Zealand Service Rifle Association (NZSRA) is the national organising body for service rifle competition in New Zealand. NZSRA promotes service rifle shooting, sets rules for service rifle competition, holds annual national championships, and supports the ownership of service rifles.

==History==

People have been shooting military rifles at targets for at least 150 years. Much of this activity ended up as the strictly deliberate target shooting of the NRA. Those who wanted to shoot authentically configured military rifles at targets but with more action than NRA shooting initiated Service Rifle shooting. Several clubs round NZ were doing this in an uncoordinated way. In late 1997, the International Military Arms Society Inc, based in Auckland and Wellington Service Rifle Association formed the New Zealand Service Rifle Association Inc. A joint set of rules and matches was written and called the Service Match Code, now in its fourth edition. Currently the main clubs running exclusively Service Rifle matches are Wellington Service Rifle Association Inc (WSRA) and Auckland Service Rifle Association Inc (ASRA). Other clubs (BOPSRA, Waikato Rifle, Bruce Rifle Club, Canterbury group) also run SR matches as part of their overall programme.

==Service Match Code==

The Service Match Code (SMC v 4.0) sets out the rules for service rifle competition.

==Member clubs==

The following clubs are members of the NZSRA:

* Auckland Service Rifle Association (ASRA).
* Wellington Service Rifle Association (WSRA).
* Central North Island Gun Club Association (CNIGC).

==Memberships==

NZSRA is a member of the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (COLFO).

<text>The Mitsubishi J2M &quot;Raiden&quot; (雷電, &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;) is a single-engined, land-based fighter aircraft used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service in World War II. Its Allied reporting name was Jack.

==Design and development==
The J2M was designed by Jiro Horikoshi, creator of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, to meet the 14-&quot;Shi&quot; (14th year of the Showa reign, or 1939 in the Western calendar) official specification. It was to be a strictly local-defense interceptor, intended to counter the threat of high-altitude bomber raids, and thus relied on speed, climb performance, and armament at the expense of manoeuvrability. The J2M was a sleek, but stubby craft with its oversized Mitsubishi Kasei engine buried behind a long cowling, cooled by an intake fan and connected to the propeller with an extension shaft.

Teething development problems stemming from the engine cooling system, and the main undercarriage members led to a slowdown in production. A continual set of modifications resulted in new variants being introduced with the ultimate high-altitude variant, the J2M4 Model 34 flying for the first time in August 1944. It had a 1,420 hp Kasei 23c engine equipped with a turbocharger (mounted in the side of the fuselage just behind the engine) that allowed the rated power to be maintained up to . Two upward-aimed, oblique-firing (aimed at seventy degrees) 20 mm cannons, mounted in the German &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; style, were fitted behind the cockpit with the four wing cannons retained. Unresolved difficulties with the turbocharger caused the project to be terminated after only two experimental J2M4s were built.

==Operational history==
The first few produced J2M2s were delivered to the development units in December 1942 but severe problems were encountered with the engines. Trials and improvements took almost a year and the first batch of the serial built J2M2 Model 11 was delivered to 381st Kōkūtai in December 1943. Parallel with the J2M2, production of the J2M3 &quot;Raiden&quot; Model 21 started. The first J2M3s appeared in October 1943 but deliveries to combat units started at the beginning of February 1944.

The &quot;Raiden&quot; made its combat debut in June 1944 during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Several J2Ms operated from Guam and Saipan, and a small number of aircraft were deployed to the Philippines. Later, some J2Ms were based in Japanese airfields in Korea under Genzan Ku: Genzan (Wonsan); Ranan (Nanam); Funei (Nuren); Rashin (Najin); and Konan, for defense of these areas and fighting against Soviet Naval Aviation units.

Primarily designed to defend against the Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bomber, the type was handicapped at high altitude by the lack of a turbocharger. However, its four-cannon armament supplied effective firepower, and the use of dive and zoom tactics allowed it to score occasionally.

Insufficient numbers and the American switch to night bombing in March 1945 limited its effectiveness.

J2Ms took part in one of the final aerial combats of the Second World War when four &quot;Raiden&quot;s, accompanied by eight Mitsubishi A6M Zeros, all belonging to the 302nd &quot;Kokutai,&quot; intercepted a formation of US Navy Grumman F6F Hellcats from the aircraft-carrier USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; during the morning of 15 August 1945 over the Kanto Plain. In the engagement, that took place only two hours before Japan officially announced its surrender, four Hellcats were lost along with two &quot;Raiden&quot;s and two Zeros.

U.S. Technical Air Intelligence Command (TAIC) tested two captured J2Ms using 92 octane fuel plus methanol and calculated maximum speeds using measurements. The J2M2 (&quot;Jack 11&quot;) achieved a speed of at , and the J2M3 (&quot;Jack 21&quot;) achieved a speed of at .

==Variants==
* J2M1 Prototype: fitted with the 1,044 kW (1,400 hp) Mitsubishi MK4C Kasei 13 14-cylinder air-cooled radial engine, and armed with two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 97 machine guns in the upper fuselage and two wing-mounted 20 mm Type 99 Model II cannon. - Eight built.
* J2M2 Model 11: Powered by 1,379 kW (1,850 hp) Mitsubishi MK4R-A Kasei 23a 14-cylinder radial engine, same armament as the J2M1.
* J2M3 Model 21: Armed with two wing-mounted 20 mm Type 99 Model II cannon and two wing-mounted 20 mm Type 99 Model I cannon.
* J2M3a Model 21A: Armed with four wing-mounted 20 mm Type 99 Model II cannon.
* J2M4 Model 32: Prototype fitted with the 1,357 kW (1,820 hp) Mitsubishi MK4R-C Kasei 23c engine. Many armament configurations have been reported, e.g., fuselage-mounted oblique-firing 20 mm Type 99 Model I cannon designed to fire upward as it passed underneath a bomber, two wing-mounted 20 mm Type 99 Model II cannon, and two wing-mounted 20 mm Type 99 Model I cannon. Problems with turbocharger; only two experimental versions were built.
* J2M5 Model 33: High altitude variant powered by 1,357 kW (1,820 hp) Mitsubishi MK4U-A Kasei 26a engine with mechanically driven supercharger, giving increased high-altitude speed at the expense of range. Two 20 mm Type 99 cannon in fuselage, two 20 mm Type 99 Model II cannon in wings.
* J2M5a Model 33A: Armed with four wing-mounted 20 mm Type 99 Model II cannon. Wing cannon were harmonized in trajectory and ballistics with each having 200 rounds per gun.
* J2M6 Model 31: Chronologically earlier than J2M4 and J2M5 this version was based on J2M3. Had wider cockpit and improved bubble canopy later used in J2M3 built since July 1943.
* J2M6a Model 31A: Chronologically earlier than J2M4 and J2M5 this version was based on J2M3a. &lt;br&gt;Had wider cockpit and improved bubble canopy later used in J2M3a built since July 1943. One J2M6a was built.
* J2M7 Model 23A: J2M3 powered by Kasei 26a engine, a few built.
* J2M7a Model 23A: J2M3a powered by Kasei 26a engine, a few built.

===Production===
After the decisive Battle of Midway in 1942, Japan&#x27;s military leaders rushed to re-equip their forces for defense of the home islands. In fighter designs, the interceptor role now took priority over forward projection of offensive power. Allied forces, meanwhile, sought to establish air superiority over Japanese-held territories via B-29 bombing raids on industrial targets.

The struggle to meet production demands sparked a Japanese initiative to recruit &quot;shonenko&quot; (child labour) from Taiwan (Formosa). Though the target of 25,000 youths was never reached, over 8,400 Taiwanese youths aged 12 to 14 relocated to Mitsubishi plants to help build the J2M &quot;Raiden&quot;.

The Allied advance took its toll. In 1945, aircraft production in Japan collapsed, as numbers for the J2M reflect.

Allied bombing raids of Nagoya began in December 1944 and progressively disrupted production of the J2M. A direct hit on the Mitsubishi &quot;Dai San Kokuki Seisakusho&quot; aircraft plant caused the complete loss of airframes, machine tools, and jigs. This halted further production.

Production generally suffered less from direct hits on factories, which were rare, but from attacks on suppliers and consequent shortages of material and construction tools.

==Operators==
* Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service

==Surviving aircraft==
J2M3 Model 21 c/n 3014 is on display at the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California. It was brought from Japan in 1945 for technical evaluation by the US Navy. Later declared surplus, it was displayed at the Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park, Los Angeles before it was acquired in 1958 by Planes of Fame founder Edward T. Maloney.

<text>Tetiaroa (French: &quot;Tetiaroa&quot;) is an atoll in the Windward group of the Society Islands of French Polynesia, an overseas territorial collectivity of France in the Pacific Ocean. Once the vacation spot for Tahitian royalty, the islets are under a 99-year lease contracted by Marlon Brando, and are home to The Brando Resort.

==Geography==

Tetiaroa is administratively part of the commune of Arue, whose main part is in the northeastern part of Tahiti. The atoll is located north of Tahiti. The atoll has a total surface area of ; approximately of sand divided by 12 motus (islets) with varying surface areas. The lagoon is approximately wide and deep. The atoll has no reef opening, making access by boat nearly impossible.

The islets (or motus), in clockwise order starting from the southwest corner, include: Onetahi (with regulated airstrip and site of The Brando Resort), Honuea, Tiaruanu, Motu Tauvini (Tauini), Motu Ahurea (Auroa), Hiraanae, Horoatera (Oroatera), Motu &#x27;Ā&#x27;ie, Tahuna Iti, Tahuna Rahi, Reiono, Motu One (emerging sandbank) and Rimatu&#x27;u (with an ornithology reserve).

===Climate===
Tetiaroa has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen &quot;Af&quot;), slightly above a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;). The average annual temperature in Tetiaroa is . The average annual rainfall is with December as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in March, at around , and lowest in August, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Tetiaroa was on 20 March 1995; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 25 July 1987.
==History==
===Early years===
The atoll of Tetiaroa was a special place for the Tahitian chiefs, as a place to entertain themselves with song, dance, fishing and feasting. It was also a special place for the &quot;ariori&quot; to practice their custom of &quot;haaporia&quot;. This custom included eating to gain weight, and staying out of the sun to whiten their skin. Plump and pale was a sign of &quot;well-being and prosperity&quot; for the &quot;ariori&quot; and chiefs. Tetiaroa was controlled by the chiefs of Pare-&#x27;Arue, and later, by members of the Pōmare Dynasty.

In 1789, William Bligh is said to have been the first European to visit the atoll while looking for early mutineers prior to the departure of which eventually suffered a full mutiny. The United States Exploring Expedition visited the island on 10 September 1839.

===Williams and Brando===
In 1904, the royal family sold Tetiaroa to Johnston Walter Williams, a Canadian national and the only dentist in Tahiti. Williams later became Consul of the United Kingdom from 1916 to 1935. Williams managed Tetiaroa as a residence and a copra plantation.

In 1960, Marlon Brando &quot;discovered&quot; Tetiaroa while scouting filming locations for &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, which was shot on Tahiti and neighbouring Mo&#x27;orea. After filming was completed, Brando hired a local fisherman to ferry him to Tetiaroa. It was &quot;more gorgeous than anything I had anticipated,&quot; he marveled in his 1994 autobiography &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me.&quot; Brando eventually purchased Tetiaroa&#x27;s islets (motus) from one of Williams&#x27;s direct descendants, Mrs. (Madame) Duran. Williams and his wife are buried on Motu Rimatuu. Brando decided on the purchase in 1966, having to endure political interference and local resistance to secure the atoll, reef and lagoon, all of which is now the property of French Polynesia. Many important archaeological sites have been located, identified, and studied on Tetiaroa. Thus, the historical significance of Tetiaroa to the people (and the government) of French Polynesia continues to make future development questionable at best.

Wanting to live on the atoll, Brando built a small village on Motu Onetahi in 1970. It consisted of an airstrip to arrive without breaching the reef, 12 simple bungalows, a kitchen hut, dining hall and bar, all built from local materials: coconut wood, thatch roofs and even large sea shells for sinks. The village became a place for friends, family and researchers studying the atoll&#x27;s ecology and archaeology. Over the years, Brando spent as much time on the atoll as he could, and valued it as a getaway from his hectic life in Hollywood. Although, ultimately, he didn&#x27;t spend as much time there as he&#x27;d wished to, it is said that he always cherished his moments on Tetiaroa. During his stays on the island, he was often visited by his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Upon his death, Brando&#x27;s son Teihotu lived on the island for some time. Eventually the village became a modest hotel managed by his Tahitian wife, Tarita Teriipaia, who had played his on-screen love in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;. The hotel operated for more than 25 years, even after Brando had to leave French Polynesia to return to Los Angeles. Many hotel guests, arriving with higher expectations, lamented the lack of amenities normally found at an island &quot;resort&quot;.

In 1980, the maxi yacht SY ran aground on the Onetahi reef, which caused it to be shipwrecked and written off by insurers. Purportedly, Brando and the owner of the yacht engaged in a brief bidding-war over rights to the vessel&#x27;s polished mahogany hull (as reported by the owner in the New Zealand yachting magazine &quot;Sail&quot;, in 1981), which Brando (allegedly) wanted to use as a bar at a new resort he planned to build on the island. The yacht was salvaged, and sent to New Zealand for repair. In 2002, two years before the actor&#x27;s death, Brando signed a new will and trust agreement that left no instructions for Tetiaroa. Following his death in 2004, the TetiAroa Village Hotel was closed and the staff was evicted from the atoll. The atoll was closed to tourism. In August 2004, French Polynesian vice-president Hiro Tefaarerea advocated for the atoll to be declared a nature reserve to prevent development. Eventually, executors of the estate granted development rights to Pacific Beachcomber SC, a Tahitian company that owns hotels throughout French Polynesia. The Brando Resort was opened in July 2014.

==Flora and fauna==
The island provides habitat for the following seabird species: Brown booby, red-footed booby, great crested tern, white tern, great frigatebird, lesser frigatebird, brown noddy, black noddy, sooty tern, and the grey-backed or spectacled tern. Shore and terrestrial birds include the Pacific reef egret, Pacific golden plover, wandering tattler, Pacific long-tailed cuckoo, and the bristle-thighed curlew.

Tetiaroa hosts five of the seven marine species of turtle, namely the Hawksbill turtle, green turtle, leatherback turtle, olive Ridley turtle, and loggerhead turtle.

Tetiaroa hosts numerous marine mammals, including the humpback whale, short-finned pilot whale, rough-toothed dolphin, spinner dolphin, Risso&#x27;s dolphin, melon-headed whale, Blainville&#x27;s beaked whale, Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale, and even some migrating pods of orca.

Numerous bony fishes, sharks, and rays are also present.

Plants include the fish-poison tree, Pacific ironwood, Alexandrian laurel, coconut palm, island walnut, dye fig, beach gardenia, beach heliotrope, lantern tree, breadfruit, lime tree, sea lettuce, and vanilla orchids, amongst others.

==Conservation and restoration==

The presence of two invasive rat species significantly impacted the native vegetation, nesting seabird populations, sea turtle hatchlings, and land crabs. The Tetiaroa Society, Island Conservation, and the Brando Resort (among other partners) initiated an invasive rat-eradication project in the summer of 2022. After repeated pandemic-related disruptions, the operation took place over June and July 2022, covering 520 hectares of land and requiring more than 60 members of staff, plus volunteers. The hope is that this project will restore the terrestrial ecosystems, protect endangered native birds and turtles, and enhance the resilience of surrounding coral reefs, making them more resistant to climate change. Additional benefits may be ensuring food security for the local population, as well as eliminating reservoirs and vectors for human disease. In time, the atoll could become a translocation habitat for the Polynesian ground dove and the Tuamotu sandpiper. The next phase of the restoration program will be extensive research and monitoring, to record the subsequent benefits to the terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

==Airport==

Tetiaroa Airport is an airport on the atoll. The airport is served by Air Tetiaroa, a charter airline who primarily operate flights for guests of the Brando Resort to Faa&#x27;a International Airport. The airport currently has no scheduled commercial service.

Beckerman was born in Crofton, Maryland. His parents are Margaret &quot;Meg&quot; (née Lamade) Beckerman, a third grade teacher, and Paul Beckerman, a science teacher. His brother Todd is four years his senior and coaches the wrestling team at Brown University.

== Personal life ==
On January 4, 2014, he married Kate Pappas, a Greek American account supervisor at Love Communications, at the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Salt Lake City.

Beckerman is known for his distinctive dreadlocks, which he started growing around 2005. In November 2017 Beckerman shaved off the majority of his hair in preparation for a new physical.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Beckerman began his career in various youth leagues in the Bowie, Maryland area. He played for the United States in the 1999 Under-17 World Cup in New Zealand. He attended DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland as a freshman, where he won a state wrestling title. He later transferred to and graduated from Arundel High School, and he signed a Nike Project-40 contract with MLS on June 27, 2000. Beckerman had been involved with the league for the previous few years, having been one of the inaugural students at the United States Soccer Federation&#x27;s Bradenton Academy, which also featured Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley, Oguchi Onyewu, and Bobby Convey.

===Miami Fusion===
Two days after he signed with the league, Miami Fusion claimed Beckerman. Beckerman hardly played in his first two years; he registered only 110 minutes in his first year and only 14 in his second after breaking his leg playing in the A-League. He went on loan with MLS Project 40 in 2000.

===Colorado Rapids===
After the Fusion were contracted at the end of the 2001 season, Beckerman was selected 11th overall in the 2002 MLS Dispersal Draft by the Colorado Rapids. In his first year with the Rapids, Beckerman again saw limited time, playing 477 minutes and registering one assist. In his second season, he finally broke through, starting 24 games, playing 2124 minutes, and registering five assists as a central midfielder. Beckerman performed at the same level in 2004, starting consistently. Beckerman remained a regular starter through the 2005 and 2006 seasons, playing an increasingly important role for the Rapids. He finished the 2006 season with seven goals and four assists, making him one of Colorado&#x27;s top offensive players that year.

===Real Salt Lake===
On July 16, 2007, Beckerman was traded to Real Salt Lake for Mehdi Ballouchy. Despite joining the team mid-season, he quickly established himself as a team leader for RSL. He took over the captain&#x27;s armband early in the 2008 season. He started all 38 matches for Salt Lake that year, helping the team reach the Western Conference Final (the club&#x27;s first-ever playoff appearance). Also in 2008, he was named to the MLS All-Star Inactive List for the second consecutive season.

Beckerman continued as RSL&#x27;s team captain throughout the 2009 season. During the year, he became the youngest player in MLS history to appear in 200 games. At mid-season, MLS Commissioner Don Garber added Beckerman and teammate Javier Morales to the roster for the 2009 MLS All-Star Game played July 29 at RSL&#x27;s Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah. RSL struggled through an up-and-down regular season, finishing with a losing record (11–12–7) and barely qualifying for postseason play. But with Beckerman leading the way, the team completed a stunning sweep through the playoffs, capped with a shootout victory over Los Angeles Galaxy in the 2009 MLS Cup championship.

On October 17, 2015, Beckerman broke the record for all-time MLS regular season appearances by a field player, at 379.

Beckerman was named on December 9, 2020, to The 25 Greatest by Major League Soccer as part of the circuit&#x27;s 25th season celebration. He announced his retirement as an active player twelve days later on December 21.

==International career==
Beckerman represented the United States on multiple levels of competition. He made his first international appearance in 1997 as a member of the U16 national team in a match against France. He made 40 appearances for the U17 national team, starting 36 times and scoring 15 goals. He started all six games in the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship in New Zealand, helping the U.S. to a fourth-place finish in the tournament. He also played for the U23 national team in the 2004 Pre-Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Mexico.

Beckerman&#x27;s first appearance for the senior national team came January 20, 2007 in a friendly match against Denmark. He was named to the U.S. roster for the 2007 Copa América in Venezuela, where he earned two caps: he entered as a reserve against Argentina, then played the full 90 minutes against Colombia. In July 2009, he was named to the U.S. roster for the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He started all six matches for the United States, helping his team to a second-place finish in the tournament. On July 18, 2009, he scored his first international goal in the quarterfinal match against Panama. On August 27, 2009, Beckerman was named to the national team roster for two World Cup qualifier matches: against El Salvador (September 5) and Trinidad &amp; Tobago (September 9). He entered the match against El Salvador as a second-half substitute.

In August 2011, Beckerman re-joined the U.S. at the invitation of new coach Jürgen Klinsmann. He played all 90 minutes in a friendly match against Mexico (a 1–1 draw) on August 10, and was a halftime substitute in a 1–0 friendly loss against Belgium on September 6. Since that time, Beckerman has been a regular on the national team.

Throughout July 2013, Beckerman was called up for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup alongside Real Salt Lake teammates Nick Rimando and Tony Beltran. Both Beckerman and Rimando started in five out of six games while Beltran started in only one match in home stadium Rio Tinto Stadium, where the trio played a full 90 minutes in front of their home crowd. Beckerman made three assists throughout the tournament until making to the final. On July 28, 2013, Beckerman played a full 90 minutes with Rimando to help secure the United States&#x27; 5th Gold Cup championship against Panama in a 1–0 victory. It was his first Gold Cup title as well as Rimando&#x27;s and Beltran&#x27;s. He was also named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

On May 22, 2014, Beckerman was named to the final 23-man roster for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. The tournament was his first-ever World Cup appearance. He started as defensive midfielder in all three matches of the group stage, as the U.S. advanced out of the &quot;Group of Death&quot;. Klinsmann elected to sit Beckerman in the Round of 16 match against Belgium; the Americans subsequently allowed 18 shots on goal in a 2–1 loss, which eliminated them from the World Cup.

==Coaching career==
On April 12, 2021, Beckerman was named head coach of the Utah Valley Wolverines men&#x27;s soccer team.

<text>The Advocate is a local newspaper of North-West and Western Tasmania, Australia. It was formerly published under the names The Wellington Times, The Emu Bay Times, and The North Western Advocate and the Emu Bay Times.

Its readership covers the North West Coast and West Coast of Tasmania, including towns such as Devonport, Burnie, Ulverstone, Penguin, Wynyard, Latrobe, and Smithton.

 the newspaper is published by Australian Community Media, located at 39-41 Alexander Street, Burnie, Tasmania.

== Early history ==
On Wednesday 1 October 1890 Robert Harris and his sons, Robert and Charles published the first issue of &quot;The Wellington Times&quot;, Burnie&#x27;s first newspaper. It was named after the county in which Burnie and Emu Bay were located and was first published only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. With a circulation around 2000 its four broadsheet pages cost 1.5 d.

The original &quot;Burnie Wellington Times&quot; office in 1890 stood on a site in Cattley Street and employed a staff of 10. In 1892 &quot;The Wellington Times&quot; was made a tri-weekly, appearing on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and on 2 November 1897, the name was changed to &quot;The Emu Bay Times&quot; reflecting the area in which it was published. The success of the newspaper encouraged the proprietors to extend operations to Devonport and on 4 January 1899 the tri-weekly &quot;The North Western Advocate and Agricultural and Mining Gazette&quot; was produced.

The separate publication of the two newspapers lasted only 11 months by which time the Government Railway had reached Burnie and on 13 November 1899 the two publications amalgamated to become a daily newspaper, &quot;The North Western Advocate and the Emu Bay Times&quot;. In 1902, new premises had been erected in Mount Street, at the present (2010) site and the staff had increased to 26. In the last decade of the 19th century, the North-West and West Coast were served by a number of daily publications - but by 1920 &quot;The Advocate&quot; was the sole survivor. The title was shortened to &quot;The Advocate&quot; in 1916.

In the 1950s &quot;The Advocate&quot; was one of the first daily newspapers in Australia to use colour in advertisements and in 1968 it was the first daily newspaper in Australia to publish on a Web-Offset press which today is the industry standard. Over the three years from 1993 to 1996, &quot;The Advocate&quot; embarked on a technology development programme that resulted in computer based full-page negative output on 1 October 1996.

== Later developments ==
In 2004, &quot;The Advocate&quot; became the third largest regional daily of Rural Press thereby ending the involvement of the Harris family for the first time since inception. In 2008, Rural Press became part of Fairfax Media, Australia&#x27;s largest integrated metropolitan, regional and rural print, online and digital media business in Australasia with The Advocate the only daily newspaper covering all areas of North West and Western Tasmania.

In 2009 all printing was centralised in Launceston, at a print facility run by &quot;The Examiner&quot;, a former rival publication that was owned by Fairfax Media, the then-owner of &quot;The Advocate&quot;. The press was dismantled and shipped off to a newspaper in New Zealand, where it was deployed at another newspaper owned by the Fairfax Media group.

The Advocate anniversary and celebratory editions regularly draw on the historical photographs of the newspaper.

Nine Entertainment briefly owned the newspaper after its $4-billion merger with Fairfax Media in July 2018. However, that changed when &quot;The Advocate&quot; along with 160 regional mastheads owned by Fairfax were purchased by media entrepreneur Anthony Catalano for $115 million, who owns Australian Community Media.

== Ownership and leadership ==
 the newspaper is published by Australian Community Media and located at 39-41 Alexander Street
Burnie.

Anthony Haneveer was appointed editor in March 2022 following the departure of Luke Sayer. Haneveer previously served as the paper&#x27;s deputy for four years. He replaced Luke Sayer, who was appointed editor in 2017.

== Notable staff ==

* Kerry Pink OAM, a journalist of more than 40 years and local historian, author of &quot;And Wealth for Toil: A History of North-West and Western Tasmania 1825-1900&quot; and other books.

<text>Gilberto Flores (born July 5, 1983 in Toledo, Brazil) is a Brazilian former soccer midfielder.

==MetroStars==

Gilberto Flores was signed by the MetroStars on April 1, 2004, from Brazilian club &quot;Ginásio Pinhalense de Esportes Atléticos&quot; after impressing in the 2004 La Manga Cup, ultimately helping the MetroStars win the tournament. He made his MetroStars MLS debut, and first start, in a 3-1 loss to the San Jose Earthquakes June 12, 2004, playing 67 minutes for the club. He struggled to see playing time in his time with the MetroStars. On June 26, 2004, he suffered a ruptured ankle tendon in a 2-1 loss to the New England Revolution, causing him to miss three months of playing time and requiring surgery. He also faced the task of breaking into a very talented MetroStars midfield, which saw him competing for time with Michael Bradley and Ricardo Clark. After being unable to regain his form following the injury, he was released by the MetroStars in June 2005.

==New England Revolution==

On July 9, 2005, Flores was picked up by the same New England Revolution team that he suffered his injury against. Flores made one total appearance for the Revolution, in the 2005 U.S. Open Cup fourth round against the Chicago Fire on August 3, 2005. He was released by New England on November 16, 2005.

==Later career==

Gilberto went on to play for Juventude, Paranavai, and was last with Coritiba.

<doc id="1049037" wikidata="Q2378963" url="?curid=1049037" title="Tony Hawk's Underground 2">
<text>Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2 is a 2004 skateboarding video game from Activision, the sixth entry in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series after &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot; (2003). It was developed by Neversoft released on October 4, 2004 in the U.S. for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Advance platforms. Mobile phone versions for BREW and J2ME devices was also released, as well as a PlayStation Portable version the following year subtitled &quot;Remix&quot;, which includes extra levels and characters.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot; received generally positive reviews, with praise for its gameplay, aesthetics and classic mode, but criticism for its story and lack of innovation.

== Gameplay ==

The gameplay in &quot;Underground 2&quot; is similar to that of previous Tony Hawk games: the player skates around in a 3D environment modeled after various cities and attempts to complete various goals. Most goals involve skating on or over various objects or performing combos. Scores are calculated by adding the sum of the point value of each trick strung together in a combo and then multiplying by the number of tricks in the combo. New gameplay features include the Focus ability, which the player may trigger with a full Special gauge to cause time to slow down in order to help keep up their combo (by allowing greater control of their grind balance, for example); the Natas Spin, which can be performed on small surfaces like pillars or fire hydrants; and the Freak Out, which serves as another combo starter by having the player fill a gauge after certain bails, which will result in them angrily disposing of their board before continuing their session. In addition, the Wallplant maneuver was repurposed as the Sticker Slap.

Many levels return from previous games, including an expanded Warehouse (which also serves as the Story Mode&#x27;s training area), School and Downhill Jam from &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot;, Canada, Los Angeles and Airport from &quot;Pro Skater 3&quot;, and Philadelphia from &quot;Pro Skater 2&quot;.

A classic mode was added to &quot;Underground 2&quot;, which allows players to skate through both new and remade classic levels in the traditional 10-goal, two-minute time limit mode that was present in &quot;Pro Skater&quot;, &quot;Pro Skater 2&quot; and &quot;Pro Skater 3&quot;, complete with the stat points scattered all around the levels. In classic mode, the player chooses from one or two levels in which to attempt to complete enough goals to advance. All of the &quot;remade&quot; levels are accessible only through &quot;Classic Mode&quot; although once unlocked, it is possible to play them in any mode except Story.

== Plot ==
The protagonist of the first &quot;Underground&quot; is skating in their neighborhood hometown of New Jersey when Tony Hawk and Bam Margera kidnap them and take them to a dark room with pro skaters Bob Burnquist, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Mike Vallely, Chad Muska, Wee-Man, Paulie &quot;Wheels of Fury&quot; Ryan (a foul-mouthed kid who wears a body cast and drives a high-powered wheelchair) and Eric Sparrow (the protagonist&#x27;s former friend-turned-rival from the first Underground game). Tony and Bam explain their plans for their debut &quot;World Destruction Tour&quot;, a worldwide, publicity-free skateboarding tour where two teams (Team Hawk and Team Bam) compete for points; the losing team has to pay for all the expenses. The player joins Team Hawk—Tony, Burnquist, Mullen, Vallely, and Muska—against Team Bam—Bam, Koston, Wee-Man, Ryan, Sparrow, and Phil Margera (team captain and Bam&#x27;s father).

In Boston, the first leg of the tour, Team Bam manages to win at the last minute, thanks to one of Paulie&#x27;s stunts. As a result, Burnquist is eliminated via having a tennis ball shot at his genitals. Later on, in Barcelona, Team Hawk manages to take the lead again, but the punishment for Team Bam is to have the player swap teams (in this case, Sparrow moves from Team Bam to Team Hawk and the player doing the opposite), much to Bam&#x27;s relief and Tony&#x27;s annoyance. At that time though, word has spread out about the World Destruction Tour, which was supposed to be a low-profile event but now is appearing on TV news because of a video of Bam and Koston letting a bull trash Phil&#x27;s room.

The player and Sparrow swap back after Berlin. At that moment, an underground film &quot;writer, producer, director&quot; by the name of Nigel Beaverhausen wishes to bring the tour to the public but instead winds up being humiliated by Tony and Bam. After causing chaos in Bangkok (the skaters were en route to Australia, though Muska suggested stopping in Thailand), the tour lands in Australia. At the end of the leg, the player is supposed to be eliminated by being stripped down to their underwear and hit by mousetraps launched at them, but due to Mullen spotting a mathematical error in Team Hawk&#x27;s points, the player has to compete with Sparrow—the loser will be eliminated from the tour.

The group ponders what to do when a skater kid arrives and shows them a video of the tour, created by Beaverhausen. Tony decides that whoever humiliates Beaverhausen will stay on the tour. Sparrow manages to steal his clothes but the player, with Nigel&#x27;s clothes, goes off causing a rampage on Australian citizens, framing Beaverhausen; Sparrow is eliminated as a result.

At the end of the New Orleans leg, Nigel reveals that he filmed the whole tour, even before he met Tony and Bam in Berlin. Nigel proposes that if he is allowed to film the whole tour, he will pay for all the damages of the tour, which Tony and Bam accept after seeing the long damage bill (which stands at $21,117,551.84). Team Hawk performs a death-defying stunt called the &quot;Equalizer&quot; to tie up with Team Bam and is successful, but team members Vallely, Muska, and Mullen are arrested by the cops for stealing the helicopter used for the stunt, leaving the player and Tony for the final leg of the Tour: Skatopia, defined by Tony as &quot;the skateboarding Mecca&quot;.

Team Hawk, though reduced to two members, performs well enough to win. Confident on his victory, Bam decides to blow up Skatopia. In order to save people from the imminent damage, Tony evacuates the skaters and animals. Bam dares the player, who is still stuck in the back end of Skatopia, to exit the flaming park in a combo, which he considers impossible. The player takes the dare and secures the World Destruction Tour win for Team Hawk. Nigel wants Bam to give him the tape of the tour, which shows Phil in the toilet, shouting to his wife for more toilet paper. The tour ends with Bam and Tony humiliating Nigel once more, as Bam pulls down his pants on international TV.

During the credits, it is revealed that Tony and Bam have been officially banned from returning to all locations on the tour (even Thailand). Upon hearing the news, they reply, &quot;Hey, good call&quot;.

== Development ==

A sequel to &quot;Underground&quot; was announced in January 2004. During development, developer Neversoft sent its members to locations featured in-game in order to get more acquainted with the areas.

== Reception ==

The game received generally positive reviews from critics, with GameRankings scores ranging from 70% to 86% and Metacritic scores from 70% to 85%. It was nominated to be part of the Smithsonian&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Video Games&quot; display for the PlayStation 2 section under the Action genre, but lost to &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot;. It received runner-up positions in &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2004 &quot;Best Alternative Sports Game&quot; and &quot;Best Licensed Music&quot; award categories across all platforms.

The plot received mixed comments. Douglass C. Perry of IGN found the plot to be less &quot;endearing&quot; than &quot;Underground&quot;″s, and while he enjoyed the story mode&#x27;s gameplay, other staff at IGN did not, opting instead for the Classic mode. A reviewer from GameSpot enjoyed the story mode, but felt it was too short. In contrast, Tom Bramwell from Eurogamer felt there were plenty of levels, and saw the plot as enjoyable and unintrusive, if unintelligent. Ben Silverman of Game Revolution also thought the campaign was noticeably short, but also that &quot;that&#x27;s actually a blessing, though, because the plot and cut-scenes are pretty lame&quot;. Perry enjoyed the level design, but noted some slowdown in the levels due to their size.

Some critics noted that the gameplay had not been significantly upgraded from &quot;Underground&quot;. Silverman and Perry were unimpressed with the short selection of moves introduced in &quot;Underground 2&quot;. GameSpot agreed, but concluded that &quot;while not all of these changes are all that great, the core gameplay in &quot;THUG2&quot; is still very strong&quot;. In contrast, Bramwell felt that the Sticker Slap and additional flip and grab tricks were meaningful, enjoyable additions. The addition of Classic mode was praised by 1UP.com, who considered it superior to the story mode in terms of levels, while adding &quot;the gamers weaned on PS1 Hawks will shed a tear, while newer fans will get a lesson on how things started&quot;.

The aesthetics were generally well-received. Perry praised the aesthetics, which he described as more cartoony, especially in the pro skater models, than those of previous &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; games. Regarding the sound, he praised both the sound effects and the music. Silverman particularly commended the soundtrack&#x27;s variety for including songs outside the traditional skating genres of punk, rock, and hip hop (namely Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; and Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;). Conversely, Bramwell greatly disliked the soundtrack, although he admitted it suited its purpose of accompanying skateboarding and also found the graphical upgrades to be minor and noted frequent issues with slowdown.

During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot; with &quot;Console Action Sports Game of the Year&quot;, along with a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack&quot;.

== &quot;THUG Pro&quot; ==

&quot;THUG Pro&quot; (&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground: Pro&quot;) is a community-made mod of &quot;Underground 2&quot;. The mod&#x27;s concept is to use &quot;Underground 2&quot;″s game mechanics in every level from every Neversoft game in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series for use in single-player and online multiplayer gameplay. The mod is in beta status, under current development, and has been continuously updated since its initial beta release in 2013.

<doc id="1049063" wikidata="Q2915175" url="?curid=1049063" title="Tekle Haymanot">
<text>Abune Tekle Haymanot (Ge&#x27;ez: አቡነ ተክለ ሃይማኖት; known in the Coptic Church as Saint Takla Haymanot of Ethiopia; 1215–1313) was an Ethiopian saint and monk mostly venerated as a hermit. He was the Abuna of Ethiopia who founded a major monastery in his native province of Shewa. He is significant for being the only Ethiopian saint popular both amongst Ethiopians and outside that country. Tekle Haymanot &quot;is the only Ethiopian saint celebrated officially in foreign churches such as Rome and Egypt.&quot; His feast day is 30 August (Nehasə 24 in Ethiopian calendar), and the 24th day of every month in the Ethiopian calendar is dedicated to Tekle Haymanot.

== Early life ==
Tekle Haymanot was born in Zorare, a district in Selale which lies on the eastern edge of Shewa. He was the son of the priest Tsega Zeab (ጸጋ ዘአብ) (&quot;Grace of God&quot;) and his wife Egzi&#x27;e Haraya (&quot;Choice of God&quot;), who is also known as Sarah; Tekle Haymanot was born after his parents, who had failed to have children, pledged their firstborn to God. Tekle Haymanot was ethnically Amhara, and his 13th-14th century hagiography traces Bete Amhara as far back as the mid 9th century AD as a location.

During his youth, Shewa was subject to a number of devastating raids by Matolomi, the pagan king of Damot, which lay beyond the Jamma River. One of Matolomi&#x27;s most notorious predations was the raid which led to the abduction of Egzi&#x27;e Haraya; she is said to have been reunited with Tsega Zeab through the intercession of the Archangel Michael; when Matolomi found out that they were escaping he threw a spear which turned from them to his direction and killed him. There are several traditions like that one, some of less historical value than others, which describe Tekle Haymanot&#x27;s interactions with King Matolomi.

His father gave Tekle Haymanot their earliest religious instruction; later he was ordained a priest by the Egyptian Bishop Cyril (known as Kirollos in Coptic).

== Later career ==

The first significant event in his life was when Tekle Haymanot, at the age of 30, travelled north to seek further religious education. His journey took him from Selale to Grarya, then Katata, Damot, Amhara, to end at the monastery of Iyasus Mo&#x27;a, who had only a few years before founded a monastery on an island in the middle of Lake Hayq in the district of Amba Sel (the present-day Amhara Region). There Tekle Haymanot studied under the abbot for nine years before travelling to Tigray, where he visited Axum, then stayed for a while at the monastery of Debre Damo, where he studied under Abbot Yohannes, Iyasus Mo&#x27;a&#x27;s spiritual teacher. By this point he had developed a small group of followers, attracted by his reputation.

Eventually, Tekle Haymanot left Debre Damo with his followers to return to Shewa. En route, he stopped at the monastery of Iyasus Mo&#x27;a, where tradition states he received the full investiture of an Ethiopian monk&#x27;s habit. The historian Taddesse Tamrat sees in the existing accounts of this act an attempt by later writers to justify the seniority of the monastery in Lake Hayq over the followers of Tekle Haymanot.

Once in Shewa, he introduced the spirit of renewal that Christianity was experiencing in the northern provinces. He settled in the central area between Selale and Grarya, where he founded in 1284 the monastery of Debre Atsbo (renamed in the 15th century Debre Libanos). This monastery became one of the most important religious institutions of Ethiopia, not only founding a number of daughter houses, but its abbot became one of the principal leaders of the Ethiopian Church, called the &quot;Echege&quot;, second only to the &quot;Abuna&quot;.

Tekle Haymanot lived for 29 years after the foundation of this monastery, dying in the year before Emperor Wedem Arad did; this would date Tekle Haymanot&#x27;s death to 1313. He was first buried in the cave where he had originally lived as a hermit; almost 60 years later he was reinterred at Debre Libanos. In the 1950s, Emperor Haile Selassie constructed a new church at Debre Libanos Monastery over the site of the Saint&#x27;s tomb. It remains a place of pilgrimage and a favored site for burial for many people across Ethiopia.

== Later traditions ==

Tekle Haymanot is frequently represented as an old man with wings on his back and only one leg visible. There are a number of explanations for this popular image. C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford recount one story, that the saint &quot;having stood too long for about 34 years, one of his legs broke or cut while Satan was attempting to stop his prayers, whereupon he stood on one foot for 7 years.&quot; Paul B. Henze describes his missing leg as appearing as a &quot;severed leg ... in the lower left corner discreetly wrapped in a cloth.&quot; The traveller Thomas Pakenham learned from the Prior of Debre Damo how Tekle Haymanot received his wings:

:One day he said he would go to Jerusalem to see the Garden of Gethsemane and the hill of the skull that is called Golgotha. But Shaitan (Satan) planned to stop Tekla Haymanot going on his journey to the Holy Land, and he cut the rope which led from the rock to the ground just as Tekla Haymanot started to climb down. Then God gave Tekla Haymanot six wings and he flew down to the valley below ... and from that day onwards Teklahaimanot would fly back and forth to Jerusalem above the clouds like an aeroplane.

Many traditions hold that Tekle Haymanot played a significant role in Yekuno Amlak&#x27;s ascension as the restored monarchy of the Solomonic dynasty, following two centuries of rule by the Zagwe dynasty, although historians like Taddesse Tamrat believe these are later inventions. (A few older traditions credit Iyasus Mo&#x27;a with this honour.)

Another tradition credits Tekle Haymanot as the only &quot;Lek&#x27;e P&#x27;ap&#x27;as&quot; of Ethiopia who was born in Ethiopia and who was Ethiopian.
The Christian population and Bishops of Ethiopia wanted Tekle Haimanot to become the &quot;Lek&#x27;e P&#x27;ap&#x27;as&quot; of Ethiopia. After the new &quot;Lek&#x27;e P&#x27;ap&#x27;as&quot; &quot;Abuna Yohannes&quot; from Egypt sent by the Patriarch of Alexandria arrived at Ethiopia he decided to separate: One part of Ethiopia to Tekle Haimanot and one part to himself, but Tekle Haimanot didn&#x27;t want the high rank as &quot;Lek&#x27;e P&#x27;ap&#x27;as&quot; anymore and retired from his position to become a monk again.

A number of hagiographies of this saint have been written. G.W.B. Huntingford mentions two different &quot;gadlat&quot;: &quot;one written by Abba Samuel of Waldiba in the first quarter of the 15th century and the other by one Gibra Maskel of Debre Libanos early in the 16th century&quot;. E.A. Wallis Budge has translated a third one, entitled &quot;The Life of Täklä Haymanot&quot;, which is attributed to one Täklä Sion. Tesfaye Gebre Mariam adds to these another version, popular at the monastery of Debre Libanos and containing far more details of the saint&#x27;s life than any other version of the &quot;gadla&quot;, and which Tesfaye confirmed was written by &quot;Ichege&quot; Yohannis Kema.

<text>The Puerto Rico Islanders were a professional association football team based in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. They played in several different leagues from 2004 to 2012, when they suspended operations. In their last two seasons they played in the North American Soccer League (NASL), the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. They played their home games at Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium. The team&#x27;s colors were orange and white. They were succeeded by Puerto Rico FC.

==History==
===USISL franchise===
In 1995, a team called the Puerto Rico Islanders joined the USISL, now the United Soccer Leagues (USL). The team was founded by Joe Serralta and other Puerto Rican businessmen and played only seven games before Serralta decided to move the franchise to Houston, Texas on June 1, changing its name to the Houston Force. The move was prompted by problems with the Puerto Rican Football Federation and low attendances. The Force folded after one game in Houston.

===Early years (2003–2005)===

Eight years after Serralta&#x27;s first attempt at professional football, he gave it another go and together with a new group of Puerto Rican businessmen officially created another incarnation of the Puerto Rico Islanders. The team played their first season in the A-League in 2004. The original squad included a large number of local Puerto Rican players as well as a contingent of mainland Americans, Brazilians, Salvadorans and Argentines. The team was coached by Brazilian Vitor Hugo Barros who was replaced several games into the season by Argentine Hugo Hernán Maradona, brother of the legendary Diego Armando Maradona. The team played its first league game on April 17, 2004, against the Toronto Lynx at the Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium, the Islanders lost 1–0 in front of a reported 6,000 fans. The Islanders had their first victory on January 15, 2004, against the Charleston Battery with a score of 1–0 at the Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium. Led by players like Mauricio Salles, Raúl Díaz Arce and Luis Fernando Zuleta Mechura the Islanders finished the 2004 season in 14th place, with a record of 5 wins, 17 losses and 6 ties.

In 2005, the Islanders still under Hugo Hernán Maradona brought in a new group of players that would become staples in the club for the next couple of seasons (Petter Villegas, Marco Vélez, Dan Kennedy, Caleb Norkus, Alejandro González Pareja and Noah Delgado), and retained several key players like Mauricio Salles. At the end of the season, the Islanders had an improved season record with 10 wins, 10 losses and 8 ties, this time barely missing the playoff.

===Jorge Alvial Era (2006–2007)===
The Islanders opened their 2006 season with a mix of new players like Argentine Gustavo Barros-Schelotto, Chilean Arturo Norambuena, Canadian Alen Marcina, and homegrown talent Marco Vélez, Alexis Rivera Curet, Rafael Ortiz Huertas, and American Dan Kennedy to create one of the strongest lineups in the club&#x27;s short history, in a serious attempt to take the USL Div. 1 title for the first time.

Formed under the management of then head coach Jorge Alvial, the 2006 Islanders had a record of 3–2–1 up to early June, when Alvial put in his resignation to become a scout for the English club Chelsea. The club lumbered across the last half of the season barely making the playoffs, under the new head coach Toribio Rojas, Jorge Alvial&#x27;s assistant coach, finishing the season in 6th place and with a record of 10–8–10.

In the weekend before the 2006 playoffs, the Islanders hosted Miami FC twice, who had Brazilians Romário and Zinho in their line up. The Islanders needed four points to qualify for the Playoffs. After going down 0–2 in the first half the Islanders managed to come back and win 4–2 in front of 8,600.

In the final game of the season against Miami on September 10, 2006, they attracted a record crowd of nearly 11,000 fans. Early in the second half Miami took the lead. It wasn&#x27;t until the 43rd minute of the second half that the Islanders equalized with an Arturo Norambuena penalty. A draw was sufficient for the Islanders to qualify in front of Seattle and Atlanta.

In the first round of the playoffs, the team played a home-away series against the Charleston Battery. Unfortunately for the Islanders, Charleston won the series 3–2, ending the 2006 season for the Puerto Ricans.

The team came into the 2007 season on a high, they had just played a preseason tournament against MLS teams and achieved very successful results. They also had signed several dangerous players like Panamanian trio Victor Herrera, a Panamanian international, Gustavo Avila, and Alberto Zapata, a new goalkeeper Josh Saunders, rookie Jay Needham, plus a return of players like Marco Vélez, Petter Villegas and Noah Delgado. The squad was considered serious contenders for the title.

After one early success, the team took a turn for the worse. It was evident that Toribio Rojas had lost his edge and after an embarrassing 2–1 loss against bottom table Minnesota Thunder was let go from his coaching position and given the post of Youth System Director, when he left the team with a record of 1–3–3. Also, attendance declined.

===Clarke Era (2007–2011)===

Acting quickly, the club replaced Rojas with former FC Dallas manager Colin Clarke, who had found himself without a job after the Virginia Beach Mariners went out of business. He immediately established himself as a hard and hotheaded coach demanding discipline from his players. Shortly after he was nicknamed &quot;El General&quot; by the media and fans because of the way he led the squad during practice. 
This change also translated in a change of fortunes for the club, in the first match under Clarke the club beat the Minnesota Thunder 2–1, just a week after, under Toribio, they had lost against them. Clarke also brought in players who would become key figures in the future like Haitian International Fabrice Noel, then Englishman, now Kenyan International, Taiwo Atieno Willie Simms on loan from New England Revolution, and John Krause, who played briefly for Clarke on the Mariners. The club would finish comfortably in 6th place, two spots on top of the last playoff spot.

The Islanders managed to edge out Montreal during its Quarterfinals series with an aggregate score of 5–3, but fell 4–2 in penalties against regular-season champions Seattle Sounders after losing the home leg and tying the series in Seattle.

The 2008 season would be Clarke&#x27;s first full season as the club&#x27;s manager and he worked quickly to revamp the club&#x27;s line-up, bringing back just a few players from the 2007 squad. He would bring in players like Sandi Gbandi, Jonny Steele, Bill Gaudette, Kendall Jagdeosingh, Osei Telesford among other who would prove key in the race for the regular season title. After a brief preseason in Florida playing against weaker college sides, the Islanders started the 2008 season with a 1–0 defeat against Portland, the club had a slow start with a record of 1 victory, 2 ties and 3 losses in its first 6 games, but by the end of July the Islanders were on a 5-game victory streak that would lay the foundation for their first Commissioner&#x27;s Cup run. On August 8 the club would beat Rochester 4–0 putting them for the first time at the top of the table, a position they would compete for against Vancouver for the rest of the season.

The Islanders would finish the season with a 15–9–6 record clinching the first position and the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup. On top of that they achieved this even with a crowded schedule that had them playing 4 games a week between the CCL and the USL-1 Regular season and the Playoffs.

The Islanders would be seeded in the semifinals of the league&#x27;s Playoffs where they would beat Rochester on an aggregate of 3–2 winning them a spot in the finals against Vancouver. In a controversial decision, the league awarded Vancouver the right to host the finals. After a 3–0 defeat against Santos Laguna in the CCL the club headed to Vancouver where after a hard-fought game, the Islanders lost 2–1. The club would also sweep the USL-1 individual awards starting with Coach of the Year Colin Clarke, Defender of the Year (Cristian Arrieta), Goalkeeper of the Year (Bill Gaudette), and USL-1 MVP (Jonny Steele).

The Islanders just coming off a successful 2008 season started preparations for 2009 early in February where they traveled to Florida for a group of friendlies against teams like New York Red Bulls, Chicago Fire and the 2008 MLS Champions Columbus Crew. The club in an attempt to repeat what was achieved the previous year brought back the bulk of the roster with the notable exception of Kenyan International Taiwo Atieno and Salvadorian Edwin Miranda. Also they signed manager Colin Clarke to a three-year contract as a way to bring continuity to the squad.

Before the CCL&#x27;s Quarterfinals Clarke, as a way to strengthen the squad brought in midfielder Martin Nuñez from the Carolina Railhawks, defender Kevon Villaroel from San Juan Jabloteh, and striker Sean Fraser from Miami FC. But most notably Jamaican striker Nicholas Addlery who had an immediate impact on the club scoring 5 goals in his first five games with the Islanders. The club would make it all the way to the semi-finals, where they lost to Cruz Azul of Mexico in penalty shots after the series was tied 3–3 in Estadio Azul, Mexico City on April 7. During this time they also acquired former Los Angeles Galaxy defender Kyle Veris, midfielder Domenic Mediate, who had just been released from D.C. United, and goalkeeper Chris McClellan formally with the Carolina Railhawks.
Almost two weeks after their defeat in the CCL the club entered the USL 1 season as heavy favorites opening their season against defending Champions Vancouver Whitecaps on April 18 with a 2–1 victory at Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium, Bayamón. In September 2010 the Islanders announced they were leaving the USL to join the North American Soccer League for the 2011 season.

Clarke left the Islanders at the end of the 2011 season after accepting the job as Carolina RailHawks head coach, replacing Martin Rennie at that club, who had recently been promoted to head coach of Major League Soccer&#x27;s Vancouver Whitecaps FC. On December 8, 2011, Islanders assistant coach Adrian Whitbread was named Clarke&#x27;s successor. The Islanders finished 3rd in the regular season but were upset by the Minnesota Stars in the playoffs.

===Suspension of play and Puerto Rico FC (2012–2015)===

The Islanders announced in late 2012 that they would sit out the spring half of the 2013 North American Soccer League season; later, they announced that they would sit out the entire 2013 season with the aim of restructuring and returning for 2014. This came on the heels of a season where the Islanders were forced to play home games at Bayamon Soccer Complex while Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium was being renovated and subsequently averaged just 1,864 fans. In August 2013, club management informed the league that the Islanders would not resume league activities in 2014 due to an inability to secure adequate funding. In 2015, Puerto Rico FC was founded and the Islanders&#x27; supporter groups were revived. The new club began play during 2016 North American Soccer League season.

==International performance==
In 2006 the Islanders venture into the international stage participating in the CFU Club Championship, in hope of qualifying for the CONCACAF Champions Cup. This is possible because Puerto Rican football is governed by the Federación Puertorriqueña de Fútbol instead of the United States Soccer Federation. This first attempt at international success was the first time a team from Puerto Rico ever participated in its confederation&#x27;s club competitions. The CFU Club Championship 2006 played in November saw the Islanders host Group C which included Hoppers F.C. (Antigua and Barbuda), W Connection (Trinidad and Tobago) and Fruta Conquerors (Guyana), the latter dropped out of the tournament weeks before group play. The Islanders beat Hoppers FC 3–1 but lost to W-Connection 0–1 ending the squads first international appearance.

In October 2007, the Islanders came into the CFU Club Championship 2007 with a much stronger squad, which was relatively unchanged from the squad that made it to the semifinals of the USL First Division playoffs and it showed, making it all the way to the tournaments semifinals losing out to Joe Public F.C. 0–1 from a late goal. The entire tournament was played in Trinidad and Tobago, the Islanders headed their group with a 2–2 tied against Harbor View FC, which later became the tournament&#x27;s champions, and two victories. In this tournament, the team also broke several of their on-field records, it achieved its highest score line, a 10–0 victory over Hitachi Centre SAP FC, in the same game Fabrice Noël scored the team&#x27;s first ever hat trick with a tally of four goals. This would be the last time the Islanders would play to try to qualify to this incarnation of the confederations top club tournament, since this competition format was abandoned in 2008.

===2008–2009 CONCACAF Champions League===

The team played in the new CONCACAF Champions League, which replaced CONCACAF Champions Cup in 2008–2009. The Islanders were given a chance to qualify as the 2008 CFU Club Championship would be played after the CCL starts, three Caribbean sides would be chosen from last years CFU CC; the Champions, runner-up and the third place team. Since the third place game wasn&#x27;t played during the tournament the Islanders and San Juan Jabloteh (the 2007 local Trinidad &amp; Tobago League Champions), the two teams that lost in the semifinals, played a Home-Away Series to determine who would take the last spot, which ended in a 1–0 aggregate in favor of the Islanders.
The Islanders were later matched up against regional powerhouse L.D. Alajuelense of Costa Rica in the preliminary round of the CONCACAF Champions League. The first leg of the series was played on August 27, 2008, in the Alajuelense home ground, the Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto and in front of 900 spectators, the game ended with a hard-fought 1–1 draw. The second leg was played on September 3, and it took the Islanders two late goals to come from behind and win the game 2–1; with an aggregate of 3–2, the Islanders advanced to the group stage, being placed in Group D, which included Club Santos Laguna, Tauro F.C., and C.S.D. Municipal. In the first game of this round, the team defeated Tauro F.C. by one goal, with a final score of 2–1. On September 23, the Islanders defeated Santos Laguna, 3–1. In the third game, the team tied with Municipal with two goals each. On the return matches, the team lost to Santos FC 3–0 in Torreón, Mexico playing with their &quot;bench&quot; team preparing for their respective USL semi-finals matches. After in a close game back in Puerto Rico it was C.S.D. Municipal&#x27;s turn in a 0–1 loss with a goal near the end of the match. These two losses had the team in a tight position as they were also going through their USL finals match. It was a must win situation for the last match against Tauro F.C. in Panama or at least a tie in order to qualify for the next stage in the tournament. On October 29, 2008, Islanders FC vs Tauro F.C. ended in a battled 2–2 match which resulted in favor of Islanders FC and qualified them for the final eight of the CONCACAF Champions League. On December 10, 2008, the Islanders were paired against C.D. Marathón in the final eight draft. On February 26, 2009, the team defeated C.D. Marathón 2–1, playing at Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium. In the second date of this stage, they pulled off a last-minute victory, one goal to none, in a game that took place at San Pedro Sula. On March 17, 2009, The Islanders defeated Cruz Azul, two goals to none, in the first leg of the semifinals in Bayamón. On the second leg, played on April 7, 2009, Cruz Azul won 2–0 and drove the game into extra time, where it ended 3–1, the away goal not being a tie breaker because the away goals rule do not apply in extra time in CONCACAF. The game was decided on penalties and ended 4–2 in favor of Cruz Azul.

===2009–10 CONCACAF Champions League===

The Puerto Rico Islanders started the CONCACAF Champions League 2009-10 on July 29, 2009, against Toronto FC in preliminary round action. The Islanders won the first match 1–0 with a goal from Kendall Jagdeosingh. The return match was played to a goalless draw, and so the Islanders advanced to the group round.

In the Group Phase, the Islanders lost away to the Crew 2–0, then lost away at Saprissa. They were able to draw at home against Cruz Azul in Matchday 3, albeit after giving up the lead late in the match. On matchday 4, they were again ahead at home, but allowed a goal at the buzzer to leave the game a 1–1 draw vs Saprissa. On match day 5, the Islanders lost to Cruz Azul in Mexico City, 2–0. This loss officially eliminated the Islanders from advancement in the tournament.

===2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League===

The Islanders began the Champions League on July 27, 2010, with a 4–1 away win at Major League Soccer&#x27;s Los Angeles Galaxy and advanced to the group stage after winning 5–3 on aggregate (despite losing 1–2 at home). In the group stage, the Islanders finished 3rd behind Club Toluca and Club Deportivo Olimpia, getting eliminated from the competition.

===PRSL Supercopa 2010===

2010 was the first year that the Puerto Rico Islanders played in a tournament from the PRSL in the form of the Supercopa DirecTV 2010. They were placed in group B of the tournament. The Islanders made their debut vs Sevilla FC Puerto Rico with the game ending as a draw. Four days later, they played Puerto Rico United with a final score of 3 to 0 in favor of them. On November 12, 2010, the Islanders thrashed Caguas Huracán 11 to nothing. The Islanders finished in second place in the Supercopa.

==Colors and badge==
During the club&#x27;s first two years (2004–2005) they played in all white and all blue kits, with no clear distinction between which was considered its home kit. In 2006 the club adopted orange, dark blue and white as their primary colors. That year they wore dark blue with thick vertical orange stripes and dark blue shorts as their home kits and orange with white thick vertical stripes and orange shorts as their away kit. In 2007 the club switch to orange with white vertical pinstripes and orange shorts as their home kits and dark blue with orange vertical stripes that curve towards the sleeve and dark blue shorts as their away kit. The current home kits is an all orange one, while the away kit is white with gray horizontal pinstripes and white shorts.

Since 2006 the club has also added a third kit which was white until 2007. In 2008 the club used a neon green kit with two lighter neon green vertical stripes and black shorts. For the present year, 2009, the third kit is solid royal blue shirt and shorts.

===History of the kit===

==Stadium==

* Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium; Bayamón, Puerto Rico (2004–present)

This incarnation of the Islanders has always played their home games at Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium in the city of Bayamón, which is located about 10 minutes from the Capital San Juan. The &quot;JRL&quot;, as it is now known, was originally a baseball stadium scheduled for demolition, and in 2003, it was converted into a soccer stadium for the Islanders. It is also home to all levels of the Puerto Rico national football team as well as the Islanders&#x27; affiliate team in the local Puerto Rico Soccer League, Bayamón FC.

The stadium has a capacity of 12,500 spectators. In 2008, the USL did not allow the #1-seed Islanders to host the USL-1 Championship match, citing that the Stadium was unsuitable. The match was played in Vancouver, where Puerto Rico lost to the Whitecaps, 2–1. On December 8 of 2008, the Finance Vice-President of the club Jorge Pierluisi, established a preliminary meeting with the firm CMA Architects and Engineers along with Positive Impact-Sports and Entertainment Management Consultants to discuss and evaluate improvements to the stadium and the remodeling of such.

==Club culture==
===Supporters===
The Islanders have a loyal fan base in Puerto Rico and a small but strong following in the States. Fans come from all over the Island to watch the club play in Bayamón, something uncommon for Puerto Ricans, who tend to be very regionalistic when it comes to supporting professional sports. The team averages between 4,000 and 6,000 fans per game in its home stadium, Juan Ramon Loubriel. The club&#x27;s supporter group is known as &quot;La Barra Naranja&quot; led by the O.S.U. or Orange Star Ultras. The Islanders also have an away game independent supporters group known as &quot;La Legion Extranjera&quot; or the Foreign Legion which is mostly composed of Islanders fans of Puerto Rican origin who live in the United States and travel to the cities in which the team plays.

===Rivalries===
The club&#x27;s main rivalry was against the Charleston Battery, going back to the Islanders&#x27; first year in the A-League. Charleston was the first team the Islanders beat and since then the Islanders have routinely beaten or tied Charleston. In 2006, Charleston stopped the Islanders&#x27; playoff run, giving them their only victory in the series. In 2007, the Islanders beat the Battery in the last game of the season, stopping Charleston&#x27;s hope for a playoff berth. The Islanders currently have a record of 10 wins, 1 loss and 7 ties against their South Carolina rivals. From 2008, the Islanders have met with the Rochester Rhinos in the USL-NASL playoffs with the Islanders eliminating the Rhinos from the series in both 2008 and 2009.

The Islanders&#x27; main rivals within Puerto Rico are Club Atlético River Plate Puerto Rico. Their rivalry dates back to around the year 2005 when River wanted to join the USL, but the Islanders had territorial rights in Puerto Rico and they didn&#x27;t allow River to join. Ever since then River Plate&#x27;s front office, fans, and some players have had a grudge against the Islanders. The rivalry is a very special one though because the teams had never faced in neither an official nor an unofficial match until 2010, even though the rivalry started way before then. With the Islanders joining the Puerto Rico Soccer League, their rivalry is expected to become into the first Puerto Rican Football Classic or &quot;El Clásico Boricua&quot;. Their first two matches took place in the Supercopa DirecTV 2010 finals in 2010. River won both games and went on to win the championship.

===Puerto Rico Islanders C===
The Puerto Rico Islanders C is the club&#x27;s U-20 team. It participates in the Puerto Rican 2nd Division, with the goal of developing players from PRISA with extraordinary potential so that they can eventually make the jump to either the Islanders or Bayamón FC.

===Puerto Rico Islanders Academy===
The Puerto Rico Islanders Soccer Academy or PRISA was founded in 2006 and it is made up of U6, U8, U12, U14, U15, U17 youth teams and the Islanders C squad (U20). In 2008 the Islanders opened another academy in the northern city of Arecibo under the PRISA umbrella called the Arecibo Islanders Soccer Academy, which is composed from U5 to U20 teams.

===Mascot===
Populoso was the mascot of the Puerto Rico Islanders soccer team. Populoso was a large bear who wears the same color kit uniform as the Islanders: navy blue, orange, and white. When the Islanders score Populoso is there to encourage the fans. Populoso has the Puerto Rico dance, which is called the Islanders FC mascot dance. Populoso does his dances with the cheerleaders of the Puerto Rico Islanders.

==Broadcasting==
For the 2011 season, the company OneLink Communications broadcast all Puerto Rico Islanders home games in Spanish only for Puerto Rico.
They broadcast in English via the official website of the Puerto Rico Islanders with live streaming for free.

<text>Somnath temple (IAST: somanātha) or Deo Patan, is a Hindu temple, located in Prabhas Patan, Veraval in Gujarat, India. It is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites the Tirtha Kshetra for Hindus and is the first among the twelve &quot;jyotirlinga&quot; shrines of Shiva. It is unclear when the first version of the Somnath temple was built, with estimates varying between the early centuries of the 1st millennium and about the 9th century CE. Various texts, including the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, mention a &quot;tirtha&quot; (pilgrimage site) at Prabhas Patan on the coastline of Saurashtra, where the later temple was, but archaeology has not found traces of an early temple, though there was a settlement there.

The temple was reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by multiple Muslim invaders and rulers, notably starting with an attack by Mahmud Ghazni in January 1026.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, historians and archaeologists of the colonial era actively studied the Somnath temple because its ruins showed a historic Hindu temple that was turning into an Islamic mosque. After India&#x27;s independence, those ruins were demolished, and the present Somnath temple was reconstructed in the Māru-Gurjara style of Hindu temple architecture. The contemporary Somnath temple&#x27;s reconstruction was started under the orders of the first Deputy Prime Minister of India, Vallabhbhai Patel, after receiving approval for reconstruction from Mahatma Gandhi. The reconstruction was completed in May 1951, after Gandhi&#x27;s death.

==Location==
The Somnath temple is located along the coastline in Prabhas Patan, Veraval, Saurashtra region of Gujarat. It is about southwest of Ahmedabad, south of Junagadh – another major archaeological and pilgrimage site in Gujarat. It is about southeast of the Veraval railway junction, about southeast of the Porbandar airport and about west of the Diu airport.

The Somnath temple is located close to the ancient trading port of Veraval, one of three in Gujarat from where Indian merchants departed to trade goods. The 11th-century Persian historian Al-Biruni states that Somnath has become so famous because &quot;it was the harbor for seafaring people and a station for those who went to and fro between Sufala in the country of Zanj (east Africa) and China&quot;. Combined with its repute as an eminent pilgrimage site, its location was well known to the kingdoms within the Indian subcontinent. Literature and epigraphical evidence suggest that the medieval-era Veraval port was also actively trading with the Middle East and Southeast Asia. This brought wealth and fame to the Veraval area, as well as the temple.

The site of Prabhas Patan was occupied during the Indus Valley Civilisation, 2000–1200 BCE. It was one of very few sites in the Junagadh district to be so occupied. After abandonment in 1200 BCE, it was reoccupied in 400 BCE and continued into the historical period. Prabhas is also close to the other sites similarly occupied: Junagadh, Dwarka, Padri and Bharuch.

==Nomenclature and significance==
Somnath means &quot;Lord of the Soma&quot; or &quot;moon&quot;. The site is also called &quot;Prabhasa&quot; (&quot;place of splendor&quot;). Somnath temple has been a &quot;jyotirlinga&quot; site for the Hindus, and a holy place of pilgrimage (&quot;tirtha)&quot;. It is one of five most revered sites on the seacoast of India, along with the nearby Dwaraka in Gujarat, Puri in Odisha, Rameswaram and Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu.

==Scriptural mentions==
Many Hindu texts provide a list of the most sacred Shiva pilgrimage sites, along with a guide for visiting the site. The best known were the &quot;Mahatmya&quot; genre of texts. Of these, Somnatha temple tops the list of &quot;jyotirlingas&quot; in the &quot;Jnanasamhita&quot; – chapter 13 of the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, and the oldest known text with a list of &quot;jyotirlingas&quot;. Other texts include the &quot;Varanasi Mahatmya&quot; (found in &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;), the &quot;Shatarudra Samhita&quot; and the &quot;Kothirudra Samhita&quot;. All either directly mention the Somnath temple as the number one of twelve sites, or call the top temple as &quot;Somesvara&quot; in Saurashtra – a synonymous term for this site in these texts. The exact date of these texts is unknown, but based on references they make to other texts and ancient poets or scholars, these have been generally dated between the 10th and 12th century, with some dating it much earlier and others a bit later.

The Somnath temple is not mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, but the &quot;Prabhasa-Pattana&quot; is mentioned as a &quot;tirtha&quot; (pilgrimage site). For example, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (c. 400 CE in its mature form) in Chapters 109, 118 and 119 of the Book Three (&quot;Vana Parva&quot;), and Sections 10.45 and 10.78 of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; state Prabhasa to be a &quot;tirtha&quot; on the coastline of Saurashtra.

Alf Hiltebeitel – a Sanskrit scholar known for his translations and studies on Indic texts including the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, states that the appropriate context for the legends and mythologies in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; are the Vedic mythologies which it borrowed, integrated and re-adapted for its times and its audience. The &quot;Brahmana&quot; layer of the Vedic literature already mention &quot;tirtha&quot; related to the Saraswati river. However, given the river was nowhere to be seen when the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; was compiled and finalized, the Saraswati legend was modified. It vanishes into an underground river, then emerges as an underground river at holy sites for &quot;sangam&quot; (confluence) already popular with the Hindus. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; then integrates the Saraswati legend of the Vedic lore with the Prabhasa &quot;tirtha&quot;, states Hiltebeitel. The critical editions of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, in several chapters and books mentions that this &quot;Prabhasa&quot; is at a coastline near Dvaraka. It is described as a sacred site where Arjuna and Balarama go on &quot;tirtha&quot;, a site where Lord Krishna chooses to go and spends his final days, then dies.

Catherine Ludvik – a Religious Studies and Sanskrit scholar, concurs with Hiltebeitel. She states that the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; mythologies borrow from the Vedic texts but modify them from Brahmin-centered &quot;sacrificial rituals&quot; to &quot;tirtha rituals&quot; that are available to everyone – the intended audience of the great epic. More specifically, she states that the sacrificial sessions along the Saraswati river found in sections such as of &quot;Pancavimsa Brahmana&quot; were modified to &quot;tirtha&quot; sites in the context of the Saraswati river in sections of &quot;Vana Parva&quot; and &quot;Shalya Parva&quot;. Thus the mythology of &quot;Prabhasa&quot; in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, which it states to be &quot;by the sea, near Dwaraka&quot;. This signifies an expanded context of pilgrimage as a &quot;Vedic ritual equivalent&quot;, integrating &quot;Prabhasa&quot; that must have been already important as a &quot;tirtha&quot; site when the &quot;Vana Parva&quot; and &quot;Shalya Parva&quot; compilation was complete.

The 5th century poem &quot;Raghuvamsa&quot; of Kalidasa mentions Somanatha-Prabhasa as a &quot;tirtha&quot; along with Prayaga, Pushkara, Gokarna. Bathing in one of these &quot;tirthas&quot; is meant to release one from the cycle of births and deaths.

Archaeologically, there is no evidence that a temple existed at the site in ancient times.

==History==
The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage site from ancient times on account of being a &quot;Triveni Sangam&quot; (the confluence of three rivers: Kapila, Hiran and Saraswati). Soma, the Moon god, is believed to have lost his lustre due to a curse, and he bathed in the Sarasvati River at this site to regain it. The result is said to be the waxing and waning of the moon. The name of the town, &quot;Prabhasa&quot;, meaning lustre, as well as the alternative name &quot;Someshvara&quot; (&quot;the lord of the moon&quot; or &quot;the moon god&quot;), arise from this tradition.
The name &quot;Someshvara&quot; begins to appear starting in the 9th century. The Gurjara-Pratihara king Nagabhata II () recorded that he has visited &quot;tirthas&quot; in Saurashtra, including &quot;Someshvara&quot;. Romila Thapar states that this may not imply the existence of a temple, but rather that it was a pilgrimage site (&quot;tirtha&quot;). The Chaulukya (Solanki) king Mularaja possibly built the first temple for &quot;Soma&quot; (&quot;moon god&quot;) at the site sometime before 997 CE, even though some historians believe that he may have renovated a smaller earlier temple.
In 1026, during the reign of Bhima I, the Turkic Muslim ruler Mahmud of Ghazni raided and plundered the Somnath temple, breaking its &quot;jyotirlinga&quot;. He took away a booty of 20 million dinars. According to Romila Thapar, relying on a 1038 inscription of a Kadamba king of Goa, the condition of Somnath temple in 1026 after Ghazni&#x27;s is unclear because the inscription is &quot;puzzlingly silent&quot; about Ghazni&#x27;s raid or temple&#x27;s condition. This inscription, states Thapar, could suggest that instead of destruction it may have been a desecration because the temple seems to have been repaired quickly within twelve years and was an active pilgrimage site by 1038.

The raid of 1026 by Mahmud is confirmed by the 11th-century Persian historian Al-Biruni, who worked in the court of Mahmud, who accompanied Mahmud&#x27;s troops between 1017 and 1030 CE on some occasions, and who lived in the northwest Indian subcontinent region – over regular intervals, though not continuously. The invasion of Somnath site in 1026 CE is also confirmed by other Islamic historians such as Gardizi, Ibn Zafir and Ibn al-Athir. However, two Persian sources – one by adh-Dhahabi and other by al-Yafi&#x27;i – state it as 1027 CE, which is likely incorrect and late by a year, according to Khan – a scholar known for his studies on Al-Biruni and other Persian historians. According to Al-Biruni:

Al-Biruni states that Mahmud destroyed the Somnath temple. He states Mahmud&#x27;s motives as, &quot;raids undertaken with a view to plunder and to satisfy the righteous iconoclasm of a true Muslim... [he] returned to Ghazna laden with costly spoils from the Hindu temples.&quot; Al-Biruni obliquely criticizes these raids for &quot;ruining the prosperity&quot; of India, creating antagonism among the Hindus for &quot;all foreigners&quot;, and triggering an exodus of scholars of Hindu sciences far away from regions &quot;conquered by us&quot;. Mahmud launched many plunder campaigns into India, including one that included the sack of Somnath temple.
According to Jamal Malik – a South Asian history and Islamic Studies scholar, &quot;the destruction of Somnath temple, a well known place of pilgrimage in Gujarat in 1026, played a major role in creating Mahmud as an &quot;icon of Islam&quot;, the sack of this temple became &quot;a crucial topic in Persian stories of Islamic iconoclasm&quot;. Many Muslim historians and scholars in and after the 11th century included the destruction of Somnath as a righteous exemplary deed in their publications. It inspired the Persian side with a cultural memory of Somnath&#x27;s destruction through &quot;epics of conquest&quot;, while to the Hindu side, Somnath inspired tales of recovery, rebuilding and &quot;epics of resistance&quot;. These tales and chronicles in Persia elevated Mahmud as &quot;the exemplary hero and Islamic warrior for the Muslims&quot;, states Malik, while in India Mahmud emerged as the exemplary &quot;arch-enemy&quot;.

Powerful legends with intricate detail developed in the Turko-Persian literature regarding Mahmud&#x27;s raid. According to historian Cynthia Talbot, a later tradition states that &quot;50,000 devotees lost their lives in trying to stop Mahmud&quot; during his sack of Somnath temple. According to Thapar, the &quot;50,000 killed&quot; is a boastful claim that is &quot;constantly reiterated&quot; in Muslim texts, and becomes a &quot;formulaic&quot; figure of deaths to help highlight &quot;Mahmud’s legitimacy in the eyes of established Islam&quot;.

After being exhorted by Bhava Brihaspati, a Pashupata ascetic, Kumarapala (r. 1143–72) rebuilt the Somnath temple in &quot;excellent stone and studded it with jewels,&quot; according to an inscription in 1169. He replaced a decaying wooden temple.

During its 1299 invasion of Gujarat, Alauddin Khalji&#x27;s army, led by Ulugh Khan, defeated the Vaghela king Karna, and sacked the Somnath temple. Legends in the later texts &quot;Kanhadade Prabandha&quot; (15th century) and &quot;Nainsi ri&quot; &quot;Khyat&quot; (17th century) state that the Jalore ruler Kanhadadeva later recovered the Somnath idol and freed the Hindu prisoners, after an attack on the Delhi army near Jalore. However, other sources state that the idol was taken to Delhi, where it was thrown to be trampled under the feet of Muslims. These sources include the contemporary and near-contemporary texts including Amir Khusrau&#x27;s &quot;Khazainul-Futuh&quot;, Ziauddin Barani&#x27;s &quot;Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi&quot; and Jinaprabha Suri&#x27;s &quot;Vividha-tirtha-kalpa&quot;. It is possible that the story of Kanhadadeva&#x27;s rescue of the Somnath idol is a fabrication by the later writers. Alternatively, it is possible that the Khalji army was taking multiple idols to Delhi, and Kanhadadeva&#x27;s army retrieved one of them.

The temple was rebuilt by Mahipala I, the Chudasama king of Saurashtra in 1308 and the &quot;lingam&quot; was installed by his son Khengara sometime between 1331 and 1351. As late as the 14th century, Gujarati Muslim pilgrims were noted by Amir Khusrow to stop at that temple to pay their respects before departing for the Hajj pilgrimage.
In 1395, the temple was destroyed for the third time by Zafar Khan, the last governor of Gujarat under the Delhi Sultanate and later founder of Gujarat Sultanate. In 1451, it was desecrated by Mahmud Begada, the Sultan of Gujarat.

By 1665, the temple, one of many, was ordered to be destroyed by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. However, the order appears not to have been carried out at that time. Aurangzeb ordered its destruction and conversion into a mosque again in 1706; this order does seem to have been carried out, though very little effort seems to have been put into the conversion.

===British Raj===

In 1842, Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough issued his &quot;Proclamation of the Gates&quot;, in which he ordered the British army in Afghanistan to return via Ghazni and bring back to India the sandalwood gates from the tomb of Mahmud of Ghazni in Ghazni, Afghanistan. These were believed to have been taken by Mahmud from Somnath. Under Ellenborough&#x27;s instruction, General William Nott removed the gates in September 1842. A whole sepoy regiment, the 6th Jat Light Infantry, was detailed to carry the gates back to India in triumph. However, on arrival, they were found not to be of Gujarati or Indian design, and not of Sandalwood, but of Deodar wood (native to Ghazni) and therefore not authentic to Somnath. They were placed in the arsenal store-room of the Agra Fort where they still lie to the present day. There was a debate in the House of Commons in London in 1843 on the question of the gates of the temple and Ellenbourough&#x27;s role in the affair. After much crossfire between the British Government and the opposition, all of the facts as we know them were laid out.

In the 19th century novel &quot;The Moonstone&quot; by Wilkie Collins, the diamond of the title is presumed to have been stolen from the temple at Somnath and, according to the historian Romila Thapar, reflects the interest aroused in Britain by the gates. Her 2004 book on Somnath examines the evolution of the historiographies about the legendary Gujarat temple.

===Reconstruction during 1950–1951===

Before independence, Veraval was part of the Junagadh State, whose ruler had acceded to Pakistan in 1947. India contested the accession and annexed the state after holding a referendum. India&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel came to Junagadh on 12 November 1947 to direct the stabilization of the state by the Indian Army, at which time he ordered the reconstruction of the Somnath temple.

When Patel, K. M. Munshi and other leaders of the Congress went to Mahatma Gandhi with their proposal to reconstruct the Somnath temple, Gandhi blessed the move but suggested that the funds for the construction should be collected from the public, and the temple should not be funded by the state. Accordingly, The Somnath Trust was established to collect funds and oversee the construction of the temple. Munshi headed the Trust. Being the Civil Supplies minister in the Government of India, Munshi was keen to involve the Government of India in the reconstruction effort, but he was overruled by Nehru. According to Pandit Prem Nath Bazaz, there had been an agreement between the U.P. Government and the Indian Sugar Syndicate, wherein six annas (that is 40 paise) had to be collected out of the price of every mound of sugar by the Syndicate for the renovation of the Somnath temple.

The ruins were pulled down in October 1950. The mosque present at that site was shifted few kilometres away by using construction vehicles. The new structure was built by the traditional Sompura builders of temples in Gujarat. On 11 May 1951, Rajendra Prasad, the President of India performed the installation ceremony for the temple at the invitation of Munshi.

=== 21st century ===
As of 2024, the pilgrim corridor is under planning. As a part of land requirement, the encroachments were removed and land was reclaimed in 2024. Further land acquisitions were also planned.

== Temple architecture ==
=== Pre-11th century temple ===
The floor plan and ruins of a pre-1000 CE temple were unearthed during the archaeological excavations led by B.K. Thapar. Most of the temple is lost, but the remains of the foundation, the lower structure as well as pieces of the temple ruins suggest an &quot;exquisitely carved, rich&quot; temple. According to Dhaky – a scholar of Indian temple architecture, this is the earliest known version of the Somnath temple. It was, what historic Sanskrit &quot;vastu sastra&quot; texts call the &quot;tri-anga sandhara prasada&quot;. Its &quot;garbhagriha&quot; (sanctum) was connected to a &quot;mukhamandapa&quot; (entrance hall) and &quot;gudhamandapa&quot;.

The temple opened to the east. The stylobate of this destroyed temple had two parts: the 3 feet high pitha-socle and the vedibandha-podium. The pitha had a tall &quot;bhitta&quot;, joined to the jadyakumbha, ornamented with what Dhaky calls &quot;crisp and charming foliage pattern&quot;. The kumbha of the Vedibandha had a Surasenaka with a niche that contained the figure of Lakulisa – this evidence affirms that the lost temple was a Shiva temple.

The excavations yielded pieces of one at the western end, which suggests that the kumbhas were aligned to the entire wall. Above the kalaga moulding was an &quot;antarapatta&quot;, states Dhaky, but no information is available to determine its design or ornamentation. The surviving fragment of the kapotapali that was discovered suggests that at &quot;intervals, it was decorated with contra-posed half thakaras, with large, elegant, and carefully shaped gagarakas in suspension graced the lower edge of the kapotapali&quot;, states Dhaky. The garbhagriha had a vedibandha, possibly with a two-layered jangha with images on the main face showing the influence of the late Maha-Maru style. Another fragment found had a &quot;beautifully moulded rounded pillarette and a ribbed khuraccadya-awning topped the khattaka&quot;.

The mukhachatuski, states Dhaky, likely broke and fell immediately after the destructive hit by Mahmud&#x27;s troops. These fragments suffered no further erosion or damage one would normally expect, likely because it was left in the foundation pit of the new Somnath temple that was rebuilt quickly after Mahmud left. The &quot;quality of craftsmanship&quot; in these fragments is &quot;indeed high&quot;, the carvings of the lost temple were &quot;rich and exquisite&quot;, states Dhaky. Further, a few pieces have an inscription fragment in the 10th-century characters – which suggests that this part of the temple or the entire temple was built in the 10th century.

;19th-century ruined Somnath temple partly converted into mosque
The efforts of colonial era archaeologists, photographers and surveyors have yielded several reports on the architecture and arts seen at the Somnath temple ruins in the 19th century. The earliest survey reports of Somnath temple and the condition of the Somanatha-Patan-Veraval town in the 19th century were published between 1830 and 1850 by British officers and scholars. Alexander Burnes surveyed the site in 1830, calling Somnath site as &quot;far-famed temple and city&quot;. He wrote:


He states that the site shows how the temple had been changed into a Muslim structure with arch, these sections had been reconstructed with &quot;mutilated pieces of the temple&#x27;s exterior&quot; and &quot;inverted Hindu images&quot;. Such modifications in the dilapidated Somnath temple to make it into a &quot;Mohammedan sanctuary&quot;, states Burnes, is &quot;proof of Mohammedan devastation&quot; of this site. Burnes also summarized some of the mythologies he heard, the bitter communal sentiments and accusations, as well as the statements by garrisoned &quot;Arabs of the Junagar [Junagadh] chief&quot; about their victories in this &quot;infidel land&quot;.

The survey report of Captain Postans was published in 1846. He states:
A more detailed survey report of Somnath temple ruins was published in 1931 by Henry Cousens. Cousens states that the Somnath temple is dear to the Hindu consciousness, its history and lost splendor remembered by them, and no other temple in Western India is &quot;so famous in the annals of Hinduism as the temple of Somanatha at Somanatha-Pattan&quot;. The Hindu pilgrims walk to the ruins here and visit it along with their pilgrimage to Dwarka, Gujarat, though it has been reduced to a 19th-century site of gloom, full of &quot;ruins and graves&quot;. His survey report states:

;Present temple
The present temple is a Māru-Gurjara architecture (also called Chaulukya or Solanki style) temple. It has a &quot;Kailash Mahameru Prasad&quot; form, and reflects the skill of the Sompura Salats, one of Gujarat&#x27;s master masons.

The architect of the new Somnath temple was Prabhashankarbhai Oghadbhai Sompura, who worked on recovering and integrating the old recoverable parts with the new design in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The new Somnath temple is intricately carved, two level temple with pillared mandapa and 212 relief panels.
The temple&#x27;s śikhara, or main spire, is in height above the sanctum, and it has an 8.2-metre-tall flag pole at the top. According to Ananda Coomaraswamy – an art and architecture historian, the earlier Somnath temple ruin followed the Solanki-style, which is Nagara architecture inspired by the Vesara ideas found in Western regions of India.

===Artwork===
The rebuilt temple as found in the ruined form in the 19th century and the current temple used recovered parts of previous temple with significant artwork. The new temple has added and integrated the new panels with a few old ones, the color of the stone distinguishing the two. The panels and pillars with historic artwork were and are found in the south and southwest side of the Somnath temple.

In general, the reliefs and sculpture is mutilated, to the point that it is difficult for most to &quot;identify the few images that remain&quot; on panels, states Cousens. An original Nataraja (Tandava Shiva), albeit with chopped arms and defaced, can be seen on the south side. A mutilated Nandi is to the right. To the left of this are traces of Shiva-Parvati, with the goddess seated in his lap. Towards the north-east corner, portions of panels in a band similar to &quot;Ramayana&quot; scenes in historic Hindu temples can be traced. Sections can be seen with &quot;beautiful vertical mouldings, on either side of the main front doorway&quot;, states Cousens, and this suggests that the destroyed temple was &quot;exceedingly richly carved&quot;. The temple likely had a galaxy of Vedic and Puranic deities, as one of the partially surviving relief shows Surya&#x27;s iconography – two lotuses in his hand.

The older temple featured an open plan, with great windows that allow light into the mandapa and circumambulation passage. The intricate and detailed artwork inside and on the pillars of Somnath temple were quite similar to those found in the Luna Vasahi temple at Mount Abu.

== Tirtha and festivals ==
The Somnath-Prabhasa &quot;tirtha&quot; has been one of the revered &quot;tirtha&quot; (pilgrimage) site for the Hindus. It is the famed Prabhasa site found in Brahmi script inscriptions in Maharashtra sites. It is mentioned in the poems of Kalidasa. The new temple is the top pilgrimage site in Gujarat along with Dwarka.

==Archaeological studies==
The Somnath temple site and coastline has been excavated for archaeological evidence by Indian teams. The first major excavation was completed in 1950–51 just before the Somnath temple was reconstructed. It was led by B. K. Thapar, one of the Director General of Archaeological Survey of India, and a report published. This Thapar study yielded direct and substantial evidence of a 10th-century or earlier large temple. B. K. Thapar estimated the older temple to be from the 9th century, while Dhaky states to more likely from the 10th century, i.e. from 960 to 973 CE. The Thapar study also found artifacts and ruins with ancient scripts such as Brahmi and later scripts such as proto-Nagari and Nagari, thus confirming the antiquity of Somnath-Patan through at least much of the 1st-millennium.

A few Somnath-Patan sites around the Somnath temple was excavated in the 1970s, led by M. K. Dhavalikar and Z. D. Ansari. They dug deeper at several locations, reported evidence of five periods of human settlement. In 1992, M. K. Dhavalikar and Gregory Possehl – an archaeologist known for his Indus Valley studies, reported their analysis of archaeological discoveries from Prabhas-Patan. According to them, the Somnath site shows evidence of ancient human settlement, from pre-2nd millennium BCE period. They date one period to &quot;pre-Harappan phase&quot;. However, these discoveries are all ceramics, wares and jewelry (amulet), and they found no ancient &quot;temple parts&quot;. According to Charles Herman&#x27;s critical review, the evidence available so far does not allow any direct inferences about the society and culture in pre-1st millennium BCE era, but there is persuasive evidence that Prabhas-Patan was an early Harappan site with sedentary farming and cattle keeping and it is in the same league of significance as the Dholavira (Kutch) and Rojdi (Sorath-Harappan) archaeological sites. Further, the Prabhas-Patan mounds that have been excavated show evidence of continued post-Harappan settlement (c. 2000– 1800 BCE) along with several other Saurashtra sites. According to Herman, the archaeological excavations in Prabhas-Patan and Saurashtra region have been too few to make systematic conclusions.

==Legacy==
===Iran===
The Somnath temple has inspired different narratives and legacies, for some a symbol of blessed conquest and victories, for some a symbol of fanatical intolerance and persecution. After the 1026 sack of the Somnath temple, states Mehrdad Shokoohy, the &quot;sack of Somnath was not just yet another campaign of a medieval Sultan confined to histories, but a symbol of the revival of Iranian identity boosted by religious zeal, which was to echo in literature and folklore&quot; for nearly one thousand years. The destruction of the Somnath temple – called &quot;Sūmanāt&quot; in Persian literature, and the killing of Hindus has been portrayed as a celebrated event in numerous versions of history, stories and poems found in Persia written over the centuries. The Persian literature has made mythical ahistorical connections of Somnath to Manat. The destruction of both has been celebrated by the Islamic scholars and elites.

===India===
On the Indian side, the Somnath temple has been more than another house of worship. For Hindus, particularly Hindu nationalists, it is a question of their heritage, their sense of sacred time and space, states Peter van der Veer. Its history raises questions of tolerance and spiritual values to expect, and of a symbol of fanaticism and foreign oppression. The Somnath temple has been leveraged to revisit India&#x27;s history and agitate over its sacred spaces including contested sites such as Ayodhya. Mahmud and Aurangzeb along with the ideology that inspired them are remembered as enemies of the ancient Hindu nation. They are asserted as two historical facts, the former as the first and the latter as the last systematic destroyers of Somnath temple.

The Somnath temple was used as a cultural symbol and the starting point for a Rath yatra (chariot journey), states K.N. Pannikkar, by Lal Krishna Advani to begin his Ayodhya campaign in 1990. According to Donald Smith, the reconstruction efforts in the 1950s was not about restoring an ancient architecture, rather the Somnath temple was of religious significance. The rebuilding was a symbol, it was Hindu repudiation of almost a thousand years of Muslim domination, oppression, and reassertion of a safe haven for Hindus in post-partitioned India.

The reconstructed Somnath temple has been the preferred pilgrimage site for Hindus in Gujarat, often combined with a pilgrimage to Dwarka. The site attracts Hindus from all over India, states David Sopher.

===Pakistan and West Asia===
In the modern era textbooks of Pakistan, the sack of Somnath temple is praised and the campaign of Sultan Mahmud of Ghaznavi is glorified as a &quot;champion of Islam&quot;. According to Syed Zaidi – a scholar of Islamist Militancy, a school book in Pakistan titled &quot;Our World&quot; portrays Somnath temple as a &quot;place where all the Hindu rajas used to get together&quot; and think about &quot;fighting the Muslims&quot;. Mahmud went to this temple and &quot;blew the idol in pieces&quot; and &quot;this success was a source of happiness for the whole Muslim world&quot;. Another textbook for Pakistan&#x27;s Middle School repeats a similar narrative, teaching its students that the Somnath temple was not really a Hindu temple but a political center. According to Ashok Behuria and Mohammad Shehzad, the Somnath legacy is narrated in this textbook as, &quot;according to most historians Mahmud invaded India seventeen times to crush the power of the Hindu Rajas and Maharajas who were always busy planning conspiracies against him ... After the fall of Punjab, the Hindus assembled at Somnath — which was more of a political centre than a temple — to plan a big war against Mahmud. He took all the Rajas and Maharajas by surprise when he attacked Somnath and crushed the Hindu headquarter of political intrigue. With the destruction of Somnath he broke the backbone of the Hindus in the region and thus had no need to attack India again&quot;.

In Islamic State nationalist literature of the modern era, Sultan Mahmud campaign in the 11th century has been glorified as a historic &quot;jihad against non-Muslims&quot;, his motive in destroying Somnath temple is described as &quot;not driven by worldly gain [wealth]&quot;, but because he wanted to &quot;end the worship of idols&quot;.

===Afghanistan===
In 1842, during the First Anglo-Afghan war, the Governor-General of India Lord Ellenborough ordered his troops to bring the wooden gates from the tomb of Mahmud of Ghazni in Ghazni, Afghanistan back to India; it was believed Mahmud had taken them from Somnath Temple. However, there was nor there is any evidence that Somnath temple or its site ever had any wooden gates. Nor is there any evidence that Mahmud or later conquerors ever took any gates from Prabhas-Patan region as a part of the plunder. This order has been called the Proclamation of the Gates. The order, states Thapar, is best seen as an example of how &quot;colonial intervention in India&quot; was viewed in the 1840s.

<text>The House of Tsereteli (), also known as Tsertelev (Russian), is a noble family in Georgia (and partly, a Russian noble family) which gave origin to several notable writers, politicians, scholars, and artists. 

== History ==
According to traditional accounts, the family&#x27;s ancestors had been chieftains in Dagestan or Ossetia, who fled the Islamization of their homeland by Tamerlane and moved, through Circassia, into Christian Georgia in 1395. Constantine II, King of Imereti (west Georgia) from 1392 to 1401, enfeoffed them of Sachkhere and conferred the dignity of prince (&quot;tavadi&quot;) upon them. The Tsereteli held a fiefdom in Upper Imereti called Satseretlo (საწერეთლო; &quot;of Tsereteli&quot;) with their residence at Modinakhe, and eventually turned into one of the preeminent aristocratic families in Georgia. They frequently intermarried with other Georgian noble houses and even with the branches of Bagrationi royal dynasty in both western and eastern Georgia (e.g., Prince David Tsereteli married the sister of Alexander V of Imereti in 1736, while Zurab Tsereteli married his daughter, Kethevan, to the royal prince Ioann of Georgia in 1787).

A branch of the family followed King Vakhtang VI of Kartli in his 1724 emigration to Imperial Russia, where they came to be known as Tsertelev (, Церетели) and were absorbed into the Russian nobility.

<doc id="1049105" wikidata="Q84199" url="?curid=1049105" title="Michael Haneke">
<text>Michael Haneke (; born 23 March 1942) is an Austrian film director and screenwriter. His work often examines social issues and depicts the feelings of estrangement experienced by individuals in modern society. Haneke has made films in French, German, and English and has worked in television and theatre. He also teaches film direction at the Film Academy Vienna.

Haneke&#x27;s first films were his &quot;glaciation&quot; trilogy, consisting of &quot;The Seventh Continent&quot; (1989), &quot;Benny&#x27;s Video&quot; (1992), and &quot;71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance&quot; (1994), each of which depict a &quot;coldly bureaucratic society in which genuine human relationships have been supplanted by a deep-seated collective malaise&quot; and explore &quot;the relationship among consumerism, violence, mass media, and contemporary alienation&quot;. He went on to win the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Grand Prix for &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; (2001) as well as its twice, for &quot;The White Ribbon&quot; (2009) and &quot;Amour&quot; (2012), the latter of which received five Academy Award nominations and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He also directed &quot;Funny Games&quot; (1997) and its 2007 remake, &quot;Code Unknown&quot; (2000), &quot;Time of the Wolf&quot; (2003), &quot;Caché&quot; (2005), and &quot;Happy End&quot; (2017).

== Early life and education ==
Haneke is the son of German actor and director and Austrian actress . His stepfather, the composer , later married the mother of actor Christoph Waltz. Haneke was raised in the city of Wiener Neustadt, Austria.

Haneke showed a strong interest in literature and music, but as an adolescent developed a &quot;downright contempt for any form of school&quot;. During this period of his life, he has later described himself as a &quot;rebel&quot;. He had ambitions of becoming an actor in his youth, later abandoning these plans after failing an entrance examination at the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna. He later attended the University of Vienna to study philosophy, psychology and drama. Not a committed student, he would spend most of his time attending local movie theatres. After leaving university, he began working odd jobs, before working as an editor and dramaturge at the southwestern German television station Südwestfunk from 1967 to 1970, a time during which he also worked as a film critic. He made his debut as a television director in 1974.

== Career ==
=== 1974–1988: Early work in television ===
Haneke started his career directing numerous television projects. He made his debut as a writer and director with the 1974 television movie &quot;After Liverpool&quot; starring and . The project originally started as a radio play. He then directed two more television films, &quot;Three Paths to the Lake&quot; (1976), about a war photo journalist who faces a moral crisis when she is forced to examine the implications of her work, and another telefilm &quot;Sperrmüll&quot; (1976). In 1979 he directed two episodes of &quot;Lemminge&quot; followed by &quot;Variation – oder Daß es Utopien gibt, weiß ich selber!&quot; (1983). In 1986 he directed &quot;Fraulein: A German Melodrama&quot; which was described as Haneke&#x27;s answer to Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Maria Braun&quot;. Haneke wanted to make a film about German history that doesn&#x27;t drown in self-pity and yet still attracts the public&quot;. A few years later he would make the experimental tele-documentary film &quot;Nachruf für einen Mörder&quot; about a young Austrian who provoked a hideous bloodbath in Vienna.

=== 1989–1997: Rise to prominence ===
Haneke&#x27;s feature film debut was 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Continent&quot;, which served to trace out the violent and bold style that would bloom in later years. The film chronicles the last years of an Austrian family played by Birgit Doll and Dieter Berner. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Despite being shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film it wasn&#x27;t nominated. Three years later he directed the controversial psychological horror film &quot;Benny&#x27;s Video&quot; (1992). The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival to positive reviews. It later won the FIPRESCI Award at the European Film Awards. The film showed at the New York Film Festival where Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the performances and Haneke writing, &quot;The film makes strong, if heavy-handed, points about the confusing effects of television violence&quot;. His third film in the trilogy is entitled, &quot;71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance&quot; (1994), Manohla Dargis&#x27;s The New York Times called it an &quot;An icy-cool study of violence both mediated and horribly real&quot;, adding &quot;For Mr. Haneke, the point seems less that evil is commonplace than that we don&#x27;t engage with it as thinking, actively moral beings. We slurp our soup while Sarajevo burns on the boob tube.&quot;

In 1997 he directed the television film &quot;The Castle&quot; (1997). The project is based of the Franz Kafka&#x27;s novel of the same name. The film starred Ulrich Mühe and Susanne Lothar. It premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival. Also that year he directed the feature film &quot;Funny Games&quot; (1997). The plot involves two young men who hold a family hostage and torture them with sadistic games in their vacation home. The film premiered at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote about his continuation of the examination of violence writing, &quot;Haneke is clearly more interested in the implications of violence than the acts themselves, and the psychological wallop they pack is strengthened by having most of the physical and emotional carnage played off-camera&quot;.

=== 2000–2009: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

He directed the French film &quot;Code Unknown&quot; (2000) starring Juliette Binoche. The film revolves around separates storylines which weave and intersect with each other. The film is inspired by the life of the French novelist and war reporter Olivier Weber. The film screened at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Haneke &quot;as a skillful, minutely observant filmmaker who trusts his audience to be able to put two and two together&quot; but adds &quot;Unfortunately, he&#x27;s often too cryptic, which leaves viewers still trying to make connections when they should already be reacting to the moral lessons implied by them.&quot; Haneke has directed a number of stage productions in German, which include works by Strindberg, Goethe, and Heinrich von Kleist in Berlin, Munich and Vienna.

Haneke achieved great success with the critically acclaimed French film &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; (2001). The film starred Isabelle Huppert as a sexually repressed piano teacher who soon becomes involved with a younger man. The film tackles subjects such as masochism, rape, incest, sexual repression, sexual violence, and the relationships between men and women. It premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival where it received rapturous reviews. It won the prestigious Grand Prize at the festival and also won its stars, Benoît Magimel and Huppert the Best Actor and Actress awards. David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;Haneke avoids the sensationalism of movie shockers, even high-class shockers like Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; and Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Repulsion&quot;. There are no expressionist moments in &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot;—no scenes of longing, no soft-focus dreams or cinematic dreck&quot;. Denby concluded, &quot;[the film] is a seriously scandalous work, beautifully made, and it deserves a sizable audience that might argue over it, appreciate it—even hate it.&quot;

A few years later he directed the dystopian drama &quot;Time of the Wolf&quot; (2003) starring Huppert. The film revolves around a family trying to find their way after a global cataclysm. The film received positive reviews with Scott Foundas of &quot;Variety Magazine&quot; writing, &quot;Haneke demonstrates profound insight into the essence of human behavior when all humility is pared away, raw panic and despair are the order of the day, and man becomes more like wolf than man.&quot; In 2005 Haneke reunited with Juliette Binoche in the psychological thriller &quot;Caché&quot; after she expressed interest in working with him. Haneke frequently worked with real-life couple Ulrich Mühe and Susanne Lothar – thrice each. The film opened the 2005 Cannes Film Festival to positive reviews. The film involves themes of collective guilt, collective memory and colonialism. He incorporated stories of the Paris massacre of 1961 into the film. Haneke won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director for the film. It was also included in the BBC&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.

In 2006 he gave his debut as an opera director, staging Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; for the Opéra National de Paris at Palais Garnier when the theater&#x27;s general manager was Gerard Mortier. With his next film &quot;The White Ribbon&quot; (2009) Haneke chose to shoot in black-and-white and in Germany. The film is set in 1913 and deals with strange incidents in a small town in Northern Germany, depicting an authoritarian, fascist-like atmosphere, where children are subjected to rigid rules and suffer harsh punishments, and where strange deaths occur. The film premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and won his first . It later won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and earned two Academy Award nominations for Best International Feature Film and Best Cinematography losing to &quot;The Secret in Their Eyes&quot; (2009) from Argentina and &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009). Critic Roger Ebert described the film as &quot;visual[ly] masterful&quot; adding, &quot;His films are like parables, teaching that bad things sometimes happen simply because they...happen. The universe laughs at man&#x27;s laws and does what it will.&quot;

=== 2012–present ===

In 2012, Haneke directed &quot;Amour&quot; starring Jean-Louis Trintignant, Emmanuelle Riva and Isabelle Huppert. The film revolves around an elderly couple aging together. The film premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and received the , Haneke&#x27;s second. Ella Tayor of NPR praised the film describing it as &quot;Touching and tragic&quot; adding &quot;Haneke implicates us in the full range of human capacity&quot;. The film also earned the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film with Haneke earning Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, the later nominations being the first of his career.

In 2012, he was to direct &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; for the New York City Opera. This production had originally been commissioned by Jürgen Flimm for the Salzburg Festival 2009, but Haneke had to resign due to an illness preventing him from preparing the work. Haneke realized this production at Madrid&#x27;s Teatro Real in 2013. In 2013, he was the subject of the documentary film &quot;Michael H – Profession: Director&quot;. That year, Haneke won the Prince of Asturias Award for the arts.

In 2017, for his twelfth film, &quot;Happy End&quot; Haneke reunited with Trintignant and Huppert. The film also starred Mathieu Kassovitz and Toby Jones. The film centers around a bourgeois French family dealing with a series of setbacks and crises. The film was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 70th Cannes Film Festival. The film received respectable reviews. Alissa Wilkinson of &quot;Vox&quot; described it as a commentary on &quot;the European refugee crisis and the pitfalls of privilege&quot;. Wilkinson added, &quot; challenges its audience to pay attention to put together the story, then, is as much an aesthetic statement about how to watch a movie as a political one. We have to observe and see what&#x27;s in the background. And that&#x27;s just what the family at the center of the movie doesn&#x27;t do, and what makes them civilized monsters — a proclivity they pass on through generations.&quot;

Haneke says that films should offer viewers more space for imagination and self-reflection. Films that have too much detail and moral clarity, Haneke says, are used for mindless consumption by their viewers. Haneke teaches film direction at the Film Academy Vienna. One of his students there was director Katharina Mückstein.

== Style and reception ==
Haneke is known for directing films which are often unsentimental and uses disturbing imagery to explore social critiques on issues such as class, race, gender, and violence. The Museum of Modern Art showcased his films in 2007 adding that they feature themes &quot;of alienation and social collapse; the exploitation and consumption of violence; the bourgeois family as the incubator of fascistic impulse; individual responsibility and collective guilt; and the ethics of the photographic image&quot;. He is also known for his use of the long take rather than relying on quick edits or fast paced editing. Haneke prefers to let his scenes unfold slowly, allowing the audience to fully experience the tension and emotion of each moment. This creates a sense of intimacy for the audience to draw them into a scene. He also uses static shots, ambiguous endings, meta-narratives, and silence. Haneke also has collaborated with Isabelle Huppert and Juliette Binoche on numerous films.

== Favourite films ==
In 2012, Haneke participated in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll and submitted these films as his favorite.

<doc id="1049111" wikidata="Q13479593" url="?curid=1049111" title="Transport in Milan">
<text>[[Milan]] has an extensive internal transport network and is also an important transportation node in Italy, being one of the country&#x27;s biggest hubs for air, rail and road networks. 
Internal public transport network includes the Metro, the Suburban Railway, the tram and bus network, as well as taxi, car and bike sharing services.

==History==
Early public transport service in Milan dates back to 1801, operated with horse-drawn carriages. After the relocation of the capital of the Italian Kingdom to Milan in 1805, national and international transport services were inaugurated, all operated with carriages, to Vienna, Marseille and several Italian cities.
Transport via the Navigli canals was also an important transport mode in that period.

The first bus line was opened in 1827, connecting Milan to Lodi. The first railway, to Monza, was inaugurated in 1840. It is currently part of the Milan-Chiasso international railway.

==Public transportation==
===Metro===
The Milan Metro is a rapid transit system, running mainly underground, serving Milan and other surrounding cities. The network consists of 5 lines, identified by different colors and numbers:
Milan Metro has a total length of , serving 135 stations, making it the longest metro network in Italy. The system carries about 1.15 million passengers per day.

=== Suburban rail ===

The suburban railway service consists of 12 lines connecting Milan to the greater metropolitan area:
The system was brought together from existing lines and the construction of the new &quot;Passante&quot;, an underground railway line passing through the city. The service began operation in 2004 and now comprises 124 stations. Several extensions are planned.

===Trams===
The Tram network comprises 17 urban lines. The system is more than 170 km long and is the biggest network in Italy.

The Milan tram network dates back to 1876, when the first horse driven tram line began operation. In 1878 the first steam powered tram was launched and by 1901 all the lines were electric powered. In 1910 line numbers were first introduced. At that time the network was already consisting of 30 lines. Until 1917 the tram system was operated by several different companies, however, since that year the municipality took control over the whole network.

In the 1920s the famous Class 1500 streetcars were introduced. Many of them, restored, are still in use today.

Beginning from the late 1950s and until the end of the 1970s the tram network was reduced, being replaced in some areas by the new Metro lines or by bus lines.

===Buses===

There are 64 bus and 4 trolleybus lines in Milan. Most of the routes do not run during the night, however, bus services on demand are available in the weekend at night.

New night bus lines during weekends have been introduced since 24 September 2011, running from 2 am to 6 am on Fridays and Saturdays. The new network was considered a success, with more than 8,000 people using the lines every weekend.







===Public transport statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Milan on a weekday is 64 min. 
14% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. 
The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. 
The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7.7 km, while 14% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

==National and international rail==
Milan is one of the most important hubs for the national and international rail network in Italy. Milan Central station is the second station in Italy both for size and passengers after Rome. It is also the main node for high-speed rail lines in northern Italy. Milano Cadorna and Milano Porta Garibaldi stations are respectively the seventh and the eleventh busiest stations in Italy. Because of its position, Milan is also the main gateway for international passenger traffic to Europe. Daily international destinations include Bern, Lugano, Geneva, Zürich, Paris, Nice, Marseille, Vienna, Barcelona and Munich.

Milan is also the core of Lombardy&#x27;s regional train network. Regional trains were operated on two different systems by LeNord (departing from Milano Cadorna) and Trenitalia (departing from Milan Centrale and Milano Porta Garibaldi). Beginning in 2011, a new company, Trenord, operates both Trenitalia and LeNord regional trains in Lombardy.

==Roads==
Milan is a key node for the Italian road network, being the junction between the east-west A4 highway to Turin and Venice and the north-south A1 highway to Rome and Naples. Other important highways, such as the A7 to Genova and the A8-A9 to Switzerland, also serve the city. Highways reaching Milan are linked together by a ring road formed by the 3 &quot;tangenziali&quot; (the A50, A51 and A52) and part of the A4 highway, with a total length of over 100 km around the city.
Milan road system is characterized by a high rate of traffic congestion, due to a high level of cars per capita and a high number of commuters in the metropolitan area. Congested traffic is also responsible for the high pollution rate in the Milan area. Counter measures included the partial ban of private cars inside the Milan urban area for some period, usually during Sundays. 
In 2008, a traffic pollution charge for vehicles entering the city, Ecopass, was introduced.
The program resulted in a lower proportion of highly polluting vehicles on the roads in the city. However, the program progressively lost effectiveness as the city&#x27;s vehicle fleet got greener. 
Since 16 January 2012 a new program, Area C, was introduced as a congestion charge (as opposed to the previous pollution charge), thus targeting any private vehicle entering Milan city center.
Although high by European standards, Milan is one of the big cities with the lowest number of motor vehicles per capita in Italy, with 543 per 1000 people in 2011, reduced to around 495 per 1000 as of 2021.

===Car sharing===

Several car-sharing systems are active in the city. &quot;GuidaMi&quot;, the first scheme, is managed by ATM and comprises 132 vehicles and about 5,500 registered users. Car2go was activated in August 2013 and has a fleet of 700 cars and more than 50,000 registered users. 
Other services include &quot;E-vai&quot; from Trenord, DriveNow from BMW, Twist and Enjoy from Eni.
In 2015 the Chinese automaker ZD introduced its Sharen&#x27;go electric car-sharing service to Milan, making it the first city outside the company&#x27;s native China where the service was available.

Car sharing in Milan serves about 0.5% of the total mobility of the city, and with 323,000 users, as of June 2016 it is the Italian city with the largest number of car sharing customers.

===Cycling===

The city&#x27;s mostly flat topography favors cycling. The cycle routes network is still limited, but is being constantly expanded. Milan was also one of the first Italian cities to activate a bike sharing system.

==Airports==

Milan&#x27;s airport system is the second busiest in Italy, after that of Rome. The city is served by three major airports: Malpensa Airport, the biggest in northern Italy; Linate Airport, located near the city centre and mainly used for domestic traffic; and Orio al Serio Airport, located in the neighbouring city of Bergamo, used mainly by low-cost airlines. Combined, these three airports transported a total of 43 million passengers in 2017. Milano Bresso, operated by Aero Club Milano, is a minor general aviation airport.

The three major airports are connected by bus to the city center. In addition, Malpensa has a direct rail connection to central railway stations in Milan (notably Centrale, Garibaldi and Cadorna) via the Malpensa Express service. Thanks to Metro line 4, Linate airport also gained a fixed rail connection to Milan city center and will reach the city&#x27;s south-western districts once the line is finished. Orio al Serio airport will instead be connected to the nearby city of Bergamo via a railway line that is projected to be finished by 2026; from Bergamo main station, trains will be able to reach the stations of Milano Centrale in less than an hour and Milano Porta Garibaldi.

<text>Raúl Díaz Arce (born February 1, 1970) is a Salvadoran former professional footballer who played as a forward. He is El Salvador&#x27;s most prolific goal scorer, with 39 goals in just 68 appearances.

==Playing career==

From 1985 to 1986, Arce played for Deportivo Jalapa in Guatemala. From 1988 to 1991, Arce played for Dragon in the Salvadoran second division, where he was the league&#x27;s leading scorer in the 1991–92 season with 21 goals. Playing for Dragon, in two seasons in first division, &quot;Ignacio Raul&quot; scored 34 goals (13 in 1989–90 and 21 in 1990–91), in the second season he was the scoring champion of the regular season when he played four laps.

He then moved up to play for C.D. Luis Ángel Firpo of the Salvadoran first division from 1991 to 1996. Here he was the league&#x27;s top scorer three season in a row (1993–1996) with 24, 21 and 25 goals, respectively. In Luis Ángel Firpo he scored in five seasons with a total of 119 goals. These early achievements earned him a spot in the national team and a move to the United States.

===D.C. United===
In 1996, Diaz Arce signed with Major League Soccer, and was drafted tenth overall in the MLS Inaugural Player Draft by D.C. United on February 6. On April 20, Diaz Arce recorded the first goal in D.C. United&#x27;s history when he scored in the 7th minute against the LA Galaxy. He quickly established himself as a dangerous striker in the league, scoring 23 goals in his first season with United, second in the league behind Roy Lassiter. Diaz Arce was also the first player in MLS history to score a hat-trick in postseason play. He scored 3 against the Tampa Bay Mutiny on October 10, 1996. DC United won 4-1 and went on to become the first MLS champions. Diaz Arce continued to perform well in his second season, registering 15 goals, and helping D.C. United to win their second consecutive MLS Cup. 

===New England Revolution===
Salary cap pressures and reported conflicts between Diaz Arce and Marco Etcheverry, resulted in D.C. trading one of the league&#x27;s most prolific scorers to the New England Revolution. The deal was not well-received by D.C. United&#x27;s fanbase.

On February 5, 1998, in what would become the first three-team trade in MLS history, New England acquired Diaz Arce from D.C. United in exchange
for Alexi Lalas and a second-round pick in the 1999 MLS College Draft, which were traded to the MetroStars
with the MetroStars’ second-round pick in the 1999 MLS College Draft and future considerations going to D.C. United along with New England’s first-round pick in
the 1999 MLS College Draft. Diaz Arce made his Revolution debut in the first match of a season, a loss to his former club, on March 29, 1998. He scored his first Revolution goal the following match, in a 2-1 defeat to the Miami Fusion on April 4. Diaz Arce made his Revolution home debut on April 18, providing an assist in a 1-1 draw against D.C. United in front of a crowd of 24,133 at Foxboro Stadium. The Revolution would lose the subsequent shoot out.

Diaz Arce&#x27;s success continued in New England. In the 1998 New England Revolution season, he started all 32 league matches, leading the team in minutes played and games played. He was named the Revolution&#x27;s 1998 scoring champion, notching 18 goals and recording 8 assists. His 18 goal tally was the highest in a single season in club history for a Revs player - a record that would stand for four more seasons, until it was broken by Taylor Twellman in 2002. He represented New England in the 1998 MLS All-Star Game alongside his teammate Mike Burns.

On January 20, 1999, the Revolution traded Diaz Arce to the MetroStars in return for Giovanni Savarese and a second-round pick in the 2000 MLS SuperDraft.

===End of MLS career===
Nevertheless, Diaz Arce was traded again, and eventually played for the Tampa Bay Mutiny and San Jose Clash, as well as briefly with the MetroStars, registering 13 goals and 7 assists in the 1999 season. Diaz Arce continued to be shuttled around in 2000, playing for Tampa Bay and D.C. again in 2000, and scoring a career low 9 goals. Diaz Arce continued to decline in 2001, playing only briefly for D.C. United, before being traded again to the Colorado Rapids, with whom he ended his career in MLS.

Diaz Arce left MLS second in career goals scored with 82, behind only Roy Lassiter; although he has fallen as others have surpassed both of their totals.

===Charleston &amp; Puerto Rico===
For the 2002 season, Diaz Arce played for the Charleston Battery of the A-League, scoring 6 goals and 4 assists in 1319 minutes. He was not the success Charleston had hoped for, however, and left following the year. In 2004, Diaz Arce joined the struggling expansion Puerto Rico Islanders, and gave the team a significant boost, scoring two goals in his first game and a total of 7 in 1233 minutes, and helping the team attain a level of respectability. He is now the U.S. Soccer Development Academy Director at the Chicago Magico Soccer Club.

==International career==
Diaz Arce made his debut for El Salvador in an April 1991 UNCAF Nations Cup qualification match against Nicaragua in which he scored two goals. Over his career, he earned a total of 68 caps, scoring a record 39 goals. He represented his country in 28 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at several UNCAF Nations Cups as well as at the 1996 and 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cups.
His final international was a September 2000 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Honduras.

<doc id="1049114" wikidata="Q3411006" url="?curid=1049114" title="Push-pull configuration">
<text>An aircraft constructed with a push-pull configuration has a combination of forward-mounted tractor (pull) propellers, and backward-mounted (pusher) propellers.

==Historical==
The earliest known examples of &quot;push-pull&quot; engined-layout aircraft was the Short Tandem Twin.

An early pre-World War I example of a &quot;push-pull&quot; aircraft was the Caproni Ca.1 of 1914 which had two wing-mounted tractor propellers and one centre-mounted pusher propeller. Around 450 of these and their successor, the Ca.3 were built. One of the first to employ two engines on a common axis (tandem push-pull) was the one-off, ill-fated Siemens-Schuckert DDr.I fighter of 1917.

German World War I designs included the only Fokker twin-engined design of the period, the Fokker K.I from 1915; followed by the unusual Siemens-Schuckert DDr.I triplane fighter design of late 1917, and concluding with the laterally-offset &quot;push-pull&quot; Gotha G.VI bomber prototype of 1918. 

Claudius Dornier embraced the concept, many of his flying boats using variations of the tandem &quot;push-pull&quot; engine layout, including the 1922 Dornier Wal, the 1938 Dornier Do 26, and the massive 1929 Dornier Do X, which had twelve engines driving six tractors and six pushers. A number of Farmans and Fokkers also had push-pull engine installations, such as the Farman F.121 Jabiru and Fokker F.32.

==Configuration==
Push-pull designs have the engines mounted above the wing as Dornier flying boats or more commonly on a shorter fuselage than conventional one, as for Rutan Defiant or Voyager canard designs. Twin boomers such as the Cessna Skymaster and Adam A500 have the aircraft&#x27;s tail suspended via twin booms behind the pusher propeller. In contrast, both the World War II-era Dornier Do 335 and the early 1960s-designed French Moynet M 360 Jupiter experimental private plane had their pusher propeller behind the tail.

==Design benefits==
While pure pushers decreased in popularity during the First World War, the push-pull configuration has continued to be used. The advantage it provides is the ability to mount two propellers on the aircraft&#x27;s centreline, thereby avoiding the increased drag that comes with twin wing-mounted engines. It is also easier to fly if one of the two engines fails, as the thrust provided by the remaining engine stays in the centerline. In contrast, a conventional twin-engine aircraft will yaw in the direction of the failed engine and become uncontrollable below a certain airspeed, known as VMC.

==Design problems==
The rear engine operates in the disturbed air from the forward engine, which may reduce its efficiency to 85% of the forward engine. In addition the rear engine can interfere with the aircraft&#x27;s rotation during takeoff if installed in the tail, or they require additional compromise to be made to ensure clearance. This is why they are more common on seaplanes, where this is not a concern.

==Piloting==
Pilots in the United States who obtain a multi-engine rating in an aircraft with this push-pull, or &quot;centerline thrust,&quot; configuration are restricted to flying centerline-thrust aircraft; pilots who obtain a multi-engine rating in conventional twin-engine aircraft do not have a similar limitation with regard to centerline-thrust aircraft. The limitation can be removed by further testing in a conventional multi-engine aircraft.

==Military application==
Despite its advantages push-pull configurations are rare in military aircraft. In addition to the problems noted for civil aircraft, the increased risk to the pilot in the case of a crash or the need to parachute from the aircraft also pose problems. During a crash the rear engine may crush the pilot and if bailing out, the pilot is in danger of hitting the propeller. Examples of past military applications include the aforementioned Siemens-Schuckert DDr.I twin-engined triplane and the Gotha G.VI, with its engines mounted on the front and rear ends of two separate fuselages. More successful was the Italian Caproni Ca.3 trimotor, with two tractor engines and one pusher. Between the wars, most push-pull aircraft were flying boats, of which the Dornier Wal was probably the most numerous, while a number of heavy bombers, such as the Farman F.220 used engines mounted in push-pull pairs under the wings. Near the end of World War II, the German Dornier Do 335 push-pull twin-engined, &quot;Zerstörer&quot;-candidate heavy fighter featured explosive charges to jettison the rear propeller and dorsal tailfin, a manually-jettisonable main canopy, as well as an ejection seat. One of the last military aircraft to use the configuration was the American Cessna O-2, which was used for forward air control during the Vietnam War.

<doc id="1049118" wikidata="Q3519484" url="?curid=1049118" title="River Thame">
<text>The River Thame is a river in Southern England. A tributary of the River Thames, the river runs generally south-westward for about from its source above the Buckinghamshire town of Aylesbury to the Thames in south-east Oxfordshire.

==Course==
Three streams which rise within the Vale of Aylesbury, on the northwest side of the Chiltern Hills, join to form the River Thame to the east of the small village of Hulcott, north of Aylesbury. The first of the river form the boundary between Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. The Thame played a key role in the English Civil War when John Hampden (the town&#x27;s Member of Parliament) led the force of Parliamentarians successfully defending Aylesbury at the Battle of Holman&#x27;s Bridge, where a small road crosses the river, in 1642.

The river passes by the 21st century small suburb of Watermead and around the north and west of Aylesbury, passing through farmland to the villages of Nether Winchendon and Chearsley before reaching the market town of Thame with which it shares its name. Thame is about east of Oxford and grew from an Anglo-Saxon settlement beside the river. In Anglo-Saxon England, Thame is a recorded place in records of the Diocese of Dorchester.

At Holton mill the Thame turns southward and after passing the villages of Great Milton and Stadhampton, its valley widens. In this area in 1642 and 1643, the river acted as a line of defence for Royalist Oxford. The bridges at Wheatley, Cuddesdon Mill and Chiselhampton were key crossing points, with Chiselhampton Bridge playing a critical part in Prince Rupert&#x27;s movements before and after the Battle of Chalgrove Field.

==Confluence with the Thames==
Finally the Thame reaches the village of Dorchester on Thames, Oxfordshire. As the suffix -chester indicates, a Romano-British settlement was on the site. The small town&#x27;s central streets are typically Anglo-Saxon, being not quite straight and set at various angles. The Saxon cathedral here was superseded by Dorchester Abbey, so-called since the English Reformation—-the name denotes its surviving structure, which was its main building, the abbey church. That church, built in 1170, is in length and is a listed building at Grade I.

In the far south of that parish, south of the town centre, the Thame flows into the River Thames, between Day&#x27;s Lock and Benson Lock.

The upper River Thames has an alternative name, the Isis, up to the point where it reaches this confluence.

<text>Charles Bernard Spencer (1909 – 1963) was an English poet, translator, and editor.

He was born in Madras, India and educated at Marlborough College and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. At Marlborough he knew John Betjeman and Louis MacNeice; at Oxford Stephen Spender, Arthur Calder-Marshall, Isaiah Berlinand he also came across W. H. Auden. He edited &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot; in 1930-1931. He was not, however, drawn far into what was soon known as the Auden Group; he is identified much more with the type of poetry later exemplified by Lawrence Durrell, and is for some critics the stand-out in the Cairo poets. His potential was never quite fulfilled, partly because of poor health.

After graduation, he made a living from teaching and writing, marrying the actress Norah Gibbs in 1936. At that time he was collaborating on Geoffrey Grigson&#x27;s &quot;New Verse&quot;. In World War II he worked for the British Council, in Greece and then Egypt. There he edited the &quot;Personal Landscape&quot; magazine.

After the war he continued to work for the British Council, being posted to Italy. Norah died in 1947, of tuberculosis. He himself was ill for a time. Through other postings he wrote little.

He was married again in 1961, to Anne Marjoribanks by whom he had a son Piers in 1963. He died in Vienna, apparently in an accident, while once more in bad health.

A conference on Spencer&#x27;s life and work was held at the University of Reading in October 2009, with an exhibition of manuscripts and other personal effects. His &quot;Complete Poetry, Translations and Selected Prose&quot; edited by Peter Robinson was published by Bloodaxe Books in February 2011.

<doc id="1049126" wikidata="Q5522265" url="?curid=1049126" title="Garden Island (New South Wales)">
<text>Garden Island is an inner-city locality of Sydney, Australia, and the location of a major Royal Australian Navy (RAN) base. It is located to the north-east of the Sydney central business district and juts out into Port Jackson, immediately to the north of the suburb of Potts Point. Used for government and naval purposes since the earliest days of the colony of Sydney, it was originally a completely-detached island but was joined to the Potts Point shoreline by major land reclamation work during World War II.

Today, Garden Island forms a major part of the RAN&#x27;s Fleet Base East. It includes active dockyards (including the Captain Cook Graving Dock), naval wharves and a naval heritage and museum precinct. Approximately half of the major fleet units of the RAN use the wharves as their home port.

The northern tip of Garden Island is open to the public and formerly contained the Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre museum, which was closed permanently in 2021, and an outdoor heritage precinct. Immediately south and above Garden Island on the Potts Point ridgeline is HMAS &quot;Kuttabul&quot;, the RAN&#x27;s major administrative, training and logistics support establishment for the Sydney area. Although HMAS &quot;Kuttabul&quot; is administratively a separate facility to Garden Island, the two names are often referred to interchangeably.

==Geography==
Garden Island was originally an island in Sydney Harbour, but extension of the base and the construction of a dry dock in the channel between the island and the mainland have resulted in its connection to the mainland shore at Potts Point from the 1940s. The wharves of the naval base now stretch the length of the eastern side of Woolloomooloo Bay, from the suburb of Woolloomooloo to the end of the original island.

==History==
&#x27;Bayinguwa&#x27; is the First Nations name for a small island at the end of Woolloomooloo Bay in Port Jackson Harbour.- It was renamed Garden Island in 1788 after it was planted in the first months of European settlement in Australia, to serve as a kitchen-garden by officers and crew of the First Fleet vessel . Initials carved into a sandstone rock on the site are believed to be the oldest colonial graffiti in Australia, comprising the letters &quot;FM 1788,&quot; representing Frederick Meredith who served as &quot;Sirius&quot;″ steward. On 7 September 1811, ownership of Garden Island was declared to have transferred to the Governor&#x27;s estate with produce dedicated for the exclusive use of Government House. The transfer had practical effect but due to an administrative error it was not formally registered, leaving the land in the legal ownership of the Navy, which successfully sought its return in 1866.

Sandstone fortifications, built on the island during the 1820s to protect Sydney from a much-feared Russian attack, also survive. Garden Island also boasts what is claimed to be Australia&#x27;s first lawn tennis court. Built in 1880, it is still in use, although the lawn was replaced in 1960.

===Captain Cook Graving Dock===
Prior to World War II, the nearest sizable naval graving dock was at Singapore Naval Base; an round trip for a potentially damaged warship. Consequently, in 1938, the Australian cabinet approved the idea of building a large naval graving dock. The cost of construction was predicted at around A£3 million. A far cheaper alternative, a second-hand floating drydock being sold by Southern Railway was considered early on. Despite the A£175,000 cost, the acquisition was opposed by Admiral Ragnar Colvin, as it would be expensive and difficult to maintain, would be unable to accommodate the draught of ships being acquired for the RAN, and would be incredibly risky to tow from England to Australia. Three sites were considered (one in Adelaide, and two in Sydney Harbour: Potts Point or near the Sydney Harbour Bridge), with Potts Point chosen as the cheapest location. The dock itself was built by the reclamation of of land, connecting Garden Island to the mainland.

By September 1944, work had been completed to the stage where initial flooding tests could occur. On 2 March 1945, the British aircraft carrier underwent an emergency docking: although the drydock was not due to open for another three weeks, the advanced state of building made the docking possible. The Captain Cook Graving Dock was formally opened by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester in his role as the Governor-General of Australia, with the ribbon cutting performed by the bow of the frigate . During the first year of operations, the drydock received the British battleship ; the 45,360-ton displacement warship is the largest vessel to use the dock.
The dock is long, with a width of . The dock is deep at spring tide. When filled, the dock has a capacity of . The dock can be drained in a four-hour period through the use of three centrifugal pumps (each with a discharge capacity around per minute).

===Hammerhead crane===

The hammerhead crane was built between 1944 and 1951 on the Fitting Out Wharf at Garden Island. The electrically powered crane had a radius of and a total height of . The electrical and mechanical equipment was sourced from England, while the steel frame was fabricated in Sydney. Although officially declared completed in January 1952, the crane was operational from March 1951. The crane&#x27;s primary purpose was the removal and installation of warship gun turrets, although it was regularly used for other machinery and loads, and had a lifting capacity of up to . It was last used in 1996.

In August 2013, the Federal Government announced the removal of the hammerhead crane, at an estimated cost of $10.3 million. Other options, such as preserving the crane as a heritage structure and tourist attraction, restoring it to working order, or converting it to a new purpose, were ruled out due to cost and the risk to security at the naval base. The removal was also seen as necessary to free up wharf space for the &quot;Canberra&quot;-class amphibious warfare ships. The Hammerhead Crane was the largest crane in the southern hemisphere on completion, and as of 2005, was still the largest crane in Australia. At the time of its demolition, it was only 15 cranes of that style worldwide. Removal was completed by November 2014, with some components preserved for heritage purposes.

===Tunnel system===

There is a tunnel system under Garden Island that was once used by the Royal Australian Navy. Within this tunnel system was a power station, offices and air raid shelters. This tunnel complex also had a command centre. Other tunnels also exist which headed further in towards Kings Cross. The island also has a pit that was built in the 1800s and was used as a storage facility in case the island was ever attacked. The entrance to this pit has now been sealed.

==Current usage==
===Dockyard===
The dockyard facilities are today leased to and operated by the defence contractor Thales Australia, a part of the international Thales Group. They are used to service naval and civilian vessels.

===Wharves===

The various wharves that line Garden Island remain under the control of the navy and are used as the home port facilities for about half the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s major ships. The wharves on the western side of the island have sufficient depth of water to berth the largest United States Navy aircraft carriers.

===Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre===
The Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre was opened in 2005 and is the official museum of the Royal Australian Navy. It is located in the Public Access Precinct of Garden Island: a section at the northern end of the island opened in 2002 that includes several heritage buildings and structures, historical relics, and naval monuments. The museum&#x27;s exhibits include the conning tower from one of the Japanese midget submarines that attacked Sydney Harbour in 1942. The heritage precinct is isolated from the mainland by the naval and dockyard facilities, with public access limited to the Sydney Ferries service between Circular Quay and Double Bay, with the Garden Island ferry wharf at the north end of the island. Private pre-booked bus groups are allowed to transit through the naval base and dockyard to the heritage precinct under strict conditions.

===Other facilities===
Various workshops and other buildings on the island are under the control of the nearby HMAS &quot;Kuttabul&quot; naval base and are used for training and other logistical purposes.

==Proposed future usage==
Since 2000 the global cruising industry has been building a number of very large ships, some of which were too large to berth at the Overseas Passenger Terminal at Circular Quay, although modifications were made in 2014 to accommodate some larger vessels. Some large ships are permitted to berth at Garden Island&#x27;s naval wharves, initially on an ad-hoc basis, followed in 2012 by an agreement to permit three cruise ships to berth per year. There have been calls for increased cruise ship access to the naval wharves, with some suggesting that the RAN should relocate entirely. Replacing the naval base with a cruise ship terminal would also free up the island to be redeveloped as harbourfront residential housing.

The RAN and the Department of Defence have opposed these proposals due to the security risks and loss of capability the increased civilian presence would bring, and the enormous cost of replicating the existing capability at a new location (a 2013 defence white paper estimated a cost of over $6 billion, although naval personnel stated that this did not include the creation of support facilities like the graving dock, or relocating supporting companies and industries like Thales). Most of the potential locations for a replacement base would require large-scale, ongoing dredging works to allow access to large naval ships, and have narrow access channels which could be easily blocked in wartime.

==Historic buildings and structures==
The first naval buildings on the site were minor structures, but in the 1880s the Admiralty (with financial incentives from the Government of New South Wales) began to invest more heavily in the site as a base for the Royal Navy in the southern hemisphere. A number of sizeable buildings were constructed (several designed by James Barnet) providing accommodation, office space, stores of various kinds and a sizeable steam engineering factory. These were later taken over by the Royal Australian Navy, and most remain in use today.

<doc id="1049134" wikidata="Q14934970" url="?curid=1049134" title="Parramatta Road">
<text>Parramatta Road is the major historical east-west artery of metropolitan Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, connecting the Sydney CBD with Parramatta. It is the easternmost part of the Great Western Highway. Since the 1990s its role has been augmented by the City West Link and M4 Motorway.

The road begins in the east as a continuation of George Street, which becomes Broadway west of Harris Street, and Parramatta Road west of the City Road junction, and ends at the junction with Church Street in Parramatta. Its distance is dominated by caryards and small marginally-viable shops. At the same time, however, it has over 100 abandoned and derelict stores. Owing to this and its abrasively noisy traffic, it has rarely been considered beautiful.

Opened in 1811, it is one of Sydney&#x27;s oldest roads and Australia&#x27;s first road between two cities (before Sydney and Parramatta coalesced). As at 2015, over three million commuters every year drove Parramatta Road. The road is the hub of Sydney&#x27;s motor dealership industry - with 67% of the adjacent land used for motor retailing and services.

British settlement in Parramatta began in the same year (1788) as it did in Sydney. The Parramatta River was used as navigation between them. Sometime between 1789 and 1791 an overland track was made to provide an official land route between the two settlements.

Parramatta Road dates to the 1792 formation of a route linking Sydney to the settlement of Parramatta. This route was formalised under the direction of Surveyor–General Augustus Alt in 1797. Parramatta Road became one of the colony&#x27;s most important early roads, and for many years remained one of Sydney&#x27;s principal thoroughfares.
The early road was a poorly built and poorly maintained track through bush. In 1794, the governor of the colony reported that he had caused a very good road to be made, but there is no evidence that any bridges were built over the streams. The road subsequently deteriorated and on 9 June 1805 the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot; reported that the road was impassable as the result of heavy rain. Attempts to improve the road continued over the years.

===1810–1815===
By 1811, Parramatta Road had officially opened to traffic and was financed during a large portion of the 19th century by a toll, with toll booths located at what now is Sydney University and the Duck River. Governor Macquarie called tenders for the repair of the road, raised a three shilling per gallon levy on spirits and levied a toll to pay for the work. The road was to be 10 metres wide. This turnpike road was opened on 10 April 1811. The toll barriers were at the present Railway Square and at Becket&#x27;s Creek (near Parramatta).

In 1814, a stage cart service was established along Parramatta Road. Fares were 10 shillings for passengers and 3 pence for letters. Heavy rain again nearly destroyed this road, so in 1817 it was announced that all tree-stumps would be removed and the road paved with stone which would be covered with earth and gravel. This improvement was announced as finished on 15 January 1815.

In 1815 the &quot;profit&quot; from the Sydney toll reached £465. The growth of Sydney caused the toll barrier to be moved to Grose Farm (present University of Sydney) in April 1836. In 1839 it was moved further west to Annandale.

===1820s–1880s===

The colony&#x27;s first stage coach (valued at £300) was imported in 1821 but did not begin regular service until 1823. The stage left the city at 7:00 am, arrived in Parramatta at 9:30 am and left Parramatta for the return journey at 4:00 pm. Inside passengers were charged six shillings. Hazards on the road included the threat of attacks by Indigenous people and bushrangers. Hotels and settlements sprang up along the road to serve coaching traffic.

The importance of the road declined with the advent of the Sydney-Parramatta railway in 1855. In 1883, a steam tram line opened along Parramatta Road as far as Annandale, and was extended onward to Norton Street in 1884, where it turned to run along Norton Street to Short Street.

In the 1800s, the government acquired a strip of land from Ashfield to Burwood from the Rosebank Estate, owned by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan, Australia&#x27;s first religious congregation. Rosebank College now stands on the former Rosebank Estate, and the heritage-listed building of the private school stands adjacent to the road at Five Dock.

===1900s–present: Motorisation===
Sydney Municipal Council began widening the major routes into the city centre in 1911, including the construction of Broadway and the widening of the cutting on Parramatta Road adjacent to Sydney University. In the 1920s, the road was sealed and tramlines were removed from the road. Sheep and cattle were still crossing Parramatta Road at Homebush as late as the 1960s.

Increased traffic congestion along the road steadily made it less attractive for residential and commercial use during the 20th century. By the last quarter of the 20th century, the only active businesses on many stretches of the road were car dealerships. The decline of industry in the Inner West also drove the decline of commercial areas formerly catering to factory workers. By the end of the 20th century, proposals to revitalise Parramatta Road and make it more attractive were regularly made.

One of these proposals was made in 2012, which would have widened and lowered the road below street level in a &quot;slot&quot; as part of the Roads &amp; Maritime Services WestConnex motorway proposal. This plan was abandoned, and the WestConnex proposal was later changed to a pair of tunnels parallel to Parramatta Road and connecting to the existing M4 motorway. The new extension was known as M4 East and was eventually built between the end of the existing M4 motorway in North Strathfield and Haberfield, where it connected to the A4 road. The new tunnels opened to traffic in July 2019. The project resulted in the creation of a new entry and exit ramp on Parramatta Road in Ashfield, the narrowing of westbound traffic lanes for through-traffic to one lane at either end of the tunnel, and the demolition of a large number of houses in Ashfield and Haberfield to make way for the tunnel ramps.

==Criticism==
The road has been criticised by the community for its traffic pollution, congestion, and for its vacant shops and rundown buildings, particularly between Leichhardt and Concord, and local government has been accused of failing to adopt policies to encourage the redevelopment and regeneration of vacant sites.

A local mayor described it as a &quot;varicose vein&quot;. A NSW Business Chamber Executive Patricia Forsythe said that the road is &quot;one of the least attractive commercial areas of Sydney&quot;. Former NSW premier Nick Greiner thought the road looked &quot;like Beirut on a bad day&quot;. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; writer Elizabeth Farrelly described it as &quot;filthy, noisy, sclerotic and dull&quot;. On a lighter note, Tess De Quincey, an Australian performer/director said, &quot;Every chapter of Sydney&#x27;s history has been written on Parramatta Road.&quot; A Sydney Morning Herald editor said that whilst the road is &quot;ugly in parts, drab in others, and generally unpleasant&quot;, it is still &quot;fundamental to the economic and social viability of the greater city&quot;.

Since the 1970s many buildings fronting Parramatta Road, especially those in the prime locations of the Inner West (from Newtown to Homebush), have become vacant and fallen into disrepair, with many vandalised. Previously these buildings were a major part of local life for the suburbs along Parramatta Road, providing employment, retailing and other services. The buildings with graffiti and broken windows provide a sight that is sought out by graffiti vandals and proficient urban photographers.

Nicholas Munning, an owner of a music store in Annandale, described the road as, &quot;A lost cause...You can see the hodgepodge of buildings - abandoned buildings, abandoned shops - [with people thinking] let’s just let this sit here for four years until we get council approval to knock it down and build apartments...They don’t care if it sits there vacant with broken windows and looks like shit, The problem is the whole road looks like that. So nobody is going to say, &#x27;hey, this is a great area. I’m going to spend $x making a really classy looking shop or restaurant&#x27;.”

== Redevelopment plan ==
The Government of New South Wales published the &#x27;Parramatta Road Urban Transformation Strategy&#x27; in 2016, with a 30-year plan for redeveloping the area through planning and infrastructure investment. Among the strategy&#x27;s goals are housing an additional 56,000 people in 27,000 new homes on the corridor (with minimum five percent affordable housing); 50,000 workers employed in the area; and 66 hectares of new open space is provided through linear parks and along watercourses or infrastructure.

The proposed development rights are worth millions of dollars to developers but are also controversial due to the density of some of the proposals and the likely impact on an already over-congested road. As a result, many of the development proposals are controversial with local residents and are opposed by local councils. A number of the disputes between developers and councils have led to court disputes.

The Inner West Council and City of Canada Bay, through which the road runs for much of its length, have proposed using an electric guided bus running on the centre of the road for public transport, as opposed to kerbside buses as suggested in the strategy.

<doc id="1049138" wikidata="Q3776322" url="?curid=1049138" title="Green Linnet Records">
<text>Green Linnet Records was an American independent record label that specialized in Celtic music. Founded by Lisa Null and Patrick Sky as Innisfree Records in 1973, the label was initially based in Null&#x27;s house in New Canaan, Connecticut. In 1975 the label became Innisfree/Green Linnet and Wendy Newton joined Null and Sky as operating officer. In 1976 Newton took over control of the now Green Linnet label and moved it to Danbury, Connecticut in 1985. Newton became sole owner in 1978. Newton&#x27;s love of Irish music had been sparked during a visit to Ireland where she heard traditional music for the first time in a small pub in County Clare.

==Artists and imprints==
Green Linnet signed Altan, Capercaillie, The Tannahill Weavers and many other significant bands and musicians. From its founding until its sale in 2006 Green Linnet was one of the most influential Celtic music labels, releasing hundreds of albums by a wide range of Irish, Scottish, Breton, Galician and Irish-American musicians. In 1992 a subsidiary called Xenophile Records was added to feature world music from Madagascar, Nigeria, Cuba and other countries. In 1997 Green Linnet launched Celtophile Records to offer budget-priced compilations. There was also a Green Linnet/Redbird series that featured singer-songwriters.

==Artist lawsuit and legacy==
In 2002 Green Linnet was sued for unpaid royalties by bands Cherish the Ladies and Altan and artists Mick Moloney, Joanie Madden and Eileen Ivers. Most artists were paid and most claims were settled in 2006. But there remain a number of outstanding claims that have yet to be resolved, clouding the legacy left behind by Green Linnet and its then-owner Wendy Newton. Bands have been known to leave the label because of poor management from the label, including Wolfstone and Lúnasa.

In May 2006 Newton sold the label to the Digital Music Group, an aggregator of downloadable music. DMG in turn sold the rights to manufacture and distribute Green Linnet and Xenophile physical compact discs to Compass Records. Both the Green Linnet and Xenophile catalogs remain available through Compass.

==Label name==
A linnet is a red-breasted song bird known for its trills and twitters. However, in the Irish rebel song tradition, the name &quot;Green Linnet&quot; has a specific meaning. It was the code name for Napoleon Bonaparte who they hoped would break the chains of British rule. Indeed, in the early 19th century the Society of United Irishmen (the Irish independence organization led by Theobald Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet), allied themselves with France against Britain, but as history would prove, to no effect. The songs, however, were passed down to latter generations.

<text>Papyrus 46 (P. Chester Beatty II), designated by siglum (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is an early Greek New Testament manuscript written on papyrus, and is one of the manuscripts comprising the Chester Beatty Papyri. Manuscripts among the Chester Beatty Papyri have had several provenances associated with them, the most likely being the Faiyum. It has been paleographically dated between 175 and 225, or early 3rd century CE. It contains verses from the Pauline Epistles of Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Hebrews. Some leaves are part of the Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri, and others are in the University of Michigan Papyrus Collection.

In November 2020, the Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts (CSNTM) in conjunction with Hendrickson Publishers released a new 1:1 high-resolution imaged facsimile edition of on black and white backgrounds, along with and .

==Description==
The codex is made from papyrus in single quire, with the folio size approximately . The text is written in single column, with the text-block averaging , between 26 and 32 lines of text per page, although both the width of the rows and the number of rows per page increase progressively. Lines containing text at the bottom of each page are damaged (lacunose), with between 1–2 lines non-extant in the first quarter of the codex, 2–3 lines non-extant in the central half, and up to seven lines non-extant in the final quarter. Though unusual for ancient manuscripts, has each page numbered.

Throughout Romans, Hebrews, and the latter chapters of 1 Corinthians, small and thick strokes or dots are found, usually agreed to be from the hand of a reader rather than the initial copyist, since the ink is always much paler than that of the text itself. They appear to mark sense divisions (similar to verse numbering found in Bibles), and are also found in portions of , possibly evidence of reading in the community which held both codices. Edgar Ebojo made a case that these &quot;reading marks&quot; with or without space-intervals were an aid to readers, most likely in a liturgical context.

===Nomina Sacra===
 uses an extensive and well-developed system of nomina sacra. It contains the following nomina sacra in abbreviated form (nominative case): (κυριος / &quot;Lord&quot;) or (χριστος / &quot;anointed&quot;) (Ιησους / &quot;Jesus&quot;) (θεος / &quot;God&quot;) (πνευμα / &quot;Spirit&quot;) (υιος / &quot;Son&quot;) (σταυρος / &quot;cross&quot;).

The use of nomina sacra has featured in discussions on the dating for , with Bruce Griffin arguing against Young Kyu Kim, in part, that such an extensive usage of the nomina sacra system nearly eliminates any possibility of the manuscript dating to the 1st century. He admitted, however, that Kim&#x27;s dating cannot be ruled out on this basis alone, since the exact provenance of the nomina sacra system itself is not well-established.

On the other hand, Philip Comfort (preferring a date c. 150–75) notes indications the scribe&#x27;s exemplar made limited use of nomina sacra or none at all. In several instances, the word for &quot;Spirit&quot; is written out in full where the context should require a nomen sacrum, suggesting the scribe was rendering nomina sacra where appropriate for the meaning but struggling with &quot;Spirit&quot; versus &quot;spirit&quot;, without guidance from the exemplar. The text also inconsistently uses either the short or the long contracted forms of &quot;Christ&quot;.

===Contents===
 contains most of the Pauline epistles, though with some folios missing. It contains (in order): the last eight chapters of Romans; Hebrews; 1–2 Corinthians; Ephesians; Galatians; Philippians; Colossians; and two chapters of 1 Thessalonians. All of the leaves have lost some lines at the bottom through deterioration.

(&quot;CB&quot; = Chester Beatty Library; &quot;Mich.&quot; = University of Michigan)
===Missing contents===
The contents of the seven missing leaves from the end is uncertain as they are lost. Kenyon calculated that 2 Thessalonians would require two leaves, leaving only five remaining leaves (10 pages) for the remaining canonical Pauline literature — 1 Timothy (estimated 8.25 pages), 2 Timothy (6 pages), Titus (3.5 pages) and Philemon (1.5 pages) — requiring ten leaves in total (19.25 pages). Thus Kenyon concluded as originally constructed did not include the pastoral epistles.

Overall, Kenyon was open to different possibilities regarding the contents of the lost leaves at the end of the codex. He entertained the idea that the last five leaves could have been left blank or that additional leaves could have been added to the quire to create space for the pastoral letters. In 1998, Jeremy Duff vigorously argued in favor of Kenyon&#x27;s second suggestion, emphasizing that the scribe of was increasing the number of letters per page in the second half of the codex. Duff argued that this indicated that the scribe intended to include all of the traditional 14-letter collection and would most likely have added extra leaves if the original quire lacked sufficient space. Duff also pointed to several ancient codices that he considered as good evidence for the attachment of additional leaves to codices to allow for the inclusion of more material. The relevance of the ancient evidence that Duff presented has been challenged, but a survey of surviving examples of ancient single-quire codices does show evidence for the practice of leaving some blank pages at the end of a codex. However, this survey also showed that single-quire codices sometimes had more inscribed pages in the second half of the codex than in the first half (due to, for example, blank front fly-leaves). This leaves open the possibility that the original quire may have contained the traditional 14-letter collection after all. Brent Nongbri summarizes:

The question of the contents of the codex as originally constructed thus remains open.

== Text ==
The text of the codex is considered a representative of the Alexandrian text-type. The text-types are groups of different manuscripts which share specific or generally related readings, which then differ from each other group, and thus the conflicting readings can separate out the groups, which are then used to determine the original text as published; there are three main groups with names: Alexandrian, Western, and Byzantine. Biblical scholar Kurt Aland placed it in Category I of his New Testament manuscript classification system. Category I manuscripts are those &quot;of a very special quality, i. e. manuscripts with a very high proportion of the early text... To this category have also been assigned all manuscripts to the beginning of the fourth century, regardless of further distinctions which should also be observed[.]&quot;

==Provenance==
The provenance of the papyrus is unknown. Kenyon believed this codex and the other Beatty Biblical Papyri came from the region of the Fayyum. The coptologist Carl Schmidt was told that the books were found in &quot;‘Alâlme, a village on the east bank of the Nile in the area of Aṭfiḥ, ancient Aphroditopolis.&quot; However, the archaeologists who bought the University of Michigan&#x27;s portion of the codex believed that it had come from Asyut (ancient Lykopolis). Thus, there is no consensus on the precise find spot.

==Date==
As with all manuscripts dated solely by palaeography, the dating of is uncertain. H. A. Sanders, the first editor of parts of the papyrus, proposed a date possibly as late as the second half of the 3rd century. F. G. Kenyon, editor of the complete editio princeps, preferred a date in the first half of the 3rd century. The manuscript is now sometimes dated to about 200. Young Kyu Kim has argued for an exceptionally early date of c. 80. Kim&#x27;s dating has been widely rejected. Griffin critiqued and disputed Kim&#x27;s dating, placing the &#x27;most probable date&#x27; between 175 and 225, with a &#x27;95% confidence interval&#x27; for a date between 150 and 250.

Comfort and Barrett have claimed shares palaeographical affinities with the following:
* P. Oxy. 8 (assigned late 1st or early 2nd century),
* P. Oxy. 841 (the second hand, which cannot be dated later than 125–50),
* P. Oxy. 1622 (dated with confidence to pre-148, probably during the reign of Hadrian (117–38), because of the documentary text on the verso),
* P. Oxy. 2337 (assigned to the late 1st century),
* P. Oxy. 3721 (assigned to the second half of the 2nd century),
* P. Rylands III 550 (assigned to the 2nd century), and
* P. Berol. 9810 (early 2nd century).
They conclude this points to a date during the middle of the 2nd century for . More recently, in a wide-ranging survey of the dates of New Testament papyri, P. Orsini and W. Clarysse have assigned &quot;to the early third century,&quot; specifically &quot;excluding dates in the first or the first half of the second century.&quot;

<doc id="1049140" wikidata="Q2570723" url="?curid=1049140" title="Sansai">
<text>is a Japanese word literally meaning &quot;mountain vegetables&quot;, originally referring to vegetables that grew naturally, were foraged in the wild, and not grown and harvested from fields. However, in modern times, the distinction is somewhat blurred, as some &quot;sansai&quot; such as &quot;warabi&quot; have been successfully cultivated. For example, some of the fern shoots such as bracken (fiddlehead) and &quot;zenmai&quot; shipped to market are farm-grown.

They are often sold pre-cooked in water, and typically packaged in plastic packs in liquid. The fern shoots &quot;warabi&quot; (bracken), &quot;fuki&quot; stalks in sticks, and mixes which may contain the above-mentioned combined with baby bamboo shoots, mushrooms, etc., are available in retail supermarkets, and ethnic foodstores in the US.

&quot;Sansai&quot; are often used as ingredients in Buddhist vegetarian cuisine known as shōjin ryōri.

== Examples ==
Sansai include:
* &quot;Chishimazasa&quot; (チシマザサ), &quot;Nemagaridake&quot; - bamboo shoots of &quot;Sasa kurilensis&quot;.
* &quot;Fuki-no-tō&quot; (&quot;Petasites japonicus&quot;) - flower shoots of butterbur (&quot;tō&quot; refers to a plant beginning to bolt)
* &quot;Gyojaninniku&quot; (&quot;Allium ochotense&quot;) - similar to ramps (&quot;A. tricoccum&quot;)
* &quot;Hana-ikada&quot; (ハナイカダ), &quot;Helwingia japonica&quot;, young leaves.
* &quot;Harigiri&quot; (&quot;Kalopanax&quot;)- &quot;Acer&quot; species, young leaves tarter than &quot;tara&quot;.
* &quot;Itadori&quot; (&quot;Reynoutria japonica&quot;, syn. &quot;Fallopia japonica&quot; - Japanese knotweed
* &quot;Kogomi&quot; - fernbrakes of &quot;kusasotetsu&quot; (&quot;Matteuccia struthiopteris&quot;)
* &quot;Koshiabura&quot; (コシアブラ), &quot;Chengiopanax sciadophylloides&quot; - young leaves.
* &quot;Mitsuba&quot; (ミツバ), &quot;Cryptotaenia canadensis&quot; subsp. &quot;japonica&quot;
* &quot;Niyama-irakusa&quot; (ミヤマイラクサ), &quot;Laportea macrostachya&quot; - Nettlelike plants, which though young leaves and stems are eaten have stinging hairs requiring caution
* &quot;Nomijigasa&quot; (モミジガサ), &quot;Parasenecio delphiniifolius&quot;, syn. &quot;Cacolia delphiniifolia&quot;) - an aster family plant, for young leaves and shoots
* &quot;Nirinsō&quot; (ニリンソウ), &quot;Anemone flaccida&quot; - young leaves are eaten but may be mistaken for wolfsbane
* &quot;Nobiru&quot; (ノビル), &quot;Allium macrostemon&quot; - similar to field garlic
* &quot;Nogeshi&quot; - sowthistle (&quot;Sonchus oleraceus&quot;), for young leaves 
* &quot;Seri&quot; - Japanese parsley (&quot;Oenanthe javanica&quot;)
* &quot;Sarunashi&quot; (&quot;Actinidia arguta&quot;) - fruits are eaten raw or to flavor alcohol
* &quot;Shiode&quot; (&quot;Smilax riparia&quot; var. &quot;ussuriensis&quot;) - young leaves
* &quot;Tara no me&quot; - young shoots of the Japanese angelica tree
* &quot;Tade&quot; (&quot;Persicaria hydropiper&quot;) - Water pepper, leaves and shoots used as an ingredient for sauces or as a garnish
* &quot;Tsuwabuki&quot; (&quot;Farfugium japonicum&quot;) - Stems prepared like &quot;fuki&quot;
* &quot;Udo&quot; - Japanese spikenard.
* &quot;Uwabamisō&quot; (&quot;Elatostema umbellatum&quot; var. &quot;majus&quot;)
* &quot;Warabi&quot; - bracken shoots
* &quot;Zenmai&quot; - another type of fern top, more prized than &quot;kogomi&quot; or &quot;warabi&quot;, and also sold dried.

<doc id="1049145" wikidata="Q2833862" url="?curid=1049145" title="Aleksandr Martynov (Russian politician)">
<text>Alexandr Martynov (Alexandr Martinov; also, Aleksandr Samoilovich Pikker;) (Russian: Александр Самойлович Мартынов) (12 December 1865 – 5 June 1935) was a leading Menshevik politician before the Russian Revolution of 1917, and for a few years after the revolution a critic of Leon Trotsky&#x27;s theory of permanent revolution (1923).

== Biography ==
The son of a Jewish timber merchant, Martynov joined The People’s Will in 1884, and was arrested three times in 1886-1889, and deported for ten years to the Kolyma region. He became a Marxist after his release, and joined the social democrats in 1899. In 1901, he emigrated to Switzerland and joined the Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad As chief editor of the magazine &quot;Rabocheye Delo&quot; he was a leader of the Economist faction of the RSDLP. He proposed that the RSDLP should be guided by spontaneous initiatives by Russian workers, and confront the government on specific issues of pay and working conditions, where there was a reasonable chance of achieving specific improvements, because “the economic struggle is the most widely applicable means of drawing the masses into active political struggle.” He accused the editors of &quot;Iskra&quot; of focusing too much on long term political issues that were too far removed from the workers&#x27; immediate experience. Lenin devoted whole sections of his pamphlet &quot;What Is to Be Done?.&quot; published in 1902, to attacking &#x27;Economists&#x27; for being &quot;determined always to follow behind the movement and be its tail...&quot; Specifically, he said that Martynov&#x27;s error was thinking that &quot;it is possible to develop the class political consciousness of the workers from within&quot; when, according to Lenin, &quot;class political consciousness can be brought to the workers only from without.&quot;

Martynov was one of two &#x27;Economist&#x27; delegates to the RSDLP congress in Brussels in July 1903, and gave a lengthy response to Lenin&#x27;s attack, claiming that Lenin&#x27;s reliance on professional revolutionaries &quot;opens a deep fissure between the leading elements of the movement and the working-class masses, between the activity of an exclusive party and the broad struggle of the working class.&quot; But he and his fellow Economist Vladimir Makhnovets walked out after the Congress declined to recognise the Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad as a constituent organisation, so neither was present when the RSDLP split into two factions, the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. Later, he joined the Mensheviks, and was one of the faction&#x27;s leading theorists. Trotsky described him as the &quot;semi-official philosopher of Menshevist tactics.&quot;

In January 1905, just before the start of the 1905 revolution, Martynov published an essay &quot;Two Dictatorships&quot; in which he forecast that the Russian aristocracy was about to be overthrown and replaced by a &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; government, and argued that the RSDLP &quot;is and should remain &quot;the party of the extreme opposition&quot;, unlike all the other parties, which can count on joining in the government of a bourgeois society.&quot; Later in the year, he acknowledged that there had been a &quot;tremendous explosion&quot; of working class resistance, and only a &quot;timorous&quot; reaction from the bourgeoisie, but &quot;It does not at all contradict the fact that the present Russian revolution is a bourgeois revolution.&quot; Lenin&#x27;s sarcastic response was that &quot;admirers of Martynov repeat the lessons of peaceful parliamentarism just at a time when, as they themselves state, actual hostilities have commenced. There is nothing more ridiculous than this pompous emphasis of the slogan &#x27;extreme opposition&#x27;.&quot;

Returning to Saint Petersburg late in summer 1905, Martynov took on the editorship of the newspaper &quot;Nachalo&quot;, and seeing how little the Kadets were able to control events, he concluded: &quot;The Social Democrats alone have boldly raised the slogan of permanent revolution at the present time, they alone will lead the masses to the last and decisive victory. &#x27;Permanent revolution&#x27; was a slogan used by Trotsky, who believed that the revolution would be led by the workers&#x27; soviets. But, going back into exile after the revolution had been suppressed, Martynov disowned what he called this &quot;fantastic theory&quot;. He was a member of the Menshevik Organisation Committee from 1912, and supported the Menshevik Internationalists during the war, most of which he spent in Switzerland. He returned to Russia by train through with Julius Martov and others, and like Martov, was one of the minority who opposed the war effort. He was elected to the Menshevik Central Committee in December 1917, but he broke with the party in 1918, during the Russian Civil War. 

After the introduction of the NEP, Martynov claimed that there no longer was an ideological difference between him and the Soviet government. He was admitted to the Communist Party in 1923, and loyally supported Joseph Stalin for the rest of his life.

In the 1920s, Martynov worked as a researcher at the Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute and a lecturer at the Communist Academy and the Sverdlov Communist University, and from 1924, he worked for the Communist International. He became one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s leading spokesmen on world communism. He advocated for the Chinese Communist Party to subordinate itself to the Kuomintang, until the debacle of the Guangzhou Uprising. In 1930, he claimed that the rise of the Nazi party was &quot;necessary condition&quot; for the &quot;decisive&quot; victory of the workers&#x27; revolution.

== Personality ==
According to Nikolai Valentinov, who met Martynov in exile in Switzerland in 1904, he was a fine raconteur. &quot;No one could have imagined that this fat, unattractive-looking man with a lisp, who suffered from a dreadful form of eczema on his hands and head, had a tremendous gift of poetical description,&quot; he wrote, adding that he &quot;could not understand&quot; how Martynov could have become a communist.

<text>Chippendale is a small inner-city suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia on the southern edge of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Sydney. Chippendale is located between Broadway to the north and Cleveland Street to the south, Central railway station to the east and the University of Sydney to the west.

==History==
The area was first occupied by the Gadigal people of the Dharug Nation. William Chippendale was granted a estate in 1819. It stretched to the present day site of Redfern railway station. Chippendale sold the estate to Solomon Levey, emancipist and merchant, in 1821, for 380 pounds. Solomon Levey died while in London in 1833. Levey&#x27;s heirs sold over to William Hutchinson.
Chippendale has a number of heritage-listed sites, including the Regent Street railway station or &#x27;Mortuary Station&#x27;, located on the eastern side of the suburb. The John Storey Memorial Dispensary was built in 1926 as a memorial to John Storey, a former Premier of New South Wales. It is located on Regent Street and still functions as a pathology and methadone clinic.

==Commercial area==
The eastern side of Chippendale, being adjacent to the CBD, has a greater mix use than other parts of the suburb. It includes smaller offices and warehouses as well as cafes and pubs. Transport for NSW has its headquarters here.

The western side of Chippendale is mainly residential with businesses interspersed in some parts of the precinct. 
===Central Park, Sydney===
The 168-year-old Carlton &amp; United brewery closed in December 2006. Frasers Property purchased the brewery site from the Foster&#x27;s Group in 2007 and lodged a plan for a major renewal project of the site. The development proposal &quot;Central Park&quot; included approximately 255,000 m2 of commercial and residential space, retention of a number of heritage buildings and the development of a large new park called Chippendale Green. One Central Park is a large mixed-use residential and commercial building on the site.

Balfour Street Park, at the corner of Balfour and O&#x27;Connor Streets, acts as a pedestrian gateway to Central Park. Chippendale has the lowest open space per person of any Sydney suburb (City of Sydney open space study, 2006). The addition of Chippendale Green has provided much needed green space; however, given the corresponding population increase from new developments, Chippendale now has less than 1 square metre of green space per resident.

===Urban heat island problem===
Chippendale is currently a suburb under study, examining the problems of the urban heat island effect. The bitumen-surfaced roads surrounding infrastructures are reportedly driving temperatures higher than normal. The road network, which constitute over 23 percent of the suburb&#x27;s land area, measured over on average.

==Schools==
The University of Notre Dame Australia sits along the northern border with campus buildings scattered through the suburb. The University of Technology, Sydney and the University of Sydney have campuses nearby. The Sydney campus of Curtin University is located at the eastern edge of Chippendale on Regent Street. The Boston University Sydney Campus is located on Regent Street in Chippendale.

==Culture==
Chippendale has become known as one of the key creative art districts of Sydney with more than a dozen galleries in the small neighbourhood (including White Rabbit Gallery, MOP Projects, and Pine Street Creative Arts Centre). Various creative events in the suburb also take place each year such as the Beams Festival. Artist residencies were offered with the cooperation of Frasers during the construction of Central Park and Chippendale houses a lively creative community.

==Population==
