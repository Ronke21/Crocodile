<text>Joshua Humphreys (June 17, 1751 – January 12, 1838) was an American ship builder and naval architect. He was the constructor of the original six frigates of the United States Navy and is known as the &quot;Father of the American Navy&quot;.

Humphreys was born in Ardmore, Haverford Township, Pennsylvania, where he lived his entire life. He was the son of Joshua Humphreys (for whom he was named) and Sarah Williams, grandson of Daniel Humphreys and Hannah Wynne (daughter of Dr. Thomas Wynne). He was a nephew of Charles Humphreys, a leading Pennsylvania Patriot. His home, Pont Reading, is still a private residence.

==Career==
As a youth, Humphreys was apprenticed to a shipbuilder in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; most of the major shipbuilders in Philadelphia were, like Humphreys, followers of the Quaker faith. At some point during his apprenticeship, Humphreys was transferred to a different master, who died unexpectedly in 1774. Despite his youth and unfinished training, Humphreys inherited ownership of his master&#x27;s yard. During the American Revolutionary War he was active as a builder and outfitter of privateering vessels and played a major part in planning the 32-gun frigate before the British Army occupation of Philadelphia halted that effort.

In postwar Philadelphia, Humphreys gained a reputation as the city&#x27;s best shipbuilder and quickly became a wealthy man. His main shipyard complex was on the Delaware River in the Southwark neighborhood. 

When Congress passed the Naval Act of 1794 providing for the construction of six frigates, it called on him to design them. He was appointed &quot;Master Naval Constructor&quot; on June 28, 1794, and began work on these ships, the beginnings of the U.S. Navy. 

Reputedly, one of the inspirations for his frigate designs was the &quot;South Carolina&quot;, planned by an innovative French shipwright. His designs called for ships that were longer and wider than usual, sat lower in the water and were able to equal the speed of any other fighting ships. The ships Humphrey built were more stable than other ships at the time and could carry as many guns on one deck as others did on two decks.

The USS &quot;United States&quot; was built by Humphreys in Philadelphia, and was the first of the new ships to be launched on May 10, 1797. These vessels were larger than other ships of their class and formed the core of the Navy during the War of 1812, and scored several victories against British ships, although two were captured. 
His six frigates were:

*USS &quot;United States&quot; (1797)
*USS &quot;Constellation&quot; (1797)
*USS &quot;Constitution&quot; (1797)
*USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; (1799)
*USS &quot;Congress&quot; (1799)
*USS &quot;President&quot; (1800)
In 1789, Humphreys was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

==Family==
His uncle was Charles Humphreys, a member of the Continental Congress. His son was another noted naval architect, Samuel Humphreys. His grandson, General Andrew Atkinson Humphreys, served throughout the American Civil War.

==Legacy==
Two ships, and , were named for Humphreys.

Building 197 of the Washington Navy Yard was completely renovated in 2014 and renamed in honor of Humphreys. The building was the site of the Washington Navy Yard shooting on September 16, 2013.

<doc id="1075416" wikidata="Q5224982" url="?curid=1075416" title="Darren Hughes">
<text>Darren Colyn Hughes (born 3 April 1978) is a New Zealand former Member of Parliament between 2002 and 2011, first elected at the age of 24. He represented the Labour Party and was a Minister outside Cabinet in the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand.

In 2011, Hughes resigned from Parliament and in 2012, he relocated to the United Kingdom to become the Campaigns and Research Director of the Electoral Reform Society. In 2017, Hughes became Chief Executive of the Electoral Reform Society, based in South London.

==Early life and education==
Hughes attended Coley Street Primary School in Foxton, St Josephs and then Horowhenua College in Levin. While at school Hughes was involved in the school and wider community including a three-year stint as Student Representative on the Board of Trustees.

In 1994, Hughes was a Youth MP. He was the first Youth MP to later be elected to Parliament. Hughes attended Victoria University of Wellington, and was a member of Vic Labour, where he completed a Bachelor of Arts in public policy and social policy. In 2017, Hughes completed a master&#x27;s degree at the London School of Economics.

==In government (2002–2008)==

Hughes was elected to parliament as member for Otaki in the 2002 general election, standing for the Labour Party. For the next six years he was New Zealand&#x27;s youngest MP. In 2005, he was re-elected with the country&#x27;s smallest majority, 382.

As a local MP, Hughes had a strong record of delivering for the communities in the Otaki constituency. One example was Horowhenua Health Centre in Levin which opened in 2007. The $16 million facility was one of Hughes&#x27; proudest achievements. He also organised a local campaign to save the centre when it was threatened by budget cuts in 2010.

===Voting record===
Hughes voted in favour of a law allowing same sex civil unions and the decriminalisation of prostitution, but against a Death with Dignity law.

===Party responsibilities and ministerial positions===
Hughes was his party&#x27;s junior whip and a Member of the Officers of Parliament Select Committee. In November 2007, as a part of the fifth Labour government&#x27;s final reshuffle, Prime Minister Helen Clark made him a Minister outside Cabinet with the Statistics portfolio. He was also made the associate minister for Social Development and Employment. He also served as deputy Leader of the House. As a government minister and member of the Executive Council, Hughes is able to use the title &quot;the Honourable&quot; for life.

==In opposition (2008–2011)==
In the 2008 general election the National Party defeated Labour. Hughes lost his Otaki seat to Nathan Guy but, being listed by Labour at 19, returned to Parliament as a list MP. Opposition Leader Phil Goff appointed him Transport Spokesperson. He was also made the opposition&#x27;s senior whip.

On 15 June 2010, as part of a shadow-cabinet reshuffle, Hughes became the Spokesperson for Infrastructure. Later, he was also given the Education portfolio and served as Shadow Leader of the House from 2009 to 2011.

In 2010, Darren Hughes submitted a private members&#x27; bill to lower the drink driving limit to 0.05 (its full name was the Land Transport (Safer Alcohol Limits for Driving) Amendment Bill). The bill was his response to an earlier government decision to not lower the limit. It was placed on the ballot in June, August and November, but not drawn. According to the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; at the time, Hughes &quot;…drafted his legislation only after the Government decided not to lower the limit. But, commendably, he has been careful not to make it an exercise in points-scoring.&quot; Hughes was quoted as saying he wanted politicians to &quot;put aside their party differences and work together on issues of road safety&quot;.

==Police investigation and resignation==
Hughes&#x27;s time as an MP ended abruptly in March 2011 after a young man laid a police complaint of a sexual nature against him. The complaint concerned events that occurred on 2 March. Shortly after the complaint became public, and while the police were still investigating, Hughes resigned from Parliament. His resignation was announced on 25 March and effective from 5 April. Louisa Wall replaced him as a Labour list MP.

On 8 June the Police confirmed that they would not lay any charges against Hughes.

===Sequence of events===
On 23 March 2011 Hughes confirmed that he was &quot;being investigated by police after an alleged late night incident.&quot; This announcement was designed to end speculation surrounding his Labour party colleagues.

Hughes denied any wrongdoing but later offered to resign from Parliament. Labour leader Phil Goff, who had known about the complaint for two weeks, initially refused the resignation but changed his mind a day later. Goff announced Hughes&#x27; resignation on 25 March 2011.

On the same day Hughes released another statement which in part said:

&quot;My position as an MP has become untenable. In order to be able to exercise my basic rights as a citizen, it is necessary for me to resign as a Member of Parliament. I have informed Phil Goff of my decision.

Although people are commonly thought to be innocent until proven guilty, it has become clear to me that this doesn&#x27;t apply in the political arena.

I have done nothing wrong, and I remain confident that the legal process will have the right outcome.

My immediate focus is on clearing my name. I will continue to co-operate fully with the police inquiry ...&quot;

Speaker of the House Lockwood Smith confirmed Hughes&#x27;s resignation on 1 April and it took effect on 5 April 2011.

Over three months after the original incident, on 8 June, the Police announced that they did not have enough evidence to press charges against Hughes. They also revealed that an anonymous letter containing allegations against Hughes had been sent to &quot;some media outlets&quot;. They had investigated these allegations but &quot;there were no matters which arose that required police attention&quot;.

===Reallocation of portfolios===
The roles that Hughes had filled for the Labour opposition went to Sue Moroney, David Shearer and Rick Barker. Moroney took over the education portfolio, with specific responsibility for primary and secondary schooling, and joined the party&#x27;s front bench. Shearer took over the tertiary education portfolio and Barker became the new senior whip.

===Replacement by Louisa Wall (as MP) and Peter Foster (as Otaki candidate)===
Because he had been elected through the party list rather than by an electorate, Hughes&#x27; seat passed down Labour&#x27;s party list to Louisa Wall without a by-election. There were five people listed before Wall who could have taken the seat, but they all stood aside. (Wall, unlike the others, was due to stand for Labour in the general election later that year.) The five were all former MPs, listed at numbers 38–42: Judith Tizard (number 38), Mark Burton, Mahara Okeroa, Martin Gallagher and Dave Hereora (42).

With Hughes not running for re-election, Labour named Raumati lawyer Peter Foster as their Otaki electorate candidate for 2011.

== Current role ==

, Hughes is Chief Executive of the Electoral Reform Society (ERS). The ERS is a civil society organisation striving to make British democracy fit for the 21st century. Since joining the ERS in 2012, Hughes has been responsible for driving the Society&#x27;s campaigns and research priorities.

Under the leadership of Hughes and former Chief Executive Katie Ghose, the Electoral Reform Society has broadened its remit beyond its traditional focus on voting systems, to promote other issues that are vital to the health of British democracy. These priorities fall within the campaign and research fields of &quot;A Fair Franchise&quot;, &quot;Who Runs Britain?&quot;, and &quot;Democratic Futures&quot;.

<doc id="1075422" wikidata="Q4584076" url="?curid=1075422" title="Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War">
<text>During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Army and British Army conducted espionage operations against one another to collect military intelligence to inform military operations. In addition, both sides conducted political action, covert action, counterintelligence, deception, and propaganda operations as part of their overall strategies.

American intelligence was monitored and sanctioned by the Continental Congress to provide military intelligence to the Continental Army to aid them in fighting the British during the American Revolutionary War. Congress created a Secret Committee for domestic intelligence, a Committee of Secret Correspondence for foreign intelligence, and a committee on spies, for tracking spies within the Patriot movement.

British espionage efforts were overseen by the British Army and focused primarily on gathering military intelligence to support military operations.

== American organizations involved in espionage==

=== Secret Committee ===
The Second Continental Congress created a Secret Committee on September 18, 1775. The committee was not, however, a true intelligence agency, since the Committee of Secret Correspondence with which it often worked was mainly concerned with obtaining military supplies in secret and distributing them, and selling gunpowder to privateers chartered by the Congress. The committee also took over and administered on a uniform basis the secret contracts for arms and gunpowder previously negotiated by certain members of Congress without the formal sanction of that body. The Committee kept its transactions secret and destroyed many of its records to ensure the confidentiality of its work.

The Secret Committee employed agents overseas, often in cooperation with the Committee of Secret Correspondence. It gathered intelligence about secret Loyalist ammunition stores and arranged to seize them. The committee also sent missions to seize British supplies in the southern colonies. It arranged the purchase of military stores through intermediaries to conceal the fact that Congress was the true purchaser. They then used foreign flags to attempt to protect the vessels from the British fleet.

The members of the Continental Congress appointed to the Committee included some of the most influential and responsible members of Congress: Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, Robert Livingston, John Dickinson, Thomas Willing, Thomas McKean, John Langdon, and Samuel Ward.

=== Committee of (Secret) Correspondence ===

The Second Continental Congress recognized the need for foreign intelligence and foreign alliances and created the Committee of Correspondence (soon renamed the Committee of Secret Correspondence) by a resolution of November 29, 1775. The original Committee members—America&#x27;s first foreign intelligence agency—were Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Harrison, Thomas Johnson and subsequently included James Lovell, who became the Congress&#x27; expert on codes and ciphers and has been called the father of American cryptanalysis.

The committee employed secret agents abroad, conducted covert operations, devised codes and ciphers, funded propaganda activities, authorized the opening of private mail, acquired foreign publications for use in analysis, established a courier system, and developed a maritime capability apart from that of the Continental Navy, and engaged in regular communications with Britons and Scots who sympathized with the American cause. It met secretly in December 1775 with a French intelligence agent who visited Philadelphia undercover as a Flemish merchant. 

On April 17, 1777, the Committee of Secret Correspondence renamed the Committee of Foreign Affairs but kept with its intelligence function. Matters of diplomacy were conducted by other committees or by Congress as a whole. On January 10, 1781, the Department of Foreign Affairs—the forerunner of the Department of State—was created and tasked with &quot;obtaining the most extensive and useful information relative to foreign affairs&quot;, the head of which was empowered to correspond &quot;with all other persons from whom he may expect to receive useful information.&quot;

=== Committee on Spies ===
On June 5, 1776, the Congress appointed John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Edward Rutledge, James Wilson, and Robert Livingston &quot;to consider what is proper to be done with persons giving intelligence to the enemy or supplying them with provisions.&quot; They were charged with revising the Articles of War regarding espionage directed against the American forces. The problem was an urgent one: Benjamin Church, chief physician of the Continental Army, had already been seized and imprisoned as a British agent, but there was no civilian espionage act, and George Washington thought the existing military law did not provide punishment severe enough to afford a deterrent. On November 7, 1775, the death penalty was added for espionage to the Articles of War, but the clause was not applied retroactively, and Church escaped execution. On August 21, 1776, the committee&#x27;s report was considered by Congress, which enacted the first espionage act. It was resolved further that the act &quot;be printed at the end of the rules and articles of war.&quot; On February 27, 1778, the law was broadened to include any &quot;inhabitants of these states&quot; whose intelligence activities aided the enemy in capturing or killing revolutionary forces.

==British organizations involved in espionage==
Compared to American espionage efforts, British efforts were limited during the first four years of the war. General Henry Clinton was nominally in charge of the British Army&#x27;s espionage efforts, which had minimal impact on British military operations. In May 1779, Clinton appointed his aide-de-camp John André as the head of British espionage operations in North America. André began to develop a more formalized espionage apparatus, including creating a spy network that expanded outside New York City and employed cipher codes to protect communications with spies.

== Counterintelligence ==
Probably the first organization under the Articles of Confederation created for counterintelligence purposes was the Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies, later the commission. It was made up of a series of groups established in New York between June 1776 and January 1778 to collect intelligence, apprehend British spies and couriers, and examine suspected British sympathizers. It was created as a &quot;secret service&quot; which had the power to arrest, convict, to grant bail, parole, or imprison or deport. A company of militia was placed under its command. The Committee heard over 500 cases involving disloyalty and subversion. John Jay has been called the first chief of American counterintelligence because of his role in the committee.

William Duer, a New York planter and politician, and Nathaniel Sackett, an agent suggested by Duer to George Washington, were particularly successful in ferreting out British agents, but found their greatest success in the missions of one of the dozen or so agents of their own, Enoch Crosby. Crosby, a veteran of the Continental Army, had been mistaken by a Westchester County Loyalist as being someone who shared his views. He confided to Crosby that a secret enemy military company was being formed and introduced him to the group. Crosby reported the plot to the committee and was taken with the group. He managed to &quot;escape&quot; and, as directed, infiltrated another secret Tory unit. This unit, including Crosby, was also taken and escaped once more. He repeated the operation at least two more times before the loyalists started to get wise to his &quot;escaping&quot; and he retired. Crosby was the model for the central character in James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s book The Spy (1821), the first espionage novel written in English.

Another successful American agent was Captain David Gray from the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Posing as a deserter, Gray entered the service of Colonel Beverly Robinson, a Tory intelligence officer, and became Robinson&#x27;s courier. As a result, the contents of each of Robinson&#x27;s dispatches were read by the Americans before their delivery. Gray eventually became the courier for Major Oliver DeLancey Jr., the head of the British secret service in New York. For two years, Gray, as DeLancey&#x27;s courier to Canada, successfully penetrated the principal communications link of the British secret service. Upon completing his assignment, Gray returned to the ranks of the Continental Army, and his name was struck from the deserter list, where it had been placed at the beginning of the operation.

Major Benjamin Tallmadge, a senior intelligence officer under Continental Army commander George Washington, played a key role in the capture of Major John André, who preceded DeLancey as chief of the British secret service in New York. Although he declined to discuss the episode in his memoirs, it is said that one of Tallmadge&#x27;s agents had reported to him that Major André was in contact with a &quot;John Anderson&quot; who was expecting the surrender of a major installation. Learning that a certain John Anderson had been captured by three Militiamen, Tallmadge hurried to the post where André was being held. John Paulding, Isaac Van Wert, and David Williams had been on sentry trying to catch loyalist &quot;Cow-Boys&quot; that had been preying on people in Westchester County, New York. 

André mistakenly assumed that the men were aligned with the British and declared himself to be a British officer. Then, upon realizing the mistake, he tried to use a pass provided by Arnold. They searched André and found papers hidden in his socks. Paulding understood the papers revealed &quot;Anderson&quot; to be a spy and stated that no amount of money would be enough to let André go. As Tallmadge arrived at the post, he found that the acting Post Commander had sent André, under guard, back to General Arnold. After extensive and animated lobbying by Tallmadge, the commander, Jamieson, ordered that &quot;Anderson&quot; be returned for interrogation. &quot;Anderson&quot; admitted to his true identity (that he was André) and was tried, convicted, and executed as a spy. Arnold, learning that André had been taken and that his treachery was no doubt exposed, fled West Point before he could be captured, and joined the British forces.

General Washington demanded effective counterintelligence work from his subordinates. On March 24, 1776, for example, he wrote: &quot;There is one evil I dread, and that is, their spies. I could wish, therefore, the most attentive watch be kept... I wish a dozen or more of honest, sensible, and diligent men, were employed... to question, cross-question, etc., all such persons as are unknown, and cannot give an account of themselves in a straight and satisfactory line... I think it a matter of importance to prevent them from obtaining intelligence of our situation.&quot; 

Washington occasionally had to deal with rogue intelligence officers in his ranks who used their positions for personal gain or undertook unauthorized or illegal operations that might have compromised parts of his intelligence apparatus. Once Washington discovered that two of his agents who supposedly were collecting intelligence on Long Island were &quot;mere plundering parties.&quot; He set up a special team to investigate and arrest the renegade operatives.

==Techniques==

===Foreign intelligence===
The first intelligence agent enlisted by the Secret Correspondence Committee was Arthur Lee, then living in London. On November 30, 1775, the day after its founding, the Committee appointed Lee as its agent in England and told him that &quot;it is considered of the utmost consequence to the cause of liberty that the Committee is kept informed of developments in Europe.&quot; Following the first Congressional appropriation for the work of the Committee on December 11, 1775, two hundred pounds was forwarded to Lee with the urging that he finds out the &quot;disposition of foreign powers towards us, and the admonition that we need not hint that great circumspection and impenetrable security are necessary.&quot;

The next agent recruited abroad by the committee was Charles W. F. Dumas, a Swiss journalist at The Hague. Dumas was briefed personally by Thomas Story, a courier of the committee, and instructed on the use of cover names and letter drops to be used for his reports to the committee and communication with Lee in London. He also planted stories in a Dutch newspaper, Gazette de Leide, intended to give the United States a favorable rating in Dutch credit markets.

On March 1, 1776, the Committee appointed Silas Deane, a former delegate to Congress and future ambassador to France, as its agent there. He was instructed to pose as a Bermudian merchant dealing in Indian goods. He was also charged with making secret purchases and with attempting to gain secret assistance from the French crown. Later, both Deane and Lee would be converted from agents to commissioners to the French Crown, albeit secret ones, until the open and formal alliance of France with the Americans.

Other agents of the Committee included William Bingham, who served first in France and then in Martinique, where he had once been British Consul; Major Jonathan Loring Austin, William Carmichael, and William Hodge.

===Secrecy and protection===
The Committee of Secret Correspondence insisted that matters about the funding and instruction of intelligence agents be held within the committee. In calling for the Committee members to &quot;lay their proceedings before Congress,&quot; the Congress, by resolution, authorized &quot;withholding the names of the persons they have employed, or with whom they have corresponded.&quot; On May 20, 1776, when the committee&#x27;s proceedings—with the sensitive names removed—were finally read in the Congress, it was &quot;under the injunction of secrecy.&quot; The Continental Congress, recognizing the need for secrecy regarding foreign intelligence, foreign alliances, and military matters, maintained &quot;Secret Journals,&quot; apart from its public journals, to record its decisions in such matters. On November 9, 1775, the Continental Congress adopted its oath of secrecy, one more stringent than the oaths of secrecy it would require of others in sensitive employment. On June 12, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the first secrecy agreement for employees of the new government. The required oath read:

I do solemnly swear, that I will not directly or indirectly divulge any manner or thing which shall come to my knowledge as (clerk, secretary) of the board of War and Ordnance for the United Colonies. . . So help me God.

The Continental Congress, sensitive to the vulnerability of its covert allies, respected their desire for strict secrecy. Even after France declared war against England, the fact of French involvement before that time remained a state secret. When Thomas Paine, in a series of letters to the press in 1777, divulged details of the secret aid from the files of the Committee of Foreign Affairs (formerly, the Committee of Secret Correspondence), France&#x27;s Minister to the United States, Conrad Alexandre Gérard de Rayneval, protested to the president of the Congress that Paine&#x27;s indiscreet assertions &quot;bring into question the dignity and reputation of the King, my master, and that of the United States.&quot; Congress dismissed Paine, and by public resolution denied having received such aid, resolving that &quot;His Most Christian Majesty, the great and generous ally of the United States, did not preface his alliance with any supplies whatever sent to America.&quot;

In 1779, George Washington and John Jay, the president of the Continental Congress and a close associate of the Commander in Chief&#x27;s on intelligence matters, disagreed about the effect disclosure of some intelligence would have on sources and methods. Washington wanted to publicize certain encouraging information that he judged would give &quot;a certain spring to our affairs&quot; and bolster public morale. Jay replied that the intelligence &quot;is unfortunately of such a Nature, or rather so circumstanced, as to render Secrecy necessary.&quot; Jay prevailed.

===Cover===
Robert Townsend, an important American agent in the British-occupied city of New York, used the guise of being a merchant, as did Silas Deane when he was sent to France by the Committee of Secret Correspondence. Townsend was usually referred to by his cover name of &quot;Culper, Junior.&quot; When Major Benjamin Tallmadge, who directed Townsend&#x27;s espionage work, insisted that he disengage himself from his cover business to devote more time to intelligence gathering, General Washington overruled him. Townsend also was the silent partner of a coffee house frequented by British officers, an ideal place for hearing loose talk that was of value to the American cause.

Major John Clark&#x27;s agents in and around British-controlled Philadelphia used several covers (farmer, peddler, and smuggler, among others) so effectively that only one or two operatives may have been detained. The agents traveled freely in and out of Philadelphia and passed intelligence to Washington about British troops, fortifications, and supplies, and of a planned surprise attack.

Enoch Crosby, a counterintelligence officer, posed as an unsuspecting shoemaker (his civilian trade) to travel through southern New York state while infiltrating Loyalist cells. After the Tories started to suspect him when he kept &quot;escaping&quot; from the Americans, Crosby&#x27;s superiors moved him to Albany, New York, where he resumed his undercover espionage.

John Honeyman, an Irish weaver who had offered to spy for the Americans, used several covers (butcher, Tory, British agent) to collect intelligence on British military activities in New Jersey. He participated in a deception operation that left the Hessians in Trenton unprepared for Washington&#x27;s attack across the Delaware River on December 26, 1776.

===Disguise===
In January 1778, Nancy Morgan Hart, who was tall, muscular, and cross-eyed, disguised herself as a &quot;touched&quot; or emotionally disturbed man, and entered Augusta, Georgia, to obtain intelligence on British defenses. Her mission was a success. Later, when a group of Tories attacked her home to gain revenge, she captured them all and was witness to their execution.

In June 1778, General Washington instructed Henry &quot;Light Horse Harry&quot; Lee to send an agent into the British fort at Stony Point, New York, to gather intelligence on the exact size of the garrison and the progress it was making in building defenses. Captain Allan McLane took the assignment. Dressing as a country bumpkin and utilizing the cover of escorting a Mrs. Smith into the fort to see her sons, McLane spent two weeks collecting intelligence within the British fort and returned safely.

While serving in Paris as an agent of the Committee of Secret Correspondence, Silas Deane is known to have used a heat-developing invisible ink—a compound of cobalt chloride, glycerine, and water—for some of his intelligence reports back to America. Even more useful to him later was a &quot;sympathetic stain&quot; created for secret communications by James Jay, a physician and the brother of John Jay. Jay, who had been knighted by George III, used the &quot;stain&quot; for reporting military information from London to America. Later he supplied quantities of the stain to George Washington at home and to Silas Deane in Paris.

The stain required one chemical for writing the message and a second to develop it, affording greater security than the ink used by Deane earlier. Once, in a letter to John Jay, Robert Morris spoke of an innocuous letter from &quot;Timothy Jones&quot; (Deane) and the &quot;concealed beauties therein,&quot; noting &quot;the cursory examinations of a sea captain would never discover them but transferred from his hand to the penetrating eye of a Jay, the diamonds stand confessed at once.&quot;

Washington instructed his agents in the use of the &quot;sympathetic stain,&quot; noting in connection with &quot;Culper Junior&quot; that the ink &quot;will not only render his communications less exposed to detection, but relieve the fears of such persons as may be entrusted in its conveyance.&quot; Washington suggested that reports could be written in invisible ink &quot;on the blank leaves of a pamphlet. . . a common pocket book, or on the blank leaves at each end of registers, almanacs, or any publication or book of small value.&quot;

Washington especially recommended that agents conceal their reports by using the ink in correspondence: &quot;A much better way is to write a letter in the Tory stile with some mixture of family matters and between the lines and on the remaining part of the sheet communicate with the Stain the intended intelligence.&quot;

Even though the Patriots took great care to write sensitive messages in invisible ink, or code or cipher, it is estimated that the British intercepted and decrypted over half of America&#x27;s secret correspondence during the war. 

===Codes and ciphers===
American Revolutionary leaders used various methods of cryptography to conceal diplomatic, military, and personal messages.

John Jay and Arthur Lee devised dictionary codes in which numbers referred to the page and line in an agreed-upon dictionary edition where the plaintext (unencrypted message) could be found.

In 1775, Charles Dumas designed the first diplomatic cipher that the Continental Congress and Benjamin Franklin used to communicate with agents and ministers in Europe. Dumas&#x27;s system substituted numbers for letters in the order in which they appeared in a preselected paragraph of French prose containing 682 symbols. This method was more secure than the standard alphanumeric substitution system, in which a through z are replaced with 1 through 26 because each letter in the plain text could be replaced with more than one number.

The Culper Spy Ring used a numerical substitution code developed by Major Benjamin Tallmadge, the network&#x27;s leader. The Ring began using the code after the British captured some papers indicating that some Americans around New York were using &quot;sympathetic stain.&quot; Tallmadge took several hundred words from a dictionary and several dozen names of people or places and assigned each a number from 1 to 763. For example, 38 meant to attack, 192 stood for the fort, George Washington was identified as 711, and New York was replaced by 727. An American agent posing as a deliveryman transmitted the messages to other members of the Ring. One of them, Anna Strong (spy), signaled the message&#x27;s location with a code involving laundry hung out to dry. A black petticoat indicated that a message was ready to be picked up, and the number of handkerchiefs identified the cove on Long Island Sound where the agents would meet. By the end of the war, several prominent Americans—among them Robert Morris, John Jay, Robert Livingston, and John Adams—were using other versions of numerical substitution codes.

The Patriots had two notable successes in breaking British ciphers. In 1775, Elbridge Gerry and the team of Elisha Porter and the Rev. Samuel West, working separately at Washington&#x27;s direction, decrypted a letter that implicated Benjamin Church, the Continental Army&#x27;s chief surgeon, in espionage for the British.

In 1781, James Lovell, who designed cipher systems used by several prominent Americans, determined the encryption method that British commanders used to communicate with each other. When a dispatch from Lord Cornwallis in Yorktown, Virginia, to General Henry Clinton in New York was intercepted, Lovell&#x27;s cryptanalysis enabled Washington to gauge how desperate Cornwallis&#x27;s situation was and to time his attack on the British lines. Soon after, another decrypt by Lovell provided a warning to the French fleet off Yorktown that a British relief expedition was approaching. The French scared off the British flotilla, sealing the victory for the Americans.

===Intercepting communications===
The Continental Congress regularly received quantities of intercepted British and Tory mail. On November 20, 1775, it received some intercepted letters from Cork, Ireland, and appointed a committee made up of John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Johnson, Robert Livingston, Edward Rutledge, James Wilson and George Wythe &quot;to select such parts of them as may be proper to publish.&quot; The Congress later ordered a thousand copies of the portions selected by the committee to be printed and distributed. A month later, when another batch of intercepted mail was received, a second committee was appointed to examine it. Based on its report, Congress resolved that &quot;the contents of the intercepted letters this day read, and the steps which Congress may take in consequence of said intelligence thereby given, be kept secret until further orders.&quot; By early 1776, abuses were noted in the practice, and Congress resolved that only the councils or committees of the safety of each colony, and their designees, could henceforth open the mail or detain any letters from the post.

When Moses Harris reported that the British had recruited him as a courier for their Secret Service, General Washington proposed that General Schuyler &quot;contrive a means of opening them without breaking the seals, take copies of the contents, and then let them go on. By these means, we should become masters of the whole plot.&quot; From that point on, Washington was privy to British intelligence pouches between New York and Canada.

===Technology===
James Jay used the advanced technology of his time in creating the invaluable &quot;sympathetic stain&quot; used for secret communications. Perhaps the American Patriots&#x27; most advanced application of technology was in David Bushnell&#x27;s &quot;Turtle&quot;, a one-man submarine created for affixing watchword-timed explosive charges to the bottoms of enemy ships.

The &quot;turtle,&quot; now credited with being the first use of the submarine in warfare, was an oaken chamber about five-and-a-half feet (1.6 m) wide and seven feet (2.1 m) high. It was propelled by a front-mounted, pedal-powered propeller at a speed of up to three miles per hour (5  km/h), had a barometer to read depth, a pump to raise or lower the submarine through the water, and provision for both lead and water ballast.

When Bushnell learned that the candle used to illuminate instruments inside the &quot;turtle&quot; consumed the oxygen in its air supply, he turned to Benjamin Franklin for help. The solution: the phosphorescent weed, foxfire. Heavy tides thwarted the first sabotage operation. A copper-clad hull that could not be penetrated by the submarine&#x27;s auger foiled the second. (The &quot;turtle&quot; did blow up a nearby schooner, however.) The secret weapon would almost certainly have achieved success against a warship if it had not gone to the bottom of the Hudson River when the mother ship to which it was moored was sunk by the British in October 1776.

An early device developed for concealing intelligence reports when traveling by water was a simple weighted bottle that could be dropped overboard if there was a threat of capture. This was replaced by a wafer-thin leaden container in which a message was sealed. It would sink in water, melt in a fire, and could be used by agents on land or water. It had one drawback—lead poisoning if it was swallowed. It was replaced by a silver, bullet-shaped container that could be unscrewed to hold a message and which would not poison a courier who might be forced to swallow it.

===Deception operations===
To offset British superiority in firepower and number of troops, General Washington made frequent use of deception and disinformation. He allowed fabricated documents to fall into the hands of enemy agents or be discussed in their presence. He allowed couriers carrying bogus information to be &quot;captured&quot; by the British, and inserted forged documents in intercepted British communications that were then permitted to continue to their destination. He had army procurement officers make false purchases of large quantities of supplies in places picked to convince the British that a sizable rebel force was massing. Washington even had fake military facilities built. In all this, he managed to make the British believe that his three-thousand-man army outside Philadelphia was forty thousand strong.

After learning from the Culper Ring that the British planned to attack a French expedition that had just landed in Newport, Rhode Island, Washington planted information with known British agents indicating that he intended to move against New York City. The British commander held back the troops headed for Rhode Island. With elaborate deception, Washington masked his movement toward the Chesapeake Bay and Yorktown by convincing the British that he was moving on to New York.

At Yorktown, James Armistead, a slave who had joined Lafayette&#x27;s service with his master&#x27;s permission, crossed into Cornwallis&#x27; lines in the guise of an escaped slave, and was recruited by Cornwallis to return to American lines as a spy. Lafayette gave him a fabricated order that was destined for a large number of nonexistent replacements. Armistead delivered the bogus order in crumpled, dirty condition to Cornwallis, claiming to have found it along the road during his mission. Cornwallis believed him and did not learn he had been tricked until after his surrender. Armistead was granted his freedom by the Virginia General Assembly as a result of this and other wartime services.

Another deception operation at Yorktown found Charles Morgan entering Cornwallis&#x27; camp as a deserter. When debriefed by the British, he convinced them that Lafayette had sufficient boats to move all his troops against the British in one landing operation. Cornwallis was duped by him and dug in rather than marched out of Yorktown. Morgan, in turn, escaped in a British uniform and returned to the American lines with five British deserters and a prisoner.

===Propaganda===
Upon receiving accurate intelligence that the British were hiring Hessian mercenaries for service in America, Congress appointed a three-man committee &quot;to devise a plan for encouraging the Hession and other foreigners... to quit that iniquitous service.&quot; The result was a resolution, believed to have been drafted by Thomas Jefferson, offering land grants to German deserters. It was translated into German and sent to the Hessians.

Benjamin Franklin, who joined the committee to implement the operation, arranged for the leaflets to be disguised as tobacco packets to make sure they would fall into the hands of ordinary Hessian soldiers. Christopher Ludwick was dispatched by Washington into the enemy camp, posing as a deserter, to contact the Hessians and encourage them to defect. He is credited with the defection of &quot;many hundred soldiers&quot; from the German ranks.

In 1777, after he arrived in France, Benjamin Franklin fabricated a letter purportedly sent by a German prince to the commander of his mercenaries in America. The letter disputed British casualty figures for the German troops, arguing that the actual number was much higher and that he was entitled to a great amount of &quot;blood money&quot;, the amount paid to the prince for each of his men killed or wounded. The prince also encouraged the officer to be humane and to allow his wounded to die, rather than try to save men who might only become cripples unfit for service to their prince.

Between 5,000 and 6,000 Hessians deserted from the British side during the war, in part because of American propaganda.

Franklin also produced a newspaper report purporting to describe the transmittal of scalps of soldiers, settlers, women, and children to the Royal Governor of Canada by Britain&#x27;s Indian allies. The Indian transmittal letter indicated that a certain mark on scalps indicated they were those of women who &quot;were knocked dead or had their brains beat out.&quot;

==Intelligence analysis and estimates==
On May 29, 1775, the Continental Congress received the first of many intelligence estimates prepared in response to questions it posed to military commanders. The report estimated the size of the enemy force to be encountered in an attack on New York, the number of Continental troops needed to meet it, and the kind of force needed to defend the other New England colonies.

An example of George Washington&#x27;s interest in intelligence analysis and estimates can be found in instructions he wrote to General Putnam in August 1777: &quot;Deserters and people of that class always speak of number. ... Indeed, scarce any person can form a judgment unless he sees the troops paraded and can count the divisions. But, if you can by any means obtain a list of the regiments left upon the island, we can compute the number of men within a few hundred, over or under.&quot; On another occasion, in thanking James Lovell for a piece of intelligence, Washington wrote: &quot;It is by comparing a variety of information, we are frequently enabled to investigate facts, which were so intricate or hidden, that no single clue could have led to the knowledge of them. ... Intelligence becomes interesting which but from its connection and collateral circumstances, would not be important.&quot;

Colonel David Henley, Washington&#x27;s intelligence chief for a short period in 1778, received these instructions when he wrote to Washington for guidance: &quot;Besides communicating your information as it arises. ... you might make out a table or something in the way of columns, under which you might range, their magazines of forage, grain and the like, the different corps and regiments, the Works, were thrown up, their connexion, kind and extent, the officers commanding, with the numbers of guns &amp;ca. &amp;ca. This table should comprehend in one view all that can be learned from deserters, spies and persons who may come out from the enemy&#x27;s boundaries.&quot; (It was common practice to interrogate travelers from such British strongholds as New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.)

== Political action ==
=== France ===
While intelligence committees of the Continental Congress were meeting in Philadelphia, Arthur Lee was meeting in London with Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, the successful author of Le Barbier de Séville who was a French agent. Lee&#x27;s inflated reports of patriot strength, which either he fabricated for Beaumarchais&#x27; benefit or were provided by Lee&#x27;s regular correspondent, Samuel Adams, won the Frenchman to the American cause. Beaumarchais repeatedly urged the French Court to give immediate assistance to the Americans, and on February 29, 1776, addressed a memorial to Louis XVI quoting Lee&#x27;s offer of a secret long-term treaty of commerce in exchange for secret aid to the war of independence. Beaumarchais explained that France could grant such aid without compromising itself, but urged that &quot;success of the plan depends wholly upon rapidity as well as secrecy: Your Majesty knows better than any one that secrecy is the soul of business, and that in politics a project once disclosed is a project doomed to failure.&quot;

With the memorial, Beaumarchais submitted a plan proposing that he set up a commercial trading firm as a cover for the secret aid; he requested and was granted one million livres to establish a firm called Roderigue Hortalez et Cie for that purpose. Beaumarchais&#x27; memorial was followed by one of March 12, 1776, by the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Comte de Vergennes. Royal assent was granted, and by the time Silas Deane arrived in Paris, French arms and other aid was on its way to the revolutionaries. Deane expanded the relationship, working with Beaumarchais and other French merchants to procure ships, commission privateers, recruit French officers, and purchase French military supplies declared &quot;surplus&quot; for that purpose.

On September 26, 1776, the Congress elected three commissioners to the Court of France—Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Silas Deane—resolving that &quot;secrecy shall be observed until further Order of Congress; and that until permission be obtained from Congress to disclose the particulars of this business, no member be permitted to say anything more upon this subject, than that Congress have taken such steps as they judged necessary for the purpose of obtaining foreign alliance.&quot; Because of his wife&#x27;s illness, Jefferson could not serve, and Arthur Lee was appointed in his stead.

With Franklin&#x27;s arrival in France on November 29, 1776—the first anniversary of the founding of the Committee of Secret Correspondence—the French mission became an intelligence and propaganda center for Europe, an unofficial diplomatic representation, a coordinating facility for aid from America&#x27;s secret allies, and a recruiting station for such French officers as Lafayette and Johann de Kalb. In October 1777 the Continental Army won a crucial victory over the British at Saratoga, and on February 6, 1778, the French-American treaty of alliance was signed. On March 30, 1778, Franklin, Lee, and Deane were received at the French Court as representatives of the United States of America, and on July 7 Comte d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s fleet cast anchor in the Delaware River. France was now in the war; the mission to Paris had succeeded.

=== Spain and its colonies ===
Spain, at the urging of Vergennes, matched France&#x27;s one million lives for the operation of Hortalez et Cie. But that was not the beginning of secret Spanish aid. During the summer of 1776 Luis de Unzaga y Amezaga, the governor of New Spain at New Orleans, had privately delivered five tons of gunpowder, out of the King&#x27;s stores, to Captain George Gibson and Lieutenant Linn of the Virginia Council of Defense. The gunpowder moved up the Mississippi River under the protection of the flag of Spain and was used to thwart British plans to capture Fort Pitt.

Oliver Pollock, a New Orleans businessman, had interceded on behalf of the Virginians. When Bernardo de Galvez became governor of New Orleans, Pollock—who was soon appointed an agent of the Secret Committee there—worked closely with the young officer to provide additional supplies to the Americans. Galvez also agreed to grant protection to American ships while seizing British ships as smugglers and to allow American privateers to sell their seized wares at New Orleans. Havana, too, became a focal point for dispensing secret Spanish aid to the Americans. From Galvez, the revolutionaries received gunpowder and supplies for the George Rogers Clark expedition, and from Galvez&#x27; secret service fund came to the funds used by Colonel Clark for the capture of Kaskaskia and Vincennes. When Spain formally entered the war on the American side on June 21, 1779, Oliver Pollock—who suffered bankruptcy in funding the purchase of supplies for the cause of independence—rode as aide-de-camp to Galvez in the capture of Baton Rouge, Natchez, Mobile, and Pensacola.

=== The Caribbean ===
Another center of secret aid was St. Eustatia Island in the West Indies. A Dutch free port set in the midst of English, French, Danish and Spanish colonies, St. Eustatia (now Sint Eustatius) became—in the words of a British intelligence document of the period—&quot;the rendezvous of everything and everybody meant to be clandestinely conveyed to America.&quot; It was a major source of gunpowder for the American cause, and perhaps the safest and quickest means of communications between American representatives and agents abroad and with the Congress and others at home.

== Covert action ==

=== Bermuda ===
In July 1775 Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris worked out a plan in collaboration with Colonel Henry Tucker, the head of a distinguished Bermuda family, to obtain the store of gunpowder in the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda. To give Bermuda much-needed food in exchange for the powder, Congress resolved on July 15, 1775, to permit the exchange of food for guns and gunpowder brought by any vessel to an American port. On the night of August 14, 1775, two American ships kept a rendezvous with Colonel Tucker&#x27;s men off the coast of Bermuda and sent a raiding party ashore. An American sailor was lowered into the arsenal through an opening in the roof and opened the doors. The barrels of gunpowder were rolled to wait for Bermudian whaleboats and transported to the American ships. Twelve days later half of the powder was delivered to Philadelphia and a half to American forces at Charleston. America&#x27;s second covert action effort ended in failure. General Washington, hearing independently of the Bermuda powder, dispatched ships to purchase or seize it. Lacking a centralized intelligence authority, he was unaware of the previous success; when Washington&#x27;s ships arrived in Bermuda in October 1775, the gunpowder had been gone for two months and British ships patrolled Bermuda waters.

=== Canada ===
On the basis of information received by the Secret Correspondence Committee, on February 15, 1776, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, authorized a covert action plan to urge the Canadians to become a &quot;sister colony&quot; in the struggle against the British. A French printer was dispatched to Canada &quot;to establish a free press... for the frequent publication of such pieces as may be of service to the cause of the United Colonies.&quot; 

Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Chase, and Charles Carroll were appointed from the Congress to undertake the mission, and Father John Carroll was invited to join the team to prevail upon the Catholic clergy of Canada. The delegation was given a degree of authority over American expeditionary forces in Canada; it was empowered to raise six companies in Canada, and to offer sanctuary in the thirteen colonies &quot;for all those who have adhered to us.&quot; Excesses against the Canadian populace by the American military forces, the hostility of the clergy, and the inability of American commissioners to deliver little more than promises in exchange for Canadian defection, doomed the project. With the arrival of summer, both military and political action in Canada had ended in failure.

== Special operations ==
=== Benedict Arnold ===

After Benedict Arnold defected, several special operations, none successful, were mounted in an effort to capture him. In September 1780, Major Henry &quot;Light-Horse Harry&quot; Lee presented Washington with a plan to return the defector to American control and execute him. Washington approved the plan, but insisted that Arnold not be killed or injured in carrying it out, even at the risk of allowing him to escape. &quot;Public punishment,&quot; said Washington, &quot;is the sole object in view.&quot;

Lee&#x27;s sergeant major, John Champe from Loudoun County, Virginia, was assigned to this special mission. On the evening of October 19, 1780, however, Champe deserted to the British under a hail of gunfire. The official documents he carried and his cooperative attitude during interrogation convinced the British he was a genuine deserter. He was appointed sergeant major of Benedict Arnold&#x27;s legion, which included rebel deserters and Loyalists. Champe, now wearing a British uniform and having obtained freedom of movement in British-occupied New York City, made contact with American agents there and laid plans for Arnold&#x27;s capture. Arnold&#x27;s legion embarked for the Colony of Virginia on the night the operation was to take place, and the plan was aborted. Champe accomplished his other mission, namely finding out if other American officers were collaborating with the enemy. He found no evidence that any were.

In March 1781, an attempt to capture Arnold during his daily ride to the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia was foiled by the chance anchoring of some British ships in the area. A second plan, devised by Thomas Jefferson, called for General John Peter Muhlenberg to send hand-picked soldiers &quot;to seize and bring off this greatest of traitors&quot; at Portsmouth, Virginia. Unusual security precautions at the British outpost, however, thwarted the Jefferson plan.

=== Hostage taking ===
Recognizing the value of a royal hostage, Washington approved in 1782 a plan to capture the son of King George III, The Prince William (the future king, William IV), during the young naval officer&#x27;s posting to New York. The operation failed after British intelligence heard about it and the Prince increased security around himself. After William later became monarch, the American ambassador told him of the wartime plan and of Washington&#x27;s edict that, if the mission were successful, the young Prince should suffer no &quot;insult or indignity.&quot; Upon hearing the story, William IV responded: &quot;I am obliged to General Washington for his humanity, but I&#x27;m damned glad I did not give him an opportunity of exercising it towards me.&quot;

=== Privateering ===
On the high seas, British supply ships and troop ships often fell to American privateers operating under letters of marque and reprisal from the Continental Congress. Franklin, for example, ran a flotilla of Irish and French privateers from the American mission in Paris. Success in intercepting British vessels was so great that the British accused their captains of taking bribes from the Americans to surrender their ships. One privateer, operating under contract to Silas Deane and a French business associate and utilizing a French ship obtained by Benjamin Franklin, was the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, commanded by John Paul Jones.

=== Sabotage ===
Only one sabotage mission is known to have been launched in England. Sometime after his arrival in Paris, Silas Deane was visited by a young man named James Aitken, recently returned from America. Aitken produced crudely drawn but accurate plans of the Royal Navy Dockyards in England and proposed to sabotage them by utilizing a unique incendiary device of his own design. Deane engaged his services and issued Aitken a passport signed by French Foreign Minister Vergennes with instructions to French officials: &quot;We will and command you very expressly to let pass safely and freely, Mr. James Actzen, going to England, without giving him or suffering him any hindrance; but on the contrary giving every aid and assistance that he shall want or occasion for.&quot; In late November 1776 Aitken landed at Dover and, on December 7, he ignited a fire at the Portsmouth dockyard that burned from late in the afternoon until the following morning, destroying twenty tons of hemp, ten one-hundred-fathom (183 m) cables, and six tons of ship cordage. After failing to penetrate the security at Plymouth, Aitken proceeded to Bristol, where he destroyed two warehouses and several houses. On January 16, 1777, the British cabinet met in emergency session and urged immediate measures to locate the mysterious &quot;John the Painter&quot; (Aitken was a house painter). Guards were augmented at all military facilities and arsenals, and a reward was posted. By January 20 the cabinet, again in extraordinary session, discussed suspending habeas corpus and placing the country under martial law. Five days later the reward was increased to one thousand pounds, and newspapers reported panic throughout England. Aitken was soon apprehended, with a pistol and inflammables in his possession. He would not admit to the sabotage when interrogated, but eventually confided in a friendly American visitor who was secretly in the pay of the British. Based on these confidences, personal effects, including the passport from Vergennes, were located. His trial for arson in royal dockyards was speedy, and on March 10, 1777, Aitken went to the gallows at Portsmouth Dockyard, where his exploits had begun.

<text>Luamanuvao Dame Winifred Alexandra Laban (born 14 August 1955) is a former New Zealand politician. She served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Mana electorate, representing the Labour Party, and was the Labour Party&#x27;s spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs and for interfaith dialogue. Laban is the Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Pasifika) at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington and is a respected leader in the local Pasifika community.

==Early life==
Laban was born in Wellington on 14 August 1955 to Samoan parents, Ta&#x27;atofa Kenneth Laban and Emi Tunupopo. Laban&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Fauono Tunupopo Patu had been a member of the Samoan Legislative Assembly before independence in 1962, and on her paternal side her grandfather, Leutele Va’afusuaga Poutoa, served as a member of the first independent government of Samoa and was the Minister of Lands in that first democratically elected Samoan government.

Her parents were public servants in Samoa at the time they emigrated in 1954 to take up government positions in Wellington, New Zealand and also to ensure that any children they had gained New Zealand citizenship.
Laban grew up in Wainuiomata with her younger brother Ken Laban, who subsequently served as a policeman, a community worker, sports commentator and as a local body politician.

She was educated at Erskine College, and Wellington Girls&#x27; College from 1969 to 1971.
After leaving school, she worked as a family therapist and community development worker, for the Māori Affairs Department where she focused particularly on the Pasifika community of New Zealand.
Kara Puketapu the head of the Māori Affairs Department encouraged her to formally study social work, using an admission provision for the entry of over-20s. Laban graduated with a diploma in social work from the Victoria University of Wellington, and later in development studies from Massey University.

She later worked as a probation officer.

In 1981 she was involved in protests against the Springbok Tour of New Zealand.

==Member of Parliament==



When she was 34 she was asked by Sonja Davies to stand for parliament but had declined as she couldn&#x27;t stomach the policies known as “Rogernomics” that the Labour government was implementing at the time.

Laban changed her mind when in 1998 at the age of 44, she took a weeping call from an uncle who worked at Wainuiomata&#x27;s Kensons car part factory which was closing without warning or any redundancy being offered to the 100 workers who were losing their jobs.

Outraged by the impact of the closing and the 1991 Employment Contracts Act on Māori, Pacific Island and Pākehā working-class people coupled with the desire of many in the Pacific community to have a woman representing them in Parliament she put herself forward as a candidate for the Labour Party.

Laban was first elected to Parliament in the 1999 election as a list MP, becoming New Zealand&#x27;s first Pacific Island woman MP. In the 2002 election she successfully contested the Mana electorate, formerly held by Labour MP Graham Kelly. In 2005 she was re-elected by a majority of 6,734 votes She was Minister of Pacific Island Affairs (5 November 2007 – 19 November 2008). Labour was defeated in the 2008 election, depriving Laban of her ministerial role, but Laban retained her electorate seat and most of her majority.

In December 2009 her Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Amendment Bill, which would grant greater rights to the families of those seeking or undergoing treatment, was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot. The bill was defeated at its first reading.

On 10 August 2010 Laban announced she would resign from Parliament to take up a position as an assistant vice-chancellor at Victoria University of Wellington, leading to a by-election in the Mana electorate. She ceased being a member of parliament on 15 October 2010.

==Patronage and memberships==

In 2008 she was made Patron of the Cancer Society Relay for Life.
In 2013 she was made a Patron of the Wainuiomata Pasifika Education Success Initiative.
She was chair of the Pacific Arts Committee from 2013 to 2014. She was appointed to the Creative New Zealand Arts Council in 2014.
She has been a member of the National University of Samoa Council since 2012 and the Institute of Judicial Studies Board since 2011.
Since 2017 she has been a member of the Australasian Association for Institutional Research, the New Zealand Institute of Directors, the Commissioner of Police&#x27;s National Pacific Advisory Forum, and an Auditor for the Academic Quality Agency for New Zealand Universities.

Her husband Peter Swain coauthored the memoir of longtime Prime Minister of Samoa Tuilaʻepa Saʻilele Malielegaoi.

==Honours==

In 1992, Laban was bestowed the Samoan &quot;matai&quot; chiefly title &quot;Luamanuvao&quot; from the village of Vaiala, Vaimauga, in recognition of her work. In the 2011 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for services as a Member of Parliament. She was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2018 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for services to education and the Pacific community. At the 2020 Women of Influence Awards in New Zealand, Laban received a lifetime achievement award. In 2023, Laban received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Samoa.

<text>Melanie Susan Oxley is an Australian musician, singer-songwriter and primary school teacher. Oxley was a member of the dance pop group, The Sparklers (from 1985 to 1989), which in October 1988 released their debut album, &quot;Persuasion&quot;. 

Since 1989 Oxley teamed with keyboardist, Chris Abrahams to perform and record as a soul pop duo, Melanie Oxley &amp; Chris Abrahams. They have released four studio albums, &quot;Welcome to Violet&quot;, &quot;Coal&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem Bay&quot; and &quot;Blood Oranges&quot;. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993 &quot;Welcome to Violet&quot; was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Independent Release.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Melanie Susan Oxley is the daughter of Eric and Jan Oxley. Eric, an art teacher, was originally from Manchester and had migrated to Sydney before the Oxley family settled in the rural northern beach community of Kingscliff in 1965. Oxley&#x27;s older brothers are Peter and Jeremy Oxley (born ca. 1961), who founded Australian pop-rock band The Sunnyboys, and her younger brothers are Damien and Tim (singer, guitarist, drummer in The Humdingers, The Verys, The Dearhunters, and Roger Loves Betty).

===1984-1988: Paris Green and The Sparklers===
Oxley performed with Louis Tillett&#x27;s jazz influenced blues-rock band Paris Green in 1984, alongside Charlie Owen. She performed backing vocals on The Triffids&#x27; 1984 EP, &quot;Raining Pleasure&quot;. In early 1985 she worked for the Johnny Kannis Band with Richard Jakimyszyn on guitar, Tony Juke on keyboards and guitar, Kannis on lead vocals, Tony Robertson on bass guitar, Don Raffael on saxophone and Destroyer on drums. Also that year she was briefly in Sweet Nothing. Later that year, Oxley formed a dance pop band, The Sparklers, in Sydney with Chris Abrahams (ex-Benders) on keyboards; her brother Peter Oxley on bass guitar; Bill Bilson (The Sunnyboys) on drums; and Mark Walker (Hoi Polloi, Sweet Nothing) on guitar – who was replaced by Colin Bloxsom, a year later. The Sparklers released two singles before Abrahams left, he was replaced by Phil Grove. The Sparklers released an album, &quot;Persuasion&quot;, in October 1988 with Oxley writing all tracks except one co-written with Abrahams.
&quot;Persuasion&quot; was produced by Leszek Karski on Mighty Boys Records before the group disbanded in 1989. Oxley also performed backing vocals for Johanna Pigott&#x27;s band Scribble, appearing on their 1986 album &quot;Pop Art&quot;, as well as on Ed Kuepper&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Rooms of the Magnificent&quot;. Other 1980s work includes The Spliffs &quot;House of Seven&quot; (1988) and Penguins on Safari&#x27;s &quot;Normal Soon&quot; (1989).

===1989-present: Melanie Oxley &amp; Chris Abrahams===
In 1989 Oxley formed a soul pop duo, Melanie Oxley &amp; Chris Abrahams, with ex-The Sparklers bandmate, Abrahams (by then also a pianist-songwriter for experimental jazz trio, The Necks). She worked periodically with Abrahams, performing, writing songs and recording albums, while maintaining a career as a primary school teacher. In December 1990 the duo released a four-track EP, &quot;Resisting Calm&quot;, on Spiral Scratch Records. For the EP they used Tony Buck on drums, Mike Bukovsky on trumpet, Gerard Corben (ex-The Sparklers) on guitar, Guy Dickerson on guitar, Stuart Eadie on floor toms, Jackie Orszaczky on bass guitar and Lloyd Swanton on acoustic bass. It was co-produced by Abrahams and Oxley. National radio station, Triple J, placed the track, &quot;Benchtop&quot;, on high rotation – a live version appeared on the compilation album, &quot;Live at the Wireless 2&quot; (1991). Their debut studio album, &quot;Welcome to Violet&quot;, followed in October 1992 on Remote Control Records, which exemplified their &quot;moody, emotive soul/pop&quot; sound. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993, &quot;Welcome to Violet&quot; was nominated for Best Independent Release. On 3 October 1994, their second studio album, &quot;Coal&quot;, appeared.

Their third studio album, &quot;Jerusalem Bay&quot;, was issued in December 1998 and was produced by Oxley and Abrahams. Additional musicians included Mike Bukowski on trumpet (ex-Ten Part Invention) and Hamish Stuart on drums (Ayers Rock, Wig World, Catholics). The album includes a cover version of &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; written by Arthur Hamilton. &quot;Blood Oranges&quot; the fourth studio album was released in April 2003 on Vitamin Records. &quot;The Age&quot;″s Michael Dwyer described their sound as &quot;sophisticated, sometimes jazz-tinted pop&quot; while Oxley feels &quot;It&#x27;s quite a different album to &quot;Jerusalem Bay&quot;, and it was recorded differently. That one was much more organic and live. With &quot;Blood Oranges&quot;, Chris did a lot of work before we went into the studio, quite a lot of programming&quot;. Session musicians included Stuart, Michael Sheridan on guitar and Jonathan Zwartz on bass guitar. Vitamin Records promoted the album as being &quot;Coloured by a strange, at times, dark playfulness, [it] is dotted throughout with classic sounding songs drawn from a number of pop influences. Lyrically thoughtful, deceptively simple&quot;.

In April 2003 &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; John Shand reviewed their performance at The Basement, he found Oxley used &quot;a lot of breath aerating [her] lovely voice. Unlike, say, Renée Geyer, however, this does not make it husky, but creates a soft-edged, whispering quality, which remains unaffected by volume, and which suggests innocence and sensuality in equal measure&quot;. In October that year ABC Radio National broadcast &quot;South Island&quot; on &quot;The Listening Room&quot;; &quot;South Island&quot; was a joint project by Oxley (performer) with Abrahams (composer and performer) and Sherre DeLys (text and sound design). 

In January 2008 Oxley and Abraham provided &quot;a simply devastating performance of &#x27;Embedded&#x27;&quot; at a tribute concert for its deceased songwriter, David McComb of The Triffids. A documentary film, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Pleasure&quot; (2009), showcased the performances and included an interview with Oxley, it was screened at the Adelaide International Film Festival.

==Personal life==
As of July 2003 Melanie Oxley&#x27;s domestic partner is former drummer and television producer, Angus Millar. Oxley is a mother of three children and outside her musical career she is a primary school teacher who has taught at Newtown Public School, Annandale Public School and Summer Hill Public School in Sydney&#x27;s inner west.

<doc id="1075444" wikidata="Q1388984" url="?curid=1075444" title="Tango in the Night">
<text>Tango in the Night is the fourteenth studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 13 April 1987 by Warner Records. As a result of Lindsey Buckingham&#x27;s departure later that year, it is the fifth and final studio album with the band&#x27;s most successful lineup of Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Stevie Nicks, though Christine McVie would make guest appearances on the band&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;Say You Will&quot;. This lineup did not reconvene again for another album until 1997&#x27;s live album &quot;The Dance&quot;.

Produced by Buckingham with Richard Dashut, &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; began as one of Buckingham&#x27;s solo projects, but in 1985, the production had morphed into Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s next record. It contains several hit singles, including four US top 20 hits: &quot;Big Love&quot; ( 5), &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; (No. 19), &quot;Little Lies&quot; (No. 4), and &quot;Everywhere&quot; (No. 14). Two additional songs, &quot;Family Man&quot; (No. 90) and &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Midnight&quot;, were released as singles to lower chart success. &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; has sold over 15 million copies worldwide. In March 2017, remastered deluxe editions of &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; were released, the first as a double-CD set and the second as a 3CD/1DVD/1-LP boxset.

==Background==
After the completion of the Mirage Tour in 1982, four members of Fleetwood Mac released five solo albums, with varying degrees of success. Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, and Lindsey Buckingham each released one, while Stevie Nicks issued two. Buckingham described the band as being &quot;a bit fragmented&quot; during the mid-1980s.

In 1985, Christine McVie was asked to record a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; for the soundtrack of the movie &quot;A Fine Mess&quot;. Richard Dashut, who had engineered and produced &quot;Rumours&quot;, &quot;Tusk&quot;, and &quot;Mirage&quot;, was brought in to assist with the song&#x27;s production. Buckingham, Fleetwood, and John McVie were enlisted to supply the instrumentation. Greg Droman, a relatively new producer at the time, was asked to engineer the song after an encounter with Dashut at Rumbo Recorders. 

Although Christine McVie was not initially planning a reunion, she would later comment that:

&quot;I just thought that it was a good idea. It was a natural progression. We all got into the studio and started playing some of the old songs. We hadn&#x27;t been gathering dust as much as we thought. We decided to get serious about making another album.&quot;

A few weeks later, Droman worked with Buckingham on &quot;Time Bomb Town&quot; for the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film soundtrack. Buckingham retained Droman to engineer what was intended to be his third solo album, although the project eventually morphed into a Fleetwood Mac album once other members got involved.

Fleetwood Mac originally intended to hire an outside producer for the &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; recording sessions. They first worked with Nile Rodgers, but the collaboration fell through. Record producer Mo Ostin then paired the band with Jason Corsaro, who had worked with the Power Station. The band booked Studio One and rehearsed for a week without Stevie Nicks, who was in Australia touring with Tom Petty and Bob Dylan. Nothing came of these sessions, so Fleetwood Mac instead used the production team of Buckingham and Dashut, with Droman as an engineer.

==Recording==
After the release of &quot;Mirage&quot;, John McVie had spent much of his time sailing the Caribbean island of Saint Thomas and barely played bass in the years leading up to the making of &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;. In an attempt to be more productive in the studio, he quit drinking cold turkey, though this proved to be unsuccessful, and he grew concerned that he had lost his ability to play. Mick Fleetwood stated that his cocaine use during the recording of &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; was worse than the &quot;Rumours&quot; sessions; Buckingham placed a Winnebago in his driveway for Fleetwood and his friends when their drug use impeded productivity in the recording studio.

Dashut and Droman recalled that the album&#x27;s recording sessions were particularly tedious, even by Fleetwood Mac standards. The band recorded certain parts in half-speed to find suitable textures. This would double the song&#x27;s duration, which made for &quot;a brutal ten minutes to listen to&quot;, according to Droman. By recording parts in half-speed, they managed to make each song sound &quot;open and airy&quot;. &quot;When you record something really slow and you speed it up, all the harmonics get shifted up. You end up with this high end, this tinkly little high end, that wouldn&#x27;t exist [otherwise]. There&#x27;s not another way you could get that, at least back then.&quot; Buckingham created most of the album&#x27;s vocal harmonies through extensive overdubbing and also utilised the Fairlight CMI for additional sonic textures.

Although the record took eighteen months to complete, Stevie Nicks spent a total of two weeks in the studio with the band. She was promoting &quot;Rock a Little&quot; throughout this period and sent the band demos while she was on tour. One of those songs, &quot;Welcome to the Room... Sara&quot;, was inspired by her thirty-day stay at the Betty Ford Center to overcome her cocaine addiction in October 1986 (Nicks used the pseudonym &quot;Sara Anderson&quot; when she checked into the facility).

When Nicks did go to the studio, she often felt unmotivated: &quot;I can remember going up there and not being happy to even be there... I didn&#x27;t go very often.&quot; Vocal sessions took place in Buckingham&#x27;s master bedroom, where Nicks frequently recorded her parts for Buckingham and McVie&#x27;s songs under the influence of alcohol; Buckingham deleted most of Nicks&#x27; vocals after she left the studio. She later said, &quot;I&#x27;m not blaming him for that because I&#x27;m sure they totally sucked. Vocals done when you&#x27;re crazy and drinking a cup of brandy probably aren&#x27;t usually going to be great.&quot;

On certain songs, Buckingham &quot;pull[ed] performances out of words and lines&quot; from various sources to make some of the vocals sound like Nicks. During the album&#x27;s sequencing, &quot;When I See You Again&quot; was planned to be the closing track, but the band deemed it &quot;too down and depressing&quot;, so Christine McVie took an existing instrumental track from Buckingham and wrote some words to accompany it, resulting in the creation of &quot;You and I, Part II&quot;.

==Composition==
Some of Buckingham&#x27;s compositions on &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, including &quot;Big Love&quot; and &quot;Family Man&quot;, were originally developed for his shelved solo album. These songs were mostly complete by the time Buckingham presented them to the band, although he recalled that &quot;Family Man&quot; was &quot;sweetened up&quot; during the mixing process. The band also sifted through Buckingham&#x27;s demos and selected &quot;Caroline&quot;, which he had written a few years prior.

Three songs on the album were co-written by Buckingham and Christine McVie. McVie remarked that the two &quot;didn&#x27;t sit down at a piano and decide the chords together&quot; but believed that the creative process during &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; was more collaborative than their past efforts.

==Outtakes==
Four songs from the &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; sessions did not make the final album cut and subsequently became B-sides. &quot;You and I (Part I)&quot; was the B-side to the single release of &quot;Big Love&quot;. &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; was released with the Nicks-penned instrumental track &quot;Book of Miracles&quot; as its B-side. This eventually became the song &quot;Juliet&quot; on Nicks&#x27; 1989 solo album, &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror&quot;. McVie&#x27;s &quot;Ricky&quot; was the B-side to &quot;Little Lies&quot; and Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Down Endless Street&quot; was issued as the B-side to &quot;Family Man&quot;. All these tracks would eventually be released in the deluxe version of the album, with &quot;You and I&quot; parts I and II being combined into one song on disc two of the collection.

Nicks contributed three additional songs that failed to make the final album. &quot;What Has Rock &amp; Roll Ever Done for You?&quot; was considered, but it was replaced by &quot;When I See You Again&quot;. &quot;Ooh My Love&quot;, like &quot;Juliet&quot;, eventually made its way onto &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror&quot; (with its demo also being included on the deluxe edition of &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;), while &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; remains unreleased. &quot;I still want to record it&quot;, she explained. &quot;The song has its really good moments but it&#x27;s not good enough to go out as that version.&quot; 

Two tracks, both co-written by McVie and Buckingham, also failed to appear on the final product: &quot;Where We Belong&quot;, which incorporates Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;folksy fingerpicking&quot; and McVie&#x27;s &quot;brilliant pop simplicity&quot;, was written as a duet but was later abandoned in favour of other songs. The other, &quot;Special Kind of Love&quot;, was described by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as a &quot;completely developed Buckingham song&quot;. Both tracks later appeared on the deluxe edition of &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;.

==Cover art==
The album&#x27;s cover is a painting by Australian artist Brett-Livingstone Strong that was hanging in Buckingham&#x27;s house. Titled &quot;Homage à Henri Rousseau&quot;, it is an homage to the 19th-century French painter Henri Rousseau, emulating his colorful jungle theme on works such as &quot;The Snake Charmer&quot; and &quot;The Repast of the Lion&quot;. 

According to Paolo Ragusa of &quot;Consequence&quot;, the painting mimics Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;studious approach to depicting motion and activity within a still, naturalistic container&quot;. He notes that although &quot;the jungle flora, the twinkling water, and the distant animals&quot; evoke a sense of &quot;dreamy wanderlust and desire&quot;, the image is &quot;frozen and vast&quot;, as though &quot;what can disturb its peace is the arrival of a warm breeze&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s Ivy Nelson described the artwork as &quot;so lush and romantic that it walks a fine line between formal elegance and kitsch, blending the terrestrial with the celestial&quot;. She regarded it as an &quot;accurate illustration&quot; of the album&#x27;s sound design and of the &quot;glitterings and humid shimmers that Buckingham placed in the songs&quot;.

The painting was also used as the cover art for &quot;Big Love&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single.

==Release==
With pressure on Buckingham to keep the project focused and moving forward, things came to a head shortly after the release of &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, in April 1987. At a band meeting at Christine McVie&#x27;s house to discuss the accompanying tour, he announced his departure, which infuriated Nicks. She physically attacked Buckingham, and the ensuing fight between the ex-lovers spilled into the street.

Fleetwood noted that the album &quot;was well received. Somewhat sadly, the kudos of that was never really fully attributed to Lindsey because he wasn&#x27;t present... He was coerced and persuaded to do that album—mainly by me. And, to his credit, he put aside everything that he&#x27;d dreamt of doing, including making his own album, for Fleetwood Mac, but then realised that he&#x27;d made a mistake... Lindsey was not being heard. We just didn&#x27;t get it.&quot;

Buckingham partially attributed his decision to leave Fleetwood Mac to the rigours of touring, which he believed would have exacerbated the interpersonal turbulence experienced in the studio. He later said, &quot;Compared to making an album, in my experience, going on the road will multiply the craziness by times five. I just wasn&#x27;t up for that.&quot; He later reflected that at the time of the album&#x27;s release, &quot;everybody was leading their lives in a way that they would not be too proud of today&quot;. Following Buckingham&#x27;s departure, guitarists Rick Vito and Billy Burnette were hired to replace him on the subsequent tour.

===Deluxe edition===
A deluxe edition of &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; was issued on 31 March 2017, to celebrate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Included in the set were three CDs, divided into the original album with remastered sound, rare and unreleased recordings, and 12&quot; remixes; a 180-gram vinyl LP; and a DVD, with different music videos and a high-resolution stereo version of the album.

Disc two of the collection features the B-sides &quot;Ricky&quot;, &quot;Down Endless Street&quot;, and &quot;Book of Miracles&quot;; both halves of &quot;You and I&quot;, released and combined for the first time; and demos, alternate versions, and other recordings. The third disc features multiple remixes of &quot;Big Love&quot;, &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;, &quot;Little Lies&quot;, &quot;Family Man&quot;, and &quot;Everywhere&quot;, either done by Arthur Baker or John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Tango in the Night&quot; has mostly received positive reviews. Alex Henderson of AllMusic praised Buckingham&#x27;s contributions to the album, saying that his &quot;thoughtful use of synthesizers were a major asset&quot; and that he &quot;consistently [brought] out the best in his colleagues on this superb album&quot;. Steve Hochman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also singled out Buckingham&#x27;s production work, saying that &quot;relatively conventional material [such] as McVie&#x27;s straight rocker, &#x27;Isn&#x27;t It Midnight&#x27; and Nicks&#x27; dreamy &#x27;When I See You Again&#x27; benefit from the subtly bizarre undercurrents Buckingham creates.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; described the album as &quot;a perfect Mac showcase for McVie and Buckingham&#x27;s musical partnership&quot;.

Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the album &quot;seems even more deserving of the &#x27;flawed masterpiece&#x27; tag than &quot;Tusk&quot;&quot;. Ivy Nelson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was complimentary of Buckingham and McVie&#x27;s songs but reserved some criticism for Nicks, saying, &quot;Her voice, invariably hoarse after years of cocaine abuse, often warps or fails the already incomplete material.&quot; Robert Christgau thought that the album was an improvement over &quot;Mirage&quot; but failed to live up to the quality of the band&#x27;s 1975 eponymous release and &quot;Rumours&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Tango in the Night&quot; is the band&#x27;s second-biggest-selling studio album after the phenomenally successful &quot;Rumours&quot;, which was released ten years earlier. The intervening albums, &quot;Tusk&quot; (1979) and &quot;Mirage&quot; (1982), although big sellers in key territories, had not matched their predecessor&#x27;s huge success. &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; was a worldwide hit, with several singles becoming popular all over the world. Christine McVie&#x27;s &quot;Little Lies&quot; and &quot;Everywhere&quot; in particular appear on several 1980s compilation albums.

The album was a success in the United States, where it peaked at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for three weeks, spending more than seven months within the top 20 and more than ten months within the top 40. It was certified 3× Platinum in October 2000 for selling three million copies in the US. Four singles from the album reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 20: &quot;Big Love&quot; (No. 5), &quot;Little Lies&quot; (No. 4), &quot;Everywhere&quot; (No. 14), and &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; (No. 19). The album was particularly successful in the UK, where it reached no. 1 three times during 1987–88 for a total of five weeks and spent more than eight months within the top 10 of the UK albums chart. It is the seventh-biggest-selling album of the 1980s in the UK, being certified 8× Platinum (2.4 million copies), and it is still currently one of the UK&#x27;s top 100 best-selling albums of all time. Three singles were top 10 hits in Britain: &quot;Big Love&quot; (No. 9), &quot;Little Lies&quot; (No. 5), and &quot;Everywhere&quot; (No. 4). A total of six singles were eventually taken from the album over a period of fifteen months. The album spent 115 weeks in the top 75 of the UK Albums Chart.

&quot;Big Love&quot;, &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;, &quot;Little Lies&quot;, &quot;Family Man&quot;, and &quot;Everywhere&quot; were all released as extended 12&quot; remixes in most territories.

<text>The Center for Advanced Studies on Puerto Rico and the Caribbean (Spanish: &quot;Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y El Caribe&quot; or simply CEAPRC) is a private institute housed in the former San Ildefonso Conciliar Seminary in Old San Juan, San Juan, Puerto Rico that offers graduate studies in arts and philosophy. The center is currently accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and it publishes La &quot;Revista del Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe&quot;.

==History==
===Under Ricardo Alegría===
It was incorporated on February 28, 1968, by Pablo Casals, Luis Muñoz Marín, Roberto Busó Carrasquillo, and Jaime Benítez. However, it remained inactive and without organization until 1976, when Ricardo Alegría made a request before the Council on Higher Education of Puerto Rico to transform the center into an academic institution.
With the CEAPRC, Alegría intended for a small institution that possessed an intimate environment, with intellectual growth and the promotion of a region-wide Caribbean emphasis as its focus. In her 2002 book, Carmen Dolores Hernández credited the CEAPRC (which she labels an &quot;experimental&quot; institution &quot;unparalleled in the island or the Antilles&quot;) with breaking away from the &quot;cultural euro centrism&quot; of higher education in Puerto Rico. The curriculum was intended to be different from that of the universities. Puerto Rico and the Antilles received a central role with historic archeology, local literature and history in the spotlight. Besides numerous local sites, archeological digs were also held by students in the Dominican Republic and Cuba. Foreign professors such as Irving Rouse, Peter Roe, Mario Veloz Maggiolo, Sally Price and Lourdes Domínguez also collaborated with the CEAPRC. Students were allowed to take courses from other universities. On at least one occasion, a course was added due to student initiative.

The institution has had collaboration agreements with Universidad San Carlos (Guatemala), Universidad Autónoma (Dominican Republic, which included joint work with professors José Alcántara Almánzar, Pedro Vergés, Carlos Andújar and Marcio Veloz Maggiolo) and Universidad de Veracruz (Mexico). The classes of Puerto Rican Literature and History, Puerto Rican Society, Puerto Rican the Caribbean during the XX Century and Puerto Rican Culture were mandatory, while several electives involving literature, cinema, racial studies, law, Arts and other practices were offered.
The CEAPRC&#x27;s faculty worked on a contractual basis, allowing a revolving door of professors to come and go. During its early years it grew to include figures like Arturo Morales Carrión, José Arsenio Torres, Juan Rodríguez Cruz, Eugenio Fernández Méndez, Luis Díaz Soler, José Ramón de la Torre, María Teresa Babín, Carmelo Rosario Natal, Carmen M. Ramos de Santiago, Francisco López Cruz, Lidio Cruz Monclova, Andrés Sánchez Tarniella, Ernesto Jaime Ruíz de la Mata—a member of the short-lived surrealist group El Mirador Azul, Edgar Martínez Masdeu, Gervasio García, Arturo Santana, Héctor Campos Parsi, Luis Nieves Falcón and Esther Melón. Local figures such as Mela Pons (Alegría&#x27;s wife) and Juan Antonio Corretjer, were involved in hosting conferences. Alegría himself taught the Culture of Puerto Rico course for decades. His work with the CEAPRC reached foreign academics such as Ángel Rama, who on August 10, 1983, noted in a letter that it had been a topic of discussion in a reunion held between him and Maldonado Denia at Paris. During Alegría&#x27;s tenure as director, the institution had an &quot;open doors&quot; policy. Among those that the CEAPRC has hosted is a chief of the Soshone tribe.

Collaboration with foreign institutions brought the likes of Irving Rouse (Yale), Douglas Newton (Metropolitan Museum), Gordon Willey (Harvard), Jean-Batiste Romain (State University of Haiti), George Kubler (Yale), Nina S. de Friedman (Instituto de Antropología de Colombia), Eduardo Arcila Farías (Colegio de México), William Bascom (University of California), Manuel Moreno Fraginals (Universidad de la Havana), Wande Abimbola (University of Ife), Carlos Rama (Universidad de Barcelona) and Manuel García Arévalo (Universidad Nacional de Santo Domingo). Since then, Ángel López Cantós, Antonio Lorente, Pedro Vergés, Lourdes Domínguez, Lorenzo Rubio, Jesús Urrea, Juan Tena Ibarra, Demetrio Ramos, Jorge Febles and Lucio Mijares Pérez, among others have served as invited professors.

The CEAPRC created the slideshows &quot;El arte de los aborígenes de Puerto Rico&quot;, &quot;Las Artes populares de Puerto Rico&quot;, &quot;La catedral de San Juan&quot;, &quot;La Capilla del Santo Cristo de la Salud&quot;, &quot;La Iglesia de San José&quot;, &quot;El pintor José Campeche&quot; and &quot;El pintor Francisco Oller Cestero&quot; and the short films &quot;La vida de Cristo según el santero Florencio Cabán&quot; (directed by Amílcar Tirado, winner of the 1979 Golden Eagle Award of the Non-Theatrical Event Council (Spanish: Consejo sobre Eventos Internacionales no Teatrales), &quot;Don Tomás, el alfarero de Las Piedras&quot;, &quot;Juan Alindato y las máscaras de Ponce&quot;, &quot;Las tejedoras de sombreros de paja de Cabo Rojo&quot;, &quot;Cuando llegaron los indios de Boriquen&quot;, &quot;La cestería en Puerto Rico&quot;, &quot;El Gagá de Similá&quot;, &quot;Vudú en la República Dominicana&quot;, &quot;Serie de Maestros Artesanos&quot; (José Arsenio Torres) are also part of its collection. All mentions of the Antillean natives by foreign historians were compiled, taking 25 years to complete in the &quot;Crónicas de los indios de las Antillas&quot;.
During the 1976–80 years the ICP grew politicized, while the CEAPRC focused on Puerto Rican culture. In 1978, the CEAC entered alliances with Temple University and the Universidad de Valladolid.

In 1981, Alegría proposed the creation of a student magazine, &quot;Caribe&quot;, published on a biannual basis. That same year, the Catholic Church sponsored a course about its history at Puerto Rico, Cátedra Juan Alejo Arizmendi. In 1982, Alegría established an exchange collaboration involving the Academia de Ciencias of Cuba. Since the CEAPRC had its own editorial, it published the work of figures like Arturo Morales Carrión, some of the master&#x27;s thesis and historic documents. Through it Alegría published &quot;La vida de Jesucristo según el santero puertorriqueño Florencio Cabán&quot; and &quot;Primeras representaciones gráficas del indio americano (1493–1523)&quot;. Other publications include Osiris Delgado&#x27;s &quot;El pintor Francisco Oller y Cestero&quot;, Félix Ojeda Reyes&#x27; &quot;La manigua en París: correspondencia diplomática de Ramón E. Betances&quot; and Flor Piñero de Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Arturo Schomburg: un puertorriqueño descubre el legado histórico del negro&quot;.

The loan of Casa Blanca by the ICP was of only $1 per year. As the agreement was about to end, rumors circled that the Romero Barceló administration intended to close down the CEAPRC, opposing the frequent presence of political opponents within the premises. The institution had already face budge cuts when the new administration of the ICP objected to give it $6,000 from the Fundación Nacional de las Artes. Alegría, however, warned Rafael Rivera García of the Office of Cultural Affairs that he would have to be ousted from Casa Blanca by the police, but ultimately decided to move after new ICP director Leticia del Rosario intended to raise the loan to recover the $6,000. Having participated in the restoration of the San José Church since 1977, Alegría negotiated the abandoned Seminario Conciliar building for the CEAPRC from cardinal Luis Aponte Martínez, offering to restore it as well (in exchange, the institution didn&#x27;t have to pay loan for some years, the specific quantity later being revised by a Church appraiser). The estimate of the project was $4,000,000 but Alegría recycled materials from other sources and completed it for $600,000. After the process was completed in November 1986, the CEAPRC moved to the building. The CEAPRC also received donations from citizens for particular uses.

In 1982, it received recognition by the Middle States Association, which was suspicious about the $650 salary that the director (Alegría) was receiving since it was improbable that his successor would agree to that sum. Despite this, Alegría considered the intervention of the federal entity counterintuitive given the topic of study, but allowed it so that the students could receive additional benefits. The restoration of the Seminario Conciliar began in 1984. After moving to its new base, the Aula Magna was used for cultural activities. A program of public conferences on Puerto Rican and Caribbean topics that was opened also held its events there. The old refectory was also converted into an exhibition room. The classrooms were named after figures like Eugenio María de Hostos, Roman Baldorioty de Castro, José Campeche, José Julián Acosta and Alejandro Tapia. In 1985, Alegría began publishing &quot;La Revista del Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe&quot;, emphasizing an academic approach. The CEAPRC also produced slideshows in collaboration with the Fundación Puertorriqueña de las Humanidades for educational use. By the early 2000s, nine documentaries had been completed.
A Middle States evaluation team reviewed the status in 1987, considering the CEAPRC an &quot;institution with [...] a well-defined view of itself&quot; when comparing it to other Universities and colleges. In July 1987, the CEAC collaborated with the Puerto Rican Cultural Heritage House of New York in a course offered from teachers from the diaspora. When interviewed Alegría considered his work at the CEAPRC a continuation of his previous work at the ICP, intending to create the professionals that were needed in the kind of projects that were undertaken there.

In May 1987, a restored chapel was inaugurated within the premises of the CEAPRC. In 1989, Alegría loaned several pieces of his collection for an Antillean masks exhibit. In 1990 Arturo Schomburg and Casa de las Américas exhibits were organized. In 1991, the institution began offering its first doctorate degree. Exhibitions on the archeological work of Miguel Rodríguez and Cuban slavery was also hosted. In 1992, Puerto Rican engravings and several books from the Guillermo Esteves Volckers collection on the topic of Christopher Columbus were exhibited. The Museo de las Américas, inaugurated during this year, was viewed by Alegría as the culmination of his life&#x27;s work, bringing together several past initiatives. In 1993, the XV International Archeology Congress was held at Puerto Rico. Exhibits on Caribbean archeology and local academic magazines were also held.

In June 1993, budget cuts by the Pedro Rosselló administration ended a yearly legislative donation of $100,000 when the House of Representatives eliminated it after Carlos Juan López Nieves criticized that Alegría was personally involved with the CEAPRC and it had &quot;become [his] business&quot;. The director didn&#x27;t take the claims lightly. The following month, the Senate of Puerto Rico restored $63,000 of the total sum. In 1994, exhibits were held on the topics of Pablo de la Torriente Brau and Puerto Rican children&#x27;s literature. In 1995, the CEAPRC entered a collaboration with the Universidad de Sevilla to offer a joint doctorate in American History. In 1996, Alegría and Pons loaned several pieces from their Talla de Santos woodwork collection to the Museo de las Américas, as part of the institutions second permanent exhibit. Between 1997 and 1998, the municipalities of Caguas and San Juan offered grants to students. On the 100th anniversary of the Spanish–American War, an exhibit on life before 1898 was held. In 1997, the government eliminated the recurrent UPR donation to the CEAPRC. The following year, the UPR made additional cuts in the collaboration for publications, investigations and visiting professors. In response, Alegría auctioned pieces from his private collection to gather funds, gathering $40,000. In 1999, students from the CEAPRC participated in excavations at Havana.

Entering the new millennium, efforts were made to establish more links with the Dominican Republic and Cuba in the form of exchange programs. For Alegría, this was a cultural response to the concept of an Antillean Confederation. By this time, the CEAPRC&#x27;s library had grown to include 14,000 books and hosted the Guillermo Esteves Volckers, Rosa Estades and Monelisa Pérez Marchand collections, as well as audiovisual content and documentation. Some effort to modernize the institution&#x27;s classic work took place with the digitalization of the he &quot;Crónicas de los indios de las Antillas&quot; initiative.

Alegría left his role in the CEAPRC in 2001, being replaced by Juan Manuel González Lamela as director and Juan Rodríguez Cancel as Dean of Academic Affairs. The institution had an endowment fund of $2,250,000 at the moment. By this time, figures like Juan Manuel García Passalaqua, Enrique Laguerre, Luis De la Rosa, Guillermo Baralt, Blanca Silvestrini, José Ferrer Canales, Ana Sagardía, Federico Acevedo, Ramón Luis Acevedo, Carmen Isabel Raffuci, Antonio J. González and Silvia Álvarez Curbelo had served as professors in the CEAPRC. In April 2001, the government promised an improvement of $100,000 in the assignment to the institution to commemorate Alegría&#x27;s 80th birthday. The institution was one of 30 that joined in the celebrations surrounding this commemoration.

<text>Graham Desmond Kelly (born 9 May 1941) is a former New Zealand politician.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Kelly was born in Wellington on 9 May 1941. He married and had five children.

Kelly was trade unionist and was employed by the Clerical Workers&#x27; Union until 1973 when he became secretary of the Shop Employees&#x27; Union.

===Member of Parliament===


As a trade union member he became involved in the Labour Party, joining the party in 1963 and was a longtime member of the electorate committee. In the lead up to the 1987 general election he stood as a candidate to replace Gerry Wall, the retiring MP for , as the Labour candidate. In a highly contested selection meeting Kelly was chosen ahead of former All Black and local regional councillor Ken Gray. The selection was criticised by local residents who were critical of Kelly not living in the electorate and suspicions of media reports around an organised campaign to select trade unionists for all open safe seats ahead of the 1987 election. Kelly dismissed the criticism of his and other unionists selections stating he was &quot;his own person&quot; and his background in unions motivated him to be a representative of working people in the area. He also pledged to move from his home in Khandallah to the Porirua area.

He was elected and served as MP for Porirua from 1987 until the 1996 election, when he became MP for the new seat of Mana. He was among several backbenchers elected in 1987 that opposed the Labour government&#x27;s controversial Rogernomics reforms. He opposed the introduction of Goods and Services Tax before entering parliament and after being elected opposed the proposed flat tax rate, arguing each unfairly distributed taxation burdens on to working class people. He was also critical of how independent cabinet decision making was and campaigned for more substantive input into decisions by the party caucus.

In November 1990 he was appointed as Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for Fisheries and Senior Citizens by Labour leader Mike Moore. Kelly supported Helen Clark in her successful leadership challenge to Moore after the election. Under Clark he lost the Senior Citizens portfolio while retaining Fisheries and additionally appointed Shadow Minister of Broadcasting from 1993 to 1996. From 1996 to 1999 his responsibilities shifted again and he was Shadow Minister of Housing and Overseas Aid.

In the 2002 election, he did not stand as an electorate candidate, standing as a list MP and allowing Luamanuvao Winnie Laban to contest Mana. On 29 July 2003, however, he left Parliament in order to take up a position as High Commissioner to Canada. His list seat was taken by the next candidate on Labour&#x27;s 2002 party list, Moana Mackey.

===High Commissioner to Canada===
In 2005, Kelly made remarks to a Canadian governmental panel which were regarded by some in New Zealand as offensive to Māori and various immigrant communities. Calls were made for his resignation, and the government criticised Kelly for his comments, for which he apologised.

===Later career===
Kelly is currently the president of the Association of Former Members of Parliament.

==Honours==
In the 2004 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Kelly was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services.

He was the parliamentary leader of reformists&#x27; Hope fraction in the Iranian Parliament, representing Tehran, Rey, Shemiranat and Eslamshahr. Aref has also been heading the Reformists&#x27; Supreme Council for Policymaking since its establishment in 2015.

He was also the second first vice president from 2001 to 2005 under Mohammad Khatami and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He previously served as Minister Information and Communications Technology and head of Management and Planning Organization in Khatami&#x27;s first cabinet. He was a member of Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution until 2021. He is also an electrical engineer and a professor at University of Tehran and Sharif University of Technology. He was a candidate in the 2013 presidential election but withdrew his candidacy in order to give the reformist camp a better chance to win.

==Early life and education==

Aref was born on 19 December 1951 in Yazd. His father, Mirza Ahmad Aref, was a famous businessman.

He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electronics engineering from the University of Tehran, and a master&#x27;s degree and a PhD in electrical and communication engineering from Stanford University in 1975, 1976 and 1980, respectively. His PhD thesis was on the information theory of networks, supervised by Thomas M. Cover. He introduced and analyzed deterministic relay networks which is later termed as Aref Networks. During his education at Tehran University, he led many protests and was arrested by SAVAK prior to the Iranian Revolution.

==Career==
During his political career, Aref has held important positions in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Following the Islamic Revolution, he began his political career. His first major political post was in 1981 when he became vice president of communication company. He later became acting president of the company in 1983 and became deputy minister of science on the following year. Aref was a faculty member of Isfahan University of Technology until 1994.

Aref, who was a professor at University of Tehran, was elected as its chancellor in 1994. He began his career with creating Faculty of Social Sciences and also Institute of Geophysics. After his appointment as minister of technology, Aref was resigned as chancellor of the Tehran University in 1997.

After Mohammad Khatami was elected as President of Iran, he nominated Aref as the minister of post, telegraph, and telephone that was later renamed to minister of communications and information technology. He became the first head of management and planning organization in 2000 after resigned as Minister of Communication.
Khatami was reelected in 2001 and his former vice president Hassan Habibi resigned immediately after the election. After Habibi&#x27;s resignation, he appointed Aref as his First Vice President.

He was nominated for parliamentary election of 2008 as the reformist front&#x27;s first in the list but he withdrew to protest the rejection of some candidates by the Guardian Council. In June 2013, Aref announced that he together with other reformist figures was planning to launch a national party, namely Hope of Iran. On the other hand, Iran&#x27;s president-elect Hassan Rouhani stated that Aref will be one of his cabinet members. However, Aref rejected Rouhani&#x27;s invite for a political post (Vice Presidency or Ministry of Science) to focus on his party&#x27;s establishment. He also announced his interest in becoming one of Rouhani&#x27;s advisers in politics and human rights.

===2013 presidential election===


Aref was one of the potential candidates for the presidential elections held in June 2013. He said that he would not stand if Khatami ran but after Khatami declined, Aref announced that he would run in the election. He registered on 11 May 2013 and was confirmed by the Guardian Council. His major goals were lowering the unemployment rate and resolving high inflation. He pledged an extra 1 million jobs annually, which would include 200 thousand jobs from tourism development. He also added that if elected, his administration would bolster Iran&#x27;s international relations and would find a &quot;political solution&quot; to closing the &quot;[nuclear] dossier once and for all&quot;. Aref said he would remain &quot;committed to the law&quot; throughout the election process, promising to implement an economic plan to propel the country out of inflation and to achieve development and progress. Aref censured the foreign policy of the Ahmadinejad&#x27;s administration, vowing to improve Iran&#x27;s diplomatic ties with other countries if elected president. He added that the next administration can have friendly ties with the world and improve the conditions in the country through such relations. Aref also said he would pursue and implement plans to further the presence and participation of the youth in various arenas of the country. Vowing to tackle unemployment, Aref said he aimed all-out development in various political, cultural, economical and social fields.
&quot;By implementing the subsidy reform plan I will put bread on the tables. I have come to eradicate inflation and create one million job opportunities every year&quot;,

Aref also said he is a reformist and reform means safeguarding the ideals of the Islamic Revolution, accountability and encouraging popular participation. He also called for investigation of alleged fraud in the 2009 election and trial of effects in Death of Neda Agha Soltan and other deaths in the protests.

Aref announced his decision to drop out of the election in a statement issued late on 11 June, in which he said the decision was made after he received suggestions from former President Mohammad Khatami, who advised to stand aside. He also called on the Iranian people to vote en masse in the upcoming presidential election to create a political epic and maintain the dignity of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

===2016 legislative election===
On 4 November 2014, Aref announced he would run for Parliament of Iran in the 2016 election from Tehran, Rey, Shemiranat and Eslamshahr district. He officially ran for the seat on 22 December 2015. He was also named as the Pervasive Coalition of Reformists&#x27; head list.

<text>, formerly known as , is a smart card using RFID developed by the Tobacco Institute of Japan (TIOJ), the , and the for introduction in 2008. Following its introduction, the card is necessary in order to purchase cigarettes from vending machines in Japan. The name &quot;Taspo&quot; is a portmanteau for .

The group announced plans for development of the Tobacco Card in 2001. The stated aim is to reduce smoking by underaged people. Testing began the following year, and a second round of testing followed in 2004. 

Details of the card were announced in 2005. The card incorporates an integrated circuit that contains information about the age of the holder. Card issuance is restricted so that only adults aged 20 and over may acquire the cards. The cards are contactless, so that vending machines will be able to read them without contact. The cards are able to store value, giving purchasers the option to pay by card or by cash. Users are able to add more value at vending machines.

Consumers can apply for the cards by filling out a form available at tobacco retailers and mailing it, along with a copy of a verifiable identification document (driver&#x27;s license, health-insurance card, etc.) and a facial photo to TIOJ. No fees are required to obtain the card. Cardholders can cancel lost or stolen cards by contacting TIOJ to remotely disable the cards&#x27; use at vending machines. 

The final pilot program began in March 2008, and was phased in after that, becoming operational nationwide by 1 July 2008.

<doc id="1075492" wikidata="Q6886402" url="?curid=1075492" title="Moana Mackey">
<text>Moana Lynore Mackey (born 28 February 1974) is a New Zealand politician and has represented the New Zealand Labour Party in the New Zealand Parliament from 2003 until 2014. She has Māori, Irish, Scottish and Spanish ancestry.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Auckland, New Zealand, and raised in Gisborne, Mackey attended Mangapapa Primary School, Ilminster Intermediate and Lytton High School. While in high school, Mackey would participate in Young Labour, the New Zealand Youth Orchestra and Youth Parliament. After leaving high school, she attended Victoria University of Wellington from 1993, graduating with a degree in biochemistry and molecular biology. Remaining in the Wellington area, she worked as a scientist, leading a team at an environmental laboratory in Lower Hutt and from 2001 to 2004 was a member of the Petone Community Board.

From 1999 to 2000, Moana Mackey served as President of Young Labour. She also worked in the Trade Union movement.

== Member of Parliament ==


Mackey entered Parliament on 29 July 2003 through the Labour party list after Graham Kelly vacated his list seat. Her mother, Janet Mackey, also sat as a Labour MP until 2005 – the two formed the first mother-daughter pair in New Zealand parliamentary history. In the election that year, Janet Mackey retired from politics, and Moana Mackey contested but lost the East Coast electorate seat (formerly held by her mother) to National Party candidate, Anne Tolley by 1,219 votes. However, she returned to Parliament as a List MP. Mackey unsuccessfully contested East Coast again in the 2008 general election, losing to Tolley by 6,413 votes. Mackey again returned to Parliament as a list MP for the Labour Party.

Mackey was not placed high enough on Labour&#x27;s list to return to Parliament following the election to be allocated a seat following a drop in support for Labour. In February 2017, Labour list MP Jacinda Ardern won the 2017 Mount Albert by-election, which allowed the party to bring a new list MP to parliament. Mackey was the second-highest ranked Labour candidate not to enter parliament at the 2014 election. The person higher, Maryan Street, announced she would decline the chance to return to Parliament. Mackey likewise declined the option to re-enter Parliament.

== Post politics ==
Since 2015 Mackey has been employed in several advisory roles in Wellington City Council&#x27;s city planning team.

<doc id="1075495" wikidata="Q5163150" url="?curid=1075495" title="Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico">
<text>The Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music () is a public conservatory in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It has hosted a number of international musicians as students as well as faculty, and has a longstanding relationship with the classical music movement in Puerto Rico, including the annual Casals Festival and the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra (PRSO).

==History==
Following the success of the Casals Festival held in San Juan in 1957, state legislator Ernesto Ramos Antonini proposed several laws which would create the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra that same year, and the Conservatory of Music in June 1959. The conservatory was originally envisioned as a school for preparing musicians for the PRSO and for preparing music teachers for the state public education system. Throughout the years, however, the conservatory has become a musical landmark in the Caribbean, providing advanced academic studies in various music areas to local students as well as international visitors.

Since its inception, the conservatory has been under the administration of state government agencies, including the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (&quot;Compañía de Fomento Económico&quot;), the Administration for the Encouragement of Arts and Culture (&quot;Administración para el Fomento de las Artes y Cultura&quot;), and the Musical Arts Corporation (&quot;Corporación de las Artes Musicales&quot;, or CAM). It remained a part of the CAM until 1995 when a state law granted it fiscal and administrative autonomy. Since then, the conservatory has been autonomously run by a board of trustees appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate.

==Academics==
The conservatory offers a variety of post-secondary degrees in music, the post-graduate program offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in:musical composition, music education, voice, classical guitar, symphony instruments, jazz, Caribbean music, and piano. The graduate program consists of: master&#x27;s degrees in music education, voice, classical guitar, symphony instruments and piano, as well as artists diplomas in voice, classical guitar, symphony instruments, jazz, Caribbean music, and piano. It also offers continuing education programs, and teacher certifications. In addition to its regular academic programs, it organizes various international student exchange programs with music schools all around the world.

The Conservatory&#x27;s Preparatory School offers programs for children, teenagers and adults with the purpose of encouraging music appreciation within the local community. These programs do not offer degrees or certifications, but provide basic to near expert level teaching to regular citizens who are not in its formal academic program.

===Accreditations===
The conservatory is accredited by various federal and state educational associations, including:

* National Association of Schools of Music
* Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools
* National Guild for Community Arts Education
* Puerto Rico Education Council

==Campus==

From 1960 to 2008 the Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music was located in Hato Rey, in the former facilities of an old factory. In 2009 they moved to the new facilities in the Miramar section of the island&#x27;s capital.

The conservatory is composed of three main buildings:

# The Historic Building. Formerly known as &quot;Mothers of the Sacred Heart Private School&quot; (Spanish: Colegio de las Madres del Sagrado Corazón) and &quot;Miramar&#x27;s Old Refuge for Girls&quot; (Spanish: Antiguo Asilo de Niñas de Miramar), is part of the United States National Register of Historic Places. The building&#x27;s reconstruction lasted from 2001 to 2008, and it has been operating since 2009. It hosts the administrative offices, computer and piano labs, classrooms, practice rooms, the Luis A. Ferré Patio (north), and the Pablo Casals Patio (south).
# The parking lot and green-roof. Hosts the Rafael Hernández Amphitheater and the Laguna Plaza which offers to the academic community and visitors an incredible view of the Condado lagoon, and it&#x27;s the biggest green-roof in Puerto Rico.
# The Academic Building. Inaugurated in August 2012, consists of the following facilities:
#* First floor: The Amaury Veray Library, a unit of the Ángel Ramos Foundation Center for Learning Resources (Spanish: Centro de Recursos para el Aprendizaje Fundación Ángel Ramos), the Cecilia Negrón de Talavera wing, practice and rehearsal rooms.
#* Second floor: The Bertita &amp; Guillermo L. Martínez Theater (Concert and rehearsal halls: Jesús María Sanromá Concert Hall, the Anthony &quot;Junior&quot; Soto Hall, and the José &quot;Pepito&quot; Figueroa Hall), individual classrooms, practice cubicles, and lockers. 
#* Third floor: More individual classrooms, practice cubicles, and lockers.

The facilities host a variety of concerts for the nearby communities featuring students, teachers, the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra, and famous international performers.

==Affiliates==
The conservatory is a participating member of various US, Puerto Rico, and international music and arts associations, including:

* American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admission Officers
* Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities
* Puerto Rico Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators
* American Library Association
* Music Library Association

<text>The vast majority of the National Security Agency&#x27;s work on encryption is classified, but from time to time NSA participates in standards processes or otherwise publishes information about its cryptographic algorithms. The NSA has categorized encryption items into four product types, and algorithms into two suites. The following is a brief and incomplete summary of public knowledge about NSA algorithms and protocols.

==Type 1 Product==

A Type 1 Product refers to an NSA endorsed classified or controlled cryptographic item for classified or sensitive U.S. government information, including cryptographic equipment, assembly or component classified or certified by NSA for encrypting and decrypting classified and sensitive national security information when appropriately keyed.

==Type 2 Product==

A Type 2 Product refers to an NSA endorsed unclassified cryptographic equipment, assemblies or components for sensitive but unclassified U.S. government information.

==Type 3 Product==

Unclassified cryptographic equipment, assembly, or component used, when appropriately keyed, for encrypting or decrypting unclassified sensitive U.S. Government or commercial information, and to protect systems requiring protection mechanisms consistent with standard commercial practices. A Type 3 Algorithm refers to NIST endorsed algorithms, registered and FIPS published, for sensitive but unclassified U.S. government and commercial information.

== Type 4 Product==

A Type 4 Algorithm refers to algorithms that are registered by the NIST but are not FIPS published. Unevaluated commercial cryptographic equipment, assemblies, or components that are neither NSA nor NIST certified for any Government usage.

== Algorithm Suites ==
=== Suite A ===
A set of NSA unpublished algorithms that is intended for highly sensitive communication and critical authentication systems.

=== Suite B===

A set of NSA endorsed cryptographic algorithms for use as an interoperable cryptographic base for both unclassified information and most classified information. Suite B was announced on 16 February 2005, and phased out in 2016.

=== Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite ===

A set of cryptographic algorithms promulgated by the National Security Agency as a replacement for NSA Suite B Cryptography until post-quantum cryptography standards are promulgated.

===Quantum resistant suite===

In August 2015, NSA announced that it is planning to transition &quot;in the not distant future&quot; to a new cipher suite that is resistant to quantum attacks. &quot;Unfortunately, the growth of elliptic curve use has bumped up against the fact of continued progress in the research on quantum computing, necessitating a re-evaluation of our cryptographic strategy.&quot; NSA advised: &quot;For those partners and vendors that have not yet made the transition to Suite B algorithms, we recommend not making a significant expenditure to do so at this point but instead to prepare for the upcoming quantum resistant algorithm transition.&quot;

<text>George Watterston (October 23, 1783 – February 4, 1854) was an American attorney and writer who was the third Librarian of the United States Congress from 1815 to 1829.

==Early life and education==
Watterston, the son of a builder from Jedburgh, Scotland, was born on board a ship in New York Harbor. When Watterston was eight, his family moved to Washington D.C., where his father worked to help build the new national capital city. Watterston received a private education and graduated from the Charlotte Hall Military Academy in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland.

==Career==
Watterston became a lawyer, and at first practiced in Hagerstown, Maryland. However, he grew dissatisfied with then-frontier life and moved back to Washington, D.C., where he partnered with Thomas Law. There, Watterson became a man of letters, publishing his first novel, &quot;The Lawyer, or Man As He Ought Not to Be&quot;, in 1808. He also published the novel &quot;Glencarn&quot;; or &quot;The Disappointments of Youth&quot; (1810); a play, &quot;The Child of Feeling&quot; (1809); and a poem, &quot;The Scenes of Youth&quot; (1813). Many of his works portrayed lawyers in unflattering terms. In 1813, Waterston became editor of the &quot;Washington City Gazette&quot;.

During the War of 1812, Watterston participated in the unsuccessful defense of the national capitol. The British burned the city, including the Library of Congress, which was then housed in the Capitol building. After war&#x27;s end, President James Madison appointed Watterston as Librarian of Congress, the third person to hold the position and the first with that as his sole responsibility. (Previous librarians also served as the clerk of the House of Representatives). Congress replenished the library by purchasing the collection of former President Thomas Jefferson. Watterston gave the collection&#x27;s books bookplates and labels and kept them organized according to Jefferson&#x27;s basic classification scheme. He also continued writing, including the comic novel &quot;The L— Family at Washington; or, A Winter in the Metropolis&quot; (1822), &quot;A Course of Study preparatory to the Bar or Senate&quot; (1827) and &quot;The Wanderer in Washington&quot; (1827). 

Watterston was a Whig and active in politics. He opposed the election of President Andrew Jackson and upon Jackson&#x27;s election was replaced in 1829. Watterston fruitlessly sought reinstatement for years.

After his dismissal, Watterston became editor of the &quot;National Journal&quot; and published books on many subjects, including biographies and works on agriculture. He campaigned to construct the Washington Monument and became secretary of the Washington National Monument Society.

==Personal life==
In 1811 Watterson married Maria Magruder Shanley (1795-1864), whose grandfather Capt. Nathaniel Magruder (d. 1785) had been a prominent patriot during the American Revolutionary War. Of their children, two sons died in 1832 but two sons and two daughters survived to adulthood, including their first born, David (who became a civil engineer in the capital city) and their youngest George W. Watterson (1848-1864). In 1820, Watterston owned four enslaved people, but only one in 1830 (a woman in her 30s, and a free black man of similar age also lived with the family). Ten years later, Watterston owned five slaves (all under age 25), and in the final census before his death, owned one 18-year old black woman and a young girl. 

==Death and legacy==
Watterston died in 1854, and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., where his widow would join him a decade later. Their youngest son George would move to Livingston County, Louisiana, buy land in 1860, and enlist in the Confederate States Army as a private in Louisiana&#x27;s Washington artillery as the American Civil War began. He died in 1864 of complications of wounds received shortly after the Battle of Gettysburg, although having left progeny. 

Watterston&#x27;s former house in Washington, D.C., still exists, as a contributing structure in the historic district near the Library of Congress.

<doc id="1075519" wikidata="Q3798833" url="?curid=1075519" title="Nanaia Mahuta">
<text>Nanaia Cybele Mahuta (born 21 August 1970) is a New Zealand former politician who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of New Zealand from 2020 to 2023. A member of the New Zealand Labour Party, Mahuta served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for 27 years, at first for the party list and then for three different Māori electorates, latterly for Hauraki-Waikato. Mahuta served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 6 November 2020 to 11 November 2023. She received international recognition as the first woman (and first Māori woman) to hold the Foreign Affairs portfolio. In October 2022, Mahuta became the Mother of the House, having served continuously in the House of Representatives since the 1996 general election. She lost her seat in parliament in the 2023 general election to Te Pāti Māori candidate Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, who was subsequently Baby of the House.

Mahuta was born into the kāhui ariki in Auckland, the daughter of Sir Robert Mahuta, who was the adopted son of Māori king Korokī. Affiliated to Ngāti Mahuta, her father was the elder brother of the Māori queen Te Atairangikaahu, and she is a first cousin of current Māori monarch Kiingi Tūheitia. Elected to Parliament at the age of 26, Mahuta has had a long and influential career in the Labour Party. She was also Minister of Local Government, Minister of Youth Development and Minister of Customs in the Fifth Labour Government and Minister of Local Government and Minister for Māori Development in the Sixth Labour Government. 

Mahuta took a generally progressive platform as Minister of Foreign Affairs. She called on the Israeli government to stop evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in illegally-occupied East Jerusalem. Mahuta introduced the Russia Sanctions Act 2022, which after unanimous approval imposed various sanctions targeting Russian elites and assets deemed to be complicit in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As part of New Zealand&#x27;s membership of the Five Eyes alliance, she condemned the disqualification of pro-democracy Hong Kong legislators as a breach of Hong Kong&#x27;s autonomy and rights under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. She was the first female MP to wear a moko kauae (a traditional Māori facial tattoo), which was widely praised as a powerful symbol of Indigenous women. In 2018, she was listed as one of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Women&quot;. Domestically, she was a proponent of the Three Waters reform programme and co-governance.

==Early life and family==

Mahuta was born in Auckland in 1970 to Eliza Raiha Edmonds, and (later Sir) Robert Mahuta. Some of her early life was spent in Oxford, where her father was undertaking PhD study.

She was educated at Kura Kaupapa Rakaumanga school in Huntly and later at Waikato Diocesan School for Girls as a boarder. Firstly she studied law at the University of Waikato, but failed three of her seven papers and had to drop out. She then studied social anthropology and Māori business development at the University of Auckland, graduating with an MA (Hons). The title of her 1995 master&#x27;s thesis was &quot;Te poukai o Waahi : an historical background to the Waahi poukai&quot;. She also worked at the university as a researcher/archivist.

She has strong links to the Māori King Movement. Her father, Sir Robert Mahuta, was the adopted son of King Korokī and the elder brother of Māori Queen Te Atairangikaahu. She is related to the Māori monarch, Ngā Wai Hono i te Pō. Mahuta&#x27;s sister, Tipa Mahuta, is a long-serving Waikato regional councillor and the co-chair of the Māori Health Authority.

Mahuta is married to William Gannin Ormsby, her first cousin. The couple have had three children together (the first died shortly after birth), plus four children from Ormsby&#x27;s previous relationship.

In 2016, she acquired a Māori facial tattoo () and became the first female MP to wear one in the New Zealand parliament. Other Māori women in parliament—Metiria Turei of the Green Party and Marama Fox of the Māori Party—spoke of their support.

==Political career==




Mahuta joined the Labour Party at the request of retiring Western Maori MP Koro Wētere and after hearing Helen Clark speak in Auckland. She was also encouraged to participate in politics by members of the Māori Women&#x27;s Welfare League.

She contested Te Tai Hauāuru (the replacement seat for Western Maori) in the 1996 elections but lost to New Zealand First&#x27;s Tuku Morgan. However, with a list ranking of 8, Mahuta was elected as one of the first New Zealand list MPs. Mahuta was aged 26 years and 52 days when she was elected (twelve days younger than Deborah Morris) and was the youngest member of the New Zealand House of Representatives until the election of Darren Hughes in 2002.

After completing her first term as a list MP, Mahuta contested Te Tai Hauauru in the 1999 election, and won. She transferred to and won the new Tainui electorate for the 2002 election and held it in 2005. That seat was renamed Hauraki-Waikato ahead of the 2008 general election. She retained that seat until 2023. In October 2022, Mahuta became the Mother of the House, being the longest continuously serving female MP (alongside Father of the House Gerry Brownlee).

Mahuta has been placed in high positions on the Labour list in each election she has contested where she has had a list position. However, she opted not to seek a list position in 2005 following the foreshore and seabed controversy and again in 2017 as part of Labour&#x27;s Māori electorate strategy.

On 8 December 2022, Mahuta confirmed that she would be contesting the 2023 general election in order &quot;to ensure that the changes that we&#x27;ve [the Labour Government] been putting through can continue to progress&quot;.

===Foreshore and seabed controversy===
In 2004, she joined Tariana Turia, another Labour MP, in voting against the first reading of her party&#x27;s legislation on the controversial foreshore and seabed issue. She did not, however, join Turia when she quit Labour to found the Māori Party. In the bill&#x27;s second reading, she again voted against her party, but in the third reading, she changed her position and supported it, saying that it was the politically pragmatic thing to do. In her third reading speech, Mahuta stated that she would withdraw from the Labour Party list at the next election to seek a renewed mandate from her electorate.

=== Select committee memberships and party portfolios ===

As a first-term opposition MP, Mahuta was appointed as a member of the regulations review committee and the electoral law committee. She was also the Labour party spokesperson for Māori education. From 1999 to 2005, the first two terms of the Fifth Labour Government, Mahuta was variously a member of the justice and electoral, Māori affairs, education and science, local government and environment committees, and was chair of the Māori affairs committee from August 2004 to August 2005.

Following the defeat of the Labour government in the 2008 election, and Labour&#x27;s successive losses in 2011 and 2014, Mahuta held various appointments as Labour Party spokesperson for Māori affairs, education, energy and conservation. She was also deputy chairperson of the Māori Affairs select committee in the 51st Parliament.

Mahuta has had three member&#x27;s bills selected for introduction. Her Resource Management (Enhancement of Iwi Management Plans) Amendment Bill , which proposed giving more weight to Māori in resource-management decisions, was drawn from the members&#x27; ballot in 2009. The bill was defeated at its first reading in August. Her Charter Schools (Application of Official Information and Ombudsmen Acts) Bill was drawn and defeated in 2016.

In July 2017, Mahuta&#x27;s Sentencing (Domestic Violence) Amendment Bill was drawn. The Bill was previously in the name of Sue Moroney and would have allowed judges to consider history of domestic violence when making decisions about sentencing in court. It was withdrawn when the Labour Party formed a new government in October 2017 in favour of broader family violence reforms that were completed in 2018.

=== Labour leadership election, 2014 ===
Labour lost the 2014 general election with its worst result since ; as a result, David Cunliffe resigned as leader, triggering a leadership election. Mahuta had been a supporter of Cunliffe and sought election as his deputy in his unsuccessful 2011 leadership bid. Mahuta was one of four MPs who sought election as Cunliffe&#x27;s successor. She announced her candidacy half an hour before nominations closed on 14 October 2014 and was nominated by Louisa Wall and William Sio. Mahuta placed fourth in the election. She considered retiring from politics at the 2017 general election after Maori King Tūheitia Paki changed his allegiance to the Māori Party. However, Mahuta eventually decided to stay on. She was not placed on the Labour Party list at that election in line with Labour&#x27;s decision for its incumbent Māori electorate MPs to contest the electorate vote only.

== Minister in the Fifth Labour Government ==
Mahuta was appointed a minister in the final term of the Fifth Labour Government. In her contribution to a collection of essays by Māori political leaders, she recalled requesting portfolios other than Māori affairs. She was appointed Minister of Customs, Minister of Youth Affairs, Associate Minister of Local Government and Associate Minister for the Environment in October 2005. She gained the full local government portfolio and also became Associate Minister of Tourism in November 2007.

Mahuta lost her portfolios when Labour was defeated in the 2008 general election.

== Minister in the Sixth Labour Government ==

Mahuta served as a cabinet minister in the Sixth Labour Government. In the government&#x27;s first term, from 2017 to 2020, she held the portfolios for Local Government and Maori Development and also served as associate minister for the trade and export growth, the environment and housing portfolios.

In the government&#x27;s second term, beginning in 2020, she was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Local Government and Associate Minister for Māori Development. In a 2023 reshuffle she dropped the local government portfolio and additionally became Minister of Disarmament and Arms Control. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins stated that the change was intended to allow Mahuta to focus on her foreign affairs portfolio and to travel overseas. He also denied that it was motivated by the response to the controversial Three Waters reform programme and confirmed that the Government would continue with the programme.

=== Māori Development ===
As Minister for Māori Development, in September 2019, Mahuta delivered a tearful and emotional speech as Parliament officially apologised for a police raid in 1916 on Māori leader Rua Kenana&#x27;s Iharaira faith&#x27;s compound in Maungapohatu in the North Island&#x27;s Bay of Plenty Region.

=== Local Government ===

==== Tauranga City Council ====
On 4 December 2020, Mahuta, in her role as Minister of Local Government, informed the Tauranga City Council of her intention to appoint commissioners following infighting within the city council that had led to the resignation of the Mayor of Tauranga Tenby Powell on 19 November. Local Government New Zealand supported the move to appoint commissioners in order to get the city&#x27;s governance &quot;back on track.&quot; On 18 December, Mahuta confirmed that the Government would be appointing commissioners to administer Tauranga since the City Council did not provide &quot;sufficient evidence&quot; about how it was addressing the city&#x27;s governance issues. However, a review by law firm Russell McVeagh found Mahuta&#x27;s decision may have been &quot;unlawful&quot; because she failed to adequately consider lesser alternatives, such as the appointment of a crown manager. Then local Tauranga MP, Simon Bridges called the appointment of commissioners &quot;dramatic and draconian.&quot;

The commissioners&#x27; terms began in early 2021 and were scheduled to run until the 2022 New Zealand local elections in October 2022.

In mid–March 2022, Mahuta confirmed that Tauranga would continue to be run by four commissioners until July 2024, citing the substantial infrastructure challenges in the city and the surrounding Bay of Plenty Region. However, a legal review by Linda Clark from Dentons Kensington Swan argued that relying on infrastructure challenges as a reason to postpone elections &quot;sets the bar very low and would apply to a wide range of local authorities on an indefinite basis.&quot; Clark argued that Mahuta&#x27;s decision was both unlawful and unreasonable; not meeting the statutory test for crown intervention under the Local Government Act 2002.

Local Government New Zealand president Stuart Crosby labelled the extension of the commission&#x27;s appointment &quot;disgusting&quot; while then Tauranga MP, Simon Bridges, cited “power, convenience and control” as the reasons behind Mahuta&#x27;s decision, and questioned a lack of achievement since the four-person commission was put in place by Labour in February 2021. Victoria University of Wellington public law expert, Dean Knight, said democracy had taken a hit and &quot;should have been restored forthwith.&quot;

On 22 April 2022, Mahuta reappointed the Tauranga Commission&#x27;s chairwoman Anne Tolley and fellow commissioners Bill Wasley, Stephen Selwood, and Shadrach Rolleston; with elected councillors expected to return in July 2024.

==== Māori wards and constituencies ====
On 1 February 2021, Mahuta announced that the Government would pass legislation upholding local councils&#x27; decisions to establish Māori wards and constituencies. This new law would also abolish an existing law allowing local referendums to veto decisions by councils to establish Māori wards. This law is intended to come into effect before the scheduled 2022 local body elections.

On 25 February, Mahuta&#x27;s Local Electoral (Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Act 2021 passed its third reading in Parliament. This Bill eliminates mechanisms for holding public referendums on the establishment of Māori wards and constituencies on local bodies. Mahuta&#x27;s Bill was supported by the Labour, Green and Māori parties but opposed by the opposition National and ACT parties. National unsuccessfully attempted to delay the bill by mounting a twelve hour filibuster challenging all of the Bill&#x27;s ten clauses.

==== Three Waters reform programme ====
As Minister of Local Government, Mahuta has played an important role in promoting and implementing the Government&#x27;s contentious Three Waters reform programme, which proposes taking control of water utility services away from local councils and centralising them in four new entities. Mahuta has argued that the Three Water reforms will give Māori a greater say in the administration of water resources, stating the status of water as Taonga in Māori culture. In early October 2021, five Christchurch City councillors demanded that she resign her local government portfolio over the Three Waters reforms. Mahuta rejected their demand, accusing the councillors of &quot;political campaigning.&quot;

On 27 October, Mahuta formally launched the Three Waters reforms, which attracted criticism from several local leaders including Mayor of Auckland Phil Goff, Mayor of Christchurch Lianne Dalziel, Mayor of Wellington Andy Foster, and the opposition National and ACT parties. In response to criticism, Mahuta acknowledged that the Three Waters reforms policy was not popular but accused opponents of spreading misinformation. In March 2022, Mahuta acknowledged underestimating the level of public opposition to the Three Waters reforms and problems with the associated promotional advertising campaign.

Mahuta introduced the Water Services Entities Bill in early June 2022. As part of the Three Waters reform programme, this proposed bill would establish the four regional water services entities that would take over management of water infrastructure from local councils. Under the proposed law, councils would retain ownership of their water assets through a &quot;community share&quot; arrangement but the new water service entities would retain effective control over these assets. Mahuta also confirmed that further legislation would also be introduced to facilitate the transfer of assets and liabilities from local authorities to the new water services entities, integrate entities into other regulatory systems, and to ensure economic regulation and consumer protection over the new entities. The National Party, ACT Party, and Communities 4 Local Democracy leader and Manawatū District Mayor Helen Worboy opposed the Water Services Entities Bill, claiming that it would transfer control of water assets from local communities into a new centralised bureaucracy.

In early December 2022, Mahuta supported a controversial Green Party entrenchment clause in the Water Services Entities Bill proposing that any future law change on the ownership of public water assets would require 60% parliamentary support or a referendum. Within New Zealand law, entrenchment clauses have traditionally been reserved for constitutional matters in the Electoral Act 1993 such as the voting age. Mahuta&#x27;s position went against the Labour Cabinet&#x27;s position opposing the entrenchment clause. In response, the opposition National Party leader Christopher Luxon called for Mahuta to be sacked from Cabinet for allegedly defying Cabinet&#x27;s decision not to adopt the entrenchment clause.

Shadow Leader of the House Chris Bishop accused Mahuta of failing to consult Justice Minister Kiri Allan on proposals relating to constitutional arrangements. Prime Minister Ardern defended Mahuta and accused Luxon of misrepresenting Mahuta&#x27;s actions while reaffirming Labour&#x27;s opposition to privatising water assets. The Water Services Entities Bill passed its third reading on 7 December with the sole support of the Labour Party. During the final reading, Mahuta argued that the legislation would help address water contamination and quality issues, citing the 2016 Havelock North campylobacter contamination incident and a recent &quot;boil water&quot; notice in the Matamata-Piako District.

==== Local government review ====
On 23 April 2021, Mahuta announced a review into the future of local government in the country. Following the release of the independent draft report on 28 October 2022, she said that the New Zealand government was &quot;focused on ways to keep a lid on rate rises...[and would]...continue to support the sector in its efforts to engage with local communities in order to get the buy-in needed for any change.&quot; The draft document acknowledged that the &quot;pace of change&quot; risked growing distrust of, and engagement with, democratic institutions and signalled five shift that needed to be made to address this: &quot;strengthened local democracy; authentic relationships with hapū/iwi and Māori; a focus on wellbeing; genuine partnership between central and local government; and more equitable funding.&quot; The final report was released in July 2023. In response to a recommendation that the &quot;67 city and district councils and 11 regional councils be reorganised into 15 regional groupings,&quot; Mayor of Carterton Ron Mark said that &quot;every council in the country is vulnerable&quot; to amalgamation and expressed concern that the Wairarapa area could lose some of its asset base and autonomy if things move &quot;to a more centralised socialist viewpoint, disempowering our people.&quot;

=== Environment and Housing portfolios: alleged conflicts of interest ===
In late May 2022, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that the Ministry for the Environment had awarded Mahuta&#x27;s husband William Gannin Ormsby and several family members contracts worth above NZ$90,000, commencing late October 2020. Ormbsy owned a waste management consultancy service called Ka Awatea Services. In addition, the social housing provider Kāinga Ora paid Ormbsy&#x27;s company NZ$73,000 for organising hui (social gatherings) and workshops. At the time, Mahuta held the portfolio of Associate Minister of Housing. The opposition National Party accused Mahuta of unfairly awarding contracts to relatives. On 21 June 2022, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern defended Mahuta, claiming that she had abided by Cabinet policies and protocol.

In response to a parliamentary question submitted by National MP Simeon Brown, Environment Minister David Parker confirmed that the Ministry of Environment was investigating the process through which William Ormsby, his nephew Tamoko Ormsby and wife Waimirirangi Ormsby were appointed to a five-member advisory working group researching the application of indigenous Māori knowledge to waste management practices. The Ministry claimed that the Ormsbys had been selected for their role because of their expertise and that cabinet ministers were not involved in the selection process. The Ministry also emphasised that the Mahuta family connection had been disclosed from the beginning and that it had sought external advice on the appointments.

On 21 September 2022, the Public Service Commissioner Peter Hughes launched an investigation into four contracts that Ormsby&#x27;s Ka Awatea Services had made with four government departments: Kāinga Ora, the Ministry for the Environment, the Department of Conservation and Te Puni Kōkiri (the Ministry for Māori Development). Hughes had commenced the investigation at the request of both National MP Simeon Brown and Mahuta herself. Mahuta emphasised that she had declared any potential conflicts of interest, abided by the Cabinet manual and supported the Public Service Commissioner&#x27;s investigation.

On 13 November 2022, the Public Service Commission released its report into Ka Wa Atea&#x27;s government contracts. The report found that Te Puni Kōkiri, the Environment Ministry, and Kāinga Ora failed to manage conflicts of interests by following their own policies and processes while the Department of Conservation had poor contract management practices. However, the Commission&#x27;s report concluded that it found &quot;no evidence of favouritism, bias, or undue influence over agency decisions&quot; in relation to Ka Awatea Services. In response, Mahuta welcomed the report as a vindication of her assertion that she had no role in approving these contracts. In addition, National MP Brown stated that the Commission&#x27;s report exposed a &quot;culture of carelessness&quot; in how the public service procured services and managed conflicts of interest.

=== Foreign Affairs ===

==== 2020 ====
Mahuta was announced as the next Minister of Foreign Affairs on 2 November 2020. She received international recognition as the first woman (and first Māori woman) to hold the Foreign Affairs portfolio. In addition, she retained her portfolio of Minister for Local Government while becoming Associate Minister of Māori Development.

On 3 November, former Prime Minister Helen Clark and the Māori Council criticised the international media&#x27;s description of Mahuta as a &quot;tattooed Māori woman&quot; for focusing on her physical appearance and race. On 4 November, right-wing blogger and author Olivia Pierson drew criticism and media coverage for posting a tweet stating that &quot;Facial tattoos, especially on a female diplomat, is the height of ugly, uncivilised wokedom.&quot; In response, Race Relations Commissioner Meng Foon criticised Pierson&#x27;s actions and said that &quot;Mahuta&#x27;s kauae moko was special to Māori and should be celebrated.&quot; Mahuta declined to comment on the issue. Following criticism of Pierson&#x27;s post on social media, online retailer Mighty Ape delisted Pierson&#x27;s book &quot;Western Values Defended: A Primer&quot;. Pierson described the delisting of her book as &quot;cancel culture&quot; and claimed she had received death threats.

On 18 November, Mahuta joined her Australian, Canadian, British and American counterparts in condemning the disqualification of pro-democracy Hong Kong legislators as a breach of Hong Kong&#x27;s autonomy and rights under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. In response, the Chinese Foreign Ministry&#x27;s spokesperson Zhao Lijian warned the Five Eyes countries, stating that &quot;No matter if they have five eyes or 10 eyes, if they dare to harm China&#x27;s sovereignty, security and development interests, they should beware of their eyes being poked and blinded.&quot; In response, Mahuta defended New Zealand&#x27;s commitment to free speech, free media, and democracy.

In mid-December, Mahuta stated during an interview with Reuters that New Zealand would be interested in helping to negotiate a truce between Australia and China, whose bilateral relationship had deteriorated due to Australia legislation on foreign investment and interference, Australian support for an international investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese blocks on Australian imports and a controversial Chinese post about alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan. In response, &quot;Global Times&quot; columnist Qian Feng claimed that New Zealand was not suited for the role of mediator since it was part of the same Western camp as Australia.

==== 2021 ====

On 9 February 2021, Mahuta announced that New Zealand had suspended high-level bilateral relations with Myanmar in response to the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état. The New Zealand Government joined other Western governments in refusing to recognise the new military-led government and called for the restoration of civilian-led rule. In addition, aid projects were diverted away from the Myanmar military and a travel ban was imposed on Myanmar&#x27;s military leaders.

On 19 April, Mahuta stated that New Zealand would not let the United States-led Five Eyes dictate New Zealand&#x27;s bilateral relationship with China and that New Zealand was uncomfortable with expanding the remit of the intelligence grouping. Mahuta&#x27;s statements came amid rising disagreements between the New Zealand and Australian governments on how to manage relations with Beijing. In March 2021, the Australian and New Zealand governments issued a joint statement condemning the treatment of Uyghur minorities in Xinjiang. The Australian Government has since expressed concern about what it perceives as New Zealand Government efforts to undermine Five Eyes attempts to push back on what the Australian Government regards as &quot;increasingly aggressive behaviour from Beijing.&quot;

In response to Mahuta&#x27;s remarks, Prime Minister Ardern stated that New Zealand was still committed to the Five Eyes alliance but would not use the group as its first point for messaging on non-security matters. While British media criticised New Zealand for allegedly leaving the Five Eyes club, the Chinese &quot;Global Times&quot; praised New Zealand for putting its own national interests over the Five Eyes.

During a visit by Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne on 22 April 2021, Mahuta discussed the issue of New Zealand deportees from Australia, the ISIL bride Suhayra Aden and the two government&#x27;s differing approaches towards China.

On 11 May 2021, Mahuta called on Israel to stop evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem and for &quot;both sides to halt steps which undermine prospects for a two state solution&quot;.

Following the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election held on 19 December 2021, Foreign Minister Mahuta joined other Five Eyes foreign ministers issuing a joint statement criticising the exclusion of opposition candidates and urging China to respect human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration. In response, the Chinese Embassy in Wellington issued a statement claiming the election was &quot;politically inclusive and fair&quot; and urged the Five Eyes alliance to respect Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong.

==== 2022 ====
In late January 2022, Mahuta reaffirmed the New Zealand Government&#x27;s support for Ukraine in response to the Russian military build-up on the Russo-Ukrainian border and urged Russian to reduce tensions in accordance with international law. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in mid February 2022, Mahuta and Ardern joined New Zealand&#x27;s Western allies in condemning Russian actions against Ukraine. As Foreign Minister, Mahuta introduced the Russia Sanctions Act 2022, which imposed various sanctions targeting Russian elites and assets deemed to be complicit in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The bill passed into law on 9 March 2022 with unanimous support from all members of the New Zealand Parliament.

In mid-June 2022, Mahuta hosted Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong during her first state visit to New Zealand. The two Foreign Ministers reaffirmed bilateral cooperation in the areas of climate change, indigenous, and Indo-Pacific issues. The opposition ACT Party&#x27;s foreign affairs spokesperson Brooke Van Velden criticised Mahuta&#x27;s few international trips during her tenure as Foreign Minister, suggesting that Mahuta was preoccupied with the Three Waters reform programme. By comparison, her Australian counterpart Wong had undertaken a &quot;grand tour&quot; of the Pacific Islands following the election of the Albanese government in late May 2022 to counter recent Chinese diplomatic engagement in the region including a bilateral security agreement with the Solomon Islands.

In early August 2022, Mahuta met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the East Asia and ASEAN summits in Cambodia. In addition to acknowledging 50 years of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, she reiterated New Zealand&#x27;s concerns about human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état, North Korean missile tests, Sino-Taiwanese tensions following United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s visit, and urged Beijing not to support Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Mahuta also accepted an invitation from Wang Yi to visit China.

==== 2023 ====

In response to the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake, Mahuta announced that New Zealand would be contributing NZ$1.5 million to assisting the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement&#x27;s (IFRC) responses in Turkey and Syria.
On 5 February 2023, Mahuta visited India and conducted bilateral talks with Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar. The talks centred around taking the bilateral relationship to the next level, including exploring future economic relationship, cooperation in the International Solar Alliance, improved air connectivity and private sector collaboration. She also promoted New Zealand&#x27;s education, trade and tourism sector.

In late March, Mahuta met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Beijing. The two foreign ministers discussed issues of concern to China-New Zealand relations including Chinese military aid to Russia during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, AUKUS, Chinese influence in the Pacific, and New Zealand concerns about the South China Sea dispute, human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and increasing tensions with Taiwan. In late June, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper claimed that Qin had harangued Mahuta during an hour-long meeting, citing two anonymous sources. One of the sources also claimed that Mahuta had pushed back against Qin&#x27;s wolf warrior diplomacy. In response to the report, Prime Minister Hipkins confirmed that Mahuta had a &quot;constructive&quot; conversation with Qin but said that Mahuta had not described the meeting as a &quot;dressing down,&quot; adding &quot;it was important to be able to have frank conversations.&quot;

In early April, Mahuta along with foreign ministers of three other &quot;Indo-Pacific partner countries&quot; Australia, Japan, and South Korea attended the 2023 NATO summit to discuss several global issues including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chinese assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific, cybercrime and climate change.

On 8 October 2023, Mahuta expressed deep concern at the outbreak of violence during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. She called for the immediate halt to violence, the protection of all civilians, and the upholding of international humanitarian law. ACT leader David Seymour criticised Mahuta for not condemning Hamas for its terror attacks against Israeli civilians. In response, Prime Minister Hipkins unequivocally condemned Hamas&#x27; terror attacks, stating that the target of civilians and hostage taking violated fundamental international humanitarian principles. He also stated Israel had the right to defend itself. Hipkins also denied that Mahuta was out of step with New Zealand foreign policy and stated it was a matter of timing. In mid November 2023, TVNZ reported that she had rejected advice by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to use stronger language condemning Hamas&#x27; actions on 7 October. During an interview with TVNZ journalist Jack Tame, Mahuta attributed her Tweet to information she had received from an unidentified party and the developing situation.

===2023 general election ===
During the 2023 New Zealand general election, Mahuta contested the Hauraki-Waikato electorate for the Labour Party, which she had retained since 2008. On 4 October, 1News reported that a Whakaata Māori poll showed that Mahuta was being challenged by Te Pāti Māori&#x27;s candidate Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke. While the poll found that Mahuta had a narrow lead of 36% over Maipi-Clark&#x27;s 32%, 43% of those under 40 years preferred Maipi-Clark while 30% preferred Mahuta. However, 43% of those aged 60 years and above preferred Mahuta compared with 12% of the same demographic for Maipi-Clarke. Mahuta was unseated by Maipi-Clarke by 2,911 votes, with Maipi-Clarke set to be the youngest member of Parliament in New Zealand in 170 years. As Mahuta had chosen not to be on the party list, she lost her place in parliament.

On 11 November, Mahuta formally resigned from her ministerial portfolios. Due to the extension of the Labour caretaker government until the conclusion of coalition talks for the incoming National-led government, Grant Robertson assumed Mahuta&#x27;s foreign affairs portfolio while Willie Jackson assumed the associate Māori development portfolio.

==Views and positions==
===Abortion===
In 2020, Nanaia Mahuta exercised her conscience vote in opposing the Abortion Legislation Act 2020, which decriminalised abortion in New Zealand. In June 2022, Mahuta published a Twitter post condemning the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which had accorded a constitutional right to abortion in the United States. Mahuta was criticised by Twitter users for hypocrisy on the grounds that she had opposed the Abortion Legislation Act. She supported the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion (Safe Areas) Amendment Act 2022 that established a regulation-making power to set up safe areas around specific abortion facilities on a case-by-case basis.

<text>The Machine is a secret society at the University of Alabama. In 1914, it formed from the &quot;Alpha Rho chapter&quot; of Theta Nu Epsilon as a coalition of Panhellenic sororities and IFC and NPHC fraternities. The group, which has operated in varying degrees of secrecy since 1914 (though its roots run deeper into the 19th century), is credited with selecting and ensuring the election of candidates for Student Government Association, Homecoming Queen, and other influential on-campus and off-campus offices, including the Student Government Association Senate.

It was evidently first publicly noted as &quot;a political machine&quot; in 1928 by Alabama&#x27;s campus newspaper, &quot;The Crimson White&quot;. Then in a 1945 article in the newspaper, it was referred to as &quot;the machine&quot;, and the name has stuck ever since. It is alleged that The Machine plays a real role in both the politics of the student community and in the political careers of numerous Alabama politicians.

==History==
The &quot;Alpha Rho chapter&quot; of Theta Nu Epsilon was founded at the University of Alabama in 1888 without formal permission of the society. In 1902, the chapter contacted the fraternty&#x27;s governing authority and was accepted as a legitimate chapter. It was subsequently accepted by the administration and university community, and in 1905, the chapter hosted its first annual promenade, which was a successful public event.

In 1909, on February 14, The &quot;Alpha Rho chapter&quot; created a new society, this one for members of the senior class, called The Skulls. The Skulls replaced the Theta Nu Epsilon chapter. Both the earlier and later organizations were publicly recognized by the university, and appeared each year in the university yearbook. The Skulls was considered a legitimate student group until 1922. The organization officially ceased to exist at that time.

&quot;Esquire&quot; devoted its April 1992 cover story to an exposé of The Machine. By their own estimates, Theta Nu Epsilon claims to have a &quot;voter block of 8,000 students.&quot;

==Controversies==

=== Machine opposition ===
Over the years, numerous campus political groups have been formed in an attempt to motivate independent students to vote for non-Machine candidates. While a law student, future Congressman Carl Elliott of Vina, Alabama, ran for the high-profile position of president of the student government. With the support of the growing number of out-of-state students and women, Elliott became the first person to defeat the Machine. In 1936, Elliott completed his term as SGA president and graduated with his law degree. The University Party was formed by Ed Still and Jack Drake in 1967. Drake lost the SGA Presidency to Ralph Knowles and Still lost to Joe Espy.

An anti-machine group called &quot;The Coalition&quot; formed in 1968 and operated through 1972. This was a joint effort by the men&#x27;s dormitories, small non-machine fraternities, International Students Association, women students, and the Afro-American Association. It was formed by Steve Windom (later lieutenant governor), Tommy Chapman (later district attorney), Steve &quot;Red&quot; Wadlington (later political campaign operative), Don Gilbert (later head of Alabama Trial Lawyers Association) and Jim Zeigler (later public service commissioner and a member of the Mallet Assembly). The Coalition succeeded in 1969 in electing Joe Estep as vice-president over the Machine&#x27;s George Culver. It elected Henry Agee as secretary-treasurer over the Machine&#x27;s Phil Reich. In 1970 it elected Zeigler as president of SGA as an independent. It also elected Windom to the Student Senate and almost 50% of the Student Senate in 1970–71. In 1972 the coalition senators led by Fred Benjamin got the SGA to recognize and fund the Afro-American Association. Benjamin co-won Senator of the Year award along with a machine senator. He lost election for vice president of the SGA later that year.

Another anti-Machine group was the Alabama Student Party (ASP), which was founded by SGA Senators Fred L. Gibson, Jr. and O. Kevin Vincent in 1985. ASP intended to run a full slate of independent candidates, but its efforts were temporarily thwarted when the Machine orchestrated a takeover of ASP by flooding its first general campus meeting at Ferguson Center with fraternity pledges and members and electing Neal Orr, a freshman member of a fraternity (Delta Tau Delta) that belonged to the Machine, as its president. Orr&#x27;s fraternity was also the fraternity of the then SGA President, George Harris. Control of ASP was then subsequently retaken by independents later in the year, and it then played a pivotal role as a force for independents in upcoming elections. ASP successfully challenged the Machine with the election of John Merrill, an independent, as president in 1986, as well as a number of SGA senators. Merrill was opposed by the Machine when he ran for SGA Senator, had been backed by the Machine for vice president in 1985, and was then opposed by the Machine for president in 1986.

The Alabama Student Party subsequently was involved in the federal court case of &quot;Alabama Student Party v. Student Government Association of the University of Alabama&quot;, 867 F.2d 1344 (11th Cir. 1989).
The Mallet Assembly, originally a men&#x27;s honors program founded by Dean of Men John Blackburn in the early 1960s, is traditionally opposed to Machine influence, and has campaigned for several candidates under the banner of the &quot;Blue Door Party&quot;. Jim Zeigler, who defeated The Machine in 1970 for SGA President, was a member of the Mallet Assembly and actually lived in old Mallet Hall, where his room was burned in 1971.

One of the most controversial elections took place in 1976, when Cleo Thomas, an African-American student and member of an historically black fraternity, was elected to the SGA presidency with the support of the Mallet Assembly and a coalition of several sororities. In 1979, the Machine weathered an internal disagreement about who should be the Machine-endorsed candidates, which resulted in three fraternities electing to leave the Machine to run their own candidates.

In 1989, independent Joey Viselli lost a very close election for president to a candidate who was reportedly the first-ever Machine-backed female candidate for the office. Many people, including Tuscaloosa County election workers assisting with the election, believed there were definite irregularities. Viselli took a challenge of the results to the administration, which ruled against a new election, but did remove future student elections from student control. Later that spring, Viselli was elected president of the Residents Hall Council after a challenge by James Adams, a freshman member of a fraternity (Delta Tau Delta) that belonged to the Machine. Viselli&#x27;s father Fran was a popular community figure who was the founder and owner of Bama-Bino&#x27;s Pizza in the Tuscaloosa area. It has been widely believed that the Machine initiated a retaliatory boycott against Bama-Bino&#x27;s following the election which, when combined with new competition, soon led to the closure of all Bama-Bino&#x27;s.

=== 1992 and suspension of the SGA ===
In 1992, Phi Mu sorority member Minda Riley (daughter of former Alabama Governor Bob Riley) ran against Machine-backed candidate and Beta Theta Pi fraternity member Neil Duthie. In that election, Minda Riley made claims of harassment and physical assault, even though she belonged to a Machine-aligned sorority. Following the physical assault of Riley, resulting in her fleeing campus, the university nevertheless suspended the Student Government Association altogether, and did not reinstitute it until 1996. Minda Riley&#x27;s brother Rob Riley was elected president of the SGA as a Machine candidate.

In 1999, African American Fabien “Fab” Zinga, a candidate for the SGA presidency, claimed that he was personally threatened and that his campaign signs were defaced. CNN covered the story, with references to the alleged history of intimidation attributed to the Machine.


Prior to the 2002 SGA election, the phrase &quot;Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine&quot; from Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s essay &quot;Resistance to Civil Government&quot; was chalked on the outer wall of the Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library. This caused a group of students, calling themselves &quot;The Counter-friction,&quot; to interrupt then university president Andrew Sorenson&#x27;s epidemiology class while chanting words of protest against The Machine.

Internet voting debuted in 2003, but the results were ruled invalid after allegations of fraud and the election was repeated with paper ballots the following week. During the next election in 2004 SGA senate candidate Emeline Aviki, a member of Chi Omega who openly refused to be affiliated with the Machine, detailed the alleged harassment she received for the &quot;Crimson White&quot;, which used it for an exposé entitled &quot;You don&#x27;t want to mess with us.&quot; Though Aviki&#x27;s campaign was successful, &quot;the emotional and psychological toll the event caused&quot; led her to transfer to Duke University, where she went on to serve as class president.

=== Allegations of interference in Tuscaloosa municipal elections ===
Controversy surrounding The Machine reemerged in August 2013, when sororities and fraternities were mobilized to elect two former SGA presidents, Cason Kirby and Lee Garrison, in closely contested municipal school board races. Before election day, questions about illegal voter registration were raised when evidence emerged that indicated eleven fraternity members fraudulently claimed to be living in a single house in a specific school district. And on election day, leaked emails suggested that sorority/fraternity members may have been provided incentives to vote—including free drinks at local bars. As a result of possible voter fraud, Kirby&#x27;s and Garrison&#x27;s opponents refused to concede, and University of Alabama faculty have questioned whether The Machine has corrupted the democratic process in the City of Tuscaloosa.

=== Election of Elliot Spillers ===
In 2015, independent student Elliot Spillers was elected to the presidency, beating the Machine for the first time since Merrill. His election was followed by political stagnation, including the Senate initially blocking the confirmation of his chief of staff, Chisolm Allenlundy, before the administration forced the confirmation. The incident was reported in a few media outlets, and calls again came pressuring the university administration to take action against the organization.

=== Election of Jared Hunter ===
In 2017, the Machine backed an African American, Jared Hunter, for SGA President for the first time in its history. Hunter acknowledged his support from the Machine in an op-ed for the Crimson White during campaign season. Despite calls for his withdrawal over the article, as well as allegations of campaign finance violations, Hunter won the election and subsequently served until his resignation over a DUI arrest in early 2018.

<doc id="1075522" wikidata="Q280810" url="?curid=1075522" title="Behind the Mask (album)">
<text>Behind the Mask is the fifteenth studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 9 April 1990. It was the first album released by the band after the departure of guitarist Lindsey Buckingham (although he did play acoustic guitar on the album&#x27;s title track). He was replaced by Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, both guitar players, singers and songwriters. Fleetwood Mac thus became a six-piece band with four singer/songwriters.

The album was not as successful as its predecessor, &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, nor did it spawn any big hit singles, although &quot;Save Me&quot; made both American and Canadian Top 40, while &quot;Love Is Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Skies the Limit&quot; enjoyed some airplay. Though &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; barely reached the US Top 20, the album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1 and achieved platinum status there. Following the album&#x27;s release and subsequent world tour, band members Stevie Nicks and Rick Vito left the band, though Nicks would rejoin in 1997. The song &quot;Freedom&quot; was written by Stevie Nicks with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell. Campbell would join Fleetwood Mac in 2018.

The cover for the album was created by photographer Dave Gorton. He stated that the band did not wish to appear on a front picture and Mick Fleetwood himself suggested that he create an image that &quot;spiritually symbolised&quot; the band instead. The cover earned a Grammy nomination in 1991 for &quot;Best Album Package&quot;.

The original CD release for the album was one of the first to be encoded with the CD+G format, which allows graphics to be shown on a TV screen in time with the music, such as pictures and lyrics.

==Background==
In 1987, shortly after the release of &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, long-time guitarist/vocalist/producer Lindsey Buckingham had left the band. For the accompanying tour, the band recruited Billy Burnette and Rick Vito to replace him. Once the tour wrapped up, Fleetwood Mac went into the studio to record two new songs for their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation album, released in 1988. The new members got the opportunity to record a full album in 1989 when the band began the &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; sessions.

In need of a new producer, the band first selected Don Gehman, who had produced for John Mellencamp and R.E.M. The initial sessions did not work out, so the band instead hired Greg Ladanyi, who previously worked with Don Henley on his solo albums. Ladanyi was suggested by George Hawkins, who played and sang on Mick Fleetwood&#x27;s first two solo records. Although Buckingham did play acoustic guitar on the title track, &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; deviated from the ornate production found on earlier Fleetwood Mac albums in favor of adult-oriented rock. As noted by Nicks, the album was easier to record compared to their other work. &quot;It&#x27;s not that we didn&#x27;t take as much time, it&#x27;s more that the time that we did take was quality time. So it therefore did not seem to take nearly as long.&quot; The band spent around eight months making &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The album received mixed to negative reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the album &quot;pretty bland&quot; and likened it to a &quot;an anthology of miscellaneous solo projects.&quot; AllMusic retrospectively gave the album 1.5/5 stars, their lowest rating of any Fleetwood Mac album, calling Buckingham&#x27;s departure &quot;a severe blow&quot; for the band and saying that &quot;the songs are among the least inspired the band ever recorded.&quot;

Other critics, however, praised the new line-up. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the album 3.5/5 stars, commenting that &quot;[w]ithout Buckingham&#x27;s obsessively unique vision, the group has embraced an all-for-one, one-for-all attitude for what sounds like the most truly group effort since &quot;Rumours&quot;, or perhaps even since 1972&#x27;s &quot;Bare Trees&quot;.&quot;&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated it as 4/5 stars, claiming that &quot;the addition of Rick Vito and Billy Burnette is the best thing to ever happen to Fleetwood Mac&quot; and that &quot;[n]ot since &quot;Rumours&quot; has Fleetwood Mac recorded pain so unwaveringly and sounded this together.&quot;

<text>Riquewihr (; Alsatian: ; ) is a commune in the Haut-Rhin department in Grand Est in north-eastern France.

A popular tourist attraction for its historical architecture, Riquewihr is also known for the Riesling and other wines produced in the village. Riquewihr looks today more or less as it did in the 16th century. It is located on the Route des Vins (The Wines Road), close to Colmar.

==Geography==

Riquewihr is from Colmar and close to other Alsatian villages such as Ribeauvillé, Hunawihr, Eguisheim and Kaysersberg.

==History==
Originally the property of the Dukes of Württemberg, the town was converted to Protestantism in the 16th century. Historically, Riquewihr served as a Winzerdorf or &quot;wine village&quot; as a trading hub for Alsatian and German wine.
==Sights==
Riquewihr was one of the few towns in the area not to be badly damaged during World War II. The town is surrounded by its medieval fortifications and is overlooked by a castle from the same period that is today a museum.

There is a museum about Alsace during World War II and a torture chamber (&quot;La salle de torture&quot;).

The village is a member of the &quot;Les Plus Beaux Villages de France&quot; (&quot;The most beautiful villages of France&quot;) association.

<doc id="1075543" wikidata="Q6752001" url="?curid=1075543" title="Manteca (band)">
<text>Manteca is a Canadian jazz fusion band that toured during the 1980s and 1990s. It was formed by percussionist Matt Zimbel and bassist Henry Heillig in 1979.

Their repertoire consisted of pieces composed by keyboardist Aaron Davis and Rick Tait, and, after he replaced Davis on keyboards in 1992, Gordon Sheard. In addition to having horn sections and Latin and African percussion, they included synthesizers, creating music in a &quot;pan-fusion&quot; style, essentially jazz improvisation drawing from salsa, samba, funk and tribal influences.

The band began playing in Toronto in 1979, and by 1987 were touring annually in Canada. Their US debut was at the Concord Jazz Festival in 1989, and they played at the North Sea, Pori and Stockholm jazz festivals in 1990.

They received a Juno award in 1989 for Instrumental Artist of the Year.

After a hiatus, Manteca released a new album, &quot;Onward&quot; in 2007, and resumed touring. &quot;Onward&quot; included some different instruments, such as EWI (Electronic Wind Instrument) and pennywhistle. Guest composers for this album are Gord Sheard and Doug Wilde.

Other members of the band have included keyboardist Aaron Davis, saxophonist John Johnson, Gordon Sheard, Wayne Baker, Herb Koffman, Rick Tait, Steve McDade, Kirk MacDonald, Ralph Bowen, Gary Boigon, Phil Dwyer, Earl Leader, Norman Jones, Art Avalos, Mike Sloski, David James and Charlie Cooley.

<text>Damien Peter O&#x27;Connor (born 16 January 1958) is a New Zealand Labour Party politician who served as Minister of Agriculture, Minister for Biosecurity, Minister for Trade and Export Growth, Minister for Land Information and Minister for Rural Communities in the Sixth Labour Government. He previously served as a cabinet minister in the Fifth Labour Government. He had been a member of Parliament since 1993 and represented the West Coast-Tasman electorate. he is on the Labour list.

==Early years==
O&#x27;Connor was born in Westport in 1958. He attended primary school in his home town before going on to St Bede&#x27;s College, Christchurch, a Roman Catholic school, and Lincoln University.

Before becoming an MP, he worked in a variety of jobs in farming and tourism. During a five-year stint in Australia, he worked as a machinery operator and in sales. On his return to New Zealand he established Buller Adventure Tours, an adventure tourism company, which he owned and operated in a partnership.

==Member of Parliament==





===Fourth National Government, 1993–1999===
He was first elected to Parliament in the 1993 election, recapturing the West Coast seat for Labour after the upset victory of National&#x27;s Margaret Moir in the 1990 election.

When Helen Clark successfully challenged Mike Moore for the party leadership after the election, O&#x27;Connor supported Moore. Later, he said in 2018 that this had set his career back. Unlike other MPs who entered Parliament in 1993, O&#x27;Connor was not named a minister in Clark&#x27;s first ministry in 1999. He was, however, appointed as chair of the Primary Production select committee.

He won the reconfigured West Coast-Tasman seat in the 1996 election, and was the MP for the electorate until he lost it to National&#x27;s Chris Auchinvole during the 2008 election.

===Fifth Labour Government, 1999–2008===
After the 2002 election he was appointed an associate minister in four portfolios: agriculture, health, racing and rural affairs. He succeeded Annette King as Minister for Racing in a 2003 reshuffle.

After the 2005 election, in what would become the final term of the Fifth Labour Government, O&#x27;Connor was promoted to be Minister of Corrections and Minister of Tourism. He lost the Corrections role in 2007, following calls for his resignation over the previous year over the murder of Liam Ashley in a prison van and a scandal where he was found to have brought a suspended prison officer on a parliamentary rugby tour.

===Fifth National Government, 2008–2017===
At the 2008 general election, the Labour government was defeated by the National Party and O&#x27;Connor lost the West-Coast Tasman electorate to National Party list MP Chris Auchinvole by 971 votes. At this election O&#x27;Connor also stood as a list candidate for the first time since 1996; however, his position of 37 was too low for him to return to Parliament as a Labour Party list MP immediately. O&#x27;Connor eventually returned to Parliament after the retirement of former deputy leader Michael Cullen in May 2009. He retook West-Coast Tasman for Labour in 2011 and has held the seat since, defending challenges from former Westland District Mayor Maureen Pugh in 2014 and 2017.

In Opposition between 2009 and 2017, O&#x27;Connor held various spokesperson roles including agriculture, biosecurity, fisheries, food safety, primary industries and rural affairs.

===Sixth Labour Government, 2017–2023===
When the Labour Party formed a coalition government with New Zealand First and the Greens in 2017, O&#x27;Connor was appointed Minister of Agriculture, Minister for Biosecurity, Minister for Food Safety, Minister for Rural Communities and Associate Minister (later Minister of State) for Trade and Export Growth. An early challenge for O&#x27;Connor in the Agriculture portfolio was managing the 2017 Mycoplasma bovis outbreak, opting to attempt eradication to save the projected $1.3 billion cost in lost production to the industry over 10 years, with ongoing productivity losses across the farming sector. On Agriculture, O&#x27;Connor has said there is a new “collective wisdom through generational change in farming, which means we are more closely aligned than some on the fringes wish to portray’’.

During the 2020 general election, O&#x27;Connor was re-elected in West Coast-Tasman by a final margin of 6,208 votes, defeating National&#x27;s candidate Maureen Pugh. In early November 2020, O&#x27;Connor maintained his Agriculture, Biosecurity, and Rural Communities ministerial portfolios while becoming the lead Minister for Trade and Export Growth and assuming the Land Information ministerial portfolio.

In late January 2021, O&#x27;Connor drew media attention when he stated during an interview with CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Asia Squawk Box&quot; &quot;Australia &quot;should follow us [New Zealand] and show respect to China.&quot; His comments came at a time of heightened Australian-China tensions relating to Australian legislation targeting foreign investment and Chinese trade sanctions against Australia. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s remarks were criticised as unhelpful to Australia and &quot;at odds with reality&quot; by Liberal MP Dave Sharma. While the Chinese state-owned newspaper &quot;Global Times&quot; praised Wellington&#x27;s perceived openness towards Beijing, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s remarks were criticised by Victoria University of Wellington academic Robert Ayson, International Service for Human Rights director Phil Lynch and Human Rights Watch director Elaine Person for implying that New Zealand was prioritising trade with China over human rights. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, O&#x27;Connor has since said it is important New Zealand does not send ministers to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games, stating &quot;we&#x27;ve been very strong on those issues around human rights and unnecessary discrimination. We should continue to do that.&quot;

O&#x27;Connor has led various trade negotiations across the world in his role as Minister for Trade and Export Growth, including an historic $1.8 Billion EU Free Trade Agreement in 2022. O&#x27;Connor was the Facilitator of the Fishing Subsidy negotiations at the 12th World Trade Organisation Conference and delivered an agreement with new rules barring countries from subsidising illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.

At the 2022 Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum ministers’ meeting, O&#x27;Connor joined a staged walkout when the Russian Minister spoke, with the shared statement including “We condemn in the strongest terms, the unprovoked war of aggression by Russia against Ukraine.&quot;

In early July 2023, O&#x27;Connor accompanied Prime Minister Chris Hipkins to Brussels for the signing of the New Zealand-European free trade agreement. He described the agreement as a &quot;bloody good deal&quot; that had involved several years of tough negotiations. The European Parliament subsequently ratified the NZ-EU free trade agreement on 23 November 2023.

During the 2023 New Zealand general election, O&#x27;Connor was unseated by National MP Maureen Pugh, who won the West Coast-Tasman by a margin of 1,017 votes. Despite losing his seat, O&#x27;Connor was re-elected to Parliament on the Labour Party list.

In mid November 2023, O&#x27;Connor represented New Zealand at the 2023 APEC summit since incoming Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was unable to attend due to ongoing coalition-forming negotiations with the ACT and New Zealand First parties.

===Sixth National Government, 2023–present===
Following the formation of the National-led coalition government in late November 2023, O&#x27;Connor became spokesperson for trade and associate spokesperson for foreign affairs and transport in the Shadow Cabinet of Chris Hipkins.

In late June 2024, O&#x27;Connor received a 60,000-strong petition at Parliament demanding that the National-led government not proceed with plans to reverse the previous Labour government&#x27;s ban on live-animal exports.

== Political views ==
O&#x27;Connor is regarded as an &quot;economic dry&quot; on the right of the Labour Party. His approach to life and politics in New Zealand is very “upfront and honest’’.

In April 2011 O&#x27;Connor attracted criticism from Labour Party leader Phil Goff after describing the list MP selection process as being run by &quot;self-serving unionists and a gaggle of gays.&quot; O&#x27;Connor was disappointed the system did not deliver better results for rural and provincial candidates, such as himself, who were outside the party&#x27;s power blocs, and apologised for his comments. He is a staunch advocate for the rural and provincial people with strong family ties to the Labour Party&#x27;s establishment.

He has stated that the “timing and decisions’’ on some of Parliament’s conscience votes may have portrayed him as something else, but that’s “a long way from the truth’’. In 2012, he was one of four Labour MPs who voted against the Marriage Amendment Bill, which permitted same sex marriage in New Zealand. He has since attended the Pride Parade in London with his daughter who, in 2012, publicly challenged him on his vote stating &quot;Why should they be denied the same human right everyone else is entitled to just because they love someone the same sex?&quot;

In 2014, O&#x27;Connor voted with the governing National Party (and against the Labour Party) to support the West Coast Windblown Timber Bill, which allowed the Government to recover storm-blow timber on the West Coast following Cyclone Ita.

O&#x27;Connor does not oppose euthanasia, but has voted cautiously on the matter to ensure legislation is strong enough to protect society&#x27;s most vulnerable. He voted against Michael Laws&#x27; Death with Dignity Bill in 1995, Peter Brown&#x27;s Death with Dignity Bill in 2003 and David Seymour&#x27;s End of Life Choice Bill in 2019. He also opposed the Abortion Legislation Bill in 2020, but voted in favour in its first reading. He has since stated he &quot;absolutely do[es] support New Zealand&#x27;s laws on abortion&quot; and, relating to the overturning of &quot;Roe v Wade&quot; in the United States, said &quot;what we see coming from the US is clearly disturbing and shocking&quot;. O&#x27;Connor has stated he believes in a woman&#x27;s right to choose without judgement, but believed the bill required a &quot;technical protection&quot; for the premises of gender or disability.

In December 2023, O&#x27;Connor described Israel&#x27;s actions in Gaza during the 2023 Israel-Hamas war as amounting to genocide. He stated &quot;that no person with any ounce of moral courage can see this as anything but horrific, nothing more than a genocide.&quot; In response, Labour leader Chris Hipkins and fellow Labour MP Phil Twyford clarified that O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s remarks did not represent the Labour Party&#x27;s position on the conflict.

==Business activities==
O&#x27;Connor is past president of the Buller Promotion Association, a member of the West Coast Tourism Development Group, a member of the West Coast Business Development Board and a founding director of Buller Community Development Company. He also won West Coast Young Farmer of the Year.

== Personal life ==
O&#x27;Connor separated from his wife Vicky after twelve years of marriage in 2004. The couple had four children. He has a daughter with his new partner, Sharon Flood. Labour Party MP for Ōhāriu and former Police Association president Greg O&#x27;Connor is his cousin.

<text>Raymond Albert Speaker, (born December 13, 1935) is a Canadian politician. Speaker was born and raised in Enchant, Alberta, where he farms to this day. He served in the Alberta legislature and the Canadian Parliament for a total of 34 years.

==Provincial politics==

Speaker graduated from the University of Alberta and taught in local schools until 1962. In the 1963 Alberta general election he was elected in the rural riding of Little Bow under the banner of the Social Credit Party of Alberta. In 1967 he was named to Ernest Manning&#x27;s cabinet as minister without portfolio, and in 1968 he was named Minister of Health and Social Development and Minister of Personnel. In 1969 he became Chairman of the Human Resources Development Authority under Manning&#x27;s successor, Harry Strom.

He remained a Social Credit MLA for many years after the party lost power in the 1971 election, usually winning handily even as the party&#x27;s support ebbed away in the rest of the province. When Bob Clark resigned the party leadership in 1980, a few months after losing the 1979 election, Speaker became parliamentary leader of the party and hence Leader of the Opposition. However, in 1982, Speaker announced that Social Credit would be sitting out that year&#x27;s election due to dwindling support for the party. A few months earlier, Clark&#x27;s former seat had been resoundingly lost in a by-election, costing Social Credit official party status. Speaker&#x27;s announcement was disavowed by party officials, and a motion to dissolve the party failed. Soon after the election was called, Speaker and Walt Buck resigned from the party and were re-elected as independents.

Denied funding guaranteed to political parties, Speaker and Buck formed a new right-wing party, the Representative Party of Alberta, and Speaker was elected its leader. It styled itself a modern version of Social Credit without the social credit monetary policy, and was intended to be a home for former Socreds. However, in 1989, Speaker crossed the floor to the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta. He was re-elected with 70 percent of the vote in 1989, his best showing at the polls. Following that election, he was named to the cabinet as Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs.

Speaker was the last surviving member of the last Socred government, as well as the last parliamentary survivor of the Manning and Strom governments.

==National politics==

Speaker sought and won the nomination of the Reform Party of Canada for the seat of Lethbridge in the federal Paarliament. He won handily, and served as finance critic and House Leader of the Reform caucus. He retired from politics at the 1997 election.

== After politics ==
In 1999, Speaker was appointed to the Security Intelligence Review Committee, an agency which provides an external review of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, and was named to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

In 2001, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

In 2003, he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Lethbridge, Honorary Doctorate of Laws.

After the Conservative Party won a plurality of seats in the 2006 federal election, Speaker was appointed to the Prime Minister&#x27;s transition team. He also was the chair of the Conservative-Canadian Alliance merger.

He was appointed as a mentor for the Trudeau Foundation of Canada in January 2008.

<doc id="1075551" wikidata="Q3487125" url="?curid=1075551" title="A Taste of Armageddon">
<text>&quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; is the twenty-third episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Robert Hamner and Gene L. Coon and directed by Joseph Pevney, it was first broadcast on February 23, 1967.

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; visits a planet engaged in a completely computer-simulated war with a neighboring planet, but the casualties, including the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s crew, are supposed to be real.

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; travels to Eminiar VII in &quot;star cluster NGC 321&quot;, bringing Ambassador Robert Fox to establish diplomatic relations. Little is known about Eminiar VII, beyond the fact that they have been at war with a neighboring planet, Vendikar.

Nearing Eminiar VII, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; receives a message from the planet warning them not to approach, but Ambassador Fox orders Captain Kirk to proceed. Kirk, First Officer Spock, and additional security personnel beam down to the planet, where they are met by representatives Mea 3 and Anan 7. During a supposed attack by Vendikar, Anan 7 explains that the war is conducted as a computer simulation, and that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; has been &quot;destroyed&quot; in the attack. The two planets have a treaty, according to which they must kill the &quot;victims&quot; of every simulated attack. The crew are therefore expected to report to Eminiar&#x27;s disintegration chambers for execution, and Kirk&#x27;s party is taken captive. Spock telepathically plants a suggestion in their jailer&#x27;s mind, allowing them to escape.

Anan 7 uses a voice duplicator to imitate Kirk&#x27;s voice and order the crew to transport down. Scotty, suspicious, has the ship&#x27;s computer analyze the message and confirms it is fake. He orders shields raised. When the crew fails to transport down, Eminiar fires upon them, but the attack is deflected by the shields. Anan 7 then contacts the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, claiming the attack was due to a malfunction. Ambassador Fox, deciding to believe Anan, beams down and is taken to a disintegration chamber, where Spock and the security officers rescue him.

Kirk confronts Anan 7 but is overpowered by guards and taken to the Eminian council chamber. When Anan 7 opens a channel to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Kirk orders Scotty to execute &quot;General Order 24&quot; before being cut off. Kirk explains that he has ordered the ship to destroy everything on the planet within two hours. Panic ensues, allowing Kirk to disarm the guards. Spock arrives, and they destroy the war simulation computers. Anan 7, horrified, protests that a real war will inevitably follow, but Kirk points out that Vendikar is no doubt just as horrified, and that both sides now have an incentive to make peace. He suggests that Anan 7 call a ceasefire and begin peace negotiations, and Fox agrees to act as a neutral mediator.

==Reception==
The title of &quot;Armageddon Game&quot;, a 1994 episode of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, was chosen by writer Robert Hewitt Wolfe as an homage to this episode.

Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &quot;B+&quot; rating. He described the story as &quot;one of &quot;Trek&quot;″s classic allegorically powerful, common sense implausible scenarios.&quot; Handlen criticised a premise that had &quot;a few too many holes to sustain its attempts at profundity&quot; but praised the story&#x27;s ambition.

In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; rated &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; the 53rd best television episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise television prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, including live-action and the animated series, but not counting the movies. Out of just the original series episodes, they ranked it the 18th best episode. In 2016, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; the 11th best episode of the original series.

In 2017, it was rated the 8th most hopeful &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which despite some grim scenes culminates in the ending of a 500-year-old war. In 2017, &quot;Business Insider&quot; listed &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; as one of the most underrated episodes of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2018, &quot;Collider&quot; ranked this episode the 8th best original series episode.

In 2020, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked it as the 8th best episode of TOS to re-watch.

In 2021, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked this the number one episode of the original series. That year, the episode was quoted by characters in the science fiction show &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, in the episode &quot;Triage,&quot; where &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; was compared to the series&#x27; alternate history Cold War setting.

<text>Te Whakamaharatanga Okeroa (born 1946) is a former New Zealand politician of the New Zealand Labour Party. He represented the Te Tai Tonga Māori electorate as a Member of Parliament from 1999 to 2008.

== Early life and career ==
Okeroa was born in Waitara, Taranaki and grew up in Parihaka. He has iwi affiliations to Te Ātiawa, Ngāti Maniapoto, Taranaki, Ngāti Ruanui and Ngā Rauru. He trained and worked as a teacher before joining the Ministry of Education as a Māori education advisor and Te Puni Kōkiri as director for the Taranaki region.

== Member of Parliament ==

Okeroa sought the Labour Party candidacy in Te Tai Hauāuru in 1998 (for the 1999 general election), but lost to Labour list MP Nanaia Mahuta. He was instead selected for Te Tai Tonga, the Māori electorate covering the South Island and Wellington city. He was successful, defeating the incumbent Tu Wyllie of the New Zealand First Party. Okeroa held the electorate in 2002 and 2005.

In his first term as an MP, Okeroa was deputy chair of the Social Services select committee and a member of the Māori Affairs committee. In his second term, he was chair of the Māori Affairs committee and a member of the law and order committee. From July 2004, he held additional appointments as parliamentary under-secretary to the Minister of Māori Affairs and to the Minister of Education.

After the 2005 general election, Okeroa was appointed a minister outside of Cabinet holding associate ministerial portfolios for Arts, Culture and Heritage; Conservation and Social Development and Employment.

In the 2008 general election, Rahui Katene of the Māori Party out-polled Okeroa by a margin of 1,049 votes. Okeroa&#x27;s party list placement of 40 meant he was not able to immediately be elected as a list MP. He declined to re-enter Parliament as a list MP after the resignation of Darren Hughes in 2011 and did not stand for the general election later that year. He was succeeded as Labour&#x27;s Te Tai Tonga candidate by Rino Tirikatene.

== Post-parliamentary career ==
Okeroa was elected to the Port Nicholson Block Settlement Trust in 2009 and succeeded Sir Ngātata Love as chair in October 2012 after the latter was removed, following a Serious Fraud Office investigation. Okeroa held the chair until October 2013 when he was replaced by Neville Baker. Okeroa&#x27;s resignation from the Trust was announced the following year.

He has also been a trustee of the Wellington Tenths Trust.

<text>John James Beckley (August 4, 1757 – April 8, 1807) was an American political campaign manager and the first Librarian of the United States Congress, from 1802 to 1807. He is credited with being the first political campaign manager in the United States and for setting the standards for the First Party System.

==Early years==
Born in London, Beckley&#x27;s parents sent him at the age of 11 to the Colony of Virginia as an indentured servant. John James Beckley was sold to the mercantile firm of John Norton &amp; Son in response to a request for a scribe by John Clayton, and he arrived in Virginia just before his 12th birthday. Clayton guided Beckley&#x27;s continuing education, and in working with Clayton, Beckley was introduced to many influential members of the colony. When Clayton died in December 1773, Beckley chose to remain in Virginia rather than return to London.

Contrary to many reports, he was never a student at the College of William and Mary. Phi Beta Kappa society had its beginning at the College of William and Mary on December 5, 1776. Since Beckley was not a student at the college, he was not eligible for membership. On December 10, 1778, the constitution of the society was broadened to permit the election of non-students, and a few months later, on April 10, 1779, Beckley was elected. Within a month, as might have been predicted, he was chosen clerk, or secretary.

==Career==
In June of 1782, Beckley participated in the first election of the city of Richmond, Virginia and was one of the 12 elected councilmen. In 1783, he was elected mayor of Richmond, a role in which he would serve three times. By this time, he had amassed of rich, unoccupied land in the west, but it was tied up in litigation. Beckley was a Freemason, and in 1785 participated in a fundraising effort which was responsible for constructing Mason&#x27;s Hall in Richmond.

James Madison sponsored him as Clerk of the House in 1789. When the position of Librarian of Congress was established on January 26, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson asked his friend and political ally John Beckley—who also was serving as the Clerk of the House of Representatives—to fill the post. As the first Librarian of Congress he was paid $2 a day. Beckley served concurrently in both positions until his death in 1807. He associated with the radicals (especially fellow immigrants) and became an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution. He wrote frequently for Philip Freneau&#x27;s &quot;National Gazette&quot; and Benjamin Bache&#x27;s &quot;General Advertiser&quot;, becoming known as an articulate exponent of American republicanism. He used the press energetically to denounce Hamilton and the Federalists as crypto-monarchists whose corruption was subversive of American values. He frequently published his writings under the pseudonym of &quot;Americanus&quot;

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1791.

==Political activities==
In the late 1780s, Beckley was made responsible for managing a set of 12 new amendments to the Constitution. Those were sent to the states in September 1789, and 10 of them were ratified by December 15, 1791. Those first 10 amendments to the Constitution are now known as the Bill of Rights.

By 1792, he had started a propaganda machine for the new Republican Party that Jefferson and Madison were forming. Thus, he told Madison in May 1795, &quot;I enclose eight copies of the &#x27;Political Observations.&#x27; I brought two dozen from New York and have distributed them all. I expect 50 more in a day or two, and shall scatter them also—they were bought and dispersed in great numbers there, and are eagerly enquired after by numbers here—it will be republished in Boston, Portsmouth, Vermont, and at Richmond.&quot; Also in 1792, he brought to light Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s relationship with James Reynolds and his wife Maria. This led to James Monroe, Congressmen Muhlenberg (PA) and Venable (VA) confronting the Treasury Secretary on December 15, 1792. Hamilton denied any financial wrongdoing but admitted to an affair with the wife Maria and paying hush money to her husband. The Republicans agreed to keep the matter confidential and it did not become public until 1797.

In 1795, he took the lead in denouncing Jay&#x27;s Treaty and had emerged as the most visible spokesman of the new Republican Party. Writing under the sobriquet of &quot;A Calm Observer,&quot; in 1796 he charged that, among other heinous offenses, George Washington had stolen public funds and that he richly deserved impeachment.

In 1796, he managed the Jefferson campaign in Pennsylvania, blanketing the state with agents who passed out 30,000 hand-written tickets, naming all 15 electors (printed tickets were not allowed). Thus, he told one agent, &quot;In a few days a select republican friend from the City will call upon you with a parcel of tickets to be distributed in your County. Any assistance and advice you can furnish him with, as to suitable districts &amp; characters, will I am sure be rendered. He is one of two republican friends, who have undertaken to ride thro&#x27; all the middle &amp; lower counties on this business, and bring with them 6 or 8 thousand tickets.&quot; Beckley thus became the first American professional campaign manager. Federalists had him removed as House clerk in 1797. His allies in Pennsylvania soon found him a state job and he became even more active in promoting the Jefferson candidacy in 1800. Jefferson rewarded him with his old post of Clerk of the United States House of Representatives; Beckley got the House to add on the title of Librarian of Congress.

==Family==
Beckley married Maria Prince, the daughter of a retired ship captain, just before Congress moved from New York to Philadelphia, where the two would live from 1791 until 1801.
Their son, Alfred Beckley, was born May 26, 1802. Alfred would go on to found the town of Beckley on the western lands (now in West Virginia), and named it in honor of his father. His home, Wildwood, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

<text>Île aux Cygnes (; ) is a small artificial island on the river Seine in Paris, France, in the 15th arrondissement. It was created in 1827 to protect the bridge named the Pont de Grenelle. It should not be confused with an earlier Île des Cygnes that was attached to the Champ de Mars in the late 18th century.

The uninhabited island is 850 metres (2,789 ft) long and 11 metres (36 ft) at its widest point, making it the third-largest island in Paris. A tree-lined walkway, named L&#x27;Allée des Cygnes (Path of Swans), runs the length of the island. Since 2012, there has been a public workout space with bicycles and a climbing wall underneath the Pont de Grenelle, close to a Statue of Liberty replica.

The island is crossed by three bridges: the Pont de Grenelle, the Pont Rouelle and the Pont de Bir-Hakeim. It is served by the Passy and Bir-Hakeim Métro stations.

==Statue of Liberty replica==
A notable feature is a quarter-scale replica of Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi&#x27;s &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;, commonly known as the Statue of Liberty on the Île aux Cygnes. The replica is 11.50 meters (37 feet 9 inches) tall and faces west in the direction of its larger rendition in New York City. Inaugurated by President Marie François Sadi Carnot on 4 July 1889, nearly three years after its US counterpart, it was donated to the city by the Parisian expatriate community in the US. A restoration project in 1986 marked the centennial of the original (as stated on the plaque).

The statue originally faced east, toward the Eiffel Tower, but it was turned west in 1937 for the world&#x27;s fair hosted in Paris that year. At its base is a commemorative plaque, and the tablet in its left hand bears the inscription &quot;IV Juillet 1776 = XIV Juillet 1789&quot;, recognizing the American Independence Day and the French Bastille Day.

In 1998 to celebrate the &quot;Year of France in Japan&quot;, the 14-ton statue was transported to Japan and displayed on Odaiba, an artificial island in Tokyo Bay, before returning to Paris the following year. The statue was used as a plot point in the 1988 film &quot;Frantic&quot;, the 2007 film &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot; and the 2016 film Lost in Paris.

<doc id="1075584" wikidata="Q1406465" url="?curid=1075584" title="The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)">
<text>The Dance is a live album by the British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 19 August 1997. It hailed the return of the band&#x27;s most successful lineup of Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Stevie Nicks, who had not released an album together since 1987&#x27;s &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, a decade earlier. It was the first Fleetwood Mac release to top the U.S. album charts since 1982&#x27;s &quot;Mirage&quot;.

==History==
Recorded during a concert on 23 May 1997, &quot;The Dance&quot; was the last Fleetwood Mac album to feature Christine McVie as a full-time member before she left a year after the album&#x27;s release (she would return to tour with the band in 2014). Debuting at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of 199,000, &quot;The Dance&quot; became the fifth best-selling live album of all time in the United States, selling a million copies within eight weeks, spending more than seven months within the top 40, and eventually selling over 6,000,000 copies worldwide. The DVD version has been certified 9× platinum in Australia for selling 135,000 copies. The 44 date tour grossed $36 million.

Unlike 1980&#x27;s &quot;Live&quot;, which was a collection of live recordings over a series of 60 shows, &quot;The Dance&quot; was recorded in one night, albeit with good isolation to allow for overdubs. The concert was recorded for Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s MTV&quot; The Dance&quot; special at Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California, and features the University of Southern California Marching Band who perform on the tracks &quot;Tusk&quot; (having played on the original studio recording) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;.

Although the album is predominantly a live greatest hits package, &quot;The Dance&quot; also features new material written by each of the primary songwriting members of the band (with two from Buckingham) as well as popular album tracks. &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; was a previously unreleased track when &quot;The Dance&quot; was released, although a studio recording of the song was later included on the &quot;Say You Will&quot; (2003) album. No tracks from the &quot;Mirage&quot; album were included on the CD, although &quot;Gypsy&quot; was included in the video and DVD versions.

&quot;Say You Love Me&quot; received a folk rearrangement that featured a banjo and cocktail drum kit. John McVie also sang backing vocals for this performance. 

The album was titled for Henri Matisse&#x27;s painting, &quot;Dance&quot;, which was at one point intended to be used as the album cover but couldn&#x27;t be licensed. The album cover photo, taken by David LaChapelle, has Mick Fleetwood recreating his pose from the cover of &quot;Rumours&quot;, the band&#x27;s most successful album, and Lindsey Buckingham holding the cane used on the cover of the &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; album, &quot;Rumours&quot;&#x27; predecessor.

This album spawned three singles in the USA: &quot;Landslide&quot;, &quot;The Chain&quot;, and &quot;Silver Springs&quot; which earned the band three Grammy nominations in 1998, in the categories of &quot;Best Pop Album&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Performance by a Group or Duo with Vocal&quot; for &quot;The Chain&quot; and &quot;Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals&quot; for &quot;Silver Springs&quot;. A fourth single, &quot;Temporary One,&quot; was released in some European markets.

Buckingham originally wanted less overlap in the track listing between &quot;The Dance&quot; and their 1980 live album. &quot;At first I thought this should be a more eclectic collection, with different songs that were a little more surprising. But Warner was very upset about that. They wanted more hits. They felt a live album from 1981 was irrelevant, and I guess they were right.&quot;

The band later embarked on a 44-date tour across the United States with one stop in Canada in support of &quot;The Dance&quot;. The setlist was similar to that of the album, but with &quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;My Little Demon&quot; being replaced by &quot;Oh Daddy&quot;, &quot;Second Hand News&quot;, &quot;Stand Back&quot;, &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (a cover of the Beach Boys song from &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;), and &quot;Not That Funny&quot;. &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; was played instead of &quot;Second Hand News&quot; on opening night in Hartford, Connecticut.

<doc id="1075587" wikidata="Q637381" url="?curid=1075587" title="1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system">
<text>The Tri-Service aircraft designation system is a unified system introduced in 1962 by the United States Department of Defense for designating all U.S. military aircraft. Previously, the U.S. armed services used separate nomenclature systems.

Under the tri-service designation system, officially introduced on 18 September 1962, almost all aircraft receive a unified designation, whether they are operated by the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), United States Army, United States Space Force (USSF), or United States Coast Guard (USCG). Experimental aircraft operated by manufacturers or by NASA are also often assigned designations from the X-series of the tri-service system.

The 1962 system was based on the one used by the USAF between 1948 and 1962, which was in turn based on the type, model, series USAAS/USAAC/USAAF system used from 1924 to 1948. The 1962 system has been modified and updated since introduction.

==History==
The Tri-Service system was first enacted on 6 July 1962 by the DoD Directive 4505.6 &quot;Designating, Redesignating, and Naming Military Aircraft&quot; and was implemented via Air Force Regulation (AFR) 66-11, Army Regulation (AR) 700-26, Bureau of Weapons Instruction (BUWEPSINST) 13100.7 on 18 September 1962. Anecdotally, the Tri-Service system was partly brought about due to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara&#x27;s confusion and frustration with the different designation systems the Navy and Air Force used at the time which resulted in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s F4H Phantom II and the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s F-110 Spectre both being used to refer to, essentially, the same fighter aircraft.

The Tri-Service aircraft designation system was presented alongside the 1963 rocket and guided missile designation system in Air Force Regulation (AFR) 82-1/Army Regulation (AR) 70-50/Naval Material Command Instruction (NAVMATINST) 8800.4A (published 27 March 1974) and the two systems have been concurrently presented and maintained in joint publications since.

The most recent changes were mandated by Joint Regulation 4120.15E Designating and Naming Military Aerospace Vehicles and were implemented via Air Force Instruction (AFI) 16-401, Army Regulation (AR) 70-50, Naval Air Systems Command Instruction (NAVAIRINST) 13100.16 on 3 November 2020. The list of military aircraft was maintained via 4120.15-L Model Designation of Military Aerospace Vehicles until its transition to data.af.mil on 31 August 2018.

==Designation system==
The system uses a &quot;Mission-Design-Series&quot; (MDS) designation of the form:
:(Status Prefix)(Modified Mission)(&quot;Basic Mission&quot;)(Vehicle Type)-(&quot;Design Number&quot;)(&quot;Series Letter&quot;)
Of these components, only the &quot;Basic Mission&quot;, &quot;Design Number&quot; and &quot;Series Letter&quot; are mandatory. In the case of special vehicles a &quot;Vehicle Type&quot; symbol must also be included. The U.S. Air Force characterizes this designation system as &quot;MDS&quot;, while the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard continue to refer to it as &quot;Type/Model/Series&quot; (T/M/S).

===Status prefix===
These optional prefixes are attached to aircraft not conducting normal operations, such as research, testing and development. The prefixes are:
* e: Digitally developed
* G: Permanently grounded
* J: Special test, temporary
* N: Special test, permanent
* X: Experimental
* Y: Prototype
* Z: Planning

A temporary special test means the aircraft is intended to return to normal service after the tests are completed, while permanent special test aircraft are not. The Planning code is no longer used but was meant to designate aircraft &quot;on the drawing board&quot;. For example, using this system an airframe such as the F-13 could have initially been designated as ZF-13 during the design phase, possibly XF-13 if experimental testing was required before building a prototype, the YF-13; the final production model would simply be designated F-13 (with the first production variant being the F-13A). Continuing the example, some F-13s during their service life may have been used for testing modifications or researching new designs and designated JF-13 or NF-13; finally after many years of service, the airframe would be permanently grounded due to safety or economic reasons as GF-13.

===Modified mission===
Aircraft which are modified after manufacture or even built for a different mission from the standard airframe of a particular design are assigned a modified mission code. They are:
* A: Attack
* C: Cargo (i.e., transport)
* D: Drone director
* E: Electronic warfare
* F: Fighter
* H: Search and rescue and MEDEVAC
* K: Tanker
* L: Modified for cold weather operations
* M: Multi-mission (i.e., Special Operations)
* O: Observation
* P: Maritime patrol
* Q: Unmanned aerial vehicle
* R: Reconnaissance
* S: Anti-submarine warfare
* T: Trainer
* U: Utility
* V: VIP transport 
* W: Weather reconnaissance

The multi-mission and utility missions could be considered the same thing; however they are applied to multipurpose aircraft conducting certain categories of mission. M-aircraft conduct combat or special operations while U-aircraft conduct combat support missions, such as transport (e.g., UH-60) and electronic warfare (e.g., MC-12). Historically, the vast majority of U.S. Coast Guard air assets included the H-code (e.g., HH-60 Jayhawk or HC-130 Hercules). In the 21st century, the Coast Guard has used the multi-mission designation for their armed rescue helicopters (MH-60 Jayhawk or MH-65 Dolphin).

===Basic mission===
All aircraft are to be assigned a basic mission code. In some cases, the basic mission code is replaced by one of the modified mission codes when it is more suitable (e.g., M in MH-53J Pave Low III). The defined codes are:
* A: Attack aircraft (for &quot;tactical&quot; air-to-surface mission)
* B: Bomber (for &quot;strategic&quot; air-to-surface mission)
* C: Cargo (i.e. Transport)
* E: Special electronic installation
* F: Fighter
* K: Tanker (dropped between 1977 and 1985)
* L: Laser-equipped
* O: Observation (Forward Air Control)
* P: Maritime patrol
* R: Reconnaissance
* S: Anti-submarine warfare
* T: Trainer
* U: Utility
* X: Special research

The rise of the multirole fighter in the decades since the system was introduced has created some confusion about the difference between attack and fighter aircraft. According to the current designation system, an attack aircraft (&quot;A&quot;) is designed primarily for air-to-surface missions (also known as &quot;attack missions&quot;), while a fighter category &quot;F&quot; incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air warfare, but also multipurpose aircraft designed also for attack missions. The Air Force has even assigned the &quot;F&quot; designation to attack-only aircraft, such as the F-111 Aardvark and F-117 Nighthawk.

The only &quot;A&quot; designated aircraft currently in the U.S. Air Force is the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The last front line &quot;A&quot; designated aircraft in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps was the A-6 Intruder, with the only strictly &quot;A&quot; designated fixed-wing aircraft remaining in the sea services being the A-29 Super Tucano leased under the &quot;Imminent Fury&quot; program.

Of these code series, no normal aircraft have been assigned a &quot;K&quot; or &quot;R&quot; basic mission code in a manner conforming to the system.

===Vehicle type===
The vehicle type element is used to designate the type of aerospace craft. Aircraft not in one of the following categories (most fixed-wing aircraft) are not required to carry a type designator. The type categories are:
* D: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control segment
* G: Glider
* H: Helicopter
* Q: Unmanned aerial vehicle
* S: Spaceplane
* V: Vertical take-off/short take-off and landing (VTOL/STOL)
* Z: Lighter-than-air

A UAV control segment is not an aircraft, it is the ground control equipment used to command a UAV. Only in recent years has an aircraft been designated as a spaceplane, the proposed MS-1A.

===Design number===
According to the designation system, aircraft of a particular vehicle type or basic mission (for manned, fixed-wing, powered aircraft) were to be numbered consecutively, and the number series were restarted, causing some redesignated naval aircraft and subsequent new designs to overlap disused USAAC/USAAF designations (e.g., the Lockheed F-5 and Northrop F-5). Numbers were not to be assigned to avoid confusion with other letter sequences or to conform with manufacturers&#x27; model numbers. Recently this rule has been ignored, and aircraft have received a design number equal to the model number (e.g., KC-767A) or have kept the design number when they are transferred from one series to another (e.g., the X-35 became the F-35).

===Series letter===
Different versions of the same basic aircraft type are to be delineated using a single letter suffix beginning with &quot;A&quot; and increasing sequentially (skipping &quot;I&quot; and &quot;O&quot; to avoid confusion with the numbers &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot;). It is not clear how much modification is required to merit a new series letter, e.g., the F-16C production run has varied extensively over time. The modification of an aircraft to carry out a new mission does not necessarily require a new suffix (e.g., F-111Cs modified for reconnaissance are designated RF-111C), but often a new letter is assigned (e.g., the UH-60As modified for Search and Rescue missions are designated HH-60G).

Some series letters have been skipped to forestall confusion with pre-1962 naval designations; for instance, there was no &quot;H&quot; version of the F-4 Phantom II because the aircraft type was previously designated F4H.

==Non-systematic aircraft designations==
Since the 1962 system was introduced there have been several instances of non-systematic aircraft designations and skipping of design numbers.

===Non-systematic or aberrant designations===
The most common changes are to use a number from another series, or some other choice, rather than the next available number (117, 767, 71). Another is to change the order of the letters or use new acronym based letters (e.g. SR) rather than existing ones. Non-systematic designations are both official and correct, since the DOD has final authority to approve such designations.
* A-29
:Briefly designated &quot;A-14A&quot; before being changed to &quot;A-29B&quot; to match the Brazilian designation.

* A-37 Dragonfly
:Used the design number from its parent aircraft, the T-37 Tweet, rather than the next available number in the A series (A-8). Initially designated as the YAT-37D, using an A mission modifier and D series letter that continued the T-37 sequence, but redesignated as the YA-37A during development.

* B-21
:Designated &quot;B-21&quot; as being the first bomber type of the 21st century, rather than the next available number in the B series (B-3).

* E-130J
:Uses both the design number and suffix letter from its parent type, the C-130J Hercules, rather than the next available number in the E series (E-12).

* EA-37B
:Redesignated from EC-37B to better reflect the aircraft&#x27;s capabilities. The new designation conflicts with the A-37B Dragonfly.

* F/A-18 Hornet, also the transient F/A-16 and F/A-22.
:Originally, the Navy planned to have two variants of the Hornet: the F-18 fighter and A-18 light attack aircraft. During development, &quot;F/A-18&quot; was used as a shorthand to refer to both variants. When the Navy decided to develop a single aircraft able to perform both missions, the &quot;F/A&quot; appellation stuck despite the designation system not allowing for slashes or other characters. AF-18 would be conformant. Similar issues existed with the naming of the F-22, which was briefly redesignated F/A-22; a proposed bomber variant was the FB-22 (which, more appropriately, should have been designated BF-22).

* F-15EX Eagle II
:Uses non-standard EX series letters rather than the next available standard series letter (F-15F or F-15L).

* F-35 Lightning II
:Used the design number from its X plane designation (X-35) rather than the next available F series number (24).

* FB-111 Aardvark
:Should have used the next available number in the bomber sequence but &quot;111&quot; was retained for commonality with the F-111 from the pre-1962 system.

* F-117 Nighthawk
:Designated as part of series continuing from the pre-1962 system and latterly used to identify foreign aircraft acquired by the government, e.g., YF-113 was a MiG-23. Additionally, the basic mission designation as fighter implies air-to-air capabilities though the F-117 does not possess any. There have been conjecture and anecdotal reports concerning purported air-to-air capabilities for use against Soviet AWACS craft.

* KC-767
:Skipped hundreds of C-series numbers to use Boeing&#x27;s model number. Has conformant basic mission and modified mission letters. Only used for aircraft sold to foreign air forces. The U.S. Air Force ordered the Boeing 767-based tanker KC-46.

* OA-1K
:Designated as an implied further development of the long-retired and unrelated A-1 Skyraider, of which the A-1J was the last production variant, rather than using the next available number in the A series (14).

* RC-7B
:Designation conflicted with unrelated C-7 Caribou. Was redesignated EO-5C in August 2004.

* SR-71
:The SR-71 designator is a continuation of the pre-1962 bomber series, which ended with the XB-70 Valkyrie. During the later period of its testing, the B-70 was proposed for the Reconnaissance/Strike role, with an &quot;RS-70&quot; designation. The USAF decided instead to pursue the Lockheed A-12 which was dubbed RS-71 (Reconnaissance/Surveillance; unrelated to the S mission designation for anti-submarine warfare). Then-USAF Chief of Staff Gen. Curtis LeMay preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) moniker and wanted the reconnaissance aircraft to be named SR-71. Before the Blackbird was to be announced by President Johnson on 29 February 1964, LeMay lobbied to modify Johnson&#x27;s speech to read SR-71 instead of RS-71. The media transcript given to the press at the time still had the earlier RS-71 designation in places, creating the myth that the president had misread the aircraft&#x27;s designation.

* TR-1
:A variant of the U-2; uses its own modified mission letter (T for Tactical) with basic mission letter (R for Reconnaissance). The U-2 was initially designated as &quot;utility&quot; to obfuscate its reconnaissance capabilities. Following shootdowns of the aircraft, this subterfuge was pointless. The TR-1, first flown in 1981, was re-designated U-2R in 1991 for uniformity.
* MH-139, VH-92 and UC-880
:Skipped numerous H-series numbers to use the civilian models&#x27; number : AW139, S-92 and Convair 880.

===Skipped design numbers===
The design number &quot;13&quot; has been skipped in many mission and vehicle series for its association with superstition. Some numbers were skipped when a number was requested and/or assigned to a project but the aircraft was never built.

The following table lists design numbers in the 1962 system which have been skipped.
: #: A-8 was technically skipped, but the AV-8 Harrier received the number within the &quot;V&quot; vehicle type sequence. Within the V sequence, it should have been designated AV-12 (as the Ryan XV-8 &quot;Fleep&quot; was already in existence). Additionally, the stillborn 1960s General Dynamics Model 100 attack aircraft proposal has been referred to as the A-8A, but it is unclear if it was ever formally granted this designation by the USAF.
:†: The C-42 through C-44 designations were skipped in favor of the KC-45 by Airbus. The designations are considered skipped as the sequence continued in with the C-46 rather than continuing from the last otherwise sequential designation.
: ‡: A top-secret stealth fighter designated F-19 has been rumored to exist for decades, and the rumors gained widespread publicity after the USAF cordoned off a crash site near Nellis Air Force Base in July 1986, but the crashed aircraft was subsequently revealed to have been an F-117, which was still classified at the time. No conclusive evidence of a genuine F-19 program has surfaced.
: *: Skipped to avoid confusion with the North American T-2 Buckeye, which was still in service at the time.
: **: The T-4 and T-5 designations were skipped in favor of T-6 by Raytheon to honor the WW2-era North American T-6 Texan. The designations are considered skipped as the sequence continued with the T-7 rather than continuing from the last otherwise sequential designation.

==Manufacturer&#x27;s code==
Since 1939, a 2-letter manufacturer&#x27;s code has been added to designations to identify the manufacturer and the production plant. For example, F-15E-50-MC, the &quot;MC&quot; being the code for the McDonnell Douglas plant at St. Louis, Missouri.

==Block number==
In 1941, block numbers were added to designations to show minor equipment variations between production blocks. The block number appears in the designation between the model suffix and manufacturers code (for example F-100D-85-NH). Initially, they incremented in numerical order −1, −2, −3 but this was changed to −1, −5, −10, −15 in increments of five. The gaps in the block numbers could be used for post-delivery modifications—for example, a F-100D-85-NH could be modified in the field to F-100D-86-NH. Not all types have used block numbers.

==Concerns and controversies==
===Doping issues===
On October 7, 2002, the Olympic Council of Asia announced that the bodybuilding bronze medalist in the +90 kg weight category Youssef El-Zein of Lebanon was relieved of his medal for not submitting to a drugs test. After El-Zein was disqualified, the bronze medal in the +90 kg category went to Choi Jae-Duck of South Korea (who had finished fourth).

Six days later, Japanese news agency Kyodo News reported that Indian middle-distance runner Sunita Rani had tested positive for a banned substance, which was later confirmed by Lee Choon-Sup, Deputy Secretary General of the Busan Asian Games Organizing Committee; an unofficial report stated that the substance was the anabolic steroid nandrolone. Sunita had won two medals in athletics: a gold in the 1,500 m (setting an Asian Games record) and a bronze in the 5,000 m, (in which Sunita jointly bettered the Games record set by Indonesian Suprianti Sutono in Bangkok during the 1998 Asian Games with six other athletes). The Indian Chef de Mission at the Games backed Sunita—who denied using any banned drug—and asked for a &quot;B&quot; sample test from Bangkok, but tests were run only at the Asian Games’ Doping Control Center (AGDCC) in Seoul (the laboratory accredited by the IOC). On October 16, the AGDCC confirmed the steroid nandrolone in Sunita&#x27;s urine sample; as a consequence, the OCA stripped her of both medals and dismissed her Asian Games record for the 1,500 m.

The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) requested the intervention of the International Association of Athletics Federations and the IOC; the samples were jointly reexamined by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the IOC Sub-Commission on Doping and Biochemistry of Sport. In January 2003, the OCA announced that the IOC Medical Director had cleared Sunita of the doping charge and that appropriate action would be taken against the AGDCC. Both of Sunita&#x27;s medals were reinstated on February 4, 2003, in a ceremony attended by the Secretary General of OCA Randhir Singh and the president of the IOA Suresh Kalmadi.

Three Malaysian sepak takraw players were sent home for failing drug tests after testing positive for morphine.

===Missing athletes===
A total of 16 athletes including 12 Nepalese, three Sri Lankans and one Mongolian were reported to be missing, with police and sports officials suspecting them to have found illegal jobs in South Korea.

<doc id="1075592" wikidata="Q6920119" url="?curid=1075592" title="Mount Chester">
<text>Mount Chester is a mountain located in the Smith-Dorrien Creek Valley of Kananaskis in the Canadian Rockies. The mountain was named in 1917 after HMS &quot;Chester&quot;, which was severely damaged in the Battle of Jutland.

Chester Lake is located in a small valley just northwest of the base of the mountain.

==Geology==
Mount Chester is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Chester is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. In terms of favorable weather, July through September are the best months to climb.

<doc id="1075596" wikidata="Q5638886" url="?curid=1075596" title="Hahn embedding theorem">
<text>In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra dealing with ordered structures on abelian groups, the Hahn embedding theorem gives a simple description of all linearly ordered abelian groups. It is named after Hans Hahn.

==Overview==
The theorem states that every linearly ordered abelian group &quot;G&quot; can be embedded as an ordered subgroup of the additive group formula_1 endowed with a lexicographical order, where formula_2 is the additive group of real numbers (with its standard order), is the set of &quot;Archimedean equivalence classes&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, and formula_1 is the set of all functions from to formula_2 which vanish outside a well-ordered set.
Let 0 denote the identity element of &quot;G&quot;. For any nonzero element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, exactly one of the elements &quot;g&quot; or −&quot;g&quot; is greater than 0; denote this element by |&quot;g&quot;|. Two nonzero elements &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot; of &quot;G&quot; are &quot;Archimedean equivalent&quot; if there exist natural numbers &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; such that &quot;N&quot;|&quot;g&quot;| &gt; |&quot;h&quot;| and &quot;M&quot;|&quot;h&quot;| &gt; |&quot;g&quot;|. Intuitively, this means that neither &quot;g&quot; nor &quot;h&quot; is &quot;infinitesimal&quot; with respect to the other. The group &quot;G&quot; is Archimedean if &quot;all&quot; nonzero elements are Archimedean-equivalent. In this case, is a singleton, so formula_1 is just the group of real numbers. Then Hahn&#x27;s Embedding Theorem reduces to Hölder&#x27;s theorem (which states that a linearly ordered abelian group is Archimedean if and only if it is a subgroup of the ordered additive group of the real numbers).

 gives a clear statement and proof of the theorem. The papers of and together provide another proof. See also .

<text>David William Parker (born 1960) is a New Zealand lawyer, businessman and politician who has been a Labour Party Member of Parliament since 2002.

After a career in law and business, Parker entered Parliament by winning the marginal Otago electorate. He was Attorney-General of New Zealand and a senior Cabinet minister in the Sixth Labour Government between 2017 and 2023, holding the posts of Minister for the Environment, Minister of Transport, Minister for Trade and Export Growth, Minister for Economic Development and Associate Minister of Finance. Parker was also a Cabinet minister in the Fifth Labour Government and a senior figure in the Labour Party opposition between 2008 and 2017, including as deputy leader and interim leader between 2013 and 2014.

==Early life and family==
David Parker was born in Roxburgh to parents Joan (née Pinfold) and Francis Parker. He is the second of four children and grew up in Dunedin, where he attended Otago Boys&#x27; High School. He studied law and business at the University of Otago, graduating with a Bachelor of Commerce in accounting and Bachelor of Laws. While still a student, he co-founded the Dunedin Community Law Centre.

Parker has three children with his ex-wife, the poet Sue Wootton. Since 2011, he has had a relationship with Barbara Ward, a sculptor and Labour Party activist. He lives in Auckland and has a holiday home in Karitane.

== Career ==
Before entering politics, Parker had a career in law and business. He was admitted as a barrister at the High Court in Dunedin on 1 December 1982. His legal career began with general law followed by some time working as a duty solicitor and working in family and environmental law. He was then a resource management law specialist for the firm Anderson Lloyd, based in Queenstown, and a civil litigation specialist and managing partner for the same firm, based in Dunedin.

Parker&#x27;s business career began with a Dunedin café, the Percolator, which he co-owned and ran with his wife. His Labour MP colleague Pete Hodgson said Parker&#x27;s decision to leave legal practice and pursue other activities was because the high charges associated with civil litigation work conflicted with Parker&#x27;s values. Business ventures with Dunedin property developer Russell Hyslop in the late 1990s, including the restoration of Dunedin&#x27;s St James Theatre (now the Rialto Cinema), were unsuccessful and led to Hyslop&#x27;s bankruptcy. In 2006, Parker stated that he, too, had considered voluntarily filing for bankruptcy to &quot;take the easy way out&quot;, but did not. He returned to legal practice for three years before resuming his business career.

Parker was hired by entrepreneur Howard Paterson as a business manager for his agri-biotechnology ventures. Parker said one of his early roles was to identify commercial opportunities emerging out of universities and Crown Research Institutes and develop corporate structures for them. Companies Parker was involved with, including as inaugural chief executive, included A2 Corporation, Blis Technologies, Botryzen and Pharmazen.

==Member of Parliament==



From about 1999, and spurred by his opposition to then government&#x27;s energy reforms, Parker began planning a political career and joined the Labour Party. He was chair of the Dunedin North electorate from 2001 and was selected as Labour candidate in Otago for the 2002 general election. Otago had previously been regarded as a safe National Party seat but was downgraded to marginal when National&#x27;s support dropped ahead of the election. Ranked an unwinnable 47th place on the party list, and himself not expecting to make it into Parliament, Parker won an upset victory over the incumbent, Gavan Herlihy, by 648 votes. While he was unsuccessful in holding Otago against Jacqui Dean in 2005, it was said that Parker lost by a lesser margin than was expected. He was defeated by Dean in the new Waitaki electorate in 2008. After the breakdown of his marriage in 2009, Parker moved to Auckland where he has twice unsuccessfully contested the Epsom electorate, in 2011 and 2017. Despite these electorate losses, Parker has been returned as a list MP in every election since 2005.

Parker gave his maiden statement to Parliament on 3 September 2002. In his speech, he addressed infrastructure inaffordability in Queenstown and gave his support to the proposed ability of Queenstown-Lakes District Council to collect a visitor level to fund infrastructure improvements. More than 20 years later, the levy remained only a proposal. Parker&#x27;s speech also outlined his early views on the economy. He said he supported waste minimisation efforts and suggested that energy consumption and resource depletion should be added to indicators of economic performance, in addition to gross domestic product (GDP). He criticised the governance of the Reserve Bank by Don Brash, who was by then also a first-term MP, saying that the late 1990s &quot;marked the greatest mismanagement of the New Zealand economy&quot; since the days of Sir Robert Muldoon. He further set out his views that the sale of rural land to non-residents should be controlled &quot;very strict[ly]&quot; and that overtime rates should be reintroduced as an incentive for employers to increase employment and decrease the size of the average working week for workers.

Parker&#x27;s parliamentary roles centred on economic, environmental, and legal portfolios. In his first term, Parker sat on the finance and expenditure committee, the commerce committee, and the regulations review committee. He was promoted in March 2003 to be deputy chair of the local government and environment committee and in February 2005 to be deputy chair of the constitutional arrangements committee. In his second term, he was transport, energy, climate change, and lands minister, and briefly Attorney-General, in Helen Clark&#x27;s Fifth Labour Government (see ).

Labour was in Opposition from 2008 to 2017; Parker was a senior figure during the first six of those years. He was ranked fourth in caucus by leader Phil Goff, third by David Shearer, and second as deputy leader to David Cunliffe. He was shadow attorney-general under all three leaders and additionally served as finance spokesperson under Shearer and Cunliffe. Parker was briefly interim leader after Labour&#x27;s 2014 general election defeat. He unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Labour Party leadership election and was demoted by incoming leader Andrew Little after refusing the finance portfolio, but continued as shadow attorney-general and eventually became environment and foreign affairs spokesperson.

In opposition, Parker chaired the government administration committee from 2008 to 2011 and sat on the justice and electoral committee (2008–2011), finance and expenditure committee (2011–2014), regulations review committee (2014–2017; chair in 2017), local government and environment committee (2015–2017) and foreign affairs, defence and trade committee (2017). He was also a member of the parliamentary privileges committee from 2009 to 2023, including as deputy chair (2012–2017) and chair (2018–2023).

In the Sixth Labour Government, Parker was reappointed as Attorney-General. Through the government&#x27;s six years he was also Minister for the Environment and Associate Minister of Finance. He additionally held the offices of Minister for Economic Development and Minister for Trade and Export Growth in the government&#x27;s first term and Minister for Oceans and Fisheries, Minister of Revenue, and Minister of Transport in the government&#x27;s second term. Parker&#x27;s principal achievements in government were rewriting the country&#x27;s resource management laws and establishing a reporting mechanism on the fairness of the tax system (see ). However, neither survived the government&#x27;s defeat at the 2023 general election. Returning to opposition, Parker was reappointed as chair of the regulations review committee and became Labour&#x27;s shadow attorney-general and spokesperson on foreign affairs and electoral reform in the Shadow Cabinet of Chris Hipkins.

== Minister in the Fifth Labour Government ==
Parker joined the Clark ministry in its third and final term. He was appointed Attorney-General, Minister of Transport, Minister of Energy, and Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues on 19 October 2005. Parker&#x27;s appointment as Attorney-General and &quot;a &quot;de facto&quot; Minister of Infrastructure&quot; in his second term, despite his Otago election defeat, was criticised by the National Party due to his apparent inexperience. Media commentary on Parker&#x27;s promotion and early days in his portfolios focused on his status as one of the &quot;few lawyers&quot; within Labour, his apparent close relationships with the prime minister and deputy prime minister, and the perception that he was a &quot;rising star&quot; of the party.

Parker resigned from the Cabinet in March 2006 (see ) but was reappointed with the energy, climate change, and land information portfolios that May. In July 2007 prime minister Helen Clark appointed Parker as the acting Minister for the Environment following the resignation of David Benson-Pope. Parker was promoted to Minister of State Services, and thirteenth in the Cabinet, on 5 November 2007. During this first term as a minister, Parker was praised for his policy formulation and attention to detail, and was proposed by commentators as a possible successor to Michael Cullen as finance minister.

=== Attorney-General ===
In his first appointment, Parker was Attorney-General for only 152 days, the shortest tenure of any Attorney-General since the 1920s. In his term, he elevated Noel Anderson to the Supreme Court and appointed William Young president of the Court of Appeal.

In March 2006, &quot;Investigate&quot; magazine published allegations by Russell Hyslop that Parker had filed an incorrect declaration with the Companies Office regarding the property company Queens Park Mews Limited, the directors of which were Parker, Hyslop, and Parker&#x27;s father. Parker resigned as Attorney-General on 20 March and resigned from Cabinet the next day. Hyslop&#x27;s charge was that Parker had failed to consult him over the filing as required by law. An inquiry by the Companies Office cleared him of the charge of filing false returns, due to the fact that Hyslop had previously waived that requirement before declaring bankruptcy in 1997, and it was later waived again by the official assignee responsible for Hyslop&#x27;s affairs after the bankruptcy. Clark described Parker as having pleaded guilty to something he was innocent of and reappointed him to Cabinet as Minister of Energy, Minister for Land Information, and Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues on 2 May 2006. Political commentator Colin James wrote of the incident: &quot;[it] must be the world’s first resignation by a minister for something he thought he might conceivably have done but turned out not to have... David Parker is one of the few to end 2006 with reputation enhanced.&quot;

=== Other portfolios ===
As energy minister, Parker&#x27;s priorities were energy supply and competition. Early in his tenure he &quot;ruled out&quot; rolling winter blackouts to manage supply of hydro-generated electricity; however, equipment failures in Auckland led to a significant blackout in 2006. He developed the government&#x27;s national energy strategy, which was announced in 2007, which had a strong focus on energy sustainability. Power shortages were a persistent trend through Parker&#x27;s time in the portfolio, with additional gas-generated electricity commissioned to ease demand in 2008. Parker also reiterated New Zealand&#x27;s commitment to being nuclear free. His proposals to phase out inefficient light bulbs drew criticism of the government&#x27;s &quot;nanny state&quot; approach, leading Parker to brandish modern energy-efficient bulbs as props during one parliamentary debate.

As climate change minister, Parker announced the cancellation of a proposed carbon tax, pursuant to a coalition agreement between Labour and New Zealand First. In its place, Parker proposed Labour&#x27;s flagship climate change mitigation policy, the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, which was legislated as the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008. For his work in the energy and climate change portfolios, Parker was named 2008 Environmentalist of the Year by &quot;The Listener&quot;.

In the transport portfolio, Parker opened consultation on possible toll roads in Auckland, described by &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; as the most &quot;courageous&quot; step towards road pricing undertaken in New Zealand. Appointed state services minister in November 2007, Parker immediately came under pressure when it was revealed he, as climate minister, had suggested the environment ministry hire a Labour activist, Clare Curran, as a communications advisor. An investigation by the State Services Commission cleared Parker of charges of inappropriate ministerial direction, although some commentators like the &quot;Herald&quot;&#x27;s Fran O&#x27;Sullivan and the National Party&#x27;s Gerry Brownlee were highly critical both of the report&#x27;s findings as well as of Parker&#x27;s role and &quot;impatience&quot; in pressuring the environment ministry on a political appointment. As land information minister, he blocked the partial sale of Auckland Airport to the Canada Pension Plan in 2008.

== Opposition, 2008–2017 ==

Following Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 2008 general election, Parker was named spokesperson for ACC and electoral reform, shadow attorney-general, and associate spokesperson for finance in the shadow Cabinet of Phil Goff. The conservation portfolio was added to Parker&#x27;s workload in 2009 and replaced with economic development in 2010. In 2011, ahead of that year&#x27;s election, Parker was elevated to fourth in the Labour caucus and also assigned the energy portfolio. He led Labour&#x27;s campaign against the National government&#x27;s proposed sale of state-owned electricity companies, which resulted in a win at a 2013 referendum but did not prevent any asset sales. He also promoted, for the first time for the Labour Party, a capital gains tax and retirement age increase.

Parker was increasingly seen as a leading figure within the Labour Party. He was described as a top performer in opposition and the &quot;frontrunner&quot; in the party&#x27;s November 2011 leadership election due to his role developing the party&#x27;s policies for that year&#x27;s general election, much of which was seen as moving the party more towards the political left. Critics of Parker saw him as bookish and boring with an understated sense of humour. Parker did enter the leadership election, but withdrew partway through the contest to support David Shearer&#x27;s bid. It was reported that he withdrew because a key backer, Grant Robertson, had shifted his allegiance to Shearer, who defeated David Cunliffe in the election and appointed Parker as the finance spokesperson. By July 2013, Parker had become critical of Shearer&#x27;s leadership. With six other senior MPs, he challenged Shearer to improve. Shearer resigned six weeks later. Cunliffe took over as leader on 15 September 2013; Parker became deputy leader and continued as finance spokesperson and shadow attorney-general.
Following the poor performance of the Labour Party in the 2014 general election, and Cunliffe&#x27;s resignation as leader, Parker was appointed interim leader of the Labour Party. He initially ruled himself out of the ensuing leadership election, but changed his mind. Although he was seen as a frontrunner in the race, he finished third. New leader Andrew Little offered for Parker to continue as finance spokesperson, but Parker declined. Little had campaigned on doing away with Parker&#x27;s economic policies from the previous election, like a capital gains tax and raising the retirement age. Instead, Parker was assigned a range of portfolios including shadow attorney-general and spokesperson for trade and export growth, the environment and, after the resignations of former leaders Goff and Shearer, foreign affairs.

As spokesperson for trade and foreign affairs between 2015 and 2017, Parker prosecuted allegations that foreign affairs minister Murray McCully had deliberately misrepresented an arrangement with businessman Sheikh Hmood Al Ali Al Khalaf. It emerged that McCully had sourced government funding for the development of an &quot;agribusiness hub&quot; promoting New Zealand agriculture in Saudi Arabia, including secret &quot;facilitation payments&quot; of more than $4 million, seemingly to prevent the sheik from suing the New Zealand government. The deal circumvented a ban on live sheep exports for slaughter the sheik disagreed with and was also an attempt by McCully to try to secure Saudi Arabia&#x27;s agreement to a New Zealand–Gulf Cooperation Council free trade agreement. Parker referred the matter to Auditor-General Lyn Provost, who investigated and found that while there was &quot;no evidence of corruption,&quot; the deal amounted to &quot;the settlement of a grievance... provided under the guise of a contract for services [which did] not specifically reflect the settlement component relating to the grievance.&quot; Parker cancelled the arrangement as trade minister in 2019. , the NZGCC FTA is still under negotiation.

Parker was responsible for three members bills in the 2014–2017 term. In 2015 and 2016, he proposed the Minimum Wage (Contractor Remuneration) Amendment Bill, which sought to ensure contract workers could not be remunerated below minimum wage. Although the bill passed its first and second readings, it was voted down in the Committee of the Whole House when Peter Dunne withdrew his support. In June 2016, he took over the Keep Kiwibank Bill from Clayton Cosgrove for its second reading. The bill was defeated by the National-led government, which said it had no intention of selling the bank. The Ombudsmen (Cost Recovery) Amendment Bill was defeated in May 2017.

== Minister in the Sixth Labour Government ==
Following the formation of the Labour–New Zealand First coalition government, Parker was sworn in for a second appointment as Attorney-General and also became Minister for Economic Development, Minister for the Environment, and Minister for Trade and Export Growth. He also became Associate Minister of Finance. The depth and breadth of his portfolios led him to be described as &quot;the minister of almost everything&quot;, an epithet that had previously been given to Sir Michael Cullen. Parker was seen as a trusted confidante of the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and was remarked as having a close relationship with the deputy prime minister, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters. Chess international master and journalist Vernon Small was brought on as Parker&#x27;s press secretary.

Parker&#x27;s economic development portfolio was reassigned to Phil Twyford in June 2019; Ardern said this was so Parker could focus more on domestic water quality proposals and free trade negotiations with the European Union and United Kingdom. In the Labour government&#x27;s second term, from October 2020, he was reappointed as Attorney-General, Minister for the Environment, and Associate Minister of Finance. He also became Minister for Oceans and Fisheries, Minister of Revenue and, briefly in 2023, Minister of Transport. Several commentators saw him as a candidate for foreign affairs minister in 2020; that role instead went to Nanaia Mahuta.

=== Attorney-General ===
During his second period as Attorney-General, Parker made three appointments to the Supreme Court of New Zealand. With prime minister Ardern, Parker oversaw the appointment of Dame Helen Winkelmann as Chief Justice—the first such appointment since the creation of the Supreme Court in 2004—in November 2018. Parker also announced the elevation to the Supreme Court of Sir Joseph Williams in May 2019 and of Sir Stephen Kós in April 2022.

In May 2020, as Attorney-General, Parker led the passage of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 (the PHRA) through Parliament. This provided the legal framework for the Government&#x27;s efforts to combat COVID-19. Shortly before the bill was introduced, Parker gave a lengthy Facebook Live address where he addressed and refuted the claim that the government&#x27;s lockdown direction was unenforceable; the High Court later found that while this was justified, it was not lawful for the first nine days. In an address to the New Zealand Centre for Public Law in December 2021, Parker reflected on the legal framework for managing COVID-19. He said that in his view, the PHRA served New Zealand well until the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in 2021.

In November 2021, Parker chaired the annual meeting of attorneys-general from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 2022, he progressed the New Zealand Bill of Rights (Declarations of Inconsistency) Amendment Bill, which required if Supreme Court finds a law to be inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act that the issue be returned to Parliament.

=== Environment portfolios ===
As environment minister, Parker oversaw a &quot;comprehensive overhaul&quot; of the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA). He appointed retired judge Tony Randerson, who had previously been on a review panel for the RMA before its enactment, to make recommendations about the future direction for resource management. Parker led the government&#x27;s development of new policy and two new laws: the Natural and Built Environment Bill and the Spatial Planning Bill. Both bills were introduced into parliament on 14 November 2022 and passed into law on 16 August 2023. Parker said his rationale for replacing the RMA was that it had become too complex and expensive, without adequately protecting water quality or decreasing carbon emissions. The legislation was repealed in January 2024 after a change of government.

Parker launched the government&#x27;s freshwater policy statement in September 2019, which aimed to improve water quality in lakes and rivers. A report Parker had commissioned the previous year had found significant water quality issues, including increases of nitrates and &quot;E. coli&quot;. By 2020, another report showed that water quality had not improved in nearly half of monitoring sites. Tighter water quality regulations, including controls on winter grazing of stock, were enacted in 2020 and these were soon described as &quot;onerous&quot; and &quot;unworkable&quot; by farming lobbyists. However, environmental advocates like Mike Joy said Parker&#x27;s regulations were insufficient at addressing nitrate pollution. Following the change of government in 2023, the winter grazing rules are expected to be repealed by the end of 2024.

As the first minister in the new oceans and fisheries portfolio, Parker launched the government&#x27;s sustainable oceans strategy in a pair of speeches to Forest &amp; Bird in June 2021 and Auckland University in June 2022. During two years in the portfolio, he launched a marine protected area in the Hauraki Gulf and reformed fisheries legislation. He passed the portfolio to Stuart Nash in February 2023, and held it briefly again after Nash&#x27;s dismissal from the executive in March 2023.

=== Economic portfolios ===
Parker was Minister for Economic Development from October 2017 to June 2019. In the 2019 budget, he announced a new $300 million venture capital fund, administered in a similar way as the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. Parker said the intention of the fund is to increase productivity and generate revenue to fund future superannuation. After leaving the economic development portfolio, Parker was continued as the responsible minister for the venture capital fund through his associate finance delegation. He said in 2023 that the fund had already generated $1 billion total market capital available for start-up companies. Parker&#x27;s finance delegation also included responsibility on behalf of the Minister of Finance for the Overseas Investment Act 2005. In August 2018, Parker led the passage of the Overseas Investment Amendment Act 2018, that banned the sale of existing residential property in New Zealand to foreign buyers.

As trade minister between 2017 and 2020, Parker&#x27;s trade strategy centered on defending the rules-based system for international trade led by the World Trade Organization and embedding New Zealand within Asia-Pacific free trade agreements. On 8 March 2018, he signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership on behalf of New Zealand. In October 2018, he led New Zealand&#x27;s ratification of the PACER Plus agreement. He also worked with Liz Truss, then the United Kingdom Secretary of State for International Trade, on the development of a United Kingdom–New Zealand free trade agreement. In 2019, Parker announced government support for Saudi Arabia &quot;agri-hub&quot; he had questioned, and described as a bribe, in Opposition had been cancelled. Parker&#x27;s final engagement as trade minister was a speech addressing global challenges to the OECD on 9 October 2020.

Parker became revenue minister in October 2020, having requested to hold the portfolio. He was responsible for legislating the government&#x27;s Budget 2022 &quot;cost of living&quot; payment scheme for low-income individuals, but faced criticism for the scheme&#x27;s poor implementation. Around the same time, he proposed adding goods and services tax to KiwiSaver account fees but the proposal was dropped due to widespread criticism. Parker said the proposal would have made the tax system more consistent, but opponents accused it of &quot;eating into&quot; retirement savings. &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; columnist Audrey Young said these incidents showed Parker&#x27;s difficulty at seeing political risk.

Parker also conducted work on tax inequality, which he said was his main priority in the portfolio and was inspired by reading Thomas Piketty&#x27;s &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot;. In April 2022, Parker gave a speech titled &quot;Shining a light on unfairness in our tax system,&quot; which set out his belief that New Zealand no longer has a progressive tax system. In the speech, he said: &quot;the effective marginal tax rate for middle income Kiwis is generally higher than it is for their wealthiest citizens. Indeed, some of their wealthier Kiwi compatriots pay very low rates of tax on most of their income.&quot; One year later, he released research from the Inland Revenue Department that found New Zealand&#x27;s wealthiest families pay less than half the amount of tax, across all forms of income, than most other New Zealanders. Parker said the &quot;internationally ground-breaking research&quot; revealed a &quot;large differential between the tax rates ordinary New Zealanders pay on their full income compared with the super-wealthy&quot;. Piketty responded to the report saying New Zealand should institute a wealth tax.

Following on from these findings, in May 2023, Parker introduced the Tax Principles Reporting Bill that proposes an ongoing reporting framework for fairness in the tax system. The relevant principles were horizontal equity, efficiency, vertical equity, revenue integrity, compliance and administrative costs, certainty and predictability, and flexibility and adaptability. The bill, which passed its third reading in August 2023, was described by National Party opponents as &quot;David Parker&#x27;s pet envy project.&quot; It was repealed under urgency by the incoming National government in December 2023, days before the first report was due to be published.

Parker resigned his role as revenue minister on 25 July 2023, describing remaining in the position as &quot;untenable,&quot; after prime minister Chris Hipkins said Labour would not introduce a wealth tax policy that Parker had spent several years developing. Parker also refused to say whether he thought Hipkins preferred tax policy (removing goods and services tax on fresh fruits and vegetables) was workable. His stance was criticised by &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;&#x27;s Claire Trevett as &quot;an ill-timed bout of personal principle that carries a whiff of petulance and selfishness&quot; that came in the lead-up to an election and amid several other resignations of Cabinet ministers for various scandals, but was praised by former revenue minister Peter Dunne as the correct decision and by journalist Simon Wilson for being a rare act of principle.

== Political views ==
Parker is a liberal. He has been described as an &quot;ardent progressive&quot; and once self-described himself as an &quot;agent of progressive change.&quot; Consistently through his career, he has described himself as an egalitarian politician. He voted in support of civil unions in 2004 (the Civil Union Bill) and gay marriage in 2013 (the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill). He voted against legalising voluntary euthanasia in 2003, but voted for the End of Life Choice Bill in 2019. In 2019, he stated a personal view that the sale of fireworks should be limited to only the days around Matariki rather than Guy Fawkes Night. He has also given his support to a four-year electoral cycle, rather than the current three-year parliamentary term, but prefers keeping the voting age and drinking age at 18.

In 2003, Parker supported a petition calling for the government to hold a royal commission of inquiry to review the case of Peter Ellis. A parliamentary committee reviewed the petition and rejected the petitioners&#x27; call for a commission of inquiry, concluding that it was not practical to hold such an inquiry. Ellis&#x27;s case was eventually heard by the Supreme Court which found in his favour; in 2021, &quot;North &amp; South&quot; argued that without Parker&#x27;s 2019 appointment of Sir Joseph Williams to the court it is unlikely the case would have been successful. In terms of the reach of the senior courts, Parker said that he is &quot;concerned when judicial activism goes too far and amounts to lawmaking, which should be left to Parliament.&quot; He co-authored the Labour Party policy, later the New Zealand Bill of Rights (Declarations of Inconsistency) Amendment Act 2022, which set out that when the Supreme Court finds a law to be inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act that the issue be returned to Parliament.

Parker is opposed to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and supports the creation and international recognition of a Palestinian state. He has been outspoken on these views since 2003. As Labour&#x27;s foreign affairs spokesperson in 2024, he wrote to foreign affairs minister Winston Peters requesting the government officially recognise Palestine, which Peters rejected, and opposed the government&#x27;s deployment of New Zealand soldiers into the Red Sea crisis.

French economist Thomas Piketty has been a strong influence on Parker&#x27;s economic views. In a speech following one by Piketty at the OECD in 2020, Parker said he became a Piketty &quot;disciple&quot; after reading &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot;. In 2023, Parker described &quot;Capital&quot; to &quot;The Spinoff&quot; as the book &quot;everyone should read&quot; because it demonstrated how wealth is being concentrated among very few individuals and that this has largely been missed because of a lack of sufficient, accurate data-based monitoring. Parker said of Piketty, &quot;he has written some of the most important economic analysis of the problems of the world in the last couple of decades.&quot;

==Personal life==
On 28 February 2022, Parker became the first New Zealand Member of Parliament to test positive for COVID-19. He broke his leg in late 2023 and was unable to travel to Parliament to be sworn in; instead the Clerk of the House traveled to Dunedin to administer Parker&#x27;s oath remotely.

<doc id="1075619" wikidata="Q6769198" url="?curid=1075619" title="Mark Peck">
<text>Mark Everett Peck (born 16 July 1953) is a New Zealand politician and a member of the Labour Party. From 2013 to 2016, he was a Wellington City Councillor, and was MP for Invercargill from 1993 to 2005.

==Early life and career==
Peck was born in 1953 in the town of Hamilton, Ohio, United States, and arrived in New Zealand in 1963. His father, Reverend Robert Logan Peck, was an Anglican priest, journalist and politician, and stimulated Mark&#x27;s interest in politics at an early age, leading him to seek positions in the Labour-influenced trade unions. In 1969 he became a New Zealand citizen. He was educated at Wellington College and then attended both University of Canterbury and Christchurch College of Education. He became President of the University of Canterbury Students&#x27; Association and from 1975 to 1976 he was General Secretary of the National Student Teachers&#x27; Association.

He worked several jobs prior to entering politics including as a part-time tutor, retailer, factory worker and supermarket department manager. In 1977 he became a union official with the Hospital and Hotel Workers&#x27; Union (later amalgamated into the Service Workers&#x27; Union. In 1985 he was appointed a member of the Southland Polytechnic Council. He was vice president (1991) and president (1992–93) of the Southland Council of Trade Unions.

==Political career==


In 1975 he joined the Labour Party and in 1977 he unsuccessfully stood for the Wellington City Council on the Labour ticket.

Peck won the National Party dominated electorate of Invercargill in the 1993 election. Soon after entering parliament he supported Helen Clark in her successful leadership challenge to Mike Moore. From 1996 to 1999 he was Shadow Minister of Revenue under Clark.

In 2002, he missed out getting promoted to cabinet and after that, he became more distant to his party colleagues and started feeling lonely. He represented the electorate until retiring from the House of Representatives twelve years later in September 2005; he claims that he made the decision to retire at his birthday in 2004.

During his hiatus from politics, he has been a director of the anti-smoking organisation &quot;Smokefree Coalition&quot;. In 2009 he opened a café &quot;Little Peckish&quot; in central Wellington with his wife Margaret. He retired and sold the café in 2021.

In the October 2013 local elections, Peck successfully ran for Wellington City Council in the Lambton ward. Peck voted for Wellington City Council to introduce a &#x27;living wage&#x27; for council employees. However he did not intend to apply a living wage to those he employs in his cafe. Peck retired at the local elections in October 2016.

==Personal life==
In early 2005, after crashing his car while drunk driving, Peck spoke publicly about his addiction to alcohol since he was a young man, and how he had checked himself into an addiction rehabilitation centre. He and his wife have three children.

<text>Patrick Magruder (1768 – December 24, 1819) was an American lawyer, politician, and librarian who served as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland’s 3rd congressional District from March 4, 1805, to March 3, 1807, and as the 2nd Librarian of the United States Congress, from December 26, 1807, to January 18, 1815.

==Biography==
Patrick Magruder was born on his family&#x27;s estate, &quot;Locust Grove&quot;, near Rockville in the Province of Maryland, in 1768, the son of Samuel Wade Magruder and Lucy Beall. Patrick Magruder was the great-grandson of Samuel Magruder, the son of Alexander Magruder. Patrick Magruder attended Princeton College and became a lawyer. In 1804, he was elected to be a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, and served from March 4, 1805, to March 3, 1807. After the death of John J. Beckley, President Thomas Jefferson appointed Magruder to the dual post of Clerk of the United States House of Representatives and Librarian of Congress. The posts were not separated until 1815. Magruder served as the 2nd Librarian of the United States Congress from December 26, 1807, to January 18, 1815. During the War of 1812, the British burned Washington, D.C., including the Library of Congress, which was then housed in the US Capitol Building. After an investigation by Congress into the destruction of the library and the use of its funds, Magruder resigned. He died December 24, 1819, in Petersburg, Virginia, and was buried on his family&#x27;s ancestral estate, &quot;Sweden&quot;, near Petersburg in Dinwiddie County, Virginia. Magruder, who first married Sarah Turner, and then Martha Goodwyn, had six children.

<text>Barbara Lynne Pillay (born 14 August 1950) is a New Zealand politician, and member of the Labour Party.

Pillay was born in Palmerston North. Before entering politics, she was a nurse, and had been active in the New Zealand Nurses Union.

== Member of Parliament ==

She was first elected to Parliament in the 2002 election, winning the Waitakere electorate. Her main rival was Alliance leader Laila Harré. Pillay had previously contested the safe National seat of Tamaki in the 1999 election, and had missed out on election as a list MP by only one place.

In 2006, Pillay&#x27;s Human Rights (Women in Armed Forces) Amendment Bill was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot. The bill removed the legislative ban on women serving in combat roles in the New Zealand Defence Force. The bill was subsequently adopted by the government before its third reading, and passed unanimously as the Human Rights (Women in Armed Forces) Amendment Act 2007.

In the 2008 general election Pillay was defeated by National candidate Paula Bennett, with a margin of 632 votes. Pillay was ranked 32 on the Labour Party list and was elected into the 49th parliament as a list MP.

On 3 December 2009 Pillay announced that she would retire at the 2011 election.

<text>Kerrisdale is a neighbourhood in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Kerrisdale is a neighbourhood located in Vancouver&#x27;s west side. It features a mix of newer houses and older bungalows as well as various low and mid-rise rental and condo apartment buildings in its northern section. The neighbourhood is a racial mix of European and East Asian Canadians. It features a shopping district running generally along West 41st Avenue between Larch and Maple Streets and West Boulevard between 37th and 49th Avenues. Although the city officially defines Kerrisdale as being south of 41st Ave (north of 41st is called Arbutus Ridge), the majority of the area&#x27;s residents consider the area&#x27;s boundaries to be West 33rd Avenue to the north, Granville Street to the east, West 57th Avenue to the south, and Blenheim Street to the west. The northern part of Marpole is also generally thought of as part of Kerrisdale, thus some refer to the area as Kerrisdale-Marpole. The southwestern part of Kerrisdale is known as Southlands, due to its location in relation to the city. Southlands is known for its horse stables and rural feel and is located on the floodplain of the North Arm of the Fraser River.

==History==
Kerrisdale gained its name in 1905 when British Columbia Electric Railway manager R.H. Sterling asked Mrs. William McKinnon to name the interurban stop at Wilson Road (today West 41st Avenue). She chose to call it &quot;Kerry&#x27;s Dale&quot;, after the name of her family home, Kerrydale, in Gairloch, Scotland. Kerrydale means &quot;little seat of the fairies&quot;. It was quickly corrupted to Kerrisdale. The area was part of the Municipality of Point Grey, which amalgamated January 1, 1929 with the City of Vancouver and the Municipality of South Vancouver. Many of the streets and avenues surrounding this focal intersection developed around this time, with local landmarks such as Point Grey Secondary School, Ryerson Church, Shannon Mews and the Allen Brown Estate constructed in these formative years.

==Demographics==

As of the 2016 community census, there were 13,975 people, 5,530 private households, and 3,930 families residing in Kerrisdale.

Although formerly British in character and demographics, Kerrisdale began to experience an influx of affluent immigrants from Hong Kong in the mid-1980s. This was partially due to the fears of Communist China taking over Hong Kong from the British in 1997 per the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Many of those Hong Kong immigrants constructed large, modern houses. Therefore, Kerrisdale is generally a mix of East Asian and Western architecture, with older bungalows in between new houses and renovated houses.

Kerrisdale has a mix of white-collar professionals, high net worth individuals, and university students renting basement suites or more inexpensive apartment blocks to attend nearby post-secondary institutions such as Langara College and the University of British Columbia. The area is also home to elderly residents who primarily rent in the low rise rental blocks that characterize the north central section of the community.

Projected average 2008 household income: $131,769 as compared with $75,854 and $79,798 for Vancouver and Metro Vancouver respectively.

==Services==

The stretch of businesses along W. 41st Ave between Balsam and Maple streets comprise the Kerrisdale Business Association, the longest running such association in Vancouver. Member businesses pool funds for festivities and general beautification of the area, including the hiring of a full-time gardener during summer months.

The Arbutus Corridor, a no-longer-used CPR railway line which bisects the neighbourhood, has been purchased by the City of Vancouver and will be a series of community gardens, as well as a greenway for bicycles and pedestrians. The railway line has been removed and the right of way has been converted into a greenway for pedestrians and cyclists.

Kerrisdale Community Centre is home to the Kerrisdale Branch of the Vancouver Public Library, and Kerrisdale Pool.

North of 41st Avenue on East Boulevard is the Kerrisdale Cyclone Taylor Arena, built in 1949 as a hockey arena and was used as wrestling venue for 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.

The Arbutus Greenway, a large path designed for bikers and pedestrians, runs North-South through the heart of Kerrisdale.

==Education==

Kerrisdale is home to Kerrisdale Elementary School, Kerrisdale Annex, Maple Grove Elementary School, Dr. R. E. McKechnie Elementary School, and Quilchena Elementary School, as well as Magee Secondary School, Prince of Wales Secondary School and Point Grey Secondary School.

Crofton House School, a private school for girls, is on the western edge of the neighbourhood, next to Dunbar-Southlands.

<text>Mita Michael Ririnui is a former New Zealand politician and a member of the Labour Party. He was a member of parliament from 1999 to 2011.

==Early years==
Ririnui was born in Tauranga. He obtained his education from Tauranga Boys&#x27; College, Bay of Plenty Polytechnic, University of Waikato and Massey University. Before entering politics, Ririnui worked for a number of notable Maori community organisations including Te Puni Kōkiri, and he is a registered minister of the Rātana church.

==Member of Parliament==


Ririnui was originally elected to Parliament as the MP for the Māori electorate of Waiariki, winning the 1999 election from Tuariki Delamere. He retained the seat in 2002. However, in the 2005 election, he lost his electorate seat to Te Ururoa Flavell of the Māori Party and remained in Parliament as a list MP.

At the beginning of his second term as an MP, Ririnui was appointed a Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the ministers responsible for Conservation, Corrections and Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations; in July 2004, his Conservation portfolio was replaced with Health. In December 2004 Ririnui instead became a Minister outside Cabinet, as a Minister of State with Associate Ministerial roles in the Corrections, Health, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, and Forestry portfolios, and held these roles until the defeat of the Labour government in 2008. He also chaired the Labour Party&#x27;s internal Maori Caucus.

Labour was defeated in the 2008 general election, meaning that Ririnui was unable to retain his ministerial positions. He was unsuccessful at regaining Waiariki, but his list placing of 23 ensured his return to Parliament on the Labour list.

On 14 June 2010, four days after the release of ministerial credit card records, Ririnui along with two other MPs Chris Carter and Shane Jones were demoted by Opposition Leader Phil Goff for misuse of such credit cards. In the case of Ririnui, he was accused of purchasing items such as golf clubs and a bike which violate the rules regarding the usage of ministerial credit cards. Ririnui reimbursed Ministerial Services at the time for the purchases. Ririnui&#x27;s demotion included the loss of the shadow portfolio of Forestry.

In February 2011, Ririnui announced that he would retire at the 2011 election.

<text>Dissent is an American Left intellectual magazine founded in 1954. It is published by the University of Pennsylvania Press on behalf of the Foundation for the Study of Independent Social Ideas and is currently edited by Natasha Lewis and Timothy Shenk. Former co-editors include Irving Howe, Mitchell Cohen, Michael Walzer, and David Marcus.

==History==
The magazine was established in 1954 by a group of New York Intellectuals, which included Lewis A. Coser, Rose Laub Coser, Irving Howe, Norman Mailer, Henry Pachter, and Meyer Schapiro. Its co-founder and publisher for its first 15 years was University Place Book Shop owner Walter Goldwater.

From its inception, &quot;Dissent&quot;″s politics deviated from the standard ideological positions of the left and right. Like &quot;Politics&quot;, the &quot;New Left Review&quot; and the French socialist magazine &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot;, &quot;Dissent&quot; sought to formulate a third position between the liberalism of the West and the communism of the East. Troubled by the rampant bureaucratization of both capitalist and communist society, &quot;Dissent&quot; was home to writers like C. Wright Mills and Paul Goodman, who identified themselves as radical democrats, as well as to editors who, like Irving Howe and Michael Harrington, more closely identified with democratic socialism. Over its seven decades in publication, it has also become an influential venue for social and cultural criticism, publishing political philosophers including Michael Walzer, Cornel West, and Iris Marion Young, as well as novelists and poets such as Günter Grass and Czesław Miłosz.

In the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;Dissent&quot;″s skepticism toward Third World revolutions and the culture of the New Left occasionally isolated it from student movements, but its commitment to both pluralist and egalitarian politics—in particular, when it came to social and civil rights issues—separated it from both the mainstream liberalism and the growing neoconservative movement. Although &quot;Dissent&quot; still identifies with the democratic socialism of its founders, including Lewis A. Coser and Rose Laub Coser, its editors and contributors represent a broad spectrum of left positions: from the Marxist humanism of Marshall Berman and Leszek Kołakowski, to the social democratic revisionism of Richard Rorty and Michael Walzer, and to the radical feminism of Ellen Willis and Seyla Benhabib. In the 2010s, several of its younger editors identified themselves with the heterodox Marxism and visions of radical democracy espoused by Occupy Wall Street.

Together with the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research, &quot;Dissent&quot; announced its Archive project. It will be digitizing several short-lived literary magazines, including &quot;Marxist Perspectives&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;, and providing access to them online. It also recently launched a labor podcast and introduced a new front of the book section dedicated to publishing cultural criticism.

<text>The brown-throated martin or brown-throated sand martin (Riparia paludicola) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family, Hirundinidae, that is widely distributed across Africa. It was formerly regarded as conspecific with the grey-throated martin (&quot;Riparia chinensis&quot;) and the Madagascar martin (&quot;Riparia cowani&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The brown-throated martin was formally described in 1817 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. He placed it in the genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Hirundo paludicola&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;paludicola&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;marsh-dweller&quot; (from &quot;palus&quot;, &quot;paludis&quot; meaning &quot;swamp&quot; and &quot;-cola&quot; meaning &quot;dweller&quot;. Vieillot based his account on &quot;L&#x27;hirondelle à front roux&quot; from South Africa that had been described and illustrated in 1806 by François Levaillant. The brown-throated martin is now one of six martins placed in the genus &quot;Riparia&quot; that was introduced in 1817 by the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster. It was formerly considered to be conspecific with the grey-throated martin (&quot;Riparia chinensis&quot;) and the Madagascar martin (&quot;Riparia cowani&quot;).

Six subspecies are recognised. They differ in size and plumage tones of the upperparts or underparts.

* &quot;R. p. mauritanica&quot; (Meade-Waldo, 1901) – west Morocco
* &quot;R. p. minor&quot; (Cabanis, 1851) – Senegal and Gambia to north Ethiopia
* &quot;R. p. schoensis&quot; Reichenow, 1920 – central Ethiopia
* &quot;R. p. newtoni&quot; Bannerman, 1937 – northeast Nigeria and west Cameroon
* &quot;R. p. ducis&quot; Reichenow, 1908 – east DRCongo, Uganda, Kenya and north, central Tanzania
* &quot;R. p. paludicola&quot; (Vieillot, 1817) – Angola to south Tanzania and south to South Africa

==Description==
The 12 cm long brown-throated martin is brown above and white or pale brown below. It lacks the narrow brown band on the breast shown by the sand martin; the bill is black and the legs are brown. Sexes are similar, but the young have pale tips to the feathers on the rump and wings.

The twittering song of the brown-throated martin is continuous when the birds are on the wing, and becomes a conversational undertone after they have settled in the roost. There is also a harsh alarm call.

==Distribution and habitat==
It has a wide range in Africa. It is a partially migratory species, with some populations making seasonal movements. It is usually associated closely with water as its specific epithet &quot;paludicola&quot; suggests.

==Behaviour==
Its brown back, small size and quicker, jerkier flight separate the brown-throated martin at once from most other members of the swallow family. It is most similar to the sand martin, &quot;Riparia riparia &quot;, which is its northern counterpart.

===Breeding===
The brown-throated martin is colonial in its nesting habits, with many pairs breeding close together, according to available space. The nests are at the end of tunnels of 30 to 60 cm in length, bored in sandbanks. The actual nest is a litter of straw and feathers in a chamber at the end of the burrow. Two to four white eggs are the normal clutch, and are incubated by both parents.

===Food and feeding===
The food of this species consists of small insects, mostly gnats and other flies whose early stages are aquatic.

<doc id="1075674" wikidata="Q1538864" url="?curid=1075674" title="Martin PBM Mariner">
<text>The Martin PBM Mariner is a twin-engine American patrol bomber flying boat of World War II and the early Cold War era. It was designed to complement the Consolidated PBY Catalina and PB2Y Coronado in service. A total of 1,366 PBMs were built, with the first example flying on 18 February 1939, and the type entering service in September 1940, with the last of the type being retired in 1964.

A Mariner, otherwise noted for its WW2 and post-War service, was the type that vanished searching for Flight 19. Flight 19 vanished in the Bermuda Triangle, it and the Mariner that searched for it were never found with its 14 crew, though it was thought to have suffered a mid-air explosion. Another noted crash was the 1946 Antarctica PBM Mariner crash in December 1946.

==Design and development==

In 1937 the Glenn L. Martin Company designed a new twin-engined flying boat, the Model 162, to succeed its earlier Martin P3M and complement the PBY Catalina and PB2Y Coronado. It received an order for a single prototype XPBM-1 on 30 June 1937. 

To test the PBM&#x27;s layout, Martin built a three-eighths scale flying model, the Martin 162A &quot;Tadpole Clipper&quot; with a crew of one and powered by a single Chevrolet engine driving two airscrews via v-belts; this was flown in December 1937. This was followed by an initial production order for 21 PBM-1 aircraft on 28 December 1937.
The first genuine PBM, the XPBM-1, flew on 18 February 1939.

The aircraft had multiple gun positions including single mounts at each midship beam and stern above the tail cone. Additional guns were positioned in the nose and dorsal turrets, each fitted with two-gun turrets. The bomb bays were in the engine nacelles. The gull wing was of cantilever design, and featured clean aerodynamics with an unbraced twin tail. The PBM-1 was equipped with retractable wing landing floats that were hinged outboard, with single-strut supported floats that retracted inwards to rest beneath the wing, with the floats&#x27; keels just outboard of each of the engine nacelles. The PBM-3 had fixed floats, and the fuselage was three feet longer than that of the PBM-1.
Martin also developed the even larger 4-engined Martin JRM Mars in this period.

==Operational history==


The first PBM-1s entered service with Patrol Squadron Fifty-Five (VP-55) of the United States Navy on 1 September 1940. Prior to the USA&#x27;s entry into World War II, PBMs were used (together with PBYs) to carry out Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic, including operations from Iceland. Following Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, PBMs were used on anti-submarine patrols, sinking their first German U-boat, &quot;U-158&quot;, on 30 June 1942. PBMs were responsible, wholly or in part, for sinking a total of ten U-boats during World War II. PBMs were also heavily used in the Pacific War, operating from bases at Saipan, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, and the South West Pacific.

The United States Coast Guard acquired 27 Martin PBM-3 aircraft during the first half of 1943. In late 1944, the service acquired 41 PBM-5 models and more were delivered in the latter half of 1945. Ten were still in service in 1955, although all were gone from the active Coast Guard inventory by 1958 (when the last example was released from CGAS San Diego and returned to the U.S. Navy). These flying boats became the backbone of the long-range aerial search and rescue efforts of the Coast Guard in the early post-war years until supplanted by the P5M Marlin and the HU-16 Albatross in the mid-1950s.

PBMs continued in service with the U.S. Navy following the end of World War II, flying long patrol missions during the Korean War. It continued in front line use until replaced by its successor, the P5M Marlin. The last Navy squadron equipped with the PBM, Patrol Squadron Fifty (VP-50), retired them in July 1956.

The British Royal Air Force acquired 32 Mariners, but they were not used operationally, with some returned to the United States Navy. A further 12 PBM-3Rs were transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force for transporting troops and cargo.

The Royal Netherlands Navy acquired 17 PBM-5A Mariners at the end of 1955 for service in Netherlands New Guinea. The PBM-5A was an amphibian with retractable landing gear. The engines were Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800-34. After a series of crashes, the Dutch withdrew their remaining aircraft from use in December 1959.

On 5 December 1945, a PBM Mariner took off from Eastern Florida to search for a missing Flight 19 (five TBM Avengers on a training flight), and was not heard from again. Twenty minutes after takeoff the airplane vanished from radar. A vessel in the area reported seeing a fireball and found an oil slick, but no remains of the crew or aircraft were found. The aircraft and crew remained missing but it is suspected it suffered from a mid-air explosion.

The 1946 Antarctica PBM Mariner crash occurred on 30 December 1946, on Thurston Island, Antarctica when a United States Navy Martin PBM-5 Mariner crashed during a blizzard. Buno 59098 was one of 4 aircraft lost during Operation Highjump.

One of its replacements in US service was the Martin P5M Marlin.

==Surviving aircraft==

*United States Navy PBM-5A (Bureau Number (BuNo) &quot;122071&quot;) is the only surviving Mariner. It is on loan from the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., and is currently on display at the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum adjacent to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. Operated by the USN between 1948 and 1956, it is painted in the markings of Transport Squadron 21 (VR-21) and coded &quot;RZ 051&quot; of the early 1950s.
*PBM-5 BuNo &quot;59172&quot; lies upside down under Lake Washington. It crashed on 6 May 1949, and after a number of unsuccessful attempts to recover the wreck over the following decades, it is now used as a training site for divers.
*The Model 162A (registered &quot;NX19168&quot;), the piloted three-eighths scale test aircraft, is on display at the Baltimore Museum of Industry.

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 11 November 1942 a U.S. Navy PBM-5 (BuNo 1256) Naval Air Station Banana River, Florida. In unknown circumstances, while flying in the vicinity of the Banana River NAS, the seaplane caught fire and crashed. All 11 occupants were killed.
*On 16 June 1944, a U.S. Navy PBM-5 exploded and crashed in San Francisco Bay, California, killing the pilot, Lieutenant William Hess, and eight other Navy crewmen.
*On 30 November 1944, a U.S. Navy PBM-5 crashed into Mount Tamalpais in northern California, killing eight naval aviators and naval aircrewmen. The aircraft had taken off from Naval Air Station Alameda and was part of a larger flight headed for Hawaii when it developed engine trouble shortly after takeoff.
*On 5 December 1945, United States Navy PBM-5 (BuNo 59225), based at Naval Air Station Banana River, Florida was believed to have been destroyed in a mid-air explosion off the coast of Florida near The Bahamas, while searching for the missing TBM Avengers of Flight 19 from Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
*On 30 December 1946, a U.S. Navy PBM-5 crashed on Thurston Island, Antarctica, while supporting Operation Highjump.
*On 10 September 1958, Mariner P-303 was being ferried to the Netherlands from Biak, Indonesia. Due to technical problems, a forced landing was carried out at Abadan, Iran. About two weeks later, repairs had been accomplished, and the aircraft took off. Shortly after takeoff, an oil leak was observed on engine number one. While on final approach for landing at Abadan airport, the aircraft suddenly lost height and crashed, killing all aboard. It appeared that the remaining propeller reversed thrust, causing the crew to lose control.
*On 9 November 1958, a PBM-5 Mariner (CS-THB, named &quot;Porto Santo&quot;) of the Portuguese airline ARTOP (Aero-Topográfica) piloted by Harry Frank Broadbent and co-piloted by Thomas Rowell, carrying four other crew and 30 passengers, disappeared on a scheduled passenger flight from Cabo Ruivo, Lisbon, Portugal to Funchal, Madeira. The last communication from the aircraft (when it was about 13°W) was a radio message code &quot;QUG&quot;, meaning &quot;I am forced to land immediately&quot;. No trace has ever been found of the aircraft, nor its six crew or 30 passengers.

<text>United States labor law sets the rights and duties for employees, labor unions, and employers in the US. Labor law&#x27;s basic aim is to remedy the &quot;inequality of bargaining power&quot; between employees and employers, especially employers &quot;organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association&quot;. Over the 20th century, federal law created minimum social and economic rights, and encouraged state laws to go beyond the minimum to favor employees. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires a federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 but higher in 29 states and D.C., and discourages working weeks over 40 hours through time-and-a-half overtime pay. There are no federal laws, and few state laws, requiring paid holidays or paid family leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 creates a limited right to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in larger employers. There is no automatic right to an occupational pension beyond federally guaranteed Social Security, but the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 requires standards of prudent management and good governance if employers agree to provide pensions, health plans or other benefits. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 requires employees have a safe system of work.

A contract of employment can always create better terms than statutory minimum rights. But to increase their bargaining power to get better terms, employees organize labor unions for collective bargaining. The Clayton Act of 1914 guarantees all people the right to organize, and the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 creates rights for most employees to organize without detriment through unfair labor practices. Under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, labor union governance follows democratic principles. If a majority of employees in a workplace support a union, employing entities have a duty to bargain in good faith. Unions can take collective action to defend their interests, including withdrawing their labor on strike. There are not yet general rights to directly participate in enterprise governance, but many employees and unions have experimented with securing influence through pension funds, and representation on corporate boards.

Since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, all employing entities and labor unions have a duty to treat employees equally, without discrimination based on &quot;race, color, religion, sex, or national origin&quot;. There are separate rules for sex discrimination in pay under the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Additional groups with &quot;protected status&quot; were added by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. There is no federal law banning all sexual orientation or identity discrimination, but 22 states had passed laws by 2016. These equality laws generally prevent discrimination in hiring and terms of employment, and make discharge because of a protected characteristic unlawful. In 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in &quot;Bostock v. Clayton County&quot; that discrimination solely on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There is no federal law against unjust discharge, and most states also have no law with full protection against wrongful termination of employment. Collective agreements made by labor unions and some individual contracts require that people are only discharged for a &quot;just cause&quot;. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 requires employing entities give 60 days notice if more than 50 or one third of the workforce may lose their jobs. Federal law has aimed to reach full employment through monetary policy and spending on infrastructure. Trade policy has attempted to put labor rights in international agreements, to ensure open markets in a global economy do not undermine fair and full employment.

==History==
Modern US labor law mostly comes from statutes passed between 1935 and 1974, and changing interpretations of the US Supreme Court. However, laws regulated the rights of people at work and employers from colonial times on. Before the Declaration of Independence in 1776, the common law was either uncertain or hostile to labor rights. Unions were classed as conspiracies, and potentially criminal. It tolerated slavery and indentured servitude. From the Pequot War in Connecticut from 1636 onwards, Native Americans were enslaved by European settlers. More than half of the European immigrants arrived as prisoners, or in indentured servitude, where they were not free to leave their employers until a debt bond had been repaid. Until its abolition, the Atlantic slave trade brought millions of Africans to do forced labor in the Americas. 

However, in 1772, the English Court of King&#x27;s Bench held in &quot;Somerset v Stewart&quot; that slavery was to be presumed unlawful at common law. Charles Stewart from Boston, Massachusetts had bought James Somerset as a slave and taken him to England. With the help of abolitionists, Somerset escaped and sued for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; (that &quot;holding his body&quot; had been unlawful). Lord Mansfield, after declaring he should &quot;let justice be done whatever be the consequence&quot;, held that slavery was &quot;so odious&quot; that nobody could take &quot;a slave by force to be sold&quot; for any &quot;reason whatever&quot;. This was a major grievance of southern slave owning states, leading up to the American Revolution in 1776. The 1790 United States census recorded 694,280 slaves (17.8 per cent) of a total 3,893,635 population. After independence, the British Empire halted the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, and abolished slavery in its own territories, by paying off slave owners in 1833. In the US, northern states progressively abolished slavery. However, southern states did not. In &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; the Supreme Court held the federal government could not regulate slavery, and also that people who were slaves had no legal rights in court. The American Civil War was the result. President Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 made abolition of slavery a war aim, and the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 enshrined the abolition of most forms of slavery in the Constitution. Former slave owners were further prevented from holding people in involuntary servitude for debt by the Peonage Act of 1867. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment ensured equal access to justice, and the Fifteenth Amendment required that everyone would have the right to vote. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 was also meant to ensure equality in access to housing and transport, but in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;, the Supreme Court found it was &quot;unconstitutional&quot;, ensuring that racial segregation would continue. In dissent, Harlan J said the majority was leaving people &quot;practically at the mercy of corporations&quot;. Even if people were formally free, they remained factually dependent on property owners for work, income and basic services.

Like slavery, common law repression of labor unions was slow to be undone. In 1806, &quot;Commonwealth v. Pullis&quot; held that a Philadelphia shoemakers union striking for higher wages was an illegal &quot;conspiracy&quot;, even though corporations—combinations of employers—were lawful. Unions still formed and acted. The first federation of unions, the National Trades Union was established in 1834 to achieve a 10 hour working day, but it did not survive the soaring unemployment from the financial Panic of 1837. In 1842, &quot;Commonwealth v. Hunt&quot;, held that &quot;Pullis&quot; was wrong, after the Boston Journeymen Bootmakers&#x27; Society struck for higher wages. The first instance judge said unions would &quot;render property insecure, and make it the spoil of the multitude, would annihilate property, and involve society in a common ruin&quot;. But in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Shaw CJ held people &quot;are free to work for whom they please, or not to work, if they so prefer&quot; and could &quot;agree together to exercise their own acknowledged rights, in such a manner as best to subserve their own interests.&quot; This stopped criminal cases, although civil cases persisted. In 1869 an organisation called the Knights of Labor was founded by Philadelphia artisans, joined by miners 1874, and urban tradesmen from 1879. It aimed for racial and gender equality, political education and cooperative enterprise, yet it supported the Alien Contract Labor Law of 1885 which suppressed workers migrating to the US under a contract of employment. 

Industrial conflicts on railroads and telegraphs from 1883 led to the foundation of the American Federation of Labor in 1886, with the simple aim of improving workers wages, housing and job security &quot;here and now&quot;. It also aimed to be the sole federation, to create a strong, unified labor movement. Business reacted with litigation. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was intended to sanction business cartels acting in restraint of trade, was applied to labor unions. In 1895, the US Supreme Court in &quot;In re Debs&quot; affirmed an injunction, based on the Sherman Act, against the striking workers of the Pullman Company. The strike leader Eugene Debs was put in prison. In notable dissent among the judiciary, Holmes J argued in &quot;Vegelahn v. Guntner&quot; that any union taking collective action in good faith was lawful: even if strikes caused economic loss, this was equally legitimate as economic loss from corporations competing with one another. Holmes J was elevated to the US Supreme Court, but was again in a minority on labor rights. In 1905, &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; held that New York limiting bakers&#x27; working day to 60 hours a week violated employers&#x27; freedom of contract. The Supreme Court majority supposedly unearthed this &quot;right&quot; in the Fourteenth Amendment, that no State should &quot;deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.&quot; With Harlan J, Holmes J dissented, arguing that the &quot;constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory&quot; but is &quot;made for people of fundamentally differing views&quot;. On questions of social and economic policy, courts should never declare legislation &quot;unconstitutional&quot;. The Supreme Court, however, accelerated its attack on labor in &quot;Loewe v. Lawlor&quot;, holding that triple damages were payable by a striking union to its employers under the Sherman Act of 1890. This line of cases was finally quashed by the Clayton Act of 1914 §6. This removed labor from antitrust law, affirming that the &quot;labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce&quot; and nothing &quot;in the antitrust laws&quot; would forbid the operation of labor organizations &quot;for the purposes of mutual help&quot;.
Throughout the early 20th century, states enacted labor rights to advance social and economic progress. But despite the Clayton Act, and abuses of employers documented by the &quot;Commission on Industrial Relations&quot; from 1915, the Supreme Court struck labor rights down as unconstitutional, leaving management powers virtually unaccountable. In this &quot;Lochner era&quot;, the Courts held that employers could force workers to not belong to labor unions, that a minimum wage for women and children was void, that states could not ban employment agencies charging fees for work, that workers could not strike in solidarity with colleagues of other firms, and even that the federal government could not ban child labor. It also imprisoned socialist activists, who opposed the fighting in World War I, meaning that Eugene Debs ran as the Socialist Party&#x27;s candidate for president in 1920 from prison. Critically, the courts held state and federal attempts to create Social Security to be unconstitutional. Because they were unable to save in safe public pensions, millions of people bought shares in corporations, causing massive growth in the stock market. Because the Supreme Court precluded regulation for good information on what people were buying, corporate promoters tricked people into paying more than stocks were really worth. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out millions of people&#x27;s savings. Business lost investment and fired millions of workers. Unemployed people had less to spend with businesses. Business fired more people. There was a downward spiral into the Great Depression. 

This led to the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt for president in 1932, who promised a &quot;New Deal&quot;. Government committed to create full employment and a system of social and economic rights enshrined in federal law. But despite the Democratic Party&#x27;s overwhelming electoral victory, the Supreme Court continued to strike down legislation, particularly the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, which regulated enterprise in an attempt to ensure fair wages and prevent unfair competition. Finally, after Roosevelt&#x27;s second overwhelming victory in 1936, and Roosevelt&#x27;s threat to create more judicial positions if his laws were not upheld, one Supreme Court judge switched positions. In &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot; the Supreme Court found that minimum wage legislation was constitutional, letting the New Deal go on. In labor law, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 guaranteed every employee the right to unionize, collectively bargain for fair wages, and take collective action, including in solidarity with employees of other firms. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 created the right to a minimum wage, and time-and-a-half overtime pay if employers asked people to work over 40 hours a week. The Social Security Act of 1935 gave everyone the right to a basic pension and to receive insurance if they were unemployed, while the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ensured buyers of securities on the stock market had good information. The Davis–Bacon Act of 1931 and Walsh–Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936 required that in federal government contracts, all employers would pay their workers fair wages, beyond the minimum, at prevailing local rates. To reach full employment and out of depression, the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 enabled the federal government to spend huge sums of money on building and creating jobs. This accelerated as World War II began. In 1944, his health waning, Roosevelt urged Congress to work towards a &quot;Second Bill of Rights&quot; through legislative action, because &quot;unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world&quot; and &quot;we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home.&quot;
Although the New Deal had created a minimum safety net of labor rights, and aimed to enable fair pay through collective bargaining, a Republican dominated Congress revolted when Roosevelt died. Against the veto of President Truman, the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947 limited the right of labor unions to take solidarity action, and enabled states to ban unions requiring all people in a workplace becoming union members. A series of Supreme Court decisions, held the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 not only created minimum standards, but stopped or &quot;preempted&quot; states enabling better union rights, even though there was no such provision in the statute. Labor unions became extensively regulated by the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. Post-war prosperity had raised people&#x27;s living standards, but most workers who had no union, or job security rights remained vulnerable to unemployment. As well as the crisis triggered by &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, and the need to dismantle segregation, job losses in agriculture, particularly among African Americans was a major reason for the civil rights movement, culminating in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom led by Martin Luther King Jr. Although Roosevelt&#x27;s Executive Order 8802 of 1941 had prohibited racial discrimination in the national defense industry, people still suffered discrimination because of their skin color across other workplaces. Also, despite the increasing numbers of women in work, sex discrimination was endemic. The government of John F. Kennedy introduced the Equal Pay Act of 1963, requiring equal pay for women and men. Lyndon B. Johnson introduced the Civil Rights Act of 1964, finally prohibiting discrimination against people for &quot;race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&quot; Slowly, a new generation of equal rights laws spread. At federal level, this included the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, now overseen by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Although people, in limited fields, could claim to be equally treated, the mechanisms for fair pay and treatment were dismantled after the 1970s. The last major labor law statute, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 created rights to well regulated occupational pensions, although only where an employer had already promised to provide one: this usually depended on collective bargaining by unions. But in 1976, the Supreme Court in &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot; held anyone could spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, as a part of the First Amendment right to &quot;freedom of speech&quot;. After the Republican President Reagan took office in 1981, he dismissed all air traffic control staff who went on strike, and replaced the National Labor Relations Board members with pro-management men. Dominated by Republican appointees, the Supreme Court suppressed labor rights, removing rights of professors, religious school teachers, or illegal immigrants to organize in a union, allowing employees to be searched at work, and eliminating employee rights to sue for medical malpractice in their own health care. Only limited statutory changes were made. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 criminalized large numbers of migrants. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 guaranteed workers some notice before a mass termination of their jobs. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 guaranteed a right to 12 weeks leave to take care for children after birth, all unpaid. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 cut the minimum wage, by enabling employers to take the tips of their staff to subsidize the minimum wage. A series of proposals by Democratic and independent politicians to advance labor rights were not enacted, and the United States began to fall behind most other developed countries in labor rights.

In relation to federal government contracting, Executive Order 13673, entitled &quot;Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces&quot;, was issued by President Barack Obama on 31 July 2014. It contained &quot;new requirements designed to increase efficiency and cost savings in the Federal contracting process&quot;, specifically referring to &quot;contracting with responsible sources who comply with labor laws&quot;. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration published guidance on 25 August 2016. The order listed 14 federal laws which were defined as &quot;labor laws&quot;, and extended coverage to &quot;equivalent state laws&quot;. A breach of any of these laws during the three year period preceding the contract award was treated as non-compliance; for a contract valued over $500,000, contracting officers were to consider such violations, and any corrective actions taken by the business concerned, in determining contract award. Similar provisions were built into sub-contracting arrangements. To support compliance, each federal agency was required to appoint a &quot;Labor Compliance Advisor&quot;. The order was revoked by President Donald Trump on 27 March 2017 under Executive Order 13782.

==Contract and rights at work==
Contracts between employees and employers (mostly corporations) usually begin an employment relationship, but are often not enough for a decent livelihood. Because individuals lack bargaining power, especially against wealthy corporations, labor law creates legal rights that override arbitrary market outcomes. Historically, the law faithfully enforced property rights and freedom of contract on any terms, whether or not this was inefficient, exploitative and unjust. In the early 20th century, as more people favored the introduction of democratically determined economic and social rights over rights of property and contract, state and federal governments introduced law reform. First, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 created a minimum wage (now $7.25 at federal level, higher in 28 states) and overtime pay of one and a half times. Second, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 creates very limited rights to take unpaid leave. In practice, good employment contracts improve on these minimums. Third, while there is no right to an occupational pension or other benefits, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ensures employers guarantee those benefits if they are promised. Fourth, the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1970 demands a safe system of work, backed by professional inspectors. Individual states are often empowered to go beyond the federal minimum, and function as laboratories of democracy in social and economic rights, where they have not been constrained by the US Supreme Court.

===Scope of protection===
Common law, state and federal statutes usually confer labor rights on &quot;employees&quot;, but not people who are autonomous and have sufficient bargaining power to be &quot;independent contractors&quot;. In 1994, the &quot;Dunlop Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations: Final Report&quot; recommended a unified definition of an employee under all federal labor laws, to reduce litigation, but this was not implemented. As it stands, Supreme Court cases have stated various general principles, which will apply according to the context and purpose of the statute in question. In &quot;NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc.&quot;, newsboys who sold newspapers in Los Angeles claimed that they were &quot;employees&quot;, so that they had a right to collectively bargain under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The newspaper corporations argued the newsboys were &quot;independent contractors&quot;, and they were under no duty to bargain in good faith. The Supreme Court held the newsboys were employees, and common law tests of employment, particularly the summary in the Restatement of the Law of Agency, Second §220, were no longer appropriate. They were not &quot;independent contractors&quot; because of the degree of control employers had. But the National Labor Relations Board could decide itself who was covered if it had &quot;a reasonable basis in law.&quot; Congress reacted, first, by explicitly amending the NLRA §2(1) so that independent contractors were exempt from the law while, second, disapproving that the common law was irrelevant. At the same time, the Supreme Court decided &quot;United States v. Silk&quot;, holding that &quot;economic reality&quot; must be taken into account when deciding who is an employee under the Social Security Act of 1935. This meant a group of coal loaders were employees, having regard to their economic position, including their lack of bargaining power, the degree of discretion and control, and the risk they assumed compared to the coal businesses they worked for. By contrast, the Supreme Court found truckers who owned their own trucks, and provided services to a carrier company, were independent contractors. Thus, it is now accepted that multiple factors of traditional common law tests may not be replaced if a statute gives no further definition of &quot;employee&quot; (as is usual, e.g., the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993). Alongside the purpose of labor legislation to mitigate inequality of bargaining power and redress the economic reality of a worker&#x27;s position, the multiple factors found in the Restatement of Agency must be considered, though none is necessarily decisive.
Common law agency tests of who is an &quot;employee&quot; take account of an employer&#x27;s control, if the employee is in a distinct business, degree of direction, skill, who supplies tools, length of employment, method of payment, the regular business of the employer, what the parties believe, and whether the employer has a business. Some statutes also make specific exclusions that reflect the common law, such as for independent contractors, and others make additional exceptions. In particular, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 §2(11) exempts supervisors with &quot;authority, in the interest of the employer&quot;, to exercise discretion over other employees&#x27; jobs and terms. This was originally a narrow exception. Controversially, in &quot;NLRB v. Yeshiva University&quot;, a 5 to 4 majority of the Supreme Court held that full time professors in a university were excluded from collective bargaining rights, on the theory that they exercised &quot;managerial&quot; discretion in academic matters. The dissenting judges pointed out that management was actually in the hands of university administration, not professors. In &quot;NLRB v. Kentucky River Community Care, Inc.&quot;, the Supreme Court held, again 5 to 4, that six registered nurses who exercised supervisory status over others fell into the &quot;professional&quot; exemption. Stevens J, for the dissent, argued that if &quot;the &#x27;supervisor&#x27; is construed too broadly&quot;, without regard to the Act&#x27;s purpose, protection &quot;is effectively nullified&quot;. Similarly, under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in &quot;Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.&quot;, the Supreme Court held 5 to 4 that a traveling medical salesman for GSK of four years was an &quot;outside salesman&quot;, and so could not claim overtime. People working unlawfully are often regarded as covered, so as not to encourage employers to exploit vulnerable employees. For instance in &quot;Lemmerman v. A.T. Williams Oil Co.&quot;, under the North Carolina Workers&#x27; Compensation Act an eight-year-old boy was protected as an employee, even though children working under the age of 8 was unlawful. However, in &quot;Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB&quot;, the Supreme Court held 5 to 4 that an undocumented worker could not claim back pay, after being discharged for organizing in a union. The gradual withdrawal of more and more people from the scope of labor law, by a slim majority of the Supreme Court since 1976, means that the US falls below international law standards, and standards in other democratic countries, on core labor rights, including freedom of association.
Common law tests were often important for determining who was, not just an employee, but the relevant employers who had &quot;vicarious liability&quot;. Potentially there can be multiple, joint-employers could who share responsibility, although responsibility in tort law can exist regardless of an employment relationship. In &quot;Ruiz v. Shell Oil Co&quot;, the Fifth Circuit held that it was relevant which employer had more control, whose work was being performed, whether there were agreements in place, who provided tools, had a right to discharge the employee, or had the obligation to pay. In &quot;Local 217, Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employees Union v. MHM Inc&quot; the question arose under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 whether a subsidiary or parent corporation was responsible to notify employees that the hotel would close. The Second Circuit held the subsidiary was the employer, although the trial court had found the parent responsible while noting the subsidiary would be the employer under the NLRA. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 USC §203(r), any &quot;enterprise&quot; that is under common control will count as the employing entity. Other statutes do not explicitly adopt this approach, although the NLRB has found an enterprise to be an employer if it has &quot;substantially identical management, business purpose, operation, equipment, customers and supervision.&quot; In &quot;South Prairie Const. Co. v. Local No. 627, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO&quot;, the Supreme Court found that the DC Circuit had legitimately identified two corporations as a single employer given that they had a &quot;very substantial qualitative degree of centralized control of labor&quot;, but that further determination of the relevant bargaining unit should have been remitted to the NLRB. When employees are hired through an agency, it is likely that the end-employer will be considered responsible for statutory rights in most cases, although the agency may be regarded as a joint employer.

===Contracts of employment===
When people start work, there will almost always be a contract of employment that governs the relationship of employee and the employing entity (usually a corporation, but occasionally a human being). A &quot;contract&quot; is an agreement enforceable in law. Very often it can be written down, or signed, but an oral agreement is also a fully enforceable contract. Because employees have unequal bargaining power compared to almost all employing entities, most employment contracts are &quot;standard form&quot;. Most terms and conditions are photocopied or reproduced for many people. Genuine negotiation is rare, unlike in commercial transactions between two business corporations. This has been the main justification for enactment of rights in federal and state law. The federal right to collective bargaining, by a labor union elected by its employees, is meant to reduce the inherently unequal bargaining power of individuals against organizations to make collective agreements. The federal right to a minimum wage, and increased overtime pay for working over 40 hours a week, was designed to ensure a &quot;minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers&quot;, even when a person could not get a high enough wage by individual bargaining. These and other rights, including family leave, rights against discrimination, or basic job security standards, were designed by the United States Congress and state legislatures to replace individual contract provisions. Statutory rights override even an express written term of a contract, usually unless the contract is more beneficial to an employee. Some federal statutes also envisage that state law rights can improve upon minimum rights. For example, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 entitles states and municipalities to set minimum wages beyond the federal minimum. By contrast, other statutes such as the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, have been interpreted in a series of contentious judgments by the US Supreme Court to &quot;preempt&quot; state law enactments. These interpretations have had the effect to &quot;stay experimentation in things social and economic&quot; and stop states wanting to &quot;serve as a laboratory&quot; by improving labor rights. Where minimum rights do not exist in federal or state statutes, principles of contract law, and potentially torts, will apply.
Aside from terms in oral or written agreements, terms can be incorporated by reference. Two main sources are collective agreements and company handbooks. In &quot;JI Case Co v. National Labor Relations Board&quot; an employing corporation argued it should not have to bargain in good faith with a labor union, and did not commit an unfair labor practice by refusing, because it had recently signed individual contracts with its employees. The US Supreme Court held unanimously that the &quot;very purpose&quot; of collective bargaining and the National Labor Relations Act 1935 was &quot;to supersede the terms of separate agreements of employees with terms which reflect the strength and bargaining power and serve the welfare of the group&quot;. Terms of collective agreements, to the advantage of individual employees, therefore supersede individual contracts. Similarly, if a written contract states that employees do not have rights, but an employee has been told they do by a supervisor, or rights are assured in a company handbook, they will usually have a claim. For example, in &quot;Torosyan v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&quot; the Supreme Court of Connecticut held that a promise in a handbook that an employee could be dismissed only for a good reason (or &quot;just cause&quot;) was binding on the employing corporation. Furthermore, an employer had no right to unilaterally change the terms. Most other state courts have reached the same conclusion, that contracts cannot be altered, except for employees&#x27; benefit, without new consideration and true agreement. By contrast, a slight majority on the California Supreme Court, appointed by Republican governors, held in &quot;Asmus v. Pacific Bell&quot; that a company policy of indefinite duration can be altered after a reasonable time with reasonable notice, if it affects no vested benefits. The four dissenting judges, appointed by Democratic governors, held this was a &quot;patently unfair, indeed unconscionable, result—permitting an employer that made a promise of continuing job security ... to repudiate that promise with impunity several years later&quot;. In addition, a basic term of good faith which cannot be waived, is implied by common law or equity in all states. This usually demands, as a general principle that &quot;neither party shall do anything, which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party, to receive the fruits of the contract&quot;. The term of good faith persists throughout the employment relationship. It has not yet been used extensively by state courts, compared to other jurisdictions. The Montana Supreme Court has recognized that extensive and even punitive damages could be available for breach of an employee&#x27;s reasonable expectations. However others, such as the California Supreme Court limit any recovery of damages to contract breaches, but not damages regarding the manner of termination. By contrast, in the United Kingdom the requirement for &quot;good faith&quot; has been found to limit the power of discharge except for fair reasons (but not to conflict with statute), in Canada it may limit unjust discharge also for self-employed persons, and in Germany it can preclude the payment of wages significantly below average.

Finally, it was traditionally thought that arbitration clauses could not displace any employment rights, and therefore limit access to justice in public courts. However, in &quot;14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett&quot;, in a 5 to 4 decision under the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925, individual employment contract arbitration clauses are to be enforced according to their terms. The four dissenting judges argued that this would eliminate rights in a way that the law never intended.

===Wages and pay===
While contracts often determine wages and terms of employment, the law refuses to enforce contracts that do not observe basic standards of fairness for employees. Today, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 aims to create a national minimum wage, and a voice at work, especially through collective bargaining should achieve fair wages. A growing body of law also regulates executive pay, although a system of &quot;maximum wage&quot; regulation, for instance by the former Stabilization Act of 1942, is not currently in force. Historically, the law actually suppressed wages, not of the highly paid, by ordinary workers. For example, in 1641 the Massachusetts Bay Colony legislature (dominated by property owners and the official church) required wage reductions, and said rising wages &quot;tende to the ruin of the Churches and the Commonwealth&quot;. In the early 20th century, democratic opinion demanded everyone had a minimum wage, and could bargain for fair wages beyond the minimum. But when states tried to introduce new laws, the US Supreme Court held them unconstitutional. A right to freedom of contract, argued a majority, could be construed from the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s protection against being deprived &quot;of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law&quot;. Dissenting judges argued that &quot;due process&quot; did not affect the legislative power to create social or economic rights, because employees &quot;are not upon a full level of equality of choice with their employer&quot;.
After the Wall Street Crash, and the New Deal with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the majority in the US Supreme Court was changed. In &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot; Hughes CJ held (over four dissenters still arguing for Freedom of Contract) that a Washington law setting minimum wages for women was constitutional because the state legislatures should be enabled to adopt legislation in the public interest. This ended the &quot;&quot;Lochner&quot; era&quot;, and Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Under §202(a) the federal minimum wage aims to ensure a &quot;standard of living necessary for health, efficiency and general well being&quot;. Under §207(a)(1), most employees (but with many exceptions) working over 40 hours a week must receive 50 per cent more overtime pay on their hourly wage. Nobody may pay lower than the minimum wage, but under §218(a) states and municipal governments may enact higher wages. This is frequently done to reflect local productivity and requirements for decent living in each region. However the federal minimum wage has no automatic mechanism to update with inflation. Because the Republican Party has opposed raising wages, the federal real minimum wage is over 33 per cent lower today than in 1968, among the lowest in the industrialized world.
Although there is a federal minimum wage, it has been restricted in (1) the scope of who it covers, (2) the time that counts to calculate the hourly minimum wage, and (3) the amount that employers&#x27; can take from their employees&#x27; tips or deduct for expenses. First, five US Supreme Court judges held in &quot;Alden v. Maine&quot; that the federal minimum wage cannot be enforced for employees of state governments, unless the state has consented, because that would violate the Eleventh Amendment. Souter J, joined by three dissenting justices, held that no such &quot;sovereign immunity&quot; existed in the Eleventh Amendment. Twenty-eight states, however, did have minimum wage laws higher than the federal level in 2016. Further, because the US Constitution, article one, section 8, clause 3 only allows the federal government to &quot;regulate Commerce ... among the several States&quot;, employees of any &quot;enterprise&quot; under $500,000 making goods or services that do not enter commerce are not covered: they must rely on state minimum wage laws. FLSA 1938 §203(s) explicitly exempts establishments whose only employees are close family members. Under §213 the minimum wage may not be paid to 18 categories of employee, and paying overtime to 30 categories of employee. This include under §213(a)(1) employees of &quot;&quot;bona fide&quot; executive, administrative, or professional capacity&quot;. In &quot;Auer v. Robbins&quot; police sergeants and lieutenants at the St Louis Police Department, Missouri claimed they should not be classed as executives or professional employees, and should get overtime pay. Scalia J held that, following Department of Labor guidance, the St Louis police commissioners were entitled to exempt them. This has encouraged employers to attempt to define staff as more &quot;senior&quot; and make them work longer hours while avoiding overtime pay. Another exemption in §213(a)(15) is for people &quot;employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services&quot;. In &quot;Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke&quot;, a corporation claimed exemption, although Breyer J for a unanimous court agreed with the Department of Labor that it was only intended for carers in private homes.

Second, because §206(a)(1)(C) says the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, courts have grappled with which hours count as &quot;working&quot;. Early cases established that time traveling to work did not count as work, unless it was controlled by, required by, and for the benefit of an employer, like traveling through a coal mine. For example, in, &quot;Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.&quot; a majority of five to two justices held that employees had to be paid for the long walk to work through an employer&#x27;s Mount Clemens Pottery Co facility. According to Murphy J this time, and time setting up workstations, involved &quot;exertion of a physical nature, controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the employer&#x27;s benefit.&quot; In &quot;Armour &amp; Co. v. Wantock&quot; firefighters claimed they should be fully paid while on call at their station for fires. The Supreme Court held that, even though the firefighters could sleep or play cards, because &quot;[r]eadiness to serve may be hired quite as much as service itself&quot; and time waiting on call was &quot;a benefit to the employer&quot;. By contrast, in 1992 the Sixth Circuit controversially held that needing to be infrequently available by phone or pager, where movement was not restricted, was not working time. Time spent doing unusual cleaning, for instance showering off toxic substances, does count as working time, and so does time putting on special protective gear. Under §207(e) pay for overtime should be one and a half times the regular pay. In &quot;Walling v. Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc.&quot;, the Supreme Court held that an employer&#x27;s scheme of paying lower wages in the morning, and higher wages in the afternoon, to argue that overtime only needed to be calculated on top of (lower) morning wages was unlawful. Overtime has to be calculated based on the average regular pay. However, in &quot;Christensen v. Harris County&quot; six Supreme Court judges held that police in Harris County, Texas, could be forced to use up their accumulated &quot;compensatory time&quot; (allowing time off with full pay) before claiming overtime. Writing for the dissent, Stevens J said the majority had misconstrued §207(o)(2), which requires an &quot;agreement&quot; between employers, unions or employees on the applicable rules, and the Texas police had not agreed. Third, §203(m) allows employers to deduct sums from wages for food or housing that is &quot;customarily furnished&quot; for employees. The secretary of labor may determine what counts as fair value. Most problematically, outside states that have banned the practice, they may deduct money from a &quot;tipped employee&quot; for money over the &quot;cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20, 1996&quot;—and this was $2.13 per hour. If an employee does not earn enough in tips, the employer must still pay the $7.25 minimum wage. But this means in many states tips do not go to workers: tips are taken by employers to subsidize low pay. Under FLSA 1938 §216(b)-(c) the secretary of state can enforce the law, or individuals can claim on their own behalf. Federal enforcement is rare, so most employees are successful if they are in a labor union. The Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1968 limits deductions or &quot;garnishments&quot; by employers to 25 per cent of wages, though many states are considerably more protective. Finally, under the Portal to Portal Act of 1947, where Congress limited the minimum wage laws in a range of ways, §254 puts a two-year time limit on enforcing claims, or three years if an employing entity is guilty of a willful violation.

===Working time and family care===

People in the United States work among the longest hours per week in the industrialized world, and have the least annual leave. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 article 24 states: &quot;Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay.&quot; However, there is no general federal or state legislation requiring paid annual leave. Title 5 of the United States Code §6103 specifies ten public holidays for federal government employees, and provides that holidays will be paid. Many states do the same, however, no state law requires private sector employers to provide paid holidays. Many private employers follow the norms of federal and state government, but the right to annual leave, if any, will depend upon collective agreements and individual employment contracts. State law proposals have been made to introduce paid annual leave. A 2014 Washington Bill from United States House of Representatives member Gael Tarleton would have required a minimum of 3 weeks of paid holidays each year to employees in businesses of over 20 staff, after 3 years work. Under the International Labour Organization Holidays with Pay Convention 1970 three weeks is the bare minimum. The bill did not receive enough votes. By contrast, employees in all European Union countries have the right to at least 4 weeks (i.e. 28 days) of paid annual leave each year. Furthermore, there is no federal or state law on limits to the length of the working week. Instead, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 §207 creates a financial disincentive to longer working hours. Under the heading &quot;Maximum hours&quot;, §207 states that time and a half pay must be given to employees working more than 40 hours in a week. It does not, however, set an actual limit, and there are at least 30 exceptions for categories of employee which do not receive overtime pay. Shorter working time was one of the labor movement&#x27;s original demands. From the first decades of the 20th century, collective bargaining produced the practice of having, and the word for, a two-day &quot;weekend&quot;. State legislation to limit working time was, however, suppressed by the US Supreme Court in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;. The New York State Legislature had passed the Bakeshop Act of 1895, which limited work in bakeries to 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week, to improve health, safety and people&#x27;s living conditions. After being prosecuted for making his staff work longer in his Utica, Mr Lochner claimed that the law violated the Fourteenth Amendment on &quot;due process&quot;. Despite the dissent of four judges, a majority of five judges held that the law was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, however, did uphold Utah&#x27;s mine workday statute in 1898. The Mississippi State Supreme Court upheld a ten hour workday statute in 1912 when it ruled against the due process arguments of an interstate lumber company. The whole &quot;Lochner&quot; era of jurisprudence was reversed by the US Supreme Court in 1937, but experimentation to improve working time rights, and &quot;work-life balance&quot; has not yet recovered.
Just as there are no rights to paid annual leave or maximum hours, there are no rights to paid time off for child care or family leave in federal law. There are minimal rights in some states. Most collective agreements, and many individual contracts, provide paid time off, but employees who lack bargaining power will often get none. There are, however, limited federal rights to unpaid leave for family and medical reasons. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks of the last year, and gives rights to employees who have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year. Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, to care for a close relative in poor health, or because of an employee&#x27;s own poor health. Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless agreed otherwise. Employees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is &quot;foreseeable&quot;, and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged &quot;so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer&quot; according to medical advice. Employers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave. Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide &quot;greater family or medical leave rights&quot;. In 2016 California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York had laws for paid family leave rights. Under §2612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for &quot;accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave&quot; in an employer&#x27;s personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the US Supreme Court in &quot;Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc.&quot; held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor&#x27;s job to enforce the law. After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to his or her job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal &quot;is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer.&quot; Employees or the secretary of labor can bring enforcement actions, but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost of child care, plus an equal amount of liquidated damages unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law. There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations. Despite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free child care or day care. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsize parents&#x27; costs.

===Pensions===
In the early 20th century, the possibility of having a &quot;retirement&quot; became real as people lived longer, and believed the elderly should not have to work or rely on charity until they died. The law maintains an income in retirement in three ways (1) through a public social security program created by the Social Security Act of 1935, (2) occupational pensions managed through the employment relationship, and (3) private pensions or life insurance that individuals buy themselves. At work, most occupational pension schemes originally resulted from collective bargaining during the 1920s and 1930s. Unions usually bargained for employers across a sector to pool funds, so that employees could keep their pensions if they moved jobs. Multi-employer retirement plans, set up by collective agreement became known as &quot;Taft–Hartley plans&quot; after the Taft–Hartley Act of 194] required joint management of funds by employees and employers. Many employers also voluntarily choose to provide pensions. For example, the pension for professors, now called TIAA, was established on the initiative of Andrew Carnegie in 1918 with the express requirement for participants to have voting rights for the plan trustees. These could be collective and defined benefit schemes: a percentage of one&#x27;s income (e.g. 67%) is replaced for retirement, however long the person lives. But more recently more employers have only provided individual &quot;401(k)&quot; plans. These are named after the Internal Revenue Code §401(k), which allows employers and employees to pay no tax on money that is saved in the fund, until an employee retires. The same tax deferral rule applies to all pensions. But unlike a &quot;defined benefit&quot; plan, a 401(k) only contains whatever the employer and employee contribute. It will run out if a person lives too long, meaning the retiree may only have minimum social security. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 §902 codified a model for employers to automatically enroll their employees in a pension, with a right to opt out. However, there is no right to an occupational pension. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 does create a series of rights for employees if one is set up. It also applies to health care or any other &quot;employee benefit&quot; plan.
Five main rights for beneficiaries in ERISA 1974 include information, funding, vesting, anti-discrimination, and fiduciary duties. First, each beneficiary should receive a &quot;summary plan description&quot; in 90 days of joining, plans must file annual reports with the secretary of labor, and if beneficiaries make claims any refusal must be justified with a &quot;full and fair review&quot;. If the &quot;summary plan description&quot; is more beneficial than the actual plan documents, because the pension fund makes a mistake, a beneficiary may enforce the terms of either. If an employer has pension or other plans, all employees must be entitled to participate after at longest 12 months, if working over 1000 hours. Second, all promises must be funded in advance. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was established by the federal government to be an insurer of last resort, but only up to $60,136 per year for each employer. Third, employees&#x27; benefits usually cannot be taken away (they &quot;vest&quot;) after 5 years, and contributions must accrue (i.e. the employee owns contributions) at a proportionate rate. If employers and pension funds merge, there can be no reduction in benefits, and if an employee goes bankrupt their creditors cannot take their occupational pension. However, the US Supreme Court has enabled benefits to be withdrawn by employers simply amending plans. In &quot;Lockheed Corp. v. Spink&quot; a majority of seven judges held that an employer could alter a plan, to deprive a 61-year-old man of full benefits when he was reemployed, unbound by fiduciary duties to preserve what an employee had originally been promised. In dissent, Breyer J and Souter J reserved any view on such &quot;highly technical, important matters&quot;. Steps to terminate a plan depend on whether it is individual, or multi-employer, and &quot;Mead Corp. v. Tilley&quot; a majority of the US Supreme Court held that employers could recoup excess benefits paid into pension plans after PBGC conditions are fulfilled. Stevens J, dissenting, contended that all contingent and future liabilities must be satisfied. Fourth, as a general principle, employees or beneficiaries cannot suffer any discrimination or detriment for &quot;the attainment of any right&quot; under a plan. Fifth, managers are bound by responsibilities of competence and loyalty, called &quot;fiduciary duties&quot;. Under §1102, a fiduciary is anyone who administers a plan, its trustees, and investment managers who are delegated control. Under §1104, fiduciaries must follow a &quot;prudent&quot; person standard, involving three main components. First, a fiduciary must act &quot;in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan&quot;. Second, they must act with &quot;care, skill and diligence&quot;, including &quot;diversifying the investments of the plan&quot; to &quot;minimize the risk of large losses&quot;. Liability for carelessness extends to making misleading statements about benefits, and have been interpreted by the Department of Labor to involve a duty to vote on proxies when corporate stocks are purchased, and publicizing a statement of investment policy. Third, and codifying fundamental equitable principles, a fiduciary must avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest. Fiduciaries must act &quot;solely in the interest of the participants ... for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits&quot; with &quot;reasonable expenses&quot;, and specifically avoiding self-dealing with a related &quot;party in interest&quot;. For example, in &quot;Donovan v. Bierwirth&quot;, the Second Circuit held that trustees of a pension which owned shares in the employees&#x27; company as a takeover bid was launched, because they faced a potential conflict of interest, had to get independent legal advice on how to vote, or possibly abstain. Remedies for these duties have, however, been restricted by the Supreme Court to disfavor damages. In these fields, according to §1144, ERISA 1974 will &quot;supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan&quot;. ERISA did not, therefore, follow the model of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 or the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which encourage states to legislate for improved protection for employees, beyond the minimum. The preemption rule led the US Supreme Court to strike down a New York that required giving benefits to pregnant employees in ERISA plans. It held a case under Texas law for damages for denying vesting of benefits was preempted, so the claimant only had ERISA remedies. It struck down a Washington law which altered who would receive life insurance designation on death. However, under §1144(b)(2)(A) this does not affect &#x27;any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.&#x27; So, the Supreme Court has also held valid a Massachusetts law requiring mental health to be covered by employer group health policies. But it struck down a Pennsylvania statute which prohibited employers becoming subrogated to (potentially more valuable) claims of employees for insurance after accidents. Yet more recently, the court has shown a greater willingness to prevent laws being preempted, however the courts have not yet adopted the principle that state law is not preempted or &quot;superseded&quot; if it is more protective to employees than a federal minimum.
The most important rights that ERISA 1974 did not cover were who controls investments and securities that beneficiaries&#x27; retirement savings buy. The largest form of retirement fund has become the 401(k). This is often an individual account that an employer sets up, and an investment management firm, such as Vanguard, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley or BlackRock, is then delegated the task of trading fund assets. Usually they also vote on corporate shares, assisted by a &quot;proxy advice&quot; firm such as ISS or Glass Lewis. Under ERISA 1974 §1102(a), a plan must merely have named fiduciaries who have &quot;authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan&quot;, selected by &quot;an employer or employee organization&quot; or both jointly. Usually these fiduciaries or trustees, will delegate management to a professional firm, particularly because under §1105(d), if they do so, they will not be liable for an investment manager&#x27;s breaches of duty. These investment managers buy a range of assets, particularly corporate stocks which have voting rights, as well as government bonds, corporate bonds, commodities, real estate or derivatives. Rights on those assets are in practice monopolized by investment managers, unless pension funds have organized to take voting in house, or to instruct their investment managers. Two main types of pension fund to do this are union organized Taft–Hartley plans, and state public pension plans. Under the amended National Labor Relations Act of 1935 §302(c)(5)(B) a union bargained plan has to be jointly managed by representatives of employers and employees. Although many local pension funds are not consolidated and have had critical funding notices from the Department of Labor, more funds with employee representation ensure that corporate voting rights are cast according to the preferences of their members. State public pensions are often larger, and have greater bargaining power to use on their members&#x27; behalf. State pension schemes invariably disclose the way trustees are selected. In 2005, on average more than a third of trustees were elected by employees or beneficiaries. For example, the California Government Code §20090 requires that its public employee pension fund, CalPERS has 13 members on its board, 6 elected by employees and beneficiaries. However, only pension funds of sufficient size have acted to replace investment manager voting. Furthermore, no general legislation requires voting rights for employees in pension funds, despite several proposals. For example, the Workplace Democracy Act of 1999, sponsored by Bernie Sanders then in the US House of Representatives, would have required all single employer pension plans to have trustees appointed equally by employers and employee representatives. There is, furthermore, currently no legislation to stop investment managers voting with other people&#x27;s money as the Dodd–Frank Act of 2010 §957 banned broker-dealers voting on significant issues without instructions. This means votes in the largest corporations that people&#x27;s retirement savings buy are overwhelmingly exercised by investment managers, whose interests potentially conflict with the interests of beneficiaries&#x27; on labor rights, fair pay, job security, or pension policy.

===Health and safety===

The Occupational Safety and Health Act, signed into law in 1970 by President Richard Nixon, creates specific standards for workplace safety. The act has spawned years of litigation by industry groups that have challenged the standards limiting the amount of permitted exposure to chemicals such as benzene. The Act also provides for protection for &quot;whistleblowers&quot; who complain to governmental authorities about unsafe conditions while allowing workers the right to refuse to work under unsafe conditions in certain circumstances. The act allows states to take over the administration of OSHA in their jurisdictions, so long as they adopt state laws at least as protective of workers&#x27; rights as under federal law. More than half of the states have done so.

==Workplace participation==
The central right in labor law, beyond minimum standards for pay, hours, pensions, safety or privacy, is to participate and vote in workplace governance. The American model developed from the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which declared the &quot;labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce&quot; and aimed to take workplace relations out of the reach of courts hostile to collective bargaining. Lacking success, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 changed the basic model, which remained through the 20th century. Reflecting the &quot;inequality of bargaining power between employees ... and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association&quot;, the NLRA 1935 codified basic rights of employees to organize a union, requires employers to bargain in good faith (at least on paper) after a union has majority support, binds employers to collective agreements, and protects the right to take collective action including a strike. Union membership, collective bargaining, and standards of living all increased rapidly until Congress forced through the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947. Its amendments enabled states to pass laws restricting agreements for all employees in a workplace to be unionized, prohibited collective action against associated employers, and introduced a list of unfair labor practices for unions, as well as employers. Since then, the US Supreme Court chose to develop a doctrine that the rules in the NLRA 1935 preempted any other state rules if an activity was &quot;arguably subject&quot; to its rights and duties. While states were inhibited from acting as &quot;laboratories of democracy&quot;, and particularly as unions were targeted from 1980 and membership fell, the NLRA 1935 has been criticized as a &quot;failed statute&quot; as US labor law &quot;ossified&quot;. This has led to more innovative experiments among states, progressive corporations and unions to create direct participation rights, including the right to vote for or codetermine directors of corporate boards, and elect work councils with binding rights on workplace issues.

===Labor unions===
Freedom of association in labor unions has always been fundamental to the development of democratic society, and is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. In early colonial history, labor unions were routinely suppressed by the government. Recorded instances include cart drivers being fined for striking in 1677 in New York City, and carpenters prosecuted as criminals for striking in Savannah, Georgia in 1746. After the American Revolution, however, courts departed from repressive elements of English common law. The first reported case, &quot;Commonwealth v. Pullis&quot; in 1806 did find shoemakers in Philadelphia guilty of &quot;a combination to raise their wages&quot;. Nevertheless, unions continued, and the first federation of trade unions was formed in 1834, the National Trades&#x27; Union, with the primary aim of a 10-hour working day. In 1842 the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held in &quot;Commonwealth v. Hunt&quot; that a strike by the Boston Journeymen Bootmakers&#x27; Society for higher wages was lawful. Chief Justice Shaw held that people &quot;are free to work for whom they please, or not to work, if they so prefer&quot; and &quot;to agree together to exercise their own acknowledged rights&quot;. The abolition of slavery by Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation during the American Civil War was necessary to create genuine rights to organize, but was not sufficient to ensure freedom of association. Using the Sherman Act of 1890, which was intended to break up business cartels, the Supreme Court imposed an injunction on striking workers of the Pullman Company, and imprisoned the leader, and future presidential candidate, Eugene Debs. The court also enabled unions to be sued for triple damages in &quot;Loewe v. Lawlor&quot;, a case involving a hat maker union in Danbury, Connecticut. The president and United States Congress responded by passing the Clayton Act of 1914 to take labor out of antitrust law. Then, after the Great Depression passed the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 to positively protect the right to organize and take collective action. After that, the law increasingly turned to regulate unions&#x27; internal affairs. The Taft–Hartley Act of 1947 regulated how members can join a union, and the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 created a &quot;bill of rights&quot; for union members.
While union governance is founded upon freedom of association, the law requires basic standards of democracy and accountability to ensure members are truly free in shaping their associations. Fundamentally, all unions are democratic organizations, but they divide between those where members elect delegates, who in turn choose the executive, and those where members directly elect the executive. In 1957, after the McClellan Committee of the US Senate found evidence of two rival Teamsters Union executives, Jimmy Hoffa and Dave Beck, falsifying delegate vote counts and stealing union funds, Congress passed the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. Under § 411, every member has the right to vote, attend meetings, speak freely and organize, not have fees raised without a vote, not be deprived of the right to sue, or be suspended unjustly. Under § 431, unions should file their constitutions and bylaws with the secretary of labor and be accessible by members: today union constitutions are online. Under § 481 elections must occur at least every 5 years, and local officers every 3 years, by secret ballot. Additionally, state law may bar union officials who have prior convictions for felonies from holding office. As a response to the Hoffa and Beck scandals, there is also an express fiduciary duty on union officers for members&#x27; money, limits on loans to executives, requirements for bonds for handling money, and up to a $10,000 fine or up to 5 years prison for embezzlement. These rules, however, restated most of what was already the law, and codified principles of governance that unions already undertook. On the other hand, under § 501(b) to bring a lawsuit, a union member must first make a demand on the executive to correct wrongdoing before any claim can be made to a court, even for misapplication of funds, and potentially wait four months&#x27; time. The Supreme Court has held that union members can intervene in enforcement proceedings brought by the US Department of Labor. Federal courts may review decisions by the Department to proceed with any prosecutions. The range of rights, and the level of enforcement has meant that labor unions display significantly higher standards of accountability, with fewer scandals, than corporations or financial institutions.
Beyond members rights within a labor union, the most controversial issue has been how people become members in unions. This affects union membership numbers, and whether labor rights are promoted or suppressed in democratic politics. Historically, unions made collective agreements with employers that all new workers would have to join the union. This was to prevent employers trying to dilute and divide union support, and ultimately refuse to improve wages and conditions in collective bargaining. However, after the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 § 158(a)(3) was amended to ban employers from refusing to hire a non-union employee. An employee can be required to join the union (if such a collective agreement is in place) after 30 days. But § 164(b) was added to codify a right of states to pass so called &quot;right to work laws&quot; that prohibit unions making collective agreements to register all workers as union members, or collect fees for the service of collective bargaining. Over time, as more states with Republican governments passed laws restricting union membership agreements, there has been a significant decline of union density. Unions have not, however, yet experimented with agreements to automatically enroll employees in unions with a right to opt out. In &quot;International Ass&#x27;n of Machinists v. Street&quot;, a majority of the US Supreme Court, against three dissenting justices, held that the First Amendment precluded making an employee become a union member against their will, but it would be lawful to collect fees to reflect the benefits from collective bargaining: fees could not be used for spending on political activities without the member&#x27;s consent. Unions have always been entitled to publicly campaign for members of Congress or presidential candidates that support labor rights. But the urgency of political spending was raised when in 1976 &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot; decided, over powerful dissents of White J and Marshall J, that candidates could spend unlimited money on their own political campaign, and then in &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot;, that corporations could engage in election spending. In 2010, over four dissenting justices, &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; held there could be essentially no limits to corporate spending. By contrast, every other democratic country caps spending (usually as well as regulating donations) as the original Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 had intended to do. A unanimous court held in &quot;Abood v. Detroit Board of Education&quot; that union security agreements to collect fees from non-members were also allowed in the public sector. However, in &quot;Harris v. Quinn&quot; five US Supreme Court judges reversed this ruling apparently banning public sector union security agreements, and were about to do the same for all unions in &quot;Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association&quot; until Scalia J died, halting an anti-labor majority on the Supreme Court. In 2018, &quot;Janus v. AFSCME&quot; the Supreme Court held by 5 to 4 that collecting mandatory union fees from public sector employees violated the First Amendment. The dissenting judges argued that union fees merely paid for benefits of collective bargaining that non-members otherwise received for free. These factors led campaign finance reform to be one of the most important issues in the 2016 US Presidential election, for the future of the labor movement, and democratic life.

===Collective bargaining===
Since the Industrial Revolution, collective bargaining has been the main way to get fair pay, improved conditions, and a voice at work. The need for positive rights to organize and bargain was gradually appreciated after the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914. Under §6, labor rights were declared to be outside of antitrust law, but this did not stop hostile employers and courts suppressing unions. In &quot;Adair v. United States&quot;, and &quot;Coppage v. Kansas&quot;, the Supreme Court, over powerful dissents, asserted the Constitution empowered employers to require employees to sign contracts promising they would not join a union. These &quot;yellow-dog contracts&quot; were offered to employees on a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; basis, and effectively stopped unionization. They lasted until the Great Depression when the Norris–La Guardia Act of 1932 banned them. This also prevented the courts from issuing any injunctions or enforcing any agreements in the context of a labor dispute. After the landslide election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 was drafted to create positive rights for collective bargaining in most of the private sector. It aimed to create a system of federal rights so that, under §157, employees would gain the legal &quot;right to self-organization&quot;, &quot;to bargain collectively&quot; and use &quot;concerted activities&quot; including strikes for &quot;mutual aid or other protection&quot;. The act was meant to increase bargaining power of employees to get better terms in than individual contracts with employing corporations. However §152 excluded many groups of workers, such as state and federal government employees, railway and airline staff, domestic and agriculture workers. These groups depend on special federal statutes like the Railway Labor Act or state law rules, like the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975. In 1979, five Supreme Court judges, over four forceful dissents, also introduced an exception for church operated schools, apparently because of &quot;serious First Amendment questions&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;independent contractors&quot; are excluded, even though many are economically dependent workers. Some courts have attempted to expand the &quot;independent contractor&quot; exception. In 2009, in &quot;FedEx Home Delivery v. NLRB&quot; the DC Circuit, adopting submissions of FedEx&#x27;s lawyer Ted Cruz, held that post truck drivers were independent contractors because they took on &quot;entrepreneurial opportunity&quot;. Garland J dissented, arguing the majority had departed from common law tests. The &quot;independent contractor&quot; category was estimated to remove protection from 8 million workers. While many states have higher rates, the US has an 11.1 per cent unionization rate and 12.3 per cent rate of coverage by collective agreement. This is the lowest in the industrialized world.
At any point employers can freely bargain with union representatives and make a collective agreement. Under NLRA 1935 §158(d) the mandatory subjects of collective bargaining include &quot;wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment&quot;. A collective agreement will typically aim to get rights including a fair day&#x27;s wage for a fair day&#x27;s work, reasonable notice and severance pay before any necessary layoffs, just cause for any job termination, and arbitration to resolve disputes. It could also extend to any subject by mutual agreement. A union can encourage an employing entity through collective action to sign a deal, without using the NLRA 1935 procedure. But, if an employing entity refuses to deal with a union, and a union wishes, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) may oversee a legal process up to the conclusion of a legally binding collective agreement. By law, the NLRB is meant to have five members &quot;appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate&quot;, and play a central role in promoting collective bargaining. First, the NLRB will determine an appropriate &quot;bargaining unit&quot; of employees with employers (e.g., offices in a city, or state, or whole economic sector), The NLRB favors &quot;enterprise bargaining&quot; over &quot;sectoral collective bargaining&quot;, which means US unions have traditionally been smaller with less bargaining power by international standards. Second, a union with &quot;majority&quot; support of employees in a bargaining unit becomes &quot;the exclusive representatives of all the employees&quot;. But to ascertain majority support, the NLRB supervises the fairness of elections among the workforce. It is typical for the NLRB to take six weeks from a petition from workers to an election being held. During this time, managers may attempt to persuade or coerce employees using high-pressure tactics or unfair labor practices (e.g. threatening job termination, alleging unions will bankrupt the firm) to vote against recognizing the union. The average time for the NLRB to decide upon complaints of unfair labor practices had grown to 483 days in 2009 when its last annual report was written. Third, if a union does win majority support in a bargaining unit election, the employing entity will have an &quot;obligation to bargain collectively&quot;. This means meeting union representatives &quot;at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms&quot; to put in a &quot;written contract&quot;. The NLRB cannot compel an employer to agree, but it was thought that the NLRB&#x27;s power to sanction an employer for an &quot;unfair labor practice&quot; if they did not bargain in good faith would be sufficient. For example, in &quot;JI Case Co v. National Labor Relations Board&quot; the Supreme Court held an employer could not refuse to bargain on the basis that individual contracts were already in place. Crucially, in &quot;Wallace Corp. v. NLRB&quot; the Supreme Court also held that an employer only bargaining with a company union, which it dominated, was an unfair labor practice. The employer should have recognized the truly independent union affiliated to the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). However, in &quot;NLRB v. Sands Manufacturing Co.&quot; the Supreme Court held an employer did not commit an unfair trade practice by shutting down a water heater plant, while the union was attempting to prevent new employees being paid less. Moreover, after 2007 President George W. Bush and the Senate refused to make any appointments to the Board, and it was held by five judges, over four dissents, in &quot;New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB&quot; that rules made by two remaining members were ineffective. While appointments were made in 2013, agreement was not reached on one vacant seat. Increasingly it has been made politically unfeasible for the NLRB to act to promote collective bargaining.
Once collective agreements have been signed, they are legally enforceable, often through arbitration, and ultimately in federal court. Federal law must be applied for national uniformity, so state courts must apply federal law when asked to deal with collective agreements or the dispute can be removed to federal court. Usually, collective agreements include provisions for sending grievances of employees or disputes to binding arbitration, governed by the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925. For example, in &quot;United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co&quot; a group of employees at a steel transportation works in Chickasaw, Alabama, requested the corporation go to arbitration over layoffs and outsourcing of 19 staff on lower pay to do the same jobs. The United Steelworkers had a collective agreement which contained a provision for arbitration. Douglas J held that any doubts about whether the agreement allowed the issue to go to arbitration &quot;should be resolved in favor of coverage.&quot; An arbitrator&#x27;s award is entitled to judicial enforcement so long as its essence is from the collective agreement. Courts can decline to enforce an agreement based on public policy, but this is different from &quot;general considerations of supposed public interests&quot;. But while federal policy had encouraged arbitration where unions and employers had made agreements, the Supreme Court drew a clear distinction for arbitration over individual statutory rights. In &quot;Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.&quot; an employee claimed he was unjustly terminated, and suffered unlawful race discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court held that he was entitled to pursue remedies both through arbitration and the public courts, which could re-evaluate the claim whatever the arbitrator had decided. But then, in 2009 in &quot;14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett&quot; Thomas J announced with four other judges that apparently &quot;[n]othing in the law suggests a distinction between the status of arbitration agreements signed by an individual employee and those agreed to by a union representative.&quot; This meant that a group of employees were denied the right to go to a public court under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and instead potentially be heard only by arbitrators their employer selected. Stevens J and Souter J, joined by Ginsburg J, Breyer J dissented, pointing out that rights cannot be waived even by collective bargaining. An Arbitration Fairness Act of 2011 has been proposed to reverse this, urging that &quot;employees have little or no meaningful choice whether to submit their claims to arbitration&quot;. It remains unclear why NLRA 1935 §1, recognizing workers&#x27; &quot;inequality of bargaining power&quot; was not considered relevant to ensure that collective bargaining can only improve upon rights, rather than take them away. To address further perceived defects of the NLRA 1935 and the Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretations, major proposed reforms have included the Labor Reform Act of 1977, the Workplace Democracy Act of 1999, and the Employee Free Choice Act of 2009. All focus on speeding the election procedure for union recognition, speeding hearings for unfair labor practices, and improving remedies within the existing structure of labor relations.

===Right to organize===
To ensure that employees are effectively able to bargain for a collective agreement, the NLRA 1935 created a group of rights in §158 to stall &quot;unfair labor practices&quot; by employers. These were considerably amended by the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, where the US Congress over the veto of President Harry S. Truman decided to add a list of unfair labor practices for labor unions. This has meant that union organizing in the US may involve substantial levels of litigation which most workers cannot afford. The fundamental principle of freedom of association, however, is recognized worldwide to require various rights. It extends to the state, so in &quot;Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization&quot; held the New Jersey mayor violated the First Amendment when trying to shut down CIO meetings because he thought they were &quot;communist&quot;. Among many rights and duties relating to unfair labor practices, five main groups of case have emerged.
First, under §158(a)(3)–(4) a person who joins a union must suffer no discrimination or retaliation in their chances for being hired, terms of their work, or in termination. For example, in one of the first cases, &quot;NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp&quot;, the US Supreme Court held that the National Labor Relations Board was entitled to order workers be rehired after they had been dismissed for organizing a union at their plant in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. It is also unlawful for employers to monitor employees who are organizing, for instance by parking outside a union meeting, or videotaping employees giving out union fliers. This can include giving people incentives or bribes to not join a union. So in &quot;NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp&quot; the Supreme Court held it was unlawful to give 20 years extra seniority to employees who crossed a picket line while the union had called a strike. Second, and by contrast, the Supreme Court had decided in &quot;Textile Workers Union of America v. Darlington Manufacturing Co Inc&quot; that actually shutting down a recently unionized division of an enterprise was lawful, unless it was proven that the employer was motivated by hostility to the union. Third, union members need the right to be represented, in order to carry out basic functions of collective bargaining and settle grievances or disciplinary hearings with management. This entails a duty of fair representation. In &quot;NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc.&quot; the Supreme Court held that an employee in a unionized workplace had the right to a union representative present in a management interview, if it could result in disciplinary action. Although the NLRB has changed its position with different political appointees, the DC Circuit has held the same right goes that non-union workers were equally entitled to be accompanied. Fourth, under §158(a)(5) it is an unfair labor practice to refuse to bargain in good faith, and out of this a right has developed for a union to receive information necessary to perform collective bargaining work. However, in &quot;Detroit Edison Co v. NLRB&quot; the Supreme Court divided 5 to 4 on whether a union was entitled to receive individual testing scores from a program the employer used. Also, in &quot;Lechmere, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board&quot; the Supreme Court held 6 to 3 that an employer was entitled to prevent union members, who were not employees, from entering the company parking lot to hand out leaflets. Fifth, there are a large group of cases concerning &quot;unfair&quot; practices of labor organizations, listed in §158(b). For example, in &quot;Pattern Makers League of North America v. NLRB&quot; an employer claimed a union had committed an unfair practice by attempting to enforce fines against employees who had been members, but quit during a strike when their membership agreement promised they would not. Five judges to four dissents held that such fines could not be enforced against people who were no longer union members.
The US Supreme Court policy of preemption, developed from 1953, means that states cannot legislate where the NLRA 1935 does operate. The NLRA 1935 contains no clause requiring preemption as is found, for example, in the Fair Labor Standards Act 1938 §218(a) where deviations from the minimum wage or maximum hours are preempted, unless they are more beneficial to the employee. The first major case, &quot;Garner v. Teamsters Local 776&quot;, decided a Pennsylvania statute was preempted from providing superior remedies or processing claims quicker than the NLRB because &quot;the Board was vested with power to entertain petitioners&#x27; grievance, to issue its own complaint&quot; and apparent &quot;Congress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtain uniform application of its substantive rules&quot;. In &quot;San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon&quot;, the Supreme Court held that the California Supreme Court was not entitled to award remedies against a union for picketing, because if &quot;an activity is arguably subject to §7 or §8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board&quot;. This was true, even though the NLRB had not given any ruling on the dispute because its monetary value was too small. This reasoning was extended in &quot;Lodge 76, International Association of Machinists v Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission&quot;, where a Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission sought to hold a union liable for an unfair labor practice, by refusing to work overtime. Brennan J held that such matters were to be left to &quot;be controlled by the free play of economic forces&quot;. While some of these judgments appeared beneficial to unions against hostile state courts or bodies, supportive actions also began to be held preempted. In &quot;Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles&quot; a majority of the Supreme Court held that Los Angeles was not entitled to refuse to renew a taxi company&#x27;s franchise license because the Teamsters Union had pressured it not to until a dispute was resolved. Most recently in &quot;Chamber of Commerce v. Brown&quot; seven judges on the Supreme Court held that California was preempted from passing a law prohibiting any recipient of state funds either from using money to promote or deter union organizing efforts. Breyer J and Ginsburg J dissented because the law was simply neutral to the bargaining process. State governments may, however, use their funds to procure corporations to do work that are union or labor friendly.

===Collective action===

The right of labor to take collective action, including the right to strike, has been fundamental to common law, federal law, and international law for over a century. As New York teacher unions argued in the 1960s, &quot;If you can&#x27;t call a strike you don&#x27;t have real collective bargaining, you have &#x27;collective begging.&#x27;&quot; During the 19th century, many courts upheld the right to strike, but others issued injunctions to frustrate strikes, and when the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was passed to prohibit business combinations in restraint of trade, it was first used against labor unions. This resulted in Eugene Debs, American Railway Union leader and future Socialist Presidential candidate, being imprisoned for taking part in the Pullman Strike. The Supreme Court persisted in &quot;Loewe v. Lawlor&quot; in imposing damages for strikes under antitrust law, until Congress passed the Clayton Act of 1914. Seen as &quot;the Magna Carta of America&#x27;s workers&quot;, this proclaimed that all collective action by workers was outside antitrust law under the Commerce Clause, because &quot;labor is not a commodity or article of commerce&quot;. It became fundamental that no antitrust sanctions could be imposed, if &quot;a union acts in its self-interest and does not combine with non-labor groups.&quot; The same principles entered the founding documents of the International Labour Organization in 1919. Finally at the end of the &quot;Lochner era&quot; the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 §157 enshrined the right &quot;to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection&quot; and in §163, the &quot;right to strike&quot;.
Although federal law guarantees the right to strike, American labor unions face the most severe constraints in the developed world in taking collective action. First, the law constrains the purposes for which strikes are allowed. The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 only covers &quot;employees&quot; in the private sector, and a variety of state laws attempt to suppress government workers&#x27; right to strike, including for teachers, police and firefighters, without adequate alternatives to set fair wages. Workers have the right to take protected concerted activity. But &quot;NLRB v. Insurance Agents&#x27; International Union&quot; held that although employees refusing to perform part of their jobs in a &quot;partial strike&quot; was not a failure to act in good faith, they could be potentially be discharged: perversely, this encourages workers to conduct an all-out strike instead. Second, since 1947 the law made it an &quot;unfair labor practice&quot; for employees to take collective action that is not a &quot;primary strike or primary picketing&quot; against the contractual employer. This prohibition on solidarity action includes a ban on employees of a subsidiary corporation striking in concert with employees of a parent corporation, employees striking with employees of competitors, against outsourced businesses, or against suppliers. However the same standards are not applied to employers: in &quot;NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449&quot;, the Supreme Court held that a group of seven employers were entitled to lock out workers of a union at once, in response to a strike at just one of the employers by the union. This said, employees may peacefully persuade customers to boycott any employer or related employer, for instance by giving out handbills. Third, a union is bound to act in good faith if it has negotiated a collective agreement, unless an employer commits an unfair labor practice. The union must also give 60 days warning before undertaking any strike while a collective agreement is in force. An employer must also act in good faith, and an allegation of a violation must be based on &quot;substantial evidence&quot;: declining to reply to the National Labor Relations Board&#x27;s attempts to mediate was held to be insubstantial.
The fourth constraint, and most significant, on the right to strike is the lack of protection from unjust discharge. Other countries protect employees from any detriment or discharge for strike action, but the Supreme Court held in &quot;NLRB v. Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Co.&quot; that employees on strike could be replaced by strikebreakers, and it was not an unfair labor practice for the employer to refuse to discharge the strikebreakers after the dispute was over. This decision is widely condemned as a violation of international law. However the Supreme Court further held in &quot;NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp.&quot; that the Labor Board cannot order an employer to rehire striking workers, and has even held that employers could induce younger employees more senior jobs as a reward for breaking a strike. Fifth, the Supreme Court has not consistently upheld the right to free speech and peaceful picketing. In &quot;NLRB v. Electrical Workers&quot; the Supreme Court held that an employer could discharge employees who disparaged an employer&#x27;s TV broadcasts while a labor dispute was running, on the pretext that the employees&#x27; speech had no connection to the dispute. On the other hand, the Supreme Court has held there was a right to picket shops that refused to hire African-American workers. The Supreme Court declared an Alabama law, which fined and imprisoned a picketer, to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court held unions could write newspaper publications to advocate for pro-labor political candidates. It also held a union could distribute political leaflets in non-work areas of the employer&#x27;s property. In all of these rights, however, the remedies available to employees for unfair labor practices are minimal, because employees can still be locked out and the board cannot order reinstatement in the course of a good faith labor dispute. For this reason, a majority of labor law experts support the laws on collective bargaining and collective action being rewritten from a clean slate.

===Right to vote at work===

While collective bargaining was stalled by US Supreme Court preemption policy, a dysfunctional National Labor Relations Board, and falling union membership rate since the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, employees have demanded direct voting rights at work: for corporate boards of directors, and in work councils that bind management. This has become an important complement to both strengthening collective bargaining, and securing the votes in labor&#x27;s capital on pension boards, which buy and vote on corporate stocks, and control employers. Labor law has increasingly converged with corporate law, and in 2018 the first federal law, the Reward Work Act was proposed by three US senators to enable employees to vote for one third of the directors on boards of listed companies. In 1919, under the Republican governor Calvin Coolidge, Massachusetts became the first state with a right for employees in manufacturing companies to have employee representatives on the board of directors, but only if corporate stockholders voluntarily agreed. Also in 1919 both Procter &amp; Gamble and the General Ice Delivery Company of Detroit had employee representation on boards. Board representation for employees spread through the 1920s, many without requiring any employee stock ownership plan. In the early 20th century, labor law theory split between those who advocated collective bargaining backed by strike action, those who advocated a greater role for binding arbitration, and proponents of codetermination as &quot;industrial democracy&quot;. Today, these methods are seen as complements, not alternatives. A majority of countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have laws requiring direct participation rights. In 1994, the &quot;Dunlop Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations: Final Report&quot; examined law reform to improve collective labor relations, and suggested minor amendments to encourage worker involvement. Congressional division prevented federal reform, but labor unions and state legislatures have experimented.
Corporations are chartered under state law, the larger mostly in Delaware, but leave investors free to organize voting rights and board representation as they choose. Because of unequal bargaining power, but also because of historic caution among American labor unions about taking on management, shareholders have come to monopolize voting rights in American corporations. From the 1970s employees and unions sought representation on company boards. This could happen through collective agreements, as it historically occurred in Germany or other countries, or through employees demanding further representation through employee stock ownership plans, but they aimed for voice independent from capital risks that could not be diversified. By 1980, workers had attempted to secure board representation at corporations including United Airlines, the General Tire and Rubber Company, and the Providence and Worcester Railroad. However, in 1974 the Securities and Exchange Commission, run by appointees of Richard Nixon, had rejected that employees who held shares in AT&amp;T were entitled to make shareholder proposals to include employee representatives on the board of directors. This position was eventually reversed expressly by the Dodd–Frank Act of 2010 §971, which subject to rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission entitles shareholders to put forward nominations for the board. Instead of pursuing board seats through shareholder resolutions the United Auto Workers, for example, successfully sought board representation by collective agreement at Chrysler in 1980. The United Steel Workers secured board representation in five corporations in 1993. Some representation plans were linked to employee stock ownership plans, and were open to abuse. At the energy company, Enron, workers were encouraged by management to invest an average of 62.5 per cent of their retirement savings from 401(k) plans in Enron stock against basic principles of prudent, diversified investment, and had no board representation. When Enron collapsed in 2003, employees lost a majority of their pension savings. For this reason, employees and unions have sought representation because they invest their labor in the firm, and do not want undiversifiable capital risk. Empirical research suggests by 1999 there were at least 35 major employee representation plans with worker directors, though often linked to corporate stock.
As well as representation on a corporation&#x27;s board of directors, or top management, employees have sought binding rights (for instance, over working time, break arrangement, and layoffs) in their organizations through elected work councils. After the National War Labor Board was established by the Woodrow Wilson administration, firms established work councils with some rights throughout the 1920s. Frequently, however, management refused to concede the &quot;right to employ and discharge, the direction of the working forces, and the management of the business&quot; in any way, which from the workforce perspective defeated the object. As the US presidency changed to the Republican party during the 1920s, work &quot;councils&quot; were often instituted by employers that did not have free elections or proceedings, to forestall independent labor unions&#x27; right to collective bargaining. For this reason, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 §158(a)(2) ensured it was an unfair labor practice for an employer &quot;to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization, or contribute financial or other support to it&quot;. This was designed to enable free work councils, genuinely independent from management, but not dominated work councils or so called &quot;company unions&quot;. For example, a work council law was passed by the US government in Allied-occupied Germany called Control Council Law, No 22. This empowered German workers to organize work councils if elected by democratic methods, with secret ballots, using participation of free labor unions, with basic functions ranging from how to apply collective agreements, regulating health and safety, rules for engagements, dismissals and grievances, proposals for improving work methods, and organizing social and welfare facilities. These rules were subsequently updated and adopted in German law, although American employees themselves did not yet develop a practice of bargaining for work councils, nor did states implement work council rules, even though neither were preempted by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. In 1992, the National Labor Relations Board in its &quot;Electromation, Inc&quot;, and &quot;EI du Pont de Nemours&quot;, decisions confirmed that while management dominated councils were unlawful, genuine and independent work councils would not be. The Dunlop Report in 1994 produced an inconclusive discussion that favored experimentation with work councils. A Republican Congress did propose a Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1995 to repeal §158(a)(2), but this was vetoed by President Bill Clinton as it would have enabled management dominated unions and councils. In 2014, workers at the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, sought to establish a work council. This was initially supported by management, but its stance changed in 2016, after the United Auto Workers succeeded in winning a ballot for traditional representation in an exclusive bargaining unit. As it stands, employees have no widespread right to vote in American workplaces, which has increased the gap between political democracy and traditional labor law goals of workplace and economic democracy.

==Equality and discrimination==
Since the US Declaration of Independence in 1776 proclaimed that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, the Constitution was progressively amended, and legislation was written, to spread equal rights to all people. While the right to vote was needed for true political participation, the &quot;right to work&quot; and &quot;free choice of employment&quot; came to be seen as necessary for &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot;. After state laws experimented, President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Executive Order 8802 in 1941 set up the Fair Employment Practice Committee to ban discrimination by &quot;race, creed, color or national origin&quot; in the defense industry. The first comprehensive statutes were the Equal Pay Act of 1963, to limit discrimination by employers between men and women, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to stop discrimination based on &quot;race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&quot; In the following years, more &quot;protected characteristics&quot; were added by state and federal acts. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 protects people over age 40. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requires &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; to include people with disabilities in the workforce. Twenty two state Acts protect people based on sexual orientation in public and private employment, but proposed federal laws have been blocked by Republican opposition. There can be no detriment to union members, or people who have served in the military. In principle, states may require rights and remedies for employees that go beyond the federal minimum. Federal law has multiple exceptions, but generally requires no disparate treatment by employing entities, no disparate impact of formally neutral measures, and enables employers to voluntarily take affirmative action favoring under-represented people in their workforce. The law has not, however, succeeded in eliminating the disparities in income by race, health, age or socio-economic background.

===Constitutional rights===
The right to equality in employment in the United States comes from at least six major statutes, and limited jurisprudence of the US Supreme Court, leaving the law inconsistent and full of exceptions. Originally, the US Constitution entrenched gender, race and wealth inequality by enabling states to maintain slavery, reserve the vote to white, property owning men, and enabling employers to refuse employment to anyone. After the Emancipation Proclamation in the American Civil War, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments attempted to enshrined equal civil rights for everyone, while the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and 1875 spelled out that everyone had the right to make contracts, hold property and access accommodation, transport and entertainment without discrimination. However, in 1883 the US Supreme Court in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; put an end to development by declaring that Congress was not allowed to regulate the actions of private individuals rather than public bodies. In his dissent, Harlan J would have held that no &quot;corporation or individual wielding power under state authority for the public benefit&quot; was entitled to &quot;discriminate against freemen or citizens, in their civil rights&quot;.
By 1944, the position had changed. In &quot;Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railway Co.&quot;, a Supreme Court majority held a labor union had a duty of fair representation and may not discriminate against members based on race under the Railway Labor Act of 1926 (or the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. Murphy J would have also based the duty on a right to equality in the Fifth Amendment). Subsequently, &quot;Johnson v. Railway Express Agency&quot; admitted that the old Enforcement Act of 1870 provided a remedy against private parties. However, the Courts have not yet accepted a general right of equality, regardless of public or private power. Legislation will usually be found unconstitutional, under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment if discrimination is shown to be intentional, or if it irrationally discriminates against one group. For example, in &quot;Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur&quot; the Supreme Court held by a majority of 5 to 2, that a school&#x27;s requirement for women teachers to take mandatory maternity leave was unconstitutional, against the Due Process Clause, because it could not plausibly be shown that after child birth women could never perform a job. But while the US Supreme Court has failed, against dissent, to recognize a constitutional principle of equality, federal and state legislation contains the stronger rules. In principle, federal equality law always enables state law to create better rights and remedies for employees.

===Equal treatment===
Today legislation bans discrimination, that is unrelated to an employee&#x27;s ability to do a job, based on sex, race, ethnicity, national origin, age and disability. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 banned gender pay discrimination, amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Plaintiffs must show an employing entity pays them less than someone of the opposite sex in an &quot;establishment&quot; for work of &quot;equal skill, effort, or responsibility&quot; under &quot;similar working conditions&quot;. Employing entities may raise a defense that pay differences result from a seniority or merit system unrelated to sex. For example, in &quot;Corning Glass Works v. Brennan&quot; the Supreme Court held that although women plaintiffs worked at different times in the day, compared to male colleagues, the working conditions were &quot;sufficiently similar&quot; and the claim was allowed. One drawback is the equal pay provisions are subject to multiple exemptions for groups of employees found in the FLSA 1938 itself. Another is that equal pay rules only operate within workers of an &quot;enterprise&quot;, so that it has no effect upon high paying enterprises being more male dominated, nor child care being unequally shared between men and women that affects long-term career progression. Sex discrimination includes discrimination based on pregnancy, and is prohibited in general by the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Beyond gender equality on the specific issue of pay, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is the general anti-discrimination statute. Titles I to VI protects the equal right to vote, to access public accommodations, public services, schools, it strengthens the Civil Rights Commission, and requires equality in federally funded agencies. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans discrimination in employment. Under §2000e-2, employers must not refuse to hire, discharge or discriminate &quot;against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual&#x27;s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&quot; Segregation in employment is equally unlawful. The same basic rules apply for people over 40 years old, and for people with disabilities. Although states may go further, a significant limit to federal law is a duty only falls on private employers of more than 15 staff, or 20 staff for age discrimination. Within these limits, people can bring claims against disparate treatment. In &quot;Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine&quot; the US Supreme Court held plaintiffs will establish a &quot;prima facie&quot; case of discrimination for not being hired if they are in a protected group, qualified for a job, but the job is given to someone of a different group. It is then up to an employer to rebut the case, by showing a legitimate reason for not hiring the plaintiff. However, in 1993, this position was altered in &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s Honor Center v. Hicks&quot; where Scalia J held (over the dissent of four justices) that if an employer shows no discriminatory intent, an employee must not only show the reason is a pretext, but show additional evidence that discrimination has taken place. Souter J in dissent, pointed out the majority&#x27;s approach was &quot;inexplicable in forgiving employers who present false evidence in court&quot;.

Disparate treatment can be justified under CRA 1964 §2000e-2(e) if an employer shows selecting someone reflects by &quot;religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.&quot; Race is not included. For example, in &quot;Dothard v. Rawlinson&quot; the state of Alabama prohibited women from working as prison guards in &quot;contact&quot; jobs, with close proximity to prisoners. It also had minimum height and weight requirements (5&quot;2 and 120 lbs), which it argued were necessary for proper security. Ms Rawlinson claimed both requirements were unlawful discrimination. A majority of 6 to 3 held that the gender restrictions in contact jobs were a bona fide occupational qualification, because there was a heightened risk of sexual assault, although Stewart J suggested the result might have differed if the prisons were better run. A majority held the height and weight restrictions, while neutral, had a disparate impact on women and were not justified by business necessity. By contrast, in &quot;Wilson v. Southwest Airlines Co.&quot;, a Texas District Court held an airline was not entitled to require women only to work as cabin attendants (who were further required to be &quot;dressed in high boots and hot-pants&quot;) even if it could show a consumer preference. The essence of the business was transporting passengers, rather than its advertising metaphor of &quot;spreading love all over Texas&quot;, so that there was no &quot;bona fide occupational requirement&quot;. Under the ADEA 1967, age requirements can be used, but only if reasonably necessary, or compelled by law or circumstance. For example, in &quot;Western Air Lines, Inc v. Criswell&quot; the Supreme Court held that airlines could require pilots to retire at age 60, because the Federal Aviation Administration required this. It could not, however, refuse to employ flight engineers over 60 because there was no comparable FAA rule.

In addition to prohibitions on discriminatory treatment, harassment, and detriment in retaliation for asserting rights, is prohibited. In a particularly obscene case, &quot;Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson&quot; the Supreme Court unanimously held that a bank manager who coerced a woman employee into having sex with him 40 to 50 times, including rape on multiple occasions, had committed unlawful harassment within the meaning of 42 USC §2000e. But also if employees or managers create a &quot;hostile or offensive working environment&quot;, this counts as discrimination. In &quot;Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.&quot; the Court held that a &quot;hostile environment&quot; did not have to &quot;seriously affect employees&#x27; psychological well-being&quot; to be unlawful. If the environment &quot;would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive&quot; this is enough. Standard principles of agency and vicariously liability apply, so an employer is responsible for the actions of its agents, But according to &quot;Faragher v. City of Boca Raton&quot; an employing entity can avoid vicarious liability if it shows it (a) exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassment and (b) a plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of opportunities to stop it. In addition, an employing entity may not retaliate against an employee for asserting his or her rights under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. In &quot;University of Pennsylvania v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&quot;, the Supreme Court held that a university was not entitled to refuse to give up peer review assessment documents in order for the EEOC to investigate the claim. Furthermore, in &quot;Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.&quot; the Supreme Court held that writing a negative job reference, after a plaintiff brought a race discrimination claim, was unlawful retaliation: employees were protected even if they had been fired. It has also been held that simply being reassigned to a slightly different job, operating forklifts, after making a sex discrimination complaint could amount to unlawful retaliation. This is all seen as necessary to make equal rights effective.

===Equal impact and remedies===
In addition to disparate treatment, employing entities may not use practices having an unjustified disparate impact on protected groups. In &quot;Griggs v. Duke Power Co.&quot;, a power company on the Dan River, North Carolina, required a high school diploma for staff to transfer to higher paying non-manual jobs. Because of racial segregation in states like North Carolina, fewer black employees than white employees had diplomas. The court found a diploma was wholly unnecessary to perform the tasks in higher paying non-manual jobs. Burger CJ, for a unanimous Supreme Court, held the &quot;Act proscribes not only overt discrimination, but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.&quot; An employer could show that a practice with disparate impact followed &quot;business necessity&quot; that was &quot;related to job performance&quot; but otherwise such practices would be prohibited. It is not necessary to show any intention to discriminate, just a discriminatory effect. Since amendments by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, if disparate impact is shown the law requires employers &quot;to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity&quot; and that any non-discriminatory &quot;alternative employment practice&quot; is not feasible. On the other hand, in &quot;Ricci v. DeStefano&quot; five Supreme Court judges held the City of New Haven had acted unlawfully by discarding test results for firefighters, which it concluded could have had an unjustified disparate impact by race. In a further concurrence, Scalia J said &quot;resolution of this dispute merely postpones the evil day&quot; when a disparate impact might be found unconstitutional, against the Equal 
Protection Clause because, in his view, the lack of a good faith defense meant employers were compelled to do &quot;racial decision making&quot; that &quot;is ... discriminatory.&quot; In dissent, Ginsburg J pointed out that disparate impact theory advances equality, and in no way requires behavior that is not geared to identifying people with skills necessary for jobs.
Both disparate treatment and disparate impact claims may be brought by an individual, or if there is a &quot;pattern or practice&quot; by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the attorney general, and by class action. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 a class of people who share a common claim must be numerous, have &quot;questions of law or fact common to the class&quot;, have representatives typical of the claimants, who would &quot;fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class&quot;. Class actions may be brought, even in favor of people who are not already identified, for instance, if they have been discouraged from applying for jobs, so long as there is sufficiently specific presentation of issues of law and fact to certify the action.

A significant practical problem for disparate impact claims is the &quot;Bennett Amendment&quot; in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 §703(h). Though introduced as a supposedly &quot;technical&quot; amendment by a Utah Republican senator, it requires that claims for equal pay between men and women cannot be brought unless they fulfill the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 § 206(d)(1). This says that employers have a defense to employee claims if unequal pay (purely based on gender) flows from &quot;(i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex.&quot; By contrast, for claims alleging discriminatory pay on grounds of race, age, sexual orientation or other protected characteristics, an employer only has the more restricted defenses available in the CRA 1964 §703(h). In &quot;County of Washington v. Gunther&quot; the majority of the Supreme Court accepted that this was the correct definition. In principle, this meant that a group of women prison guards, who did less time working with prisoners than men guards, and also did different clerical work, would be able to bring a claim—there was no need to be doing entirely &quot;equal work&quot;. However Rehnquist J dissented, arguing the Amendment should have put the plaintiffs in an even worse position: they should be required to prove they do &quot;equal work&quot;, as is stated in the first part of §703(h). Nevertheless, the majority held that the gender pay provisions could be worse because, for example, an employer could apply &quot;&quot;a bona fide job rating system,&quot; so long as it does not discriminate on the basis of sex&quot;, whereas the same would not be possible for other claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Given that a significant gender pay gap remains, it is not clear why any discrepancy or less favorable treatment, should remain at all.

==Job security==
Job security laws in the United States are the weakest in the developed world, as there are no federal statutory rights yet. Any employment contract can require job security, but employees other than corporate executives or managers rarely have the bargaining power to contract for job security. Collective agreements often aim to ensure that employees can only be terminated for a &quot;just cause&quot;, but the vast majority of Americans have no protection other than the rules at common law. Most states follow a rule that an employee can be terminated &quot;at will&quot; by the employer: for a &quot;good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all&quot;, so long as no statutory rule is violated. Most states have public policy exceptions to ensure that an employee&#x27;s discharge does not frustrate the purpose of statutory rights. Although the Lloyd–La Follette Act of 1912 required that federal civil servants cannot be dismissed except for a &quot;just cause&quot;, no federal or state law (outside Montana) protects all employees yet. There are now a growing number of proposals to do this. There are no rights to be given reasonable notice before termination, apart from whatever is stated in a contract or collective agreement, and no requirements for severance pay if an employer lays off employees for economic reasons. The only exception is that the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 requires 60 days notice is given if a business with over 100 employees lays off over 33% of its workforce or over 500 people. While a minority of theorists defend at will employment on the ground that it protects liberty and economic efficiency, the empirical evidence suggests that job insecurity hampers innovation, reduces productivity, worsens economic recessions, deprives employees of liberty and pay, and creates a culture of fear. US unemployment has historically been extremely volatile, as Republican presidents have consistently increased post-war unemployment, while Democratic presidents have reduced it. In its conduct of monetary policy, it is the duty of the Federal Reserve to achieve &quot;maximum employment&quot;, although in reality Federal Reserve chairs prioritize the reducing of inflation. Underemployment from growing insecurity of working hours has risen. Government may also use fiscal policy (by taxing or borrowing and spending) to achieve full employment, but as unemployment affects the power of workers, and wages, this remains highly political.

===Termination and cause===
The reasons or &quot;causes&quot; that an employer can give to terminate employment affect everything from people&#x27;s income, to the ability to pay the rent, to getting health insurance. Despite this, the legal right to have one&#x27;s job terminated only for a &quot;just cause&quot; is confined to just three groups of people. First, in the Lloyd–La Follette Act of 1912 Congress codified executive orders giving federal civil servants the right to have their jobs terminated &quot;only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.&quot; Second, in the mid 20th century, courts in New York developed a rule that corporate directors could only be dismissed for a &quot;just cause&quot;, requiring reasons related to the director&#x27;s conduct, competence, or some economic justification. Third, since 1987, Montana has enacted a &quot;wrongful discharge&quot; law, giving employees the right to damages if &quot;discharge was not for good cause and the employee had completed the employer&#x27;s probationary period of employment&quot;, with a standard probation set at 6 months work. However a right to reasons before termination has never been extended to ordinary employees outside Montana. By contrast, almost all other developed countries have legislation requiring just cause in termination. The standard in the International Labour Organization Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 requires a &quot;valid reason&quot; for termination of a worker contract based on &quot;capacity or conduct&quot; and prohibits reasons related to union membership, being a worker representative, or a protected characteristic (e.g. race, gender, etc.). It also requires reasonable notice, a fair procedure, and a severance allowance if the termination is for economic reasons. Some countries such as Germany also require that elected work councils have the power to veto or delay terminations, to neutralize the employer&#x27;s potential conflicts of interest. Most countries treat job security as a fundamental right, as well as necessary to prevent irrational job losses, to reduce unemployment, and to promote innovation. An alternative view is that making it easier to fire people encourages employers to hire more people because they will not fear the costs of litigation, although the empirical credibility of this argument is doubted by a majority of scholars.
Because most states have not yet enacted proposals for job security rights, the default rule is known as &quot;at-will employment&quot;. For example, in 1872, the California Civil Code was written to say &quot;employment having no specified term may be terminated at the will of either party&quot;, and even employment for a specified term could be terminated by the employer for a wilful breach, neglect of duty or the employee&#x27;s incapacity. In the late 19th century, employment at will was popularized by academic writers as an inflexible legal presumption, and state courts began to adopt it, even though many had presumed that contract termination usually required notice and justifications. By the mid-20th century this was summed up to say that an employee&#x27;s job could be terminated for a &quot;good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all&quot;. However, the employer&#x27;s discretion to terminate could not violate any statutory prohibition, including termination for union membership, discriminatory termination based on a protected characteristic (e.g. race, gender, age or disability), and bringing claims for occupational health and safety, fair labor standards, retirement income, family and medical leave, and under a series of other specific Acts. Many state courts also added at least four &quot;public policy&quot; exceptions, to ensure that the purpose of statutes in general would not be frustrated by firing. First, employees will be wrongfully discharged if are discharged after they refused to act unlawfully, for instance for refusing to perjure themselves in court. Second, employees cannot be terminated if they insist on performing public duties such as serving on a jury or responding to a subpoena even if this affects an employer&#x27;s business. Third, an employee cannot be discharged for exercising any statutory right, such as refusing to take a lie detector test or filing litigation. Fourth, employees will be wrongfully discharged if they legitimately blow the whistle on unlawful employer conduct, such as violating food labelling laws, or reporting unlawful standards in a nursing home. However none of these exceptions limit the central problem of terminations by an employer that are unrelated to an employee&#x27;s conduct, capability, or business efficiency. Some states interpret the general duty of good faith in contracts to cover discharges, so that an employee cannot, for example, be terminated just before a bonus is due to be paid. However the vast majority of Americans remain unprotected against most arbitrary, irrational or malicious conduct by employers.

Despite the default, and absence of job security rights in statute, a contract may require reasons before dismissal as a matter of construction. When there is a &quot;just cause&quot; term in a contract, courts generally interpret this to enable termination for an employee&#x27;s inadequate job performance after fair warning, and job-related misconduct where the employer consistently enforces a rule, but not actions outside of the job. An employee&#x27;s job may be constructively and wrongfully terminated if an employer&#x27;s behavior objectively shows it no longer wishes to be bound by the contract, for instance by unfairly depriving an employee of responsibility. If a written contract does not promise &quot;just cause&quot; protection against termination, statements in a handbook can still be enforceable, and oral agreements can override the written contract.

===Economic layoffs===
Many job terminations in America are economic layoffs, where employers believe that employees are redundant. In most countries, economic layoffs are separately regulated because of the conflicts of interest between workers, management and shareholders, and the risk that workers are discharged to boost profits even if this damages the long-term sustainability of enterprise. The ILO Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 requires a severance allowance if the termination is for economic reasons, as well as consultation with worker representatives about ways to avoid layoffs. Most developed countries regard information and consultation in the event of any economic change as a fundamental right. The United States government also helped write Control Council Law No 22 for post-war Germany which enabled unions to collectively bargain for elected work councils, which would have the right to participate in decisions about dismissals. However, there are no state or federal laws requiring severance pay or employee participation in layoff decisions. Where employment contracts or collective agreements contain &quot;just cause&quot; provisions, these have been interpreted to give employers broad discretion, and immunity from the social consequences for the laid off workforce.
The only statutory right for employees is for extreme cases of mass layoffs under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988. The WARN Act regulates any &quot;plant closing&quot; where there is an &quot;employment loss&quot; of 33% of employees if that is over 50 employees, or any case of over 500 employee layoffs, and the business employs 100 persons or more. In these cases, employers have to give 60 days notice to employee representatives such as a union, or to each employee if they have none, and the State. Employment loss is defined to include reduction of over 50% of working time, but exclude cases where an employee is offered a suitable alternative job within reasonable commuting distance. Despite the absence of any duty to consult, employers can argue three main defenses for failure to give notice of mass layoff. First, an employer can argue that they believed in good faith that less notice was necessary to improve chances of a capital injection. Second, an employer may argue that business circumstances were unforeseen. Third, an employer can argue it had reasonable grounds for believing its failure was not a violation of the act. The only remedies are pay that would have been due in the notice period, and a $500 a day penalty to the local governments that were not notified. States such as Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine have statutes with slightly more stringent notice requirements, but none yet require real voice for employees before facing economic hardship.

A common cause of layoffs is that businesses are merged or taken over, either through stock market acquisitions or private equity transactions, where new managements want to fire parts of the workforce to augment profits for shareholders. Outside limited defenses in corporate law, this issue is largely unregulated. However, if an employer is under a duty to bargain in good faith with a union, and its business is transferred, there will be a duty on the successor employer to continue bargaining if it has retained a substantial number of the previous workforce. This was not made out in the leading case, &quot;Howard Johnson Co. v. Detroit Local Joint Executive Board&quot;, where the new owner of a restaurant and motor lodge business retained 9 out of 53 former employees, but hired 45 new staff of its own. The majority held there must be &quot;substantial continuity of identity&quot; of the business for the good faith bargaining duty to continue.

===Full employment===
The right to full employment or the &quot;right to work&quot; in a fair paying job is a universal human right in international law, partly inspired by the experience of the New Deal in the 1930s. Unemployment has, however, remained politically divisive because it affects the distribution of wealth and power. When there is full employment under 2%, and everyone can easily find new jobs, worker bargaining power tends to be higher and pay tends to rise, but high unemployment tends to reduce worker power and pay, and may increase shareholder profit. It was long acknowledged that the law should ensure nobody is denied a job by unreasonable restrictions by the state or private parties, and the Supreme Court said in &quot;Truax v. Raich&quot; that &quot;the right to work for a living in the common occupations of the community is of the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity&quot;. During the New Deal with unemployment having reached 20% after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 empowered the President to create the Works Progress Administration, which aimed to directly employ people on fair wages. By 1938, the WPA employed 3.33 million people, and built streets, bridges and buildings across the country. Also created by the 1935 Act, the Rural Electrification Administration brought electrification of farms from 11% in 1934 to 50% by 1942, and nearly 100% by 1949. After war production brought full employment, the WPA was wound up in 1943.
After World War II, the Employment Act of 1946 declared a policy of Congress to &quot;promote full employment and production, increased real income... and reasonable price stability&quot;. However the Act did not follow the original proposal to say &quot;all Americans... are entitled to an opportunity for useful, remunerative, regular, and full-time employment&quot;. By the 1970s, there was a growing opinion that the Equal Protection Clause itself in the 14th Amendment should also mean, according to Justice Marshall in &quot;Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth&quot;, that &quot;every citizen who applies for a government job is entitled to it unless the government can establish some reason for denying the employment.&quot; The Humphrey–Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978 was passed and enabled the President to create jobs to maintain full employment: it stated &quot;the President shall, as may be authorized by law, establish reservoirs of public employment and private nonprofit employment projects&quot;. The Act sets the goal of federal government to ensure unemployment is below &quot;3 per centum among individuals aged twenty and over&quot; with inflation also under 3 per cent. It includes &quot;policy priorities&quot; of the &quot;development of energy sources and supplies, transportation, and environmental improvement&quot;. These powers of a job guarantee, full employment, and environmental improvement have not yet been used. During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was passed to enable more spending, but not a job guarantee.
While the laws for a federal or state job guarantee have not yet been used, the Federal Reserve Act 1913 does require that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System should use its powers &quot;to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.&quot; During the Great Depression it was understood that inequality in the distribution of wealth had contributed to the lack of employment, and that Federal lending policy and bank regulation should pursue a range of objectives. However, the Federal Reserve became dominated by a theory of a natural rate of unemployment, taking the view that attempts to achieve full employment would accelerate inflation to an uncontrollably high. Instead it was said by theorists such as Milton Friedman that central banks should use monetary policy only to control inflation, according to the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). It is doubted that any natural rate of unemployment exists, because the United States and other countries have sustained full employment with low inflation before, and the US unemployment rate follows which political party is in the White House.
If despite fiscal and monetary policy people are unemployed, the Social Security Act of 1935 creates unemployment insurance. One of its goals is to stabilize employment by encouraging employers to retain workers in downturns. Unlike other systems, this makes social security highly dependent on employers. It is funded through a federal payroll tax, and employers that make more layoffs pay higher rates based on past experience. A laid off employee brings a claim to state unemployment office, the former employer is informed and may contest whether the employee was laid off fairly: they are given absolute privilege to communicate information regardless of how false or defamatory it is. Employees cannot get benefits if they are laid off for misconduct, and for participation in strikes, even though the reality may be the employer&#x27;s fault and there are no other jobs available. Social security claimants must also accept any suitable job. Unemployment offices usually provide facilities for claimants to search for work, but many also turn to private employment agencies. The Supreme Court has held that licensing, fees and regulation of employment agencies under state law is constitutional.

===Trade and international law===
* US Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 3, Congress has the power: &quot;To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.&quot; Article IV, Section 2, Clause 1, &quot;The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.&quot;
* Freedom of movement under United States law
* &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;, 22 US 1 (1824) and &quot;Paul v. Virginia&quot;, 75 US 168 (1869)
* Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914
* International Labour Organization and international labor standards
* Bargaining power, race to the bottom, foreign direct investment, human development, technological change, global workforce, immigration
* Tariff Act of 1890, Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, Great Depression
* United States free trade agreements, United States International Trade Commission, 19 USC
* Trade Act of 1974, Trade Agreements Act of 1979, Trade Act of 2002, Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 and Fast track (trade)
* North American Free Trade Agreement, 19 USC ch 21, §3301
* World Trade Organization and Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994
* Permanent normal trade relations
* Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
* Three potential views are:
** (1) expansion of trade is good because it increases the scope for division of labor and expanding markets. So, all customs, taxes, and equivalent restrictions against market access should be dismantled
** (2) free trade is bad because it exacerbates labor&#x27;s inequality of bargaining power against global capital. Trade should be limited and regulated by systems of taxes and tariffs according to the state of other countries&#x27; development
** (3) trade, without barriers to movement of capital, goods and services, improves living standards if labor standards are improved in all countries. This (a) discourages emigration from poorer countries: as people&#x27;s lives improve they may not want to leave (b) requires standards are improved at a rate to ensure stability in capital and labor flows (c) in turn requires that standard should not enable workers to be paid less than is necessary for human development and the workers&#x27; rate of productivity.

==Labor law in individual states==

===California===

In 1959, California added the Division of Fair Employment Practices to the California Department of Industrial Relations. The Fair Employment and Housing Act of 1980 gave the division its own Department of Fair Employment and Housing, with the stated purpose of protecting citizens against harassment and employment discrimination on the basis of: age, ancestry, color, creed, denial of family and medical care leave, disability (including HIV/AIDS), marital status, medical condition, national origin, race, religion, sex, transgender status and sexual orientation. Sexual orientation was not specifically included in the original law but precedent was established based on case law. On October 9, 2011, California Governor Edmund G. &quot;Jerry&quot; Brown signed into law Assembly Bill No. 887 alters the meaning of gender for the purposes of discrimination laws that define sex as including gender so that California law now prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity and gender expression.

The state also has its own labor law covering agricultural workers, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act.

===New Jersey===
In 1945, New Jersey enacted the first statewide civil rights act in the entire nation. with the purpose of protecting citizens against harassment and employment discrimination on the basis of: race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, or ancestry. This has since been expanded to age, sex, disability, pregnancy, sexual orientation, perceived sexual orientation, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, military service, or mental or physical disability, AIDS and HIV related illnesses and atypical hereditary cellular or blood traits.

===Laws restricting unions===
, twenty-six states plus Guam prevent trade unions from signing collective agreements with employers requiring employees pay fees to the union when they are not members (frequently called &quot;right-to-work&quot; laws by their political proponents).

In 2010, the organization &quot;Save Our Secret Ballot&quot; pushed four states: Arizona, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah to pass constitutional amendments to ban card check.

==Enforcement of rights==
* United States Department of Labor
* National Labor Relations Board
* &quot;Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB&quot;, 305 U.S. 364 (1939) the right of the NLRB to withdraw its submissions to the Court were at the court&#x27;s discretion
* &quot;In re NLRB&quot;, 304 U.S. 486 (1938) to enforce an order, the NLRB must file a petition and transcript with the courts
* Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
* &quot;Elgin v. Department of Treasury&quot;, 567 U.S. ___ (2012) 6 to 3, under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 federal employees have no recourse to the federal courts over wrongful discharge cases, but must instead go to the Merit Systems Protection Board.
* &quot;United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs&quot;, 383 U.S. 715 (1966) state and federal jurisdiction in labor disputes

<text>Dover Spencer Peneha Samuels (born 9 July 1939) is a former Labour Member of Parliament in New Zealand from 1996 to 2008.

==Biography==
===Political career===
Samuels started his political career in the 1970s as a councillor for the Whangaroa County Council. He went on to become a councillor and deputy mayor for the Far North District Council.



Samuels joined the Labour Party and became its Māori Senior Vice President. In 1994 he challenged Maryan Street for the Labour Party presidency, but lost by a wide margin, 303 votes to Street and 75 for Samuels.

He was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal for services to New Zealand.

He first entered Parliament as a list MP in the 1996 election, and was the MP for Te Tai Tokerau since the 1999 election. When the Labour Party formed a government following its victory in 1999, Samuels became the Minister of Māori Affairs, but resigned this role in June 2000 pending an investigation into alleged sex crimes committed before he entered politics. The police later cleared Samuels of all charges, and Samuels alleged that the accusations had political motivations. He was reinstated as a Minister of State in 2002, but in 2005 was involved in further controversy following a late-night incident in which he publicly urinated in a hallway within Auckland&#x27;s Heritage hotel.
Samuels lost his Māori electorate of Te Tai Tokerau in 2005 to the Māori Party candidate Hone Harawira. However, he was returned to parliament due to his high position on the Labour Party list. He was made the Associate Minister for Economic Development, Housing, Tourism and Industry and Regional Development.

On 31 October 2007, during the Cabinet reshuffle, Samuels lost his position as a Minister outside Cabinet and was replaced by Darren Hughes. He returned to the backbench.

Samuels did not contest the 2008 election.

===Personal life===
He is an active member of the Rātana Church of New Zealand and has iwi Affiliations with Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Kurī.

<doc id="1075691" wikidata="Q5507009" url="?curid=1075691" title="Fucked Company">
<text>Fucked Company was a website created by Philip J. &quot;Pud&quot; Kaplan after the dot-com bubble in 2000 as a &quot;dot-com dead pool&quot; that chronicled troubled and failing companies in a unique and abrasive manner. The website also sold rumor listings to subscribers. The site&#x27;s name is a parody of &quot;Fast Company&quot;, a magazine that began covering technology companies during the Internet dot-com boom.

A September 10, 2000 attempt by Kaplan to put the entire site up for sale on eBay attracted joke bids as high as $10 million but no serious buyers.

==History==
Fucked Company (commonly abbreviated FC) allowed employees to post anonymous comments on why their employer was losing money, had abused employees, or was discriminating against some group, identifying unethical managers and defective products or services by name. Employees were free to explain why they thought the companies were going out of business. This made the site a target for strategic lawsuits against public participation from companies. The site was taken offline for two days in August 2002; Ford Motor Company law firm Howard Phillips &amp; Andersen had threatened litigation against FC&#x27;s upstream provider HostGator as a means of silencing a discussion of a series of layoffs entitled &quot;Ford, where finding a job is job one.&quot; Ford claimed that it infringed a trademark slogan &quot;Ford, where quality is job one,&quot; discontinued after widespread use from 1980 to 1997. The site eventually returned minus the news of the Ford layoffs.

Even where the cases were spurious or were settled out of court for a small fee, it drained the resources of FC to fight these lawsuits. As a consumer complaint site, FC also faced increasing competition from new entrants, including social networking providers. Michael Arrington announced on March 31, 2007 that TechCrunch had acquired FuckedCompany.com in an April Fools&#x27; Day joke press release. 

Starting in August 2007, the site ceased posting new content, and later converted its main page to the simple message:

<doc id="1075697" wikidata="Q191843" url="?curid=1075697" title="RC Lens">
<text>Racing Club de Lens (), commonly referred to as RC Lens or simply as Lens, is a French professional football club based in the northern city of Lens in the department of Pas-de-Calais. The club&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Les Sang et Or&quot; (), comes from its traditional colours of red and gold. As of the 2024–25 season, Lens competes in Ligue 1, the highest tier of French football.

Lens won the Division 1 (now Ligue 1) title in the 1997–98 season, and has finished as runner-up on five occasions, most recently in the 2022–23 season, losing out to Paris-Saint Germain by 1 point. The club has a strong rivalry with neighbors LOSC Lille, with whom they contest the &quot;Derby du Nord&quot;.

==History==
===Origin of the club===
The club was established in 1906 in Lens by local students who enjoyed playing football on the city&#x27;s Place Verte (the current Place de la République). The name &quot;Racing Club de Lens&quot; was chosen as a reference to Racing Club de Roubaix and Racing Club de France, both popular clubs at the time.

The club&#x27;s first board of directors was formed by the parents of those students. The club originally played in green and black to represent the founding location; they wore green to represent the name of the home pitch, &quot;Verte&quot;, (meaning &#x27;green&#x27; in French), and black to represent the omnipresence of the coal mining industry in the surrounding area.

Between 1907 and 1912, the players were forced to change home grounds twice before settling at the Parc des Glissoires, situated between Avion and Lens.

During World War I, in common with all French sports clubs, the team&#x27;s activities were stopped and did not restart until 1919. By this time, Lens had changed their playing colours to sky blue.

===Of blood and gold===
It was in 1924 that the red and gold colours first appeared. One legend says that Pierre Moglia, president of the club from 1923 to 1930, chose the colours of the Spanish flag after a colleague from the club remarked that the Saint-Léger church ruins, which they had walked past one evening, were the last visible remains of the local Spanish domination in 1648. Some people also say that the colours were derived as a reference to the local coal mines: the red for the blood of the miners and the gold for the coal which was valuable at the time.

It was also in 1924 that the club was authorised to play at the newly built municipal stadium Raoul Briquet (nowadays Léo Lagrange). The first match for the club in their new colours was played for the inauguration of the stadium.

In 1926, British footballer Kid Fenton was the first star who played for Lens. He stayed for eight seasons and became a strong favourite with the club&#x27;s supporters. This was also the year the first supporters group was formed, and also saw the first occasion that Lens captured the Championnat d&#x27;Artois.

In 1929, Lens won the North championship and won promotion for the first time to the Division d&#x27;Honneur of the Ligue du Nord with the clubs Olympique Lillois, RC Roubaix, Excelsior Athlétic Club de Roubaix and AC Amiens.

In the Artois League, the club steadily gained prestige, and in 1932 the club inaugurated the Stade Félix Bollaert.

===The first victories===

In 1937, Lens gained access to the first division after finishing first in the second division, led by such players as Stefan Dembicki and Spechtl. Lens even managed to reach the last 16 of the Coupe de France, although the team was eventually eliminated by the Red Star, 3–2.

In 1943, Lens won the first division of the Northern Zone thanks to Dembicki, who scored 43 goals in 30 games. A year earlier, in a Coupe de France match, he had scored 17 goals, which still remains to this day the world record for goals scored by one player in a single competitive match.

Immediately following World War II, Lens finished in sixth place in the 1945–46 season, but they were relegated the following year. In 1948, the club played its first Coupe de France final, which they lost 3–2 against Lille. A year later, Lens was promoted to the first division, and Maryan Wisnieski was recruited, in 1953. Problems with the board, however, made him quit the club; he joined Italian club UC Sampdoria Genoa, though without much success.

In 1962, the city of Lens&#x27; mines were shut down and the future of the club was at stake, given that most of the players were miners by profession. Between 1956 and 1968, survival was hard. Nevertheless, in 1964, Lens finished third, with Ahmed Oudjani the top scorer with 30 goals. Another famous player, Georges Lech, joined Lens, although the club was relegated in 1968. The following year, the mine&#x27;s administrators rescinded their ownership of Lens, which signalled the end of professional football at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis. Lens was now once again an amateur club, one year after its relegation, and the long-term future looked very bleak.

===The good years and the fall===
However, better days arrived in 1960 after the town council took interest in Racing Club de Lens. Lens&#x27; mayor, André Delelis, was a long-term supporter and recognized the importance of the club&#x27;s success to the overall morale of the city. With the future president, Jean Bondoux, the mayor brought together volunteers and subscriptions to help the club survive. Moreover, the city recovered ownership of the stadium from the closing mine industry.

The following twenty years saw a slow but steady improvement in the club&#x27;s fortunes. In 1972, Lens reached the semi-finals of the Coupe de France, and the arrival of two Polish players helped the club win promotion to the first division. In 1975, Lens once again reached the final of the Coupe de France against the powerful Saint-Étienne, but lost the game 0–2.

As finalist of the Coupe de France, Lens had the opportunity to participate in its first UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, but the team was knocked out quickly by the Dutch club ADO Den Haag.

Lens&#x27; steady progress continued, and after finishing second in the league behind Nantes, they managed to qualify to the UEFA Cup. They knocked out Swedish club Malmö FF, and more impressively, the strong Italian club Lazio. After an away defeat (2–0), they won 6–0 at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis after extra-time. Unfortunately, after this rare international exploit for a French club, they were then eliminated by East German side 1. FC Magdeburg. Worse still, the club went back to the second division in 1978.

The step backwards was very brief and immediate promotion back to the French elite level was achieved in 1979 with Roger Lemerre as head coach. During the 1980s, Gérard Houllier and Joachim Marx succeeded him. These were great gains to the team, even though the club lost important players such as Didier Sénac, Gaëtan Huard and Philippe Vercruysse.

===Martel&#x27;s takeover===
In August 1988 Gervais Martel, a wealthy local businessman, bought control of the club, with the help of Serge Doré. During the same year, Arnaud Dos Santos was named head coach of the club, and led the club back to the first division in 1991.

In 1993 and 1994, Lens&#x27; strongest team to that date were highly competitive at the top of the league, and the team qualified for the UEFA Cup twice in a row. Lens also reached the semi-final of the Coupe de France after knocking out Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes, although the team lost to Montpellier.

In 1998, &quot;les Sang et Or&quot; wrote the best page of their history under Daniel Leclercq (&quot;the Druid&quot;): French champions, Coupe de la Ligue semi-finalists and finalists of the Coupe de France (against PSG, a 2–1 defeat). Like a symbol, it is a player who started his career in Lens, Yohan Lachor, who scored the goal in Auxerre giving Lens the title in front of Metz. Under the &quot;Druid&quot;, Lens won its second major title in 1999 with the Coupe de la Ligue against Metz, with a goal from Daniel Moreira. That year, in the UEFA Champions League, Lens also became the only club to have beaten English team Arsenal at the famous Wembley Stadium (1–0, with a goal from Mickaël Debève), although they were knocked out on aggregate score over two matches.

During the next season, Leclercq was fired, but Lens nonetheless did well to reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. François Brisson&#x27;s men were eventually eliminated by Arsenal, after they won against 1. FC Kaiserslautern (a 4–1 win in Germany), Atlético Madrid and Celta de Vigo.

In the 2001–02 season, Joël Muller was named head coach. Lens finished second that season and qualified for its second Champions League campaign. The club, however, finished in eighth for the next two years. Muller was replaced during his fourth season by Francis Gillot, who managed to qualify Lens for the UEFA Intertoto Cup, which Lens won, ensuring qualification for the UEFA Cup.

During the 2006–07 season, the &quot;Sang et Or&quot; finished the first part of the season in second, behind Lyon. But due to a chaotic second half, however, they only finished fifth. A few days later, Francis Gillot resigned.

On 5 June 2007, Guy Roux made his comeback, although it only lasted three months: He resigned after a 2–1 defeat at Strasbourg. Jean-Pierre Papin took over, but Lens could not make up any ground throughout the season, finishing 18th, two points behind Toulouse, resulting in relegation to Ligue 2 for the next season. Lens finished the season with just 40 points, winning only 9 times in 38 matches.

After a slow start in their only year in Ligue 2, they managed to finish as leaders during the first half of the season. Earning 13 out of 15 points in their first five games of the second half, everything looked set for a quick return to the first league. After only taking five points of the next six games, however, the promotion race was open again, although Lens recovered and became champions, securing promotion to Ligue 1 for 2009–10. After the 2010–11 season, however, they again dropped to Ligue 2.

On 16 May 2014, Lens sealed promotion back to Ligue 1 on the final day of the season following a 2–0 win at Bastia. On 27 June, however, the League&#x27;s National Directorate of Management Control (DNCG) blocked Lens&#x27; promotion to the top flight due to irregularities in the club&#x27;s proposed budget for its next season. The issue was a €10 million payment due from major shareholder Hafiz Mammadov that was missing from the accounts. Lens president Gervais Martel claimed a public holiday in Mammadov&#x27;s native Azerbaijan had resulted in the delay and said the club would appeal. On 15 July, however, their promotion was in jeopardy after an appeal commission upheld their appeal since the missing funds still had not yet arrived in the club&#x27;s accounts. Lens immediately declared their intention to appeal to the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF), which has the power to overrule the DNCG. On 25 July, the CNSOF recommended Lens should be allowed to play in Ligue 1. Because the Stade Bollaert-Delelis was being renovated for UEFA Euro 2016, Lens played their home matches for the 2014–15 Ligue 1 season at the Stade de la Licorne, home of Amiens, and at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis.

It was announced on 29 January 2015 that Lens&#x27; promotion from Ligue 2 at the end of the 2013–14 season has been ruled invalid, and will thus be automatically relegated to Ligue 2 for the 2015–16 season, regardless of where the team places. Thus, in August 2015 Lens returned to Ligue 2, albeit playing at the renovated Stade Bollaert-Delelis. They drew an average home attendance of 28,996 in the 2016–17 season, the highest in Ligue 2 but missed promotion to the Ligue 1 during a tumultuous last day of the season.

=== New direction and return to Ligue 1 ===
In the 2017–18 Ligue 2 season, Lens lost their first seven matches in a row, the worst start to a season in the club&#x27;s history. On 18 September, Lens finally got their first win of the season over US Quevilly-Rouen 2–0.

In the 2018–19 Ligue 2 season, Lens finished 5th on the table and reached the promotion play off final against Dijon FCO. After a 1–1 draw in the first leg, Lens would lose the second leg and the tie 3–1 after two goalkeeping blunders by Jérémy Vachoux cost his side a chance of promotion to Ligue 1.

On 30 April 2020, Lens were promoted to Ligue 1 after the LFP decided to end the seasons of both Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France. Lens were second on the table in Ligue 2 at the time of the decision.

In the 2020–21 season, Lens finished 7th on the Ligue 1 table after an impressive first season back in France&#x27;s top flight. They finished seventh again in the following season with 62 points, despite being ranked second behind Paris Saint-Germain in the first half of the season.

In the 2022–23 season, Lens won 10 games out of 10 at home during the first part of the season. On 1 January 2023, Lens beat PSG 3–1 and became the first team to defeat Paris, which had been unbeaten since the start of the season. Halfway through the season, Lens was second, three points behind PSG. On 1 March 2023, Lens was eliminated from the Coupe de France after a 2–1 defeat against Nantes in the quarter-finals. On 27 May, Lens won 3–0 against Ajaccio, finished 2nd in Ligue 1 and qualified for the Champions League for the third time in their history after 1998–99 and 2002–03.

<text>Paul Desmond Swain (born 20 December 1951) is a former New Zealand politician. He was a Member of the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1990 until 2008, representing the Labour Party. From 2010 to 2019, he was a councillor on the Greater Wellington Regional Council.

==Early life==
Swain was born in Palmerston North on 20 December 1951. He attended St. Patrick&#x27;s College in Wellington. He obtained a BA from Victoria University of Wellington. Swain has two daughters and a son with his wife Toni Reeves-Swain, and two sons from an earlier marriage.

Before entering politics, he worked for the Ministry of Social Development from 1975 to 1976 before becoming a bus driver for the Wellington City Council in 1976. He then changed professions again, working as a teacher from 1978 to 1982. In 1987 he became a research officer for the New Zealand Federation of Labour (later Council of Trade Unions) until 1990 when he was elected to parliament.

He was the employee coordinator for the Wellington YMCA from 1982 to 1986 and was also chairman of the Wellington Regional Employment and ACCESS Council. At the 1986 local elections he stood for the Wellington Regional Council on the Labour Party ticket. He polled well but did not win a seat.

==Member of Parliament==


He was MP for the seat of Eastern Hutt from the 1990 election until the 1996 election, when the electorate boundaries were changed and it became Rimutaka. He won Rimutaka in 1996 and held the seat until the 2008 election, which he did not contest, retiring from national politics.

In November 1990 he was appointed as Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for Forestry by Labour leader Mike Moore. In a December 1991 reshuffle Swain was given the Housing portfolio as well. He supported Helen Clark&#x27;s successful leadership challenge against Moore in 1993. He retained housing and lost forestry, but later also became spokesperson for accident compensation between 1993 and 1996. From 1996 to 1999 Swain was Shadow Minister of Commerce and State Owned Enterprises. His select committee memberships included postings on the commerce committee; foreign affairs, defence and trade committee; and finance and expenditure committee.

===Minister===
Swain has held a number of ministerial portfolios, including Associate Minister of Finance, Minister of Commerce, Minister of Communications, Minister of Corrections, Minister of Immigration, Minister for Information Technology, Minister of Labour, Minister of Statistics, Minister for State Owned Enterprises, Minister of Transport, and Associate Minister for Economic Development.

After the 2005 election, Swain decided not to seek a Cabinet post in the new government.

==Life after politics==
In the 2009 New Year Honours, Swain was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order, for services as a Member of Parliament.

In 2009, he was employed by the Crown as their lead negotiator for a settlement of historical grievances with Ngāti Porou.

He was elected to the Greater Wellington Regional Council, in the Upper Hutt constituency, in 2010 and was re-elected in 2013 and 2016. In July 2019, Swain announced he would not seek a fourth term on the council.

In 2016, he became chairman of the New Zealand Fire Service; now Fire and Emergency New Zealand.

<text>Maroondah Highway (also known as Whitehorse Road from Deepdene to Surrey Hills) is a major east–west thoroughfare in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and a highway connecting the north-eastern fringes of Melbourne to Mansfield, at the lower alpine region of Victoria, Australia.

Maroondah Link Highway links Cathkin (on Goulburn Valley Highway) and Yarck (on Maroondah Highway), allowing an easier link to Melba Highway via Yea for Melbourne traffic.

==Route==
Whitehorse Road/Maroondah Highway commences at the intersection of Cotham Road and Burke Road at Deepdene, and heads in an easterly direction as a four lane, single carriageway arterial road (with on-street tram tracks), through the suburbs of Balwyn and Deepdene; the route 109 tram also runs along this stretch of the road. It continues east through Mont Albert, to the intersection with Elgar Road in Box Hill, where the road widens to four-lane dual carriageway, with trams running down the central median strip (Burke Road and Elgar Roads being the east and west boundaries of Captain Elgar&#x27;s original two mile square property); the tram tracks terminate at Market Street, a few blocks further on, and it widens further to a six-lane dual-carriageway just beyond at the intersection with Station Street. It continues east through the suburbs of Blackburn and Nunawading to the intersection with Mitcham Road in Mitcham, where Whitehorse Road ends and the road continues east only as Maroondah Highway. It continues north-east past Croydon to the intersection with Mooroolbark and Victoria Roads on the western edge of Lilydale, where it narrows to a four-lane single carriageway road, and runs through Iliydale, after which it becomes a rural highway. There is a moderately steep and moderately twisty section through forest between Healesville and Buxton, and the road then continues through farmland all the way through Alexandra and Bonnie Doon to eventually terminate at the intersection with Midland Highway in Mansfield.

==History==
In the 1850s, Whitehorse Road was built to be the primary route from Melbourne to Gippsland, a rather circuitous route which went via the Dandenong Ranges. Today the primary route is now via the Monash and Princes Freeways.

The road, when first built, was named Three Chain Road, due to the road width being wide.

The traffic led to the establishment of a hotel in Box Hill named the White Horse hotel which had been named for a horse belonging to Captain Elgar, a property owner in the area. It is this hotel of which the road obtained its name. However, the hotel was forced to shut its doors in 1921 when Box Hill became a dry area. A replica of the white horse from the roof of the hotel now stands in the median strip of Whitehorse Road, while the restored original is located in the Box Hill Town Hall.

The passing of the &quot;Country Roads Act of 1912&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria provided for the establishment of the Country Roads Board (later VicRoads) and their ability to declare Main Roads, taking responsibility for the management, construction and care of the state&#x27;s major roads from local municipalities. (Main) Healesville Road, from Ringwood through Lilydale to the Yarra River on the western edge of Healesville, and Healesville-Alexandra Road, from the Yarra River to Buxton, were declared Main Roads on 20 October 1913; the rest of Healesville-Alexandra Road from Buxton through Taggerty to Alexandra, and Cathkin-Mansfield Road from Cathkin to Merton, were declared as Main Roads on 16 November 1914; Mansfield Road from Merton through Mansfield to Merrijig was declared a Main Road on 30 November 1914; another portion of Main Healesville Road between Nunawading and Ringwood was declared a Main Road on 3 May 1915; and Yarck Road between Yarck and Koriella was declared a Main Road on 20 September 1915.

The passing of the &quot;Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924&quot; provided for the declaration of State Highways, roads two-thirds financed by the State government through the Country Roads Board. Maroondah Highway was declared a State Highway in the 1947/48 financial year, from Union Road in Surrey Hills via Lilydale, Healesville, Alexandra, Yarck and Merton to Mansfield (for a total of 116 miles), subsuming the original declaration of (Main) Healesville Road, Healesville-Alexandra Road, Yarck Road, Cathkin-Mansfield Road (between Yarck and Merton) and Mansfield Road as Main Roads. Maroondah Link Highway was later declared as a State Highway on 9 May 1983, subsuming the remaining declaration of Cathkin-Mansfield Road between Yarck and Cathkin as a Main Road.

Maroondah Highway was signed as Metropolitan Route 34 between Deepdene and Lilydale in 1965, later extended to Alexandra in 1986, and signed State Route 153 between Yarck and Mansfield in 1986. With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, Metropolitan Route 34 was truncated back to Lilydale, and replaced by routes B300 between Lilydale and Coldstream, route B360 between Coldstream and Alexandra, C516 between Koriella and Yarck, B300 between Yarck and Maindample, and B320 between Maindample and Mansfield. Maroondah Link Highway was signed State Route 153 between Cathkin and Yarck in 1986, and was later replaced by route B300.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads declared this road as Whitehorse Road (Arterial #5996), beginning from Burke Road in Balwyn and ending at Union Road, Surrey Hills, as Maroondah Highway (Arterial #6720), from Burke Road to where it meets Midland Highway in Mansfield (this declaration overlaps the Whitehorse Road declaration in its entirety: dual-naming is observed on signposts, but despite ending in Surrey Hills dual-naming has been confusingly signposted as far east as Mitcham Road), and as Maroondah Link Highway (Arterial #6020), from Goulburn Valley Highway in Cathkin to Maroondah Highway in Yarck.
