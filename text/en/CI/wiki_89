<text>Discreet Music is the fourth studio album by Brian Eno, and the first released under his full name (as opposed to simply &quot;Eno&quot;). The album is a minimalist work, with the titular A-side consisting of one 30-minute piece featuring synthesizer and tape delay. The B-side features three variations on Canon in D Major by Johann Pachelbel, performed by the Cockpit Ensemble and conducted by Gavin Bryars.

While his earlier collaborations with Robert Fripp and several selections from &quot;Another Green World&quot; (1975) feature similar ideas, &quot;Discreet Music&quot; marked a clear step toward the ambient aesthetic Eno would later codify with 1978&#x27;s &quot;Ambient 1: Music for Airports&quot;.

==Background==

Brian Eno&#x27;s concept of ambient music builds upon a concept composer Erik Satie called &quot;furniture music&quot;. This means music that is intended to blend into the ambient atmosphere of the room rather than be directly focused upon. Like Satie&#x27;s notion of music that could &quot;mingle with the sound of the knives and forks at dinner&quot;, &quot;Discreet Music&quot; was created to play in, and blend with, the subtle background audio of various, or any given, situation.

The inspiration for this album began when Eno was left bed-ridden by an automobile accident and was given an album of eighteenth-century harp music by a visiting friend, Judy Nylon. After she left, according to the &quot;Discreet Music&quot; liner notes, Eno inadvertently played the harp album almost inaudibly, which &quot;presented what was for me a new way of hearing music – as part of the ambience of the environment&quot;. Nylon recalled the event differently: &quot;I put the harp music on and balanced it as best as I could from where I stood; [Eno] caught on immediately to what I was doing and helped me balance the softness of the rain patter with the faint string sound for where he lay in the room. There was no &#x27;ambience by mistake&#x27;.&quot; Eno related another version in a 2011 interview: &quot;[Nylon] put a record on and then left. The record was much too quiet but I couldn&#x27;t reach to turn it up and it was raining outside ... I suddenly thought of this idea of making music that didn&#x27;t impose itself on your space ... but created a sort of landscape you could belong to&quot;.

This album is also an experiment in generative composition. His intention was to explore multiple ways to create music with limited planning or intervention. Nicole V. Gagné described the album as &quot;a minimalist work using tape-delay and synthesizer&quot; that would lead to Eno&#x27;s further experiments in ambient music.

In a 1979 interview with Lester Bangs, Eno called &quot;Discreet Music&quot; the most successful of his recordings, explaining that it &quot;was done very, very easily, very quickly, very cheaply, with no pain or anguish over anything, and I still like it.&quot;

==Recording==
The A-side of the album is a thirty-minute piece originally intended as a background drone for guitarist Robert Fripp to play over in a series of concerts. Eno set up a synthesizer with built-in memory along with a tape delay system, but was immediately interrupted: &quot;people started knocking on the door, and I was answering the phone and adjusting all this stuff as it ran. I almost made that without listening to it. It was really automatic music.&quot; The liner notes contain a diagram of how this piece was created. It begins with two melodic phrases of different lengths played back from a synthesizer&#x27;s digital recall system. The equipment used in this case was an EMS Synthi AKS, which had a then-exotic, built-in digital sequencer. This signal is then run through a graphic equaliser to occasionally change its timbre. It is then run through an echo unit before being recorded onto a tape machine. The tape runs to the take-up reel of a second machine, and the output of that machine is fed back into the first tape machine which records the overlapped signals. The next day, Fripp visited and Eno accidentally played the piece back at half-speed, thinking that &quot;it was probably one of the best things I’d ever done and I didn’t even realize I was doing it at the time.&quot;

The second half of the album consists of three related pieces, collectively titled &quot;Three Variations on the Canon in D Major by Johann Pachelbel&quot;, performed by the Cockpit Ensemble, and conducted and co-arranged by Gavin Bryars. Bryars later wrote that &quot;the Cockpit Ensemble&quot; was a &quot;catchall name&quot; for the hired studio musicians, as many did not wish to be credited. Eno described the music as the result of a self-generating, self-regulating system, with the input to the system taking the form of two- or four-measure fragments of Pachelbel&#x27;s canon, and the system being the performers with a set of instructions. Each variation involves a different way of manipulating and overlaying the musical fragments. In the first piece, &quot;Fullness of Wind&quot;, the players&#x27; tempos are decreased, with the rate of decrease being related to the relative pitch of the instruments, so that lower instruments are slowest. In the second piece, &quot;French Catalogues&quot;, groups of notes are associated with time-related directions from different parts of the score. The third piece, &quot;Brutal Ardour&quot;, presents the players with sequences of notes that are related but of different lengths. The titles of these pieces were derived from inaccurate French-to-English translations of the liner notes of a version of Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon performed by the orchestra of Jean-Francois Paillard.

==Release==

&quot;Discreet Music&quot; was the third (of four) simultaneous releases on Eno&#x27;s new Obscure Records label.

This album was re-released on the Virgin label in 2004. On CD reissues, a full minute of silence separates &quot;Discreet Music&quot; title track from the Pachelbel piece.

==Reception and legacy==
Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in June 1977, Robert Christgau stated that the album &quot;encourages a meditative but secular mood (good for hard bits of writing) more effectively than any of the other rock-identified avant-garde music that&#x27;s come our way&quot;. In 1979, Lester Bangs described it as &quot;either the definitive unobtrusively lustrous statement on ambient musics or a wispy treacly bore that defies you to actually pay attention to it [...] depending on your point of view.&quot;

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; described the album as &quot;striking and haunting, filled with beauty and apprehension, paralleling the minimalist music being made by Steve Reich and Philip Glass.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Sean Westergaard said it is Eno&#x27;s &quot;first full foray into what has become known as ambient music,&quot; and added that &quot;[the album&#x27;s] reputation as a groundbreaking and influential work is surpassed only by its placid beauty.&quot;

This album was a favourite of David Bowie&#x27;s, and led to his collaboration with Eno on Bowie&#x27;s late 1970s Berlin Trilogy.

The &quot;operational diagram&quot; printed on the rear sleeve of &quot;Discreet Music&quot; would serve as inspiration for other musicians to experiment with tape delay, such as Thomas Leer and Robert Rental on their 1979 album &quot;The Bridge&quot;.

For the 40th anniversary (2015) of the release of the album, the Canadian music ensemble Contact recorded &quot;Discreet Music&quot; with classical instruments as a seven-part one hour work.

<doc id="1075035" wikidata="Q1172354" url="?curid=1075035" title="Database abstraction layer">
<text>A database abstraction layer (DBAL or DAL) is an application programming interface which unifies the communication between a computer application and databases such as SQL Server, IBM Db2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQLite. Traditionally, all database vendors provide their own interface that is tailored to their products. It is up to the application programmer to implement code for the database interfaces that will be supported by the application. Database abstraction layers reduce the amount of work by providing a consistent API to the developer and hide the database specifics behind this interface as much as possible. There exist many abstraction layers with different interfaces in numerous programming languages. If an application has such a layer built in, it is called database-agnostic.

== Database levels of abstraction ==
=== Physical level (lowest level) ===
The lowest level connects to the database and performs the actual operations required by the users. At this level the conceptual instruction has been translated into multiple instructions that the database understands. Executing the instructions in the correct order allows the DAL to perform the conceptual instruction.

Implementation of the physical layer may use database-specific APIs or use the underlying language standard database access technology and the database&#x27;s version SQL.

Implementation of data types and operations are the most database-specific at this level.

=== Conceptual or logical level (middle or next highest level) ===
The conceptual level consolidates external concepts and instructions into an intermediate data structure that can be devolved into physical instructions. This layer is the most complex as it spans the external and physical levels. Additionally it needs to span all the supported databases and their quirks, APIs, and problems.

This level is aware of the differences between the databases and able to construct an execution path of operations in all cases. However the conceptual layer defers to the physical layer for the actual implementation of each individual operation.

=== External or view level ===
The external level is exposed to users and developers and supplies a consistent pattern for performing database operations.
 Database operations are represented only loosely as SQL or even database access at this level.

Every database should be treated equally at this level with no apparent difference despite varying physical data types and operations.

== Database abstraction in the API ==
Libraries unify access to databases by providing a single low-level programming interface to the application developer. Their advantages are most often speed and flexibility because they are not tied to a specific query language (subset) and only have to implement a thin layer to reach their goal. As all SQL dialects are similar to one another, application developers can use all the language features, possibly providing configurable elements for database-specific cases, such as typically user-IDs and credentials. A thin-layer allows the same queries and statements to run on a variety of database products with negligible overhead.

Popular use for database abstraction layers are among object-oriented programming languages, which are similar to API-level abstraction layers. In an object-oriented language like C++ or Java, a database can be represented through an object, whose methods and members (or the equivalent thereof in other programming languages) represent various functionalities of the database. They also share advantages and disadvantages with API-level interfaces.

== Language-level abstraction ==
An example of a database abstraction layer on the language level would be ODBC that is a platform-independent implementation of a database abstraction layer. The user installs specific driver software, through which ODBC can communicate with a database or set of databases. The user then has the ability to have programs communicate with ODBC, which then relays the results back and forth between the user programs and the database. The downside of this abstraction level is the increased overhead to transform statements into constructs understood by the target database.

Alternatively, there are thin wrappers, often described as &quot;lightweight&quot; abstraction layers, such as OpenDBX and libzdb. Finally, large projects may develop their own libraries, such as, for example, libgda for GNOME.

== Arguments ==
=== In favor ===
* Development period: software developers only have to know the database abstraction layer&#x27;s API instead of all APIs of the databases their application should support. The more databases should be supported the bigger is the time saving.
* Wider potential install-base: using a database abstraction layer means that there is no requirement for new installations to utilise a specific database, i.e. new users who are unwilling or unable to switch databases can deploy on their existing infrastructure.
* Future-proofing: as new database technologies emerge, software developers won&#x27;t have to adapt to new interfaces.
* Developer testing: a production database may be replaced with a desktop-level implementation of the data for developer-level unit tests.
* Added Database Features: depending on the database and the DAL, it may be possible for the DAL to add features to the database. A DAL may use database programming facilities or other methods to create standard but unsupported functionality or completely new functionality. For instance, the DBvolution DAL implements the standard deviation function for several databases that do not support it.

=== Against it ===
* Speed: any abstraction layer will reduce the overall speed more or less depending on the amount of additional code that has to be executed. The more a database layer abstracts from the native database interface and tries to emulate features not present on all database backends, the slower the overall performance. This is especially true for database abstraction layers that try to unify the query language as well like ODBC.
* Dependency: a database abstraction layer provides yet another functional dependency for a software system, i.e. a given database abstraction layer, like anything else, may eventually become obsolete, outmoded or unsupported.
* Masked operations: database abstraction layers may limit the number of available database operations to a subset of those supported by the supported database backends. In particular, database abstraction layers may not fully support database backend-specific optimizations or debugging features. These problems magnify significantly with database size, scale, and complexity.

<doc id="1075039" wikidata="Q7028221" url="?curid=1075039" title="Nickajack Expedition">
<text>The Nickajack Expedition in 1794 was a long-running battle fought from late summer to fall between American frontiersmen and the Chickamauga Cherokee. This Cherokee band had resisted the increasing American encroachment into their territory and raided American settlements in the region. 

The military expedition was a decisive success for the American settlers of what was then called the Southwest Territory and surrounding regions. It eventually became known to Americans as the &quot;Last Battle of the Cherokee&quot;. Other Cherokee defeats followed shortly, and the US forced them to agree to another treaty ceding some of their land. A total of 39 Cherokee chiefs and leaders, including Chickamauga, signed the 1798 Treaty of Tellico, ceding a large territory in East Tennessee to the United States.

==Background==
Following a 1777 peace treaty between Native Americans and the American settlers of the Overhill settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains during the American War of Independence, followers of the Cherokee chief Dragging Canoe (who opposed the peace), separated from the tribe and relocated to what is today southeastern Tennessee, near the borders with Georgia and the area later known as Alabama. 

They were joined by bands of Shawnee and Creek at this new settlement, which had been established along Chickamauga Creek; it became their namesake. During the Revolutionary War, the Chickamauga Cherokee engaged in ongoing raids against American settlers, often with British and Spanish military aid. 

Shortly after the conclusion to the war, the Cherokee moved again, this time west of Lookout Mountain, using Nickajack Cave as a stronghold. Violence between them and European Americans continued for decades.

Notwithstanding the December 1791 Treaty of Holston between Territorial Governor William Blount and most Cherokee bands, settlers in the &quot;Cumberland Region&quot; (especially around the Nashville area) still feared for their lives. They had been frequently raided by the Chickamauga and their allies to the south. By 1792, Blount was engaged in continuing peace negotiations with the Chickamauga. In September 1792 when the Nickajack native peoples launched their attack against the Mero District that was foiled at the Battle of Buchanan&#x27;s Station those negotiations failed, and resulted in two more years of defensive engagements on the part of the American settlers. When the sons of Colonel Anthony Bledsoe (1739-1788) and Major General George Winchester were killed in 1794, however, Blount finally sanctioned military action.

== The expedition ==

Governor Blount appointed Major James Ore to head an expedition against the Chickamauga, or &quot;Lower Cherokee&quot; as they had come to be known. Col. John Montgomery commanded the territorial militia, and Col. William Whitley of Kentucky (whose state had also been subject to Cherokee attack from this area ) commanded his 6th Regiment of militia. They singled out two Chickamauga villages, Nickajack Town and Running Water Town, as targets, as these had been the source of many raiding parties. In the mountainous areas, the American force struggled to find the sites and plan attacks. 

The expeditions finally reached Nickajack Town in mid-August, but found only a hundred or so warriors present. Many of the villagers had heard of the army&#x27;s approach and had fled to Running Water Town before Ore&#x27;s men could reach the village. Warriors from Running Water Town were on their way to Nickajack to investigate the activity and encountered the fleeing villagers. The Nickajack warriors joined with those from Running Water, and together they returned to engage the Americans. 

By this time the militias had begun to pursue the fleeing villagers. The soldiers and warriors met at &quot;the Narrows&quot; along the Tennessee River and engaged in battle. It proved to be a disaster for the Chickamauga. They were routed after wounding only three Americans, and killing none. The state militias left 70 dead and destroyed both villages, including food stores.

== Aftermath ==
Coupled with other military victories by the Americans after the Cherokee defeat at Nickajack and Running Water towns, the Cherokee agreed to treaty. A total of 39 Cherokee chiefs and leaders, including those representing the Chickamauga band, finally signed the 1798 Treaty of Tellico, ceding a large amount of land in East Tennessee to the United States.

<doc id="1075046" wikidata="Q841382" url="?curid=1075046" title="Interactome">
<text>In molecular biology, an interactome is the whole set of molecular interactions in a particular cell. The term specifically refers to physical interactions among molecules (such as those among proteins, also known as protein–protein interactions, PPIs; or between small molecules and proteins) but can also describe sets of indirect interactions among genes (genetic interactions). 
The word &quot;interactome&quot; was originally coined in 1999 by a group of French scientists headed by Bernard Jacq. Mathematically, interactomes are generally displayed as graphs. though interactomes may be described as biological networks, they should not be confused with other networks such as neural networks or food webs.

==Molecular interaction networks==
Molecular interactions can occur between molecules belonging to different biochemical families (proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, etc.) and also within a given family. Whenever such molecules are connected by physical interactions, they form molecular interaction networks that are generally classified by the nature of the compounds involved. Most commonly, &quot;interactome&quot; refers to &quot;protein–protein interaction&quot; (PPI) network (PIN) or subsets thereof. For instance, the Sirt-1 protein interactome and Sirt family second order interactome is the network involving Sirt-1 and its directly interacting proteins where as second order interactome illustrates interactions up to second order of neighbors (Neighbors of neighbors). Another extensively studied type of interactome is the protein–DNA interactome, also called a &quot;gene-regulatory network&quot;, a network formed by transcription factors, chromatin regulatory proteins, and their target genes. Even &quot;metabolic networks&quot; can be considered as molecular interaction networks: metabolites, i.e. chemical compounds in a cell, are converted into each other by enzymes, which have to bind their substrates physically.

In fact, all interactome types are interconnected. For instance, protein interactomes contain many enzymes which in turn form biochemical networks. Similarly, gene regulatory networks overlap substantially with protein interaction networks and signaling networks.

==Size==

It has been suggested that the size of an organism&#x27;s interactome correlates better than genome size with the biological complexity of the organism. Although protein–protein interaction maps containing several thousand binary interactions are now available for several species, none of them is presently complete and the size of interactomes is still a matter of debate.

===Yeast===
The yeast interactome, i.e. all protein–protein interactions among proteins of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, has been estimated to contain between 10,000 and 30,000 interactions. A reasonable estimate may be on the order of 20,000 interactions. Larger estimates often include indirect or predicted interactions, often from affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP/MS) studies.

==Genetic interaction networks==

Genes interact in the sense that they affect each other&#x27;s function. For instance, a mutation may be harmless, but when it is combined with another mutation, the combination may turn out to be lethal. Such genes are said to &quot;interact genetically&quot;. Genes that are connected in such a way form &quot;genetic interaction networks&quot;. Some of the goals of these networks are: develop a functional map of a cell&#x27;s processes, drug target identification using chemoproteomics, and to predict the function of uncharacterized genes.

In 2010, the most &quot;complete&quot; gene interactome produced to date was compiled from about 5.4 million two-gene comparisons to describe &quot;the interaction profiles for ~75% of all genes in the budding yeast&quot;, with ~170,000 gene interactions. The genes were grouped based on similar function so as to build a functional map of the cell&#x27;s processes. Using this method the study was able to predict known gene functions better than any other genome-scale data set as well as adding functional information for genes that hadn&#x27;t been previously described. From this model genetic interactions can be observed at multiple scales which will assist in the study of concepts such as gene conservation. Some of the observations made from this study are that there were twice as many negative as positive interactions, negative interactions were more informative than positive interactions, and genes with more connections were more likely to result in lethality when disrupted.

==Interactomics==
Interactomics is a discipline at the intersection of bioinformatics and biology that deals with studying both the interactions and the consequences of those interactions between and among proteins, and other molecules within a cell. Interactomics thus aims to compare such networks of interactions (i.e., interactomes) between and within species in order to find how the traits of such networks are either preserved or varied.

Interactomics is an example of &quot;top-down&quot; systems biology, which takes an overhead view of a biosystem or organism. Large sets of genome-wide and proteomic data are collected, and correlations between different molecules are inferred. From the data new hypotheses are formulated about feedbacks between these molecules. These hypotheses can then be tested by new experiments.

==Experimental methods to map interactomes==
The study of interactomes is called interactomics. The basic unit of a protein network is the protein–protein interaction (PPI). While there are numerous methods to study PPIs, there are relatively few that have been used on a large scale to map whole interactomes.

The yeast two hybrid system (Y2H) is suited to explore the binary interactions among two proteins at a time. Affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometry is suited to identify a protein complex. Both methods can be used in a high-throughput (HTP) fashion. Yeast two hybrid screens allow false positive interactions between proteins that are never expressed in the same time and place; affinity capture mass spectrometry does not have this drawback, and is the current gold standard. Yeast two-hybrid data better indicates non-specific tendencies towards sticky interactions rather while affinity capture mass spectrometry better indicates functional in vivo protein–protein interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.3389/fnmol.2014.00058&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational methods to study interactomes==
Once an interactome has been created, there are numerous ways to analyze its properties. However, there are two important goals of such analyses. First, scientists try to elucidate the systems properties of interactomes, e.g. the topology of its interactions. Second, studies may focus on individual proteins and their role in the network. Such analyses are mainly carried out using bioinformatics methods and include the following, among many others:

===Validation===
First, the coverage and quality of an interactome has to be evaluated. Interactomes are never complete, given the limitations of experimental methods. For instance, it has been estimated that typical Y2H screens detect only 25% or so of all interactions in an interactome. The coverage of an interactome can be assessed by comparing it to benchmarks of well-known interactions that have been found and validated by independent assays. Other methods filter out false positives calculating the similarity of known annotations of the proteins involved or define a likelihood of interaction using the subcellular localization of these proteins.

===Predicting PPIs===

Using experimental data as a starting point, &quot;homology transfer&quot; is one way to predict interactomes. Here, PPIs from one organism are used to predict interactions among homologous proteins in another organism (&quot;interologs&quot;). However, this approach has certain limitations, primarily because the source data may not be reliable (e.g. contain false positives and false negatives). In addition, proteins and their interactions change during evolution and thus may have been lost or gained. Nevertheless, numerous interactomes have been predicted, e.g. that of &quot;Bacillus licheniformis&quot;.

Some algorithms use experimental evidence on structural complexes, the atomic details of binding interfaces and produce detailed atomic models of protein–protein complexes as well as other protein–molecule interactions. Other algorithms use only sequence information, thereby creating unbiased complete networks of interaction with many mistakes.

Some methods use machine learning to distinguish how interacting protein pairs differ from non-interacting protein pairs in terms of pairwise features such as cellular colocalization, gene co-expression, how closely located on a DNA are the genes that encode the two proteins, and so on. Random Forest has been found to be most-effective machine learning method for protein interaction prediction. Such methods have been applied for discovering protein interactions on human interactome, specifically the interactome of Membrane proteins and the interactome of Schizophrenia-associated proteins.

===Text mining of PPIs===
Some efforts have been made to extract systematically interaction networks directly from the scientific literature. Such approaches range in terms of complexity from simple co-occurrence statistics of entities that are mentioned together in the same context (e.g. sentence) to sophisticated natural language processing and machine learning methods for detecting interaction relationships.

===Protein function prediction===
Protein interaction networks have been used to predict the function of proteins of unknown functions. This is usually based on the assumption that uncharacterized proteins have similar functions as their interacting proteins (&quot;guilt by association&quot;). For example, YbeB, a protein of unknown function was found to interact with ribosomal proteins and later shown to be involved in bacterial and eukaryotic (but not archaeal) translation. Although such predictions may be based on single interactions, usually several interactions are found. Thus, the whole network of interactions can be used to predict protein functions, given that certain functions are usually enriched among the interactors. The term &quot;hypothome&quot; has been used to denote an interactome wherein at least one of the genes or proteins is a hypothetical protein.

===Perturbations and disease===

The &quot;topology&quot; of an interactome makes certain predictions how a network reacts to the perturbation (e.g. removal) of nodes (proteins) or edges (interactions). Such perturbations can be caused by mutations of genes, and thus their proteins, and a network reaction can manifest as a disease. A network analysis can identify drug targets and biomarkers of diseases.

===Network structure and topology===
Interaction networks can be analyzed using the tools of graph theory. Network properties include the degree distribution, clustering coefficients, betweenness centrality, and many others. The distribution of properties among the proteins of an interactome has revealed that the interactome networks often have scale-free topology where functional modules within a network indicate specialized subnetworks. Such modules can be functional, as in a signaling pathway, or structural, as in a protein complex. In fact, it is a formidable task to identify protein complexes in an interactome, given that a network on its own does not directly reveal the presence of a stable complex.

==Studied interactomes==

===Viral interactomes===
Viral protein interactomes consist of interactions among viral or phage proteins. They were among the first interactome projects as their genomes are small and all proteins can be analyzed with limited resources. Viral interactomes are connected to their host interactomes, forming virus-host interaction networks. Some published virus interactomes include

Bacteriophage
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; bacteriophage lambda
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; bacteriophage T7
* &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; bacteriophage Dp-1
* &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; bacteriophage Cp-1

The lambda and VZV interactomes are not only relevant for the biology of these viruses but also for technical reasons: they were the first interactomes that were mapped with multiple Y2H vectors, proving an improved strategy to investigate interactomes more completely than previous attempts have shown.

Human (mammalian) viruses
* Human varicella zoster virus (VZV)
* Chandipura virus
* Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
* Hepatitis C virus (HPC), Human-HCV interactions
* Hepatitis E virus (HEV)
* Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)
* Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)
* Murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV)

===Bacterial interactomes===
Relatively few bacteria have been comprehensively studied for their protein–protein interactions. However, none of these interactomes are complete in the sense that they captured all interactions. In fact, it has been estimated that none of them covers more than 20% or 30% of all interactions, primarily because most of these studies have only employed a single method, all of which discover only a subset of interactions. Among the published bacterial interactomes (including partial ones) are

The &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; interactomes have been analyzed using large-scale protein complex affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP/MS), hence it is not easily possible to infer direct interactions. The others have used extensive yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens. The &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; interactome has been analyzed using a bacterial two-hybrid screen (B2H).

Note that numerous additional interactomes have been predicted using computational methods (see section above).

===Eukaryotic interactomes===
There have been several efforts to map eukaryotic interactomes through HTP methods. While no biological interactomes have been fully characterized, over 90% of proteins in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; have been screened and their interactions characterized, making it the best-characterized interactome. Species whose interactomes have been studied in some detail include 
* &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;
* &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;
* &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;
* &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;
Recently, the pathogen-host interactomes of Hepatitis C Virus/Human (2008), Epstein Barr virus/Human (2008), Influenza virus/Human (2009) were delineated through HTP to identify essential molecular components for pathogens and for their host&#x27;s immune system.

===Predicted interactomes===
As described above, PPIs and thus whole interactomes can be predicted. While the reliability of these predictions is debatable, they are providing hypotheses that can be tested experimentally. Interactomes have been predicted for a number of species, e.g.
* Human (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;)
* Rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot;)
* &quot;Xanthomonas oryzae&quot;
* &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;
* Tomato (&quot;Solanum lycopersicum&quot;)
* Field mustard (&quot;Brassica rapa&quot;) 
* &quot;Maize, corn (Zea mays)&quot;
* Poplar (&quot;Populus trichocarpa&quot;)
* &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;
==Network properties==
Protein interaction networks can be analyzed with the same tool as other networks. In fact, they share many properties with biological or social networks. Some of the main characteristics are as follows.

===Degree distribution===
The degree distribution describes the number of proteins that have a certain number of connections. Most protein interaction networks show a scale-free (power law) degree distribution where the connectivity distribution P(k) ~ k−γ with k being the degree. This relationship can also be seen as a straight line on a log-log plot since, the above equation is equal to log(P(k)) ~ —y•log(k). One characteristic of such distributions is that there are many proteins with few interactions and few proteins that have many interactions, the latter being called &quot;hubs&quot;.

===Hubs===
Highly connected nodes (proteins) are called hubs. Han et al. have coined the term &quot;party hub&quot; for hubs whose expression is correlated with its interaction partners. Party hubs also connect proteins within functional modules such as protein complexes. In contrast, &quot;date hubs&quot; do not exhibit such a correlation and appear to connect different functional modules. Party hubs are found predominantly in AP/MS data sets, whereas date hubs are found predominantly in binary interactome network maps. Note that the validity of the date hub/party hub distinction was disputed. Party hubs generally consist of multi-interface proteins whereas date hubs are more frequently single-interaction interface proteins. Consistent with a role for date-hubs in connecting different processes, in yeast the number of binary interactions of a given protein is correlated to the number of phenotypes observed for the corresponding mutant gene in different physiological conditions.

===Modules===
Nodes involved in the same biochemical process are highly interconnected.

==Evolution==
The evolution of interactome complexity is delineated in a study published in &quot;Nature&quot;. In this study it is first noted that the boundaries between prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes and multicellular eukaryotes are accompanied by orders-of-magnitude reductions in effective population size, with concurrent amplifications of the effects of random genetic drift. The resultant decline in the efficiency of selection seems to be sufficient to influence a wide range of attributes at the genomic level in a nonadaptive manner. The Nature study shows that the variation in the power of random genetic drift is also capable of influencing phylogenetic diversity at the subcellular and cellular levels. Thus, population size would have to be considered as a potential determinant of the mechanistic pathways underlying long-term phenotypic evolution. In the study it is further shown that a phylogenetically broad inverse relation exists between the power of drift and the structural integrity of protein subunits. Thus, the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in populations of small size induces secondary selection for protein–protein interactions that stabilize key gene functions, mitigating the structural degradation promoted by inefficient selection. By this means, the complex protein architectures and interactions essential to the genesis of phenotypic diversity may initially emerge by non-adaptive mechanisms.

==Criticisms, challenges, and responses==

Kiemer and Cesareni raise the following concerns with the state (circa 2007) of the field especially with the comparative interactomic: The experimental procedures associated with the field are error prone leading to &quot;noisy results&quot;. This leads to 30% of all reported interactions being artifacts. In fact, two groups using the same techniques on the same organism found less than 30% interactions in common. However, some authors have argued that such non-reproducibility results from the extraordinary sensitivity of various methods to small experimental variation. For instance, identical conditions in Y2H assays result in very different interactions when different Y2H vectors are used.

Techniques may be biased, i.e. the technique determines which interactions are found. In fact, any method has built in biases, especially protein methods. Because every protein is different no method can capture the properties of each protein. For instance, most analytical methods that work fine with soluble proteins deal poorly with membrane proteins. This is also true for Y2H and AP/MS technologies.

Interactomes are not nearly complete with perhaps the exception of &quot;S. cerevisiae.&quot; This is not really a criticism as any scientific area is &quot;incomplete&quot; initially until the methodologies have been improved. Interactomics in 2015 is where genome sequencing was in the late 1990s, given that only a few interactome datasets are available (see table above).

While genomes are stable, interactomes may vary between tissues, cell types, and developmental stages. Again, this is not a criticism, but rather a description of the challenges in the field.

It is difficult to match evolutionarily related proteins in distantly related species. While homologous DNA sequences can be found relatively easily, it is much more difficult to predict homologous interactions (&quot;interologs&quot;) because the homologs of two interacting proteins do not need to interact. For instance, even within a proteome two proteins may interact but their paralogs may not.

Each protein–protein interactome may represent only a partial sample of potential interactions, even when a supposedly definitive version is published in a scientific journal. Additional factors may have roles in protein interactions that have yet to be incorporated in interactomes. The binding strength of the various protein interactors, microenvironmental factors, sensitivity to various procedures, and the physiological state of the cell all impact protein–protein interactions, yet are usually not accounted for in interactome studies.

<text>Hugh Raymond McCrae OBE (4 October 1876 – 17 February 1958) was an Australian writer, noted for his poetry.

==Life and career==
McCrae was born in Melbourne, the son of the Australian author George Gordon McCrae and grandson of the painter and diarist Georgiana McCrae. Originally he trained as an architect, but later took up drawing, writing and acting, settling eventually in Sydney and later in the New South Wales town of Camden. His works are notable for a sense of lightness and delicacy, and he produced, in addition to a volume of memoirs, a considerable body of verse, and a light operetta, an edition of his grandmother&#x27;s journal, and a volume of prose pieces.

McCrae starred as Australian poet Adam Lindsay Gordon in W. J. Lincoln&#x27;s 1916 feature film &quot;The Life&#x27;s Romance of Adam Lindsay Gordon&quot;, shot in and around Melbourne. In the 1920s, Australian-born composer John Gough set McCrae&#x27;s poem &quot;Song of the Rain&quot; (from the collection &quot;Colombine&quot;) to music. McCrae wrote a fantasy play, &quot;The Ship of Heaven&quot;, which was produced by the Independent Theatre in 1933, for which Alfred Hill composed and conducted the music.

McCrae was well known to a number of distinguished figures in Australian artistic and literary circles. He is remembered for his friendships with Norman Lindsay and Kenneth Slessor, but he was also friendly with such figures as Christopher Brennan and Shaw Neilson. At one time he shared an apartment in New York with Pat Sullivan, the creator of Felix the Cat. When a film about Felix the Cat was being planned, &quot;Sullivan suggested that McCrae should do the drawings while he (Sullivan) supplied the ideas. McCrae refused and has regretted it ever since.&quot;

McCrae was awarded the OBE in 1953. Writing after his death in 1958, Mary Gilmore declared that he was Australia&#x27;s &quot;most outstanding poet&quot;, that his poetry &quot;came diamond-like in its perfection of form&quot;. &quot;Nothing was too small or too great to attract him,&quot; she wrote, adding that &quot;no matter how swallow-like he skims a surface, the deeps are below; he never wrote the shallow.&quot; However, he has not retained his critical standing, and is now esteemed mostly as the poet who first offered &quot;an alternative to the balladry that had dominated Australian poetry&quot;. Judith Wright called him &quot;a singer, not a thinker, [who] freed the notion of poetry from the portentousness of the Nationalist and radical schools&quot;.

After McCrae married Nancy Adams in Melbourne in May 1901, they moved at once to Sydney. They had three daughters. She died in 1943. He married Janet Le Brun in July 1946, but their marriage was dissolved in 1948.
McCrae died in 1958, Mary Gilmore wrote a farewell poem.

<text>Kathrynne Ann Whitworth (September 27, 1939 – December 24, 2022) was an American professional golfer. During her playing career she won 88 LPGA Tour tournaments, more than anyone else on the LPGA or PGA Tours. Whitworth was also a runner-up 93 times, giving her 181 top-two finishes. In 1981, she became the first woman to reach career earnings of $1 million on the LPGA Tour. She is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame.

==Early life and amateur career==
Whitworth was born on September 27, 1939, in Monahans, Texas, the youngest of three daughters of Morris Whitworth, a hardware store owner and later mayor in Jal, New Mexico, where she grew up. She attended Odessa College.

Initially a tennis player, Whitworth began playing golf at 14. After working with Hardy Loudermilk, she won the 1957 and 1958 New Mexico State Amateur Championships. At 19, she changed coaches to Harvey Penick and turned pro, joining the LPGA in December 1958.

==Professional career==
In 1962, Whitworth won her first tournament, the Kelly Girls Open. Between that and her victory in the United Virginia Bank Classic in 1985, she won 88 tournaments on the LPGA Tour, the highest number of any player in the history of professional golf, including on the men&#x27;s PGA Tour. Six were major championships. In 1974, she won the Orange Blossom Classic for the fifth time, one of only four LPGA golfers to have won the same tournament five times. She was the U.S. team captain at the inaugural Solheim Cup match in 1990. She was the first LPGA player to earn $1 million, in 1981.

Whitworth was LPGA Player of the Year seven times between 1966 and 1973, won the Vare Trophy for best scoring average by an LPGA Tour player a record seven times between 1965 and 1972, and was inducted into the LPGA Hall of Fame in 1975 and into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1982. She was named Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year in 1965 and 1967. She was Named &quot;Golfer of the Decade&quot; by &quot;Golf Magazine&quot; for the years 1968 to 1977 during the 1988 Centennial of Golf in America celebration. She received the 1986 William Richardson Award from the Golf Writers Association of America for consistent outstanding contributions to golf. She is also a member of the New Mexico Hall of Fame, Texas Sports Hall of Fame, Texas Golf Hall of Fame, and the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation Hall of Fame.

==Later life and death==
Whitworth retired from competitive golf in 2005 after competing in the BJ&#x27;s Charity Classic on the Women&#x27;s Senior Golf Tour. In 2007, with Jay Golden, she published &quot;Kathy Whitworth&#x27;s Little Book of Golf Wisdom&quot;. At the time of her death she lived in Flower Mound, Texas with her partner, Bettye Odle. She died in Flower Mound on December 24, 2022, at age 83, after collapsing while attending a neighbor&#x27;s Christmas party.

<text>Roto-Rooter Plumbing &amp; Water Cleanup (formerly called Roto-Rooter Plumbing &amp; Drain Service) is a plumbing company based in Cincinnati, Ohio. The company, founded in 1935, originally specialized in clearing tree roots and other obstructions from sewer lines.

, it employs thousands of plumbers, and service technicians throughout the US and Canada who provide plumbing and sewer and water damage cleanup services. Roto-Rooter also employs manufacturing technicians and assembly workers at its manufacturing plant in West Des Moines, Iowa. The plant manufactures the company&#x27;s patented, proprietary Roto-Rooter sewer and drain cleaning machines as well as sewer and drain cleaning cables and blades. Roto-Rooter is one of the two subsidiary divisions of the publicly traded Chemed Corporation, of which the other one is a hospice care provider VITAS Healthcare.

== Early years ==

In the late 1920s, Samuel Oscar Blanc (1883–1964) was cleaning a blocked sewer at his son&#x27;s (Milton L. Blanc) Des Moines, Iowa, apartment to seek a better solution than digging up the sewer line to remove tree roots that had invaded the underground sewer pipe.

By 1933, Samuel Blanc had fashioned a sewer-cleaning machine from a washing machine motor, wheels from a child&#x27;s little red wagon, and a 3/8&quot; steel cable. The cable rotated with a sharp C-shaped blade attached to the tip. The rotating motion cut tree roots out of sewer lines, eliminating the need to dig up pipes and clear obstructions by hand, thus inventing the world&#x27;s first heavy-duty plumber&#x27;s Snake. Blanc&#x27;s wife, Lettie (née Lettie Jensen), called his invention the &quot;Roto-Rooter&quot;.

By the mid-1930s, Blanc was selling his patented &quot;Roto-Rooter&quot; machines for $250 and incorporated a business around it called Roto-Rooter Corporation. Many in need during the Great Depression started their own Roto-Rooter businesses throughout the upper Midwest, the Great Plains, and the Northeast. Roto-Rooter&#x27;s sewer cleaning service allowed homeowners to avoid digging up lawns and landscaping to reach underground sewer pipes. This breakthrough was a revolutionary concept. In the 1930s and 40s, Roto-Rooter featured an illustration of a mound of dirt over a recently excavated sewer pipe with the caption, &quot;Why put a grave in your yard?&quot;

In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and built a smaller model that operated on the same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10-horsepower gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called &quot;The Mainliner&quot; was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.

== Selling of the company ==
In 1980, the Blanc family sold Roto-Rooter Corporation to Cincinnati-based Chemed Corporation. Chemed began purchasing independent Roto-Rooter franchises and operating them as company-owned service locations under the newly formed Roto-Rooter Services Company, whose corporate headquarters is in downtown Cincinnati. Chemed sold off some of its holdings in Roto-Rooter in both 1984 and 1985, bringing its ownership stake to just below 60%, but launched a bid in 1996 to reacquire the 42% of shares that it had sold off.

In the 1980s, some Roto-Rooter franchises and company-owned locations began to offer around-the-clock service and general full-service plumbing repair for both residential and commercial customers. Roto-Rooter&#x27;s plumbing services represent a major part of the company&#x27;s business. The company has more than 600 service locations operating throughout North America that serve more than 90% of the US population in all fifty states, and more than 40% of the Canadian population. Roto-Rooter is the largest provider of plumbing repair and sewer and drain cleaning services in both countries.

International franchise operations have been established in Canada, Japan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia.

==Corporate identity==
===Original logo===
For the first five years of Roto-Rooter&#x27;s existence (1935-1940), the company had no official logo and allowed its franchisees to paint their trucks however they saw fit. Due to copycat imitators, Roto-Rooter unveiled the first official Roto-Rooter logo in November 1940. The logo featured the patented Roto-Rooter electric sewer cleaning machine inside of an outline of the United States proclaiming, &quot;A Specialized Service From Coast-to-Coast&quot;. The new emblem was used on service vehicles, on guarantees, and in all advertising to help homeowners select the original Roto-Rooter.

===1953-1979===
In 1953, Roto-Rooter updated the logo to a much simpler design which incorporated a new black and white font with “SEWER-DRAIN SERVICE” inside a drainpipe. This logo was used from 1953 through the 1970s. The only update made to this design was switching out the black outline to a blue outline.

===1980-1995===
By 1980, Roto-Rooter was in need of an updated logo for its service vans and equipment. The new logo for the 1980s was a refreshed version of the previous logo. The new logo was all blue and eliminated the rightward slant of the previous logo, standing up straight the letters of the Roto-Rooter name. The drainpipe portion was also updated to include more waves.

===1996-present===
In 1996, the Roto-Rooter Visual Identity Program introduced a new logo to replace all previous logos. Variations of this design are still used to this day by Roto-Rooter locations in the United States, Canada, and around the world. The only variation since its introduction was the addition of a single-line logo to complement the over-and-under version. Since the single-line logo uses the same font, it is considered an extension of the other logo.

==Advertising==
===Razor-Kleen!===
In the 1930s and 1940s, Roto-Rooter service vehicles bore the slogan &quot;Roto-Rooter&#x27;s patented cutting blades slice through roots and cut them away ... Razor-Kleen!&quot;

===Away go troubles down the drain===
The Roto-Rooter advertising jingle used today on TV and radio was created in 1954 and has been one of the longest-running and best-remembered musical jingles in history:

Call Roto-Rooter, that&#x27;s the name, and away go troubles down the drain.

The memorable bass voice in the commercial was that of Tom Fouts, more widely known as Captain Stubby of &quot;Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers&quot;.

Many memorable Roto-Rooter TV commercials were introduced over the years that featured the iconic Roto-Rooter advertising jingle, helping to make it a familiar piece of Americana.

In &quot;Mr. Plow&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the jingle for Homer&#x27;s snowplowing business, Mr. Plow, has a melody and lyrics based on Roto-Rooter&#x27;s. Lyrics: &quot;Call Mr. Plow, that&#x27;s my name, that name again is Mr. Plow!&quot;

===We do both!===
In December 2017, Roto-Rooter released a TV commercial that introduced a new slogan, &quot;We Do Both&quot;, to explain to the public that Roto-Rooter does both plumbing repair and water damage cleanup. The commercial, which began airing on television and in targeted internet ads, features a nosy neighbor asking a Roto-Rooter plumber standing at the curb &quot;what are you doing with the Johnsons&#x27; sofa?&quot; The Roto-Rooter plumber explains that the Johnsons had a pipe break that flooded their house and that he had fixed the broken pipe and now Roto-Rooter is &quot;cleaning up the damage&quot;.

===Yeah, We Do That Too!===
As a follow-up to “We Do Both”, in August 2019 Roto-Rooter premiered a sequel slogan campaign titled “We Do That Too” to showcase service options that go beyond the core services of plumbing repair, drain cleaning, and water damage clean-up. The “We Do That Too” campaign highlights the secondary services that Roto-Rooter offers such as pipe inspection, sewer repair, water heater repair, and sump pump replacement.

<text>The transcriptome is the set of all RNA transcripts, including coding and non-coding, in an individual or a population of cells. The term can also sometimes be used to refer to all RNAs, or just mRNA, depending on the particular experiment. The term &quot;transcriptome&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;transcript&quot; and &quot;genome&quot;; it is associated with the process of transcript production during the biological process of transcription.

The early stages of transcriptome annotations began with cDNA libraries published in the 1980s. Subsequently, the advent of high-throughput technology led to faster and more efficient ways of obtaining data about the transcriptome. Two biological techniques are used to study the transcriptome, namely DNA microarray, a hybridization-based technique and RNA-seq, a sequence-based approach. RNA-seq is the preferred method and has been the dominant transcriptomics technique since the 2010s. Single-cell transcriptomics allows tracking of transcript changes over time within individual cells.

Data obtained from the transcriptome is used in research to gain insight into processes such as cellular differentiation, carcinogenesis, transcription regulation and biomarker discovery among others. Transcriptome-obtained data also finds applications in establishing phylogenetic relationships during the process of evolution and in &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization. The transcriptome is closely related to other -ome based biological fields of study; it is complementary to the proteome and the metabolome and encompasses the translatome, exome, meiome and thanatotranscriptome which can be seen as ome fields studying specific types of RNA transcripts. There are quantifiable and conserved relationships between the Transcriptome and other -omes, and Transcriptomics data can be used effectively to predict other molecular species, such as metabolites. There are numerous publicly available transcriptome databases.

==Etymology and history==
The word &quot;transcriptome&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;transcript&quot; and &quot;genome&quot;. It appeared along with other neologisms formed using the suffixes &quot;-ome&quot; and &quot;-omics&quot; to denote all studies conducted on a genome-wide scale in the fields of life sciences and technology. As such, transcriptome and transcriptomics were one of the first words to emerge along with genome and proteome. The first study to present a case of a collection of a cDNA library for silk moth mRNA was published in 1979. The first seminal study to mention and investigate the transcriptome of an organism was published in 1997 and it described 60,633 transcripts expressed in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). With the rise of high-throughput technologies and bioinformatics and the subsequent increased computational power, it became increasingly efficient and easy to characterize and analyze enormous amount of data. Attempts to characterize the transcriptome became more prominent with the advent of automated DNA sequencing during the 1980s. During the 1990s, expressed sequence tag sequencing was used to identify genes and their fragments. This was followed by techniques such as serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE), and massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS).

==Transcription==

The transcriptome encompasses all the ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcripts present in a given organism or experimental sample. RNA is the main carrier of genetic information that is responsible for the process of converting DNA into an organism&#x27;s phenotype. A gene can give rise to a single-stranded messenger RNA (mRNA) through a molecular process known as transcription; this mRNA is complementary to the strand of DNA it originated from. The enzyme RNA polymerase II attaches to the template DNA strand and catalyzes the addition of ribonucleotides to the 3&#x27; end of the growing sequence of the mRNA transcript.

In order to initiate its function, RNA polymerase II needs to recognize a promoter sequence, located upstream (5&#x27;) of the gene. In eukaryotes, this process is mediated by transcription factors, most notably Transcription factor II D (TFIID) which recognizes the TATA box and aids in the positioning of RNA polymerase at the appropriate start site. To finish the production of the RNA transcript, termination takes place usually several hundred nuclecotides away from the termination sequence and cleavage takes place. This process occurs in the nucleus of a cell along with RNA processing by which mRNA molecules are capped, spliced and polyadenylated to increase their stability before being subsequently taken to the cytoplasm. The mRNA gives rise to proteins through the process of translation that takes place in ribosomes.

==Types of RNA transcripts==

Almost all functional transcripts are derived from known genes. The only exceptions are a small number of transcripts that might play a direct role in regulating gene expression near the prompters of known genes. (See Enhancer RNA.)

Gene occupy most of prokaryotic genomes so most of their genomes are transcribed. Many eukaryotic genomes are very large and known genes may take up only a fraction of the genome. In mammals, for example, known genes only account for 40-50% of the genome. Nevertheless, identified transcripts often map to a much larger fraction of the genome suggesting that the transcriptome contains spurious transcripts that do not come from genes. Some of these transcripts are known to be non-functional because they map to transcribed pseudogenes or degenerative transposons and viruses. Others map to unidentified regions of the genome that may be junk DNA.

Spurious transcription is very common in eukaryotes, especially those with large genomes that might contain a lot of junk DNA. Some scientists claim that if a transcript has not been assigned to a known gene then the default assumption must be that it is junk RNA until it has been shown to be functional. This would mean that much of the transcriptome in species with large genomes is probably junk RNA. (See Non-coding RNA)

The transcriptome includes the transcripts of protein-coding genes (mRNA plus introns) as well as the transcripts of non-coding genes (functional RNAs plus introns).

*Ribosomal RNA/rRNA: Usually the most abundant RNA in the transcriptome.
*Long non-coding RNA/lncRNA: Non-coding RNA transcripts that are more than 200 nucleotides long. Members of this group comprise the largest fraction of the non-coding transcriptome other than introns. It is not known how many of these transcripts are functional and how many are junk RNA.
*transfer RNA/tRNA
*micro RNA/miRNA: 19-24 nucleotides (nt) long. Micro RNAs up- or downregulate expression levels of mRNAs by the process of RNA interference at the post-transcriptional level.
*small interfering RNA/siRNA: 20-24 nt
*small nucleolar RNA/snoRNA
*Piwi-interacting RNA/piRNA: 24-31 nt. They interact with Piwi proteins of the Argonaute family and have a function in targeting and cleaving transposons.
*enhancer RNA/eRNA:

==Scope of study==
In the human genome, all genes get transcribed into RNA because that&#x27;s how the molecular gene is defined. (See Gene.) The transcriptome consists of coding regions of mRNA plus non-coding UTRs, introns, non-coding RNAs, and spurious non-functional transcripts.

Several factors render the content of the transcriptome difficult to establish. These include alternative splicing, RNA editing and alternative transcription among others. Additionally, transcriptome techniques are capable of capturing transcription occurring in a sample at a specific time point, although the content of the transcriptome can change during differentiation. The main aims of transcriptomics are the following: &quot;catalogue all species of transcript, including mRNAs, non-coding RNAs and small RNAs; to determine the transcriptional structure of genes, in terms of their start sites, 5′ and 3′ ends, splicing patterns and other post-transcriptional modifications; and to quantify the changing expression levels of each transcript during development and under different conditions&quot;.

The term can be applied to the total set of transcripts in a given organism, or to the specific subset of transcripts present in a particular cell type. Unlike the genome, which is roughly fixed for a given cell line (excluding mutations), the transcriptome can vary with external environmental conditions. Because it includes all mRNA transcripts in the cell, the transcriptome reflects the genes that are being actively expressed at any given time, with the exception of mRNA degradation phenomena such as transcriptional attenuation. The study of transcriptomics, (which includes expression profiling, splice variant analysis etc.), examines the expression level of RNAs in a given cell population, often focusing on mRNA, but sometimes including others such as tRNAs and sRNAs.

==Methods of construction==

Transcriptomics is the quantitative science that encompasses the assignment of a list of strings (&quot;reads&quot;) to the object (&quot;transcripts&quot; in the genome). To calculate the expression strength, the density of reads corresponding to each object is counted. Initially, transcriptomes were analyzed and studied using expressed sequence tags libraries and serial and cap analysis of gene expression (SAGE).

Currently, the two main transcriptomics techniques include DNA microarrays and RNA-Seq. Both techniques require RNA isolation through RNA extraction techniques, followed by its separation from other cellular components and enrichment of mRNA.

There are two general methods of inferring transcriptome sequences. One approach maps sequence reads onto a reference genome, either of the organism itself (whose transcriptome is being studied) or of a closely related species. The other approach, &quot;de novo&quot; transcriptome assembly, uses software to infer transcripts directly from short sequence reads and is used in organisms with genomes that are not sequenced.

=== DNA microarrays ===

The first transcriptome studies were based on microarray techniques (also known as DNA chips). Microarrays consist of thin glass layers with spots on which oligonucleotides, known as &quot;probes&quot; are arrayed; each spot contains a known DNA sequence.

When performing microarray analyses, mRNA is collected from a control and an experimental sample, the latter usually representative of a disease. The RNA of interest is converted to cDNA to increase its stability and marked with fluorophores of two colors, usually green and red, for the two groups. The cDNA is spread onto the surface of the microarray where it hybridizes with oligonucleotides on the chip and a laser is used to scan. The fluorescence intensity on each spot of the microarray corresponds to the level of gene expression and based on the color of the fluorophores selected, it can be determined which of the samples exhibits higher levels of the mRNA of interest.

One microarray usually contains enough oligonucleotides to represent all known genes; however, data obtained using microarrays does not provide information about unknown genes. During the 2010s, microarrays were almost completely replaced by next-generation techniques that are based on DNA sequencing.

===RNA sequencing===

RNA sequencing is a next-generation sequencing technology; as such it requires only a small amount of RNA and no previous knowledge of the genome. It allows for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of RNA transcripts, the former allowing discovery of new transcripts and the latter a measure of relative quantities for transcripts in a sample.

The three main steps of sequencing transcriptomes of any biological samples include RNA purification, the synthesis of an RNA or cDNA library and sequencing the library. The RNA purification process is different for short and long RNAs. This step is usually followed by an assessment of RNA quality, with the purpose of avoiding contaminants such as DNA or technical contaminants related to sample processing. RNA quality is measured using UV spectrometry with an absorbance peak of 260 nm. RNA integrity can also be analyzed quantitatively comparing the ratio and intensity of 28S RNA to 18S RNA reported in the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) score. Since mRNA is the species of interest and it represents only 3% of its total content, the RNA sample should be treated to remove rRNA and tRNA and tissue-specific RNA transcripts.

The step of library preparation with the aim of producing short cDNA fragments, begins with RNA fragmentation to transcripts in length between 50 and 300 base pairs. Fragmentation can be enzymatic (RNA endonucleases), chemical (trismagnesium salt buffer, chemical hydrolysis) or mechanical (sonication, nebulisation). Reverse transcription is used to convert the RNA templates into cDNA and three priming methods can be used to achieve it, including oligo-DT, using random primers or ligating special adaptor oligos.

===Single-cell transcriptomics===

Transcription can also be studied at the level of individual cells by single-cell transcriptomics. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a recently developed technique that allows the analysis of the transcriptome of single cells, including bacteria. With single-cell transcriptomics, subpopulations of cell types that constitute the tissue of interest are also taken into consideration. This approach allows to identify whether changes in experimental samples are due to phenotypic cellular changes as opposed to proliferation, with which a specific cell type might be overexpressed in the sample. Additionally, when assessing cellular progression through differentiation, average expression profiles are only able to order cells by time rather than their stage of development and are consequently unable to show trends in gene expression levels specific to certain stages. Single-cell trarnscriptomic techniques have been used to characterize rare cell populations such as circulating tumor cells, cancer stem cells in solid tumors, and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in mammalian blastocysts.

Although there are no standardized techniques for single-cell transcriptomics, several steps need to be undertaken. The first step includes cell isolation, which can be performed using low- and high-throughput techniques. This is followed by a qPCR step and then single-cell RNAseq where the RNA of interest is converted into cDNA. Newer developments in single-cell transcriptomics allow for tissue and sub-cellular localization preservation through cryo-sectioning thin slices of tissues and sequencing the transcriptome in each slice. Another technique allows the visualization of single transcripts under a microscope while preserving the spatial information of each individual cell where they are expressed.

==Analysis==
A number of organism-specific transcriptome databases have been constructed and annotated to aid in the identification of genes that are differentially expressed in distinct cell populations.

RNA-seq is emerging (2013) as the method of choice for measuring transcriptomes of organisms, though the older technique of DNA microarrays is still used. RNA-seq measures the transcription of a specific gene by converting long RNAs into a library of cDNA fragments. The cDNA fragments are then sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology and aligned to a reference genome or transcriptome which is then used to create an expression profile of the genes.

==Applications==
===Mammals===
The transcriptomes of stem cells and cancer cells are of particular interest to researchers who seek to understand the processes of cellular differentiation and carcinogenesis. A pipeline using RNA-seq or gene array data can be used to track genetic changes occurring in stem and precursor cells and requires at least three independent gene expression data from the former cell type and mature cells.

Analysis of the transcriptomes of human oocytes and embryos is used to understand the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways controlling early embryonic development, and could theoretically be a powerful tool in making proper embryo selection in in vitro fertilisation. Analyses of the transcriptome content of the placenta in the first-trimester of pregnancy in &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization and embryo transfer (IVT-ET) revealed differences in genetic expression which are associated with higher frequency of adverse perinatal outcomes. Such insight can be used to optimize the practice. Transcriptome analyses can also be used to optimize cryopreservation of oocytes, by lowering injuries associated with the process.

Transcriptomics is an emerging and continually growing field in biomarker discovery for use in assessing the safety of drugs or chemical risk assessment.

Transcriptomes may also be used to infer phylogenetic relationships among individuals or to detect evolutionary patterns of transcriptome conservation.

Transcriptome analyses were used to discover the incidence of antisense transcription, their role in gene expression through interaction with surrounding genes and their abundance in different chromosomes. RNA-seq was also used to show how RNA isoforms, transcripts stemming from the same gene but with different structures, can produce complex phenotypes from limited genomes.

===Plants===
Transcriptome analysis have been used to study the evolution and diversification process of plant species. In 2014, the 1000 Plant Genomes Project was completed in which the transcriptomes of 1,124 plant species from the families viridiplantae, glaucophyta and rhodophyta were sequenced. The protein coding sequences were subsequently compared to infer phylogenetic relationships between plants and to characterize the time of their diversification in the process of evolution. Transcriptome studies have been used to characterize and quantify gene expression in mature pollen. Genes involved in cell wall metabolism and cytoskeleton were found to be overexpressed. Transcriptome approaches also allowed to track changes in gene expression through different developmental stages of pollen, ranging from microspore to mature pollen grains; additionally such stages could be compared across species of different plants including &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, rice and tobacco.

==Relation to other ome fields==

Similar to other -ome based technologies, analysis of the transcriptome allows for an unbiased approach when validating hypotheses experimentally. This approach also allows for the discovery of novel mediators in signaling pathways. As with other -omics based technologies, the transcriptome can be analyzed within the scope of a multiomics approach. It is complementary to metabolomics but contrary to proteomics, a direct association between a transcript and metabolite cannot be established.

There are several -ome fields that can be seen as subcategories of the transcriptome. The exome differs from the transcriptome in that it includes only those RNA molecules found in a specified cell population, and usually includes the amount or concentration of each RNA molecule in addition to the molecular identities. Additionally, the transcritpome also differs from the translatome, which is the set of RNAs undergoing translation.

The term meiome is used in functional genomics to describe the meiotic transcriptome or the set of RNA transcripts produced during the process of meiosis. Meiosis is a key feature of sexually reproducing eukaryotes, and involves the pairing of homologous chromosome, synapse and recombination. Since meiosis in most organisms occurs in a short time period, meiotic transcript profiling is difficult due to the challenge of isolation (or enrichment) of meiotic cells (meiocytes). As with transcriptome analyses, the meiome can be studied at a whole-genome level using large-scale transcriptomic techniques. The meiome has been well-characterized in mammal and yeast systems and somewhat less extensively characterized in plants.

The thanatotranscriptome consists of all RNA transcripts that continue to be expressed or that start getting re-expressed in internal organs of a dead body 24–48 hours following death. Some genes include those that are inhibited after fetal development. If the thanatotranscriptome is related to the process of programmed cell death (apoptosis), it can be referred to as the apoptotic thanatotranscriptome. Analyses of the thanatotranscriptome are used in forensic medicine.

eQTL mapping can be used to complement genomics with transcriptomics; genetic variants at DNA level and gene expression measures at RNA level.

===Relation to proteome===

The transcriptome can be seen as a subset of the proteome, that is, the entire set of proteins expressed by a genome.

However, the analysis of relative mRNA expression levels can be complicated by the fact that relatively small changes in mRNA expression can produce large changes in the total amount of the corresponding protein present in the cell. One analysis method, known as gene set enrichment analysis, identifies coregulated gene networks rather than individual genes that are up- or down-regulated in different cell populations.

Although microarray studies can reveal the relative amounts of different mRNAs in the cell, levels of mRNA are not directly proportional to the expression level of the proteins they code for. The number of protein molecules synthesized using a given mRNA molecule as a template is highly dependent on translation-initiation features of the mRNA sequence; in particular, the ability of the translation initiation sequence is a key determinant in the recruiting of ribosomes for protein translation.

<text>wxPython is a wrapper for the cross-platform GUI API (often referred to as a &quot;toolkit&quot;) wxWidgets (which is written in C++) for the Python programming language. It is one of the alternatives to Tkinter. It is implemented as a Python extension module (native code).

==History==
In 1995, Robin Dunn needed a GUI application to be deployed on HP-UX systems but also run Windows 3.1 within short time frame. He needed a cross-platform solution. While evaluating free and commercial solutions, he ran across Python bindings on the wxWidgets toolkit webpage (known as wxWindows at the time). This was Dunn&#x27;s introduction to Python. Together with Harri Pasanen and Edward Zimmerman he developed those initial bindings into wxPython 0.2.

In August 1998, version 0.3 of wxPython was released. It was built for wxWidgets 2.0 and ran on Win32, with a wxGTK version in the works.

The first versions of the wrapper were created by hand. However, the code became difficult to maintain and keep synchronized with wxWidgets releases. By 1997, versions were created with SWIG, greatly decreasing the amount of work to update the wrapper.

=== Project Phoenix ===
In 2010, the Project Phoenix began; an effort to clean up the wxPython implementation and in the process make it compatible with Python 3. The project is a new implementation of wxPython, focused on improving speed, maintainability and extensibility. Like the previous version of wxPython, it wraps the wxWidgets C++ toolkit and provides access to the user interface portions of the wxWidgets API.

With the release of 4.0.0a1 wxPython in 2017, the Project Phoenix version became the official version. wxPython 4.x is the current version being developed as of June 2022.

== Use ==
wxPython enables Python to be used for cross-platform GUI applications requiring very little, if any, platform-specific code.

=== Example ===

This is a simple &quot;Hello world&quot; module, depicting the creation of the two main objects in wxPython (the main window object and the application object), followed by passing the control to the event-driven system (by calling codice_1) which manages the user-interactive part of the program.
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import wx

app = wx.App(False) # Create a new app, don&#x27;t redirect stdout/stderr to a window.
frame = wx.Frame(None, title=&quot;Hello World&quot;) # A Frame is a top-level window.
frame.Show(True) # Show the frame.
app.MainLoop()

This is another example of the wxPython Close Button with wxPython GUI display show in Windows 10 operating system.
import wx

class WxButton(wx.Frame):

 def __init__(self, *args, **kw):
 super(WxButton, self).__init__(*args, **kw)
 self.InitUI()

 def InitUI(self):
 pnl = wx.Panel(self)
 closeButton = wx.Button(pnl, label=&#x27;Close Me&#x27;, pos=(20, 20))

 closeButton.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.OnClose)

 self.SetSize((350, 250))
 self.SetTitle(&#x27;Close Button&#x27;)
 self.Centre()

 def OnClose(self, e):
 self.Close(True)

def main():
 app = wx.App()
 ex = WxButton(None)
 ex.Show()
 app.MainLoop()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
 main()

<doc id="1075082" wikidata="Q788563" url="?curid=1075082" title="Kenneth Slessor">
<text>Kenneth Adolphe Slessor (27 March 190130 June 1971) was an Australian poet, journalist and official war correspondent in World War II. He was one of Australia&#x27;s leading poets, notable particularly for the absorption of modernist influences into Australian poetry. The Kenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry is named after him.

==Early life==
Slessor was born Kenneth Adolphe Schloesser in Orange, New South Wales. As a boy, he lived in England with his parents until 1903, when the family moved to Sydney. In Australia he visited the mines of rural New South Wales with his father, a Jewish mining engineer whose father and grandfather had been distinguished musicians in Germany.

His family moved to Sydney in 1903. Slessor attended Mowbray House School (1910–1914) and the Sydney Church of England Grammar School (1915–1918), where he began to write poetry. His first published poem, &quot;Goin&#x27;&quot;, about a wounded digger in Europe, remembering Sydney and its icons, appeared in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; in 1917. Slessor passed the 1918 NSW Leaving Certificate with first-class honours in English and joined the &quot;Sydney Sun&quot; as a journalist. In 1919, seven of his poems were published. He married for the first time in 1922.

==Career==
Slessor made his living as a newspaper journalist, mostly for &quot;The Sun&quot;, and was a war correspondent during World War II (1939–1945). In that capacity, he reported not only from Australia but from Greece, Syria, Libya, Egypt, and New Guinea.

Slessor also wrote on rugby league football for the popular publication &quot;Smith&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

The bulk of Slessor&#x27;s poetic work was produced before the end of World War II. His poem &quot;Five Bells&quot;—relating to Sydney Harbour, time, the past, memory, and the death of the artist, friend and colleague of Slessor at &quot;Smith&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, Joe Lynch—remains probably his best known poem, followed by &quot;Beach Burial&quot;, a tribute to Australian troops who fought in World War II.

In 1965, Australian writer Hal Porter wrote of having met and stayed with Slessor in the 1930s. He described Slessor as:
...a city lover, fastidious and excessively courteous, in those qualities resembles Baudelaire, as he does in being incapable of sentimentalizing over vegetation, in finding in nature something cruel, something bordering on effrontery. He prefers chiselled stone to the disorganization of grass.

Ronald McCuaig was the first to produce an in-depth review of Kenneth Slessor (in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; in August 1939 and republished in &quot;Tales out of bed&quot; (1944)). The review was favourable, ranking Slessor above C.J. Brennan and W.B. Yeats. It was written a year before &quot;Five Bells&quot;, which marked Slessor&#x27;s move to modernism, a move inspired, according to Rundle and others, by McCuaig. The review therefore covers the pre-modernist parts of Slessor&#x27;s poetry.

According to poet Douglas Stewart, Kenneth Slessor&#x27;s poem &quot;Five Visions of Captain Cook&quot; is equally as important as &quot;Five Bells&quot; and was the &#x27;most dramatic break-through&#x27; in Australian poetry of the twentieth century.

In 1944 he published his definitive volume of poetry, &quot;One Hundred Poems&quot;, and from that point on Slessor published only three short poems. Instead of writing poetry, after 1944, and for the rest of his life, Slessor chose to concentrate on journalism and supporting literary projects whose aim was to help develop Australian poetry.

Slessor was a member of The Journalists&#x27; Club Sydney and served as its Vice-President 1940–1957, then as its President 1957–1965. A portrait of Slessor was painted by fellow Journalists&#x27; Club member William Pidgeon, who painted the portraits of practically every club president up to 1976.

==Awards==
In the 1959 New Year Honours, Slessor was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to literature.

==Personal life==
Slessor counted Norman Lindsay, Hugh McCrae and Jack Lindsay among his friends.

At the age of 21, Slessor married 28-year-old Noëla Beatrice Myer Ewart Glasson (born 25 December 1893) in Ashfield, Sydney, on 18 August 1922. Noëla was the daughter of Australian soprano and music composer Annie May Colette Summerbelle (1867–1949) and Herbert Edward Glasson (1867–1893). She never knew her father who was executed at the Bathurst Gaol on 29 November 1893, a month before her birth, after he was found guilty of a double—almost quadruple—murder of 24 September 1893. Noëla died of cancer on 22 October 1945.

He married Pauline Wallace in 1951; and a year later celebrated the birth of his only child, Paul Slessor, before the marriage dissolved in 1961.

He died suddenly of a heart attack on 30 June 1971 at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, North Sydney. His ashes are interred in Rookwood Cemetery.

<text>(formerly &quot;Aster novae-angliae&quot;) is a species of flowering plant in the aster family (Asteraceae) native to central and eastern North America. Commonly known as , , or , it is a perennial, herbaceous plant usually between tall and wide.

The usually deep purple flowers have up to 100 ray florets which are rarely pink or white. These surround the flower centers which are composed of just as many tiny yellow disk florets. The plant grows naturally in clumps, with several erect stems emerging from a single point. The stems are stout, hairy, and mostly unbranched. The untoothed, lance-shaped leaves clasp the stem with earlobe-like appendages, and the lower stem leaves often wither by the time of flowering.

New England aster generally grows in wet environments but also has been found in dry soil or sand. The seeds and nectar of this mostly conservationally secure species, which blooms August to November, are important to a wide variety of animals, including birds, bees, and butterflies. It has been introduced to Europe, Central Asia, Hispaniola, New Zealand, and some western states and provinces of North America.

The naturally-occurring hybrid species of New England aster and white heath aster (&quot;Symphyotrichum ericoides&quot;) is named &quot;Symphyotrichum&quot; × &quot;amethystinum&quot; and is commonly known as amethyst aster. It can grow where the two parents are in close proximity. There are roughly 50 cultivars of &quot;Symphyotrichum novae-angliae&quot; available, including the award-winners &#x27;Brunswick&#x27;, &#x27;Helen Picton&#x27;, and &#x27;James Ritchie&#x27;. It has been used by indigenous Americans, such as the Cherokee, Iroquois, and Potawatomi, to heal multiple ailments.

==Description==
New England aster is a clump-forming perennial and herbaceous plant. Usually it is between tall and wide. Sometimes it can reach heights of . It is cespitose, growing in clumps with several erect stems emerging from a single point. The stems are stout and mostly unbranched. The upper stems and leaves, along with some parts of the flower heads, are covered with tiny glands on tiny stalks called &quot;stipitate glands&quot;.

===Roots, stems, and leaves===
The roots either come from caudices or short rhizomes and are thick, appearing woody, sometimes with cormoid portions. There are usually from one to five strong, erect, hairy stems growing from the root base. These can be brown or purplish in color, and largely stipitate-glandular higher up.
&quot;Symphyotrichum novae-angliae&quot; has light to dark green, thin, and often stiff alternate and simple leaves. These occur at the base, on stems, and on the flower head branches which all have generally the same lanceolate appearance regardless of their location on the plant. The exception to this is the basal (ground level) leaves, which are usually spatulate or sometimes oblanceolate in shape. The lower stem leaves often wither or drop by the time the plant flowers.

The leaf margins are sometimes entire, meaning they are smooth on the edges with no teeth or lobes, or ciliate, meaning fringed with fine hairs on their edges. They are sessile, having no leafstalk, and they are auriculate, clasping the stem with earlobe-like appendages.

The leaves can vary in size, with the basal and distal (highest) leaves usually smaller than those occurring mid-stem. The basal leaves are sparsely hirsute and range in length and in length. Stem leaves are generally lanceolate or oblong with pointed tips and have stipitate glands on both sides. They average in length by wide. The distal leaves are oblanceolate, also stipitate-glandular, and softly-pubescent. Distal leaves range in length by wide.

===Flowers===
&quot;Symphyotrichum novae-angliae&quot; is a late-summer and fall blooming perennial with flower heads opening as early as August in some locations and as late as November in others. The inflorescences grow in paniculo-corymbiform arrays, also called &quot;cymose corymbs&quot;. These inflorescences have many leaves and are quite crowded, typically with one head at the end of each small branch. Each open flower head can be up to () in diameter.

====Involucres and phyllaries====
On the outside the flower heads of all members of the family Asteraceae are small specialized leaves called &quot;phyllaries&quot;, and together they form the involucre that protects the individual flowers in the head before they open. The involucres of &quot;S. novae-angliae&quot; are campanulate (bell-shaped) to hemispheric (half-spherical) and usually , with low and high involucral measurements of and , respectively. The phyllaries are spreading and often reflexed and are covered with stipitate glands. They are in (sometimes up to 6) somewhat equal rows.

====Florets====
Each flower head is made up of ray florets and disk florets in about a one to one ratio, with the former accepting pollen before, and longer than, the latter. The ray florets grow in one, two, or multiple series and are usually deep purple, rarely pink or white. They average in length and wide. Ray florets in the &quot;Symphyotrichum&quot; genus are exclusively female, each having a pistil (with style, stigma, and ovary) but no stamen; thus, ray florets accept pollen and each can develop a seed, but they produce no pollen.

The disks have florets that start out as yellow and later turn purple. Each disk floret has an average range of in depth, with low and high measurements of and , respectively. The disk floret is made up of 5 fused petals, collectively called a &quot;corolla&quot;, which opens into 5 lobes. Disk florets in the &quot;Symphyotrichum&quot; genus are androgynous, each with both male (stamen, anthers, and filaments) and female reproductive parts; thus, a disk floret produces pollen and can develop a seed.
===Fruit===

The fruits of &quot;Symphyotrichum novae-angliae&quot; are seeds, not true achenes but cypselae, resembling an achene but surrounded by a calyx sheath. This is true for all members of the Asteraceae family. After pollination, they become dull purple or brown with an oblong or obconic shape, are uncompressed, and are long and wide with 7–10 nerves. They also have tufts of hairs called &quot;pappi&quot; which are tawny or rose-tinged in color and long.

===Chromosomes===
&quot;S. novae-angliae&quot; has a monoploid number (also called &quot;base number&quot;) of five chromosomes The species is diploid with a total chromosome count of 10.

==Taxonomy==
===History and classification===
The species&#x27; basionym (original scientific name) is and it has many taxonomic synonyms. Its name with author citations is &quot;Symphyotrichum novae-angliae&quot; . Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, in 1753, formally described what we know today as &quot;S. novae-angliae&quot;. It is a member of the genus &quot;Symphyotrichum&quot; classified in the subgenus &quot;Virgulus&quot;. It has been placed in section &quot;Grandiflori&quot;, sometimes segregated then within its own subsection &quot;Polyligulae&quot;. It also has been segregated within its own section &quot;Polyliguli&quot;. The cladogram shown follows the circumscription of section &quot;Polyliguli&quot; for the species.


Several varieties and forms have been described, differing in flower color, but these generally are not recognized and are considered taxonomic synonyms of the species. F1 hybridization with &quot;S. ericoides&quot; can occur where the ranges of these two species overlap. Named &quot;Symphyotrichum&quot; × &quot;amethystinum&quot; (amethyst aster), the hybrid is intermediate between the parent species in most respects. No other hybrids with &quot;S. novae-angliae&quot; have been reported.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;Symphyotrichum&quot; has as its root the Greek &quot;symph&quot;, which means &quot;coming together&quot;, and &quot;trichum&quot;, which means &quot;hair&quot;. The species name &quot;novae-angliae&quot; translates to &quot;New England&quot;, and the vernacular name &quot;Michaelmas daisy&quot; derives from the various asters, including this species, that tend to flower around September 29, the Feast of St. Michael.

The species&#x27; former genus, &quot;Aster&quot;, comes from the Ancient Greek word (&quot;astḗr&quot;), meaning &quot;star&quot;, referring to the shape of the flower. The word &quot;aster&quot; was used to describe a star-like flower as early as 1542 in , a book by the German physician and botanist Leonhart Fuchs. An old common name for Astereae species using the suffix &quot;-wort&quot; is &quot;starwort&quot;, also spelled &quot;star-wort&quot; or &quot;star wort&quot;. An early use of this name can be found in the same work by Fuchs as , translated from German literally as &quot;star herb&quot; ( ). The name &quot;star-wort&quot; was in use by Aiton in his 1789 &quot;Hortus Kewensis&quot; for &quot;Aster novae-angliae&quot;. He used the common names &quot;New England cluster&#x27;d star-wort&quot; and &quot;New England panicl&#x27;d star-wort&quot; in this work.

==Distribution and habitat==
===Distribution===
====Native====
New England aster is native to most of the central and northeastern United States and southeastern Canada, from Manitoba south to Louisiana and east to Maine. It is absent from much of the far southeastern United States and from boreal regions in North America. There are isolated populations to the west of the main range, such as in New Mexico and in the Black Hills of South Dakota.

====Introduced====
Due to widespread cultivation, introduced populations are present elsewhere in North America including in Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. It was found in Nova Scotia and considered a possible escapee from cultivation, but , it is categorized as native there. It is considered ephemeral in British Columbia, with recorded sightings in 1993 and 1994 near Vancouver, probably originating from railroad cars and garden waste.

New England aster is widely naturalized throughout most of Europe, in parts of Central Asia, on the island of Hispaniola, and in the island country of New Zealand.

===Habitat===
&quot;S. novae-angliae&quot; is found in a wide variety of open, typically moist habitats, including meadows, prairies, marshes, fens, forest edges, and disturbed anthropogenic sites, such as roadsides and former agricultural fields. In its native habitat, it grows primarily in moist calcareous soils, favoring more marshy-wet sites in the western-most of its range.

It is categorized on the United States National Wetland Plant List (NWPL) with the Wetland indicator status rating of Facultative Wetland (FACW) in all wetland regions, meaning it usually occurs in wetlands, but not out of necessity. For example, in one northern location, the Niagara Peninsula in southern Ontario, it was found to grow in dry and sandy soils. It grows best in soils with a pH of 5–7.

==Ecology==

&quot;Symphyotrichum novae-angliae&quot; has coefficients of conservatism (C-values) in the Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) that range from depending on evaluation region. The higher the C-value, the lower tolerance the species has for disturbance and the greater the likelihood that it is growing in a presettlement natural community. In the Dakotas, for example, &quot;S. novae-angliae&quot; has a C-value of 8, meaning its populations there are found in high-quality remnant natural areas with little environmental degradation but can tolerate some periodic disturbance. In contrast, for the Atlantic coastal pine barrens of Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island, it has been given a C-value of 1, meaning its presence in locations of that ecoregion provides little or no confidence of a remnant habitat.

===Reproduction===
&quot;Symphyotrichum novae-angliae&quot; reproduces sexually via wind-dispersed seeds and asexually (vegetatively) via short rhizomes. The species is largely incapable of self-pollination and requires cross-pollination for seed production. The ray florets of species in the &quot;Symphyotrichum&quot; genus are exclusively female, each having a pistil but no stamen, while disk florets are androgynous, each with both male and female reproductive parts.

===Pollinators and food-seekers===

The seeds of are an important fall and winter food source for songbirds. Further, a wide variety of generalist nectar-feeding insects visit the plant, including butterflies, moths, ants, flies, and bees. It is heavily visited by long-tongued bumblebees, including the golden northern bumble bee (&quot;Bombus fervidus&quot;) and the half-black bumblebee (&quot;Bombus vagans&quot;), and less so by short-tongued species. Some bees will collect pollen in addition to nectar, such as the broad-handed leafcutter bee (&quot;Megachile latimanus&quot;) and Drury&#x27;s long-horned bee (&quot;Melissodes druriellus&quot;).

===Pests and diseases===
====Insects====
A gall midge insect, &quot;Rhopalomyia astericaulis&quot;, produces a stem gall on this species. Leaf-mining insects include beetles (&quot;Sumitrosis inaequalis&quot;, &quot;Systena hudsonias&quot;, and &quot;Microrhopala xerene&quot;) and flies (&quot;Agromyza curvipalpis&quot;, &quot;Agromyza platypera&quot;, &quot;Napomyza lateralis&quot;, and &quot;Phytomyza albiceps&quot;). A butterfly known to feed on New England aster as a caterpillar is the Gorgone checkerspot (&quot;Chlosyne gorgone&quot;). The warty leaf beetle &quot;Exema canadensis&quot; breeds on &quot;S. novae-angliae&quot;.

====Fungi====
Fungi known to affect the species include the mildews &quot;Basidiophora entospora&quot; (downy) and &quot;Erysiphe cichoracearum&quot; (powdery), and a black knot fungus &quot;Gibberidea heliopsidis&quot;. Leaf spot fungi include &quot;Discosphaerina pseudhimantia&quot; and &quot;Placosphaeria haydeni&quot; (both making black spots), as well as &quot;Ramularia asteris&quot;, &quot;R. macrospora&quot;, and &quot;Septoria atropurpurea&quot;, the latter making purple stains. Two rusts have been recorded on &quot;S. novae-angliae&quot;: the brown rust &quot;Puccinia asteris&quot; and the red rust &quot;Coleosporium asterum&quot;.
==Conservation==

, NatureServe listed &quot;S. novae-angliae&quot; as Secure (G5) worldwide. This status was last reviewed on . In individual provinces and states, it is listed as Possibly Extirpated (SX) in Oklahoma; Critically Imperiled (S1) in Saskatchewan, Georgia, South Carolina, and Wyoming; Imperiled (S2) in Colorado; and, Vulnerable (S3) in North Carolina.

==Uses==
===Medicinal===
&quot;Symphyotrichum novae-angliae&quot; has been used for various medicinal purposes. In his 1828 &quot;Medical Flora&quot;, French botanist Constantine Samuel Rafinesque wrote the following about its use to treat skin eruptions, including urushiol-induced contact dermatitis from poison ivy and poison sumac:The &quot;A. novanglia&quot; is employed in decoction internally, with a strong decoction externally, in many eruptive diseases of the skin: it removes also the poisonous state of the skin caused by &quot;Rhus&quot; or Shumac.

Among Indigenous peoples of North America, it has been documented that the Cherokee have made a poultice of the roots for pain, an infusion of the roots for diarrhea, an infusion of the plant for fever, and have sniffed the ooze from the roots for catarrh.

Both the Meskwaki and the Potawatomi have used the plant to revive people: the Meskwaki by smudging, and the Potawatomi through fumigation. The Iroquois have made a decoction of the plant for weak skin and of the roots and leaves for fevers. They have used the plant as a love medicine. Both the Mohawk people and the Iroquois have used an infusion of the whole plant in combination with rhizomes from another plant to treat mothers with intestinal fevers. The Ojibwe have smoked the root in pipes to attract game.

===Gardening===
Over 70 cultivars have been developed, and about 50 were in commerce . The &quot;S. novae-angliae&quot; cultivars grow to between in height, with the notable exception of &#x27;Purple Dome&#x27;, at . Long popular in Europe where it was introduced into cultivation in 1710, New England aster has only more recently become commonly cultivated in North America.

Twelve cultivars have received the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (AGM) , including &#x27;Brunswick&#x27; (bright pink), &#x27;Helen Picton&#x27; (purple), &#x27;James Ritchie&#x27; (deep pink), and &#x27;Rosa Sieger&#x27; (rose-pink).

<doc id="1075092" wikidata="Q1048763" url="?curid=1075092" title="Polyakov action">
<text>In physics, the Polyakov action is an action of the two-dimensional conformal field theory describing the worldsheet of a string in string theory. It was introduced by Stanley Deser and Bruno Zumino and independently by L. Brink, P. Di Vecchia and P. S. Howe in 1976, and has become associated with Alexander Polyakov after he made use of it in quantizing the string in 1981. The action reads:
: formula_1

where formula_2 is the string tension, formula_3 is the metric of the target manifold, formula_4 is the worldsheet metric, formula_5 its inverse, and formula_6 is the determinant of formula_4. The metric signature is chosen such that timelike directions are + and the spacelike directions are −. The spacelike worldsheet coordinate is called formula_8, whereas the timelike worldsheet coordinate is called formula_9. This is also known as the nonlinear sigma model.

The Polyakov action must be supplemented by the Liouville action to describe string fluctuations.

== Global symmetries ==
N.B.: Here, a symmetry is said to be local or global from the two dimensional theory (on the worldsheet) point of view. For example, Lorentz transformations, that are local symmetries of the space-time, are global symmetries of the theory on the worldsheet.

The action is invariant under spacetime translations and infinitesimal Lorentz transformations
where formula_10, and formula_11 is a constant. This forms the Poincaré symmetry of the target manifold.

The invariance under (i) follows since the action formula_12 depends only on the first derivative of formula_13. The proof of the invariance under (ii) is as follows:

: formula_14

== Local symmetries ==

The action is invariant under worldsheet diffeomorphisms (or coordinates transformations) and Weyl transformations.

=== Diffeomorphisms ===
Assume the following transformation:
: formula_15
It transforms the metric tensor in the following way:
: formula_16
One can see that:
: formula_17

One knows that the Jacobian of this transformation is given by
: formula_18
which leads to
: formula_19
and one sees that
: formula_20
Summing up this transformation and relabeling formula_21, we see that the action is invariant.

=== Weyl transformation ===
Assume the Weyl transformation:
: formula_22
then
: formula_23
And finally:
And one can see that the action is invariant under Weyl transformation. If we consider &quot;n&quot;-dimensional (spatially) extended objects whose action is proportional to their worldsheet area/hyperarea, unless &quot;n&quot; = 1, the corresponding Polyakov action would contain another term breaking Weyl symmetry.

One can define the stress–energy tensor:
: formula_24
Let&#x27;s define:
: formula_25
Because of Weyl symmetry, the action does not depend on formula_26:
: formula_27
where we&#x27;ve used the functional derivative chain rule.

== Relation with Nambu–Goto action ==

Writing the Euler–Lagrange equation for the metric tensor formula_28 one obtains that
: formula_29
Knowing also that:
: formula_30
One can write the variational derivative of the action:
: formula_31
where formula_32, which leads to
: formula_33

If the auxiliary worldsheet metric tensor formula_34 is calculated from the equations of motion:
: formula_35
and substituted back to the action, it becomes the Nambu–Goto action:
: formula_36

However, the Polyakov action is more easily quantized because it is linear.

== Equations of motion ==

Using diffeomorphisms and Weyl transformation, with a Minkowskian target space, one can make the physically insignificant transformation formula_37, thus writing the action in the &quot;conformal gauge&quot;:
: formula_38
where formula_39.

Keeping in mind that formula_40 one can derive the constraints:
: formula_41

Substituting formula_42, one obtains
: formula_43

And consequently
: formula_44

The boundary conditions to satisfy the second part of the variation of the action are as follows.
* Closed strings:
*: Periodic boundary conditions: formula_45
* Open strings:
Working in light-cone coordinates formula_46, we can rewrite the equations of motion as

: formula_47

Thus, the solution can be written as formula_48, and the stress-energy tensor is now diagonal. By Fourier-expanding the solution and imposing canonical commutation relations on the coefficients, applying the second equation of motion motivates the definition of the Virasoro operators and lead to the Virasoro constraints that vanish when acting on physical states.

<doc id="1075095" wikidata="Q3454294" url="?curid=1075095" title="Scoring in Mahjong">
<text>Scoring in Mahjong, a game for four players that originated in China, involves the players obtaining points for their hand of tiles, then paying each other based on the differences in their score and who obtained mahjong (won the hand). The points are given a monetary value agreed by the players. Although in many variations scoreless hands (推倒胡 &quot;tui dao hu&quot; in Mandarin, 雞糊 &quot;gai wu&quot; in Cantonese) are possible, many require that hands be of some point value in order to win the round.

While the basic gameplay is more or less the same throughout mahjong, the most significant divergence between variations lies in the scoring systems. Like the gameplay, there is a generalized system of scoring, based on the method of winning and the winning hand, from which Chinese and Japanese (among notable systems) base their roots. American mahjong generally has wildly divergent scoring rules (as well

Because of the large differences between the various scoring systems (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often need to agree on particular scoring rules before a game to eliminate possible disputes during the game. As with the gameplay, many attempts have been made to create an international scoring standard, but most are not widely accepted.

== Criteria ==


Points are obtained for a hand by matching it against various criteria, with different criteria scoring different values. Criteria can include particular melds or other tiles held, how the (winning) hand was completed, possession of various special combinations, etc. Some of these criteria may be subsets of other criteria (for example, having a meld of one dragon versus having a meld of all of them), and in these cases, only the criteria with the tighter requirements is scored. The points obtained may be translated into scores for each player using some (typically exponential) function. When gambling with mahjong, these scores are typically directly translated into sums of money paid between players.

The terminology of &quot;point&quot; differs from variation to variation. A common English term is &quot;double&quot;, as the point-to-score translation is typically exponential with a base of 2. (This is not to be confused with the doubling applied to the basic point score in some variations.) Chinese variants will use the term 翻 (pinyin: &quot;fan&quot;, literal meaning: &quot;double&quot;). Taiwanese mahjong, however, uses the term 台 (pinyin: &quot;tái&quot;) along with a linear scoring system.

&quot;Points&quot; and &quot;score&quot; relate to two distinct concepts - based on the points obtained in a round, and other factors, players pay each other money. Chips or similar tokens can be used instead, or a score can simply be calculated.

Each player begins the game with the same score. When settling up, in many cases only the winner is paid with the winner&#x27;s gain being deducted from the three losers&#x27; scores (that is, the losers pay the winner). However, payment between players can be arranged in other ways. A common set of modifiers (for which this article will call the &quot;standard payment variations&quot;) include:
* In the case where a player wins by a discard (a player &quot;picks off&quot; an opponent), the player who performs the discard pays double
* In the case where a player wins by a draw (a player wins by &quot;self-pick&quot;), every losing player pays double.
* In the case where a player wins from a high-risk scenario (see below), the player who performs the discard pays for the other two losing players (in addition to the normal double share).

If playing with chips, there is no universal rule for the situation when a player runs out. In some circles, the match is immediately aborted, with the player furthest ahead in score declared the winner, while in others, a player out of chips continues to play without risk of further losses. Alternatively, the loser may pay cash to buy back chips from the winners and the game continues.

The rules mentioned below are by no means exhaustive or common to every variation, but are common to many 13-tile and 16-tile variations.

== Scoring rules ==

=== Hong Kong scoring ===
In the traditional Hong Kong scoring system or the Cantonese scoring system, scoring tends to be low due to the few criteria used.

The general scoring modifiers apply (see above), with the point translation function being a piecewise function: a constant amount is given for scoreless hands, and the score is doubled for each point (that is, an exponential function). Because zero-point hands are common, players often play with the additional restriction that a winning hand must be of some point value, often anywhere between one and five points, with three being the most common.

=== Chinese Classical scoring ===

Scoring in the Chinese Classical system, from which the Babcock system is derived, proceeds as follows. When one player has won the hand by obtaining mahjong
* each player adds up basic points for their hand based on possession of certain melds, pairs and bonus tiles
* winner adds additional basic points for obtaining mahjong, and possibly for completing their hand in various special ways (for example, getting their last tile from the wall)
* each player doubles their basic points one or more times based on possession of certain rarer melds or combinations of melds (for example a set of the prevailing wind tiles)
* winner doubles their basic points one or more times based on their hand forming certain rarer patterns (for example, composed entirely of honour tiles) or being completed in a special way (for example, robbing an exposed kong)

The winner collects their total points from each of the three losers. The losers pay each other the difference in their points. East pays or receives double amounts in their transactions.

Various &quot;Special Limit&quot; hands exist which, if obtained (which is unlikely), give the holder the maximum permitted amount (the limit) of points for their hand.

=== Taiwanese scoring ===
Unlike Hong Kong scoring, Taiwanese scoring employs a linear relationship between &quot;tai&quot; (台) (points in the Taiwanese system) and chips. When a win occurs in Taiwanese Mahjong, the number of &quot;tai&quot; of the winning hand is multiplied by a factor and then added to a base score. For example, if the base and factor are 3 and 2, respectively, then the loser to a 5-&quot;tai&quot; hand pays the winner 13 (3+2×5).

The Taiwanese system follows a different payment procedure from the standard procedure mentioned earlier:
* In the case where a player wins by a discard (a player &quot;picks off&quot; an opponent), the player who performs the discard pays each winner (there may be more than one).
* In the case where a player wins by a draw (a player wins by &quot;self-pick&quot;), each player except the winner pays the winner.

When the dealer is involved in either the winning or losing side of a hand, extra &quot;tai&quot; (one plus twice the number of times the dealer has consecutively retained the dealership) are added to the dealer&#x27;s winnings or losses.

=== Shanghai scoring ===
In contrast, the scoring system used in the Shanghai variant is high due to the diverse number of scoring criteria and inflated values for rarer hands such as the &quot;thirteen terminals&quot;. Because of the inflated point values, there is generally a minimum point value in the Shanghai variant.

=== Singaporean scoring ===

Singaporean scoring is similar to that of the Chinese Classical system but accounts for the different set of tiles used therein. Again, standard payment variations apply, although variants exist where the dealer must also pay and receive double.

===Japanese scoring===
The Japanese scoring system is the system that is found in many Mahjong video games. In this variation, each player begin with a start score. Usually, this number is either 25,000 or 30,000. However, it can be any agreed start value. In real tile settings, this is typically represented by a series of bars resembling elongated Chinese dominoes, in four denominations: 10,000, 5,000, 1,000, and 100. Otherwise, online the representation is simply the displayed point scores.

=== American scoring ===
A side effect of the Babcock scoring system in the 1920s was that many players frequently sought after limit hands rather than hands of smaller value. Because of this, the common hands were eventually abandoned, and the only way one could win was to match a hand from a list of hands.

Today, in the American variations, players use a card that defines a small set of hands that are the only valid winning hands, with a point value given for each hand. This system is used by the two major governing bodies of Mahjong in the United States, the National Mah Jongg League and the American Mah-Jongg Association, with new cards that define the valid winning hands released annually.

Typically, each card contains scoring criteria that make references to the year the scoring cards are released. For example, the 1985 scoring hand will have hands containing &quot;melds&quot; of a one, nine, eight, and five of a certain suit.

== Scoring limits ==
Some variations may impose a scoring limit - a maximum to the number of points for a given hand. In many cases where limits exist, there may be either multiple limits, or ways to obtain multiples of a limit. In many cases where limits exist, the typical point translation function is exponential, where a constant score is assigned to points up to the first limit, and afterwards increases (often doubles) as further limits are reached. The Taiwanese system does not employ scoring limits.

A scoring limit may be more of a gambling incentive: for example, if six and nine points were scoring limits, a seven- or eight-point hand would be worth the same as a six-point hand, which may be an incentive for players to go for nine-point hands.

== High-risk discards ==
Many variations may also impose penalties for discards that are considered to be &quot;high-risk&quot; when the size of the wall is winding down. If a player wins from a high-risk discard, or goes out self-drawn after claiming a high-risk discard, the player(s) who made the high-risk discard(s) have to pay for the winner&#x27;s points, and the other players are off the hook. A discard is considered risky if there were enough open melds to reveal the fact that said discard is very likely to enable completing a limit hand before it was claimed. Note that some rulesets always make the discarder pay anyway. In this case, going out self-drawn after claiming a risky discard will trigger the penalty. The intent of these rules is to punish the player who foolishly enabled the completion of the limit hand.

<text>Frank A. Silva (October 31, 1950 – September 13, 1995) was an American set dresser and occasional actor best known for his performance as the evil spirit Bob in the TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

Silva had a degree in lighting design from San Francisco State University and worked as a prop master and set decorator on several films including David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;.

Silva worked on Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. According to David Lynch on the 2007 Gold Edition DVD release of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Lynch was upstairs in the Laura Palmer house, near Silva as he worked, and suddenly realized that Silva might have a place in the show. He asked Silva if he was an actor, and Silva said that he was. Lynch then shot a scene where Silva was crouched at the foot of Laura Palmer&#x27;s bed, staring at the camera, with no idea of where it would fit into the show. Later, while shooting a scene where Laura&#x27;s mother is remembering a traumatic event, camera operator Sean Doyle told Lynch they&#x27;d have to repeat the scene because a crew member had accidentally been caught in a reflection. Lynch asked who, and Doyle told him it was Silva. Seeing this as a sign, Lynch decided to keep the shot as it was. Thus was born the character of BOB, a dark spirit who haunts Laura. Silva appeared occasionally as BOB for the remainder of the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; series and in the 1992 movie &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;. His first major appearance was in the International Version of the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; pilot, which contained a standalone ending that resolved the mystery of the series and incorporated the accidental footage.

Silva appears in the Anthrax video &quot;Only&quot;.

After the period of lacking of acting work, subsequent depression and homelessness, Frank Silva died on September 13, 1995, aged 44 from AIDS-related complications, in his friends&#x27; apartment in Seattle. The second episode of the revived &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was dedicated to Silva, and he appeared throughout the revival as Bob through use of archival footage.

<doc id="1075099" wikidata="Q4064242" url="?curid=1075099" title="American Enlightenment">
<text>The American Enlightenment was a period of intellectual and philosophical fervor in the thirteen American colonies in the 18th to 19th century, which led to the American Revolution and the creation of the United States. The American Enlightenment was influenced by the 17th- and 18th-century Age of Enlightenment in Europe and distinctive American philosophy. According to James MacGregor Burns, the spirit of the American Enlightenment was to give Enlightenment ideals a practical, useful form in the life of the nation and its people.

A non-denominational moral philosophy replaced theology in many college curricula. Some colleges reformed their curricula to include natural philosophy (science), modern astronomy, and mathematics, and &quot;new-model&quot; American-style colleges were founded. Politically, the age is distinguished by an emphasis upon consent of the governed, equality under the law, liberty, republicanism and religious tolerance, as clearly expressed in the United States Declaration of Independence.

Among the foremost representatives of the American Enlightenment were presidents of colleges, including Puritan religious leaders Jonathan Edwards, Thomas Clap, and Ezra Stiles, Presbyterian minister and college president John Witherspoon, and Anglican moral philosophers Samuel Johnson and William Smith. Leading political thinkers were John Adams, James Madison, Thomas Paine, George Mason, James Wilson, Ethan Allen, and Alexander Hamilton, and polymaths Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson.

The term &quot;American Enlightenment&quot; was coined in the post-World War II era and was not used in the 18th century when English speakers commonly referred to a process of becoming &quot;enlightened.&quot;

==Dates==
Various dates for the American Enlightenment have been proposed, including 1750–1820, 1765–1815, and 1688–1815. One more precise start date proposed is 1714, when a collection of Enlightenment books by Jeremiah Dummer were donated to the library of the college of Yale University in Connecticut. They were received by a post-graduate student Samuel Johnson, who studied them. He found that they contradicted his Puritan learning. He wrote that, &quot;All this was like a flood of day to his low state of mind&quot;, and that he found himself as if &quot;emerging out of the glimmer of twilight into the full sunshine of open day&quot;. Two years later in 1716 as a tutor, Johnson introduced a new curriculum into Yale using Dummer&#x27;s donated Enlightenment books. Johnson offered what he called &quot;The New Learning&quot;, which included the works and ideas of Francis Bacon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle, Copernicus, and literary works by Shakespeare, John Milton, and Joseph Addison. Enlightenment ideas were introduced to the colonists and diffused through Dissenter educational and religious networks in America.

==Religious tolerance==
Enlightened Founding Fathers, especially Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and George Washington, fought for and eventually attained religious freedom for minority denominations. According to the Founding Fathers, the United States should be a country where peoples of all faiths could live in peace and mutual benefit. Madison summed up this ideal in 1792 saying, &quot;Conscience is the most sacred of all property.&quot;

A switch away from established religion to religious tolerance was one of the distinguishing features of the era from 1775 to 1818. The ratification of the Connecticut Constitution in 1818 has been proposed as a date for the triumph if not the end of the American Enlightenment. That new constitution overturned the 180-year-old &quot;Standing Order&quot; and The Connecticut Charter of 1662, whose provisions dated back to the founding of the state in 1638 and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. The new constitution guaranteed freedom of religion and disestablished the Congregational church.

==Intellectual currents==

Concepts of freedom and modern democratic ideals were born in &quot;Native American wigwams” and found permanence in Voltaire&#x27;s Huron.

Between 1714 and 1818, an intellectual change took place in the Thirteen Colonies that changed them from a largely distant backwater into a leader in various fields, moral philosophy, educational reform, religious revival, industrial technology, science, and, most notably, political philosophy, the roots of this change were homegrown. America saw a consensus on a &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; based political structure based in large part on Native sources, however misunderstood. Attempts to reconcile science and religion sometimes resulted in a rejection of prophecy, miracle, and revealed religion, resulting in an inclination toward deism among some major political leaders of the age.

A non-denominational moral philosophy replaced theology in the college curricula at the nation&#x27;s three leading colleges at the time. Yale College, now Yale University, and the College of William &amp; Mary were reformed. The Presbyterian College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, and Harvard University, reformed their curricula to include natural philosophy (science), modern astronomy, and mathematics.

==European sources==
Sources of the American Enlightenment are many and vary according to time and place. As a result of an extensive book trade with Great Britain, the colonies were well acquainted with European literature almost contemporaneously. Early influences were English writers including James Harrington, Algernon Sidney, the Viscount Bolingbroke, John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon (especially the two&#x27;s Cato&#x27;s Letters), and Joseph Addison (whose tragedy Cato was extremely popular). A particularly important English legal writer was William Blackstone, whose &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; served as a major influence on the American Founders and is a key source in the development Anglo-American common law. Although Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; has long been cited as a major influence on American thinkers, historians David Lundberg and Henry F. May demonstrate that Locke&#x27;s &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; was far more widely read than were his political &quot;Treatises&quot;.

The Scottish Enlightenment also influenced American thinkers. David Hume&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; and his &quot;History of England&quot; were widely read in the colonies, and Hume&#x27;s political thought had a particular influence on Madison and the drafting of the U.S. Constitution. Francis Hutcheson&#x27;s ideas of ethics, along with notions of civility and politeness developed by the Earl of Shaftesbury, and Addison and Richard Steele in their &quot;Spectator&quot;, were a major influence on upper-class American colonists who sought to emulate European manners and learning.

By far the most important French sources to the American Enlightenment were Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of the Laws&quot; and Emer de Vattel&#x27;s &quot;Law of Nations&quot;. Both informed early American ideas of government and were major influences on the U.S. Constitution. Voltaire&#x27;s histories were widely read but seldom cited. Noah Webster used Rousseau&#x27;s educational ideas of child development to structure his famous &quot;Speller.&quot; The writings of German Samuel Pufendorf were commonly cited by American writers.

==Science==
Leading scientists included Franklin for his work on electricity; Jared Eliot for his work in metallurgy and agriculture; David Rittenhouse in astronomy, math, and instruments; Benjamin Rush in medical science; Charles Willson Peale in natural history; and Cadwallader Colden for his work in botany and town sanitation. Colden&#x27;s daughter, Jane Colden, was the first female botanist working in America. Benjamin Thompson was a leading scientist, especially in the field of heat.

==Architecture, arts, and culture==
After 1780, the Federal style of American Architecture began to diverge from the Georgian style and became a uniquely American genre. In 1813, Ithiel Town designed the first Gothic-style church in North America, Trinity Church on the Green in New Haven, Connecticut, predating the English Gothic revival by a decade. In the fields of literature, poetry, music, and drama some nascent artistic attempts were made, particularly in pre-war Philadelphia, but American (non-popular) culture in these fields was largely imitative of British culture for most of the period.

== Republicanism and liberalism ==

American republicanism emphasized consent of the governed, riddance of the aristocracy, and resistance towards corruption. It represented the convergence of classical republicanism and English republicanism (of 17th century Commonwealth men and 18th century English Country Whigs).

In the decades before the American Revolution (1776), the intellectual and political leaders of the colonies studied history intently, looking for guides or models for good (and bad) government. They especially followed the development of republican ideas in England. Pocock explains the intellectual sources in the United States:

The commitment of most Americans to these republican values made inevitable the American Revolution, for Britain was increasingly seen as corrupt and hostile to republicanism, and a threat to the established liberties the Americans enjoyed. Leopold von Ranke, a leading German historian, in 1848 claims that American republicanism played a crucial role in the development of European liberalism:

==Declaration of Independence==
The United States Declaration of Independence, which was primarily written by Thomas Jefferson, was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. The text of the second section of the Declaration of Independence reads:

Many historians find that the origin of the famous phrase &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot; derives from Locke&#x27;s position that &quot;no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions.&quot; Others suggest that Jefferson took the phrase from Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England.&quot; Others note that William Wollaston&#x27;s 1722 book &quot;The Religion of Nature Delineated&quot; describes the &quot;truest definition&quot; of &quot;natural religion&quot; as being &quot;&quot;The pursuit of happiness&quot; by the practice of reason and truth.&quot;

The Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was written by George Mason and adopted by the Virginia Convention of Delegates on June 12, 1776, a few days before Jefferson&#x27;s draft, in part, reads:

==Deism==

Both the moderate Enlightenment and a radical or revolutionary Enlightenment were reactions against the authoritarianism, irrationality, and obscurantism of the established churches. Philosophers such as Voltaire depicted organized religion as hostile to the development of reason and the progress of science and incapable of verification. An alternative religion was deism, the philosophical belief in a deity based on reason, rather than religious revelation or dogma. It was a popular perception among the &quot;philosophes&quot;, who adopted deistic attitudes to varying degrees. Deism greatly influenced the thought of intellectuals and Founding Fathers, including Adams, Franklin, perhaps Washington and especially Jefferson. The most articulate exponent was Thomas Paine, whose &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; was written in France and soon reached the United States. Paine was highly controversial; when Jefferson was attacked for his deism in the 1800 election, Democratic-Republican politicians took pains to distance their candidate from Paine. Unitarianism and Deism were strongly connected, the former being brought to America by Joseph Priestley. Samuel Johnson called Lord Edward Herbert the &quot;father of English Deism&quot;.

<text>Dong Biwu (; 5 March 1886 – 2 April 1975) was a Chinese communist revolutionary and politician, who served as acting Chairman of the People&#x27;s Republic of China between 1972 and 1975.

== Early life ==
Dong Biwu was born in Huanggang, Hubei, to a landlord family, and received a classical education. In 1911, he joined the Tongmenghui, and participated in the Wuchang Uprising. He then went to Japan in 1913 to study law at Nihon University. While there, he joined Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s newly-formed Chinese Revolutionary Party, later to become the Kuomintang. In 1915, he returned to China, organizing resistance against the Yuan Shikai regime in his native Hubei, which landed him in prison for six months. Upon his release, he returned to Japan to complete his law studies. Between 1919 and 1920, he lived in Shanghai, where he was first exposed to Marxism through a group of Communist intellectuals centered around Li Hanjun. Returning to Hubei, he set up a local Communist apparatus, and in 1921, he attended the 1st National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, representing Wuhan along with Chen Tanqiu. Incidentally, Dong was the only other person than Mao Zedong to be present at both the founding congress of the party and the proclamation ceremony of the People&#x27;s Republic of China twenty-eight years later.

==Revolutionary period==

Throughout the first half of the 1920s, Dong remained a member of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, with the tensions between the two parties increasing, he eventually chose to side with the Communists in the summer of 1927. After the Nanchang Uprising, he was forced into hiding, first seeking refuge in Kyoto for eight months, and then making his way to the Soviet Union. There, he attended the International Lenin School and the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University between 1928 and 1931. Upon his return to China in 1932, he became active in the Jiangxi Soviet, where he served as Political Director of the Red Army Academy and President of the Party School. During this time, Dong sided with Mao Zedong over Li Lisan in the two men&#x27;s struggle for party leadership. He then took part in the Long March, and upon the arrival in Yan&#x27;an, he resumed his school leadership duties. In this period, Dong came to be known as one of the &quot;Five Elders of Yan&#x27;an&quot; (), along with Lin Boqu, Xu Teli, Wu Yuzhang, and Xie Juezai.

During the war with Japan, Dong divided his time between Wuhan and Chongqing as a liaison with the Nationalist government, given his previous Kuomintang associations. In 1945, he traveled to San Francisco to attend the founding session of the United Nations, as part of a delegation led by T.V. Soong. He was the only representative of the Communist Party, whose Central Committee outlined the objectives of the trip as follows: &quot;to win foreign friends, to improve the party&#x27;s international position, and to try to stay and work in the United States.&quot; After the conference, Dong spent several months traveling the United States, seeking to attain these diplomatic goals. Towards the end of the Civil War in 1948, following decisive victories in the north, Dong was appointed Chairman of the North China People&#x27;s Government.

==People&#x27;s Republic of China==

After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Dong served as the Director of the Finance and Economic Committee of the Government Council. In 1954, he was appointed President of the Supreme People&#x27;s Court. With previous experience in international diplomacy from his visit to the United States in 1945, Dong was chosen to lead a delegation to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in 1958, keeping him away from Beijing for two months. In his absence, the work of the Supreme People&#x27;s Court over the last previous years was reviewed by a group headed by Peng Zhen. On his return, Dong was presented with the shortcomings revealed by the scrutiny, for which he accepted responsibility at a special judicial conference.

In early 1959, Dong was named Vice President of China in a joint appointment with Soong Ching-ling, a post he held until his death. Later the same year, Dong defended Peng Dehuai from criticism at the Lushan Conference, yet still managed to stay in favor with Mao, unlike others who stood up for the reproached general. In a similar manner, Dong would later remain unaffected by the political turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, despite coming from a relatively privileged background. Instead, he rose in prominence and public visibility during these tumultuous years, taking over many of the diplomatic and ceremonial responsibilities previously held by the purged Liu Shaoqi. Historians have attributed this curious fact not to any cunning political maneuvering, but to Dong&#x27;s special relationship with Mao and their always getting along well, ever since their first meeting at the founding of the Communist Party in 1921.

In the power vacuum that appeared after the fall of Lin Biao, Dong became Acting President of China, serving in that capacity from February 1972 to January 1975. At that point, the office of president was abolished and the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress - then Zhu De - became the formal head of state. Dong was, in turn, elected Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the People&#x27;s National Congress.

Dong died in Beijing on 2 April 1975, at the age of 89. In his official obituary, he is described as &quot;one of the founders of the Communist Party of China, a great Marxist, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, a founding father of the People&#x27;s Republic of China,&quot; and &quot;a founder of China&#x27;s socialist legal system.&quot;

In 1991, a statue of Dong was erected in one of Wuhan&#x27;s central squares, Hongshan Guangchang. The Hubei Provincial Museum houses a collection of Dong&#x27;s personal items.

<doc id="1075101" wikidata="Q5599825" url="?curid=1075101" title="Great Race (classic rally)">
<text>The Great Race (formerly known as the Great American Race) is a classic rally for street-legal vintage automobiles at least 45 years old. Vehicles must use original factory parts, and modern navigational aids like GPS are prohibited.

The race is a precision pace race, not a high-speed race. Points are awarded on the accuracy of a driver and navigator to match a time and average speed over a predetermined course. Points are also awarded on a handicap system that awards bonus points to older vehicles. Prizes are awarded in several categories, including the &quot;X-Cup&quot; for high school teams.

== Media coverage ==

The slow speeds of the vehicles involved, combined with the long-distance nature of auto rallying have made television coverage of the event limited. Highlights have been shown on ESPN, History Channel (which became a race sponsor in the early 1990s), and full coverage shows have aired on Speed Channel and The Outdoor Channel.

== Connections to NASCAR ==

NASCAR Cup race cars sponsored by Interstate Batteries have also been used to promote the &quot;Great Race&quot;. Jack Roush, owner of NASCAR race teams has also participated as a competitor and is currently a co-owner of the Great Race.

&quot;Note:&quot; The event was known as the &quot;Great American Race&quot; up to the mid-1990s and for the 25th Anniversary race in 2007. Although the name &quot;Great American Race&quot; has been applied to the Indy 500 and the Daytona 500, the events are not affiliated. Both the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Daytona International Speedway have served as the finish line of the Great Race.

<text>The Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross () was the highest military decoration of the Kingdom of Prussia and the German Empire. It was considered a senior decoration to the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross.

The Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to the most outstanding of generals who performed feats of leadership to the extreme benefit of the Prussian and later German state. It was awarded only twice, a century apart, to Gebhard von Blücher in 1815 for his part in the victory over Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in the Napoleonic Wars, and to Paul von Hindenburg on 25 March 1918 for his conduct of the 1918 German spring offensive in World War I. Hindenburg had received the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross on 9 December 1916.

The award is commonly known as &quot;Blücher&#x27;s Star&quot; (&quot;Blücherstern&quot;) after its first recipient.

A World War II version of the Star was devised, but never formally instituted or awarded. Following the Allied victory in May 1945, the United States Army seized the only known prototype, which had been stored in a bunker. It is now a part of the collection of the Museum of the United States Military Academy (USMA) in West Point, New York.

<text>The Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU), formerly Ponce School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences, is a private, for-profit university in Ponce, Puerto Rico and St. Louis, Missouri. It awards graduate degrees in Medicine (MD), Clinical Psychology (PsyD and PhD), Biomedical Sciences (PhD), Medical Sciences (MS), and Public Health (MPH and DrPH). The university has 360 students in its medical school and, as of 11 February 2019, was authorized to increase the student body at the medical school to 600 which, when fully in place, will make it the largest private medical school in Puerto Rico and one of the largest under the American flag.

==History==
What is now Ponce Health Sciences University began in 1976 as the school of medicine of the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico. Soon after its first medical class in 1977, the university decided to not continue its medical program. In order to save the only medical program in the region, a group of lay and professional leaders in southern Puerto Rico acquired the school of medicine and established the independent Ponce Medical School Foundation, Inc. as a non-profit organization in January 1980. In July 1980, the Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico (CHE-PR) authorized the Foundation to operate a medical school under the name Ponce School of Medicine. In 1981, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accredited the school to grant the Doctor of Medicine degree.

In 1983, the institution applied for funds under the Minority Biomedical Research Support Program (MBRS) and the Research Center in Minority Institutions (RCMI) Program. A Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences (PhD) was initiated in 1988, and in 1992 the Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico (CHE-PR) accredited the PhD Program and authorized PHSU to award a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in Biomedical Sciences.

In January 1995, the academic institution moved to a new campus with additional facilities. A Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program (PsyD Program) was begun in 1999 which was later expanded to offer a PhD in Psychology, Professional Certificate in Couples and Family Therapy, and Postgraduate Certificate in Neuroscience of Learning.

In August 2002 a Master&#x27;s of Public Health (MPH) program was started with specialization in Epidemiology, Environmental Health, and General Public Health. A DrPH in Epidemiology is also offered. On 5 September 2014, the Ponce School of Medicine and Health Sciences was acquired by Arist Corporation, which itself is an investment of global media, services and education company Bertelsmann.

The university has a campus in St. Louis, Missouri. In March 2020 the school &quot;announced an $80 million investment toward creating a new medical school&quot; near their downtown location and on the former Pruitt-Igoe site.

<text>John Shaw Neilson (1872–1942) was an Australian poet.

Slightly built, for most of his life he worked as a labourer, fruit-picking, clearing scrub, navvying and working in quarries, and, after 1928, working as a messenger with the Country Roads Board in Melbourne. Largely untrained and only basically educated, Neilson became known as one of Australia&#x27;s finest lyric poets, who wrote a great deal about the natural world, and the beauty in it.

==Early life==
Neilson was born in Penola, South Australia of purely Scottish ancestry. His grandparents were John Neilson and Jessie MacFarlane of Cupar, Neil Mackinnon of Skye, and Margaret Stuart of Greenock. His mother, Margaret MacKinnon, was born at Dartmoor, Victoria, his father, John Neilson, at Stranraer, Scotland, in 1844.

John Neilson senior was brought to South Australia at nine years of age, had practically no education, and was a shepherd, shearer and small farmer all his life. He never had enough money to get good land, and like other pioneers he fought drought and rabbits and other pests, receiving little reward for his labours. He died in 1922, having lived just long enough to see his son accepted as an Australian poet. He himself had written verses; one song, &quot;Waiting for the Rain&quot;, was popular in the shearing sheds, and in January 1893 he wrote the senior prize poem, &quot;The Pioneers&quot;, for the literary competition held by the Australian Natives&#x27; Association. In 1938 a small collection of his poems, &quot;The Men of the Fifties&quot;, was published by the Hawthorn Press at Melbourne.

John Shaw Neilson had little more education than his father. When about eight years old he was for 15 months at the state school at Penola, but he had to leave in 1881 when the family removed to Minimay in the south-west Wimmera in Victoria. There was no school at Minimay then, but four years later one was opened and Neilson attended for another 15 months. There was, however, a Bible and a tattered copy of Robert Burns&#x27; poems in the house, and when at the age of 15 a copy of Thomas Hood&#x27;s poems came in his way, Neilson read them all with great joy. Driven out by drought, Neilson&#x27;s father took his family to Nhill in 1889, and was employed as a farm worker and on the roads. His son soon after began to write verses of which some appeared in the local press and one in &quot;The Australasian&quot; in Melbourne.

==Poetry==
In January 1893 John Shaw Neilson won the junior prize for a poem at the Australian Natives&#x27; Association&#x27;s competition, in the same year that his father won the senior prize. In 1895 he went with his father to Sea Lake, and about a year later had some verses accepted by &quot;The Bulletin&quot; in Sydney. But his health broke down and he did little writing for about four years.

He was contributing to the Bulletin between 1901 and 1906, and about 1908 some of his verses, mostly of a light or popular kind, were accepted by Randolph Bedford for the &quot;Clarion&quot;. From about 1906 Neilson&#x27;s sight began to fail, for the rest of his life he was able to do little reading, and most of his work was dictated.

When &quot;The Bookfellow&quot; was revived in 1911 Neilson was a contributor, and Alfred George Stephens the editor, began collecting the best of his poems, intending to issue them in a volume under the title of &quot;Green Days and Cherries&quot;; &quot;Fred John&#x27;s Annual&quot; for 1913 included Neilson as the author of this volume. It was, however, delayed; World War I delayed it further; and it was not issued until 1919, when the title &quot;Heart of Spring&quot; was adopted. It had a laudatory preface by Stephens which stated that some of the work was &quot;unsurpassed in the range of English lyrics&quot;. It was well received, and in 1923, with the help of Mrs Louise Dyer, another volume, &quot;Ballad and Lyrical Poems&quot;, was published. This included nearly all the work in the first volume with some 20 additional lyrics.

About this time Neilson visited Melbourne and met many of the literary people of the period. Now in his 50s and not a robust man he was beginning to feel the strain of physical work.

&quot;I don&#x27;t mind some kinds of pick and shovel work,&quot; he said to Percival Serle, &quot;but when I have to throw heavy stuff over my shoulder it gives me rather a wrench.&quot; He may have been referring to the time he spent in the Heyfield area, where he wrote several poems and helped in the construction of the Lake Glenmaggie weir wall.

In 1925 and again in 1926, Alfred Stephens suggested in newspaper articles that more suitable employment should be found for him. The difficulty was that Neilson&#x27;s poor eyesight unfitted him for most kinds of work. However, a movement began in Melbourne to help him and he was granted a small literary pension; and eventually in 1928 a position was found for him as an attendant in the office of the Victorian Country Roads Board. This office was directly opposite the Exhibition Gardens, Melbourne, and in these pleasant surroundings Neilson spent his days until near the end of his life.

A volume, &quot;New Poems&quot;, was published in 1927, and in 1934 his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared. Four years later another small volume was published, &quot;Beauty Imposes&quot;. A number of Neilson&#x27;s poems were set to music by composers such as Margaret Sutherland, Alfred Hill, Cathie O&#x27;Sullivan, Llew and Mara Kiek, Richard Keam and Darryl Emmerson. The latter&#x27;s play, &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, based on the life and writings of Neilson, enjoyed much success in the 1980s, toured twice, was produced for radio by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and published by Currency Press, Sydney, in 1987. In 2012 an updated and expanded compilation of Neilson&#x27;s Collected Poems, edited by Margaret Roberts, was published by University of Western Australia Press.

==Death==
Neilson retired from the Country Roads Board early in 1941, and went to Queensland to stay with friends. His literary pension was now increased to £2 a week. Soon after his return to Melbourne his health began to fail, and he died of heart disease at a private hospital on 12 May 1942. He was buried in the Footscray Cemetery near Melbourne.

==Legacy==
In 1946 a bronze sculpture of the poet was commissioned for the opening of the Footscray Children&#x27;s Library in Buckley Street. The sculpture, by Wallace Anderson, is still on display at the Footscray Library in Paisley Street. The Maribyrnong Library Service, who now run the Footscray Library, holds an archive, the John Shaw Neilson Collection. There is also a local John Shaw Neilson Society.

In 1964 the Nhill and District Historical Society erected a monument to Neilson. In 1972 the cottage birthplace of Neilson was relocated from Penola to a park in Nhill, as the John Shaw Neilson National Memorial Cottage.

Since 1970 the Fellowship of Australian Writers has presented an annual award, the FAW John Shaw Neilson Poetry Award, for unpublished poems of at least 14 lines.

Since 2005 the Penola Coonawarra Arts Festival have hosted the John Shaw Neilson Art Prize, for visual works inspired by the poet.

Despite Melbourne&#x27;s strong literary tradition, there are no Melbourne suburbs named after writers. There was a campaign in 2009 to name a new suburb after Neilson.

<doc id="1075132" wikidata="Q7192435" url="?curid=1075132" title="Pierre S. du Pont">
<text>Pierre Samuel du Pont (; January 15, 1870 – April 4, 1954) was an American entrepreneur, businessman, philanthropist and member of the prominent du Pont family.

He was president of DuPont from 1915 to 1919, and was on its board of directors until 1940. He also managed General Motors from 1915 to 1920, became GM&#x27;s president in 1920, and was on GM&#x27;s board of directors until 1928. Among other notable accomplishments, he was among the founding board of directors of the Empire State Building which opened in 1931.

== Early life ==
Du Pont was born January 15, 1870, on the family estate near Wilmington, Delaware, and was named after his great-great-grandfather, Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours. He was the eldest of three sons born to Lammot du Pont and Mary Belin.

His great-great-grandfather, and namesake, was a French economist (who had been granted the ennobling suffix &quot;de Nemours&quot; after election to the Constituent Assembly) and patriarch of the du Pont family. Du Pont de Nemours immigrated to America with relatives including his son, Eleuthère Irénée du Pont, who founded the DuPont company in 1802, and whose descendants would form one of the richest American business dynasties of the ensuing two centuries.

In 1884 his father was killed in an industrial accident. As the eldest son of ten children he was patriarch of the family. For the rest of their lives, his siblings, even his older sisters, addressed him as &quot;Dad&quot; or &quot;Daddy.&quot;

He attended MIT and graduated with a degree in chemistry in 1890.

== Career==
Following graduation from MIT in 1890, he became assistant superintendent at Eleutherian Mills on the Brandywine River.

He and his cousin Francis Gurney du Pont developed the first American smokeless powder in 1892 at the Carney&#x27;s Point plant in New Jersey.

Most of the 1890s he spent working with the management at a steel firm partly owned by DuPont (primarily by T. Coleman du Pont), the Johnson Street Rail Company in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Here he learned to deal with money from the company&#x27;s president, Arthur Moxham. In 1899, unsatisfied with how conservative DuPont&#x27;s management was, he quit and took over the Johnson Company. In 1901, while du Pont was supervising the liquidation of Johnson Company assets in Lorain, Ohio, he employed John J. Raskob as a private secretary, beginning a long and profitable business and personal relationship between the two.

=== Expansion of DuPont ===

He and his cousins, Alfred I. du Pont and T. Coleman du Pont, purchased E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company in 1902, in order to keep the company in family hands, after the death of its president, Eugene I. du Pont. They set about buying smaller powder firms. Until 1914, during Coleman du Pont&#x27;s illness, Pierre du Pont served as treasurer, executive vice-president, and acting president.

In 1915, a group headed by Pierre, which included outsiders, bought Coleman&#x27;s stock. Alfred was offended and sued Pierre for breach of trust.

Pierre was DuPont&#x27;s president until 1919. Pierre gave the DuPont company a modern management structure and modern accounting policies and made the concept of return on investment primary. During World War I, the company grew very quickly due to advance payments on Allied munition contracts. He also established many other DuPont interests in other industries.

He was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s January 31, 1927, issue. That same year he was elected an honorary member of the Delaware Society of the Cincinnati. In 1930, he was elected a director of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

=== General Motors ===
In 1915, Du Pont was elected a director of General Motors. where he was a significant figure in the success of the company and was noted for building a sizeable personal investment in the company as well as supporting John J. Raskob&#x27;s proposal for DuPont to invest in the automobile company.

In 1920, he became president of General Motors succeeding William C. Durant, and resigned in 1923, when he was succeeded by Alfred P. Sloan Jr. Pierre du Pont resigned the chairmanship of GM in response to GM President Alfred Sloan&#x27;s dispute with Raskob over Raskob&#x27;s involvement with the Democratic National Committee. When du Pont retired from its board of directors, GM was the largest company in the world.

===DuPont and MIT===
Du Pont was one of the first of many of his family members to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both his younger brothers, Irénée du Pont (1897) and Lammot du Pont II (1901), graduated from MIT. Du Pont, his relations and the DuPont corporation were generous benefactors over the years, and helped set up multiple endowments, fellowships, scholarships and faculty chairs for the university. When MIT moved to its current location in Cambridge in 1917, Pierre, T. Coleman du Pont and Charles Hayden donated $215,000 to house the Department of Mining, Engineering and Metallurgy (now the Department of Materials Science and Engineering).

Du Pont was on multiple boards and committees, and from 1916 to 1951 he was a member of the MIT Corporation, the university&#x27;s board of trustees. Along with his brother Lammot, he was given the honor of being made a life member emeritus when he stepped down from the board in 1951.

In 2000, the DuPont MIT Alliance (DMA) was formed. Over the next 10 years, the DuPont corporation donated $55 million to the university to fund as many as 20 different research projects.

=== Later life===
Pierre retired from DuPont&#x27;s board in 1940. He also was on the Delaware State Board of Education and donated millions to Delaware&#x27;s public schools, financing the replacement of Delaware&#x27;s dilapidated Negro schools.

In 1943, his genealogical research book, &quot;Genealogy of the Du Pont family, 1739–1942&quot;, was published.

==Personal life==

He was a bachelor until age 45. On October 16, 1915, after the death of his mother, he married his first cousin Alice Belin (1872–1944), a daughter of Henry Belin Jr., from Scranton, Pennsylvania. The ceremony was at 400 Park Avenue in Manhattan, the home of her brother F. Lammot Belin. They were married in New York City because Pennsylvania law prohibited first cousins from marrying. They had no children.

His wife died at their home in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, on June 23, 1944.

Du Pont died nearly ten years later on April 4, 1954, at Memorial Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware. After a funeral held at Longwood, he was buried in the Du Pont family cemetery near the Brandywine River.

===Legacy===
Du Pont was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1917. In 1919 du Pont became a member of the Delaware board of education, becoming president in the 1920s. At the time, state law prohibited money raised from white taxpayers from being used to support the state&#x27;s schools for black children. Appalled by the condition of the black schools, du Pont donated four million dollars to construct eighty-six new school buildings. By 1927, it was reported that he had provided school buildings for 43% of Delaware&#x27;s schoolchildren. In 1925 he became Delaware&#x27;s tax commissioner, and used his position to modernize the tax office and ensure tax collection.

In 1927, du Pont became the president of the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment. He and his family were among the major donors to the group.

Du Pont is famous for opening his personal estate, Longwood Gardens, with its beautiful gardens, fountains, and conservatory, to the public. Its construction was inspired by his international travels, visiting the great gardens of the world.

The former P. S. Dupont High School in Wilmington, now a middle school, is named in his honor. A building at the University of Delaware, Du Pont Hall, is also named for him. It houses the offices and laboratories for the College of Engineering. Du Pont also donated $900,000 towards the construction and establishment of Kennett High School in 1924, equal to over $12.8M today.

<text>Project Liberty Ship is a non-profit organization in the United States dedicated to the preservation of the Liberty ship . Project Liberty Ship began in 1978, when a seminar on Liberty ship preservation was held aboard the &quot;John W. Brown&quot;, which was then serving as a nautical high school operated by the City of New York. Those attending the seminar could foresee the day, rapidly approaching, when the last ship of that great fleet of over 2700 Liberty Ships would face the breaker&#x27;s torch or be sunk as an artificial reef, and they were determined to preserve at least one ship as a memorial museum on the east coast of the United States.

With the backing of the National Maritime Historical Society, an organization was formed to work toward the preservation of the &quot;John W. Brown&quot;. Although there were, at that time, several Liberty Ships that might have been candidates for restoration, the &quot;John W. Brown&quot; was the logical choice. A small staff of volunteers began planning for the day when New York would close down its floating high school and the ship would become available. A membership drive was commenced and publication of a newsletter, &quot;Liberty Log&quot;, was begun.

The ship&#x27;s career as a schoolship ended in 1982, and the group, now called Project Liberty Ship, was in the midst of a search for a suitable berth in New York Harbor at which to display the &quot;John W. Brown&quot;. Despite their best efforts, Project Liberty Ship could not locate a single berth in the entire harbor that would accept the ship. They were forced to stand and watch as the &quot;John W. Brown&quot; was towed out of the harbor and down the coast to the James River, Reserve Fleet in July 1983.

While its membership slowly grew, Project Liberty Ship&#x27;s volunteer staff continued to search for a berth in New York and accomplished several other important steps. A law was passed in the United States Congress transferring title of the ship from the United States Maritime Administration to Project Liberty Ship. Application was made, and accepted, to list the ship on the National Register of Historic Places. SS &quot;John W. Brown&quot; became a National Register Ship, one of the very few such ships in the nation.

Finally, late in 1987, Project Liberty Ship officers gave up their attempts to berth &quot;John W. Brown&quot; in New York and turned to Baltimore, Maryland. In January 1988, a meeting was held at the Baltimore Museum of Industry to discuss the idea. They expected half a dozen people to attend, and they got 40. From the original group who met at the museum a core committee was formed to begin the effort. &quot;Project Liberty Ship Baltimore&quot; went to work, with the full backing and support of the parent group in New York, to permanently display &quot;John W. Brown&quot; in the harbor of her birth.

<text>Hypnotize the Moon is the third studio album by American country music singer Clay Walker. It was released October 17, 1995, on Giant Records. It was the third consecutive album of his career to earn RIAA platinum certification for U.S. shipments of one million copies, although it was also the first album of his career not to produce any Number One hits. Released from this album were, in order: &quot;Who Needs You Baby&quot;, the title track, &quot;Only on Days That End in &#x27;Y&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Bury the Shovel&quot;. Respectively, these reached #2, #2, #5, and #18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. &quot;Love You Like You Love Me&quot; was co-written by Steve Wariner, who later recorded it on his 1998 album &quot;Burnin&#x27; the Roadhouse Down&quot;.

==Background==
In an interview with the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; Walker stated about the album &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to change country music; I want to be part of it, country music radio has really been the key for us. They&#x27;ve been behind us from the beginning, especially in this area.&quot; During an interview with &quot;The Grand Rapids Press&quot; Walker said, &quot;The third album has to be a landmark album for us. It has to take me to the next level.&quot; He also stated, &quot;I know for sure that this is the best album I&#x27;ve ever done. I&#x27;m just so proud of it.&quot;

Walker told &quot;Country Song Roundup&quot;, &quot;The first album, I had a lot of very raw sound and it was a new beginning for me. The second album I stretched out of that one and tried to find my limitations. This album is something that I&#x27;m going to be proud of 20 years from now.&quot; In a press release for the album Walker stated, &quot;I really wanted this album to be more traditional country than anything I&#x27;ve ever done. That&#x27;s why I wrote and looked for songs that were more in that vein.&quot; In another interview with &quot;Country Song Roundup&quot; Walker said, &quot;I try to record music that is going to be played on the radio twenty years from now. It&#x27;s hard to make songs stand out with so many artists and songs out there.&quot;

==Critical reception==

The editors at &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote in their review of the album &quot;Walker is a big-voiced Texas singer with smart song selection and a minimalist honky-tonk production. He sounds unassuming until you realize that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s all about. He gets in your yard without ever getting in your face. Very intelligent use of fiddle and steel here.&quot; Helen Thompson of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; wrote, &quot;Hypnotize the Moon, is already flying out of stores. Attribute his success to a knack for writing mainstream country songs or to his engaging modesty--or even to his tight blue jeans, which he wears in his sexy videos and onstage.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, &quot; Walker shines on both polished, contemporary ballads and gritty traditional country, and his consistently excellent performance is what carries the album over the weak spots.&quot; David Zimmerman of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the album two stars and wrote, &quot;The follow-up to Walker&#x27;s successful debut album, If I Could Make a Living, doesn&#x27;t have as much verve or as many catchy hooks. But Walker&#x27;s workmanlike approach and believable delivery give emotional heft to the waltz.&quot; Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B+ rating and wrote that Walker is &quot;only as memorable as his songs, and in this case, that&#x27;s enough. Whether you favor the Haggardesque &quot;Let Me Take the Heartache (Off Your Hands)&quot; or the MOR title ballad, he&#x27;s one cookie-cutter sensation who isn&#x27;t likely to crumble.

Richard McVey II of &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; gave the album a positive review and wrote, &quot;Be prepared for an abundance of fiddle and steel guitar on an album that will no doubt continue Walker&#x27;s string of platinum success.&quot; Mario Tarradell of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; said, &quot;His third album, Hypnotize the Moon, is filled with the same type of radio-friendly ballads and mass-appeal up-tempo numbers that took his first two CDs to platinum.&quot;

<text>Expressome may refer to:
*A supramolecular complex consisting of RNA polymerase and a trailing ribosome linked by a shared mRNA. The expressome complex mediates a mechanism of gene expression regulation termed transcription-translation coupling.
*The whole set of gene expression in a cell, tissue, organ, organisms, and species. Expressome is a slightly larger concept than transcriptome. The transcriptome is the set of transcripts, while expressome includes transcripts, proteins and other ligands (abundance or concentration).

<text>Georgette Lizette &quot;Googie&quot; Withers (12 March 191715 July 2011) was an English entertainer. She was a dancer and actress, with a lengthy career spanning some seventy-three years in theatre, film, and television. She was a well-known actress and star of British films during and after the Second World War.

She often featured in British productions, primarily in films with actor and producer John McCallum, whom she married and, in the late 1950s, emigrated together to her husband&#x27;s native Australia, where they became best known in theatre. During the 1970s, she played prison governor Faye Boswell in the TV series &quot;Within These Walls&quot;, and continued to feature in films. She won the inaugural British Academy Television Award for Best Actress in 1955.

==Biography==
Withers was born in Karachi, British India (now Pakistan), to Edgar Withers, a captain in the Royal Navy, and Lizette Wilhelmina Katarina, of Dutch, French and German descent. She was named after her aunt Georgette Ottolina, but was fondly given the name &quot;chota ghugi&#x27;&quot; at a young age by her Punjabi &quot;ayah&quot; (nanny), chota ghugi&#x27; being Punjabi for &quot;little dove&quot;, which became anglicised to &quot;Googie&quot;. She became used to the nickname and decided to keep it as her stage name. As a child, she showed interest in learning the Urdu language.

After her father left the Royal Navy to manage a foundry in Birmingham, England, Googie was sent to Fredville Park School, a boarding school in Nonington, and a secondary day school in London.

==Acting career==
Withers began acting at the age of twelve, and was student at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, and at the dance school of Buddy Bradley, where she learnt ballet and tap. She was a dancer in a West End production when she was offered work as a film extra in Michael Powell&#x27;s &quot;The Girl in the Crowd&quot; (1935). She arrived on the set to find one of the major players in the production had been dismissed, and she was immediately asked to step into the leading role, beginning a seven year contract with Warner Brothers, after which she worked for Fox British, Ealing Studios and The Rank Organisation.

During the 1930s, Withers was constantly in demand in lead roles in minor films, and supporting roles in more prestigious productions. She was in &quot;Windfall&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Love Test&quot; (1935), and she had the lead in &quot;All at Sea&quot; (1935). 

Withers supported in &quot;Dark World&quot; (1935), &quot;King of Hearts&quot; (1936), and &quot;Accused&quot; (1936). &quot;Her Last Affaire&quot; (1935) was her third film with Powell.

She followed it with &quot;She Knew What She Wanted&quot; (1936), &quot;Crown v. Stevens&quot; (1936) (directed by Powell), &quot;Crime Over London&quot; (1936), &quot;Pearls Bring Tears&quot; (1937), &quot;Action for Slander&quot; (1937), and &quot;Paradise for Two&quot; (1937).

Withers had the lead in &quot;You&#x27;re the Doctor&quot; (1938) and was back to support for &quot;Kate Plus Ten&quot; (1938). Her best-known work of the period was as one of Margaret Lockwood&#x27;s friends in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938).

She continued in support roles in &quot;Paid in Error&quot; (1938) and &quot;Strange Boarders&quot; (1938). She was in a Will Hay film &quot;Convict 99&quot; (1938) and supported Jack Buchanan in &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; (1939). Then she appeared in crime films &quot;Murder in Soho&quot; (1939) and &quot;Dead Men are Dangerous&quot; (1939).

She supported George Formby in &quot;Trouble Brewing&quot; (1939) and Tommy Trinder in &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t Say No&quot; (1939). She was in a Robert Montgomery film &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; (1939) and was reunited with Buchanan in &quot;Bulldog Sees It Through&quot; (1940). She was still supporting comics in &quot;Back-Room Boy&quot; (1942) with Arthur Askey.

===Rising fame===
Among her successes of the 1940s, and a departure from her previous roles, was the Powell and Pressburger film &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; (1942), a topical World War II drama, in which she played a Dutch resistance fighter who helps British airmen return to safety from behind enemy lines.

Powell and Pressburger then used her in a film they produced but did not direct, &quot;The Silver Fleet&quot; (1943). She played Helen, a significant second lead in the Clive Book-directed 1944 comedy &quot;On Approval&quot;.

Withers was in &quot;They Came to a City&quot; (1945), directed by Basil Dearden, and was one of several stars in &quot;Dead of Night&quot; (1945).

She was given a star part in &quot;Pink String and Sealing Wax&quot; (1945). It was well received, and Withers was given the title role in &quot;The Loves of Joanna Godden&quot; (1947), which was a hit. In the cast was actor John McCallum, whom Withers later married. They remained married until McCallum died in 2010.

Withers then starred in &quot;It Always Rains on Sunday&quot; (1948), which was one of the biggest hits of the year. In 1948, British exhibitors voted her the 8th most popular British star in the country.

Three comedies followed: the hugely popular &quot;Miranda&quot; (1948), with McCallum, and &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot; (1949) and &quot;Traveller&#x27;s Joy&quot; (1949), both directed by Ralph Thomas. Next, she was third-billed after Hollywood stars Gene Tierney and Richard Widmark in the tense thriller &quot;Night and the City&quot; (1950).

Withers took 13 months off following the birth of her first child, then returned to star as a doctor in &quot;White Corridors&quot; (1951), one of the most popular films of the year in Britain. She was one of many cameos in &quot;The Magic Box&quot; (1951) and was in a play &quot;Winter Journey&quot;.

Withers made three films with her husband, &quot;Derby Day&quot; (1952), &quot;Devil on Horseback&quot; (1954), and &quot;Port of Escape&quot; (1956).

In 1954, she starred with McCallum in the West End play &quot;Waiting for Gillian&quot;, by Ronald Millar.

===Australia===
Withers first toured Australia in the stage play &quot;Simon and Laura&quot;. After McCallum was offered the position of running J.C. Williamson theatres, they moved to Australia in 1959. Withers starred in a number of stage plays, including Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot;, &quot;Desire of the Moth&quot;, &quot;The First 400 Years&quot; (with Keith Michell), &quot;The Circle&quot;, A. R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot;, &quot;Time and the Conways&quot;, &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, &quot;Beekman Place&quot; (1965), for which she also designed the set. &quot;Desire of the Moth&quot;, &quot;The Kingfisher&quot;, &quot;Stardust&quot;, Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and Wilde&#x27;s &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; for the Melbourne Theatre Company; both productions toured Australia. They appeared together in the UK in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End and on the subsequent British Council tour of Europe in 1983–84, and in W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Circle&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Withers starred on Broadway with Michael Redgrave in &quot;The Complaisant Lover&quot;, and in London with Alec Guinness in &quot;Exit the King&quot;.

===Later career===
Withers returned to films with the lead in &quot;Nickel Queen&quot; (1971), directed by McCallum.

She was in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; (1974) on Australian TV.

In 1974, she appeared as Faye Boswell, the original governor of a women&#x27;s prison, in the television series &quot;Within These Walls&quot;. Because &quot;Within These Walls&quot; had been a moderate success in Australia, she was approached by producers to play the role of the Governor in the Australian version titled &quot;Prisoner&quot;, but she declined and the role was given to Patsy King.

Performances on the stage in productions of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; earned Withers a nomination in the Actress of the Year in a Revival at the 1976 Laurence Olivier Awards.

Withers starred in the BBC adaptation of &quot;Hotel du Lac&quot; (1986), which was followed a year later by another BBC production, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;.

In 1989, she appeared at Brighton in England in &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot; alongside her husband John and her daughter, Joanna. In the previous year, the play had been a success in New York, starring Nancy Marchand. In 1990, she appeared in ITV&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Ending Up&quot;. Her last screen performance was as the Australian novelist Katharine Susannah Prichard in the film &quot;Shine&quot; (1996), for which she and the other cast members were nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award for &quot;Outstanding performance by a cast&quot;.

In 2002, aged 85, Withers, with Vanessa Redgrave, appeared in London&#x27;s West End, in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;.

In October 2007, aged 90 and 89 respectively, Withers and McCallum appeared in an extended interview with Peter Thompson on ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;Talking Heads&quot; programme.

==Death==
Withers died on 15 July 2011 at her Sydney home, aged 94. Her husband, actor, television producer and studio executive John McCallum predeceased her on 3 February 2010.

==Honours==
Withers was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for services to drama, in the 1980 Australia Day Honours List. In the 2001 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List (UK), she was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Withers was a JC Williamson Award recipient for lifetime achievement in 1999. In 1992 Googie Withers and John McCallum were founding patrons and active supporters of the Tait Memorial Trust in London. A Charity established by Isla Baring OAM, the daughter of Sir Frank Tait of J. C. Williamson&#x27;s to support young Australian performing artists in the UK.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1971, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews whilst thinking she was going to be interviewed by her close friend Godfrey Winn. Although she knew Andrews, when he appeared as she entered the set, she asked him why he was no longer working as a presenter and was instead working as a floor manager.

<doc id="1075158" wikidata="Q7101052" url="?curid=1075158" title="2004 Oregon Ballot Measure 36">
<text>Ballot Measure 36 was a 2004 initiative in the U.S. state of Oregon. It amended the Oregon Constitution to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman. The initiative passed with 1,028,546 votes in favor, and 787,556 votes against (57% to 43%) in the November 2, 2004 general election.
It is one of a number of U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. However, unlike other similar ballot measures passed on or near the same election date, the amendment did not explicitly ban civil unions between same-sex couples.

On May 19, 2014, the measure was declared unconstitutional by a U.S. federal district court judge, who ruled that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

== Results ==

== Amendment to Constitution ==
Measure 36 added the following text to , as Section 5a:
== Political context ==
The measure was placed on the ballot through an initiative petition brought by the Oregon Defense of Marriage Coalition, a group dedicated to &quot;preserving marriage as a union only between one man and one woman.&quot; The group was formed in reaction to same-sex marriages performed in Multnomah County and Benton County after their respective county commissions interpreted the Oregon Constitution and Oregon law as authorizing the issuing of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Supporters of the measure, in addition to opposing same-sex marriage on principle, were also angry by the controversial means by which the Multnomah County Commission had come to its decision: no public hearings were held before the commission voted to allow the marriages and one of the commissioners, Lonnie Roberts, was not informed of the move until after the other commissioners began issuing licenses. Roberts criticized the &quot;clandestine way&quot; that the decision was made and speculated that he had not been included in the discussion because the other commissioners knew that he wouldn&#x27;t support their decision. Supporters also wanted to prevent the state courts from coming to the same conclusion as the county commissions—that the state constitution and law required the government to license same-sex marriage—before several standing civil rights lawsuits on the issue could be resolved.

Basic Rights Oregon led the campaign against Measure 36. Opponents of the measure made several arguments. Many were supporters of same-sex marriage. In addition, some argued that regardless of voters&#x27; feelings on same-sex marriage, the state constitution was an inappropriate place to dictate marriage policy, which should have been statutory. Opponents also argued that the measure added discriminatory language to the state constitution, which, they predicted, would later be seen in the same negative light as earlier constitutional language against African Americans. They also feared that the measure could be used as a legal basis for denying benefits to same-sex couples which are automatically granted to heterosexual married couples.

According to Daniel June in &quot;JD Journal&quot;, Judge Harry Pregerson effectively undermined the ban by declaring it unconstitutional, when he ruled in favor of Allison Clark that she should receive the same work benefits with her homosexual partner as heterosexual couples would receive.

On May 19, 2014, United States District Judge Michael McShane ruled that Oregon&#x27;s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. Since then, same-sex marriage has been legally recognized in Oregon.

==Satirical arguments==
Marvin Dennis Moore, a Portland church organist, wrote satirical arguments on several Oregon ballot measures, including Measure 36. Moore&#x27;s arguments, ostensibly in favor of the measure, were printed in the official voters&#x27; pamphlet. For example, reacting to some supporters&#x27; claims that the purpose of marriage is for procreation, he argues that &quot;couples who fail to conceive within two years ought to have their marriage licenses revoked.&quot; Measure 36 supporters criticized the placement of Moore&#x27;s arguments in the &quot;Arguments in Favor&quot; section of the pamphlet, but the Oregon Secretary of State&#x27;s Office countered they had no choice under the law but to print his arguments as specified.

<doc id="1075176" wikidata="Q1907676" url="?curid=1075176" title="Padishah">
<text>Padishah (; ) is a superlative sovereign title of Persian origin.

A form of the word is known already from Middle Persian (or Pahlavi) as &quot;pātaxšā(h)&quot; or &quot;pādixšā(y)&quot;. Middle Persian &quot;pād&quot; may stem from Avestan &quot;paiti&quot;, and is akin to Pati (title). &quot;Xšāy&quot; &#x27;to rule&#x27; and &quot;xšāyaθiya&quot; &#x27;king&#x27; are both from Old Persian.

It was adopted by several monarchs claiming the highest rank, roughly equivalent to the ancient Persian notion of &quot;Great King&quot;, and later adopted by post-Achaemenid and the Mughal emperors of India. However, in some periods it was used more generally for autonomous Muslim rulers, as in the &quot;Hudud al-&#x27;Alam&quot; of the 10th century, where even some petty princes of Afghanistan are called &quot;pādshā(h)&quot;/&quot;pādshāʼi&quot;/&quot;pādshāy&quot;.

The rulers on the following thrones – the first two effectively commanding major West Asian empires – were styled Padishah:

* The Shahanshah of Iran, originating mainly with the Safavids
* The Padishah of the Ottoman Empire
*The Badshah of Hindustan, used by the Mughals
* Some Seljuk rulers, like Grand Seljuk Ahmad Sanjar (as , a translation of the Arabic [King of the East and the West]), Sultan of Rum Kaykhusraw I (as &quot;Padishah of Islam&quot;), and Sultan of Rum Kayqubad I (as ).
* Mongol Ilkhan Ghazan took the title &quot;Padshah-i Islam&quot; after he converted to Islam in 1295, possibly in order to undermine the religious prestige of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. The title &quot;Ilkhan&quot;, that came into use –1265, may be an equivalent of &quot;Padishah&quot;, if it is taken to mean &#x27;sovereign khan&#x27; (and not &#x27;subordinate khan&#x27; as often posited).
* Miangul Golshahzada Abdul Wadud (predecessor styled &quot;Amir-i shariat&quot;, successors [Khān and] &quot;Wali&quot;) of the Pakistani North-West Frontier state of Swat, who called himself &quot;badshah&quot; from November 1918 to March 1926.
* Ahmad Shah Durrani, who founded the Durrani Empire in 1747 with the title &quot;Pādshah-i Afghanistan&quot; in Persian and &quot;Badcha Da Afghanistan&quot; in the Pashto language. The Sadduzai were overthrown in 1823 but there was a brief restoration by Shah Shujah in 1839 with the help of British India. The title became dormant from his assassination in 1842 until 1926 when Amanullah Khan resurrected it (official from 1937) and was finally abandoned with the abdication of Mohammed Zahir Shah in 1973 following a coup; at other times the Afghan monarchy used the style &quot;Emir (Amir al-Momenin)&quot; or Malik (&#x27;King&#x27;).
* The last Basha bey of Tunisia, Muhammad VIII al-Amin (proclaimed bey on 15 May 1943), adopted the sovereign style &quot;padshah&quot; 20 March 1956 – 25 July 1957.
* The female monarch Razia of the Delhi Sultanate used the masculine title &quot;padshah&quot;.

The compound Pādshah-i-Ghazi (&#x27;Victorious Emperor&#x27;) is only recorded for two individual rulers:

# Ahmad Shah Durrani, Emperor of the Durrani Empire ()
# Rustam-i-Dauran, Aristu-i-Zaman, Asaf Jah IV, Muzaffar ul-Mamaluk, Nizam ul-Mulk, Nizam ud-Daula, Nawab Mir Farkhunda &#x27;Ali Khan Bahadur [Gufran Manzil], Sipah Salar, Fath Jang, Ayn waffadar Fidvi-i-Senliena, Iqtidar-i-Kishwarsitan Muhammad Akbar Shah Padshah-i-Ghazi, Nizam of Hyderabad ()

* The Sikhs usе the term Padishah for God and the 10 gurus. Padishah is also used for the 10th and last Guru of Sikhs Guru Gobind Singh.

Like many titles, the word &quot;Padishah&quot; was also often used as a name, either by nobles with other (in this case always lower) styles, or even by commoners.

Padshah Begum is the title of consorts of &quot;padishahs&quot;.

==Ottoman Empire==

In the Ottoman Empire the title padishah was exclusively reserved for the Ottoman emperor, as the Ottoman chancery rarely and unwillingly addressed foreign monarchs as padishahs. The Habsburg emperors were consequently denied this title and addressed merely as the &quot;kings of Vienna&quot; (&quot;beç kıralı&quot;). With the Peace of Zsitvatorok in 1606, it was the first time that the Sublime Porte recognized Rudolf II as equal of the padishah. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774, gave similar concessions to the Russian Empire.

===In Ottoman sources===
According to Ahmedi&#x27;s &quot;İskendernâme&quot;, one of the earliest Ottoman sources, alongside the titles sultan and beg, Orhan and Murad I bore the title padishah as well.

<doc id="1075179" wikidata="Q10358895" url="?curid=1075179" title="Regulome">
<text>Regulome refers to the whole set of regulatory components in a cell. Those components can be regulatory elements, genes, mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites. The description includes the interplay of regulatory effects between these components, and their dependence on variables such as subcellular localization, tissue, developmental stage, and pathological state.

== Components ==

One of the major players in cellular regulation are transcription factors, proteins that regulate the expression of genes. Other proteins that bind to transcription factors to form transcriptional complexes might modify the activity of transcription factors, for example blocking their capacity to bind to a promoter.

Signaling pathways are groups of proteins that produce an effect in a chain that transmit a signal from one part of the cell to another part, for example, linking the presence of substance at the exterior of the cell to the activation of the expression of a gene.

== Measuring ==

High-throughput technologies for the analysis of biological samples (for example, DNA microarrays, proteomics analysis) allow the measurement of thousands of biological components such as mRNAs, proteins, or metabolites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of transcription factors can be used to map transcription factor binding sites in the genome.

Such techniques allow researchers to study the effects of particular substances and/or situations on a cellular sample at a genomic level (for example, by addition of a drug, or by placing cells in a situation of stress). The information obtained allows parts of the regulome to be inferred.

== Modeling ==

One of the objectives of systems biology is the modeling of biological processes using mathematics and computer simulation. The production of data from techniques of genomic analysis is not always amenable to interpretation mainly due to the complexity of the data and the large number of data points. Modeling can handle the data and allow to test a hypothesis (for example, gene A is regulated by protein B) that can be verified experimentally.

== Applications ==

The complete knowledge of the regulome will allow researchers to model cell behaviour entirely. This will facilitate the design of drugs for therapy, the control of stem cell differentiation, and the prognosis of disease.

<text>Jan Letzel (9 April 1880 – 26 December 1925) was a Czech architect who was active in early 20th century Japan. He is most famous for designing the Hiroshima Products Exhibition Hall that was partially destroyed in the atomic bombing of the city. The ruins of the Exhibition Hall is now the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, also known as the A-Bomb Dome, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Biography==
Jan Letzel was born in the town of Náchod, Bohemia. His parents were hotel owners Jan Letzel and his wife Walburga, &quot;née&quot; Havlíčková. After completion of training in the construction department of the Higher Vocational School in 1899, he took the post of assistant in the Department of Civil Engineering of the State Industrial School in Pardubice. In 1901 he won a scholarship to study architecture at the School of Applied Arts in Prague, where he studied for three years under Jan Kotěra, one of the founders of modern Czech architecture. In 1902 and 1903 he undertook study tours in Bohemia, Dalmatia, Montenegro and Herzegovina. From June 1904 to August 1905 he worked at architectural firm Quido Bělský in Prague. At the same time he designed and built a sanatorium and a pavilion in the Art Nouveau style in Mšené-lázně. In October 1905 he received his mediation and worked in Cairo for a while. In the spring of 1907 he went back to Prague after visiting Rome, Milan, Venice, and other Italian cities. Letzel&#x27;s next work was in Japan. After a short stay in Prague and Náchod, he arrived in Tokyo in June 1907, where he worked at a French architectural firm.

Letzel and his friend Karel Hora founded their own architectural firm in 1910 in Tokyo. In the next few years he designed about 40 buildings, including the French school, Sacre Coeur in Tokyo, the Jesuit College, the German embassy, and several hotels and office buildings. His most famous design was the huge administrative building of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Hiroshima, now the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. Hiroshima at that time was dominated by two-story wooden buildings, and the Promotional Hall, with its large size soon became one of Hiroshima&#x27;s most striking landmarks. It became famous after surviving the atomic attack on the city in 1945. It was rededicated, still as a ruin, as the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, otherwise known as the &quot;A-Bomb Dome&quot;. Letzel himself never lived to see the transformation of his Industrial Promotion Hall into the A-Bomb Dome.

When his partner Karel Hora returned to Bohemia in 1913, Letzel led the architecture firm alone, but in 1915 he had to give up the work due to World War I. In 1918, Czechoslovakia became an independent country; Letzel was appointed commercial attaché at the Czechoslovak embassy in Tokyo in 1919. In March 1920 he returned home, but went back to Japan few months later for his attaché post.

In November 1922, Letzel traveled to Japan and later witnessed the destruction of many of his buildings in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Deeply disappointed, he returned to Prague in November 1923 and died a few years later at the age of 45. The firebombing raids on Japan also destroyed many of his buildings, especially those in major cities such as Kobe or Tokyo. Much of Letzel&#x27;s work in Japan did not survive the 20th century.

<doc id="1075183" wikidata="Q311164" url="?curid=1075183" title="Şehzade Ertuğrul Osman">
<text>Şehzade Ertuğrul Osman Efendi (), also known as Osman Ertuğrul Osmanoğlu with a surname as required by the Turkish Republic (18 August 1912 – 23 September 2009), was a Prince of the Ottoman Empire and the 43rd Head of the Imperial House of Osman from 1994 until his death.

Until the abolition of the monarchy on 1 November 1922, Osman was addressed as His Imperial Highness Şehzade Ertuğrul Osman Efendi Hazretleri, Imperial Prince of the Ottoman Empire. He is known in Turkey as &quot;the Last Ottoman&quot;.

==Biography==
Şehzade Ertuğrul Osman was born on 18 August 1912 in Istanbul, in Nişantaşı Palace. He was the second and youngest son of Şehzade Mehmed Burhaneddin (Yıldız Palace, 19 December 1885 – New York City, United States, 15 June 1949, and buried in Damascus). His father served as a Captain of the Ottoman Army. Ertuğrul Osman&#x27;s mother was Burhaneddin&#x27;s second consort, Aliye Melek Nazlıyar Hanım (Adapazarı, 13 October 1892 – Ankara, 31 August 1976), daughter of Hüseyin Bey. They married at Nişantaşı, Nişantaşı Palace, Pera (today Beyoğlu) on 7 June 1909 and divorced in 1919. Osman&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Sultan Abdul Hamid II and Mezidemestan Kadın.

In 1924, while studying in Vienna, Austria, he received news that all members of the Sultan&#x27;s family were to be exiled. He lived in the United States from 1933 and later resided in New York City. He was educated at the Sciences Po Paris. He worked as a consultant for a Canadian company Wells Overseas which often sent him to South America.

Osman lived modestly in Manhattan after 1945, residing in a two-bedroom apartment above a restaurant. He returned to Turkey in 1992, having been invited by the country&#x27;s government. At that time, he observed, &quot;Democracy works well in Turkey.&quot; He became the 43rd Head of the Imperial House of Osman in 1994.

Osman was granted a Turkish passport and citizenship in 2004.

Osman spoke Turkish, English, German and French fluently and understood Italian and Spanish.

He died aged 97 on 23 September 2009 from kidney failure in his sleep. The Prince had spent one week in Istanbul&#x27;s Memorial hospital at the time of his death. Osman&#x27;s funeral was held at the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul on 26 September. His body was interred next to his grandfather Sultan Abdul Hamid II in Istanbul&#x27;s Çemberlitaş neighborhood. His coffin was draped with the Imperial Ottoman Standard and his funeral was attended by Turkish Government Ministers. The Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey and the President of the Republic of Turkey both sent condolences to the Imperial family. The Prime Minister also later visited Osman&#x27;s widow at a former Imperial Palace to express his condolences.

==Marriages==
He was married twice, first in New York City, New York County, New York, on 20 January 1947 to Gulda Twerskoy (Johannesburg, South Africa, 20 March 1915 – New York City, 16 September 1985), without issue. His second wife, whom he married on a football pitch, on 27 September 1991, also without issue, Zeynep Tarzi (born Istanbul, 16 December 1940), is the daughter of Abdulfettah Tarzi, nephew-in-law of the former King of Afghanistan, Amanullah Khan, and of Pakize Tarzi, a pioneering Turkish gynaecologist from a deep-rooted Ottoman family. He was married to Zeynep until his death at 97 years of age.

<text>Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor is an interactive fiction video game written by Brian Moriarty and released by Infocom in 1987. It was one of the last games in the Zork series developed by Infocom (titles such as &quot;Zork Nemesis&quot; and &quot;&quot; were created after Activision had dissolved Infocom as a company and kept the Infocom brand name). It signified a notable departure from the standard format of Infocom&#x27;s earlier games which relied purely on text and puzzle-solving: among other features, &quot;Beyond Zork&quot; incorporated a crude on-screen map, the use of character statistics and levels, and RPG combat elements.

The game, Infocom&#x27;s twenty-ninth, was available on the Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 128, IBM PC compatibles, and Macintosh. &quot;Beyond Zork&quot; was one of 20 Infocom games bundled in the 1991 compilation &quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot; published by Activision.

==Plot==
The player explores the Southlands of Quendor somewhat aimlessly at first. Soon, however, a task is bestowed by the Implementors, a group of godlike creatures jokingly based on Infocom&#x27;s game designers. The Coconut of Quendor, a mighty artifact that embodies the whole of Magic, has fallen into the claws of an unspeakably foul beast: an Ur-grue. Rumoured to be the spirits of fallen Implementors, Ur-Grues can surround themselves in a sphere of darkness that only sunlight can pierce. The player must recover the Coconut from this monster&#x27;s grasp or face the unthinkable consequences.

===Ur-grue===

&quot;Beyond Zork&quot; introduces the &quot;Ur-grue&quot;, a being which game materials describe as the progenitor and ruler of the monstrous race of grues—the term &quot;Ur-grue&quot; combines the German prefix ur- signifying &quot;original&quot; and &quot;grue&quot;—as well as the source of many other evil monsters. He is said to have originated as the shade of a &quot;fallen Implementor&quot;.

The Ur-grue is revealed to be the primary villain of the story. The player, sent to retrieve the Coconut of Quendor from the Implementors, arrives at the Implementors&#x27; Luncheon on the Ethereal Plane of Atrii only to find he has been followed by the Ur-grue in shadow form, who takes the opportunity to steal it for himself. The player must then venture into the Ur-grue&#x27;s extensive underground lair and retrieve it.

The Ur-grue is shown to be a dungeon master of sorts, controlling huge parts of the &quot;Zork&quot; underground and having accumulated an enormous hoard of treasure, of which the Coconut is his crowning acquisition. He has not only an army of grues at his disposal but also bizarre creatures of evil such as Lucksuckers, spirits who attack the player by draining his good fortune (reducing his Luck stat). The Ur-grue himself is surrounded by a pool of magical darkness that is capable of overcoming and destroying all artificial light sources, and is therefore only vulnerable to pure sunlight—the player, therefore, can only best him by using a series of mirrors to transmit a beam of light at him from outside the dungeon.

After doing so, the Ur-grue&#x27;s shadowy form is dissipated revealing what may be his true form, that of a broken, withered old man. It is implied that the Ur-grue cannot survive long in this form and must possess others&#x27; bodies, like a demon, in order to survive—he attempts to possess the player. If he succeeds, a negative ending is revealed where the possessed player-character finds and strangles baby grues until he finds one strong enough to hold the Ur-grue&#x27;s essence, implying that the Ur-grue&#x27;s usual shadowy form is an enhanced version of a grue&#x27;s body.

If the player&#x27;s Compassion stat is high enough—represented by having done enough good deeds throughout the game—the Ur-grue is shown to be unable to possess the player, his evil apparently unable to coexist in the same body with an extremely pure or virtuous spirit, and the Ur-grue&#x27;s old man form fades away. Whether this means the Ur-grue was permanently destroyed in this encounter is unclear, as is the possibility of others of his kind existing somewhere in the world, although, being magical in nature, it seems unlikely any Ur-grues could survive in Quendor following the Great Change.

==Feelies==
Almost since the company&#x27;s beginning, Infocom&#x27;s games included &quot;extras&quot; (called feelies) in the packages, often serving a dual purpose of entertainment and copy protection. &quot;Beyond Zork&quot; is no exception. The game package contained:
*A large fold-out map of the &quot;Southland of Quendor&quot;
*A small book titled &quot;The Lore and Legends of Quendor&quot;, a field guide of sorts to the flora and fauna of the area (several entries contained the information necessary to defeat or incapacitate creatures in the game)

==Notes==
&quot;Beyond Zork&quot; combined procedural generation and character creation with a very plot-heavy story, as the player&#x27;s scores affected not just numerical gameplay mechanics, but crucial puzzles as well. The game&#x27;s mechanics combine the engine of a broader puzzle-based adventure game with areas featuring the mechanics of a simplified role-playing game or Multi-User Dungeon, particularly in the implementations of character statistics and levels. The &quot;attributes&quot; that affected the character were endurance, strength, dexterity, intelligence, compassion, and luck. These attributes could be manually allocated by the player at the beginning of the game or randomly set by the computer. Additionally, there were several preset characters that could be used. The values of these attributes affected combat and other aspects of the game. Combat sections of the game were dependent on the player&#x27;s strength, dexterity, and endurance (and slightly on luck); meanwhile, puzzles often depended not just on solving a creative puzzle but on a required value in any one of the six statistics as well.

The game&#x27;s design encouraged multiple playthroughs. The map was presented nonlinearly, and some paths and interactions required a high statistic to successfully complete the task. Every statistic could unlock at least one, and usually several, crucial puzzles and solutions; but the player would find him or herself at a disadvantage in others. For example, an intelligent player character could read the words on magical scrolls, and use magical items, from early on in the game - this allowed the wide-ranging traversal of the map and the completion of many plot points, but the value required generally meant taking points away from the combat statistics. A dexterous character could traverse paths and enter rooms unavailable to the clumsy. Some enemies did not damage the character&#x27;s hit points but instead their other statistics, and &quot;dying&quot; due to a non-hit-point statistic score falling to zero resulted in interesting death sequences. All values could be improved to the required solution values by gaining experience levels, eating or drinking certain foods or magical items, or wearing or using certain objects. Every playthrough of the game was different, due to procedural generation of maze-like dungeon areas, and many items that could actually unlock puzzles were semi-randomly placed. Puzzles for which the easiest solution was disallowed by a low statistic required either raising that statistic through items and exploration, or alternate solutions not dependent on player scores, with some of these solutions quite obscure and/or requiring wide-ranging map traversal. (Humorously, repeated typing of profanities would lower the player&#x27;s intelligence.)

==Technical details==
The game&#x27;s most noticeable enhancement relative to its Infocom predecessors is the addition of an onscreen map to the heads-up display, which shows the player&#x27;s location in relation to the surrounding area. In addition, game navigation can be accomplished via mouse clicks on the map, if the operating system that the game is running on supports mouse input.

In addition, the game continued the &quot;Zork&quot; series&#x27; early use of procedural generation in videogaming. A number of magic items have initial locations and descriptions that are randomly determined, and some sections of the area map are randomly reorganized, each time a new game is played. Role-playing game-like elements are also present in combat, including the concept of hit points and character statistics. Infocom had used these concepts before only in a rather limited way in &quot;Zork I&quot; and &quot;III&quot;.

Like Infocom&#x27;s other games, &quot;Beyond Zork&quot; is platform independent and runs on a virtual computer architecture called the Z-machine. There were 4 versions of the game released in 1987, all using version 5 of the Z-machine. The game has 144 rooms and 77 objects, with a vocabulary of 1569 words and a total of 32778 opcodes.

==Reception==

A review in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; was pleased with some of &quot;Beyond Zork&quot;&#x27;s features, particularly the ability to define macros and bind them to the function keys. The randomness of the game was described as frustrating, particularly as maps and item properties randomize upon restoring a previous game save. The review concluded by describing &quot;Beyond Zork&quot; as &quot;a curious hybrid... mostly tough Infocom adventure with a patina of role-playing elements.&quot; In 1993 the magazine stated that the game&#x27;s &quot;merging of CRPG with adventure does not mix as well as it should&quot;. The game was reviewed in 1988 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 5 stars. &quot;Compute!&quot; stated that the game&#x27;s combination of text adventure and RPG &quot;introduces the next stage in interactive fiction&quot;. It concluded, &quot;&quot;Beyond Zork&quot; reaffirms Infocom&#x27;s position as king of the text adventures&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot; stated that &quot;this hack-and-slash approach is not what we have come to expect from Infocom&quot;. While approving of Undo and other user interface improvements, the magazine disliked the loss of &quot;exactly what Infocom writers do best—lots of descriptive text with a loving eye for detail that adds a sense of realism to good adventures&quot;. The reviewer concluded, &quot;if adding these bells and whistles cuts into the heart of your product, is the trade-off worth it?&quot;

&quot;Macworld&quot; named &quot;Beyond Zork&quot; runner-up (alongside &quot;Police Quest&quot;) to &quot;The Colony&quot; as Best Adventure Game in the 1988 &quot;Macworld&quot; Game Hall of Fame. &quot;Macworld&quot; called the game &quot;a triumphant return by the Infocom adventure series to its dungeon roots, with myriad improvements on the original.&quot;

<text>The Palestine Children&#x27;s Relief Fund (PCRF) is a registered 501(c)(3) non-governmental organization established in 1991, by, according to its website, &quot;concerned people in the U.S. to address the medical and humanitarian crisis facing Palestinian youths in the Middle East.&quot; The main objective of the PCRF is to locate in the United States and Europe free medical care for children who cannot be adequately treated in the Middle East. Since 1991, tens of thousands of young people have received medical treatment through the PCRF. 

The PCRF was founded by Steve Sosebee, who served as the organization&#x27;s President for 30 years.

==Humanitarian activities==
The Palestine Children&#x27;s Relief Fund sends medical equipment, supplies, and American medical personnel to the region to treat difficult cases and train Palestinian surgeons. Several injured or sick children are being treated in the U.S. for free. The PCRF relies on volunteers throughout the U.S. who act as host families and donors. The organization also helps suffering children from other Middle Eastern nations, based on medical need. The PCRF has built two pediatric cancer departments in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In addition to physical medical care, the PCRF operates a mental health program in Gaza.
==History==
===1991: Establishment===
The Palestine Children&#x27;s Relief Fund was established in 1991. It was founded by Steve Sosebee, a former journalist who, while on assignment in Hebron, brought Palestinian children in need to Akron, Ohio, to receive free medical care. Sosebee later met Huda al Masry, a Palestinian social worker with the YMCA in Jerusalem. Sosebee and al Masry married in 1993, and had two daughters.

===2004–2007: Attempted donation by the Holy Land Foundation, and &quot;Open Heart&quot;===
In 2004, the Holy Land Foundation—a group which was shut down by the United States government because it was suspected of funneling donations to terrorist organizations—attempted to make a donation of $50,000 to the PCRF. Steve Sosebee, president of the PCRF, said at the time that if the PCRF received the donation, the money would be used to fund its relief services. That same year, NBC televised the fictional film &quot;Homeland Security&quot; featuring a scene in which the PCRF is referred to as a terrorist organization and &quot;a front for Islamic Jihad&quot;. As a result, Sosebee received numerous phone calls and e-mails asking about how the PCRF uses its funds.

In 2006, the PCRF, in cooperation with the British Arts Council, produced the 22-minute documentary film &quot;Open Heart&quot;. Directed by Claire Fowler, the film is about a nine-month-old boy named Jamal with congenital heart disease, and the efforts by his family, a British surgeon, and the PCRF to provide him treatment.

===2009–2020: Pediatric cancer units===
In 2009, al Masry died of cancer, and Sosebee moved to Palestine with his daughters. There, the PCRF built the first public pediatric cancer department in Bethlehem, and named it after al Masry. In 2016, Sosebee married pediatric oncologist Dr. Zeena Salman. In February 2019, the PCRF built a second cancer department, this time in the Gaza Strip.

===2021–present: Ongoing work===
During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, online streamers and other online content creators on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube held fundraisers in support of the PCRF, most notably Vaush, who raised $292,284.71. On 17 May 2021, Israeli airstrikes damaged PCRF offices in Gaza City. In November 2023, the al-Rantisi hospital in Gaza City, which is run by the PCRF, was struck by an Israeli airstrike, killing eight people and damaging the building.

On November 16, 2023, PCRF awarded America Near East Refugee Aid, in partnership with World Central Kitchen, a $1.5 million grant to provide hot meals for distribution to displaced individuals in Gaza during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

Founder Steve Sosebee departed the organization on December 31, 2023, after serving 30 years, to pursue other humanitarian efforts in Palestine.

==Reception==
, PCRF has held a four-star charity rating since September 2012 from Charity Navigator, an independent evaluator of charities&#x27; fiscal management. The organization has received support and endorsements from U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes, former U.S. Congressman Albert Wynn, and actor and humanitarian Richard Gere.

In October 2006, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter issued a video endorsement of the organization.

<doc id="1075193" wikidata="Q6770069" url="?curid=1075193" title="Mark Twain's Library of Humor">
<text>Mark Twain&#x27;s Library of Humor is an 1888 anthology of short humorous works compiled by Mark Twain, pen name of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, William Dean Howells and Charles Hopkins Clark.

In 1880, George Gebbie suggested to Mark Twain that he publish an anthology of humorous works. The idea evolved into a project financed by Clemens to produce an anthology of American humor with himself as editor and Howells and Clark assisting. Clemens did the least work on the project but remained in control and had the final say in everything. He realized how minor his role had been and wanted to put Howells&#x27;s name on the title page. However, a legal agreement with Harper and Brothers prevented this, stipulating that Howells&#x27; name would only appear on their publications. Harper and Brothers wanted US$2,500 (approximately $50,000 with inflation) for a release, compelling Howells to sign the Introduction as &quot;The Associate Editors.&quot; The book was published in 1888 by Charles L. Webster &amp; Company. When that firm collapsed in 1894, Harper and Brothers took over the publication of all of Clemens&#x27; work. The &quot;Library of Humor&quot; was a valuable piece, containing many copyrighted works by many distinguished and popular authors. Secretary of Harper and Brothers Frederick A. Duneka had it revamped and expanded by Burges Johnson for a multi-volume revival in 1906. The title and Apology were kept, but the result was wildly different; Clemens&#x27;s reaction is suggested by the title of Johnson&#x27;s Fall 1937 article in the &quot;Mark Twain Quarterly&quot;, &quot;When Mark Twain Cursed Me.&quot; One authority has even stated that it should be called &quot;The Harper Library of Humor&quot;.

<text>José Manuel Bastos Fialho Gouveia (30 April 1935 – 2 October 2004) was a Portuguese television entertainment pioneer and former radio host, having hosted Portugal&#x27;s first television talk show.

Born in Montijo, the son of a railroad company employee and an elementary school teacher, Gouveia studied Romance Philology at the University of Lisbon, but dropped out for a career in radio. 

Known for a 30-year career in radio and TV, Gouveia hosted &quot;Zip Zip&quot;, Portugal&#x27;s first talk show, in 1969, alongside Carlos Cruz and Raúl Solnado. The show made him instantly famous and is still considered a landmark in the history of Portuguese television. Gouveia was also a popular host for other programs, namely game shows, working with Cruz behind the cameras, and became one of the mainstays of Portugal&#x27;s RTP up to the early 1990s.

After being admitted to hospital in Coimbra, on 24 August 2004, for bacteria-induced respiratory and circulatory problems, Gouveia died from multiple organ failure. He was first married to Maria Helena Varela Santos (the first TV announcer in Portugal), with whom he had two children: Paulo and Maria João. Later, he married Beatriz, the mother of his third child, José Eduardo Fialho Gouveia, who is also a television presenter (&quot;Bairro Alto&quot;, RTP) and journalist (Sol).

<text>Australian literature is the written or literary work produced in the area or by the people of the Commonwealth of Australia and its preceding colonies. During its early Western history, Australia was a collection of British colonies; as such, its recognised literary tradition begins with and is linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, the narrative art of Australian writers has, since 1788, introduced the character of a new continent into literature—exploring such themes as Aboriginality, &quot;mateship&quot;, egalitarianism, democracy, national identity, migration, Australia&#x27;s unique location and geography, the complexities of urban living, and &quot;the beauty and the terror&quot; of life in the Australian bush.

==Overview==

Australian writers who have obtained international renown include the Nobel-winning author Patrick White, as well as authors Christina Stead, David Malouf, Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally, Colleen McCullough, Nevil Shute and Morris West. Notable contemporary expatriate authors include the feminist Germaine Greer, art historian Robert Hughes and humorists Barry Humphries and Clive James.

Among the important authors of classic Australian works are the poets Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson, C. J. Dennis and Dorothea Mackellar. Dennis wrote in the Australian vernacular, while Mackellar wrote the iconic patriotic poem&quot; My Country&quot;. Lawson and Paterson clashed in the famous &quot;Bulletin Debate&quot; over the nature of life in Australia with Lawson considered to have the harder edged view of the Bush and Paterson the romantic. Lawson is widely regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s greatest writers of short stories, while Paterson&#x27;s poems remain amongst the most popular Australian bush poems. Significant poets of the 20th century included Dame Mary Gilmore, Kenneth Slessor, A. D. Hope and Judith Wright. Among the best known contemporary poets are Les Murray and Bruce Dawe, whose poems are often studied in Australian high schools.

Novelists of classic Australian works include Marcus Clarke (&quot;For the Term of His Natural Life&quot;), Miles Franklin (&quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;), Henry Handel Richardson (&quot;The Fortunes of Richard Mahony&quot;), Joseph Furphy (&quot;Such Is Life&quot;), Rolf Boldrewood (&quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot;) and Ruth Park (&quot;The Harp in the South&quot;). In terms of children&#x27;s literature, Norman Lindsay (&quot;The Magic Pudding&quot;), Mem Fox (&quot;Possum Magic&quot;), and May Gibbs (&quot;Snugglepot and Cuddlepie&quot;) are among the Australian classics, while Melina Marchetta (&quot;Looking for Alibrandi&quot;) is a modern YA classic. Eminent Australian playwrights have included Ray Lawler, David Williamson, Alan Seymour and Nick Enright. Among prominent short story writers are Steele Rudd, Henry Lawson, Beverley Farmer, Kate Grenville, and Helen Garner.

Although historically only a small proportion of Australia&#x27;s population have lived outside the major cities, many of Australia&#x27;s most distinctive stories and legends originate in the outback, in the drovers and squatters and people of the barren, dusty plains.

David Unaipon is known as the first Aboriginal author. Oodgeroo Noonuccal was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse. A ground-breaking memoir about the experiences of the Stolen Generations can be found in Sally Morgan&#x27;s &quot;My Place&quot;.

Charles Bean, Geoffrey Blainey, Robert Hughes, Manning Clark, Claire Wright, and Marcia Langton are authors of important Australian histories.

== Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander writers and themes ==
Writing by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people

While his father, James Unaipon (c.1835-1907), contributed to accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by the missionary George Taplin, David Unaipon (1872–1967) provided the first accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by an Aboriginal: &quot;Legendary Tales of the Aborigines&quot;. For this he is known as the first Aboriginal author. Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920–1993) was a famous Aboriginal poet, writer and rights activist credited with publishing the first Aboriginal book of verse: &quot;We Are Going&quot; (1964). Sally Morgan&#x27;s novel &quot;My Place&quot; was considered a breakthrough memoir in terms of bringing indigenous stories to wider notice. Leading Aboriginal activists Marcia Langton (First Australians, 2008) and Noel Pearson (&quot;Up from the Mission&quot;, 2009) are active contemporary contributors to Australian literature.

The voices of Indigenous Australians are being increasingly recognised and include the playwright Jack Davis and Kevin Gilbert. Writers coming to prominence in the 21st century include Kim Scott, Alexis Wright, Kate Howarth, Tara June Winch, Yvette Holt and Anita Heiss. Indigenous authors who have won Australia&#x27;s high prestige Miles Franklin Award include Kim Scott who was joint winner (with Thea Astley) in 2000 for &quot;Benang&quot; and again in 2011 for &quot;That Deadman Dance.&quot; Alexis Wright won the award in 2007 for her novel &quot;Carpentaria.&quot; Melissa Lucashenko won the award in 2019 for her novel &quot;Too Much Lip&quot;, which was also short-listed for the Stella Prize for Australian women&#x27;s writing.

Letters written by notable Aboriginal leaders like Bennelong and Sir Douglas Nicholls are also retained as treasures of Australian literature, as is the historic Yirrkala bark petitions of 1963 which is the first traditional Aboriginal document recognised by the Australian Parliament. AustLit&#x27;s BlackWords project provides a comprehensive listing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Writers and Storytellers.

Writing about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
At the point of the first colonization, Indigenous Australians had not developed a system of writing, so the first literary accounts of Aboriginal people come from the journals of early European explorers, which contain descriptions of first contact, both violent and friendly. Early accounts by Dutch explorers and by the English buccaneer William Dampier wrote of the &quot;natives of New Holland&quot; as being &quot;barbarous savages&quot;, but by the time of Captain James Cook and First Fleet marine Watkin Tench (the era of Jean-Jacques Rousseau), accounts of Aborigines were more sympathetic and romantic: &quot;these people may truly be said to be in the pure state of nature, and may appear to some to be the most wretched upon the earth; but in reality they are far happier than ... we Europeans&quot;, wrote Cook in his journal on 23 August 1770.

Many notable works have been written by non-indigenous Australians on Aboriginal themes. Examples include the poems of Judith Wright; &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot; by Thomas Keneally, &quot;Ilbarana&quot; by Donald Stuart, and the short story by David Malouf: &quot;The Only Speaker of his Tongue&quot;. Histories covering Indigenous themes include Watkin Tench (Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay et Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson); Roderick J. Flanagan (&quot;The Aborigines of Australia&quot;, 1888); &quot;The Native Tribes of Central Australia&quot; by Spencer and Gillen, 1899; the diaries of Donald Thomson on the subject of the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land (c.1935-1943); Alan Moorehead (&quot;The fatal Impact&quot;, 1966); Geoffrey Blainey (&quot;Triumph of the Nomads&quot;, 1975); Henry Reynolds (&quot;The Other Side of the Frontier&quot;, 1981); and Marcia Langton (First Australians, 2008). Differing interpretations of Aboriginal history are also the subject of contemporary debate in Australia, notably between the essayists Robert Manne and Keith Windschuttle.

== Early and classic works ==

For centuries before the British settlement of Australia, European writers wrote fictional accounts of an imagining of a &quot;Great Southern Land&quot;. In 1642 Abel Janszoon Tasman landed in Tasmania and after examining notches cut at considerable distances on tree trunks, speculated that the newly discovered country must be peopled by giants. Later, the British satirist, Jonathan Swift, set the land of the Houyhnhnms of Gulliver&#x27;s Travels to the west of Tasmania. In 1797 the British Romantic poet Robert Southey—then a young Jacobin—included a section in his collection, &quot;Poems&quot;, a selection of poems under the heading, &quot;Botany Bay Eclogues,&quot; in which he portrayed the plight and stories of transported convicts in New South Wales.

Among the first true works of literature produced in Australia were the accounts of the settlement of Sydney by Watkin Tench, a captain of the marines on the First Fleet to arrive in 1788. In 1819, poet, explorer, journalist and politician William Wentworth published the first book written by an Australian: &quot;A Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America&quot;, in which he advocated an elected assembly for New South Wales, trial by jury and settlement of Australia by free emigrants rather than convicts.

The first novel to be published in Australia was a crime novel, &quot;Quintus Servinton: A Tale founded upon Incidents of Real Occurrence&quot; by Henry Savery published in Hobart in 1830. Early popular works tended to be the &#x27;ripping yarn&#x27; variety, telling tales of derring-do against the new frontier of the Australian outback. Writers such as Rolf Boldrewood (&quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot;), Marcus Clarke (&quot;For the Term of His Natural Life&quot;), Henry Handel Richardson (&quot;The Fortunes of Richard Mahony&quot;) and Joseph Furphy (&quot;Such Is Life&quot;) embodied these stirring ideals in their tales and, particularly the latter, tried to accurately record the vernacular language of the common Australian. These novelists also gave valuable insights into the penal colonies which helped form the country and also the early rural settlements.

In 1838 &quot;The Guardian: a tale&quot; by Anna Maria Bunn was published in Sydney. It was the first Australian novel printed and published in mainland Australia and the first Australian novel written by a woman. It is a Gothic romance.

Miles Franklin (&quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;) and Jeannie Gunn (&quot;We of the Never Never&quot;) wrote of lives of European pioneers in the Australian bush from a female perspective. Albert Facey wrote of the experiences of the Goldfields and of Gallipoli (&quot;A Fortunate Life&quot;). Ruth Park wrote of the sectarian divisions of life in impoverished 1940s inner city Sydney (&quot;The Harp in the South&quot;). The experience of Australian PoWs in the Pacific War is recounted by Nevil Shute in &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; and in the autobiography of Sir Edward Dunlop. Alan Moorehead was an Australian war correspondent and novelist who gained international acclaim.

A number of notable classic works by international writers deal with Australian subjects, among them D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Kangaroo&quot;. The journals of Charles Darwin contain the famous naturalist&#x27;s first impressions of Australia, gained on his tour aboard the Beagle that inspired his writing of On the Origin of Species. &quot;The Wayward Tourist: Mark Twain&#x27;s Adventures in Australia&quot; contains the acclaimed American humourist&#x27;s musings on Australia from his 1895 lecture tour.

In 2012, &quot;The Age&quot; reported that Text Publishing was releasing an Australian classics series in 2012, to address a &quot;neglect of Australian literature&quot; by universities and &quot;British dominated&quot; publishing houses—citing out of print Miles Franklin award winners such as David Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Canoe&quot; and Sumner Locke Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Careful, He Might Hear You&quot; as key examples.

==Children&#x27;s literature==
Ethel Turner&#x27;s &quot;Seven Little Australians&quot;, which relates the adventures of seven mischievous children in Sydney, has been in print since 1894, longer than any other Australian children&#x27;s novel. &quot;The Getting of Wisdom&quot; (1910) by Henry Handel Richardson, about an unconventional schoolgirl in Melbourne, has enjoyed a similar success and been praised by H. G. Wells and Germaine Greer.

Other perennial favourites of Australian children&#x27;s literature include Dorothy Wall&#x27;s &quot;Blinky Bill&quot;, Ethel Pedley&#x27;s &quot;Dot and the Kangaroo&quot;, May Gibbs&#x27; &quot;Snugglepot and Cuddlepie&quot;, Norman Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot;, Ruth Park&#x27;s &quot;The Muddleheaded Wombat&quot; and Mem Fox&#x27;s &quot;Possum Magic&quot;. These classic works employ anthropomorphism to bring alive the creatures of the Australian bush, thus Bunyip Bluegum of &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot; is a koala who leaves his tree in search of adventure, while in &quot;Dot and the Kangaroo&quot; a little girl lost in the bush is befriended by a group of marsupials. May Gibbs crafted a story of protagonists modelled on the appearance of young eucalyptus (gum tree) nuts and pitted these &quot;gumnut babies&quot;, Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, against the antagonist Banksia men. Gibbs&#x27; influence has lasted through the generations – contemporary children&#x27;s author Ursula Dubosarsky has cited &quot;Snugglepot and Cuddlepie&quot; as one of her favourite books.

In the middle of the twentieth century, children&#x27;s literature languished, with popular British authors dominating the Australian market. But in the 1960s Oxford University Press published several Australian children&#x27;s authors, and Angus &amp; Robertson appointed their first specialist children&#x27;s editor. The best-known writers to emerge in this period were Hesba Brinsmead, Ivan Southall, Colin Thiele, Patricia Wrightson, Nan Chauncy, Joan Phipson and Eleanor Spence, their works primarily set in the Australian landscape. In 1971, Southall won the Carnegie Medal for &quot;Josh&quot;. In 1986, Patricia Wrightson received the international Hans Christian Andersen Award.

The Children&#x27;s Book Council of Australia has presented annual awards for books of literary merit since 1946 and has other awards for outstanding contributions to Australian children&#x27;s literature. Notable winners and shortlisted works have inspired several well-known Australian films from original novels, including the Silver Brumby series, a collection by Elyne Mitchell which recount the life and adventures of Thowra, a Snowy Mountains brumby stallion; &quot;Storm Boy&quot; (1964), by Colin Thiele, about a boy and his pelican and the relationships he has with his father, the pelican, and an outcast Aboriginal man called Fingerbone; the Sydney-based Victorian era time travel adventure &quot;Playing Beatie Bow&quot; (1980) by Ruth Park; and, for older children and mature readers, Melina Marchetta&#x27;s 1993 novel about a Sydney high school girl &quot;Looking for Alibrandi&quot;. Robin Klein&#x27;s &quot;Came Back to Show You I Could Fly&quot; is a story about the beautiful relationship between an eleven-year-old boy and an older, drug-addicted girl.

Jackie French, widely described as Australia&#x27;s most popular children&#x27;s author, has written about 170 books, including two CBCA Children&#x27;s Book of the Year Award winners. One of them, the critically acclaimed &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1999), is a &quot;what if?&quot; story that explores mind-provoking issues about what would have happened if Adolf Hitler had had a daughter. French is also the author of the highly praised &quot;Diary of a Wombat&quot; (2003), which won awards such as the 2003 COOL Award and 2004 BILBY Award, among others. It was also named an honour book for the CBCA Children&#x27;s Book of the Year Award for picture books.

Paul Jennings is a prolific writer of contemporary Australian fiction for young people whose career began with collections of short stories such as &quot;Unreal!&quot; (1985) and &quot;Unbelievable!&quot; (1987); many of the stories were adapted as episodes of the award-winning television show &quot;Round the Twist&quot;.

The world&#x27;s richest prize in children&#x27;s literature has been received by two Australians, Sonya Hartnett, who won the 2008 Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award and Shaun Tan, who won in 2011. Hartnett has a long and distinguished career, publishing her first novel at 15. She is known for her dark and often controversial themes. She has won several awards, including the Kathleen Mitchell Award and the Victorian Premier&#x27;s Award for &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize and the Aurealis Award, Best Young Adult Novel (Australian speculative fiction) for &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Child&quot; and the CBCA Children&#x27;s Book of the Year Award: Older Readers for &quot;Forest&quot;. Tan won this for his career contribution to &quot;children&#x27;s and young adult literature in the broadest sense&quot;. Tan has been awarded various literary awards, including the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 2009 for &quot;Tales from Outer Suburbia&quot; and a New York Times Best Illustrated Children&#x27;s Books award in 2007 for &quot;The Arrival&quot;. Alongside his numerous literary awards, Tan&#x27;s adaption of his book &quot;The Lost Thing&quot; also won him an Oscar for best animated short film. Other awards Tan has won include a World Fantasy Award for Best Artist, and a Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist.

==Expatriate authors==
A generation of leading contemporary international writers who left Australia for Britain and the United States in the 1960s have remained regular and passionate contributors of Australian themed literary works throughout their careers including: Clive James, Robert Hughes, Barry Humphries, Geoffrey Robertson and Germaine Greer. Several of these writers had links to the Sydney Push intellectual sub-culture in Sydney from the late 1940s to the early 1970s; and to &quot;Oz&quot;, a satirical magazine originating in Sydney, and later produced in London (from 1967 to 1973).

After a long media career, Clive James remained a leading humourist and author based in Britain whose memoir series was rich in reflections on Australian society (including his 2007 book &quot;Cultural Amnesia&quot;). Robert Hughes has produced a number of historical works on Australia (including &quot;The Art of Australia&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Fatal Shore&quot; (1987)).

Barry Humphries took his dadaist absurdist theatrical talents and pen to London in the 1960s, becoming an institution on British television and later attaining popularity in the USA. Humphries&#x27; outlandish Australian caricatures, including Dame Edna Everage, Barry McKenzie and Les Patterson have starred in books, stage and screen to great acclaim over five decades and his biographer Anne Pender described him in 2010 as the most significant comedian since Charles Chaplin. His own literary works include the Dame Edna biographies &quot;My Gorgeous Life&quot; (1989) and &quot;Handling Edna&quot; (2010) and the autobiography &quot;My Life As Me: A Memoir&quot; (2002). Geoffrey Robertson KC is a leading international human rights lawyer, academic, author and broadcaster whose books include &quot;The Justice Game&quot; (1998) and &quot;Crimes Against Humanity&quot; (1999). Leading feminist Germaine Greer, author of &quot;The Female Eunuch&quot;, has spent much of her career in England but continues to study, critique, condemn and adore her homeland (recent work includes &quot;Whitefella Jump Up: The Shortest Way to Nationhood&quot;, 2004).

==Other contemporary works and authors==

Martin Boyd (1893–1972) was a distinguished memoirist, novelist and poet, whose works included social comedies and the serious reflections of a pacifist faced with a time of war. Among his Langton series of novels—&quot;The Cardboard Crown&quot; (1952), &quot;A Difficult Young Man&quot; (1955), &quot;Outbreak of Love&quot; (1957)—earned high praise in Britain and the United States, though despite their Australian themes, were largely ignored in Australia.

Patrick White (1912–1990) became the first Australian to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973 &quot;for an epic and psychological narrative art which has introduced a new continent into literature&quot;. White&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Happy Valley&quot; (1939) was inspired by the landscape and his work as a jackaroo on the land at Adaminaby in the Snowy Mountains, but became an international success and won the Australian Literary Society&#x27;s gold medal. Born to a conservative, wealthy Anglo-Australian family, he later wrote of conviction in left-wing causes and lived as a homosexual. Never destined for life on the land, he enrolled at Cambridge where he became a published poet. White developed as a novelist, but also had major theatrical success—including &quot;The Season at Sarsaparilla&quot;. White followed &quot;The Tree of Man&quot; with &quot;Voss&quot;, which became the first winner of the Miles Franklin Award. A subsequent novel, &quot;Riders in the Chariot&quot; also received a Miles Franklin award—but White later refused to permit his novels to be entered for literary prizes. He turned down a knighthood, and various literary awards—but in 1973 accepted the Nobel prize. David Marr wrote of biography of White in 1991.

J. M. Coetzee, who was born in South Africa and was resident there when awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, now lives in Adelaide, South Australia, and is an Australian citizen. Colleen McCullough&#x27;s &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, 1977, is Australia&#x27;s highest selling novel and one of the biggest selling novels of all time with around 30 million copies sold by 2009. Thomas Keneally wrote &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot;, 1972 and &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot;, 1982. This latter work was the inspiration for the film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. Other notable Australian novels converted to celluloid include: Paul Brickhill&#x27;s &quot;The Great Escape&quot;; Pamela Lyndon Travers&#x27; &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;; Morris West&#x27;s &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; and Bryce Courtenay&#x27;s &quot;The Power of One&quot;.

&quot;Careful, He Might Hear You&quot; by Sumner Locke Elliott won the Miles Franklin Award in 1963, and was the subject of a 1983 Australian film. Author David Ireland won the Miles Franklin Award three times, including for &quot;The Glass Canoe&quot; (1976). Peter Carey has also won the Miles Franklin Award three times (&quot;Jack Maggs&quot; 1998; &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot; 1989; and &quot;Bliss&quot; 1981). He has twice won the Booker Prize with 1988&#x27;s &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot; and 2001&#x27;s &quot;True History of the Kelly Gang&quot;. DBC Pierre&#x27;s &quot;Vernon God Little&quot; won the Booker Prize in 2003. Other notable writers to have emerged since the 1970s include Kate Grenville, David Malouf, Helen Garner, Janette Turner Hospital, Marion Halligan, Susan Johnson, Christopher Koch, Alex Miller, Shirley Hazzard, Richard Flanagan, Gerald Murnane, Brenda Walker, Rod Jones and Tim Winton.

James Clavell in &quot;The Asian Saga&quot; discusses an important feature of Australian literature: its portrayal of far eastern culture, from the admittedly even further east, but nevertheless western cultural viewpoint, as Nevil Shute did. Clavell was also a successful screenwriter and along with such writers as Thomas Keneally (see above), has expanded the topics of Australian literature far beyond that one country. Other novelists to use international themes are David Malouf, Beverley Farmer and Rod Jones. &quot;The Secret River&quot; (2005) is an historical fiction by Kate Grenville imagining encounters between Aboriginal and colonial Australia which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. &quot;The Slap&quot; (2008) was an internationally successful novel by Christos Tsiolkas which was adapted for television by ABC1 in 2011, and was described in a review by Gerard Windsor as &quot;something of an anatomy of the rising Australian middle class&quot;.

===1991–1996: Grunge lit===
Grunge lit (an abbreviation for &quot;grunge literature&quot;) is an Australian literary genre usually applied to fictional or semi-autobiographical writing concerned with dissatisfied and disenfranchised young people living in suburban or inner-city surroundings. It was typically written by &quot;new, young authors&quot; who examined &quot;gritty, dirty, real existences&quot;, of lower-income young people, whose lives revolve around a nihilistic pursuit of casual sex, recreational drug use and alcohol, which are used to escape boredom or a general flightiness. Romantic love is seldom, as instant gratification has become the norm. It has been described as both a sub-set of dirty realism and an offshoot of Generation X literature. The term &quot;grunge&quot; is from the 1990s-era music genre of grunge.

The genre was first coined in 1995 following the success of Andrew McGahan&#x27;s first novel &quot;Praise&quot; which had been released in 1991 and became popular with sub-30-year-old readers, a previously under-investigated demographic. Other authors considered to be &quot;grunge lit&quot; include Linda Jaivin, Fiona McGregor and Justine Ettler. Since its invention, the term &quot;grunge lit&quot; has been retrospectively applied to novels written as early as 1977, namely Helen Garner&#x27;s &quot;Monkey Grip&quot;. Grunge lit is often raw, explicit, and vulgar, even to the point of Ettler&#x27;s &quot;The River Ophelia&quot; (1995) being called pornographic.

The term &quot;grunge lit&quot; and its use to categorize and market this diverse group of writers and authorial styles has been the subject of debate and criticism. Linda Jaivin disagreed with putting all these authors in one category, Christios Tsiolkas called the term a &quot;media creation&quot;, and Murray Waldren denied grunge lit even was a new genre; he said the works actually are a type of the pre-existing dirty realism genre.

===1998–2010s: Post-grunge lit===

Post-grunge lit is a genre of Australian fiction from the late 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. It is called &quot;post-grunge lit&quot; to denote that this genre appeared after the 1990s Australian literary genre known as grunge lit. Michael Robert Christie&#x27;s 2009 PhD dissertation, &quot;Unbecoming-of-Age: Australian Grunge Fiction, the Bildungsroman and the Long Labor Decade&quot; states that there is a genre called &quot;post Grunge [lit]&quot; which follows the grunge lit period. Christie names three examples of Australian &quot;post-grunge lit&quot;: Elliot Perlman&#x27;s &quot;Three Dollars&quot; (1998), Andrew McCann&#x27;s &quot;Subtopia&quot; (2005) and Anthony Macris&#x27; &quot;Capital&quot;. Christie&#x27;s dissertation interprets and explains these three post-grunge lit works &quot;as responses to the embedding of Neoliberalism in Australian and global political culture&quot;.

Kalinda Ashton (born 1978) has been called a post-grunge writer, in part due to influences from grunge lit author Christos Tsiolkas. Ashton is the author of the novel &quot;The Danger Game&quot;. Samantha Dagg&#x27;s 2017 thesis on grunge lit and post-grunge lit states that Luke Carman is a post-grunge writer. Carman&#x27;s first work, a collection of interlinked semi-autobiographical short stories, explores the authentic experiences of working-class Australians in the suburbs, including issues such as drug addiction and a sense of disillusionment.

== Australian writing in languages other than English ==

Australia has migrant groups from many countries, and members of those communities (not always of the first generation) have produced Australian writing in a variety of languages. These include Italian, Greek, Arabic, Chinese, Vietnamese, Lao, Filipino, Latvian, Ukrainian, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Yiddish and Irish.

Comparatively little attention has been devoted to such writing by mainstream critics. It has been argued that, in relation to the national literary landscape, such literary communities have a quite separate existence, with their own poetry festivals, literary competitions, magazine and newspaper reviews and features, and even local publishers. Some writers, like the Greek Australian Dimitris Tsaloumas, have published bilingually. There are now signs that such writing is attracting more academic interest. Some older works in languages other than English have been translated and received critical and historical attention long after their first publication; for example, the first Chinese-language novel to be published in Australia (and possibly the West), &quot;The Poison of Polygamy&quot; (1909–10) by Wong Shee Ping, was published in English for the first time in 2019, in a bilingual parallel edition.

== Histories ==

History has been an important discipline in the development of Australian writing. Watkin Tench (1758–1833) - a British officer who arrived with the First Fleet in 1788 - later published two books on the subject of the foundations of New South Wales: &quot;Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay&quot; and &quot;Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson&quot;. Written with a spirit of humanity his accounts are considered by writers including Robert Hughes and Thomas Keneally to be essential reading for the early history of Australia/ Charles Bean was the official war historian of the First World War and was influential in establishing the importance of ANZAC in Australian history and mythology, with such prose as &quot;Anzac stood, and still stands, for reckless valor in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship and endurance, that will never own defeat&quot;. (see works including &quot;The Story of ANZAC: From the Outbreak of War to the End of the First Phase of the Gallipoli Campaign 4 May 1915&quot;, 1921).

&quot;Australia in the War of 1939–1945&quot; is a 22-volume official history dedicated to Australia&#x27;s Second World War efforts. the series was published by the Australian War Memorial between 1952 and 1977. The main editor was Gavin Long. A significant milestone was the historian Manning Clark&#x27;s six-volume &quot;History of Australia&quot;, which is regarded by some as the definitive account of the nation. Clark had a talent for narrative prose and the work (published between 1969 and 1987) remains a popular and influential work. Clark&#x27;s one time student Geoffrey Blainey stands as another to have deeply influenced Australian historiography. His important works include &quot;The Tyranny of Distance&quot; (1966) and &quot;Triumph of the Nomads: A History of Ancient Australia&quot; (1975). Robert Hughes&#x27; much-debated history &quot; The Fatal Shore: The epic of Australia&#x27;s founding&quot; (1987) is a popular and influential work on early Australian history. Marcia Langton is one of the principal contemporary Indigenous Australian academics and her 2008 collaboration with Rachel Perkins chronicles Australian history from an Indigenous perspective: &quot;First Australians. An Illustrated History&quot;.

== Writing and identity ==

A complicated, multi-faceted relationship to Australia is displayed in much Australian writing, often through writing about landscape. Barbara Baynton&#x27;s short stories from the late 19th century/early 20th century convey people living in the bush, a landscape that is alive but also threatening and alienating. Kenneth Cook&#x27;s &quot;Wake in Fright&quot; (1961) portrayed the outback as a nightmare with a blazing sun, from which there is no escape. Colin Thiele&#x27;s novels reflected the life and times of rural and regional Australians in the 20th century, showing aspects of Australian life unknown to many city dwellers.

In Australian literature, the term &quot;mateship&quot; has often been employed to denote an intensely loyal relationship of shared experience, mutual respect and unconditional assistance existing between friends (&quot;mates&quot;) in Australia. This relationship of (often male) loyalty has remained a central subject of Australian literature from colonial times to the present day. In 1847, Alexander Harris wrote of habits of mutual helpfulness between mates arising in the &quot;otherwise solitary bush&quot; in which men would often &quot;stand by one another through thick and thin; in fact it is a universal feeling that a man ought to be able to trust his own mate in anything&quot;. Henry Lawson, a son of the Goldfields wrote extensively of an egalitarian mateship, in such works as &quot;A Sketch of Mateship&quot; and &quot;Shearers&quot;, in which he wrote:

:They tramp in mateship side by side -
:The Protestant and Roman
:They call no biped lord or sir
:And touch their hat to no man.

What it means to be Australian is another issue that Australian literature explores. Miles Franklin struggled to find a place for herself as a female writer in Australia, fictionalising this experience in &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1901). Marie Bjelke Petersen&#x27;s popular romance novels, published between 1917 and 1937, offered a fresh upbeat interpretation of the Australian bush. The central character in Patrick White&#x27;s &quot;The Twyborn Affair&quot; tries to conform to expectations of pre–World War II Australian masculinity but cannot, and instead, post-war, tries out another identity—and gender—overseas. Peter Carey has toyed with the idea of a national Australian identity as a series of &#x27;beautiful lies&#x27;, and this is a recurrent theme in his novels. Andrew McGahan&#x27;s &quot;Praise&quot; (1992), Christos Tsiolkas&#x27;s &quot;Loaded&quot; (1995), Justine Ettler&#x27;s &quot;The River Ophelia&quot; (1995) and Brendan Cowell&#x27;s &quot;How It Feels&quot; (2010) introduced a grunge lit, a type of &#x27;gritty realism&#x27; take on questions of Australian identity in the 1990s, though an important precursor to such work came some years earlier with Helen Garner&#x27;s &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; (1977), about a single mother living on and off with a male heroin addict in Melbourne share housing.

Australian literature has had several scandals surrounding the identity of writers. In the 1930s, a misunderstanding with a printer caused Maude Hepplestone&#x27;s bush poetry collection &quot;Songs of the Kookaburra&quot; to be mistakenly lauded internationally as a modernist masterpiece. The 1944 Ern Malley affair led to an obscenity trial and is often blamed for the lack of modernist poetry in Australia. To mark the 60th anniversary of the Ern Malley affair, another Australian writer, Leon Carmen, set out to make a point about the prejudice of Australian publishers against white Australians. Unable to find publication as a white Australian he was an instant success using the false Aboriginal identity of &quot;Wanda Koolmatrie&quot; with &quot;My Own Sweet Time&quot;. In the 1980s Streten Bozik also managed to become published by assuming the Aboriginal identity of B. Wongar. In the 1990s, Helen Darville used the pen-name &quot;Helen Demidenko&quot; and won major literary prizes for her &quot;Hand that Signed the Paper&quot; before being discovered, sparking a controversy over the content of her novel, a fictionalised and highly tendentious account of the Nazi occupation of Ukraine. Mudrooroo—previously known as Colin Johnson—was acclaimed as an Aboriginal writer until his Aboriginality came under question (his mother was Irish/English and his father was Irish/African-American, however he has strong connections with Aboriginal tribes); he now avoids adopting a specific ethnic identity and his works deconstruct such notions.

== Poetry ==


Poetry played an important part in early Australian literature. The first poet to be published in Australia was Michael Massey Robinson (1744–1826), convict and public servant, whose odes appeared in &quot;The Sydney Gazette&quot;. The first book of verse by a native-born Australian poet, &quot;Australasia&quot;, was published by explorer and author William Charles Wentworth in 1823, espousing his ideals of Australian identity. Charles Harpur and Henry Kendall were the first poets of any consequence.

Henry Lawson, son of a Norwegian sailor born in 1867, was widely recognised as Australia&#x27;s poet of the people and, in 1922, became the first Australian writer to be honoured with a state funeral. Two poets who are amongst the great Australian poets are Christopher Brennan and Adam Lindsay Gordon; Gordon was once referred to as the &quot;national poet of Australia&quot; and is the only Australian with a monument in Poets&#x27; Corner of Westminster Abbey in England. Both Gordon&#x27;s and Brennan&#x27;s (but particularly Brennan&#x27;s) works conformed to traditional styles of poetry, with many classical allusions, and therefore fell within the domain of high culture.

However, at the same time Australia had a competing, vibrant tradition of folk songs and ballads. Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson were two of the chief exponents of these popular ballads, and &#x27;Banjo&#x27; himself was responsible for creating what is probably the most famous Australian verse, &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;. At one point, Lawson and Paterson contributed a series of verses to &quot;The Bulletin&quot; magazine in which they engaged in a literary debate about the nature of life in Australia. Lawson said Paterson was a romantic and Paterson said Lawson was full of doom and gloom. Lawson is widely regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s greatest writers of short stories, while Paterson&#x27;s poems &quot;The Man From Snowy River&quot; and &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot; remain amongst the most popular Australian bush poems. Romanticised views of the outback and the rugged characters that inhabited it played an important part in shaping the Australian nation&#x27;s psyche, just as the cowboys of the American Old West and the gauchos of the Argentine pampa became part of the self-image of those nations.
Other poets who reflected a sense of Australian identity include C J Dennis and Dorothea McKellar. Dennis wrote in the Australian vernacular (&quot;The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke&quot;), while McKellar wrote the iconic patriotic poem &quot;My Country&quot;. Prominent Australian poets of the 20th century include Dame Mary Gilmore, A. D. Hope, Judith Wright, Gwen Harwood, Kenneth Slessor, Les Murray, Bruce Dawe and more recently Robert Gray, John Forbes, John Tranter, John Kinsella and Judith Beveridge.
Contemporary Australian poetry is mostly published by small, independent book publishers. However, other kinds of publication, including new media and online journals, spoken word and live events, and public poetry projects are gaining an increasingly vibrant and popular presence. 1992–1999 saw poetry and art collaborations in Sydney and Newcastle buses and ferries, including Artransit from Meuse Press. Some of the more interesting and innovative contributions to Australian poetry have emerged from artist-run galleries in recent years, such as Textbase which had its beginnings as part of the 1st Floor gallery in Fitzroy. In addition, Red Room Company is a major exponent of innovative projects. Bankstown Poetry Slam has become a notable venue for spoken-word poetry and for community intersection with poetry as an art form to be shared. With its roots in Western Sydney it has a strong following from first and second generation Australians, often giving a platform to voices that are more marginalised in mainstream Australian society.
The Australian Poetry Library contains a wide range of Australian poetry as well as critical and contextual material relating to them, such as interviews, photographs and audio/visual recordings. it contains over 42,000 poems, from more than 170 Australian poets. Begun in 2004 by leading Australian poet John Tranter, it is a joint initiative of the University of Sydney and the Copyright Agency Limited (CAL) with funding by the Australian Research Council.

==Plays==
European traditions came to Australia with the First Fleet in 1788, with the first production being performed in 1789 by convicts : &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; by George Farquhar. Two centuries later, the extraordinary circumstances of the foundations of Australian theatre were recounted in &quot;Our Country&#x27;s Good&quot; by Timberlake Wertenbaker: the participants were prisoners watched by sadistic guards and the leading lady was under threat of the death penalty. The play is based on Thomas Keneally&#x27;s novel &quot;The Playmaker&quot;. After Australian Federation in 1901, plays evidenced a new sense of national identity. &quot;On Our Selection&quot; (1912) by Steele Rudd, told of the adventures of a pioneer farming family and became immensely popular. In 1955, &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; by Ray Lawler portrayed resolutely Australian characters and went on to international acclaim. A new wave of Australian theatre debuted in the 1970s with the works of writers including David Williamson, Barry Oakley and Jack Hibberd. The Belvoir St Theatre presented works by Nick Enright and David Williamson. Williamson is Australia&#x27;s best known playwright, with major works including: &quot;The Club, Emerald City&quot;, and &quot;Brilliant Lies&quot;.

In &quot;The One Day of the Year&quot;, Alan Seymour studied the paradoxical nature of the ANZAC Day commemoration by Australians of the defeat of the Battle of Gallipoli. &quot;Ngapartji Ngapartji&quot;, by Scott Rankin and Trevor Jamieson, recounts the story of the effects on the Pitjantjatjara people of nuclear testing in the Western Desert during the Cold War. It is an example of the contemporary fusion of traditions of drama in Australia with Pitjantjatjara actors being supported by a multicultural cast of Greek, Afghan, Japanese and New Zealand heritage. Eminent contemporary Australian playwrights include David Williamson, Alan Seymour, Stephen Sewell, the late Nick Enright and Justin Fleming. The Australian government supports a website (australianplays.org The Home of Australian Playscripts | AustralianPlays.org) that aims to combine playwright biographies and script information. Scripts are also available there.

== Science fiction and fantasy ==
Australia, unlike Europe, does not have a long history in the genre of science fiction. Nevil Shute&#x27;s &quot;On the Beach&quot;, published in 1957, and filmed in 1959, was perhaps the first notable international success. Though not born in Australia, Shute spent his latter years there, and the book was set in Australia. It might have been worse had the imports of American pulp magazines not been restricted during WWII, forcing local writers into the field. Various compilation magazines began appearing in the 1960s and the field has continued to expand into some significance. Today Australia has a thriving SF/Fantasy genre with names recognised around the world. In 2013 a trilogy by Sydney-born Ben Peek was sold at auction to a UK publisher for a six-figure deal .

== Crime ==

The crime fiction genre is currently thriving in Australia, most notably through books written by Kerry Greenwood, Shane Maloney, Peter Temple, Barry Maitland, Arthur Upfield and Peter Corris, among others.

High-profile, highly publicised court cases and murders have seen a significant amount of non-fiction crime literature, perhaps the most recognisable writer in this field being Helen Garner. Garner&#x27;s published accounts of three court cases: &quot;The First Stone&quot;, about a sexual harassment scandal at the University of Melbourne, &quot;Joe Cinque&#x27;s Consolation&quot;, about a young man murdered by his girlfriend in Canberra, and &quot;This House of Grief&quot;, about Victorian child-killer Robert Farquharson. Each of Garner&#x27;s works incorporates the style reminiscent of a fictional narrative novel, a stylistic device known as the non-fiction novel.

Chloe Hooper published &quot;The Tall Man: Death and Life on Palm Island&quot; in 2008 as a response to the death of an Aboriginal man, Cameron Doomadgee, in police custody in Palm Island, Queensland.

== Literary journals ==

The first periodical that could be called a literary journal in Australia was &quot;The Australian Magazine&quot; (June 1821 - May 1822). It featured poetry, a two-part story and articles on theology and general topics. Most of the others that followed in the 19th century were based in either Sydney or Melbourne. Few lasted long due to difficulties that included a lack of capital, the small local market and competition from literary journals from Britain.

Most recent Australian literary journals have originated from universities, and specifically English or Communications departments. They include:
* &quot;Meanjin&quot;
* &quot;Overland&quot;
* &quot;HEAT&quot;
* &quot;Southerly&quot;
* &quot;Westerly&quot;

Other journals include:
* &quot;Quadrant&quot;
* &quot;Australian Book Review&quot;
* &quot;Island&quot;
* &quot;Voiceworks&quot;
* &quot;Wet Ink&quot; (now closed)
* &quot;The Lifted Brow&quot;
* &quot;Red Leaves / 紅葉&quot;
* &quot;Kill Your Darlings&quot;

A number of newspapers also carry literary review supplements:
* &quot;Australian Literary Review&quot;

==Awards==

Current literary awards in Australia include:
* Anne Elder Award
* The Australian/Vogel Literary Award
* Children&#x27;s Book Council of Australia

<text>A precision approach path indicator (PAPI) is a system of lights on the side of an airport runway threshold that provides visual descent guidance information during final approach. It is generally located on the left-hand side of the runway approximately beyond the landing threshold of the runway.

==Design and installation==
A typical engineering design specification for a PAPI light unit is shown below:

Optical construction:
* Two lamps for redundancy;
* Anodized aluminium reflectors;
* Red color filter;
* One or two lenses;
* Lamps and reflectors replaceable without recalibration.

Each light unit consists of one or more light sources, red filters and lenses. A color filter may not be necessary with colored LED lights. Each light unit emits a high-intensity beam. The lower segment of the beam is red, and the upper part is white. The transition between the two colours must take place over an angle not greater than three minutes of arc. This characteristic makes the color change very conspicuous, a key feature of the PAPI signal. To form the PAPI guidance signal, the color transition boundaries of the four units are fixed at different angles. The lowest angle is used for the unit furthest from the runway, the highest for the unit nearest to the runway. The designated glideslope is midway between the second and third light unit settings.

A PAPI installation consists of a bar of four units. Units should be frangible but not susceptible to jet blast. The inner edge of the PAPI installation should be situated from the runway edge, and not closer than to any runway or taxiway. The units should be spaced apart. An abbreviated system, A-PAPI, can be used for some categories of aircraft operations. It consists of two units with the inner unit located from the runway edge.

The PAPI should be located on the left-hand side of the runway at right angles to the runway center line, although can be located on the right-hand side of the runway if required. The red lights are always on the side closest to the runway. If the PAPI is on the right-hand side of the runway (non-standard), the red lights will be on the left. At some locations, PAPIs are installed on both sides of the runway but this level of provision is beyond the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

The optimum distance from the runway threshold depends on the wheel clearance over the threshold of the types of aircraft expected to land on the runway; compatibility with non-visual glide paths such as instrument landing system (ILS) down to the minimum possible range and height; and any difference in elevation between the PAPI installation and the runway threshold. This optimum distance may be adjusted depending on runway length and obstacle clearance. Harmonisation between PAPIs and an ILS system must take into account the distance between eye height and ILS receiver height for various aircraft.

For a typical 3 degree approach slope, PAPI lights should be angled as follows: 3°30&#x27;, 3°10&#x27;, 2°50&#x27;, 2°30&#x27; (3.50°, 3.17°, 2.83°, 2.50°).

==Interpretation==

The ratio of white to red lights seen is dependent on the angle of approach to the runway. Above the designated glide slope a pilot will see more white lights than red; below the ideal angle more red lights than white will be seen. At the optimum approach angle the ratio of white to red lights will be equal, for most aircraft.

Student pilots in initial training may use the mnemonic
* WHITE on WHITE - &quot;Check your height&quot; (or &quot;You&#x27;re gonna fly all night&quot;) (too high)
* RED on WHITE – &quot;You&#x27;re all right&quot;
* RED on RED – &quot;You&#x27;re dead&quot; (too low)
until they are used to the lights&#x27; meaning.

PAPIs are calibrated relative to the Minimum Eye Height over Threshold (MEHT). For certain aircraft with a low pilot eye height, the pilot will see a &quot;slightly low&quot; indication even though they are on the ILS glideslope. Pilot eye height is usually above the ILS receiver antenna. Concorde had a particularly high eye height because the main undercarriage was so far behind the cockpit, so the pilots needed to land with a &quot;slightly high&quot; indication.

The light characteristics of all light units are identical. In good visibility conditions the guidance information can be used at ranges up to by day and night. At night the light bars can be seen at ranges of at least .

PAPI systems are readily available from airfield lighting manufacturers worldwide. PAPI is normally operated by air traffic control (ATC). If ATC services are not normally provided at an aerodrome, PAPI along with other airport lights may be activated by the pilot by keying the aircraft microphone with the aircraft&#x27;s communication radio tuned to the CTAF or dedicated pilot controlled lighting (PCL) frequency.

==History==
The precision approach path indicator system was first devised in 1974 by Tony Smith and David Johnson at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Bedford, England. It took them a further two years to fully develop the technology. Engineering firm Research Engineers (RE) were also heavily involved in the project, having produced and supplied PAPI units for the first trials that were conducted. The same design is still in use today.

Smith and Johnson&#x27;s work was honoured by a commendation from the RAE, a Fellowship from the Aeronautical Society, an award from the American Flight Safety Foundation, and a Gold Medal from the British Guild of Air Pilots.

PAPIs were used by NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle for its safe landing, for which Johnson was interviewed by UK local news media and TV.

An earlier glideslope indicator system, the visual approach slope indicator (VASI), only provided guidance down to heights of whereas PAPI provides guidance down to flare initiation (typically ).

2008 saw the advent of new PAPI devices manufactured using solid state LED lamps instead of incandescent lamps. The LEDs produce sufficient brightness to satisfy ICAO light intensity and beamspread standards, and average lifetime with the LED based systems is 50,000 hours or more. By using LEDs, the device&#x27;s power consumption is lowered considerably. The LED systems run internally on DC voltage, so the DC voltage requirements, along with the LEDs&#x27; inherently low power consumption, now allow for solar-powered PAPIs, enabling them to function completely independently of a power grid.

The PAPI system is co-opted for use by the Final Approach Runway Occupancy Signal (FAROS) system being introduced by several major airports in the United States for the purpose of allowing pilots to resolve a runway incursion without requiring &quot;a priori&quot; notice of an occupied runway from the control tower. In FAROS, automated line-of-sight runway sensors detect if a vehicle has committed a runway incursion, and if so, will flash the PAPI lights to alert the pilot of an aircraft on final approach that the runway is currently occupied. The pilot then becomes responsible for resolving the conflict by notifying the air traffic controller and executing a go-around. Once the tower has ascertained that the runway has been cleared, the ground controller resets the PAPI so that landing operations may resume normally.

<text>MMDF, the Multichannel Memorandum Distribution Facility, is a message transfer agent (MTA), a computer program designed to transmit email. 

==History==
MMDF was originally developed at the University of Delaware in the late 1970s, and provided the initial means of operating CSNET, the predecessor to NSFNET. It grew in popularity throughout the 1980s, and was selected by the Santa Cruz Operation as the MTA it would distribute with SCO UNIX in 1989. It was also adopted as the basis for other commercial efforts, including the gateway used to connect the MCI Mail service to Internet mail. A re-coded variant of MMDF, called &quot;Pascal MDF&quot; (PMDF) was written at the University of Pennsylvania for VMS and was eventually commercialized through Ned Freed&#x27;s Innosoft, which subsequently ported PMDF to Tru64 Unix and Solaris. In 1999 PMDF was translated from Pascal to C. The C version of PMDF became the basis of the Sun Java System Messaging Server of Sun Microsystems, while rights to PMDF itself were purchased by Process Software, which then ported PMDF to Linux.

== Design philosophy ==

As its name denotes, MMDF is an MTA oriented around the idea of channels. Each means of formatting and transporting mail into or out of the mail system is a channel, and is implemented by a separate executable. This makes MMDF a highly modular system, with each module having all of the idiosyncratic syntax and semantic information necessary for a particular email technology or network, as well as the least privilege necessary, with the authority of each module partitioned from others. An inbound channel receives messages (via the protocol and in the format it implements) and an outbound channel delivers messages (via its relevant protocol and mapping into the relevant format). Internally, MMDF uses a canonical representation for message content and header, including addresses.

Some examples of MMDF channels are SMTP, UUCP, and local (for delivering mail into local mailboxes and accepting mail submitted on the local system). MMDF was used on the CSNET network.

== Message flow ==

A message that flows through MMDF will typically follow this path:
* An inbound channel accepts a message.
* It invokes the core of the MMDF system, a program called &quot;submit&quot;, and feeds it the message as well as the out-of-band information for the message - return address, recipient, etc.
* Submit stores the message text after doing any necessary header rewriting, determines what channel(s) will be used to deliver the message, and injects the message into the queues for those channels.
* Depending on configuration, submit may then call &quot;deliver&quot;, or deliver may run later as part of periodic processing. Deliver does no direct processing of messages; instead it invokes outbound (delivery) channels, tells them which messages to process, and gives them a list of recipient addresses for each message.
* Each outbound channel delivers the message to those recipients who are to be reached by that channel, and reports to deliver which addresses were successfully delivered to.
* Deliver then updates the queues to mark the addresses that were delivered to, removes the message from any queues that have been completely processed, and if all queues have been processed removes the message text itself.

== Configuration ==

MMDF approaches administrative configuration differently than other popular MTAs. In the choice between placing specialized knowledge into the software, versus requiring that it be created through administrator&#x27;s configuration instructions, MMDF chose the former. Hence, arbitrary header rewriting is performed by hard-coded software, with configuration limited to choices among existing rewriting alternatives. This makes configuration simpler and safer for administrators, who use simple key-value textual tables. It also takes more effort to create a new rewriting choice, but that effort needs to occur only one time, by a single technical expert.

The main types of tables are domain, channel, and alias tables.
* Domain tables are used for domain name canonicalization.
* Channel tables select the outbound channel on the basis of the next-hop domain name, and also encode per-domain-name parameters for the particular channel, such as the UUCP node name or IP address.
* Alias tables set up both simple aliases and mailing lists.
DNS can be and usually is used for these purposes as well, in the form of &quot;DNS tables&quot; that have the same key-value form. 
The meaning and effect of entries in these tables are more obvious than the configuration data of more generalized MTAs, but their restricted form also limits the effects that can be produced.

== Market share ==

By the end of 2006, MMDF had a market share well behind other mailers such as sendmail, postfix, qmail, exim, and Microsoft Exchange. MMDF is considered legacy software.

<doc id="1075211" wikidata="Q903667" url="?curid=1075211" title="Metabolome">
<text>The metabolome refers to the complete set of small-molecule chemicals found within a biological sample. The biological sample can be a cell, a cellular organelle, an organ, a tissue, a tissue extract, a biofluid or an entire organism. The small molecule chemicals found in a given metabolome may include both endogenous metabolites that are naturally produced by an organism (such as amino acids, organic acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, amines, sugars, vitamins, co-factors, pigments, antibiotics, etc.) as well as exogenous chemicals (such as drugs, environmental contaminants, food additives, toxins and other xenobiotics) that are not naturally produced by an organism.

In other words, there is both an endogenous metabolome and an exogenous metabolome. The endogenous metabolome can be further subdivided to include a &quot;primary&quot; and a &quot;secondary&quot; metabolome (particularly when referring to plant or microbial metabolomes). A primary metabolite is directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction. A secondary metabolite is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has important ecological function. Secondary metabolites may include pigments, antibiotics or waste products derived from partially metabolized xenobiotics. The study of the metabolome is called metabolomics.

==Origins==
The word metabolome appears to be a blending of the words &quot;metabolite&quot; and &quot;chromosome&quot;. It was constructed to imply that metabolites are indirectly encoded by genes or act on genes and gene products. The term &quot;metabolome&quot; was first used in 1998 and was likely coined to match with existing biological terms referring to the complete set of genes (the genome), the complete set of proteins (the proteome) and the complete set of transcripts (the transcriptome). The first book on metabolomics was published in 2003. The first journal dedicated to metabolomics (titled simply &quot;Metabolomics&quot;) was launched in 2005 and is currently edited by Prof. Roy Goodacre. Some of the more significant early papers on metabolome analysis are listed in the references below.

==Measuring the metabolome==
The metabolome reflects the interaction between an organism&#x27;s genome and its environment. As a result, an organism&#x27;s metabolome can serve as an excellent probe of its phenotype (i.e. the product of its genotype and its environment). Metabolites can be measured (identified, quantified or classified) using a number of different technologies including NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Most mass spectrometry (MS) methods must be coupled to various forms of liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC) or capillary electrophoresis (CE) to facilitate compound separation. Each method is typically able to identify or characterize 50-5,000 different metabolites or metabolite &quot;features&quot; at a time, depending on the instrument or protocol being used. Currently it is not possible to analyze the entire range of metabolites by a single analytical method.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an analytical chemistry technique that measures the absorption of radiofrequency radiation of specific nuclei when molecules containing those nuclei are placed in strong magnetic fields. The frequency (i.e. the chemical shift) at which a given atom or nucleus absorbs is highly dependent on the chemical environment (bonding, chemical structure nearest neighbours, solvent) of that atom in a given molecule. The NMR absorption patterns produce &quot;resonance&quot; peaks at different frequencies or different chemical shifts – this collection of peaks is called an NMR spectrum. Because each chemical compound has a different chemical structure, each compound will have a unique (or almost unique) NMR spectrum. As a result, NMR is particularly useful for the characterization, identification and quantification of small molecules, such as metabolites. The widespread use of NMR for &quot;classical&quot; metabolic studies, along with its exceptional capacity to handle complex metabolite mixtures is likely the reason why NMR was one of the first technologies to be widely adopted for routine metabolome measurements. As an analytical technique, NMR is non-destructive, non-biased, easily quantifiable, requires little or no separation, permits the identification of novel compounds and it needs no chemical derivatization. NMR is particularly amenable to detecting compounds that are less tractable to LC-MS analysis, such as sugars, amines or volatile liquids or GC-MS analysis, such as large molecules (&gt;500 Da) or relatively non-reactive compounds. NMR is not a very sensitive technique with a lower limit of detection of about 5 μM. Typically 50-150 compounds can be identified by NMR-based metabolomic studies.

Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of molecules. Molecules or molecular fragments are typically charged or ionized by spraying them through a charged field (electrospray ionization), bombarding them with electrons from a hot filament (electron ionization) or blasting them with a laser when they are placed on specially coated plates (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization). The charged molecules are then propelled through space using electrodes or magnets and their speed, rate of curvature, or other physical characteristics are measured to determine their mass-to-charge ratio. From these data the mass of the parent molecule can be determined. Further fragmentation of the molecule through controlled collisions with gas molecules or with electrons can help determine the structure of molecules. Very accurate mass measurements can also be used to determine the elemental formulas or elemental composition of compounds. Most forms of mass spectrometry require some form of separation using liquid chromatography or gas chromatography. This separation step is required to simplify the resulting mass spectra and to permit more accurate compound identification. Some mass spectrometry methods also require that the molecules be derivatized or chemically modified so that they are more amenable for chromatographic separation (this is particularly true for GC-MS). As an analytical technique, MS is a very sensitive method that requires very little sample (&lt;1 ng of material or &lt;10 μL of a biofluid) and can generate signals for thousands of metabolites from a single sample. MS instruments can also be configured for very high throughput metabolome analyses (hundreds to thousands of samples a day). Quantification of metabolites and the characterization of novel compound structures is more difficult by MS than by NMR. LC-MS is particularly amenable to detecting hydrophobic molecules (lipids, fatty acids) and peptides while GC-MS is best for detecting small molecules (&lt;500 Da) and highly volatile compounds (esters, amines, ketones, alkanes, thiols).

Unlike the genome or even the proteome, the metabolome is a highly dynamic entity that can change dramatically, over a period of just seconds or minutes. As a result, there is growing interest in measuring metabolites over multiple time periods or over short time intervals using modified versions of NMR or MS-based metabolomics.

==Metabolome databases==
Because an organism&#x27;s metabolome is largely defined by its genome, different species will have different metabolomes. Indeed, the fact that the metabolome of a tomato is different from the metabolome of an apple is the reason why these two fruits taste so different. Furthermore, different tissues, different organs and biofluids associated with those organs and tissues can also have distinctly different metabolomes. The fact that different organisms and different tissues/biofluids have such different metabolomes has led to the development of a number of organism-specific and biofluid-specific metabolome databases. Some of the better known metabolome databases include the Human Metabolome Database or HMDB, the Yeast Metabolome Database or YMDB, the E. coli Metabolome Database or ECMDB, the Arabidopsis metabolome database or AraCyc as well as the Urine Metabolome Database, the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Metabolome Database and the Serum Metabolome Database. The latter three databases are specific to human biofluids. A number of very popular general metabolite databases also exist including KEGG, MetaboLights, the Golm Metabolome Database, MetaCyc, LipidMaps and Metlin. Metabolome databases can be distinguished from metabolite databases in that metabolite databases contain lightly annotated or synoptic metabolite data from multiple organisms while metabolome databases contain richly detailed and heavily referenced chemical, pathway, spectral and metabolite concentration data for specific organisms.

===The Human Metabolome Database===
The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is a freely available, open-access database containing detailed data on more than 40,000 metabolites that have already been identified or are likely to be found in the human body. The HMDB contains three kinds of information:
# Chemical information,
# Clinical information and
# Biochemical information.
The chemical data includes &gt;40,000 metabolite structures with detailed descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties. It also contains nearly 10,000 experimentally measured NMR, GC-MS and LC/MS spectra from more than 1,100 different metabolites. The clinical information includes data on &gt;10,000 metabolite-biofluid concentrations, metabolite concentration information on more than 600 different human diseases and pathway data for more than 200 different inborn errors of metabolism. The biochemical information includes nearly 6,000 protein (and DNA) sequences and more than 5,000 biochemical reactions that are linked to these metabolite entries. The HMDB supports a wide variety of online queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches. This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are attempting to identify or understand metabolites in clinical metabolomic studies. The first version of the HMDB was released in Jan. 1 2007 and was compiled by scientists at the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary. At that time, they reported data on 2,500 metabolites, 1,200 drugs and 3,500 food components. Since then these scientists have greatly expanded the collection. The version 3.5 of the HMDB contains &gt;16,000 endogenous metabolites, &gt;1,500 drugs and &gt;22,000 food constituents or food metabolites.

====Human biofluid metabolomes====
Scientists at the University of Alberta have been systematically characterizing specific biofluid metabolomes including the serum metabolome, the urine metabolome, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolome and the saliva metabolome. These efforts have involved both experimental metabolomic analysis (involving NMR, GC-MS, ICP-MS, LC-MS and HPLC assays) as well as extensive literature mining. According to their data, the human serum metabolome contains at least 4,200 different compounds (including many lipids), the human urine metabolome contains at least 3,000 different compounds (including hundreds of volatiles and gut microbial metabolites), the human CSF metabolome contains nearly 500 different compounds while the human saliva metabolome contains approximately 400 different metabolites, including many bacterial products.

===Yeast Metabolome Database===
The Yeast Metabolome Database is a freely accessible, online database of &gt;2,000 small molecule metabolites found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker&#x27;s yeast). The YMDB contains two kinds of information:
# Chemical information and
# Biochemical information.
The chemical information in YMDB includes 2,027 metabolite structures with detailed metabolite descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties. It also contains nearly 4,000 NMR, GC-MS and LC/MS spectra obtained from more than 500 different metabolites. The biochemical information in YMDB includes &gt;1,100 protein (and DNA) sequences and &gt;900 biochemical reactions. The YMDB supports a wide variety of queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches. This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are studying yeast as a model organism or who are looking into optimizing the production of fermented beverages (wine, beer).

Secondary electrospray ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry SESI-HRMS is a non-invasive analytical technique that allows us to monitor the yeast metabolic activities. SESI-HRMS has found around 300 metabolites in the yeast fermentation process, this suggests that a large number of glucose metabolites are not reported in the literature.

===The Escherichia coli Metabolome Database===
The E. Coli Metabolome Database is a freely accessible, online database of &gt;2,700 small molecule metabolites found in or produced by Escherichia coli (E. coli strain K12, MG1655). The ECMDB contains two kinds of information:
# Chemical information and
# Biochemical information.
The chemical information includes more than 2,700 metabolite structures with detailed metabolite descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties. It also contains nearly 5,000 NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS spectra from more than 600 different metabolites. The biochemical information includes &gt;1,600 protein (and DNA) sequences and &gt;3,100 biochemical reactions that are linked to these metabolite entries. The ECMDB supports many different types of online queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches. This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are studying E. coli as a model organism.

Secondary electrospray ionization (SESI-MS) can discriminate between eleven E. Coli strains thanks to the volatile organic compound profiling.

=== Metabolome atlas of the aging mouse brain ===
In 2021, the first brain metabolome atlas of the mouse brain – and of an animal (a mammal) across different life stages – was released online. The data differentiates by brain regions and the metabolic changes could be &quot;mapped to existing gene and protein brain atlases&quot;.

==Intestinal metabolome==

Human intestinal microbiota contribute to the etiology of colorectal cancer via their metabolome. In particular, the conversion of primary bile acids to secondary bile acids as a consequence of bacterial metabolism in the colon promotes carcinogenesis.

<doc id="1075212" wikidata="Q84552" url="?curid=1075212" title="Hans Hahn (mathematician)">
<text>Hans Hahn (; ; 27 September 1879 – 24 July 1934) was an Austrian mathematician and philosopher who made contributions to functional analysis, topology, set theory, the calculus of variations, real analysis, and order theory. In philosophy he was among the main logical positivists of the Vienna Circle.

==Biography==
Born in Vienna as the son of a higher government official of the K.K. Telegraphen-Korrespondenz Bureau (since 1946 named &quot;Austria Presse Agentur&quot;), in 1898 Hahn became a student at the Universität Wien starting with a study of law. In 1899 he switched over to mathematics and spent some time at the universities of Strasbourg, Munich and Göttingen. In 1902 he took his Ph.D. in Vienna, on the subject &quot;Zur Theorie der zweiten Variation einfacher Integrale&quot;. He was a student of Gustav von Escherich.

He was appointed to the teaching staff (Habilitation) in Vienna in 1905. After 1905/1906 as a stand-in for Otto Stolz at the University of Innsbruck and some further years as a Privatdozent in Vienna, he was nominated in 1909 Professor extraordinarius in Czernowitz, at that time a town within the empire of Austria. After joining the Austrian army in 1915, he was badly wounded in 1916 and became again Professor extraordinarius, now in Bonn. In 1917 he was nominated a regular Professor there and in 1921 he returned to Vienna with this title, where he stayed until his rather early death in 1934 at the age of 54, following cancer surgery.
He had married Eleonore (&quot;Lilly&quot;) Minor in 1909 and they had a daughter, Nora (born 1910).

He was also interested in philosophy, and was part of a discussion group concerning Mach&#x27;s positivism with Otto Neurath (who had married Hahn’s sister Olga Hahn-Neurath in 1912), and Phillip Frank prior to the First World War. In 1922, he helped arrange Moritz Schlick&#x27;s entry into the group, which led to the founding of the Vienna Circle, the group that was at the center of logical positivist thought in the 1920s. His most famous student was Kurt Gödel, whose Ph.D. thesis was completed in 1929. After Anschluss the fact that Hans Hahn had been of partial Jewish origin caused Gödel&#x27;s difficulties with getting a position at the University of Vienna. Within the Vienna Circle, Hahn was also known (and controversial) for using his mathematical and philosophical work to study psychic phenomena; according to Karl Menger he sometimes openly advocated further research into extrasensory perception while lecturing. 

Politically Hahn was a socialist and was chairman of the Association of Socialist University Teachers. He contributed to the Social Democrat magazine &quot;Der Kampf&quot;.

Hahn&#x27;s contributions to mathematics include the Hahn–Banach theorem and (independently of Banach and Steinhaus) the uniform boundedness principle. Other theorems include:

* the Hahn decomposition theorem;
* the Hahn embedding theorem;
* the Hahn–Kolmogorov theorem;
* the Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem;
* the Vitali–Hahn–Saks theorem.

Hahn authored the book : according to Arthur Rosenthal, &quot;... (it) formed a great advance in the Theory of Real functions and had a great influence on the further development of this theory&quot;. He was also a co-author of the book &quot;Set Functions&quot;, published in 1948 by Arthur Rosenthal, fourteen years after his death in Vienna in 1934.

In 1921 he received the Richard Lieben Prize. In 1926 he was the president of the German Mathematical Society. In 1928 he was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna.

==Publications==

All his mathematical and philosophical works, except all books and all but one of his book reviews, are published in the three volumes , and of his &quot;Collected papers&quot;.

<doc id="1075213" wikidata="Q1276346" url="?curid=1075213" title="EU battlegroup">
<text>An EU battlegroup (EU BG) is a military unit adhering to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the European Union (EU). Often based on contributions from a coalition of member states, each of the eighteen battlegroups consists of a battalion-sized force reinforced with combat support elements (1,500 troops). Two of the battlegroups were to be capable for operational deployment at any one time. The civil power that oversees these battlegroups is the Council of the European Union.

The battlegroup initiative reached full operational capacity on 1 January 2007, but, , they had yet to see operational service. They were developed from existing &quot;ad hoc&quot; missions that the European Union (EU) had undertaken. The troops and equipment are drawn from the Member States of the European Union under the direction of a &quot;lead nation&quot;. In 2004, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the plans and emphasised the value and importance of the battlegroups in helping the UN deal with troublespots.

== History ==
=== Background (1999–2005) ===
The initial idea to create EU multinational roughly battalion-sized combined arms units was first publicly raised at the European Council summit on 10–11 December 1999 in Helsinki. The Council produced the Headline Goal 2003 and specified the need for a rapid response capability that members should provide in small forces at high readiness. The idea was reiterated at a Franco-British summit on 4 February 2003 in Le Touquet which highlighted as a priority the need to improve rapid response capabilities, &quot;including initial deployment of land, sea and air forces within 5–10 days.&quot; This was again described as essential in the &quot;Headline Goal 2010&quot;.

Operation Artemis in 2003 showed an EU rapid reaction and deployment of forces in a short time scale – with the EU going from &quot;Crisis Management Concept&quot; to operation launch in just three weeks, then taking a further 20 days for substantial deployment. Its success provided a template for the future rapid response deployments allowing the idea to be considered more practically. The following Franco-British summit in November of that year stated that, building on the experience of the operation, the EU should be able and willing to deploy forces within 15 days in response to a UN request. It called specifically for &quot;battlegroup sized forces of around 1500 land forces, personnel, offered by a single nation or through a multinational or framework nation force package&quot;.

On 10 February 2004, France, Germany and the United Kingdom released a paper outlining the &quot;battlegroup concept&quot;. The document proposed a number of groups based on Artemis that would be autonomous, consisting of about 1500 personnel and deployable within 15 days. These would be principally in response to UN requests at short notice and can be rapidly tailored to specific missions. They would concentrate on bridging operations, preparing the group before a larger force relieved them, for example UN or regional peacekeepers under UN mandate. The plan was approved by all groups in 2004 and in November that year the first thirteen battlegroups were pledged with associated niche capabilities.

=== Early development (2005–2015) ===

From 1 January 2005 the Battlegroups reached initial operational capacity; full operational capacity was reached on 1 January 2007. Although EU member states were initially highly motivated to volunteer to fill up the roster, the fact that participating member states have to cover their own costs, which especially burdened the smaller states, has made them more reluctant. Besides, many EU member states had simultaneous obligations to fulfill for ISAF and the NATO Response Force, amongst others. This combined with the fact that EU Battlegroups have never been deployed (due to slow political decision-making), despite several occasions in which they according to various experts could or should have been (most notably DR Congo in 2006 and 2008 and Libya in 2011), has led to increasing gaps in the standby roster. Joint funding and actual usage may resolve these issues.

=== MPCC, EDF and PESCO (2016–2020) ===
On 23 June 2016, the Brexit referendum resulted in a vote in favour of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. Since the UK and France were the largest military powers within the EU, this would mean a serious reduction in forces available for common European defence. On 28 June, High Representative Federica Mogherini presented a new plan, the European Union Global Strategy on Security and Foreign Policy, for rigorous further European military integration between the EU member states. These included more cooperation when planning missions, training and exercising soldiers, and the development of a European defence industry. For the EU Battlegroups specifically, the plan aims to remove the obstacles preventing their rapid deployment, such as the lack of a European military headquarters. Although stressing that NATO will remain the most important defence organisation for many EU countries, Mogherini stated that the Union should be able to operate &#x27;autonomously if necessary&#x27; on security matters. Referring to the EU&#x27;s diplomacy and development record, she said that &#x27;Soft power is not enough&#x27;, and that in a less secure world, especially after Brexit, common action was needed more than ever.

On 14 November 2016, the 56 European Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defence agreed to the European Union Global Strategy on Security and Foreign Policy. This included new possibilities for the rapid deployment of EU Battlegroups with aerial support for civil and military operations in conflict zones outside Europe, for example, before a UN peacekeeping force can arrive. Although Mogherini said the Strategy was &#x27;not a European army&#x27; or a &#x27;NATO duplicate&#x27;, the recent U.S. presidential election of Donald Trump, who had previously implicitly threatened to abandon NATO if its European member states continued to fail in meeting their funding obligations, influenced the European Ministers&#x27; decision as well. Besides Brexit and the election of Trump, Russia&#x27;s military expansionism and the European migrant crisis motivated them as well, making them agree relatively easily, which analysts regarded as a breakthrough.

On 6 March 2017, the foreign and defence ministers agreed to establish a small European command centre in Brussels for military training missions abroad, which could grow out to become a European military &#x27;headquarters&#x27; in the future. This Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) was confirmed and established by the Council of the European Union on 8 June 2017. This came one day after the European Commission launched the European Defence Fund (EDF), comprising €5.5 billion per year, to &#x27;coordinate, supplement and amplify national investments in defence research, in the development of prototypes and in the acquisition of defence equipment and technology&#x27;. Until then, the lack of a common military fund had been the main obstacle to the effective operational deployment of the EU Battlegroups. An agreement on Permanent Structured Cooperation in Defence (PESCO) was reached at 22–23 June EU summit in Brussels. A June 2017 Eurobarometer opinion poll showed that 75% of Europeans supported a common European security and defence policy, and 55% even favoured a European army. Political leaders such as Dutch PM Mark Rutte commented that a &#x27;European army&#x27; was not in the making, however.

=== Strategic Compass and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine (2020–present) ===
During the German EU presidency in the second half of 2020, the EU Common Security and Defence Policy began development of the Strategic Compass for Security and Defence, as of November 2021 envisioning &#x27;substantially modified EU battlegroups&#x27; of 5,000 soldiers by 2025. While EU foreign chief Josep Borrell emphasised the EU intervention force should not be in competition with NATO, it was important to reduce operational dependency on the United States to allow EU military formations to function more autonomously, as had become more apparent during the August 2021 Kabul airlift. There continued to be problems in gathering enough troops together, and at the time only one EU Battlegroup of the standard two was available on stand-by.

The Strategic Compass was eventually adopted in March 2022. Although it had already been in development since late 2020, 24 February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine accelerated the development and adoption of the Strategic Compass on 21 March 2022 in Brussels at the meeting of EU foreign and defence ministers, who jointly strongly condemned Russia&#x27;s actions, made a strong commitment to the complementary cooperation between the EU and NATO, and discussed plans to increase the EU&#x27;s defensive capabilities. As part of the Strategic Compass, it was decided to create the EU Rapid Deployment Capacity (EU RDC) by further developing the EU Battlegroups (EUBG) &#x27;to be able to act quickly and appropriately, in both civilian and military missions, in the event of a crisis.&#x27; As leader of the EU Battlegroup 2025 (to be operational in 2025), Germany would provide a core of the new EU RDC, supported by contributions of other EU member states. At the late May 2022 planning conference for the EU Battlegroup 2025 in Vienna involving 10 EU states, it was decided that the RDC concept was to be finalised by the end of 2022, the advanced battlegroup would include up to 5,000 soldiers from Germany and the Netherlands (lead), Austria (logistics), Hungary, Croatia, and other member states, joint exercises and training would commence in 2023, the force was to be fully operational by 2025, and would be deployed for 12 months in areas up to 6,000 kilometres measured from Brussels. Aside from ground troops, the new force was to include space and cyber capabilities, special forces and strategic airlift capacities, and, depending on requirements, air and naval forces. Another EUBG 2025 planning conference was held in September 2022 at the Multinational Joint Headquarters Ulm, which would likely also serve as the future headquarters at the military-strategic level.

== Tasks ==
The groups are intended to be deployed on the ground within 5–10 days of approval from the council. It must be sustainable for at least 30 days, which could be extended to 120 days, if resupplied.

The Battlegroups are designed to deal with those tasks faced by the Common Security and Defence Policy, namely the Petersberg tasks (military tasks of a humanitarian, peacekeeping and peacemaking nature).

Planners claim the Battlegroups have enough range to deal with all those tasks, although such tasks ought to be limited in &quot;size and intensity&quot; due to the small nature of the groups. Such missions may include conflict prevention, evacuation, aid deliverance or initial stabilisation. In general these would fall into three categories; brief support of existing troops, rapid deployment preparing the ground for larger forces or small-scale rapid response missions.

== Structure ==
A Battlegroup is considered to be the smallest self-sufficient military unit that can be deployed and sustained in a theatre of operation. EU Battlegroups are composed of approximately 1,500 troops; plus, command and support services. The initial thirteen Battlegroups were proposed on 22 November 2004; further battlegroups have joined them since then. Since March 2022, the EU has been planning to increase their size to up to 5,000 troops per battlegroup by 2025.

There is no fixed structure, a &#x27;standard&#x27; group would include a headquarters company, three infantry companies and corresponding support personnel. Specific units might include mechanised infantry, support groups (e.g. fire or medical support), the combination of which allows independent action by the group on a variety of tasks. The main forces, extra support and &quot;force headquarters&quot; (front line command) are contained within the Battlegroup &quot;package&quot;, in addition there is the operation headquarters, located in Europe.

== Contributions ==
Larger member states will generally contribute their own Battlegroups, while smaller members are expected to create common groups. Each group will have a &#x27;lead nation&#x27; or &#x27;framework nation&#x27; which will take operational command, based on the model set up during the EU&#x27;s peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Operation Artemis). Each group will also be associated with a headquarters. Three non-EU NATO countries, Norway, Turkey, and North Macedonia, participate in a group each, as well as one non-EU non-NATO country, Ukraine. From 1992 to 2022, Denmark had an opt-out clause in the Treaty of Maastricht and was not obliged to participate in the Common Security and Defence Policy, but following a 1 June 2022 referendum in favour of abolishing the opt-out, Denmark joined the CSDP a month later on 1 July 2022. Malta currently does not participate in any Battlegroup.

=== Standby roster ===
From 1 January 2005 the Battlegroups reached initial operational capacity: at least one Battlegroup was on standby every 6 months. The United Kingdom and France each had an operational Battlegroup for the first half of 2005, and Italy for the second half. In the first half of 2006, a Franco-German Battlegroup operated, and the Spanish–Italian Amphibious Battlegroup. In the second half of that year just one Battlegroup operated composed of France, Germany and Belgium.

Full operational capacity was reached on 1 January 2007, meaning the Union could undertake two Battlegroup sized operations concurrently, or deploy them simultaneously into the same field. The Battlegroups rotate every 6 months, the roster from 2007 onwards is as follows;

There are plans to extend the concept to air and naval forces, although not to the extent of having a single standing force on standby, but scattered forces which could be rapidly assembled.

===Recurring formations===
*Nordic Battlegroup
*Balkan Battlegroup
*Visegrád Battlegroup
*Multinational Land Force
*Spanish–Italian Amphibious Battlegroup

===Niche capabilities===
The following Member States have also offered niche capabilities in support of the EU Battlegroups:

* Cyprus (medical group)
* Lithuania (a water purification unit)
* Greece (the Athens Sealift Co-ordination Centre)
* France (structure of a multinational and deployable Force Headquarters)

=== Further details on specific contributions ===

* Sweden and Finland announced the creation of a joint Nordic Battlegroup. To make up the required 1500 number, they also urged Norway to contribute to the Battlegroup despite that country not being part of the EU. Recently, the number has been raised to 2400 troops with Sweden providing 2000 of these. According to Swedish newspapers the price for the 6 months in 2008 was 1.2 billion Swedish kronor (app. 150,000,000 euros) and the Battlegroup was not used.
* Finland is expected to commit troops trained to combat chemical and biological weapons, among other units such as a mortar company.
* Lithuania is expected to offer experts in water purification.
* Greece is pledging troops with maritime transport skills.
* Ireland has offered bomb disposal experts among its contribution.

The Battlegroups project is not to be confused with the projected Helsinki Headline Goal force, which concerns up to 60,000 soldiers, deployable for at least a year, and take one to two months to deploy. The Battlegroups are instead meant for more rapid and shorter deployment in international crises, probably preparing the ground for a larger and more traditional force to replace them in due time.

=== Western Balkans Battlegroup proposal ===
In 2010, a group of experts from the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy proposed the establishment of a Western Balkans Battlegroup by 2020. In a policy vision titled &quot;Towards a Western Balkans Battlegroup: A vision of Serbia&#x27;s Defence Integration into the EU 2010-2020&quot;, they argued that the creation of such a Battlegroup would not only be an accelerating factor in the accession of the former Yugoslav republics into the EU, but also a strong symbolic message of reconciliation and security community reconstruction after the devastating wars of the 1990s. Furthermore, the authors of the study argued that such a Western Balkan Battlegroup, notwithstanding all the political challenges, would have a very high linguistic, cultural and military interoperability. Although decision makers initially showed a weak interest in the Western Balkans Battlegroup, the idea has recently reappeared in the parliamentary discussions in Serbia.

== Exercises ==

In 2008, the EU Battlegroup conducted wargames to protect the first-ever free elections in the imaginary country of Vontinalys. In June 2014, EUBG 2014 II with 3,000 troops from Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, the Netherlands and Spain conducted a training exercise in the Ardennes, codenamed &#x27;Quick Lion&#x27;, to prevent ethnic violence between the &quot;Greys&quot; and the &quot;Whites&quot; in the imaginary country of &quot;Blueland&quot;.

<text>The list of [[drainage basin]]s by area identifies basins (also known as &quot;catchments&quot; or, in North American usage, &quot;watersheds&quot;), sorted by area, which drain to oceans, mediterranean seas, rivers, lakes and other water bodies. All basins larger than are included as well as selected smaller basins. It includes drainage basins which do not flow to the ocean (endorheic basins). It includes oceanic sea drainage basins which have hydrologically coherent areas (oceanic seas are set by IHO convention).

The oceans drain approximately 83% of the land in the world. The other 17% – an area larger than the basin of the Arctic Ocean – drains to internal endorheic basins. There are also substantial areas of the world that do not &quot;drain&quot; in the commonly understood sense. In polar deserts, much of the snowfall sublimates directly into the air and does not melt into flowing water, while in tropical deserts precipitation may evaporate before joining any substantial water course. These areas can still be included in topographically defined basins if the hypothetical flow of water (or ice) over the surface of the ground (or ice sheet) is considered. For example, the Antarctic ice sheet can be divided into basins, and most of Libya is included in the Mediterranean Sea basin even though almost no water from the interior actually reaches the sea.

<text>Pietro Cerone (1566–1625) was an Italian music theorist, singer and priest of the late Renaissance. He is most famous for an enormous music treatise he wrote in 1613, which is useful in the studying compositional practices of the 16th century.

==Life==
Cerone was born in Bergamo. While Italian, he spent most of his life in Spanish-dominated Naples, Sardinia, and later in Spain: he did most of his writing in Spanish. He was unusual in being an Italian musician in Spain; far more often in the 16th century, Spanish musicians went to Italy, as in the case of Victoria. In 1603 he returned to Naples, where he was a priest and singer until his death. It was in Naples that he wrote his two most famous treatises.

==Writings==
The first of these, in Italian, was &quot;Le regole più necessarie per l&#x27;introduzione del canto fermo&quot;, which he published in 1609. It was a didactic and practical work on singing plainsong, which he probably used in his work at the Neapolitan church of Ss Annunziata. Four years later, however, he published a monumental volume on music theory, &quot;El melopeo y maestro: tractado de música theorica y pratica; en que se pone por extenso; lo que uno para hazerse perfecto musico ha menester saber&quot;, which consisted of 22 volumes, 849 chapters, and 1160 pages in the original Spanish.

&quot;El melopeo&quot; achieved considerable notoriety, and was sufficiently famous as late as 1803 to be lampooned by the Spanish novelist Antonio Eximeno, who compared it to the chivalric romances in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;: an impossibly detailed and absurd compilation of nonsense. Other writers in the 18th and 19th centuries have called it &quot;monstrous.&quot; However the treatise contains passages which give insight into the compositional practices of the time.

Cerone was musically conservative, and his conservatism in this influential treatise doubtless had some effect on the delay of the Baroque style arriving in the Iberian peninsula. In his writing he was generally contemptuous of Spanish composers, and lavish in his praise of Italians (which may partially account for the abuse heaped on him by Spanish critics). He discusses the previous theoretical treatises of Zarlino, Vicentino, Juan Bermudo and others; he describes in detail how a composer can achieve expressive intensity when writing masses, motets, madrigals, frottolas, canzonettas, canticles, hymns, psalms, lamentations, ricercares, tientos, strambotti, and other forms of the time. The compositional ideal which he maintained was the style of Palestrina, though curiously he maintained that the &quot;rules&quot; of counterpoint were made to be broken, and should be abandoned as soon as a composer had learned his craft: paradoxically, even in the 21st century, no style of composition is taught in a more rigorous, rule-based way than the polyphonic idiom of Palestrina.

While the treatise shows that he possessed considerable compositional skill, no music by Cerone has survived and he is not known to have published any. He died in Naples.

<text>Tappan is a brand of appliances, named after company founder W. J. Tappan.

Tappan claimed several innovations:

* 1930s all-porcelain range available in various colors
* 1955 the first compact (24&quot;) microwave oven
* 1960s electric ignition for gas ranges
* 1965 single-unit conventional range and microwave oven

==History==
In 1881, Tappan appliances was founded by W.J. Tappan as the Ohio Valley Foundry Company in Bellaire, Ohio, initially selling cast-iron stoves door-to-door.

In 1889, the company relocated to Mansfield, Ohio, and was renamed the Eclipse Stove Company, when Tappan&#x27;s father, who was an amateur astronomer, suggested the name after traveling to Siberia to view a comet. However, due to the existence of another Eclipse Stove Company that was not affiliated with Tappan&#x27;s company, the company was renamed the Tappan Stove Company in the 1920s.

In 1950, Tappan acquired the Los Angeles-based O&#x27;Keefe &amp; Merritt Stove Company and used the O&#x27;Keefe &amp; Merritt name in the western United States from then until the late 1980s.

In 1978, Carl Icahn in his first takeover attempt took a controlling stake in Tappan and forced the sale of the company to Electrolux

In 1979, European-based AB Electrolux (which had purchased Eureka five years prior) purchased the Tappan Stove Company. Seven years later, AB Electrolux purchased White Consolidated Industries, which manufactured Frigidaire, White-Westinghouse, Gibson Appliance, and Kelvinator products, and combined its Tappan holdings with these new products to create the WCI Major Appliances Group. In 1991, the WCI Major Appliances Group simply became known as the Frigidaire Company, based in Dublin Ohio.

In 1997, the North American division of Electrolux was reorganized as Electrolux Home Products of North America, consolidating American Yard Products, Frigidaire, and Poulan/Weedeater.

<text>Gibson was founded by Joshua Hall in Belding, Michigan, in 1877 as the Belding-Hall Company selling cabinets that housed blocks of ice (ice-boxes). The area around Belding, Michigan, had a skilled workforce of Danish craftsmen and a good supply of hardwoods including ash. The company was purchased by Frank Gibson, a competing manufacturer of &quot;ice refrigerators&quot; in the early 1900s. It was the largest in its industry at the time. In 1931, the company began making electric refrigerators.

During the Second World War, Gibson manufactured 1,078 Waco CG-4 troop and cargo assault gliders under license.

The company claims to have innovated the refrigerator light, the upright freezer, and the &quot;Air Sweep&quot; mechanism for distributing conditioned air.

In 1956, Hupp Corporation acquired Gibson. In 1967 Hupp merged with White Consolidated Industries (WCI), which created the White-Westinghouse brand in 1975. WCI was purchased by Electrolux in 1986, which retained the Gibson brand.

<doc id="1075228" wikidata="Q3881797" url="?curid=1075228" title="Oliver's Story">
<text>Oliver&#x27;s Story is a 1978 American romantic drama film and a sequel to &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970) based on a novel by Erich Segal published a year earlier. It was directed by John Korty and again starred Ryan O&#x27;Neal, this time opposite Candice Bergen. The original music score was composed by Lee Holdridge and Francis Lai. It was released by Paramount Pictures on December 15, 1978.

This film&#x27;s promotional tagline is: &quot;It takes someone very special to help you forget someone very special.&quot;

==Plot==
Oliver Barrett IV is emotionally devastated by the death of his young wife, Jenny, who succumbed to leukemia. As he tries to lose himself in his work as a lawyer, the long hours do not ease his pain, especially when he finds that his views conflict with those of the senior partners at the firm.

Oliver&#x27;s inconsolable grief begins to alienate those around him, at least until he finds new love with Marcie Bonwit, the wealthy and beautiful heiress to the Bonwit Teller fortune. Despite his affection for her, Oliver finds it difficult to leave the memory of Jenny behind, which causes many problems in their relationship, even as he concurrently begins a reconciliation with his autocratic father. Though Oliver and Marcie eventually part, Oliver and his father are reconciled when both men discover surprising things they never knew about each other and Oliver finally joins Barrett Enterprises.

==Production==

=== Development ===
Rights to the project were legally complicated: because Paramount had bought Erich Segal&#x27;s original screenplay for &quot;Love Story&quot; and the novel was written afterwards, the studio retained the sequel rights to the characters, i.e. it could make a sequel using the same characters. However Segal could still write his own sequel book. Paramount had first refusal rights on Segal&#x27;s book, but if they refused his offer, Segal could take the project to another producer.

Segal was reported as working on a screenplay sequel to &quot;Love Story&quot; called &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; as early as 1972. However Segal wound up writing the novel version first although &quot;it took me five years of trembling and fear to start,&quot; he said. &quot;I was terrified of the curse of the second novel.&quot; In the meantime, Paramount had other writers prepare possible sequels to &quot;Love Story&quot;.

Writing the book of &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; took Segal two and a half years &quot;because I didn&#x27;t have an ending&quot;. He said he wrote &quot;every word&quot; of the book &quot;with Ryan O&#x27;Neal in mind. And in my mind&#x27;s eye I also saw [Ray] Milland and [John] Marley in their roles&quot; and he felt Candice Bergen would have been ideal for the lead female. The novel was published in February 1977 and became a best seller. Segal said various studios were unhappy with the book as a film project because &quot;no one dies&quot;.

Paramount had the right to match anyone&#x27;s offer for a sequel, but Segal demanded $5.5 million for the rights and the studio refused to pay it. Instead Paramount commissioned David Newman and his wife to write an original screenplay using the characters from &quot;Love Story&quot;. In September 1977 Segal said he was writing the screenplay version of &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; which he had sold, without Paramount&#x27;s involvement, to Lew Grade, to make, possible for television.

This meant there was a chance for two rival &quot;Love Story&quot; projects - &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot;, from the Segal novel, and a Paramount sequel, &quot;Love Story Two&quot;, not from the novel. Don Simpson, vice president of production at Paramount, said the studio had four screenplays in total under consideration for the sequel (this presumably included the script from the Newmans), plus the sole right to use Ryan O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s services. Segal felt a version of &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; could have been made without O&#x27;Neal but Simpson argued &quot;anybody who goes out and does a sequel without O&#x27;Neal is going to fall flat on their face at the box office.&quot;

Paramount had offered Ryan O&#x27;Neal a reported $3.5 million to reprise his role in a sequel. Segal commented, &quot;They&#x27;ll have to hire a UCLA film school student to direct because that&#x27;s the only other talent they&#x27;d be able to afford.&quot; Don Simpson wanted Arthur Hiller to direct while Segal&#x27;s choice of director was Claude Lelouch. Segal&#x27;s preference for the female lead was Candice Bergen although rumours at the time had Farrah Fawcett as the favourite.

Michael Eisner, head of Paramount, said &quot;one way or another we&#x27;re doing a sequel to &quot;Love Story&quot;,&quot; adding, &quot;I happen to like &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; but nothing is more presold than the movie and the original book. I think &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; can only help the momentum of the property that Paramount exclusively owns.&quot; Segal in turn threatened to sue Paramount if the studio made a sequel without his involvement.

In August 1977 Segal said Lew Grade had bought the rights to &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; for $1 million and that filming on the project would start on 15 October 1977, possibly starring Richard Jordan or Jan Michael Vincent as Oliver and Jacqueline Bisset as the female lead, with Charles Jarrott most likely to direct.

By September, however, it was announced that Lew Grade had reliquished his rights to the project and Segal and Paramount had come to terms - the studio would adapt &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot;. Segal had dropped his price to $1.5 million. David Picker, who had been president of Paramount Pictures, was given the project to produce as a &quot;going away present&quot;.

O&#x27;Neal refused to star in the film, however, saying he was unhappy with the script. &quot;It was just a rehash of the book, which hadn&#x27;t interested me,&quot; he said. He added, &quot;I just don&#x27;t think Segal did a good job of catching him. Oliver is a real hard guy to follow.&quot;

In January 1978 it was announced John Korty would direct &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; and that Paramount would make the film with an unknown male star, while O&#x27;Neal was going to make &quot;The Champ&quot; at MGM. Korty was best known for his television movies and low budget feature films. Korty later said he had been approached to direct by Picker. He claims Picker called him up and said, &quot;Erich Segal is writing his own script and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to be terrible,” so &quot;“I&#x27;m looking for somebody to treat it like an independent film... I know your work and I would love to have you direct this with the idea that you&#x27;ll probably end up writing a script as well, and it&#x27;s going to be a six or seven million dollar Christmas release from Paramount.”

Although Korty did not like &quot;Love Story&quot;, he was eager to try his hand at something more commercial and thought the prospect of dealing with Oliver&#x27;s grief over Jenny&#x27;s death would make for rich thematic material. &quot;I&#x27;ve got enough good reviews to wallpaper several rooms but I&#x27;ve never had enough elements interesting to the public to get people into theatres,&quot; said Korty.

Korty went to New York to start casting, seeing a lot of theatre actors. His choices for the leads were William Hurt and Meryl Streep. While David Picker was supportive, Korty says Michael Eisner, then head of Paramount, did not want to cast them as they were unknown. Korty later said, &quot;To this day I think, &#x27;What would that movie have looked like with Meryl Streep and Bill Hurt, you know?&#x27;&quot;

O&#x27;Neal then pulled out of &quot;The Champ&quot; and became available. Paramount had Korty rewrite the script and O&#x27;Neal agreed to make the film on the basis of the new draft. O&#x27;Neal said Korty is &quot;saying more or less the same thing as Erich, but he&#x27;s answered a lot of questions, a lot of exclamation points.&quot; Among the changes Korty made was enlarging the part of Joanna Stone and ending the film on a romance between her and Oliver. &quot;I wrote and photographed a very upbeat ending in which, as a symbolic gesture, Ryan knocks down a wall in his apartment as a way of opening up his life and starting with this young girl,&quot; said Korty.

O&#x27;Neal says he was paid less than $3 million for the role, although he received $1 million up front and a share of the profits. &quot;“Without O&#x27;Neal, &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; would be a totally different film,&quot; said Korty later during filming. &quot;To most peÒple, Ryan O&#x27;Neal is Oliver Barrett. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s going for us now. They&#x27;re involved in his life.”

In March 1978 it was reported Paramount hoped to give the female lead to Meryl Streep who had been in &quot;Julia&quot; but that O&#x27;Neal wanted Candice Bergen. O&#x27;Neal says Bergen was reluctant to appear in the film and he had to persuade her by giving her one of his points in the film.

The other female lead was played by Nicola Pagett, who had been in &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; and was cast after the filmmakers saw her photo in &quot;People&quot; magazine and flew her out to the US for a test. Both Bergen and Pagett were only cast after filming had already started, a situation producer David Picker called &quot;very, very scary.&quot;

John Marley did not reprise his role as Ali MacGraw&#x27;s father from the original. He and Paramount had come to terms on money but not billing; he was replaced by Edward Binns.

=== Filming ===
Filming began in March 1978 and took place over ten weeks with shooting in New York and Hong Kong.

O&#x27;Neal called the film &quot;the other side of the coin to &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;... I just hope the film doesn&#x27;t offend or insult anyone&#x27;s intelligence. We&#x27;re not doing a rip off - this isn&#x27;t just another sharp.&quot;

A number of scenes were filmed in Massachusetts. The Stanley Woolen Mill in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, and other locations in that community were used for this film. Oliver&#x27;s law offices were those occupied at the time by the New York firm of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell. The Bonwit Teller store in Eastchester, N.Y. was also used as a shoot location. Filming also took place in New York City and Hong Kong.

&quot;&quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; is the easiest thing I&#x27;ve ever done,&quot; said O&#x27;Neal during filming. &quot;&quot;Love Story&quot; was the next easiest. I knew the part. It was a reactive kind of character, and there was a lot to react to.&quot;

=== Post production ===
In the original draft of the film, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s character was meant to end up with the character played by Nicola Pagett. However, on viewing the movie the filmmakers felt it was not plausible that O&#x27;Neal would go with Pagett after being with the more beautiful Candice Bergen, so they removed these scenes from the movie.

Korty said &quot;It&#x27;s the only time I had a serious cutting problems and you know I could have fought it. The DGA&#x27;s [Directors Guild of America] rules about so many things are nice to have, but of course they can&#x27;t overcome power politics. And in this case I had very little power. And unfortunately David Picker went along with the Paramount executives... So the movie that came out is almost necrophilia. You know, it&#x27;s Ryan on a bridge mourning the loss of Jenny.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Unlike the original film, &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; was poorly reviewed and was not successful at the box office. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 25% based on reviews from eight critics.

O&#x27;Neal thought a major reason behind the film&#x27;s failure was the fact the character played by Nicola Pagett was cut out of the last third.

Korty said the film &quot;was a big failure, and they all blamed me. Lots of critics [said], &#x27;How could you have ended the film this way?&#x27; Well, that wasn&#x27;t my ending, but I had no choice because it was a $7 million picture and Paramount was in the driver’s seat.&quot;

Erich Segal had &quot;loved the way the film&quot; of &quot;Love Story&quot; had turned out, in part because he was involved in the filming process. However with &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; he says &quot;Paramount bought it, said &#x27;Thanks a lot, we&#x27;ll see you at the premiere&#x27; and that was that.&quot; In 1980 Segal claims he never saw the film. &quot;After I read the script I knew I wouldn&#x27;t want to see it.&quot;

<text>Frigidaire Appliance Company is the American consumer and commercial home appliances brand subsidiary of multinational company Electrolux, a Swedish multinational home appliance manufacturer, headquartered in Stockholm.

== History ==
Frigidaire was founded as the Guardian Frigerator Company in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and developed the first self-contained refrigerator, invented by Nathaniel B. Wales and Alfred Mellowes in 1916. In 1918, William C. Durant, a founder of General Motors, personally invested in the company and in 1919, it adopted the name Frigidaire, reminiscent of words like &quot;legionnaire&quot; and &quot;millionaire&quot; but encompassing the words &quot;frigid&quot; and &quot;air&quot;.

The brand was so well known in the refrigeration field in the early-to-mid-1900s, that many Americans called any refrigerator a &quot;Frigidaire&quot; regardless of brand. In France, Canada, and some other French-speaking countries or areas, the word &quot;Frigidaire&quot; is often in use as a synonym today, and in transcribed form in Serbo-Croatian also (&quot;frižider&quot;, &quot;фрижидер&quot;). Although the alliterative names Frigidaire or its antecedent Frigerator suggest an origin of the widely used English word &quot;fridge&quot;, it is simply a contraction of refrigerator, a word in use since 1611.

From 1919 to 1979, the company was owned by General Motors. During that period, it was first a subsidiary of Delco-Light and was later an independent division based in Dayton, Ohio. The division also manufactured air conditioning compressors for GM cars. While the company was owned by General Motors, its logo featured the phrase &quot;Product of General Motors&quot;, and later renamed to &quot;Home Environment Division of General Motors&quot;.

Frigidaire was sold to the White Consolidated Industries in 1979, which in 1986 was purchased by Electrolux, its current parent.

The company claims firsts including:
* Electric self-contained refrigerator (September, 1918 in Detroit)
* Home food freezer
* Room air conditioner
* 30&quot; electric range
* Coordinated colors for home appliances

==Automatic washers==

During the years that Frigidaire was owned by General Motors, it was very competitive in the automatic clothes-washing-machine business. Frigidaire engineer Kenneth Sisson, also credited with the design of the incrementing timer used on clothes washers and dishwashers for years to come, designed the Frigidaire automatic washer with the Unimatic mechanism in the late 1930s. Production of the first Frigidaire automatic clothes washers was halted due to World War II and therefore the machine was not formally introduced until 1947. The washing action of a Frigidaire automatic was unique in that the agitator pulsated up and down, a unique departure from the traditional oscillating type. The Frigidaire washers were commonly named for their mechanisms, which underwent frequent changes over the years. The Unimatic was in production the longest, for any single Frigidaire mechanism, from 1947 to 1958 for home automatic washers and through 1963 for coin-operated commercial washers for self-service laundromats. The Pulsamatic mechanism, unique in that it pulsated 630 times per minute, was introduced in 1955 for the lower-end models. This became the foundation for the Multimatic, introduced for the 1959 model year. The Multimatic lasted through 1964, as the Rollermatic was brought out for the 1965 lineup. The Rollermatic was unique in that instead of using an oil-filled gearcase, metal and urethane rollers transferred the power within the mechanism. This underwent a slight revision in 1970 for the new eighteen-pound capacity 1-18, which kept the same basic mechanism but differed in that it was belt-driven off of the motor and added a recirculating pump. Besides the unique action, another notable feature of these older washers was the final, high-speed spin cycle (nicknamed &quot;Rapidry&quot;), 1140 revolutions per minute in the Unimatic, 850 in the Multimatic, and 1010 in the high-end Rollermatic models.

When Frigidaire was acquired by White Consolidated Industries in 1979, it abandoned the General Motors design in favor of the Westinghouse-produced top-loading design, as White-Westinghouse was already among its house brands by this time.

==Refrigerators==


Frigidaire also produces a wide variety of refrigerators and freezers for the consumer market. Their model line-up includes refrigerator freezer units of several different types. The selection they offer includes traditional Top Freezer models, as well as more modern Side-By-Side and French Door styles.

In 2016, Frigidaire partnered with Ryder and Embark, an autonomous trucking firm, to deliver refrigerators from Texas to California. Level 2 autonomous trucks are used. They have a driver behind the wheel at all times. The reason for experimenting with autonomous vehicles is a looming shortage of drivers. In 2015, the American Trucking Association predicted that there would be a shortage of 175,000 drivers by 2024.

==Air conditioners==

In addition to manufacturing room air conditioners, Frigidaire also provided the factory air conditioning systems for General Motors (GM) automobiles. From the 1950s through the 1970s, these units developed a reputation for providing powerful air conditioning systems on virtually all GM cars and trucks from the largest Cadillacs to the small Chevrolet Vega. GM also sold Frigidaire auto air conditioning compressors to British Leyland for Jaguar and to Rolls-Royce for Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars.

==Manufacturing==
A new cooktop manufacturing facility opened in the Frank C. Pidgeon Industrial park, southwest of Memphis. The facility is built to LEED certification standards. Workers will manufacture the company&#x27;s Electrolux ICON, Electrolux and Frigidaire product lines, including drop-in/slide-in ranges, wall ovens, specialty freestanding ranges and cooktops. The $190 million, 750,000 square foot Memphis manufacturing plant began production of stoves and ranges in 2013. The plant&#x27;s research and development center includes the technology and machinery to simulate a stove&#x27;s lifetime usage and performance expectations and can test more than 300 products at one time.

Electrolux/Frigidaire also operates a manufacturing facility for free standing gas and electric ranges in Springfield, Tennessee. The Springfield facility currently employs about 2,900 people.

It also has operated a large manufacturing facility in Northern Mexico since 2005.

As of 2022, air conditioning units are manufactured in China.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission, alerted by users on social media platforms like Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, and others, discovered quality issues with Frigidaire products and issued two recalls in 2024 alone.

==Recalls==
Frigidaire has had several recent recalls:

===2024===
*Frigidaire (Electrolux) Recalls Rear-Controlled Ranges Due to Electrical Shock and Electrocution Hazards. 
*Frigidaire (Electrolux) Recalls Side by Side Refrigerators with Slim Ice Buckets Due to Choking and Laceration Hazards. 

===2023===
*Frigidaire (Electrolux) Recalls Gas Cooktops Due to Risk of Gas Leak, Fire Hazard.
*Frigidaire (Electrolux) Recalls Laundry units Due to Risk of Fire Hazard.

<doc id="1075239" wikidata="Q451075" url="?curid=1075239" title="Albert Hammond">
<text>Albert Louis Hammond OBE (born 18 May 1944) is a British-Gibraltarian singer, songwriter and record producer. A prolific songwriter, he also collaborated with other songwriters such as Mike Hazlewood, John Bettis, Hal David, Diane Warren, Holly Knight, Carole Bayer Sager and Roy Orbison.

Hammond wrote commercially successful singles for artists including Celine Dion, Joe Dolan, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Leo Sayer, Tina Turner, Glen Campbell, Julio Iglesias, Willie Nelson, Lynn Anderson and Bonnie Tyler, and bands Ace of Base, Air Supply, Blue Mink, Chicago, Heart, Living in a Box, the Carpenters, the Hollies, the Pipkins, Starship, and Westlife. Notable songs co-written by Hammond include &quot;Make Me an Island&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Such a Good Looking Woman&quot; by Joe Dolan, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; by Starship, &quot;One Moment in Time&quot; sung by Whitney Houston, &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot;, a hit for the Hollies, &quot;To All the Girls I&#x27;ve Loved Before&quot;, a Julio Iglesias/Willie Nelson duet, and &quot;When I Need You&quot; by Leo Sayer. In 2015, he received the British Academy&#x27;s Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection. 

He is also a solo singer in his own right. His biggest (and only top 20) U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; hit was &quot;It Never Rains in Southern California&quot;, No. 5 in 1972. Other songs of his include &quot;Down by the River&quot;, &quot;The Free Electric Band&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Train&quot;, and &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;. For a time, he was part of the Family Dogg, a vocal band with whom he had the hit &quot;A Way of Life&quot;. He has also produced for a number of other artists.

== Early life and success ==
Hammond was born in London, after his family had been evacuated from Gibraltar during World War II. Shortly after the war they returned to Gibraltar where he grew up. In 1960, he started in music with Gibraltarian band The Diamond Boys, which had no real commercial success, but played a part in Spain&#x27;s introduction to pop and rock music. The Diamond Boys performed at the first nightclubs in Madrid to stage modern bands, alongside Spanish rock and roll pioneers such as Miguel Ríos. In 1966, Hammond co-founded the British vocal band the Family Dogg, reaching number 6 on the UK Singles Chart with &quot;A Way of Life&quot; in 1969, taken from the album of the same name.

== Career ==

In 1970, at age 26, Hammond moved to the United States, continuing his professional career as a musician. However, he had his greatest commercial success in mainland Europe. He is known for his successful singles of the 1970s, released on Columbia subsidiary Mums Records: &quot;Down by the River&quot;, &quot;It Never Rains in Southern California&quot;, &quot;The Free Electric Band&quot; (his only single to chart in the UK), &quot;Half a Million Miles from Home&quot;, &quot;If You Gotta Break Another Heart&quot;, &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Die in an Air Disaster&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Train&quot; and &quot;99 Miles from L.A.&quot; In 1970, under the name &#x27;Steve &amp; Albert&#x27;, Hammond joined forces with Steve Rowland for the single &quot;Follow the Bouncing Ball&quot;, which they heavily promoted, particularly in the UK, where they appeared on &quot;Top Of The Pops&quot; and &quot;The Basil Brush Show&quot;, but the single failed to chart.

Hammond also wrote songs for others with frequent collaborator Mike Hazlewood. These include &quot;Little Arrows&quot; for Leapy Lee, &quot;Make Me an Island&quot; (1969) (which Hammond himself recorded in a Spanish disco-style in 1979), and &quot;You&#x27;re Such a Good Looking Woman&quot; (1970) for Joe Dolan, &quot;Gimme Dat Ding&quot; for the Pipkins in 1970 (itself a cover from the Freddie and the Dreamers album &quot;Oliver in the Overworld&quot;), &quot;Good Morning Freedom&quot; for Blue Mink, &quot;Freedom Come, Freedom Go&quot; for the Fortunes in 1971 and &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot; which was a hit for the Hollies in 1974. In 1971, Hammond also sang on Michael Chapman&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Wrecked Again&quot;, and worked briefly with the Magic Lanterns on recordings of his and Hazlewood&#x27;s songs, and other material.

Written with Carole Bayer Sager, &quot;When I Need You&quot; was first recorded by Hammond on his 1976 album &quot;When I Need You&quot;. Produced by Richard Perry, Leo Sayer&#x27;s version made No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in February 1977. Commercially successful worldwide, it reached No. 1 in Canada (&quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles, also for two weeks), and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for a week in May 1977. Leapy Lee released a version of &quot;When I Need You&quot; on his first recording since 1970.

In 1991, Hammond co-wrote &quot;When You Tell Me That You Love Me&quot; recorded by Diana Ross, which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2005, Ross recorded the song again, this time as a duet with Westlife. Again the song reached No. 2 in the UK.

In 2005, he released &quot;Revolution of the Heart&quot; (where Todd Sharpville was his music director), and the single &quot;This Side of Midnight&quot;.

In 2008, Hammond met Kasaan Steigen of the Los Angeles-based Trigger Management who became his personal manager, during which time Hammond collaborated with British singer Duffy and others. Duffy&#x27;s resulting album, &quot;Endlessly&quot;, co-written and co-produced by Hammond, was released in November 2010.

In 2010, Hammond also worked on &quot;Legend&quot;, a new recording of duets of his most successful singles, featuring artists including Elena Paparizou and Bonnie Tyler. It was released on Sony Spain on 23 November that year.

== Personal life ==
From his first marriage, Hammond has two children. In 1979, he married Argentinian Claudia Fernández, a former model.

His son, Albert Hammond, Jr. is a member of the rock band The Strokes.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 1987, Hammond&#x27;s composition with Diane Warren &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; (recorded by Starship) was nominated for an Oscar, Golden Globe and Grammy Award. In 1988, Hammond won an Emmy Award for the song &quot;One Moment in Time&quot;, a song he wrote along with John Bettis for NBC Sports&#x27; coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics.

In 2000, he received the Order of the British Empire (OBE). 

On 19 June 2008, Hammond was inducted in the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Half Man Half Biscuit paid tribute to Hammond in their 1986 track &quot;Albert Hammond Bootleg&quot; originally on The Trumpton Riots EP and later added to the 2003 re-release of Back in the DHSS.

In May 2015, Hammond collected the Ivor Novello award for outstanding song collection.

In 2023 he received the Ministry of Culture Lifetime Achievement Award.

<doc id="1075246" wikidata="Q1267122" url="?curid=1075246" title="Assyrian siege of Jerusalem">
<text>The Assyrian siege of Jerusalem (c. 701 BC) was an aborted siege of Jerusalem, then capital of the Kingdom of Judah, carried out by Sennacherib, king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The siege concluded Sennacharib&#x27;s campaign in the Levant, in which he attacked the fortified cities and devastated the countryside of Judah in a campaign of subjugation. Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem, but did not capture it.

Sennacherib&#x27;s Annals describe how the king trapped Hezekiah of Judah in Jerusalem &quot;like a caged bird&quot; and later returned to Assyria when he received tribute from Judah. In the Hebrew Bible, Hezekiah is described as paying 300 talents of silver and 30 talents of gold to Assyria. The biblical story claims that Sennacherib marched on Jerusalem with his army only to have it struck down near the gates of Jerusalem by an angel, prompting his retreat to Nineveh.

According to biblical archaeological theory, Siloam tunnel and the Broad Wall in Jerusalem were built by Hezekiah in preparation for the impending siege.

==Background==
In 720 BC, the Assyrian army captured Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel, and carried away many Israelites into captivity. The virtual destruction of Israel left the southern kingdom, Judah, to fend for itself among warring Near-Eastern kingdoms. After the fall of the northern kingdom, the kings of Judah tried to extend their influence and protection to those inhabitants who had not been exiled. They also sought to extend their authority northward into areas previously controlled by the Kingdom of Israel. The latter part of the reigns of King Ahaz and King Hezekiah were periods of stability during which Judah was able to consolidate both politically and economically. Although Judah was a vassal of Assyria during this time and paid an annual tribute to the powerful empire, it was the most important state between Assyria and Egypt.

When Hezekiah became king of Judah, he initiated widespread religious changes, including the breaking of religious idols. He re-captured Philistine-occupied lands in the Negev desert, formed alliances with Ascalon and Egypt, and made a stand against Assyria by refusing to pay tribute. In response, Sennacherib attacked Judah, laying siege to Jerusalem.

==Siege==
Sources from both sides claimed victory, the Judahites (or biblical authors) in the Tanakh, and Sennacherib in his prism. Sennacherib claimed the siege and capture of many Judaean cities, but only the siege—not capture—of Jerusalem.

===Hebrew account===

The story of the Assyrian siege is told in the biblical books of Isaiah (7th century BC), Second Kings (mid-6th century BC) and Chronicles (c. 350–300 BC). As the Assyrians began their invasion, King Hezekiah began preparations to protect Jerusalem. In an effort to deprive the Assyrians of water, springs outside the city were blocked. Workers then dug a 533-meter tunnel to the Spring of Gihon, providing the city with fresh water. Additional siege preparations included fortification of the existing walls, construction of towers, and the erection of a new reinforcing wall. Hezekiah gathered the citizens in the square and encouraged them by reminding them that the Assyrians possessed only &quot;an arm of flesh&quot;, but the Judeans had the protection of Yahweh.

According to 2 Kings 18, while Sennacherib was besieging Lachish, he received a message from Hezekiah offering to pay tribute in exchange for Assyrian withdrawal. According to the Hebrew Bible, Hezekiah paid 300 talents of silver and 30 talents of gold to Assyria—a price so heavy that he was forced to empty the temple and royal treasury of silver and strip the gold from the doorposts of Solomon&#x27;s Temple. Nevertheless, Sennacherib marched on Jerusalem with a large army. When the Assyrian force arrived, its field commander Rabshakeh brought a message from Sennacherib. In an attempt to demoralize the Judeans, the field commander announced to the people on the city walls that Hezekiah was deceiving them, and that Yahweh could not deliver Jerusalem from the king of Assyria. He listed the gods of other nations defeated by Sennacherib then asked, &quot;Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me?&quot;
During the siege, Hezekiah dressed in sackcloth (a sign of mourning), but the prophet Isaiah assured him that the city would be delivered and Sennacherib would fail. According to Isaiah, an angel then killed 185,000 Assyrian troops overnight. Some scholars believe this number has been transcribed incorrectly, with one study suggesting the number was originally 5,180. Another scholar advises that the biblical narrative is marked by legendary embellishments that end with a miracle that saves Jerusalem. Dan&#x27;el Kahn says that the large number is an exaggeration, but 5,180 is far too low.

===Assyrian account ===
Sennacherib&#x27;s Prism, which details the events of Sennacherib&#x27;s campaign against Judah, was discovered in the ruins of Nineveh in 1830, and is now stored at the Oriental Institute in Chicago, Illinois. The Prism dates from about 690 BC, and its account is taken from an earlier cuneiform inscription dating to 700 BC. The text of the prism boasts how Sennacherib destroyed 46 of Judah&#x27;s cities and trapped Hezekiah in Jerusalem &quot;like a caged bird.&quot; The text goes on to describe how the &quot;terrifying splendor&quot; of the Assyrian army caused the Arabs and mercenaries reinforcing the city to desert. It adds that the Assyrian king returned to Assyria where he later received a large tribute from Judah. This description varies somewhat from the Jewish version in the Tanakh. The massive Assyrian casualties mentioned in the Tanakh are not mentioned in the Assyrian version.

After he besieged Jerusalem, Sennacherib was able to give the surrounding towns to Assyrian vassal rulers in Ekron, Gaza and Ashdod. His army still existed when he conducted campaigns in 702 BC and from 699 BC until 697 BC, when he undertook several campaigns in the mountains east of Assyria, during one of which he received tribute from the Medes. In 696 BC and 695 BC, he sent expeditions into Anatolia, where several vassals had rebelled following the death of Sargon II. Around 690 BC, he campaigned in the northern Arabian deserts, conquering Dumat al-Jandal, where the queen of the Arabs had taken refuge.

===Other theories===
Herodotus wrote that the Assyrian army was overrun by mice when attacking Egypt. Some Biblical scholars take this to an allusion that the Assyrian army suffered the effects of a mouse- or rat-borne disease such as bubonic plague. Even without relying on that explanation, John Bright suggested it was an epidemic of some kind that saved Jerusalem. The Babylonian historian Berossus also wrote that it was a plague that defeated the Assyrian army in the siege.

Henry T. Aubin writes in &quot;The Rescue of Jerusalem: The Alliance Between Hebrews and Africans in 701 B.C.&quot; that the Assyrian army was routed by an Egyptian army under Kushite (Nubian) command. However, Nazek Matty argues in his archaeological analysis that Aubin&#x27;s Egyptian hypothesis is unlikely.

==In popular culture==
An 1813 poem by Lord Byron, The Destruction of Sennacherib, commemorates Sennacherib&#x27;s campaign in Judea from the Hebrew point of view. Written in anapestic tetrameter, the poem was popular in school recitations.

<doc id="1075261" wikidata="Q53257" url="?curid=1075261" title="Mitsubishi Electric">
<text>is a Japanese multinational electronics and electrical equipment manufacturing company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The company was established in 1921 as a spin-off from the electrical machinery manufacturing division of Mitsubishi Shipbuilding (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) at the Kobe Shipyard. 

A member of the Mitsubishi Group, Mitsubishi Electric produces elevators and escalators, high-end home appliances, air conditioning, factory automation systems, train systems, electric motors, pumps, semiconductors, digital signage, and satellites.

==History==
Mitsubishi Electric was established as a spin-off from the Mitsubishi Group&#x27;s other core company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, then Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, as the latter divested a marine electric motor factory in Kobe, Nagasaki. It has since diversified to become the major electronics company.

Mitsubishi Electric held the record for the fastest elevator in the world, in the 70-story Yokohama Landmark Tower, from 1993 to 2005.

The company acquired Nihon Kentetsu, a Japanese home appliance manufacturer, in 2005.

In 2015 the company acquired DeLclima, an Italian company that designs and produces HVAC and HPAC units, renamed Mitsubishi Electric Hydronics &amp; IT Cooling Systems SpA in 2017.

In early 2020, Mitsubishi Electric was identified as a victim of the year-long cyberattacks perpetrated by the Chinese hackers.

In 2023, Mitsubishi Electric announced its plans to spend 100 billion yen to build a new semiconductor factory in Kumamoto Prefecture, with a target date of April 2026 to begin production.

==Products==

In 2023, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)’s Annual PCT Review ranked Mitsubishi Electric&#x27;s number of patent applications published under the PCT System as 4th in the world, with 2,152 patent applications being published during 2023.

Some product lines of Mitsubishi Electric, such as air conditioners, overlap with the products from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries partly because the companies share the same root.
* Air conditioning systems

<doc id="1075262" wikidata="Q1292143" url="?curid=1075262" title="Sport in Timor-Leste">
<text>Timor-Leste is a relatively new country. As one of the world&#x27;s poorest countries, athletic activities are limited at the professional level.

==International sports associations==
Timor-Leste belongs to numerous international sport associations, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC board has granted full recognition to the East Timorese Olympic Committee (COTL). The IOC allowed a symbolic four-member East Timor team to take part in the 2000 Sydney Games under the Olympic flag as &quot;Independent Olympic Athletes.&quot; The Federação Timor-Leste de Atletismo had joined the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The Federação de Badminton de Timor-Leste joined the International Badminton Federation (IBF) in April 2003. The Timor-Leste Cycling Federation joined the Union Cycliste Internationale. Confederacao do Desporto de Timor Leste also joined the International Weightlifting Federation. East Timor is also a full member of the International Table-Tennis Federation (ITTF). In September 2005, the Timor-Leste national football team joined FIFA, while the men&#x27;s national basketball team joined FIBA in 2013.

==Participation in international events==
Timor-Leste has taken part in multiple international sporting events. Although the athletes came back with no medals, East Timorese athletes had the opportunity to compete with other Southeast Asian athletes in the 2003 Southeast Asian Games held in Vietnam in 2003. In the 2003 ASEAN Paralympics Games, also held in Vietnam, Timor-Leste won a bronze medal. In the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, six athletes participated in three sports: athletics, weightlifting and boxing. Timor-Leste won three medals in Arnis at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games. Timor-Leste was one of the competing nations in the first Lusophony Games, winning a bronze medal in the women&#x27;s volleyball competition (finishing third out of three teams, despite the fact the team lost all three games in which it competed). On 30 October 2008, Timor-Leste earned their first international points in a FIFA match with a 2–2 draw against Cambodia.

<text>7L &amp; Esoteric (7LES) are an American underground hip hop duo from Boston, Massachusetts, known for battle rhymes and boom bap production. 7L is the duo&#x27;s DJ/producer and Esoteric is the MC. 7L &amp; Esoteric are both prominent members of underground hip-hop collectives Army of the Pharaohs and Demigodz, as well as being 2/3 of Czarface along with Wu-Tang Clan member Inspectah Deck.

==History==

===&quot;The Soul Purpose&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Connection&quot; &amp; &quot;DC2: Bars of Death&quot; (2000–2005)===
7L &amp; Esoteric released their debut LP &quot;The Soul Purpose&quot; in the summer of 2001. The single &quot;Call Me E.S.&quot; charted at #83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; hip-hop singles chart. 

=== &quot;Czarface&quot; &amp; &quot;Every Hero Needs a Villain&quot; (2011–present) ===
In 2011, it was announced that 7L &amp; Esoteric have formed a hip hop trio with Wu-Tang Clan member Inspectah Deck called Czarface and that they were working on a self-titled debut album. The album was released on February 19, 2013. The album features guest appearances from Roc Marciano, Oh No, Ghostface Killah, Action Bronson, Cappadonna and Vinnie Paz. The album&#x27;s production comes from 7L, Spada4 and DJ Premier. In 2014, 7L produced the track &quot;The King&#x27;s Curse&quot; on the Army of the Pharaohs album Heavy Lies the Crown, their second album in 2014 (next to In Death Reborn). Esoteric has a verse on the track, which makes it the first appearance of the duo together since the Czarface album. Later that year, the duo appeared on a track called &quot;Hard Hats and Timbs&quot; from the EP &quot;Year of the Hyenas&quot; by Army of the Pharaohs rappers Reef the Lost Cauze and King Syze. The track features raps from Esoteric and production from 7L.

A sequel to &quot;Czarface&quot; called &quot;Every Hero Needs a Villain&quot; was released on June 16, 2015. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Deadly Class&quot; (featuring Meyhem Lauren), was released on April 7, 2015.

<text>Ainsworth Rand Spofford (September 12, 1825 – August 11, 1908) was an American journalist, prolific writer and the sixth Librarian of Congress. He served as librarian from 1864 to 1897 under the administration of ten presidents. A great admirer of Benjamin Franklin, he wrote a twenty-one page introduction in Franklin&#x27;s autobiography, which he edited and published.

==Early life==
Spofford was born in Gilmanton, New Hampshire. Ill health prevented him from attending Amherst College. He instead, at age 19, moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he became a bookseller, publisher, and newspaper man at &quot;The Cincinnati Commercial Tribune&quot;.

In 1849, Spofford founded the Literary Club of Cincinnati with John Celivergos Zachos, Stanley Matthews and nine others. Prominent members included Rutherford B. Hayes and Alphonso Taft; notable club guests Ralph Waldo Emerson, Booker T. Washington, Mark Twain, and Robert Frost. In 1850 prominent abolitionist and woman&#x27;s rights activist John Celivergos Zachos named his son Ainsworth to honor Spofford.

In 1851, in response to the Fugitive Slave Law, he published the pamphlet &quot;The Higher Law, Tried by Reason and Authority&quot;, which argued that &quot;Injustice is the only treason; no law can legalize it, no constitution can sanction it.&quot; Readers included Emerson, who shared Spofford&#x27;s antislavery principles. In 1859 Spofford became associate editor of the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial&quot;. He was also active in Republican politics and was a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention, where John C. Frémont was nominated.

While in Washington, D.C., in 1861, shortly after reporting on the First Battle of Bull Run for &quot;The Cincinnati Commercial&quot;, Spofford accepted the position of Chief Assistant Librarian of Congress under the Librarian of Congress John G. Stephenson. Once Spofford learned of the impending retirement of Stephenson, Spofford gathered enough political endorsements for the position, which later led President Abraham Lincoln to promote Spofford to the post of Librarian of Congress in 1864.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1873.

==Librarian of Congress==

Spofford served as the Librarian of Congress from 1864 to 1897, a tenure that saw the expansion of the library&#x27;s collections and notable changes in its methods of collection development. According to the library&#x27;s published history, Spofford contributed to the Jeffersonian vision for the library that a &quot;democratic form of government depended on a comprehensive base of knowledge and information.&quot;

Spofford is generally credited with overseeing the expansion of the Library from a Congressional resource into a national institution. During his tenure, the library&#x27;s collection expanded from over 60,000 items to more than one million. Among his more noted acquisitions was the purchase of a vast collection of early American archives from noted archivist Peter Force. Spofford&#x27;s hopes were to follow the great library models of Europe, in which &quot;the library would be a comprehensive collection of the literature of the nation.&quot; Beginning in the 1830s, the Library of Congress began to receive foreign governmental documents and publications. By the late 1860s, Spofford convinced Congress to allow the library to become the repository for international documents. He stated that &quot;there is almost no work, within the vast range of literature and science, which may not at some time prove useful to the legislature of a great nation.&quot; Spofford&#x27;s championing of the copyright law, passed on July 8, 1870, also expanded the library&#x27;s collection through the copyright registration deposit mandate. The law &quot;centralized all U.S. copyright registration and deposit activities at the Library.&quot; and stipulated that two copies of every &quot;book pamphlet, map, print, photograph, and piece of music registered for copyright be deposited in the Library.&quot; In arguing for the deposit requirement, Spofford suggested that the legislature would &quot;provide a repository of American culture.&quot; In his argument for the copyright law to Congress, he wrote that &quot;the Public intelligence and welfare are promoted by every extension of the means of acquiring knowledge.&quot; The law established the library as the de facto national library of the United States and &quot;essentially resolved [any] debate over which institution would serve as America&#x27;s national library.&quot;

Spofford had persuaded Congress to expand the library&#x27;s space within the Capitol in 1865. As it was becoming the nation&#x27;s copyright depository happened at about the same time as two major acquisitions: Congress authorized the transfer of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s collection to the Library of Congress and the purchase of the large private collection of Peter Force. Subsequently, the library quickly outgrew its new space, and Spofford proposed construction of a new building for the Library in 1872. Congress quickly agreed, but the project was bogged down in bickering over details. As the collection outgrew the space for it, books and boxes piled conspicuously on the floor. Members of Congress who used the library could hardly find room to work. Although everyone recognized the need for a new building, it took more than a decade to resolve all the issues. Finally, Congress appropriated funds for the new building in 1886. A dispute with the architect further delayed the start of construction until 1888. The building was finally completed in 1897 and is now known as the Thomas Jefferson Building.

In 1897, Spofford stepped aside in favor of a younger librarian, John Russell Young, and returned to his old post of Chief Assistant Librarian, where he remained until his death. Spofford also held a post as professor and department head of library science at the Columbian University in Washington, D.C. During his retirement, Spofford wrote and published &quot;A Book for All Readers&quot;, and was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;written from the fullness of knowledge and experience of a veteran librarian for the guidance of younger members of his chosen profession.&quot;

==Posthumous reception==

While doing research on Spofford, John Y. Cole discovered that while Ainsworth&#x27;s ashes were interred at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C., his tombstone was blank, although his wife&#x27;s name was there. Spofford was also not listed in the cemetery&#x27;s handout that noted the famous people buried there. Although Cole was responsible for bringing this to the attention of some Spofford descendants, nothing was done to correct this until 2004, when John Spofford Morgan, Ainsworth Spofford&#x27;s great-grandson (1917–2015), saw to it that the situation was remedied. Today, the tombstone reads, &quot;Ainsworth Rand Spofford, 1825–1908, Librarian of Congress, 1864–1897, Appointed by President Lincoln.&quot; His name is also now listed in the cemetery&#x27;s handout on notable figures whose tombstones can be viewed there.

<doc id="1075294" wikidata="Q7994271" url="?curid=1075294" title="White-Westinghouse">
<text>White-Westinghouse is an American home appliance brand used under license by trademark owner Westinghouse Licensing Corporation. It was created in 1975 when White Consolidated Industries bought the Westinghouse Electric Corporation&#x27;s major appliance business. White Consolidated Industries was in turn acquired by Electrolux in 1986.

Electrolux made White-Westinghouse branded appliances as recently as 2006.

==History==
Westinghouse entered the major appliance industry by acquiring the &quot;Copeman Electric Stove Company&quot; in 1917. It later moved production from Flint, Michigan to Mansfield, Ohio. Copeman had begun manufacturing its first electric ranges in 1914. Electric ranges were first demonstrated by Thomas Ahearn in 1892, gained in popularity as electrification became widespread throughout the United States.

The company claims to have made several important innovations:
* 1930s refrigerators with sealed refrigeration units
* 1930s room air conditioners
* 1930s portable dishwashers
* 1939 automatic washing machine that was not bolted to the floor.
* 1950s auto-defrost refrigerators.

The company manufactured both large and small appliances for many years. Appliances bearing the White-Westinghouse name were made by Electrolux after 1998 under license from Paramount Global through its Westinghouse brand management subsidiary.

In the mid-1990s, household products and electronics bearing the White-Westinghouse name were sold by Kmart stores in the United States. This essentially gave Kmart a private-label brand in the value category for household goods. This agreement was between Windmere-Durable Holdings, Salton/Maxim Housewares and New M-Tech Corp., who licensed the name from the then Westinghouse Electric. Most larger-sized TVs were relabeled models produced by Daewoo Electronics Corp. This partnership dissolved in the early 2000s and many of the products were discontinued or switched to Kmart&#x27;s &quot;Home Essentials&quot; brand. Televisions continued to be produced by Daewoo, but were re-labeled as Curtis-Mathes, another brand licensed to Kmart for a brief period of time.

<text>The 2004 European Grand Prix (officially the 2004 Formula 1 Allianz Grand Prix of Europe) was a Formula One motor race held on 30 May 2004 at the Nürburgring. It was Race 7 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship.

==Friday drivers==
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.

== Report ==
=== Background ===
Michael Schumacher in the drivers&#x27; championship with twelve points ahead of Rubens Barrichello and with 18 points ahead of Jenson Button. In the constructors&#x27; championship, Ferrari led Renault with 36 points and BAR-Honda with 48 points.

Earlier in the week, Williams announced important changes to its technical organization chart. After 26 years, in fact, Patrick Head left the position of technical director, being replaced by Sam Michael, previously responsible for track operations. The replacement was also due to growing tensions between the English team and the BMW engine engineer, dissatisfied with the negative results in the first part of the season.

=== Qualifying ===
Michael Schumacher dominated qualifying and obtained his fifth pole position of the season with an advantage of more than six tenths over the second best time, set by Sato. Sato broke the overall lap record with a time of 1:27.691 in the first qualifying session, and also took his first front row start.

=== Race ===
At the start, Michael Schumacher retained the lead, behind the German driver Trulli overtook Sato, who, however, gave the place back to his rival in the first corner. Further back, Montoya was too late when braking for the corner: the Colombian ended up ramming his teammate Ralf Schumacher, who in turn hit da Matta&#x27;s Toyota. The latter and the German driver had to abandon the race, while Montoya returned to the pits with a damaged front wing and rejoined the race in last place.

A few corners after the start, Sato braked and Trulli took the opportunity to take second place. However, the Japanese didn&#x27;t give up and continued to have a heated duel with Trulli, in which he ultimately got the upper hand and Trulli lost places. At the end of the first lap, Michael Schumacher crossed the finish line ahead of Räikkönen, Alonso, Sato, Barrichello, Button and Trulli. The German Ferrari driver was significantly faster than Räikkönen, on whom he gained almost two seconds per lap. The Finn acted as a blocker against the chasing group, which was significantly faster, but could not overtake him and thus fell significantly behind Michael Schumacher.

Michael Schumacher opened the first series of pit stops on the 8th lap. A lap later, Räikkönen also refueled, and shortly after leaving the pits he parked his McLaren at the side of the track with a broken engine. In the following laps, all drivers made their first stop, with the exception of Barrichello, Coulthard and Fisichella, who started with a two-stop strategy. The Brazilian then led for a few laps before refueling on lap 16. The last driver to make his first stop was Fisichella on lap 24. Michael Schumacher continued to lead the race ahead of Sato, Barrichello, Button, Trulli, Alonso and Webber. Further back, Montoya struggled to recover from the first lap accident, while Coulthard retired after having to retire with engine failure like his teammate.

The second set of stops allowed Barrichello to overtake Sato; Behind the Japanese were Button, Trulli, Alonso and Webber. Virtually nothing happened until lap 42, when Alonso opened the third and final series of pit stops. Barrichello overtook Sato again, but the Japanese driver, who had less fuel on board, attacked him on lap 46. Sato&#x27;s action was unsuccessful and in the end the two came into contact: the BAR driver damaged his front wing, while Barrichello&#x27;s car suffered no significant damage. Sato returned to the pits to change the nose, but shortly afterwards his car&#x27;s gearbox gave up. Button moved up to third place. There were no further notable events and Michael Schumacher won the sixth of seven races since the start of the season; Behind him were Barrichello, Button, Trulli, Alonso, Fisichella, Webber and Montoya.

Schumacher and Barrichello left the champagne unsprayed after the death of former Fiat chairman Umberto Agnelli, who had died of lymphatic cancer aged 69 on 27 May.

<text>Eden Colvile (12 February 1819 – 2 April 1893) was a businessman primarily notable as the governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, a huge organisation set up for the North American fur trade but also instrumental in the early history of Canada.

==Family background==
Colvile was born at Langley Farm, part of the Langley Park Estate, near Beckenham, Kent, England, son of Andrew Colvile and Mary Louisa Eden. His father was a merchant and member of board of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. His mother was fifth daughter of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, and thus connected to an influential family of politicians and diplomats.

Eden Colville was one of four brothers and 12 sisters:

#Eleanor Colvile (1808–1824)
#James William Colvile (1810–1880) was a lawyer, civil servant and then judge in India, and a judge on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the court of last resort for the British colonies.
#John Colvile (1811–1830)
#Isabella Colvile (1812–1896) married a clergyman in rural England and was the mother of Francis Marindin, a key figure in early football.
#George Colvile (1813–1814)
#Louisa Colvile (1815–1836)
#Emily Colvile (1817–1889)
#Eden Colvile (1819–1893) was appointed Governor of Rupert&#x27;s Land and also governor of the HBC.
#Jean Colville (1820–1895)
#Georgiana Mary Colvile (1822–1889) married Frederic Rogers, 1st Baron Blachford, a mandarin of Whitehall. 
#Charlotte Colvile (1823–)
#Isalen Mary Colvile (1825–) 
#Caroline Colvile (1827–1846)
#Margaret Agnes Colvile (1829–) in 1858 married the writer and publisher Charles Kegan Paul.
#Alice Douglas Colvile (1830–1845) 
#Katharine Colvile (July 1834 – November 1834)

The son of his sister Margaret was named after him; Eden Paul became a socialist physician and translator.

==Education and early career==
Colvile was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. After graduating from Cambridge in 1841, he travelled to Lower Canada (Quebec) to manage the seigneury of Beauharnois for the North American Colonial Association of Ireland, of which his father was deputy governor. He served one year in the Legislative Assembly in 1844.
==Canada==
His relationship with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, North America&#x27;s oldest company (established by English royal charter in 1670), began in 1848 when he accompanied George Simpson to Rupert&#x27;s Land, travelling as far as the Red River Colony. After his return to England, he was soon appointed Governor of Rupert&#x27;s Land, relieving Simpson of his obligations inland. After seeing the troubles which rocked the Red River Colony in the late 1840s with the Guilleume Sayer trial, the Foss-Pelly slander trial and the difficulties between the Presbyterian Scots and the Anglicans, the Company needed someone like Colvile who would wield a firm hand in the Settlement. However, he spent his first winter on the Pacific coast, sorting out the affairs of the troubled Pugets Sound Agricultural Company.

In August 1850, he arrived in the Red River Colony with his wife, Anne Maxwell. They took up residence in the &quot;Big House&quot; at Lower Fort Garry. He quickly took charge of the affairs of the colony. He took over as president of the Council of Assiniboia, removed Adam Thom from his position of power, and arranged a compromise between the Presbyterians and Anglicans. Solving the difficulties which arose from the Foss-Pelly slander trial took more delicate maneuvering, but he succeeded by removing the major players in the trial from the Settlement. After accomplishing the tasks he was sent to fix, he and his wife returned to England in 1852.

==Later life==
He took on many of his father&#x27;s directorships which included the chairmanship of the board of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. He joined the London committee of the HBC in 1854. After a reorganization of the HBC in the mid-1860s where he was only one of two to remain, he became deputy governor in 1871, governor in 1880 and retired in 1889. He died in Lustleigh, Devon, on Easter Sunday 1893.

<text>Harsha Bhogle (born 19 July 1961) is an Indian cricket commentator and journalist. Bhogle has cemented his reputation for being a notable personality in the global cricket broadcasting industry.

== Early life ==

Bhogle was born into a Marathi-speaking family in Hyderabad. He is the son of Achyut D. Bhogle, a professor of French language, and Shalini Bhogle, a professor of psychology. During an interview with The Grade Cricketer podcast, Bhogle revealed that his mother&#x27;s family was originally from Lahore and she migrated to India as a child during the partition, in the middle of 1947. He attended Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet, and subsequently earned a B.Tech. degree in chemical engineering from Osmania University&#x27;s College of Technology in Hyderabad. He received a PGP (equivalent to an MBA) from Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad. He then joined an advertising agency for which he worked for two and a half years, following which he served at a sports management company for an equal period.

== Career ==
Early on, Bhogle played A Div cricket in Hyderabad and represented Osmania University at the Rohinton Baria Tournament. He started commentating at the age of 19 with All India Radio, while living in Hyderabad. In 1991–92, he became the first Indian commentator to be invited by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation during India&#x27;s cricket series before the 1992 Cricket World Cup. He has since worked for ABC Radio Grandstand during India&#x27;s Australian tours, and for eight years worked for the BBC as part of their commentary team in the 1996 and the 1999 Cricket World Cups.

Since 1995, he has been presenting live cricket from all around the world for ESPN STAR Sports and was part of the commentary team that included Ravi Shastri, Sunil Gavaskar, and Alan Wilkins along with Geoff Boycott and Navjot Singh Sidhu, for a few seasons, and later, Ian Chappell and Sanjay Manjrekar.

He covered the 2011–12 series in Australia solely for ABC Radio.

Bhogle has been covering all Indian Premier League seasons since 2009. He was dropped from the commentary team by BCCI in April 2016. No official reason was given, but according to media reports, it was due to a combination of factors including criticism from Indian players and an incident during the opening game of the T20 World Cup where Bhogle&#x27;s access between Hindi and English commentary boxes was restricted.

He has hosted television programs such as &quot;Harsha Online&quot;, &quot;Harsha Unplugged&quot; and &quot;School Quiz Olympiad&quot; for ESPN and Star Sports.

Bhogle had a Television programme named after him, &quot;Harsha ki khoj&quot;(), that strove to find broadcasting talent in India.

Bhogle expanded his online presence by hosting &quot;Out of the Box with Harsha Bhogle&quot; on YouTube.

Bhogle was voted the favourite TV cricket commentator by ESPNcricinfo users based on a worldwide poll. Bhogle has also anchored BBC&#x27;s travel serial &quot;Travel India&quot; and Business Today Acumen Business Quiz and Debate competitions.

Bhogle was the advisor to the Mumbai Indians for the 2008 IPL.

Bhogle has published and authored a number of books, including a biography of Mohammad Azharuddin and a collection of columns in &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, &quot;Out of the Box – Watching the Game We Love&quot; and is also a columnist for the Chennai-based &quot;The Sportstar&quot; a subsidiary of The Hindu group of Publications under the title &quot;Hitting Hard&quot; by Bhogle. (2009). Bhogle has presented the program &quot;Travel India: With Harsha Bhogle&quot; on the Discovery channel and TLC.

In the 2011 World Cup held in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, he anchored the pre and post match shows that featured Simon Hughes, Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sunil Gavaskar, Tony Greig and Sourav Ganguly.

In 2013, he was given the seat in commentary by Ian Bishop to conduct the final interviews when Sachin Tendulkar played his final test.

Bhogle currently hosts a weekly show called &quot;This Week&#x27;s Special&quot; aired on Star Sports. The show takes the viewers back in time to make them relive cricketing memories from the past. The first episode was aired from 1 October 2015. On 10 April 2016 His IPL contract as a commentator was terminated. The decision came as a surprise for the voice of Indian cricket since he had conducted the Season 9 draft auction, featured in the league&#x27;s promotional videos, was in the commentators’ 51-day-long duty roster, and even had his flight booked by the production house. Board (BCCI) officials said Bhogle had an angry exchange with a cricket official at the venue as he wanted him to open the door, and this reached the Nagpur-based BCCI president Shashank Manohar. Those in the know said this incident was the trigger that resulted in Bhogle losing out.

He has been a part of Times Group subsidiary Cricbuzz since 2016 and writes articles as well as doing video analyses with them.

Bhogle is currently one of the Board of Governors of IIM Udaipur.

On 16 May 2019, he was named among the 24 commentators for the 2019 ICC World Cup held in England and Wales.

During the 2nd test of Bangladesh&#x27;s tour of India, the 1st D/N test of both Indian and Bangladeshi cricket teams, a few Bangladeshi batsmen were struck by the pink ball. Bhogle raised concerns about the visibility of the ball, with Sanjay Manjrekar, his fellow commentator, replying that only people like Bhogle would need to ask such questions as they have not played at that level. This on-air spat raised many eyebrows.

== Books ==
Bhogle and his wife Anita have written books titled &quot;The Winning Way&quot; and &quot;The Winning Way 2.0&quot; based on their business knowledge drawn from the sporting world. He has also authored a biography of Mohammad Azharuddin, and published a collection of articles in a book called &quot;Out of the Box&quot;.

===&quot;The Winning Way&quot;===

The Winning Way is a 2011 debut book by Harsha Bhogle and Anita Bhogle, published by Westland And Tranquebar Press. It is Harsha&#x27;s first book published as an author. The pair stated that the book took them two years to write, with &quot;The Hindu&quot; calling it &quot;lively&quot;.

&quot;The Winning Way&quot; is a management advice book that focuses on what comprises a successful athlete and shows how management teams could apply that to their work force. &quot;The Hindu&quot; reviewed the book, calling it a &quot;right pick as a playbook for managers.&quot; &quot;Business Today praised the book, saying it &quot;captures the essence of values in sport, values that make champion players and champion teams&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Bhogle is married to Anita, his classmate from IIM Ahmedabad, and they live in Mumbai with their two adult sons. Bhogle has been a vegetarian since age 17.

The couple run a sport-based communication consultancy called &quot;Prosearch&quot;.

<doc id="1075315" wikidata="Q6761913" url="?curid=1075315" title="Marian Hobbs">
<text>Marian Leslie Hobbs (born 18 December 1947) is a New Zealand politician who was a Labour Member of Parliament from 1996 to 2008. She was initially a list MP and then (from 1999) represented the electorate. She served as Minister for the Environment and, later, as one of two Assistant Speakers of the House of Representatives. She represented the Dunedin constituency of the Otago Regional Council from 2019 to 2021.

==Early life==
Hobbs was raised in Christchurch and was educated at St Dominic&#x27;s College, Dunedin. Before entering politics, Hobbs worked as a teacher at Aranui High School and was the principal of Avonside Girls&#x27; High School in Christchurch. She helped to establish the Chippenham commune in Christchurch and is by religious affiliation a Friend (Quaker). In 1993, Hobbs was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

After leaving school, Hobbs renounced her Catholic beliefs, later becoming a Quaker. At university she was a student radical and joined the Communist Party. Hobbs marched with HART in the 1981 Springbok tour to oppose Apartheid. After the tour she developed a strong interest in Māori issues and became fluent in the language. In May 1996, she was offered the position of principal of Wellington Girls&#x27; College, but never ended up taking the job, instead moving into Parliament on the Labour list.

== Member of Parliament ==


Hobbs stood unsuccessfully in the 1994 Selwyn by-election where she came a distant third. She contested the electorate in the and came second to National Party&#x27;s Doug Kidd, but entered Parliament via the Labour list, where she was ranked 12th. Upon entering parliament Hobbs was designated opposition spokesperson for broadcasting, communications and information technology by leader Helen Clark.

In the lead up to the following election Hobbs wavered between again contesting Kaikoura or , having moved to Wellington permanently after becoming a list MP. She chose to stand in Wellington Central because she lived there and stated she hated travelling. Hobbs was selected as Labour candidate for the seat over Victoria University dean of law Professor Brian Brooks, teacher Elaine Whelan and former Wellington City Councillor Hazel Armstrong. In the 1999 election, Hobbs won the Wellington Central electorate, defeating the incumbent member, ACT Party leader Richard Prebble.

===Cabinet minister===
After Labour&#x27;s electoral victory in 1999, Hobbs joined the Cabinet, becoming Minister for the Environment, Minister of Biosecurity, Minister of Broadcasting, and Minister Responsible for the National Library of New Zealand and Archives New Zealand. In February 2001, she briefly resigned from Cabinet while an enquiry investigated her allowance-claims; she returned in late March after receiving official clearance.

As Minister of Broadcasting, Hobbs set a code of practice for New Zealand commercial radio, specifying that 20 percent of music played should have New Zealand origins.

Following the 2002 general election, Hobbs continued as the Minister for the Environment and Minister Responsible for the National Library and Archives New Zealand, and picked up new roles as Minister of Disarmament and Arms Control, Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for Official Development Assistance, Associate Minister for Biosecurity, Associate Minister of Education, and Minister Responsible for Urban Affairs.

===Resignation from Cabinet===
In 2004, Hobbs told Prime Minister Helen Clark that she did not expect to seek a post in Cabinet again after the 2005 general election. Hobbs contested the election and was returned to the Wellington Central electorate with a 6,180 majority over the National Party candidate, Mark Blumsky. She made her decision about not seeking a Cabinet role public during the negotiations to form a government in October 2005.

After resigning from Cabinet, Hobbs served briefly as Labour&#x27;s party Vice-President and became the Assistant Speaker of the House in March 2008, after Ann Hartley resigned.

In December 2006 Hobbs announced (during a radio interview) that she would not seek re-election at the 2008 general election, confirming much speculation to that effect. She was succeeded in Wellington Central by Grant Robertson, who had worked for her while she was a minister.

== Post-Parliamentary career ==
Before leaving Parliament, Hobbs signalled her intention to work as a teacher in the United Kingdom, in compensation for never having made a traditional working-holiday as a young woman. She spent two years as the Headteacher at Prince William School in Oundle, Northamptonshire, United Kingdom.

Hobbs stood as a Labour candidate for the Otago Regional Council at the 2019 local elections and was successful. On 23 October, she was elected as chair, with Michael Laws as her deputy. In a vote on 8 July 2020, she lost the role and was replaced by councillor Andrew Noone. She resigned from the council on 1 November 2021.

==Personal life==
Hobbs had one son, Daniel, with her first husband Walter Logeman. Her second marriage was to maths teacher Geoff Norris with whom she unexpectedly had a daughter, Claire.

Her father was Leslie Hobbs, a political journalist, who wrote &quot;The Thirty-Year Wonders&quot;, a history of the First and Second Labour Governments and their members.

<text>Charles Faulkner Bryan (July 26, 1911 – July 7, 1955) was an American composer, musician, music educator and collector of folk music.

==Life and career==
Bryan was born in McMinnville, Tennessee in 1911. He was attracted to music from a young age and became particularly interested in the music of the Appalachian region.

In addition to being a pioneer in the study of folk music, Bryan is considered by many to be one of Tennessee&#x27;s greatest composers and musicians. Bryan also taught at Tennessee Polytechnic Institute in Cookeville, Tennessee, where he was head of the Department of Music from 1936 to 1939.

During the Great Depression, he worked as a director of music and library projects of the federal Works Projects Administration in their southeastern region. He engaged in folklore studies to record and preserve music and other folklore of the Appalachian region.

In the post-World War II years, Bryan served on the faculty of George Peabody College (1947–1952) in Nashville, and served as president of the Tennessee Folklore Society. He taught at the Indian Spring School for Boys near Birmingham, Alabama for a brief period after it opened in 1952.

He died on July 7, 1955, in Pinson, Alabama.

==Legacy==
According to his biographer, Carolyn Livingston, Bryan was &quot;a pioneer in the study of American folk music&quot; who created in his students &quot;a sense of value for the folk ballads and hymns of Appalachia&quot;. He composed the music of &quot;Singin&#x27; Billy: A Folk Opera&quot; (1952), possibly his best known work, with Donald Davidson writing the libretto or text. &quot;Singin&#x27; Billy&quot; was the nickname of shape note composer and publisher William Walker. With George Pullen Jackson, he wrote the text &quot;American Folk Music for High School and other Choral Groups&quot;.

Bryan&#x27;s namesake son served as president and CEO of the Virginia Historical Society until retiring in November 2008.

In 1977, an historical marker honoring Bryan was erected in front of the Warren County courthouse in McMinnville. It reads, &quot;A native of Warren County, Bryan was a pioneer in the study of American folk music. Through his talented efforts this distinctively American form of musical expression gained worldwide fame and appreciation. He worked closely with the people of the Southern mountains and coves in the study of this music, but his work earned a permanent place of honor and distinction in the highest ranks of academic and scholarly achievement. Presented in his memory by a grateful community.&quot;

Tennessee Technological University&#x27;s Bryan Fine Arts Building (BFA) is home to the College of Fine Arts as well as the Wattenbarger Auditorium. Constructed in 1981, this building is named for Bryan. The Bryan Symphony Orchestra, composed of Tech Faculty, talented students, and area professionals is named in his honor and performs at the Bryan Fine Arts Center. In 2011, the School of Music at TTU hosted his biographer and members of Bryan&#x27;s family in a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s birth. TTU awarded a research grant to Director of Orchestras, Professor Dan Allcott, to create a Bryan archive at the university&#x27;s library. Allcott also created a modern performing edition of Bryan&#x27;s &quot;Bell Witch Cantata&quot; which had been premiered by Robert Shaw at Carnegie Hall in 1947. The Cantata had its first 21st century performances shortly afterward.

<doc id="1075340" wikidata="Q825539" url="?curid=1075340" title="Kelvinator">
<text>Kelvinator was an American home appliance manufacturer and a line of domestic refrigerators that was the company&#x27;s namesake. Although it is now defunct as a company, the name remains a brand owned by Electrolux AB. It takes its name from William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who developed the concept of absolute zero and for whom the Kelvin temperature scale is named. The name was thought appropriate for a company that manufactured ice-boxes and refrigerators.

==History==

The enterprise was established on September 18, 1914, in Detroit, Michigan, United States, by engineer Nathaniel B. Wales, who introduced his idea for a practical electric refrigeration unit for the home to Edmund Copeland and Arnold Goss.

Wales, a young inventor, secured financial backing from Arnold Goss, then secretary of the Buick Automobile company, to develop the first household mechanical refrigerators to be marketed under the name &quot;Electro-Automatic Refrigerating Company&quot;. After producing many experimental models, Wales selected one for manufacturing.

In February 1916, the name of the business was changed to &quot;Kelvinator Company&quot; in honor of the Irish-Scottish physicist, Lord Kelvin (William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin), the discoverer of absolute zero. Kelvinator was among two dozen home refrigerators introduced to the U.S. market in 1916. In 1918, Kelvinator introduced the first refrigerator with any type of automatic control.

Frustrated by iceboxes, the Grand Rapids Refrigerator Company introduced a porcelain-lined &quot;Leonard Cleanable&quot; ice cabinet. Kelvinator began buying Leonard&#x27;s boxes for its electric refrigerated models. By 1923, the Kelvinator Company held 80% of the American market for electric refrigerators.

On July 3, 1925, Kelvinator bought Nizer Corporation in a tri-party merger valued at $20 million.

In 1926, the company acquired Leonard, which had been founded in 1881. Kelvinator concentrated its entire appliance production at the Grand Rapids factory in 1928. That year, George W. Mason assumed control of Kelvinator. Under his leadership, the company lowered its costs while increasing market share through 1936.

In 1936, Kelvinator introduced the &quot;Kelvin Home&quot;, one of the earliest attempts to market in-home central air conditioning and heating to ordinary consumers. Customers could choose from several different home designs, all of which were equipped with climate control systems and the latest electric appliances, and were advertised to cost about $7,500 ($151,523 in 2022) for a six-room house. The first Kelvin Home shown to the public was located in Livonia, Michigan and attracted thousands of visitors. Several surviving homes are registered historic properties, including some in the Rosedale Gardens Historic District in Livonia and the Kelvinator House in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

==British operations==
In 1926, Kelvinator Limited, England, was started in London. From simple merchandising of the products of the American factories, it grew until it was producing much of its own equipment for the British market. In 1946, it was considered that the time was ripe for this unit to expand and be self-contained in its manufacture of Kelvinator Equipment, and the London manufacturing activities were moved to Crewe and greatly expanded with a further of floor space. The Crewe factory was shared with Rolls-Royce Motors, but burned down in the 1950s and was replaced by a new facility in Bromborough, Cheshire.

Italian manufacturer Candy bought the operation in 1979 together with the use of the Kelvinator brand name in the UK and produced both Candy and Kelvinator products until it closed around 2000.

==Merger with Nash Motors==
On October 27, 1936, it was announced that Nash Motors and Kelvinator Corp. were merging. The merger took effect on January 4, 1937, to form Nash-Kelvinator Corporation as part of a deal that placed George W. Mason at the helm of the combined company.

In 1952, it acquired the Altorfer Bros. Company, which made home laundry equipment under the ABC brand name.

==World War II==
Between 1939 and 1945, the complete manufacturing facilities of the factories&#x27; group were turned over to the manufacturing of military supplies. With the exception of one-ton, two-wheeled truck cargo trailers and some refrigerators, Nash-Kelvinator did not manufacture products related to its pre-war operations. It became the largest producer of helicopters in the U.S. during the war by making the A Hoverfly II, the most advanced helicopter design of the war. Other wartime products included three- and four-blade propellers, optical equipment and binoculars as well as Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial aircraft engines. The Kelvinator refrigerator facility in Grand Rapids, Michigan, had up to 5,000 employees when it produced airplane propellers and engine parts. Nash-Kelvinator placed 27th in the value of World War II production contracts that were awarded to U.S. firms.

In Britain, Kelvinator of London contributed to the field of testing airplane components at ultra-low temperatures, and instruments under high altitude conditions, research that was credited as saving the lives of many Allied aircrews.

The company pledged to introduce the scientific discoveries gained during the war production into its appliances to make them more useful and efficient.

==Integration into American Motors==
Nash-Kelvinator became a division of American Motors (AMC) when Nash merged with Hudson in 1954. Kelvinator introduced the first auto-defrost models. Kelvinator refrigerators included shelves on the inside of their doors and special compartments for frozen juice containers in the freezer. It also pioneered the side-by-side refrigerator freezer, the Foodarama series, in the mid-1950s. In the 1960s, Kelvinator refrigerators introduced &quot;picture frame&quot; doors on some models allowing owners to decorate their appliance to match décor of their kitchens.

Under the leadership of Roy D. Chapin Jr., AMC sold off its Kelvinator operations in 1968. (AMC then purchased the Jeep brand from Kaiser Industries in 1970.) Kelvinator joined White Consolidated Industries, a company that later acquired the rights to Frigidaire (originally owned by General Motors), Gibson, and White-Westinghouse product lines. Electrolux of Sweden acquired White Consolidated Industries in 1986, and combined WCI brands with Electrolux-owned Tappan to become WCI Major Appliances Group.

In the early 1990s, the name of the Dublin, Ohio based holding company changed to Frigidaire Company.

In 1997, it was reorganized into Electrolux North America Products.

==Legacy==
In North America, Electrolux continues to sell (under the Kelvinator Commercial brand) a range of commercial refrigeration equipment.

The Kelvinator brand is used in Argentina for a wide variety of appliances marketed by Radio Victoria Fueguina in Tierra del Fuego. The factory is in this province.

In the Philippines, the Kelvinator brand was licensed in 1977 to Concepcion Industries Inc. (now Concepcion Industrial Corporation) who continues to sell whitegoods under this brand.

In Australia, Kelvinator Australia Ltd was formed in 1934, and manufactured and distributed products under licence from several US companies, including Kelvinator. The managing director was William Queale, while his father-in-law, F.H. Griffiths, was a co-director. In 1980, they became part of the Australian-owned 
Email Limited group of companies, whose appliance division was subsequently sold to the Swedish-owned Electrolux Group in 2001. Refrigerators and air conditioners continue to be sold under the Kelvinator brand by the Electrolux Group.

In India, the Kelvinator brand was revived in 2019, when the retail arm of Reliance Retail signed a licensing, manufacturing, marketing and distribution deal with Electrolux. They currently sell a range of appliances and whitegoods under the Kelvinator brand.

As late as 2014, residents of Robeson County, North Carolina used &quot;Kelvinator&quot; to generically refer to refrigerators, due to the former presence of a Kelvinator factory in their county.

<doc id="1075344" wikidata="Q82240" url="?curid=1075344" title="Hiroshima Airport">
<text>is an international airport in the city of Mihara, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. Located east of Hiroshima, it is the largest airport in the Chugoku and Shikoku region, and the second busiest in the region after Matsuyama Airport. 80% of the airport&#x27;s domestic traffic is to and from Haneda Airport in Tokyo. In 2022, the Hiroshima-Haneda route was the tenth-busiest domestic air route in Japan.

==History==


The New Hiroshima Airport was opened for public use on 29 October 1993 as a replacement for the old Hiroshima Airport, which was renamed Hiroshima-Nishi Airport. The old airport was located in a more central waterfront location, but was too small to handle widebody aircraft and could not be expanded. In 1994, the New Hiroshima Airport was renamed to just Hiroshima Airport after the old airport was renamed.

The airport&#x27;s single runway opened with a length of 2,500 m (700 m longer than Hiroshima-Nishi). The runway was then extended to 3,000 m in 2001, and its ILS was upgraded to CAT-IIIa in 2008 and CAT-IIIb in 2009.

==Terminal==
The airport only has one terminal with separated departures and arrivals facilities for domestic and international flights and seven lettered gates (A through D domestic; E through G international). The international and domestic areas are separated landside by a central atrium. The domestic departures lounge has separate JAL and ANA airline lounges, while the international area has one shared airport lounge.

==Airlines and destinations==
==Statistics==

Source:

==Ground transportation==
===Road===
The airport has no direct expressway connection but is located near the San&#x27;yō Expressway. Limousine bus service to and from the downtown Hiroshima Bus Terminal is scheduled at 53 minutes but is often subject to traffic delays. Hiroshima Station is accessible by bus in 45 minutes. Bus service is also available to Shiraichi Station, Fukuyama Station, Kure Station and Mihara Station.

===Rail===
Unusually among major Japanese airports, Hiroshima Airport has no railway station. The closest station is Shiraichi Station on the San&#x27;yō Main Line, and planners have proposed connecting the airport to this station with a new line, or to build a new station on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen high-speed rail line. The West Japan Railway Company, which operates both lines, has rejected proposals for connections because of the high cost involved and to maintain JR&#x27;s competitiveness with commercial airlines for passenger traffic to and from Hiroshima.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 14 April 2015, Asiana Airlines Flight 162, operated by Airbus A320 HL-7762 departed the runway on landing. The aircraft was operating an international scheduled passenger flight from Incheon International Airport, Seoul, South Korea. At least 27 of the 81 people on board were injured (25 passengers and two crew members). Initial indications were that the aircraft had hit off the localizer antenna belonging to the airport&#x27;s Instrument landing system as it was coming in to land. The airport was closed through 16 April and reopened on 17 April with the ILS offline, resulting in flight cancellations during periods of adverse weather.

<text>Ubisoft Reflections Limited (formerly Reflections and later Reflections Interactive Limited) is a British video game developer and a studio of Ubisoft based in Newcastle upon Tyne. Founded in 1984 by Martin Edmondson and Nicholas Chamberlain, the studio focuses on racing games and it is best known for creating the award-winning &quot;Driver&quot; series. Reflections was acquired by GT Interactive in 1998 – which later turned into Atari Inc. – and sold to Ubisoft in 2006. The company worked in close cooperation with sister studio Ubisoft Leamington, until its closure in 2025.

== History ==
Martin Edmondson and Nicholas Chamberlain started developing games for the BBC Micro under the moniker &quot;Reflections&quot; in 1984. Their first game was a &quot;Paperboy&quot; clone called &quot;Paper-Round&quot; that took two years to develop but was never released. While working on that game, they started &quot;Ravenskull&quot; which would be their first published game, released in 1986 by Superior Software. This was followed by &quot;Codename: Droid&quot; and an Acorn Electron conversion of &quot;Stryker&#x27;s Run&quot; in 1987.

The name Reflections was first used for their 1989 hit Amiga game, &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot;, published by Psygnosis which spawned two sequels. The original Amiga game was partially written by Paul Howarth, and started out life as a parallax test of the blitter of the Amiga&#x27;s Agnus chip; Paul later went on to work for Deep Red Games, a UK video game company based in Milton Keynes. A number of other Amiga and Atari ST games followed including &quot;Ballistix&quot; (1989), &quot;Awesome&quot; (1990) and &quot;Brian the Lion&quot; (1994). In 1995, they became known for &quot;Destruction Derby&quot;, which was critically acclaimed for its realistic physics and destruction, which later become Reflections&#x27; specialty. Due to the success, the game had four more sequels over the years.

On 9 January 1999, it was announced that Reflections had been acquired by GT Interactive in 1998, for a reported 2.7 million shares of common stock, which was valued at around . Reflections became well known for the game &quot;Driver&quot;, which was inspired by &#x27;70s cop shows like &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; and movies like &quot;Bullitt&quot; and &quot;The Driver&quot;. It has been followed by four sequels and four spin-offs. The company was subsequently renamed Reflections Interactive.

In 2004, studio founder Martin Edmondson left Reflections after the concepting stage of &quot;&quot;, and sued Atari due to &quot;constructive unfair dismissal as a result of Reflections alleged repudiatory breach of a contract of employment that necessitated Mr. Edmondson&#x27;s resignation.&quot; Martin&#x27;s brother, Gareth Edmondson, took his place as the studio manager. In July 2006, Atari announced that it had transferred all of the staff and most of the assets of Reflections Interactive Limited, including the intellectual property and technology rights to the &quot;Driver&quot; series, to Ubisoft for .

Gareth Edmondson, studio manager, left Reflections after more than a ten-year presence at the studio in November 2011, two months after the launch of &quot;&quot;. The studio was then headed by Pauline Jacquey from February 2014. The studio was then headed by Richard Blenkinsop until they left the company in 2021. Lisa Opie was appointed as managing director in May 2021.

In May 2013, Ubisoft Reflections announced that they are working on a new game, Ubisoft planned to announce the game at E3 2013. On 10 June 2013, during an Ubisoft&#x27;s press conference it was revealed that Reflections was working with developer Ivory Tower on the racing game &quot;The Crew&quot;, which was later released in December 2014.

<text>Peter Colin Hodgson (born 13 June 1950) is a former New Zealand politician of the Labour Party and Member of Parliament for Dunedin North from 1990 to 2011.

==Early life==
Hodgson was born in Whangārei, and received a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in veterinary science from Massey University. He has worked as a veterinarian, a high school teacher, and a fruit and vegetable retailer.

==Member of Parliament==



Hodgson joined the Labour Party in 1976, and shortly afterwards became the manager for Stan Rodger&#x27;s successful campaign in the Dunedin North seat. After holding a number of other Labour Party roles, including that of marginal seats organiser, he was himself nominated to replace Rodger in the 1990 election. He was successful, and became the MP for Dunedin North.

In November 1990 he was appointed as Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for Science &amp; Technology and Planning by Labour leader Mike Moore.

When the Labour Party formed a government after the 1999 election, Hodgson was appointed to Cabinet. During Labour&#x27;s nine years in power, Hodgson&#x27;s portfolios included Economic Development; Tertiary Education; Research, Science and Technology; Health; Transport; Commerce; Land Information; Statistics; Energy (1999–2004); and Fisheries and Forestry. He was also Associate Minister of Health; Industry and Regional Development; and Foreign Affairs.

In 2001, during the filming of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movie trilogy in New Zealand, Hodgson was given the title Minister of the Rings, responsible for investigating methods of capitalising on the boom in tourism to New Zealand that followed the release of the films.

In May 2007, Hodgson briefed the Welsh Labour Party&#x27;s executive on the practicalities of co-operation between Welsh parties outside a formal coalition, after the 2007 Welsh Assembly elections led to a Labour minority government looking likely.

Labour was defeated in the 2008 general election. Hodgson retained his seat with a majority of 7,155.

In opposition, Hodgson was Labour&#x27;s &quot;chief dirt-digger and mudslinger&quot;. The scandals he exposed caused two government ministers to resign.

Hodgson retired from politics at the end of the 49th Parliament in 2011, after 21 years as the MP for Dunedin North. He was succeeded by Labour&#x27;s David Clark.

==Life after Parliament==
In 2013, Hodgson was appointed a member of the Representation Commission to determine New Zealand electoral boundaries.

<doc id="1075360" wikidata="Q7139852" url="?curid=1075360" title="Parrotlet">
<text>Parrotlets are a group of the smallest New World parrot species, comprising several genera, namely &quot;Forpus&quot;, &quot;Nannopsittaca&quot;, and &quot;Touit&quot;. They have stocky builds and short tails and are endemic to Middle and South America. They resemble the lovebirds of Africa in size, body shape and behaviour and have sometimes been referred to as &quot;South American lovebirds&quot;, but are not closely related.

In the wild, parrotlets travel in flocks ranging in size from about four to over a hundred birds. Most species travel in flocks of about five to forty. They form lifelong, tight pair bonds with their chosen mates.

==Behavior==
If left alone for too long, a single parrotlet can lose some of its companionability. The Pacific parrotlet, in particular, does not understand that it is a tiny bird, and has little trouble challenging other animals and humans. Parrotlets in general are feisty, affectionate, and willful. Parrotlets should be housed separately due to their aggressive nature. Even bonded pairs have been known to kill or injure a mate. For this reason, most parrotlet species should not be kept in aviaries and it is best to keep them separate from other species.

==Parrotlet species==
The following species within three genera are considered to be parrotlets:

===&quot;Forpus&quot;===
* Mexican parrotlet (&quot;Forpus cyanopygius&quot;)
* Green-rumped parrotlet (&quot;Forpus passerinus&quot;)
* Cobalt-rumped parrotlet (&quot;Forpus xanthopterygius&quot;)
* Turquoise-winged parrotlet (&quot;Forpus spengeli&quot;)
* Riparian parrotlet (&quot;Forpus crassirostris&quot;)
* Spectacled parrotlet (&quot;Forpus conspicillatus&quot;)
* Dusky-billed parrotlet or Sclater&#x27;s parrotlet (&quot;Forpus modestus&quot;)
* Pacific parrotlet or celestial parrotlet (&quot;Forpus coelestis&quot;)
* Yellow-faced parrotlet (&quot;Forpus xanthops&quot;)

===&quot;Touit&quot;===
The &quot;Touit&quot; parrotlets are a genus of parrotlets found in the Venezuela-Guyana area, the northern Andes, and Bahia. Only three of the seven species have ever been brought into aviculture, none successfully.
* Lilac-tailed parrotlet (&quot;Touit batavicus&quot;)
* Scarlet-shouldered parrotlet (&quot;Touit huetii&quot;)
* Red-fronted parrotlet (&quot;Touit costaricensis&quot; - sometimes included in &quot;T. dilectissimus&quot;)
* Blue-fronted parrotlet or red-winged parrotlet (&quot;Touit dilectissimus&quot;)
* Sapphire-rumped parrotlet (&quot;Touit purpuratus&quot;)
* Brown-backed parrotlet (&quot;Touit melanonotus&quot;)
* Golden-tailed parrotlet (&quot;Touit surdus&quot;)
* Spot-winged parrotlet (&quot;Touit stictopterus&quot;)

===&quot;Nannopsittaca&quot;===
There are only two species in the genus &quot;Nannopsittaca&quot;.
* Tepui parrotlet (&quot;Nannopsittaca panychlora&quot;)
* Manu parrotlet or Amazonian parrotlet (&quot;Nannopsittaca dachilleae&quot;)

<text>Big Jim was a line of action figure toys produced from 1972 through 1986 by Mattel for the North American and European markets. He was renamed [[Kid Acero]] in Latin America and, for a short period of time, Mark Strong in Europe. Originally inspired by G.I. Joe, the Big Jim line was smaller in size (closer to 10 inches in height compared to Joe&#x27;s 12) and each figure included a push button in the back that made the character execute a karate chop action. The action figure&#x27;s arms were made of a soft plastic/vinyl material and contained a mechanism that simulated the bulge of a biceps when the elbow was bent. Big Jim was less military-oriented than the G.I. Joe line, having more of a secret agent motif, but also had a large variety of outfits and situations available including sports, space exploration, martial arts, hunting, western, camping, fishing, and photography.

==Basic characters==
Characters are sorted in the year in which they made their first appearance. Note that most of them were produced for several years after their initial release.

=== Original Mark Strong the Man from Mattel (1972) ===
* Mark Strong – Big Jim&#x27;s conceptual source – The basic figure was dressed in orange shorts with white stripes and came with a karate board, dumbbell and test of strength belt. He was only released in Europe.

===Original Big Jim Basic series (1972)===
* Big Jim – the basic good guy leader of the P.A.C.K. He was an average Caucasian male with few distinguishable characteristics, except having a permanent good attitude and joy for life.
* Big Jack – One of the first African American characters with friendly attitude that made it into toys without racial stereotypes.
* Big Josh – Effectively Big Jim with a beard. He is one of Jim&#x27;s best friends, and was positioned as the tough guy among the group.
* Big Jeff – Big Jim&#x27;s third buddy. An Australian blond, who was also Jim&#x27;s opponent in the Olympic boxing match set, even though both Jim and Jeff are on the American team.
* Dr. Steel – He came with a steel right hand and an iron pipe, and a large dragon tattoo on his chest. Originally a villain, he later appeared as a member of the P.A.C.K. However, in some countries he remained a villain.
* Chief Tankua – Jim&#x27;s Native American friend. He came with bow and arrow, and was the first character to wear the wolf tattoo which became the P.A.C.K. logo.

===P.A.C.K. series (1976)===
* Warpath – Exactly the same figure as Tankua, but with a different name.
* The Whip – A master of all weapons. He came with boomerangs, bo staff, bola and whip, from which he takes his codename. The Whip is one of the few Big Jim characters known by an alias instead of his real name.
* Torpedo Fist – Probably the strangest of all members of the P.A.C.K., he was the only one who had superpowers. While all other members of the group were normal humans, Torpedo has a telescopic cybernetic arm.
* Zorak – A scientist who performed several genetic experiments on his own body, until he became a menace. He was the villain in the P.A.C.K. series.

===Spy series (1982)===
* Agent 004 – Big Jim, with a new secret identity.
* Joe – A professional alpinist who helps agent 004.
* Professor O.B.B. – An Asian gentlemen with refined moods and a dangerous profession. His character was partially based on James Bond&#x27;s Doctor No.
* Boris – He was inspired by Oddjob from &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. He has a steel cap on his skull and a fist which could extend from his wrist with a cable.

===Global Command series (1985)===
* Commander Jim – Big Jim, this time as the leader of an adventure team, similar to the original P.A.C.K., but oriented to spy and space adventures.
* Astros – Described as a loyal friend of Jim. He was initially dressed as an astronaut.
* Dr. Alec – A member of Global Command specializing in jungle and desert missions.
* Baron Fangg – A longtime enemy and rival of Doctor Alec. He was equipped with a &quot;mimetic armor&quot; which allowed him to mimic the area around him like a chameleon.
* Vektor – A cosmonaut specializing in supersonic aircraft, he was intended to be Astros&#x27;s rival.

==The Original Edition==
First Editions – Originally, Big Jim action figures came out in a small blue box with red and white stripes. The 1972 toy line was split into three sub lines: the Basic Line, the Adventure Line and the Sports Line. Simultaneously, Mattel released an almost identical figure named Mark Strong, The Man from Mattel© in Europe. The Mark Strong figure was nearly identical to Big Jim and came with the same accessories. The crotch piece of the Mark Strong figure was thinner and more fragile than that of Big Jim.

The basic line was composed mostly of figures which came almost naked, with minimal clothes or accessories. The original basic Big Jim came dressed in orange shorts with white stripes and included a karate board, a dumbbell and test of strength belt. Jack was an identical, figure, with only a different head. He was one of the first toys produced in the United States to represent a minority character in a respectful way.

The Basic line also included the first incarnations of Josh and Jeff. Jeff is an Aussie type figure dressed with shorts and brown hat that came with a chopping knife, a chest belt and a bamboo stand. Josh is a bearded woodsman figure fully dressed in denim vest and shorts with brown boots. He was the only one which came with vest and shoes.

All four basic figures had a mechanism that simulated the bulge of a biceps when the arm was bent.

The adventure series was composed mostly of camping and explorer vehicles, and these were the first playsets in the toyline. Three animals were released with this first wave: a gorilla, a rhino and a crocodile.

The sports line was composed of different versions of Big Jim. He was a baseball player, a hockey player, a pugilist, and an eagle ranger. The eagle which came with this set was also included with several later versions of Big Jim.

The first wave of Big Jim also included a figure dressed as a nuclear plant worker, which had no relation to any other figures in the line.

==P.A.C.K. Series==
In 1975, Mattel decided to create an extension of the main toy line making Big Jim the leader of a -like group of heroes for hire. This series is easy to identify because all related products have a howling wolf as its principal image and character art by Jack Kirby. The members of the spy group were named P.A.C.K., which is an acronym derived from &quot;Professional Agents – Crime Killers&quot;.

On its initial release, the series presented Jim as &quot;Commander&quot;, this time as the leader of a counter intelligence strike team. He and two of his most loyal friends joins forces to against a hooded villain known as &quot;Zorak, the ruler of the Underworld&quot;.

The first Zorak action figure was named Double Trouble Zorak, because he had a face-changing feature where his normal-looking head could be turned into a monstrous green visage.

Two Big Jim action figures were relaunched to join forces against Zorak. One of them was Warpath (a Native American archer) who was previously released as Tankua. Seems like the main reason for the name change was the difficulty in pronouncing &quot;Tankua&quot; properly, and the need for a more dynamic name. Dr. Steel returned too, but this time as a hero and member of the P.A.C.K. A new character was added to the group, The Whip, a weapons specialist armed with a bullwhip. One year later, a new character named Torpedo Fist, (a former sailor with an artificial hand and forearm) was added to the team. In Latin America several parts of this figure in particular were split to create new Big Jim characters not released in the United States, as part of the region&#x27;s version of P.A.C.K., named LOBO Squadron.

Much in the same way that the earlier &quot;Big Josh&quot; figure used the same head sculpt as Big Jim, The Whip used the same head as Big Jeff, only with Black hair (Big Jeff was blond) and (not unlike Big Josh) a painted on beard.
* Warpath / with wolfpack tattoo on left hand / Indian Figure / dressed in denim pants – leather vest – black top hat – brown boots – wolfpack belt / silver bow with wolfpack logo and 3 silver arrows with the wolfpack logo on top / brown chest belt for the arrows

==Pirate Series==
In 1978, Mattel launched a pirate themed series exclusively in Europe. The series initially consisted of repaints and retooled figures, but eventually included some figures exclusive to the region.

* Captain Drake – An evil hooded pirate. He had a face-changing feature like Zorak and could change his face to a skull.
* Captain Hook
* Captain Flint/Sandokan

== Space Series ==
* Big Jim Space Leader
* Big Jim Laser Gunner
* Captain Laser - The figure was similar to the Captain Lazer made by Mattel in the Major Matt Mason line.
* Dr. Bushido – A villain who wields a glow-in-the-dark katana. Was exactly the same doll as Professor Obb.

* Big Jim Talking
* Commando Jeff
* Alpinist Joe

* Iron Jaw – A villain for the Italian spy series: with a metal lower jaw and a prosthetic arm ending in a hook which could be changed with other extensions that were stored in his green briefcase. This figure was never released, but appeared in catalogues and ads only.

== Global Command vs. Condor Force ==
The last Big Jim sci-fi themed series appeared in the 1980s and was only distributed in Europe. There were eight characters, four &quot;good&quot; and four &quot;evil&quot;, divided into two opposing camps: &quot;Global Command&quot; and &quot;Condor Force&quot;, respectively. The leaders of both groups were redesigned: new heads were sculpted for the Big Jim and Professor Obb figures.

==Kid Acero==
Most Big Jim toys from the early 1970s from the adventure and sport series were sold as &quot;Kid Acero&quot; (Kid Steel) in Latin America. All toys are exactly the same as in the American versions and were produced by a local Mattel subsidiary with only the name being changed. The Kid Acero toy line also included several figures which were exclusively created for the Mexican market, such as The Invisible Man, The Bionic Man, Garfio, and Nocton&#x27; and retooled and repainted versions of several Big Jim toys not available in the United States or Europe.

==Karl May&#x27;s Winnetou and Old Shatterhand==
A series based on the Wild West characters of the popular German writer Karl May (1842–1912) and especially the 1960s series of Karl May movies was available in the late 1970s, including &quot;Old Shatterhand&quot; and &quot;Winnetou, Chief of the Apache&quot;. In addition to May&#x27;s creations &quot;Old Firehand&quot; and &quot;Old Surehand&quot;, the character of &quot;Bloody Fox&quot; was invented for the toyline. With &quot;Nscho-Tschi&quot;, Winnetou&#x27;s sister, a unique female character was introduced to the series. Mattel released six dolls in the Karl May line; they came in large green display boxes with the Karl May logo on the box.
The lineup was as follows:

In other countries this series was renamed and distributed as part of the official Big Jim line. In Italy it appeared as &quot;Gli amici del West di Big Jim&quot; (&quot;Big Jim&#x27;s Friends of the West&quot;), and in Spain it was made by Congost as &quot;Oeste&quot; (&quot;West&quot;). Most of the characters were also renamed for these releases.
* Winnetou was renamed Geronimo in both countries
* Old Shatterhand was renamed Dakota Joe
* Old Surehand became Buffalo Bill in Italy only
* Old Firehand became Old Kentuck in Italy and Kid Buffalo in Spain
* Bloody Fox became Bisonte Nero in Italy and Bisonte Negro in Spain

Furthermore, the Warpath character, known as Chief Tankua, was added to the West series in Italy.

==James Bond, Agent 007==
Most of the Big Jim toys from the early 1980s were sold as &quot;James Bond&quot; toys in Latin America. The American Spy and Space series were renamed &quot;James Bond, secret agent 007&quot;. All toys are exactly the same as in the American and European versions and were produced by a local Mattel subsidiary. Only the brand on the packages is different.

==Other media==
* Big Jim makes several cameo appearances on the toyline &quot;Max Steel as &quot;Jim McGrath&quot; the TV series&quot; episode 12 &quot;Scions&quot; is entirely dedicated to his memory.
* Big Jim was parodied in the 3rd season &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;Endless Breadsticks&quot; with Big Jim voiced by Patrick Warburton and Zorak voiced by Donald Faison.
* In &quot;Dog Man&quot;, a resident in Cat Jail is named after Big Jim.

<doc id="1075376" wikidata="Q797794" url="?curid=1075376" title="Elihu Club">
<text>Elihu Club or Elihu is the fourth oldest senior society at Yale University, New Haven, CT. It was founded in 1903 and takes its name from Elihu Yale.

==History ==
The Elihu Club was founded by eleven students in 1903 as an &quot;open senior society&quot;, rather than a secret society. At the time, this was considered in &quot;variance with accepted traditions&quot; at Yale and &quot;an interesting democratic innovation&quot;. its name from Elihu Yale who was the primary benefactor of Yale College. Its purpose is: &quot;To foster among its members, by earnest work and good fellowship a stronger affection for Yale; a broader view of undergraduate life and its aims; a deeper and more helpful friendship for one another; and to give its members, after graduation, an additional tie to bind them to Yale and each other.&quot;

The Elihu Club of New Haven incorporated with the State of Connecticut in June 1903. The first delegation of tapped members was from the class of 1904 and included:

In October 1903, Elihu Club added six additional members from the class of 1904, including seniors Coleman Curtis, Everett Dominick, Harry L. Foote, Joseph H. Holmes, Lawrence Mason, and Robert L. Smitley. For the 1904 to 1905 academic year, the club rented the home of Mrs. Francis G. Beach on Wall Street.

In 1911, the club purchased a colonial-era house which looks out on the New Haven Green. It is considered a landed society because it owns a building on campus. Like the other societies, the organization&#x27;s building is typically closed to non-members. 

While similar to Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key and Wolf&#x27;s Head societies in charter and function, Elihu favors privacy over secrecy and is considered a &quot;left-wing&quot; society. Because it allows all members of the junior class to interview for membership, the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; notes that, &quot;Elihu is considered to be less prestigious.&quot; However, in May 1912, three men turned down invitations to secret societies in favor of Elihu Club, including baseball player Harold Carhart, football player Elmer McDevitt, and Edward Stevens. In the spring of 1913, the sophomore class at Yale held a protest against secret societies; Elihu denied suspicions that it started the student protest.

Elihu&#x27;s normal meetings are held each Thursday and Sunday of the academic year. Its activities are similar to that of the other landed senior secret societies: personal histories or biographies and perspectives are shared among the current delegates. Its programs also include topical essays on pertinent issues, personal bonding time, and group reflection activities.

By 1982, Elihu gained a reputation for admitting racial minorities. In May 1982, the fifteen members of Elihu refused to tap any new members because of a dispute with the alumni who wanted to start charging new members $350. Elihu Club began admitting women in 1971.

Starting in 2002, the club hosts the annual Elihu Yale Lecture which features notable speakers. Architect, planner, and Elihu members Alexander Garvin presented the first lecture in 2002. The 2005 lecture was delivered by actor Sam Waterston, also an Elihu member.

== Symbols ==

== Club house ==

Elihu Club is housed in a three-story white clapboard house built between 1762 and 1776 at 175 Elm Street. This house is the oldest of all of Yale&#x27;s secret society buildings, and purportedly one of the oldest original structures in the United States still in regular use. Its brick basement is older still, constructed in the early 17th century, and later frequented by colonists sympathetic to the English cause when it became known as the Tory Tavern, a central locale of the Revolutionary War. In 1781, the town of New Haven confiscated the building from its Loyalist owner, Nicholas Callahan, for his activities.

The club expanded the Federal style building to the rear several times and now includes . The building is among the largest of the societies, belying the modest clapboard facade. It contains two single guest rooms in addition to beds for all the current undergraduate members, as well as a large formal meeting room, a library, a formal dining room, and an informal &#x27;tap room&#x27; in the basement. The club also has a section of the old Yale Fence in its basement, a relic from the famous structure removed in 1888.

The building has windows, though they are blinded. 

== Membership ==
Originally, Elihu had no limit on the number of members that could be tapped in a given year; its only rule was that these men not be a member of the other secret societies: Scroll and Key, Skull and Bones, and Wolf&#x27;s Head. As a result, Elihu waited to invite its new members after Tap Day for the other societies. However, its founders estimated that between ten and twenty students would be tapped each year, along with worthy Yale graduates from the past twenty or thirty years. In May 1920, the club changed its recruitment policy and participated in Tap Day with the secret societies.

Starting as an all-male organization, Elihu now also has female members. Annually, sixteen rising seniors are elected into the membership of Elihu during the spring tap process. Selection is performed behind closed doors, in keeping with the other major societies. The society invites all members of the junior class to participate in its interview process. However, consideration for membership in Elihu is given to those juniors in the college who are nominated by undergraduate and alumni members. 

From its earliest days, the Elihu Club has favored members who leaned toward literary pursuits, acting, teaching, and the law. Elihu Society&#x27;s taps among the Yale class of 1914, for instance, included Rufus King, president of the Yale Dramatic Association, and Newbold Noyes Jr., chairman of the &quot;Yale Literary Magazine&quot;.

For some, Elihu was appealing because it was different from Yale&#x27;s secret societies. Joseph Lieberman was courted by Skull and Bones, even though he wrote editorials critical of the society in the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;. Lieberman wrote, &quot;Heresy of all heresies, it would be wonderful if, as a symbolic gesture, the societies someday put windows in their buildings. No other institution seems to separate the haves from the have-nots so forcefully in the eyes of students.&quot; Lieberman rejected Bones in favor of Elihu, whose building had windows. Jacob Weisberg, was offered membership in Skull and Bones by Senator John Kerry. Weisberg declined, citing Bones&#x27; exclusion of women. Weisberg was persuaded by Robert G. Kaiser to join Elihu instead.

==Popular culture==

* The sharing of personal stories became a plot device in a movie directed by Elihu member Alan Hruska (1955), who jettisoned a career as a trial lawyer to become a film director. Hruska&#x27;s 2009 film &quot;Reunion&quot; explored a mythical reunion of fellow society members some 23 years after graduation, and was loosely inspired by a gathering of his Elihu delegation.
* Campus tradition maintains that Elihu has the original papers of the author James Fenimore Cooper, even drafts of his epic novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s great-grandson James Fenimore Cooper Jr. (1892–1918) was a member of Elihu&#x27;s 1913 delegation.
* In a March 2000 essay on Yale&#x27;s societies, Jacques Leslie recalled learning he would be tapped for Skull and Bones. &quot;I was leaning towards Elihu, the sole above-ground society that was headquartered in an actual frame house with windows.&quot; When the Bonesmen arrived to tap Leslie, he shouted &quot;Reject!&quot; The surprised expression on the Bonesman&#x27;s face was printed on the following day&#x27;s second front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; with the caption &quot;Skull was first but he chose Elihu.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, the Vitali–Hahn–Saks theorem, introduced by , , and , proves that under some conditions a sequence of measures converging point-wise does so uniformly and the limit is also a measure.

==Statement of the theorem==

If formula_1 is a measure space with formula_2 and a sequence formula_3 of complex measures. Assuming that each formula_3 is absolutely continuous with respect to formula_5 and that a for all formula_6 the finite limits exist formula_7 Then the absolute continuity of the formula_3 with respect to formula_9 is uniform in formula_10 that is, formula_11 implies that formula_12 uniformly in formula_13 Also formula_14 is countably additive on formula_15

==Preliminaries==

Given a measure space formula_16 a distance can be constructed on formula_17 the set of measurable sets formula_6 with formula_19 This is done by defining 
:formula_20 where formula_21 is the symmetric difference of the sets formula_22
This gives rise to a metric space formula_23 by identifying two sets formula_24 when formula_25 Thus a point formula_26 with representative formula_27 is the set of all formula_28 such that formula_29

Proposition: formula_23 with the metric defined above is a complete metric space.

&quot;Proof:&quot; Let 
formula_31
Then
formula_32
This means that the metric space formula_23 can be identified with a subset of the Banach space formula_34.

Let formula_35, with
formula_36
Then we can choose a sub-sequence formula_37 such that formula_38 exists almost everywhere and formula_39. It follows that formula_40 for some formula_41 (furthermore formula_42 if and only if formula_43 for formula_44 large enough, then we have that formula_45 the limit inferior of the sequence) and hence formula_46 Therefore, formula_23 is complete.

==Proof of Vitali-Hahn-Saks theorem==

Each formula_3 defines a function formula_49 on formula_50 by taking formula_51. This function is well defined, this is it is independent on the representative formula_52 of the class formula_53 due to the absolute continuity of formula_3 with respect to formula_9. Moreover formula_56 is continuous. 

For every formula_57 the set
formula_58
is closed in formula_50, and by the hypothesis formula_60 we have that 
formula_61
By Baire category theorem at least one formula_62 must contain a non-empty open set of formula_50. This means that there is formula_64 and a formula_65 such that 
formula_66 implies formula_67
On the other hand, any formula_6 with formula_69 can be represented as formula_70 with formula_71 and formula_72. This can be done, for example by taking formula_73 and formula_74. Thus, if formula_69 and formula_76 then
formula_77
Therefore, by the absolute continuity of formula_78 with respect to formula_9, and since formula_80 is arbitrary, we get that formula_81 implies formula_82 uniformly in formula_13 In particular, formula_84 implies formula_85 

By the additivity of the limit it follows that formula_14 is finitely-additive. Then, since formula_87 it follows that formula_14 is actually countably additive.

<text>Colin Farrell Camerer (born December 4, 1959) is an American behavioral economist, and Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Finance and Economics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

==Background==
A former child prodigy, Camerer received a B.A. in quantitative studies from Johns Hopkins University in 1976 (at age 16), followed by an M.B.A. in finance from the University of Chicago in 1979 and a Ph.D. in behavioral decision theory from that same institution in 1981 (at age 21) for thesis titled &quot;The Validity and Utility of Expert Judgment&quot; under the supervision of Hillel Einhorn and Robin Hogarth. Camerer worked at Kellogg, Wharton, and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business before moving to Caltech in 1994.

Camerer&#x27;s research is on the interface between cognitive psychology and economics. This work seeks a better understanding of the psychological and neurobiological basis of decision-making in order to determine the validity of models of human economic behavior. His research uses mostly economics experiments—and occasionally field studies—to understand how people behave when making decisions (e.g., risky gambles for money), in games, and in markets (e.g., speculative price bubbles).

He spoke at the Econometric Society World Congress in London on August 20, 2005 and at the Nobel Centennial Symposium in 2001 on Behavioral and Experimental Economics.

He is the author of &quot;Behavioral Game Theory&quot; published by Princeton University Press in 2003.

During the late 1990s and until mid-2008, Camerer began instructing college courses in fields such as Cognitive Psychology, Microeconomic Theory, Behavioral Economics, and Organizational Design. These courses were held at a variety of different universities, including the aforementioned California Institute of Technology and additionally New York University.

In September 2013, Camerer was named a MacArthur fellow.

==Fever Records==
In 1983, Camerer started a record label called &quot;Fever Records&quot; as &quot;an economics experiment&quot;. Bands that he signed to the label include the Dead Milkmen, Big Black and Get Smart!. The label was part of the Enigma Records group of labels.

Another Fever Records was founded in the 1980s in New York City to distribute rap records, and has no connection.

<text>John Silva Meehan (February 6, 1790 – April 24, 1863) was an American publisher, printer, and newspaper editor. He served as the librarian of Congress from 1829 to 1861.

Born in New York City, Meehan worked as a printer in his youth. He briefly served in the U.S. Navy during the last few months of the War of 1812. He returned without seeing combat and began work as a publisher in Philadelphia alongside fellow printer Robert Anderson, publishing a Baptist religious journal. After the firm moved to Washington, D.C., in early 1822, Meehan began editing and publishing the Baptist weekly newspaper &quot;The Columbian Star&quot;. Leaving the &quot;Star&quot; in late 1825, Meehan nominally purchased the &quot;City of Washington Gazette&quot; on direction from Andrew Jackson&#x27;s presidential campaign, renaming the paper the &quot;United States&#x27; Telegraph&quot; and taking an immensely partisan stance. Jackson supporters considered Meehan unable to properly spearhead the press campaign. Control over the paper gradually shifted towards editor and publisher Duff Green, with Meehan officially leaving the paper in October 1826; however, he continued to serve as Green&#x27;s editorial assistant until 1829.

Following a purge of numerous incumbent officials in the aftermath of Jackson&#x27;s 1828 election, Meehan was appointed as librarian of Congress via the spoils system and with Green&#x27;s urging, replacing the staunch anti-Jacksonian George Watterston. Meehan&#x27;s tenure as librarian saw the steady growth of the Library of Congress, collaborating with longstanding Joint Committee on the Library chair James Pearce for most of his tenure. A large fire in December 1851 destroyed 35,000 of the library&#x27;s 55,000 books. Meehan and Pearce oversaw the reconstruction of the library after the disaster, restocking it with substantial purchases of books and rebuilding the main hall. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted Meehan&#x27;s removal in 1861 in favor of Indiana physician John Gould Stephenson. Largely unbothered by this, he retired gracefully and died suddenly in 1863. Both Stephenson and later historians were generally critical of Meehan&#x27;s tenure, noting that he mainly deferred to the Joint Committee on library policy, leaving the library&#x27;s archaic catalog system unchanged, and failing to make any progress in transforming the institution into a true national library.

== Early life ==
John Silva Meehan was born in New York City on February 6, 1790. Little is recorded of his early life. He attended school in New York and later entered work as a printer. In 1811 or 1812, he moved to Burlington, New Jersey, to work as a printer at Lexicon Press under publisher David Allinson. There, Meehan helped print Richard S. Coxe&#x27;s &quot;New Critical Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language&quot;. He met Margaret Jones Monington, from Burlington, and married her in 1814.

In January 1815, Meehan returned to New York to enlist in the Navy. He served as a midshipman on the USS &quot;Firefly&quot; during the War of 1812. The &quot;Firefly&quot; was the flagship of a small group of commerce raiders in the West Indies. Shortly afterwards, the ratification of the Treaty of Ghent concluded the war. The &quot;Firefly&quot; did not see action, to the disappointment of Meehan and the rest of the crew. Leaving service in April 1815, he moved to Philadelphia and declined an offered commission in the Marine Corps to focus on his printing career. His first daughter, Susan, was born the same month.

== Publishing career ==
In Philadelphia, Meehan partnered with fellow printer Robert Anderson to create the Anderson &amp; Meehan firm. They began publishing the &quot;Latter Day Luminary&quot; in 1818, a Baptist General Conference-sponsored religious journal published five times a year. The firm moved to Washington, D.C., in early 1822, and the &quot;Luminary&quot; was shifted to a monthly publication. In February 1822, soon after moving to Washington, Anderson &amp; Meehan also began publishing &quot;The Columbian Star&quot;, self-described as an apolitical Baptist weekly newspaper. The two served as the chief editors of the paper for about a year, before editorship was transferred to Reverend James D. Knowles. Alongside the two regular publications, the firm would occasionally publish other items, such as pamphlets. Anderson left the &quot;Star&quot; in early 1823 and the &quot;Luminary&quot; by the end of that year, leaving Meehan as the sole publisher. Knowles left the &quot;Star&quot; in July 1825, making Meehan the editor of the paper. Six months later Meehan left the paper, seeking not to associate the largely apolitical &quot;Star&quot; with his entry into political writing. He transferred publication and editorship of the &quot;Star&quot; to Baron Stow and discontinued the &quot;Luminary&quot;.

=== &quot;United States&#x27; Telegraph&quot; ===
Following his narrow loss in a House contingent election after the 1824 presidential election, Tennessee senator Andrew Jackson and his former running mate John C. Calhoun sought a supportive newspaper in Washington, D.C. The Jackson campaign indirectly purchased Jonathan Elliot&#x27;s &quot;City of Washington Gazette&quot; through allies William B. Lewis and John Eaton. Although Meehan ostensibly purchased the paper, Eaton likely directed the purchase. Meehan served as the first publisher and chief editor of the paper, which was renamed the &quot;United States&#x27; Telegraph&quot;. The newspaper entered publication on February 6, 1826. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; was published in weekly, thrice-weekly, and daily editions, available by subscription. From the outset, the paper was immensely partisan, strongly opposed to the election of President John Quincy Adams and the appointment of Secretary of State Henry Clay. It declared that these violated &quot;the most sacred principles of the Constitution&quot; due to the contingent election and adopted the motto &quot;Power is always stealing from the many to the few.&quot;

As editor, Meehan heavily criticized the system of executive patronage (also known as the spoils system). He attacked the appointment of an anti-Jacksonian postmaster in Jackson&#x27;s hometown of Nashville, claiming the appointment was solely made to &quot;mortify&quot; Jackson. Meehan also emphasized defending Jackson&#x27;s reputation, describing him as an &quot;abused citizen&quot; and claiming that Jackson was above the political games and corruption that he attributed to the Adams administration. National Republican-aligned newspapers began to oppose the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, with &quot;The National Intelligencer&quot; and &quot;National Journal&quot; claiming Meehan&#x27;s editorials amounted to &quot;indiscriminate opposition&quot;.

Soon after he acquired the paper, Jacksonians began to worry that Meehan lacked the ferocity and boldness needed to support the campaign. Although Meehan was recognized for his strong anti-Adams advocacy through the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, the ownership of the paper grew uncomfortable with his perceived inability to mount an effective response against the administration. The lack of transparency around the formation of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; invited allegations of conspiracy. The &quot;Richmond Whig&quot; described the paper as &quot;edited by nobody knows whom, supported, nobody knows how&quot;.

Missouri editor and politician Duff Green was summoned to Washington by prominent Jacksonians to take over the &quot;Telegraph&quot;. He published several editorials in the paper and offered to purchase it after strong rebuttals from the &quot;National Journal&quot;. Green borrowed large amounts of money from Jacksonian politicians, including Eaton, to finance this purchase. An official deal between Meehan and Green was reached on June 5, 1826, purchasing the paper and its printing office. Meehan was hired as Green&#x27;s assistant for a three-year term. Green soon left to travel the country, and Meehan continued serving as the &quot;de facto&quot; chief editor of the paper for several months. During this period, Meehan clashed with the pro-administration press on several issues, including Adams&#x27; alleged purchase of a billiards table and the military significance of Jackson&#x27;s victory in the Battle of New Orleans.

The last issue of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; featuring Meehan&#x27;s name was published on October 17, 1826. No official statement was made regarding the change of ownership. While working as Green&#x27;s publisher, Meehan additionally served as the secretary of the board of trustees of the Baptist Columbian College.

== Librarian of Congress ==
=== Appointment ===
Upon Jackson&#x27;s election in 1828, the incoming administration began a mass shift of government positions in favor of supportive Democrats via the spoils system. George Watterston, the librarian of Congress since 1815, had strong connections to many of Jackson&#x27;s opponents, including Henry Clay. Watterston was later described by historian David C. Mearns as having been a &quot;librarian of one side of the aisle&quot;. Jackson originally intended to replace Watterston with Charles P. Tutt, but Tutt declined in favor of a position as U.S. Navy Agent at Pensacola.

Green wrote to Andrew Jackson on April 23, 1829, recommending Meehan as Watterston&#x27;s replacement for librarian of Congress. Green, in increasing amounts of debt, wished to hire an assistant editor at a lower rate than that agreed for Meehan. Biographer Christian Nappo described the letter as significantly embellishing Meehan&#x27;s scholarly capabilities and his appointment itself as &quot;purely an act of political patronage&quot;.

Meehan was officially appointed as librarian on May 28, 1829. Clay, angered by the appointment, compared Watterston&#x27;s removal to the burning of the Library of Alexandria. The &quot;New-England Palladium&quot; condemned Watterston&#x27;s removal but conceded that Meehan was ultimately &quot;an amiable and respectable man&quot; and preferable to other possible Jacksonian candidates. The strongly anti-Jacksonian &quot;National Journal&quot; and Meehan&#x27;s former &quot;United States&#x27; Telegraph&quot; extensively covered Meehan&#x27;s appointment, debating the legality of the move. Jacksonian press attacked Watterston&#x27;s character, describing him as pompous and impractical.

Debates over the appointment also reflected broader attitudes towards the future of the library. Rather than simply providing for Congress, Watterston sought to transform the Library of Congress into a comprehensive national library aimed at the education of the general public, which Jacksonians feared would represent increased federal power. However, Jackson may have been unaware of Watterston&#x27;s plans when initially appointing Meehan.

Watterston himself was indignant at his replacement, describing Meehan as &quot;very ordinary&quot; and unfitting for the Library of Congress. He repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim the position for the rest of his life, through what biographer John McDonough described as a mix of &quot;cajolery, threats, and flattery&quot;. Despite his past as a partisan editor, Meehan remained a relatively apolitical librarian, and he retained his position through multiple Whig presidencies.

=== Tenure ===
When Meehan took office, the library was situated within the western portion of the U.S. Capitol, and contained about 16,000 books. He wrote in irritation at the conditions within the library, describing the various maintenance tasks needed to restore damaged books, clean shelves, and remove bookworms. In July 1832, Congress approved expansions to the Law Library of Congress, designating a nearby room to hold the slightly over 2,000 law books held in the collections. Around this time, Meehan appointed his son C. H. Wharton Meehan, previously employed as his assistant, to head the Law Library.

From the outset, Meehan collaborated with the Congressional Joint Committee on the Library, often deferring to its advice regardless of partisan lines. He worked closely with the Democratic-Republican Edward Everett during the early 1830s. Maryland Senator James Pearce was appointed chairman of the Joint Committee in 1845, beginning a long-running period of close collaboration between him and Meehan. Historian Carl Ostrowski described Meehan as having &quot;never made a move without first consulting Pearce&quot;. Ostrowski characterized the Joint Committee during this period as negligent to the library, often not meeting or failing to achieve a quorum.

The Joint Committee was generally on the forefront of management during the 1830s and 1840s. &quot;National Intelligencer&quot; coverage in the mid-1830s attributed the Library&#x27;s holdings to various members of the committee, briefly praising Meehan for his &quot;civility and attention&quot; to visitors. In contrast to Watterston&#x27;s prominent role in discussion of American libraries, he is not mentioned within 1830s periodicals on American libraries.

==== Cataloguing and acquisitions ====
A steady appropriation of a year for the purchase of books, plus an additional – for law books, was allocated to Meehan throughout his career with occasional exceptions. Meehan steadily acquired books, although he was criticized for prioritizing the acquisition of popular books over scholarly concerns. Journalist Anne Royall rebuked him for his purchasing habits, claiming he had failed to &quot;anticipate the research needs of legislators or scholars&quot; and criticizing the acquisition of numerous books intended for Sunday school students. Two major opportunities were presented to purchase expansive collections but were both denied by Congress, with Meehan doing little to advocate for the prospect. An 1836 offer to purchase Russian nobleman Dmitry Buturlin&#x27;s multilingual collection of 25,000 books was denied by a 17–16 vote. An offer in 1844 to acquire the Durazzo family library, containing over 10,000 volumes, was rejected for largely containing non-English literature.

Classification systems in the library were archaic, with shelves placed in accordance with a modified version of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s original classification schema, itself based on the Baconian conceptualization of knowledge. Books were generally categorized by subject and within subjects by size. Library catalogs divided books by subject, with books within each subject listed alphabetically. Many years passed between different general catalogs of the library, requiring the consultation of additional supplementary listings. A new catalog was produced in 1839, the first since 1830. The total number of volumes in the library had increased to around 30,000, encompassing 10,746 titles. Over time, the time-intensive task of cataloging new entries was delegated to Meehan&#x27;s assistant, E. B. Stelle. The limited space and resources available to the library strongly limited the number of books which could be received. In 1849, Meehan wrote to the library&#x27;s book agent Obadiah Rich, noting that the &quot;rooms for the accommodation of our Library are now so thoroughly filled, that we find it very difficult to take in any more books.&quot; Due to his reputation as a skilled businessman, Meehan was tasked by Congress to manage and book-keep what biographer John McDonough labeled a &quot;bewildering variety of special funds&quot; in addition to his duties within the library. Many of these were publishing or printing funds, with specific funds for the republication of the works of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison, as well as publications on the United States Exploring Expedition and the Library of Congress catalog. Additional funds placed on Meehan&#x27;s caseload included the funding for G. P. A. Healy&#x27;s portraits of presidents, a fund to acquire art for display at the Capitol, and the United States Botanic Garden Fund, which at times forced Meehan to supervise the garden&#x27;s workers and handle correspondence with Congressmen seeking plant specimens for their home gardens.In 1840, French ventriloquist and actor Alexandre Vattemare received federal support for his proposed government document exchange system between the United States and France. Meehan provided Vattemare with 700 volumes of congressional documents, an amount &quot;said to be twice as large as any in Washington&quot;. Widespread American enthusiasm for the program led to a massive quantity of documents, which Vattemare was unable to manage effectively. Meehan grew increasingly upset with the poor condition of shipments received through the program, describing the documents as poor quality and incomplete. At least two French diplomatic officials contacted Meehan and asked him not to pursue exchanges through Vattemare. Congress terminated the program in June 1853. Despite this, Vattemare continued sporadic and unwanted shipments of books to the Library of Congress. The final shipment was sent in 1858, leading to a frustrated response from Meehan and the return of Vattemare&#x27;s shipment, unopened.

==== Fire of 1851 and aftermath ====
Slightly before 8:00am on December 24, 1851, a large fire broke out in the main room of the Library of Congress. Meehan was quickly summoned to the scene. Freezing temperatures impaired fire hoses, slowing efforts to put out the fire. While the main room was essentially unsalvageable, books in adjacent rooms were quickly moved to safety. A number of fire engine crews, alongside a group of nearby Marines, were able to extinguish the blaze by around 11:00am. About 35,000 of the library&#x27;s 55,000 books were destroyed, alongside various paintings and statues. An inquiry was launched over the coming days to investigate the cause of the fire: after testimony from Meehan, Thomas U. Walter, the Architect of the Capitol, determined that the fire was sparked by the timbers of library alcoves extending into a chimney-flue. Any potential censures or charges were dismissed.

Pearce comforted Meehan in the aftermath of the 1851 fire, leading him to describe Pearce as &quot;so eminent a gentleman, and so discriminating a friend&quot;. Together with Walter, they worked steadily on rebuilding efforts over the course of 1852. Congress authorized various appropriations to finance the reconstruction of the library and the repurchase of lost books. By March 1852, temporary facilities for the library had been finished. The construction process of the main library faced numerous delays, irritating Meehan. While Walter had promised in March that the work would be completed in three months, the reconstruction of the main room was not finished until early 1853. Despite these delays, Meehan was extremely pleased with the library room, calling it &quot;truly beautiful&quot;.Meehan commissioned Rich Brothers, a London-based book dealing firm, to restock the library. His purchasing efforts were criticized by an anonymous two-part &quot;National Intelligencer&quot; article (sometimes attributed to Smithsonian librarian Charles Coffin Jewett) stating that an agent should have been sent overseas to purchase books and that the Library of Congress should have attempted to become &quot;a systematic collection of books chosen with competent bibliographic learning for a specific and well-defined purpose&quot;. Meehan rebuked the anonymous author, writing that such efforts would place &quot;Congress in a position which admits that they cannot select the books they need.&quot;

Meehan diligently produced various &quot;want lists&quot; based on earlier catalogs. Although control over what books the library was to purchase had been shifted from the Joint Committee to the librarian of Congress, Meehan reassured Pearce that the prior system was still in effect and that he did not intend to expand his control over book acquisition. Congressman and educational reformer Horace Mann submitted a resolution to the committee shortly before his congressional retirement in March 1853, calling for the library to accept any of the lost books if offered at a cheaper price than other sellers. This was strongly opposed by Pearce and Meehan, who preferred the ease of purchases through the Rich Brothers. In response, they waited out Mann&#x27;s retirement and the beginning of the 33rd United States Congress and continued the previous path.

The library&#x27;s collections were restored by early 1856, following the purchase of 36,000 books at a &quot;cost very far below the prices given for the lost books&quot; through Rich Brothers. Increased annual funding for the library, on top of various special appropriations, enabled the rapid growth of the library over the following years. An attempt by Jewett and the Smithsonian Institution to re-catalog the library ended after criticism from Meehan. Rumors that President Franklin Pierce had appointed a new librarian of Congress troubled Meehan. After consultation with Pearce, he met with Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, who reassured him that the rumors were unfounded. Secretary of State Lewis Cass of the succeeding Buchanan administration also reaffirmed Meehan&#x27;s position as librarian.

=== Removal ===
Following the election of Abraham Lincoln and the ensuing secession of the southern states in late 1860 and early 1861, Meehan&#x27;s position became increasingly unstable. Ainsworth Spofford described him as a &quot;very ancient fossil&quot;, and rumors began to circulate of pro-Southern sympathies. Pearce wrote to Lincoln in March 1861, asking that Meehan be allowed to continue his role as librarian. Following extensive lobbying and support from various Midwestern Republicans, Indiana physician and Lincoln campaign delegate John Gould Stephenson was able to convince Lincoln to choose him for the position. Stephenson officially accepted his appointment on May 24, 1861, and Meehan left his duties at the end of the month.

=== Legacy ===
Stephenson, Meehan&#x27;s successor, complained that the library had fallen into disrepair and neglect. A December 1861 report commissioned by Stephenson (possibly written by Spofford) noted large numbers of uncleaned, miscataloged, and misplaced books. The cataloguing and purchasing systems were also noted to be deficient. Stephenson considered much of Meehan&#x27;s library staff incompetent and initiated a mass change of staff; Meehan&#x27;s son, Law Library head C. H. Wharton Meehan, became the sole retained assistant.

Later historians called into question Meehan&#x27;s abilities as librarian, criticizing his inability to transform the Library of Congress into a national library. In his 1904 &quot;History of the Library of Congress&quot;, historian William Dawson Johnston described Meehan as unable to foresee future needs of the library but able to maintain his position due to possessing &quot;the second qualification of a successful administrator, that is, business ability&quot;. Historian Carl Ostrowski was also critical of Meehan&#x27;s contributions to the library, noting in 2000 that he chose to exercise little influence over any area of library policy.

== Personal life and death ==
Meehan and his wife Margaret had seven children. Margaret died during childbirth in July 1826, followed by her infant later the same day. Meehan remarried in October 1827 to Rachel T. Monington, his wife&#x27;s sister, and the two would go on to have two more children together. Only three of Meehan&#x27;s children outlived him.

A year after leaving office, Meehan sought a position as a Treasury clerk due to financial concerns. Pearce and William P. Fessenden wrote to Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase on Meehan&#x27;s behalf to advocate for his employment. In the afternoon of April 24, 1863, Meehan suddenly died from apoplexy in his home in Capitol Hill, Washington. An obituary described him as &quot;[leaving] to his family that best inheritance, an unsullied name.&quot; C. H. Wharton Meehan continued in his role as custodian of the Law Library until his own death in July 1872.

<text>The relationship between Mormonism and Freemasonry began early in the life of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Smith&#x27;s older brother, Hyrum, and possibly his father, Joseph, Sr. were Freemasons while the family lived near Palmyra, New York. In the late 1820s, the western New York region was swept with anti-Masonic fervor.

Nevertheless, by the 1840s, Smith and several prominent Latter Day Saints had become Freemasons and joined the Masonic Lodge in Nauvoo, Illinois. Soon after joining Freemasonry, Smith introduced the temple endowment ceremony including a number of symbolic elements that were very similar to those in Freemasonry. Smith remained a Freemason until his death; however, later leaders in the movement have distanced themselves from Freemasonry. In modern times, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has clarified in its &quot;Now You Know&quot; series that its members may become Freemasons.

== Historical connections ==
A significant number of leaders in the early Latter Day Saint movement were Masons prior to their involvement in the movement, including Heber C. Kimball and John C. Bennett.

Joseph&#x27;s brother, Hyrum, was a Freemason; their father, Joseph, Sr. is also believed to have been a Freemason:

In regard to Joseph Smith Sr, however, nine men in total lived in Ontario County, New York (where Canandaigua is located) named Joseph Smith, according to the 1820 census for that county. There is, therefore, only a 1 in 9 chance that the documentation cited in Terry Chateau&#x27;s quote references Joseph Smith Sr and not some other man by the same name.

On 15 October 1841, Abraham Jonas (then the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge AF&amp;AM of Illinois) issued a dispensation empowering a Lodge in Nauvoo and appointed the following individuals to be its officers: George Miller, Esq. as its first Worshipful Master; John Parker as its first Senior Warden; and Lucius Scovil as its first Junior Warden. This dispensation empowered the Masons in Nauvoo to meet as a Lodge. The Lodge met on 29 December 1841 and accepted this dispensation. Officers for the Lodge were then elected and appointed. Bylaws for the Lodge were thereafter penned and adopted.

On 17 February 1842, the Lodge voted to hold off on installing its officers until 15 March; a request was also sent to Grand Master Jonas for him to preside over that Installation, which he accepted. Joseph Smith Jr (who was not yet a Mason) was appointed to serve in a pro-tempore position as Grand Installing Chaplain for this Installation. He and Sidney Rigdon were initiated as Entered Apprentices in the evening after the Installation, thereby becoming members of the newly-formed Nauvoo lodge; Abraham Jonas presided over that degree ceremony.

It appears that John C. Bennett had a particularly strong influence in the spread of Freemasonry among the Mormons. Within the year, there were over 300 Masons in Nauvoo Lodge, which resulted in Meredith Helm (the then-Grand Master who had succeeded Jonas) to issue dispensations to form two other Lodges in the Spring of 1843. One was called Nye Lodge (named for Rev. Jonathan Nye, who had previously served as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Vermont from 1815 to 1817 and as Grand Master of the Grand Encampment of Knights Templar, USA from 1829 to 1835) and Helm Lodge (named for the Grand Master who issued this dispensation).

Soon after this, over 1,500 Mormon men in the city of Nauvoo were practicing Masons.

Smith and Rigdon were raised to the third degree of Master Mason &quot;on sight&quot; by Grand Master Jonas of the Grand Lodge of Illinois. At the time and in the jurisdiction of that Grand Lodge, this meant that Joseph and Sidney could go through the three degree ceremonies in a relatively short time without having to prove their respective proficiencies between each degree. They each were passed to the degree of Fellowcraft on the morning of 16 March 1842 and raised to the degree of Master Mason later that day.

Note that Joseph Smith&#x27;s journal does not mention the sublime degree on Mar 16, 1842, stating only &quot;Continued with the Lodge&quot;. However, minutes from the Nauvoo lodge on the same day do state, &quot;Joseph Smith applied for the third and sublime degree...he was duly raised...&quot;

On 17 March 1842, the Relief Society was established as an auxiliary group for the female members of the church. Its structure originally had similarities to that of the Masonic Lodge; however, the Relief Society never had its own degree ceremonies nor did it ever purport to confer degrees of any kind on its members.

Hyrum Smith was not only one of Joseph&#x27;s older brothers but also succeeded their father as Presiding Patriarch and Cowdery as Assistant President of the Church.

Bodley Lodge No. 1 in Quincy, IL presented concerns that the special dispensation granted to Nauvoo Lodge, U.D., was improper, and on August 11, 1842, the special dispensation was suspended by Grand Master Abraham Jonas until the annual Communication of the Illinois Grand Lodge. &quot;During the short period covering its activities, this Lodge initiated 286 candidates and raised almost as many. John C. Bennett reports an instance in which 63 persons were elected on a single ballot.&quot; This suspension was later lifted and the Mormon Lodges resumed work although several irregularities in their practice were noted. The irregularities centered on mass balloting (voting on more than one candidate at a time) and not requiring proficiency in each degree before proceeding to the next degree (in many cases, initiates were being passed to the Fellowcraft degree and raised to the Master Mason degree within two days of being initiated as an Entered Apprentice).

There were 5 Masonic Lodges in Mormon communities by April 27, 1843:

* Nauvoo Lodge, U.D. (Nauvoo, IL)
* Helm Lodge, U.D. (Nauvoo, IL)
* Nye Lodge, U.D. (Nauvoo, IL)
* Rising Sun Lodge No.12 (Montrose, IA)
* Keokuk Lodge, U.D. (Keokuk, IA)

There were eventually 1,492 members of these lodges, but only a total of 414 Masons in all the other Illinois lodges. A resolution passed in the Grand Lodge of Illinois on October 3, 1843 to revoke the charter of Rising Sun Lodge, revoke the dispensations of and refuse to provide charters for the rest of these Lodges for the following reasons:

Rising Sun Lodge No. 12

* had not paid its dues to the Grand Lodge
* was doing its Masonic work irregularly (or improperly).

Nauvoo Lodge, U.D.

* was doing its Masonic work irregularly.
* failed to bring its record books to the Grand Lodge for inspection.
* was making men Masons without regard to character.
* was not requiring its candidates to become proficient in one degree before being pushed through another degree.

Helm Lodge, U.D.

* was doing its Masonic work irregularly, particularly by &quot;acting on four petitions in one day&quot;.
* was pushing candidates from the first degree to the third within two-day time-periods.
* failed to present their records to the Grand Lodge for inspection.
* had only paid a portion of its dues to the Grand Lodge.

Nye Lodge, U.D.

* had the same problems as Helm Lodge.
* initiated candidates within a day of receiving their petitions (thereby not leaving any time for the petitions to be examined, the petitioner to be investigated, and the Lodge to elect the petitioner to become a candidate for the degrees).

Keokuk Lodge, U.D.

* was doing its Masonic work irregularly.
* had allowed petitions to be received and acted upon &quot;within one lunar month.&quot;

Following this resolution, Grand Master Alexander Dunlap later sent a representative of the Grand Lodge to Nauvoo Lodge to revoke its dispensation. According to the records of the Grand Lodge, its representative was &quot;treated with contempt,&quot; the Lodge refused to part with its charger, and the Lodge stated that they would continue to do Masonic work. Because of this, a resolution in the Grand Lodge of Illinois passed on October 10, 1844 that withdrew all fellowship with Nauvoo Lodge, Helm Lodge, Nye Lodge, and all members thereof; that the Masons working in these Lodges be considered clandestine (or illegitimate), and that all members thereof be suspended from the privileges of Masonry in Illinois. The Lodge in Keokuk seems not to have been given the courtesy of being properly informed by the Grand Lodge of its charter being revoked or its members suspended following the 1843 resolution:

It is theorized that, when Smith was in Carthage Jail in 1844, after he fired his last round in a small pepper-box pistol, he ran to the window and held up his arms in what may have been a Masonic call of distress, hoping Masons in the contingent would honor this call and not fire on him. It is recorded that he ran towards the open window with uplifted hands, and proclaimed, &quot;O Lord my God.&quot; Most people see this as only a plea to God for aid, although others suspect otherwise. &quot;The Warsaw Signal&quot; (the local newspaper based where those indicted for the conspiracy to murder Joseph and Hyrum resided), on the other hand, shortly afterwards wrote that Joseph&#x27;s last words were &quot;Oh my God!&quot; There is no evidence that any Masons participated in the attack on Carthage Jail (aside from the four victims of the attack; namely, Joseph Smith, Jr, Hyrum Smith, John Taylor, and Willard Richards). Three of the five men who were later indicted for conspiring to murder Smith were later initiated as Freemasons in Warsaw Lodge:

* Levi Williams
* Thomas Sharp
* Jacob Davis

However, because Freemasonry requires its members to be law-abiding citizens, this resulted in the Grand Lodge of Illinois initiating an investigation into improper conduct of Warsaw Lodge. Warsaw Lodge later relinquished their charter (which allowed it to meet and work as a Masonic Lodge) to the Grand Lodge of Illinois, citing lack of space as the reason why they did not want to meet anymore; since their meeting space was never an issue prior to the investigation, many assume that Warsaw Lodge used this as a pretext to avoid investigation and save face. There are claims that Mark Aldrich, another of the five men who were indicted for conspiracy to murder, was already a Mason of Warsaw Lodge. These five men were cleared of all wrongdoing by the courts.

The Lodge in Nauvoo continued its activities until April 10, 1845, when Brigham Young and George A. Smith advised Lucius Scovil to suspend the work of the Masons in Nauvoo. Only a few additional meetings were held prior to departure of those who followed Young to the Great Basin in 1846 after the succession crisis.

After arriving to the Great Basin, some Latter-day Saints who were Masons sent requests for dispensations to other Grand Lodge jurisdictions in the hopes of being able to meet regularly as a Lodge. Such requests were sent to the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) and to one of the Grand Lodges in Mexico; the UGLE never received the letter, and the Grand Lodge in Mexico denied the request.

Lodges were later established in the Utah Territory by Masons who were not adherents of the LDS Church. Four such Lodges were formed: Rocky Mountain Lodge No. 205 (formed by dispensation by the Grand Lodge of Missouri), Mount Moriah Lodge No. 62 (formed by dispensation by the Grand Lodge of Kansas), Wasatch Lodge, U.D. (formed by dispensation from the Grand Lodge of Montana Territory, now the Grand Lodge of Montana), and Argenta Lodge, U.D. (formed by dispensation by the Grand Lodge of Colorado). Rocky Mountain Lodge was a military Lodge made up of US Army soldiers who had come out to what is now Utah because of Buchanan&#x27;s Blunder; the Lodge eventually came to an end because of the Civil War, which required that these troops withdraw out of the area; in January 1872, the other three of these Lodges went on to establish the Grand Lodge AF&amp;AM of Utah.

From 1872 until 1925, the Grand Lodge of Utah had an informal ban against Latter-day Saints due to the question of polygamy. Polygamy was a federal crime and, although the LDS Church had issued a prohibition against the practice in 1890, it was believed by many outside of the Church that it still practiced polygamy in secret.

In 1925, the Grand Lodge of Utah adopted a formal ban against members of the LDS Church (including church members who had already become Freemasons under other recognized grand lodge jurisdictions)—no reason was given except that the church was not compatible with Freemasonry; this ban was lifted in 1984. In 2008, a Latter-day Saint served as the Grand Lodge&#x27;s first LDS Grand Master; it was estimated that he was the first Latter-day Saint to serve as Grand Master of any jurisdiction in approximately 100 years.

==Prophets who were Freemasons==
At least the first five presidents of the LDS Church are confirmed to have gone through the three degrees of Freemasonry:

They had all joined while living in Nauvoo, Illinois, bringing the practice westward when the Saints migrated to Utah.

Although Lorenzo Snow also went through the degree ceremonies in Nauvoo Lodge, his initiation occurred after Nauvoo Lodge&#x27;s dispensation had been suspended by the Grand Lodge of Illinois in the spring of that year; in October of that year, the dispensation was revoked. He therefore would not have been considered a regular (legitimate) Mason by the mainstream Masonic community, as his initiation—as well as his passing and raising, for that matter—was done by a Lodge acting without a dispensation.

==Similarities in symbolism and ritual in the LDS Church==

LDS Church temple worship shares a limited commonality of symbols, signs, and vocabulary with Freemasonry, including aprons, tokens, ritualistic raising of the arms, etc. Many of these symbols have been adopted and adapted from Masonry to illustrate the principles taught in the movement. For example, whereas Masons exchange secret tokens to identify fellow Freemasons, the ceremonies of the church teach that these tokens must be given to sentinel angels so that disciples of Jesus Christ may be admitted into the highest kingdom of heaven. The LDS Church&#x27;s temple garments also bear the symbols adopted and adapted from Masonry: those of the Square and Compass; although the movement has imbued these symbols with religious meaning that wholly differs from the meaning of the symbols as used in Freemasonry. The Square and Compasses were a part of the first Angel Moroni statue, hanging above a horizontal Moroni (which doubled as a weather vane). Additionally, the symbols of the square and compasses exist in other ancient traditions far older than Masonry such as in Christian art and the Chinese legend Fuxi and Nüwa.

Brigham Young is quoted as describing the origin of the temple rituals in a fashion that directly relates to the story of Hiram Abiff from Masonic folklore. Although Young changed some of the key Masonic aspects about Abiff to fit better with the view of LDS Church temples, the story is the same:

==Historical position and official policy of the LDS Church==

After the Saints&#x27; failed attempts to obtain charters from England and Mexico, Brigham Young decided not to pursue the goal any further.

Eventually, trade unions that were ritualistic and oath-bound started to come into the Utah Territory that were perceived by the leadership of the church to be destabilizing the territorial economy. We see an example of this in a letter written by church president Wilford Woodruff and his two counselors, George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith concerning whether members of the Ancient Order of United Workmen could hold temple recommends in the church:
In 1901, the following circular letter from church president Lorenzo Snow and his first counselor, Joseph F. Smith, to all stake presidencies concerning church members&#x27; desires to join &quot;secret orders&quot;:

Snow&#x27;s outlook on secret societies in general may have been formed from:

* the tense relationships between Nauvoo Lodge, U. D. (in which he was initiated after the Lodge had been suspended) and the Grand Lodge of Illinois.
* the tense relationships between the members of the Church in Utah and the Grand Lodge of Utah.
* the Rock Springs massacre (which had happened only about 15 years prior, in which members of a secret society called the Knights of Labor had killed scores of Chinese immigrants and drove the rest out of Wyoming).
* the 1896 circular from the First Presidency concerning the A. O. U. W. quoted above.

Later policies in the church against joining secret societies in general had been formed more due to such trade unions and insurance benefit organizations as noted above; President Joseph F. Smith later split these into two policies regarding such trade unions (specified as &quot;Secret Organizations&quot;) and fraternal societies (specified as &quot;Secret Societies&quot;):Secret Organizations. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is good enough for me and my family, and I have no time nor means to associate myself with organizations that are not of this Church and which have simply for their objective the laying up of something for my wife to have after I am dead. I cannot afford to do it for this reason: the Lord has seen fit to give me from day to day just sufficient for my needs, and if I were to join these associations for the purpose of looking after the future of my family, I would be compelled to neglect paying my tithing, and present duties, because I would not have means enough to pay my tithing and my dues for these associations. We have known members of the Church, who, when they were asked why they did not pay their tithing, confessed that they were associated with organizations of one kind and another, wherein they were compelled to pay weekly or monthly certain sums of money; they had been associated with these institutions for a number of years, and had put quite a lot of money in them; and now, if they did not continue to pay their dues they would lose all they had put in, then in case of death their families lose the premium. From this you can see they are in bondage to these secret organizations, and if they want to pay tithing they cannot do it. Well, if they do not, they will be among those whose names will not be found recorded in the books of the law of the Lord and who will not have inheritance in the Zion of God. Furthermore, we have called some of these men to go on missions, but they could not go to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth. Why? Because they belonged to certain secret associations, and they were compelled to be at work all the time in order to pay their dues, or they would lose what they had put in them.

Secret Societies. It is a well known truth that the counsel of the First Presidency of the Church, in all cases, has been and is against our brethren joining secret organizations for any purpose whatsoever, and that wherever any of them have already joined, they have been and are counseled to withdraw themselves from such organizations, as soon as circumstances permit and wisdom dictates. In taking this position, there has not been, neither is it intended that there shall be, any controversy with the societies, and with their aims and objects. The merits of the various orders are not considered at all; their aims may be ever so worthy and their objects ever so commendable. That matter does not enter into the discussion, so far as a member of our Church is concerned.

The gospel of Jesus Christ is true, and is a power unto salvation, temporal and spiritual. A man who complies in every respect therewith has everything that any society can offer, with countess truths and consolations added: &quot;But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.&quot; The Church is divinely organized, and in that organization there is provision for the development and practice of every virtue known, every charity revealed. For this reason and for its promise of eternal life and glory, the gospel, and the Church divinely established for its promulgation, should be nearer and dearer to a follower of Christ than all other things. &quot;No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye can not serve God and Mammon.&quot;

The members of our Church who have faith to heed the advice of the authorities thereof, will not ally themselves, under any pretense, with any organization not instituted by the Lord for the building up of Zion. Neither will they, for any consideration, allow themselves to imbibe the spirit of the world, or be tempted to lose their faith, which will be the result with those who divide their interests, devoting some to other organizations. This is the testimony of those who have joined and who have later withdrawn. Nothing can be permitted in the members that is calculated to bring division and weakness to the Church, yet those who have been led to join other institutions should not be dealt with harshly, but should be made to understand the position of the Church, and where it is so understood, they should shape their affairs for withdrawal, in humility and repentance, from that which threatens their standing.

—&quot;Chapter VIII: The Church and Man,&quot; &quot;Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith&quot;, The Deseret News, Salt Lake City, 1919, pp. 134-136.These positions were combined and reiterated in Church&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Instructions&quot; in 1934 and in 1940:Secret Organizations—Members of the Church are strongly advised not to become identified as members with any organization established for the benefit of any group which is antagonistic to the Church, is oath-bound, or is of such character as would cause members of the Church to lose interest in Church activities or interfere with the performance of their duties. This does not apply to any association that is free from the conditions above-mentioned and that is organized for the commercial or general welfare of its members. The important thing for every Church member to determine very carefully in advance is whether the proposed connection is such as to cause him to lose interest in the Church by the associations to be formed, or to interfere with his duties and activities in the Church. It is felt that there is ample opportunity for all members to devote their time profitably to the various activities of the Church.

On page 135 of Gospel Doctrine, the rule established by President Joseph F. Smith relating to secret organizations may be found. This rule, which was endorsed during his administration, has not been changed nor modified. It is felt that there is an incompatibility between membership in secret lodges and membership in the Church. This is particularly the case where to all intents and purposes the lodge is also a religion. It is felt that it is impossible for a member of the Church to have two religions. The activities of the Church are such that they cannot be properly performed when one is not able to devote his full time to the duties required of him. If the time at one&#x27;s disposal is divided between the lodge and the Church it is obvious that neither activity can be fully served, and it usually results in the easier activity being the one that absorbs the time.

As to whether Church members who belong to secret oath-bound organizations shall be ordained to or advanced in the priesthood or given the privileges of the Temple depends upon their standing in the Church. While it is felt that there is no occasion or justification for our people joining or continuing memberships in lodges if there are members of such lodges who are otherwise faithful in the observance of the commandments of the Lord and are exemplary in their habits, they may be accorded the privileges of the priesthood and the Temple.

—&quot;Handbook of Instructions for Stake Presidencies, Bishops and Counselors, Stake and Ward Clerks, and Other Church Officers&quot;.Further explanation for this policy was given in 1934 by Anthony W. Ivins of the First Presidency of the LDS Church:The Mormon Church has no quarrel with Free Masonry or any other organization which is formed for a righteous purpose. It advises its members to refrain from identifying themselves with any secret, oath-bound society. It believes that there exist within the Church all the elements which are necessary for spiritual, social, and ethical development of its members. We have observed that affiliation with secret, oath-bound organizations tends to draw people away from the performance of Church duties. It is difficult to serve two masters and do justice to both. Since the establishment of the Church many persons have drifted away from it and become members of other organizations. We have not discovered an instance where such change has made a man or woman more honest, moral, temperate, and exemplary.

On the other hand men and women from all walks of life, Masons included, who have identified themselves with the Church, testify that their mode of life has been entirely changed. From despair they have found hope, from sin they have found redemption; their lives have been made cleaner, more wholesome, happier. If this is true, is it not proper that the Church advise its members to seek within the circle of its membership the association which is so necessary to provide the ethical atmosphere which is indispensable to human welfare and happiness.

A Mason who may become a member of the Mormon Church is in no way restrained from affiliation with his lodge, nor does the fact that he is a Mason in any degree bar him from receiving the highest order of priesthood that can be conferred upon man, viz, the Melchizedek Priesthood.

—Ivins, Anthony W., &quot;Introduction,&quot; &quot;Relationship of &quot;Mormonism&quot; and Freemasonry&quot;, The Deseret News Press, 1934 pp. 9-10.Such remained the policy of the Church through 1985. However, resultant of the Grand Lodge of Utah lifting its formal ban against members of the Church, the Church removed mention of secret societies and secret organizations from its policies in its 1989 edition of its General Handbook as well as all subsequent editions. Since that time, the LDS Church&#x27;s First Presidency has not made an official statement as to whether Freemasonry in particular is compatible with its membership. Don LeFevre, a past church spokesman said that the LDS Church—in outdated reference to above-given policies—&quot;strongly advises its members not to affiliate with organizations that are secret, oath-bound, or would cause them to lose interest in church activities.&quot; A more tolerant statement is found in the book &quot;Encyclopedia of Mormonism&quot;, written by church members, stating, &quot;The philosophy and major tenets of Freemasonry are not fundamentally incompatible with the teaching, theology, and doctrines of the Latter-day Saints. Both emphasize morality, sacrifice, consecration, and service, and both condemn selfishness, sin, and greed. Furthermore, the aim of Masonic ritual is to instruct—to make truth available so that man can follow it.&quot;

Today there is no formal obstacle in the Grand Lodge of Utah or in any other grand lodge preventing Latter-day Saints from becoming Freemasons. Exceptions have historically been those grand lodges that employ the Swedish Rite system, which requires a Christian Trinitarian belief of its members; these are located in the Nordic/Scandinavian countries. However, the Danish Order of Freemasons (whose Lodges use the Swedish Rite) is affiliated with two Grand Lodges that do not require its members to subscribe to Christian Trinitarian beliefs: The Ancient Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons of Denmark and the Saint John&#x27;s Lodge Association. In Sweden and Finland, one can choose between joining the Swedish Order of Freemasons (which uses the Swedish Rite) or the Grand Lodge of Finland (which does not use the Swedish Rite and which does not have the requirement of Christian Trinitarian belief to join). So, even in some of the countries where the Swedish Rite is employed, there still exist alternate options for Latter-day Saints to become Masons.

In 2019, the LDS Church produced a YouTube video in its &quot;Now You Know&quot; series entitled &quot;Joseph Smith and Masonry.&quot; The video states that &quot;the policy [of whether it is acceptable for members of the Church to become Freemasons] is simple: members of the Church […] are not prohibited from becoming Freemasons. Nor are Masons prohibited from becoming members of the Church. Latter-day Saints believe that good can be found in many places.&quot;

Since 1984, there have been many Masons in Utah who are Latter-day Saints and who serve and/or have served in various leadership positions, including Grand Masters, other Grand Officers, and Worshipful Masters; some of these have also served in and presided over various appendant, concordant, and/or affiliate side orders on a national and international basis. Outside of Utah, there have been many members of the LDS Church who have been Masons continuously since its early days.

<text>Mystic Towers is an isometric platform game developed by Animation F/X, and published in 1994 by Manaccom domestically and Apogee Software internationally. Originally exclusive to MS-DOS compatible operating systems, it was re-released on Steam in 2015 with Microsoft Windows and Mac OS support. It stars Baron Baldric, an old wizard with a magic staff and an array of amusing mannerisms, who must quest through twelve towers and rid them of monsters. &quot;Mystic Towers&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Baron Baldric: A Grave Adventure&quot;, a platform game in which Baron Baldric battled an evil sorcerer ancestor.

== Gameplay ==

Each tower consists of 45 rooms (5 floors with 9 rooms each), 15 monsters, and 1 monster generator. In each tower, Baldric must defeat all the monsters, destroy the monster generator, and obtain the Large Red Tower Key that opens the tower entrance.

Baron Baldric has a health bar showing his hit points, which decrease as Baldric takes damage from monsters, is poisoned, or steps on traps. When his health meter runs out, Baldric loses a life. He begins with nine lives in reserve (one life in Practice Mode), and gains more with every 10,000 points he earns. Points are earned by collecting treasure.

Baldric must consume enough food and drink to avoid starvation and thirst. If his food or drink bars reach zero, Baron Baldric slowly loses life until the bar is replenished. Otherwise, Baldric&#x27;s health slowly recharges over time. Food can be found in a variety of places, and some monsters can be eaten after they are killed. Drinks come in bottles and flasks, as well as water fountains. Some bottles contain wine, which makes Baron Baldric intoxicated (characterised by spinning and hiccuping) for a short while.

Baron Baldric can become poisoned by stepping on a poison tile, drinking slime, or getting hit by a venom cloud. Baron Baldric slowly loses health when poisoned. To cure poison, the player can use a heal spell, drink slime from outlets, or eat a mushroom. If Baron Baldric eats a mushroom when he is not poisoned, he dies instantly.

There are 6 towers in the game. Each tower has an &quot;Apprentice&quot; version, which Baldric visits on the first half of his quest, and a &quot;Wizard&quot; version, which he visits on the second. In Wizard towers, Baldric does not start with maps of each floor, the monsters are significantly stronger and faster, teleporters do not link in a ring but direct, the Red Tower Key is not in the starting room, and there are new classes of obstacles to overcome.

Baldric starts each tower afresh, with his food, drink, and health bars all refilled, and his inventory of spells and coins lost. Only his extra lives and score are carried over.

The game&#x27;s &quot;Practice Mode&quot; is the opposite of what its name suggests, an extra difficult mode suited only to those who have already mastered the game&#x27;s mechanics. In this mode, players select a single tower to play through, with both apprentice and wizard versions of all the towers available. All the same dangers are present as in the story mode, but the player has only one extra life and cannot save their game.

=== Spells ===
There are a total of ten spells in the game. The first five are damage spells (Ice, Sulphur, Venom Cloud, Fireball and Lightning) for killing monsters and differ from each other only in the specific amount of damage they do and the fact that Ice has unlimited ammunition. The other five spells (Reveal, Heal, Teleport, Levitate, and Bomb) are utility spells. The Reveal spell lights up dark rooms, and reveals hidden doors, treasure, and poison tiles. The Heal Spell restores Baldric&#x27;s health and cures poison. Teleport can only be used on a teleport pad, which transports him to the floor indicated by the number on the pad. Levitate makes Baldric float one level higher, and can be stacked. Baron Baldric can return to the ground by jumping. Finally, the Bomb can be cast only on a monster generator, as part of the criteria of completing the level.

Coins can be collected to purchase spells. The higher the floor of the tower in which a spell is purchased, the more powerful the spell generally is. Although all the spells except Ice are collectable, only the damage spells are purchasable.

Several monsters can cast spells, with seemingly no limits. Venom Cloud has the ability to poison Baron Baldric, and Lightning can kill in two hits.

=== Power-ups ===
There are three types of power-ups, all of which last a limited amount of time:

* Meta-power greatly boosts the power of Baron Baldric&#x27;s currently equipped spell.
* Invisibility makes Baron Baldric invisible. Monsters will not attack Baron Baldric unless they run into him, and auto-fire rooms (rooms that sense the presence of Baldric and fire) will not activate.
* Shields make Baldric invulnerable. Monsters will not attack, and Baldric is immune to poison tiles, traps and fire. He can still be poisoned from drinking slime and killed from eating a poisonous mushroom when not poisoned.

<text>Parekura Tureia Horomia (9 November 1950 – 29 April 2013) was a New Zealand Labour Party politician who served as Minister of Māori Affairs between 2000 and 2008.

==Early life==
Horomia was born in Tolaga Bay of Ngāti Porou, Te Aitanga Hauiti, Ngāti Kahungunu and Ngāi Tahu descent. He had seven brothers and sisters. As a schoolboy he used to walk five kilometres to school and back without shoes.

In his early life, he worked as a manual labourer, then as a printer in the newspaper industry. Later, Horomia became involved in the Department of Labour&#x27;s East Coast work schemes and was appointed to supervisory positions—rising to general manager of the Community Employment Group by 1992. At the same time, he began to take on a number of prominent positions with Māori community organisations. In 1990, Horomia was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

== Member of Parliament ==



In the 1999 election, Horomia stood as the Labour Party candidate for the Ikaroa-Rāwhiti electorate, a Māori electorate on the east coast of the North Island, stretching from Gisborne to Upper Hutt. He defeated Derek Fox, a prominent figure in Māori politics, who was standing as an independent candidate.

In the new Labour government formed after that election, Horomia became a minister outside cabinet, being Associate Minister of Māori Affairs, Associate Minister for Economic Development, Associate Minister of Employment, and Associate Minister of Education. In 2000, Dover Samuels was forced to step down as Minister of Māori Affairs after criminal allegations were made against him, and Horomia was appointed in his place. Although Samuels was cleared, it was decided that Horomia would retain the Māori Affairs portfolio.

Labour was defeated in the 2008 general election, but Horomia retained his seat – increasing his majority to about 1600. This was despite a challenge from well-known broadcaster Derek Fox.

== Achievements ==
Horomia played a significant role in setting up Māori Television and expanding the role of iwi radio in New Zealand. Former Prime Minister Helen Clark said she had frequently relied on his knowledge of Māoridom and Māoritanga and his input was crucial to the Foreshore and Seabed legislation, which Labour passed in 2004 while he was minister. After the controversial bill became law, Associate Māori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia resigned from Labour to form the Māori Party. The law was repealed by the National Government in 2011.

== Death ==
Horomia was overweight for much of his life. He talked about his health battles and tried to lose weight many times. In 2004, he went on a public diet to encourage others to do the same. He died at his home on 29 April 2013 at the age of 62. As Horomia was an electorate MP, a by-election was held on 29 June 2013 to elect a replacement.

Tributes after his death came from not only his Labour MP colleagues, but also from the National Government. Labour leader David Shearer cut short a trip to Washington to attend his funeral and said he had &quot;an incredible work ethic, travelling to all parts of the country. He was accepted at pretty much every marae in the country, he was incredibly well-liked, had enormous heart, who worked so hard for his people.&quot;

His tangi was held the following week, and the funeral on 4 May.

<text>The Northern Meeting is a gathering held in Inverness, Scotland, best known for its solo bagpiping competition in September.

==History==
The Northern Meeting was set up in 1798 &quot;for the purpose of promoting a Social Intercourse&quot;, and early editions featured dinners, balls, concerts, and horse races.

&quot;An exhibition of Pipers and Dancers&quot; was included in the 1841 meeting, and in 1848 the Highland Society of London donated a Gold Medal, after their own piping competition ceased in 1844.

In 1789 the Northern Meeting built its own rooms on the corner of Church Street and Baron Taylor&#x27;s Street, and in 1864 the Northern Meeting Park in the centre of Inverness was established as a venue for the Highland Games. The Highland Games ceased to be run by the members of the Northern Meeting with the onset of World War II, and in 1946 the Northern Meeting Park was sold to Inverness Burgh Council who took over responsibility for running the Games and renamed it &quot;The Inverness Highland Games&quot; The rooms were sold in 1962 and since then the Ball and piping competitions have been held in venues around Inverness, except for between 2005 and 2007 when the piping competition was held in Aviemore due to the renovation of Eden Court Theatre.

In 1926 there were 850 people attending the ball. The bicentenary in 1988 was celebrated with a week of events reminiscent of earlier gatherings, with the centre-piece being a ball at Beaufort Castle attended by 1000 people.

The piping competition is currently held in early September, one or two weeks after the Argyllshire Gathering in Oban. Many pipers come to Scotland to compete in both events. Other events throughout the year include reel parties, cocktail parties and lunches.

==Piping competition==
The annual solo bagpiping competitions at the Northern Meeting are among the most prestigious in the calendar, especially the competition for the Gold Medal donated by the Highland Society of London. A maximum of between 25 and 35 pipers are in each competition.

The Senior piping competitions consist of three pibroch competitions and five light music competitions. The pibroch competitions are for the Gold Medal, the Silver Medal, and the Clasp for former winners of the Gold Medal. For light music, there are March, Strathspey and Reel competitions for A and B grades as well as one for former winners, and A and B grade Hornpipe and Jig competitions.

Eligibility for the Senior competitions is decided by a Joint Eligibility Committee, comprising representatives of the Northern Meeting, the Argyllshire Gathering, competition judges and the Competing Pipers Association.

There are also Junior competitions, with piobaireach and March, Strathspey and Reel (MSR) for under 15 and under 18 age grades.
