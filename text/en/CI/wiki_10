<text>In cultural anthropology, reciprocity refers to the non-market exchange of goods or labour ranging from direct barter (immediate exchange) to forms of gift exchange where a return is eventually expected (delayed exchange) as in the exchange of birthday gifts. It is thus distinct from the true gift, where no return is expected.

When the exchange is immediate, as in barter, it does not create a social relationship. When the exchange is delayed, it creates both a relationship as well as an obligation for a return (i.e. debt). Hence, some forms of reciprocity can establish a hierarchy if the debt is not repaid. The failure to make a return may end a relationship between equals. Reciprocal exchanges can also have a political effect through the creation of multiple obligations and the establishment of leadership, as in the gift exchanges (Moka) between Big Men in Melanesia. Some forms of reciprocity are thus closely related to redistribution, where goods and services are collected by a central figure for eventual distribution to followers.

Marshall Sahlins, an American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity (generalized, balanced and negative) in the book &quot;Stone Age Economics&quot; (1972). Reciprocity was also the general principle used by Claude Lévi-Strauss to explain the &quot;Elementary Structures of Kinship&quot; (1949), in one of the most influential works on kinship theory in the post-war period.

== The history of the &quot;norm of reciprocity&quot; in European economic thought ==

Annette Weiner argued that the &quot;norm of reciprocity&quot; is deeply implicated in the development of Western economic theory. Both John Locke and Adam Smith used the idea of reciprocity to justify a free market without state intervention. Reciprocity was used, on the one hand, to legitimize the idea of a self-regulating market; and to argue how individual vice was transformed into social good on the other. Western economic theorists starting with the eighteenth-century Scots economists Sir James Stuart and Smith differentiated pre-modern natural (or self-subsistent) economies from civilized economies marked by a division of labour that necessitated exchange. Like early sociologist Émile Durkheim, they viewed natural economies as characterized by mechanical solidarity (like so many peas in a pod) whereas the civilized division of labour made producers mutually dependent upon one another resulting in organic solidarity. These oppositions solidified by the late nineteenth century in the evolutionary idea of primitive communism marked by mechanical solidarity as the antithesis and alter ego of Western &quot;Homo economicus&quot;. It is this armchair anthropology opposition that originally informed modern anthropological debate when Malinowski sought to overturn the opposition and argue that archaic societies are equally regulated by the norm of reciprocity and maximizing behaviour.

The concept was key to the debate between early anthropologists Bronislaw Malinowski and Marcel Mauss on the meaning of &quot;Kula exchange&quot; in the Trobriand Islands off Papua New Guinea during the First World War. Malinowski used Kula exchange to demonstrate that apparently random gift-giving was in fact a key political process by which non-state political leadership spanning a vast archipelago was established. Gift-giving, he argued, was not altruistic (as it supposedly is in our society) but politically motivated for individual gain. Marcel Mauss theorized the impetus for a return as &quot;the spirit of the gift,&quot; an idea that has provoked a long debate in economic anthropology on what motivated the reciprocal exchange. Claude Lévi-Strauss, drawing on Mauss, argued there were three spheres of exchange governed by reciprocity: language (exchange of words), kinship (exchange of women), and economics (exchange of things). He thus claimed all human relationships are based on the norm of reciprocity. This claim has been disputed by anthropologists Jonathan Parry, Annette Weiner, and David Graeber amongst others.

== Basic types ==

===The domestic mode of production===
Marshall Sahlins has emphasized that non-market exchange is constrained by social relationships. That is, exchange in non-market societies is less about acquiring the means of production (whether land or tools) and more about the redistribution of finished goods throughout a community. These social relationships are largely kinship-based. His discussion of types of reciprocity is located within what he calls the &quot;domestic mode of production.&quot; His typology of reciprocity thus refers to &quot;cultures lacking a political state, and it applies only insofar as the economy and social relations have not been modified by the historic penetration of states.&quot; Paul Sillitoe has extended the analysis of reciprocity in these conditions, arguing that the type of reciprocity found will depend upon which sphere of production is being examined. The production of subsistence goods is under the control of domestic units and hence is marked by generalized reciprocity (or generalized exchange). Wealth objects – by their nature from outside – are competitively exchanged to acquire status, but no one is able to control their production and hence centralize power.

====Sahlins&#x27; typology====

In these circumstances, the reciprocal exchange can be divided into two types: dyadic back-and-forth exchange (reciprocity), and pooling (redistribution). Pooling is a system of reciprocities. It is a &quot;within&quot;-group relationship, whereas reciprocity is a &quot;between&quot; relationship. Pooling establishes a centre, whereas reciprocity inevitably establishes two distinct parties with their own interests. While the most basic form of pooling is that of food within the family, it is also the basis for sustained community efforts under a political leader.

Reciprocity, in contrast, is a dyadic exchange covering a range of possibilities, depending on individual interests. These interests will vary according to the social distance of the parties. A range of kinds of reciprocity can thus be sketched out, according to Sahlins:

* &quot;Generalized reciprocity&quot; (see also generalized exchange) refers to putatively altruistic transactions, the &quot;true gift&quot; marked by &quot;weak reciprocity&quot; due to the vagueness of the obligation to reciprocate. The material side of the transaction (the exchange of equally valuable goods) is repressed by the social side and the reckoning of debts is avoided. The time for the return gift is indefinite and not qualified in quantity or quality. A failure to reciprocate does not result in the giver ceasing to give.
* &quot;Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity&quot; refers to the direct exchange of customary equivalents without any delay, and hence includes some forms of &#x27;gift-exchange,&#x27; as well as purchases with &#x27;primitive money.&#x27; The exchange is less social, and is dominated by the material exchange and individual interests.
* &quot;Negative reciprocity&quot; is the attempt to get &quot;something for nothing with impunity.&quot; It may be described as &#x27;haggling,&#x27; &#x27;barter,&#x27; or &#x27;theft.&#x27; It is the most impersonal form of exchange, with interested parties seeking to maximize their gains.

====Reciprocity and kinship distance====

This typology of reciprocal exchange was developed by Sahlins in relation to the domestic mode of production (i.e. &#x27;stone age economics&#x27;) and hence should be contrasted with the 19th-century armchair conceptions of &#x27;primitive communism.&#x27; Within this same domestic mode of production, the degree of social distance – kinship in particular – affects the kind of reciprocity. Since kinship is the major way in which these societies are organized, nonkin (strangers) are viewed negatively. A general model of reciprocity must recognize that the closeness of the kin tie will vary according to the type of kinship system. In so far as kinship also determines residence, kinship closeness may also translate into spatial closeness. Hence one finds generalized reciprocity within the household-kinship group, balanced reciprocity within a spatial community, and negative reciprocity with outsiders (i.e. outside the community). This kind of reciprocity reflects the moral nature of the social relationship, hence morality is not universal, but dependent on social distance. Sahlins&#x27; model thus views reciprocity as socially, morally and economically structured and &quot;the structure is that of kinship-tribal groups&quot; not a universalizing moral ethic.

==== Reciprocity and kinship rank ====
With rank come privileges. However, in traditional societies &quot;social inequality is more the organization of economic equality. Often, in fact, high rank is only secured or sustained by overcrowing generosity.&quot; Rank is usually generational, with elders having seniority, but still held by the bounds of close kinship. Generalized reciprocity by such elders may be a &quot;starting mechanism&quot; for more general hierarchy, by placing many in the giver&#x27;s debt. This leads to the question, &quot;when does reciprocity give way to redistribution.&quot; Sahlins argues that chiefly redistribution is not different in principle and nothing but a highly organized form of kinship-rank reciprocity.

===Reciprocity in market-based societies===

David Graeber argues, in contrast, that balanced gift exchange and market exchange have more in common than normally assumed. Since both are balanced, the social relationship created through the sense of debt and obligation is constantly in danger of being ended by the return gift/exchange. He thinks it better to contrast &quot;&quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot;&quot; reciprocity. Open reciprocity &quot;keeps no accounts because it implies a relation of permanent mutual commitment.&quot; This open reciprocity is closed off precisely when it is balanced. Throught this method, we can see the relationship as a matter of degree, more or less open or closed. Closed reciprocity of gifts is most like market exchange. It is competitive, individualistic and may border on barter.

== Reciprocity and marital alliance ==
The alliance theory (or general theory of exchanges) is the name given to the structural method of studying kinship relations. It finds its origins in Claude Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elementary Structures of Kinship&quot; (1949). According to Levi-Strauss, the universal prohibition of incest pushes human groups towards exogamy where certain categories of kin are forbidden to marry. The incest taboo is thus a negative prescription; without it, nothing would push men to go searching for women outside of their inner kinship circle, or vice versa. In a process akin to the division of labour which makes exchange necessary, one&#x27;s daughter or sister is offered to someone outside a family circle, and starts a circle of exchange of women: in return, the giver is entitled to a woman from the other&#x27;s intimate kinship group. Thus the negative prescriptions of the prohibition have positive counterparts. The idea of the alliance theory is thus of a reciprocal or a generalized exchange which founds affinity, just as economic exchange due to the division of labour resulted in organic solidarity. This global phenomenon takes the form of a &quot;circulation of women&quot; which links together the various social groups in one whole: society. Lévi-Strauss emphasizes this as a system of generalized exchange based on indirect reciprocity. A generalized system does not involve a direct or balanced dyadic exchange and hence presupposes an expansion of trust.

== Reciprocity in the aspect of Cultural Anthropology ==
In Cultural Anthropology, Reciprocity can be characterized as an exchange with the expectation to receive. The individuals who give and individuals who receive are connected to each other in durable relationships, and thus expectations are generated. Power dynamics are distributed amongst individuals of varying hierarchical degrees to convey the significance of the gifts exchanged. There is an importance placed on the value of gifts given to those of greater hierarchical statuses, and formalities are taken into account.

Contrary to the generalizing assumption of reciprocity (where a return is expected), altruistic behavior(prosocial) occurs when there is no expectation of a return. Altruistic behavior is shaped by internal processes and situations that enable individuals to make decisions in a prosocial manner. Altruism may also be employed to manipulate situations, presenting deceptive behaviors where the giver&#x27;s true intention is self-interest and hidden motives.

Reciprocity emerges as a significant subject considering both kinship ties and broader societal interactions, exploring the various approaches to reciprocating acts of kindness.

<text>In photography, reciprocity is the inverse relationship between the intensity and duration of light that determines the reaction of light-sensitive material. Within a normal exposure range for film stock, for example, the reciprocity law states that the film response will be determined by the total exposure, defined as intensity × time. Therefore, the same response (for example, the optical density of the developed film) can result from reducing duration and increasing light intensity, and vice versa.

The reciprocal relationship is assumed in most sensitometry, for example when measuring a Hurter and Driffield curve (optical density versus logarithm of total exposure) for a photographic emulsion. Total exposure of the film or sensor, the product of focal-plane illuminance times exposure time, is measured in lux seconds.

==History==

The idea of reciprocity, once known as Bunsen–Roscoe reciprocity, originated from the work of Robert Bunsen and Henry Roscoe in 1862.

Deviations from the reciprocity law were reported by Captain William de Wiveleslie Abney in 1893,
and extensively studied by Karl Schwarzschild in 1899. Schwarzschild&#x27;s model was found wanting by Abney and by Englisch, and better models have been proposed in subsequent decades of the early twentieth century. In 1913, Kron formulated an equation to describe the effect in terms of curves of constant density, which J. Halm adopted and modified, leading to the &quot;Kron–Halm catenary equation&quot; 
or &quot;Kron–Halm–Webb formula&quot; 
to describe departures from reciprocity.

==In chemical photography==

In photography, &quot;reciprocity&quot; refers to the relationship whereby the total light energy – proportional to the total exposure, the product of the light intensity and exposure time, controlled by aperture and shutter speed, respectively – determines the effect of the light on the film. That is, an increase of brightness by a certain factor is exactly compensated by a decrease of exposure time by the same factor, and vice versa. In other words, there is under normal circumstances a reciprocal proportion between aperture area and shutter speed for a given photographic result, with a wider aperture requiring a faster shutter speed for the same effect. For example, an EV of 10 may be achieved with an aperture (f-number) of 2.8 and a shutter speed of 1/125 s. The same exposure is achieved by doubling the aperture area to 2 and halving the exposure time to 1/250 s, or by halving the aperture area to 4 and doubling the exposure time to 1/60 s; in each case the response of the film is expected to be the same.

==Reciprocity failure==

For most photographic materials, reciprocity is valid with good accuracy over a range of values of exposure duration, but becomes increasingly inaccurate as this range is departed from: this is reciprocity failure (reciprocity law failure, or the Schwarzschild effect). As the light level decreases out of the reciprocity range, the increase in duration, and hence of total exposure, required to produce an equivalent response becomes higher than the formula states; for instance, at half of the light required for a normal exposure, the duration must be more than doubled for the same result. Multipliers used to correct for this effect are called &quot;reciprocity factors&quot; (see model below).

At very low light levels, film is less responsive. Light can be considered to be a stream of discrete photons, and a light-sensitive emulsion is composed of discrete light-sensitive grains, usually silver halide crystals. Each grain must absorb a certain number of photons in order for the light-driven reaction to occur and the latent image to form. In particular, if the surface of the silver halide crystal has a cluster of approximately four or more reduced silver atoms, resulting from absorption of a sufficient number of photons (usually a few dozen photons are required), it is rendered developable. At low light levels, &quot;i.e.&quot; few photons per unit time, photons impinge upon each grain relatively infrequently; if the four photons required arrive over a long enough interval, the partial change due to the first one or two is not stable enough to survive before enough photons arrive to make a permanent latent image center.

This breakdown in the usual tradeoff between aperture and shutter speed is known as reciprocity failure. Each different film type has a different response at low light levels. Some films are very susceptible to reciprocity failure, and others much less so. Some films that are very light sensitive at normal illumination levels and normal exposure times lose much of their sensitivity at low light levels, becoming effectively &quot;slow&quot; films for long exposures. Conversely some films that are &quot;slow&quot; under normal exposure duration retain their light sensitivity better at low light levels.

For example, for a given film, if a light meter indicates a required EV of 5 and the photographer sets the aperture to f/11, then ordinarily a 4-second exposure would be required; a reciprocity correction factor of 1.5 would require the exposure to be extended to 6 seconds for the same result. Reciprocity failure generally becomes significant at exposures of longer than about 1 sec for film, and above 30 sec for paper.

Reciprocity also breaks down at extremely high levels of illumination with very short exposures. This is a concern for scientific and technical photography, but rarely to general photographers, as exposures significantly shorter than a millisecond are only required for subjects such as explosions and in particle physics, or when taking high-speed motion pictures with very high shutter speeds (1/10,000 sec or faster).

== Schwarzschild law ==

In response to astronomical observations of low intensity reciprocity failure, Karl Schwarzschild wrote (circa 1900): 
: &quot;In determinations of stellar brightness by the photographic method I have recently been able to confirm once more the existence of such deviations, and to follow them up in a quantitative way, and to express them in the following rule, which should replace the law of reciprocity: Sources of light of different intensity &quot;I&quot; cause the same degree of blackening under different exposures &quot;t&quot; if the products formula_1 are equal.&quot;

Unfortunately, Schwarzschild&#x27;s empirically determined &quot;0.86&quot; coefficient turned out to be of limited usefulness.
A modern formulation of Schwarzschild&#x27;s law is given as

:formula_2

where &quot;E&quot; is a measure of the &quot;effect of the exposure&quot; that leads to changes in the opacity of the photosensitive material (in the same degree that an equal value of exposure &quot;H = It&quot; does in the reciprocity region), &quot;I&quot; is illuminance, &quot;t&quot; is exposure duration and &quot;p&quot; is the &quot;Schwarzschild coefficient&quot;.

However, a constant value for &quot;p&quot; remains elusive, and has not replaced the need for more realistic models or empirical sensitometric data in critical applications. When reciprocity holds, Schwarzschild&#x27;s law uses &quot;p&quot; = 1.0.

Since the Schwarzschild&#x27;s law formula gives unreasonable values for times in the region where reciprocity holds, a modified formula has been found that fits better across a wider range of exposure times. The modification is in terms of a factor the multiplies the ISO film speed:

:Relative film speed formula_3

where the &quot;t&quot; + 1 term implies a breakpoint near 1 second separating the region where reciprocity holds from the region where it fails.

===Simple model for &quot;t&quot; &gt; 1 second===
Some models of microscope use automatic electronic models for reciprocity failure compensation, generally of a form for correct time, &quot;Tc&quot;, expressible as a power law of metered time, &quot;Tm&quot;, that is, &quot;Tc=(Tm)p&quot;, for times in seconds. Typical values of &quot;p&quot; are 1.25 to 1.45, but some are low as 1.1 and high as 1.8.

==The Kron–Halm catenary equation==

Kron&#x27;s equation as modified by Halm states that the response of the film is a function of formula_4, with the factor defined by a catenary (hyperbolic cosine) equation accounting for reciprocity failure at both very high and very low intensities:

:formula_5

where &quot;I&quot;0 is the photographic material&#x27;s optimum intensity level and &quot;a&quot; is a constant that characterizes the material&#x27;s reciprocity failure.

==Quantum reciprocity-failure model==

Modern models of reciprocity failure incorporate an exponential function, as opposed to power law, dependence on time or intensity at long exposure times or low intensities, based on the distribution of &quot;interquantic times&quot; (times between photon absorptions in a grain) and the temperature-dependent &quot;lifetimes&quot; of the intermediate states of the partially exposed grains.

Baines and Bomback 
explain the &quot;low intensity inefficiency&quot; this way:
==Astrophotography==

Reciprocity failure is an important effect in the field of film-based astrophotography. Deep-sky objects such as galaxies and nebulae are often so faint that they are not visible to the un-aided eye. To make matters worse, many objects&#x27; spectra do not line up with the film emulsion&#x27;s sensitivity curves. Many of these targets are small and require long focal lengths, which can push the focal ratio far above 5. Combined, these parameters make these targets extremely difficult to capture with film; exposures from 30 minutes to well over an hour are typical. As a typical example, capturing an image of the Andromeda Galaxy at 4 will take about 30 minutes; to get the same density at 8 would require an exposure of about 200 minutes.

When a telescope is tracking an object, every minute is difficult; therefore, reciprocity failure is one of the biggest motivations for astronomers to switch to digital imaging. Electronic image sensors have their own limitation at long exposure time and low illuminance levels, not usually referred to as reciprocity failure, namely noise from dark current, but this effect can be controlled by cooling the sensor.

==Holography==

A similar problem exists in holography. The total energy required when exposing holographic film using a continuous wave laser (i.e. for several seconds) is significantly less than the total energy required when exposing holographic film using a pulsed laser (i.e. around 20–40 nanoseconds) due to a reciprocity failure. It can also be caused by very long or very short exposures with a continuous wave laser. To try to offset the reduced brightness of the film due to reciprocity failure, a method called latensification can be used. This is usually done directly after the holographic exposure and using an incoherent light source (such as a 25–40 W light bulb). Exposing the holographic film to the light for a few seconds can increase the brightness of the hologram by an order of magnitude.

<doc id="1046251" wikidata="Q366380" url="?curid=1046251" title="Allan Kaprow">
<text>Allan Kaprow (August 23, 1927 – April 5, 2006) was an American performance artist, installation artist, painter, and assemblagist . He helped to develop the &quot;Environment&quot; and &quot;Happening&quot; in the late 1950s and 1960s, as well as their theory. His Happenings — some 200 of them — evolved over the years. Eventually Kaprow shifted his practice into what he called &quot;Activities&quot;, intimately scaled pieces for one or several players, devoted to the study of normal human activity in a way congruent to ordinary life. Fluxus, performance art, and installation art were, in turn, influenced by his work.

==Academic career==

=== Studies===
Because of a chronic illness Kaprow was forced to move from New York to Tucson, Arizona. He began his early education in Tucson where he attended boarding school.
Later he would attend the High School of Music and Art in New York where his fellow students were the artists Wolf Kahn, Rachel Rosenthal and the future New York gallerist Virginia Zabriskie.
As an undergraduate at New York University, Kaprow was influenced by John Dewey&#x27;s book &quot;Art as Experience&quot;. He studied in the arts and philosophy as a graduate student. He received his MA degree from Columbia University in art history. He started in the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts in 1947. It was here that he started with a style of action painting, which greatly influenced his Happenings pieces in years to come. He went on to study composition with John Cage in his class at the New School for Social Research, painting with Hans Hofmann, and art history with Meyer Schapiro. Kaprow started his studio career as a painter, and later co-founded the Hansa and Reuben Galleries in New York and became the director of the Judson Gallery. With John Cage&#x27;s influence, he became less and less focused on the product of painting, and instead on the action.

===Teaching===
Kaprow began teaching at Rutgers University in 1953. While there, he helped to create what would eventually become one branch of the Fluxus group, along with professors Robert Watts, Geoffrey Hendricks and Roy Lichtenstein, artists George Brecht and George Segal, and undergraduates Lucas Samaras and Robert Whitman. Through a long teaching career, he taught at Rutgers until 1961, Pratt Institute from 1960 to 1961, the State University of New York at Stony Brook from 1961 to 1966, and the California Institute of the Arts from 1966 to 1974, before serving as a full-time faculty member at the University of California, San Diego, where he taught from 1974 to 1993.

==Happenings==

In 1958, Kaprow published the essay &quot;The Legacy of Jackson Pollock&quot;. In it he demands a &quot;concrete art&quot; made of everyday materials such as &quot;paint, chairs, food, electric and neon lights, smoke, water, old socks, a dog, movies.&quot; In this particular text, he uses the term &quot;happening&quot; for the first time stating that craftsmanship and permanence should be forgotten and perishable materials should be used in art.

The &quot;Happenings&quot; first started as tightly scripted events, in which the audience and performers followed cues to experience the art. To Kaprow, a Happening was &quot;A game, an adventure, a number of activities engaged in by participants for the sake of playing.&quot; Furthermore, Kaprow says that the Happenings were &quot;events that, put simply, happen.&quot; There was no structured beginning, middle, or end, and there was no distinction or hierarchy between artist and viewer. It was the viewer&#x27;s reaction that decided the art piece, making each Happening a unique experience that cannot be replicated. It is participatory and interactive, with the goal of tearing down the wall a.k.a. &quot;the fourth wall&quot; between artist and observers, so observers are not just &quot;reading&quot; the piece, but also interacting with it, becoming part of the art.

One such work, titled &quot;Eighteen Happenings in Six Parts&quot;, involved an audience moving together to experience elements such as a band playing toy instruments, a woman squeezing an orange, and painters painting. His work evolved, and became less scripted and incorporated more everyday activities. Another example of a Happening he created involved bringing people into a room containing a large abundance of ice cubes, which they had to touch, causing them to melt and bringing the piece full circle.

Kaprow&#x27;s most famous happenings began around 1961 to 1962, when he would take students or friends out to a specific site to perform a small action. He gained significant attention in September 1962 for his &quot;Words&quot; performance at the Smolin Gallery. However, the ritualistic nature of his happenings is nowhere better illustrated than in &quot;Eat&quot; (1964), which took place in a cave with irregular floors criss-crossed with puddles and streams. As Canadian playwright Gary Botting described it, &quot;The &#x27;visitors&#x27; entered through an old door, and walked down a dark, narrow corridor and up steps to a platform illuminated by an ordinary light bulb. Girls offered red and white wine to each visitor. Apples and bunches of bananas dangled from the ceiling and a girl fried banana fritters on a hotplate. In a small cave, entered only by climbing a ladder, a performer cut, salted and distributed boiled potatoes. In a log hut, bread and jam were served. Bread was stuffed between the logs. The visitors could eat and drink at random for an hour. There was no dialogue other than that used in the interaction of the visitors with the performers.&quot; Botting noted that &quot;Eat&quot; appealed to all the senses and superadded to that was the rhythmic, repeated ticking of metronomes set at the pace of a human heartbeat, simulating ritualistic drumming. Furthermore, &quot;The &#x27;visitors&#x27; were involved physically (by being required to walk, eat, drink, etc.), mentally (by being required to follow directions), emotionally (by the darkness and strangeness of the interior of the cave), and mystically (by the &#x27;mystery&#x27; of what is beyond the walls of the hut or in the inner cave.&quot; In short, Kaprow developed techniques to prompt a creative response from the audience, encouraging audience members to make their own connections between ideas and events. In his own words, &quot;And the work itself, the action, the kind of participation, was as remote from anything artistic as the site was.&quot; He rarely recorded his Happenings which made them a one time occurrence.

At the 1971 International Design Conference at Aspen, Kaprow directed a happening called &quot;Tag&quot; on the Aspen Highlands ski lift which focused on one of the conference themes: &quot;the technological revolution&quot;. Using five video cameras and monitors, he recorded people riding the ski lift and again as they watched themselves riding the ski lift on the monitors.

Kaprow&#x27;s work attempts to integrate art and life. Through Happenings, the separation between life, art, artist, and audience becomes blurred. The &quot;Happening&quot; allows the artist to experiment with body motion, recorded sounds, written and spoken texts, and even smells. One of his earliest &quot;Happenings&quot; was the &quot;Happenings in the New York Scene,&quot; written in 1961 as the form was developing. Kaprow calls them unconventional theater pieces, even if they are rejected by &quot;devotees&quot; of theater because of their visual arts origins. These &quot;Happenings&quot; use disposable elements like cardboard or cans making it cheaper on Kaprow to be able to change up his art piece every time. The minute those elements break down, he can get more disposable materials together and produce another improvisational master piece. He points out that their presentations in lofts, stores, and basements widens the concept of theater by destroying the barrier between audience and play and &quot;demonstrating the organic connection between art and its environment.&quot; There have been recreations of his pieces, such as &quot;Overflow&quot;, a tribute to the original 1967 &quot;FLUIDS&quot; Happening.

In 1973 Allan Kaprow performed with Jannis Kounellis, Wolf Vostell, Robert Filliou, and Mario Merz in Berlin at the &quot;ADA - Aktionen der Avantgarde&quot;.

In 2014 This Is Not A Theatre Company restaged two of Allan Kaprow&#x27;s Happenings in New York City as part of the exhibit &quot;Allen Kaprow. Other Ways&quot; at the Fundacio Antoni Tapies in Barcelona: &quot;Toothbrushing Piece&quot; (&quot;performed privately with friends&quot;), and &quot;Pose&quot; (&quot;Carrying chairs through the city. Sitting down here and there. Photographed. Pix left on the spot. Going on&quot;).

He published extensively and was Professor Emeritus in the Visual Arts Department of the University of California, San Diego. Kaprow is also known for the idea of &quot;un-art&quot;, found in his essays &quot;Art Which Can&#x27;t Be Art&quot; and &quot;The Education of the Un-Artist.&quot;

Many well-known artists, for example, Claes Oldenburg, cite him as an influence on their work.

==Published works==
&quot;Assemblage, Environments and Happenings&quot; (1966) presented the work of like-minded artists through both photographs and critical essays, and is a standard text in the field of performance art. Kaprow&#x27;s &quot;Essays on the Blurring of Art and Life&quot; (1993), a collection of pieces written over four decades, has made his theories about the practice of art in the present day available to a new generation of artists and critics.
==Recognition==
In 2013, Dale Eisinger of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;Yard&quot; (1961) sixth in his list of the greatest performance art works, writing, &quot;His first happenings engaged the audience in overwhelming, often playful ways. &quot;Yard&quot; is perhaps the most significant of these early works&quot;.

<doc id="1046255" wikidata="Q2462287" url="?curid=1046255" title="Twin Lakes (Alaska)">
<text>Twin Lakes is a complex of two large lakes in Lake Clark National Park in the U.S. state of Alaska, near the northeast corner of Lake and Peninsula Borough. It contains a upper lake and a smaller lower lake, joined by a short connecting stream. The lakes outflow westward into the Chilikadrotna River (and eventually into the Mulchatna and Nushagak Rivers and Nushagak Bay). It is quite remote and unpopulated, except in the late summer as it is a popular hunting spot.

The lake complex was the retirement home of naturalist Richard Proenneke (1916–2003), who spent most (1968–1998) of the last 35 years of his life living there in a log cabin he built by hand. (See &quot;One Man&#x27;s Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Alone in the Wilderness&quot;). It is only reachable by air taxi via a float or a wheel plane.

<doc id="1046257" wikidata="Q696766" url="?curid=1046257" title="Sagara Sanosuke">
<text>is a fictional character from the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; manga and anime series created by Nobuhiro Watsuki. In the English anime adaptations he is known as Sanosuke Sagara and nicknamed Sano. Watsuki, being a fan of the Shinsengumi, created Sanosuke by basing his name and characteristics on that of a real Shinsengumi member named Harada Sanosuke.

Set during a fictional version of Japan in the pre-Meiji period, Sanosuke is a former member of the Sekihō Army. When the group is destroyed by the Meiji Government, he becomes a fighter-for-hire to calm his anger by fighting. During his introduction in the series, he encounters the wanderer Himura Kenshin, who easily defeats him and is able to convince him to stop his mercenary work and instead start protecting people. After that encounter, Sanosuke becomes Kenshin&#x27;s best friend as well as his partner in most of their fights.

Sanosuke appears in the featured films of the series and in other media relating to the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; franchise, including a plethora of electronic games and original video animations (OVAs). Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Sanosuke&#x27;s character. Mania Entertainment praised his character development, noting that he becomes more trustworthy and reliable as the series progresses. SciFi.com referred to him as a &quot;video-game icon&quot;, and noted how he is portrayed as a &quot;tragic figure&quot;. Sanosuke has been popular with the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; reader base, placing second in every popularity poll. Merchandise based on Sanosuke has also been released, including key chains, and plush dolls.

== Creation and conception ==
Sanosuke was one of the last major figures of the series to be created. Watsuki created him to be Kenshin&#x27;s best friend, who is willing to punch him when he is sad to make him &quot;wake up&quot; from his sadness. Although Sanosuke is a main character in the series, Watsuki felt that he could not write everything he wanted about him, and thought that making him the title character of a series would prove interesting.

The character is based on Shinsengumi member Harada Sanosuke. Watsuki describes Sanosuke&#x27;s visual motif by referring to his design model, Lamp, the main character of Susumu Sendo and Takeshi Obata&#x27;s &quot;Mashin Bōken Tan Lamp-Lamp&quot;. Watsuki, working as an assistant on Obata&#x27;s manga, formed the character by doodling in sketchbooks, adding and subtracting elements from the proposed character &quot;with blessings from the original artist, of course.&quot; An elder Sanosuke was drafted by Watsuki to appear in the manga&#x27;s finale but this idea was scrapped. In the manga&#x27;s final story arc, the design was used for Sanosuke&#x27;s father, Higashidani Kamishimoemon.
In July 2006, the Japanese publishers of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; released the &quot;kanzenban&quot; edition. In the fifth &quot;kanzenban&quot;, Watsuki redesigned the character of Sanosuke in a draft version. To emphasize his hate of the Meiji Government, Watsuki drew the Japanese kanji for on the back of Sanosuke&#x27;s jacket in the original series, but on the kanzenban redesign, the tattoo is located inside his clothes. Unlike in the manga where Sanosuke uses an oversized zanbatō as a weapon, Watsuki gave him a more historically authentic zanbatō; a sword notably thinner and longer in design. He also gave him an armor-like cloth to make him look more as a warrior.

The fact that the CD book voice actors, especially Tomokazu Seki and Megumi Ogata, who portrayed Sanosuke and Kenshin in the CD books, respectively, did not get their corresponding roles in the anime disappointed Watsuki. Ueda, Sanosuke&#x27;s voice actor in the Japanese anime, commented that voicing Sanosuke in the original video animations was very complicated because his character was notably older and he has not acted in the role for a long period. He also said that he would have liked to see more fights involving Sanosuke in the original video animations, but was happy to see that Sanosuke had matured as a character. Lex Lang, the voice actor of Sanosuke in the English adaptation of the anime, commented that his first impression of Sanosuke was as a fight-driven character motivated by anger, but as the story continued Sanosuke became friendly and more likable. Because his voice is noticeably different from Ueda&#x27;s, Lang tries to create his own interpretation of Sanosuke&#x27;s character. Lang has noted that the scene in episode 22 of the anime, in which Sanosuke is afraid of a train because he believes it is a demon, was the most enjoyable scene for him to record; he added &quot;I recently saw it and had some big laughs.&quot;

In producing the English dub version of the series, Media Blasters chose Lex Lang as Sanosuke&#x27;s voice actor. When writing Sanosuke&#x27;s dialogue, Clark Cheng, the writer of the English dub script, noted that the character was smarter than he would have liked in the first few episodes, so Cheng tried slowly to change the character&#x27;s dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent so he would be more similar to the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series.

== Appearances ==

=== In &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; ===
Born February 1860 in Nagano, Sanosuke is a former member of the Sekihō Army. Having admired his captain Sagara Sōzō, he takes the family name Sagara from him. But when the revolutionary government encounters financial problems, it labels the Sekihō Army as frauds in order to &quot;bury their promises&quot;. Sōzō is executed, leaving Sanosuke as one of the few survivors. Consumed with hatred for the Ishin Shishi, and guilt at not being able to protect his hero, Sanosuke becomes a fight merchant in Tokyo. Over the next ten years, he gains a reputation as one of the strongest hired fighters of the city. The destruction of the Sekihō Army and the loss of all his friends has caused Sanosuke to hate the Meiji Government and he wears the Japanese kanji for &quot;evil&quot; on the back of his jacket. He bears this symbol as a mark of his loyalty towards his past in the Sekihō Army. Sanosuke uses an enormous zanbatō in battle, giving him the moniker . The blade has no edge and Sanosuke only uses it to smash and crush his opponents.
In his introduction in the manga, Sanosuke is hired to fight Kenshin, but after the former assassin defeats him, he learns of the truth of Kenshin&#x27;s no-kill approach and becomes one of his allies. After Kenshin defeats him and breaks his zanbatō, Sanosuke decides to focus on unarmed combat. When the criminal Shishio Makoto tries to conquer Japan, Sanosuke helps Kenshin in the fight against him. While on his trip to Kyoto to aid him, Sanosuke was trained in kenpo from a warrior monk named Yūkyūzan Anji. Anji taught Sanosuke a secret technique called . &quot;Futae no Kiwami&quot; is a special art in which the user performs two hits in quick succession with any part of his body. The first hit with the proximal interphalangeal joint neutralizes the hardness of the target, then the second blow, struck with the proximal phalanx, breaks the target before it recovers from the force of the first blow. Using his mastery from this art with his right hand allows him to defeat the third most powerful opponent in Shishio&#x27;s army: Anji.

Months later, in an act of revenge on Kenshin, Yukishiro Enishi fakes Kamiya Kaoru&#x27;s death. Kenshin loses the will to live and when Sanosuke is unable to reach him, he wanders away from Tokyo. In his wandering, he is reunited with his family in the Shinano Province (Shinshū). Years prior to the start of the series, Sanosuke left the family at the age of 9 to join the Sekihō Army. Although he does not reveal his identity to his family, upon learning of their poor situation Sanosuke attacks a former Ishin Shishi who was mistreating them and the town. During these fights, Sanosuke&#x27;s right hand is permanently damaged from the overuse &quot;Futae no Kiwami&quot;. and overcomes this disability when he discovers using both hands in succession which lessens the impact to his damaged hand. After protecting his family, he returns to Tokyo to rescue Kaoru with his friends. After a successful rescue, Sanosuke leaves Japan and travels the world to avoid being arrested for attacking the Ishin Shishi. The manga ends with a letter from Sanosuke to his friends that he is returning to Japan to be reunited with them.

=== In other media ===
In the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Motion Picture&quot;, Sanosuke helps to stop the samurai Takimi Shigure from overthrowing the Meiji Government as an act of revenge. In the original video animations of the series, he is given a more humanized design and a more emotional personality. In the non-canon &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Reflection&quot;, an older Sanosuke discovers Kenshin gravely injured when he is traveling in Asia and sends Kenshin back to Tokyo by himself, contradicting his character development by his creator, Watsuki. Sanosuke is also a playable character in almost all the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; video games except &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; and &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;, in which he isn&#x27;t playable but is available as a Battle koma.

In &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration&quot;, Sanosuke is hired by Takeda Kanryu to kill Kenshin but he only wishes to fight Kenshin. After losing to Kenshin, Sanosuke agrees to help him with taking care of Kaoru&#x27;s dojo.

In the live-action film series adapting &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, Sanosuke is portrayed by Munetaka Aoki.

== Reception ==
Among the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; reader base Sanosuke has been popular, having ranked second in every &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; popularity poll of the series and also ranked fifth in the &quot;Kenshin&#x27;s Biggest Rival&quot; poll featuring all of Kenshin&#x27;s opponents. Merchandise based on Sanosuke has been released, including sweat bands, keychains, and plush dolls.

Several anime and manga publications have provided both praise and criticism of Sanosuke&#x27;s character. Anime News Network said that Sanosuke&#x27;s first fight in the series against Kenshin was stereotypical for an action series due to the differences between Sanosuke&#x27;s and Kenshin&#x27;s personalities, and to the music used in the anime that gives the impression that Kenshin would win. In the&quot; Critical Survey of Graphic Novels: Manga&quot;, multiple writers acknowledged how both Sanosuke and Yahiko spend their time in the series searching for ways to become stronger. However, they do it for a heroic reason which is assisting Kenshin. SciFi.com commended him for being a good source of comic relief and described his appearance as a video-game icon. However, they commented he was a &quot;tragic figure whose goofy peccadilloes have solid reasons behind them&quot; due to being unable to avoid the destruction of the Sekihotai army and feeling guilty due to it. Mania Entertainment praised Sanosuke&#x27;s character development and transformation from an enemy of Kenshin into one of his most stalwart friends. Chris Beveridge appreciated the fight scenes from &quot;Restoration&quot; due to how Sanosuke is presented stronger than in the original manga, making his duel with Kenshin more enjoyable. In the &quot;Samurai X: Reflection&quot; original video animation, Mike Crandol of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; referred to Sanosuke&#x27;s revised design as &quot;pretty awkward&quot; since Crandol felt Sanosuke&#x27;s original character design was &quot;perhaps being too cartoonish to translate well into this new style,&quot; with the &quot;new style&quot; being the &quot;decidedly more realistic look&quot; exhibited in all of the &quot;Samurai X&quot; original video animations.

Sanosuke&#x27;s role in the live-action films has also been the subject of commentary by writers. Munetaka Aoki&#x27;s acting was praised by Ko Ransom from Anime News Network, finding it faithful to the original character. Nick Creamer from the same site also noted how in the first live-action film, Sanosuke&#x27;s characterization was identical to the original series as he is initially an enemy to Kenshin but later becomes his friend. On the other hand, Creamer criticized Sanosuke&#x27;s portrayal in the second film as he stated that he &quot;tends to chew the scenery in his appearances&quot; to the point he found him less realistic. For the liveaction film &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Legend Ends&quot;, David West from &quot;Neo&quot; enjoyed Sanosuke&#x27;s fight against Anji but felt it was too similar to his fight against the Christian priest from the first film.

<text>A cruise line is a company that operates cruise ships that operate on ocean or rivers and which markets cruises to the public. Cruise lines are distinct from passenger lines which are primarily concerned with transportation of passengers. Though cruise packages provided by cruise lines vary, there are some features most have in common, such as accommodation, all meals and entertainment. They may include alcohol and shore excursions, sometimes on additional payment.

Among cruise lines, some are direct descendants of the traditional passenger lines, while others were founded since the 1960s specifically for cruising. The business has been extremely volatile; the ships are massive capital expenditures with very high operating costs, and a slight dip in bookings can easily put a company out of business. Cruise lines frequently sell, renovate, or simply rename their ships to keep up with travel trends.

A wave of failures and consolidations in the 1990s has led to many companies being bought by much larger holding companies and to operate as &quot;brands&quot; within larger corporations. Brands exist partly because of repeat customer loyalty, and also to offer different levels of quality and service. For instance, Carnival Corporation &amp; plc owns both Carnival Cruise Line, whose former image were vessels that had a reputation as &quot;party ships&quot; for younger travellers, but have become large, modern, yet still profitable, and Holland America Line, whose ships cultivate an image of classic elegance.

A common practice in the cruise industry in listing cruise ship transfers and orders is to list the smaller operating company, not the larger holding corporation, as the recipient cruise line of the sale, transfer, or new order. For example, Carnival Cruise Line and Holland America Line are the cruise lines whereas Carnival Corporation &amp; plc and Royal Caribbean Group are considered holding corporations. This industry practice of using the brand, not the larger holding corporation, as the cruise line is also followed in the member cruise lines in Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) and the member-based reviews of cruise lines.

<text>A cruise line is a company that operates cruise ships and markets cruises to the public. Cruise lines are distinct from passenger lines which are primarily concerned with transportation of their passengers. Cruise lines have a dual character; they are partly in the transportation business, and partly in the leisure entertainment business, a duality that carries down into the ships themselves, which have both a crew headed by the ship&#x27;s captain, and a hospitality staff headed by the equivalent of a hotel manager.

Because of mergers and consolidations, a cruise line may also be a brand of a larger holding corporation. For example, as noted below, Carnival Cruise Line and Holland America Line are cruise lines within the larger parent corporation Carnival Corporation &amp; plc. This industry practice of using the brand, not the larger parent corporation, as the cruise line is also followed in the member cruise lines in Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA); the listing of cruise ship sales, transfers, and new orders; cruise line market share; and the member-based reviews of cruise lines.

Cruise ships can cruise in oceans or rivers. The listing of cruise lines below includes separate lists for both areas. Cruise lines operating ocean and river ships can be found in both lists.

== List of cruise lines by size ==
, the cruise industry was estimated to be around 23.8 billion with 13.9 million passengers per year. The following is a list of the largest cruise lines with over 1,000 passengers per year and their market share by passengers and revenue as of 2021 according to &quot;Cruise Market Watch&quot;. The list also includes the combined market share of each of the cruise line holding companies: Carnival Corporation &amp; plc, Royal Caribbean Group, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, TUI Group, and Genting Hong Kong.

<doc id="1046278" wikidata="Q5238895" url="?curid=1046278" title="David Ramsay (Ontario politician)">
<text>David James Ramsay (April 23, 1948 – July 29, 2020) was a Canadian politician in Ontario. He was elected as a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1985 who crossed the floor a year later to join the Liberal party. He represented the northern Ontario riding of Timiskaming from 1985 to 1999 and the redistributed riding of Timiskaming—Cochrane from 1999 to 2011. He served as a cabinet minister in the governments of David Peterson and Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Born in Australia, Ramsay moved to Canada with his parents at age one after having been adopted in Sydney, and was raised in Oakville, Ontario. He attended Concordia University in Montreal, and after graduation worked as a farmer in New Liskeard and a clerk-treasurer in Casey Township, in northern Ontario. He later served as president of the Timiskaming Federation of Agriculture in 1984-85, was a founding member of the Timiskaming Grain Growers Board, and served as chair of the Timiskaming Hospital Board for a time. Ramsay died in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on July 29, 2020, at the age of 72.

==Political career==

===Election as a New Democrat===
In the 1985 provincial election he ran as the New Democrat candidate in the northern Ontario riding of Timiskaming. He defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Ed Havrot by almost 3000 votes, as the once-powerful Tory machine in northern Ontario began to lose its support base. He served as a critic of Small Business, Financial Institutions, and Agriculture and Food.

===Becoming a Liberal===
On 6 October 1986, Ramsay crossed the floor to join the governing Liberals, claiming that Northern Ontario needed greater representation in government. (Ramsay also seems to have disliked the Toronto leadership of the NDP, describing it as out of touch with his rural/populist base.)

Despite an intense effort by the NDP to defeat Ramsay in the 1987 election, he won re-election by over 4,000 votes. On 29 September 1987, Ramsay was appointed to David Peterson&#x27;s cabinet as Minister of Correctional Services. Following a cabinet shuffle on 2 August 1989, he was named Minister of Agriculture and Food. Ramsay kept his seat in the 1990 election that defeated the Liberal government and brought Ramsay&#x27;s former party, the NDP, to power under Bob Rae.

He ran for the leadership of the Liberal Party in the 1992 Liberal leadership convention, but placed last in a field of six candidates. Like fellow candidate Greg Sorbara, his campaign included both right-wing and left-wing elements. He supported tax reduction (including lower gasoline taxes, a reduction in the Provincial Sales Tax and a one-year moratorium on the federal Goods and Services Tax), and favoured open Sunday shopping and allowing corner stores to sell beer and wine. He also supported pay equity measures, and described himself as pro-choice on abortion.

In the provincial elections of 1995 and 1999, Ramsay&#x27;s primary opposition came not from the New Democrats but the Progressive Conservatives, whose leader Mike Harris represented a neighbouring riding. He won by a clear margin on both occasions. In 1996, he endorsed Dwight Duncan&#x27;s bid to lead the Ontario Liberal Party.

Ramsay served as caucus chair from 1993 to 1994 and again from 1999 to 2003.

With the victory of the Liberals under the leadership of Dalton McGuinty in the 2003 election, Ramsay returned to cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources on 23 October 2003. He was also given responsibility for Aboriginal Affairs on 29 June 2005. In June 2007, Ramsay was appointed Ontario&#x27;s first Minister of Aboriginal Affairs.

In the 2007 provincial election, Ramsay won by 634 votes over NDP candidate John Vanthof. Ramsay expected to continue as a minister but was dropped from cabinet. Instead he was appointed as McGuinty&#x27;s Parliamentary Assistant.

In January 2011 he said that he was retiring from politics and would not run in the 2011 election.

<doc id="1046283" wikidata="Q1333017" url="?curid=1046283" title="Saeko Chiba">
<text>is a Japanese voice actress and singer. She grew up in Tokyo and married in 2007. She is contracted to the Space Craft Produce.

== Biography ==
Chiba took up ballet at a young age with ambitions of becoming part of Takarazuka Revue. However, having failed the entrance exam for Takarazuka Music School in her third year of middle-school, she joined the a stage group for teenage girls.

Having had several lead roles over the three years she spent with the troupe, Saeko was then cast in the lead voice acting role of Kotori Haruno in the Dreamcast game &quot;Kita e&quot;. Having had a taste of being a voice actress and deciding that she preferred voice acting to performing on stage, Saeko decided to pursue the career full-time. Some of her earlier roles are her voice acting debut as Tsubaki Sakura in &quot;Kare Kano&quot;, Kitsune no Akane in &quot;Angel Tales&quot;, and Elliot Chapman in &quot;Sci-Fi Harry&quot;. Saeko was famed for her long, straight, black hair and seemingly cold outward appearance which led to her being cast in various tsundere and &#x27;cool-girl&#x27; roles. She then cut her hair short in the spring of 2005, which strangely coincided with the increasing diversity of her roles, as Saeko herself noted on the &quot;My-HiME&quot; fandisc interview. Saeko has pursued a singing career with Yuki Kajiura, who wrote music for some of the Nanshō stage shows, writing and producing almost all her material. Her first single was &quot;Koi no Kiseki&quot;, the theme song for the PlayStation game &quot;Meguri Aishite&quot;. She has since released nine singles and two albums, along with various character song and drama CDs. She has also performed theme songs for games such as &quot;Alundra 2&quot; and &quot;Atelier Judie&quot;. Saeko was also part of the group tiaraway with fellow Nanshō member Yuuka Nanri. Originally recording and performing as &#x27;Saeko Chiba &amp; Yuuka Nanri&#x27; for &quot;Memories Off 2nd&quot;, the duo released three singles and an album before breaking up on March 6, 2005.

On February 17, 2011, Saeko gave birth to her first child, a daughter.

<text>Quillaia is the milled inner bark or small stems and branches of the soapbark (&quot;Quillaja saponaria&quot;). Other names include &quot;Murillo bark extract&quot;, &quot;Panama bark extract&quot;, &quot;Quillaia extract&quot;, &quot;Quillay bark extract&quot;, &quot;Soapbark extract&quot;, and . Quillaia contains high concentrations of saponins that can be increased further by processing. Highly purified saponins from quillaia are used as adjuvants to enhance the effectiveness of vaccines. Other compounds in the crude extract include tannins and other polyphenols, and calcium oxalate.

Quillaia is used in the manufacture of food additives. The extract also is used as a humectant in baked goods, frozen dairy products, and puddings and as a foaming agent in soft drinks. It is used in agriculture for some &quot;natural&quot; spray adjuvant formulations.

==Saponin adjuvants==
The saponins from &quot;Quillaja saponaria&quot; are used in several approved veterinary vaccines (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease vaccines). Initially a crude preparation was used, but more recently purified products have been developed. Two of these (&quot;Quil A&quot; and &quot;Matrix-M&quot;) have been shown to be more effective and cause less local irritation.

&quot;Quil A&quot; is still a mixture of more than 25 different saponin molecules. One of them, the saponin QS21, has been investigated for as an adjuvant for human vaccines.

Novavax uses a highly purified quillaja extract as an adjuvant in its veterinary and human vaccines. The adjuvant, &quot;Matrix-M&quot;, is made at facilities in Sweden and Denmark.

The college&#x27;s founder and first president, Samuel Stanhope Smith, was born in Pequea, Pennsylvania. He graduated as a valedictorian from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1769, and he went on to study theology and philosophy under John Witherspoon, whose daughter he married on June 28, 1775. In his mid-twenties, working as a missionary in Virginia, Smith persuaded the Hanover Presbytery to found a school east of the Blue Ridge, which he referred to in his advertisement of September 1, 1775, as &quot;an Academy in Prince Edward...distinguished by the Name of HAMPDEN–SIDNEY&quot;. The school, not then named, was always intended to be a college-level institution; later, in the same advertisement, Smith explicitly modeled its curriculum on that of the College of New Jersey. &quot;Academy&quot; was a technical term used for college-level schools not run by the established church.
As the college history indicates on its website, &quot;The first president, at the suggestion of Dr. John Witherspoon, the Scottish president of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), chose the name Hampden–Sydney to symbolize devotion to the principles of representative government and full civil and religious freedom which John Hampden (1594–1643) and Algernon Sydney (1622–1683) had outspokenly supported, and for which they had given their lives, in England&#x27;s two great constitutional crises of the previous century. They were widely invoked as hero-martyrs by American colonial patriots, and their names immediately associated the College with the cause of independence championed by James Madison, Patrick Henry, and other less well-known but equally vigorous patriots who composed the College&#x27;s first Board of Trustees.&quot;

Classes at Hampden–Sydney began in temporary wooden structures on November 10, 1775, on the eve of American Independence, moving into its three-story brick building early in 1776. The college has been in continuous operation since that date, operating under the British, Confederate, and United States flags. Classes have only been canceled seven times: for a Civil War skirmish on campus, for a hurricane that knocked a tree into a dormitory building, twice due to snowstorms, once for an outbreak of norovirus, briefly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and once for an ice storm in 2021, leaving the campus without power. Since the college was founded before the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, it was eligible for an official coat of arms and armorial bearings from the College of Arms of the Royal Household of the United Kingdom. Through gifts from the F. M. Kirby Foundation, Professor John Brinkley (&#x27;59), in whose honor the &quot;achievement of arms&quot; was given, liaised with Mr. John Brooke-Little, then the Richmond Herald, in designing the arms for the college. The Latin text of the &quot;letters patent&quot; conferring the arms is dated July 4, 1976; Mr. Brooke-Little—who, with the Queen&#x27;s special permission, appeared in full herald&#x27;s uniform—made the presentation on Yorktown Day, October 19, 1976, at the college.

Despite the problematic and financially strapped first years resulting from the Revolutionary War, the college survived with sufficient viability to be granted a charter by the Virginia General Assembly in 1783—the oldest private charter in the Southern United States. Patrick Henry, then Governor of Virginia, encouraged the passage of the charter and wrote into it an oath of allegiance to the new republic required of all professors.

Alumni of Princeton University founded the college. Patrick Henry, who did not attend college, and James Madison, a Princeton alumnus, were elected trustees in the founding period before classes began. Smith hired his brother, John Blair Smith, and two other recent Princeton graduates to teach. Samuel Stanhope Smith would later become president of Princeton University. John Blair Smith would become the second president of Hampden–Sydney and later the first president of Union College.

=== 19th century ===
Hampden–Sydney became a thriving college while located in southside Virginia, which led to expansion. In 1812, the Union Theological Seminary was founded at Hampden–Sydney College. The seminary was later moved to Richmond, Virginia and is currently the Union Presbyterian Seminary. In 1838, the medical department of Hampden–Sydney College was founded—the Medical College of Virginia, which is now the MCV Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. Among the early nineteenth-century leaders were John Holt Rice, who founded the seminary, Jonathan P. Cushing, and Reverend James Marsh. In those years, the intellectual culture at HSC spanned from leading southern, anti-slavery writers like Jesse Burton Harrison and Lucian Minor to leading proslavery writers, such as George A. Baxter and Landon Garland. During this time, the college constructed new buildings using Federal-style architecture with Georgian accents. This is the style of architecture still used on the campus.

At the onset of the American Civil War, Hampden–Sydney students formed a company in the Virginia Militia. The Hampden–Sydney students did not see much action but rather were &quot;captured, and...paroled by General George B. McClellan on the condition that they return to their studies&quot;.

=== 20th century ===
&quot;Fame has come suddenly to Hampden-Sydney College,&quot; began a 1931 New York Times article titled, &quot;Hampden-Sydney&#x27;s High Scholastic Rank Achieved With Old-Fashioned Teaching.&quot; The article highlighted a study showing that of all U.S. colleges and universities, Hampden-Sydney had the highest percentage of living graduates listed in Who&#x27;s Who.

During World War II, Hampden–Sydney College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a commission. Under the Victory ship program, the SS &quot;Hampden-Sydney Victory&quot; was built at Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard in Baltimore, Maryland; her keel was laid down on 30 May 1945, and she was launched on 14 July 1945, and delivered for service on 22 August 1945. Brought into service too late to aid in the war effort she was built for, &quot;Hampden-Sydney Victory&quot; nonetheless served with the U.S. Merchant Marine until she was sold to the Republic of Turkey on 24 November 1947 . 

The college has hosted a wide array of noteworthy musicians. Bruce Springsteen, the Temptations, Ben E. King, The Platters, The Lettermen, Dionne Warwick, the Allman Brothers, Dave Matthews Band, Widespread Panic, Bruce Hornsby, Pretty Lights, and Government Mule were among the popular visitors to Hampden–Sydney throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. But for tragic reasons, the most significant concert occurred on October 14, 1967, featuring the superstar duet of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. During their performance, 22-year-old Terrell collapsed into Gaye&#x27;s arms. Terrell would later be diagnosed with a brain tumor and had eight unsuccessful surgeries before she died on March 16, 1970, at the age of 24.

On May 11, 1964, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy visited Hampden–Sydney College to speak with students, and U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush is said to have given the 1985 commencement address.

=== 21st century ===
As of 2020, Hampden-Sydney had expanded its academic offerings to include more than 50 majors and minors, with recent additions including majors in engineering physics and biochemistry and molecular biology.

In 2017 the college added a new student center and renovated an existing facility to create a state-of-the-art center for the arts. A center for entrepreneurship and innovation was also launched in 2017. In recent years the campus has also added a high ropes course featuring a vertical climbing wall, suspended ropes obstacles, and zip line.

In 2018, the college&#x27;s Wilson Center for Leadership in the Public Interest launched a four-year leadership development program, with 47 first-year students in the inaugural cohort. The center and program are named for the late Lieutenant General Samuel V. Wilson, a former Hampden-Sydney president who &quot;combined the savvy of a spymaster with the grit of a hardened combat veteran,&quot; according to a 2017 &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary.

2019 saw the launch of a new experiential learning program called Compass, which requires students to complete at least three experiential learning courses from options including internships, study abroad, research, service learning, and hands-on classroom experiences. A $6 million gift from Cindy and Rob Citrone (class of 1987) was dedicated to supporting the Compass program. That same year, the college also received the donation of $30 Million from the Pauley Family Foundation. These funds were used to construct the Pauley Science Center which replaced the section of the grounds previously host to Bagby Hall. The sightline from Venable hall to Cushing hall was restored, an intentional design element dating to the 1820s which was previously blocked by Bagby Hall.

In August 2020, the college completed a new 147-bed residential complex called the Grove. Footpaths and a central courtyard link the lodge-like, apartment-style residence halls. A neighboring community lodge overlooks Lake Chalgrove and features indoor and outdoor fireplaces and grilling space.

Construction began in 2020 on the new, 73,000-square-foot Pauley Science Center. The Pauley Science Center debuted in the fall semester of 2022, with its dedication on November 11, 2024

=== Name ===
Under the influence of his mentor and father-in-law Witherspoon, Smith named the college for two English champions of liberty, John Hampden (1594–1643) and Algernon Sydney (1622–1683). Hampden lost his life in the battle of Chalgrove Field during the English Civil War. Sydney, who wrote &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot;, was beheaded by order of Charles II following his (unproven) implication in a failed attempt to overthrow the king.

===Presidents===
The following is a list of the Presidents of Hampden–Sydney College from its opening in 1775 until the present.
==Academics==
Hampden–Sydney enrolls approximately 1,000 students from 30 states and several foreign countries and emphasizes a rigorous, traditional liberal arts curriculum.

===Rankings===

* &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Hampden–Sydney #98 in its 2022 rankings of the top &quot;National Liberal Arts Colleges&quot;.
* &quot;Forbes&quot; awarded Hampden–Sydney with an &quot;A&quot; grade in its &quot;2016 Forbes College Financial Grades&quot;; an evaluation methodology designed to &quot;measure the fiscal soundness of nearly 900 four-year, private, not-for-profit colleges with at least 500 students&quot;.
* The Princeton Review ranked Hampden–Sydney #2 in its 2020 rankings of &quot;Best Alumni Network&quot;. The Princeton Review also ranked Hampden-Sydney&#x27;s Bortz Library #5 in its 2020 rankings of &quot;Best College Library&quot;. In addition, the Princeton Review ranked Hampden-Sydney #14 in its 2020 rankings of &quot;Best Schools for Internships&quot;.

=== Honor Code === 
In addition to Wabash College and Morehouse College, Hampden–Sydney is one of only three remaining traditional all-male colleges in the United States and was noted in a 1999 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article as exemplary. Many identify with the school&#x27;s mission of forming good men, rigorous students, and American citizens. The honor code reflects these values.

=== Western Culture Program ===

All Hampden–Sydney students must take two semesters of Western culture as part of a three-course Core Cultures sequence. In addition to the Western Culture courses, which introduce them to some of the great works and historical events from Greece and Rome through present times, students take at least one Global Cultures course, which compares hierarchical structures, cultural frameworks, and regional and global networks from the beginning of human history to the present. Western Culture has been described as &quot;the bedrock of Hampden–Sydney&#x27;s liberal arts program and one of the most important of its core academic requirements.&quot; The Core Cultures program draws on professors from all disciplines.

=== Rhetoric Program ===
The Rhetoric Program is based on a 1978 faculty resolution that states: &quot;All Hampden-Sydney graduates will write and speak competently.&quot; Every student must prepare for and pass the Proficiency Exam, which consists of a three-hour essay that is graded for grammatical correctness and the coherence, quality, and style of the argument.

While the program was formalized in 1978, the emphasis on rhetoric dates back to the college&#x27;s founding. In a September 1775 advertisement in the &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot;, founding president Samuel S. Smith wrote, &quot;The system of Education will resemble that which is adopted in the College of New Jersey; save, that a more particular Attention shall be paid to the Cultivation of the English Language than is usually done in Places of public Education.&quot;

==Campus==
The college expanded from its original small cluster of buildings on to a campus of over . Before 2006, the college owned . In February 2006, the college purchased which includes a lake and Slate Hill Plantation, the historic location of the college&#x27;s founding. The campus is host to numerous federal-style buildings. Part of the campus has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.

==Student life==

===Culture===

Given that it is older than the United States and one of just a handful of colleges for men, Hampden–Sydney College has a distinctive culture that values tradition. When they arrive on campus, freshmen are issued a copy of &quot;To Manner Born, To Manners Bred: A Hip-pocket Guide to Etiquette for the Hampden–Sydney Man&quot;, which covers basic manners, how to greet and introduce people, how to navigate job interviews, how to respond to invitations, how to dress for various occasions (such as the difference between a black-tie and white-tie event), how to pair wine with food, etc. The college publishes the book as a useful tool for existing successfully in a variety of social settings. &quot;To Manner Born&quot; has been highlighted in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and on the CBS &quot;Late Show&quot; with Stephen Colbert, who attended Hampden-Sydney in the 1980s.

Tailgating before football games is central to Hampden–Sydney&#x27;s social culture each fall, and the college&#x27;s tailgate scene has been featured in &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; and &quot;Southern Living&quot;, which ranked Hampden-Sydney as one of the top-20 best tailgates in the Southern United States, alongside large schools like Ole Miss and Alabama.

Many students are passionate outdoorsmen, and &quot;Field &amp; Stream&quot; has called Hampden-Sydney a &quot;hidden gem for outdoorsmen&quot; in a list of &quot;21 of the Best Colleges for Hunters and Anglers,&quot; where the college ranked #7.

===Clubs and organizations===

There are more than 50 clubs on campus, each run by students. There are political clubs, sports clubs, religious clubs, a student-run radio station, a pep band, and multiple social fraternities. There are also volunteer groups such as Habitat for Humanity and Rotaract.

The 100-year-old student newspaper, &quot;The Hampden-Sydney Tiger&quot;, has produced many prominent journalists, including Jonathan Martin of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Chris Stirewalt of Fox News, Charles Hurt of the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, Matthew Karnitschnig, the chief Europe correspondent for &quot;Politico&quot; and a Pulitzer Prize finalist, and Matthew Phillips of CNN, who was previously an editor for &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; and &quot;Freakonomics&quot;.

The college campus is home to a volunteer fire department, which provides fire suppression service and non-transport basic life support EMS to Prince Edward County and the college, as well as assisting the Farmville fire department at fires within the town limits. HSVFD, Company 2, is located on the southern end of campus near the water tower and the physical plant. Since the departments incorporation in 1982 it has not been affiliated with the college, despite the fact a majority of active members are college faculty, staff, or students.

Union-Philanthropic Literary Society (UPLS) is the oldest student organization at Hampden–Sydney College. Established on September 22, 1789, UPLS is the nation&#x27;s oldest literary and debating society, still in existence today without interruption.

===Greek life===
Internal sources claim that roughly 47% of the student body is involved in Greek life. Beta Theta Pi used Atkinson Hall (built 1834) as a fraternity house when it came to campus in 1850, possibly making it one of the first fraternity houses in North America.

==Athletics==
Hampden–Sydney athletic teams are the Tigers. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) since the 1976–77 academic year.

Hampden–Sydney competes in ten intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, and distance track. The Tigers have rugby as a club sport.
Hampden–Sydney&#x27;s rivalry with Randolph–Macon College is one of the longest-running college rivalries in the United States. &quot;The Game&quot; is often referred to as the oldest small-school football rivalry in the Southern United States, with the first match up having been played in 1893. Athletic events involving the two schools are fiercely competitive, and the week prior to &quot;The Game&quot; between Hampden–Sydney and Randolph–Macon is known as &quot;Beat Macon Week&quot;.

Several Hampden–Sydney athletes have gone on to successful coaching careers, including Russell Turner, the head coach of the UC Irvine men&#x27;s basketball team, and Ryan Odom, who led the #16 seed UMBC Retrievers to a historic upset over #1 seed University of Virginia in the 2018 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament. Ryan Silverfield, an alumnus and former student-assistant with the Hampden–Sydney football program, was named head football coach at the University of Memphis just before the 2019 Cotton Bowl Classic after previously serving as an assistant with the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings.

<doc id="1046292" wikidata="Q326648" url="?curid=1046292" title="Salmonellosis">
<text>Salmonellosis is a symptomatic infection caused by bacteria of the &quot;Salmonella&quot; type. It is the most common disease to be known as food poisoning (though the name refers to food-borne illness in general), these are defined as diseases, usually either infectious or toxic in nature, caused
by agents that enter the body through the ingestion of food. In humans, the most common symptoms are diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, and vomiting. Symptoms typically occur between 12 hours and 36 hours after exposure, and last from two to seven days. Occasionally more significant disease can result in dehydration. The old, young, and others with a weakened immune system are more likely to develop severe disease. Specific types of &quot;Salmonella&quot; can result in typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever. Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are specific types of salmonellosis, known collectively as enteric fever, and are, respectively, caused by salmonella typhi and paratyphi bacteria, which are only found in humans. Most commonly, salmonellosis cases arise from salmonella bacteria from animals, and chicken is a major source for these infections.
There are two species of &quot;Salmonella&quot;: &quot;Salmonella bongori&quot; and &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; with many subspecies. However, subgroups and serovars within a species may be substantially different in their ability to cause disease. This suggests that epidemiologic classification of organisms at the subspecies level may improve management of &quot;Salmonella&quot; and similar pathogens.

Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian populations are susceptible to &quot;Salmonella&quot; infections due to the consumption of contaminated meat and milk.
Infection is usually spread by consuming contaminated meat, eggs, water or milk. Other foods may spread the disease if they have come into contact with manure. A number of pets including cats, dogs, and reptiles can also carry and spread the infection. Diagnosis is by a stool test or blood tests.
Efforts to prevent the disease include the proper washing, preparation, and cooking of food to appropriate temperature. Mild disease typically does not require specific treatment. More significant cases may require treatment of electrolyte problems and intravenous fluid replacement. In those at high risk or in whom the disease has spread outside the intestines, antibiotics are recommended.

Salmonellosis is one of the most common causes of diarrhea globally. In 2015, 90,300 deaths occurred from nontyphoidal salmonellosis, and 178,000 deaths from typhoidal salmonellosis. In the United States, about 1.35 million cases and 450 deaths occur from non-typhoidal salmonellosis a year. In Europe, it is the second most common foodborne disease after campylobacteriosis.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Enteritis===

After a short incubation period of a few hours to one day, the bacteria multiply in the small intestine, causing an intestinal inflammation (enteritis). Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. Diarrhea is often watery and non-bloody but may be mucoid and bloody. In most cases, the illness lasts four to seven days, and does not require treatment. In some cases, though, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient becomes dangerously dehydrated and must be hospitalized. At the hospital, the patient may receive fluids intravenously to treat the dehydration, and may be given medications to provide symptomatic relief, such as fever reduction. In severe cases, the &quot;Salmonella&quot; infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites, and can cause death, unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.

In otherwise healthy adults, the symptoms can be mild. Normally, no sepsis occurs, but it can occur exceptionally as a complication in the immunocompromised. However, in people at risk such as infants, small children, and the elderly, &quot;Salmonella&quot; infections can become very serious, leading to complications. In infants, dehydration can cause a state of severe toxicity. Extraintestinal localizations are possible, especially &quot;Salmonella&quot; meningitis in children, osteitis, etc. Children with sickle-cell anemia who are infected with &quot;Salmonella&quot; may develop osteomyelitis. Treatment of osteomyelitis, in this case, will be to use fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, etc., and nalidixic acid).

Those whose only symptom is diarrhea usually completely recover, but their bowel habits may not return to normal for several months.

===Typhoid fever===

Typhoid fever occurs when &quot;Salmonella&quot; bacteria enter the lymphatic system and cause a systemic form of salmonellosis. Endotoxins first act on the vascular and nervous apparatus, resulting in increased permeability and decreased tone of the vessels, upset thermal regulation, vomiting, and diarrhea. In severe forms of the disease, enough liquid and electrolytes are lost to upset the fluid balance, cause an electrolyte imbalance, decrease the circulating blood volume and arterial pressure, and cause hypovolemic shock. Septic shock may also develop. Shock of mixed character (with signs of both hypovolemic and septic shock) are more common in severe salmonellosis. Oliguria and azotemia develop in severe cases as a result of renal involvement due to hypoxia and toxemia.

===Long-term===
Salmonellosis is associated with later irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Evidence however does not support it being a direct cause of the latter.

A small number of people afflicted with salmonellosis experience reactive arthritis, which can last months or years and can lead to chronic arthritis. In sickle-cell anemia, osteomyelitis due to &quot;Salmonella&quot; infection is much more common than in the general population. Though &quot;Salmonella&quot; infection is frequently the cause of osteomyelitis in people with sickle-cell, it is not the most common cause, which is &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; infection.

Those infected may become asymptomatic carriers, but this is relatively uncommon, with shedding observed in only 0.2 to 0.6% of cases after a year.

== Causes ==

* Contaminated food, often having no unusual look or smell
* Poor kitchen hygiene, especially problematic in institutional kitchens and restaurants because this can lead to a significant outbreak
* Excretions from either sick or infected but apparently clinically healthy people and animals (especially dangerous are caregivers and animals)
* Polluted surface water and standing water (such as in shower hoses or unused water dispensers)
* Unhygienically thawed poultry (the meltwater contains many bacteria)
* An association with reptiles (pet tortoises, snakes, iguanas, and aquatic turtles) is well described.
* Amphibians such as frogs

&quot;Salmonella&quot; bacteria can survive for some time without a host; they are frequently found in polluted water, with contamination from the excrement of carrier animals being particularly important.

The European Food Safety Authority highly recommends that when handling raw turkey meat, consumers and people involved in the food supply chain should pay attention to personal and food hygiene.

An estimated 142,000 Americans are infected each year with &quot;Salmonella&quot; Enteritidis from chicken eggs, and about 30 die. The shell of the egg may be contaminated with &quot;Salmonella&quot; by feces or environment, or its interior (yolk) may be contaminated by penetration of the bacteria through the porous shell or from a hen whose infected ovaries contaminate the egg during egg formation.

Nevertheless, such interior egg yolk contamination is theoretically unlikely. Even under natural conditions, the rate of infection was very small (0.6% in a study of naturally contaminated eggs and 3.0% among artificially and heavily infected hens).

== Prevention ==

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has published guidelines to help reduce the chance of food-borne salmonellosis. Food must be cooked to , and liquids such as soups or gravies should be boiled when reheating. Freezing kills some &quot;Salmonella&quot;, but it is not sufficient to reliably reduce them below infectious levels. While &quot;Salmonella&quot; is usually heat-sensitive, it acquires heat-resistance in high-fat environments such as peanut butter.

=== Vaccine ===
Antibodies against nontyphoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; were first found in Malawi children in research published in 2008. The Malawian researchers identified an antibody that protects children against bacterial infections of the blood caused by nontyphoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot;. A study at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Blantyre found that children up to two years old develop antibodies that aid in killing the bacteria. This could lead to a possible &quot;Salmonella&quot; vaccine for humans.

A 2014 study tested a vaccine on chickens which offered efficient protection against salmonellosis.

Vaccination of chickens against &quot;Salmonella&quot; essentially wiped out the disease in the United Kingdom. A similar approach was considered in the United States, but the Food and Drug Administration decided not to mandate vaccination of hens.

==Treatment==
Electrolytes may be replenished with oral rehydration supplements (typically containing salts sodium chloride and potassium chloride).

Appropriate antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, may be given to kill the bacteria, but are not necessary in most cases. Azithromycin has been suggested to be better at treating typhoid in resistant populations than both fluoroquinolone drugs and ceftriaxone. There are recommendations on choice of antibiotic to avoid promoting antibiotic resistance.

There is no evidence of benefit of treating healthy people with diarrhea due to non-typhoidal salmonellosis. However, the evidence for the very young, very old or people with severe diseases are uncertain.

== Epidemiology ==

=== United States ===
Salmonellosis annually causes, per CDC estimation, about 1.35 million illnesses, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the United States every year. About 142,000 people in the United States are infected each year with &quot;Salmonella&quot; Enteritidis specifically from chicken eggs, and about 30 die.

In 2010, an analysis of death certificates in the United States identified a total of 1,316 &quot;Salmonella&quot;-related deaths from 1990 to 2006. These were predominantly among older adults and those who were immunocompromised. The U.S. government reported as many as 20% of all chickens were contaminated with &quot;Salmonella&quot; in the late 1990s, and 16.3% were contaminated in 2005.

The United States has struggled to control salmonella infections, with the rate of infection rising from 2001 to 2011. In 1998, the USDA moved to close plants if salmonella was found in excess of 20 percent, which was the industry&#x27;s average at the time, for three consecutive tests. Texas-based Supreme Beef Processors, Inc. sued on the argument that Salmonella is naturally occurring and ultimately prevailed when a federal appeals court affirmed a lower court. These issues were highlighted in a proposed Kevin&#x27;s Law (formally proposed as the Meat and Poultry Pathogen Reduction and Enforcement Act of 2003), of which components were included the Food Safety Modernization Act passed in 2011, but that law applies only to the FDA and not the USDA. The USDA proposed a regulatory initiative in 2011 to Office of Management and Budget.

&quot;Salmonella&quot; is found in 8% of the chicken parts tested by the USDA and 25% of ground chicken.

=== Europe ===
An outbreak of salmonellosis started in Northern Europe in July 2012, caused by &quot;Salmonella thompson&quot;. The infections were linked to smoked salmon from the manufacturer Foppen, where the contamination had occurred. Most infections were reported in the Netherlands; over 1060 infections with this subspecies and four fatalities were confirmed.

A case of widespread infection was detected mid-2012 in seven EU countries. Over 400 people had been infected with &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; serovar Stanley (&quot;S&quot;. Stanley) that usually appears in the regions of Southeast Asia. After several DNA analyses seemed to point to a specific Belgian strain, the &quot;Joint ECDC/E FSA Rapid Risk Assessment&quot; report detected turkey production as the source of infection.

In Germany, food poisoning infections must be reported. Between 1990 and 2005, the number of officially recorded cases decreased from about 200,000 to about 50,000.

=== Elsewhere ===
In March 2007, around 150 people were diagnosed with salmonellosis after eating tainted food at a governor&#x27;s reception in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. Over 1,500 people attended the ball on March 1 and fell ill as a consequence of ingesting &quot;Salmonella&quot;-tainted sandwiches.

In Singapore about 150 people fell sick after eating &quot;Salmonella&quot;-tainted chocolate cake produced by a major bakery chain in December 2007.

South Africa reported contamination of its poultry carcasses by &quot;Salmonella&quot;. Egypt showed that &quot;Salmonella&quot; was predominant in poultry along with other non-typhoid strains. In Indonesia, the isolation of &quot;Salmonella&quot; Typhi was the main focus, while other serovars were also included from poultry. In India, &quot;Salmonella&quot; was predominant in poultry. Romania reported &quot;Salmonella&quot; serovars in poultry that affect humans.

== History ==
Both salmonellosis and the microorganism genus &quot;Salmonella&quot; derive their names from a modern Latin coining after Daniel E. Salmon (1850–1914), an American veterinary surgeon. He had help from Theobald Smith, and together they found the bacterium in pigs.

Salmonella enterica was possibly the cause of the 1576 &quot;cocliztli&quot; epidemic in New Spain.

=== Four-inch regulation ===
The &quot;Four-inch regulation&quot; or &quot;Four-inch law&quot; is a colloquial name for a regulation issued by the U.S. FDA in 1975, restricting the sale of turtles with a carapace length less than four inches (10 cm).

The regulation was introduced, according to the FDA, &quot;because of the public health impact of turtle-associated salmonellosis&quot;. Cases had been reported of young children placing small turtles in their mouths, which led to the size-based restriction.

=== Regulation elsewhere ===
=== FSSAI regulation ===
The FSSAI has been established under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which is a consolidating statute related to food safety and regulation in India. FSSAI is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the regulation and supervision of food safety.
The major importance of the FSSAI License is that it ensures that the food is verified chemically and hence is safe to consume. &#x27;Health before wealth&#x27; is a common quote as well as fact. Therefore, anything related directly to health is a matter of great sensitivity.

== Research ==

=== Bacteriophage treatment ===
Therapy with phages or bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) has been proposed as a treatment for &quot;Salmonella&quot; infections. Bacteriophages have a number of advantages over other alternatives: (i) high efficacy in killing bacteria, (ii) minimal or no side effects, (iii) no allergic effects, (iv) production is rapid and inexpensive, and (v) they are host-specific and therefore do not affect the intestinal microbiota or other saprophytic bacteria in the environmental milieu.

The use of bacteriophages is effective in the prevention and treatment of bacterial pathogens in animals. In the specific case of poultry, good results have been obtained by reducing the infection of &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Campylobacter&quot;. Until now, the use of phage therapy to control &quot;Salmonella&quot; in poultry could reduce, but not completely eliminate bacterial colonisation.

Bacteriophages are suitable to prevent or reduce the colonization of pathogenic bacteria and therefore diseases in cattle, where phages are supplied either individually or in cocktail to farm animals, the routes and methods of application were examined by various authors and the application of phages through oral tube feeding or feed intake showed a reduction of pathogenic bacteria without affecting the intestinal microbiota of the host. Current research is focused on improved phage delivery in a manner that avoids decreasing phage titer due to destabilization or inactivation by gastric pH extremes.

== Immunological parameters of infection ==

From an immunological point of view Salmonellosis is an infection caused by gram-negative bacteria infiltrating epithelial cells of the small intestine in the distal ileum whereby inducing acute inflammatory response called enteritis. Salmonella can infect M-cells population overlying the Payer’s patches in the intestine, cells located in lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa and other epithelial cells. After infecting cells in Peyer&#x27;s patches, Salmonella can move to the mesenteric lymph nodes. This happens because lymphatic vessels are responsible for draining fluids, cells, and microbes from the intestinal tissues and carrying them to these lymph nodes. This process requires migration dependent on a factor known as CCR7. Once in the mesenteric lymph nodes, Salmonella can then enter the bloodstream, leading to a systemic infection that spreads throughout the body. 
Virulence of the Salmonella is given by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI-1). This needle-like structure, formed by a set of proteins, is known as the Type III secretion system. It enables Salmonella to effectively invade neighboring cells by injecting bacterial proteins directly into them, facilitating its spread and evasion of the host&#x27;s immune defenses.
The first cells recruited to the Salmonella infection site are neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Neutrophils play a key role in early defense against Salmonella, preventing its spread into the bloodstream. Studies in mice have shown that without neutrophils, there&#x27;s an increase in the extracellular bacterial load during Salmonella infection. Moreover, these cells are essential for producing IFN-γ in the intestinal mucosa, which is crucial for controlling Salmonella Typhimurium through an IFN-γ-dependent mechanism. Several other pro-inflammatory cytokines have been also observed after the infection of the epithelia such as IL-1α, TNFα, IL-12, IL-18 and IL-15, affecting the body-temperature by inducing fever, increase mucus production, activation of B and T leukocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages recruitment to the site of infection. Resident macrophages can also recognize flagellin and activate NLRC4 inflammasome complex to activate caspase-1 and IL-1β and IL-18 release. Recruited monocytes are specifically adapted to regulating bacterial replication through the production of antimicrobial molecules (anti-microbial factors such as iNOS, TNF-α and IL-1β), however, they exhibit limited capability as antigen-presenting cells. While monocytes help in containing the bacteria initially, the inability to effectively present antigens can delay or weaken the activation of T cells, which are necessary for a strong and specific immune response. In contrast, dendritic cells experience maturation through both direct pathways, mediated by bacteria, and indirect pathways, facilitated by cytokines in vivo, enhancing their ability to present antigens optimally. In a study focusing on the interaction between dendritic cells and intestinal epithelial cells, it was observed that when intestinal epithelial cells are stimulated by flagellin (a component of bacterial flagella, like those found in Salmonella), they trigger a specific response. This response involves the release of a molecule called CCL20. CCL20 is known to attract DCs, a type of immune cell. As a result, dendritic cells migrate towards the site of flagellin stimulation in the intestines. Recruitment of these cells to follicles plays a crucial role in initiating early T-cells mediated responses to Salmonella infection. 
T–cell activation is limited to the draining mesenteric lymph nodes within 9–12 h since the initial infection as in any other lymph node activated T-cells specific to Salmonella were not detected.
Protective immunity against Salmonella appears to be primarily mediated by CD4+ T cells. This is evident in mice lacking a thymus, αβ T cells, MHC class-II, or T-bet+ Th1 cells, as they demonstrate an inability to resolve the infection. Clearly Th1 response is crucial in response and clearance of Salmonella infection since mice depleted from T-bet or IFN-γ are unable to combat Salmonellosis. The presence of different cytokines in combination with cytokines produced from Th1 cells however suggests additional effect of Th17 response. IL-22 and IL-17 are contributing to protection against Salmonella by its mucosal production and antimicrobial peptides expression (IL-22) as well regulation of mucosal host defense and neutrophil recruitment (IL17) demonstrated by IL-17A deficient mice infected with Salmonella.
Conversely, mice lacking B-cells or γδ T cells can successfully clear the primary attenuated Salmonella infection, but a robust B-cell response is essential for resolving virulent Salmonella infections. Different study revealed that B-cells are essential for protective immunity against Salmonella independent of antibody secretion because B-cells unable to secrete antibodies were still protective against Salmonella, suggesting that B-cells can serve as antigen presenting cells in this context and activate T-cells responses. 
Further experiments focused on CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes revealed their crucial role in Salmonella clearance. Depletion of CD8+ T cells resulted in the failure to resolve the infection in mice. These findings strongly suggest that CD4+-mediated protection is facilitated by the contribution of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in the immune response against Salmonella.
The investigation of immune memory revealed robust bacterial clearance facilitated by both CD4+ and CD8+ responses. Interestingly, this memory was not sufficient in adoptive transfer into other mice, despite possessing a potent response. However, when serum transfer was employed, the observed response indicated the crucial antibody-dependent role in secondary Salmonella infections. 
Immunocompromised individuals (for example AIDS, malnutrition or those taking immunosuppressive treatment) are more susceptible to salmonellosis and contribute to bacteremia caused by neutropenia in immunocompromised individuals comparing immunocompetent ones.

Miss Havisham lives as a recluse as if time stopped the moment her heart broke:
&quot;She was dressed in rich materials--satins, and lace, and silks--all white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was white...I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white long ago, and had lost its lustre, and was faded and yellow. I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose, had shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly wax-work at the Fair...Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress, that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement. Now, wax-work and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if I could.&quot;

He was high-shouldered and bony; dressed in decent black, with a white wisp of a neckcloth; buttoned up to the throat; and had a long, lank, skeleton hand, which particularly attracted my attention, as he stood at the pony&#x27;s head, rubbing his chin with it, and looking up at us in the chaise. He had a way of writhing when he wanted to express enthusiasm, which was very ugly&quot; Uriah Heep, wonderfully hideous, is one of Dickens&#x27; greatest triumphs in character creation.

He was dressed in a canvas jacket, and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have stood quite as well alone, without any legs in them. And you couldn&#x27;t so properly have said he wore a hat, as that he was covered in a-top, like an old building, with something pitchy.&quot; in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;

The shape of the letters on my father&#x27;s gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription &quot;Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,&quot; I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly.&quot;

Great Expectations
* Pocket, Herbert the pale young man who fought Pip at Satis House, and becomes his roommate and close friend in London in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. &quot;Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking. I had never seen anyone then, and I have never seen anyone since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich.&quot;

<doc id="1046310" wikidata="Q107404965" url="?curid=1046310" title="History of the judicial system of Iran">
<text>A nationwide judicial system in Iran was first implemented and established by Abdolhossein Teymourtash under Reza Shah, with further changes during the second Pahlavi era.

After the 1979 overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty by the Islamic Revolution, the system was greatly altered. The legal code is now based on Islamic law or sharia, although many aspects of civil law have been retained, and it is integrated into a civil law legal system. According to the constitution of the Islamic Republic, the judiciary in Iran &quot;is an independent power&quot; with a Ministry of Justice, head of the Supreme Court, and also a separate appointed Head of the Judiciary.

==History==

===Islam===

According to one scholar, the administration of justice in Islamic Iran has been until recent times

a loosely sewn and frequently resewn patchwork of conflicting authority in which the different and sometimes conflicting sources for Islamic law—the jurists, the actual judges, and the non-Islamic law officials of the king - disputed with each other over the scope of their jurisdictions. ...
some aspects of the law always remained in the hands of the mullahs ... The village mullah was the natural arbiter in matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance; and the exalted jurisconsult, in order to carry out the very function for which he was exalted, gave opinions on those matters of law on which he was consulted. In between the village mullah and the jurisconsult there were mullahs with courts which, while sometimes sanctioned by the royal government, depended for their power on the prestige of the presiding mullah judge as much or more than on the government&#x27;s sanction
Since the sixteenth century AD Iran has been the only country in the world having Shi&#x27;ah Islam as its official religion, consequently the general principles of its legal system differed somewhat from those of other countries which followed Islamic law.

Among the ways, law in Iran and the rest of the Muslim world differed from European law was in its lack of a single law code. &quot;Thirteen centuries of Islamic—more particularly Shiah—tradition&quot; called for jurists to base decisions on their legal training as it applied to the situation being judged. There was also no appeal in traditional Islamic law.
One jurists&#x27;s &#x27;discovery&#x27; of the ruling of law for a specific case would not have been invalidated by some other jurist&#x27;s discovery of a different ruling for that case; only God could choose between them, and until the Resurrection (or in the case of the Shiah, the return of the Twelfth Imam) God had left the matter to the jurists, and the first actual judgment was final, as otherwise there would have been an infinite regress of opinions without any final judgment. For the Shiah, ... resistance to a single written code was even stronger; the jurisconsult&#x27;s right to describe the law in his own way was the very essence of the doctrine that had revived the jurisconsult school at the end of the 18th century.&quot; 

As far as the judicial system is concerned, the changes were quite minor until the end of the nineteenth century.

===20th century===
Major events marking the judicial history of Iran during the modern era include the Constitutional Revolution of 1906, which gave the country its first Constitution and Bill of Rights, the fall of the Qajars and the rise of the Pahlavi Dynasty in the 1920s, when accession to a modern judicial organisation became one of Iran&#x27;s greatest challenges, and the Islamic Revolution.

====&quot;Regime of capitulations&quot;====
As European military and technological power began to be felt in 19th century Iran, Westerners insisted on special treatment in Iranian courts. This came in the form of treaties between most European governments and Iran requiring the presence at the trial of any European in Iran of a representative of that European&#x27;s home country, who would countersign the decision of the Iranian court, and without whose countersignature the &quot;decision of the Iranian court could have no effect&quot;. The Europeans insisted on this legal veto right—&quot; called the regime of capitulations&quot;—on the grounds that Iran had no written legal code so that &quot;no one knew what laws foreigners would be judged by.&quot; Iran followed the traditional Islamic practice of each judge giving his own interpretation of Islamic law for a given litigation, with no right of appeal.

Iranians in general opposed these capitulations, and secular Iranians such as Mohammed Mossadeq, wanted to establish a fixed written law they believed would not only end the capitulations but facilitate the building of a strong and unified state.

==== Reza Shah ====
Under the secularist reign of Reza Shah many changes were made in Iran&#x27;s judicial system, and the establishment of a fixed written law with appeals courts was one of them. In March 1926, Minister of Judicial Affairs Ali-Akbar Davar dissolved Iran&#x27;s entire judiciary, with the approval of the parliament, and initiating a wave of fundamental restructuring and overhauling reforms with the aid of French judicial experts. By April 1927 Iran had 600 newly appointed judges in Tehran. Davar subsequently attempted to expand the new system into other cities of Iran through a programme involving training of 250 judges.

Reza Shah represented his legal reforms as &quot;tentative experiments&quot; and allowed the religious judges to keep their courts for matters such as inheritance. In 1936, however, the new system was made permanent and the religious courts were abolished. However, there were still sharia courts that ruled on issues of family and inheritance up to the Islamic Revolution (working alongside secular ones). Some aspects of sharia law were also unofficially retained in criminal law, for example compensation was still unofficially given in a similar manner to blood money, in exchange for pardoning a murder death sentence in some cases.

;The legal profession
According to Banakar and Ziaee, the history of the Iranian Bar Association (Kānūn-e Vūkalā-yeh Dādgūstarī) &quot;can be traced back to the period after the 1906 Constitutional Revolution, when a modern legal system was established in Iran. The IBA was founded in 1915 and organised under the supervision of the judicial system until 1953, when it was granted legal personality. It operated as an independent civil society organisation for the next twenty-seven years, until it was closed in 1980 by the revolutionary government and its ranks and files were purged. It was reopened in 1991 under the control of the Head of the Judiciary and regained some of its independence in 1997 when President Khatami […] won the general election. Since then, the numbers of lawyers have grown steadily to an estimated 60,000, and perhaps most significantly a large number of women have passed the Bar and joined the legal profession&quot;. &quot;Since the 1979 Revolution, the IBA has been struggling to maintain its independence from the judiciary. As part of this conflict, a new body of lawyers was created by the Iranian government in 2001 and &#x27;authorized to present cases in court&#x27; under Article 187 of the Law of Third Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan (adopted in May 2000). […] This group, whose membership in 2014 was estimated to exceed 20,000, is officially known as the Legal Advisors of the Judiciary.&quot;

===Islamic Republic===
In 1979 the secular, westernizing Pahlavi Dynasty was overthrown and replaced by an Islamic Republic under the rule of Ayatollah Khomeini. While the revolution did not dismantle the Pahlavi judiciary in its entirety, it replaced secular-trained jurists &quot;with seminary-educated ones, and codified more features of the sharia into state laws—especially the Law of Retribution.&quot; Women judges were also removed (although they could still be lawyers, or after 1997, secondary judges in civil cases).

Between 1979 and 1982, the entire pre-Revolutionary judiciary was purged, and their duties replaced by &quot;Revolutionary Tribunals&quot; set up in every town. These tribunals ruled on &quot;Islamic law&quot;, but were in practice unfair, biased, and the judges were inexperienced and often incompetent. Many people were executed or given harsh punishments for both political and criminal acts. There were no appeals either, and trials often lasted minutes in an un-orthodox &quot;court&quot;. In 1982, the regular court system was reinstated, but with the judges now trained in Islamic law. The Revolutionary Courts became a part of this court system, ruling in matters of &quot;national security&quot; such as drug trafficking and political and &quot;anti-revolutionary&quot; crimes, and were considered the &quot;judicial arm of the regime&quot;. In 1982, in response to military coup threats, a separate &quot;Military Revolutionary Court&quot; was formed, handling military cases. The Retribution Law (&quot;Qisas&quot;) of 1982 replaced sections of the Public Punishment Law (1924).

====Current system====

The 1979 Constitution of the Islamic Republic calls Iran to have a Head of the Judiciary, also known in English as &#x27;Chief Justice of Iran&#x27;, who is to be a &quot;just Mujtahid&quot; (high level Islamic cleric) appointed by the Supreme Leader and to serve for &quot;a period of five years.&quot; He is responsible for the &quot;establishment of the organizational structure&quot; of the judicial system; &quot;drafting judiciary bills&quot; for Parliament; hiring, firing, promoting and assigning judges. Judges cannot be dismissed without a trial.

Iran&#x27;s prison system was &quot;centralized and drastically expanded&quot; by the Islamic Republic. Under the Shah prisons had been administered separately by SAVAK, the urban police, and the gendarmerie. The new regime entrusted their management &quot;to a supervisory council of three clerics&quot;.

The Islamic Republic uses the Shia based Jaafari school of Islamic jurisprudence. After the election of the first Majles of the Islamic Republic in 1980, the Majles and the Guardian Council quickly codified important features of the sharia law by passing two landmark bills in July 1982: Sharia law includes &quot;Hudud&quot; (&quot;claims against God&quot;, punishable by a mandatory, fixed sentence), Qisas (the law of retaliation/retribution), &quot;diyyeh&quot;, or blood money (to compensate for the death/injury), &quot;Qanon-e Ta&#x27;zir&quot; (tazir is a crime that receives a discretionary sentence by a judge), &quot;Qanon-e Qisas&quot; (Retribution Law).

The Supreme Audit Court of Iran regulates banking and financial operations and interest (riba) is forbidden.

In 1991–1994, Iran combined all of these laws into the unified &quot;Islamic Penal Code&quot; which consisted of five &quot;Books&quot;. The new Islamic Penal Code was adopted in January 2012 and incorporates the bulk of penal laws in the IRI, replacing Books One through Four of the old code. Book Five of the Islamic Penal Code (&quot;the only part of the Penal Code that has been adopted permanently and is not subject to experimental periods&quot;) passed on May 22, 1996.

Sharia in the IRI has been modified to some degree, according to one source, the new laws of the Islamic Republic &quot;modify the sharia&quot; (i.e. what Muslims believe is God&#x27;s legislation) &quot;in three significant ways&quot;: allowing the appeal of decisions, the use of circumstantial evidence in cases, and long-term imprisonment as a punishment.

In a 2013 poll by Pew Research Center, 83% of Iranians favored the use of Islamic law. In a question asked only of Iranian Muslims, a plurality (45%) felt that the law already followed Sharia somewhat closely, and a further 37% thought it followed Sharia very closely.

<text>Miskel Spillman (September 8, 1897 – March 30, 1992) was the winner of the only &quot;Anyone Can Host&quot; contest on NBC&#x27;s late-night variety series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and hosted the December 17, 1977, broadcast of the show. An 80-year-old German immigrant and grandmother from New Orleans, Spillman held the record as the oldest host in &quot;SNL&quot;″s history (two weeks older than Ruth Gordon when she hosted on January 22, 1977) for thirty-two years, until it was broken on May 8, 2010, by 88-year-old Betty White. Spillman remains the only non-celebrity to host the program.

== Contest entry in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ==

Entrants to &quot;Saturday Night Live&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Anyone Can Host&quot; contest were asked to write, in 25 words or less, why they should be selected to host the program. Spillman&#x27;s winning entry read: &quot;I&#x27;m 80 years old. I need one more cheap thrill, since my doctor told me I only have another 25 years left.&quot; Her appearance as host (the Season 3 Christmas episode, also featuring Buck Henry) began with a joke involving herself and cast member John Belushi sharing a joint, followed by a marijuana-induced obsession with a bowl of fruit (going so far as to swat away Henry&#x27;s hands whenever he tried to grab the bowl).

After hosting, Spillman remained a fan of the program and stayed up to watch it in her later years, proclaiming herself to particularly enjoy Dana Carvey.

<text>Pamela Suzette Grier (born May 26, 1949) is an American actress, singer, and martial artist. Described by Quentin Tarantino as cinema&#x27;s first female action star, she achieved fame for her starring roles in a string of 1970s action, blaxploitation and women-in-prison films for American International Pictures and New World Pictures. Her accolades include nominations for an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Satellite Award and a Saturn Award.

Grier came to prominence with her titular roles in the films &quot;Coffy&quot; (1973) and &quot;Foxy Brown&quot; (1974); her other major films during this period included &quot;The Big Doll House&quot; (1971), &quot;Women in Cages&quot; (1971), &quot;The Big Bird Cage&quot; (1972), &quot;Black Mama White Mama&quot; (1973), &quot;Scream Blacula Scream&quot; (1973), &quot;The Arena&quot; (1974), &quot;Sheba, Baby&quot; (1975), &quot;Bucktown&quot; (1975) and &quot;Friday Foster&quot; (1975). She portrayed the title character in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s crime film &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; (1997), nearly three decades after her first starring role. Grier also appeared in &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; (1996), &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996), &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; (1999), &quot;Holy Smoke!&quot;, (1999), &quot;Bones&quot; (2001), &quot;Just Wright&quot; (2010), &quot;Larry Crowne&quot; (2011) and &quot;Poms&quot; (2019).

On television, Grier portrayed Eleanor Winthrop in the Showtime comedy-drama series &quot;Linc&#x27;s&quot; (1998–2000), Kate &quot;Kit&quot; Porter on the Showtime drama series &quot;The L Word&quot; (2004–2009), and Constance Terry in the ABC sitcom &quot;Bless This Mess&quot; (2019–2020). She received praise for her work in the animated series &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot; (1999).

In 2016 &quot;IndieWire&quot; named Grier one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

== Early life ==
Grier was born on May 26, 1949, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the daughter of Gwendolyn Sylvia (née Samuels), a homemaker and nurse, and Clarence Ransom Grier Jr., who worked as a mechanic and technical sergeant in the United States Air Force. She has one sister and one brother. Grier said she is of Black, Hispanic, Chinese, Filipino, and Cheyenne heritage. She was raised Catholic and later baptized as a Methodist.

Because of her father&#x27;s military career, the family moved frequently during Grier&#x27;s childhood. In 1956, they moved to Swindon where her father worked on an air force base. By Grier&#x27;s account, hers was one of the only Black families in town, though she recalled that they faced no racism or segregation compared to that in the United States: &quot;They didn&#x27;t care that I was Black since they hadn&#x27;t been raised to hate Blacks. Instead, they&#x27;d been raised to hate Germans... In the U.S., especially in the South, we were never able to get buses to stop for us, we couldn&#x27;t eat in certain restaurants, couldn&#x27;t use certain bathrooms. Up until 1969, there were department stores in which my father and I weren&#x27;t even allowed to try on clothing.&quot;

The family returned to the United States in 1958, when Grier&#x27;s father was transferred to California&#x27;s Travis Air Force Base, eventually settling in Denver, near Lowry Air Force Base. Grier spent part of her upbringing on her maternal grandparents&#x27; sugar beet farm in rural Wyoming, where their ancestors had homesteaded after fleeing west via the Underground Railroad to escape slavery. Grier attended East High School in Denver, and appeared in a number of stage productions, as well as participating in beauty contests to raise money for college tuition at Metropolitan State College.

== Career ==

Grier moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1967, where she was initially hired to work the switchboard at American International Pictures (AIP). She is believed to have been discovered by the director Jack Hill, and was cast in Roger Corman women-in-prison films such as &quot;The Big Doll House&quot; (1971), &quot;Women in Cages&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Big Bird Cage&quot; (1972). While under contract at AIP, she became a staple of early 1970s blaxploitation films, playing bold, assertive women, beginning with Hill&#x27;s &quot;Coffy&quot; (1973), in which she plays a nurse who seeks revenge on drug dealers. Her character was advertised in the trailer as the &quot;baddest one-chick hit-squad that ever hit town!&quot;. The film, which was filled with sexual and violent elements typical of the genre, was a box-office hit. Grier is considered to be the first African-American woman to headline an action film, as protagonists of previous blaxploitation films were men. In his review of &quot;Coffy&quot;, critic Roger Ebert praised the film for its believable female lead. He noted that Grier was an actress of &quot;beautiful face and astonishing form&quot; and that she possessed a kind of &quot;physical life&quot; missing from many other attractive 

Grier played similar characters in the AIP films &quot;Foxy Brown&quot; (1974), &quot;Sheba, Baby&quot; and &quot;Friday Foster&quot; (both 1975). With the demise of blaxploitation later in the 1970s, Grier appeared in smaller roles for many years. She acquired progressively larger character roles in the 1980s, including a druggie prostitute in &quot;Fort Apache, The Bronx&quot; (1981) and a witch in &quot;Something Wicked this Way Comes&quot; (1983). In 1985, Grier made her theatrical debut in Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Fool for Love&quot; at the Los Angeles Theatre Center.

Grier returned to film as Steven Seagal&#x27;s detective partner in &quot;Above the Law&quot; (1988). She had a recurring role on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; from 1985 to 1989, and made guest appearances on &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot; and &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel Air&quot;. She had a recurring role in the TV series &quot;Crime Story&quot;, between 1986 and 1988. Her role in &quot;Rocket Gibraltar&quot; (1988) was cut due to fears by the film&#x27;s director, Daniel Petrie, of &quot;repercussions from interracial love scenes&quot;. She appeared on &quot;Sinbad&quot;, &quot;Preston Chronicles&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;, and &quot;Mad TV&quot;. In 1994, Grier appeared in Snoop Dogg&#x27;s video for &quot;Doggy Dogg World&quot;.
In the late 1990s, Grier was a cast member of the Showtime series &quot;Linc&#x27;s&quot;. She appeared in 1996 in John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; and 1997 with the title role in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, films that partly paid homage to her 1970s blaxploitation films. She was nominated for numerous awards for her work in the Tarantino film. Grier appeared on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The L Word&quot;, in which she played Kit Porter. The series ran for six seasons and ended in March 2009. Grier occasionally guest-stars in such television series as &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (where she is a recurring character).

In 2010, Grier began appearing in a recurring role on the hit science-fiction series &quot;Smallville&quot; as the villain Amanda Waller, also known as White Queen, head agent of Checkmate, a covert operations agency. She appeared as a friend and colleague to Julia Roberts&#x27; college professor in 2011&#x27;s &quot;Larry Crowne&quot;.

In 2010, Grier wrote her memoir, &quot;Foxy: My Life in Three Acts&quot;, with Andrea Cagan.

Grier received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore in 2011. That same year, she received an honorary Doctorate of Science from Langston University.

&quot;Essence&quot; magazine wrote in 2012,&quot;So revolutionary were the characters Grier played that women reportedly would stand on chairs and cheer&quot;.

Grier founded the Pam Grier Community Garden and Education Center with the National Multicultural Western Heritage Museum. The purpose is to teach people about organic gardening, health, and nutrition among other things. The museum named its first garden in honor of Grier in 2011.

In January 2018, Grier said that a biopic based on her memoir is in the works, entitled &quot;Pam.&quot;

In April 2022, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) announced the fourth season of their podcast, &quot;The Plot Thickens&quot;, would focus on Grier&#x27;s life and career.

== Personal life ==
Grier met basketball player Ferdinand Lewis (Lew) Alcindor in 1969. Early in their relationship, he converted to Islam and changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Abdul-Jabbar proposed to Grier on the condition that she immediately convert to Islam. Grier refused, and he married a different woman that day.

Grier met the comedian Freddie Prinze while promoting her film &quot;Coffy&quot; in 1973. They began a relationship and considered marriage. Prinze wanted her to have his baby, but she was reluctant due to his history of depression and drug addiction. They remained in touch after their break-up. She was one of the last people Prinze spoke to before he died in 1977.

Grier met the comedian Richard Pryor through her relationship with Prinze; they began dating after they were both cast in 1977&#x27;s &quot;Greased Lightning&quot;. She helped Pryor learn to read and tried to extricate him from drug abuse. After six months of sobriety, he relapsed. In her memoir, Grier described how her sexual relationship with Pryor caused cocaine to enter her system. Grier confronted Pryor about protecting her health, but he refused to use a condom. Pryor married Deborah McGuire while dating Grier in 1977.

Grier was formerly romantically linked to Jimmie &quot;Big Wheel&quot; Wheeler, a famous boxing promoter; &quot;Soul Train&quot; host Don Cornelius; and basketball player Wilt Chamberlain. In 1998, Grier was engaged to RCA Records executive Kevin Evans, but the engagement ended in 1999.

Grier was diagnosed with stage four cervical cancer in 1988, and was told she had 18 months to live. Through vigorous treatment, she recovered and has since been in remission.

Grier lives on a ranch in Colorado.

Although she is close with actor and Protestant minister Rosey Grier, she denies the rumor that they are related.

==Honors and awards==
For her the culture-shaping effect of cultural contributions made throughout her career, Grier was recognized with a lifetime achievement award at the 2024 Toronto Black Film Festival.

For Valentine&#x27;s Day 2024, Quentin Tarantino paid homage to Grier with the opening of a Los Feliz coffee shop, carrying the namesake of the 1973 American-culture-shaping character she famously portrayed in Coffy.

<text>Vernon Milton Singer (March 26, 1919 – September 20, 2003) was a Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1959 to 1977 who represented the North York ridings of York Centre, Downsview and Wilson Heights.

==Background==
Singer was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of lawyer and politician Joseph Singer who was the first Jewish-Canadian to be elected to the Toronto Board of Control. After serving in World War II with the Royal Canadian Dragoons, Singer returned to Canada and became president of the Young Liberals in 1947. He worked for a while as a lawyer before entering politics. He and his wife Elaine had three children.

==Politics==
He became a councillor in North York, Ontario eventually becoming reeve from 1957 to 1958. He ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party at the 1958 Ontario Liberal leadership convention, placing fourth.

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1959 provincial election. Singer became deputy leader of the Ontario Liberal Party and, as a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP), pushed for reforms to municipal law, automobile insurance and electoral laws as well as for the establishment of a provincial ombudsman.

He served as Liberal House Leader in the 1970s and, in 1973, sued fellow Liberal MPP Eddie Sargent for libel after Sargent made remarks about Singer&#x27;s retainer fee from a developer while he was appearing before a legislative committee to explain how he obtained the contract to build Ontario Hydro&#x27;s new headquarters in Toronto. Singer was deputy leader of the Liberals from 1966 until 1973, when he was asked to step down by leader Robert Nixon, after he filed the lawsuit but was allowed to remain in the shadow cabinet.

Singer was re-elected to the legislature on four successive occasions before retiring in 1977. His retirement was controversial as he announced it on the eve of that year&#x27;s election campaign without giving his Liberal colleagues advance notice. The Progressive Conservatives won Singer&#x27;s previously safe seat in the election and, the next year, the government appointed Singer to the first of five two-year terms on the Ontario Municipal Board including several years as its chairman. The incident resulted in accusations by NDP MPP Ed Ziemba that the government had bought Singer&#x27;s seat, and that of fellow Liberal Philip Givens who left in similar circumstances, through political patronage.

==Later life==
Following his retirement from the Ontario Municipal Board in 1989, Singer won election to North York&#x27;s committee of adjustment filling a seat vacated by Patti Starr when she was forced to resign as the result of a wider political scandal.

<text>Shape of Despair is a funeral doom metal band from Finland.

==History==
The band was founded in 1995 as Raven by Jarno Salomaa (guitars, later also keyboards), Tomi Ullgrén (bass, later guitars) and Toni &quot;Otso&quot; Mäensivu (drums, later vocals). They aspired to play faster, instrumental black metal influenced music following the footsteps of their contemporaries like Strid, Burzum, Darkthrone and Unholy. However, the trio soon decided that the music they played was not as good as they wanted it to be, feeling that it lacked the atmosphere and emotion of the bands that influenced them.

During the summer of 1995, Raven recorded their rehearsals on cassette tapes, capturing all the songs that later became the &quot;Alone In The Mist&quot; demo. After listening to the tape, Raven decided it was good enough to record the tracks in a professional studio. Three years later, Raven entered Arkki-studio. They postponed practicing vocals until the last minute and were surprised at how well Mäensivu&#x27;s vocals fit their music. 
The &quot;Alone In The Mist&quot; demo was not released until 2016.

The band changed their name in September 1998 to Shape of Despair, in part to distinguish themselves from a UK hard rock band of the same name. Additionally, they believed their new moniker better reflected their sound. 

In 2000, they signed a deal with Spikefarm Records and released their debut album &quot;Shades of...&quot; with Samu Ruotsalainen on drums.

The second album &quot;Angels of Distress&quot;, released in September 2001, featured Pasi Koskinen on lead vocals. Sami Uusitalo joined in 2002 to play bass for the third album &quot;Illusion&#x27;s Play&quot; (2004).

In 2005, the band released a compilation titled &quot;Shape of Despair&quot;, featuring rare and unreleased material from the group, including tracks from the band&#x27;s first demo &quot;Alone in the Mist&quot; and a new song called “Sleeping Murder”&quot;.&quot; The album was recorded over a four-day period at Sundicoop Studios in Savonlinna, Finland. After a 5-year lull the band released the EP &quot;Written in My Scars&quot; and a split EP with Before The Rain.

In 2011, Henri Koivula took over vocals from Koskinen. Due in part to band members’ competing commitments to other musical projects, there was an 11 year gap between &quot;Illusion’s Play&quot; and their next full length album, &quot;Monotony Fields.&quot; Additionally, the instruments were recorded separately and months apart. Released on June 15, 2015, by Season of Mist, &quot;Monotony Fields&quot; was hailed by one reviewer as “a great come back” and their best album so far. 

In 2022, they released &quot;Return to&quot; &quot;the Void,&quot; which featured almost an hour of music. Some reviewers praised the beauty and artistry of the music but commented that the sound was too monotonous.

<text>Vivian Mercier (1919 – 4 November 1989) was an Irish literary critic. He was born at Clara in County Offaly and educated, first, at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, and then, at Trinity College Dublin. He was elected a Scholar of the college in 1938, and edited the student magazine &quot;T.C.D. Miscellany&quot;.

After taking his doctorate at Trinity, he taught in American universities from the 1940s to the 1980s; his last post was Professor of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is perhaps best known for his famous summation of the plot of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;: &quot;... has achieved a theoretical impossibility—a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What&#x27;s more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.&quot; (&quot;The Irish Times&quot;, 18 February 1956, p. 6.). Despite what may sound like a somewhat disparaging criticism, Mercier was one of the foremost Beckett scholars of his day, and wrote extensively about &quot;Godot&quot;. He also wrote a critically acclaimed study of Beckett&#x27;s work as a whole, &quot;Beckett/Beckett&quot;.

Mercier died in 1989, the same year as Beckett. His last marriage (1974–1989) was to the Irish novelist and children&#x27;s writer Eilís Dillon, who edited his posthumous book, &quot;Modern Irish Literature: Sources and Founders&quot; (Oxford, 1994). He is buried beside his wife in his hometown of Clara.

<text>The Nakajima Ki-44 &quot;Shoki&quot; (鍾馗, &quot;Devil Queller&quot;) was a single-seat fighter-interceptor which was developed by the Nakajima Aircraft Company and operated by the Imperial Japanese Army from 1942 to 1945 during World War II. Its official designation was Army Type 2 Single-Seat Fighter (二式単座戦闘機) and its Allied reporting name was Tojo.

The design and development of the Ki-44 differed greatly from that of other Japanese fighters of the time, incorporating speed and rate-of-climb in preference to maneuverability. This was a result of a need for a heavy fighter aircraft that followed a more offensive doctrine and the Ki-44 is often classified as an Air Defence Fighter. Its development ran almost in parallel to its predecessor, the lighter and nimbler Nakajima Ki-43, and yet the two aircraft differed. The Ki-44 had a higher landing speed but was less maneuverable. These were concerns for pilots who would compare it to the Ki-43 or Ki-27 which were far more agile and responsive. As a result, the Ki-44 was first restricted to pilots with at least 1000 hours of flying time due to its tricky handling characteristics. However, it was later found that younger pilots who had not been instilled with the extensive aerobatic training of earlier cadres could manage the aircraft perfectly well, so the restriction was removed.

Nonetheless, the Ki-44 was the fastest climbing Japanese fighter at the time. It was the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s only interceptor type when the USAAF&#x27;s B-29 Superfortresses began bombing the Japanese mainland in June 1944. While there were performance restrictions at high altitude, it was superior to the Ki-43 in that it was capable of matching Allied aircraft in climbs and dives, giving pilots more flexibility in combat and greater pilot confidence than the Ki-43; the basic armament of four 12.7mm machine guns or two 12.7mm guns and two 20 mm cannons (or, in a few aircraft, two Ho-301 40mm cannons of limited range) was far more powerful than the older Ki-43&#x27;s two 12.7mm machine guns.

Production of the Ki-44 was terminated in late 1944 in favour of the more advanced Nakajima Ki-84, and when the war ended, only three sentai units were still equipped with them.

No examples survive today.

== Design and development ==

Nakajima began development of the Ki-44 in 1940 as a pure interceptor with emphasis being placed on airspeed and rate of climb rather than maneuverability, a departure from the usual Japanese standards. The Japanese Army Air Force specification called for a maximum speed of 600 km/h (370 mph) at 4,000 m (13,130 ft), to be attained in five minutes. A set of Ki-43-like &quot;butterfly&quot; combat flaps was fitted for improved maneuverability. Armament consisted of a pair of 7.7 mm (.303 in) and a pair of 12.7 mm (.50 in) machine guns.

The engine selected for the new interceptor was Nakajima&#x27;s Ha-41 (a development of the Nakajima Ha-5) 14-cylinder double-row radial, originally intended for bomber aircraft. Although the Ha-41 was not the ideal choice due to its large-diameter cross section, the design team was able to marry this engine to a much smaller fuselage with a narrow cross section. At 1,260 mm in diameter, the Ha-41 was 126 mm larger in diameter than the 1,144 mm Nakajima Sakae (used in the Mitsubishi A6M &quot;Zero&quot; and Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Hayabusa&quot;). However, the Sakae was only 27.8L in displacement and 1,000 hp, while the Ha-41 was 37.5L and made 1,260 hp (1,440 in the later Ha-109 version). In any case, since the Sakae wasn&#x27;t powerful enough, the only alternative available was the Mitsubishi Kinsei, which was slightly smaller than the Ha-41 in diameter, five liters smaller in displacement, and was less powerful. Unfortunately, this was already in demand for many other aircraft, so the Ha-41 was chosen as the best powerplant. In order to achieve its design goals, the wing area was relatively small leading to a high wing loading and a comparatively high landing speed that could be daunting to the average Japanese pilot, who was more used to aircraft with a low wing loading like the Ki-44&#x27;s predecessors, the Ki-43 and Ki-27.

With an all-metal structure, the Ki-44 was metal-skinned except for the control surfaces, which were fabric covered. Relatively small wings gave the aircraft a high wing loading and consequently a high landing speed, which many pilots disliked.

The first Ki-44 prototype flew in August 1940 and the initial test flights were generally encouraging, with handling considered acceptable considering the high wing loading. Problems encountered included a high landing speed and poor forward visibility during taxiing due to the large radial engine.

A second pre-production batch of 40 aircraft were ordered, which featured four 12.7mm machine guns, a relocated air cooler and main gear doors.

== Operational history ==

The Nakajima Ki-44 at one point equipped 12 &quot;sentai&quot; (&quot;groups/wings&quot;) of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force: &quot;9, 22, 23, 29, 47, 59, 64, 70, 85, 87, 104&quot; and &quot;246&quot; &quot;Sentai&quot;. The Manchukuo Air Force also operated some Ki-44s.
Pre-production Ki-44 aircraft and two of the prototypes were turned over to the Army for service trials on 15 September 1941. The type commenced operations when nine aircraft were received by an experimental unit, &quot;47th Chutai&quot; &quot;Kawasemi Buntai&quot; (&quot;Kingfisher Flight, 47th Squadron&quot;), commanded by Major Toshio Sakagawa at Saigon, Indochina in December 1941.

The Ki-44 also saw significant action with &quot;87th Sentai&quot; in the air defense role, while based at Palembang, Sumatra. Other units equipped with the Ki-44 during the early part of the war were stationed in China, Burma, the Philippines and Korea.
Later in the war, the type saw action in an air defense role over the home islands – mainly around Japan&#x27;s large industrial cities. &quot;47 Chutai&quot;, after it was transferred to air defense roles in Japan, was expanded to become &quot;47 Sentai&quot;.

The Ki-44-II &quot;Otsu&quot; (also known as the Ki-44-IIb) could be armed with a Ho-301 40 mm autocannon. While this was a relatively high-caliber weapon, it used caseless ammunition with a low muzzle velocity and short range, which was effective only in close attacks. Some of these aircraft were used against USAAF bombers by a special &quot;Shinten Seiku Tai&quot; (air superiority unit), comprising at least four aircraft, that was part of &quot;47th Sentai&quot;, based at Narimasu airfield in Tokyo. Pilots from such units attempted to shoot down B-29s and, once their ammunition was expended, to ram them – effectively a suicide attack. While the concept appeared straightforward, ramming a B-29 at high altitudes was difficult to achieve in practice.

By the end of the war, Ki-44 variants were being replaced by the Nakajima Ki-84 &quot;Hayate&quot;, which was regarded as vastly superior in aspects other than maintenance and reliability.

During 1946–49, both sides in the Chinese Revolution operated Ki-44s surrendered or abandoned by Japanese units. Air units of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army obtained aircraft formerly belonging to &quot;22&quot; and &quot;85 Sentai&quot;, which had disbanded in Chosen. Some of these aircraft were reportedly flown by Japanese veterans. Within the Republic of China Air Force, 18th Squadron (12th Fighter Group) was equipped with Ki-44s, formerly of &quot;9th Sentai&quot;, which had disbanded in Nanking, and &quot;29th Sentai&quot;, which had disbanded at Formosa Following the retreat of the Nationalists, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (formed in 1949) used the Ki-44 until the early 1950s.

=== Surviving aircraft ===
No complete surviving examples of the Ki-44 exist today. However, a wing center section is preserved at the Northwestern Polytechnical University Aviation Museum at Xi&#x27;an in China.

== Variants ==

; Ki-44: First prototype (s/n 4401) with Ha-41 engine with a complex cooling system, unique for the first prototype.
; Ki-44: Nine pre-production aircraft (s/n 4402-4410), the first of which were quite different than the later ones. These aircraft were used for combat evaluation with the 47th Independent Fighter Chutai at the start of the Pacific War. Their armament consisted of two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 89 machine guns in the nose and two 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine guns in the wings. Type 89 telescopic gunsight protruding through the windscreen. Provision for a single drop tank under the fuselage centre line or two drop tanks under the wings. Recognisable by their pointed spinner caps.
; Ki-44-I: Powered by a 930 kW (1,250 hp) Nakajima Ha-41 engine with annular oil cooler, with a maximum speed of 580 km/h (363 mph). Armament and gunsight were unchanged from the pre-production models. Provision for two drop tanks under the wings. Rounded spinner caps with provision for Hucks starter. Late models had external fuel coolers. Forty produced (s/n 111-150).
; Ki-44-II Ko (Ki-44-IIa): Powered by a 1,074 kW (1,440 hp) Nakajima Ha-109 engine with external oil cooler and a top speed of 604 km/h (378 mph). Armament, gunsight and drop tank provision as for Ki-44-I. Rectangular cockpit access doors replaced the rounded version of earlier models. 355 produced (s/n 1001-1355).
; Ki-44-II Otsu (Ki-44-IIb):Standard armament reduced to just two 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine guns in the nose. Optional provision for two 40 mm (1.57 in) Ho-301 cannons in the wings. These were not always installed due to disappointing combat results and were sometimes replaced with two 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine guns. This variant retained the Type 89 telescopic gunsight as standard. 394 produced (s/n 1356-1749).
; Ki-44-II Hei (Ki-44-IIc):Standard armament of four 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine guns, two in the nose and two in the wings. Type 100 reflector gunsight mounted as standard. 427 produced (s/n 1750-2176).
; Ki-44-III: A single prototype built, powered by a Ha-145 two-row 18-cylinder engine of 1,491 kW (2,000 hp).
; Ki-44-III Ko (Ki-44-IIIa): Proposed variant with an armament of four 20 mm Ho-5 cannons.
; Ki-44-III Otsu (Ki-44-IIIb): Proposed variant with armament of two 20 mm Ho-5 cannons and two 37 mm (1.46 in) Ho-203 cannons.

Total production: 1,227

<text>Richard Welstead Croker (November 24, 1843 – April 29, 1922), known as &quot;Boss Croker&quot;, was an Irish American political boss who was a leader of New York City&#x27;s Tammany Hall. His control over the city was cemented with the 1897 election of Robert A. Van Wyck as the first mayor of all five boroughs. During his tenure as Grand Sachem, Boss Croker garnered a reputation for corruption and ruthlessness and was frequently the subject of investigations. As his power waned following the 1900 and 1901 elections, Croker resigned his position and returned to Ireland, where he spent the rest of his life.

==Biography==

Richard Croker was born in the townland of Ballyva, in the parish of Ardfield, six miles south of Clonakilty in County Cork on November 24, 1843, son of Eyre Coote Croker (1800–1881) and Frances Laura Welsted (1807–1894). He was taken to the United States by his parents when he was just two years old. They boarded the &quot;Henry Clay&quot; in Cobh, County Cork and headed for the land of opportunity.

There were significant differences between this family and the typical family leaving Ireland at that time. They were Protestant, and were not land tenants. Eyre Coote Croker owned an estate in Ardfield, in southwest Cork. Upon arrival in the United States, Eyre Coote Croker was without a profession, but he had a general knowledge of horses and soon became a veterinary surgeon. During the Civil War, he served in that same capacity under General Daniel Sickles.

Richard Croker was educated in New York public schools. Croker dropped out of school at age twelve or thirteen to become an apprentice machinist in the Harlem Railroad machine shops. Not long after, he became a valued member of the Fourth Avenue Tunnel Gang, a street gang that attacked teamsters and other workers that gathered around the Harlem line&#x27;s freight depot. Croker eventually became the gang&#x27;s leader. He joined one of the Volunteer Fire Departments in 1863, becoming an engineer of one of the engine companies. That was his gateway into public life. James O&#x27;Brien, a Tammany associate, took notice of Croker after Croker won a boxing match against Dick Lynch whereby Croker knocked out all of Lynch&#x27;s teeth. Croker became a member of Tammany Hall and active in its politics. In the 1860s, he was well known for being a &quot;repeater&quot; at elections, voting multiple times at the polls. He was an alderman from 1868 to 1870, Coroner of New York County, New York, from 1873 to 1876. Croker was charged with the murder of John McKenna, a lieutenant of James O&#x27;Brien, during a fight on election day of 1874 with O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s rival political group. O&#x27;Brien was running for Congress against the Tammany-backed Abram S. Hewitt. John Kelly, the new Tammany Hall boss, attended the trial, and Croker was freed after the jury was undecided. Croker moved to Harrison, New York by 1880. He was appointed the New York City Fire Commissioner in 1883 and 1887 and city Chamberlain from 1889 to 1900.
After the death of John Kelly, Croker became the leader of Tammany Hall and for some time almost completely controlled that organization. As head of Tammany, Croker received bribe money from the owners of brothels, saloons and illegal gambling dens. Croker was chairman of Tammany&#x27;s Finance Committee but received no salary for his position. Croker also became a partner in the real estate firm Meyer and Croker with Peter F. Meyer, from which he made substantial money. The money was often derived from sales under the control of the city through city judges. Other income came by way of gifts of stock from street railway and transit companies, for example. The city police were largely still under the control of Tammany Hall, and payoffs from vice protection operations also contributed to Tammany income. Croker survived Charles Henry Parkhurst&#x27;s attacks on Tammany Hall&#x27;s corruption and became a wealthy man. Several committees were established in the 1890s, largely at the behest of Thomas C. Platt and other Republicans, to investigate Tammany and Croker, including the 1890 Fassett Committee, the 1894 Lexow Committee, during which Croker left the United States for his European residences for three years, and the Mazet Investigation of 1899.

Croker&#x27;s greatest political success was his bringing about the 1897 election of Robert A. Van Wyck as first mayor of the five-borough &quot;greater&quot; New York, and during Van Wyck&#x27;s administration Croker is popularly supposed to have completely dominated the government of the city.

Croker was in the newspapers in 1899 after a disagreement with Jay Gould&#x27;s son, George Gould, president of the Manhattan Elevated Railroad Company, when Gould refused Croker&#x27;s attempt to attach compressed-air pipes to the Elevated company&#x27;s structures. Croker owned many shares of the New York Auto-Truck Company, which would have benefited from the arrangement. In response to the refusal, Croker used Tammany influence to create new city laws requiring drip pans under structures in Manhattan at every street crossing and the requirement that the railroad run trains every five minutes with a $100 violation for every instance. Croker also held 2,500 shares of the American Ice Company, worth approximately $250,000, which came under scrutiny in 1900 when the company attempted to raise the price of ice in the city.

After Croker&#x27;s failure to carry the city in the 1900 presidential election and the defeat of his mayoralty candidate, Edward M. Shepard in 1901, he resigned from his position of leadership in Tammany and was succeeded by Lewis Nixon. Croker departed the United States in 1905. An associate described Croker as having &quot;[a] strong frame, a deep chest, a short neck and a pair of hard fists... He speaks in monosyllables, [and] commands a vocabulary that appears to be limited to about three hundred words...&quot;

==Thoroughbred racing==

Croker operated a stable of thoroughbred racehorses in the United States in partnership with Mike Dwyer. In January 1895, they sent a stable of horses to England under the care of trainer Hardy Campbell Jr. and jockey Willie Simms. Following a dispute, the partnership was dissolved in May but Croker continued to race in England.

In 1907, his horse Orby won Britain&#x27;s most prestigious race, The Derby. Orby was ridden by American jockey John Reiff, whose brother Lester had won the race in 1901. Croker was also the breeder of Orby&#x27;s son Grand Parade, who won the Derby in 1919.

==Death==
Croker returned to Ireland in 1905 and bought an estate in Malahide, county Dublin where he bred horses. He died on April 29, 1922, at Glencairn House, his home in Stillorgan outside Dublin. 
His funeral, celebrated by South African bishop William Miller, drew some of Dublin&#x27;s most eminent citizens; the pallbearers were Arthur Griffith, the President of Dáil Éireann; Laurence O&#x27;Neill, the Lord Mayor of Dublin; Oliver St. John Gogarty; Joseph MacDonagh; A.H. Flauley, of Chicago; and J.E. Tierney. Michael Collins, Chairman of the Provisional Government, was represented by Kevin O&#x27;Shiel; the Lord Lieutenant, Viscount FitzAlan, was represented by his under-secretary, James MacMahon. 

In 1927, J. J. Walsh claimed that, just before his death, Croker had accepted the Provisional Government&#x27;s invitation to stand in Dublin County in the imminent Irish election.

==Family==
Croker married twice; first, in 1873, to Elizabeth Fraser. They had several children.
He married Bula Benson Edmondson in November 1914 when he was 71 years old. She was of American Indian descent, her tribal name being Ketaw Kaluntuchy.

===Disputed will===
Croker left an estate estimated to $3–5 million to his second wife, Beulah, disinheriting his estranged children. He had converted to Catholicism shortly before his death but this does not appear to have played a role in his disinheriting his children. A note in his handwriting, dated at Glencairn, November 15, 1919 read as follows:

Croker&#x27;s other surviving children, Richard, Ethel, and Howard, unsuccessfully challenged the will in a celebrated probate lawsuit in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench in Ireland. They claimed that their father in 1919 was of unsound mind and unduly influenced by his wife, and that the 1914 marriage was void as she was already married to one Guy R. Marone. A jury rejected all these allegations. The widow and children had related lawsuits in the United States.

<doc id="1046366" wikidata="Q5341138" url="?curid=1046366" title="Education in Seattle">
<text>[[Education]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] is an important part of many Seattleites&#x27; lives, particularly due to the high concentration of technology, engineering, and other jobs that require advanced degrees. Of the city&#x27;s population over the age of 25, 53.8 percent (vs. a national average of 27.4 percent) hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher; 91.9 percent (vs. 84.5 percent nationally) have a high school diploma or equivalent. In fact, the United States Census Bureau surveys indicate that Seattle has one of the highest rates of college graduates among major U.S. cities. In addition to the obvious institutions of education, there are significant adult literacy programs and considerable homeschooling. Seattle is also the most literate city in the United States, based on a study done by Central Connecticut State University.

==Colleges and universities==
Seattle is home to one of the nation&#x27;s most respected public universities, the University of Washington. With over 40,000 under-graduates and post-graduates, UW is the largest school in the Pacific Northwest and many of its departments are ranked in the top 10 for research universities in the United States according to the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Learning&quot;. A study by &quot;Newsweek International&quot; in 2006 cited UW as the twenty-second best university in the world. Additionally, the University of Washington was ranked 16th internationally by the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; in 2008.

The city&#x27;s other prominent universities are Seattle University, a Jesuit university, and Seattle Pacific University, a Free Methodist university. 

There are also a handful of smaller schools, such as the City University of Seattle, a private university. Antioch University Seattle provide undergraduate and graduate degrees for working adults. Cornish College of the Arts, The Art Institute of Seattle, Gage Academy of Art and the School of Visual Concepts offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the fine arts as dance, music, and theatre. Seattle also has three colleges within the Seattle Colleges District system, comprising North, Central, and South. &quot;Time&quot; magazine chose Seattle Central College for best college of the year in 2001, stating the school &quot;pushes diverse students to work together in small teams&quot;.

Since 2013, Northeastern University has a satellite graduate campus in the South Lake Union neighborhood.

==Primary and secondary education==
Seattle Public Schools is the school district for the vast majority of the city. It desegregated without a court order but continue to struggle to achieve racial balance in a somewhat ethnically divided city (the south part of town having more ethnic minorities than the north). In 2006, a challenge to Seattle&#x27;s racial tie-breaking system made it to the United States Supreme Court. Where the Supreme Court decided that race was not a legal criterion for desegregation, but left the door open for desegregation formulas based on other indicators (e.g., income or socio-economic class). And in 2002, West Seattle&#x27;s West Seattle High School made headlines in the midst of protests of the school&#x27;s &quot;Indian&quot; mascot. Despite bitter battles between SPS and Alumni Association President and Attorney Robert Zoffel, the school would later change its mascot to the &quot;Wildcats&quot;.

A small section of the city is in the Highline School District.

<text>Nodar Vladimirovich Khashba (, ; born 1 October 1951) is a former prime minister of Georgia&#x27;s breakaway republic of Abkhazia and a former mayor of Sukhumi.

Khashba was mayor of Sukhumi from 1993 until 1995. Afterwards he became a senior official in Russia&#x27;s emergencies ministry. In April 2004 he emerged as one of the leaders of a new political movement named United Abkhazia (Yedinaya Abkhazia, reminiscent of the Russian pro-Kremlin party Yedinaya Rossiya). He was not eligible to run in the October 2004 presidential election in Abkhazia because of a requirement that candidates must have been resident in Abkhazia for five years. Shortly after the election, amid confusion surrounding its outcome, the outgoing president, Vladislav Ardzinba, appointed Khashba prime minister.

On 14 November, Prime Minister Nodar Khashba, named by the relatives of human rights activist Tamara Shakryl as responsible for her death and threatened by them, had to spend the night at Russia&#x27;s Peacemaking Headquarters in Sukhumi. Tensions continued to mount as the day for Bagapsh&#x27;s inaugural ceremony came. In early December 2004, however, Bagapsh came to an agreement with Khadjimba under which they would run in new elections under a national unity ticket, with Bagapsh as presidential candidate and Khadjimba as vice-presidential candidate. The ticket won the elections with over 90% of the vote, and the new administration took office on 12 February 2005.

<text>The Deseret News () is a multi-platform newspaper based in Salt Lake City, published by Deseret News Publishing Company, a subsidiary of Deseret Management Corporation, which is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Founded in 1850, it was the first newspaper to be published in Utah. The publication&#x27;s name is from the geographic area of Deseret identified by Utah&#x27;s pioneer settlers, and much of the publication&#x27;s reporting is rooted in that region.

On January 1, 2021, the newspaper switched from a daily to a weekly print format while continuing to publish daily on the website and Deseret News app. As of 2024, &quot;Deseret News&quot; develops daily content for its website and apps, in addition to twice weekly print editions of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; Local Edition and a weekly edition of the &quot;Church News&quot; and &quot;Deseret News&quot; National Edition. The company also publishes 10 editions of &quot;Deseret Magazine&quot; per year.

==Founding and early years==
===1800s===
====The press====

On March 31, 1847, while at Winter Quarters, Nebraska, the LDS Church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles authorized William W. Phelps to &quot;go east and procure a printing press&quot; to be taken to the future Mormon settlement in the Great Basin. Phelps left Winter Quarters sometime in May, and went to Boston by way of the former Mormon settlement of Nauvoo, Illinois. In Boston, with the help of William I. Appleby, the president of the Church&#x27;s Eastern States Mission, and Church member Alexander Badlam, Phelps was able to procure a wrought iron Ramage hand-press, type, and other required equipment. He returned to Winter Quarters on November 12, 1847, with the press. Due partly to its size and weight, the press and equipment would not be taken to Salt Lake City until 1849. By that time many of the Mormon pioneers had left Winter Quarters and the press was moved across the Missouri River to another temporary Mormon settlement, Kanesville, Iowa. In April 1849 the press and other church property was loaded onto ox drawn wagons, and traveled with the Howard Egan Company along the Mormon Trail. The wagon company, with the press, arrived in the Salt Lake Valley August 7, 1849.

The press was moved into a small adobe building (just east of the present site of the Hotel Utah) that also served as a coin mint for the settlers. The press was at first used to print the necessary documents (such as laws, records, and forms) used in setting up the provisional State of Deseret.

====First issue====
The first issue of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; was published June 15, 1850, and was eight pages long. This first issue included the paper&#x27;s prospectus, written by the editor Willard Richards, along with news from the United States Congress, and a report on the San Francisco 1849 Christmas Eve fire; an event which had occurred six months prior. Because it was meant to be the voice of the State of Deseret, it was called the &quot;Deseret News,&quot; and its motto was &quot;Truth and Liberty&quot;. It was at first a weekly Saturday publication, and published in &quot;pamphlet form&quot; in hopes that readers would have the papers bound into volumes. Subscription rate was $2.50 for six months.

A jobs press, usually called the Deseret News Press, was also set up so the &quot;News&quot; could print books, booklets, handbills, broadsides, etc., for paying customers and other publishers.

====Paper====
From the beginning, paper shortages were a problem for the &quot;News&quot; staff. Starting with the October 19, 1850, issue—only four months after publication began—the paper had to be changed to a bi-weekly publication. Even so, many times in the 1850s there were several periods when the &quot;News&quot; could not be published for lack of paper; one period lasted three months during the fall of 1851.

Thomas Howard, a Mormon immigrant from England, and a paper-maker, approached Brigham Young about using some machinery—originally meant for producing sugar—to make their own paper; Young agreed to the plan. The publishers asked everyone to donate old paper and cloth to the venture. In the summer of 1854 the first issues of the &quot;News&quot; were published on &quot;homemade paper&quot; that was very thick, and grayish in color.

Even with paper shortages, occasionally a &quot;News&quot; extra would be published, if there were important news or a sermon that could not wait for the regular publication date.

====Utah War====
During a turbulent time period, later known as the Utah War, the &quot;News&quot; presses and equipment were moved to the central and southern parts of the state. As armed forces of the United States camped just outside the state at Fort Bridger, George Q. Cannon was assigned to take some presses and equipment to Fillmore while Henry McEwan was to take the remainder to Parowan. On May 5, 1858, the first issue of the &quot;News&quot; with Fillmore City as the publication place appeared; issues would continue to be printed in both Fillmore and Parowan until September 1858 While in Fillmore, the press was kept in the basement of the Utah Territorial Statehouse. That fall the presses were brought back to Salt Lake City and placed in the Council House, allowing the &quot;News&quot; to begin normal operations. The soldiers who had marched to Utah during the war would remain at the newly constructed Camp Floyd. Their need for a newspaper, one not published by the LDS Church, was satisfied with &quot;Kirk Anderson&#x27;s Valley Tan&quot;, the area&#x27;s second newspaper (and first competitor to the &quot;News&quot;); published November 6, 1858.

During the 1850s through 1860s, numerous articles in the &quot;News&quot; were printed in the Deseret Alphabet.

====Challenges and changes====
The coming of the Pony Express to Utah in 1860 would bring changes to the paper, allowing news from the East to arrive in the Territory much faster. Even so, the paper remained a weekly, with &quot;News&quot; extras being published with more frequency and temporary renamed &quot;The Pony Dispatch&quot;.

Yet, paper problems still plagued the publishers; paper was very expensive to haul from California or the East, and attempts at making paper in the valley were still, for the most part, futile. In 1860 a paper-making machine had been purchased, and set-up in the Deseret Manufacturing Company sugar house factory, but lack of available materials meant a lack of paper. As a result, Brigham Young called George Goddard on a rag-gathering mission. Goddard traveled through the territory collecting rags that would then be turned into paper, and was able to supply enough to keep the &quot;News&quot; in production. Other problems such as ice and drought on the stream, running out of Parley&#x27;s Canyon, that ran the paper mill caused the paper to have short lapses in publication.

In October 1861 the lines of the First Transcontinental Telegraph met in Salt Lake City, making the Pony Express obsolete, and bringing news to the Territory almost instantly. The &quot;News&quot; extras, now sometimes called telegraphic dispatches, were printed with even more frequency.
In March 1862, the &quot;News&quot; and its staff moved from the Council House to the Deseret Store, and in 1864 a steam-powered printing press arrived; it was placed in the basement the building. The set type was lowered from the offices in the building&#x27;s upper floor to the basement, through holes in each floor. Later an addition was constructed to the east of this building, and the presses were moved into that building.

On October 8, 1865, the &quot;News&quot; launched its semi-weekly edition, this allowed news to get out more quickly and allowed for more advertisements. The weekly edition would continue and contained much of the same content as the semi-weekly, but editorials were different.

In November 1867, George Q. Cannon became the editor, and on the 21st of that month, the &quot;News&quot; published its first daily edition, which was printed in the evening, and as such was named &quot;The Deseret Evening News&quot;. Most of what was published in the daily edition, was also published in the weekly and semi-weekly, as the daily was meant for city readers and the weekly and semi-weekly for those living in the more rural areas of the territory. Until December 1898 all three editions—the weekly, semi-weekly, and daily—were published concurrently.

In 1870, the &quot;Mormon Tribune&quot;, later named &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;, was first printed, adding a new newspaper rival to the Salt Lake area. Since its founding the &quot;Tribune&quot; and &quot;News&quot; have often been involved in &quot;newspaper battles&quot;, times when they could not agree on anything, even secular items. During these battles the &quot;News&quot; has often been called grandmother, granny, or The Mormon Hand Organ.

Since its first publication, the &quot;News&quot; had been owned directly by the LDS Church, but as worries about property confiscation increased due to the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act and Poland Act, the paper&#x27;s ownership was transferred to The Deseret News Company following incorporation on September 3, 1880. About this same time the &quot;News&quot; began looking for a location to build a new paper mill, as the Sugar House paper plant was inadequate. A new granite plant was constructed near the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon, 13 miles south of the paper&#x27;s offices. The mill began producing paper in April 1883, and was known as the Cottonwood Paper Mill. The &quot;News&quot; would sell the paper mill in 1892 to the Granite Paper Mills Company. The mill caught fire and was destroyed April 1, 1893.

====Changing ownership====
On October 1, 1892, The Deseret News Company leased the &quot;News&quot; along with all the company&#x27;s printing, bookbinding, and merchandising to the Cannon family. The family was, at that time, operating the George Q. Cannon &amp; Sons bookstore in downtown Salt Lake City. When the lease began the family formed the Deseret News Printing Company, which was to be the lessee, while The Deseret News Company would remain a legal entity as the lessor. Two children of former &quot;News&quot; editor George Q. Cannon would play prominent roles during this period, with John Q. Cannon as editor and Abraham H. Cannon as business manager. The leasing had occurred due to financial troubles, and the Cannon family hoped to make the business profitable. This did not happen and the paper&#x27;s assets and property were transferred back to The Deseret News Company on September 7, 1898; after almost six years under the control of the Cannon family. The family&#x27;s Deseret News Publishing Company was dissolved after the lease was gone, and within a few months The Deseret News Company was also dissolved and ownership of the paper was returned directly to the LDS Church.

When the LDS Church regained direct control over the &quot;News&quot;, Horace G. Whitney was appointed business manager and Charles W. Penrose returned as editor. Immediately the paper&#x27;s weekly edition, &quot;The Deseret Weekly&quot;, was discontinued; its last issue was published December 10, 1898.

===1900s===

On October 1, 1900, the George Q. Cannon &amp; Sons bookstore was sold to the LDS Church, and renamed the Deseret News Bookstore. In 1920 the Deseret Sunday School Union Bookstore was also consolidated into the Deseret News Bookstore, and eventually the bookstore would become its own company, Deseret Book.

In 1903 the &quot;News&quot; moved out from its longtime home in the Deseret Store, kitty-corner to a newly constructed building. This was the first time the paper had a building constructed expressly for it. It was designed by Richard K.A. Kletting and built with stone from Mount Nebo in Central Utah. While the building was under construction, a fire destroyed the Oregon Short Line building in Salt Lake City, and the railroad wanted to rent space in the new building. As a result, the &quot;News&quot; constructed an annex to the west of the new building for more space. This new home was at the site of the former Council House; presently the Beneficial Tower (Gateway Tower West) sits at this location.

The daily, called the &quot;Deseret Evening News,&quot; was renamed to the &quot;Deseret News&quot; on June 15, 1920; the paper&#x27;s 70th anniversary. The semi-weekly was discontinued on June 22, 1922, leaving the daily as the only news publication. Two days later the &quot;News&quot; announced it had purchased the &quot;Utah Farmer&quot;, a weekly agricultural paper; which it would eventually sell.

In 1926 the &quot;News&quot; once again moved into a new building, this time on Richard&#x27;s Street (just south of the present Deseret Book store in City Creek Center.) This same year, the &quot;News&quot; began using teletype technology to receive news from the Associated Press.

During the 1920s the paper&#x27;s circulation nearly doubled, reaching almost 40,000.

====Radio====
On November 20, 1920, the &quot;News&quot; began airing nightly wireless news flashes, called the &quot;Deseret News&quot;-International News Service bulletins. The paper had also formed The Deseret News Wireless Club, with members across the Western United States who would transcribe the radio bulletins and post them in their communities. In April 1922 the paper received a license to officially operate a radio station, with call letters KZN (later changed to KSL). The station&#x27;s first regular broadcast aired on May 6, 1922, in the form of a talk by then-LDS Church president Heber J. Grant. In 1924 the station was sold to John Cope and his father, F.W. Cope, who formed the Radio Service Corporation of Utah. The LDS Church would later purchase this corporation and go on to create KSL-TV. The &quot;News&quot;, KSL Radio, and KSL Television remain closely linked via the global operating company, Deseret Management Corporation, which also owns Bonneville International, Deseret Book Company, and Deseret Media Company, among other organizations.

====The Deseret News Publishing Company====
The &quot;Deseret News&quot; had been under the direct ownership of the Church since 1898, when The Deseret News Company was dissolved. On December 29, 1931, the Deseret News Publishing Company was incorporated (not to be confused with the Deseret News Publishing Company formed in 1892 by the Cannon family to lease ownership of the paper, and dissolved when the lease was over). Its articles of incorporation, filed with the Salt Lake County Clerk, provided for 500 shares of stock, all retained by the Church (with the exception of the qualifying directors&#x27; shares).

====First Sunday edition====
On May 16, 1948, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; would deliver its first Sunday paper. The first Sunday edition contained 154 pages with a new farm, home, and garden section. The Sunday edition would continue into the 1950s, when an agreement with &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; would cease publication.

====Newspaper Agency Corporation====
After World War II the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Salt Lake Telegram&quot; were all struggling financially, but no more than the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. In September 1952, the owners of the &quot;News&quot; (LDS Church) and &quot;Tribune&quot; (Thomas Kearns Family) entered into a joint operating agreement (JOA), where each published separate editorial material while sharing printing, advertising and circulation costs. This JOA was the brainchild of &quot;Tribune&quot; Publisher John F. Fitzpatrick who helped LDS President David O. McKay ensure the continuation of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. As its architect, Fitzpatrick knew that this NAC arrangement would also benefit the &quot;Tribune&quot;. The &quot;Deseret News&quot; stopped Sunday publication; subscribers received a Sunday &quot;Tribune&quot; instead. The &quot;Deseret News&quot; also purchased the afternoon &quot;Salt Lake Telegram&quot; from the &quot;Tribune&quot;. The &quot;Telegram&quot; was discontinued, and into the mid-1960s, the paper&#x27;s nameplate read: &quot;The Deseret News and Salt Lake Telegram&quot;. The 30-year agreement between the two papers was renewed in 1982, with some changes. The Newspaper Agency Corporation was renamed to MediaOne of Utah in 2007.

In 1968 the &quot;Deseret News&quot; once again moved, this time into a new building on Regent Street.

====Sunday morning edition====
The joint operating agreement with the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1952 had ended the paper&#x27;s Sunday edition, but when the 30-year-old agreement was up for renewal, it was changed to allow the &quot;Deseret News&quot; to publish a Sunday morning edition and change its Saturday publication from an evening to morning paper. The first Sunday morning edition of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; appeared January 16, 1983, and the paper has published a Sunday edition ever since.

====Regent Street headquarters====

The newspaper moved into its newly constructed headquarters on Regent Street downtown Salt Lake City in 1997.

====Competition with &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;====
As the twentieth century ended, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; found itself embroiled in a contentious and often public battle with &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;, centered around the terms of their joint operating agreement, the desire of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; to switch from afternoon to morning publication, and ownership changes at the &quot;Tribune&quot;. The battle was resolved with the 2000 sale of the &quot;Tribune&quot; and with the &quot;Deseret News&quot; switching to morning publication and changing its name on June 9, 2003, to the &quot;Deseret Morning News&quot;.

===Digital era===

====1990s====
On January 26, 1995, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; launched the Crossroads Information Network, allowing subscribers to access the &quot;News&quot; digitally through their dial-up service; digital-only subscriptions were also created. Installation of the Crossroads software—which was mailed on floppy disk to each subscriber beginning in February 1995—was required on each user&#x27;s computer. The network also allowed users to access the paper&#x27;s complete text along with archives back to April 1988, the &quot;Church News&quot; and the LDS Church Almanac. The software allowed subscribers to communicate with each other through an email-like system. Eventually the Crossroads Information Network was shut down and its features were moved to DesNews.com, which itself was replaced with DeseretNews.com.

The paper&#x27;s first website, DesNews.com, was launched on September 27, 1995. This allowed &quot;News&quot; content to be accessed through an internet website, rather than the software required by Crossroads. The website was meant for those outside the Salt Lake area, who had to pay long-distance calling charges when dialed into the Crossroads network.

====2000s====
On April 13, 2008, Joseph A. Cannon announced in a front page editor&#x27;s note that the name of the newspaper had been changed back to the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, although the &quot;News&quot; would continue to be published in the morning.

====2010s====

In 2010, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; moved its offices out of the Deseret News Building to the broadcast house in the Triad Center, so they could integrate with KSL&#x27;s newsroom.

In November 2016, Doug Wilks became the editor of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;.

In October 2016, breaking an 80-year tradition of staying out of U.S. presidential politics, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; editorial board urged its readers not to vote for Donald Trump.

====2020s====
In October 2020, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; and &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; announced the dissolution of their decades-long Joint Operating Agreement to share printing facilities. With the end of the agreement, both publications were free to contract printing needs with third parties and chart their futures independent of each other. After the dissolution became apparent, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; made the decision to end its daily print edition beginning January 1, 2021 (after just over 153 years of daily publication). The daily print edition was replaced with a new weekly local edition and the company would continue to print the weekly national edition, &quot;Church News&quot;, and introduce the &quot;Deseret Magazine&quot;. Starting March 23, 2022, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; began publication of the semiweekly local edition, bringing print publication of their local edition to twice weekly.

In December 2020, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; editorial board again broke political neutrality by denouncing Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes&#x27;s decision to support a lawsuit requesting that the US Supreme Court withhold the certified vote count from four states following the 2020 presidential election.

In 2021, Utah&#x27;s Senator Mike Lee demanded a retraction after a statement attributed to him (regarding a phone call held during the January 6 United States Capitol attack), and published in the &quot;Deseret News&quot; on January 7, 2021, was brought up during the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump.

==Products==

===&quot;Deseret News&quot; website and app ===
The paper&#x27;s first website, DesNews.com, was launched on September 27, 1995. The domain was later changed to DeseretNews.com, and changed again in August 2019 to Deseret.com.

The &quot;Deseret News&quot; launched native iOS apps in December 2011. An Android version of the app was later released for the Google Play Store.

===&quot;Deseret News&quot; Local Edition===
The &quot;Deseret News&quot; Local Edition is published twice weekly.

===&quot;Deseret News&quot; National Edition===
The &quot;Deseret News&quot; National Edition is a national weekly print paper concentrating its reporting and feature articles on areas including family, faith, education, and other values core to the LDS faith. It is available for delivery throughout the United States.

===&quot;Deseret Magazine&quot;===
The &quot;Deseret News&quot; launched its monthly magazine in 2021, which publishes ten times a year with a double issue in July/August and January/February. The magazine covers the people and culture of the Deseret region (from the Sierras to the Rockies, from the border of Mexico to the Pacific Northwest) and its intersection with the broader world. It includes essays on politics, culture, and faith from local and national thought leaders as well as other narratives and profiles.

==Coverage of faith ==
In addition to coverage of Utah and the broader region, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; also publishes content under its &quot;Faith&quot; section that features stories related to religion, churches and places of worship, and topics that intersect with faith such as Supreme Court rulings and religious education. These topics cover the breadth of beliefs across the United States, including but not limited to the LDS Church. Previously, content under the &quot;Faith&quot; section included only news unrelated to the LDS Church, with news related to the LDS Church covered by &quot;Mormon Times&quot;.

===&quot;Church News&quot;===
The &quot;Deseret News&quot; also publishes a weekly compact-sized insert, the &quot;Church News&quot;. The &quot;Church News&quot; includes news of the LDS Church and has been published since 1931. From 1974 to 2013, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; also published the Church Almanac, an annual edition carrying LDS Church facts and statistics edited by &quot;Church News&quot; staff.

===&quot;Of Good Report&quot; / &quot;Mormon Times&quot;===
&quot;Mormon Times&quot; was created as a publication with its own independent circulation base and also as the Religion section of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; in January 2008. In July 2011, the &quot;Deseret News&#x27;s&quot; religion section was renamed &quot;Faith&quot;, with the &quot;Mormon Times&quot; label applying only to its LDS-themed content. Since then, the &quot;Mormon Times&quot; name has been retired with all content related to religion of all faiths publishing under the &quot;Faith&quot; section of the &quot;Deseret News.&quot;

On October 3, 2010, following the success of the &quot;Mormon Times&quot; in print and online, a TV series premiered summarizing stories from the print version of the &quot;Mormon Times&quot;, along with interviews, hosted by Michelle King. The show has since been retired.

On August 7, 2020, following policies established in 2018 to stop using terms like &quot;Mormon&quot;, etc., &quot;Mormon Times&quot; changed its name to &quot;Of Good Report&quot;. It&#x27;s currently exclusive to social media.

In the 1972–1986 period when Smart was the editor, Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson were among the presidents of the Deseret News Publishing Company.

====2010 restructuring====
Summer 2010 saw multiple changes both in leadership and structure at the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. A new Opinion Editor, Paul S. Edwards, was appointed. Edwards had previously been provost at Southern Virginia University and earlier a political science professor at Brigham Young University (BYU). Editor Joe Cannon and publisher Jim Wall stepped down.

During the summer of 2010 it was announced that the &quot;Deseret News&quot; for the first time ever would have a president and CEO; Clark Gilbert was appointed to this position. He was already CEO of Deseret Digital Media. Gilbert announced the future of &quot;Deseret News&quot; was leaner, and more online. In August 2010 he announced the layoffs of 85 staffers, 57 full-time and 28 part-time. It resulted in a reduction of 43% of the paper&#x27;s entire staff.

The &quot;Deseret News&quot; also created an editorial advisory board to work with Gilbert and Edwards; it consisted of people with a broad variety of backgrounds:
* Joseph Cannon, who had up until that time been the &quot;Deseret News&quot; editor.

* Firoz &quot;King&quot; Hussein, CEO of Span Construction and Engineering a native of India who did graduate studies at BYU, is a convert to the LDS Church
* Jane Clayson Johnson, Emmy-winning journalist and author.
* Jeffrey Max Jones, former senator and cabinet minister in Mexico
* Mary McConnell, curriculum consultant at Juan Diego Catholic High School in Draper, Utah, former Rhodes scholar and speech-writer for Caspar Weinberger
* Michael W. McConnell, former federal judge, current professor at Stanford Law School
* Gordon H. Smith, former US Senator
* Hannah Clayson Smith, lawyer with the Becket Fund, Princeton University and BYU Law School graduate, former clerk for Supreme Court Justices Alito and Thomas
* Catherine Stokes, former deputy director of the Illinois Department of Health, an African American from Chicago, graduate of DePaul University and long-time member of the LDS Church and Utah resident since 2006, active with the Utah Chapter of the African-American Genealogical and Historical Society

<text>Dianne Esther Cunningham (born December 5, 1939) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1988 to 2003, and a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

==Background==
Cunningham worked as an elementary school teacher in private life, and entered politics by winning a seat on the London, Ontario school board in 1973. She retained that position for fifteen years, and also served as a Planning Officer for the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services.

==Politics==
Cunningham was elected to the Ontario legislature for the riding of London North in a 1988 by-election. The riding had previously been Liberal, and bordered on the seat belonging to Liberal Premier David Peterson; Cunningham&#x27;s victory made her a rising star in the small Tory caucus. She ran for the leadership of the then third-place Conservatives in 1990, losing to Mike Harris in the party&#x27;s first one member, one vote election for leader. She was considered a Red Tory, but was hurt by comparisons to Brian Mulroney, Canada&#x27;s unpopular Progressive Conservative Prime Minister. Her loss to Harris led to a major shift in the political orientation of the party.

Cunningham was re-elected in the 1990 provincial election, which was won by the New Democratic Party. During the next five years, the Tories developed a series of right-wing policy initiatives which became known as the &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot;. Cunningham was not a major contributor to this process. She did, however, serve as her party&#x27;s Deputy Leader and Caucus Whip from 1990 to 1995.

She was easily re-elected in the 1995 provincial election, which the Tories won. While not in the Harris government&#x27;s inner circle, she was appointed to cabinet in the minor portfolios of Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Minister responsible for Women&#x27;s Issues. She retained these positions throughout the Harris government&#x27;s first term. In 1998, she supported Hugh Segal for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

In the provincial election of 1999, Cunningham narrowly defeated New Democratic Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Marion Boyd in the redistributed riding of London North Centre (the Harris government had previously reduced the number of provincial ridings from 130 to 103, forcing many MPPs to run against one another). Following the election, she was promoted to Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities, and retained that portfolio for the next four years. She was also re-appointed as Minister responsible for Women&#x27;s Issues on February 8, 2001. In 2002, she supported Ernie Eves to replace Mike Harris as party leader.

Cunningham was often criticized for the way her department managed the elimination of OAC levels from Ontario&#x27;s high-school system. The decision reduced the standard high-school honours degree program from five years to four, and resulted in a &quot;double cohort&quot; of new university students when the policy first came into effect. University entrance marks were raised to what some considered high levels; for example, the University of Western Ontario raised their entrance cutoff to an 80% average. Because of this, many students were unable to attend the university of their choice, and poor departmental planning was frequently blamed.

She ran for re-election in the 2003 election, but lost to Deb Matthews by over 6,000 votes in the landslide victory that brought the Ontario Liberal Party to power.

===Cabinet posts===

==Later life==
After the election, she was appointed Director of the Lawrence National Centre for Policy and Management.

<doc id="1046387" wikidata="Q7982838" url="?curid=1046387" title="Wendy Yoshimura">
<text>Wendy Masako Yoshimura (born January 17, 1943) is an American still life watercolor painter. She was a member of the leftist terrorist group the Symbionese Liberation Army during the mid-1970s. She was born in Manzanar, one of numerous World War II-era internment camps for Japanese Americans who were forced out of their homes and businesses along the West Coast. She was raised both in Japan and California&#x27;s Central Valley.

During her last year of art college, she encountered and became involved in radical politics as a result of meeting activist Willie Brandt. He founded the Revolutionary Army, another violent leftist organization, in Berkeley, California.

==Early life==
Yoshimura was born at the Manzanar Internment Camp for Japanese Americans where her American-born parents were incarcerated. All the family were American citizens by birth. After the war, the Yoshimura family moved to Etajima, a small island off the coast of Hiroshima. Her father worked for the Allied Occupation forces. Yoshimura spoke Japanese as her first language.

The family returned to the US when Yoshimura was 13 years old. Because she did not speak English, Yoshimura was initially placed in the second grade in the Fresno, California school system. She learned English rapidly and later graduated in 1969 from the California College of Arts and Crafts (now California College of the Arts).

===Revolutionary Army===
Yoshimura became associated with the Revolutionary Army, a group founded by her boyfriend, Willie Brandt. He used the title in public statements claiming responsibility for violent actions intended to express opposition to the Vietnam War. In 1972, police discovered a weapons and explosives cache in a Berkeley garage which Yoshimura had rented and described it as a &quot;massive bomb factory.&quot; They also found letters taking credit for planned future bombings targeting the University of California, Berkeley campus, including the Naval Architecture building. Notes described a specific plan to kidnap or assassinate World Bank President and former defense secretary Robert McNamara at his winter residence in Aspen, Colorado. Brandt and two others were arrested in Berkeley on March 31, 1972, and subsequently convicted.

Yoshimura evaded a police dragnet and fled California. She lived under an alias in New Jersey until 1974. In 1977, she was captured and convicted of unlawful possession of explosives, of a machine gun, and of substances and materials with the intent to make destructive devices and explosives. She was sentenced to a one-to-fifteen years in prison. She was released on parole in September 1980.

===Symbionese Liberation Army===
Also in 1974, married couple Bill and Emily Harris, with kidnapping victim-turned fugitive Patty Hearst, relocated to rural Pennsylvania. The Harrises were surviving founding members of the Berkeley terrorist group known as the Symbionese Liberation Army. Six of their members had died in a May 1974 shootout with Los Angeles police at a house in Los Angeles. Sports writer and political activist Jack Scott had helped the high-profile fugitives make their way east. He arranged for Yoshimura to join them and handle shopping and other public transactions.

After two months with the group, Yoshimura left and returned alone to California, taking up residence in San Francisco. Hearst and the Harrises found their own way back into the state and regrouped in Sacramento. When the FBI found Yoshimura&#x27;s thumbprint in the SLA&#x27;s rural hideout, newspaper headlines tied her to the group. She fled San Francisco and reunited with the SLA members in Sacramento.

While in Sacramento with associates from the San Francisco Bay Area, some of the fugitives planned and carried out an armed robbery of Crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California. Bank customer Myrna Opsahl was shot and killed. Hearst&#x27;s account in &quot;Every Secret Thing&quot; states that she and Yoshimura opposed the action and were assigned to &quot;switch cars&quot; far from the scene. After the robbery, the group abandoned Sacramento and fled individually to San Francisco.

===Arrest and conviction===


On September 18, 1975, Yoshimura was arrested with Hearst in a second-floor apartment at 625 Morse Street by FBI Special Agent Tom Padden and San Francisco Police Department Inspector Tim Casey. Padden and Casey failed to read Hearst and Yoshimura their Miranda rights and did not obtain a search warrant until twenty-six hours later. Weapons evidence, including a handgun in Yoshimura&#x27;s purse and a shotgun in the bedroom, was suppressed because of this oversight.

During Yoshimura&#x27;s trial, Japanese Americans who empathized with her family&#x27;s experience during World War II gave $150,000 to aid her legal defense conducted by the Asian Law Caucus, and led by Garrick Lew. They did this through the Wendy Yoshimura Fair Trial Committee.

Ultimately, Yoshimura was convicted on explosives and weapons charges and sent to state prison for six months; she was paroled in 1980.

===Grand jury investigation===
In 1991 Yoshimura was granted limited immunity to testify during a grand jury investigation into the 1975 armed bank robbery by the SLA in Carmichael, California in which Myrna Opsahl, 42-year-old mother of four, was killed. One SLA member, Michael Bortin, had pleaded guilty to the robbery. No indictments resulted at the time.

In 2002 five former SLA members and associates were arrested, and four of them pleaded guilty to charges related to the homicide.

==Present day==
Yoshimura is an artist and resides in north Oakland, California. She teaches water color painting at her studio and at a San Francisco community center. Her still-life watercolors are often displayed in the Bay Area.

==In media==

<doc id="1046389" wikidata="Q7123057" url="?curid=1046389" title="Packwood Lake">
<text>Packwood Lake is a freshwater lake in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in the Cascade Mountains of Washington. It is located near the town of Packwood and is a popular day hiking and overnight camping area. The southern half of the lake lies within the Goat Rocks Wilderness area.

The lake was named after William Packwood, an early settler.

==Geology==
Packwood Lake lies at approximately above sea level and about southeast of Mount Rainier. Its main source of water is glacier-fed Upper and Lower Lake Creeks, which descend from Old Snowy Mountain. The lake is approximately long and wide.

The lake is held in place by a natural dam. Approximately 1,200 years ago, Snyder Mountain, which borders the lake to the northwest, broke and slid down into the (then) Lake Creek valley, effectively plugging it and forming the lake. Maximum depth is approximately . The island in the lake is officially named Agnes Island, and also referred to by locals as both Wizard Island or Enchantment Island. The island is protected by the U.S. Forest Service and no landings are permitted there.

==Biology==
Packwood Lake is home to a genetically distinct species of rainbow trout. This trout has evolved for over a thousand years, separated from other populations of fish. It is known for its excellent taste, large size, and drab creamy coloring. Due to many years of stocking, however, the fish is becoming less and less prominent as its gene pool becomes diluted by stocked fish.

Also calling this lake home are several species of birds, including heron, bald eagle, and wood duck. Black bears are also fairly common, as are deer, elk, raccoon, cougar, and (in the higher elevations above the lake) mountain goats.

==History==

Packwood Lake has been used for several thousand years by Native Americans as summer quarters and hunting territory. Due to extremely cold winters and subsequent heavy snows, the area is considered largely uninhabitable during the winter.

Prospectors thoroughly searched the area of the lake in the early 1920s. Although some gold and silver was found, the small quantities and remoteness of the area proved mining to be not economical.

==Packwood Dam==
Packwood Lake was dammed in 1964 to produce electricity. There is a small 27-megawatt dam at the foot of the lake which has taken over the job of holding back the lake from the Snyder Mountain landslide. Great care was used when designing and building the dam so as not to affect the abundant wildlife that calls the lake and surrounding area home. The actual dam structure is only a couple of feet tall, creating only a small holding pond which feeds the penstock.

Water from Packwood Lake is also piped to the town of Packwood and supplies the greater Packwood area.

==Recreation==
Packwood lake is a popular hiking destination for both day hikers and campers. The trail leading to the lake, Packwood Lake Trail #78, is also a popular entrance to the Goat Rocks Wilderness and surrounding area. The lake is also used as a stopping ground for travellers headed to Mosquito and Lost Lakes to the north, and Gilbert Peak to the southeast.

An all-terrain vehicle trail (the &#x27;low trail&#x27;) was completed some years ago and offers ATV and horse access to the lake. The &#x27;upper trail&#x27; is reserved for hikers and horses. Both trails, upper and lower, are approximately 5 miles (8 km) to the lake from a well-maintained and paved parking lot. Continuing past the lake, hikers are offered hundreds of miles of trails covering breathtaking scenery, and the Pacific Crest Trail may be reached about 7 miles (11.3 km) beyond the lake.

The lake itself is a very popular fishing hole and may be fished from shore or paddle boat (motors are prohibited). Additionally, fishing with a two-pole endorsement is not allowed.

<doc id="1046392" wikidata="Q5928163" url="?curid=1046392" title="Huckster">
<text>A huckster is anyone who sells something or serves biased interests, using pushy or showy tactics. Historically, it meant any type of peddler or vendor, but over time it has assumed pejorative connotations.

==Etymology==
The original meaning of huckster is a person who sells small articles, either door-to-door or from a stall or small store, like a peddler or hawker. The term probably derives from the Middle English , meaning &quot;to haggle&quot;. The word was in use circa 1200 as &quot;&quot;huccsteress&quot;. During the medieval period, the word assumed the feminine word ending &quot;ster&quot;&quot; as in huck&quot;ster&quot;, reflecting the fact that most hucksters were women. The word assumed various spellings at different times: &quot;hukkerye&quot;, &quot;hukrie&quot;, &quot;hockerye&quot;, &quot;huckerstrye&quot; or &quot;hoxterye&quot;. The word was still in use in England in the 1840s, when it appeared as a black-market occupation. It is related to the Middle Dutch , and the Middle Low German , but appears earlier than any of these. In the United States, a connotation of trickery developed the huckster might trick others into buying cheap imitation products as if they were the real thing.

==Other meanings==
The term &quot;huckster&quot; was used in different ways across Europe and later ended up taking on different meanings at different times.

===In Scotland===

In Scotland, the term &quot;huckster&quot; referred to a person, usually a woman, who bought goods, watered them down, and resold them in tiny quantity to others who were too poor to buy quality products available at market value. These items tended to be in the poorer quality range, since economy was paramount. Scots burghs often felt the need to control hucksters because they operated without a stall, on the economic fringes. In particular, they were subject to accusations of forestalling, in this case, the practice of buying goods wholesale, &quot;before the stall&quot; and therefore before tax was paid.

===In England and Europe===

In England and Europe during the medieval period, the term &quot;huckster&quot; was synonymous with &quot;peddler.&quot; Hucksters and peddlers belonged to a broad group of resellers who purchased surplus stocks from weekly provincial markets and fairs and then resold them at larger daily markets or engaged in door-to-door selling.

As time passed, the distinction between hucksters and peddlers became more pronounced. During the medieval period, the term &quot;huckster&quot; came to refer to market-based food vendors, while peddlers referred to itinerant vendors of a wide range of merchandise. Hucksters were often women who dealt in low-priced goods such as meat, poultry, dairy, bread and baked goods, including pies and pastries. They sourced raw materials from their own holdings or purchased goods from other sellers and carried their products to the market place in baskets or on their heads. These women either lived in the market town or travelled into the market place from the surrounding area. Hucksters were at the bottom of the market hierarchy, both in terms of wealth and status, since they made only small returns.

Luca Clerici has made a detailed analysis of Vicenza’s food market during the sixteenth century. He found that there were many different types of reseller operating out of the markets. For example, in the dairy trade, cheese and butter was sold by the members of two craft guilds (i.e., cheesemongers who were shopkeepers) and that of the so-called &quot;resellers&quot; (hucksters selling a wide range of foodstuffs), and by other sellers who were not enrolled in any guild. Cheesemongers’ shops were situated at the town hall and were very lucrative. Resellers and peddlers increased the number of sellers, thus increasing competition, to the benefit of consumers. Direct sellers, who brought produce from the surrounding countryside, sold their wares through the central market place and priced their goods at considerably lower rates than cheesemongers.

===In 20th-century Philadelphia===

In Philadelphia, in the early 1900s, hucksters were seen as primarily men who came around with carts, horse or hand-drawn, of fresh produce. They made their presence known by crying out loud what they had to offer. In earlier Philadelphia dialect, to say &quot;like a huckster&quot; meant to be too loud in one&#x27;s speech.

==In literature and popular culture ==

The story &quot;The Goblin and the Grocer&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen implies that human nature is attracted to a state of happiness as represented by poetry and to sensual pleasure as represented by jam and butter at Christmas. Although the story has been mistakenly called &quot;The Goblin and the Huckster&quot;, it has nothing to do with that term (pejoratively). The Grocer, through his haggling and bargaining, is seen as industrious because he possesses the jam and butter (sensual pleasure), and the student is seen as poor but happy because he appreciates the beauty of poetry above all else. Meanwhile, the Grocer&#x27;s talkative wife and the cask in which are stored old newspapers both have plenty of authoritative knowledge to share but are paid little attention compared to the primal desires of humankind, which constantly compete for (the goblin&#x27;s) attention.

In the novel &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; by Walter Farley, the supporting character Tony is described as a huckster, in the sense that he works as a vegetable salesman in New York City&#x27;s smaller streets, selling from a horse-drawn cart. 

In science fiction fandom, the term &quot;huckster&quot; is used non-pejoratively to designate dealers in science fiction–related books, magazines and paraphernalia, particularly those who deal at science fiction conventions.

In the song &quot;There Only Was One Choice&quot; by Harry Chapin one line refers to huckster of belief.

In the 2022 song “Sweet Nothing” by Taylor Swift, she refers to “smooth-talking hucksters.”

<doc id="1046399" wikidata="Q1317186" url="?curid=1046399" title="JAL Express">
<text>, was an airline with its headquarters at Tokyo International Airport and in Ota-ku, Tokyo, Japan, and its main hub at Tokyo International Airport. It also maintained offices in the Japan Airlines Building in Shinagawa, Tokyo. Its operations included scheduled and non-scheduled passenger services to eight regional destinations across Japan. It also served 15 additional destinations in Japan, and two in the People&#x27;s Republic of China on behalf of Japan Airlines, under a wet-lease agreement.

JAL Express was a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan&#x27;s flag carrier, Japan Airlines and an affiliate member of the Oneworld alliance. It was founded April 1, 1997, and began operations with a Boeing 737-400 on July 1, 1998. It celebrated its tenth anniversary and first flight in April 2007 and July 2008, respectively. It operated its first international flight in May 2009, and flew to Hangzhou and Shanghai. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999, JAL Express, together with its sister airlines within the JAL Group, carried over 32 million passengers and over 1.1 million tons of cargo and mail.

The carrier ended operations on 30 September 2014 after being fully integrated with Japan Airlines.

== History ==
JAL Express (JEX) was established on April 1, 1997 as a wholly owned domestic subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines (JAL), with initial capital of ¥5.8 million. It operated scheduled passenger services to regional domestic destinations in Japan, as well as some low-demand flights for JAL under wet-lease agreement. It was also considered for services on the domestic trunk and short-haul international routes. On July 1, 1998, JAL Express commenced operations from Osaka to Miyazaki and Kagoshima with two Boeing 737-400s, non-Japanese cockpit crew, and short-term contracted cabin attendants. The airline&#x27;s cabin attendants, called &quot;Sky Cast&quot;, were responsible for cleaning the 150-seat cabin between flights.

The airline celebrated its one millionth passenger in June 2000 and commenced wet-lease operation for its parent JAL in December 2000. On 14 November 2002, JAL introduced a new aircraft livery design, &quot;The Arc of the Sun&quot;, across the JAL Group fleet. A reception to celebrate the completion of the first aircraft with the new design was held at the JAS M2 hangar. In April 2005, the McDonnell Douglas MD-81 was introduced to the airline fleet, with an all Economy Class configuration with 163 seats. JAL Express became an affiliate member of Oneworld on April 1, 2007, together with four of its sister airlines, in the alliance&#x27;s biggest expansion in its young history. On the same day, the airline celebrated its tenth anniversary of establishment.

JAL Express welcomed the arrival of the new Boeing 737-800 to its fleet in January 2008 and celebrated the tenth anniversary of its first flight in July 2008. It operated its first international flight in May 2009 under a wet-lease agreement with JAL.

On July 9, 2010, JAL Express pilot Ari Fuji became its first female airline flight captain.

As of March 27, 2011, all of JAL Express flights were being operated as JAL flights, until the full merger of the two carriers in September 2014.

<doc id="1046402" wikidata="Q3099671" url="?curid=1046402" title="Maya &amp; Miguel">
<text>Maya &amp; Miguel is an American children&#x27;s animated television series produced by Scholastic Productions. It aired on PBS Kids Go! from October 11, 2004, to October 10, 2007, and had a total of five seasons and 65 episodes over three years. The show also ran on Univision&#x27;s Saturday morning Planeta U block.

The series focuses on the lives of pre-teen Hispanic twins named Maya and Miguel Santos and their friends, the program is aimed at promoting multiculturalism and education. At various times throughout the episode, parts of the dialogue are in Spanish, but only individual words or phrases are then explained in English.

==Premise==
The show presents learning as fun, relevant and rewarding for all children, with a special emphasis on the Latino population. The show chronicles the adventures of two 10-year-old Latino siblings, Maya and Miguel Santos, as they figure out how to leave their stamp on the world around them, and features their relatives and diverse neighborhood friends. This show centers on Maya&#x27;s well-intentioned meddling in her family and friends&#x27; lives, ultimately creating new quandaries to fix. Their mother is from Mexico, and their father is from Puerto Rico. The underlying message is the importance of doing good for the family and community, and the philosophy that shared happiness is greater than personal gain. The show presents a positive, culturally rich portrayal of Latino families, languages and cultures. In some markets, each episode ends with Maya announcing, &quot;Here&#x27;s what some of our friends are up to,&quot; introducing live-action clips of children engaging and interacting in ways consistent with the show&#x27;s themes. Maya concludes episodes by exhorting viewers to &quot;visit your local library like &#x27;Maya &amp; Miguel&#x27;&quot;.

==Characters==
* Maya Santos (voiced by Candi Milo) is a sweet, gentle, and energetic Mexican, Hispanic and Puerto Rican girl. She always manages to include her twin brother and friends in her crazy adventures. Whenever Maya comes up with an idea, she always says &quot;¡Éso es!&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s it!&quot;) and her hair bubbles light up while her ponytail spins around; as shown in &quot;The Bet&quot; they will continue to glow until she says &quot;¡Éso es!&quot; She can sometimes be very stubborn, ignorant, and naive, and tends to get involved in other people&#x27;s business. Although her ideas often don&#x27;t go the way she plans them, they always accomplish their original objective in the end.
* Miguel Santos (voiced by Nika Futterman) is Maya&#x27;s twin brother. Miguel is slightly more practical and sensible than his sister, and enjoys playing soccer and video games. Every time Maya gets an idea, he gets a bad feeling about it. He knows Maya means well, but he thinks she gets more involved in other people&#x27;s problems than need be. He keeps track of Maya&#x27;s ideas that have gone wrong, which annoys Maya. However, he would sometimes admit that an idea of hers is the best idea yet. He has a crush on a girl named Kylie, who feels the same way.
* Theodore &quot;Theo&quot; McEwen (voiced by Jerod Mixon) is Miguel&#x27;s African-American best friend and soccer buddy. Theo loves sports as much as Miguel does. Theo often gets straight A&#x27;s in his classes, arguably making him the most intelligent of the kids. Theo is often the voice of reason among his friends.
* Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Lee (voiced by Lucy Liu) is Maya&#x27;s Chinese-American friend. She is very dramatic, kind, fashionable, and talented. She rarely disagrees with Maya&#x27;s ideas.
* Christine &quot;Chrissy&quot; Lum (voiced by Beth Payne) is Maya&#x27;s Dominican-American friend, and describes herself as Afro-Dominican. She is very sensitive and level-headed, though sometimes she can also be gullible. Chrissy tends to point out the flaws in Maya&#x27;s plans, similar to Miguel. She also loves animals.
* Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Arlington (voiced by Jeannie Elias) is another friend of Miguel&#x27;s. He is an English-American boy who was born with only one arm. Often seen in the background with Miguel and Theo, he likes to play soccer, basketball, and baseball. Andy moved to Maya and Miguel&#x27;s neighborhood from Wisconsin.
* Alberto &quot;Tito&quot; Chávez (voiced by Candi Milo) is Maya and Miguel&#x27;s cousin who moved to the US from Mexico with his parents. He lives in the same apartment complex. He admires his cousin Miguel; in the episode &quot;I&#x27;ve Got to Be &#x27;Mi-Guel&#x27;&quot; he is shown pretending to act as if he is Miguel. He loves to play soccer like the twins.
* Abuela Elena (voiced by Lupe Ontiveros) is Maya and Miguel&#x27;s maternal grandmother.
* Paco (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) is an anthropomorphic bilingual macaw who is the twins&#x27; pet, originally owned by their &quot;abuela&quot;. Most commonly heard saying &quot;Pretty Bird&quot; and &quot;What about Paco, what about Paco?&quot; He often gets loose, causing much trouble and confusion. Paco also often reacts to figures of speech, thinking they are real.
*Rosa Santos (voiced by Elizabeth Pena) is Santiago&#x27;s wife and Maya and Miguel&#x27;s mother who was originally from Mexico.
*Santiago Santos (voiced by Carlos Ponce) is Rosa&#x27;s husband and Maya and Miguel&#x27;s father who was originally from Puerto Rico.

<text>Songs and Views of the Magnetic Garden (1975/Catalyst 09026-61823-2 1993) is an album &quot;performed, synthesized, recorded, and mixed by Alvin Curran.&quot; Liner notes by Tim Page and Alvin Curran.
*&quot;This lush musical landscape, Alvin Curran&#x27;s first multi-media solo work, intertwines singing and synthesizer, drones and overtones, bells, gamelans, and sounds of nature—a unique tapestry of sound that eloquently introduces a fanciful and original American composer.&quot;
Curran says that he was encouraged by then recent solo works by Terry Riley, La Monte Young, Charlemagne Palestine, and Simone Forti, while AllMusic says the album recalls early electronic work involving tape loops, echo, and feedback, and resembles composers Riley, Pauline Oliveros, and Steve Reich.

*&quot;Curran interweaves the sounds of singing, nature, bells, gamelans, and synthesizers into what Page calls &#x27;New Age with brains...he&#x27;s one composer who can actually organize noise to the point that it becomes music.&#x27;&quot;
*&quot;Hearing his mid-1970s assemblages &quot;Songs And Views of the Magnetic Garden&quot; or &quot;Fiori Chiari Fiori Oscuri&quot; is like peering for the first time into Joseph Cornell&#x27;s boxed collages.&quot;
*&quot;Alvin Curran&#x27;s &#x27;Songs and Views of the Magnetic Garden&#x27; was a simmering stew of &quot;found&quot; sounds and minimalism.&quot;

The title will also be found as &quot;Songs and Views from the Magnetic Garden&quot;.

<text>Leung Yee-tai was a Wing Chun master of the late Qing Dynasty.

==Background==
Leung Yee-tai had become associated with Tiandihui and anti-Qing Dynasty resistance.

He was a strong boatman who steered a riverboat by pushing a long pole against the river bottom.
A Shaolin monk Chi Sin (至善禪師) saw that he was a natural successor to the Southern Shaolin pole fighting skill called &quot;six and a half point long pole&quot;.

He taught Wong Wah-bo his pole fighting skill in exchange for the Wing Chun fist-fighting skill. Though he was a student of Wong in Wing Chun, he was actually Wong&#x27;s sifu in the pole fighting skill. Wong modified the pole fighting skills using Wing Chun principles. The modified pole skill had since part of Wing Chun skills set.

He met Leung Jan of Foshan, a young herbal doctor, when he was sick. He then trained Leung Jan when he was already an old man at over sixty years of age. He went on to introduce Jan to Wong. Because both of Wong and Jan were from Gulao (古勞) Village, Wong imparted his full system of Wing Chun skills to him.

== Lineage ==
==In popular culture==
Leung Yee-tai was portrayed by Kong Ngai in the 1981 TVB television drama series &quot;Kung Fu Master of Fat Shan&quot;.

He was portrayed by Lam Ching-ying in the 1981 Sammo Hung film &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;.

In the 2005 TVB television drama series &quot;Real Kung Fu&quot;, he was portrayed by Bryan Leung.

<doc id="1046439" wikidata="Q4204973" url="?curid=1046439" title="Postage stamps and postal history of the Straits Settlements">
<text>The Straits Settlements of the Malayan Peninsula have a postal history distinct from the other Malayan areas.

== Early postal arrangements ==

Mail was originally handled privately by passing ships; the earliest known postal markings date from around 1806, used by a post office on Prince of Wales Island (now Penang).

== Stamps of British India and Burma ==
Service was regularised by the Indian Post Office Act of 1837, by which the East India Company was granted a monopoly of the mail services. All private vessels were required to carry letters at prescribed rates for postage. Handstamps were applied to preadhesive ship letters. Postage stamps of India were used from 1854, the Settlements being considered part of the &quot;Bengal circle&quot;, then from 1861 they became part of the &quot;Burma circle&quot;. The cancellations used were B/109 at Malacca, B/147 at Penang, and B/172 at Singapore.

== First stamps ==

When the Settlements became a crown colony in 1867, they began issuing their own stamps, not least because they adopted a currency based on 96 cents to a silver dollar. Beginning on 1 September 1867, nine types in the existing stocks of Indian stamps were overprinted with a crown and a new value in cents. Then, stamps printed by De La Rue for the Settlements started arriving in December; they are notable for a prominent white frame around the profile of Victoria, inscribed &quot;STRAITS SETTLEMENTS POSTAGE&quot;. The set of nine values, 2c to 96c, appeared gradually, with the 30c value not being issued until 1872.

Shortages from 1879 through 1882 necessitated the production of various surcharges, until new 5c and 10c stamps arrived in January 1882. Additional surcharges appeared regularly until the end of the century.

== Key plates ==
In 1892, key plate stamps went on sale, a number of them printed in two colours. A notable feature of this issue is the $5 stamp issued in 1898. The accession of King Edward VII necessitated new stamps in 1902, still in a key plate design, supplemented in 1903 with a design using oval vignette.

== Twentieth century ==
The island of Labuan was incorporated into the colony in 1907, the remainder of Labuan Colony&#x27;s stamps were overprinted &quot;STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.&quot;, some with new denominations. In 1910 new stamps appeared with values of $25 and $500 (although available for postage, their more usual use was fiscal). George V replaced Edward VII on stamps beginning in 1912, reusing the frames and replacing only the vignettes. These stamps were overprinted in 1922 to mark the Malaya-Borneo Exhibition. The Straits Settlements also joined in the Silver Jubilee issue for George V in 1935. The last issue of the Straits Settlements was the 1937 George VI series. 

== World War II ==

In March 1942, Japan issued stamps for their occupation, by overprinting existing stamps with Japanese inscriptions. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the British military administration issued provisionals by overprinting Straits Settlements stamps with &quot;BMA / MALAYA&quot;. These stamps were used until 1948, when stamps were produced for Singapore, Penang and Malacca. The Straits Settlements was dissolved in 1946, with Singapore becoming a separate Crown colony, while Penang and Malacca joined the new Malayan Union.

<text>Fabrication Defect (&quot;Com Defeito de Fabricação&quot;) is an album by the Brazilian musician Tom Zé, released in 1998. It is a concept album about the likelihood of humans becoming androids due to the forces of economic manipulation; &quot;genetic defects&quot;, like the desire to dance, are the only things preventing the transformation.

Zé supported the album by touring with Tortoise as his backing band. A remix EP, &quot;Postmodern Platos&quot;, was released in 1999.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; thought that the album &quot;exhibits a symphonic precision rare in music of such percussive complexity.&quot; &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; called the album &quot;a stunning return,&quot; writing that Zé is &quot;perhaps the last Brazilian Tropicalista to remain totally true to his iconoclastic roots.&quot; 

The &quot;Orange County Register&quot; stated that &quot;Fabrication Defect&quot; &quot;showcases [Zé&#x27;s] off-kilter cultural cut &#x27;n&#x27; paste style in which everything from a &#x27;rubber balloon on tooth&#x27; to bottles can become a musical instrument.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; concluded that &quot;Zé doesn&#x27;t simply cut and paste digital bits together into a martial disco beat, preferring unlikely material displacements of musique concrète.&quot;

AllMusic wrote that &quot;the album is a fragmented blend of skittish acoustic guitars, booming electronic rhythms, shouted slogans, bizarre found-sound tape loops, and near-psychedelic production tricks.&quot;

<text>In medicine, malaise is a feeling of general discomfort, uneasiness or lack of wellbeing and often the first sign of an infection or other disease. It is considered a vague termdescribing the state of simply not feeling well. The word has existed in French since at least the 12th century.

The term is often used figuratively in other contexts, in addition to its meaning as a general state of angst or melancholia.

== Cause ==
Malaise is a non-specific symptom and can be present in the slightest ailment, such as an emotion (causing fainting, a vasovagal response) or hunger (light hypoglycemia), to the most serious conditions (cancer, stroke, heart attack, internal bleeding, etc.).

Malaise expresses a patient&#x27;s uneasiness that &quot;something is not right&quot; that may need a medical examination to determine the significance.

Malaise is thought to be caused by the activation of an immune response, and the associated pro-inflammatory cytokines.

==Figurative use==
&quot;Economic malaise&quot; refers to an economy that is stagnant or in recession (compare depression). The term is particularly associated with the 1973–75 United States recession. An era of American automotive history, centered around the 1970s, is similarly called the &quot;malaise era.&quot;

The &quot;Crisis of Confidence&quot; speech made by US President Jimmy Carter in 1979 is commonly referred to as the &quot;malaise speech&quot;, although the word itself was not actually in the speech.

<doc id="1046450" wikidata="Q2912782" url="?curid=1046450" title="Proconsul">
<text>A proconsul was an official of ancient Rome who acted on behalf of a consul. A proconsul was typically a former consul. The term is also used in recent history for officials with delegated authority.

In the Roman Republic, military command, or &quot;imperium&quot;, could be exercised constitutionally only by a consul. Only two consuls served at a time, each elected to a one-year term. They could not normally serve two terms in a row; if a military campaign was in progress at the end of a consul&#x27;s term, the consul in command might have his command prorogued, allowing him to continue in command. This custom allowed for continuity of command despite the high turnover of consuls. In the Roman Empire, proconsul was a title held by a civil governor and did not imply military command.

In modern times, various officials with notable delegated authority have been referred to as proconsuls. Studies of leadership typically divide leaders into policymakers and subordinate administrators. The proconsul occupies a position between these two categories. Max Weber classified leadership as traditional, rational-legal (bureaucratic), and charismatic. A proconsul could be both a rule-following bureaucrat and charismatic personality. The rise of bureaucracy and rapid communication has reduced the scope for proconsular freelancing.

==Etymology==

The Latin word &quot;prōconsul&quot; is a shortened form of &quot;prō consule&quot;, meaning &quot;(one acting) on behalf of the consul.&quot; It appears on inscriptions beginning in 135 BC. Ancient historians describe Quintus Publilius Philo, the first proconsul, as acting &quot;prō consule&quot; for 326 BC. For later proconsuls, the same sources use the shortened form.

==Roman Republic==
A proconsul was endowed with full consular authority outside the city of Rome. Cicero notes that this did not include the right to consult auguries: &quot;Our ancestors would not undertake any military enterprise without consulting the auspices; but now, for many years, our wars have been conducted by pro-consuls and propraetors, who do not have the right to take auspices.&quot;

The position was created to deal with a constitutional peculiarity of the Roman Republic. Only a consul could command an army, but the high turnover of consuls could disrupt continuity of command. If a consul&#x27;s term ended in the midst of a campaign, he could be prorogued and continue to command.

Quintus Publilius Philo was one of two consuls for the year 327 BC. When his term expired at the end of the year, his army was in the midst of besieging the city of Neapolis (modern Naples). Rather than risk a change of command at such a delicate moment, the people voted that he should &quot;conduct the campaign in place of a consul (&quot;prō consule&quot;)&quot; after his term expired. Publilius thus became the first proconsul.

With territorial expansion beyond Italy and the annexation of territories as Roman provinces, the proconsul became one of two types of Roman provincial governors. The other was the propraetor.

In theory, proconsuls held delegated authority and acted on behalf of the consuls. In practice, a proconsulship was often treated as an extension of a consul&#x27;s term. This extension applied only outside the city walls of Rome. It was an extension of the military command of the consul, but not of his public office.

As the number of Roman legions was increased, there was a need to increase the number of military commanders. The office of the praetor was introduced in 366 BC. The praetors were the chief justices of the city. They were also given &quot;imperium&quot; so that they could also command an army.

During the Second Samnite War, Rome increased the number of her legions. The position of propraetor was instituted. These were praetors whose &quot;imperium&quot; was extended and were given the task to command a reserve army. Propraetors had the power to command one army, whereas proconsuls had the power to command two armies.

In 307 BC, Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, who was consul the previous year, was elected as proconsul to conduct the campaign in Samnium. During the Third Samnite War (298–290 BC) the consuls of the previous year, Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus and Publius Decius Mus, were given a six-month extension of their authority to carry on the war in Samnium. In 291 BC Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges had his command extended and to carry out mop up operations towards the end of the war. He defeated the Pentri, the largest Samnite tribe.

There were two republican proconsuls who did not previously hold the position of consul. During the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) Scipio Africanus volunteered to lead the second Roman expedition against the Carthaginians in Spain. He was too young to have been a consul. He was made proconsul by a vote of the Popular Assembly. When Scipio left Spain after his victory in 205 BC, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus were sent as commanders without public office (&quot;sine magistratus&quot;). This was done because Manlius Acidinus had not been a consul before.

As Rome acquired territory, the need for provincial governors grew. The province of Sicily was created in 241 BC, while Corsica and Sardinia was created in 238 BC. In 227 BC, two praetors were assigned the administration of these two provinces. Two more praetors were added when the provinces of Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior were created in 197 BC. After this, no praetors were added even when the number of provinces increased. It became customary to extend the authority of consuls and the praetors at the end of their annual terms. The provinces were assigned by lot to proconsuls and propraetors. The proconsuls were assigned the provinces which contained the larger number of troops.

Under Lex Sempronia, enacted in 123 BC, the senate determined the allocation of the provinces before the next consular elections. In 81 BC, Sulla added two praetors so that the two proconsuls and six propraetors could be assigned to govern the ten provinces Rome ruled at that time. Sulla made the governorships annual and required the holder to leave the province within thirty days after the arrival of his successor.

In 67 BC, Pompey received extraordinary powers and an unprecedented multiyear proconsulship to deal with the problem of piracy. The &quot;first triumvirate&quot; of Julius Caesar, Pompey and Crassus also received multiyear proconsulships in 59 BC. Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was also granted this power in 38 BC.

==Roman Empire==
Under the Republic, consuls and proconsuls had raised and commanded armies loyal to themselves. Augustus, Rome&#x27;s first emperor, replaced these essentially private armies with a standing imperial army. The consuls and proconsuls lost their military authority, but the titles retained considerable prestige.

The provinces were divided between imperial provinces, which were under the jurisdiction of the emperor, and senatorial provinces, which were under the jurisdiction of the senate. The imperial provinces were mostly the border provinces, where most of the legions were stationed. This allowed the emperor to retain control of the army. In the senatorial provinces, the governors were called proconsuls. Tenure was generally restricted to one year.

According to Suetonius:
Augustus decreed that the governors of the senatorial provinces would receive the title proconsul, regardless of whether they had served as praetor or consul. These were chosen by lot, with the result ratified by the Senate. In the imperial provinces, the emperors appointed governors who held the title of &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot;, or pro-praetor, regardless of what position they had held previously.

A passage in the New Testament notes that cases might be judged by a proconsul: &quot;If therefore Demetrius and the artisans with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges there against one another.&quot;

&quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, an early fifth-century imperial chancery document, mentions three proconsuls but no propraetors. These outranked vicars in precedence, though administratively they were subordinates like all governors. They governed the provinces of: Asia, comprising the central part of the western Anatolian coast; Achaea, comprising the Peloponnese and most of Central Greece; and Africa, the northern part of modern Tunisia.

==In leadership theory==
Although &quot;proconsul&quot; is an official title only with respect to magistrates of ancient Rome, the word has also been applied to various British, U.S., and French officials. In the modern context, it is rarely a compliment. The terms &quot;satrap&quot; (from Persian) and &quot;viceroy&quot; (from French) are both used in a similar way.

Despite the gulf between ancient and modern proconsuls, writer Carnes Lord has proposed a single definition to allow the phenomenon to be analyzed in the context of leadership theory: &quot;delegated political-military leadership that rises in the best case to statesmanship.&quot; South African historian John Benyon defines a proconsul as a leader with &quot;semi-independent and extraordinary capacity to shape the periphery&quot; of an empire.

Modern writing on leadership tends to stress the distinction between &quot;administration&quot; on the one hand and &quot;policy&quot; on the other. This emphasis can be traced to an essay by Woodrow Wilson written in the late 19th century. In earlier epochs, it was common for leaders to combine the two roles. Since this is no longer the case, specific terminology is required to describe such officials.

In his classic study, Max Weber distinguished among three modes of legitimate governance: traditional, rational-legal, and charismatic. In the form of bureaucracy, the rational-legal mode is dominant in the modern world. But a modern proconsul may also resort to aristocratic, or charismatic, leadership.

In the Roman Republic, a proconsul was typically a former consul and thus an experienced commander-in-chief. Having held the Republic&#x27;s highest office, he was a statesman as well as an administrator. Rome&#x27;s patrician class was prepared to exercise aristocratic leadership, both civil and military.

Several factors are said to limit the scope of proconsular authority in modern times. Democracies put the military under civilian authority and tend to avoid policymaking by military leaders. Modern government emphasizes bureaucracy and rulemaking, while the Romans were aristocratic. Finally, modern communications allows for greater central control.

Although transoceanic telegraph lines were laid by the mid-19th century, Lord describes the late 19th century as the heyday of British proconsular authority. Lord Curzon in India, Frederick Lugard in Nigeria, Cecil Rhodes in South Africa, and Lord Cromer in Egypt all took imperial initiatives that London approved only reluctantly. As ruler of Japan and Korea after World War II, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur consciously modeled himself on a Roman aristocrat.
The role of U.S. General David Petraeus and others in Iraq suggests a continued need for proconsular leadership, according to Lord. Modern technology makes communication easier than ever. But as email and Power Point presentations proliferate, clarity and intellectual discipline is lost. Another factor is that civilian policymakers, whether on the spot or in the metropole, may lack the skills needed to manage military forces. Yet proconsuls are at best an &quot;ad hoc&quot; solution to a reoccurring problem. Managing a large territory in occupation or conflict requires a range of skills and the ability to deal with various organizations. No one is trained as a proconsul and the available administrators have experience in at most one relevant agency or service. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. attempted to deal with this issue by creating an integrated civilian-military command structure called Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS).

==British Empire==

British colonial officials sometimes referred to as proconsuls include Alfred Milner in South Africa, Lord Curzon in India, Lord Lugard in Nigeria, and Lord Kitchener in Egypt and Sudan. These leaders were able to take imperial initiatives even when the government in London was reluctant. Conservative and Unionist governments were notably more tolerant of such freelancing than Liberal governments were. These proconsuls ruled in the age of the transoceanic telegraph, so rapid communication did not end proconsular independence.

==United States==
Various American commanders and ambassadors have been referred to as proconsuls. Writer Carnes Lord discusses the following figures in the framework of proconsular authority:
*William Howard Taft in the Philippines (1900–1903)
*Leonard Wood in Cuba
*Lucius D. Clay in Germany
*Douglas MacArthur in South Korea
*Edward Lansdale, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., Creighton Abrams, Ellsworth Bunker, and William Colby in South Vietnam
*Wesley Clark in Bosnia in 1994–99
*Paul Bremer in Iraq in 2003 
*David Petraeus in Iraq in 2004–08 and Afghanistan in 2010–11

<text>The Vire () is a river in Normandy, France whose course crosses the &quot;départements&quot; of Calvados and Manche, flowing through the towns of Vire, Saint-Lô and Isigny-sur-Mer, finally flowing out into the English Channel. Its main tributaries are the Aure, the Elle and the Souleuvre.

The outflow of the Vire has been canalized and forms the port of Isigny-sur-Mer.

The poets of the Vire valley (&quot;Vau de Vire&quot;) are said to have given rise to vaudeville.

Places along the river:
* Calvados (14) : Vire, Pont-Farcy, Isigny-sur-Mer
* Manche (50) : Tessy-sur-Vire, Troisgots, Torigni-sur-Vire, Condé-sur-Vire, Sainte-Suzanne-sur-Vire, Saint-Lô, Rampan, Pont-Hébert, La Meauffe, Cavigny

==Hydrology and water quality==
The generally brownish waters of the Vire are moderately alkaline having been tested by Lumina Tech as pH 8.31. The river waters are relatively turbid, with a Secchi disc measurement of 12 centimetres.

==Historical significance==
At the turn of the 10th century, the territorial lands of the Kingdom of Brittany had been expanded up to the Vire by their king Alan I.

<text>BYU Cougars men&#x27;s soccer is an American soccer team based in Provo, Utah, United States. The club has won eleven NIRSA national championships, and it is the only university sponsored soccer program to have ever purchased a franchise, competing in the Premier Development League (now known as USL League Two) from 2003 to 2017. It has since returned to club competition with NIRSA, and the team plays its home games at The Stadium at South Field on the campus of Brigham Young University. The team&#x27;s colors are dark blue and white.

==History==
Men&#x27;s soccer has had a presence at BYU dating back to 1955, when Carl and Harold Boden – two brothers who had recently moved from Germany to attend the school – placed an ad in the student newspaper and gathered enough players together to start a team. They joined the Utah Soccer League the following year, and began playing teams from around the state of the Utah. The university officially sanctioned soccer as a club sport in 1963.

The team received a major boost in 1969 with the arrival of former Italian soccer star Bruno Gerzeli, who had 14 seasons of experience as a professional player in Europe and South America. Gerzeli had become a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1966 while living in Canada, and moved to Utah shortly thereafter. His coaching helped BYU secure the Daynes Cup, the top soccer trophy in the state, in 1970. He also provided some international exposure by arranging for the team to take a 22-day tour of his native Italy in 1974. That same year BYU installed new coach Shavji “Jim” Dusara, who had served as head coach of the national soccer team of Tanzania during Olympic qualifying in 1968 and 1972. Dusara continued the trend of building BYU soccer with players from foreign countries, in addition to local talent from Utah and other parts of the United States. The team won the Daynes Cup for the second time in 1976.

The BYU men&#x27;s soccer team officially joined the NCAA in 1978. Then known as the “SoccerCats”, the team showed well in their first season, defeating rival Utah 3-0 and eventually finishing in second place in the WAC tournament. The program then proceeded to win the tournament in the following three consecutive seasons (1979 to 1981). Dusara guided the team as head coach until 1987, when he was controversially dismissed by BYU&#x27;s athletic administration, and the men&#x27;s soccer program was dropped from NCAA status.

With the end of NCAA competition, BYU&#x27;s men&#x27;s soccer team found significant success at the club level. The Cougars won NCSA national titles in 1993 and 1995 prior to moving to NIRSA. There, they continued to dominate the Collegiate Club Soccer Championships, winning national titles in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001, including an unprecedented run of 30 straight victories at the Club National Championships.

In 2001, BYU participated in its first international tour as a club team. The Cougars traveled for 10 days throughout Europe, playing 6 games in Spain and the Netherlands. BYU compiled a 4-1-1 record, with games in Spain against Vallecas CF, Rayo Vallecano reserves, and FC Barcelona reserves, and in the Netherlands against FC Sittard and . In 2002, they spent 6 days in Pachuca and Mexico City playing 4 games against the various reserve teams of C.F. Pachuca and Cruz Azul, compiling a 2–2 record.

Paralleling their efforts to increase the level of competition, BYU left the collegiate club division of soccer, and purchased a franchise in the Premier Development League (now known as USL League Two), where they began play in May 2003. Part of the United Soccer Leagues system, the league provided year-round competition and cost $40,000 to enter. BYU became the only university-sponsored soccer program to purchase a franchise and compete at a level considered higher than NCAA soccer in the pyramid of U.S. soccer development. Their first season in the PDL saw BYU in the Southwest Division, competing against traditionally strong southern California sides such as Orange County Blue Star and Southern California Seahorses. The team won 3–0 over the Nevada Wonders in their first game, but finished their first season with a 2–13–1 record.

BYU finished 4th in their second and third PDL seasons. In 2006, BYU was realigned to the Northwest Division, and qualified for their first U.S. Open Cup and their first playoffs. In 2007, the Cougars won their first divisional title, but the following year the team fell back to 4th place. BYU realigned to the PDL&#x27;s Southwest Division in 2009 following the league&#x27;s expansion in the Pacific Northwest, and they finished fourth in the table, three points out of the playoffs. BYU&#x27;s tough time in the Southwest continued in 2010, a season in which the Cougars won just four games.

In 2017, it was announced that the team would leave the PDL after 15 seasons to return to club status, and the club finished the season with its sixth NIRSA National Championship. The following year, the team would have their worst NIRSA National Tournament performance after losing to eventual national champions Florida 1–0 in the quarterfinals of the 2018 tournament. 

On November 23, 2019, the Cougars faced the 2014 National Champions Ohio State in the 2019 NIRSA National Championship. Ohio State and BYU whom are perennial power houses entered the match with a 18-1-0 record and a 16-1-0 record respectively. The Buckeyes took a 1–0 lead in the 8th minute, but the Cougars responded shortly after with a penalty kick in the 14th minute. The Cougars then made it 2–1 in the 24th minute of the match. In the 28th minute the Buckeyes were reduced to 10 men following a red card. The Cougars entered half-time with the 2–1 advantage. Although the Buckeyes were down a player, they kept the pressure on BYU for majority of the 2nd half. The Cougars defense made spectacular efforts to keep the game only 2–1, after weathering numerous set pieces from the Buckeyes. As the Buckeyes continued to push more numbers forward in search for an equalizer, BYU sealed the game in the 80th minute off a counterattack to make the game 3–1, and ultimately giving BYU their 7th National Championship.

Following the 2020 season that was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, BYU would go on to win the following four consecutive tournaments, extending their national championship total to 11 and winning a historic five-straight titles, winning every game in that streak except a 0–0 draw against Notre Dame in their 2021 tournament opener.

<text>The white-winged snowfinch (Montifringilla nivalis), or snowfinch, is a small passerine bird. Despite its name, it is a sparrow rather than a true finch.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the white-winged snowfinch in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen but without specifying where it had been collected. He used the French name and the Latin &quot;Fringilla nivalis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the white-winged snowfinch. Linnaeus included a brief description, used the binomial name &quot;Fringilla nivalis&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. Linnaeus listed the type location as &quot;America&quot;. The type location was subsequently designated as Switzerland. The specific name &quot;nivalis&quot; is Latin for &#x27;snowy&#x27; or &#x27;snow-white&#x27;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Montifringilla&quot; that was introduced by the German ornithologist Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1828.

Seven subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;M. n. nivalis&quot; – south Europe
* &quot;M. n. leucura&quot; – south and east Turkey
* &quot;M. n. alpicola&quot; – the Caucasus and north Iran to Afghanistan
* &quot;M. n. gaddi&quot; – southwest Iran
* &quot;M. n. tianshanica&quot; – east Kazakhstan and north Tajikistan
* &quot;M. n. groumgrzimaili&quot; – northwest China to central Mongolia
* &quot;M. n. kwenlunensis&quot; – west central China and north Tibet

==Description==
The white-winged snowfinch is a large stocky snowfinch at in length. It has brown upperparts, white underparts and a grey head. There is a long narrow white wing panel. In summer, the bill is black, and there is a black bib. The bib is lost in winter and the bill becomes yellow. Sexes are similar.
In flight, it shows black wings with huge white wing panels, and a white edged black tail. This bird has a chattering song with many trills, and variety of rolling or creaky calls.
==Distribution and habitat==
It is a resident breeding species on bare mountains, typically above , across southern Europe (Pyrenees, Alps, Corsica, Balkans) and through central Asia to western China. It nests in crevices or rodent burrows, laying 3–4 eggs.

==Behaviour==

The white-winged snowfinch&#x27;s food is mainly seeds with some insects. It is fearless, and will forage around ski resorts. It is hardy, and rarely descends below even in hard winter weather.

<text>Scott Bruce Rolen (born April 4, 1975) is an American former professional baseball third baseman. He played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Toronto Blue Jays, and Cincinnati Reds from 1996 to 2012.

A seven-time All-Star, Rolen started his career with the Phillies, where he was named the 1997 National League Rookie of the Year. Rolen became known for two iconic postseason home runs with the Cardinals: a go-ahead hit off Roger Clemens in Game 7 of the 2004 NLCS and a Game 1 homer off Justin Verlander in the 2006 World Series. Regarded as one of the best defensive third basemen of all time, Rolen won eight Gold Glove Awards over his career, the fourth-most among third basemen. In 2023, Rolen was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Rolen was born in Evansville, Indiana, and attended Jasper High School in Jasper, Indiana. During his senior year at Jasper in 1993, he was named Indiana Mr. Baseball. He was also named to the Indiana high school basketball All-Star team.

==Career==
=== Draft and minor leagues (1993–1996) ===
After a flurry of scholarship offers came in from schools like Oklahoma State and the University of Alabama, Rolen ultimately committed to playing college basketball for the Georgia Bulldogs. That commitment was complicated when the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB) selected Rolen in the second round of the 1993 MLB Draft. 

Rolen told reporters after the draft that he hoped he could forge a deal that would allow him to play for the Phillies farm system in the summer and on the Georgia basketball team in the winter. On July 22, however, Rolen chose to forego his commitment to Georgia to sign with the Phillies and focus on baseball; he was subsequently assigned to the Rookie-level Martinsville Phillies of the Appalachian League. He played 25 games in his first season of professional baseball, batting .313 with five doubles and 12 runs batted in (RBIs) in 80 at bats.

After attending spring training with the Phillies, Rolen opened the 1994 season with the Low A Spartanburg Phillies of the South Atlantic League. While his offensive metrics in Spartanburg were strong, batting .295 with 10 home runs, 30 doubles, and 61 RBIs by the last week of August, Rolen&#x27;s 35 defensive errors in that same span caused concern among sports analysts. Manager Roy Majtyka defended Rolen&#x27;s defensive performance, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen bad hops that hit him in the head be ruled an error. It&#x27;s a joke. I honestly think you could take half of them away.&quot; Rolen was named Spartanburg&#x27;s Most Valuable Player after batting .294 with 14 home runs and 72 RBIs, but he &quot;wasn&#x27;t satisfied with anything [he] did&quot;, telling reporters after the season, &quot;I need to improve my entire game.&quot; When the minor league season concluded, Rolen participated in the 1994 Florida Instructional League to continue honing his sport.

As a minor league baseball player, Rolen was unaffected by the 1994–95 MLB strike, and he reported that April to the Class A-Advanced Clearwater Phillies of the Florida State League. He missed the first part of the season, however, with a fractured hook of hamate on his glove hand that required surgery. He was activated from the disabled list on June 6, hitting two home runs against the Brevard County Manatees in his first game back after the injury. The injury appeared to help Rolen&#x27;s offensive performance, as it was less painful for him to hit a pitch well inside the strike zone than outside of it. After hitting .290 with ten home runs and 39 RBIs in 238 at bats in Clearwater, Rolen was promoted to the Double-A Reading Phillies of the Eastern League on August 16. He played in an additional 20 games after his promotion, batting .290 with three home runs and 15 RBIs in 76 at bats.

Rather than promoting Rolen directly to the major leagues, the Phillies chose to keep him in Reading for the start of the 1996 season, with Todd Zeile playing third base in Philadelphia. After recording nine home runs and 42 RBIs while leading the Eastern League by a .361 average, 83 hits, 22 doubles, a .568 slugging percentage, and 33 extra-base hits in 61 games for Reading, Rolen was promoted to the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the International League on June 13. Rolen&#x27;s promotion coincided with a difficult stretch for the Phillies, and the team began planning at the end of June to call him up to Philadelphia after the All-Star Game break. He batted .274 in 45 games for Scranton, with two home runs and 19 RBIs in 168 at bats.

=== Philadelphia Phillies (1996–2002) ===
Rather than taking advantage of the MLB trading deadline to acquire new players for the struggling team, the Phillies chose to promote Rolen for his MLB debut on August 1, 1996. He debuted for the first game of a doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals, recording his first major league hit and error in the 2–1 Phillies victory. Rolen&#x27;s first two home runs came on August 21 in a 6–0 shutout of the Los Angeles Dodgers. What should have been Rolen&#x27;s rookie season came to a premature end on September 7, when he suffered a fractured right ulna after being hit by a pitch from Steve Trachsel in a 4–2 Philadelphia victory over the Chicago Cubs. Rolen finished the season batting .254 with four home runs and 18 RBIs in 130 at bats, the maximum threshold to be considered a rookie for the 1997 season. Had Rolen not fractured his arm in his final plate appearance, he would have been considered a 1996 rookie, but a hit by pitch does not count as an at bat, thus preserving his eligibility for the following season.

In the next season, he was named National League Rookie of the Year, becoming the first Phillie since Dick Allen in to win the award. In 1998, he won his first of eight Gold Glove awards. Only Hall of Famers Brooks Robinson (16) and Mike Schmidt (10), plus current Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado (10) have more at third base. Rolen was supposed to be one of the key pieces in the Phillies&#x27; revival. However, claiming that management was not trying hard enough to win, as well as having constant friction with manager Larry Bowa, Rolen demanded a trade. He was nearly traded to the Cincinnati Reds for prospect Brandon Larson, but the Reds&#x27; president John Allen killed the deal over financial concerns. Instead, on July 29, 2002, Philadelphia traded Rolen and Doug Nickle to the St. Louis Cardinals for Plácido Polanco, Mike Timlin, and Bud Smith. On September 25, 2002, Rolen signed an eight-year, $90 million extension with the Cardinals. Rolen was represented in negotiations by ACES Inc.

=== St. Louis Cardinals (2002–2007) ===

Rolen&#x27;s season was one of his best. For much of the season, he led the National League in RBIs, often ranked among the league leaders in most offensive statistics, and had the highest vote total of any player for the All-Star Game. Despite being injured for the last stretch of the season, he finished the year with a career-high .314 batting average, 34 home runs, and 124 RBIs. He finished fourth in the National League MVP voting. Rolen, along with Albert Pujols and Jim Edmonds earned the nickname &quot;MV3&quot; for their outstanding 2004 seasons. The 2004 Cardinals won the National League Central Division with 105 wins. Rolen&#x27;s two-run home run in the sixth inning of Game 7 of the NLCS against Roger Clemens won the National League pennant for St. Louis by defeating the Astros in seven games. However, the Boston Red Sox swept the Cardinals in four games to win the 2004 World Series.

On May 10, 2005, Rolen injured his shoulder in a collision with Dodgers first baseman Hee-Seop Choi and was placed on the disabled list two days later. He was expected to be out of action for up to six weeks. On May 13, he underwent shoulder surgery; an additional MRI revealed a tear in the labrum. He eventually opted to have season-ending surgery on his shoulder in August, rather than attempt to let it heal on its own and return for the playoffs. He finally returned to full-time duties in 2006, a year in which Rolen was one of six nominees for the National League Comeback Player of the Year award. He finished 2006 hitting .292, hitting 22 home runs and 95 RBIs. Rolen and the Cardinals won the 2006 World Series over the Detroit Tigers, with Rolen most notably hitting a game-tying home run in Game 1. On September 15, 2006, Rolen set a personal record for RBIs in a game with 7 in a 14–4 win against the San Francisco Giants, hitting two home runs.

The next year, however, Rolen faced more injury woes. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 31, 2007, because of his recurring left shoulder problems. On September 11, Rolen had season-ending shoulder surgery &quot;for the removal of scar tissue and a bursectomy and a manipulation of his left (non-throwing) shoulder&quot;.

=== Toronto Blue Jays (2008–2009) ===

On January 12, 2008, the Cardinals reached a preliminary deal to send Rolen to the Toronto Blue Jays for Troy Glaus (which became finalized on January 14).

Rolen suffered a non-displaced fracture of his right middle finger during fielding drills at spring training. His fingernail was also torn off. As a result, Rolen missed the beginning of the regular season, having surgery to insert a screw in his broken finger. Marco Scutaro was the Blue Jays&#x27; third baseman in Rolen&#x27;s place. On April 25, 2008, Rolen was activated from the 15-day disabled list. Two days later, against the Kansas City Royals, he hit his first home run as a Blue Jay.

After coming off another stint in the DL in late August, this time for his shoulder, he modified his batting stance by lowering his shoulders and arms by six inches, enabling him to reestablish his offensive power for the season&#x27;s final month and hitting a couple of home runs at the comfort of less strain on the shoulder, which he had three prior surgeries to correct. He finished the year with a .262 batting average, 11 home runs and 50 RBIs in 115 games.

=== Cincinnati Reds (2009–2012) ===
On July 31, 2009, Rolen was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with cash considerations for Edwin Encarnación, Josh Roenicke and Zach Stewart. During the 2010 season, Rolen regularly started at third base. He hit his 300th career home run on June 28, 2010, off Kyle Kendrick of the Philadelphia Phillies. His performance helped the Reds win the Central Division that year, their first division championship in 15 seasons. Rolen also won his eighth Gold Glove as a member of the Reds, the third team with which he received the award.

A middle-of-the-order hitter throughout his career, Rolen finished with a career .281 batting average, a .364 on-base percentage and a .490 slugging percentage. He had 2,077 hits, 316 home runs, and 1,287 RBIs, while scoring 1,211 runs. He finished with a career Wins Above Replacement (WAR) of 70.1, which ranks 10th all-time among third basemen.

On July 15, 2011, he became the fourth third baseman ever to have 2,000 hits, 500 doubles, 300 home runs and 1,200 RBIs, along with Mike Schmidt, George Brett, and Chipper Jones. Rolen ended his career with the 2012 National League Division Series, where a groundball error in Game 3 scored the go-ahead run for the San Francisco Giants when the Reds were one win away from the NLCS. With the potential in the ninth inning to tie or win in Game 5 by being at the plate with two runners on in a 6–4 game, Rolen struck out to clinch the series for the Giants.

Rolen did not attend 2013 spring training, but also did not announce his retirement.

==Charity work==
In 1999, Rolen created The Enis Furley Foundation (named after one of Rolen&#x27;s dogs), wanting to help children and their families who struggle with illness, hardship, or other special needs. The scope of the foundation was intentionally left broad to give the flexibility to respond to a wide range of personal circumstances. Externally, the Enis Furley Foundation is active in community outreach programs, &quot;Hot Corner Kids,&quot; and the construction of outdoor retreats, such as &quot;Camp Emma Lou&quot; (named after another one of Rolen&#x27;s dogs). Rolen&#x27;s goals for his charity efforts are simple: &quot;To have fun, have a blast. Let&#x27;s play.&quot;

Rolen gave Indiana University a &quot;major gift&quot; to the Indiana University baseball program and its facility, Bart Kaufman Field. Rolen made the contribution in honor of his parents, Ed and Linda Rolen, who are longtime educators and IU fans.

==Awards and honors==
*1993 Selected to the Indiana Basketball All Star Team
*1993 Mr. Baseball (Indiana)

*National League Silver Slugger (2002)

Rolen was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America in 2023, his sixth year of eligibility. Notably, he had received only 10.2% of the vote in his first appearance on the ballot in 2018, the lowest ever for a candidate eventually voted in by the BBWAA. He was formally inducted on July 23.

==Personal life==
Rolen is married and is a father of two children. When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, Rolen celebrated the announcement with his parents, wife, and children. In 2018, when he first appeared on the Hall of Fame ballot, Rolen&#x27;s son predicted that his father would someday be inducted.

On July 18, 2018, Rolen was hired as the Director of Player Development for Indiana University baseball.

<text>Ocean&#x27;s Twelve is a 2004 American heist comedy film directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by George Nolfi. The second installment in the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s&quot; film trilogy franchise and the sequel to &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (2001), the film features an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Andy García, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Julia Roberts, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Vincent Cassel, Eddie Jemison, Carl Reiner, and Elliott Gould.

&quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on December 10, 2004, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $362.9 million worldwide, becoming the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2004. It was followed by &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; (2007), with Soderbergh and most of the cast again returning.

== Plot ==
Terry Benedict locates all eleven members of Danny Ocean&#x27;s crew, demanding they return the $160 million they stole from his casinos plus $38 million in interest. He gives them a two-week deadline to return it or he will either get them all arrested or killed.

Short by half the amount, the group schemes to stage a heist in Amsterdam to avoid problems with U.S. authorities. Saul decides not to participate since he is too old for another grand heist. They are tipped off by an informant named Matsui about the location of the first stock certificate ever issued. After a complex series of schemes, they find the document has already been stolen by master thief the &quot;Night Fox&quot;.

Europol detective Isabel Lahiri is called in to investigate the theft and realizes that she gave Rusty the idea of how to solve a complication of the heist with a description of a similar burglary during their earlier relationship. Surprising the group at their accommodation, she warns them they cannot beat the Night Fox or his mentor, the mysterious master thief &quot;LeMarc&quot;, both of whom excel in the &quot;long con&quot;, and steals Rusty&#x27;s phone. She has been hunting both for years.

Danny and his crew discover that the Night Fox is François Toulour, a wealthy French baron and gentleman thief with a villa on Lake Como. Danny goes to the villa and steals Toulour&#x27;s paintings. Confronting Toulour, Ocean learns that Toulour exposed their identities to Benedict (breaking the code of silence among thieves) and hired Matsui to inform the crew about the stock certificate so as to meet with Danny. Toulour is outraged when LeMarc suggested Danny may be a better thief than him, so he challenges him to steal the Imperial Coronation Fabergé egg. If Danny and his crew win, he will pay off their debt to Benedict.

The crew begin to plan an elaborate heist to swap the egg for a holographic recreation, but Toulour gives the camera recordings from his villa to Lahiri, who deduces that they want to steal the egg through an intercepted phone call to Rusty. She then captures most of the crew except Linus, Basher, Turk, and Saul.

Linus comes up with a second plan involving Danny&#x27;s wife, Tess, posing as a pregnant Julia Roberts in order to get close to the egg and swap it. They are foiled by Lahiri and a coincidentally present Bruce Willis, and the rest of the group members are captured. Lahiri is told that they are to be extradited to the U.S., while Linus is chosen first to be interrogated by the FBI agent assigned to collect them. The agent is actually Linus&#x27;s mother, who organizes the release of the whole gang. She points out to Lahiri that she will face consequences for forging a signature on a Europol form to obtain the necessary arrest warrants for Ocean&#x27;s gang.

Sometime later, Danny and Tess return to Toulour&#x27;s villa, where Toulour expresses glee at their failure. He explains that he stole the egg at night using his agility and dancing skills to evade the museum&#x27;s heavy security. Toulour&#x27;s celebration is short-lived when Danny reveals that his group stole the real egg while it was in transit to the museum, and Toulour realizes they were tipped off by LeMarc.

A flashback reveals that Danny and Rusty had met LeMarc earlier when he revealed his confidence trick intended to humiliate Toulour and, at the same time, restore to himself the Fabergé egg that he had stolen years ago but returned following his wife&#x27;s wishes. Toulour is forced to admit that Danny won the bet and gives him the money for the debt to Benedict.

As the crew pay back Benedict and promise not to perform any more heists in his casinos, Toulour is seen in the background spying on them. Rusty takes Lahiri to a safe house that he claims has been lent to him by LeMarc. There, she is reunited with her father, who is revealed to be the man she has been pursuing for years: LeMarc.

==Cast==
===The Twelve===
===Others===
==Production==
The script was reworked when Julia Roberts learned she was pregnant with twins.

The film was shot in 2004 in Atlantic City, New Jersey; in St. Petersburg, Florida; and in Las Vegas at the Bellagio Hotel. Filming also took place in Chicago, Amsterdam, Paris, Monte Carlo, Lake Como (at Villa Erba in Cernobbio), Rome, and Castellammare del Golfo in Sicily. The production spent three weeks in the Netherlands; scenes were filmed in the KattenKabinet, the Hotel Pulitzer, the Haarlem railway station, and The Hague City Hall. In Paris, scenes were shot at the Sorbonne, the Australian Embassy, and the Gare du Nord. Afterwards, filming moved to Italy. The Monte Carlo Casino and the Villa Erba (on Lake Como) also served as filming locations.

== Reception ==
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, and an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;While some have found the latest star-studded heist flick to be a fun, glossy star vehicle, others declare it&#x27;s lazy, self-satisfied and illogical.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The film was criticized for its slow start, its complex plot and a final twist that negated much of the preceding action. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Stephen Hunter said that &quot;it all ends on one of those infuriatingly sloppy notes where, having dramatized narrative events WXYZ for us, which we have taken on good faith, it suddenly and arbitrarily delivers narrative events STUV, which completely invalidate events WXYZ.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; said that &quot;while it looks like the cast is having a blast and a half, the studied hipness can get so pleased with itself it borders on the smug.&quot; Claudia Puig with &quot;USA Today&quot; remarked, &quot;At the rate things are going, all of Hollywood will put in about a day&#x27;s work on &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Seventeen&quot;.&quot; &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; was rated by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as one of &quot;The 25 Worst Sequels Ever Made&quot;.

In a positive review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and applauded its cleverness: &quot;The movie takes inventory of its characters with the same droll wit it does everything else ... The movie is all about behavior, dialogue, star power and wiseass in-jokes. I really sort of liked it.&quot; Steven Soderbergh has stated that it is his favorite of the then-three &quot;Ocean&#x27;s&quot; films.

== Soundtrack ==
The original soundtrack to &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; was released by Warner Bros. Records on December 7, 2004. David Holmes returned to compose the music for the film and won a BMI award.

Holmes&#x27; songs &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;I Love Art...Really!&quot; were released as singles and do not appear on the commercial soundtrack LP. &quot;The Real Story&quot; is different in the film, which uses &quot;Rito a Los Angeles&quot; by Peppino de Luca, featuring part of the main riff of &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;. The album also lacks &quot;Thé à la Menthe&quot; performed by La Caution, used during the Night Fox &quot;laser-dance&quot; sequence, &quot;Margaret&quot; by Giuseppe De Luca, which plays as the group are escorted from the police station, and &quot;El Capitalismo Foraneo&quot; by Gotan Project, which plays as Lahiri cracks Matsui.

&quot;Ascension to Virginity&quot; was taken from the soundtrack of the 1968 movie &quot;Candy&quot;, where it likewise appeared in the epilogue.

<text>WBAI (99.5 FM) is a non-commercial, listener-supported radio station licensed to New York, New York. Its programming is a mixture of political news, talk and opinion from a left-leaning, liberal or progressive viewpoint, and eclectic music. The station is owned by the Pacifica Foundation with studios located in Brooklyn and transmitter located at 4 Times Square.

==History==
===Origins===
The station began as WABF, which first went on the air in 1941 as W75NY, of Metropolitan Television, Inc. (W75NY indicating an eastern station at 47.5 MHz in New York), and moved to the 99.5 frequency in 1947. In 1955, after two years off the air, it was reborn as WBAI (after then-owners Broadcast Associates, Inc.).

===1960s===
WBAI was purchased by philanthropist Louis Schweitzer, who donated it to the Pacifica Foundation in 1960. The station, which had been a commercial enterprise, became non-commercial and listener-supported under Pacifica ownership.

The history of WBAI during this period is iconoclastic and contentious. Referred to in a &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; piece as &quot;an anarchist&#x27;s circus,&quot; one station manager was jailed in protest. The staff, in protest at sweeping proposed changes of another station manager, seized the studio facilities, then located in a deconsecrated church, as well as the transmitter, located at the Empire State Building. During the 1960s, the station hosted numerous anti-establishment causes, including anti-Vietnam war activists, feminists (and live coverage of purported bra-burning demonstrations), kids lib, early Firesign Theater comedy, and complete-album music overnight. It refused to stop playing Janis Ian&#x27;s song about interracial relationships &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot;. Extensive daily coverage of the Vietnam war included the ongoing body count and innumerable anti-war protests.

WBAI played a major role in the evolution and development of the counterculture of the 1960s and early 1970s. Arlo Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; was first broadcast on &quot;Radio Unnameable&quot;, Bob Fass&#x27; freeform radio program on WBAI, a program which itself in many ways created, explored, and defined the possibilities of the form. The station covered the 1968 seizure of the Columbia University campus live and uninterrupted. With its signal reaching nearly 70 miles beyond New York City, its reach and influence, both direct and indirect, were significant. Among the station&#x27;s weekly commentators in the 1960s were author Ayn Rand, British politician/playwright Sir Stephen King-Hall, and author Dennis Wholey. The 1964 Political conventions were &quot;covered&quot; satirically on WBAI by Severn Darden, Elaine May, Burns and Schreiber, David Amram, Julie Harris, Taylor Mead, and members of &quot;The Second City&quot; improvisational group. The station, under Music Directors John Corigliano, Ann McMillan and, later Eric Salzman, aired an annual 23-hour nonstop presentation of Richard Wagner&#x27;s Ring Cycle, as recorded at the Bayreuth Festival the year before, and produced live studio performances of emerging artists in its studios. Interviews with prominent figures in literature and the arts, as well as original dramatic productions and radio adaptations were also regular program offerings.

===1970s===
In 1970, Kathy Dobkin, Milton Hoffman, and Francie Camper produced an unprecedented, critically acclaimed 4 day round-the-clock reading of Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War And Peace&quot;. The epic novel was read cover to cover by more than 200 people—including a large number of international celebrities from various fields. &quot;Newsweek&quot; called this broadcast &quot;one of the more mind-blowing &#x27;firsts&#x27; in the history of the media&quot;. The complete reading (over 200 audio tapes) was the first Pacifica program to be selected for inclusion in the permanent collection of the Museum of Broadcasting in NYC.

In 1973, the station broadcast comedian George Carlin&#x27;s iconic &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&quot; monologue uncensored. WBAI&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Seven Words&quot; became a landmark moment in the history of free speech. In a 1978 milestone in the station&#x27;s contentious and unruly history, WBAI lost a 5-to-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision (&quot;FCC v. Pacifica Foundation&quot;) that to this day has defined the power of the government over broadcast material it calls indecent. Mickey Waldman and Joe Cuomo covered much of the legal proceedings during this time.

In 1974, WBAI program director Marnie Mueller asked Charles Ruas to become director of arts programming. Thus the station, already at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement, the counterculture and anti-war protest, under Ruas also became a platform for New York&#x27;s avant-garde in theater, music, performance, art, and poetry. When the downtown avant-garde operas &quot;A Letter for Queen Victoria&quot; and &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; by Philip Glass and Robert Wilson opened at the Metropolitan Opera, the station was right there to tape excerpts in rehearsals for broadcast.

Ruas initiated The Reading Experiment, a year-long series on Marguerite Young&#x27;s epic novel &quot;Miss MacIntosh, My Darling&quot;. These readings were transformed into performances by Rob Wynne, who scored them with a complex collage of sound effects, music, and opera. The participants included Anaïs Nin, Marian Seldes, Alice Playten, H.M. Koutoukas, Leo Lerman, Michael Wager, Novella Nelson, Osceola Macarthy Adams, Owen Dodson, Wyatt Emory Cooper, Michael Higgins, Anne Fremantle, Peggy Cass, Ruth Ford, Earle Hyman and Daisy Aldan.

When William Burroughs returned to the United States from Tangier, Ruas invited him to present a retrospective of all his works. The series consisted of four programs, beginning with &quot;Junkie&quot; and followed by &quot;The Yage Letters&quot;, read by Burroughs and Allen Ginsburg, &quot;The Last Words of Dutch Schultz&quot;, and, finally, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. Bill Kortum oversaw this series as well as retrospectives of the works of Jerzy Kosinski and Donald Barthelme, co-produced with Judith Sherman, the station&#x27;s music director.

A semester of Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poetry seminar held at the Naropa Institute in Colorado was presented by Ruas, and for many years the station covered the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve celebratory poetry marathon at St. Mark&#x27;s Church. The day the Vietnam War ended, poet Muriel Rukeyser came to the station to read her poem on peace.

Ruas inaugurated the Audio Experimental Theater, a series presenting the works of avant-garde artists: Meredith Monk, Yvonne Rainer, Ed Bowes, Ed Friedman, Michael Newman with Joan Schwartz and Benjamin Folkman, Vito Acconci, Charles Ludlum, Jacques Levy, Willoughby Sharp, John Cage, Robert Wilson, Philip Glass, Richard Foreman, and Joan Jonas.

In drama, the station defended Tennessee Williams against his critics during the last years of his life by covering his &quot;Memoirs&quot; and broadcasting a production of &quot;Two-Character Play&quot;. Other dramatists whose works were featured included Jean-Claude van Itallie, Richard Scheckner, Andrei Serban, and Elizabeth Swados.

Ruas initiated interview programs featuring nonfiction writers discussing their fields of expertise—Buckminster Fuller, Thor Heyerdahl, Ed Sanders, Jonathan Kozol and Nigel Nicholson.

Each of the arts had weekly coverage. Courtney Callender&#x27;s &quot;Getting Around&quot; covered the cultural scene. Moira Hodgson was the dance critic. The visual arts critics were John Perreault, Cindy Nemser, Liza Baer, Joe Giordano, Judith Vivell, Kenneth Koch, and Les Levine.

Ruas invited poet Susan Howe and CCNY Literature professor Paul Oppenheimer to produce a weekly poetry program. Howe produced a weekly poetry program presenting the works of John Ashbery, W.S. Merwin, Maureen Owen, Charles Reznikoff, Rebecca Wright, Ron Padgett, Carter Ratcliff, John Hollander, Anne Waldman, Helen Adam, Audre Lorde, Michael Brownstein, Mary Ferrari, and Muriel Rukeyser. She also produced specials featuring William Carlos Williams, V. R. Lang, Jack Spicer, Louise Bogan, Paul Metcalf, Jonathan Williams, Harry Mathews, and James Laughlin.

On alternate weeks, Oppenheimer presented the works of Barbara Holland, Ivan Arguelles, Ann Darr, Richard Howard, Karen Swenson, James Emanuel, Siv Cedering Fox, Nelson Canton, Victoria Sullivan, Samuel Menashe, Carol Hebald, Paul Zweig, Gregor Roy and Mary Jane Menuez. He also produced specials on the aesthetics of 20th century poets and the history of the sonnet with contemporary American examples.

From 1976 to 1979, poet John Giorno hosted &quot;The Poetry Experiment&quot; and presented, with Charles Ruas, his eight-part series &quot;Dial-A-Poem Poets&quot;.

When Ira Weitzman became Director of the Saturday night Free Music Store program, he was as interested in performance as dedicated to music. He oversaw Meredith Monk&#x27;s performance of &quot;Quarry&quot;, as well as producing Broadway actress Marian Seldes in &quot;Portrait of an Unknown Lady: Eleanor Wylie&quot;. He produced &quot;Performing Poets in Support of WBAI&quot; with the country&#x27;s most notable poets. His best known production was an evening with the performing poets Ed Friedman, Helen Adam and Patti Smith, who performed her first concert.

During those years, WBAI became a cultural force as these programs were disseminated nationally through the Pacifica Network.

In 1977, there was a major internal crisis at WBAI which resulted in the loss of the physical space of the station. WBAI was located in a former church on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. For many years, WBAI had believed it was exempt from New York City real estate taxes as an &quot;educational&quot; institution, but in March 1977 the City Tax Commission denied that status and WBAI eventually sold the church (which it owned) to pay the back taxes. WBAI signed a new lease for the 19th floor (the former Caedmon Records office/studio) plus one office on another floor of an office building at 505 8th Avenue on the West Side of Manhattan.

===Turmoil and change===
After the events in 1977, the station began a shift to a more profound international direction. In 1980, Caribbean immigrant and Marxist activist Samori Marksman was hired as WBAI Program Director and with his ascension, there was more of a focus on international issues and the promotion of people of color to the WBAI staff which caused grumbling among long time white and Jewish progressives who felt they were being pushed out of the station. In 1983, Marksman abruptly left for the Caribbean island of Grenada to participate in a new government – a government that was thwarted by the US invasion of Grenada in October 1983.

In 1986, gay activist John Scagliotti became program director. He initiated many program changes; still more long-time programmers left the station. Scagliotti tried to professionalize the programming and smooth out the rougher edges of existing shows. During his tenure, several producers received accolades for their efforts, including Robert Knight, who won a Polk Award for his show &quot;Contragate&quot;, and future program director and Station Manager Valerie Van Isler, who won awards for her role in the film, &quot;The Panama Deception&quot;. Also, award-winning producer and host Amy Goodman began her career under Scagliotti. Samori Marksman returned to WBAI in the early 90s and in 1994, and was hired again as WBAI&#x27;s Program Director. During his five-year tenure, WBAI achieved significant progress in listenership and fundraising. Marksman founded &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; in 1996, the award-winning program now helmed by Amy Goodman. Marksman was deeply-connected to the Caribbean and African diaspora. His own program, &quot;Behind The News&quot;, focused on international and national issues from a black nationalist and Marxist perspective. Marksman was profoundly loved by a broad cross section of the WBAI audience and staff. His shocking and sudden death from a massive heart attack on March 23, 1999, was a wound to the station that lasted for years. Over 3,000 people attended his funeral at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan.

Shortly before the death of Samori Marksman and following years of complaints about the outdated and filthy studios at 505 Eighth Avenue in New York, WBAI moved to new studios at 120 Wall Street in the Financial District in Manhattan in June 1998. After the death of Marksman, there was profound uncertainty and an explosion of pent-up feelings and resentments that was suppressed by Marksman and Mario Murillo, the Public Affairs director. Utrice Leid, a popular Caribbean radio host and producer had expected to succeed Marksman but was denied the post by then-general manager Valerie Van Isler. This led to an intense battle between various factions inside and outside the station and with The Pacifica Foundation, the non-profit parent company of WBAI. The culmination of this conflict was the &quot;Christmas Coup&quot; in December 2000 when a faction, led by Leid, padlocked the station and took control of the airwaves, starting an on-air and off-air war that lasted for several years. Some senior WBAI staffers, including general manager Van Isler, were fired immediately. Van Isler, in particular, was blamed for the early death of Marksman. In 1994, Van Isler initially refused to hire Marksman, claiming Marksman had a mediocre credit report, then, later in his tenure, refused to give him a salary increase. The autocratic and unpopular Van Isler also vigorously fought former staffers from obtaining unemployment benefits, including Bill Wells, the former WBAI Chief Engineer, who had a disability.

In late 2012, WBAI suffered extensive damage to its offices following the events of Hurricane Sandy. The Manhattan offices saw flooding reach the second floor, trapping seven staffers inside, and the telephone systems being disabled. The devastation by Sandy occurred in the midst of fundraising efforts, which ultimately prevented WBAI from acquiring the necessary funds to remain operational. As a result of funding and operational difficulties, WBAI announced in 2013 it would be moving out of those studios to temporary studios of WHCR-FM located in Harlem, a station operated by City College of New York (CUNY).

Lynne Rosen and John Littig, co-hosts of the monthly show &quot;The Pursuit of Happiness&quot;, were found dead on June 3, 2013, after committing suicide in their Park Slope home.

In June 2013, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting suspended payments to WBAI, citing accounting irregularities and a failure by the station to meet its financial obligations. Layoff notices effective July 15 were subsequently issued to the station&#x27;s staff and management.

On August 9, 2013, Pacifica management announced that due to financial problems, WBAI was laying off about two-thirds of its staff, effective August 12, 2013. The entire news department was laid off. Summer Reese, the interim executive director of the Pacifica Foundation, which owns WBAI, said that after talks with SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents broadcasting talent, &quot;we will be laying off virtually everyone whose voice you recognize on the air,&quot; effective Monday. She corrected that and announced the final number was 19 out of the station&#x27;s 29 employees, about 66%. Andrew Phillips, the former general manager of another of Pacifica&#x27;s five stations, KPFA in Berkeley, California, was appointed WBAI&#x27;s interim program director. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the station owed $2 million in broadcast fees to &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; alone, while cash on hand was just $23,000.

In March 2014, there were assorted rumors that the station would be sold or leased or moved, in whole or in part (including their equipment and antenna at the Empire State Building), after contentions and firings both at WBAI and at Pacifica headquarters.

On December 17, 2014, the California State Attorney General opened a full and formal investigation into the Pacifica Radio Foundation, owner of WBAI, with respect to its alleged irregularities as to its finances, violations of California law with respect to nonprofit organizations, and violations of its own bylaws. In 2015, WBAI moved to new studios and offices at 388 Atlantic Avenue in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn.

On October 4, 2017, the court rejected WBAI&#x27;s pleadings as ill-founded and granted the Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT) a summary judgment, in the amount of $1.8m plus attorney&#x27;s fees, for the monies due through the initial filing date of late 2016. ESRT was awarded with an additional $600k for the lease through the date of the court&#x27;s ruling, with obligations of approximately $50k+ per month through lease expiration in 2020 also remaining in place. A further settlement was announced on April 6, 2018, releasing WBAI from the court judgment and its obligation to continuing leasing the Empire State tower into 2020. They began broadcasting from 4 Times Square on May 31, 2018. A bailout loan from listeners of sister station KPFK eventually covered the remaining fees on the lease.

On Monday, October 7, 2019, the Pacifica Foundation announced they were shutting down WBAI&#x27;s local operations, leaving only two workers to keep the station&#x27;s signal on the air. WBAI began airing a national network feed known as &quot;Pacifica Across America&quot; - a curated collection of original content produced by Pacifica stations KPFA in Berkeley, California, KPFK in Los Angeles, KPFT in Houston and WPFW in Washington, D.C., among other sources (the post-shutdown WBAI schedule included commercial progressive talker Thom Hartmann and Native American free-form series &quot;Undercurrents&quot;, which is mostly syndicated to public radio). John Vernile, interim executive director of the Pacifica Foundation, said the station&#x27;s fund raising and audience had declined in recent years, to the point where the rest of the Pacifica network was subsidizing WBAI&#x27;s operations on top of servicing its unsustainable debt load.

Within hours of the shutdown, WBAI&#x27;s staffers filed a lawsuit in New York state court challenging the shutdown as illegal. A temporary injunction was granted the afternoon of October 8, 2019 ordering WBAI to resume operations and not dismantle the studio until an October 18 hearing, but by the time the injunction had been issued the studio had already been dismantled, preventing the staff from resuming local operations. An appeals court lifted most of the injunction October 10, only enjoining Pacifica from outright firing WBAI&#x27;s employees. On Tuesday, October 15, 2019, WBAI&#x27;s attorney, Arthur Schwartz, stated that Federal Judge Paul A. Engelmayer reactivated the temporary restraining order (TRO), extending it to close of business on the 17th.

On October 15, District Judge Engelmayer (Southern District of New York) extended the New York State Supreme Court&#x27;s TRO from October 18 through the end of the next hearing, which was scheduled for Monday, October 21. Prior to the hearing, the parties were to submit briefs in support or opposition of the extension of the TRO.

In Manhattan Supreme Court, Judge Melissa Crane ordered Pacifica to return control of the station back to WBAI. She upheld the October 20, 2019, board vote to annul the decision to shutter WBAI. A lawyer for Pacifica, Kara Steger, said that the company planned to appeal the ruling. WBAI resumed local programming on November 7.

In April 2024, WBAI announced it had again fallen into arrears on tower rental and that the owner of 4 Times Square was threatening to remove WBAI &quot;at any time&quot; unless the station paid the $150,000 in debt it owed to the building. WBAI, which stated that such a move would mean &quot;the end of WBAI&quot; (a statement the general manager insisted was &quot;not hyperbole&quot;) immediately launched a pledge drive hoping to raise the funds. Later that month, Pacifica agreed to a consent decree with the FCC over its pledge drive content containing unlawful calls to action, accepting a $25,000 fine and having its license renewal shortened to two years instead of the usual eight; the complaint had been filed by Pacifica Safety Net, a pressure group formed in hopes of rectifying Pacifica&#x27;s overall financial situation, up to and including selling the WBAI license.

<text>Yim Wing-chun () is a Chinese legendary character, often cited in Wing Chun legends as the first master of the martial art bearing her name. Wing-chun, though a person&#x27;s name in Chinese language, translates literally to &quot;spring chant&quot;, or may be substituted with the character for &quot;eternal spring&quot;.

==Background==

Different accounts of Yim&#x27;s legend exist, but the central sequence of events remains largely the same, beginning with the origin of her teacher. During the Qing dynasty, a Shaolin Buddhist nun and abbess, Ng Mui (五枚師太), reportedly fled the destruction of the Shaolin temple at the hands of the government; the temple was believed to be harbouring revolutionaries. According to one legend, after being inspired by witnessing a crane and a snake fighting, Ng Mui incorporated their movements into her style of Chinese kung fu to form a new, yet-unnamed martial art system.

Ng Mui later took on a disciple, Yim Wing-chun, and passed the art on to her. Yim Wing-chun was well known for her beauty and sold tofu for a living. A local bully tried to force her to marry him, but she used the art to defeat him. Some accounts claim that Ng Mui taught Yim the art specifically for the purpose of defending herself against the man&#x27;s unwanted advances.

Yim later married Leung Bok-chau, a salt merchant, who named the art &quot;Wing Chun Kuen&quot; (Wing Chun Fist) after her. James Yimm Lee (1972) attributes significant development of the art to Yim Wing-chun, crediting her with the invention of the &quot;Chi Sao&quot; (sticking hands) exercise. From there, the art passed through several men&#x27;s hands before coming to Ip Man.

== Lineage ==
==In popular culture==
&quot;Stranger from Shaolin&quot; (1977) uses the character of Yim Wing-chun in an action film genre starring Cecilia Wong Hang-Sau.

The movie &quot;Wing Chun&quot; (1994) loosely portrays Yim Wing-chun&#x27;s life within the action film genre, with Michelle Yeoh portraying the central character and Donnie Yen (now famous as Ip Man in four films) playing Leung Pok-to, Yim Wing-chun&#x27;s childhood friend and fiancé.

Erica Choi portrays Yim Wing-chun in the 1994 Hong Kong martial arts television series &quot;The Kung Fu Master&quot;.

In the 2010 film &quot;Kung Fu Wing Chun&quot;, Yim Wing-chun was portrayed by Bai Jing and Leung Bok-chau was portrayed by Yu Shaoqun.

Meng and Rudnicki (2006) have written a critical analysis of the legend surrounding Yim Wing-chun.

<text>Some Devil is the only solo studio album by musician Dave Matthews. It was released on September 23, 2003 on RCA Records. It has been certified platinum by the RIAA, signifying over a million copies sold. The album features several guest musicians, including long-time Dave Matthews Band collaborator guitarist Tim Reynolds and Phish frontman and guitarist Trey Anastasio. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Gravedigger&quot;, won a Grammy Award in 2004. &quot;Some Devil&quot; was recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle, Washington, and produced by Stephen Harris, who had previously worked with the Dave Matthews Band on their 2002 album &quot;Busted Stuff&quot;.

Of the album, Matthews said: &quot;I hadn&#x27;t really been thinking about doing a solo album until I had a handful of songs that didn&#x27;t really fit with the band, so I started with those and it just grew into a full record,&quot; Matthews said. &quot;I kind of thought it&#x27;d be fun to put it out.&quot;

Many fans, while at first skeptical of Matthews&#x27; desire to release a solo album, quickly praised his efforts. The album is noted for its moodier tone and the fresh direction shown in Matthews&#x27; songwriting.

Since 2003, Matthews has performed &quot;Some Devil&quot; material in concert with a group coined Dave Matthews &amp; Friends, which consisted mainly of musicians that appear on the album. He has also played album material solo and with long-time acoustic duo partner Tim Reynolds. During the 2008 summer tour, Dave Matthews Band played &quot;Gravedigger&quot; and &quot;So Damn Lucky&quot; regularly, with &quot;Stay or Leave&quot; following suit during the 2009 summer tour.

<doc id="1046501" wikidata="Q1203742" url="?curid=1046501" title="As Tears Go By (film)">
<text>As Tears Go By is a 1988 Hong Kong action crime drama film starring Andy Lau, Maggie Cheung and Jacky Cheung. The film was the directorial debut of Wong Kar-wai, and was inspired by Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Mean Streets&quot;. The central plot revolves around a small-time triad member trying to keep his friend out of trouble. The film was screened at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, during International Critics&#x27; Week.

==Plot==
Wah is a mob enforcer who primarily deals with debt collection. His subordinate, Fly, is less successful and not as well respected as Wah. Fly frequently causes trouble and borrows money he can&#x27;t pay back. Out of the blue, Wah receives a call from his aunt, informing him that his younger cousin Ngor, whom he has never met, will be coming to stay with him in Hong Kong for the next few days. Ngor, who works at her family&#x27;s restaurant on Lantau Island, must come to Hong Kong for a medical procedure.

Soon after Ngor arrives at his apartment, Wah has to leave to help Fly collect a debt. After the job, Wah goes to see his girlfriend, Mabel, who dumps him. Because he had been so distant and unresponsive, she had aborted his baby. Wah had not even been aware she was pregnant in the first place and reacts badly. Wah stumbles home angry and drunk, but when Ngor tries to console him later that night, he becomes very aggressive and threatens to throw her out. The next morning, Wah apologizes to Ngor and offers to take her out to a movie to make up for his behavior.

In order to make money to pay off a loan to a fellow gang member, Tony, Fly makes an unreasonably high bet in a game of snooker. When he realizes there is no chance he can win or pay his debt, he makes a run for it with his friend Site. After being chased through the streets, Fly and Site are caught and severely beaten by members of Tony&#x27;s gang. As Wah and Ngor are about to leave the apartment, Fly arrives, bruised and bloody and carrying an unconscious Site. Wah and Ngor treat their wounds, and Ngor starts to question Wah&#x27;s line of work. The next day, she returns to Lantau, leaving Wah a note asking him to come to visit her sometime.

Wah meets with Tony to settle Fly&#x27;s debt. Tony says to Wah that if Fly wasn&#x27;t his friend he would already be dead. Unable to pay the interest on the debt, Wah steals the money from the owner of the establishment Tony was hired to protect. Insulted by Wah&#x27;s behavior, Tony takes his grievance to Uncle Kwan, the mob boss, who forces Tony and Wah to accept a monthly payment compromise. Afterward, Kwan tells Wah to get Fly under control before he gets himself killed. Accepting that Fly is not cut out for mob work, Wah gets him a legitimate job selling fishballs from a food cart.

After accidentally meeting Mabel and finding out she is now married, Wah decides to visit Ngor. Arriving at her family&#x27;s restaurant in Lantau, he learns that she is in Kowloon for the day and will return that evening. Wah meets Ngor at the ferry terminal and learns that she has begun seeing her doctor for treatment. Over the next couple of days, Wah helps out at the restaurant and his relationship with Ngor evolves. Meanwhile, Tony visits Fly to insult him and his new job. Fly wrecks Tony&#x27;s car in retaliation, but Tony&#x27;s gang promptly catches him and beats him near to death. Wah has to cut his visit with Ngor short, after receiving a call from Tony demanding money in exchange for Fly&#x27;s life.

Arriving at Tony&#x27;s place, Wah surprises Tony by threatening him. Tony gives in to Wah&#x27;s demands and lets Fly go. Wah urges Fly to return to his family in the countryside, which Fly refuses to do. Leaving the bar, they are attacked by Tony and his gang and severely beaten. Fly leaves Wah, telling Wah to forget him because he has been a terrible friend. Wah manages to return to Lantau where Ngor and her doctor treat his wounds. He recovers, and the two rekindle their relationship.

Back in Hong Kong, Uncle Kwan gives Tony a job to assassinate an informant. Tony is afraid to do the job since it is essentially a suicide mission. Fly offers to take the job in order to humiliate Tony, whose thugs abandon him in disgust. Hearing Fly has taken this job, Wah returns to confront him, and attempts in vain to persuade Fly not to do it. Wah arrives at the police station just as Fly is about to carry out the assassination. Fly shoots the informant but fails to kill him. Instead, he is shot and killed by the police. Wah grabs Fly&#x27;s gun and kills the informant, finishing the job. As Wah is gunned down, he thinks of his first kiss with Ngor.

<text>Quest University (officially Quest University Canada) was a private, not-for-profit, secular liberal arts and sciences university. The university opened in September 2007 with an inaugural class of 73 and suspended academic operations in April 2023. The university had an enrolment of around 200 students around the time of its closing. The campus was sold to Capilano University for $63.2M who began operating at the campus in Fall 2024. 

Quest&#x27;s curriculum was considered unconventional. It used the block plan, adapted and modified from the block plan at Colorado College. Students needed to complete 32 blocks to graduate. Classes were seminar-style and capped at 20 students. There were five divisions (Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Arts &amp; Humanities, Mathematics, and Social Sciences) instead of traditional departments. In lieu of declaring a major, students wrote a personalized Question. Studies culminate in a major work called a Keystone project. Upon graduation—usually after four years study—students were awarded a degree of Bachelor of Arts and Sciences. 

The campus was located on a hilltop on the edge of Garibaldi Provincial Park. It was approximately from Vancouver and from Whistler, British Columbia. Quest University Canada was fully accredited and approved by the Degree Quality Assessment Board (DQAB) under the British Columbia Ministry of Advanced Education. Quest was also registered as a British Columbia Education Quality Assurance (EQA) approved post-secondary institution.
==History==
Quest University Canada was originally created as the Sea to Sky University in May 2002, when the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia passed the Sea to Sky University Act. One of the purposes cited in the act was to create a university that would &quot;offer a rigorous and well-rounded university education in the arts and sciences with a global focus.&quot; Quest was the brainchild of David Strangway, who, after his retirement as president of the University of British Columbia, wished to create a new kind of university where undergraduates guided their own studies in close cooperation with faculty.

Together with Quest founding directors Blake Bromley and Peter Ufford, Strangway formed the Sea to Sky Foundation and began soliciting contributions and searching for land. The foundation received grants from the J.W. McConnell Foundation, R. Howard Webster Foundation, and the Stewart and Marilyn Blusson Foundation, which allowed it to begin hiring staff and faculty and launch the university&#x27;s operations. Bromley, a lawyer specializing in charitable law, recruited many wealthy clients to donate shares to the foundation, many of which were sold back to donors after a charitable tax receipt had been issued, a move that triggered an investigation from the Canada Revenue Agency. In October 2005, the Sea to Sky University changed its name to Quest University Canada. The school officially opened its doors to students in 2007, becoming the first private, secular university in Canada.

In 2011, Quest graduated its first class. In February 2018 the University cancelled its athletics program, the Quest Kermodes, citing the need to cut costs to reduce its high debt load.

On October 29, 2020, Quest University announced that an agreement had been signed with Primacorp Ventures, an investment company which owns and manages commercial and educational real estate. Under the agreement, Quest would sell their campus lands to Primacorp and then lease them back in order to continue operations.

The university closed at the end of the 2022–2023 academic year, when all academic operations ceased. On August 16, 2023, the government of British Columbia issued a press release announcing that Capilano University had purchased Quest University&#x27;s campus for $63.2M with supplemental funding provided by the government of British Columbia. CapU Squamish began offering courses at the campus in Fall 2024.

=== Board of Governors ===
The board of governors consisted of seven members, headed by Board Chair Arthur Wilms, former president of Westcoast Energy Inc. In 2018, Anna Lippman became the first Quest alumnus elected to the board. Jeff Warren, an arts and humanities professor, was the Vice President, Academic.
==Academics==
Quest&#x27;s curriculum and educational philosophy were different than most universities. Its approach was multidisciplinary and the school did not have traditional departments. It offers one degree for all students, the Bachelor of Arts and Sciences. There were no lecture halls. Every class had a maximum of 20 students. The faculty hold terminal degrees in their field, but were known as Tutors rather than Professors. There is no tenure system at Quest.

Other distinguishing features included the Foundation and Concentration Programs, block plan scheduling, a Question instead of a conventional major, and a final Keystone project.

===Foundation program===
In their first two years of study, students enrolled in 16 Foundation courses. After completing the mandatory Cornerstone and Rhetoric classes, they went on to take 14 courses chosen from five major divisions: Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Arts &amp; Humanities. They needed also fulfil a language requirement.

Toward the end of the Foundation Program, students took a course called Question. Working with an instructor and a faculty mentor, they developed a statement of Question: a proposal for how they would study a topic of particular interest to them. The Question was in lieu of a conventional major, serving as the basis for the remaining two years of study, and inspired the student&#x27;s Keystone project.

===Concentration program===
The remaining two years were known as the Concentration Program. With the help of a faculty advisor, students designed a personalized program, which consists of four principal elements:
# a statement of the Question
# a course plan
# a list of related readings
# a Keystone project

Along with their Concentration (or Focus) Courses, students took between one and four Experiential Learning Blocks, hands-on work that could take place in the private sector, not-for-profit, government or many other settings. Quest stated that the purpose of Experiential Learning was to show students how their interests manifested in the world and helped them gain direct experience. Students also take three or more electives.

===Block plan===
Quest operated on the block plan, where students took one course at a time, meeting every weekday for 3.5 weeks. The academic year was divided into two terms. Fall term usually ran from September to mid-December, and spring term typically ran from January to the end of April. There were four blocks per term, and full-time students took eight blocks per year.

Quest claimed that the block plan allowed scheduling flexibility: students could decide which blocks were spent on courses and which were spent traveling, working, or exploring other pursuits. The school also noted that block scheduling permitted faculty to run &quot;field studies&quot;, off-campus learning experiences that could run for several weeks. Many field studies involved fees, which ranged from nominal to significant. Quest also offered Study Abroad. Students could spend one or two academic terms at a selection of partner universities around the world.

===Keystone===
To graduate, students needed complete a Keystone project, the culmination of their studies. A Keystone could take various forms: a scientific paper, video documentary, art installation, photography exhibit, work of fiction, or research paper. Students presented their Keystones to their peers, faculty and community. A few outstanding Keystones were granted Distinction, and some were chosen as Showcases that the students present to a wide audience in a formal setting. The university provided ample services to prepare students to justify, to Graduate school admissions officers, their Keystone as the equivalent to a major.

===Rankings and reputation===
Quest University Canada had posted at or near the top of Canada&#x27;s foremost poll of student opinion, the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE).

Quest was not included in Macleans University Rankings because its enrolment was below 1000 students, the magazine&#x27;s cut-off. However, Macleans conducted an interview with then-President David Helfand in 2013 and had published several articles about the school over the years. Quest had also been noted in The Globe and Mail&#x27;s University Report.

==Campus==

The campus had been named one of top 10 most beautiful campuses in Canada. It is built on a hilltop in Squamish, BC.

Quest&#x27;s campus included an academic building, a library building, a &quot;RecPlex&quot; which contains a full gymnasium facility, and a services building that included a cafeteria. There were five main student residences, each priced the same as an average Canadian university and with nearly twice the floor space. Only two were by the university students. The others were rented out to a high school which used the campus daily.

==Cost and financial aid==
Because Quest was private, it received no government funding at any level. Its operations were funded by tuition and private donations. According to its website, full-time tuition for Canadian students and permanent residents was C$21,000. For international students, it was $35,000. Room and board could add another $15,000, depending on the student&#x27;s selections.

Eligible students could receive financial aid, including scholarships that range from $2000 to full tuition; bursaries; and a Work-Study program on campus. Quest also offered substantial scholarships through its LEAP program (see below). Quest was an approved post-secondary institution to administer government student loans from all provinces and territories in Canada. Quest was also an approved post-secondary institution to administer certain programs out of the US.

== Leaders in Elite Athletics and Performance program==
Quest&#x27;s Leaders in Elite Athletics &amp; Performance program (LEAP) was structured to accommodate the needs of elite athletes and performers who wish to pursue a postsecondary education. LEAP students were afforded extra flexibility in housing, billing, and course scheduling. They could take more years to graduate and were eligible for LEAP scholarships.

Notable LEAP students and alumni include:
* Jack Burke (professional road cyclist for Team H&amp;R Block)
* Samuel Edney (luger; Olympian) 
* Darren Gardner (snowboarder; Olympian)
* Rosalind Groenwoud (freestyle skier; Olympian, Winter X Games Champion)
* Keltie Hansen (freestyle skier; Olympian)
* Leah Kirchmann (professional road cyclist for Team Sunweb; Olympian)
* Simon Nessman (international model)

== Notable faculty members ==
* Glen Van Brummelen (mathematics scholar; past President of the Canadian Society for History and Philosophy of Mathematics)
* Richard Hoshino (mathematics professor; winner of the 2017 Adrien Pouliot Award for Significant and Sustained Contributions to Mathematics Education in Canada; former coach for Canadians competing in the International Mathematical Olympiad)

<doc id="1046514" wikidata="Q5186823" url="?curid=1046514" title="Criticism of Walmart">
<text>The American multinational retail chain Walmart has received criticism from parties such as labor unions and small town advocates for its policies and business practices. 

Criticisms include charges of racial and gender discrimination, foreign product sourcing, anticompetitive practices, treatment of product suppliers, environmental practices, the use of public subsidies, and its surveillance of its employees. The company has denied any wrongdoing and said that low prices are the result of efficiency.

In 2005, labor unions created new organizations and websites to criticize the company, including Wake Up Walmart (United Food and Commercial Workers) and Walmart Watch (Service Employees International Union). By the end of 2005, Walmart had launched Working Families for Walmart to counter those groups. Efforts to counter criticism include a public relations campaign in this same year, which included several television commercials. The company retained the public relations firm Edelman to interact with the press and respond to negative media reports, and has started working with by sending them news, suggesting topics for postings, and inviting them to visit Walmart&#x27;s corporate headquarters. In November 2005, a documentary film critical of Walmart (&quot;Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price&quot;) was released on DVD.

Critics say that Walmart&#x27;s lower prices draw customers away from smaller Main Street businesses, hurting local small town communities, and that the company hurts the United States economy by relying excessively on Chinese-produced products – Walmart is the largest importer in the United States in many categories, such as electronics and fast-moving consumer goods. The 2006 book &quot;The Walmart Effect&quot; by business journalist Charles Fishman contains much of the criticism, though it also enumerates Walmart&#x27;s positive impacts within society.

== Local communities ==
When Walmart plans a new store location, as often as not the company has to fight its way into town in the municipal equivalent of civil war between pro- and anti-Walmart factions. Opponents cite concerns such as traffic congestion, environmental problems, public safety, absentee landlordism, bad public relations, low wages and benefits, and predatory pricing. Opposition by activists, competitors, local citizens, labor unions, and religious groups may include protest marches, property damage to store buildings, or by creating bomb scares. Some city councils have denied permits to developers planning to include a Walmart in their project. Those who defend Walmart cite consumer choice and overall benefits to the economy, and object to bringing the issue into the political arena.

In 1998, Walmart proposed construction of a store west of the intersection of Charlotte Pike (U.S. Route 70) and Interstate 40 outside Nashville, Tennessee. The building site was home to both Native American burial grounds and a Civil War battlefield. Protests were mounted by Native Americans and Civil War interest groups, but the Walmart store was eventually constructed after moving graves and some modifications of the site so as not to interfere with the battlefield. Civil War relics were discovered at the site. The project developers donated land to permit access to the Civil War historic site. The Native sites were removed and re-buried elsewhere.

A Walmart superstore opened in 2004 in Mexico, from the historic Teotihuacan archaeological site and Pyramid of the Moon. Although the location was supported by Mexico&#x27;s National Anthropology Institute, the United Nations, and the Paris-based International Council on Monuments and Sites, there had been protests organized by local merchants, as well as environmental groups and anti-globalization groups who opposed the construction. Poet Homero Aridjis called the opening as &quot;supremely symbolic&quot; and &quot;like planting the staff of globalization in the heart of ancient Mexico&quot;. Archaeologists oversaw construction and discovered a small clay and stone altar along with some other artifacts where the store&#x27;s parking lot is now located.

In 2005, developers demolished the long-closed Dixmont State Hospital in Kilbuck Township, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, with plans to build a shopping complex anchored by a Walmart. While there were initially no general objections to the Walmart store itself, many residents did not want to see Dixmont demolished, despite the fact that the Dixmont complex, having been abandoned in 1984, was beyond maintainable condition and teenagers were dangerously trespassing onto the property on a regular basis. However, while the land was being excavated (after the hospital complex was torn down) in order to create a plateau for the store to be built upon, a landslide occurred covering Pennsylvania Route 65 and the Fort Wayne Line railroad tracks between PA 65 and the Ohio River. Both routes were shut down for weeks. While Walmart did &quot;stabilize&quot; the landslide, many residents said that Walmart merely stabilized the hillside so that it could continue with work to build the store. Ultimately, in 2007 Walmart decided against developing the site, allowing the land to return to nature, with a Walmart location to be constructed in nearby Economy, Pennsylvania, instead behind the Northern Lights Shopping Center. After some opposition from the local Giant Eagle location at the plaza, the Walmart location opened in 2014.

In the 2010s, a proposal to build the Midtown Walmart supercenter in Midtown Miami was met with litigation and opposition from local businesses, delaying construction of the project. A Florida Third District Court of Appeal panel of judges denied the opposition&#x27;s challenge of the city&#x27;s approvals and Walmart broke ground on the development in January 2016.

In 2014, researchers at the University of South Carolina and Sam Houston State University published a study on whether Walmart affected local crime rates. In the 1990s, crime rates were in fact decreasing throughout most of the United States. The study found that this decrease was &quot;nowhere near&quot; as impressive in most communities that had a Walmart store, as if the presence of the large retailer was somehow stunting the decrease. The authors acknowledged the cause-and-effect arrow may go in the opposite direction. For example, one co-author stated, &quot;Counties with more social capital – citizens able and willing to speak up about the best interests of the community – tend to have lower crime rates. Counties with more crime may have less social capital and, therefore, less ability to prevent Wal-Mart from building.&quot;

== Allegations of predatory pricing and supplier issues ==
Walmart has been accused of selling merchandise at such low costs that competitors have tried to sue for predatory pricing (intentionally selling a product at low cost in order to drive competitors out of the market). In 1995, in the case of &quot;Walmart Stores, Inc. v. American Drugs, Inc.&quot;, pharmacy retailer American Drugs accused Walmart of selling items at too low a cost for the purpose of injuring competitors and destroying competition. The Supreme Court of Arkansas ruled in favor of Walmart saying that its pricing, including the use of loss leaders, was not predatory pricing. In 2000, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection accused Walmart of selling butter, milk, laundry detergent, and other staple goods at low cost, with the intention of forcing competitors out of business and gaining a monopoly in local markets. The case was settled out of court. Crest Foods filed a similar lawsuit in Oklahoma, accusing Walmart of predatory pricing on several of its products, in an effort to drive Crest Foods&#x27;s own company-owned store in Edmond, Oklahoma, out of business.

In 2003, Mexico&#x27;s antitrust agency, the Federal Competition Commission, investigated Walmart for &quot;monopolistic practices&quot; prompted by charges that the retailer pressured suppliers to sell goods below cost or at prices significantly less than those available to other stores. Mexican authorities found no wrongdoing on the part of Walmart. However, in 2003, Germany&#x27;s High Court ruled that Walmart&#x27;s low cost pricing strategy &quot;undermined competition&quot; and ordered Walmart and two other supermarkets to raise their prices. Walmart won appeal of the ruling, then the German Supreme Court overturned the appeal. Walmart has since sold its stores in Germany.

Walmart has been accused of using monopoly power to force its suppliers into self-defeating practices. In 2006, Barry C. Lynn, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation (a think tank), said that Walmart&#x27;s constant demand for lower prices caused Kraft Foods to &quot;shut down thirty-nine plants, to let go [of] 13,500 workers, and to eliminate a quarter of its products.&quot; Kraft was unable to compete with other suppliers and said the cost of production had gone up due to higher energy and raw material costs. Lynn said that in a free market, Kraft could have passed those costs on to its distributors and ultimately consumers. As another example in 2006, most Walmart store pharmacies filled many generic prescriptions for $4 for a month&#x27;s supply. However, in California and ten other states, complaints from other pharmacies resulted in Walmart being required to charge at least $9 for a month&#x27;s supply of certain drugs.

In May 2010, Walmart&#x27;s United States stores pulled the Chinese-made Miley Cyrus line of necklaces and bracelets after an Associated Press release that the jewelry contained harmful amounts of the toxic metal cadmium. Cadmium in jewelry is not known to be dangerous if the items are simply worn, but concerns come when a child bites or sucks on the jewelry, as children are apt to do. Walmart said that while the jewelry is not intended for children, &quot;it is possible that a few younger consumers may seek it out in stores. We are removing all of the jewelry from sale while we investigate its compliance with our children&#x27;s jewelry standard&quot;, Walmart said.

== Labor relations ==

With over 2.2 million employees worldwide, Walmart has faced a torrent of lawsuits and issues with regards to its workforce. These issues involve low wages, poor working conditions, inadequate health care, as well as issues involving the company&#x27;s strong anti-union policies. In November 2013, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) announced that it had found that in 13U.S. states Walmart had pressured employees not to engage in strikes on Black Friday, and had illegally disciplined workers who had engaged in strikes. Critics point to Walmart&#x27;s high turnover rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce, although other factors may be involved. Approximately 70percent of its employees leave within the first year. Despite this turnover rate, the company is still able to affect unemployment rates. This was found in a study by Oklahoma State University which states, &quot;Walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present, but to have had only a limited impact on relative incomes after the influences of other socio-economic variables were taken into account.&quot;

=== Wages ===
Walmart reports that in 2006 its workers earned an average of $10.11 per hour. Human Rights Watch estimates that this is below the average of $10.24 earned by workers at discount department stores, $10.55 at warehouse clubs and supercenters, and $11.12 at grocery stores. Walmart managers are judged, in part, based on their ability to control payroll costs. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; says this puts extra pressure on higher-paid workers to be more productive. Walmart insists its wages are generally in line with the current local market in retail labor.

Other critics have noted that in 2001, the average wage for a Walmart Sales Clerk was $8.23 per hour, or $13,861 a year, while the federal poverty line for a family of three was $14,630. Walmart founder Sam Walton once said, &quot;I pay low wages. I can take advantage of that. We&#x27;re going to be successful, but the basis is a very low-wage, low-benefit model of employment.&quot;

In August 2006, Walmart announced that it would roll out an average pay increase of 6% for all new hires at 1,200 United States Walmart and Sam&#x27;s Club locations, but at the same time would institute pay caps on veteran workers. While Walmart maintains that the measures are necessary to stay competitive, critics believe that the salary caps are primarily an effort to push higher-paid veteran workers out of the company.

In 2008, Walmart agreed to pay at least $352 million to settle lawsuits claiming that it forced employees to work off the clock. &quot;Several lawyers described it as the largest settlement ever for lawsuits over wage violations.&quot;

Because Walmart employs part-time and relatively low paid workers, some workers may partially qualify for state welfare programs. This has led critics to claim that Walmart increases the burden on taxpayer-funded services. A 2002 survey by the state of Georgia&#x27;s subsidized healthcare system, PeachCare, found that Walmart was the largest private employer of parents of children enrolled in its program; one quarter of the employees of Georgia Walmarts qualified to enroll their children in the federal subsidized healthcare system Medicaid. A 2004 study at the University of California, Berkeley charges that Walmart&#x27;s low wages and benefits are insufficient, and although decreasing the burden on the social safety net to some extent, California taxpayers still pay $86 million a year to Walmart employees.

On September 4, 2008, the Mexican Supreme Court of Justice ruled that Walmart de Mexico, the Mexican subsidiary of Walmart, must cease paying its employees in part with vouchers redeemable only at Walmart stores.

In July 2016, some workers in China went on unofficial strike at Walmart stores in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and Harbin, Heilongjiang Province against the company&#x27;s new working-hours scheduling system. The striking workers protested the system, which allowed managers to schedule an unlimited number of hours per day totalling up to 174 hours per month without overtime pay. According to Walmart, workers could either opt into the new schedule or keep their original shifts, but pointed out that the new scheduling, which Walmart claim most workers they had contacted supported, allowed employees to work more shifts if they choose. Chinese Walmart staff accused the country&#x27;s only officially recognised union, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), as being apathetic to their cause and unreceptive to workers&#x27; opinions. The ACFTU had previously signed an agreement with the company in 2006 that allowed Walmart to set up management-controlled unions instead. The union asked for the workers to return to their jobs. Reuters reported that by July 8, 2016, the striking workers returned to work when management agreed to consider their protests. Later it was reported that OUR Walmart provided strategic advice to the Walmart Chinese Workers Association (WCWA) prior to the strikes in China.

In January 2018, Walmart announced the increase of the minimum wage for its U.S. employees to $11 per hour.

=== Working conditions ===
Walmart has faced accusations involving poor working conditions for its employees. For example, a 2005 class action lawsuit in Missouri asserted approximately 160,000 to 200,000 people who were forced to work off-the-clock, were denied overtime pay, or were not allowed to take rest and lunch breaks. In 2000, Walmart paid $50 million to settle a class-action suit that asserted that 69,000 current and former Walmart employees in Colorado had been forced to work off-the-clock. The company has also faced similar lawsuits in other states, including Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Minnesota. Class-action suits were also filed in 1995 on behalf of full-time Walmart pharmacists whose base salaries and working hours were reduced as sales declined, resulting in the pharmacists being treated like hourly employees.

Beginning in 2001, a lawsuit on behalf of 1.5 million women workers at Walmart was filed against the company, alleging that the company followed rules and practices that discriminated against women when it came to pay and promotions. Beginning in 2005, the class-action suit &quot;Dukes v. Walmart Stores, Inc.&quot; was heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Sociologist Dr. William Bielby provided expert opinion on the case, in which he evaluated Walmart&#x27;s employment policies and corporate culture &quot;against what social science research shows to be factors that create and sustain bias and those that minimize bias&quot; and claimed there was gender bias. In 2011, for the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Walmart v. Dukes&quot;, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia rejected Bielby&#x27;s testimony, saying it was &quot;worlds away&quot; from proof. The Supreme Court threw out the lawsuit in a 5–4 vote, ruling that the plaintiffs did not meet the rules to proceed as a class.

On October 16, 2006, approximately 200 workers on the morning shift at a Walmart Super Center in Hialeah Gardens, Florida, walked out in protest against new store policies and rallied outside the store, shouting &quot;We want justice&quot; and criticizing the company&#x27;s recent policies as &quot;inhuman&quot;. This marks the first time that Walmart had faced a worker-led revolt of such scale, according to both employees and the company. Reasons for the revolt included cutting full-time hours, a new attendance policy, and pay caps that the company imposed in August 2006, compelling workers to be available to work any shift (day, swing or night), and that shifts would be assigned by computers at corporate headquarters and not by local managers. Walmart quickly held talks with the workers, addressing their concerns. Walmart asserts that its policy permits associates to air grievances without fear of retaliation.

A 2004 report by Democratic United States Representative George Miller alleged that in ten percent of Walmart&#x27;s stores, nighttime employees were locked inside, holding them prisoner. There has been some concern that Walmart&#x27;s policy of locking its nighttime employees in the building has been implicated in a longer response time to dealing with various employee emergencies, or weather conditions such as hurricanes in Florida. Walmart said this policy was to protect the workers and the store&#x27;s contents in high-crime areas and acknowledges that some employees were inconvenienced in some instances for up to an hour as they had trouble locating a manager with the key. However, fire officials confirm that at no time were fire exits locked or employees blocked from escape. Walmart has advised all stores to ensure the door keys are available on site at all times.

In January 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on an internal Walmart audit, conducted in July 2000, which examined one week&#x27;s time-clock records for roughly 25,000 employees. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, the audit, &quot;pointed to extensive violations of child-labor laws and state regulations requiring time for breaks and meals&quot;, including 1,371 instances of minors working too late, during school hours, or for too many hours in a day. There were 60,767 missed breaks and 15,705 lost meal times. Walmart&#x27;s vice president for communications responded that company auditors had determined that the methodology used by &quot;The New York Times&quot; was flawed, and the company &quot;did not respond to it in any way internally.&quot;

Walmart has been accused of allowing undocumented workers to work in its stores. In one case, federal investigators say Walmart executives knew that contractors were using undocumented workers as they had been helping the federal government with an investigation for the previous three years. Some critics said that Walmart directly hired undocumented workers, while Walmart says they were employed by contractors who won bids to work for Walmart.

On October 23, 2003, federal agents raided 61 Walmart stores in 21 United States states in a crackdown known as &quot;Operation Rollback&quot;, resulting in the arrests of 250 nightshift janitors who were undocumented. Following the arrests, a grand jury convened to consider charging Walmart executives with labor racketeering crimes for knowingly allowing undocumented workers to work at their stores. The workers themselves were employed by agencies Walmart contracted with for cleaning services. Walmart blamed the contractors, but federal investigators point to wiretapped conversations showing that executives knew some workers did not have the correct documentation. The October 2003 raid was not the first time Walmart was found using unauthorized workers. Earlier raids in 1998 and 2001 resulted in the arrests of 100 workers without documentation located at Walmart stores around the country.

In November 2005, 125 alleged undocumented workers were arrested while working on construction of a new Walmart distribution center in eastern Pennsylvania. According to Walmart, the workers were employees of Walmart&#x27;s construction subcontractor.

=== Allegations of wrongful termination ===
On January 13, 2011, four employees at a Walmart in Layton, Utah were confronted by a shoplifter who pulled out a handgun and took one of the employees hostage in an attempt to leave a small, closed office. The other three employees disarmed and subdued the shoplifter, and all four held onto the man until police arrived. A week later, the four employees were fired for violating a company policy requiring employees to &quot;disengage&quot; and &quot;withdraw&quot; from any situation involving a weapon. The four fired employees, together with two other Walmart employees who had been fired after subduing violent customers, sued Walmart in the United States federal court in June 2011. After the Utah Supreme Court ruled (in response to a request from a federal judge) that Utah law prohibited the firing of workers for defending themselves from injury or death, Walmart and the workers settled the case on undisclosed terms.

On July 9, 2013, an employee at a Walmart in Kemptville, Ontario, confronted a customer who had left his dog locked in his truck with the windows rolled up. She called the police when the customer refused to solve the problem. She was fired later the same day, reportedly on the grounds of &quot;being rude to a customer&quot;, after rejecting instructions from her manager that such incidents should be reported to the store management rather than directly to the police.

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has long had the goal of protecting workers, whether unionized or not, who engage in concerted activity by speaking with each other regarding conditions, wages, and/or benefits. The NLRB has recently stated that this also applies to social media. The key point is whether or not the intent appears to be to communicate with fellow employees. And Walmart&#x27;s official policy is viewed as acceptable and not overly restrictive in this regard, revised in part after consultations with the NLRB. However, in practice, Walmart may not always follow such a policy. For example, a September 2013 article in &quot;The Atlantic Wire&quot;, reports the case of a 17-year veteran of Walmart&#x27;s Paramount, California location who started at $5.50 an hour as an overnight stocker and became a manager in housewares. &quot;For 14 years I was a model associate&quot;, he states. In 2012, he became increasingly involved with OUR Walmart and was fired in May 2013. He reports that after he began speaking about labor conditions &quot;they started silencing me, by holding me to standards that they weren&#x27;t holding other associates to. We were so understaffed, and the workload placed on me [was] unsurmountable.&quot;

=== Health insurance ===
According to a September 2002 survey by the state of Georgia, one in four children of Walmart employees were enrolled in PeachCare for Kids, the state&#x27;s health-insurance program for uninsured children, compared to the state&#x27;s second-biggest employer, Publix, which had one child in the program for every 22 children of employees. A December 2004 nationwide survey commissioned by Walmart showed that the use of public-assistance health-care programs by children of Walmart workers was at a similar rate to other retailers&#x27; employees, and at rates similar to the United States population as a whole.

As of October 2005, Walmart&#x27;s health insurance covered 44% or approximately 572,000 of its 1.3 million United States workers. In comparison, Walmart rival and wholesaler Costco insures approximately 85% of its workers. In 2003 Walmart spent an average of $3,500 per employee for health care, 27% less than the retail-industry average of $4,800. When asked why so many Walmart workers choose to enroll in state health care plans instead of Walmart&#x27;s own plan, Walmart CEO Lee Scott acknowledged that some states&#x27; benefits may be more generous than Walmart&#x27;s own plan: &quot;In some of our states, the public program may actually be a better value – with relatively high income limits to qualify, and low premiums.&quot; Critics of Walmart say in &quot;Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price&quot; that employees are paid so little they cannot afford health insurance.

On October 26, 2005, a Walmart internal memo sent to the firm&#x27;s board of directors advised trimming over $1 billion in health care expenses by 2011 through measures such as attracting a younger, implicitly healthier work force by offering education benefits. The memo also suggested giving sedentary Walmart staffers, such as cashiers, more physically demanding tasks, such as &quot;cart-gathering&quot;, and eliminating full-time positions in favor of hiring part-time employees who would be ineligible for the more expensive health insurance and several policy proposals which may violate the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The memo also accused Walmart&#x27;s lower paid employees of abusing emergency room visits, &quot;possibly due to their prior experience with programs such as Medicaid&quot;, whereas such visits may actually be due to the reduced ability of uninsured or underinsured people to make timely appointments to see a regular physician.

On January 12, 2006, the Maryland legislature enacted a law requiring that all corporations with more than 10,000 employees in the state spend at least eight percent of their payroll on employee benefits, or pay into a state fund for the uninsured. Walmart, with about 17,000 employees in Maryland, was the only known company to not meet this requirement before the bill passed. On July 7, 2006, the Maryland law was overturned in federal court by a United States District judge who held that a federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), preempted the Maryland law. The judge said the law would &quot;hurt Walmart by imposing the administrative burden of tracking benefits in Maryland differently than in other states.&quot;

On April 17, 2006, Walmart announced it was making a health care plan available to part-time workers after one year of service, instead of the prior two-year requirement. By January 2007, the number of workers enrolled in the company&#x27;s health care plans increased by 8%, which Walmart attributed to the introduction of less expensive insurance policies. However, even with this increase, less than half of Walmart&#x27;s employees, or 47.4%, received health insurance through the company, with 10%, or 130,000, receiving no coverage at all.

In March 2008, Walmart sued a former Walmart employee, Deborah Shank, to recover the money it spent for her health care after she was brain-damaged, restricted to a wheelchair, and nursing home-bound after her minivan was hit by a truck. Walmart sued the former employee for $470,000 after she received a settlement from the accident, citing that company policy forbids employees from receiving coverage if they also win a settlement in a lawsuit. After a wave of bad publicity, Walmart dropped its suit.

In 2011, Walmart stopped providing health insurance for part-time employees working under 24 hours per week. In 2013, health insurance benefits will not be available to employees who work fewer than 30 hours per week. Experts in labor and health care observed that the change will shift the burden of providing health care for Walmart employees to the federal government, as eligibility for Medicaid has been expanded under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA or ACA). An analysis of Walmart&#x27;s health plans as compared to plans offered in the ACA&#x27;s health insurance marketplaces found that Walmart&#x27;s plans have larger networks of providers than most plans in the marketplaces, and that gross premiums (before accounting for tax credits) are less expensive under Walmart&#x27;s plans.

In October 2014, Walmart announced that they were cutting benefits for all associates working under 30 hours a week, which is said to affect roughly 30,000 (2%) of Walmart&#x27;s workforce. The company acknowledged a $500 million jump in health care expenses as the primary reason for their decision. Walmart executive Sally Welborn stated in a blog post, &quot;This year, the expenses were significant and led us to make some tough decisions as we begin our annual enrollment.&quot;

=== Labor union opposition ===
Walmart has been criticized for its policies against labor unions. Critics blame workers&#x27; reluctance to join the labor union on Walmart anti-union tactics such as managerial surveillance and pre-emptive closures of stores or departments who choose to unionize. Walmart claims that it is not anti-union but &quot;pro-associate&quot;, arguing that its employees do not need to pay third parties to discuss problems with management as the company&#x27;s open-door policy enables employees to lodge complaints and submit suggestions all the way up the corporate ladder. In 1970, Walmart&#x27;s late founder Sam Walton resisted a unionization push by the Retail Clerks International Union in two small Missouri towns by hiring a professional union buster to conduct an anti-union campaign. On the union buster&#x27;s advice, Walton also took steps to show his workers how the company had their best interests in mind, encouraging them to air concerns with managers and implementing a profit-sharing program. A few years later, Walmart hired a consulting firm, Alpha Associates, to develop a union avoidance program.

In 2000, meat cutters in Jacksonville, Texas, voted to unionize. Walmart subsequently eliminated in-house meat-cutting jobs in favor of prepackaged meats, claiming that the measure would cut costs and prevent lawsuits. Walmart said that the nationwide closing of in-store meat packaging had been planned for many years and was not related to the unionization. In June 2003, a National Labor Relations Board judge ordered Walmart to restore the meat department to its prior structure, complete with meat-cutting, and to recognize and bargain with the union over the effects of any change to case-ready meat sales.

Walmart&#x27;s anti-union policies also extend beyond the United States. The documentary &quot;Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price&quot;, shows one successful unionization of a Walmart store in Jonquière, Quebec, Canada, in 2004, but Walmart closed the store five months later because the company did not approve of the new &quot;business plan&quot; a union would require. In September 2005, the Québec Labor Board ruled that the closing of a Walmart store amounted to a reprisal against unionized workers and has ordered additional hearings on possible compensation for the employees, though it offered no details.

In March 2005, Walmart executive Tom Coughlin was forced to resign from its board of directors, facing charges of embezzlement. Coughlin said that the money was used for an anti-union project involving cash bribes paid to employees of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union in exchange for a list of names of Walmart employees that had signed union cards. He also said that the money was unofficially paid to him, by Walmart, as compensation for his anti-union efforts. In August 2006, Coughlin pleaded guilty to stealing money, merchandise, and gift cards from Walmart, but avoided prison time due to his poor health. He was sentenced to five years probation and required to pay a $50,000 fine and $411,000 in restitution to Walmart and the Internal Revenue Service. A United States attorney has stated that no evidence was found to back up Coughlin&#x27;s initial claims, and Walmart continues to deny the existence of the anti-union program, though Coughlin himself apparently restated those claims to reporters after his conviction.

Walmart has also had some run-ins with the German Ver.di labor union as well. These issues, combined with cultural differences and low performing stores, led Walmart to pull out of the German market entirely in 2006.

In August 2006, Walmart announced that it would allow workers at all of its Chinese stores to become members of trade unions, and that the company would work with the state-sanctioned All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) on representation for its 28,000 staff. However, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has been criticized because it is the only trade union in China and as a tool of the government, ACFTU has been seen as not acting in the best interest of its members (workers), bowing to government pressure on industry growth and not defending workers&#x27; rights.

In November 2012, the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers joined with several Walmart workers with a plan to go on strike on Black Friday at several stores nationwide in protest to low pay, an increase in health insurance premiums, and not being given the option to have the day off or having Thanksgiving off. Walmart has countered this by saying that the strike is illegal due to the union not being sanctioned by the company, and that the striking workers are a small minority of the company&#x27;s workforce, with the vast majority of workers willing and ready to work the retail industry&#x27;s busiest day of the year.

In May 2013, Walmart employees associated with a union-backed labor group called OUR Walmart began what it says will be the first &quot;prolonged strikes&quot; in Walmart&#x27;s history.

For Thanksgiving 2013, CNN estimates that approximately a million United States Walmart employees would work over the course of the holiday, with big specials starting at 6:00 pm on Thanksgiving Day. The company stated that employees would receive &quot;a nice Thanksgiving dinner at work&quot;, extra &quot;holiday pay&quot;, and 25% discount off one purchase, regardless of how many items are purchased at that time. According to the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;, the extra holiday pay equaled the average daily shift the employee worked during the previous two weeks. Walmart would also expand its one-hour guarantee from three items the year before to twenty-one items. This means that a customer standing in line for such an item from 6–7 pm or from 8–9 pm would be guaranteed to get it at that price some point before Christmas.

In July 2019, the Walmart subreddit was flooded with pro-union memes in a protest to the firing of an employee who posted confidential material to the subreddit. Many of these posts were angry with Walmart surveying its staff on the Internet. The posting of the union content is in a response to the aforementioned alleged anti-union position Walmart has taken in the past.

===Surveillance patent===
In July 2018, Walmart was granted a patent titled &quot;Listening to the Frontend&quot; for audio surveillance technology that could allow it to record employees as well as its shoppers. The company says the technology could help it boost worker productivity by generating performance metrics for each employee based on cashier area sounds, such as checkout scanner beeps, and even conversations. It would not say whether it plans to actually implement the multi-sensor system.

=== Gender and sexual orientation ===
In 2007, a gender discrimination lawsuit, &quot;Dukes v. Walmart Stores, Inc.&quot;, was filed against Walmart, alleging that female employees were discriminated against in matters regarding pay and promotions. A class action suit was sought, which would have been the nation&#x27;s largest in history, covering 1.5 million past and current employees. On June 20, 2011, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Walmart&#x27;s favor, stating that the plaintiffs did not have enough in common to constitute a class. The court ruled unanimously that because of the variability of the plaintiffs&#x27; circumstances, the class action could not proceed as presented, and furthermore, in a 54 decision that it could not proceed as any kind of class action suit. Several plaintiffs, including the lead plaintiff, Betty Dukes, expressed their intent to file individual discrimination lawsuits separately.

According to a consultant hired by plaintiffs in a sex discrimination lawsuit, in 2001, Walmart&#x27;s EEOC filings showed that female employees made up 65 percent of Walmart&#x27;s hourly paid workforce, but only 33percent of its management. Just 35 percent of its store managers were women, compared to 57 percent at similar retailers. Walmart says comparisons with other retailers are unfair, because it classifies employees differently; if department managers were included in the totals, women would make up 60 percent of the managerial ranks. Others have criticized the lawsuit as without basis in the law and as an abuse of the class action mechanism. In 2007, Walmart was named by the National Association for Female Executives as one of the top 35 companies for Executive Women.

Walmart&#x27;s rating on the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s Corporate Equality Index, a measure of how companies treat LGBT employees and customers, has increased greatly during the past decade. The company was praised for expanding its anti-discrimination policy protecting gay and lesbian employees, as well as for a new definition of &quot;family&quot; that included same-sex partners. However, they have been criticized by the HRC in other areas, such as not renewing its membership in the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.

In January 2006, Walmart announced that &quot;diversity efforts include new groups of minority, female and gay employees that meet at Walmart headquarters in Bentonville to advise the company on marketing and internal promotion. There are seven Business Resource Groups: women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, Gays and Lesbians, and a disabled group.&quot;

== Poorly run and understaffed stores ==
In 2015, the Walmart CEO acknowledged a need for Walmart to refocus on cleanliness and tidiness, restocking shelves quickly, integration with digital, sideline businesses such as gas stations and care clinics, better selection such as in fresh produce, and correcting the situation in which Walmart prices were not always as low as those of competitors.

In a January 2012 article in the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;, Professor Zeynep Ton stated, &quot;Moreover, the financial benefits of cutting employees are direct, immediate, and easy to measure, whereas the less-desirable effects are indirect, long term, and difficult to measure.&quot; A lot of retailers, including Walmart, evaluate managers by a ratio of sales to payroll expense. Managers do not have direct control over sales, almost never making decisions on merchandise mix, layout, or pricing. However, they very much have direct control over payroll and when sales numbers drop, such managers are quick to reduce payroll. That is, labor ends up being treated as a cost driver rather than a sales driver. At times, these pressures have even been such that Walmart managers placed pressure on employees to &quot;work off the clock&quot;, a form of wage theft. As counter examples of companies which are both price leaders and invest in their employees, Prof. Ton points to QuikTrip convenience stores, Mercadona and Trader Joe&#x27;s supermarkets, and Costco wholesale clubs.

In February 2013, Walmart received an American Customer Satisfaction Index rating of 71 as compared to 81 for Target, placing Walmart last for the year among retail and department stores. According to &quot;Bloomberg News&quot;, this marks the sixth year in a row Walmart has either finished last or tied for last.

According to a March 2013 &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; article, during the last five years Walmart added 455 United States stores for a 13% increase. During this same period, its overall United States employees including Sam&#x27;s Clubs employees went down ever so slightly at 1.4% which translates to a reduction of 20,000 employees. In Wisconsin, an employee who oversees grocery deliveries and who is a member of OUR Walmart reports that the store is a long way from the previous mantra of &quot;in the door and to the floor&quot;. Instead, merchandise ready for the sales floor remains on pallets and in steel bins in the back of the store with &quot;no passable aisles&quot;. Professor Zeynep Ton states that companies can get in a downward spiral where too few labor hours lead to operational problems and lower sales and these reduced sales then become a rationale to reduce labor hours even further. &quot;It requires a wake-up call at a higher level&quot;, she said. A customer from Delaware states that the cosmetics section &quot;looked like someone raided it&quot; and &quot;You hate to see a company self-destruct, but there are other places to go.&quot; A customer in California states, &quot;You wait 20, 25 minutes for someone to help you, then the person was not trained on mixing paint. It was like, you have to help them help you.&quot;

An April 3, 2013 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article cites &quot;Supermarket News&quot; that Walmart&#x27;s grocery prices are usually about 15 percent cheaper than competitors. At the start of 2007, the company had an average of 338 employees for each Walmart and Sam&#x27;s Club store in the United States, and by April 2013, this had reduced to an average of 281 employees per store. Terrie Ellerbee, associate editor of grocery publication &quot;The Shelby Report&quot;, traced the problem to 2010 when Walmart reduced the number of different merchandise items carried in an attempt to make stores less cluttered. Customers did not like this change, and Walmart added the merchandise back, but did not add employees back.

An April 5, 2013, article in the &quot;Consumerist&quot; includes photographs of Walmart shelves which are only partially stocked, primarily in health and beauty products. One employee is quoted as saying, &quot;As soon as we get a full crew we start to lose people through them quitting or being fired. Management seems to wait until we need 6 or 7 people, then we get a rash of new hires.&quot; And another employee is quoted as saying, &quot;they make the rest of us work faster and harder, saying the task manager system, which is basically a [point-of-sale] system telling them how long it should take us to do our job, says we should be done already or we&#x27;re taking too long.&quot;

An April 9, 2013 article in &quot;Time Business &amp; Money&quot; reported that some Walmart stores have cut labor hours so much that they were having trouble physically moving merchandise from the back onto stores shelves. However, even with these problems, Walmart was performing better than Target in the measure of retail turnover, turning over its entire inventory 8 times a year as compared to 6.4 for Target. Walmart states it has 90% to 95% in-stock, but given inventory levels in United States stores, even this means the company could be foregoing $1.29 billion to $2.58 billion in potential sales. The article&#x27;s author writes that no amount of &quot;computer wizardry&quot; will eliminate the need for human beings to also move merchandise onto shelves. The author further writes that Walmart&#x27;s whole business model is based on reducing the carrying costs of unsold merchandise, and any speed bump along the line adds back costs. Front-end managers are supposed to open another register any time there are more than three customers in line, but these employees have to come from some other part of the store, and the night crew may or may not be able to catch up.

In September 2013, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; reported that Walmart will be offering 35,000 part-time employees full-time jobs and will be offering another 35,000 temporary employees permanent part-time positions. Walmart will also be looking to hire 55,000 seasonal employees for the upcoming holiday season. This compares to 120,000 jobs Walmart has cut over the last five years. This number does conflict with the 20,000 jobs cut from the above &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; of March 2013.

For Thanksgiving 2013 specials, Walmart included twenty-one items which included a one-hour guarantee, where customers would pay at that time and then go online to arrange delivery to a store of their choice by Christmas. However, there were problems and delays for some customers when they went online to register their access codes and paid gift certificates.

In February 2014, a local NBC affiliate in Troy, Alabama, United States, showed photographs of empty shelves and aired customer complaints, with one customer stating, &quot;And merchandise? When you don&#x27;t have any salt on the shelf, no matter what brand, that&#x27;s pretty bad.&quot; Regarding the cleanliness and repair of restrooms, another customer stated, &quot;The bathrooms? They have things that are broken in there and instead of fixing the problem, they have a trash bag taped over it, and it smells horrible.&quot; The reporter who was taking photographs was approached by three persons who identified themselves as managers and escorted out of the store. Within 24 hours, perhaps motivated by the fact that the story did appear on TV, Walmart&#x27;s corporate office sent additional employees from neighboring stores to this store.

== No AEDs in stores (automated external defibrillators) ==
Many Walmart stores have no AEDs, which has led to criticism from those who have needed them whilst in their premises.

In 2011, the Walmart store in Kirksville, Missouri, had an opportunity to participate in a local program which placed 26 AEDs in various schools, churches, and businesses. The local store management was initially open to participation. However, Walmart corporate declined to participate.

In 2015 in Saskatoon, Canada, a 62-year-old man had a heart attack in a parking lot of a Walmart store. Two off-duty nurses who knew CPR offered assistance, whilst a third person ran to a different store to get that store&#x27;s AED machine, and the man survived. The man&#x27;s family criticized Walmart for not having an AED machine. The director of corporate affairs for Walmart Canada said the store has an employee on shift who is trained in first aid and CPR as is required by Canadian law, and that the company is in the process deciding whether or not to place AEDs in stores.

In 2018 in Alberta, Canada, a woman shopping with her adult daughters had a heart attack at a Walmart store. The 911 operator instructed one daughter to find an AED machine. The employee at the Walmart customer service desk did not know whether or not the store had one. Alberta law does not require AEDs in businesses, and Walmart stores in Alberta do not have them. The woman was not able to be resuscitated and died.

== Imports and globalization ==
As a large customer to most of its vendors, Walmart openly uses its bargaining power to bring lower prices to attract its customers. The company negotiates lower prices from vendors. For certain basic products, Walmart &quot;has a clear policy&quot; that prices go down from year to year. If a vendor does not keep prices competitive with other suppliers, they risk having their brand removed from Walmart&#x27;s shelves in favor of a lower-priced competitor.

While Sam Walton was alive, Walmart had a &quot;Buy American&quot; campaign, but it was exposed shortly after he died that signs saying &quot;Buy American&quot; were on bins of Asian made products. Yet by 2005, about 60% of Walmart&#x27;s merchandise was imported, compared to 6% in 1984, although others estimated the percentage was 40% from the beginning. In 2004, Walmart spent $18 billion on Chinese products alone, and if it were an individual economy, the company would rank as China&#x27;s eighth largest trading partner, ahead of Russia, Australia, and Canada. One group estimates that the growing United States trade deficit with China, heavily influenced by Walmart imports, is estimated to have moved over 1.5 million jobs that might otherwise be in the United States to China between 1989 and 2003. According to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO), &quot;Walmart is the single largest importer of foreign-produced goods in the United States&quot;, their biggest trading partner is China, and their trade with China alone constitutes approximately 10% of the total United States trade deficit with China .

=== Overseas labor concerns ===
Walmart has been criticized for not providing adequate supervision of its foreign suppliers. It has also been criticized for using sweatshops and prison labor. In 1995, Chinese dissident Harry Wu charged that Walmart was contracting prison labor in Guangdong Province. Walmart said it did not use prison labor. There have also been reports of teenagers in Bangladesh working in sweatshops 80 hours per week at $0.14 per hour, for Walmart supplier Beximco. The documentary film &quot;Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price&quot; shows images of Walmart goods-producing factories in poor condition, and factory workers subject to abuse and conditions that the documentary producers considered inhumane.

Walmart currently uses monitoring which critics say is inadequate and &quot;leaves outsiders unable to verify&quot; conditions. Since Walmart will not release its audits or factory names, outside organizations are expected to simply accept Walmart&#x27;s claims as fact. Critics suggest an agency such as Social Accountability International or the Fair Labor Association should do the monitoring. In 2004, Walmart began working with Business for Social Responsibility, a San Francisco, California-based nonprofit organization, to reach out to groups active in monitoring overseas plants.

In June 2006, Walmart was excluded from the investment portfolio of The Government Pension Fund of Norway, which held stock values of about $430 million in the company, due to a social audit into alleged labor rights violations in Walmart operations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Although Walmart did not respond to questions from the fund&#x27;s auditors, it later said the decision &quot;[does not] appear to be based on complete information&quot;.

On November 24, 2012, a fire in a Bangladesh clothing factory resulted in the death of 112 workers. Survivors said that fire extinguishers did not work, an exit door was locked, and that when the fire alarm went off, bosses told workers to return to their sewing machines. Victims were trapped or jumped to their deaths from the eight-story building, which had no fire escapes or exits. Initially Walmart said it could not confirm that it had ever sourced apparel from the factory. However photos taken by Bangladeshi labor activists showed Walmart-branded clothing present in the factory after the fire. Walmart later said that a supplier had subcontracted work to the factory &quot;in direct violation of our policies.&quot; However, on December 4, documents revealed that at least five supplier companies had been using the Bangladesh factory to provide apparel for Walmart and its subsidiary Sam&#x27;s Club during the past year. It was also disclosed in a November 24 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that officials who had attended a 2011 Bangladesh meeting to discuss factory safety in the garment industry said that the Walmart official there had played the lead role in blocking an effort to have global retailers pay more for apparel to help Bangladesh factories improve their electrical and fire safety.

=== Allegations of bribery and coverup in Mexico ===
In 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Walmart had been made aware eight years earlier that executives of Walmart México, its subsidiary in that country, had paid millions of dollars in bribes to local officials to expedite permits for construction and operation of its many stores in that country. The company had opened many stores in Mexico in the late 1990s and early 2000s, attempting to widely establish itself before competitors could. Sergio Cicero, a lawyer who had been responsible for obtaining those permits and was bitter about being passed over for the position of general counsel with Walmart México provided the company&#x27;s corporate general counsel&#x27;s office with evidence showing that the company had made large payments to &quot;gestores&quot;, workers who deal with bureaucracies on behalf of citizens and businesses, with coded indications that the money was being passed on to officials to expedite permits.

Company officials hired a veteran FBI agent to conduct a preliminary inquiry, instead of hiring an outside law firm as it usually did for major inquiries, such as a similar one in 2003 which found that Walmart México had been helping high-volume customers evade that country&#x27;s sales taxes. The special investigative team found evidence corroborating almost all of Cicero&#x27;s allegations, and evidence suggesting that the bribery had been even more extensive, including $16 million in &quot;donations&quot; to local politicians and their organizations. They recommended opening a full investigation, and possibly notifying the Justice Department, as it appeared that both Mexican law and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) had been violated.

Executives at Walmart México chafed at the investigation, reportedly complaining that that was how business was done in the country. They told their counterparts at corporate headquarters that the investigators were being too aggressive, and some of the company&#x27;s top executives apparently agreed. Feeling Walmart had had enough bad publicity in recent years, they allowed the investigation to be concluded by a short report from José Luis Rodríguezmacedo, the head of Walmart México, who had himself been suspected of involvement. It largely blamed Cicero, claiming he had fabricated the allegations to conceal his own embezzlement from the company with the help of the &quot;gestores&quot;, one of whom was his wife&#x27;s law partner. Some Walmart executives found the report incomplete and contradictory, but the investigation was closed. None of the Mexican executives investigated were ever disciplined, and some were even promoted afterwards.

In December 2011, several months before the story broke, Walmart announced it had begun an internal review of its FCPA compliance procedures. It was unclear how the Justice Department might respond. While the FCPA&#x27;s five-year statute of limitations appeared to bar prosecution under that statute, falsified financial statements in the years since could be seen as obstruction of justice under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and acts taken to conceal the bribery investigation subsequent to 2007 could constitute conspiracy.

== Product selection ==
Walmart&#x27;s product selection has been criticized by some groups in the past, primarily as viewed as a promotion of a particular ideology or as a response to its original rural, religious and conservative target market. In 2003, Walmart removed certain men&#x27;s magazines from its shelves, such as &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;FHM&quot;, and &quot;Stuff&quot;, citing customer complaints regarding their sexual content. Later that year, it decided to partly obscure the covers of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, and &quot;Redbook&quot; on store shelves due to &quot;customer concerns&quot;, and refused to stock an issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s swimsuit special because it objected to one photograph.

Since 1991, Walmart has not carried music albums marked with the Recording Industry Association of America&#x27;s (RIAA&#x27;s) Parental Advisory Label (although it allows R-rated movies and video games rated &quot;Mature&quot;), although it carries edited versions of such albums, with obscenities removed or overdubbed with less offensive lyrics. In one example in 2005, Walmart rejected the original cover of country singer Willie Nelson&#x27;s reggae album, &quot;Countryman&quot;, which featured marijuana leaves, in a pro-marijuana statement. To satisfy Walmart, the record label, Lost Highway Records, issued the album with an alternative cover, without recalling the original cover. In 2009 Green Day refused to make an edited version of their album &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot; for Walmart, with frontman Billie Joe Armstrong claiming &quot;You feel like you&#x27;re in 1953 or something&quot;, thus the album is not carried by Walmart. However albums carrying the label can be found in Canadian Walmart stores, for example.

In 1999, Walmart announced that it would not stock emergency contraception pills in its pharmacies, not citing any particular reasons except for a &quot;business decision&quot; that was made earlier. The move was criticized by family planning advocates, saying that women in small towns where Walmart pharmacies had little competition would have greater difficulties in obtaining the drug. The decision was challenged in 2006, as three Massachusetts women filed suit against the company after they were unable to purchase emergency contraception at their local Walmart stores, resulting in a ruling that required Walmart to stock the drug in all of its pharmacies in Massachusetts. Expecting that other states would soon do the same, Walmart reversed its policy and announced that it would begin to stock the drug nationwide, while at the same time maintaining its conscientious objection policy, allowing any Walmart pharmacy employee who does not feel comfortable dispensing a prescription to refer customers to another pharmacy.

Walmart has also been criticized for selling some controversial products. For example, in 2004 Walmart carried the anti-Semitic hoax &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; in its online catalogue. The Jewish civil rights organization Anti-Defamation League wrote to the President of Walmart in September 2008 noting the text, &quot;has been the major weapon in the arsenals of anti-Semites around the world&quot;, and called on Walmart to, &quot;unequivocally state the nature of the book and to disassociate itself from any endorsement of it.&quot; Walmart stopped selling the book shortly thereafter.

In October 2004, Walmart canceled its order for &quot;The Daily Show&#x27;s&quot; &quot;America (The Book)&quot; after discovering a page that depicts each US Supreme Court judge nude. A week later, it returned copies of comedian George Carlin&#x27;s &quot;When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?&quot;, with a cover recreating &quot;The Last Supper&quot; with Jesus&#x27; seat empty and Carlin seated next to it. The company said that the copies were shipped to it by mistake and a Walmart spokeswoman said she did not &quot;believe this particular product would appeal&quot; to its customer base.

In January 2006, Walmart was criticized for the recommendation system on its website which suggested that some black-related DVDs, such as &quot;Introducing Dorothy Dandridge&quot; and documentaries on Baptist minister and civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. were similar to the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; television series DVD box set. It quickly corrected the page, saying that it was a software glitch, but ultimately blamed the matter on human error.

A December 2007 report published by the Environmental Investigation Agency, a non-governmental agency, revealed that some furniture sold at Walmart was made from wood which had been illegally logged in protected Russian habitats for Siberian tigers and other wildlife. This led the company to investigate its suppliers and promise to eliminate products made from illegal wood by 2013. They also joined the Global Forest &amp; Trade Network, an organization dedicated to eliminating illegal logging.

In 2015, Walmart stopped selling military-style semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15. In 2018 it stopped selling firearms and ammunition to 18-20 year olds, which led to a lawsuit.

In 2017, Walmart was sued for selling fake craft beer. The beer is labeled and marketed as being produced by the non-existent &quot;Trouble Brewery&quot; but is actually made by WX Brands, a large corporate brewery that also makes Genesee beer.

At the end of 2017, Walmart removed T-shirts which implied a promotion of violence, with the words &quot;Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some Assembly Required&quot;. Executive Director Dan Shelley of the Radio Television Digital News Association said that while RTDNA is &quot;a fierce proponent of the First Amendment that is politically nonpartisan&quot; and that Walmart is within its legal rights to sell the T-shirt, &quot;that doesn&#x27;t mean it is the right thing to do.&quot; A Walmart spokesperson said the shirt &quot;clearly violates our policy.&quot;

In May 2019, Walmart was sued by the Center For Inquiry (CFI) for selling homeopathic products on the shelf next to traditional medicine. The CFI, a not-for-profit educational organization, stated in the complaint that Walmart &quot;uses marketing, labeling, and product placement to falsely present homeopathic products as equivalent alternatives to science-based medicines, and to represent homeopathic products as effective treatments for specific diseases and symptoms.&quot; Nicholas Little of CFI said that homeopathic products should remain legal to purchase, but should be labelled products honestly. The FDA currently does not regulate homeopathic products, but in recent years has signaled their intent to regulate the industry to a higher level. This follows on from a similar lawsuit filed by CFI against pharmacy chain CVS in 2018. Walmart responded by stating &quot;Our Equate private label homeopathic products are designed to include information directly stating that the claims are not based on accepted medical evidence and have not been evaluated by the FDA. We take allegations like these seriously and will respond as appropriate with the court.&quot; In an August 2019 interview, Little commented that &quot;The problem is the government agencies (the FDA and FTC) aren&#x27;t doing their job. ... The FDA and FTC have rules and guidelines, but they don&#x27;t enforce them.&quot; In July, 2019, CFI announced that the Stiefel Freethought Foundation was contributing an additional $150,000 to the previously committed $100,000 to support the two lawsuits.

In December 2020, the United States Department of Justice sued Walmart after it was discovered that it contributed to the opioid epidemic in the United States by filling illegal prescriptions of controlled substances and failing to report suspicious orders to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Walmart stopped distributing controlled substances in 2018. Walmart accused the DoJ of cherry-picking, claiming that pharmacists refuse to fill most illegally prescribed drugs from questionable doctors and sent &quot;tens of thousands of investigative leads to&quot; the DEA.

== Taxes ==
Until the mid-1990s, Walmart took out corporate-owned life insurance policies on its employees including &quot;low-level&quot; employees such as janitors, cashiers, and stockers. This type of insurance is usually purchased to cover a company against financial loss when a high-ranking employee (i.e. management) dies, and is usually known as &quot;key person insurance&quot;. Critics derided Walmart as buying what they called &quot;dead peasants insurance&quot; or &quot;janitor insurance&quot;. Critics, as well as the United States Internal Revenue Service, charge that the company was trying to profit from the deaths of its employees, and take advantage of the tax law which allowed it to deduct the premiums. The practice was stopped in the mid-1990s when the federal government closed the tax deduction and began to pursue Walmart for back taxes.

== Animal welfare ==
Walmart committed in 2016 to only sourcing cage-free eggs by 2025. The &quot;cage-free&quot; label is inconsistent in the U.S. and is not the same as &quot;free-range&quot;.

On November 28, 2016, Paola Gaviño in coordination with the animal protection NGOs, The Humane League and Mercy For Animals, launched a multinational campaign to raise awareness of Walmart&#x27;s failure to produce a policy to source 100% cage-free eggs throughout Latin America. Walmart has not committed to phasing out battery cages in Latin America as it has in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The campaign argues that battery cages are unnecessarily cruel and also increase the risk of food safety issues, including an increased risk of Salmonella contamination.

==Midtown Walmart==
Midtown Walmart was a proposal by Walmart to build a supercenter location on a site in the planned sub-district of Midtown Miami in the city of Miami, Florida, US.

Walmart&#x27;s Midtown plan was rejected the first time in February 2013, but was redesigned by Gensler and approved by Miami Planning and Zoning Director Francisco Garcia in August 2013, then upheld on appeal by the City Commission in November 2013, Midtown Walmart faced public and political opposition from area residents, business owners, and community activists after being adapted to meet strict zoning regulations that resulted in the design differing from the typical layout, such as utilizing second story roof parking versus a surface lot with more street liner retail spaces instead of a wall perimeter.

The original 2013 plan included 550 parking spaces on two levels above the store.

Walmart did build urban locations in Santurce, (downtown) San Juan, Puerto Rico, known as &quot;Plaza 18&quot;, as well as Washington, D.C., where the city&#x27;s first Walmart is a true mixed-use development, with third party retail as well as 300 apartments above the store. Walmart&#x27;s plan in Midtown Miami was not an urban store, but rather a suburban-style Super Center with parking in two floors above the ground level, instead of in an open lot. If built, it would be the first traditional Walmart location within the City of Miami limits, although there are numerous locations just outside city limits in Doral, Hialeah, Gladeview, North Miami Beach, and Westchester, as well as a &quot;Neighborhood Market&quot; in the western fringes of the city.

Purchased in October 2011, the retailer closed on the sale in January 2014 for US$8.2 million, the currently vacant site sits at the southern tip of Midtown between North Miami Avenue and Midtown Boulevard from Northeast 29th and 31st Streets, between the burgeoning neighborhoods of Wynwood and Edgewater.

After two years of litigation, Walmart won their first court battle in August 2015. The litigation once again targeted the city&#x27;s departure from the law by providing Walmart illegal zoning variances and the illegal street re-configuration caused by the development which would contribute excessively to local traffic problems.

The Midtown development contains a Target and a Ross.

The Walmart broke ground with an illegal permit from the City of Miami in January 2016, after a panel of state judges in the 3rd District Court of Appeals blocked a petition challenging the development.

In 2016, Stern won a judgment against the City of Miami in a public records lawsuit related to Walmart&#x27;s plan to build in Midtown Miami. That case proved Stern&#x27;s claims that Walmart did not hold good title to all the land upon which they obtained a permit to build from the city. As a result, the City of Miami froze their permit and eventually, construction of the Walmart was involuntarily halted when the City revoked their foundation permit on June 21, 2016, and construction ceased at the site within the week, which is how Walmart&#x27;s vacant Midtown site remains.

In September 2019, Walmart sold its land for $26.4 million.

== Opioids settlement ==

On December 22, 2020, the United States Department of Justice filed an official complaint towards Walmart pharmacies for failing to comply with the Controlled Substances Act, by prescribing opioids and other restricted substances to its customers.

Under the presiding of former attorney general William Barr, the Walmart corporate and the United States Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration went to court in attempt to resolve the issue. Other pharmacies were also pulled into this legal case for similarly defying the Controlled Substances Act. Many large pharmaceutical companies, such as Walgreens, Sam&#x27;s Club &amp; CVS Pharmacy were included in this case.

Within the lawsuit, the United States Department of Justice argued that Walmart pressured pharmacists to refill as many prescriptions as fast as possible. They also argued that the all pharmacies in the United States have to comply with federal law before refilling a prescription. Walmart counter-argued that every individual pharmacist must make the decision to refill a prescription or not.

After deliberations, the jury sided with the United States Department of Justice. All the companies involved were forced to pay a total of 3.1 billion dollars in restitution and damages, and were banned from dispensing opioids to consumers.

<text>Larry Beinhart is an America novelist, columnist, and blogger. He is best known as the author of the political and detective novel &quot;American Hero&quot;, which was adapted into the political-parody film &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;.

== Biography ==
Beinhart has indicated that an early inspiration was the works of George Bernard Shaw, who besides his writing skills and wit, &quot;created dramas out of ideas&quot;. By this dictum, Beinhart seeks to &quot;create situations in which ideas - about God, why we go to war, who gets the money, how politics work, what the media actually does, about science and morality - are challenged by circumstances&quot;. 

Beinhart spent two years at Wadham College in Oxford, England. He is the recipient of a Raymond Chandler Fulbright Fellowship in Detective and Crime Fiction Writing. His &quot;No One Rides for Free&quot; (1986) received a 1987 Edgar Award.

Beinhart has been a columnist for Al Jazeera since October 2016, at Alternet 2005-2012, and had a blog at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in 2011. His principal concerns are the US economy and politics, taxes, and the rising inequalities moving into the age of Trump. Beinhart joined the Al Jazeera TV series &quot;Empire&quot; as a behind-the-scenes consultant for the 2013 episode &quot;Empire of Secrets&quot; about the clandestine world of government secrets.

== Film adaptions ==
&quot;Wag the Dog&quot; (1997) was directed by Barry Levinson; it starred Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Anne Heche, William H. Macy, Denis Leary, Kirsten Dunst, Woody Harrelson, and Willie Nelson. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the novel &quot;a tour de force of satirical fiction.&quot;

His novel &quot;Salvation Boulevard,&quot; was adapted as a film and released in 2011. It features Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Jennifer Connelly, Marisa Tomei, Isabelle Fuhrman, Ed Harris, and Jim Gaffigan. The director is George Ratliff, the producers are Cathy Schulman and Celine Rattray.

== Personal life ==

Beinhart resides in Woodstock, New York, with his wife and two children. He is a keen skier and sometime instructor at Hunter Mountain in New York State.
