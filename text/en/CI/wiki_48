<text>The Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata or Viceroyalty of Buenos Aires ( or Virreinato de Buenos Aires or ) meaning &quot;River of the Silver&quot;, also called the &quot;Viceroyalty of River Plate&quot; in some scholarly writings, in southern South America, was the last to be organized and also the shortest-lived of one of the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire in the Americas. The name &quot;Provincias del Río de la Plata&quot; was formally adopted in 1810 during the Cortes of Cádiz to designate the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata.

The Viceroyalty was established in 1776 from several former Viceroyalty of Perú dependencies that mainly extended over the Río de la Plata Basin, roughly the present-day territories of Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, extending inland from the Atlantic Coast. The colony of Spanish Guinea (present-day Equatorial Guinea) also depended administratively on the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata. Buenos Aires, located on the western shore of the Río de la Plata estuary flowing into the Atlantic Ocean, opposite the Portuguese outpost of Colonia del Sacramento, was chosen as the capital. Usually considered one of the late Bourbon Reforms, the organization of this viceroyalty was motivated on both commercial grounds (Buenos Aires was by then a major spot for illegal trade), as well as on security concerns brought about by the growing interest of competing foreign powers in the area. The Spanish Crown wanted to protect its territory against Great Britain and the Kingdom of Portugal.

But these Enlightenment reforms proved counterproductive, or perhaps too late, to quell the colonies&#x27; demands. The entire history of this Viceroyalty was marked by growing domestic unrest and political instability. Between 1780 and 1782, the Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II inspired a violent Aymara-led revolt across the Upper Peru highlands, demonstrating the great resentment against colonial authorities by both the mestizo and indigenous populations. Twenty-five years later, the Criollos, native-born people of Spanish descent, successfully defended against two successive British attempts to conquer Buenos Aires and Montevideo. This enhanced their sense of autonomy and power at a time when Spanish troops were unable to help.

In 1809, the Criollo elite revolted against colonial authorities at La Paz and Chuquisaca, establishing revolutionary governments or . Although short-lived, retroversion of the sovereignty to the people provided a theoretical basis for the legitimacy of the locally based governments (temporarily in the absence of a legitimate king in Spain). These events proved decisive at the 1810 May Revolution events deposing Viceroy Cisneros at Buenos Aires.

The name &quot;Provincias del Río de la Plata&quot; was formally adopted in 1810 during the Cortes of Cádiz to designate the Viceroyalty based on popular sovereignty. The revolution in Buenos Aires spread across the Spanish Provincias del Río de la Plata, against the resistance of Paraguay (which declared itself an independent nation in 1811) and the Upper Peru (which remained controlled by royalist troops from Lima, and was eventually re-incorporated into the Viceroyalty of Peru). Meanwhile, the Governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de Elío, appointed as a new Viceroy by the Spanish Government in 1811, declared the Buenos Aires Junta seditious. However, after being defeated at Las Piedras, he retained control only of Colonia del Sacramento and Montevideo. He departed by ship to Spain on 18 November and resigned in January 1812. In 1814, the revolutionary patriots entered Montevideo, following a two-year-long siege. The Viceroyalty was disestablished in 1825 as Spanish political entity with the fall of Upper Peru and the death of the last Viceroy Pedro Antonio Olañeta.

==History==
===Origin and creation===
In 1680, Manuel Lobo, Portuguese governor of Rio de Janeiro, created the Department of Colonia and founded Colónia do Sacramento. The fort was located on the coast of present-day Uruguay and developed as the department&#x27;s capital. Lobo&#x27;s chief objective was to secure the Portuguese expansion of Brazil beyond the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, which had defined areas of influence in the Americas between the Iberian nations. From 1580 to 1640, Spain had controlled Portugal and thus all of its territories in America. In 1681 José de Garro quickly attacked and seized the new fort for Spain. On 7 May 1681, under the Provisional Treaty of Lisbon, it was ceded to Portugal.

The Viceroyalty of Peru was requiring all commerce to go through the port of Lima, on the Pacific Ocean. This policy failed to develop the potential of Buenos Aires as an Atlantic port, adding months to the transport of goods and commodities in each direction. It resulted in encouraging widespread contraband activities in the eastern region, especially in Asunción, Buenos Aires and Montevideo.

Under these conditions, Viceroy Manuel de Amat y Junyent issued a decree for the former governor of the Río de la Plata, Pedro Antonio de Cevallos, to found the new viceroyalty in August 1776. The ruling was resisted by the elite of Lima, but it was enforced. The cabildo of the Captaincy General of Chile requested from the king to be excluded from the new viceroyalty, which was accepted. The Cuyo region, with its main city Mendoza, was split from the Captaincy General of Chile. Leaders in Santiago resented this action as the Cuyo region had been originally settled by Spanish colonists from Chile.

The Portuguese prime minister, Marquis of Pombal, encouraged the occupation of territory which had already been awarded to the Spanish in the Treaty of Paris (1763), following the British defeat of France in the Seven Years&#x27; War. King Charles III quickly reacted to the advantageous conditions: France was bound to be an ally as a guarantor of the treaty, and Great Britain, due to its own colonial problems with revolution in the Thirteen Colonies in North America, maintained neutrality on the issues between Portugal and Spain.

Pedro de Cevallos conquered Colonia del Sacramento and the Santa Catarina islands after a siege of three days, gaining the First Treaty of San Ildefonso. With it, the Portuguese retired from the Río de la Plata and left the Banda Oriental for Spain. In exchange Spain ceded them the area of Rio Grande do Sul, which they developed as Brazil. Cevallos ended his military actions at this point and started working with government, but he was soon replaced by Juan José Vertiz y Salcedo. The viceroyalty was tasked with promoting local production of linen and hemp as export commodity crops, to supply the Spanish cloth industries that the Bourbons sought to favor.

===The early viceroyalty===

The conditions imposed by Spain on local commerce were high, but Charles III sought to lighten the burden. He allowed commerce through Buenos Aires on Spanish flag ships that were manned with Spanish naval officers. The ports of Buenos Aires and Montevideo were included in a list of Spanish ports allowed to trade with each other, certain Spanish American products were imported tax-free to Spain, and all the cities with ports were to be assigned Consulates or Tribunals of Commerce. This was not free trade, but a predecessor to what would develop.

In the decade of 1778–1788, the commerce between Spain and Spanish America increased by nearly 700%. Buenos Aires was given a customs office in 1778, and Montevideo in 1789. Spanish policy still was directed at restricting Argentina&#x27;s commerce; the Empire banned the export of silver from Buenos Aires and tried to direct exports out of Potosí.

The system of corregimientos to mark the subdivisions of the territory was ended in 1782, and replaced with &quot;Intendencias&quot; by Charles III. The new system was intended to reinforce the royal authority and promote centralization. Buenos Aires had the main intendencia, and the other cities provincial ones. In 1778 Cevallos reinstated the Real Audiencia of Buenos Aires, by creating a new one; he maintained the Real Audiencia at Cochabamba. The Consulate of Commerce of Buenos Aires was authorized that year, but legal difficulties prevented its being established until 1794.

In 1766, Spain acquired the French colony on the Falkland Islands, called Port St. Louis; after assuming effective control in 1767, it placed the islands under a governor subordinate to the Buenos Aires colonial administration. The expulsion of the British settlement in 1770 brought the two countries to the brink of war but a peace treaty was offered by Spain &quot;to restore the port and fort called Egmont, with all the artillery and stores, according to the inventory&quot; which was accepted by Britain. However, neither side relinquished sovereignty over the Falklands.

===Decline===

By the nineteenth century, Buenos Aires was becoming more self-sufficient, producing about 600,000 head of cattle annually (of which about one quarter was consumed locally). The area was rapidly developing. But wars with Great Britain meant a great setback for the region&#x27;s economy, as maritime communications were practically paralyzed. The Upper Peru region started to show resistance to continued support of the administration and defense of the Río de la Plata estuary; it provided the main support but its silver production at Potosí was declining. In the first years of the viceroyalty, around 75% of the expenses were covered with revenues from the north. The Alto Plata (mostly present-day Paraguay) also had problems with the Buenos Aires administration, particularly because of its keeping a monopoly on exports.
The Napoleonic Wars on the Continent preoccupied the Spanish government and, after its defeat, Napoleon placed his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne. By 1805, Spain had to help France because of their 1795 alliance, and lost its navy to the British in the Battle of Trafalgar. The Spanish prime minister had warned the viceroyalty of the likelihood of a British invasion, saying it could not provide support to the city of Buenos Aires.

On 27 June 1806, a British force of around 1,500 men under Col. William Carr Beresford successfully invaded Buenos Aires. Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte had escaped to Córdoba. The British forces were thrown back by the &quot;criollos&quot; in December 1806, a militia force from Montevideo under the leadership of Santiago de Liniers. In February 1807, British reinforcements of about 8,000 men under Gen. Sir Samuel Auchmuty captured Montevideo after a fierce fight. In May Lt. Gen. John Whitelock arrived to take overall command and attacked Buenos Aires on 5 July 1807. After losing more than half his force, who were killed or captured, Whitelock signed a cease-fire and departed for Great Britain.

The criollo bourgeoisie aspirations in the face of lack of support from Spain and the defeat of a world power by local forces added to their confidence and fueled their movement toward independence. As of 1814, Argentina had been self-governed for about four years, and Paraguay had already declared its independence. The viceroyalty was effectively dissolved locally when the rebel troops entered Montevideo after a two-year-long siege. The war remained in Upper Peru until 1825.

== Administrative divisions ==

=== Kingdom of Charcas &quot;&quot; ===
The Real Audiencia of Charcas was established in 1559, but became part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776. It met in the city of La Plata until it was disestablished in 1825. It had the following provinces under its authority:

* Province of Buenos Aires (from 1776 to 1785)
* Province of Chiquitos (from 1776 to 1810)
* Province of Chuquisaca (from 1782 to 1810) &quot;&quot;
* Province of Cochabamba (from 1785 to 1810)
* Province of Córdoba del Tucumán (from 1783 to 1785)
* Province of the Guaraní Missions (from 1776 to 1785)
* Province of La Paz (from 1782 to 1810)
* Province of Montevideo (from 1776 to 1785)
* Province of Moxos (from 1776 to 1810)
* Province of Paraguay (from 1776 to 1785)
* Province of Potosí (from 1782 to 1810)

=== Kingdom of the Río de la Plata &quot;&quot; ===
The Real Audiencia of Buenos Aires was established in 1785. It met in the city of Buenos Aires until it was disestablished in 1813. It had the following provinces under its authority:

* Province of Buenos Aires (from 1785 to 1813) &quot;&quot;
* Province of Córdoba del Tucumán (from 1785 to 1810)
* Province of the Guaraní Missions (from 1785 to 1810)
* Province of Montevideo (from 1785 to 1814)
* Province of Paraguay (from 1785 to 1811)
* Province of Salta del Tucumán (from 1785 to 1810)
==Government==
The Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was created in 1776 by Charles III of Spain. Although it functioned as a Spanish colony, Río de la Plata was technically a personal possession of the King of Spain. This allowed both European Spain and its overseas territories to have their own laws and regulations.

===Dependencies===
* Intendency () of Buenos Aires: cities of Buenos Aires, Corrientes, Santa Fe, Colonia and Carmen de Patagones.
* Government () of Montevideo: city of Montevideo.
* Government of Misiones: cities of San Ignacio, Yapeyú and Candelaria.
* Intendency of Paraguay: city of Asunción
* Intendency of Córdoba: cities of Rio Cuarto, Córdoba, La Rioja, San Juan, Mendoza and San Luis
* Intendency of Salta: cities of Catamarca, Santiago del Estero, Tucumán, Salta and Jujuy
* Government of Chiquitos
* Intendency of Potosí: cities of Potosí and Oruro.
* Intendency of La Paz: city of La Paz.
* Intendency of Cochabamba: cities of Cochabamba and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.
* Intendency of Charcas: city of Charcas (modern Sucre).
* Government of Moxos

===List of viceroys===
The king of Spain appointed viceroys to govern the Spanish viceroyalties in his name. In the beginning their terms had no fixed duration and could last for life. Later he established fixed terms of three to five years. Because of the distances between Spain and South America, and with sailing as the chief means of transport, there were long delays between the designation of a viceroy and the viceroy&#x27;s effectively taking power. In addition, regular communication between the Crown and the viceroyalty was equally delayed. The viceroyalties had to operate with considerable independence and self-reliance.

<doc id="1059827" wikidata="Q7820288" url="?curid=1059827" title="Tomorrow Woman">
<text>Tomorrow Woman is a fictional character, an android in stories published in DC Comics. She debuted in &quot;JLA&quot; #5 (May 1997), and was created by Grant Morrison and Howard Porter. Within the DC Comics canon, she is created by the mad scientist super-villains Professor Ivo and T.O. Morrow. Given human-like physical characteristics and false memories of a human life, Tomorrow Woman believes herself to be a new superhero born with psionic abilities due to a &quot;four-lobed brain&quot;. Her true purpose is to infiltrate and then kill the Justice League. In her first appearance, she says she exclusively has telekinetic abilities, but a later flashback issue of &quot;JLA: Tomorrow Woman&quot; (1998) reveals that she also has telepathic abilities.

In the weekly comic book series &quot;Trinity&quot;, a different version of Tomorrow Woman appeared, a woman named Clara Kendall from a parallel Earth.

==Fictional character biography==
Tomorrow Woman is a psychic android who is created by Professor Ivo and T. O. Morrow to infiltrate and destroy the Justice League and made to believe that she is a mutant human. After joining the League, Tomorrow Woman&#x27;s programming activates, but she resists it and sacrifices herself to destroy the futuristic weapon IF with an electromagnetic pulse.

Tomorrow Woman subsequently appears in the 1998 one-shot &quot;JLA: Tomorrow Woman&quot;, which expands on her time with the League, and &quot;Hourman&quot; #2, where the third Hourman temporarily resurrects her.

===&quot;Trinity&quot;===
In &quot;Trinity&quot;, time and space are disrupted, creating unstable alternate timelines. An alternate universe variant of Tomorrow Woman appears as a member of the Justice Society International with the civilian identity of Clara Kendall. Clara later helps to restore reality, altering her timeline and transforming her into a human.

==Powers and abilities==
Tomorrow Woman is an artificial life-form, an android with artificial skin and organs who possesses telepathic and telekinetic powers. She is programmed with false memories of a cover identity and so seems to initially believe that her powers are due to her being a mutant.

Her telepathy allows her to read minds and project her thoughts. Her telepathy is focused enough to be able to forcibly free people from being mind-controlled by others without harming them in the process. She sometimes has trouble filtering out heightened emotions of people around her or even people she can perceive on television. Her telepathic defenses were strong and subtle enough that even when she became aware of her lethal programming, she was able to hide her true purpose from Martian Manhunter and Aquaman during a telepathic link. Her telekinetic blasts can stun a person without damaging them or increase in power so as to shatter steel and concrete. She can fly through telekinetic manipulation. The android Tomorrow Woman&#x27;s secret weapon was an electromagnetic pulse device that could disrupt human brain activity, killing anyone within its blast radius.

<doc id="1059850" wikidata="Q61801" url="?curid=1059850" title="Paul Gordan">
<text>Paul Albert Gordan (27 April 1837 – 21 December 1912) was a German mathematician known for work in invariant theory and for the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients and Gordan&#x27;s lemma. He was called &quot;the king of invariant theory&quot;. His most famous result is that the ring of invariants of binary forms of fixed degree is finitely generated. Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are named after him and Alfred Clebsch. Gordan also served as the thesis advisor for Emmy Noether.

==Life and Career==
Gordan was born to Jewish parents in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland), and died in Erlangen, Germany.

He received his Dr. phil. at the University of Breslau with the thesis &quot;De Linea Geodetica&quot;, (On Geodesics of Spheroids) under Carl Jacobi in 1862. He moved to Erlangen in 1874 to become professor of mathematics at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.

A famous quote attributed to Gordan about David Hilbert&#x27;s proof of Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem, a result which vastly generalized his result on invariants, is &quot;This is not mathematics; this is theology.&quot; The proof in question was the (non-constructive) existence of a finite basis for invariants. It is not clear if Gordan really said this since the earliest reference to it is 25 years after the events and after his death. Nor is it clear whether the quote was intended as criticism, or praise, or a subtle joke. Gordan himself encouraged Hilbert and used Hilbert&#x27;s results and methods, and the widespread story that he opposed Hilbert&#x27;s work on invariant theory is a myth (though he did correctly point out in a referee&#x27;s report that some of the reasoning in Hilbert&#x27;s paper was incomplete).

He later said &quot;I have convinced myself that even theology has its merits&quot;. He also published a simplified version of the proof.

<doc id="1059855" wikidata="Q2038126" url="?curid=1059855" title="Tuscarora War">
<text>The Tuscarora War was fought in North Carolina from September 10, 1711, until February 11, 1715, between the Tuscarora people and their allies on one side and European American settlers, the Yamasee, and other allies on the other. This was considered the bloodiest colonial war in North Carolina. The Tuscarora signed a treaty with colonial officials in 1718 and settled on a reserved tract of land in Bertie County, North Carolina. The war incited further conflict on the part of the Tuscarora and led to changes in the slave trade of North and South Carolina.

The first successful English settlement of North Carolina had begun in 1653. The Tuscarora lived in peace with the settlers for more than 50 years, while nearly every other colony in America was involved in some conflict with Native Americans. After the early 18th century war, most of the Tuscarora migrated north to New York. They joined the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, all Iroquoian-speaking peoples, as the sixth nation.

==History==
The Tuscarora are an Iroquoian people who are believed to have migrated from the Great Lakes area into the Piedmont centuries before European colonization. The other Iroqoian-speaking peoples were based largely in what became New York and Pennsylvania.

=== Tensions ===
As the English settled Carolina, the Tuscarora benefited from trade with the colonists. By acquiring weapons and metal goods from the English, they were able to develop commercial dominance over other tribes in the region. These benefits were experienced to a greater degree by Northern Tuscarora than their Southern counterparts, who became cut off from the prosperous Northern Tuscarora by increasing numbers of European settlers. Over time colonists continued to push into territory held by the Tuscarora. 

As the settlers moved closer to the Tuscarora and the two began interacting more frequently, conflict arose over competition for resources, shared hunting grounds and cultural differences. The Tuscarora held John Lawson accountable for his role in the settlers&#x27; expansion into their territory. Lawson&#x27;s writings emphasized the potential that the lands held for European settlement, and he was resented for his perceived role in the founding of New Bern, a settlement that encroached on Tuscarora territory. Settlers found eastern North Carolina to be swampy and difficult to farm, so they pushed westward, attracted by the more fertile uplands. As settlement expanded, their demand for workers increased demand for the Indian slave trade in the region. These factors all led to tension between the Tuscarora and the growing population of Anglo colonists.

==== Outbreak of War ====
There were two groups of Tuscarora in North Carolina in the early 18th century, a northern group led by Chief Tom Blount and a southern group was led by Chief Hancock. Blount occupied the area around Bertie County on the Roanoke River; Hancock was closer to New Bern, occupying the area south of the Pamlico River. Blount became close friends with the influential Blount family of the Bertie region, but Hancock&#x27;s people had suffered raids and kidnappings by slave traders.

Hancock&#x27;s tribe began to attack the settlers, but Blount&#x27;s tribe did not become involved in the war at this point. Some historians including Richard White and Rebecca Seaman have suggested that the war grew out of misunderstandings between the colonists and the Tuscaroras. The Southern Tuscaroras led by Hancock allied with the Bear River tribe, Coree, Cothechney, Machapunga, Mattamuskeet, Neuse, Pamlico, Senequa, and Weetock to attack the settlers in a wide range within a short time period. They attacked homesteads along the Roanoke, Neuse, and Trent rivers and in the city of Bath beginning on September 22, 1711, and killed hundreds of settlers, including several key colonial political figures, such as John Lawson of Bath, while driving off others. The Baron of Bernberg was a prisoner of the Tuscarora during the raids, and he recounted stories of women impaled on stakes, more than 80 infants slaughtered, and more than 130 settlers killed in the New Bern settlement.

== Barnwell&#x27;s expedition ==
In 1711, the North Carolina colony had been weakened by Cary&#x27;s Rebellion, and Governor Edward Hyde asked South Carolina for assistance. South Carolina sent Colonel John Barnwell with a force of 30 white officers and about 500 Native Americans from South Carolina, including Yamasee, Wateree, Congaree, Waxhaw, Pee Dee, and Apalachee. Barnwell&#x27;s expedition traveled over 300 miles and arrived in January 1712. There the force was supplemented by 50 local militiamen and attacked the Tuscarora, who retreated to Fort Neoheroka in Greene County. The Tuscarora negotiated a truce and released their prisoners.

Barnwell&#x27;s expedition did not win the war. Barnwell left for South Carolina, displeasing the North Carolina settlers who wished for a total victory over the Tuscarora. The South Carolinians were unhappy that there was no payment for their help. Additionally, some South Carolina officers retained Tuscarora to sell as slaves, which incited the Tuscarora into a new wave of attacks. These attacks came amid a yellow fever outbreak that weakened the North Carolina colony; the combined pressure caused many settlers to flee. Governor Thomas Pollack requested the aid of South Carolina.

== Chief Blount and the Moore Expedition ==
South Carolina dispatched Colonel James Moore with a force of 33 colonists and nearly 1,000 Native Americans, which arrived in December 1712. The settlers offered Blount control of the entire Tuscarora tribe if he assisted them in defeating Hancock. Blount captured Hancock, and the settlers executed him in 1712.

In 1713, the Southern Tuscarora lost their Fort Neoheroka in Greene County. Neoheroka was one of several Tuscarora forts of that time. Others include Torhunta, Innennits, and Catechna. These forts were all destroyed during the Tuscarora War by North Carolina colonists. An archaeological analysis of Fort Neoheroka indicates that the Tuscarora were adapting to modern methods of warfare in North America, specifically the advent of firearms, explosives and artillery. Ultimately, it was not the defensive limitations of the Tuscarora that cost them at Fort Neoheroka, which was in fact &quot;...equal to, if not superior to, comparable Euro-American frontier fortifications of the same era.&quot; However, the Tuscarora&#x27;s arsenal lacked a large supply of the sophisticated artillery and explosives employed by their opponents. About 950 people were killed or captured and sold into slavery in the Caribbean or New England by Colonel Moore and his South Carolina troops.

== Aftermath ==
Following the decisive defeat, many Tuscarora began a migration to New York. There they joined the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and were accepted as the Sixth Nation in 1722. Some Tuscarora bands remained in North Carolina with Blount for decades, with the last leaving for New York in 1802.

=== Further conflict ===
The Tuscarora War did not ensure lasting peace in the region. On Good Friday, April 15, 1715, a group of Native Americans attacked South Carolina. Among them were Apalachees, Savannahs, Lower Creeks, Cherokees, and Yamasees, as well as others. These were all allies of Colonels Barnwell and Moore during the Tuscarora War. This attack began what is known as the Yamasee War. The Yamasee and other tribes in South Carolina learned from the Tuscarora War that colonial settlers were heavily invested in the slave trade of Native Americans. Furthermore, the Tuscarora War had drastically cut down the number of Native Americans in the area who could be enslaved. With this in mind, the tribes of South Carolina decided on a preemptive attack. As one historian put it, &quot;[b]etter to stand together as Indians, hit the colony now before it became any stronger, kill the traders, destroy the plantations, burn Charles Town, and put an end to the slave buyers.&quot; During the Yamasee War, Col. Maurice Moore, the brother of Colonel James Moore, led a regiment in the battle against the Yamasee. Among his regiment were some seventy Tuscarora warriors who were keen to fight against the Yamasee, a tribe who had fought against them during the Tuscarora War. Following the Yamasee War, these Tuscarora were asked by South Carolina officials to remain in South Carolina as their allies and to protect the colony from Spain and its Native American allies. As part of the arrangement, South Carolina would return to the Tuscarora one slave taken during the Tuscarora War for each Tuscarora killed in the line of duty and for each enemy Native American they captured. During this time, the Tuscarora came to be so well respected by the South Carolina government that they were given land in the colony. The Yamasee War and other conflicts between the remaining Tuscarora and other Native American groups in the region are examples of how the Tuscarora War destabilized relationships among southern Native Americans.

=== Effect on slavery ===
The Tuscarora War and the Yamasee War were turning points in the Carolinas&#x27; slave trade. By 1717, South Carolina began to regulate its slave trade. Additionally, after two wars between colonists and Native Americans, the number of Native Americans available to be enslaved had fallen considerably. The most valuable role of Native Americans also shifted during this time from slave to ally because of the ongoing power struggle between the French and English to control North America. Because colonists sought to ally themselves with Native Americans, the enslavement of Black Americans began to proliferate.

=== Legacy ===
Nearly 300 years after the Tuscarora were defeated at Fort Neoheroka, the fort was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 2009. A monument was constructed and commemorated there in March 2013. The ceremony was attended by Tuscarora descendants, some from New York and others from North Carolina.

<doc id="1059872" wikidata="Q1200648" url="?curid=1059872" title="Genshiken">
<text>is a Japanese manga series by Shimoku Kio about a college club for &quot;otaku&quot; (extremely obsessed fans of various media) and their lifestyle. The title is a shortening of the club&#x27;s official name, , or &quot;The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture&quot;. The series has also been adapted into an anime directed by Tsutomu Mizushima. The manga originally ran in Kodansha&#x27;s magazine &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; from April 2002 to May 2006, and has been reprinted in nine bound volumes.

A two-part short bonus story was included across both volumes of the &quot;Kujibiki Unbalance&quot; manga, published in 2006.

In December 2009, a new chapter was released in &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; to celebrate the release of the &quot;Genshiken 2&quot; DVD box-set. In October 2010, the series resumed serialization as .

==Overview==

===Themes===

The series focuses on the &quot;otaku&quot; lifestyle and contains numerous references to other manga, anime, video games, and other aspects of &quot;otaku&quot; culture. Common plot points include such &quot;otaku&quot;-centric activities as the buying and creation of &quot;dōjinshi&quot;, fan-made manga usually of erotic content; convincing a character to try cosplay (dressing up as characters from manga, anime, or video games); the creation of plamo (plastic models that must be assembled); visiting Akihabara, Tokyo&#x27;s electronics shopping district; or attending the biannual Comic Festival (&quot;Comifes&quot;), a reference to Comic Market (&quot;Comiket&quot;), Japan&#x27;s single largest anime- and manga-focused fan convention.

Since the anime is co-produced by Sega Sammy Holdings, the &quot;Guilty Gear&quot; video game series is heavily referenced, with actual gameplay sequences being shown multiple times, Ohno cosplaying as Kuradoberi Jam, and other minor references. The Sega puzzle game &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; also serves as an important plot point as Kasukabe tries to gain Kousaka&#x27;s attention. Numerous other non-Sega/Sammy properties are also referenced throughout the anime, but their names are changed slightly, such as &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot; being alluded to as &quot;COF 95&quot; and &quot;Capcom vs SNK 2&quot; as &quot;S-Cup&quot;. Discussion of &quot;eroge&quot;, erotic video games usually of the visual novel genre, also occurs often.

Similar to the treatment of video games in the series, popular anime, and manga are often alluded to by pseudonyms, such as &quot;&quot;Gungal&quot; (&quot;Gundam&quot;), &quot;Reass Mood&quot; (&quot;Code Geass&quot;), &quot;Haregan&quot; (&quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;), &quot;Scram Dunk&quot; (&quot;Slam Dunk&quot;), &quot;Neko Yasha&quot;&quot; (&quot;InuYasha&quot;), and many others. &quot;Genshiken&quot; usually avoids referring to these series so in-depth that it would require the use of names and lines from their real-world counterparts, with several notable exceptions: in the model-building chapter of the manga (but not the anime), actual &quot;Gundam&quot; mecha and characters are referred to throughout, while the dialogue quoted by Sue (except for one &quot;Neko Yasha!&quot; outburst) is pulled directly from &quot;Evangelion&quot;, &quot;Lupin III&quot;, &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, and other series.

These cultural references have remained intact for the English adaption of the manga, which includes a section for translation notes. However, due to the number of allusions made and the inability of a translator to always know what is being referred to, many explanations of &quot;otaku&quot; references are still absent. The anime, however, has been criticized for having &quot;excessive script variances&quot; with its English dub translations, such as injecting English-specific references like &quot;talk to the hand&quot; and for inconsistently including liner notes.

Ramen Angel Pretty Menma

Another fictitious series created for the series is &quot;Ramen Angel Pretty Menma&quot;, a generic adult visual novel. Mentioned in passing as Sasahara&#x27;s first such game in the manga, it is given much greater emphasis in the second TV series. The plot revolves around Kaoru Torigara, the only son of a ramen shop owner, who is going to renovate his inherited ramen shop. He discovers that his shop has a guardian angel named Pretty Menma. Pretty Menma tells Kaoru that his dead father&#x27;s intention is making him succeed in the &quot;Food King Wars&quot;, a battle of restaurants around the world that is held every 4 years. Kaoru and Menma must help each other to go through the struggles of the &quot;Food King Wars&quot;. In the anime, there is also &quot;Ramen Angel Pretty Menma 2&quot;, which continues from the first version. Additionally, the third version of the opening sequence (that uses the same song, but adds scenes and edits existing ones) shows Ogiue cosplaying Pretty Menma, Ohno cosplaying Cutie Tonko (another heroine in this series who represents &quot;tonkotsu&quot;, a form of ramen broth), and Kasukabe cosplaying Menma&#x27;s mother. This series is also spun off into its own Internet radio show, manga (serialized in &quot;Monthly Comic Alive&quot;) and a drama CD.

===Plot===

&quot;Genshiken&quot; follows the lives of a group of college students drawn together by their shared hobbies, and the trials and adventures associated with being otaku. The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at Shiiou University, Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic club member, and for a time, a capable club president. As the story of &quot;Genshiken&quot; progresses, focus is also placed on Saki Kasukabe, a determined non-otaku who initially struggles to drag her boyfriend Kousaka out of the club, and Chika Ogiue, a self-professed otaku-hater who feels a deep-seated shame and self-loathing toward her own interests and hobbies.

During the course of the series, the reader bears witness as the group grows in its cohesiveness over time, and bonds form between the characters as they begin to see themselves as more than fellow club members, but friends as well. In this context, club activities such as group outings, the biannual pilgrimage to Comifes, and even simply hanging out in the club room, allow the characters&#x27; complex relationships to grow into friendship, infatuation, and at times, even love. While a few of them never quite see eye-to-eye about their interests or the lives they lead, they are held together by the bonds of friendship that they share.

====Second Generation====
After Sasahara, Kousaka and Kasukabe graduate, the series shifts focus to three new club members: The self-conscious Yajima, the energetic-yet-annoying Yoshitake, and Hato, a fudanshi who cross-dresses to fit in better and go unrecognized by his normal classmates. Emphasis is also put on the character of Madarame, a former president of the club who actually graduated a year before Sasahara, but remained in the club due to working and having an apartment nearby, hanging out in the club room in his time off as he struggles to grow up and move on from university.

==Media==
===Manga===
===Anime===
The manga was brought to television by the production company Genco through animation studio Palm in 2004 as a 12-episode anime and in 2006 and 2007 as 3-episode OVA, adapting the first five volumes of the manga. The TV series was licensed for North American release by Media Blasters.

The anime adaptation is very faithful to the original work, with few revisions being made, with the exception that many references to specific anime, manga, and video games are changed or removed. The previously fictional &quot;Kujibiki Unbalance&quot; manga series was also turned into an anime series to match the medium, with three complete episodes being created for sampling in the anime version of &quot;Genshiken&quot;. The three &quot;Kujibiki Unbalance&quot; episodes are provided as bonus OVAs with the purchase of the &quot;Genshiken&quot; DVDs.

It was originally announced by Media Factory at Comiket 69 that the second TV series of &quot;Genshiken&quot; would premiere in October 2006. However, Media Factory clarified their statement in May 2006, saying that the series airing in the fall would be a full-fledged &quot;Kujibiki Unbalance&quot; series, rather than a &quot;Genshiken&quot; sequel. Nevertheless, the DVD releases of the new &quot;Kujibiki Unbalance&quot; series each included an OVA episode of &quot;Genshiken&quot;, for a total of three new episodes. The first new episode was released with &quot;Kujibiki Unbalance&quot; DVD Box 1 on December 22, 2006, with the two subsequent installments following on February 23 and April 25, 2007, respectively.

On April 23, 2007, it was announced on the &quot;Genshiken&quot; homepage that a second anime television series would be produced, including the character Ogiue, who had been introduced in the OVA episodes. The first episode of the second series aired on October 11, 2007 on Japanese TV. A radio webcast ran simultaneously with the terrestrial broadcast. The final episode of the series aired on December 27, 2007; however, it did not conclude the story.

The TV version of &quot;Genshiken 2&quot; aired with minor censorship. The censorship was that of a highly erotic kiss that involved no nudity. Additional nudity like breast nipples and strong cleavage was also censored. The DVD version shows everything uncensored.

In the March issue of &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; it was announced that a new anime had been authorized for &quot;Genshiken: Second Season&quot;. The new anime sequel is directed by Tsutomu Mizushima at Production I.G, with Michiko Yokote handling the series composition. The series premiered on July 7, 2013 and includes the opening song &quot;Genshi, Joshi wa, Taiyo Datta&quot; by Sumire Uesaka and the band Kabuki Rocks. At Anime Expo 2013, NIS America announced their acquisition of &quot;Genshiken: Second Season&quot;, licensed under the title &quot;Genshiken: Second Generation&quot;, for release in North America.

A &quot;Genshiken: Second Generation&quot; OAD (Original Animation DVD) was bundled with the limited edition of the 15th volume of the &quot;Genshiken&quot; manga, released in Dec 20, 2013. The story is set between the events of the &quot;Genshiken 2&quot; and &quot;Genshiken: Second Generation&quot; series.

===Drama CD===
There has been three drama CD bundled together with different media in the series. The first one was released as a &quot;first press&quot; item for the 9th volume of the manga, while the two others were included in the two first volumes of the &quot;Genshiken 2&quot; DVDs.

List of releases:

* 1. Genshiken Dai 9 kan: Tokusōban Drama CD 
* 2. Dai 8.5 wa &#x27;Otaku Shigan... Mitai na?&#x27;
* 3. Bangai hen &#x27;Road to Ikebukuro (kari)&#x27;

===Light novel===
In 2008, Kodansha released the light novel &quot;Shoron Genshiken: Hairu Ranto no Yabou&quot;, with Del Rey releasing the book in June 2010. The book introduces the character of Ranto Hairu, the rich grandson of one of Japan&#x27;s most influential businessmen, as he takes over the student club organization with the intention of getting rid of any elements he views as unsavory. Meanwhile, a supernatural force is slowly abducting members of Genshiken without a trace.

Chronologically the book falls just after certain events in the second volume, although few of the book&#x27;s events follow the story elements already established in the series. Changes such as Kuchiki remaining with the Genshiken after his initial attempts to join, the established president of the student club organization drops out due to pregnancy, as well as Ohno and Tanaka&#x27;s relationship being more established than it was during this point in time. The light novel also introduces several characters that are only present in the novel itself and do not appear in the anime or manga. Also of note is that there are several elements present in the book (such as the supernatural) that are not present in the anime or manga.

==Reception==

&quot;Genshiken&quot; has been praised for its execution of the slice-of-life genre, in that it is able to be funny while still maintaining a strong sense of everyday life. Anime News Network reviewer Bamboo Dong&#x27;s review of the first manga volume called &quot;Genshiken&quot; &quot;one of the best manga series out this year&quot;, praising Shimoku Kio&#x27;s attention to detail and David Ury&#x27;s translation work. &quot;Genshiken&quot; was also selected as one of the Manga Division Jury Recommended Works in the 2005 Japan Media Arts Festival.

David Smith at &quot;IGN&quot; said &quot;If you haven&#x27;t seen &quot;Genshiken&quot;, you&#x27;re missing out on the definitive anime portrait of contemporary anime fandom.&quot; He also recommended fans of the series to check out &quot;Otaku no Video&quot; as well.

<doc id="1059877" wikidata="Q5378420" url="?curid=1059877" title="English auxiliary verbs">
<text>English auxiliary verbs are a small set of English verbs, which include the English modal auxiliary verbs and a few others. Although the auxiliary verbs of English are widely believed to lack inherent semantic meaning and instead to modify the meaning of the verbs they accompany, they are nowadays classed by linguists as auxiliary on the basis not of semantic but of grammatical properties: among these, that they invert with their subjects in interrogative main clauses (&quot;Has John arrived?&quot;) and are negated either by the simple addition of &quot;not&quot; (&quot;He has not arrived&quot;) or (with a very few exceptions) by negative inflection (&quot;He hasn&#x27;t arrived&quot;).
== History of the concept ==
When describing English, the adjective &quot;auxiliary&quot; was &quot;formerly applied to any formative or subordinate elements of language, e.g. prefixes, prepositions.&quot; As applied to verbs, its conception was originally rather vague and varied significantly.

=== Some historical examples ===
The first English grammar, &quot;Bref Grammar for English&quot; by William Bullokar, published in 1586, does not use the term &quot;auxiliary&quot; but says:

All other verbs are called verbs-neuters-un-perfect because they require the infinitive mood of another verb to express their signification of meaning perfectly: and be these, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;might&quot; or &quot;mought&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;would&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, &quot;must&quot;, &quot;ought&quot;, and sometimes, &quot;will&quot;, that being a mere sign of the future tense. [orthography standardized and modernized]

In volume 5 (1762) of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, the narrator&#x27;s father explains that &quot;The verbs auxiliary we are concerned in here, . . . , are, &quot;am&quot;; &quot;was&quot;; &quot;have&quot;; &quot;had&quot;; &quot;do&quot;; &quot;did&quot;; &quot;make&quot;; &quot;made&quot;; &quot;suffer&quot;; &quot;shall&quot;; &quot;should&quot;; &quot;will&quot;; &quot;would&quot;; &quot;can&quot;; &quot;could&quot;; &quot;owe&quot;; &quot;ought&quot;; &quot;used&quot;; or &quot;is wont&quot;.&quot;

Charles Wiseman&#x27;s &quot;Complete English Grammar&quot; of 1764 notes that most verbs

cannot be conjugated through all their Moods and Tenses, without one of the following principal Verbs &quot;have&quot; and &quot;be&quot;. The first serves to conjugate the rest, by supplying the compound tenses of all Verbs both Regular and Irregular, whether Active, Passive, Neuter, or Impersonal, as may be seen in its own variation, &amp;c.

Along with &quot;have&quot; and &quot;be&quot;, it goes on to include &quot;do&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;will&quot; as auxiliary verbs.

W. C. Fowler&#x27;s &quot;The English Language&quot; of 1857 says:

, or &quot;Helping Verbs&quot;, perform the same office in the conjugation of principal verbs which inflection does in the classical languages, though even in those languages the substantive verb is sometimes used as a helping verb. . . . I. The verbs that are &quot;always auxiliary&quot; to others are, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;must&quot;; II. Those that are &quot;sometimes auxiliary&quot; and sometimes principal verbs are, &quot;Will&quot;, &quot;have&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, and &quot;let&quot;.

The verbs that all the sources cited above agree are auxiliary verbs are the modal auxiliary verbs &quot;may&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, and &quot;shall&quot;; most also include &quot;be&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, and &quot;have&quot;.

=== Auxiliary verbs as heads ===
Modern grammars do not differ substantially over membership in the list of auxiliary verbs, though they have refined the concept and, following an idea first put forward by John Ross in 1969, have tended to take the auxiliary verb not as subordinate to a &quot;main verb&quot; (a concept that pedagogical grammars perpetuate), but instead as the head of a verb phrase. Examples include &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; and Bas Aarts&#x27; &quot;Oxford Modern English Grammar&quot;. This is shown in the tree diagram below for the clause &quot;I can swim&quot;.

The clause has a subject noun phrase &quot;I&quot; and a head verb phrase (VP), headed by the auxiliary verb &quot;can&quot;. The VP also has a complement clause, which has a head VP, with the head verb &quot;swim&quot;.

=== Recent definitions ===
&quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot; (1985) says of &quot;verbs in auxiliary function&quot; that &quot;In contrast to full [i.e. lexical] verbs, [these verbs] are capable of functioning as &quot;auxiliary&quot; or &#x27;helping&#x27; verbs (&quot;cf&quot; 2.27&quot;f&quot;)&quot;, which seems to refer back to a table showing the &quot;main verb&quot; (&quot;sink&quot; in various inflected forms) following one to four auxiliary verbs (&quot;be&quot; and &quot;have&quot;, again in various inflected forms; and &quot;may&quot; and &quot;must&quot;). It is not obvious how this definition would exclude lexical verbs such as &quot;try&quot; (in &quot;tried sinking&quot;, &quot;tried to have sunk&quot;, &quot;tried being sunk&quot;, etc) – although they would certainly fail the book&#x27;s own list of criteria for auxiliary verbs, as listed later.

In his book &quot;English Auxiliaries: History and Structure&quot; (1993), Anthony R. Warner writes that the English auxiliary verbs &quot;are rather sharply defined as a group by distinctive formal properties.&quot;

&quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; (2002) describes auxiliary verbs as &quot;a small list of verbs with very specific syntactic properties&quot;, differing from &quot;all the rest of the verbs in the dictionary, which we will call the lexical verbs . . . in inflectional morphology as well as syntax&quot; And later: &quot;A general definition of auxiliary verb is that it denotes a closed class of verbs that are characteristically used as markers of tense, aspect, mood, and voice.&quot; It too adds a list of criteria.

== Auxiliary verbs distinguished grammatically ==
The list of auxiliary verbs in Modern English, along with their inflected forms, is shown in the following table.

Contractions are only shown if their orthography is distinctive. There are also numerous unstressed versions that are typically, although not necessarily, written in the standard way. For these, see a later section. Where there is a blank, the auxiliary verb lacks this form. (In some cases, a corresponding lexical verb may have the form. For example, although lexical verb &quot;need&quot; has a plain past tense form, auxiliary verb &quot;need&quot; does not.)
A major difference between the results, shown above, of defining auxiliary verbs syntactically and doing so based on a notion of &quot;helping&quot; is that the syntactic definition includes:
*&quot;be&quot; even when used simply as a copular verb (&quot;I am hungry&quot;; &quot;It was a cat&quot;)
*idioms using &quot;would&quot; (&quot;would rather&quot;, &quot;would sooner&quot;, &quot;would as soon&quot;) that take a finite clause complement (&quot;I&#x27;d rather you went&quot;)
*&quot;have&quot; with no other verb (as in %&quot;Have you any change?&quot;): uses where it cannot be said to &quot;help&quot; any other verb.

=== Archaic forms of &quot;be&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, and &quot;have&quot; ===
A study of 17th-century American English found the form &quot;be&quot; used for the 1st and 3rd person plural present; &quot;was&quot; for the 3rd person plural preterite; &quot;art&quot; and &quot;are&quot; for the 2nd person singular present; &quot;wast&quot; and &quot;wert&quot; for the 2nd person singular preterite; and &quot;dost&quot; and &quot;hast&quot; (2nd person) and &quot;doth&quot; and &quot;hath&quot; (3rd person) for the singular present.

===The NICE criteria===
One set of criteria for distinguishing between auxiliary and lexical verbs is F. R. Palmer&#x27;s &quot;NICE&quot;: &quot;Basically the criteria are that the auxiliary verbs occur with negation, inversion, &#x27;code&#x27;, and emphatic affirmation while the [lexical] verbs do not.&quot;

====NICE: Negation====
Clausal negation most commonly employs an auxiliary verb, for example, &quot;We can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;ll rain today&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t need an umbrella&quot;. As late as Middle English, lexical verbs could also participate in clausal negation, so a clause like &quot;Lee eats not apples&quot; would have been grammatical, but this is no longer possible in Modern English, where lexical verbs require &quot;&quot;do&quot;support&quot;.

(At first glance, the grammaticality of &quot;I hope/guess/suppose/think not&quot; may suggest that some lexical verbs too have no need for &quot;do&quot;support; but ungrammatical *&quot;I hope/guess/suppose/think not you are right&quot; shows that this is quite mistaken. &quot;Not&quot; in these examples does not negate a clause but is instead the negative equivalent of &quot;so&quot;, a pro-form for a negative proposition.)

Palmer writes that the &quot;Negation&quot; criterion is &quot;whether [the verb] occurs with the negative particle &quot;not&quot;, or more strictly, whether it has a negative form&quot;, the latter referring to negatively inflected &quot;won&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;hasn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;haven&#x27;t&quot;, etc. (As seen in the paradigm table above, in today&#x27;s Standard English not every auxiliary verb has such a form.)

====NICE: Inversion====
Although English is a subject–verb–object language, an interrogative main clause is the most important among several constructions that put a verb before the subject. This is called subject–auxiliary inversion because only auxiliary verbs participate in such constructions: &quot;Can/should/must Lee eat apples?&quot;; &quot;Never have I enjoyed a quince&quot;. Again, in Middle English, lexical verbs were no different; but in Modern English *&quot;Eats Lee apples?&quot; and *&quot;Never enjoy I a quince&quot; are ungrammatical, and &quot;do&quot;support is again required: &quot;Does Lee eat apples?&quot;; &quot;Never do I enjoy quinces&quot;.

====NICE: Code====
F. R. Palmer attributes this term to J. R. Firth, writing:

There are sentences in English in which a full verb is later &#x27;picked up&#x27; by an auxiliary. The position is very similar to that of a noun being &#x27;picked up&#x27; by a pronoun. [. . .] If the initial sentence, which contains the main verb, is not heard, all the remainder is unintelligible; it is, in fact, truly in code. The following example is from Firth:
:&quot;Do you think he will?&quot;
:&quot;I don&#x27;t know. He might.&quot;
:&quot;I suppose he ought to, but perhaps he feels he can&#x27;t.&quot;
:&quot;Well, his brothers have. They perhaps think he needn&#x27;t.&quot;
:&quot;Perhaps eventually he may. I think he should, and I very much hope he will.&quot;

(What &quot;picks up&quot; is called an anaphor; what is picked up is called an antecedent.) Attempting to remove the complement(s) of a lexical verb normally has an ungrammatical result (&quot;Did you put it in the fridge?&quot; / *&quot;Yes, I put&quot;) or an inappropriate one (&quot;Did you eat the chicken?&quot; / #&quot;Yes, I ate&quot;). However, if a number of conditions are met, the result may be acceptable.

====NICE: Emphatic affirmation====
F. R. Palmer writes that &quot;a characteristic of the auxiliaries is their use in emphatic affirmation with nuclear stress upon the auxiliary&quot;, as in &quot;You must see him&quot;. He concedes that &quot;any verbal form may have nuclear stress&quot;; thus &quot;We saw them&quot;; however, auxiliaries stressed in this way are used for &quot;the denial of the negative&quot;, whereas lexical verbs again use &quot;do&quot;support.
* &quot;You say you heard them?&quot; / &quot;No, we them.&quot;
* &quot;You can&#x27;t have seen them.&quot; / &quot;We see them.&quot;

NICE is widely cited (with &quot;emphatic affirmation&quot; usually simplified as &quot;emphasis&quot;): as examples, by &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot; (1985), &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; (2002), and the &quot;Oxford Modern English Grammar&quot; (2011).

===The NICER criteria===
A revised set of criteria, NICER, owes much to NICE but does more than merely add a fifth criterion to it.

In this section, a number of verbs – not limited to those in the paradigm table above – are checked against four of the five criteria of NICER. As would, might, could and should are sometimes understood as discrete verbs (and not merely as the preterite forms of will, may, can and shall), they are tested too.

==== NICER: Negation ====
Auxiliary verbs can be negated with &quot;not&quot;; lexical verbs require &quot;do&quot;-support: a less stringent version of &quot;negation&quot; as the first criterion of NICE.

We add &quot;not&quot; immediately after the verb, and obtain: &quot;She will/would/may/might/can/could/shall/should/must/need/dare not live there.&quot; Each of these has clausal negation, as we see by adding a positive tag and thereby creating a straightforward question: &quot;She can not live there, can she?&quot;; &quot;She need not live there, need she?&quot;; and so forth. (Compare &quot;She can live there, can she?&quot; and &quot;She needs to live there, does she?&quot;. In both of these a positive tag is added to a positive clause, for a result that is not a straightforward question. Context and tone of voice may suggest that the speaker is impressed or incredulous.)

Similarly for &quot;She ought/used not to live there&quot;; &quot;She is not a resident&quot;; &quot;She does not live there&quot;; and &quot;She has not lived there&quot;; and indeed for &quot;She wants to not go&quot;, awkward though this may sound.

This criterion does not require the same verb for the tag as in the anchor (the part of the sentence that precedes the tag). So the informal &quot;better&quot; works as well: &quot;She better not be late, had she?&quot; Irrespective of any tag, lexical &quot;do&quot; does not work (*&quot;You did not your homework&quot;), and neither does &quot;go&quot; (*&quot;He goes not to school&quot;). Putting &quot;not&quot; immediately after some other lexical verbs brings a grammatical result (&quot;He seems/intends not to live there&quot;), but one that does not work as expected with a positive tag – &quot;He seems/intends not to live there, does he?&quot; do not straightforwardly ask – showing that what &quot;not&quot; has negated is not the clause as a whole.

==== NICER: Auxiliary-initial constructions ====
The same as &quot;inversion&quot; as the second criterion of NICE.

&quot;Will/would/may/might/can/could/shall/should/must/need/dare I wear a mankini?&quot; – all of these can invert with the subject.

Likewise for &quot;Ought/used/have you to wear a suit?&quot;; &quot;Am I forced to wear a suit?&quot;; and &quot;Do I wear a suit?&quot;

This again accounts for all of the verbs in the paradigm table above, other than &quot;to&quot;. The construction requires a tensed form of the verb; &quot;to&quot; lacks one, and therefore this criterion does not apply to it.

Attempts to invert lexical verbs such as &quot;do&quot; (*&quot;Did you your homework?&quot;) or &quot;go&quot; (*&quot;Goes he to school?&quot;) bring ungrammatical results. Surprisingly, &quot;How goes it?&quot; is grammatical; but even a minor adjustment to it (*&quot;How went it?&quot;; *&quot;How goes your job?&quot;) brings an ungrammatical result, showing that it is merely a fixed formula.

==== NICER: &quot;Contraction&quot; of &quot;not&quot; ====
Most English auxiliary verbs have a negative inflected form with &quot;-n&#x27;t&quot;, commonly regarded as a contracted form of &quot;not&quot;. Available are &quot;won&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;wouldn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;mightn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;shan&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;mustn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;oughtn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;needn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;wasn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;weren&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;daren&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;haven&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;hasn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;hadn&#x27;t&quot;, and %&quot;usedn&#x27;t&quot;. 

No lexical verb has such a form (*&quot;She gon&#x27;t to bars much these days&quot;; *&quot;She didn&#x27;t her homework last week&quot;). 

A small number of defective auxiliary verbs lack this inflection: %&quot;mayn&#x27;t&quot; and *&quot;daredn&#x27;t&quot; are now dated, and there is no universally accepted negative inflection of &quot;am&quot;: %&quot;amn&#x27;t&quot; is dialectal, the acceptability of &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; depends on the variety of Standard English, and &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot; is only used when it and &quot;I&quot; are inverted (&quot;Aren&#x27;t I invited?&quot;, compare *&quot;I aren&#x27;t tired&quot;). 

For &quot;do&quot;, &quot;must&quot;, &quot;used&quot; (), and (depending on the variety of Standard English) &quot;can&quot;, the negative inflected form is spelt as expected but its pronunciation is anomalous (change of vowel in &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; and perhaps &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;; elision of within the root of &quot;mustn&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;usedn&#x27;t&quot;); for &quot;shan&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;won&#x27;t&quot;, both the pronunciation and the spelling are anomalous.

==== NICER: Post-auxiliary ellipsis ====
The same as &quot;code&quot; as the third criterion of NICE.

The possibility of ellipsis with will, may, might, can&#x27;t, should, needn&#x27;t and have (and indeed to) is illustrated in Firth&#x27;s example of &quot;code&quot;.

As for the other auxiliary verbs:
*&quot;I&#x27;ll attend if I must/dare/%ought.&quot;
*&quot;If you&#x27;re attending then I shall/am.&quot;
*&quot;I&#x27;d be grateful if you would/could/did.&quot;
*&quot;I&#x27;ll go if you do.&quot;
*&quot;I haven&#x27;t swum much recently but I used/ought/want/hope to.&quot;

This is not possible with &quot;used&quot; (although it was in the past), or with most lexical verbs: *&quot;I haven&#x27;t swum much recently but I used/want/hope.&quot;

It does however work with a number of lexical verbs: &quot;I&#x27;d be grateful if you tried/started/stopped.&quot;

==== NICER: Rebuttal ====
When two people are arguing, one may use a stressed &quot;too&quot; or &quot;so&quot; immediately after the auxiliary verb to deny a statement made by the other. For example, having been told that he didn&#x27;t do his homework, a child may reply &quot;I did too&quot;. (Or anyway, this is true for US English. For British English, &quot;indeed&quot;.) This kind of rebuttal is impossible with lexical verbs.

=== Additional criteria ===
Each of the two most compendious of postwar reference grammars of English offers a more detailed list of criteria for auxiliary verbs.

&quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot; has eight criteria. The first five of these approximate to the four of NICE, with the addition of cliticization as in &quot;It&#x27;s raining&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;ve finished&quot;. Slightly simplified, the sixth is that auxiliary verbs, unlike lexical verbs, &quot;typically, but not necessarily&quot; precede adverbs such as &quot;always&quot;, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;certainly&quot; and &quot;probably&quot;: &quot;He would always visit her&quot; (compare lexical verb &quot;visit&quot; in *&quot;He visited always her&quot;). The seventh is that &quot;Quantifiers like &quot;all&quot;, &quot;both&quot;, and &quot;each&quot; which modify the subject of the clause may occur after the [verb] as an alternative, in many instances, to the predeterminer position&quot;; thus either &quot;Both their children will attend&quot; or &quot;Their children will both attend&quot; (compare lexical verb &quot;attend&quot; in *&quot;Their children attended both&quot;). The last is &quot;Independence of subject&quot;, a claim that, compared with most lexical verbs, auxiliary verbs can be semantically independent of their subjects. This in turn is claimed to be manifested in three ways. (The book provides four additional criteria for modal auxiliary verbs.)

&quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; adopts NICE and criteria approximating to the sixth and seventh of &quot;Comprehensive Grammar&quot;, although it dispenses with the eighth. (It provides five additional criteria for modal auxiliary verbs.)

=== Boundary fuzziness ===
Linguists who cite or propound clear grammatical criteria for auxiliary verbs then proceed to include among auxiliary verbs certain verbs that do not meet all these criteria. Having said that the English auxiliary verbs &quot;are rather sharply defined . . . by distinctive formal properties&quot;, Anthony R. Warner points out that a class:

normally has some internal differentiation whereby a &quot;nuclear&quot; or &quot;prototypical&quot; set of members shows more of the properties of the class than other less fully characterized members. A class may also not show sharply definable boundaries.

He claims that what are the prototypical auxiliary verbs are the modal auxiliary verbs (other than &quot;ought&quot;, &quot;need&quot;, and &quot;dare&quot;) and that:

the presence of [&quot;be&quot;, &quot;do&quot; and &quot;have&quot;] in the category [auxiliary verb] is justified from a semantic point of view not so much by their possession of prototypical properties as by the fact that they are even more remote [than are the modal auxiliary verbs] from the [lexical verb] prototype, which denotes an action or event. . . .

=== Infinitival &quot;to&quot; ===
Various linguists, notably Geoff Pullum, have suggested that the &quot;to&quot; of &quot;I want to go&quot; (not the preposition &quot;to&quot; as in &quot;I went to Rome&quot;) is a special case of an auxiliary verb with no tensed forms. Rodney Huddleston argues against this position in &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;, but Robert Levine counters these arguments. In a book on the historical emergence and spread of infinitival &quot;to&quot;, Bettelou Los calls Pullum&#x27;s arguments that it is an auxiliary verb &quot;compelling&quot;.

In terms of the NICER properties, examples like &quot;it&#x27;s fine not to go&quot; show that &quot;to&quot; allows negation. Inversion, contraction of &quot;not&quot;, and rebuttal would only apply to tensed forms, and &quot;to&quot; is argued to have none. Although rebuttal is not possible, it does allow ellipsis: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to&quot;.

===(&quot;Had&quot;) &quot;better&quot;, (&quot;woul&quot;)&quot;d rather&quot;, and others===
With their normal senses (as in &quot;You had better/best arrive early&quot;), &quot;had/d better&quot; and &quot;had/d best&quot; are not about the past. Indeed they do not seem to be usable for the past (*&quot;Yesterday I had better return home before the rain started&quot;); and they do not occur with other forms of &quot;have&quot; (*&quot;have/has better/best&quot;). &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language observes:

If we take [the &quot;had&quot; in &quot;had better&quot;] as a distinct lexeme, we will say that it has been reanalysed as a present tense form (like &quot;must&quot; and &quot;ought&quot;). . . . [In view of its syntactic behaviour], it undoubtedly should be included
among the non-central members of the modal auxiliary class.

Expressions ranging from &quot;had better&quot; to &quot;would rather&quot; have been argued to comprise &quot;a family of morphosyntactic configurations with a moderate degree of formal and semantic homogeneity&quot;. They would be:

*Superlative modals: &quot;had best&quot;, &quot;d best&quot;
*Comparative modals: &quot;had better&quot;, &quot;d better&quot;, &quot;better&quot;, &quot;would rather&quot;, &quot;d rather&quot;, &quot;had rather&quot;, &quot;should rather&quot;, &quot;would sooner&quot;, &quot;d sooner&quot;, &quot;had sooner&quot;, &quot;should sooner&quot;
*Equative modals: &quot;would (just) as soon as&quot;, &quot;may (just) as well&quot;, &quot;might (just) as well&quot;

Among these, &quot;had better&quot;, &quot;d better&quot;, &quot;better&quot; occur the most commonly. They express either advice or a strong hope: a deontic and an optative sense respectively.

Among these three forms, &quot;d better&quot; is the commonest in British English and plain &quot;better&quot; the commonest in American English. However, the syntactic category of plain &quot;better&quot; when used in this or a similar way is not always clear: while it may have been reanalysed as an independent modal auxiliary verb – one with no preterite form and also no ability to invert (*&quot;Better I leave now?&quot;) – it can be an adverb instead of a verb.

For more about &quot;would rather/sooner&quot; and &quot;would as soon&quot;, see &quot;Would rather&quot;, &quot;would sooner&quot;, and &quot;would as soon&quot;.

==Contributions by auxiliaries to meaning and syntax ==
An auxiliary verb is traditionally understood as a verb that &quot;helps&quot; another verb by adding (only) grammatical information to it. So understood, English auxiliaries include:
*&quot;Do&quot; when used to form questions (&quot;Do you want tea?&quot;), to negate (&quot;I don&#x27;t want coffee&quot;), or to emphasize (&quot;I do want tea&quot;) (see &quot;do&quot;-support)
*&quot;Have&quot; when used to express perfect aspect (&quot;He had given his all&quot;)
*&quot;Be&quot; when used to express progressive aspect (&quot;They were singing&quot;) or passive voice (&quot;It was destroyed&quot;)
*The modal auxiliary verbs, used with a variety of meanings, principally relating to modality (&quot;He can do it now&quot;)

However, this understanding of auxiliaries has trouble with &quot;be&quot; (&quot;He wasn&#x27;t asleep&quot;; &quot;Was he asleep?&quot;), &quot;have&quot; (%&quot;He hadn&#x27;t any money&quot;), and &quot;would&quot; (&quot;Would you rather we left now?&quot;), each of which behaves syntactically like an auxiliary verb even when not accompanying another verb (or not merely doing so). Other approaches to defining auxiliary verbs are described below.

=== &quot;Be&quot; ===
==== Passive voice ====
&quot;Be&quot;, followed by the past participle of a lexical verb, realizes the passive voice: &quot;He was promoted&quot;. Its negative and interrogative versions (&quot;He wasn&#x27;t promoted&quot;; &quot;Was he promoted?&quot;), lacking the need for &quot;do&quot;support, show that this is auxiliary &quot;be&quot;. (This simple test can be repeated for the other applications of &quot;be&quot; briefly described below.)

(However, the lexical verb &quot;get&quot; can also form a passive clause: &quot;He got promoted&quot;. This is a long-established construction.)

Followed by the present participle of a verb (whether lexical or auxiliary), &quot;be&quot; realizes the progressive aspect: &quot;He was promoting the film&quot;.

Either may be confused with the use of a participial adjective (that is, an adjective derived from and homonymous with a participle): &quot;He was excited&quot;; &quot;It was exciting&quot;.

==== Other uses ====
What &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; terms quasi-modal &quot;be&quot; normally imparts a deontic meaning: that of &quot;He is never to come here again&quot; approximates to that of &quot;He must never come here again&quot;. In conditional contexts, &quot;was to&quot; (if both informal and with a singular subject) or &quot;were to&quot; imparts remoteness: &quot;If I were to jump out of the plane, . . .&quot; (compare with the open conditional &quot;If I jumped out of the plane, . . .&quot;). In common with modal auxiliary verbs, quasi-modal &quot;be&quot; has no secondary form.

What the same work terms motional &quot;be&quot; only occurs as &quot;been&quot;, when it follows the verb &quot;have&quot; in a perfect construction and is not followed by any verb: &quot;I&#x27;ve twice been to Minsk&quot;. Most of the NICE/NICER criteria are inapplicable, but sentences such as &quot;I don&#x27;t need to go to the Grand People&#x27;s Study House as I&#x27;ve already been&quot; show that it satisfies the &quot;code&quot; and &quot;ellipsis&quot; criteria of NICE and NICER respectively and thus is auxiliary rather than lexical &quot;be&quot;.

What the &quot;Cambridge Grammar&quot; terms copular &quot;be&quot; links a subject, typically a noun phrase, and a predicative complement, typically a noun phrase, adjective phrase, or preposition phrase. Ascriptive copular &quot;be&quot; ascribes a property to the subject (&quot;The car was a wreck&quot;); specifying copular &quot;be&quot; identifies the subject (&quot;The woman in the green shoes is my aunt Louise&quot;) and can be reversed with a grammatical result (&quot;My aunt Louise is the woman in the green shoes&quot;). &quot;Be&quot; in an &quot;it&quot;cleft (&quot;It was my aunt Louise who wore the green shoes&quot;) is specifying.

Auxiliary &quot;be&quot; also takes as complements a variety of words (&quot;able&quot;, &quot;about&quot;, &quot;bound&quot;, &quot;going&quot; and &quot;supposed&quot; among them) that in turn take as complements &quot;to&quot;infinitival subordinate clauses for results that are highly idiomatic (&quot;was about/supposed to depart&quot;, etc).

In Early Modern English, perfect tenses could be formed with either &quot;have&quot; (as today) or &quot;be&quot;. The latter pattern persisted into the 19th century: a character in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; says, &quot;But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying&quot;.

=== &quot;Do&quot; ===
==== &quot;Do&quot;-support ====
The auxiliary verb &quot;do&quot; is primarily used for &quot;do&quot;support. This in turn is used for negation, interrogative main clauses, and more.

If a positive main clause is headed by an auxiliary verb, either the addition of &quot;not&quot; or (for most auxiliary verbs) a &quot;n&#x27;t&quot; inflection can negate. So &quot;They could reach home before dark&quot; becomes &quot;They couldn&#x27;t reach home before dark&quot;. (This is the &quot;negation&quot; of NICE and NICER.) However, a lexical verb has to be supported by the verb &quot;do&quot;; so &quot;They reached home before dark&quot; becomes &quot;They didn&#x27;t reach home before dark&quot;.

If a declarative main clause is headed by an auxiliary verb, simple inversion of subject and verb will create a closed interrogative clause. So &quot;They could reach home before dark&quot; becomes &quot;Could they reach home before dark?&quot;. (This is the &quot;inversion&quot; of NICE and NICER.) However, a lexical verb requires &quot;do&quot;; so &quot;They reached home before dark&quot; becomes &quot;Did they reach home before dark?&quot; For an open interrogative clause, &quot;do&quot; has the same role: &quot;How far did you get?&quot;

Although interrogative main clauses are by far the most obvious contexts for inversion using &quot;do&quot;support, there are others: While exclamative clauses usually lack subject–auxiliary inversion (&quot;What a foolish girl I was&quot;), it is a possibility (&quot;What a foolish girl was I&quot;); the inverted alternative to &quot;How wonderful it tasted!&quot; would be &quot;How wonderful did it taste!&quot; A negative constituent that is not the subject can move to the front and trigger such inversion: &quot;None of the bottles did they leave unopened.&quot; A phrase with &quot;only&quot; can do the same: &quot;Only once did I win a medal&quot;. Ditto for phrases starting with &quot;so&quot; and &quot;such&quot;: &quot;So hard/Such a beating did Douglas give Tyson that Tyson lost&quot;. And in somewhat old-fashioned or formal writing, a miscellany of other constituents can be moved to the front with the same effect: &quot;Well do I remember, not so much the whipping, as the being shut up in a dark closet behind the study&quot;;&quot;for years and years did they believe that France was on the brink of ruin&quot;.

Negative imperative sentences require auxiliary &quot;do&quot;, even when there is another auxiliary verb. The declarative sentence &quot;They were goofing off&quot; is grammatical with the single auxiliary &quot;be&quot;; but the imperative sentence &quot;Don&#x27;t be goofing off when the principal walks in&quot; adds &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;. (Optionally, &quot;you&quot; may be added in front of or immediately after &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;. A longer subject would normally come after: &quot;Don&#x27;t any of you be goofing off. . . .&quot;)

==== Emphatic polarity ====
Other than via a negative inflection (&quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot;), the verb &quot;do&quot; does not typically contribute any change in meaning, except when used to add emphasis to an accompanying verb. This is described as an emphatic construction, as an emphatic version of the declarative clause, as having emphatic polarity, or is called the emphatic mood: An example would be (i) &quot;I run five kilometres every morning&quot; (with intonational stress placed on &quot;do&quot;), compared to plain (ii) &quot;I run five kilometres every morning&quot;. It also differs from (iii) &quot;I five kilometres every morning&quot; (with the stress on &quot;run&quot;): A context for (i), with its &quot;emphasis on positive polarity&quot;, would be an allegation that the speaker didn&#x27;t do so every morning; for (iii), with its &quot;emphasis on lexical content&quot;, an allegation that the speaker merely walked. &quot;Do&quot; can be used for emphasis on negative polarity as well: &quot;He never remember my birthday&quot;.

For emphatic positive polarity in imperatives, &quot;do&quot; is again added; thus standard &quot;Be quiet&quot; becomes emphatically positive &quot;Do be quiet&quot;.

=== &quot;Have&quot; ===
==== Perfect tenses ====
Followed by the past participle of a verb (whether lexical or auxiliary), the auxiliary verb &quot;have&quot; realizes a perfect tense: &quot;Has she visited Qom?&quot;; &quot;Has she been to Qom?&quot;. In addition to its tensed forms (&quot;have&quot;/&quot;ve&quot;, &quot;has&quot;/&quot;s&quot;, &quot;had&quot;/&quot;d&quot;, &quot;haven&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;hasn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;hadn&#x27;t&quot;), it has a plain form (&quot;She could have arrived&quot;) and a present participle (&quot;I regret having lost it&quot;), but no past participle.

(&quot;Perfect&quot; is a syntactic term; in the context of English, &quot;perfective&quot; is a matter of semantic interpretation. Unlike, say, Slavic languages, which do have direct grammatical expression of perfectivity, in English, a sentence using a perfect tense may or may not have a perfective interpretation.)

The present perfect tense is illustrated by &quot;I&#x27;ve left it somewhere&quot;; the past perfect (also called the preterite perfect) tense by &quot;I&#x27;d left it somewhere&quot;. A full description of their uses is necessarily complex: the discussion in &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; is long and intricate.

The perfect is often considered as referring to an indefinite past: &quot;I&#x27;ve been to Oslo&quot; might raise the question of when, but is acceptable as is; by contrast, #&quot;I&#x27;ve been to Oslo in 2016&quot;, specifying the time, would be strange. A more careful analysis brings the continuative perfect, the experiential (or existential) perfect, the resultative perfect, and the perfect of recent past. The first, with an unspecified starting point and continuing uninterruptedly to the present, is illustrated by &quot;I&#x27;ve lived in Oslo since 2016&quot;; the experiential by &quot;Yes, I&#x27;ve watched a bullfight, and I never want to watch one again&quot;; the perfect of result by &quot;I&#x27;ve just watched a bullfight, and now I feel rather sick&quot;; and that of recent past by &quot;George Santos has just given a press conference&quot; (usable at the time of writing, but likely to become odder as time passes).

Very simply, the present perfect refers to the past in a way that has some relevance to the present. The perfect is also used in contexts that require both past reference and an untensed verb form (&quot;He seems to have left&quot;; &quot;Having left, he lit a cigarette&quot;).

Corpus-based research has shown that American English saw a marked decrease from around 1800 until the mid-20th century in the use of the present perfect, and that British English followed this in the late 20th century.

==== Other uses ====
When used to describe an event, &quot;have&quot; is exclusively a lexical verb (*&quot;Had you your teeth done?&quot;; &quot;Did you have your teeth done?&quot;; *&quot;Had you a nap?&quot;; &quot;Did you have a nap?&quot;). When used to describe a state, however, for many speakers (although for few Americans or younger people) there is also an auxiliary option: (&quot;he&#x27;d stop at a pub, settle up with a cheque because he hadn&#x27;t any money on him&quot;; &quot;Hasn&#x27;t he any friends of his own?&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I haven&#x27;t anything pithy to answer&quot;; &quot;This hasn&#x27;t anything directly to do with religion&quot;). An alternative to auxiliary verb &quot;have&quot; in this sense is &quot;have got&quot;, although this is commoner among British speakers, and less formal (&quot;Has he got old news for you&quot;; &quot;It hasn’t got anything to do with the little green men and the blue orb&quot;; &quot;What right had he got to get on this train without a ticket?&quot;; &quot;Hasn&#x27;t he got a toolbox?&quot;).

With their meaning of obligation, &quot;have to&quot;, &quot;has to&quot; and &quot;had to&quot; – rarely if ever rendered as &quot;ve to&quot;, &quot;s to&quot; and &quot;d to&quot; – can use auxiliary &quot;have&quot; for inversion (&quot;if he wants to compel A. to do something to what Court has he to go?&quot;; &quot;How much further has he to go?&quot;; &quot;Now why has he to wait three weeks?&quot;), although lexical &quot;have&quot; is commoner.

=== &quot;Use&quot; ===
Use (rhyming with &quot;loose&quot;) satisfies only one of &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;s five criteria for modal as distinct from other auxiliary verbs. &quot;It is also semantically quite distinct from the modal auxiliaries: the meaning it expresses is aspectual, not modal.&quot;

Like &quot;ought&quot;, &quot;use&quot; is followed by a &quot;to&quot;-infinitival clause. Thus &quot;I used to go to college&quot; means that formerly the speaker habitually went to college, and normally implies that they no longer do so. &quot;Use&quot; is highly defective, existing only in preterite form. For some speakers of English as a first language (though very few Americans), it can follow auxiliary-verb syntax: some speakers of British English can form questions like Used he to come here?&quot; and negatives like &quot;He used not (rarely usedn&#x27;t) &quot;to come here&quot;. Far commoner, however, is treatment of &quot;used&quot; as the preterite of a lexical verb.

Whether auxiliary or lexical, &quot;used&quot; expresses past states or past habitual actions, usually with the implication that they no longer continue. After noting how constructions employing &quot;used&quot; (&quot;We used to play tennis every week&quot;), &quot;would&quot; (&quot;We would play tennis every week&quot;), and the preterite alone (&quot;We played tennis every week&quot;) often seem to be interchangeable, Robert I. Binnick teases them apart, concluding that &quot;used&quot; is an &quot;&quot;anti&quot;-present-perfect&quot;: whereas the present perfect &quot;&quot;includes&quot; the present in what is essentially a period of the past&quot;, the &quot;used&quot; construction &quot;precisely &quot;excludes&quot; [it]&quot;; and further that

The whole point of the &quot;used to&quot; construction is not to report a habit in the past but rather to contrast a past era with the present. . . . It&#x27;s . . . essentially a present tense. . . . Like the present perfect, it is about a state of affairs, not a series of occurrences.

&quot;Use&quot; is far more commonly encountered as a lexical than as an auxiliary verb, particularly for younger or American speakers. This forms questions and negatives with &quot;did&quot;. The plain form &quot;use&quot; (sometimes spelt ) of the lexical verb is seen in &quot;Did you use to play tennis?&quot;). Its preterite perfect &quot;had used&quot; is rare but attested. A simple declarative (&quot;I often used to play tennis&quot;) could be either auxiliary or lexical. 

Use of the preterite &quot;used&quot; should not be confused with that of the participial adjective (i.e. the adjective etymologically derived from the participle), meaning &quot;familiar with&quot;, as in &quot;I am used to this&quot;, &quot;We must get used to the cold&quot;. (As is common for adjectives and impossible for verbs, &quot;used&quot; here can be modified by &quot;very&quot;.) When the participial adjective is followed by &quot;to&quot; and a verb, the latter is a gerund-participle: &quot;I am used to going to college in the mornings&quot;.

Data from a corpus of American and British spoken and written English of the 1980s and 1990s show that &quot;used not to&quot;, &quot;usedn&#x27;t to&quot; (both auxiliary), and &quot;didn&#x27;t use to&quot; (lexical) were then rare in both American and British English, other than &quot;used not to&quot; in British novels. &quot;Never used to&quot; is a commonly used alternative. Modal auxiliary &quot;use&quot; is not used in interrogatives in conversation (&quot;Used you to . . . ?&quot;); and even the lexical version with &quot;do&quot;-support (&quot;Did you use to . . . ?&quot;) is rare.

=== &quot;To&quot; ===
In the context for an argument that infinitival &quot;to&quot; is a subordinator, Rodney Huddleston points out that, just as for the subordinator &quot;that&quot; (&quot;I said (that) he could&quot;), there are contexts where &quot;to&quot; is optional, with no change in meaning. His example is &quot;All I did was (to) ask a question&quot;; and from it he infers that &quot;to&quot; is meaningless.

Within an argument for categorizing &quot;to&quot; not as a subordinator but as an auxiliary verb, Robert D. Levine disagrees with the main thrust of Huddleston&#x27;s argument, but not with the claim that &quot;to&quot; is meaningless – something that is also true of &quot;dummy &quot;do&quot;&quot; and copular &quot;be&quot;, both of them auxiliary verbs. Its function is purely syntactic.

=== Modal auxiliary verbs ===
The modal auxiliary verbs contribute meaning chiefly via modality, although some of them (particularly &quot;will&quot; and sometimes &quot;shall&quot;) express future time reference. Their uses are detailed at English modal verbs, and tables summarizing their principal meaning contributions can be found in the articles Modal verb and Auxiliary verb.

For more details on the uses of auxiliaries to express aspect, mood and time reference, see English clause syntax.
== Auxiliary verbs in sequence ==

=== Modal auxiliary verbs in sequence ===
As modal verbs only have tensed forms in Standard English, they would not be expected to appear in subordinate clauses, or in sequence (&quot;might be able to help them&quot;, but *&quot;might could help them&quot;). Yet what appear to be sequences of modal auxiliary verbs do occur: see &quot;Double modals&quot;. 

They can hardly be regarded as part of Standard English, and they are therefore ignored in the description below.

=== Other auxiliary verbs in sequence ===
There are constraints on the order within sequences of auxiliary verbs. As the modal auxiliary verbs and &quot;use&quot; only have tensed forms (or anyway only have these in Standard English), they can only go at the front. If we put aside the highly anomalous &quot;to&quot;, the order is then modal &gt; perfect &quot;have&quot; &gt; progressive &quot;be&quot; &gt; passive &quot;be&quot;, and a lexical verb.

Patterns with two auxiliary verbs are exemplified by &quot;was being eaten&quot;, &quot;has been eaten&quot;, &quot;might be eaten&quot;, and &quot;might have eaten&quot;. Patterns with three include that exemplified by &quot;might have been eaten&quot;. Noting that &quot;Structures containing two secondary forms of be (progressive and passive) [. . .] are avoided by some speakers, but they do occasionally occur&quot;, Huddleston and Pullum present &quot;will have been being taken&quot; as an example of a sequence with four.

==Unstressed and contracted forms==

Contractions are a common feature of English, used frequently in ordinary speech. In written English, contractions are used in informal and sometimes in formal writing. They usually involve the elision of a vowel – an apostrophe being inserted in its place in written English – possibly accompanied by other changes. Many of these contractions involve auxiliary verbs.

Certain contractions tend to be restricted to less formal speech and very informal writing, such as &quot;John&#x27;d&quot; or &quot;Mary&#x27;d&quot; for &quot;John/Mary would&quot;. (Compare the personal pronoun forms &quot;I&#x27;d&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;d&quot;, much more likely to be encountered in relatively informal writing.) This applies in particular to constructions involving consecutive contractions, such as &quot;wouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve&quot; for &quot;would not have&quot;.

Contractions in English are generally not mandatory, as they are in some other languages, although in speech uncontracted forms may seem overly formal. They are often used for emphasis: &quot;I ready!&quot; The uncontracted form of an auxiliary or copula must be used in elliptical sentences where its complement is omitted: &quot;Who&#x27;s ready? / I am!&quot; (not *&quot;I&#x27;m!&quot;).

Some contractions lead to homophony, which sometimes causes errors in writing, such as confusing &quot;&#x27;ve&quot; with &quot;of&quot;, as in &quot;&quot; for &quot;would have&quot;.

=== Unstressed and contracted forms of individual verbs ===
The lists below derive from F. R. Palmer&#x27;s &quot;The English Verb&quot; and &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;.

For the contracted forms of the modal auxiliary verbs, see English modal auxiliary verbs.

==== Unstressed and contracted forms of &quot;be&quot; ====
*&quot;am&quot; → , (&quot;m&quot;)
*&quot;is&quot; → or (&quot;s&quot;)
*&quot;are&quot; → , (&quot;re&quot;)
*&quot;was&quot; → 
*&quot;were&quot; → (&quot;re&quot;)
*&quot;be&quot; → 
*&quot;been&quot; → 

In a non-rhotic dialect, clitic-final is only realized as (or similar) when followed by a vowel (&quot;They&#x27;re tired&quot;, no ; &quot;They&#x27;re angry&quot;, with ).

For the contraction options for &quot;is&quot;, consider &quot;Bill&#x27;s arriving&quot; versus &quot;Janet&#x27;s coming&quot; .

==== Unstressed and contracted forms of &quot;do&quot; ====
* &quot;does&quot; → , or (&quot;s&quot;)
* &quot;do&quot; → , (&quot;d&quot; or &quot;d&quot;)

For the alternative nonsyllabic options for &quot;does&quot;, consider &quot;When&#x27;s Bill leave?&quot; versus &quot;What&#x27;s Bill do?&quot; .

The form &quot;d&quot; might appear in for example &quot;What&#x27;d he do?&quot;, spoken informally.

Uniquely among the forms for any of the auxiliary verbs, &quot;d&quot; is a proclitic. It attaches to the front of the single word &quot;you&quot; (&quot;Dyou follow me?&quot;).

==== Unstressed and contracted forms of &quot;have&quot; ====
* &quot;have&quot; → , , (&quot;ve&quot;), (&quot;woulda&quot;, &quot;musta&quot;, etc)
* &quot;has&quot; → , , or (&quot;s&quot;)
* &quot;had&quot; → , , (&quot;d&quot;)

For the alternative nonsyllabic options for &quot;has&quot;, consider &quot;Bill&#x27;s arrived&quot; versus &quot;Janet&#x27;s come&quot; .

==== Unstressed form of &quot;to&quot; ====
* &quot;to&quot; → 

=== Double contractions ===
Being clitics, the contractions can replace their full equivalents in most (although not all) contexts: thus we see &quot;ve&quot; not only in &quot;They&#x27;ve left&quot; but also in &quot;My friends&#x27;ve left&quot; (or even in &quot;My friends I hadn&#x27;t seen in three years&#x27;ve left&quot;); not only in &quot;You should&#x27;ve been there&quot; but also in &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve been there&quot;, in which a contraction has clitized onto an auxiliary verb with negative inflection.

Double contractions are possible. &quot;Will have broken&quot; is grammatical, and thus &quot;His arm/helmet/glasses/rib/collarbone/nose [etc] &#x27;ll&#x27;ve broken&quot; are all grammatical too.

== Negative inflected forms ==

Contractions such as &quot;d&quot; (from &quot;would&quot;) are clitics. By contrast, the &quot;n&#x27;t&quot; of &quot;wouldn&#x27;t&quot; is in reality a &quot;contraction&quot; only etymologically: &quot;wouldn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;haven&#x27;t&quot; and so forth have long been inflected forms, and an auxiliary verb with negative inflection can behave differently from the combination of &quot;not&quot; and the same verb without the inflection:

This article will continue to use &quot;contraction&quot; to include early instances of what at the time may not have become inflected forms.

During the early 17th century, &quot;not&quot; lost its requirement for stress, and subsequently came to be written as &quot;n&#x27;t&quot;, particularly in comedies and in the mouths of rustic characters or others speaking nonstandard dialects. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of &quot;n&#x27;t&quot; in writing spread beyond drama and fiction to personal letters, journalism, and descriptive texts. &quot;An&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;ben&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;han&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;shan&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;won&#x27;t&quot; were well established by the end of the 17th century; &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;wasn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;weren&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;hadn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;hasn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;haven&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;daren&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;mayn&#x27;t&quot; (now obsolete or dialectal), &quot;mightn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;mustn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;needn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;shan&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;won&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;wouldn&#x27;t&quot; by the end of the 18th; and &quot;oughtn&#x27;t&quot; in the early 19th.

There were various other negative contractions that have not survived: as examples, Barron Brainerd cites A. C. Partridge as showing that from 1599 to 1632 Ben Jonson used &quot;i&#x27;not&quot; (&quot;is not&quot;), &quot;sha&#x27;not&quot; (&quot;shall not&quot;), &quot;wi&#x27;not&quot; (&quot;will not&quot;), &quot;wu&#x27;not&quot; and &quot;wou&#x27;not&quot; (&quot;would not&quot;), &quot;ha&#x27;not&quot; (&quot;has/have not&quot;), and &quot;do&#x27;not&quot; (&quot;do not&quot;).

===Negative inflection of &quot;am&quot;===
Standard English has no first-person singular form corresponding to the &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot; of &quot;it isn&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;isn&#x27;t it?&quot; that is completely unproblematic. However, the following informal or dialectal options have been used:

==== &quot;Amn&#x27;t&quot; ====
Otto Jespersen calls &quot;amn&#x27;t&quot; &quot;unpronounceable&quot; and Eric Partridge calls it &quot;ugly&quot;, but it is the standard inflected form in some varieties, mainly Hiberno-English (Irish English) and Scottish English. In Hiberno-English the question form (&quot;amn&#x27;t I?&quot;) is used more frequently than the declarative &quot;I amn&#x27;t&quot;. (The standard &quot;I&#x27;m not&quot; is available as an alternative to &quot;I amn&#x27;t&quot; in both Scottish English and Hiberno-English.) An example appears in a poem by Oliver St. John Gogarty: &quot;If anyone thinks that I amn&#x27;t divine, / He gets no free drinks when I&#x27;m making the wine&quot;. These lines are quoted in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which also contains other examples: &quot;Amn&#x27;t I with you? Amn&#x27;t I your girl?&quot; (spoken by Cissy Caffrey).

==== &quot;Amnae&quot; ====
&quot;Amnae&quot; exists in Scots, and has been borrowed into Scottish English by many speakers. It is used in declarative sentences rather than questions.

==== &quot;Ain&#x27;t&quot; ====

&quot;Ain&#x27;t&quot; is an inflected alternative to &quot;am not&quot; – and also to &quot;is not&quot;, &quot;was not&quot;, &quot;are not&quot;, &quot;were not&quot;, &quot;has not&quot;, and &quot;have not&quot;; and in some dialects also &quot;do not&quot;, &quot;does not&quot;, &quot;did not&quot;, &quot;cannot&quot; (or &quot;can not&quot;), &quot;could not&quot;, &quot;will not&quot;, &quot;would not&quot; and &quot;should not&quot;. The usage of &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; is a perennial subject of controversy in English. Geoffrey Nunberg has argued that &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; is used by Standard English speakers &quot;to suggest that a fact is just obvious on the face of things&quot;.

==== &quot;Aren&#x27;t&quot; ====
&quot;Aren&#x27;t&quot; is a very common means of filling the &quot;&quot;amn&#x27;t&quot; gap&quot; in questions: &quot;Aren&#x27;t I lucky to have you around?&quot; It was common by the early 20th century: Otto Jespersen writing in a book published in 1917 that:

Nowadays [] is frequently heard, especially in tag-questions: I&#x27;m a bad boy [], but when authors want to write it, they are naturally induced to write &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot;. . . . I find the spelling &quot;aren&#x27;t I&quot; or &quot;arn&#x27;t I&quot; pretty frequently in George Eliot . . . but only to represent vulgar or dialectal speech. In the younger generation of writers, however, it is also found as belonging to educated speakers. . . .

The style guides have disagreed on &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot;: Eric Partridge considered the &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot; in &quot;aren&#x27;t I&quot; an &quot;illogical and illiterate&quot; spelling of &quot;the phonetically natural and the philologically logical&quot; &quot;a&#x27;n&#x27;t&quot;; H. W. Fowler (as revised by Ernest Gowers) wrote that &quot;aren&#x27;t I?&quot; was &quot;colloquially respectable and almost universal&quot;. In 1979, however, it was described as &quot;almost universal&quot; among speakers of Standard English. As an alternative to &quot;am not&quot;, &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot; developed from one pronunciation of &quot;an&#x27;t&quot; (which itself developed in part from &quot;amn&#x27;t&quot;). In non-rhotic dialects, &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;an&#x27;t&quot; are homophones, and the spelling began to replace in the early 20th century, although examples of (or ) for &quot;am I not&quot; appear in the first half of the 19th century, as in &quot;arn&#x27;t I listening; and isn&#x27;t it only the breeze that&#x27;s blowing the sheets and halliards about?&quot; from 1827.

==== &quot;An&#x27;t&quot; ====
&quot;An&#x27;t&quot; (sometimes &quot;a&#x27;n&#x27;t&quot;) arose from &quot;am not&quot; (via &quot;amn&#x27;t&quot;) and &quot;are not&quot; almost simultaneously. &quot;An&#x27;t&quot; first appears in print in the work of English Restoration playwrights. In 1695 &quot;an&#x27;t&quot; was used for &quot;am not&quot;, and as early as 1696 &quot;an&#x27;t&quot; was used to mean &quot;are not&quot;. &quot;An&#x27;t&quot; for &quot;is not&quot; may have developed independently from its use for &quot;am not&quot; and &quot;are not&quot;. &quot;Isn&#x27;t&quot; was sometimes written as &quot;in&#x27;t&quot; or &quot;en&#x27;t&quot;, which could have changed into &quot;an&#x27;t&quot;. &quot;An&#x27;t&quot; for &quot;is not&quot; may also have filled a gap in the paradigm for the verb &quot;be&quot;. From 1749, &quot;an&#x27;t&quot; with a long &quot;a&quot; sound began to be written as &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot;. By this time, &quot;an&#x27;t&quot; was already being used for &quot;am not&quot;, &quot;are not&quot;, and &quot;is not&quot;. &quot;An&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; coexisted as written forms well into the 19th century.

==== &quot;Bain&#x27;t&quot; ====
&quot;Bain&#x27;t&quot;, apparently from &quot;be not&quot;, is found in a number of works employing eye dialect, including J. Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Silas&quot;. It is also found in a ballad written in Newfoundland dialect.

===Other negative inflections of &quot;have&quot;===
&quot;Han&#x27;t&quot; or &quot;ha&#x27;n&#x27;t&quot;, an early contraction for &quot;has not&quot; and &quot;have not&quot;, developed from the elision of the &quot;s&quot; of &quot;has not&quot; and the &quot;v&quot; of &quot;have not&quot;. &quot;Han&#x27;t&quot; also appeared in the work of English Restoration playwrights. Much like &quot;an&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;han&#x27;t&quot; was sometimes pronounced with a long &quot;a&quot;, yielding &quot;hain&#x27;t&quot;. With H-dropping, the &quot;h&quot; of &quot;han&#x27;t&quot; or &quot;hain&#x27;t&quot; gradually disappeared in most dialects, and became &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot;. &quot;Ain&#x27;t&quot; as a contraction for &quot;has not&quot;/&quot;have not&quot; appeared in print as early as 1819. As with &quot;an&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;hain&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; were found together late into the nineteenth century.

&quot;Hain&#x27;t&quot;, in addition to being an antecedent of &quot;ain’t&quot;, is a contraction of &quot;has not&quot; and &quot;have not&quot; in some dialects of English, such as Appalachian English. It is reminiscent of &quot;hae&quot; (&quot;have&quot;) in Lowland Scots. In dialects that retain the distinction between &quot;hain&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;hain&#x27;t&quot; is used for contractions of &quot;to have not&quot; and &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; for contractions of &quot;to be not&quot;. In other dialects, &quot;hain&#x27;t&quot; is used either in place of, or interchangeably with &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot;. &quot;Hain&#x27;t&quot; is seen for example in Chapter 33 of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;: &quot;I hain&#x27;t come back—I hain&#x27;t been .&quot;

===Other negative inflections of &quot;do&quot;===
&quot;Don&#x27;t&quot; is the Standard English negative inflected form of &quot;do&quot;. However, in nonstandard English it may also be used for third person singular: &quot;Emma? She don&#x27;t live here anymore.&quot;

<text>Metalium is a power metal band from Hamburg, Germany, who released eight albums from 1999 to 2011 before disbanding. The band was reactivated in 2023 by founding members Henning Basse and Matthias Lange. Their style of music is that of the traditional power metal sound which was pioneered by bands such as Helloween and Blind Guardian.

==History==
The band was formed by bassist Lars Ratz (ex-Viva, Zed Yago, Velvet Viper), vocalist Henning Basse (ex- Burgeon Street, Brainstorm) and newcomer guitarist Matthias Lange. The German musicians got acquainted with drummer Mike Terrana and Savatage guitarist Chris Caffery through Ratz&#x27;s own management company during a European tour of the two Americans. The five musicians worked together on a single concept album project with a science fiction/fantasy storyline and speed metal style, to be released before the new millennium. The story is about Michael, a metal fan, who drinks a magic potion and becomes the invincible warrior Metalian. The debut Metalium album &quot;Millennium Metal – Chapter One&quot; was released in 1999 and was a success in Germany, peaking at No. 75 in the German chart and receiving positive reviews. The success of the first album ensured the continuation of the band&#x27;s career, as well as new adventures for the Metalian, the main character of Metalium&#x27;s ongoing saga. Jack Frost and Mark Cross replaced Caffery and Terrana respectively for the second album &quot;State of Triumph – Chapter Two&quot;, released in 2000. Both Frost and Cross had left the band by the end of 2001, leaving Lange as the only guitarist for studio recordings and introducing Michael Ehré on drums in time for Metalium&#x27;s third album of 2002. Still in 2001, the band released a DVD/Video titled &quot;Metalian Attack&quot; which included a 7-track live-CD and a full Metalium concept comic book by artist Markus Mayer. In the following years the band went on tour in Europe, Russia and South America, granting its presence at many important festivals. Metalium released another six albums until 2009 and a second live DVD called &quot;Metalian Attack pt. 2&quot; in 2006.

On 13 September 2010, the band announced on its website that it would dissolve in 2011.

On 18 April 2021, Lars Ratz died in a plane crash in Vilafranca de Bonany, Spain. He was 53 years old.

On August 31 2021, the surviving members of the band released a single in memory of founder Lars Ratz which also featured Grave Digger bassist Jens Becker and Deep Purple&#x27;s Don Airey on keyboards. After speculation the band would be fully reactivated, Henning Basse announced that he, Matthias Lange, and new guitarist Bruno Nunes would return as Metalium in 2023. Shortly after that, the band announced that bassist Fabio Carito and drummer Marcus Dotta completed the line-up.

<doc id="1059896" wikidata="Q2406293" url="?curid=1059896" title="The Conscience of the King">
<text>&quot;The Conscience of the King&quot; is the 13th episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Barry Trivers and directed by Gerd Oswald, it first aired on December 8, 1966.

The series, which was later subtitled &quot;The Original Series&quot;, follows the adventures of the starship and its crew led by Captain James T. Kirk (portrayed by William Shatner) through the galaxy. The episode is a murder mystery where, after Kirk is alerted that a theater actor (Arnold Moss) might in fact be a mass-murdering dictator, and investigates as disturbing events unfold.

The episode takes its title from the concluding lines of Act II of &quot;Hamlet:&quot; &quot;The play&#x27;s the thing/Wherein I&#x27;ll catch the conscience of the king.&quot; The play is performed in-universe in the episode.

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; is called to Planet Q by Dr. Thomas Leighton, a friend of Captain Kirk&#x27;s, ostensibly to investigate a possible new synthetic food source. Leighton&#x27;s true motivation, however, is his suspicion that Anton Karidian, the leader of a Shakespearean acting troupe currently on the planet performing &quot;Macbeth&quot;, is in fact Kodos the Executioner, former governor of the Earth colony of Tarsus IV. Kodos had ordered, by invoking martial law, that half the population be put to death due to the food shortage provoked by a fungal disease that had devastated the colony&#x27;s crops. It was believed at the time that the population would not survive, as it was, until the arrival of relief supplies. Four thousand individuals were selected for execution according to the eugenics beliefs of Kodos. Sadly, Starfleet&#x27;s ships arrived early, but not fast enough to prevent the massacre. Both Leighton and Kirk were eyewitnesses to the events on Tarsus IV. Kirk insists Kodos is dead, but reconsiders after researching Karidian&#x27;s background. Hoping to meet Karidian at a party at Leighton&#x27;s home, Kirk meets his daughter, Lenore. During a walk outside, the two find Leighton dead.

Kirk arranges for the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to ferry the acting troupe to its next destination. He transfers Lt. Kevin Riley to Engineering after learning that he, too, was a witness to the Tarsus IV massacre. These actions arouse the curiosity of First Officer Spock, who, after an investigation of his own, learns the history of the massacre, Kirk&#x27;s and Riley&#x27;s connection to it, and that seven of the nine eyewitnesses who saw Kodos order the massacre have died, in each case when Karidian&#x27;s troupe was somewhere nearby.

Riley is poisoned, and a phaser set on overload is left in Kirk&#x27;s quarters. Kirk confronts Karidian with his suspicions. Karidian does not admit to being Kodos, but argues in defense of Kodos&#x27; actions, and when asked to read a transcript of Kodos&#x27; execution order, does so with barely a glance at the paper. A computer analysis of his voice results in a near-perfect match with Kodos, but Kirk still hesitates to accuse Karidian.

Riley, recovering in sickbay, overhears Dr. McCoy&#x27;s log entry and learns that Karidian is suspected of being Kodos. Riley heads for the ship&#x27;s theater, where the troupe is performing &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and goes backstage, phaser in hand, to exact revenge for the death of his family. Kirk discovers him before he can act, and persuades him to surrender the weapon. Karidian, overhearing, is disturbed, and Lenore tries to reassure him by revealing that she has been killing the witnesses to his crimes. Kirk, overhearing this conversation, moves to arrest them both. Lenore snatches a phaser from a security guard and aims at Kirk. Karidian jumps into the line of fire, is hit, and dies. Lenore goes insane and begs her father to wake up and continue his performance. Later, on the bridge, McCoy reports on her psychiatric condition; she believes her father is still alive and giving performances to cheering crowds.

==Production==
The episode featured the final appearance (in production order) of Grace Lee Whitney (Yeoman Janice Rand). Whitney had already been notified that she was fired from the series a week before filming on this episode began. Her brief walk-on scene—in which she gives a dirty look to her rival blonde, Lenore Karidian, arriving on the bridge—was her last scene in &quot;Star Trek&quot; before her return 13 years later in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;.

This episode was the second and final appearance of Lieutenant Kevin Riley, played by Bruce Hyde, who first appeared in &quot;The Naked Time&quot;.

All first-season core &quot;Star Trek&quot; regular background players appear in this episode: Eddie Paskey (Lt. Lesley), Frank da Vinci (Lt. Brent), William Blackburn (Lt. Hadley), Ron Veto (Harrison), and Jeanne Malone (&quot;Enterprise&quot; yeoman).

The ship&#x27;s theater is a redress of the engineering set. Set pieces of the ship&#x27;s gymnasium (first seen in the episode &quot;Charlie X&quot;) are hanging on the walls, and the ceiling is visible in some of the shooting angles.

==Reception==
In 2013, &quot;Wired&quot; ranked this episode one of the top 10 episodes of the original television series.

Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode an A− rating, noting strong performances from the actors including a &quot;great Spock/McCoy dynamic&quot; and &quot;some very credible acting from Shatner.&quot; Keith DeCandido, writing for &quot;Tor.com&quot;, commended the acting of Moss, Shatner, and Anderson, but felt the episode had aged poorly in regard to being able to identify Karidian as Kodos only via an unreliable voice comparison. He gave the episode a rating of 7. Jamahl Epsicokhan of Jammer&#x27;s Reviews rated the episode 2.5 stars out of 4 and similarly praised the performances of Moss and Anderson, but criticized the ending, calling it &quot;inappropriate&quot;.

Michelle Erica Green of &quot;Trek Today&quot; also praised Moss&#x27; and Anderson&#x27;s performances, but criticized the episode&#x27;s script. Later &quot;Star Trek&quot; writer Ronald D. Moore considers the episode &quot;deeply underrated&quot; and one of the series&#x27; best.

== In popular culture ==
This episode is referenced in the HBO Max mini series &quot;Station Eleven&quot; episode &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Aren&#x27;t Dead&quot;, where the episode is playing on television.

<text>Fishers Landing is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Orleans in Jefferson County, New York, United States. It is just southwest of Grass Point State Park in the Thousand Islands region of New York. As of the 2020 census the community had a population of 119.

==Geography==
Fishers Landing is in the northern part of the town of Orleans, on the south bank of the St. Lawrence River where it enters the American Narrows, a channel separating the mainland from Wellesley Island (also part of the town of Orleans). There is a local marina where island owners and visitors park their car/boat while traveling to and from the mainland. The Rock Island Light, a New York state park, is out in the channel from Fishers Landing, and the community of Thousand Island Park is directly across the channel on Wellesley Island.

New York State Route 12 passes along the southeast edge of the Fishers Landing CDP, leading northeast (downstream along the St. Lawrence) to Interstate 81 and to Alexandria Bay, and southwest (upriver) to Clayton. New York State Route 180 intersects Route 12 at Fishers Landing, leading south to La Fargeville. Watertown, the Jefferson county seat, is to the south.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Fishers Landing CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.72%, are water.

<doc id="1059910" wikidata="Q465485" url="?curid=1059910" title="Dorothea Lieven">
<text>Princess Katharina Alexandra Dorothea von Lieven (, tr. ), née Freiin von Benckendorff, 17 December 1785 – 27 January 1857), was a Baltic German noblewoman and the wife of Prince Christoph Heinrich von Lieven, who served as the Russian ambassador to London between 1812 and 1834. She became an influential figure among many of the diplomatic, political, and social circles of 19th-century Europe.

==Early life ==
Dorothea von Benckendorff was born into Baltic German nobility in Riga in what is now Latvia. She was the daughter of the General of the Imperial army Baron Christoph von Benckendorff (Friedrichsham, 12 January 1749 – 10 June 1823), who served as the military governor of Livonia, and his wife, Baroness Anna Juliane Charlotte Schilling von Canstatt (Thalheim, 31 July 1744 – 11 March 1797), who held a high position at the Romanov Court as senior lady-in-waiting and best friend of Empress Maria Feodorovna. Dorothea was the paternal granddaughter of Johann Michael von Benckendorff and wife Sophie von Löwenstern.

Dorothea was the sister of the Russian generals Alexander and Konstantin von Benckendorff. Her sister Maria von Benckendorff (Saint Petersburg, 1784 – 1841) married Ivan Georgievich Sevitsch.

Educated at Saint Petersburg&#x27;s exclusive Smolny Convent Institute, Dorothea was assigned as a maid of honour to Maria Feodorovna. In St. Petersburg on 1 February 1800, at age fourteen, some months after finishing her studies, Dorothea married General Count (later Prince) Christoph von Lieven. Although the marriage was arranged, the couple managed to live in harmony for many years; only in the last years did serious differences arise between them that led to a total estrangement. They had one daughter and five sons, three of whom predeceased their mother: Magdalena (15 January 1804 – 1805), Paul (24 February 1805 – 13 October 1864), Alexander (9 March 1806 – 5 October 1885), Konstantin (24 April 1807 – 17 October 1838), Georg (27 October 1819 – 20 February 1835) and Arthur (1825 – 23 March 1838).

==Ambassador&#x27;s wife==
In 1810, her husband was appointed minister to Berlin. When Tsar Alexander I appointed Count von Lieven ambassador to Great Britain in 1812, Dorothea von Lieven used her intelligence, charisma, and social skills to make herself a leader of London&#x27;s politicized society, thereby contributing materially to the success of her husband&#x27;s embassy.

In London, Princess Lieven cultivated friendships with the foremost statesmen of her day. Moreover, she and Austrian Chancellor Metternich cultivated a notorious romantic liaison. She was also reputed to have had an affair with Lord Palmerston, although there is no firm proof of this. She was a close friend of Lord Castlereagh, and was one of the first people to voice concerns about his increasingly strange behaviour in the weeks leading up to his suicide. Lord Grey confided in her, even sharing with her his intense grief on the death of his grandson Charles in 1831; on the other hand, she admitted that the details of the Reform Act 1832 came as a complete surprise to her, which may be a sign that Grey did not entirely trust her in spite of their friendship.

In England&#x27;s vibrant political environment, the princess discovered in herself a flair for politics. She also became a leader of society; invitations to her house were highly sought after, and she was the first foreigner to be elected a patroness of Almack&#x27;s, London&#x27;s most exclusive social club, where Lieven introduced the waltz to England. Despite her apparently frivolous nature, she had a deep religious faith, and seems to have disapproved of the death penalty far in advance of her time. She was something of a snob and made many enemies due to her haughty manner towards those she regarded as social inferiors. Indeed, she wrote to her brother, &quot;It is not fashionable where I am not&quot;.

Dorothea von Lieven&#x27;s position as the wife of the Russian ambassador, her friendships, and her political acumen established her as a major political force. Though outwardly deferential to her husband, she was by far the stronger character and soon completely eclipsed him: London society jokingly called them &quot;the two Russian ambassadors&quot;.

==Political career==
In 1825, Tsar Alexander I entrusted Dorothea with a secret overture to the British government. &quot;It is a pity Countess Lieven wears skirts&quot;, the tsar wrote to his foreign minister Count Karl von Nesselrode-Ehreshoven, &quot;she would have made an excellent diplomat.&quot; In October 1825, when both were staying at the same resort in Brighton, Lieven in an &quot;off-the-record&quot; conversation with the British Foreign Secretary George Canning told him that Russia wanted bilateral Anglo-Russian mediation of the Greek War of Independence. She also spoke of the &quot;barbarisation project&quot; said to be planned for Greece by the Turkish government, which would have mandated the mass deportation of the Greek Christian population. Lieven passed on to Canning a note written in French as follows: &quot;The Court of Russia has positive information that before Ibrahim Pasha’s army was put into motion, an agreement was entered into by the Porte with the Pasha of Egypt that whatever part of Greece Ibrahim Pasha might conquer should be at his disposal; and that his plan of disposing of his conquest is (and was stated to the Porte to be and has been approved by the Porte) to remove whole Greek population, carrying them off to slavery in Egypt or elsewhere and to re-populate the country with Egyptians and others of the Mohammedan [Muslim] religion&quot; . Lieven&#x27;s talks with Canning led to the Protocol of St Petersburg of 1826, in which Britain and Russia proposed to mediate, by force if necessary, the end of the Greek war.

The tsar&#x27;s mission marked Dorothea Lieven&#x27;s debut as a diplomat in her own right. She at least equalled her husband in importance. During Prince Lieven&#x27;s ambassadorship in England (1812–1834), the princess played a role in the birth of modern Greece and made a notable contribution to the creation of the kingdom of Belgium. The appointment of Lord Palmerston as Foreign Secretary in 1830 is generally agreed to have been partly due to his friendship with Dorothea, who lobbied Lord Grey vigorously on his behalf. Her belief that Palmerston would be reliably pro-Russian turned out to be a mistake, however, since it was his quarrel with the tsar that ultimately led to her enforced departure from England. Her friendship with Palmerston was said to be due to a similarity in their mental processes: &quot;an intelligence which depended not on education but experience and long observation of men and women&quot;. She was wise enough to use her influence discreetly: as she observed, a foreigner who meddles in English politics &quot;is liable to end up with a broken neck&quot;.
==Recall to Russia==
In 1834, during a period of bad diplomatic relations between Russia and Great Britain, Tsar Nicholas I recalled Prince Lieven to become governor to the Tsarevitch. Despite her residence in London, the princess had already been appointed senior lady-in-waiting to Alexandra Feodorovna as of 1829.

After more than 20 years in England, the princess was horrified at the prospect of leaving her comfortable life and all her friends there; she had no wish to return to Russia, a country where she was no longer happy and whose harsh climate she now found difficult to endure. She never forgave her former friend Lord Palmerston, whose intransigence over what should have been a minor diplomatic row concerning the choice of the new British Ambassador to Russia, was largely responsible for the tsar&#x27;s decision to recall her husband. Soon after the Lievens returned to Russia, their two youngest sons suddenly died. This tragedy and her declining health caused the princess to leave her native land and settle in Paris against the wishes of her husband and the tsar. She never saw her husband again, but she was genuinely grieved when he died in January 1839.

==Paris and Guizot==
In a city where salons served a unique social and political purpose, Princess Lieven&#x27;s salon, known as &quot;the listening/observation post of Europe&quot;, empowered her to be an independent stateswoman. In 1837 she and François Guizot entered into a close personal partnership that lasted until the princess&#x27;s death and included exchanging over 5000 letters; he has been called the greatest, and perhaps only true, love of her life.
During the Crimean War (1854–1856), Princess Lieven acted as an informal and trusted conduit between the belligerents. Much to her annoyance, all Russians were ordered to leave France at the outbreak of war, and she settled for a time in Brussels, which she detested. Eventually, she found life there so tedious that she returned to Paris without permission, and the Russian government sensibly let the matter lie.

==Death==
Dorothea Lieven died peacefully at her home, 2 rue Saint-Florentin, Paris, aged 71, on 27 January 1857, with Guizot and Paul Lieven, one of her two surviving sons, beside her. She was buried, according to her wish, at the Lieven family estate of Mesothen (near Mitau) next to her two young sons who had died in St. Petersburg.

== Legacy ==

Princess Lieven &quot;succeeded in inspiring a confidence&quot; with prominent men &quot;until now unknown in the annals of England&quot;, wrote Russian foreign minister Count Nesselrode. Her friendships with King George IV, Prince Metternich, Lord Palmerston, the Duke of Wellington, George Canning, Count Nesselrode, Lord Grey, and François Guizot gave Dorothea Lieven the opportunity to exercise authority in the diplomatic councils of Great Britain, France, and Russia. She was a political force, a position reached by few other contemporary females.

The princess participated, either directly or indirectly, in a large number of major diplomatic events between 1812 and 1857. She knew &quot;everyone in the Courts and cabinets for thirty or forty years&quot;; she &quot;knew all the secret annals of diplomacy&quot;, wrote a French diplomat. Lord Palmerston, despite their friendship, seems to have resented her interference, writing that &quot;a busy woman must do harm because she can do no good.&quot; She acquired a reputation as a Tsarist secret agent.

Princess Lieven&#x27;s politically focused correspondence with luminaries across Europe has become primary source material for students of the period. Parts of the Princess&#x27;s diary, her correspondence with Lords Aberdeen and Grey, with François Guizot, with Prince Metternich, and her letters from London to her brother Count Alexander von Benckendorff (head of the Russian secret police from 1826 to 1844) have been published. The British Library holds a vast trove of unpublished material, and several Continental archives have a scattering of unpublished correspondence.

&quot;She is a stateswoman&quot;, said the Austrian ambassador to France, &quot;and a great lady in all the vicissitudes of life&quot;.

==In fiction==
She is a recurring minor figure in many historical novels about the period, notably those of Georgette Heyer. Heyer generally portrays her as a haughty, formidable and unapproachable leader of society, but in &quot;The Grand Sophy&quot; she is described as &quot;clever and amusing&quot;, and there is a passing reference in that book to her role as a political intriguer.

<doc id="1059915" wikidata="Q259422" url="?curid=1059915" title="Masako Nozawa">
<text>is a Japanese actress. Beginning work as a child actress at the age of three, by the time she became an adult, voice acting had inadvertently become her main occupation. Throughout her career, Nozawa has been affiliated with Production Baobab, 81 Produce, the self-owned Office Nozawa and Aoni Production. She is best known as the voice of Son Goku in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise, beginning with its first animated adaptation in 1986. She also voices most of the character&#x27;s male relatives, namely Son Gohan and Son Goten. Nozawa&#x27;s other roles include Kitarō in &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot; (1968, 1971 and 2008), Doraemon in the 1973 anime, and Tetsurō Hoshino in &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; (1978).

Credited as a pioneer of voice acting in Japan, Nozawa has received awards from the Animation Kobe Awards, Tokyo Anime Awards, Seiyu Awards, Japanese Movie Critics Awards, Japan Academy Film Prize, and the Kikuchi Kan Prize. Her work voicing Goku in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; video games has earned her two Guinness World Records, including for the longest video game voice acting career. Nozawa is a vice president of the Japan Actors Union. Her husband was fellow voice actor Masaaki Tsukada.

== Early life ==
Masako Nozawa was born on October 25, 1936, in the Nippori area of Arakawa, Tokyo as the only child of painter Ryoshu Nozawa (the top disciple of Kawai Gyokudō) and housewife Tsuru (an orphaned daughter of a daimyo). Due to the influence of her aunt, Shochiku actress Kiyono Sasaki, Masako became a child actress at the age of three. Although she does not remember the titles of her earliest films, she said many depicted the love between a mother and her child. In 1944, the family moved to Numata, Gunma to avoid the air raids of World War II. Nozawa lived in the city from the third grade of elementary school until she graduated high school.

Her first play was a school production of &quot;Umihiko Yamahiko&quot; in fifth grade, where she played the male role. Both of her parents loved kabuki and she studied &quot;Nihon-buyō&quot;, thus, Nozawa said she was never shy about being on stage. Despite her aunt&#x27;s wishes, Nozawa pursued theater instead of film. When she obtained a copy of her family register to apply for high school, she learned that Tsuru was not her biological mother. Because Tsuru had had a miscarriage and could not give birth, her parents agreed to Ryoshu fathering a child with a woman he knew in order to continue the Nozawa family lineage. Upon this admission, Tsuru told Masako she had raised her as her own and would continue to do so, and likewise, Masako later said &quot;There is no other mother for me than her.&quot;

== Career ==
In junior high school, Nozawa joined the Tougei Theater Company and worked as an actress in Tokyo during school holidays. She got in thanks to her aunt knowing a producer at NHK who gave a recommendation. Her first role was an elderly nurse in &quot;The Abortion Doctor&quot;, which the company gave her an award for. After graduating high school, she moved to Tokyo. She began voice acting in her late teens, in order to help support the struggling theater company. She said her first voice role was dubbing an Indian boy in a foreign film at 19. She explained, &quot;It was the early days of television, and many foreign dramas were broadcast. At the time, voice dubbing was also done live, so using children to play boy roles was a concern. But adult men&#x27;s voices have already changed, so women were chosen for child roles.&quot; Although she did not plan on it and had already done a lot of acting in television dramas, voice acting saw a boom and became Nozawa&#x27;s main occupation. Her TV drama credits of the time include &quot;Akado Suzunosuke&quot; (1957) and &quot;Anmitsu Hime&quot; (1958).

Nozawa made her anime debut in &quot;Wolf Boy Ken&quot; (1963), and had a guest role on &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (1963). Her first regular role was in &quot;Uchuu Patrol Hopper&quot; (1965), and she went on to voice brothers Tonkichi and Kanta Hanamura in &quot;Sally, the Witch&quot; (1966). Nozawa&#x27;s first lead role was Kitarō in &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot; (1968), which she was selected for by series creator Shigeru Mizuki. It also marked the first time she did magazine interviews and her first fan event. For the 1973 adaptation of &quot;Doraemon&quot;, Nozawa took over the role of the title character from Kōsei Tomita, who had voiced the character for the first 13 episodes. She went on to voice Tetsurō Hoshino in &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; (1978), again being selected by the work&#x27;s original creator Leiji Matsumoto. Although she had reprised the role of Kitarō for the 1971 adaptation of &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot;, Nozawa did not do the same for its 1985 adaptation. This was due to Fuji TV having a rule that voice actors could not play more than one lead character at a time. However, she noted that this eventually resulted in her landing the role of Son Goku in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; (1986), as otherwise she would not have even been allowed to audition. She was chosen to play Goku by &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; creator Akira Toriyama, who later stated that he would hear Nozawa&#x27;s voice in his head when writing the original manga.

Nozawa led a lawsuit by 361 voice actors against Nippon Animation and its recording studio subsidiary Onkyo Eizo System in demand of unpaid royalties from DVD releases of anime series. After four years, a judge ruled in 2003 that Onkyo Eizo owed 87 million yen (US$796,000) to the actors, but dismissed the case against Nippon Animation as they deemed actor compensation to be the responsibility of the recording studio. Both parties appealed the decision. On August 25, 2004, the Tokyo High Court upheld the ruling against Onkyo Eizo and also found Nippon Animation liable, ordering both companies to pay the 87 million yen. The Supreme Court of Japan upheld the ruling in 2005. On April 1, 2006, Nozawa left 81 Produce to establish Office Nozawa. In 2012, she closed the self-owned talent agency. A number of voice actors who were affiliated with her agency went on to affiliate with Media Force.

In 2017, Guinness World Records presented Nozawa with two world records related to her voicing Son Goku in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; video games for 23 years and 218 days; &quot;longest video game voice acting career&quot; and &quot;voice actor who voiced the same character in a video game for the longest period&quot;. Two years later, Nozawa was included on &quot;Newsweek Japan&quot;″s list of &quot;100 Globally Respected Japanese People&quot;. In December 2023, Nozawa became the first voice actor to receive the Kikuchi Kan Prize in its 71 year history.

In October 2024, Aoni Production and artificial intelligence platform CoeFont announced that Nozawa was one of the voice actors that they would use vocal data from to create AI-replicated voices for use in virtual assistants, medical devices and robots. Planning to make it available in multiple languages, beginning with English and Chinese, the companies acknowledged the potential threat to actors&#x27; rights and livelihoods posed by AI, and promised not to use the data for performances in animation or similar works.

==Philosophy and technique==
Nozawa said she initially preferred acting on stage because she could see the audience&#x27;s reaction, but came to prefer voice acting in her 30s for &quot;breathing life into things with only your voice.&quot; However, she noted she views the two jobs as essentially the same, only differing in name. Nozawa is extremely dedicated to her craft and is known for never being late. The only exception saw her show up to a morning recording session for &quot;Tiger Mask&quot; ten minutes late wearing ill-fitting clothing, and only afterwards explaining that her house had burned down that morning so she had to borrow clothes from a friend. Although she has sung some songs related to her acting roles, such as the theme to &quot;The Monster Kid&quot;, Nozawa said she is not a good singer and always tries to get out of it. In 2005, Nozawa said she had never turned an acting role down and had never regretted taking one either. Nozawa mainly plays young male characters. This originated in the early days of voice acting when the dubbing of foreign films was done live and actual boys could not be used; staff members would recommend and automatically cast her because they knew she had done it before. Nozawa also speculated this might be due to her childhood as a tomboy; she was the only girl having sword fights with the boys, and preferred that over playing with dolls.

When she goes to an audition, Nozawa does not create the character&#x27;s voice beforehand, she improvises once she is in front of the microphone. However, after getting the role, she does think about the character&#x27;s history and background and incorporates that into her acting. If it is an adaptation, she does not read the original work beforehand because she does not want to know what is going to happen so that the reactions in her performances are authenthic. She watches the works she is in when they air on television. For &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; specifically, she said she watches it twice; the first is simply as a fan for personal enjoyment, but the second is to critique her performance and see if there are adjustments that need to be made. During recording sessions, she avoids speaking with the actors who are playing enemy characters; &quot;Of course, if someone talks to me, I respond, but I try not to initiate conversations myself.&quot;

In &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, Nozawa is responsible for portraying Goku as well as his sons Gohan and Goten. When they have scenes together, she records the lines for all three in the same take, switching on the spot, rather than performing singular takes for each character. Her colleague Toshio Furukawa stated there is no one else who can do this, and Nozawa revealed that younger actors once asked her to stop because it gives the impression that anyone can. Nozawa helped create the unique way Goku speaks, which is known as . His famous phrase from anime adaptations, , was ad-libbed by her during a recording session as a joke for the staff. However, she noted Toei Animation has somehow gone on to receive credit for creating it.

When asked about the voice acting industry in 2016, Nozawa said it had become formulaic and young actors lacked individuality, with everyone using the same &quot;cute girl&quot; voice for example. She speculated one of the reasons for this was due to voice acting schools. Although she had taught a few lessons before herself, Nozawa said those were largely reluctant on her part and she tries not to do it anymore because acting is not something that can be taught; &quot;If you tell a rookie who doesn&#x27;t know what to do, &#x27;In this scene, you should act like this&#x27;, everyone will act that way.&quot;

<text>Buxton is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) on Hatteras Island (part of the Outer Banks) near Cape Hatteras. It is located in Dare County in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 1,181. Located at the widest part of Hatteras Island, it is the largest community on Hatteras Island both in terms of area and population, and is home to the island&#x27;s schools and other major public buildings and offices.

North Carolina Highway 12 links the community to other Outer Banks communities such as Avon, Frisco, and Hatteras. Buxton is most famous for being the location of Cape Hatteras Light and of the accompanied beaches; it is also the home of the Cape Hatteras Anglers Club.

The residents of Buxton are governed by the Dare County Board of Commissioners. Buxton is part of District 4, along with Avon, Frisco, Hatteras, Rodanthe, Waves and Salvo.

In addition to Cape Hatteras Light, the shipwreck was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

== Demographics ==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,181 people, 572 households, and 405 families residing in the CDP.

==Recreation==

Watersports are common on both the Pamlico Sound side and the Atlantic Ocean side of the community. Proximity to the convergence of the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream result in some of the largest surf available on the East Coast. On the protected soundside of the island, watersports such as windsurfing, kayaking, kiteboarding, and swimming are all readily available and accessible.

==Education==

Residents are served by the new Cape Hatteras Elementary School, opened in 2001 (home of the Tropical Storms) and Cape Hatteras Secondary School of Coastal Studies, a combination middle school and high school (Home of the Hurricanes) newly rebuilt in 2007 on the NC 12 site of the original Cape Hatteras Elementary and Cape Hatteras Secondary Schools, in Buxton. Both schools are part of the Dare County Schools district. 
==British Cemetery==
On May 21, 1942, the body of a British seaman, unidentifiable but presumed to be from the HMT Bedfordshire, sunk by a German U-boat, washed ashore. The month prior, a British sailor from the sunken merchant ship &quot;San Delfino&quot; had been buried in Buxton. The &quot;Bedfordshire&quot; seaman was interred in an adjacent plot, resulting in a British Cemetery, formally known as Cape Hatteras Coast Guard Burial Ground.
==Climate==

According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Buxton, North Carolina has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (&quot;Cfak&quot;). Cfak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature &gt; 32.0 °F (&gt; 0.0 °C), at least eight months with an average mean temperature ≥ 50.0 °F (≥ 10.0 °C), at least one month with an average mean temperature ≥ 71.6 °F (≥ 22.0 °C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. During the summer months in Buxton, a cooling afternoon sea breeze is present on most days, but episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values ≥ 100 °F (≥ 38 °C). Buxton is prone to hurricane strikes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season which extends from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. During the winter months, episodes of cold and wind can occur with wind chill values &lt; 15 °F (&lt; -9 °C). The plant hardiness zone in Buxton is 8b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 19.3 °F (-7.1 °C). The average seasonal (Dec-Mar) snowfall total is &lt; 2 inches (&lt; 5 cm).

==Ecology==

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Buxton, North Carolina would have a dominant vegetation type of Live oak/Sea Oats Uniola paniculata (&quot;90&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Coastal Prairie (&quot;20&quot;).

<text>The Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group (JBIG) was a group of experts nominated by national standards bodies and major companies to work to produce standards for bi-level image coding. The &quot;joint&quot; refers to its status as a committee working on both ISO and ITU-T standards. It was one of two sub-groups of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 29, Working Group 1 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1), whose official title is &quot;Coding of still pictures&quot;.

The Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group created the JBIG and JBIG2 standards. The group often meets jointly with the JPEG committee, which typically meets three times annually. 

ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29 Working Group 1 (working together with ITU-T Study Group 16 – VCEG and previously also with Study Group 8 – SG8) is responsible for both JPEG and JBIG standards. It included two sub-groups: the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG SG) and the Joint Bi-level Image experts Group (JBIG SG). After completing the 2019 edition of the JBIG2 standard, the JBIG subgroup was closed and its maintenance responsibilities were assigned to the general JPEG group.

In the mid-1980s, both CCITT (now ITU-T) and ISO had standardization groups for image coding: CCITT Study Group (SG) VIII (Telematic Services) and ISO TC97 SC2 WG8 (Coding of Audio and Picture Information). They were historically targeted on image communication. In 1986, it was decided to create the Joint (CCITT/ISO) Photographic Expert Group. In 1988, it was decided to create the Joint (CCITT/ISO) Bi-level Image Group – JBIG.

== Published standards ==
JBIG have developed following standards, which were published by ISO/IEC and/or ITU-T:

Note: The published JBIG2 standard was revised by three later amendments, which were consolidated into the current (2019) edition.

<doc id="1059938" wikidata="Q5051464" url="?curid=1059938" title="Cataract Gorge">
<text>The Cataract Gorge is a river gorge in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia, approximately 1.5 km from the city centre. It is one of the region&#x27;s premier tourist attractions with a Cataract Gorge boat trip leaving from Home Point Parade. It is found at the lower section of the South Esk River.

== History ==
The earliest known European visitor to the site was William Collins, who discovered its entrance in 1804.
A pathway, known as the King’s Bridge-Cataract Walk, and originally built by volunteers in the 1890s, runs along the north bank of the Cataract Gorge, and is a popular tourist destination. The original toll house at which pedestrians had to pay to enter the walk can still be seen near King&#x27;s Bridge on the northern edge of the gorge.

The chairlift is the longest single-span chairlift in the world, with the longest span being . The chairlift, built in 1972, has a total span of .

In the past, there was a power station at Duck Reach, about from a suspension bridge which was built in 1904. It was washed away in the floods of 1929, rebuilt and then decommissioned when the Trevallyn Dam was finished in 1955. The building is now an interpretive museum.

== Features ==
The First Basin on the southern side features a swimming pool, the aforementioned chairlift, two cafés, a funicular railway and an open area surrounded by bushland. At the bottom of the funicular railways is a small cottage which contains photographs and paintings of the basin and downriver Gorge. The basin itself has created many of myths about its depth: some locals say it is a bottomless pit; a volcanic plug; or that a submarine sent in to find its bottom during the 1960s ran out cable before accomplishing this feat. In fact, the basin was formed by erosion at the intersection of two faults - the Basin Road Fault and an un-named fault approximately at right angles which the South Esk is following. Where the two faults meet, the Dolerite rock is badly shattered and hence more easily eroded, giving rise to the formation of the basin.

Measurements in 2016 found the maximum depth is .

The northern side, named the Cliff Grounds, is a landscaped Victorian garden containing ferns, exotic plants and peacocks. It is now provided with facilities for visitors.

Further upstream is the historic Duck Reach Power Station, now an Interpretation Centre. The Launceston City Council originally commissioned the Power Station in 1893, making it the largest hydro-electric scheme of its day. By 1895 it was lighting the city.
Other activities include boat cruise through the accessible section of river, cable hang gliding experience that soars for 200 metres from a cliff top and rock climbing.

Prior to the development of the Trevallyn Dam there were three lesser basins upstream of the &quot;First Basin&quot;, with the second and third still visible on a map, while the fourth is flooded by Lake Trevallyn.

At the lower end of the gorge, the South Esk spills into the Tamar River going under King&#x27;s Bridge and Paterson Bridge which was built more recently. King&#x27;s Bridge was the only bridge leading north out of the city for nearly 100 years. The Paterson Bridge was officially opened on November 2, 1973.

This section of river is a well recognised section of whitewater. It provides world class kayaking. An inaugural race is usually scheduled in late January, thanks to Hydro Tasmania.

<doc id="1059941" wikidata="Q532156" url="?curid=1059941" title="Yordan Letchkov">
<text>Yordan Letchkov Yankov (also transliterated Jordan, Iordan, Lechkov) (; born 9 July 1967) is a Bulgarian former professional footballer. He is generally regarded as one of the best players to come out of Bulgaria and was a key member of the squad which reached the semi-finals of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Known to many as &quot;The Magician&quot;, Letchkov was a gifted player who could play as a central midfielder or on the left side of midfield, and he was easily recognizable for his baldness. He was best known for his dribbling ability. However, his career was often adversely affected by his moody nature and the numerous arguments and fallings-out he had with fellow players and managers. He was the mayor of his home town for eight years, but was removed from duty due to corruption.

==Club career==
Born in Straldzha, Letchkov began his career as a youngster with Sliven football club (Bulgaria), after breaking into the first team at a young age he secured a transfer to Bulgaria&#x27;s top side CSKA Sofia (Bulgaria, 1991–92 season) and soon after he made the move to Germany with Hamburger SV (Germany, from the 1992–93 season to the 1995–96 season). After that he secured a move to Olympique de Marseille (France, 1996–97 season), at this point one of the top clubs in Europe. However a difficult relationship with the club&#x27;s management led to his departure after one season.

His next stop took him to Turkey with Beşiktaş (Turkey, from the 1997–98 season). However, just after six months with the club, he returned late from holidays and fell into a dispute with the manager John Toshack. After being fined by the club, he refused to pay, stated that he has quit football and subsequently returned to Bulgaria. He has been variously quoted since as saying the Istanbul club owes him money, that he was unable to get on with its coach Toshack and that his wife could not settle in Turkey. However he soon started training with a Bulgarian club. Beşiktaş appealed to FIFA which declared Letchkov in breach of contract and ordered him to pay 200.000 DM in compensation. Beşiktaş renewed its appeals to UEFA and FIFA when Letchkov turned out without club permission for Bulgaria in a friendly against Argentina. FIFA subsequently ruled that Letchkov was ineligible to play for any other team without clearance from Beşiktaş, and that included his national side. Despite helping Bulgaria to reach 1998 World Cup, he could not play due to his dispute with Beşiktaş.

After about three years away from football, Letchkov returned to the game in the 2001–02 season with CSKA Sofia. Between 2002 and 2004 he became player-coach of OFC Sliven, a club in the second division of Bulgarian football. Letchkov is often referred to as being part of the &quot;Golden Generation&quot; of Bulgarian football, who along with Stoichkov, Kostadinov and Balakov led the national side to the semifinals of the 1994 World Cup.

==International career==
Letchkov played 45 matches and scored five goals for Bulgaria; however his international career was limited by a series of disagreements with coaches and the Bulgarian Football Federation.

He is perhaps best remembered for scoring the winner against Germany in the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup, as Bulgaria reached the semi-finals where they were beaten by Italy. Above all thanks to his very good matches in that World Cup, he was placed in the 13th position of the 1994 Ballon d&#x27;Or.

Letchkov went on to shine in the 1996 European Championships in England despite the failure of Bulgaria to reach the quarter finals: he played very well against Spain and Romania, and producing a man-of-the-match performance in the group B last match, against a strong French side. He went on to contribute greatly to his nation&#x27;s successful qualification campaign for the 1998 World Cup championships. However his chance to play in the tournament was blocked by FIFA due to a little publicised contractual dispute with Beşiktaş (see also above in &quot;Club&quot;).

==Post-football==
Letchkov took part in a TV series called &quot;Golden Boots&quot; in 1998 with various other footballers, and in 2012 in the sport documentary called &quot;Stoichkov&quot;. After his retirement from football he has successfully started a career as a businessman (owning luxury hotels and a football academy) and politician. He was elected Mayor of his home town, Sliven, in 2003 and reelected in 2007.

Since 2005, he has also been vice president of the Bulgarian Football Union. In April 2010 he was removed from the mayorship by the Sliven district court after he was charged with official misconduct, but the Burgas appellate court restored him to his position on 28 June 2010. Letchkov was replaced by the new mayor of Sliven Kolyo Milev in the 2011 local elections, who outran him with 56,72% vs. 43,28% of the votes. Many citizens stated that they had voted for a member of the opposing party to the ones they support only to remove Letchkov from his post. Many of the major boulevards in the city were left dug up and in deep pot-holes for nearly two years due to &quot;controversy&quot; and a lawsuit between the company working on restructuring the city&#x27;s water supply and the city council. In contrast, while he was still mayor, the streets that lead to Letchkov&#x27;s hotels in the city were reconstructed and refreshed with the addition of gardens and aesthetic sidewalks and street lighting.
Other scandals constantly accompanied him during his time as mayor, including the disrespecting of journalists and police officers (showing the middle finger) because he was wanted by the police after fleeing from a traffic stop after throwing his documents at them.

<doc id="1059946" wikidata="Q7897038" url="?curid=1059946" title="Unlicensed broadcasting">
<text>Unlicensed broadcasting, also called pirate broadcasting, is a term used for any type of broadcasting without a broadcast license.

Some unlicensed broadcasting, such as certain low-power broadcasting, may be legal. For example, in the United States, Title 47 CFR Part 15 (or &quot;part 15&quot;), is a regulation that allows unlicensed broadcasting within a range of just a few meters. Legal broadcast methods may include ISM bands, used legally at low power to broadcast for personal use, a video sender, used to distribute video (sometimes wireless security cameras) within a home or small business, or FM transmitters, used to transmit satellite radio or digital media players to stereo systems which have no wired input (i.e. car radios).

The term &quot;pirate broadcasting,&quot; by contrast, is almost always used to indicate broadcasting that is illegal, particularly as applied to pirate radio and pirate television. The justifications usually given for legal prohibitions on broadcasting include the need to keep certain broadcast frequencies open for emergency communications, the need to control the broadcasting of material that is obscene or violates copyrights, and the preservation of government revenue derived from licensing airwaves.

<doc id="1059950" wikidata="Q270970" url="?curid=1059950" title="Alexi Laiho">
<text>Alexi Laiho (; born Markku Uula Aleksi Laiho; 8 April 1979 – 29 December 2020) was a Finnish guitarist, composer, and vocalist. He was best known as the lead guitarist, lead vocalist and founding member of the melodic death metal band Children of Bodom, and was also the guitarist for Sinergy, the Local Band, Kylähullut, and Bodom After Midnight, which formed just prior to his death. Laiho had previously played with Thy Serpent and Impaled Nazarene on occasion, as well as Warmen and Hypocrisy.

==Career==
Laiho started playing violin at the age of seven and guitar at the age of eleven. His main guitar influence was Helloween. He then became interested in more extreme, mainly black metal music.

His first guitar was a Tokai Stratocaster.

In 1993, after taking part in an experimental band named T.O.L.K. with friends he met while attending the Finnish Pop &amp; Jazz Conservatory, Laiho formed Children of Bodom together with drummer Jaska Raatikainen, under the name of IneartheD.

On 31 October 1997, prior to releasing their debut album, Children of Bodom played their first concert in Helsinki, as opening act for Norway&#x27;s Dimmu Borgir.

Silenoz, Dimmu Borgir guitarist, on Laiho&#x27;s first performance: &quot;We could hear the opening band playing from backstage. We were like, ‘Holy shit, what is this?&#x27; It sounded like Yngwie Malmsteen on speed. We ran out and watched the spectacle and stood there with our jaws open&quot;. &quot;There was this fucking beast on the guitar,&quot; added Dimmu&#x27;s then-keyboardist Kimberly Goss, who formed power metal band Sinergy with Alexi in 1997, and married him in 2002. &quot;I was looking at our guitar player like, ‘I don&#x27;t know, man, you&#x27;ve got some competition...&quot;

Laiho recorded three full-length albums with Sinergy. An unreleased fourth album was recorded and slated to be released in 2005, but the finishing touches were never completed due to Laiho&#x27;s demanding schedule with Children of Bodom.

In 2004, Laiho founded a side-project called Kylähullut, which was assembled together with drummer Tonmi Lillman (ex-Sinergy) and singer Vesa Jokinen 69er of Finnish punk band Klamydia. Their discography includes two EP&#x27;s, and two full-length albums one of which features Laiho&#x27;s wife, Goss, singing in Finnish.

Children of Bodom played at the 2008 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards. There, Laiho also received the Dimebag Award for &quot;Best Shredder&quot; and performed a track off of Bodom&#x27;s 2008&#x27;s album, &quot;Blooddrunk&quot;.

Laiho appears on Canadian thrash metal outfit Annihilator&#x27;s 2007 album, Metal, as a guest, playing a guitar solo on the song &quot;Downright Dominate&quot;.

On 3 July 2012, Children of Bodom announced on their Facebook page that they had to cancel two European shows because Laiho had been taken to the hospital because of severe stomach pain. The frontman was hospitalized once again the following year in Nashville, leading to speculation about his dangerous relationship with alcohol, which he&#x27;d later discuss in multiple interviews.

On 15 December 2019, Children of Bodom played their last show at the Icehall in Helsinki, dubbed &quot;A Chapter Called Children of Bodom&quot;; in November it was announced that after this show, the group would disband after over two decades together. For legal reasons, Laiho would no longer be able to continue using the Children of Bodom name.

In March 2020, Laiho announced his new band together with former Children of Bodom guitarist Daniel Freyberg, Bodom After Midnight featuring drummer Waltteri Väyrynen and bassist Mitja Toivonen.

Laiho died on 29 December 2020 due to liver degeneration resulting from years of alcohol abuse, leaving behind a few songs recorded with Bodom After Midnight to be published posthumously. Several months later, Daniel Freyberg told &quot;Loudwire&quot; that Bodom After Midnight would disband rather than replacing Laiho. Regarding his death, in a 2023 interview, former Children of Bodom keyboardist Janne Wirman reflected back to what Alexi Laiho had told him in 2016 after his health issues came to light, that he had no plans to stop drinking but instead plans to drink himself to death.

== Musical style and influences ==
His main influences lay with classic metal bands like Manowar, Helloween, Judas Priest and W.A.S.P.

==Awards and recognition==

Laiho has often been described as a visionary who brought back melody and flamboyance to metal music in a post-grunge and nu metal era. His guitar style was influenced by black metal, power metal and classical music, all cemented together by blistering solos. He was known for his guitar-keyboard solo duels with Janne Wirman, keyboardist in his band Children of Bodom. Alexi also incorporated various references to classical music in his early works.

Laiho received a Metal Hammer Golden Gods prize in the category of Dimebag Darrell Shredder Award in 2008.

Laiho received widespread acclaim for his guitar work and according to AllMusic, he is &quot;widely celebrated as one of the genre&#x27;s most accomplished players&quot;. In 2004 he was ranked No. 96 out of 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time by &quot;Guitar World&quot;. &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine has also ranked him as one of the 50 fastest guitarists in the world. In addition, Roadrunner Records ranked Laiho at No. 41 out of 50 of the greatest metal frontmen. Furthermore, &quot;Total Guitar&quot; conducted a public voting poll to determine the greatest metal guitarist of all time; Laiho was voted No. 1 out of 20 metal guitarists, with over 20% of the vote.

== Personal life and death ==

On 1 February 2002, at a private ceremony in Finland, Laiho married long time girlfriend and Sinergy frontwoman Kimberly Goss. They shared identical tattoos of a coiled snake around their ring fingers and had each other&#x27;s initials tattooed on the upper part of their left arms. According to official documents, Laiho filed for divorce in November 2002, but withdrew his application, never to file it again. The couple separated in 2004, but were on good terms and had regular text and video contact until the day he died, as confirmed by the Finnish press. Drama and infighting between Laiho&#x27;s sister and widow resulted in a public back and forth exchange, with both parties airing their grievances to the Finnish media.

For several years after his separation from Goss, Laiho was then linked with Kristen Mulderig, manager of Slayer until mid-2015. Later that same year, he began a relationship with Kelli Wright, an Australian public relations manager. 

Laiho had a history of alcohol abuse, which was the cause of his death. In an interview in 2019 he talked about how the pressures of life on the road affected him; he mentioned the song &quot;This Road&quot; from 2019&#x27;s &quot;Hexed&quot; and said, &quot;A lot of people thought it was about alcoholism, but it&#x27;s more about being addicted to being on the road. Sometimes it feels like after 20 years of being on the road, everything just becomes kind of a blur and you don&#x27;t know what the hell&#x27;s going on.&quot; He claimed he used to drink heavily but cut back in 2013, not drinking while on tour anymore, and mentioned that &quot;Hexed&quot; first single, &quot;Under Grass and Clover&quot;, documented the pain of withdrawal. In 2023, Children of Bodom keyboardist Janne Wirman revealed that Alexi Laiho never actually stopped drinking, and in 2016 had told him &quot;I&#x27;m going to drink until I die.&quot; In 2024, Janne Wirman revealed that after Alexi&#x27;s return from Australia, where he had spent time with his partner, Kelli Wright, his bandmates started noticing that Laiho&#x27;s health was deteriorating. Wirman remarked that Laiho had lost a lot of weight and his attempts to play guitar ended up in failure, as he &quot;couldn&#x27;t play at all&quot;. In the same interview, Henkka Seppälä admitted that they had talked to Alexi at the end of the &quot;Hexed&quot; tour, however this only ended up in having an argument. The bassist also points out that their tour manager &quot;had phone numbers to every city&#x27;s morgue during their tour, in case they found Alexi dead in his bunk&quot;.

On 4 January 2021, a post on his official Facebook page stated Laiho had died the previous week. No official cause of death was given, only stating he succumbed at his Helsinki home to &quot;long-term health issues during his last years&quot;. The death date was later confirmed to be 29 December 2020. A private funeral service for Laiho was held on 28 January 2021.

On 5 March 2021 Kimberly Goss revealed the official cause of Laiho&#x27;s death on her Instagram: &quot;alcohol-induced degeneration of the liver and pancreas connective tissue&quot;. Additionally, a mix of painkillers, opioids and insomnia medication was found in his system. The cause of death was originally published in Finnish as &quot;&quot;, which translates into English as fatty liver disease and pancreatic fibrosis. Laiho&#x27;s sister stated that the family wanted the details of his death to remain private, however Goss maintained that it was her right as his legal widow to disclose the information and bring closure to his fans, hoping the tragedy could inspire lives to be saved and &quot;help others struggling with these same demons.&quot;

Laiho&#x27;s ashes were laid to rest on 8 December 2021, one day after a private memorial service was held by Goss.

<doc id="1059960" wikidata="Q7135017" url="?curid=1059960" title="Parallel rendering">
<text>Parallel rendering (or distributed rendering) is the application of parallel programming to the computational domain of computer graphics. Rendering graphics can require massive computational resources for complex scenes that arise in scientific visualization, medical visualization, CAD applications, and virtual reality. Recent research has also suggested that parallel rendering can be applied to mobile gaming to decrease power consumption and increase graphical fidelity. Rendering is an embarrassingly parallel workload in multiple domains (e.g., pixels, objects, frames) and thus has been the subject of much research.

== Workload distribution ==
There are two, often competing, reasons for using parallel rendering. Performance scaling allows frames to be rendered more quickly while data scaling allows larger data sets to be visualized. Different methods of distributing the workload tend to favor one type of scaling over the other. There can also be other advantages and disadvantages such as latency and load balancing issues. The three main options for primitives to distribute are entire frames, pixels, or objects (e.g. triangle meshes).

=== Frame distribution ===
Each processing unit can render an entire frame from a different point of view or moment in time. The frames rendered from different points of view can improve image quality with anti-aliasing or add effects like depth-of-field and three-dimensional display output. This approach allows for good performance scaling but no data scaling. 

When rendering sequential frames in parallel there will be a lag for interactive sessions. The lag between user input and the action being displayed is proportional to the number of sequential frames being rendered in parallel.

=== Pixel distribution ===
Sets of pixels in the screen space can be distributed among processing units in what is often referred to as sort first rendering. 

Distributing interlaced lines of pixels gives good load balancing but makes data scaling impossible. Distributing contiguous 2D tiles of pixels allows for data scaling by culling data with the view frustum. However, there is a data overhead from objects on frustum boundaries being replicated and data has to be loaded dynamically as the view point changes. Dynamic load balancing is also needed to maintain performance scaling.

=== Object distribution ===
Distributing objects among processing units is often referred to as sort last rendering. It provides good data scaling and can provide good performance scaling, but it requires the intermediate images from processing nodes to be alpha composited to create the final image. As the image resolution grows, the alpha compositing overhead also grows.

A load balancing scheme is also needed to maintain performance regardless of the viewing conditions. This can be achieved by over partitioning the object space and assigning multiple pieces to each processing unit in a random fashion, however this increases the number of alpha compositing stages required to create the final image. Another option is to assign a contiguous block to each processing unit and update it dynamically, but this requires dynamic data loading.

=== Hybrid distribution ===
The different types of distributions can be combined in a number of fashions. A couple of sequential frames can be rendered in parallel while also rendering each of those individual frames in parallel using a pixel or object distribution. Object distributions can try to minimize their overlap in screen space in order to reduce alpha compositing costs, or even use a pixel distribution to render portions of the object space.

== Open source applications ==
The open source software package Chromium provides a parallel rendering mechanism for existing applications. It intercepts the OpenGL calls and processes them, typically to send them to multiple rendering units driving a display wall.

Equalizer is an open source rendering framework and resource management system for multipipe applications. Equalizer provides an API to write parallel, scalable visualization applications which are configured at run-time by a resource server.

OpenSG is an open source scenegraph system that provides parallel rendering capabilities, especially on clusters. It hides the complexity of parallel multi-threaded and clustered applications and supports sort-first as well as sort-last rendering.

Golem is an open source decentralized application used for parallel computing that currently works with rendering in Blender and has plans to incorporate more uses.

<text>KVIE (channel 6) is a PBS member television station in Sacramento, California, United States. The station is owned by KVIE, Inc., a community-based non-profit organization. KVIE&#x27;s studios are located on West El Camino Avenue in the Natomas district of Sacramento, and its transmitter is located in Walnut Grove, California.

After years of interest in educational television in the Sacramento area, KVIE began broadcasting in February 1959, airing evening educational programs from PBS predecessor National Educational Television and daytime instructional output for schools. Originally located in studios in Sacramento used by a previous UHF station that had become outdated and run down by the 1980s, KVIE relocated to its present studios in 1990. KVIE&#x27;s local programming has focused on topics including agriculture and activity at the California state capitol.

==History==
===Construction===
Channel 6 was allocated for educational use in Sacramento in 1952 after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lifted its four-year freeze on new TV station applications in 1952. The next year, the first interest was expressed in the educational channel by a consortium of school officials in 15 Superior California counties. In 1955, it joined forces with a similar group in the Stockton area, the Delta-Sierra Educational Television Corporation, after previously forming a joint study committee with the Stockton group. The combined group, Central California Educational Television (CCET), had board members from Ceres in the south to Chico in the north and represented a total of 20 counties. Both groups continued to also exist separately.

In October 1957, CCET approved a fundraising project to raise necessary money for staffing. The fund drive needed to raise money from the community to support matching funds from the Fund for Adult Education; John C. Crabbe, one of KVIE&#x27;s founders, traveled the region and gave 92 speeches in 90 days. This drive raised $205,000, enough to qualify for the matching funds. In April, KOVR extended an offer to the station, which was accepted, to use facilities it had acquired when it purchased the assets of UHF station KCCC-TV the year prior on Garden Highway; KOVR would also carry demonstration programs to present educational television to the area until the station launched.

The FCC granted CCET a construction permit on July 30, 1958. The consortium invited proposals for call signs, selecting KVIE (for &quot;Valley Information and Education&quot; as well as containing VI, the Roman numeral for 6). The pilot programs on KOVR ended in December 1958 in preparation for the launch of channel 6.

===Early years===
KVIE began broadcasting on February 23, 1959, with evening educational programming. The first educational programs for schools were broadcast at the end of March. In 1964, KIXE-TV began broadcasting to the Northstate; KVIE programs were received by microwave at Chico State College, local programs and identifications were added, and the result was transmitted to the region. Founding manager and director John C. Crabbe resigned in 1968 at the request of the board of directors over budgetary issues; this was later rescinded, and he resigned the next year instead. While bickering with the consortium of schools using its instructional programming and financial issues confronted KVIE at this time, 1970 also saw the station move its transmitter to Walnut Grove, giving its broadcasts parity with the market&#x27;s three VHF commercial stations. Previously, limited power and the orientation of many Sacramento-area TV antennas away from KVIE&#x27;s transmitter near Placerville and toward Walnut Grove hindered reception.

KVIE steadily increased its local programming. Most of its early efforts centered around activities at the state capitol. The station televised the full 14-hour death penalty hearing for Caryl Chessman, a man who was convicted for a series of crimes in the late 1940s, and also aired governors&#x27; press conferences and legislative hearings at a time when longform coverage of such events was rare on television.

The 1970s were turbulent times for station leadership. Art Paul succeeded Crabbe in 1970, and while he was successful at managing KVIE&#x27;s finances—an issue in Crabbe&#x27;s last years—station board members desired to increase local programming, and there were objections to several decisions and use of station funds. The board of directors recommended not rehiring Paul when his contract expired. Instructional programs also went by the wayside in 1978 as a result of Proposition 13, which capped and reduced property taxes and severely restricted new tax increases; schools could no longer afford the programs as a result of declining tax receipts.

Under John Hershberger, general manager from 1979 to 1994, KVIE renewed its emphasis on local program production, which had been a sore point under Paul. KVIE supporter organization Friends of Six, in a unique attempt to help raise funds for the station, opened &quot;At Six&quot;, a restaurant in the Sierra 2 performing arts center. The cafe lasted a year, beset by management turnover and poor advertising, and its closure left the station out $35,000 in money it gave for setup costs.

===A new building and digitalization===
The Garden Highway building, which had been constructed by KCCC-TV in stages in the early 1950s, was no longer adequate for KVIE after several decades of use and decay. In 1984, the station conducted studies to identify a site for a new station facility. KVIE had to lease other office space, and during the winter, portable toilets were necessary because the plumbing did not always work. Fundraising efforts began in 1985; at the same time, it was announced that KVIE would move to a new tower being erected by KTXL (channel 40) in Walnut Grove. Ground was broken on the present Natomas studios in 1988, and the station moved in in January 1990. In Hershberger&#x27;s final years, the station made three controversial rounds of layoffs, totaling 31 positions, in response to a soft economy, but KVIE&#x27;s finances improved despite the recession.

After three years during which KVIE was led by former CBS News executive Van Gordon Sauter, who launched several new TV programs including &quot;California Heartland&quot; and &quot;Central Valley Chronicles&quot;, David Hosley&#x27;s nine-year tenure as general manager was dominated by the construction of digital transmission facilities and the upgrading of the physical plant. Early in his tenure, in July 1999, KVIE managed the highest prime time rating of any public television station in the United States, surpassing KQED in San Francisco, which had attracted the most viewers for seven consecutive years.

David Lowe became KVIE&#x27;s general manager in 2008; at the nadir of the Great Recession, membership fell to 40,000 but had increased to 50,000 by 2018. That year, the station and Lowe received a &quot;Pillar of Public Service&quot; award from America&#x27;s Public Television Stations for testing datacasting of earthquake early warning alerts to businesses and public agencies.

==Local programming==

In addition to PBS programming, KVIE produces in-house programs for distribution locally, regionally and nationwide. Having the widest distribution is &quot;America&#x27;s Heartland&quot;, a program covering agriculture issues nationally that debuted in 2005; this replaced the similarly themed &quot;California Heartland&quot;, which aired for nine seasons.

As the public television station in the state capital, KVIE has also historically produced public affairs programs of statewide interest. Until its cancellation in the early 1980s, the statewide political roundtable &quot;California Week in Review&quot; originated at the station. From 2002 to 2007, it was one of four co-producers of the statewide newsmagazine &quot;California Connected&quot;. More recently, &quot;Inside California Education&quot;, aired statewide, profiles issues facing the state&#x27;s education system.

KVIE&#x27;s local programs include &quot;Viewfinder&quot;, a documentary series; &quot;KVIE Arts Showcase&quot;, an arts magazine; &quot;Rob on the Road&quot;, a series of regional travel profiles; and &quot;Studio Sacramento&quot;, covering public affairs issues in the region.

==Funding==
In fiscal year 2021, KVIE raised $16.75 million in revenue, nearly half of the total coming from membership contributions. Funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting account for 11 percent of revenue.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KVIE ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 53, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to VHF channel 9, using virtual channel 6.

As part of the SAFER Act, KVIE kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

In October 2000, she landed her first regular anime role in &quot;Hiwou War Chronicles&quot;, and in 2001 her recognition received a boost when she starred as the leading role Haruno Kasumi in the NHK anime &quot;Kasumin&quot;.

<doc id="1059971" wikidata="Q1138175" url="?curid=1059971" title="Cowboy hat">
<text>The cowboy hat is a high-crowned, wide-brimmed hat best known as the defining piece of attire for the North American cowboy. Today it is worn by many people, and is particularly associated with ranch workers in the western, midwestern, and southern United States, western Canada and northern Mexico, with many country music, regional Mexican and Sertanejo music performers, and with participants in the North American rodeo circuit. It is recognized around the world as part of traditional Old West apparel.

The cowboy hat as known today has many antecedents to its design, including Mexican hats such as the sombrero, the various designs of wide-brimmed hat worn by farmers and stockmen in the eastern United States, as well as the designs used by the United States Cavalry.

The first western model was the open-crowned &quot;Boss of the Plains&quot;, and after that came the front-creased Carlsbad, destined to become the most prominent cowboy style. The high-crowned, wide-brimmed, soft-felt western hats that followed are intimately associated with the cowboy image.

==History==
Cowboy hats, like the sombreros of Mexico, were designed in response to the demands of the physical environment. The concept of a broad-brimmed hat worn by riders on horseback can be seen as far back as the Greek petasos of two millennia ago and in the Mongolian horsemen of the 13th century. Hats with tall crowns provide insulation, and wide brims provide shade. Hot and sunny climates inspire such tall-crowned, wide-brimmed designs, 

The cowboy hat also known in mexico as the tejana hat originated with mexican vaqueros in texas and the southwest. It is not clear when the cowboy hat received its name. However, European-Americans in the Western United States originally had no standard headwear. People moving West wore many styles of hat, including top hats, bowlers, Civil War headgear such as cavalry and slouch hats, and sailor hats.

According to Lucius Beebe, the bowler was the most widely-worn hat in the American West, prompting him to assert, in contradiction to popular belief, that the bowler, not the cowboy hat, was &quot;the hat that won the West&quot;. The working cowboy wore wide-brimmed and high-crowned hats. The hats were most likely adopted from Civil-War-era slouch hats that were commonly worn by Confederate soldiers who lacked the official uniform and kepi hat of the Confederate army, and may have also been influenced by the Mexican vaqueros before the invention of the modern design. John Batterson Stetson is credited for originating the modern-day American cowboy hat.

The original &quot;Boss of the Plains&quot;, manufactured by Stetson in 1865, was flat-brimmed, had a straight sided crown, with rounded corners. These light-weight, waterproof hats were natural in color, with four-inch crowns and brims. A plain hatband was fitted to adjust head size. The sweatband bore Stetson&#x27;s name. There was only one style of hat, but they were made in different qualities ranging from one-grade material at five dollars apiece to pure beaver felt hats for thirty dollars each. J.B. Stetson was the first to market the &quot;Boss of the Plains&quot; to cowboys, and it has remained the universal image of the American West. The charisma of the West was carried back East when adventurers returned in the expensive &quot;Boss of the Plains&quot;-style hat. In the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, a hat was an indispensable item in every man&#x27;s wardrobe. Stetson focused on expensive, high-quality hats that represented a real investment for the working cowboy and a statement of success for the city dweller.
The cowboy hat has been adopted as a regional identifier among Māori tribes (iwi) living in Gisborne District of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island collectively called &quot;Ngā Kaupoi&quot; (&#x27;the cowboys&#x27;) for their native adoption of horses; one of its resident politicians, Rawiri Waititi, is well known for his hat-donning appearance. Hawaii&#x27;s paniolo wear &quot;papale&quot; woven from pandanus leaves taken directly from the design of the Mexican sombrero.

==Design==

Modern cowboy hats are made of fur-based felt, straw or, less often, leather. They are sold with a tall, rounded crown and a wide flat brim. They have a simple sweat band on the inside to stabilize the fit of the head, and usually a small decorative hat band on the outside of the crown. Hats are customized by creasing the crown and rolling the brim. Hats are also sold pre-creased and pre-rolled. Often a more decorative hat band is added. In some places, &quot;stampede strings&quot; or &quot;wind strings&quot; are also attached. Hats can be manufactured in virtually any color, but are most often seen in shades of beige, brown and black. Beginning in the 1940s, pastel colors were introduced, seen often on hats worn by movie cowboys and rodeo riders. &quot;Today&#x27;s cowboy hat has remained basically unchanged in construction and design since the first one was created in 1865 by J.B. Stetson.&quot;

==Modern designs==

The modern cowboy hat has remained basically unchanged in construction and underlying design since the Stetson creation.
The cowboy hat quickly identified its wearer as someone associated with the West. &quot;Within a decade the name &#x27;John B. Stetson&#x27; became synonymous with the word &#x27;hat&#x27; in every corner and culture west of the Mississippi River.&quot; The shape of the hat&#x27;s crown and brim were often modified by the wearer for fashion and to protect against weather by being softened in hot steam, shaped, and allowed to dry and cool. Because of the ease of personalization, it was often possible to tell where a cowboy hat was from, right down to which ranch, simply by looking at the crease in the crown. Common modern hat creases include the classic Cattleman crease, Cool Hand Luke, Minick, Brick, and the Gus.
Later as the mystique of the Wild West was popularized by entertainers such as Buffalo Bill and western films starring actors such as Tom Mix, the Cowboy hat came to symbolize the American West. John Wayne christened them &quot;the hat that won the West&quot;. The Boss of the Plains design influenced various wide-brimmed hats worn by farmers and ranchers all over the United States. Later designs were customized for law enforcement, military and motion pictures.

The first American law-enforcement agency to adopt Stetson&#x27;s western hat as part of their uniform was the Texas Rangers. The Texas Legislature designated the cowboy hat as the official &quot;State Hat of Texas&quot; in 2015.

== Variations ==
===Ten-gallon hats===
Some cowboy hats have been called &quot;ten-gallon&quot; hats. The term came into use about 1925. There are multiple theories for how the concept arose.

One theory is that the term &quot;ten-gallon&quot; is a corruption of the Spanish modifier , which loosely translates as &quot;really handsome&quot; or &quot;so fine&quot;. For example, &quot;&quot; translates as &quot;such a fine hat&quot;.

Another theory is that the term &quot;ten-gallon&quot; is a corruption of the Spanish term , which means &quot;galloon&quot;, a type of narrow braided trim around the crown, possibly a style adapted by Spanish cowboys. When Texas cowboys misunderstood the word for &quot;gallon&quot;, the popular, though incorrect, legend may have been born. According to Reynolds and Rand, &quot;The term ten-gallon did not originally refer to the holding capacity of the hat, but to the width of a Mexican sombrero hatband, and is more closely related to this unit of measurement by the Spanish than to the water-holding capacity of a Stetson.&quot;

Early print advertising by Stetson showed a cowboy giving his horse a drink of water from a hat. The Stetson company notes that a &quot;ten-gallon&quot; hat (equivalent to ) only holds .

===Calgary White Hat===

The Calgary White Hat is a white felt cowboy hat which is the symbol of both the Calgary Stampede annual rodeo and the city of Calgary. Created by Morris Shumiatcher, owner of Smithbilt Hat Company, it was worn for the first time at the 1946 Stampede. In the early 1950s, Mayor of Calgary Donald Hugh Mackay began presenting the white hat to visiting dignitaries, a tradition that the office of the mayor continues to this day. Thousands of tourists and groups also participate in &quot;white hatting ceremonies&quot; conducted by Tourism Calgary and by volunteer greeters at the Calgary International Airport. In 1983, the Calgary White Hat was incorporated into the design of the flag of Calgary.

<doc id="1059972" wikidata="Q7566078" url="?curid=1059972" title="South Auckland">
<text>South Auckland ( or ) is one of the major geographical regions of Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand. The area is south of the Auckland isthmus, and on the eastern shores of the Manukau Harbour. The area has been populated by Tāmaki Māori since at least the 14th century, and has important archaeological sites, such as the Ōtuataua stonefield gardens at Ihumātao, and Māngere Mountain, a former pā site important to Waiohua tribes.

The area was primarily farmland until the mid-20th century, when the construction of the Auckland Southern Motorway led to major suburban development, and the establishing of Manukau City, which was later amalgamated into Auckland. Large-scale state housing areas were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s, which led to significant Urban Māori and Pasifika communities developing in the area. The presence of 165 different ethnicities makes South Auckland one of the most diverse places in New Zealand but also one of the most socio-economically deprived.

==Definition==

South Auckland is not a strictly defined area. It primarily refers to the western and central parts of the former Manukau City, which existed between 1989 and 2010, and surrounding areas of Franklin. Major areas of South Auckland include Māngere, Manukau, Manurewa, Ōtāhuhu, Ōtara, Papakura and Papatoetoe. A strict definition sometimes used for South Auckland includes just the Māngere-Ōtāhuhu, Manurewa, Ōtara-Papatoetoe, Papakura local board areas.

The term South Auckland was first used in the 1880s, to refer to areas of the southern Auckland Province, such as Cambridge, Ngāruawāhia, Te Awamutu, or Hamilton. The first references to modern South Auckland come from 1962, in discussions for the creation of Manukau City. The term began developing negative connotations in the 1970s, with non-residents associating the term with deprivation, crime and violence. From 1989, many organisations began using the term Counties Manukau as an alternative way to describe South Auckland.

The name South Auckland is often used imprecisely by the press or politicians, to describe lower socio-economic areas south of the Auckland City Centre. Some areas of the Auckland isthmus occasionally referred to as South Auckland are Onehunga, Penrose, Mount Wellington, and Panmure. Some Howick ward suburbs to the east are often called South Auckland, including Flat Bush and East Tāmaki. Towns south of Auckland are also often referred to as South Auckland, including Pukekohe and Waiuku, and occasionally some towns in the northern Waikato Region, such as Pōkeno and Tuakau.

==Natural history==
South Auckland is an area on the eastern shores of the Manukau Harbour, and the upper headwaters of the Tāmaki River. Many features of the Auckland volcanic field are found in South Auckland, such as Māngere Mountain, Matukutūreia and the Pukaki Lagoon. Many of the mountains of South Auckland have been quarried, such as Matukutūruru, Maungataketake and Ōtara Hill (either entirely or partially). Some of the northern-most features of the older South Auckland volcanic field can be found in the area, such as Pukekiwiriki and the Hūnua Falls.

Both the Manukau Harbour and the Tāmaki River are drowned river valley systems. The Manukau Harbour formed between 3 and 5 million years ago when tectonic forces between the Pacific Plate and Australian Plate uplifted the Waitākere Ranges and subsided the Manukau Harbour. It began as an open bay, eventually forming as a sheltered harbour as the Āwhitu Peninsula developed at the harbour&#x27;s mouth. Over the last two million years, the harbour has cycled between periods of being a forested river valley and a flooded harbour, depending on changes in the global sea level. The present harbour formed approximately 8,000 years ago, after the Last Glacial Maximum.

Historically, much of inland South Auckland was composed of wetlands. Many areas of remnant native bush are found in South Auckland, such as the taraire forest at Kirks Bush in Papakura, and areas of the Auckland Botanic Gardens in Manurewa.

==History==
===Early Māori history===
The Auckland area was an early location visited by many of the Māori migration canoes, including the &quot;Matahourua&quot;, &quot;Aotea&quot;, &quot;Mātaatua&quot;, &quot;Tainui&quot;, &quot;Tākitimu&quot;, &quot;Tokomaru&quot;, &quot;Te Wakatūwhenua&quot; and &quot;Moekākara&quot; waka. Some of the earliest stories about the region involve Te Tō Waka, the portage at Ōtāhuhu, that allowed waka to cross between the east coast and the Manukau Harbour, where only 200 metres of land separated the two. The crossing of the &quot;Tainui&quot; waka is memorialised in the name of Ngarango Otainui Island in the Māngere Inlet, where the wooden skids used to haul the waka were left after the trip was made, and other waka including the &quot;Matahourua&quot;, &quot;Aotea&quot;, &quot;Mātaatua&quot; and &quot;Tokomaru&quot; all have traditional stories associated with the portage.

Portages remained important features Tāmaki Māori. In South Auckland, the Waokauri and Pūkaki portages at Papatoetoe was used to avoid Te Tō Waka, controlled by the people who lived at Ōtāhuhu / Mount Richmond. The Papakura portage connected the Manukau Harbour at Papakura in the west to the Wairoa River in the east, likely along the path of the Old Wairoa Road, and Te Pai o Kaiwaka at Waiuku connected the Manukau Harbour to the Waikato River in the south.

Tāmaki Māori peoples settled the eastern coastline of the Manukau Harbour as early as the 14th century. Settlements in the area were based on what resources were available seasonally, such as Manukau Harbour fish and shellfish.

In the 15th century, Tāmaki Māori people created extensive garden sites at Ihumātao, Wiri and the slopes of Māngere Mountain. These garden sites used Polynesian agricultural techniques and traditions, with the stone walls acting acted as boundaries, windbreaks and drainage systems for the crops grown in the area, which included kūmara (sweet potato), hue (calabash gourds), taro, uwhi (ube yam), tī pore (Pacific cabbage tree) and aute (the paper mulberry tree). The environment-modifying techniques used in the Ōtuataua Stonefields allowed early Tāmaki Māori to propagate crops which were not suited to a cooler climate.

A number of early Tāmaki Māori iwi and hapū are associated with South Auckland. Ngā Oho was used as a unifying name for Tāmaki Māori who descended from the &quot;Tainui&quot; and &quot;Te Arawa&quot; migratory waka. Descendants of Tāhuhunui-o-te-rangi, captain of the &quot;Moekākara&quot; waka, settled around Ōtāhuhu and adopted the name Ngāi Tāhuhu, while descendants of Tāiki, a Tainui ancestor of Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, named the Tāmaki River after himself (Te Wai ō Tāiki) and settled on the eastern shores of the river alongside the descendants of Huiārangi (of the early iwi Te Tini ō Maruiwi), including the shores of Te Waiōtara (the Ōtara Creek). Over time, Ngā Riki emerged as a group who settled between Ōtāhuhu and Papakura, and Ngā Oho was used to describe the people who lived around Papakura.

Many of the volcanic features of South Auckland became fortified pā sites for Tāmaki Māori, notably Māngere Mountain, Matukutūruru, Matukutūreia and Pukekiwiriki. There are few pā sites inland from the coasts, due to the flat land being unsuitable for fortified sites. The pā is known by the name Te Pā-o-te-tū-tahi-atu, a name that describes the pā as temporary, due to the surrounding flat landscape not being ideal for fortifications.

In the early 17th century, the area became a part of the rohe of Te Kawerau ā Maki.

===Waiohua===

In the 17th century, three major tribes of Tāmaki Makaurau, Ngā Iwi, Ngā Oho and Ngā Riki, joined to form the Waiohua under the rangatira Huakaiwaka. The union lasted for three generations, and was centred around the pā of Maungawhau and later Maungakiekie on the Auckland isthmus. Other Tāmaki Māori groups such as Ngāi Tāhuhu were considered either allies of Waiohua, or hapū within the union.

Māngere Mountain / Te Pane-o-Mataaho / Te Ara Pueru was a major pā for the Waiohua, a confederacy of Tāmaki Māori iwi. The mountain complex may have been home to thousands of people, with the mountain acting as a central place for rua (food storage pits). Paramount chief Kiwi Tāmaki stayed at Māngere seasonally, when it was the time of year to hunt sharks in the Manukau Harbour. To the south, the twin peaks of Matukutūreia and Matukutūruru were home to the Ngāi Huatau hapū of Waiohua, settled by Huatau, daughter of Huakaiwaka.

Around the year 1740, a conflict between Ngāti Whātua and Waiohua led to the death of paramount chief Kiwi Tāmaki, who became the major occupants of the Tāmaki isthmus and Māngere. Ngāti Whātua was significantly smaller than the Waiohua confederation and chose to focus life at Onehunga, Māngere and Ōrākei. Gradually, the Waiohua people who had sought refuge with their Waikato Tainui relatives to the south, re-established in the South Auckland area, mainly in a disbursed circuit around the Manukau Harbour. During this time, the tribal identities of Te Ākitai Waiohua, Ngāti Tamaoho and Ngāti Te Ata Waiohua developed. Ngāti Whātua people who remained in the area and interwed with Waiohua developed into the modern iwi Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei. By the 19th century, most Tāmaki Māori peoples moved away from fortified pā and favoured kāinga closer to resources and transport routes.

In the 1820s, the threat of Ngāpuhi war parties from the north during the Musket Wars caused most of the Tāmaki Makaurau area to become deserted. Ngāti Whatua and Waiohua relocated to the Waikato under the protection of Pōtatau Te Wherowhero. A peace accord between Ngāpuhi and Waikato Tainui was reached through the marriage of Matire Toha, daughter of Ngāpuhi chief Rewa was married to Kati Takiwaru, the younger brother of Tainui chief Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, who settled together on the slopes of Māngere Mountain. Ngāti Whātua returned to the Māngere-Onehunga area by the mid-1830s, re-establishing a pā on Māngere Mountain called Whakarongo. During the 1840s, Waiohua descendant tribes returned to their papakāinga (settlements) at Ihumātao, Pūkaki, Papahīnau, Waimāhia and Te Aparangi. Māngere-Onehunga was the main residence of Auckland-based Ngāti Whātua until the 1840s.

===Colonial era===

In January 1836 missionary William Thomas Fairburn brokered a land sale between Tāmaki Māori chiefs, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero and Turia of Ngāti Te Rau, covering the majority of modern-day South Auckland between Ōtāhuhu and Papakura. The sale was envisioned as a way to end hostilities in the area, but it is unclear what the chiefs understood or consented to. Māori continued to live in South Auckland, unchanged by this sale. The Fairburn Purchase was criticised for the sheer size of the purchase, and in 1842 the Crown significantly reduced the size of his land holdings, and the Crown partitioned much of the land for European settlers.

On 20 March 1840, Ngāti Whātua chief Apihai Te Kawau signed the Treaty of Waitangi at Orua Bay on the Manukau Harbour, inviting Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson to settle in Auckland, hoping this would protect the land and people living in Tāmaki Makaurau. In the winter of 1840, Ngāti Whātua moved the majority of the iwi to the Waitematā Harbour, with most iwi members resettling to the Remuera-Ōrākei area, closer to the new European settlement at Waihorotiu (modern-day Auckland City Centre). A smaller Ngāti Whātua presence remained at Māngere-Onehunga.

In 1846, the Wesleyan Methodist Church established a mission at the foot of Maungataketake, near Ihumātao. The following year, Governor George Grey established the village of Ōtāhuhu. The village was created as a way to protect the township of Auckland, and was settled by retired British soldiers of the Royal New Zealand Fencible Corps. Grey also asked Pōtatau Te Wherowhero (then known as a powerful chief and negotiator, but later the first Māori King) to settle at Māngere Bridge as a second defensive site, which developed into a Ngāti Mahuta village. Papakura was established in the late 1840s by a small group of settler families.

The South Auckland area flourished in the 1850s, when Manukau Harbour and Waikato tribes produced goods to sell or barter at the port of Onehunga, primarily corn, potato, kūmara, pigs, peaches, melons, fish and potatoes. Ōtāhuhu developed as an agricultural centre and trade hub, with the Tāmaki River becoming one of the busiest waterways in New Zealand by the late 1850s.

In April 1851, the Tāmaki Bridge was constructed along the Great South Road, spurring growth in the Papatoetoe area. By 1855, the Great South Road was extended as far south as Drury. Coal mining became a major industry in Drury during this time, and in 1862 one of the first tramways in New Zealand was constructed to transport coal from the mine to the Manukau Harbour.

====Invasion of the Waikato====

In 1861, Governor George Grey ordered the construction of the Great South Road further into the Waikato, due to fears of potential invasion of Waikato Tainui. On 9 July 1863, due to fears of the Māori King Movement, Governor Grey proclaimed that all Māori living in the South Auckland area needed to swear loyalty to the Queen and give up their weapons. Most people refused due to strong links to Tainui, leaving for the south before the Government&#x27;s Invasion of the Waikato. Small numbers of people remained, in order to tend to their farms and for ahi kā (land rights through continued occupation). Most Māori occupants of the area felt they had no choice due to their strong ties to Tainui and Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, and were forced to flee to the south. While fleeing, Te Ākitai Waiohua rangatira Ihaka Takanini and his family were captured by his former neighbour, Lieutenant-Colonel Marmaduke Nixon, and taken prisoner on Rakino Island, where Ihaka Takanini died.

During the war, many stockades and redoubts were constructed by the Crown troops. This included St John&#x27;s Redoubt on Great South Road, constructed in order to secure the supply line for troops and in operation until 1864. Early skirmishes between the Crown and Kīngitanga forces happened in the forested land around Drury and Pukekohe areas, including the Defence of Pukekohe East in September 1863.

After the war, the Crown confiscated 1.2 million acres of Māori land around the Waikato, including Waiohua land in South Auckland. The former residents of the Manukau Harbour began returning to the area in 1866, with the Native Compensation Court returning small portions of land in 1867. Most land was kept by the crown as reserves, or sold on to British immigrant farmers.

===Farming communities===
Small farming communities such as began developing in the area in the latter 19th century along the Great South Road corridor. In 1875, the North Island Main Trunk began operating in South Auckland, linking the South Auckland area to Auckland and the Waikato by train, and leading to development along this corridor. The first Māngere Bridge was opened in 1875, linking Māngere to Onehunga. The township of Woodside in modern-day Wiri dwindled in importance after the railway opened, slowly being overtaken by neighbouring Manurewa. Much of South Auckland was known for wheat production, until the 1880s when dairy farming became popular.

The first local governments in the area, were established in the 1860s in order to better fund roading projects. During the 1890s, the wetlands of South Auckland were a major location for kauri gum digging. Papakura township was adjacent to the large Ardmore Gumfield (also known as the Papakura Gumfield), which stretched from Manurewa to Clevedon. By the 1900s, Auckland gumfields and swamps began being converted into farmland and orchards. In 1890, the Māori King, Tāwhiao, had a residence constructed for his family members at Māngere Bridge, where members of the family including Mahuta Tāwhiao, Tumate Mahuta and Tonga Mahuta stayed while attending schools in Auckland.

The first Chinese New Zealanders arrived in South Auckland in the 1910s, Between the 1920s and 1940s, significant portions of South Auckland were used for Chinese-owned and operated market gardens. In 1911, the first controlled powered flight in New Zealand took place in Takanini. The flight took place inside a single paddock within the racecourse of the now-defunct Papakura Racing Club. The flight was piloted by Vivian Walsh and was carried out in a Howard Wright 1910 Biplane, the parts for which were imported from England in 1910 and assembled by members of the Auckland Aeroplane Syndicate.

During the 1920s, Papatoetoe and Manurewa became some of the fastest growing areas of Auckland. These were joined by Māngere East, which developed after the opening of the Otahuhu Railway Workshops in the late 1920s. During World War II, the Papakura Military Camp was established as an important base for the New Zealand Army. Areas of Papatoetoe and Manurewa were used as military camps for the United States Army. Middlemore Hospital opened in 1947, originally intended to be a temporary military hospital.

In the 1950s, Chinese New Zealand gardeners Fay Gock and Joe Gock began cultivating kūmara (sweet potatoes) at their farm beside Pukaki Creek, using plants donated to them by their neighbours at Pūkaki Marae. The Gocks developed a disease-resistant variety of kūmara that became the modern Owairaka Red variety.

===Suburban development===
The development of the Auckland Southern Motorway in the mid-1950s led to an explosion in the population of Papatoetoe and Manurewa. In 1958, the first modern supermarket in New Zealand was opened in Papatoetoe, by Tom Ah Chee, Norm Kent and John Brown, and in 1967 the third American-style mall in Auckland was opened, Southmall Manurewa.

In 1960, the Manukau Sewage Purification Works (now Māngere Wastewater Treatment Plant) was opened in the Manukau Harbour, using algae-based oxidation ponds, around Puketutu Island. A new purpose-built Auckland Airport was opened in Māngere 1966 to replace the dual commercial and military airport at Whenuapai. The construction of the airport led to significant reclamation of the Manukau Harbour, and the volcanic scoria of Maungataketake and Puketutu Island was quarried for construction material.

South Auckland&#x27;s demographics rapidly changed from the 1950s to the 1970s. Between the 1940s and 1960s, Māori living in rural areas were encouraged to move to cities by the Māori Affairs Department, in order to create a larger industrial labour force. Urban Māori populations first settled in the inner suburbs of Auckland and areas close to factories; often areas with poor housing. To counter overcrowding in the central suburbs, the New Zealand Government undertook large scale state housing developments, creating planned suburbs in Ōtara and Māngere in the 1970s, and adding large areas of state housing around Manurewa and Papatoetoe. Large-scale immigration of Pasifika New Zealanders began in the 1950s and 1960s, typically from primarily from Western Samoa (modern-day Samoa), Tonga, the Cook Islands and Niue. By the mid-1970s, gentrification caused many Pasifika communities to relocate away from the central suburbs, moving to areas such as South Auckland.

In 1965, Manukau City was formed by the amalgamation of the Manurewa Borough and Manukau County. The new city decided to create a new commercial and administrative centre, leading to the development of Manukau in a previously rural area between Manurewa and Papatoetoe. After the construction of Manukau, South Auckland from Ōtāhuhu to Papakura became a continuous part of the urban sprawl of Auckland.

In the mid-1970s, construction on State Highway 20 (commonly known as the Southwestern Motorway) began in South Auckland, including a new motorway bridge to be built alongside the existing Māngere Bridge. Construction was halted by May 1978, when workers organised a labour strike over insufficient redundancy payments. The partially constructed bridge was picketed for a period of two and a half years, becoming the longest continuous labour strike in the history of New Zealand. The Auckland Botanic Gardens opened in Manurewa in 1982, the same year as, Rainbow&#x27;s End a theme park in Manukau. Over time, Rainbow&#x27;s End expanded to become the largest theme park in New Zealand.

In the 1989 local government reforms, Manukau, Papatoetoe and Howick in East Auckland amalgamated into the Manukau City, and in 2010 all areas of the Auckland Region were merged into a single unitary body, administered by Auckland Council. By the 2010s, areas of South Auckland such as Papatoetoe had developed as major areas for South Asian communities.

Between 2016 and 2020, Ihumātao was occupied by protesters, who were concerned at the construction of a housing development on the archaeological site, and called for the land to be returned to mana whenua. In late 2020, the New Zealand Government purchased the site, with no decision being made on the future of the land.

Areas south of Papakura began developing into new suburban housing in the late 2010s. The first of these was Paerata Rise north of Pukekohe, joined by Auranga, an area of coastal Karaka. A major development is planned for the Drury-Ōpaheke area, to be developed in stages from the 2020s through to the 2050s. Three new train stations will be constructed in the area between Papakura and Pukekohe. In the 2010s, a light rail line was proposed to link the Auckland City Centre to Māngere. In the 2040s, the Auckland Council plans to create a new regional park on Puketutu Island. Much of the island was quarried in the 1950s, and is slowly being refilled with biosolids. At the end of this process, the quarried peaks will be reformed.

==Politics and governance==
=== Local government ===
Road boards were the first local government in South Auckland in the 1860s, which were established across the Auckland Province due to a lack of central government funding for road improvements. In South Auckland, over 20 road boards were established to administer upkeep for major arterial connections, some of which included the Drury Road Board, Mangere Road Board, Awhitu Road Board and the Hunua Road Board. In 1876, the Manukau County was established as the local government for South Auckland. In 1881, the Town District Act allowed communities of more than 50 households to amalgamate into a town district. Large town districts were able to form boroughs, which had their own councils and a greater lending power. The county was split into two bodies in 1912: the Manukau County Council and a new body, the Franklin County Council. Between 1912 and 1955, seven areas of South Auckland split from the Manukau, Franklin or Eden Counties to form independent boroughs: Pukekohe and Ōtāhuhu in 1912, Manurewa in 1937, Papakura in 1938, Papatoetoe in 1946 and Waiuku and Tuakau in 1955.

In the early 1960s, a movement began to amalgamate the various town and borough councils in South Auckland into a single city, which became known as the Manukau City. Churchill was an early name proposed for the city, which was disparaged at the time. The city formed in 1965, and later that year was joined by Papatoetoe City, after the Papatoetoe borough grew in population. Papakura became recognised as a city in 1975, and in 1986 Ōtāhuhu joined with Mount Wellington to form a unified city, known as Tamaki City. With the 1989 local government reforms, Manukau, Papatoetoe and Howick in East Auckland merged to form a larger Manukau City, while Tamaki City was amalgamated into Auckland City along with the rest of the Auckland isthmus.

On 1 November 2010, Manukau City and Franklin District were merged with the surrounding areas of Auckland to form a single local government area, managed by the Auckland Council as a unitary authority. Within the new system, South Auckland was primarily split into five areas which elect a local board: Māngere-Ōtāhuhu, Manurewa, Ōtara-Papatoetoe, Papakura and Franklin. Ōtāhuhu, previously administered by the Auckland City to the north, was again a part of a South Auckland local government body, and a number of southern and eastern townships within the former Franklin District became part of the Waikato and the Hauraki districts in the Waikato Region, including Tuakau, Pōkeno, Pukekawa, Whakatīwai and Pūkorokoro / Miranda.

In addition to local boards, a number of councillors represent South Auckland on the Auckland Council. Voters in the Māngere-Ōtāhuhu and Ōtara-Papatoetoe areas vote for two councillors as a part of the Manukau ward, and people in the Manurewa and Papakura areas vote for two Manurewa-Papakura ward councillors. Franklin area residents vote for a single Franklin ward councillor.

===National government===
Traditionally, South Auckland has strongly supported the Labour Party in general elections. Notably, the general electorates of Māngere, Panmure-Ōtāhuhu and Manurewa are three of Labour&#x27;s safest seats. However, after the 2023 election, Labour lost the electorate of Takanini which is considered to be a marginal seat.

==Notable people==
People who hail from South Auckland include Olympic champion John Walker, mountaineer Edmund Hillary, and former Prime Minister David Lange. Many successful sportspeople are South Aucklanders, including rugby players Jonah Lomu and Eric Rush, rugby league player Ruben Wiki, heavyweight boxers David Tua and Joseph Parker, cricketer Daryl Tuffey, kickboxer Mark Hunt, indycar racer Scott Dixon, and shot-putter Valerie Adams. Prominent entertainers from South Auckland include musicians Young Sid, Savage, Pauly Fuemana, and P-Money.

<text>The Wonderboom Nature Reserve () is a 1 km², 200-hectare reserve that incorporates a section of the Magaliesberg range in the northern portion of the Pretoria metropole, South Africa. Its main attractions are the &quot;Wonderboom&quot; (Afrikaans for &quot;Marvel tree&quot;) near the reserve entrance in Lavender street and the derelict Fort Wonderboompoort on the crest of the Magaliesberg, that was constructed towards the end of the nineteenth century, during the Second Boer War. The latter is reached by following the steep, paved walkway that leads from the picnic area to the summit. The vicinity of the fort ruins also afford sweeping views of the city, whose council declared the area around the &quot;Wonderboom&quot; and both banks of the Apies River a reserve on 28 December 1949.

==Wonderboom==

The well-known &#x27;Wonderboom&#x27; (Afrikaans: &#x27;Wonder tree&#x27;) is a dense grove of parent and daughter trees of the species &quot;Ficus salicifolia&quot;, that descended from a central bole of about a thousand years old. It is situated at the northern base of the Magaliesberg, and two circular walkways currently protect it from pedestrian traffic around its trunk and roots. As it has grown, its outlying branches have rooted themselves around the parent tree. This has repeated until there are now three layers of daughter trees encircling the mother fig, with thirteen distinct trunks, covering a 50m² (1.5 ha) area. The mother trunk is 4 m in circumference and 20 m high. Apart from its unusual height for a wild tree of this species, its method of reproduction is a rare natural phenomenon.

The tree was so remarkable that the original inhabitants of the Magaliesberge considered it sacred, especially after a chieftain was buried there. In August 1836, Hendrik Potgieter and his fellow Voortrekkers passing through and gave the tree its name. Later, other Trekkers pitched their tent there, making it a notable landmark in Afrikaner history. For many years, the Day of the Vow was celebrated in its shade.

Until part of the original tree burned in an 1870 fire, a thousand people could sit in the tree&#x27;s shade. According to records, the tree was also large enough to leave in its shadow twenty-two ox-wagons with twenty oxen in front of each.

The tree was placed under quarantine in 1985 after it was afflicted by a fungal disease, and then fenced to prevent it from spreading. Once the fungus was eradicated, the quarantine was lifted in 2003.

==Other features==
Other features of the Wonderboom Nature Reserve include a Stone-Age site that has produced the largest single accumulation of Neolithic tools ever found in South Africa and an Iron-Age site. Larger game species such as impala and zebra roam the reserve, as do monkeys, and a breeding pair of black eagles have raised chicks in the reserve since 2010, feeding on the rock hyraxes living in caves on the banks of the Apies.

== Hours==
The reserve has picnic areas and can be visited between 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM (exit only after 4:00 PM)

== Biodiversity ==

=== Birds ===
There are at least 200 species of birds, including:
=== Fauna ===
=== Flora ===

<text>Sun Zhiwei (, born October 16, 1965) is a Chinese mathematician, working primarily in number theory, combinatorics, and group theory. He is a professor at Nanjing University.

==Biography==
Sun Zhiwei was born in Huai&#x27;an, Jiangsu. Sun and his twin brother Sun Zhihong proved a theorem about what are now known as the Wall–Sun–Sun primes.

Sun proved Sun&#x27;s curious identity in 2002. In 2003, he presented a unified approach to three topics of Paul Erdős in combinatorial number theory: covering systems, restricted sumsets, and zero-sum problems or EGZ Theorem.

With Stephen Redmond, he posed the Redmond–Sun conjecture in 2006.

In 2013, he published a paper containing many conjectures on primes, one of which states that for any positive integer formula_1 there are consecutive primes formula_2 not exceeding formula_3 such that formula_4, where formula_5 denotes the formula_6-th prime.

He is the Editor-in-Chief of the &quot;Journal of Combinatorics and Number Theory&quot;.

<text>Sir Dove-Myer Robinson (15 June 1901 – 14 August 1989) was Mayor of Auckland City from 1959 to 1965 and from 1968 to 1980. Holding office for 6,543 days in total (17 years, 10 months, and 30 days), his was the longest tenure of any holder of the office. He was a colourful character and became affectionately known across New Zealand as &quot;Robbie&quot;. He was one of several Jewish mayors of Auckland, although he rejected Judaism as a teenager and became a lifelong atheist. He has been described as a &quot;slight, bespectacled man whose tiny stature was offset by a booming voice and massive ego&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born Mayer Dove Robinson in Sheffield, England, he was the sixth of seven children of Ida Brown and Moss Robinson. While his father described himself as a master jeweller, he actually sold trinkets and second-hand furniture, and the family was poor and often on the move. Robinson&#x27;s mother influenced his upbringing by transmitting the strict values her rabbi father had taught her. His Jewish heritage ensured that he was often targeted by antisemitic violence in the schools he attended. The family moved to New Zealand in 1914, where his father worked as a pawnbroker. Dove-Myer, as he later called himself (ignoring his Robinson family name), found New Zealand agreeable and lacking in the intermittent persecutions he had previously faced.

Robinson began working as a travelling salesman, selling motorcycles. In Gore he met Adelaide (Adele) Elizabeth Matthews, the first of his four wives and on 12 September 1924 the two married, having two daughters. The pair divorced in 1932. He established Robinson&#x27;s Motor Cycle and Bicycle Depot in 1930, but the business struggled as a result of the Great Depression, expanding to include cars. He married Veda Alice Davis, a 17-year-old, on 7 December 1937. The marriage only lasted a month and in 1940 they divorced. Robinson had begun living with Bettine (Betty) Williams, a seamstress, and on 15 March 1941 they married and had two daughters and one son. He raced motorcycles as well as selling them and for a time he was a sidecar racing champion. He held the World 500cc Speedway title in 1936. His racing injuries (and impaired eyesight) excused him from military service in World War II. During and after the war he and Betty focused on creating their own company, Childswear Ltd, into a prosperous clothes manufacturing business.

===Political activism===

Robinson entered politics in the late 1940s when he led the opposition to a sewage dumping scheme championed by Auckland Mayor Sir John Allum (the Browns Island plan) that would have discharged untreated effluent into Waitemata Harbour. Robinson joined the Auckland and Suburban Drainage League, a group opposed to the idea of disposing Auckland&#x27;s sewage and slaughterhouse waste into the harbour and intent on finding an alternative. Robinson&#x27;s first attempt saw him take a petition containing 43,000 signatures to Parliament to try to convince the government to block the plan, but was unsuccessful.

Allum dismissed Robinson labeling him as a &quot;noisy crank&quot; and disliked the challenge to his authority. Graham Bush, an Auckland historian, later termed the clash between Allum and Robinson as one &quot;between two men of steely character who ... deserve being ranked among the half-dozen greatest men in Auckland municipal history&quot;.

When a vacancy occurred on the Auckland City Council in 1952 Robinson stood as an independent candidate in the subsequent by-election. He used the publicity he had gained in his fight against Browns Island to stand out from the crowd and won the election. It was the first victory for an independent candidate in an Auckland City election since 1935. Now as a council member he was appointed as a council representative on the Auckland Drainage Board, the body proposing the Browns Island plan, and opposed it from within.

To try to break the deadlock, Robinson formed a new political party, the United Independents, and at the 1953 elections the new group won five seats (including Robinson) giving them the balance of power between the Citizens &amp; Ratepayers and Labour Party tickets. They also endorsed the candidacy for mayor of John Luxford, who defeated Allum. With Allum removed from the council (and by extension the Drainage Board), Robinson assumed chairmanship of the Drainage Board. There, he proposed and eventually realised a scheme to break down the sewage in oxidation ponds (&#x27;Robbie&#x27;s ponds&#x27;) near the Manukau Harbour. Browns Island instead became a public reserve. His success in the scheme earned Robinson a reputation as a visionary later on helped him gain the popularity to be elected Mayor of Auckland City.

Robinson had established a public profile during his lengthy political struggle against the Browns Island plan, but it took a toll on his private life. His third marriage ended and he divorced Betty in 1959. On 15 June that same year he married Thelma Thompson, an executive at Childswear Ltd, with whom he had one daughter.

===Mayor of Auckland City===

====First term as mayor====

In 1959, campaigning on a populist platform as &quot;Robbie&quot; he defeated the incumbent Citizens &amp; Ratepayers mayor Keith Buttle which caused much resentment. A hallmark of Robinson&#x27;s first two terms as mayor was the perpetual animosity between himself and the Citizens &amp; Ratepayers councillors, who despised Robinson&#x27;s popularity, working-class origins and social conduct. Robinson was also infamously known for walking from his home in Remuera to work at the town hall shirtless, often media cameras in tow.

Robinson&#x27;s main drive in his first period as mayor was a proposed merging of the 32 separate city, borough and county councils in greater Auckland into a regional authority that could collectively decide on issues of regional importance. He won over smaller councils (who mostly opposed the reforms) and exploited Parliamentary recommendations for compulsory council amalgamations to forge the issue ahead successfully on condition that the existing councils were left intact. After being re-elected in 1962, the Auckland Regional Authority (ARA) was established in 1963 and Robinson was chosen as its founding chairman.

Robinson described 1965 as his &quot;annus horribilis&quot;. He had a very public break-up with his fourth wife Thelma (who only wanted two terms as mayoress), he lost the 1965 mayoral election by 1,134 votes to Citizens &amp; Ratepayers candidate Roy McElroy and despite being re-elected to the ARA, he was denied any chairman responsibilities. He endured a three-year political hiatus and was now a single parent.

====Second term as mayor====
In 1968 he in turn defeated McElroy by 5,972 votes becoming the first Mayor of Auckland to serve non-consecutive terms. His niece, Barbara Goodman, became his mayoress for the rest of his time as mayor. He cultivated a more constructive relationship with the newer Citizens &amp; Ratepayers councillors, most of whom were uninvolved in the feuding of previous council terms and more appreciative of Robinson&#x27;s role in the Browns Island affair. He was again returned to the ARA where he was appointed to the transit committee.

Robinson&#x27;s main focus during his second period as mayor was his advocacy for rapid transit system for Auckland. Robinson&#x27;s proposal for a bus-rail rapid transit plan was &quot;to provide fast, modern electrified railways through the main traffic corridors of the region&quot;. The proposal had passenger trains every three minutes running from an underground subway terminal in the city centre with above ground tracks leading to Howick, Auckland Airport and a tunnel to the North Shore. The scheme was heavily criticised for its cost (an estimated $273 million in 1973) and both the ARA chairman Tom Pearce and most of its members opposed the scheme. The Third Labour Government reneged on an election pledge to pay for the scheme and the rapid rail proposal disappeared. Retrospectively, Robinson&#x27;s idea to implement rapid rail was seen as a possible long-term solution to Auckland&#x27;s subsequent transportation difficulties. The phrase; &quot;If we&#x27;d only listened to Robbie...&quot; has become common speech in Auckland whenever the city&#x27;s transport system is debated.

During his career, Robinson also became involved in the incipient movement of Green politics, particularly the anti-nuclear movement, and supported the Third Labour Government&#x27;s opposition to French nuclear testing in the Pacific. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1970 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for outstanding services as mayor of Auckland. Robinson&#x27;s influence declined in the 1970s and after his 1977 election victory he promised not to run again. However, he recanted and stood again in 1980, but his age was against him and he lost to Colin Kay.

===Later life and death===
Robinson was loath to retire and twice attempted to re-enter politics. He stood for mayor again in 1983 but finished a distant fourth. At the 1986 local-body elections he was a candidate for a council seat in the Remuera ward but was unsuccessful.

Strained relationships with most of his children caused his unintentional retirement to be a lonely one. His niece, Dame Barbara Goodman told papers on his death &quot;I think he did much better in his relationship with the public than in his private relationships&quot;. Robinson lived out his remaining years in a retirement village in Auckland until his death on 14 August 1989, survived by his six children. A civic funeral was held for him at the Auckland Town Hall with a secular service led by Reverend Selwyn Dawson (a former councillor).

==Legacy==

Robinson has been described as one of New Zealand&#x27;s most popular and colourful politicians, politically independent, rationalist, environmentalist and alternative medicine advocate. In 1983 John Roberts, a Professor of Political Studies, commented on Robinson&#x27;s charisma:

Dame Barbara Goodman, former Auckland Mayoress and councillor, was his niece, and spearheaded a campaign for the Auckland City Council to build a statue of him in Aotea Square; the statue was completed in 2002. Dove Myer Robinson Park, formerly the Parnell Rose Gardens, was named after him. The park was where previous mayor John Logan Campbell once lived.

<doc id="1060004" wikidata="Q2273472" url="?curid=1060004" title="Nobuyuki Hiyama">
<text>is a Japanese voice actor, narrator, and radio personality currently affiliated with Arts Vision.

His vocal register is described as a metallic lyric tenor suitable to voice a mature variation of coming of age young men. Combined with an impactful execution on battle cries, he earned his reputation in voicing heroic protagonists commonly found in works of the mecha, fighting, and fantasy genres. Hiyama is recognized for his portrayal of Hiei from &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, by starring twice within the Brave Series franchise as Maito Senpuuji of &quot;The Brave Express Might Gaine&quot;, and Gai Shishioh of the &quot;King of Braves GaoGaiGar&quot;. He also played Link in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;.

==Biography==
Hiyama was born in Hatsukaichi, Hiroshima at the Red Cross Hospital, and grew up enjoying casual amateur baseball with friends. His mother was of Japanese descent born in Taiwan during the end of World War II who resettled back to Japan after the war.

Greatly influenced by his father, Hiyama flourished in history and social studies class since middle school, but wasn&#x27;t fond of the idea of participating in extracurricular activities; yet Hiyama had no choice but to pick up at least one activity for each semester due to school regulations, and ends up wandering through Go, Shogi, and his school&#x27;s Radio Club by his second-year middle school. According to Hiyama, his middle school radio club experience was &quot;in all honesty, awful.&quot; and &quot;was bored to the point of resigning from the club&quot; by his 3rd year and end his middle school club life with Japanese calligraphy.

Upon entering high school, Hiyama believed he could &quot;finally start pursuing his dream of not participating in any school clubs,&quot; but ends up being reluctantly dragged into his high school&#x27;s radio club due to a close schoolmate of his wanting to join the club yet doesn&#x27;t want to enter the club alone. Hiyama noted his high school radio club experience was &quot;far more interesting&quot; than he expected, &quot;we get to plan on what to broadcast for morning assembly, and not only that, we even produce our own radio dramas.&quot; It was through his interest in radio dramas, along with the awareness of the voice acting boom of the 70s and 80s that made Hiyama took notion early on that there were career opportunities in voice acting and that Tokyo has the training schools for them.

When the time came for Hiyama to plan his career development during his senior year of high school, he resorted to the mindset of &quot;if I had to bread-win, might as well choose the type of bread that I love to eat.&quot; Therefore, his first choice was to apply for college to become a historian, while his second choice was to go into &quot;something in relation to voice work,&quot; since he reflected how his radio club experience was the one that made him believe this will be the lifestyle that he would truly enjoy. Due to the tough application requirements of his intended history major, Hiyama decided to pursue the path of voice acting, and talked it over with his parents. Hiyama recalled their discussion &quot;ended in dispute,&quot; with his parents&#x27; decision to not support his tuition in fear of &quot;a business that is unheard of.&quot; Hiyama was then left to fend for himself by enrolling into Tokyo Announce Gakuin&#x27;s (now Tokyo Announce Gakuin Performing Arts College) Broadcasting Voice Actor major through Japan&#x27;s Newspaper Scholarship grant.

===Training and Debut===
Due to the lack of financial support from his parents, Hiyama took on his major&#x27;s scholarship recipient training course to make room in fulfilling his required deeds to give back to his scholarship sponsors, and meeting his basic needs in Tokyo by part-timing at newsagencies delivering newspapers around his neighborhood while his tuition was covered by his grant. His daily routine was consisted of a &quot;grueling 3:00am to 9:00pm schedule&quot; between work and voice acting studies which &quot;really grinded his mentality and physicality.&quot;

Upon his graduation from Tokyo Announce Gakuin, Hiyama continued his performance training under his alma mater&#x27;s homeroom instructor via Arts Vision&#x27;s Nihon Narration Engi Kenkyujyo (Japan Narration Performing Arts Research Center), and was scouted by Arts Vision&#x27;s group of managers while he was rehearsing for his first stage performance.

Debuted as a Mummy in the OVA version of the original &quot;Kaiketsu Zorori&quot; anime in 1989, Hiyama spent most of his beginner years continued to deliver newspapers, while also continued his performance training whenever he did not receive voice-acting cases to work. He also noted to have part-timed as a security guard for a short while, and mentioned how he deliberately hid his face in case his colleagues spot him out during a period where he has to overlook a construction site near his recording studio.

===Career Breakthrough===
Hiyama received his first official role as the principal villain character, Syndrome in &quot;Chikyuu SOS Soreike Kororin&quot;, a 1992 environmentalist anime television program spanning a half-year recording schedule. With his &quot;Kororin&quot; gig ending and worrying where his next paycheck will be, he received his agency&#x27;s call to audition for &quot;YuYu Hakusho.&quot; According to his commentary within &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&#x27;s&quot; Blu-ray release, he first auditioned solely for the role of Kurama, he then tried again for Hiei upon receiving the notice for &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&#x27;s&quot; second round of audition, with the latter becoming his most iconic breakthrough character.

<doc id="1060007" wikidata="Q2126332" url="?curid=1060007" title="Radio Sawa">
<text>Radio Sawa ( ) was an Arabic speaking radio station broadcasting to the Arab world from March 23, 2002 till November 2024. The station was a service of the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Inc., which also operates Alhurra Television and was publicly funded by the U.S. Agency for Global Media and the U.S. Congress. The word &quot;sawa&quot; (, ) means &quot;together&quot; in many Arabic dialects.

Preexisting attitudes and concurrent reality of opinions towards the United States led to the creation of Radio Sawa. It sought to effectively communicate with the youthful population of Arabic-speakers in the Middle East. The station&#x27;s goal is to promote pro-American attitudes to youth in the Arab world. Radio Sawa&#x27;s first broadcast was on March 23, 2002. Its newscasts were broadcast live on air from its studios in Washington, DC and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Radio Sawa also had news bureaus and reporters throughout the Middle East.

==History==
Radio Sawa and its sister-network, Al Hurra TV, are part of a larger U.S. Public Diplomacy effort in the Middle East. Their stated mission is to &quot;improve America&#x27;s image in the Middle East and win the hearts and minds of the Arab people.&quot;

Radio Sawa was first launched on 23 March 2002, initially in Jordan, West Bank, Kuwait, UAE (Abu Dhabi), Qatar and Bahrain and eventually in the rest of the Arab World (see below for full list).

Radio Sawa replaced Voice of America&#x27;s Arabic service, which had not been successful in attracting large audiences. The initiator of Radio Sawa is American media mogul Norman Pattiz. He found that more than 60% of the Arab population was under the age of 30, which is why he decided to develop programming that would target the younger generation. Pattiz believed that the best way to reach the young people was with music. This is why the majority of the radio&#x27;s programming consists of American and Arab pop music.

Radio Sawa is controlled by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), the Federal agency responsible for all U.S. international civilian broadcasting. The BBG founded the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN), a non-profit news and information organization, to run Radio Sawa and Al Hurra TV.

===Funding===
Radio Sawa is a United States Congress-funded public relations endeavor.

==Historical programming before the 2019 revamp==
In contrast to the Voice of America radio broadcasts in the region which it replaced, Radio Sawa blended news with contemporary music, arts and lifestyle and other light programming. Radio Sawa&#x27;s programming consisted of roughly 20–25% news and 75–80% pop songs.

===News===
Apart from songs, most other content is presented in the rubric &quot;The World Now&quot; (), which included news, interviews, sports, etc.

===Songs===
The station&#x27;s playlist included popular Arabic (Middle Eastern), English (mostly American hits) and Spanish (mostly Latin American) songs so as to attract the Arabic listener.

===Special programming===
There were also occasional specials.

==Reaction==
Radio Sawa has been subject to criticism from various observers, who question its effectiveness in conveying America&#x27;s message to the Arab world. Radio Sawa is commonly seen as terms of a solution to public relations crisis during the time of its launch as a form of public diplomacy, &#x27;suggesting by implication that American media efforts do have the power to transform opinion if only implemented in a different form&#x27;.

===Arab World===
A study published in 2006, which surveyed college students at universities in five Arab countries, found that the students&#x27; attitudes towards U.S. foreign policy had actually worsened since they started listening to Radio Sawa and watching Al Hurra TV

Radio Sawa has also been criticized for its poor quality control and for its resistance to any outside review of its programming.

===United States===
A 2004 draft report prepared by the State Department&#x27;s inspector general was severely critical of the station. Experts cited in the report concluded that &quot;Radio Sawa failed to present America to its audience.&quot;

The station&#x27;s emphasis on popular music has led critics to question if music alone is enough to convey America&#x27;s message. Some critics point out that what matters is &quot;not just how many people are tuning in, but how many people are affected by a broadcast&#x27;s content.&quot;

Radio Sawa is broadcast using Medium wave (AM) transmitters, FM transmitters, audio satellite broadcasting, and internet streaming.

== Shut down ==
Over its last 5 years, Radio Sawa kept scaling down, from broadcasting on the medium wave, FM, and online streaming to just FM, streaming, and podcasting, to only streaming mostly the audio of Alhurra TV and podcasting, till November 2024, when the live stream ceased and later the website radiosawa.com started redirecting to alhurra.com.

<doc id="1060022" wikidata="Q428852" url="?curid=1060022" title="Jamie Madrox (rapper)">
<text>Jamie Michael Spaniolo (born November 5, 1975), known professionally as Jamie Madrox, is an American rapper from Detroit, Michigan, and performs as a member of the hip hop groups Twiztid and House of Krazees. Spaniolo&#x27;s stage name is a reference to Marvel Comics&#x27;s character Multiple Man.

== Early life ==
Jamie Spaniolo began rapping as a teenager while he was in highschool. Shortly after, his parents adopted Zachary Potter, making him Spaniolo&#x27;s brother and only sibling. In school, Spaniolo and friend Paul Methric would freestyle with other kids, though the two felt they were never great at promptly coming up with rhymes. Both recall going to school with late-rapper Proof and seeing him freestyle, describing him as &quot;the mecca of freestyling&quot;. Spaniolo and Methric also participated in freestyle battles at the Hip Hop Shop on a weekly basis.

== Musical career ==

=== House of Krazees (1992–1997, 2013-present) ===
Spaniolo started his musical career in 1992 as an original member of House of Krazees under the pseudonym Big-J changing it to Mr. Bones after the first album. Along with Hektic and The R.O.C., the original House of Krazees released five albums between 1993 and 1996. Problems with the group&#x27;s label, Latnem Entertainment, led The R.O.C. to leave, and House of Krazees disbanded.

However, they reunited on the song &quot;Monstrosity&quot; off of Twiztid&#x27;s &quot;A New Nightmare&quot; EP in 2013.

=== Solo career (1994-present) ===
In 1994, Spaniolo released his first solo EP, &quot;The Demon Inside&quot;, under the name Mr. Bones. He followed up with the LP &quot;Sacrifice&quot; in 1995. Spaniolo&#x27;s debut solo album under the name Jamie Madrox, &quot;Phatso&quot;, was released in 2006. A week after the release, a special tour-edition album, &quot;Phatso: The Earth 2 Version&quot;, came out and featured remixed songs from the original album as well as new songs. According to Twiztid&#x27;s Twitter page, Spaniolo re released &quot;Sacrifice&quot; during the Slaughterhouse tour.

=== Twiztid (1997–present) ===

After receiving an offer from Insane Clown Posse to join Psychopathic Records in 1998, Spaniolo and Methric accepted and reemerged as Twiztid. Upon signing with the label, the duo revamped their image, and set out to prove themselves to the Juggalo fanbase. Twiztid opened shows for Insane Clown Posse. In 1998, Twiztid&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Mostasteless&quot;, was released. With the release, a shift in reaction toward Twiztid occurred, and Juggalos slowly began to receive the duo well. Twiztid, however, continued to open for Insane Clown Posse and appear with them at in-store tours, improving their rapport with the fanbase.

In 1999, Insane Clown Posse persuaded Island Records to sign Twiztid. During Twiztid&#x27;s brief stint with the label, &quot;Mostasteless&quot; was pulled from shelves and re-released under Island Records. The following year, the duo went back to Psychopathic Records and released &quot;Freek Show&quot;. &quot;Freek Show&quot; debuted at #51 on Billboard charts, and Twiztid&#x27;s fanbase grew immensely. Twiztid remained with Psychopathic Records until 2012, and have helped to sign artists Blaze Ya Dead Homie and The R.O.C to the label. The duo&#x27;s 2009 album, W.I.C.K.E.D., peaked at #11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. With the position, Spaniolo says that &quot;it shows relevance. It shows that [we&#x27;re] not just a sideshow act. It shows that we&#x27;re not just protoges, we&#x27;re not just coattail riders. We are here.&quot;

On December 12 it was announced via Twiztid&#x27;s official Twitter that Twiztid has left Psychopathic Records. The duo released a couple of albums independently at first, and have since created their own label, Majik Ninja Entertainment.

=== Dark Lotus (1999–2017) ===

Formed in 1999, Dark Lotus consists of Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler of Insane Clown Posse, Jamie Spaniolo and Paul Methric of Twiztid, and Chris Rouleau. Each member is said to &quot;act as a &#x27;petal&#x27; of the lotus,&quot; and it was announced that there would be six members. But after the first album released there was a problem with Dark Lotus and Marz so they re-released the first album where AnyBody Killa took over Marz place.

=== Psychopathic Rydas (1999–2017) ===

Psychopathic Rydas formed in 1999, and consists of Psychopathic Records-associated rappers performing under alternate stage names in the style of mainstream gangsta rap. The group&#x27;s lineup consisted of Bruce (Bullet), Utsler (Full Clip), Methric (Foe Foe), Spaniolo (Lil&#x27; Shank), Rouleau (Cell Block) and James Lowery (Sawed Off).

Psychopathic Rydas reuses the beats of popular rappers within the genre without paying to license the original songs or requesting permission from copyright owners to use the music, effectively making their albums bootlegs and resulting in the releases becoming difficult to find in some markets.

== Style and influences ==
Spaniolo has cited the rock band Kiss as an influence, noting that &quot;I was too little to understand it was all about sex and women – I just [saw] the face paint, pyro, and rock riffs.&quot; He has said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to do a Rock album and to date [the Twiztid album] Mutant was the closest thing to it we have ever done, so it holds a special place in my heart.&quot; Spaniolo has stated that being a fan of Kiss led to him discovering the hair metal bands Ratt, Cinderella and Twisted Sister, and Mötley Crüe&#x27;s album &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;. Monoxide was more of a hip hop fan and Jamie Madrox was more into rock music when the duo were younger, with the latter stating, &quot;I&#x27;m the guy that likes The Beatles or Frank Sinatra.&quot; After Monoxide finally persuaded Jamie Madrox to listen to Run-DMC, the group&#x27;s &quot;Raising Hell&quot; album became the first rap album Jamie Madrox ever purchased, and led to him discovering N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; and becoming a serious fan of the genre.

His interests in both horror movies and comic books have also had a major influence on his music. Spaniolo describes his work in Twiztid &quot;as if there was a &quot;Halloween&quot; or &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; on wax and Jason and Michael Myers could actually rap.&quot; His stage name is taken from the Marvel Comics superhero &quot;The Multiple Man&quot; Jamie Madrox, and he has made reference to &quot;The Multiple Man&quot; nickname in song. The special tour-edition of his album &quot;Phatso&quot; was titled &quot;Phatso: The Earth 2 Version&quot;, alluding to the parallel world in the DC Multiverse Earth-Two.

== Wrestling career ==
=== Beginning (1999) ===
In 1999, Insane Clown Posse began a stint in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The duo brought Spaniolo and Methric along with them to shows backstage, being fans of wrestling themselves. After Insane Clown Posse left the WWF, they started a wrestling tour called the &quot;Hellfire Wrestling&quot; tour. Again, both Spaniolo and Methric were brought along backstage.

=== Commentary (1999–2007) ===
On November 23, 1999, &quot;Stranglemania, Vol. 2&quot; was released. Alongside commentators &quot;Handsome&quot; Harley Guestella and Diamond Donovan Douglas, Spaniolo debuted as color commentator &quot;Lucious&quot; Johnny Stark. The following year, Juggalo Championship Wrestling released &quot;JCW Vol. 1&quot;, and featured Guestella, Douglas, and Stark on commentary. The trio continued to commentate on &quot;JCW Vol. 2&quot; and &quot;JCW Vol. 3&quot;. On May 19, 2007, &quot;Lucious&quot; Johnny Stark contributed commentary to the sixth episode of &quot;SlamTV!&quot;, filling in for Diamond Donovan Douglas who had laryngitis.

=== Professional wrestling (1999–2003) ===
On December 19, 1999, both Spaniolo and Methric participated in the first &quot;Juggalo Championship Wrestling&quot; event. As Jamie Madrox and Monoxide Child, they were featured in a 20-man battle royal to crown the first JCW Heavyweight Champion, which was won by Evil Dead. Spaniolo and Methric continued to sporadically wrestle for JCW until 2003. Both are untrained and have had several wrestlers show them moves backstage at shows. When asked in a 2009 interview if they were planning on returning to wrestling, Spaniolo replied, &quot;No, we&#x27;re not wrestlers. Every time we step into the ring, something bad happens. Either somebody gets hurt, or we get hurt ... There are things in life that you&#x27;re good at, and not good at. [We&#x27;re] not good at [wrestling].&quot; He added that they will stick to simply watching wrestling.

== Personal life ==
Madrox has kids. Spaniolo is a fan of horror movies, citing the &quot;Halloween&quot; series and the Rob Zombie remake, the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series and the 2009 remake, &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; and &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;, &quot;The Funhouse&quot;, and &quot;Night of the Demons&quot; among his favorites. He also enjoys the use of supernatural styles in films. Spaniolo hosts a section on the Twiztid website called &quot;At the Movies with Madrox&quot; in which he reviews recently released movies. He himself has an interest in getting into acting as well, and currently has gigs booked as typecast and background characters.

He is also an avid fan of comic books, and has attended multiple conventions such as Wizard World Chicago. Spaniolo has noted that, &quot;I&#x27;m big into horror comics, regular comics, horror cinema, the toys, models, I love that shit. It&#x27;s the fabric of what I grew up on.&quot; He has made multiple references to comic books in his lyrics. Twiztid&#x27;s internet radio show for WFKO (now airing on Psychopathic Radio) is called &quot;Ashtrays and Action Figures&quot;, alluding to Methric&#x27;s love of cigarettes and Spaniolo&#x27;s passion for collector items and memorabilia.

Spaniolo is a fan of professional wrestling, and enjoys wrestling of the 1980s the most. He is a playable character in Eidos Interactive&#x27;s video game Backyard Wrestling: Don&#x27;t Try This at Home as Jamie Madrox.

Spaniolo was arrested in Tampa, Florida on October 23, 2011, at the Days Inn on Dale Mabry Highway for possession of cannabis and possession of drug paraphernalia. Police found 110.6 grams of marijuana in total. Spaniolo, Methric (Monoxide), Rouleau (Blaze), and Picklez were released on a $2,500 bond each.

<doc id="1060027" wikidata="Q5180296" url="?curid=1060027" title="Craccum">
<text>Craccum is a weekly student magazine of the University of Auckland, owned and operated by the Auckland University Students&#x27; Association (AUSA) in New Zealand. It was founded in 1927 and the name originated from the scrambled acronym of &quot;Auckland University College Men&#x27;s Common Room Committee&quot;. &quot;Craccum&quot; is a member of the Aotearoa Student Press Association (ASPA). 

== Overview ==
The magazine has at times been controversial, with stories on how to shoplift, the drawbacks of various methods of committing suicide, drug use guides, recipes for illegal drugs and drug rape guides. &quot;Craccum&quot; is also a popular proving ground for New Zealand mainstream media, with many of its alumni moving on to publications such as &quot;The Listener&quot;, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, &quot;The National Business Review&quot; and &quot;Metro&quot; magazine.

In 1989 the publication was re-branded &quot;Torso&quot; (a reference to it being the magazine of the student body) for the final issues of that year, an event noted in the mainstream media. However the original name was re-established the following year.

In 2005, the rights to the front cover of the sellout-themed issue of &quot;Craccum&quot; were auctioned on TradeMe. Salient, the student magazine for Victoria University of Wellington, won the auction. In 2011 the rights to the front cover of the women&#x27;s rights-themed issue were again auctioned on TradeMe, with proceeds going to Women&#x27;s Refuge; the auction was won by the Tertiary Education Union (TEU).

=== Awards and recognition ===
In 2007, &quot;Craccum&quot; won the award for Best Publication at the ASPA Awards for the first time. It was awarded runner-up for Best Small Publication in 2016 and runner-up for Best Publication in 2017. In 2022, &quot;Craccum&quot; won the award for Best Publication at the ASPA Awards for the second time. 

== Editors ==

The Craccum Editor was an elected position between 1986 and 2019. Before 1986, the Editor was appointed each year by the Craccum Administration Board. This practise was reinstated in 2019, following the introduction of a new AUSA constitution. The election for Craccum Editor was held in the second semester, on the same ballot as the AUSA portfolio elections.

Former Craccum Editor Tim Shadbolt (1972) became Mayor of Waitemata City and later Mayor of Invercargill. Mike Rann (1975) was Premier of South Australia 2002 to 2012.

<doc id="1060031" wikidata="Q674834" url="?curid=1060031" title="Dependency grammar">
<text>Dependency grammar (DG) is a class of modern grammatical theories that are all based on the dependency relation (as opposed to the &quot;constituency relation&quot; of phrase structure) and that can be traced back primarily to the work of Lucien Tesnière. Dependency is the notion that linguistic units, e.g. words, are connected to each other by directed links. The (finite) verb is taken to be the structural center of clause structure. All other syntactic units (words) are either directly or indirectly connected to the verb in terms of the directed links, which are called &quot;dependencies&quot;. Dependency grammar differs from phrase structure grammar in that while it can identify phrases it tends to overlook phrasal nodes. A dependency structure is determined by the relation between a word (a head) and its dependents. Dependency structures are flatter than phrase structures in part because they lack a finite verb phrase constituent, and they are thus well suited for the analysis of languages with free word order, such as Czech or Warlpiri.

==History==
The notion of dependencies between grammatical units has existed since the earliest recorded grammars, e.g. Pāṇini, and the dependency concept therefore arguably predates that of phrase structure by many centuries. Ibn Maḍāʾ, a 12th-century linguist from Córdoba, Andalusia, may have been the first grammarian to use the term &quot;dependency&quot; in the grammatical sense that we use it today. In early modern times, the dependency concept seems to have coexisted side by side with that of phrase structure, the latter having entered Latin, French, English and other grammars from the widespread study of term logic of antiquity. Dependency is also concretely present in the works of Sámuel Brassai (1800–1897), a Hungarian linguist, Franz Kern (1830–1894), a German philologist, and of Heimann Hariton Tiktin (1850–1936), a Romanian linguist.

Modern dependency grammars, however, begin primarily with the work of Lucien Tesnière. Tesnière was a Frenchman, a polyglot, and a professor of linguistics at the universities in Strasbourg and Montpellier. His major work &quot;Éléments de syntaxe structurale&quot; was published posthumously in 1959 – he died in 1954. The basic approach to syntax he developed has at least partially influenced the work of others in the 1960s, although it is not clear in what way these works were inspired by other sources. A number of other dependency-based grammars have gained prominence since those early works. DG has generated a lot of interest in Germany in both theoretical syntax and language pedagogy. In recent years, the great development surrounding dependency-based theories has come from computational linguistics and is due, in part, to the influential work that David Hays did in machine translation at the RAND Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s. Dependency-based systems are increasingly being used to parse natural language and generate tree banks. Interest in dependency grammar is growing at present, international conferences on dependency linguistics being a relatively recent development (Depling 2011, Depling 2013, Depling 2015, Depling 2017, Depling 2019 ).

==Dependency vs. phrase structure==
Dependency is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element (e.g. word or morph) in the sentence, there is exactly one node in the structure of that sentence that corresponds to that element. The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency grammars are word (or morph) grammars. All that exist are the elements and the dependencies that connect the elements into a structure. This situation should be compared with phrase structure. Phrase structure is a one-to-one-or-more correspondence, which means that, for every element in a sentence, there are one or more nodes in the structure that correspond to that element. The result of this difference is that dependency structures are minimal compared to their phrase structure counterparts, since they tend to contain many fewer nodes.

These trees illustrate two possible ways to render the dependency and phrase structure relations (see below). This dependency tree is an &quot;ordered&quot; tree, i.e. it reflects actual word order. Many dependency trees abstract away from linear order and focus just on hierarchical order, which means they do not show actual word order. This constituency (= phrase structure) tree follows the conventions of bare phrase structure (BPS), whereby the words themselves are employed as the node labels.

The distinction between dependency and phrase structure grammars derives in large part from the initial division of the clause. The phrase structure relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a predicate verb phrase (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, Leonard Bloomfield and Noam Chomsky. Tesnière, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as the root of all clause structure. Tesnière&#x27;s stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from term logic and has no place in linguistics. The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax is real, then one is likely to go down the path of phrase structure grammar, while if one rejects this division, then one must consider the verb as the root of all structure, and so go down the path of dependency grammar.

==Dependency grammars==
The following frameworks are dependency-based:
* Algebraic syntax
* Operator grammar
* Link grammar
* Functional generative description
* Lexicase
* Meaning–text theory
* Word grammar
* Extensible dependency grammar
* Universal Dependencies

Link grammar is similar to dependency grammar, but link grammar does not include directionality between the linked words, and thus does not describe head-dependent relationships. Hybrid dependency/phrase structure grammar uses dependencies between words, but also includes dependencies between phrasal nodes – see for example the Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank. The derivation trees of tree-adjoining grammar are dependency structures, although the full trees of TAG rendered in terms of phrase structure, so in this regard, it is not clear whether TAG should be viewed more as a dependency or phrase structure grammar.

There are major differences between the grammars just listed. In this regard, the dependency relation is compatible with other major tenets of theories of grammar. Thus like phrase structure grammars, dependency grammars can be mono- or multistratal, representational or derivational, construction- or rule-based.

==Representing dependencies==
There are various conventions that DGs employ to represent dependencies. The following schemata (in addition to the tree above and the trees further below) illustrate some of these conventions:

The representations in (a–d) are trees, whereby the specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are &quot;dependency edges&quot; and lightly dotted lines are &quot;projection lines&quot;. The only difference between tree (a) and tree (b) is that tree (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels. Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from linear order and reflects just hierarchical order. The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by Word Grammar. The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words. Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from linear order.

The point to these conventions is that they are just that, namely conventions. They do not influence the basic commitment to dependency as the relation that is grouping syntactic units.

==Types of dependencies==
The dependency representations above (and further below) show syntactic dependencies. Indeed, most work in dependency grammar focuses on syntactic dependencies. Syntactic dependencies are, however, just one of three or four types of dependencies. Meaning–text theory, for instance, emphasizes the role of semantic and morphological dependencies in addition to syntactic dependencies. A fourth type, prosodic dependencies, can also be acknowledged. Distinguishing between these types of dependencies can be important, in part because if one fails to do so, the likelihood that semantic, morphological, and/or prosodic dependencies will be mistaken for syntactic dependencies is great. The following four subsections briefly sketch each of these dependency types. During the discussion, the existence of syntactic dependencies is taken for granted and used as an orientation point for establishing the nature of the other three dependency types.

===Semantic dependencies===
Semantic dependencies are understood in terms of predicates and their arguments. The arguments of a predicate are semantically dependent on that predicate. Often, semantic dependencies overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies. At times, however, semantic dependencies can point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or they can be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The hierarchy of words in the following examples show standard syntactic dependencies, whereas the arrows indicate semantic dependencies:

The two arguments &quot;Sam&quot; and &quot;Sally&quot; in tree (a) are dependent on the predicate &quot;likes&quot;, whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on &quot;likes&quot;. What this means is that the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point in the same direction (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence &quot;big&quot; is a predicate in tree (b) that takes &quot;bones&quot; as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate &quot;on&quot; takes the two arguments &quot;the picture&quot; and &quot;the wall&quot;; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate &quot;to help&quot; in (d) takes the one argument &quot;Jim&quot; but is not directly connected to &quot;Jim&quot; in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.

===Morphological dependencies===
Morphological dependencies obtain between words or parts of words. When a given word or part of a word influences the form of another word, then the latter is morphologically dependent on the former. Agreement and concord are therefore manifestations of morphological dependencies. Like semantic dependencies, morphological dependencies can overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies, overlap with and point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The arrows are now used to indicate morphological dependencies.

The plural &quot;houses&quot; in (a) demands the plural of the demonstrative determiner, hence &quot;these&quot; appears, not &quot;this&quot;, which means there is a morphological dependency that points down the hierarchy from &quot;houses&quot; to &quot;these&quot;. The situation is reversed in (b), where the singular subject &quot;Sam&quot; demands the appearance of the agreement suffix &quot;-s&quot; on the finite verb &quot;works&quot;, which means there is a morphological dependency pointing up the hierarchy from &quot;Sam&quot; to &quot;works&quot;. The type of determiner in the German examples (c) and (d) influences the inflectional suffix that appears on the adjective &quot;alt&quot;. When the indefinite article &quot;ein&quot; is used, the strong masculine ending &quot;-er&quot; appears on the adjective. When the definite article &quot;der&quot; is used, in contrast, the weak ending &quot;-e&quot; appears on the adjective. Thus since the choice of determiner impacts the morphological form of the adjective, there is a morphological dependency pointing from the determiner to the adjective, whereby this morphological dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies. Consider further the following French sentences:

The masculine subject &quot;le chien&quot; in (a) demands the masculine form of the predicative adjective &quot;blanc&quot;, whereas the feminine subject &quot;la maison&quot; demands the feminine form of this adjective. A morphological dependency that is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies therefore points again across the syntactic hierarchy.

Morphological dependencies play an important role in typological studies. Languages are classified as mostly head-marking (&quot;Sam work-s&quot;) or mostly dependent-marking (&quot;these houses&quot;), whereby most if not all languages contain at least some minor measure of both head and dependent marking.

===Prosodic dependencies===
Prosodic dependencies are acknowledged in order to accommodate the behavior of clitics. A clitic is a syntactically autonomous element that is prosodically dependent on a host. A clitic is therefore integrated into the prosody of its host, meaning that it forms a single word with its host. Prosodic dependencies exist entirely in the linear dimension (horizontal dimension), whereas standard syntactic dependencies exist in the hierarchical dimension (vertical dimension). Classic examples of clitics in English are reduced auxiliaries (e.g. &quot;-ll&quot;, &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-ve&quot;) and the possessive marker &quot;-s&quot;. The prosodic dependencies in the following examples are indicated with hyphens and the lack of a vertical projection line:

A hyphen that appears on the left of the clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word immediately to its left (&quot;He&#x27;ll&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s&quot;), whereas a hyphen that appears on the right side of the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word that appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (&quot;He&#x27;ll&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s&quot;) or on its head (&quot;would&#x27;ve&quot;). At other times, it can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (&quot;Florida&#x27;s&quot;).

===Syntactic dependencies===
Syntactic dependencies are the focus of most work in DG, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many DGs can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. The basic question about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of DGs is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of phrase structure grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic tests for constituents being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis tests for constituents. Etymological considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution. When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.

==Linear order and discontinuities==
Traditionally, DGs have had a different approach to linear order (word order) than phrase structure grammars. Dependency structures are minimal compared to their phrase structure counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions. Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency structures has allowed DGs, starting with Tesnière (1959), to focus on hierarchical order in a manner that is hardly possible for phrase structure grammars. For Tesnière, linear order was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesnière produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesnière adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.

The traditional focus on hierarchical order generated the impression that DGs have little to say about linear order, and it has contributed to the view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, is that there is a dearth of DG explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard discontinuities. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of topicalization, &quot;wh&quot;-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition are mostly absent from many established DG frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with phrase structure grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.

The nature of the dependency relation does not, however, prevent one from focusing on linear order. Dependency structures are as capable of exploring word order phenomena as phrase structures. The following trees illustrate this point; they represent one way of exploring discontinuities using dependency structures. The trees suggest the manner in which common discontinuities can be addressed. An example from German is used to illustrate a scrambling discontinuity:

The a-trees on the left show projectivity violations (= crossing lines), and the b-trees on the right demonstrate one means of addressing these violations. The displaced constituent takes on a word as its head that is not its governor. The words in red mark the catena (=chain) of words that extends from the root of the displaced constituent to the governor of that constituent. Discontinuities are then explored in terms of these catenae. The limitations on topicalization, &quot;wh&quot;-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition can be explored and identified by examining the nature of the catenae involved.

==Syntactic functions==
Traditionally, DGs have treated the syntactic functions (= grammatical functions, grammatical relations) as primitive. They posit an inventory of functions (e.g. subject, object, oblique, determiner, attribute, predicative, etc.). These functions can appear as labels on the dependencies in the tree structures, e.g.

The syntactic functions in this tree are shown in green: ATTR (attribute), COMP-P (complement of preposition), COMP-TO (complement of to), DET (determiner), P-ATTR (prepositional attribute), PRED (predicative), SUBJ (subject), TO-COMP (to complement). The functions chosen and abbreviations used in the tree here are merely representative of the general stance of DGs toward the syntactic functions. The actual inventory of functions and designations employed vary from DG to DG.

As a primitive of the theory, the status of these functions is very different from that in some phrase structure grammars. Traditionally, phrase structure grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject the existence of a finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue is a question of what comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas phrase structure grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.

This question about what comes first (the functions or the constellation) is not an inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (dependency and phrase structure) are not narrowly limited to the traditional views. Dependency and phrase structure are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, that are solely based on dependency or phrase structure, will likely reject the notion that the functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. They will take both to be primitive, which means neither can be derived from the other.

<text>Julio Rosado del Valle (1922 - September 20, 2008), was an internationally known abstract expressionist.

==Early years==
Rosado del Valle was born in Cataño, Puerto Rico and as a young child would always be drawing or painting. In his primary school his teachers recognized his artistic talents. After graduating from high school, Rosado del Valle enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico, where he took art classes under guidance of Cristobal Ruiz.

In 1946, Rosado del Valle went to New York where he attended &quot;The New School for Social Research&quot; and studied under the guidance of the Cuban painter Mario Carreño and the muralist Camilo Egas. A year later in 1947, Rosado del Valle moved to Paris, France where he visited museums and art exhibitions. He later went to Italy where he attended &quot;The School of Fine Arts&quot; in Florence.

==&quot;Puerto Rican Arts Center&quot;==

In 1949, Rosado del Valle returned to Puerto Rico, where he worked in the Division of Community Education. He was also named resident artist of the University of Puerto Rico. In 1950, he was the co-founder, along with Torres Martino, Lorenzo Homar, Felix Rodriguez Baez and Rafael Tufino, of the &quot;Puerto Rican Arts Center&quot;.

In 1952, he won a gold medal for mural painting in New York, sponsored by the Architectural League of New York and in 1957, Rosado del Valle was awarded a scholarship from the Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. In 1965, Rosado del Valle won a gold medal for his art work, from the &quot;Friends of Puerto Rico Society of New York&quot;. His work has been categorized as abstract expressionism and has been recognized locally and internationally.

In 1967, Rosado del Valle represented Puerto Rico in the &quot;Latin-American Art Exhibition&quot; celebrated in the Palace of Beautiful Arts in Mexico. In 1998, he won the art and culture award from the &quot;New York State Puerto Rican Hispanic Task Force Conference.&quot; Rosado del Valle has had many international and local exhibits, including in the Museo de Arte de Ponce (1982), The Museum of Contemporary Art (1988) and The Luigi Marrozzini Gallery (1993) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and in the United States and Europe.

==Later years==
In the year 2002, a fire completely destroyed a warehouse in Carolina in which he had stored hundreds of his paintings. The University of Puerto Rico bestowed upon him an honorary Doctorate Degree in Humanities in 2004. Until he was no longer able, Julio Rosado del Valle got up every morning and painted in his house, which was located in Guaynabo, and then he went to his paint shop in Cataño to work.

He died from Kidney failure in San Juan, Puerto Rico in September 2008. A retrospective of his work opened at the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico (MAPR) in late 2008.

<doc id="1060042" wikidata="Q705537" url="?curid=1060042" title="Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty">
<text>The Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty (; also known as the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890) was an agreement signed on 1 July 1890 between Germany and the United Kingdom. 

The accord gave Germany control of the Caprivi Strip (a ribbon of land that gave German South-West Africa access to the Zambezi River), the strategically located island of Heligoland in the North Sea, and the heartland of German East Africa. In return, Germany recognized British authority in Zanzibar. Heligoland was needed to control the new Kiel Canal and the approaches to Germany&#x27;s North Sea ports. Britain used Zanzibar as a key link in the British control of East Africa.

==Terms==

Germany gained the islands of Heligoland () in the North Sea, originally possession of the dukes of Holstein-Gottorp but since 1814 a British possession, the so-called Caprivi Strip in what is now Namibia, and a free hand to control and acquire the coast of Dar es Salaam that would form the core of German East Africa (later Tanganyika, now the mainland component of Tanzania).

In exchange, Germany handed over to Britain the protectorate over the small sultanate of Wituland (, on the Kenyan coast) and parts of East Africa vital for the British to build a railway to Lake Victoria, and pledged not to interfere with British actions vis-à-vis the independent Sultanate of Zanzibar (i.e. the islands of Unguja and Pemba). In addition, the treaty established the German sphere of interest in German South West Africa (most of present-day Namibia) and settled the borders between German Togoland and the British Gold Coast (now Ghana), as well as between German Kamerun and British Nigeria.

==Consequences==
Britain divested itself of a naval base which covered the approaches to the main German naval bases in the North Sea, but which would be impossible to defend as Germany built up its navy. It immediately declared a protectorate over Zanzibar and, in the subsequent 1896 Anglo-Zanzibar War, gained full control of the sultanate.

The treaty served German chancellor Leo von Caprivi&#x27;s aims for a settlement with the British. After the 1884 Berlin Conference, Germany had been losing out in the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;. The German East Africa Company under Carl Peters had acquired a strip of land on the Tanganyikan coast (leading to the 1888 Abushiri Revolt), but had never had any control over the islands of the Zanzibar sultanate. The treaty gave away no vital German interests, while acquiring Heligoland, an island which was strategically placed for control over the German Bight. With the construction of the Kiel Canal from 1887 onward, control of the German Bight had become essential to Emperor Wilhelm&#x27;s II plans for expansion of the Imperial Navy. Wilhelm&#x27;s naval policies aborted an accommodation with the British and ultimately led to a rapprochement between Britain and France, sealed with the &quot;Entente cordiale&quot; in 1904.

The misleading name for the treaty was introduced by ex-Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who intended to attack his despised successor Caprivi for concluding an agreement that Bismarck himself had arranged during his incumbency. However, Bismarck&#x27;s nomenclature implied that Germany had swapped an African empire for tiny Heligoland (&quot;trousers for a button&quot;). This was eagerly adopted by imperialists, who complained about &quot;treason&quot; against German interests. Carl Peters and Alfred Hugenberg appealed for the foundation of the (&quot;Pan-German League&quot;) which took place in 1891.

<text>The gooseneck is the swivel connection on a sailboat by which the boom attaches to the mast. The boom may pivot in any direction, from side to side or up and down, by swiveling on the gooseneck.

The gooseneck may be a two-axis swivel as pictured. Having an integrated shackle for the tack is common. Goosenecks on older rigs may be formed by a loop attached to the end of the boom that fits loosely about the mast.

<text>The Waitematā Harbour is the main access by sea to Auckland, New Zealand. The harbour forms the northern and eastern coasts of the Auckland isthmus and is crossed by the Auckland Harbour Bridge. It is matched on the southern side of the city by the shallower waters of the Manukau Harbour.

With an area of , it connects the city&#x27;s main port and the Auckland waterfront to the Hauraki Gulf and the Pacific Ocean. It is sheltered from Pacific storms by Auckland&#x27;s North Shore, Rangitoto Island, and Waiheke Island.

==Etymology==
The oldest Māori name of the harbour was Te Whanga-nui o Toi (The Big Bay of Toi), named after Toi, an early Māori explorer.

The name &quot;Waitematā&quot; means &quot;Te Mata Waters&quot;, which according to some traditions refers to a mauri stone (a stone of Māori religious significance) called Te Mata, which was placed on Boat Rock (in the harbour south-west of Chatswood) by Te Arawa chief Kahumatamomoe. A popular translation of &quot;Waitematā&quot; is &quot;The Obsidian Waters&quot;, referring to obsidian rock (&quot;matā&quot;). Another popular translation, derived from this, is &quot;The Sparkling Waters&quot;, as the harbour waters were said to glint like the volcanic glass obsidian. However, this is incorrect, as grammatically &quot;Waitematā&quot; could not mean this.

== Geography ==

The harbour is an arm of the Hauraki Gulf, extending west for eighteen kilometres from the end of the Rangitoto Channel. Its entrance is between North Head and Bastion Point in the south. The westernmost ends of the harbour extend past Whenuapai in the northwest, and to Te Atatū Peninsula in the west, as well as forming the estuarial arm known as the Whau River in the southwest.

The northern shore of the harbour consists of North Shore. North Shore suburbs located closest to the shoreline include Birkenhead, Northcote and Devonport (west to east). On the southern side of the harbour is Auckland CBD and the Auckland waterfront, and coastal suburbs such as Mission Bay, Parnell, Herne Bay and Point Chevalier (east to west), the latter of which lies on a short triangular peninsula jutting into the harbour.

The harbour is crossed at its narrowest point by the Auckland Harbour Bridge. To the east of the bridge&#x27;s southern end lie the marinas of Westhaven and the suburbs of Freemans Bay and the Viaduct Basin. Further east from these, and close to the harbour&#x27;s entrance, lies the Port of Auckland.

There are other wharves and ports within the harbour, notable among them the Devonport Naval Base, and the accompanying Kauri Point Armament Depot at Birkenhead, and the Chelsea Sugar Refinery wharf, all capable of taking ships over . Smaller wharves at Birkenhead, Beach Haven, Northcote, Devonport and West Harbour offer commuter ferry services to the Auckland CBD.

==Geology==
The harbour is a drowned valley system that was carved through Miocene marine sediments of the Waitemata Group. Recent volcanism in the Auckland volcanic field has also shaped the coast, most obviously at Devonport and the Meola Reef (a lava flow which almost spans the harbour), but also in the explosion craters of Orakei Basin and in western Shoal Bay. Over the last two million years, the harbour has cycled between periods of being a forested river valley and a flooded harbour. In periods of low sea level, a tributary ran from Milford into the Shoal Bay stream. This valley provided the harbour with a second entrance when sea levels rose, until the Lake Pupuke volcano plugged this gap.

Approximately 17,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Period when sea levels were significantly lower, the river flowed north-east along the Rangitoto Channel, meeting the Mahurangi River to the east of Kawau Island. The resulting river flowed further north-east between modern day Little Barrier Island and Great Barrier Island, eventually emptying into the Pacific Ocean north of Great Barrier Island.

The current shore is strongly influenced by tidal rivers, particularly in the west and north of the harbour. Mudflats covered by mangroves flourish in these conditions, and salt marshes are also typical.

== History ==
Prior to European settlement, the harbour was the site of many Tāmaki Māori pā and kāinga, including Kauri Point in Chatswood, Okā at Point Erin, Te Tō at Freemans Bay, Te Ngahuwera, Te Rerenga-oraiti at Point Britomart, and Ōrākei. Herald Island and Watchman Island were both settled by the Waiohua confederation. The Waitematā Harbour was traditionally used as a fishery used by Tāmaki Māori for sharks and snapper. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the waters were fished together by Ngāti Whātua-o-Ōrākei and Ngāti Pāoa. In traditional legend, the Waitematā Harbour is protected by a taniwha named Ureia, who takes the form of a whale.

The harbour has long been the main anchorage and port area for the Auckland region. Well-sheltered not only by the Hauraki Gulf itself but also by Rangitoto Island, the harbour offered good protection in almost all winds, and lacked dangerous shoals or major sand bars (like on the Manukau Harbour) that would have made entry difficult. The harbour also proved a fertile area for encroaching development, with major land reclamation undertaken, especially along the Auckland waterfront, within a few decades of the city&#x27;s European founding.

Taking the idea of the several Māori portage paths over the isthmus one step further, the creation of a canal that would link the Waitematā and Manukau harbours was considered in the early 1900s. Legislation (the Auckland and Manukau Canal Act 1908) was passed that would allow authorities to take privately owned land where it was deemed required for a canal. However, no serious work (or land take) was undertaken. The act was repealed on 1 November 2010.

In 1982, a group that included leaders of the Anglican and Catholic proposed the construction of the Christ of the Ships, a bronze statue of Jesus be constructed on a reef in the Waitematā Harbour. The project was cancelled after facing significant opposition by Christian leaders from other denominations.

===Sewage contamination ===

While the harbour has numerous beaches popular for swimming, the older-style &quot;combined sewers&quot; in several surrounding western suburbs dump contaminated wastewater overflows into the harbour on approximately 52 heavy-rain days a year, leading to regular health warnings at popular swimming beaches, until the outfalls have dispersed again. A major project, the Central Interceptor, starting 2019, is to reduce these outfalls by about 80% once completed around 2026.

==Demographics==

The statistical area of Inlet Waitemata Harbour had a population of 84 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 60 people (250.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 63 people (300.0%) since the 2006 census. There were no households. There were 60 males and 21 females, giving a sex ratio of 2.86 males per female. The median age was 25.5 years, with no people aged under 15 years, 54 (64.3%) aged 15 to 29, 21 (25.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 9 (10.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 50.0% European/Pākehā, 10.7% Māori, 3.6% Pacific peoples, 39.3% Asian, and no other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).

The proportion of people born overseas was 57.1%, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people objected to giving their religion, 39.3% had no religion, 50.0% were Christian, and 3.6% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 9 (10.7%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 3 (3.6%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $40,200. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 54 (64.3%) people were employed full-time, 6 (7.1%) were part-time, and 0 (0.0%) were unemployed.

<doc id="1060052" wikidata="Q20912" url="?curid=1060052" title="The Galileo Seven">
<text>&quot;The &quot;Galileo&quot; Seven&quot; is the sixteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Oliver Crawford and directed by Robert Gist, it first aired on January 5, 1967.

In the episode, First Officer Spock leads a scientific team from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; aboard the shuttlecraft &quot;Galileo&quot; on an ill-fated mission, facing tough decisions when the shuttle crashes on a planet populated by aggressive giants.

It&#x27;s inspired by the film &quot;Five Came Back&quot;.

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, under the command of Captain Kirk, is en route to Makus III to deliver medical supplies destined for the New Paris Colony. The ship passes close to a quasar-like formation identified as Murasaki 312, which Kirk&#x27;s standing orders require him to study. Kirk sends a science team composed of Science Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, Chief Engineer Scott, Yeoman Mears, and three other specialists (Latimer, Gaetano, and Boma) in the shuttlecraft, &quot;Galileo&quot;, to investigate the formation. Soon after launch, the shuttle is pulled off course. Spock makes an emergency landing on the planet Taurus II, a rocky, fog-shrouded world in the middle of the Murasaki phenomenon.

Crewmembers Latimer and Gaetano scout the area, eventually encountering Taurus II&#x27;s native inhabitants: giant ape-like creatures armed with enormous spears and shields. Latimer is killed by a spear, and Gaetano drives off the creatures with phaser fire. The crew retreat to the &quot;Galileo&quot;, only to discover that the creatures seem to be preparing for an organized attack. Despite objections from the others, Spock chooses to attempt to frighten the creatures rather than killing them outright. This proves to be a miscalculation, and Gaetano is killed.

Meanwhile, Kirk searches for the shuttle, despite concerns from Commissioner Ferris, who is impatient to start for Makus III. Because of sensor interference, the shuttlecraft &quot;Columbus&quot; is dispatched to search the planet from orbit, and search parties are transported to the surface. One of the landing parties returns with casualties and reports being attacked by the large, furry creatures.

Between boulder-throwing attacks by the primitive giants and quarrels amongst themselves, the crew attempt to make repairs on the shuttle. As most of their conventional fuel has been lost, Mr. Scott adapts the landing party&#x27;s phasers to power the ship. His repairs are eventually successful, but Boma will not leave without giving Gaetano and Latimer a proper burial. When Spock advises against it, Boma becomes insubordinate, to which Spock responds by allowing him the funeral. During the ceremony, the creatures attack again, and Spock is pinned by a boulder. Despite Spock&#x27;s orders to leave him, McCoy and Boma free him. Spock then manages to get the &quot;Galileo&quot; off the ground by using the shuttle&#x27;s boosters. As a result, the shuttle now has too little fuel to escape the planet&#x27;s gravity or even to achieve a stable orbit, and there is still no way to contact the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Spock suddenly decides to dump and ignite all the remaining fuel from the shuttle&#x27;s engines. The giant flare he produces is seen on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; view screen just as the ship has left orbit. Kirk reverses course, and the survivors are beamed out just as the shuttle is destroyed on re-entry.

Back on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Kirk questions Spock, trying to get him to admit that his final action was motivated more by emotion than logic. Spock refuses but freely admits to stubbornness, at which the rest of the crew burst into laughter.

==Reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &#x27;B&#x27; rating, noting that it &quot;raises some interesting issues&quot; but described it overall as watching a &quot;fixed fight&quot;.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot; as the 67th greatest &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise episode in 2016, including episodes in later series. They also ranked this episode as the 19th best episode of the original series. In 2016, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot; the 9th best episode of the original series.

Io9&#x27;s 2014 listing of the top 100 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes placed &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot; as the 36th best episode of all series up to that time, out of over 700 episodes.

In 2015, SyFy ranked this episode as one of the top ten essential Star Trek original series Spock episodes.

In 2017, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot; the 9th best episode of the original series. They note this is the first Star Trek episode to include a shuttlecraft.

In 2018, &quot;Collider&quot; ranked this episode the 15th best original series episode.

In 2018, &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked this the 17th best episode of the original series.

A 2018 &quot;Star Trek&quot; binge-watching guide by &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, recommended this episode for featuring the trio of characters Kirk, Spock, and Bones of the original series.

<text>KCRA-TV (channel 3) is a television station in Sacramento, California, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is owned by Hearst Television alongside Stockton-licensed dual CW/MyNetworkTV affiliate KQCA (channel 58). The two stations share studios on Television Circle off D Street in downtown Sacramento; KCRA-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in Walnut Grove, California.

==History==
The station first signed on the air on September 3, 1955. It was founded by the Central Valley Broadcasting Company, a partnership of the Kelly and Hansen families of Sacramento. Central Valley Broadcasting also owned KCRA radio (1320 AM, now KIFM, and 96.1 FM, now KYMX); the AM station&#x27;s call letters were intended to be &quot;KRCA&quot;, but the middle two letters were erroneously transposed by a typist at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) when that station&#x27;s original license was drafted in 1945 and was never corrected. By the time KCRA-TV went on the air, the KRCA call letters had already been taken the previous year by NBC&#x27;s owned-and-operated station in Los Angeles (originally KNBH, now KNBC). The station&#x27;s longtime original studios were located at 310 10th Street in Sacramento. KCRA-TV inherited the NBC affiliation from KCCC-TV (channel 40, channel now occupied by Fox affiliate KTXL), which became the Sacramento market&#x27;s first television station when it signed on in September 1953, which had also carried affiliations with ABC, CBS and DuMont until other stations debuted in the market. However, it in turn also received the affiliation as a result of KCRA radio&#x27;s decade-long affiliation with the NBC Radio Network. KCRA was the third of the Sacramento area&#x27;s VHF stations to sign on exactly within a year behind KXTV (channel 10) and Stockton-licensed KOVR (channel 13)—all signing on in six-month increments.

In 1959, under the direction of then chief engineer, William Herbert Hartman, construction began on a new transmission tower near Walnut Grove to transmit the signals of KCRA-TV, KXTV and KOVR; the tower was completed in 1961. Upon the death of KCRA co-founder Ewing C. Kelly in 1960, son Bob Kelly (who was KCRA&#x27;s station manager, commercial manager and film buyer) became president of KCRA, Inc., while son Jon Kelly (who served as its local sales manager) was named general manager.
In January 1962, KCRA-TV began transmitting its signal from the Walnut Grove tower, which became the tallest structure in the state. In April of that year, the FCC approved the sale of the Hansen brothers&#x27; 50% share of the KCRA stations to Bob, Jon and their mother Nina Kelly; the company then changed its name to Kelly Broadcasting Company. In September 1968, KCRA-FM&#x27;s call letters were changed to KCTC. The radio stations were sold to the Tribune Company in September 1977, with the sale being finalized in July 1978; KCRA (AM) changed its calls to KGNR in August of that year.
In 1965, the station began using color film for use in its newscasts. A station press release at that time claimed that KCRA was the first station in Sacramento with videotape, the first NBC affiliate with &quot;network color&quot; programming, and the first station to utilize color film, slide and videotape footage. Starting in 1975, it began using remote cameras for live news reports. In 1979, the station began using helicopters and eventually, satellite remotes for newsgathering. On September 10, 1966, Bob Wilkins began hosting a Saturday night horror movie showcase called &quot;Seven Arts Theatre&quot;; Wilkins later moved his show to KTXL, and then to KTVU in Oakland in the 1970s.
In the mid-1990s, KCRA was carried nationally on the PrimeStar digital satellite television service as an out-of-market distant local network for customers who lived in a market where a local NBC affiliate was absent or otherwise unavailable with an antenna. KCRA&#x27;s national carriage on PrimeStar ended when the satellite service was acquired by DirecTV in September 1999; DirecTV customers were offered Los Angeles NBC station KNBC instead.

Like other local stations, KCRA developed an in-house production facility, with local children&#x27;s programming, newsmagazines and talk shows. By the beginning of the 21st century, KCRA became the first station in the Sacramento market to broadcast programming in high definition. Kelly Broadcasting continued to own and operate KCRA-TV until January 1999, when it was purchased by Hearst-Argyle Television (which was renamed Hearst Television in 2009).

In early 2004, KCRA opened an exhibit, &quot;The KCRA 3 Experience&quot;, at the Arden Fair Mall, allowing visitors to see a KCRA newscast be produced live. KCRA&#x27;s noon newscast was broadcast from the complex until late 2008 when production of the program was moved back to the 3 Television Circle studios.

KCRA, along with Fox affiliate KTXL, are the only Sacramento television stations to have never changed their network affiliations, as they were unaffected by affiliation swaps in 1995 (when KXTV acquired the ABC affiliation from KOVR, which in turn, switched to CBS) and 1998 (when KMAX-TV—channel 31—took UPN from now-sister station KQCA, which switched from UPN to The WB).

==KCRA 3.2==
In early 2005, KCRA debuted a localized version of NBC Weather Plus on digital subchannel 3.2. After NBC Weather Plus shut down in December 2008 (following NBCUniversal&#x27;s purchase of The Weather Channel), the subchannel continued to use the Weather Plus branding as part of the successor NBC Plus automated weather service until late 2008.

On August 2, 2010, digital subchannel 3.2 was reformatted as &quot;MoreTV Sacramento&quot;, a locally programmed channel that featured second-runs of syndicated programs seen locally on KCRA and sister station KQCA; the &quot;MoreTV&quot; branding had previously been used by Tampa sister station WMOR-TV and KCWE in Kansas City during the early and mid-2000s. The channel ran a mix of sitcoms (such as &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;), dramas (&quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot;) and talk shows (&quot;Maury&quot;, &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; and &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot;). It also aired select KCRA newscasts, including rebroadcasts KCRA&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast at 7 p.m. and KCRA&#x27;s 10 p.m. and KQCA&#x27;s 11 p.m. newscasts at midnight; as well as a simulcast of KCRA&#x27;s noon newscast. Until October 15, 2010, KCRA continued to run Weather Plus programming during the early morning hours (Salinas sister station KSBW also carried a prime time syndicated programming lineup, branded as &quot;KSBW PrimePLUS+&quot;, on its second digital subchannel from around the same time as the &quot;MoreTV&quot; launch until February 1, 2011).

On July 24, 2012, Hearst Television renewed its affiliation agreement with MeTV to maintain existing affiliations with eight Hearst-owned stations currently carrying the digital multicast network through 2015. As part of the renewal, Hearst also signed agreements to add the network as digital subchannels of KCRA and sister stations WCVB-TV in Boston, WBAL-TV in Baltimore, KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City and WXII-TV in Greensboro. Digital subchannel 3.2 assumed the MeTV affiliation on September 3, 2012, replacing the &quot;MoreTV&quot; format.

==Programming==
Over the years, KCRA has preempted some NBC programming, notably the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. That show would air on the station for a brief time, but was dropped again due to low ratings. Eventually, &quot;Another World&quot; would air instead on future sister station KQCA (at the time, under a local marketing agreement) until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1999. Given its format as a news-intensive station, KCRA also preempted the weekend edition of &quot;Today&quot; and the Saturday morning &quot;T-NBC&quot; lineup during the 1990s, to run a weekend morning newscast. It also aired a 4:30 p.m. newscast, pushing &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;″ start time back a half-hour earlier than the typical practice; that newscast ended after the station began airing &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;; in September 2002; since then, &quot;Days&quot; aired at the network-recommended 1 p.m. timeslot on weekdays until the show&#x27;s move to streaming service Peacock in September 2022. However, despite NBC&#x27;s historically low tolerance towards program preemptions, the network has been more than satisfied with KCRA, given its near-total ratings dominance in the Sacramento market.

Currently, KCRA airs &quot;Today 3rd Hour&quot; on a one-hour delay due to &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot; airing in the 9 a.m. timeslot (until 1999, the show aired on KOVR, even back in its days as an ABC station); the fourth hour used to air after a repeat of the 11 p.m. newscast at 2:12 a.m. (when NBC rebroadcast the fourth hour nationally as part of its overnight schedule); sister stations KSBW-TV in Salinas, California, WXII-TV in Greensboro, WBAL-TV in Baltimore and WYFF in Greenville, South Carolina also opted to delay the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot; until the overnight hours, but on March 28, 2022, the rebroadcast of the fourth hour was replaced by a rebroadcast of NBC News Now&#x27;s &quot;Top Story with Tom Llamas&quot;, effectively preempting the program altogether and becoming the only current NBC program to not air on KCRA. Other syndicated programming seen on KCRA includes &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; and its live counterpart, &quot;The Kelly Clarkson Show&quot;, and &quot;Extra&quot;. The first three are distributed by NBC&#x27;s corporate cousin.

Occasionally as time permits, sister station KQCA may air NBC network programs whenever KCRA is unable to in the event of extended breaking news coverage or scheduled special programming or run KCRA newscasts in their scheduled airtimes due to overruns or scheduled preemptions resulting from network sports coverage airing on channel 3.

KCRA carried select Sacramento Kings games through the network&#x27;s broadcast contract with the NBA from 1990 to 2002.

===News operation===
KCRA presently broadcasts 45 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and hours on Sundays). KCRA also produces 22 hours a week of local newscasts for sister station KQCA with a three-hour extension of KCRA&#x27;s weekday morning newscast from 7 to 10 a.m. and a nightly full-hour prime time broadcast at 10 p.m., with a total of 67 hours of locally produced newscasts combined. The station&#x27;s longtime slogan, &quot;Where The News Comes First&quot;, has become a symbol for its news coverage. The slogan was first used by KCRA in December 1958 (Kelly filed to trademark the slogan in 1980) and has been licensed to other television stations. KCRA has long been the dominant news station in the Sacramento market, with some newscasts having more viewers than the competing stations combined. The station credited the high ratings to a stable news team and being the only station with a news helicopter.

From 1991 to 1993, KCRA (later to be joined by KRON-TV and KPIX in San Francisco) participated in an experiment in which prime time programming would air one hour earlier (from 7 to 10 p.m., mirroring typical network scheduling in the Central, Mountain and Hawaii Time Zones, instead of the standard 8 to 11 p.m. slot for Pacific Time Zone stations). The early prime time idea led to only a slight decrease in KCRA&#x27;s ratings, and its 10 p.m. newscast remained the highest-rated late local news program on the West Coast. A station survey showed that 63% of viewers thought a 10 p.m. newscast was a good idea. However, pressure from NBC, who threatened to yank the station&#x27;s affiliation, forced KCRA to end the practice and revert to the time zone&#x27;s standard prime time scheduling, announcing its demise a week after KRON-TV discontinued the experiment; however, it also resulted in KCRA beginning a 10 p.m. newscast on channel 58, which was then KSCH. KOVR would itself switch to an early prime time schedule two years later after switching to CBS.

Under Hearst ownership, KCRA has either hosted or co-hosted many gubernatorial debates within California, often with political reporter Kevin Riggs serving as moderator and one other personality hosting the debate. Many of these debates are simulcast on sister station KSBW in Salinas. A notable example of such is the debate between Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown.

From about 1960 until the late 1980s, its logo was an Arabic numeral 3 inside a green square with rounded corners and convex sides (to represent the shape of a TV tube). The current logo, a partially modified version of the original design, was adopted in the late 1980s. Also, it referred to its newscasts as &quot;Channel 3 Reports&quot; rather than &quot;Channel 3 News&quot;. The branding was slightly modified after the Hearst purchase to &quot;KCRA 3 Reports&quot;, even as its newscasts on KQCA began to be titled as &quot;KCRA 3 News&quot;. However, in August 2009, KCRA retitled its 11 p.m. newscast as the &quot;KCRA 3 Night Team&quot;. In July 2011, the &quot;Reports&quot; branding was phased out from the station&#x27;s news branding, which changed to &quot;KCRA 3 News&quot;.

In late December 2005, KCRA began using a new &quot;Triple Doppler&quot; system for weather reports. In addition to KCRA&#x27;s own Doppler weather radar system at Walnut Grove, range and accuracy were increased by adding data from NEXRAD sites operated by the National Weather Service located north of Reno on Virginia Peak, south of San Jose on Mount Umunhum, and at Beale Air Force Base.

On February 12, 2007, KCRA became the first television station in the Sacramento market and the first among Hearst-Argyle&#x27;s station portfolio to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition (with the exception of its noon newscast until 2008 as it was still broadcasting in standard-definition at Arden Fair Mall); this came with the introduction of a new news set designed by FX Group and upgrades to its news helicopter, LiveCopter 3. Upon the conversion to HD, the KCRA logo was modified to include the NBC peacock logo and an &quot;HD&quot; lettering. Only in-studio cameras record in HD, while the helicopter&#x27;s camera, field cameras and other station camera feeds are in standard definition and are upconverted to a 16:9 widescreen format in the control room. In September 2008, KCRA began using a new &quot;Triple Doppler&quot; system with high-definition graphics. As of August 25, 2010, with KSBW upgrading its newscasts to HD, both KCRA and KSBW now share resources in this format when covering news stories from their respective markets.

On December 21, 2015, KCRA announced the addition of a new 4 p.m. newscast, anchored by Lisa Gonzales and Brian Heap. The newscast premiered on January 25, 2016. A Spanish-subtitled simulcast of KCRA&#x27;s 5 p.m. newscast was added to sister station KQCA&#x27;s Estrella TV subchannel on September 5, 2017. This newscast was not in direct competition with any Spanish-language newscast in the market until March 18, 2020, when Telemundo owned-and-operated station KCSO-LD launched newscasts at 5 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. On April 23, 2018, KCRA began its expanded weekday morning newscast with an extra half-hour starting at 4 a.m.

In March 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the station added an additional hour of news and launched a new 7 p.m. newscast that airs on weekdays. The newscast remains on-air today as a half-hour program.

==Notable incidents==
On January 4, 2020, a fire broke out at KCRA&#x27;s main building on Television Circle in Sacramento. The fire was contained to an older portion of the building that had been used as storage, but was otherwise mostly abandoned. Despite forcing the evacuation of some staff, the station remained on-air, broadcasting the West Coast feed of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; while firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, KCRA, like many local stations, modified its news practices to allow reporters to file news packages from remote locations, including their homes. On April 17, 2020, San Joaquin County Bureau Chief Melinda Meza filed a news story on the difficulties hair stylists were facing during a state-mandated quarantine order. At the end of her report, a nude man was visible in the background as Meza filmed herself in her bathroom. The uncensored segment aired during the station&#x27;s 6:30 p.m. newscast, generating a significant amount of social media attention. A few hours later, Meza deleted an Instagram post and a tweet promoting the story. No one from the station or its parent company Hearst had commented on the incident. On July 31, 2020, Meza was fired from the station.

In December 2020, KCRA and several other news organizations were sued in federal court for copyright infringement stemming from the re-use of a Canadian photographer&#x27;s wildlife images without authorization or payment.

On June 5, 2023, a video surfaced showing KCRA reporters, photographers and producers cheering wildly after receiving a regional Emmy award for their coverage of the 2022 Sacramento shooting, one of the worst mass shootings in Sacramento history. The celebration came while the presenter of the award was reading the title of the entry, &quot;Six Killed in Downtown Sacramento Shooting&quot;. The cheering drew strong condemnation from people in attendance immediately after the ceremony, and from the public after a local journalist posted a clip of the incident online.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KCRA-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 35, using virtual channel 3.

As part of the SAFER Act, KCRA ran a looping DTV program (also known as &quot;nightlight service&quot;) for 30 days after the transition. The looping program aired public service announcements in English and Spanish about the digital transition.

==Carriage disputes==
For years, residents in South Lake Tahoe received KCRA via cable, even though the latter community fell outside the Sacramento media market as defined by Nielsen. In 2018, Charter Communications via its Spectrum cable service stopped distributing KCRA to residents in South Lake Tahoe, opting to distribute Reno NBC affiliate KRNV on an exclusive basis. Charter said its decision was based on an FCC rule that required it to only carry programming from a network affiliate in a designated media market. The move angered residents of South Lake Tahoe, with many saying Charter&#x27;s decision to drop KCRA left cable customers without access to local news and election information. Officials in El Dorado County petitioned the FCC to annex South Lake Tahoe from the Reno market into the Sacramento market. Similarly, due to Hearst&#x27;s demands for additional funds to carry out–of–market stations, KCRA was dropped by Comcast in Chico, Redding, Benicia, and Vallejo, which are served by KNVN and KNTV.

<text>Susan Sullivan (born 1942) is an American actress known for her roles as Lenore Curtin Delaney on the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; (1971–76), as Lois Adams on the ABC sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot; (1980–81), as Maggie Gioberti Channing on the CBS primetime soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1981–90), as Kitty Montgomery on the ABC sitcom &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; (1997–2002), and as Martha Rodgers on &quot;Castle&quot; (2009–2016). She earned an Emmy nomination for Lead Actress for the role of Julie Farr in the 1978 series &quot;Julie Farr, M.D.&quot; and a Golden Globe nomination for Supporting Actress for her role in &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;.

==Life and career==
Sullivan was born in New York City, the daughter of Helen (née Rockett) and Brendan Sullivan, an advertising executive. She was raised on Long Island in Freeport, Nassau County, where she graduated from Freeport High School in 1960. She earned a BA in drama from Hofstra University in 1964.

She got her start in acting in the 1960s playing opposite Dustin Hoffman in the Broadway play &quot;Jimmy Shine&quot;. She landed a contract with Universal Studios in 1969, guest-starring on several series. It was during this time that she played roles in daytime dramas.

Starting with a role on &quot;A World Apart&quot; in 1970, she moved to a five-year stint as Lenore Moore Curtin Delaney on the daytime soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. Taking over from Judith Barcroft, Sullivan played the role from 1971 to 1976. She played Charlton Heston&#x27;s girlfriend Ann, a new character written into the television version of the film &quot;Midway&quot; (1976). She then played Dr. Elaina Marks opposite Bill Bixby in the &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; pilot in 1977 and portrayed Poker Alice opposite James Garner as Bret Maverick on &quot;The New Maverick&quot; the following year. Sullivan also appeared in Barnaby Jones; episode titled “Final Judgement”(01/26/1978).

She played the role of Maggie Porter in the television drama &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man Book II&quot;. She played Dr. Julie Farr in &quot;Having Babies&quot; from 1978 to 1979, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, which was made into two television films and later a short-lived weekly series in 1978. During a week in February 1978, she was a panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot;, both on CBS and in syndication. In 1980, she appeared on the sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;, playing head waitress Lois Adams.

In 1981, Sullivan won the role of Maggie Gioberti in the CBS primetime soap drama &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, replacing Samantha Eggar, who had appeared in the pilot. The series became a hit and Maggie became Sullivan&#x27;s most prominent role to date. She appeared on the series from 1981 to 1989, during which time she was nominated for three &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; awards. At the time Sullivan decided to leave the series in 1989, she had appeared in every episode of the series up to that date (207 of the 227 episodes produced). Sullivan appeared in the first episode of season nine, when her character drowned.

Following &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, Sullivan appeared on &quot;The George Carlin Show&quot;, co-starred on the short-lived political drama &quot;The Monroes&quot; in the mid-1990s, and played a supporting role in the film &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (as the mother of Cameron Diaz&#x27;s character) (1997). On &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;, she played the snooty country-club matriarch Kitty Montgomery from 1997 to 2002. The series reunited Sullivan with actor Mitchell Ryan (who played her husband Edward), with whom she had worked on &quot;Having Babies&quot;. She appeared in four episodes in season three of &quot;Hope and Faith&quot; as Nancy Lombard, Faith&#x27;s therapist. Sullivan voiced Queen Hippolyta on the animated series &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. She has also appeared on the television series &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;, &quot;The Kominsky Method&quot;, and &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;.

From 2009 to 2016, Sullivan co-starred alongside Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic and Molly Quinn on &quot;Castle&quot;. Her character Martha Rodgers&#x27; acting career has somewhat paralleled her own, including references to appearances on soap operas.

==Personal life==

In 2023, Sullivan was diagnosed with lung cancer, and underwent surgery to have it removed.

<doc id="1060058" wikidata="Q3410125" url="?curid=1060058" title="Psychopathic Rydas">
<text>Psychopathic Rydas was an American hip hop group based in Detroit, Michigan. Formed in 1999 as a side project of Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid, the group consisted of Psychopathic Records-associated rappers performing under alternate stage names in the style of gangsta rap. Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope, Jamie Madrox, Monoxide Child, and Blaze Ya Dead Homie were the only consistent members of the group throughout their entire existence.

== History ==

Psychopathic Rydas was created as a retaliation to the critics saying Psychopathic Records artists were &quot;wannabe rappers&quot;. The supergroup was also utilized as a showcase for the label&#x27;s roster which was expanding for the first time since its inception. The group first consisted of Violent J (Bullet) and Shaggy 2 Dope (Full Clip) of Insane Clown Posse, who had released five albums prior; Jamie Madrox (Lil&#x27; Shank) and Monoxide (Foe Foe) of Twiztid, who had released two versions of their debut album prior; Myzery (Twin Gatz) who had released a debut EP prior; and Blaze Ya Dead Homie (Cell Block) who was in the process of releasing his debut EP.

In the liner notes of Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s album &quot;The Amazing Jeckel Brothers&quot; fans could find out how to send proof of purchase to Psychopathic Records to get a full-length album titled &quot;Dumpin&#x27;&quot;, by a &quot;gangsta rap spoof&quot; group called Psychopathic Rydas. The album was released on the imprint Joe &amp; Joey Records. From that point on, Rydas albums could not be officially released elsewhere due to the use of unlicensed samples and beats.

Over the next two years, there were plans for the original six members to release solo albums as their respective persona. &quot;The Pendulum #7&quot; (which were mini releases related to Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s comic book series) featured two solo songs by Bullet and one solo song by Full Clip. A solo song by Lil&#x27; Shank was leaked online, and later included on a limited edition boxset by Twiztid in 2019. A second song by Lil&#x27; Shank was eventually released in 2020 on Twiztid&#x27;s mixtape &quot;For the Fam, Vol. 3&quot;. In 2023, a solo track by Cell Block was included on his compilation &quot;Graveyard Greats, Volume 2&quot;, which also featured verses by Lil&#x27; Shank. Solo songs by Foe Foe and Twin Gatz from the same era never surfaced.

After the release of &quot;Dumpin&quot;&#x27;, Twin Gatz left the group and Psychopathic Records in general. The remaining five members released the album &quot;Ryden Dirtay&quot; at the 2001 Gathering of the Juggalos, just days before the other collaboration album &quot;Tales from the Lotus Pod&quot; by Dark Lotus came out. &quot;Ryden Dirtay&quot; is the only Rydas album to appear on the Billboard Independent Albums chart, at #46. Wanting to involve more artists, Rydas added two new members in 2004, being Anybody Killa (Sawed Off) and Esham (Converse). As a sampler, the &quot;Limited Edition EP&quot; was released. Three out of the four songs would be exclusive to this release. At the 2004 Gathering of the Juggalos, &quot;Check Your Shit in Bitch!&quot; was released.

Converse and Sawed Off left Psychopathic Records in 2005 and 2006 respectively. Cell Block, Bullet, Full Clip, Lil&#x27; Shank, and Foe Foe were the remaining members of the group yet again, similar to 2001; however, in 2007, they added Boondox (Yung Dirt) to the group. This lineup released the album &quot;Duk Da Fuk Down&quot; that same year.

It would be four years until another Rydas collaboration happened. In 2011, Sawed Off returned to the group. The seven members released the albums &quot;Backdoor Ryda EP&quot; and &quot;EatShitNDie&quot;. This would mark the final releases as a group. In late 2012, Lil&#x27; Shank, Foe Foe, and Cell Block would leave Psychopathic Records to eventually form their own label, Majik Ninja Entertainment. Yung Dirt would leave Psychopathic Records in the following years as well. Starting in 2012, the four rappers would still appear at the annual Gathering of the Juggalos, and perform as Psychopathic Rydas as well; however, 2015 would feature the final Rydas performance. 2016 marked the artists&#x27; final appearance at the annual event, although the Rydas did not perform at that year&#x27;s Gathering of the Juggalos.

Bullet and Full Clip stated in various interviews that a revival of the Rydas was a possibility, but nothing concrete was ever officially announced; thus, the supergroup became inactive. In 2019, Lil&#x27; Shank, Foe Foe, Cell Block, and Yung Dirt created a spin-off group named The Rydas on their own label, adding in other artists as well. They released their self-titled album under Majik Ninja Entertainment on January 9, 2020. In addition, Twin Gatz and Sawed Off have also released solo albums under their Psychopathic Rydas pseudonyms; however, the releases were not affiliated with Psychopathic Records or Joe &amp; Joey Records.

== Music and Style ==

Psychopathic Rydas reuses the beats of popular rappers within the genre without paying to license the original songs or requesting permission from copyright owners to use the music, effectively making their albums bootlegs and resulting in the releases becoming difficult to find in some markets. Psychopathic Rydas&#x27; debut album, &quot;Dumpin&quot;&#x27;, was originally given away for correctly answering a series of trivia questions printed in the liner notes of Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s album, &quot;The Amazing Jeckel Brothers&quot;.

<doc id="1060065" wikidata="Q2925640" url="?curid=1060065" title="Brisbane Bears">
<text>The Brisbane Bears was the name for a professional Australian rules football club based in Brisbane, Queensland, now known as the Brisbane Lions. Granted a Victorian Football League licence in 1986, it was the first privately owned club in the history of the competition and debuted in the 1987 VFL season.

The club initially played home matches at Carrara Stadium on the Gold Coast (this stadium was redeveloped many years after the relocation of the Bears to facilitate home matches for expansion club the Gold Coast Suns). After many years of negotiation, in 1991 the AFL and the Bears convinced the Queensland Government to redevelop the Brisbane Cricket Ground (Gabba) facilitating a permanent move to the venue for the 1993 season after which the club experienced a period of success. 

During its history, the club enjoyed only a modest amount of success, being the first non-Victorian side to win an AFL reserves premiership in 1991. Despite the success in its later years, the club struggled to shake the derisive tags which included &quot;Carrara Koalas&quot; (in reference to the Gold Coast home and the somewhat tame marsupial) and &quot;Bad News Bears&quot; which drew comparisons of its management similar to the hit 1970s movie.

The club came close to folding prior to its move to Brisbane and the AFL began preparing a contingency for its demise in the event that the move was to fail. While the Bears improved on the field, the club continued to struggle financially. At the end of the 1996 season, the AFL helped negotiate a deal with the Fitzroy Football Club administrator whereby the Bears took over Fitzroy&#x27;s AFL assets and operations and as a condition of that deal, on November 1, 1996, Brisbane Bears members voted to change the club&#x27;s name to the Brisbane Bears-Fitzroy Football Club (BBFFC or Brisbane Lions), who participate in the AFL today. The Bears played in 220 VFL/AFL matches over ten seasons, with 70 wins, 148 losses and 2 draws.

==History==
===1980s: Race for a Brisbane licence===
From the mid-1980s, several competing parties had proposed a Brisbane licence for the VFL.

The idea of a Brisbane-based VFL club had begun in 1984, with former actor and businessman Paul Cronin planning on purchasing a licence from the VFL believing that the VFL could not survive successfully without a national competition, however there were some in the VFL management that did not agree, most notably Alan Schwab. Cronin believed that Queensland was uniquely positioned in that it had an existing base in the Queensland Australian Football League (QAFL). Migration from the southern states saw the QAFL go through a period of expansion into the Gold and Sunshine Coasts in the 1970s and despite being less popular than the Queensland Rugby League and Queensland Rugby Union had grown to include a number of well established, wealthy and well supported clubs. The early 1980s had also seen in Queensland and QAFL recruited players making an impact in the VFL, including Frank Dunell, Warren Jones, Gary Shaw, Zane Taylor and young stars like Scott McIvor and Jason Dunstall. Cronin approached premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen in November 1985 to garner government support for the idea.

In 1985, the QAFL had decided that pushing for a Melbourne-based club to relocate to Brisbane was the most viable option. The idea was helped in 1986 when incoming chair Ross Oakley&#x27;s interest in mergers and relocations to help the VFL expand into a national competition.

In June 1985, Brisbane sports promoter John Brown announced he would bid for a Brisbane licence along with entertainment promoter Michael Edgely.

On 22 May 1986, at the Brisbane Parkroyal Hotel, the QAFL president John Collins and Ken Murphy announced plans to lobby for a Brisbane-based VFL team the QAFL still pursuing the relocation of an existing team.

The VFL&#x27;s Jack Hamilton flew to Brisbane in July 1986 to explore the options including club relocations (but denied that it was for Fitzroy), stating to the media that a Brisbane team would be possible in 1987 if a vacancy was available. He later stated that Brisbane was the preferred city for VFL expansion and that the VFL had hoped that it could retain all of its existing clubs during the expansion phase.

A third bidder a consortium headed by Perth millionaire Alastair Norwood (head of Jeans West) was announced shortly after Brown&#x27;s bid.

The QAFL joined as a fourth bidder for the new licence, but stated that it was open to forming a consortium with any of the other three bids. Ken Murphy decided that Cronin&#x27;s motives for the licence were genuine and aligned with the QAFL. Brown initiated discussions with North Melbourne Football Club in an attempt to lure it to Brisbane, however the Kangaroos rejected the proposal. In response to the moves by the other bids, on 19 August 1986, the QAFL and Cronin joined forces.

Struggling Fitzroy Football Club, in conjunction with the VFL, began investigating a relocation to Brisbane in 1987. However the club under Leon Wiegard voted to remain in Melbourne. Struggling Richmond Football Club under Alan Bond proposed to play half its games in Brisbane in 1987. The move was seen as a threat of relocation and met strong opposition, led by Kevin Bartlett who rallied to stop the proposal, though the club came very close to folding the following year. Despite the setback, the VFL decided to push forward with the plans for expansion into Brisbane.

At the end of 1986, the VFL Commission announced plans to set up privately owned clubs based in Perth and Brisbane, ignoring a strong bid from ACTAFL for a team in Canberra, motivated by the need to sell multimillion-dollar licences to save a number of Victorian clubs which were struggling financially. The VFL at the time set a price of $4 million AUD for a licence to enter the league with the proceeds to be split among the existing clubs.

On 1 October 1986, the VFL board was announced that teams from Brisbane (Brisbane Bears) and Perth (West Coast Eagles) would compete in the Victorian Football League (VFL) from 1987 and that no $2.8 million AUD rescue package would be offered for struggling Fitzroy. The VFL Commission initially chose to grant John Brown&#x27;s consortium Browns International Sport Limited the licence.

===Cronin, Skase licence and private ownership===
Cronin refused to accept the VFL&#x27;s decision and increased its bid to $4.8 million, or up to $6 million if Fitzroy relocated to Brisbane and became the Brisbane Lions. 

Unable to secure access to a stadium, Cronin&#x27;s QAFL consortium drew up plans for a $7 million new stadium on vacant land at Boondall (on the site of what became the Brisbane Entertainment Centre). Brisbane&#x27;s main outdoor venues, the Brisbane Cricket Ground (Gabba) and Brisbane Showgrounds&#x27; Main Oval, were unavailable due to long-term contracts and the Brisbane Cricket Ground (Gabba) was home to the greyhound racing club and was encircled by a dog racing track. The QAFL believed that the club should be based in Brisbane and supported the redevelopment of the Brisbane Cricket Ground (Gabba) (owned by the Gabba trust), or secondary options of a new stadium at Boondall or Chandler (on land owned by the government).

With the higher price offered VFL withdrew its support for Browns and extended the selection process. The consortia found a financial backer in millionaire entrepreneur and Qintex owner Christopher Skase. In response Norwood&#x27;s syndicate withdrew from the bidding. Cronin lobbied every VFL club president individually to gain their support for the bid. The VFL Commission voted unanimously to award the Cronin-Skase-QAFL bid the licence. The club was given very little time to establish itself, and was without a home ground.

====Coach and player signings====
Recently retired Hawthorn footballer Peter Knights on October 27 was announced coach just weeks later getting the nod over candidates John Todd, Ron Barassi and Alex Jesaulenko.

Millionaire and Qintex owner Christopher Skase was appointed deputy chairman. Qintex General Manager Ian Curtis was also appointed to the club&#x27;s board.

In December 1986, the branding and Brisbane Bears name was leaked to the public. The new marketing department intended for the bear mascot to resemble Dreamworld&#x27;s mascot Kenny to appeal to children and tourists. They created two variations of the bear, a smiling bear for the VFL logo and an &quot;angry bear&quot; for games that would appear roaring for matches and many of the marketing and promotional materials for the club. 

The club unveiled a playing strip consisting of a gold with a maroon yoke and a triangular &quot;BB&quot; logo intended to represent a stylised map of the club&#x27;s home state, Queensland, with the outline of a koala head appearing inside of the larger B. Maroon was chosen as the state colour of Queensland and gold as symbolic of the Queensland sunshine.

Collingwood&#x27;s Mark Williams was the new club&#x27;s first player signing. Other marquee signings were Geoff Raines and Jim Edmond, however most of the other players were from the SANFL and the WAFL. Most notably there were few local Queenslanders in the side. Queenslanders were approached, however there were very few playing in the VFL level at the time. In search of a marquee Queenslander, the Bears approached up and coming Hawthorn Football Club full-forward Jason Dunstall with a $2 million 10-year deal to spearhead the club, however he declined. The Bears were exposed for their lack of local talent but among the local names in the inaugural squad were Gary Shaw, Frank Dunell, Tony Beckett, Darren Carlson, Allan Giffard and Stuart Glascott. However few of the Queenslanders in the side made an impact.

Upon its admission, the Bears did not have a large reserve of local players from which to compile a VFL-standard playing list. To assist with its inaugural playing list, the VFL arranged for every other club to provide at least two players; understandably, other clubs were averse to providing top-line players and few of the players provided were of a high quality. The Bears pursued a number of stars aggressively and did manage a few key signings, including Collingwood&#x27;s captain Mark Williams, and 1985 Brownlow Medallist Brad Hardie. A significant proportion of the player list was recruited from the South Australian National Football League and West Australian Football League. Mark Mickan, a 6&#x27;5&quot; (196 cm) ruckman recruited from West Adelaide, was appointed captain of the Bears in its inaugural season.

====Stadium selection and QAFL vs Skase legal dispute====
The club&#x27;s board, however, were of the opinion the club would not be viable without if it did not own its own stadium.

On 18 December 1986, the club nominated the Carrara Oval on the Gold Coast as a temporary venue with a capacity of 20,000 mooted through the use of temporary stands through the use of metal bleachers. The choice of venue was reported to be the insistence of Christopher Skase. Bears President, Paul Cronin officially announced the home ground on December 23rd. While it raised the ire of the QAFL who were adamant that the club be Brisbane based, the decision to base the club over 70 kilomtres from its namesake baffled many. Skase&#x27;s Gold Coast business interests were reportedly a major factor, with its proximity to his Sheraton Grand Mirage Resort development at Southport under construction at his subsequent promotion of corporate hospitality packages to wealthy southern travellers. Skase argued that with a playing surface the same dimensions as the Melbourne Cricket Ground the venue was the ideal choice. Nevertheless the decision would begin a bitter and long protracted battle between the QAFL and the Bears which was not resolved until 1991.

Skase spent $1 million redeveloping Carrara Oval over a 10-week period at the beginning of 1987. This included the erection of temporary stands, club rooms and facilities.

===Knights era===

The Bears won their first game in the VFL against North Melbourne at the Melbourne Cricket Ground 19.23 (137) to 15.14 (104) in front of 14,096 fans, and also won its second game, but ultimately fell towards the bottom of the ladder. The club avoided the wooden spoon by beating in the final round, and finished with six wins. The club attracted 98,616 fans to the eleven matches at Carrara Oval, an average of 8,965 per game, which was the lowest in the competition behind Fitzroy&#x27;s 11,498. By contrast, the other new 1987 team the West Coast Eagles, with Australian rules football long established as the major football code in Perth, attracted 291,317 to their home games at Subiaco Oval and the WACA at an average of 26,483 per game.

In 1988, a rift developed between the QAFL and the Bears, who had refused a move to Brisbane. The QAFL responded by threatening to secure a second Queensland licence for a Brisbane-based team by 1991.

The club again recruited aggressively, landing Sydney Swans glamour spearhead Warwick Capper. In 1988 and 1989 the club suffered some severe defeats, finishing 13th and 10th respectively. Knights was sacked with eight rounds to play in the 1989 season. The club psychologist, Paul Feltham, took charge of the team for the remainder of the year.

In 1993, staving off media rumours that the Bears would merge with the Sydney Swans to form a combined Queensland/New South Wales team, the Northern Swans, or be relocated to Tasmania or Port Adelaide.

By this stage, the club was also under severe financial pressure. Attendances had been very poor due to poor performances and the long distance between Gold Coast and Brisbane and also due to the admission of the Brisbane Broncos which achieved the goal set by Queensland Rugby League general manager Ross Livermore of marketing and promotions interference against the threat of the VFL&#x27;s expansion, with the team making their debut in the 1988 NSWRL season.

===AFL re-licences, Pelerman buys the Bears===
The collapse of Skase&#x27;s business empire and his sudden departure for Spain in late 1989 almost resulted in the end of the club. Over the ensuing preseason the players threatened strike action, but Cronin resigned, the club was taken over by the AFL, re-sold to Gold Coast hospitality businessman Reuben Pelerman, and a crisis was averted.

The AFL spent significant amounts of money to help the Bears survive over the coming years, and the club was provided with priority draft picks and special recruiting zones to give it access to some of the nation&#x27;s best talent, which over the next few years allowed the club to recruit future stars such as Michael Voss, Jason Akermanis, Clark Keating, Steven Lawrence and Darryl White.

Four-time QAFL premiership coach Norm Dare was appointed as coach in 1990, but after failing to improve from the Bears position from successive wooden spoons, he was sacked at the end of the season.

===Walls era===

Dare was replaced in 1991 by former Carlton premiership coach Robert Walls, who immediately set about rebuilding the playing list. Having inherited the oldest list in the league, by the end of the season he had the youngest. The Brisbane Bears won the wooden spoon again in 1991, but the same year also saw the Brisbane Bears win the reserves premiership against Melbourne. Walls insisted that the Bears not bend to the will of powerful Victorian clubs in recruitment matters, which was seen most notably in the case of the young Nathan Buckley – Buckley, who in 1992 won the SANFL&#x27;s Magarey Medal and was a premiership winner with Port Adelaide, winning the Jack Oatey Medal for being Best on Ground in the SANFL Grand Final, was a zone recruit signed to the club on a one-year contract in 1993, which stipulated that he would be released to the club of his choice if he so desired at the completion of the contract; he was cleared to Collingwood as he had requested, in exchange for premiership centre-half forward Craig Starcevich, goalsneak Troy Lehmann and an early draft pick which the Bears used to recruit future star Chris Scott.

Off-field, Pelerman was losing millions of dollars annually on the club. At one point in 1991, Pelerman told Bears coach Robert Walls that he was closing the club down.

As part of the club&#x27;s proposed move to the Brisbane Cricket Ground (Gabba), Pelerman agreed to release the Bears from private ownership and revert to a traditional club structure in which the club&#x27;s members were able to elect the board.

===Move to the Gabba, rebranding and new membership structure===

In 1992, the club changed its guernsey to a predominantly maroon strip with a gold V and white trim. More significantly, the Bears experimented with playing matches at the Brisbane Cricket Ground (Gabba) in Brisbane in 1991, before permanently moving all home matches to the venue ahead of the 1993 season. With the club now playing in its home city, membership and attendances instantly tripled. The dog racing track around the ground was removed, the surface was upgraded and the stands gradually replaced over the next few years with a view to converting the tired old ground to a state-of-the-art sporting facility.

In 1994, the Bears changed the club logo and the club song, and also began to show signs of a competitive side and were contenders for a finals berth before falling away in the last five games of the season. Then, in 1995, the club reached the finals after an extraordinary late-season recovery. After Round 15, the Bears were third-last on the ladder with four wins, and Robert Walls had announced his resignation as coach halfway through the season, but committed himself to seeing out the year. In Round 16, the Bears trailed Hawthorn by 45 points at three-quarter time, but mounted an astounding final-quarter comeback to win the match by 7 points; it was the largest final quarter comeback in league history. Brisbane then won five of its six remaining matches in the home-and-away season, including against Richmond and Essendon who were both in the top four, to just reach the finals for the first time, albeit with a win–loss record of only 10–12. The team was eliminated, but not disgraced, after losing its first ever final to eventual premiers Carlton by 13 points.

===Northey era===
Under the coaching of former Richmond premiership player John Northey, Brisbane had an excellent 1996 season, finishing third behind Sydney and North Melbourne. They made a good account of themselves in the finals, with two wins at Brisbane Cricket Ground and a loss in the Preliminary Final to eventual premiers North Melbourne. Michael Voss also became the only Brisbane Bears player to win the Brownlow Medal, sharing the honour with Essendon&#x27;s James Hird.

===Club absorb Fitzroy&#x27;s AFL operations, become Brisbane Lions===
However, the club was still struggling off-field. Brisbane came close to folding prior to its move to Brisbane and the AFL began preparing a contingency for the club&#x27;s demise in the event that the move failed. The Bears made a bid in 1990 to take over a financially struggling Fitzroy but was voted down by Fitzroy&#x27;s board. The AFL had offered the Bears $6 million to merge with Fitzroy. It offered Fitzroy a similar amount which could have enabled the club to pay off its debts and come out of administration. One of the Bears&#x27; biggest problems was its lack of support (both on and off the field) in Melbourne, the location of most of its away matches. Another problem was the imminent entry of into the AFL in 1997. As a result, two teams were either required to merge, or one was to fold or exit the league to make way for Port Adelaide&#x27;s entry in the 1997 season. In mid-1996, the struggling Fitzroy Football Club entered administration due to financial pressures and was seeking to merge its AFL operations with another club. When a merger with to form the North Fitzroy Kangaroos failed to win the support of the other AFL clubs, a deal was reached between the Fitzroy administrator and the Bears, whereby Brisbane Bears took over Fitzroy&#x27;s AFL operations. Subsequently, in line with the Deed of Arrangement between Fitzroy and Brisbane, Brisbane Bears members voted to change the club&#x27;s name to Brisbane Bears-Fitzroy Football Club, trading as Brisbane Lions, based at Brisbane Cricket Ground, with a new song, emblem and jumper all based on Fitzroy&#x27;s.

The Bears&#x27; last match was a preliminary final on Saturday 21 September 1996 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against North Melbourne, coincidentally the same location and opponent as their first match in 1987. Brisbane lost by 38 points to North Melbourne, who went on to win the 1996 premiership. With that loss, the Bears era and its history ended after a short and mostly troubled existence, with ten seasons of competition and the third-place finish in 1996 as its best performance.

===Legacy===
Since the absorption of Fitzroy&#x27;s AFL operations, examples of the Bears legacy at the Lions include: the wearing the acronym BBFFC on the back of the jumper (with the BB acknowledging the existence of the Brisbane Bears), the occasional wearing of retro Bears design guernsey during AFL heritage round (Round 18, 2004, and Round 16, 2006, for example), and an Indigenous version of their 1992 guernsey worn on three occasions in 2022, some of the club&#x27;s medals, including the best and fairest: the Merrett–Murray Medal (jointly named after former Bears captain and games record holder Roger Merrett), the Michael Voss Oval at The Reserve, Springfield (named for homegrown Bears and Lions player Michael Voss), and the Marcus Ashcroft Medal (named for homegrown Bears and Lions player Marcus Ashcroft) for the QClash football match against the Gold Coast.

<text>Catholic Answers is a Catholic advocacy group based in El Cajon, California. It describes itself as the largest lay-run apostolate of Catholic apologetics and evangelization in the United States. It publishes &quot;Catholic Answers Magazine&quot;, a bimonthly magazine focusing on Catholic outreach, religious formation and apologetics, as well as the website &quot;catholic.com&quot;. It also produces Catholic Answers Live, a radio show answering callers&#x27; questions on a variety of topics related to the doctrines and practices of the Catholic Church. Catholic Answers Live is syndicated on the EWTN radio network.

==History==
Catholic Answers was founded in 1979 by Karl Keating in response to a fundamentalist Protestant church in San Diego that was distributing anti-Catholic propaganda in the form of tracts placed on the cars of Catholics attending Mass. He first started by writing a modest tract titled &quot;Catholic Answers&quot; to counter the arguments he saw in the anti-Catholic tract. He distributed it on the windshields of the cars in the fundamentalist Protestant church&#x27;s parking lot. Due to the feedback he received from that tract, he published 24 more tracts. In 1988 he quit his law practice and turned Catholic Answers into a full-time apostolate, with an office and full-time staff.

The Catholic.com website receives approximately 471,000 visitors per month in an October 2012 estimate.

==Staff==
Apologists who have worked for Catholic Answers include Trent Horn, Tim Staples, Karlo Broussard, Joe Heschmeyer, and Jimmy Akin.

<doc id="1060072" wikidata="Q2825358" url="?curid=1060072" title="Advanced Aeromarine Buccaneer">
<text>The Buccaneer (also known in some of its many incarnations as the Mallard) is a one- or two-seat ultralight high-wing amphibious flying boat of pusher configuration marketed as a kit aircraft.

The aircraft was manufactured by a number of U.S. firms in slightly different forms, including Arnet Pereyra Inc, HighCraft AeroMarine, Advanced Aviation and Keuthan Aircraft.

==Development==
The original single-seat model Buccaneer XA was introduced in 1984 and qualified for the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicle category. The aircraft was commercial success and sold well until being replaced by the Buccaneer SX in 1988. The SX remained available on the market until general production ended in 1998, although in 2001 the model was still available as a special order from Aero Adventure Aviation. The SX was replaced by the improved derivative Aero Adventure Aventura UL and HP single seaters.

The Buccaneer II was a two-seat side-by-side configuration model introduced in 1988 and intended as an ultralight trainer. This model was replaced by the Aero Adventure Aventura II, which is an improved model developed from the Buccaneer II.

==Design==
The original XA model is constructed from bolted together anodized aluminum tubing, with a fiberglass hull. The wire-braced wing is supported by a king post and is of aluminum structure, covered with pre-sewn Dacron covers. The wing features 2/3 span ailerons and no flaps. The tail wheel is retractable via a cable control, while the main landing gear is removed by the pilot in flight and stowed in the cockpit for landing on water after a land take-off.

The model SX was introduced to provide incremental design improvements over the XA. Primarily the SX eliminated the cable-bracing and replaced it with V-struts featuring jury struts. The wings feature full-span ailerons. The fuselage was completely redesigned and features a new hull shape that can better handle higher wave conditions. The landing gear can be pivoted up for water landings, rather than removed.

The Buccaneer II is similar to the SX, but with a wider hull to accommodate two seats, in side-by-side configuration. The ailerons are 2/3 span. The landing gear is repositioned by a lever control and moves the tailwheel in concert with the main wheels. The main gear includes mechanical brakes.

==Operational use==
The original model XA remains popular on the used aircraft market and aircraft for sale command high prices. Long operational use and the rigours of land and water operation have resulted in weak points in the design being identified as many older aircraft have suffered from bent wing trailing edges, wing root tube brackets, flying wire shackles and tail boom tubes. Cracked aft vertical stabilizer tubes and main bulkheads are also common. All of these deficiencies can be repaired in used aircraft.

==Variants==
;Buccaneer XA
:Single seat, wired-braced Part 103 ultralight flying boat. Engines available were the Rotax 277 and the Rotax 377.
;Buccaneer SX
:Single seat, strut-braced flying boat. Engines available were the Rotax 447 and the Rotax 503.
;Buccaneer II
:Two seat, strut-braced flying boat. Engines available were the Rotax 582 and the Rotax 912.
;Mallard M2-A
:Extensively modified Buccaneer, with the wing lowered. Was sold as a modification package and as a complete kit.

<text>Autopilot Off is a punk rock band from Orange County, New York composed of Chris Hughes (guitar), Chris Johnson (guitar/vocals), Phil Robinson (drums) and Rob Kucharek (bass).

==History==
Autopilot Off formed in 1996 under the name Cooter. They slowly gained popularity by doing live shows throughout the 90s while sharing the stage with more popular bands such as MxPx, Goldfinger, Sum 41, Yellowcard and H2O. Cooter released a split with Slick Shoes on May 23, 2000. They eventually recorded their first full-length album, &quot;Looking Up&quot;. In 2000 the band was involved in a bitter lawsuit with the Mississippi punk rock band The Cooters, who own the trademark to the name Cooter. The New York band changed their name to Autopilot Off in April 2001, and settled out of court in 2002. However, Autopilot Off&#x27;s record label Fastmusic, took the lawsuit all the way to Federal Court and lost to the Mississippi band. In December 2001, Autopilot Off signed with major label Island Records. After this they released their eponymous EP of April 23, 2002. They supported Sum 41 on their headlining tour of the east coast of the US and Canada. In November and December 2002, the band supported the Ataris on their headlining US tour. The band left the tour a week before it ended to start work on their next album, which they started to record in March 2003. The band went on &quot;The Made Tour,&quot; which ran from June to August; they played alongside Further Seems Forever, the Movielife, and Anberlin. The stint featured an appearance at Hellfest. In August, the band released the &quot;Regenerator EP&quot;, which consisted of cover versions of songs by Quicksand, Bad Religion, U2, and Guns n&#x27; Wankers. In September and November, the band played a handful of Northeast and Midwest shows with Lost City Angels.

In 2004, under their new name Autopilot Off, they released their major debut album, &quot;Make a Sound&quot;. This included the single &quot;What I Want&quot;, which was co-written by Rancid&#x27;s Tim Armstrong. The track “Chromatic Fades” was also featured in the video game NASCAR Thunder 2004. &quot;Make a Sound&quot; appeared on &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot;, &quot;What I Want&quot; appeared in Test Drive Eve of Destruction and &quot;, and “Clockwork” appeared in the video game soundtracks for “NHL 2004” and SSX3.

On August 26, 2005, the band decided to go on an indefinite hiatus and released the following statement on their official website:

We&#x27;ve decided to take an indefinite break from Autopilot Off. It has been nearly 10 years since the band started, and it has been full speed ahead for the majority of that time. We have all decided to take some time for our lives outside of the band. We are all still the best of friends. In addition to this we decided a few months back to leave our home of 4 years at Island Records. We apologize for leaving you all hanging for so long. Thank you so much for all the support and friendships that you all have given to us over the years. We could never have done it without you.
Since then, Chris Hughes has gone on to become a business manager (accountant) in the music industry.

Bassist Rob Kucharek has gone on to open American Icon Screen Printing which is an apparel screen printing company that serves many bands and the majority of the BMX industry on the East Coast.

===Reunion (2011)===
In May 2011, a Facebook page titled &quot;Autopilot Off (Official)&quot; was created, with an image of the band&#x27;s name and the words &quot;TwoThousandEleven&quot; being uploaded soon after. This had led to speculation of a possible reunion, nearly six years after they announced their hiatus.

On June 20, 2011 an update was posted on the band&#x27;s Facebook page confirming that they were working on new material. &quot;Our plan is to record our songs in batches and release them for free download as they are completed. This way, we can share new music with you in the most expedient fashion. When we have recorded enough material, we will compile some or all of it into a new album.&quot;

An update posted on August 17, 2012 to Facebook confirmed that the band were set to begin recording again, officially ending their seven-year hiatus.

As of December 2013, the band&#x27;s Facebook page had had no updates since August 2012 relating to the band. It was unclear whether the progress of the new songs was ongoing or at a standstill. However, on April 2, 2014, it was announced via their Facebook page that two brand new songs entitled &quot;Alcologic&quot; and &quot;When I Was Young&quot; respectively, were being made available for free digital download.

The post read:

On April 3 it was announced via their Facebook page that the download attempts had exceeded the free download limit through the host website to the songs, and a direct link was provided alternatively for the download.

With the release of these songs, Autopilot Off has confirmed that although band activity is minimal, they intend to continue playing music together in the future.

On April 9, 2015, Autopilot Off released their third new track entitled &quot;Lining Them Up&quot;.

On September 17th, 2024, Autopilot Off announced their collaboration with Enjoy the Ride Records to release &quot;Alcologic,&quot; &quot;When I Was Young,&quot; and &quot;Lining Them Up&quot; on vinyl as The Encore EP, marking the first physical release of these songs. Make A Sound was later announced to also be receiving a vinyl re-release, as a celebration for the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

<doc id="1060085" wikidata="Q2422698" url="?curid=1060085" title="Starz">
<text>Starz (pronounced &quot;stars&quot;) is an American pay television network owned by Starz Entertainment, and is the flagship property of Starz Inc. Launched in 1994 as a multiplex service of what is now Starz Encore, its programming consists of theatrically released motion pictures and first-run original television series. Starz operates six 24-hour, linear multiplex channels; a traditional subscription video on demand service; and a namesake over-the-top streaming platform that both acts as a TV Everywhere offering for Starz&#x27;s linear television subscribers and is sold directly to streaming-only consumers. It is the first pay television network to operate an OTT streaming platform, with the second being MGM+ (formerly Epix) after being acquired by Amazon.

Starz is also sold independently of traditional and over-the-top multichannel video programming distributors a la carte through Apple TV Channels and Amazon Video Channels, which feature VOD library content and live feeds of Starz&#x27;s linear television services (consisting of the primary channel&#x27;s East and West Coast feeds and, for Amazon Video customers, the East Coast feeds of its five multiplex channels). Starz&#x27;s programming has been licensed for use by a number of channels and platforms worldwide, and the brand name is licensed by Bell Media for a companion channel of the Canada-based company&#x27;s Crave premium service.

Starz and its sister networks, the aforementioned Starz Encore and MoviePlex, are headquartered in Santa Monica, California, with satellite office facilities located at the Meridian International Business Center complex in Englewood, Colorado, and at a small office located on 5th Avenue in New York City. , Starz was available to approximately 28.517 million American households that had a subscription to a multichannel television provider (27.675 million of which receive Starz&#x27;s primary channel at minimum). Starz streaming platform had 26.3 million subscribers as of 2022.

==History==
===Launch and early history ===
Starz (initially stylized as &quot;STARZ!&quot; with an exclamation point) was launched at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 1, 1994, primarily on cable systems operated by Tele-Communications Inc.; the first two movies aired on the network were dramas released in 1992: respectively, &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; and &quot;The Crying Game&quot;. The network was operated as a joint venture between TCI and Liberty Media (both companies were controlled by John Malone), with TCI owning a 50.1% controlling interest in the channel.

Starz made its debut as the first phase of a seven-channel thematic multiplex that was launched by Starz (then Encore Media Group) over the course of the succeeding eight months, with the remaining six channels being launched between July and September 1994. The multiplex was intended to only include six channels, but on May 31, 1993, Encore acquired the pay cable rights to broadcast recent feature films from Universal Pictures released after that year; as a result, TCI/Liberty decided to create an additional premium pay-TV service to serve as a competitor to HBO and Showtime. The network carried the moniker &quot;Encore 8&quot; in its on-air branding as part of a numbering system that was used by Encore&#x27;s multiplex channels. Early trademark filings indicated that TCI/Liberty&#x27;s proposed names including &quot;Applause&quot; and &quot;Stars&quot; for the service (the &quot;s&quot; in the latter was ultimately changed to a &quot;z&quot; in the final naming).

Starz focused more on recent feature films, while Starz Encore (then Encore) focused on films released between the 1960s and the 1980s, before adding recent film fare itself in July 1999. It also held the television rights to releases from Carolco Pictures, New Line Cinema (as well as its sibling labels Fine Line Features and Turner Pictures), and the Disney–owned studios Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures and Miramax Films. Films from those studios were not carried on Starz until 1997, after Disney&#x27;s output agreement with Showtime for its non-family-oriented films concluded. The network restricted the scheduling of films that contained graphic sexual or violent content to late evening and overnight time periods.

Starz&#x27;s availability was mainly limited to TCI&#x27;s systems at launch, debuting with a one-month free preview available to prospective subscribers; it would eventually sign its first major carriage agreement outside the TCI group, through a deal with Continental Cablevision in September 1995. Starz was available to an estimated 2.8 million pay television subscribers by 1996, only one million of whom had subscribed to a cable or satellite provider other than TCI. As a startup network, Starz endured major losses during its early years, with total deficits topping US$203 million and annual losses of US$150 million by 1997. It was predicted to lose an additional US$300 million in revenue before it was predicted to break even. 

In June 1997, Comcast signed an agreement to carry the network on its Pennsylvania and New Jersey systems to replace Philadelphia-based PRISM after that network shut down that October following the loss of its (and sister network SportsChannel Philadelphia&#x27;s) sports programming to Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia. Partly in an effort to get the network&#x27;s substantial losses off its books, TCI announced a deal on June 2, 1997, in which it transferred majority ownership of the corporate entity that operated Starz, Encore Media Group, to sister company Liberty Media; TCI retained a 20% minority ownership interest in Encore Media Group. Liberty Media assumed the former company&#x27;s stake in the subsidiary in 1999, following TCI&#x27;s merger with AT&amp;T Corporation. By May 1998, Starz maintained a subscriber base reaching 7.6 million households with a cable or satellite television subscription.

=== 2000s onwards ===
The network gained carriage deals with many other major American cable and satellite providers by the early 2000s, particularly with the adoption of digital cable, allowing for providers to add channels that they (even with capacity expansions of up to 60 channels) previously had limited room to carry. Encore Media Group was renamed the Starz Encore Media Group in 2000. As part of a corporate restructuring plan in 2003, Starz Encore Group eliminated 100 jobs in its nine regional offices, and closed four of the offices outright. On March 25, 2005, the Starz Encore Group corporate entity was renamed Starz Entertainment. A few days later, on March 28, 2005, Starz introduced a new logo, and was subsequently rebranded as &quot;starz&quot;, in all lowercase.

On November 19, 2009, Liberty Media spun off Starz into a separate public tracking stock called Liberty Starz. On January 1, 2010, Chris Albrecht joined Starz as its president and chief executive officer, then overseeing all of the Starz entities including Starz Entertainment, Overture Films, Anchor Bay Entertainment and Film Roman. On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off the Liberty Starz subsidiary into a separate publicly traded company. The spin-off of the subsidiary was completed on January 11, 2013, with Liberty Starz changing its name to Starz as a result.
On April 5, 2016, Starz was rebranded, introducing a new logo, this time stylized as &quot;STARZ&quot; in all uppercase. As part of the rebranding, Starz added all the Encore channels to its moniker, therefore increasing the Starz channel lineup to 14 Starz premium channels. Its main channel was rebranded Starz Encore and carries reruns of Starz Originals in addition to films. On June 30, 2016, Lionsgate agreed to acquire Starz Inc. for $4.4 billion in cash and stock; the acquisition was completed five months later on December 8.

In April 2019, Starz was widely criticized in the tech press and by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending legal demands to Twitter in order to remove links to a news article which discussed piracy but contained neither pirated content nor links to pirated content. Starz initially responded by issuing further DMCA complaints against those criticizing them, including against a tweet from the Electronic Frontier Foundation stating that &quot;Starz should withdraw its takedown and refrain from harassing journalists&quot;. However, they subsequently apologized, clarified that the invalid DMCA claims were sent on their behalf by a third-party contractor called The Social Element and promised that they are &quot;working with our vendors to reinstate any such content that was inappropriately targeted for removal.&quot; Lionsgate was renamed to Starz Entertainment in 2024, 6 months after spinning off most of their businesses into a new company known as Lionsgate Studios.

==Channels==

===List of channels===
Depending on the service provider, Starz provides up to twelve multiplex channels – six 24-hour multiplex channels, all of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition – as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (Starz On Demand). Starz broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main Starz channel), resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.

The premium film services Encore and MoviePlex, which are also owned by Starz, Inc., operate as separate services; as such, subscribers to one of the services do not have to subscribe to any of the others. Some providers offer Encore and MoviePlex&#x27;s multiplex channels on a separate digital cable tier from Starz. However, Encore and, depending on its carriage, MoviePlex are frequently sold together in a package with Starz.

====Background====
In 1994, Encore launched the pay television industry&#x27;s first &quot;themed&quot; multiplex service – seven additional movie channels that each focused on a specific genre. This was intended to include only six channels, but Encore decided to launch Starz as a competitor to HBO and Showtime after it acquired the pay-TV rights to broadcast films by Universal Studios released after 1993. A numbering system was used for each service to identify itself as an Encore channel, though this system was abandoned for most of the channels in 1996, with the tagline &quot;an encore network&quot; (which Starz! also used, albeit sparingly) being used from then until 2002. Starz continued to heavily include the &quot;Encore 8&quot; moniker in its main IDs, feature presentation bumpers and select bumpers until 2002, even as it transitioned into a separate channel from Encore.

The tie to Encore branding-wise continued even as Starz was given its own slate of multiplex channels in the late 1990s. The first of these to debut was Starz! 2 in 1996, maintaining a set lineup of four different movies scheduled at the same times each day (inspired by the scheduling used by movie theaters) with the slate of films changing each Friday. This was followed in 1997 by the debut of a joint venture with BET Networks called BET Movies: Starz! 3. Two additional multiplex channels began operations in May 1999. Starz! Family carried family-oriented theatrical and home video film releases, was launched possibly in response to HBO&#x27;s own family-oriented multiplex channel, HBO Family, which debuted three years earlier. The other service was Starz! Cinema, a channel featuring critically acclaimed independent films and movies outside the mainstream cinema. Starz! 2 was also renamed Starz! Theater to better reflect its format.

The first changes made following the original rollout of the multiplex occurred in 2001, with the rebranding of BET Movies: Starz! as Black Starz! after BET withdrew from the partnership during its acquisition by Viacom (which owned rival pay service Showtime at the time) in 2001. A seventh Starz multiplex channel was launched in 2004: Starz! Kids was created as a movie service featuring films aimed at children between 2 and 11 years of age, maintaining a format similar to that of Starz! Family. Unlike the other Starz multiplex channels, Starz! Kids was launched on cable systems on a case-by-case basis instead of on a broader national scale.

The entire multiplex was overhauled on March 28, 2005, as part of an extensive rebranding of the Starz and Encore services. While Encore debuted a slightly modified logo and applied the &quot;Encore&quot; brand to the names of its six multiplex channels, Starz underwent a more dramatic makeover, with a completely redesigned logo – which included the exclamation mark being dropped from the channel&#x27;s name – and a standardized graphics package that was implemented across all of its channels (with some modifications for each channel&#x27;s format). The programming formats of several channels changed entirely: Starz! Theater was relaunched as Starz Edge, a movie channel aimed primarily at men 18 to 34 years old (nicknamed &quot;The New Generation&quot; by the channel). Starz! Kids and Starz! Family were combined into a single channel called Starz Kids and Family, to make room for a new channel focusing on comedic feature films called Starz Comedy. Black Starz! also changed its name to Starz InBlack. The only multiplex channel (other than the primary feed) that retained its original name was Starz Cinema.

The Starz multiplex has been marketed under several names over the years including the &quot;Starz Encore Super Pak&quot; and the &quot;Starz Super Pak&quot;. The multiplex now has no &quot;official&quot; marketed name .

On March 28, 2016, Starz introduced a new logo and tagline, &quot;Obsessable&quot;. This coincided with a revamp of the Starz channels effective April 5 of that year, with all of Encore&#x27;s channels taking on the &quot;Starz&quot; brand, and Encore&#x27;s main channel being rebranded &quot;Starz Encore&quot;, and airing reruns of Starz originals in addition to films. Starz now has 14 channels in its package.

===Other services===

====Starz HD====
Starz HD is a high-definition simulcast feed of Starz that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. In addition to its main channel, Starz also operates high-definition simulcast feeds of its five multiplex channels. When it was launched in December 2003, the simulcast covered only the east and west coast feeds of the main Starz channel. An enhanced-definition simulcast feed and a separate HD channel called Sharper Movies HD, that would have broadcast in the 1080i format and be structured similarly to the original format of sister channel Encore&#x27;s MoviePlex (in which Sharper Movies would broadcast programming from each Starz channel in daily sampler blocks), were also planned. Plans for the latter service were dropped because of a lack of interest from providers to charge a premium fee for the network. HD feeds of Starz Kids and Family, Starz Comedy and Starz Edge, followed in 2007.

The remaining Starz multiplex channels, Starz Cinema and Starz In Black, launched their HD simulcast feeds on June 23, 2010, with DirecTV becoming the first provider to offer all six channels (including both coastal feeds of the primary Starz channel) in HD. Among others, Starz HD is carried nationally by satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network and regionally by Verizon FiOS, AT&amp;T U-verse, Comcast Xfinity, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications, Cablevision and Charter Communications.

====Starz On Demand====
Starz operates a video-on-demand (VOD) television service called Starz On Demand, which is available at no additional charge to new and existing Starz subscribers. The service was launched on September 19, 2001, debuting on Adelphia Communications&#x27; Cleveland, Ohio, system. The service offers early premieres of feature films that are scheduled to premiere on Starz, up to one month prior to their pay cable debut on the primary linear channel. Starz on Demand&#x27;s rotating program selection incorporates selected new titles that are added each Friday, and existing program titles held over from the previous one to two weeks. The Starz On Demand name was also used for an online broadband streaming movie service operated by Starz and RealNetworks from 2003 to 2004. In March 2011, Starz On Demand launched a third VOD service (in addition to its standard-definition and high-definition VOD services), offering movies presented in 3D to customers of Comcast and Verizon FiOS at no additional charge.

====Starzplay (U.S.)====
The original incarnation of Starzplay was a website and mobile app that featured original programming and feature film content from Starz available for streaming in standard or high definition. It was available to Starz subscribers of Verizon FIOS, AT&amp;T U-verse, Cox Communications, Xfinity by Comcast and DirecTV until it was merged with Starz.com on April 5, 2016. The former incarnation of the Starzplay online service (which is structured as a TV Everywhere-style service) was launched on October 8, 2012, with the release of the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch app until they were merged with Starz.com on April 5, 2016.

The Starzplay name was borrowed from a prior service offered in conjunction with Netflix. It was created in 2008 after the subscription streaming service struck an agreement with Starz Entertainment to allow Netflix to sub-license rights to films from distributors that maintain output deals with the linear Starz channel for online viewing – in lieu of acquiring the digital distribution rights on its own, due to the expense of acquiring newer film titles – as Netflix was considered to be merely a &quot;content aggregator&quot;. Because Netflix chose to sub-license digital rights through Starz instead of negotiating with the studios, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures threatened not to renew its output deal with Starz unless it either discontinued its deal with Netflix or paid Disney a licensing fee for digital streaming rights to its films (Netflix ended up assuming rights to most film releases by Walt Disney Studios from Starz in 2016).

Starzplay (as a Netflix service) was first made available to Starz subscribers of the Verizon FiOS television service. Starz content (including most of its original programming and series content that the channel acquired through domestic and international distributors) was made available on Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Watch Instantly&quot; platform. It was the third subscription video-on-demand online streaming service operated by Starz: Starz Ticket operated from 2004 to 2006, under a joint venture between Starz Entertainment and RealNetworks. Starz launched Vongo, a separate online movie service for subscribers, which operated from 2006 until it was discontinued on September 30, 2008.

On September 1, 2011, Starz announced that it would not renew its streaming agreement with Netflix, which ended on February 28, 2012; movie titles that are available on DVD from Sony Pictures, Disney and other studios that maintain pay television distribution deals with Starz were not affected and can be acquired from Netflix by this method. With the expiration of the Netflix deal, film content from studios with which Starz maintains broadcast rights were no longer available for online streaming, particularly as Netflix and certain similar services such as Vudu did not have separate streaming rights to films from these individual studios. Prior to the beta launch of its Starz Online service (which became Starzplay upon its official launch), Starz announced on November 18, 2011, that it was developing a streaming application for mobile devices, allowing the network&#x27;s subscribers – and in early reports, speculation that possibly non-subscription television subscribers would be allowed as well – to view Starz&#x27;s series and film content. The app was released on October 9, 2012, for the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch, and on May 7, 2013, for Android devices. An app for authenticated subscribers for the Xbox 360 was released on December 3, 2013, followed by a similar app for the Xbox One on August 5, 2014.

==== Lionsgate+ ====

Lionsgate+ (previously Starzplay), Starzplay Arabia, and Lionsgate Play (in the south and Southeast Asia region) were Starz&#x27; international streaming services for viewers outside North America.

Starzplay Arabia was the first Starz-branded service to be localized outside the United States, launching on April 2, 2015, in 17 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, breaching those territories before its biggest competitor in media streaming being Netflix. Starzplay Arabia remains available even as the U.S. version of the service has been discontinued. In 2018, the service became available in Pakistan, as a joint venture between Cinepax, a cinema chain in Pakistan, and Lionsgate&#x27;s StarzPlay Arabia. In 2019, Starzplay was launched in Brazil, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom. In 2020, it became available in Argentina, Chile, and Italy. In March 2022, a 57% majority stake in Starzplay Arabia was acquired by a consortium, led by e&amp; (formerly known as Etisalat) and the Abu Dhabi-based investment group ADQ. The deal was valued at $420m. In January 2021, Starzplay Arabia signed a deal with Abu Dhabi Media, which allows subscribers to watch UFC fights and events live.

In several countries, Lionsgate+ is provided through partnerships with cable services, such as Vodafone in Spain, Movistar TV in Argentina, IndiHome in Indonesia and PLDT Home in the Philippines or within Apple TV as well.

On September 28, 2022, Lionsgate announced the international Starzplay service would be rebranded as Lionsgate+ the following day in most countries, eliminating much of the conflict between Lionsgate and Disney&#x27;s Star brand. The Starzplay Arabia and Lionsgate Play services will not be affected at this time, while Starz in the U.S. and Canada merely rebranded with a new version of the &quot;STARZ&quot; logo.

In November 2022, it was announced that Lionsgate+ was ending operations in the markets of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Benelux, the Nordics, and Japan before the end of the company&#x27;s fiscal year.

In August 2023, Lionsgate announced that Lionsgate+ will leave Latin America on December 31, 2023. In November, the shutdown date was changed to December 11, 2023, while customers who have accessed Lionsgate+ through Amazon Prime Video would have continued to access to streaming until February 9, 2024.

On November 4, 2023, Lionsgate announced that Lionsgate+ would cease its operations in the UK in early 2024. On December 19, it was confirmed that the shutdown date will be on February 29, 2024.

====Starz app and subscription service====
On April 5, 2016, Starz launched a new app and over-the-top subscription service to compete with HBO Now and Showtime&#x27;s OTT subscription service. The new app, which replaced the StarzPlay service, allowed users to access Starz programming regardless of whether they had a TV package or not. The Starz app also includes offline playback functionality, allowing users to download and watch content without an internet connection.

In response to the discontinuation of StarzPlay, Comcast has blocked access to the new Starz app for Comcast Xfinity customers, forcing them to instead access the network&#x27;s authenticated content through the Xfinity app and website and older StarzPlay apps on platforms such as Roku. Currently, Comcast is the only major distributor to do this.

====Starz on Amazon Video====
In the winter of 2015, Amazon Video began offering Starz and rival premium network Showtime as add-on subscriptions for their customers; the cost is $8.99 per month, after a seven-day free trial. The content deal between Amazon and Starz not only offers the channel&#x27;s current and back catalog of programming, but also movies and classic TV series currently airing on Encore and its branded networks, as well as live East Coast feeds of the Starz-branded networks and Encore.

==Programming==
===Film library===
, Starz and sister networks Starz Encore and MoviePlex maintain exclusive first-run film licensing agreements with Lionsgate Films (since 2022, including Summit Entertainment since 2023) and Universal Pictures (since 2022, after each films&#x27; 18 month window on Peacock and Amazon Prime Video).

On March 2, 2021, Lionsgate announced films from Lionsgate Films would air on Starz for first-run rights starting in 2022, except Summit Entertainment which would start airing on Starz in 2023 after output deals with Hulu and HBO expired at the end of 2021 and 2022 respectively. On July 15, 2021, Starz reached a licensing deal with Universal Pictures for first-run movies 18 months after they streamed on Peacock and Amazon Prime Video respectively.

Despite being acquired by Lions Gate Entertainment in 2016, films released under the Lionsgate label did not air on Starz until 2022 due to an output deal with Epix until the end of 2019, then Hulu until the end of 2021. Summit Entertainment films did not air on Starz until 2023 due to an output deal with HBO until the end of 2022.

Starz also shows sub-runs (runs of films that have recently received broadcast or syndicated television airings) of theatrical films from Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (including subsidiaries Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Hollywood Pictures - all for films released before 2016), Warren Miller Films (for films released before 2020), Sony Pictures Entertainment (including subsidiaries Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Classics, Screen Gems, Destination Films, Triumph Films, and TriStar Pictures - all for films released before 2022), Warner Bros. Discovery (including content from subsidiaries Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, Turner Entertainment – both for films released prior to 2005 – and Castle Rock Entertainment), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (including content from subsidiaries United Artists, Orion Pictures, and The Samuel Goldwyn Company), Europa Corp, Paramount Pictures (including content from DreamWorks Pictures (pre-2011), Republic Pictures, Nickelodeon Movies, Dimension Films (pre-2005), Miramax, Paramount Vantage and television rights to the Cannon Films and Carolco Pictures libraries), Revolution Studios, Overture Films, Yari Film Group, and the network&#x27;s sister company Lions Gate Entertainment (since 2012).

Films for which Starz has pay-cable rights usually also run on Encore and MoviePlex during the duration of its term of licensing. From 1995 to 2002, Starz had broadcast occasional original made-for-pay cable movies produced by the in-house company Starz! Pictures.

====Former first-run contracts====
At the time of its launch, Starz had secured exclusive first-run film rights with Universal Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures, Miramax Films, New Line Cinema, Walt Disney Pictures, and Carolco Pictures. Between 1995 and 2005, Starz had also broadcast films from Turner Pictures and New Line Cinema. Starz&#x27;s contract with Universal Pictures expired in late 2002, with HBO and Starz sharing half of Universal Pictures&#x27; films during the 2003 calendar year before HBO assumed pay television rights in 2004.

In 1997, Starz lost its rights to many of the Dimension Films to Showtime, due to its violent content surrounding the films, except for several future Jackie Chan films Dimension released, which Starz kept the rights. After the Showtime deal, in August 1999, Starz preemptively signed a four-year deal with Dimension Films that took effect in January 2003, in conjunction with a four-year extension of its existing deal with Miramax Films and the rest of the Disney family. In 2002, Starz picked up the pay TV rights to Disney&#x27;s animated films, which previously bypassed a pay TV window.

In January 1997, Starz secured a licensing agreement with Paramount Pictures, broadcasting over 300 titles. Paramount Pictures&#x27; first contract with Starz expired in January 2006. In April 2013, Starz reassumed sub-run rights to Paramount Pictures&#x27; feature film releases. Films that were initially broadcast through this deal included &quot;Dear God&quot;, &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot; and &quot;Boomerang&quot;.

The first-run film output agreement with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures expired after December 2015, with Netflix assuming pay television rights in January 2016 (excluding films released by Touchstone Pictures, which were retained by Starz through a separate contract). Through at least the first half of 2016, Starz provided Disney films that were released before the expiration, such as &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;The Good Dinosaur&quot;, but none released after, such as &quot;Zootopia&quot;.

The first-run film output agreement with Sony was renewed for nine years on February 11, 2013 and expired at the end of 2021. On April 8, 2021, Sony announced that they would not be renewing the agreement with Starz in favor of a new first-run agreement with Netflix.

The Warren Miller output deal was renewed for 10 years on October 19, 2009, and the deal ended in 2019.

===Television series===

====Original programming====

Starz expanded its program offerings to include some original television series by the late 1990s, with five entertainment news programs and shows that focused on the making of upcoming or current feature films (such as &quot;Starz Movie News&quot; and &quot;Hollywood One on One&quot;); some of these programs were also aired on Encore. These shows and documentaries were produced under the name Starz Encore Entertainment, which was formed in 1999. In 2005, Starz began expanding its original programming slate in order to compete with rivals Showtime and HBO, with the inclusion of scripted series. Starz Encore Entertainment was renamed Starz Originals. Some of the initial series (such as &quot;Kung Faux&quot;, &quot;The Bronx Bunny Show&quot; and &quot;Head Case&quot;) maintained running times considered unconventional for a live-action series, usually running under 15 minutes in length; half-hour and hour-long series were eventually incorporated on the schedule by 2010 (including shows such as &quot;Spartacus, &quot; in 2011, &quot;Boss&quot; and &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Demons&quot;).

The number of original series that debuted each year on Starz has varied, reaching a high of four series during the 2011 calendar year. In 2013, Starz gave a series order to &quot;Outlander&quot;, a drama based on the &quot;Outlander&quot; book series by Diana Gabaldon. The project, from &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; developer Ronald D. Moore and Sony Pictures Television, received a 16-episode order, with production beginning in Scotland (where the books are set) in October 2013. &quot;Outlander&quot; has received five nominations for the 2015 Women&#x27;s Image Network Awards, including a nomination in the Drama Series category. Caitriona Balfe, who plays the leading character in the show, also received a nomination in the Actress Drama Series category.

After Starz&#x27;s 2016 acquisition by Lionsgate, the network has moved to produce more original content, with president of programming Carmi Zlotnik calling Starz a &quot;content pump&quot; for Lionsgate.

====Acquired programming====
Multiplex channel Starz Kids &amp; Family also features some series programming, which are aimed at young children and pre-teens. That channel runs two program blocks: &quot;Building Blocks&quot;, a block airing on Monday through Saturday mornings that features animated series (such as &quot;Dragon Hunters&quot;, &quot;Gawayn&quot;, &quot;Zombie Hotel&quot;, &quot;Savage Family Wild&quot; and &quot;Matt&#x27;s Monsters&quot;) and the &quot;Six Block&quot; (originally titled &quot;Camp Block&quot; from its launch in March 2011 until the two-hour block was moved from mid-afternoon slots varying on the film schedule to a set timeslot of 6:00 pm Eastern Time in January 2012), a teenage-focused block airing weekday afternoons that features mainly imported series from English-speaking countries outside of America like Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom (such as &quot;Wingin&#x27; It&quot;, 
&quot;Genie in the House&quot;, &quot;Majority Rules&quot; and &quot;Sadie J&quot;). The two blocks are similar to those seen on sister channel Encore&#x27;s multiplex channel Encore Wam between 1994 and 2009.

==Other ventures==
Starz Entertainment has expanded considerably with the presence of its Starz and Encore family of multiplex networks, as well as ventures into television and film production, and home video distribution.

* In 1994, Starz launched the in-house company Starz Pictures, a production company that produced made-for-cable films for the television channel; Starz Pictures&#x27; only major film project was the 2002 telefilm &quot;Joe and Max&quot;. Starz Pictures shut down that same year.
* In 2006, Liberty Media purchased IDT Entertainment, which was merged into Starz Entertainment and renamed Starz Media. As a result of the purchase, Starz acquired IDT subsidiaries Anchor Bay Entertainment, Digital Production Solutions (DPS), and New Arc Entertainment. The Weinstein Company, a film studio run by former Miramax heads Bob and Harvey Weinstein, purchased a 25% stake in Starz Media (but not the Starz parent company) on January 4, 2011, with Anchor Bay entering into a multi-year domestic distribution agreement of theatrical feature films released by The Weinstein Company and its Dimension Films subsidiary.
* In November 2006, Chris McGurk and Danny Rosett launched Overture Films, an independent movie studio that Liberty Media operated out of its Starz Entertainment division. After a proposed sale of the company failed to materialize through the absence of willing buyers, the studio was shut down in October 2010, with its marketing and distribution operations handed over to Relativity Media; Overture&#x27;s small library of less than 20 films continued to be distributed by Anchor Bay Entertainment for DVD release and by Starz for television broadcast.
* As part of IDT Entertainment&#x27;s purchase by Liberty Media, Starz Entertainment also acquired two animation studios: Toronto-based IDT Entertainment animation studio (formerly DKP Studios), which was renamed Starz Animation, and Manga Entertainment, an international distributor of Japanese animation. Another animation studio that was also acquired due to the IDT purchase, Film Roman, was sold in October 2010 to a production company owned by a group of investors led by former Film Roman studio president Scott Greenberg called Bento Box Entertainment.

==Branding==
Starz&#x27;s logo has incorporated a star in some form since its launch. In the original logo that was used from its launch in February 1994 until March 27, 2005, the star was composed of a two silhouettes (one star cut out from another, larger one), and a 1930s movie-styled &quot;STARZ!&quot; text. The original accompanying graphics were set around a CGI movie theater, with the main network ID featuring seats that opened by themselves, various theater imagery and even images resembling the Caduceus, while feature presentation bumpers heavily used the movie theater themes (using spotlights and film canisters) and the &quot;Encore 8&quot; branding. The &quot;theater&quot; branding used since Starz&#x27;s launch was replaced in May 2002, with a new graphics package based around natural themes (particularly water). A seven-note fanfare was also introduced as a musical motif, however the new look did not carry over to the multiplex channels. Starz! also introduced the &quot;InfoBar&quot;, a lower-third banner graphic that appears on-screen during promotional breaks and during the end credits of films seen on the channel, originally purposed to promote upcoming programs.

The 1994 logo was replaced in March 2005 with an abstract star shooting upwards and a more modern &quot;starz&quot; wordmark in Helvetica Neue. This was part of a major rebrand of the network that included a blue liquid standardized graphics package with a different color such as grey, red, green, purple, and orange for each multiplex channel; the fanfare from the previous graphics package was also re-orchestrated by Mixology Post. The &quot;InfoBar&quot; also began to be used to promote events on the other Starz networks and to provide entertainment news headlines supplied by &quot;Variety&quot; (a similar version was adopted for use by the Encore networks). That year, Starz introduced an opaque on-screen logo bug on the lower-right corner of the screen, appearing for two minutes each half-hour of the movie. Starting in Summer 2007, the 2005 logo bug for every Starz, Encore and Movieplex channel appears throughout the whole movie, until Starz reverted every screenbug back to appearing for two minutes every half hour during the April 2008 rebrand, except for Encore, Movieplex, and Starz Cinema. The introduction of the Starz on-screen logo bugs was cited by former Starz president Tom Southwick due to a large number of subscribers not knowing which of the channels they were watching when they tuned in, particularly if started viewing one of the channels after the start of a film.

The logo was changed in April 2008, with a new &quot;starz&quot; wordmark in a different font, with a star shining between the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;r&quot;. It was introduced in black, but the coloring of the logo was modified to an orange/gold gradient in April 2011. The channel replaced the opaque on-screen logo bugs with a white logo bug on all channels and a bright orange bug for Starz HD as of April 7, 2008, and Starz Kids &amp; Family&#x27;s HD simulcast feed in July 2011. After the 2011 rebrand, the white logo bug for every Starz channel stayed on-screen throughout the whole movie again until the 2013 rebrand, when it reverted to two-minutes every half hour, also applying to Encore channels. After this logo&#x27;s introduction, the &quot;InfoBar&quot; switched back to promoting programming only on the main Starz channel, but it served as a network ID on some of its multiplex channels.

In 2016, Starz redesigned its logo again, with a new uppercase &quot;STARZ&quot; wordmark in black. When it appeared on-screen, it was white against a black background.

In 2022, following the renaming of StarzPlay to Lionsgate+, Starz got a new logo, with a bolder teal wordmark, which appears in a yellow-sky blue gradient on-screen.

<text>A spark arrester (sometimes spark arrestor) is any device which prevents the emission of flammable debris from combustion sources, such as internal combustion engines, fireplaces, and wood-burning stoves.

Spark arresters play a critical role in the prevention of wildland fire and ignition of explosive atmospheres. Consequently, their use is required by law in many jurisdictions worldwide.

== Applications ==

===Engines===

====Steam====
Spark arresters for steam locomotives may be internal (in the form of wire mesh inside the smokebox) or external. The earliest platforms for spark arresters in the United States were steam locomotives. Wood- and coal-burning locomotives produce embers which are readily transported by the wind. One popular design was the Radley–Hunter spark arrester, which used a spiral-shaped cone to separate embers from the exhaust flow by centrifugal force.

The problem of equipment-started fires continued into the 20th century. University of California, Berkeley researchers J.P. Fairbank and Roy Bainer provided the first known academic research on the subject. Their experiments demonstrated that hot particulate matter larger than 0.023 inches (0.584 mm) in diameter was capable of igniting wildland fuels.

====Internal combustion====
In the 1950s, the United States Forest Service became interested in reducing the number of fires started by logging equipment in the National Forest System. This interest led to a partnership with the Society of Automotive Engineers and the development of the following test standards for spark arresters:

* SAE J335 – Multiposition Small Engine Exhaust System Fire Ignition Suppression
* SAE J342 – Spark Arrester Test Procedure for Large Size Engines
* SAE J350 – Spark Arrester Test Procedure for Medium Size Engines

Modern technologies have largely eliminated the production of large particulate matter from internal combustion engines. However, as engines wear, carbon deposits can build up on the internal walls of the engine. When these deposits break free, they exit through the exhaust system and present a potential fire hazard. Vehicles without properly functioning spark arresters have been suspected of starting numerous wildfires, including the devastating track fire near Raton, New Mexico in June 2011.

Today, spark arresters can be found as OEM or aftermarket components on many types of equipment, such as large agricultural machines, off highway vehicles (OHVs), and small engines (chainsaws, string trimmers, leaf blowers, etc.).

===Buildings===
Spark arresters are also fitted to the top of a flue (or a chimney pot) to prevent floating embers from a fire (particularly one burning wood) setting light to a flammable roofing surface (shingle, thatch, or bitumen-felt) or falling onto combustible material on the ground. Such a spark arrester typically consists of a double layer of metal mesh, which catches the ember and allows the flue gas to escape.

Large power station boilers are commonly fitted with electrostatic precipitators.

===Electrical equipment===
== Types ==
===Centrifugal===
Centrifugal type spark arresters employ stationary vanes, baffles, or other devices to trap large particles by centrifugal force. These spark arresters are typically found on heavy agricultural and construction equipment (tractors, combines, bulldozers, etc.), but some have been developed for motorcycles and other all-terrain vehicles.
===Screen===
Screen type spark arresters use a physical mesh to prevent large particles from leaving the exhaust system. This is the simplest and most common type of spark arrester. Screen type devices are used on most motorcycles, ATVs, and small engines.

===Electrostatic precipitator===
== Regulatory requirements==

===United States===

Laws governing spark arrester use in the United States depend on the jurisdiction. Internal combustion engines operating on USDA Forest Service and most other federally managed lands must meet the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations 36 CFR 261.52. This mandate requires the operator to have a certified and properly maintained spark arrester installed at all times. Many state and local land management agencies defer to the federal requirement.

Exemptions exist for automobiles legally registered with their state&#x27;s department of motor vehicles. During periods of extreme fire danger, land managers may prevent the use of all motorized equipment, even if a properly functioning spark arrester is installed. Spark arrester inspections are performed by trained agency law enforcement or fire prevention personnel. They may occur on an individual basis, or as part of an inspection checkpoint during busy recreation weekends. Operators caught using unqualified or modified devices could be cited. Penalties for violating spark arrester laws depend on the issuing agency. If it is determined a noncompliant vehicle was responsible for starting a fire, the operator could be held liable in civil or even criminal court.

Certification testing of spark arresters is performed by the USDA Forest Service Technology and Development Center in San Dimas, CA. The technical requirements are outlined in Forest Service Specification FS5100-1. All spark arresters meeting the requirements of 36 CFR 261.52 must be certified and listed in the USDA Forest Service Spark Arrester Guide. This guide is a comprehensive directory of all qualified products available in the United States, and is published biannually. The Spark Arrester Guide is used by field inspectors and consumers to verify product certification status. Manufacturers pursuing spark arrester qualification in the United States should consult the USDA Forest Service&#x27;s &quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s Submission Procedure&quot; for both general purpose and small engine spark arresters.

<doc id="1060107" wikidata="Q1375977" url="?curid=1060107" title="John Treacy">
<text>John Treacy (born 4 June 1957) is an Irish Olympian and former athlete, now a sporting administrator. He is best known for winning a silver medal in the marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

==Early life==
Treacy was born in Villierstown, County Waterford. He attended St Anne&#x27;s Post-Primary School in Cappoquin, County Waterford, Ireland, running more than seven miles to school every morning. He graduated from Providence College in the United States in 1978.

== Athletic career ==

===Early Cross Country Success===

As a 16 year-old, Treacy finished third in the Junior race of the 1974 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. Treacy then repeated this feat in the 1975 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and in the process helping Ireland to the Silver medal in the Junior Team competition.

Treacy won the 1978 IAAF World Cross Country Championships held in Bellahouston Park in Glasgow. The conditions were difficult with heavy mud on the ground and snow in the air. The following year, Treacy retained his title in the 1979 IAAF World Cross Country Championships Limerick, Ireland. The latter was a well known moment in Irish running history with Treacy winning in his home country in front of 25,000 spectators at Limerick Racecourse.

===1980 Olympics to 1984===

Treacy was known as a tenacious runner who did not have an especially sharp final kick in track races. In the 1978 European Athletics Championships in Prague, he placed 11th in the fast 10,000-metre race and fourth in the slow and tactical 5,000-metre race, losing to Italy&#x27;s Venanzio Ortis by just three tenths of a second. In the 5,000-metre final, he lingered behind Great Britain&#x27;s Nick Rose on the final back straight just after Rose had dropped from the lead group.

 In the 1980 Moscow Olympics, Treacy collapsed in his 10,000-metre heat with only 200 metres left, a victim of heat paralysis and dehydration. Because Treacy had been running in fourth place when he collapsed and because only the top four runners qualified directly for the final from the three heats, his collapse allowed Finnish four-time Olympic champion Lasse Virén, who had been trailing him, to qualify directly for the final. Having recovered from his heat-induced collapse, Treacy placed seventh in the 5,000-metre final of those Olympics.
In the 1983 World Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland, Treacy was eliminated in the 10,000-metre heats.

===1984 Olympics===

In the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, he placed ninth in the 10,000-metre final before crowning his athletics career with a silver medal in the men&#x27;s marathon. Winner Carlos Lopes of Portugal was largely unchallenged for much of the race, with Treacy down the field until entering the top six around the 20-kilometre mark. Treacy continued to work his way up the rankings until entering the Los Angeles Coliseum stadium just behind second-placed British athlete Charlie Spedding. Treacy overtook Spedding with 150m to go, during which the Irish television commentary of Jimmy Magee listed the previous Irish Olympic medal winners up to that time, before culminating: &quot;And for the 13th time, an Olympic medal goes to John Treacy from Villierstown in Waterford, the little man with the big heart.&quot;

Treacy&#x27;s medal was Ireland&#x27;s only medal of the games and placed Ireland 33rd in the final medals table.

===1985 to 1988 Olympics===

In the 1985 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, Treacy finished fifth behind Carlos Lopes who had beaten him in the Olympic Marathon of the previous year.

At the 1986 European Athletics Championships in Stuttgart, he placed sixth in the 10,000-metre race. In the 1987 World Athletics Championships in Rome, he placed twenty-sixth in the 10,000-metre race and thirteenth in the 5,000-metre final.

Heading into the Seoul Olympics, Treacy won the 1988 Great North Run however he failed to finish the marathon at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

===Later Running Career===

After the Seoul Olympics, While he did not win any more major international championships medals, Treacy did win the 1992 Los Angeles Marathon. Treacy also placed 51st in his final Olympic games in Barcelona in 1992 and won the 1993 Dublin Marathon.

Treacy ran competitively until 1995, retiring following a road race held in his honour in Waterford, attended by the other two medalists from the 1984 Olympic marathon, Carlos Lopes and Charlie Spedding.

==Post-running career==
Treacy is currently chief executive of the Irish Sports Council. He is married to Fionnuala and they have four children: Caoimhe, Deirdre, Sean, and Conor.

<text>The Advanced Aeromarine Sierra was an American high-wing, strut-braced, single-seat, glider that was designed and produced by Advanced Aeromarine, as a kit for amateur construction.

==Design and development==
The Sierra was intended as a lightweight and affordable glider with modest performance that could be launched by ultralight aircraft aerotow, auto-tow, winch-launch or bungee launch. It first flew in March 1991.

The aircraft was made from aluminium tube, fabric and composites. Its span wing was supported by a lift strut and jury struts. The glide ratio was 25:1 and had a landing roll of . The landing gear was tandem wheels, plus a tail caster. The completion time from the factory kit was rated as 150 hours.

Although very light, with a standard empty weight of , the Sierra did not qualify under the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles regulations as a hang glider, neither was it foot-launchable. Only one prototype had been reported as completed by December 1998.

==Operational history==
In September 2011 there were no Sierras registered with the US Federal Aviation Administration and it is likely that none exist anymore.
