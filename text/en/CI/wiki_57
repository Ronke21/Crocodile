<text>Jiang Wen (born 5 January 1963) is a Chinese actor, screenwriter, and director. As a director, he is sometimes grouped with the &quot;Sixth Generation&quot; that emerged in the 1990s. Jiang is also well known internationally as an actor, having starred with Gong Li in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s debut film &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; (1986), and more recently as Baze Malbus in the Star Wars film &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016). He is the older brother of fellow actor Jiang Wu.

==Early life, family and education==

Jiang was born in Tangshan to a family of military personnel. He relocated to Beijing at the age of ten. In 1973, he attended Beijing No. 72 Middle School, where he studied alongside Ying Da. In 1980, he entered China&#x27;s foremost acting school, the Central Academy of Drama, graduating in 1984.

==Career==
===Acting===
After graduation from acting school, Jiang was assigned to China Youth Art Institute as an actor. That same year, he started acting both on the stage (with the China Youth Theater) and in films.

Jiang&#x27;s debut role was in the film &quot;The Last Empress&quot;, portraying Puyi. He then starred in &quot;Hibiscus Town&quot; directed by Xie Jin; his role as an intellectual revolutionary earned him the Best Actor Award at the Hundred Flowers Awards. Jiang once again paired with &quot;Hibiscus Town&quot; co-star in the film &quot;Chun Tao&quot; directed by Ling Zifeng. Jiang was cast in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s debut film &quot;Red Sorghum&quot;. He also performed in the France-Chinese film &quot;Tears of the Bridal Sedan&quot; and his first commercial film &quot;The Trial&quot;.

He performed in many television series, becoming especially known for his role in the 1992 television series &quot;A Native of Beijing in New York&quot; (based on the novel &quot;Beijinger in New York&quot;. It made him one of the most popular Chinese actors of his generation.

Hebei hae also starred in &quot;Black Snow&quot; (1990), &quot;Li Lianying: The Imperial Eunuch&quot; (1991), &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Soong Sisters&quot; (1997). Apart from &quot;Red Sorghum&quot;, Jiang also collaborated with Zhang Yimou for the 1997 film &quot;Keep Cool&quot;.

Jiang starred in several films in the early 2000s; namely &quot;The Missing Gun&quot;, &quot;Green Tea&quot;, &quot;My Father and I&quot;, &quot;Warriors of Heaven and Earth&quot;, &quot;Jasmine Women&quot; and &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot;.

Jiang continued acted in television series, such as &quot;Da Qing Fengyun&quot; (2006), in which he played Hong Taiji. He also played notable historical figures, Mao Renfeng in the propaganda film &quot;The Founding of a Republic&quot;; and Cao Cao in the historical war film &quot;The Lost Bladesman&quot;.

Jiang co-starred in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; anthology film &quot;Rogue One&quot;, released in December 2016. In the film, he portrays Baze Malbus, a native of the moon of Jedha who is drawn into the war against the Galactic Empire.

Jiang is set to return to the small screen in the historical drama &quot;Cao Cao&quot;.

===Writing and directing===
Jiang wrote and directed his first film in 1994, &quot;In the Heat of the Sun&quot;, adapted from a novel by Wang Shuo. A tale set in the Cultural Revolution, it won for its young lead actor Xia Yu the Best Actor prize at the Venice Film Festival and garnered six Golden Horse Awards in Taiwan.

In 2000, Jiang co-wrote and directed the black comedy film &quot;Devils on the Doorstep&quot;. The film premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival and clinched the Grand Prix but was subsequently banned in its home country; said to undermine the country because it &quot;seriously distorts Chinese history&quot;. Jiang himself was banned from making films for seven years. In 2001 he was a member of the jury at the 23rd Moscow International Film Festival.

Jiang returned with his fourth feature &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; in 2007; a fantasy realism film which contains a polyptych of interconnected stories in different time-zones; the film received positive reviews from critics but bombed at the box office. He then collaborated with 10 other directors on the romance anthology film &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;.

Jiang&#x27;s fifth feature, a Western-styled action comedy &quot;Let the Bullets Fly&quot; set a box office record by becoming the fastest Chinese-language film to break RMB100m mark ($15.15m) in Chinese cinemas; and received critical acclaim.

In 2013 he was named as a member of the jury at the 70th Venice International Film Festival.

In 2014, Jiang directed the action comedy film &quot;Gone with the Bullets&quot;, which screened at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival. In 2018, Jiang directed the Republican-era spy comedy &quot;Hidden Man&quot;. The film was China&#x27;s submission to the 91st Academy Awards. These two films together with &quot;Let the Bullets Fly&quot; form his gangster Beiyang trilogy.

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===

Jiang Wen&#x27;s father is Jiang Hongqi, a veteran of the Korean War. Described as taciturn and bookish, he played a minor role in his son&#x27;s 2011 film, &quot;Let the Bullets Fly&quot;. Jiang&#x27;s mother Gao Yang — “a cheerful, extroverted woman” — worked as a piano teacher. Jiang Wen is the eldest son in the family; in addition to his younger brother, Jiang Wu, he has a younger sister, Jiang Huan.

Close to his family, Jiang has a deep bond with his parents: whenever he is on site for shooting or acting, he arranges for them to come to his workplace so that he can spend time with them. Each movie he makes, he saves the best seats for them and asks for their opinions. Even on artistic composition, he sometimes resorts to them for advice. It was his parents&#x27; endorsement on the original novel of &quot;A Native of Beijing in New York&quot; that propelled Jiang into his performance. Later, during the filming of his first feature film, &quot;In the Heat of the Sun&quot;, Jiang again considered their evaluation of Xia Yu, before settling on him as the leading actor.

=== Relationships ===

Jiang met his first partner, Liu Xiaoqing during the production of his debut film &quot;Hibiscus Town&quot;. As he was 23 and she was 31, their relationship was controversial in the entertainment industry at that time, although it was reported that the crew was very supportive of their relationship. Liu Xiaoqing never confirmed the relationship, but only claimed that the media pressure was so suffocating that she once considered going abroad. Years later at one ceremony, Director Xie Jin finally verified this rumor, revealing that they had actually lived together for three years. Liu and Jiang separated amicably in 1994.

In 1995, Jiang began a relationship with Sandrine Chenivesse, a Doctor of Anthropology at the University of Paris, researching philosophy and Taoism in China, at an artistic event. They married in Paris in 1997 and had a daughter together, but the marriage remained discreet until their appearance on the red carpet of the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. In 2005, Chenivesse announced their divorce, citing long-distance separation as the cause.

In 2001, during the filming of &quot;Warriors of Heaven and Earth,&quot; Jiang was introduced to cast member Zhou Yun, by fellow actress Zhao Wei. Later, Jiang recommended Zhou to the cast of &quot;The Music Box,&quot; but each left the crew after a creative difference between Jiang and the director Chen Yifei. Jiang and Zhou married in 2005 and have two sons together.

<doc id="1063259" wikidata="Q688807" url="?curid=1063259" title="Battle of Dinwiddie Court House">
<text>The Battle of Dinwiddie Court House was fought on March 31, 1865, during the American Civil War at the end of the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign and in the beginning stage of the Appomattox Campaign. Along with the Battle of White Oak Road which was fought simultaneously on March 31, the battle involved the last offensive action by General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Confederate Army of Northern Virginia attempting to stop the progress of Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Union Army (Army of the Potomac, Army of the Shenandoah and Army of the James). Grant&#x27;s forces were moving to cut the remaining Confederate supply lines and to force the Confederates to extend their defensive lines at Petersburg, Virginia and Richmond, Virginia to the breaking point, if not to force them into a decisive open field battle.

On March 29, 1865, a large Union cavalry force of between approximately 9,000 and 12,000 troopers moved toward Dinwiddie Court House, Virginia about west of the end of the Confederate lines and about south of the important road junction at Five Forks, Virginia. Under the command of Major General Philip Sheridan, and still designated the Army of the Shenandoah, the Union force consisted of the First Division under Brigadier General Thomas Devin and the Third Division of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer under the overall command of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Wesley Merritt as an unofficial corps commander, and the Second Division, detached from the Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General George Crook. Five Forks was a key location for control of the critical Confederate supply line of the South Side Railroad (sometimes shown as Southside Railroad). While Devin&#x27;s and Crook&#x27;s divisions reached Dinwiddie Court House in the late afternoon of March 29, Custer&#x27;s division was protecting the bogged down wagon train about behind the other two divisions.

Also on March 29, 1865, the Union V Corps under Major General Gouverneur K. Warren moved to the end of the Confederate White Oak Road Line, the far right flank of the Confederate defenses. Warren&#x27;s corps seized control of advance Confederate picket or outpost positions and occupied a segment of a key transportation and communication route, the Boydton Plank Road, at the junction of the Quaker Road, as a result of the Battle of Lewis&#x27;s Farm. After a day of pushing the Union line forward on March 30, Warren&#x27;s force was driven back temporarily on March 31 by a surprise Confederate attack. The V Corps rallied and regained their position on the Boydton Plank Road, cutting direct communication over the White Oak Road between the Confederate defensive line and Major General George Pickett&#x27;s task force about west at Five Forks, during the afternoon of March 31 at the Battle of White Oak Road. At the end of the day, the V Corps remained the closest Union infantry corps to Sheridan&#x27;s position.

At the same time on March 31, Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry force deployed north from Dinwiddie Court House in a movement aimed at occupying Five Forks. Sheridan was thrown on the defensive by an attack by both Confederate infantry and cavalry under Major General George Pickett and Major General Fitzhugh Lee. Sheridan&#x27;s men gave way at various locations during the day but fought long and hard delaying actions, keeping their organization after withdrawals and inflicting hundreds of casualties on the Confederates. Finally reinforced by Custer with two brigades of his division under Colonels Alexander C. M. Pennington, Jr. and Henry Capehart which were brought forward from wagon train guard duty, the Union cavalry divisions at Dinwiddie Court House held their line just north of the town. Sheridan&#x27;s force appeared to be in peril by nightfall due to the threatening position of the strong Confederate force just outside the village. During the night of March 31, however, Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett&#x27;s brigade of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin&#x27;s First Division of the V Corps, followed hours later by Warren&#x27;s entire corps, maneuvered Pickett back to Five Forks by advancing on his flank before he could take advantage of his advanced position the next day. By 7:00 a.m., Sheridan had a corps of infantry as well as his cavalry to proceed against Five Forks.

The battles at White Oak Road and Dinwiddie Court House, while initially successful for the Confederates, and even yielding a tactical victory at the end of the day at Dinwiddie, ultimately did not advance the Confederate position or achieve their strategic objective of weakening and driving back the Union forces or separating Sheridan&#x27;s force from support. The Confederates suffered at least 1,560 casualties to their dwindling forces in the two battles. The battles of March 31 and the troop movements in their aftermath set the stage for the Confederate defeats and the collapse of Confederate defensive lines at the Battle of Five Forks on the following day, April 1, 1865, and at the Third Battle of Petersburg (also known as the Breakthrough at Petersburg) on April 2, 1865. The evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond on the night of April 2–3 and march west of the Confederate Army, with the Union Army in close pursuit, ultimately led to the surrender of Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865.

==Background==

===Military situation===

====Siege of Petersburg====

During the 292-day Richmond–Petersburg Campaign (Siege of Petersburg) Union General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant had to conduct a campaign of trench warfare and attrition in which the Union forces tried to wear down the less numerous Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, destroy or cut off sources of supply and supply lines to Petersburg and Richmond and extend the defensive lines which the outnumbered and declining Confederate force had to defend to the breaking point. After the Battle of Hatcher&#x27;s Run on February 5–7, 1865 extended the armies&#x27; lines another , Lee had few reserves after manning the lengthened Confederate defenses. Lee knew he must soon move part or all of his army from the Richmond and Petersburg lines, obtain food and supplies at Danville, Virginia or possibly Lynchburg, Virginia and join General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s force opposing Major General William T. Sherman&#x27;s army in North Carolina. Lee thought that if the Confederates could quickly defeat Sherman, they might turn back to oppose Grant before he could combine his forces with Sherman&#x27;s. Lee began preparations for the army&#x27;s movement and informed Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate States Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge of his evaluation and plan.

Lee was aware that Sherman&#x27;s army moving through North Carolina might combine with Grant&#x27;s army at Petersburg if Johnston&#x27;s army could not stop Sherman and that his own declining army could not hold the Richmond and Petersburg defenses much longer. In support of his plan to hold off Grant as long as possible and then gain at least a time advantage in his planned move, during March 1865, Lee considered and finally accepted a plan by Major General John Brown Gordon to launch an attack on Union Fort Stedman. The objective would be to break the Union lines east of Petersburg, or at least to compel the Union forces to shorten their lines by gaining significant ground in a substantial and damaging attack. This was expected to permit Lee to shorten his lines and send a large force to help Johnston, or if necessary give the Confederates a head start in evacuating Richmond and Petersburg and combining Lee&#x27;s entire force with Johnston&#x27;s dwindling army.

Gordon&#x27;s surprise attack on Fort Stedman in the pre-dawn hours of March 25, 1865
ultimately failed with the Confederates suffering about 4,000 casualties, including about 1,000 captured, which the Confederates could ill afford. The Union Army lost no ground due to the attack and their casualties were too few to deter them from further, immediate action. In response to the Confederate attack on Fort Stedman in the afternoon of March 25, at the Battle of Jones&#x27;s Farm, Union forces of the II Corps and the VI Corps captured Confederate picket lines near Armstrong&#x27;s Mill and extended the left end of the Union line about closer to the Confederate fortifications. This put the VI Corps within easy striking distance, about , of the Confederate line. After the Confederate defeats at Fort Stedman and Jones&#x27;s Farm, Lee knew that Grant would soon move against the only remaining Confederate supply lines to Petersburg, the South Side Railroad and the Boydton Plank Road, which also might cut off all routes of retreat from Richmond and Petersburg.

===March 29 orders and movements===

====Grant&#x27;s orders====

On March 24, 1865, the day before the Confederate attack on Fort Stedman, Grant already had planned an offensive for March 29, 1865. The objective was to draw the Confederates out into an open battle where they might be defeated and their military effectiveness destroyed. In the alternative, if the Confederates held their lines, the Union force could cut the remaining road and railroad supply and communication routes, the South Side Railroad and the Boydton Plank Road, which connected with the previously severed Weldon Railroad to Petersburg, and the Richmond and Danville Railroad to Richmond, and to stretch Lee&#x27;s line to the breaking point.

Grant ordered Major General Edward Ord to move part of his Army of the James from the lines near Richmond to fill in the lines to be vacated by the II Corps commanded by Major General Andrew A. Humphreys at the southwest end of the Petersburg line before II Corps moved to the west. Ord moved two divisions of Major General John Gibbon&#x27;s XXIV Corps under Brigadier Generals Charles Devens and William Birney and one division of XXV Corps under Brigadier General John W. Turner to take over lines on the south side of the Appomattox River. This freed two corps of Major General George Meade&#x27;s Army of the Potomac for offensive action against Lee&#x27;s flank and railroad supply lines: Major General Humphrey&#x27;s II Corps and Major General Warren&#x27;s V Corps. Grant ordered these corps, along with Major General Philip Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry (First Division of Brigadier General Thomas Devin and the Third Division of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer but both under the overall command of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Wesley Merritt as an unofficial corps commander and the Second Division of Major General George Crook detached from the Army of the Potomac), still designated the Army of the Shenandoah, to move west, with the cavalry first taking control of Dinwiddie Court House and severing the Boydton Plank Road at that location.

====Lee&#x27;s orders====

Lee, who was already concerned about the ability of his weakening army to maintain the defense of Petersburg and Richmond, realized that the defeat at Fort Stedman would encourage Grant to make a move against his supply lines and right flank. Lee already had prepared to send some reinforcements to his right flank, the southwestern end of his line. Early in the day on March 29, Lee sent Major General George Pickett with three of his brigades commanded by Brigadier Generals William R. Terry, Montgomery Corse and George H. Steuart via the deteriorated South Side Railroad to Sutherland Station. The trains shuttling the troops to Sutherland Station were so slow that it was late night before the last of Pickett&#x27;s men reached their destination, west of Petersburg. From Sutherland Station, Pickett moved south on Claiborne Road to White Oak Road and Burgess Mill, near the end of the Confederate line. There he added the two brigades of Brigadier Generals Matt Ransom and William Henry Wallace from Major General Bushrod Johnson&#x27;s division, along with a six-gun battery under Colonel William Pegram to deploy to Five Forks with his three brigades.

====Battle of Lewis&#x27;s Farm====
On March 29, 1865, Warren&#x27;s corps led by the First Brigade of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin&#x27;s First Division under the command of Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain proceeded up the Quaker Road toward its intersection with the Boydton Plank Road and the Confederates&#x27; nearby White Oak Road Line. The move resulted in an engagement at the Battle of Lewis&#x27;s Farm of Confederate brigades of Brigadier Generals Henry A. Wise, William Henry Wallace and Young Marshall Moody from the division of Major General Bushrod Johnson, corps of Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson, and Union troops of Griffin&#x27;s First Division of the V Corps.

North along Quaker Road, across Rowanty Creek at the Lewis Farm, Chamberlain&#x27;s men encountered Johnson&#x27;s force. A back-and-forth battle ensued during which Chamberlain was wounded and almost captured. Chamberlain&#x27;s brigade, reinforced by a four-gun artillery battery and regiments from the brigades of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory and Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson, who was later awarded the Medal of Honor, drove the Confederates back to their White Oak Road Line. Casualties for both sides were nearly even at 381 for the Union and 371 for the Confederates. After the battle, Griffin&#x27;s division moved up to and occupied the junction of the Quaker Road and Boydton Plank Road near the end of the Confederate White Oak Road Line.

Encouraged by the Confederate failure to press their attack at Lewis&#x27;s Farm and their withdrawal to their White Oak Road Line, Grant decided to expand Sheridan&#x27;s mission to a major offensive rather than just a railroad raid and forced extension of the Confederate line or a battle only if offered.

====Sheridan&#x27;s movement====

At about 5:00 p.m., on March 29, 1865, two divisions of Sheridan&#x27;s force commanded by Crook and Devin entered Dinwiddie Court House without opposition. Sheridan posted pickets at the roads entering the town for protection from Confederate patrols. Sheridan&#x27;s third division commanded by Custer was behind Sheridan&#x27;s main force protecting the bogged down wagon trains. At Dinwiddie Court House, Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry was positioned to occupy the crucial road junction at Five Forks in Dinwiddie County, about to the north, to which Lee was just sending defenders, and then to attack the two remaining Confederate railroad connections to Petersburg and Richmond.

===March 30 orders and movements===

====Lee&#x27;s orders and Confederate movements====

General Lee perceived the threat from the Union moves on March 29 and thinned his lines to strengthen the defenses on his far right. He also finalized organization of a Confederate mobile force under Major General George Pickett with cavalry help from Major General Fitzhugh Lee to protect the key road junction of Five Forks. Lee wanted to control this intersection in order to keep open the South Side Railroad and important roads and to drive the Union force back from its advanced position at Dinwiddie Court House. A steady, heavy rain started on the afternoon of March 29 and continued through March 30, slowing movements and limiting actions.

Although Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry division passed through Petersburg and reached Sutherland Station about the time Sheridan reached Dinwiddie Court House on March 29, Major General Thomas L. Rosser&#x27;s and Major General W.H.F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee&#x27;s divisions had to detour around Sheridan&#x27;s force in their moves from positions at Spencer&#x27;s Mill on the Nottoway River and Stony Creek Station and did not arrive at Sutherland Station until March 30. At Sutherland Station earlier that day, General Lee verbally told Major General Fitzhugh Lee to take command of the cavalry and to attack Sheridan at Dinwiddie Court House. When Rosser and Rooney Lee&#x27;s divisions arrived at Five Forks on the night of March 30, Fitzhugh Lee took overall command of the cavalry and put Colonel Thomas T. Munford in command of his own division.

Earlier on March 30, a day of steady torrential rain, General Lee met with several officers including Anderson, Pickett and Heth at Sutherland Station. From there, Lee ordered Pickett to move his force about west along White Oak Road to Five Forks. Lee instructed Pickett to join with Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry and attack Sheridan at Dinwiddie Court House with the objective of driving Sheridan&#x27;s force further away from the Confederate supply lines. With the gap between the end of the Confederate White Oak Road Line southwest of Petersburg and Pickett&#x27;s force at Five Forks in mind, on March 30, Lee made additional deployments to strengthen his right flank.

Skirmishing with and reacting to feints from Union patrols of the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry under Colonel Charles L. Leiper delayed Pickett&#x27;s force from reaching Five Forks until 4:30 p.m. When Pickett reached Five Forks where Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry was waiting, he conferred with Fitz Lee about whether to proceed toward Dinwiddie Court House then. After discussing the situation, Pickett decided because of the late hour and the absence of the other cavalry divisions to wait until morning to move his tired men against Sheridan at Dinwiddie Court House. Pickett did send William R. Terry&#x27;s and Montgomery Corse&#x27;s brigades to an advanced position south of Five Forks to guard against surprise attack. Some of Union Brigadier General Thomas Devin&#x27;s men skirmished with the advanced infantry brigades before the Confederates were able to settle into their positions. By 9:45 p.m., Pickett&#x27;s force was deployed along the White Oak Road.

====Union orders and movements; March 30 skirmish====

Before Pickett&#x27;s infantry arrived at Five Forks on March 30, Union cavalry patrols from Brigadier General Thomas Devin&#x27;s division approached the Confederate line along White Oak Road at Five Forks and skirmished with Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry division. As they approached Five Forks, a patrol of the 6th United States Cavalry Regiment under Major Robert M. Morris encountered Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s troopers and lost 3 officers and 20 men in the encounter. The Confederates also suffered some casualties, including Brigadier General William H. F. Payne who was wounded.

As the rain continued on March 30, Grant sent a note to Sheridan in which he said that cavalry operations seemed to be impossible and perhaps he should leave enough men to hold his position and return to Humphreys&#x27; Station for forage. He even suggested going by way of Stony Creek Station to destroy or capture Confederate supplies there. Sheridan responded by going to Grant&#x27;s headquarters which had been moved forward to near the Vaughan Road crossing of Gravelly Run on the night of March 30 to urge him to press ahead regardless of the weather and road conditions. Sheridan supported his argument by the false statement that his men had already reached White Oak Road at Five Forks. In fact, Devin&#x27;s men had been driven back from Five Forks and had encamped about a mile away at the John Boisseau house. During their discussions, Grant told Sheridan he would send him the V Corps for infantry support and that his new orders were not to extend the line further but to turn the Confederate flank and to break Lee&#x27;s army. Sheridan wanted the VI Corps which had fought with him in the Shenandoah Valley. Grant again told him that the VI Corps was too far from his position to make the move.

====Battle of White Oak Road====


On the morning of March 31, General Lee inspected his White Oak Road Line and learned that the Union left flank held by Brigadier General Romeyn B. Ayres&#x27;s division had moved forward the previous day and was &quot;in the air.&quot; A wide gap also existed between the Union infantry and Sheridan&#x27;s nearest cavalry units near Dinwiddie Court House. Lee ordered Major General Bushrod Johnson to have his remaining brigades under Brigadier General Henry A. Wise and Colonel Martin L. Stansel in lieu of the ill Young Marshall Moody, reinforced by the brigades of Brigadier Generals Samuel McGowan and Eppa Hunton, attack the exposed Union line.

Stansel&#x27;s, McGowan&#x27;s and Hunton&#x27;s brigades attacked both most of Ayres&#x27;s division and all of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Samuel Crawford&#x27;s division which quickly joined the fight as it erupted. Two Union divisions of over 5,000 men were thrown back by three Confederate brigades. Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin&#x27;s division and the V Corps artillery under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Charles S. Wainwright finally stopped the Confederate advance short of crossing Gravelly Run. Adjacent to the V Corps, Major General Andrew A. Humphreys conducted diversionary demonstrations and sent two of Brigadier General Nelson Miles&#x27;s brigades from his II Corps forward and they initially surprised and after a sharp fight drove back Wise&#x27;s brigade on the left of the Confederate line, taking about 100 prisoners.

At 2:30 p.m., Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain&#x27;s men forded the cold, swollen Gravelly Run, followed by the rest of Griffin&#x27;s division and then the rest of Warren&#x27;s reorganized units. Under heavy fire, Chamberlain&#x27;s brigade, along with Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory&#x27;s, charged Hunton&#x27;s brigade and drove them back to the White Oak Road Line. Then Chamberlain&#x27;s and Gregory&#x27;s men crossed White Oak Road. The remainder of the Confederate force then had to withdraw to prevent being outflanked and overwhelmed. Warren&#x27;s corps ended the battle across White Oak Road between the end of the main Confederate line and Pickett&#x27;s force at Five Forks, cutting direct communications between Anderson&#x27;s (Johnson&#x27;s) and Pickett&#x27;s forces. Union casualties (killed, wounded, missing – presumably mostly captured) were 1,407 from the Fifth Corps and 461 from the Second Corps and Confederate casualties have been estimated at about 800.

While Warren&#x27;s V Corps led by Griffin&#x27;s division, with help from Miles&#x27;s division of Humphrey&#x27;s II Corps, turned the Battle of White Oak Road into a Union victory, Sheridan was hard pressed as the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House ended for the day.

==== Morning conditions; troop dispositions ====

Early on March 31, 1865, Union Major General Philip Sheridan told Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant that he believed he could turn the Confederate right or make a breakthrough if the rain stopped and he had the help of an infantry corps. Sheridan wanted the VI Corps commanded by Major General Horatio G. Wright, which he had worked with in the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864, not the V Corps under Major General Gouverneur Warren whom Sheridan did not trust. Grant replied a few hours later that the VI Corps was in the center of the line and too far away to support Sheridan but he could move the II Corps by the next day. Grant also said that Wright thought he could go through the line from his current position. Although heavy rain continued that day, Confederate Major General George E. Pickett was about to change the situation and options of the Union commanders.

At 9:00 a.m., Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Wesley Merritt reinforced the Union picket line and ordered Brigadier General Thomas Devin to send out strong combat patrols from his camp at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm north of Dinwiddie Court House to scout Confederate positions covering White Oak Road Patrols moving up Crump Road and Dinwiddie Court House Road attracted Confederate rifle fire near White Oak Road.

Brigadier General Henry E. Davies&#x27;s brigade of Major General George Crook&#x27;s division also was at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm. Patrols from Davies&#x27;s brigade were sent to watch the area on the east of a swampy creek called Chamberlain&#x27;s Bed. Sheridan was mindful of the possibility that his force could come under attack from the west because he had blocked Confederate Major Generals W.H.F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee&#x27;s and Thomas L.Rosser&#x27;s approach from the south the previous day. Soon after Davies&#x27;s patrol reached their station, his men spotted both Confederate cavalry and infantry heading toward Dinwiddie Court House on the west side of the creek. Pickett had decided to march south from Five Forks on Scott Road at about 9:00 a.m. for an attack on Sheridan at Dinwiddie Court House despite the bad weather and the hunger of his ill-fed troops.

When Sheridan heard about the movement, he assumed the Confederates were moving on Scott Road west of the creek. Davies&#x27;s brigade was sent to cover the creek&#x27;s northern crossing at Danse&#x27;s Ford. Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Charles H. Smith&#x27;s brigade was set to hold the Ford Station Road crossing at Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford, about south of Danse&#x27;s Ford. Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) J. Irvin Gregg&#x27;s brigade stood in reserve at the junction of Adams and Brooks roads, midway between the two crossings. While these brigades faced west, Colonel Charles L. Fitzhugh&#x27;s brigade was on the right on Dinwiddie Road and Colonel Peter Stagg&#x27;s brigade was on Crump Road, where they could cover the other brigades as well as the roads from the north.

==Opposing forces==

===Confederate===
==Battle==

=== Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s attack at Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford ===

At about 11:00 a.m., Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s lead brigade, Brigadier General Rufus Barringer&#x27;s North Carolina brigade from Rooney Lee&#x27;s division, reached Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford, the southern ford of Chamberlain&#x27;s Bed and the closer ford to Dinwiddie Court House. The North Carolina troopers were held back by a dismounted detachment of the 2nd Regiment New York Mounted Rifles with their repeating carbines. The 6th Ohio Cavalry joined the fight, also with repeating carbines. Smith deployed a battalion of the 1st Maine Volunteer Cavalry Regiment across the creek but were forced back by a large Confederate battle line. The Confederates were able to fight their way across the creek, with the 5th North Carolina Cavalry crossing under heavy fire, the 1st North Carolina Cavalry crossing upstream and the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry crossing behind a mounted battalion of the 13th Virginia Cavalry. Colonel Smith moved up the remainder of the 1st Maine Cavalry from down the road and the 13th Ohio Cavalry. With the 1st Maine Cavalry on the top of a hill and the 6th Ohio Cavalry in the woods to their left, Smith&#x27;s Union force drove back the 13th Virginia Cavalry, who in turn forced the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry into deep water in the ford. The 1st North Carolina Cavalry was driven back across the creek by the 2nd New York Mounted Rifles. Barringer&#x27;s brigade lost a large number of officers as it retreated across the creek and the Union brigade took as prisoners the Confederates who stayed on the east side.

Then, after 11:00 a.m., Pickett reached Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford as Rooney Lee&#x27;s failing attack ground to a stop. Pickett decided to go back north for to cross at Danse&#x27;s Ford with his three infantry brigades (Corse&#x27;s, Terry&#x27;s and Steuart&#x27;s) and Rosser&#x27;s cavalry. Pickett&#x27;s plan was for Ransom&#x27;s two infantry brigades (Ransom&#x27;s and William Henry Wallace&#x27;s) to cross at Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford with Fitz Lee and Rooney Lee.

At about 2:30 p.m., Sheridan sent a report to Grant that his men had held back the Confederates at Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford and would now attack them. He also erroneously reported that Confederate Major General Robert F. Hoke&#x27;s infantry division was up from North Carolina and that Devin&#x27;s division was in contact with the line of the Confederate infantry outposts at Five Forks. In fact, Pickett&#x27;s infantry was about to force their way across Chamberlain&#x27;s Bed at Danse&#x27;s Ford. Devin&#x27;s patrols actually had spotted only Colonel Thomas T. Munford&#x27;s cavalry division near Five Forks. Rooney Lee was preparing another attack on the Fitzgerald Ford of Chamberlain&#x27;s Bed for the afternoon.

At Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford, the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry, supported by the 5th North Carolina Cavalry, were thrown back as the 5th North Carolina had been in the morning. Only the 1st North Carolina Cavalry could keep a foothold across the ford. Rooney Lee ordered Brigadier General Richard L. T. Beale&#x27;s Virginia cavalry brigade to attack across the creek and come in from the left. Both Beale&#x27;s and Barringer&#x27;s cavalry brigades now rushed across Smith&#x27;s line, forcing the Union force to retreat into an open field and quickly withdraw.

=== Pickett&#x27;s attack at and crossing of Danse&#x27;s Ford ===

After he was advised of the collapse of Smith&#x27;s line in the late morning, Crook ordered Davies who was not under attack, to help Smith. Davies left a battalion under Major Walter W. Robbins to guard Danse&#x27;s Ford and started his men on foot along a narrow, muddy road toward Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford. Davies rode ahead and discovered that Smith had stabilized the situation, throwing those troopers of Barringer&#x27;s brigade who had managed to cross the creek back across it. Davies then turned his men back on the double because of the sound of heavy firing near Danse&#x27;s Ford. Soon after Davies had left for Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford, Robbins&#x27;s battalion came under attack by Brigadier General Montgomery Corse&#x27;s infantry brigade. Robbins held a strong position with protection from breastworks. Corse sent patrols to ford the creek and attack Robbins from the flanks. Corse&#x27;s men pushed back men from Major James H. Hart&#x27;s New Jersey battalion who were guarding the left flank. Outflanked and outnumbered, Robbins&#x27;s men began to flee when Davies&#x27;s tired troopers came up. The 10th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry held the line for a few volleys and then fled, almost losing their held horses in the process.

=== Union delaying actions ===

Pickett then sent the other infantry brigades across the ford. Davies fell back toward Adams Road with Colonel Hugh R. Janeway covering the retreat with his 1st and 2nd battalions of the 1st New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry. They were soon supported by a Michigan regiment from Colonel Stagg&#x27;s brigade, sent by Brigadier General Devin when Janeway requested support.

Until 2:00 p.m., Munford&#x27;s patrols had kept Devin&#x27;s patrols busy on Dinwiddie Court House Road near White Oak Road. Devin did not know that Pickett had moved across the ford but withdrew Fitzhugh&#x27;s brigade to the junction of Dinwiddie and Gravelly Run Church roads when he learned that Five Forks was held by Pickett&#x27;s infantry and at least a division of cavalry. Devin accompanied Stagg&#x27;s men to discover the situation. Upon seeing Davies&#x27;s brigade in retreat, Devin tried unsuccessfully to rally them. Then he sent an order to Colonel Fitzhugh to move to the road from Danse&#x27;s ford, leaving one regiment on the Dinwiddie Road. After struggling through Davies&#x27;s stragglers, Fitzhugh&#x27;s men relieved Janeway&#x27;s rear guard and stopped Corse&#x27;s advance. Davies took his men to J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm to be reorganized, losing dozens of men along the way, including Major James H. Hart of the 1st New Jersey Cavalry.

=== Staggs, Fitzhugh, Davies withdraw ===

Munford then committed his cavalry division to advance down the Dinwiddie Road where they forced the 6th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry and part of a Michigan regiment to retreat. Meanwhile, Pickett sent Terry&#x27;s brigade to break Fitzhugh&#x27;s defense. Devin had Fitzhugh retire from the strong infantry attack and threat of being outflanked by Munford. Stagg moved forward to deal with the infantry as Fitzhugh had to remove all of his men to the Dinwiddie Road. The two Union brigades could not hold back the combined Confederate infantry and cavalry attack and joined Davies&#x27;s men at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm. Pickett then moved patrols through the woods to occupy Adams Road and separate the Union force at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm from the Union forces at Dinwiddie Court House. Each of the two separated segments of Sheridan&#x27;s command were outnumbered nearly three to one by Pickett&#x27;s intervening force.

At Sheridan&#x27;s instruction, Merritt then ordered Devin to take Fitzhugh&#x27;s and Stagg&#x27;s brigades to the Boydton Plank Road and move to Dinwiddie Court House. After moving to the Boydton Plank Road, Devin made contact with Brigadier General Alfred Gibbs&#x27;s brigade of Devin&#x27;s division at the junction of Adams and Brooks Roads. In line with Sheridan&#x27;s direction, Davies&#x27;s brigade then crossed Boydton Plank Road under fire and Davies took command as ranking officer of the three brigades. He deployed the 6th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment to drive back Munford&#x27;s suddenly pursuing Confederates, which they accomplished with their Spencer repeating carbines. Davies then sent Fitzhugh and Stagg to Dinwiddie Court House on a wide movement to and over the Boydton Plank Road where they were rejoined by their men with their led horses. The escape of the three Union brigades from Pickett&#x27;s advance on their position at the J. Boisseau farm was facilitated by the action of Gibbs&#x27;s and Gregg&#x27;s brigades against Pickett&#x27;s force from the south.

=== Gregg, Gibbs, Smith hold ===

When Smith&#x27;s brigade was under attack at 2:00 p.m., Gregg&#x27;s brigade moved from Dinwiddie Court House to support Smith at Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford. Finding the situation under control, Gregg alerted his men to be ready to move to Danse&#x27;s Ford because of the report of the fighting there. After Sheridan moved the three brigades at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm, which he planned to have in position to attack the Confederate flank and rear, he ordered Gregg&#x27;s brigade to move cross country to hold Adams Road against the Confederates advancing against Stagg, Fitzhugh and Davies. Because Pickett was moving northeasterly away from Dinwiddie Court House, Gibbs, soon joined by Greggs, was able to attack Pickett&#x27;s flank and rear, forcing him to direct his force back against them.

From the junction of Adams and Brooks Roads, Gibbs was to hold off the Confederate infantry until Gregg moved forward and established contact with Gibbs. Then those Union brigades engaged Pickett&#x27;s advancing infantry, which had Munford&#x27;s cavalry guarding their left flank, deflecting then from their drive against the brigades reforming at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm. Without waiting for the Confederate attack, Gregg&#x27;s men pushed forward and captured some prisoners.

Gregg and Gibbs held the line on Adams Road just south of Brooks Road for almost two hours before Gibbs&#x27;s brigade retreated. Gregg&#x27;s position could not be held without Gibbs&#x27;s support and his men fell back. When Gregg and Gibbs fell back past Ford&#x27;s Station Road, they took Smith&#x27;s brigade from Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford with them because Smith&#x27;s force would have been cut off by Pickett&#x27;s advance where they were positioned. When forced to withdraw, Smith had held off Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s attack at the ford until nearly 5:30 p.m. Smith reformed on the left of Capehart&#x27;s brigade of Custer&#x27;s division on Adams Road.

=== Custer moves up, holds line ===

At the same time as Sheridan moved Gregg and Gibbs to guard against the Confederate advance on Adams Road, he sent for two of Custer&#x27;s brigades. As he had done earlier in the day, Sheridan used a fresh division to salvage a situation where Union units had retreated. Custer&#x27;s third brigade, under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) William Wells, was to remain guarding the wagon train. Custer led the brigades of Colonels Alexander C. M. Pennington and Henry Capehart to report to Sheridan at Dinwiddie Court House. Upon Sheridan&#x27;s order to support and relieve the brigades of Crook&#x27;s division Custer deployed about three-quarters mile north of Dinwiddie Court House. Custer directed Pennington to reinforce Smith&#x27;s brigade at Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford. Capehart&#x27;s troopers were to take position on the left of Adams Road. With Smith retiring from Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford, one of Sheridan&#x27;s aides rode up and told Pennington to deploy on Capehart&#x27;s right. Battery A, 2nd U.S. Light Artillery also reported to Custer and were positioned on the left. Pennington had only two regiments, the 2nd Ohio Cavalry and 3rd New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, forward and positioned a short distance in front of the other Union units.

When Smith fell back from Fitzgerald Ford, Rooney Lee&#x27;s and Rosser&#x27;s cavalry divisions had forded Chamberlain&#x27;s Bed and formed on the right of Pickett&#x27;s line. After Gregg and Gibbs moved back, the Confederates resumed their push on Dinwiddie Court House. As darkness approached, the Confederates came up against Custer&#x27;s line. A few minutes before the Confederates appeared from the woods at their front, Gregg&#x27;s brigade moved to the right of Pennington&#x27;s brigade, in advance of the main Union line and Gibbs&#x27;s brigade was sent to reunite with Devin&#x27;s division camped in the rear at Crump&#x27;s farm. Other reports show Gibbs&#x27;s brigade in the line of battle.

=== Final Confederate attack and positions ===

Pickett decided to have the infantry attack Custer&#x27;s position down Adams Road while Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry would attack the Union left and Munford&#x27;s cavalry would cover the field between Adams and Boydton Plank roads. Just before the Confederate attack, Sheridan, Merritt and Custer rode along the line shouting encouragement and exposing themselves to fire. A few civilian visitors rode behind the generals, among them a &quot;New York Herald&quot; reporter who was slightly wounded.

When the Confederates attacked, Pickett&#x27;s infantry first assaulted Pennington&#x27;s advanced line. Pennington&#x27;s brigade fell back and reformed on crest of a ridge on the right of Adams road in contact with Capehart&#x27;s brigade. Pickett&#x27;s force made no immediate move to follow up their attack during Pennington&#x27;s retirement. Pennington&#x27;s force had time to throw up fence rail barricades before receiving another attack. When the Confederate infantry finally resumed the attack, Custer&#x27;s reorganized defensive line, using repeating rifles, twice drove them back. On the left, Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry attacked Smith&#x27;s men, who continued to hold out despite heavy losses, until they finally ran out of ammunition near dark. &quot;By presenting a good front, without a cartridge,&quot; Smith&#x27;s retiring force discouraged a further attack against them as they occupied a stronger position further south and pretended they had ammunition. As dark was coming on, Custer led Capehart&#x27;s dismounted men in a charge that drove the Confederates back, seeming to drain their remaining energy.

By this time, the night had become very dark and Pickett ordered the Confederate attack ended in the face of Custer&#x27;s resistance. Colonel Munford later criticized Pickett for making this decision, stating the Confederates had lost &quot;a golden opportunity&quot; and that &quot;daylight had nothing to do with it.&quot; Nonetheless, the opposing sides continued to fire at each other for hours after dark.

The two armies&#x27; battle lines were very close to each other at the end of the day&#x27;s battle, in places only about apart. Pickett&#x27;s infantry was across Adams road with Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry on the right and Munford&#x27;s cavalry on the left. Confederate pickets extended from G. U. Brooks&#x27; farm on the left to Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford on the right. Custer&#x27;s two brigades were holding Sheridan&#x27;s front and slept on their arms in anticipation of an early morning attack. According to their commanders, each side believed the other would be in a perilous position the following morning.

=== Immediate result; casualties ===

Although only a partial victory which did not remove Sheridan from the field, the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House temporarily gave the initiative to the Confederates. Union cavalry, most armed with seven shot repeating carbines or rifles, fought both Confederate cavalry and infantry and slowed the spirited Confederate progress throughout the day. Sheridan&#x27;s delaying actions were effective at several points but the Union cavalry was pushed back almost to Dinwiddie Court House by the end of the day. Nonetheless, the Confederates had suffered additional losses and could not hold their advanced position.

The Confederates did not report their casualties and losses. Historian A. Wilson Greene has written that the best estimate of Confederate casualties is 360 cavalry, 400 infantry, 760 total. Statements show that some Confederates also were taken prisoner. Sheridan suffered 40 killed, 254 wounded, 60 missing, total 354. Pickett lost General Terry to a disabling injury. He was replaced as brigade commander by Colonel Robert M. Mayo.

=== Sheridan&#x27;s messages to Grant ===

Late in the afternoon Grant sent his aide-de-camp Lieutenant Colonel Horace Porter to report on Sheridan&#x27;s situation. He arrived as Gregg&#x27;s and Gibb&#x27;s brigades were falling back from the junction of Adams and Brooks roads. Porter met Sheridan just before reaching Dinwiddie Court House. Sheridan told Porter he had had one of the liveliest days in his experience, fighting infantry and cavalry with only cavalry. Since his men were concentrating on high ground just north of Dinwiddie Court House, he would hold his position at all hazards. Sheridan reiterated that with a corps of infantry, he could cut off the whole force that Lee had detached and sent against him. Sheridan said that Pickett was in more danger than he was.

Historian A. Wilson Greene has stated that the significance of the battle transcended the modest number of casualties. As Sheridan told Colonel Porter: &quot;This force is in more danger than I am - if I am cut off from the Army of the Potomac, it is cut off from Lee&#x27;s army, and not a man in it should ever be allowed to get back to Lee. We at last have drawn the enemy&#x27;s infantry out of its fortifications, and this is our chance to attack it.&quot;

Sheridan asked Porter to hasten back to Grant and to ask Grant to send him the VI Corps but Porter repeated Grant&#x27;s earlier statement to Sheridan that Wright was on the right of the Union line and the only infantry corps that could promptly join Sheridan was Warren&#x27;s V Corps. Sheridan appears not to have been as confident as he led Porter to believe because in a letter to Grant sent with a later dispatch via an aide, Colonel John Kellogg, he wrote that &quot;This force (Pickett&#x27;s) is too strong for us. I will hold on to Dinwiddie Court-House until I am compelled to leave.&quot; Porter made his report to Grant at Dabney&#x27;s Mill at 7:00 p.m. The later reports carried to both Meade and Grant via Sheridan&#x27;s brother Michael, one of his aides, and Colonel Kellogg caused them to conclude that Sheridan was in a desperate position and needed fast reinforcement.

==Aftermath==

===V Corps moves; additional orders===

The Confederates won the day on March 31 at Dinwiddie Court House by pushing the Union cavalry into a tight position from which they might be further attacked and dislodged.

Despite Sheridan&#x27;s later criticism of Warren for moving slowly and his removal of Warren from command the next day, when at the end of the Battle of White Oak Road Warren heard the sound of the distant battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett&#x27;s brigade of Griffin&#x27;s division to reinforce Sheridan intending that Bartlett attack Pickett&#x27;s flank. Moving cross country, Bartlett&#x27;s men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s farm, just east of Crump Road. Since it was dark when Bartlett&#x27;s men reach Gravelly Run, they did not try to cross but engaged the Confederates on the other side with sniper fire. The dark night hid the size of Bartlett&#x27;s force from close scrutiny.

At about 6:30 p.m., when Meade learned more about the location of Pickett&#x27;s and Sheridan&#x27;s forces, he ordered Warren to send his relief column down the Boydton Plank Road, but Bartlett had been gone too long to be easily recalled. Warren sent three regiments that Bartlett had detached to guard artillery and wagons down the Boydton Plank Road under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson and reported this to Meade. Since the Gravelly Run bridge on the Boydton Plank Road had been broken down by the Confederates, Pearson was delayed. At about 8:20 p.m., Warren told Meade about the needed bridge repair and possible delay but Meade did not pass the information to Sheridan. Meade told Warren to have his entire force ready to move. By 9:17 p.m., Warren was ordered to withdraw from the line and send a division to Sheridan at once.

At 9:45 p.m., Meade first advised Grant of Bartlett&#x27;s forward location at Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s farm and inquired of Grant whether Warren&#x27;s entire corps should go to help Sheridan. Grant agreed to follow Meade&#x27;s advice that II Corps could hold the Boydton Plank Road Line and that two divisions might move to the position held by Bartlett at Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s farm and one to Dinwiddie, rather than have all three divisions move to Dinwiddie Court House. Grant directed that Meade tell Sheridan about the dispositions and that Sheridan should take direction of the forces being sent to him. Meade did not tell Grant that the plan to move Warren&#x27;s entire corps to Sheridan&#x27;s aid was Warren&#x27;s idea.

When Grant then notified Sheridan that the V Corps and Ranald Mackenzie&#x27;s cavalry division from the Army of the James had been ordered to his support, he gratuitously and without any basis said that Warren should reach him &quot;by 12 tonight.&quot; It was impossible for the tired V Corps soldiers to cover about on dark, muddy roads with a bridge out in about an hour. Through the night, no one gave Sheridan accurate and complete information about Warren&#x27;s dispositions, logistical situation and when he received his orders. Nonetheless, Warren&#x27;s supposed failure to meet his schedule was something for which Sheridan would hold Warren to account.

Meade&#x27;s further order to send Griffin&#x27;s division down the Boydton Plank Road and Ayres&#x27;s and Crawford&#x27;s divisions to join Bartlett at Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s farm so they could attack the rear of the Confederate force did not acknowledge the large Confederate force at Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s farm and the needed repair of the bridge. Warren also received information from a staffer that a Confederate cavalry force under Brigadier General William P. Roberts held the junction of Crump Road and White Oak Road, threatening a direct move.

Because of the disposition of his divisions, to save time, Warren sent Ayres&#x27;s division to support Sheridan first. Warren&#x27;s message to Meade about this change and the unlikelihood he could move against the Confederate flank and rear because of the large Confederate force at Gravelly Run near Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s house was delayed due to a break in the telegraph line. Warren&#x27;s implementation of his orders was delayed due to the availability of only six staff officers that night. Further delays were encountered by the need for to keep the movements of the V Corps from the Union line quiet to avoid Confederate attack from the nearby White Oak Road line.

Humphrey&#x27;s II Corps was advised to fill in for the V Corps after their movement. Humphrey&#x27;s replied that his corps could reoccupy its position from the morning of March 31. He sent a message to Warren at 12:30 a.m. asking for Warren&#x27;s schedule so he could synchronize his movements with Warren&#x27;s.

Meade learned of the Gravelly Run bridge problem when the telegraph was restored at about 11:45 p.m. Warren rejected Meade&#x27;s suggestion to consider alternate routes because it would take too long to move his corps. Ayres had received Warren&#x27;s order to move to the Boydton Plank Road at about 10:00 p.m. This required him to move over about two miles of rough country and cross a branch Gravelly Run. Warren allowed Crawford&#x27;s and Griffin&#x27;s men to rest where they were until he learned that Ayres&#x27;s division had made contact with Sheridan&#x27;s.

Warren was told that the Gravelly Run bridge was completed at 2:05 a.m. Ayres&#x27;s division arrived at Sheridan&#x27;s position near dawn. As predicted by Warren, the effect of Bartlett&#x27;s appearance threatening Pickett&#x27;s flank was enough for Pickett to withdraw to Five Forks, which the Confederates had done by the time Ayres reach Dinwiddie Court House. One of Sheridan&#x27;s staff officers met Ayres and told him they should have turned on to Brooks Road, a mile back. Ayres returned to Brooks Road, where a lone Confederate picket promptly fled and Ayres&#x27;s men settled down for a rest until 2:00 p.m.

Sheridan had sent a message to Warren at 3:00 a.m., which did not reach his headquarters until 4:50 a.m., in which he told Warren of the disposition of his forces. Mistakenly thinking that Warren had a division at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm in the rear and almost on the flank of the Confederates, Sheridan wanted Warren to attack the Confederates. None of Warren&#x27;s units had been at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm. The closest had been at Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s farm, to the north and that unit, Bartlett&#x27;s brigade, had been recalled. So Warren proceeded to supervise the withdrawal of Crawford&#x27;s and Griffin&#x27;s divisions.

About 5:00 a.m., Griffin&#x27;s division was told to move to the left to J. Boisseau&#x27;s house. Since Warren did not know Pickett had withdrawn his force, he still expected Griffin to be able to intercept them. Griffin&#x27;s force moved in line of battle with great care because they thought they might strike the Confederate force from White Oak Road while moving toward the Crump Road. The Confederates did not attack and Warren remained with Crawford until he reached Crump Road.

Warren and his staff then rode to join Griffin at about 9:00 a.m. Griffin had met Devin&#x27;s cavalry division at J. Boisseau&#x27;s where he stopped his division and reported to Sheridan. Sheridan rode up, encountered Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain and asked him where Warren was. Chamberlain replied that he thought he was at the rear of the column. Sheridan exclaimed: &quot;That&#x27;s just where I should expect him to be.&quot; Warren&#x27;s men knew this was an unfair comment because Warren had never shown a lack of personal bravery. Sheridan instructed Griffin to place his men south of J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm, while Ayres&#x27;s remained south of Griffin. Warren and Crawford&#x27;s division arrived soon thereafter.

At 6:00 a.m., Meade&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Alexander S. Webb, had sent an order to Warren to report to Sheridan for further orders. Two of Warren&#x27;s divisions had done so within an hour of that message. A staff officer rode up to Warren at about 9:30 a.m. and handed him Webb&#x27;s message. At the same time that Webb sent this message to Warren, 6:00 a.m., Meade sent a telegram to Grant stating that Warren would be at Dinwiddie soon with his whole corps and would require further orders. Warren reported to Meade on the successful movement of the corps and stated that while he had not personally met with Sheridan, Griffin had spoken with him. The failure of Warren to report directly to Sheridan may have contributed to his relief from command later on April 1. Warren reported to Sheridan about 11:00 a.m.

When Grant learned that Mackenzie&#x27;s cavalry division had completed their assignment of guarding the withdrawal of wagon trains from the front, he ordered that Mackenzie and his men report to Sheridan at Dinwiddie Court House. Breaking camp at 3:30 a.m., Mackenzie&#x27;s troopers rode toward Dinwiddie Court House over the Monk&#x27;s Neck and Vaughan Roads.

===Pickett withdraws to Five Forks===

Pickett realized his position was untenable after he learned between 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. that Bartlett&#x27;s brigade was on its way to reinforce Sheridan, exposing his force to flanking Union infantry attack. So Pickett withdrew to Five Forks by 5:00 a.m., giving up any advantage his attack on Sheridan might have gained. Bartlett&#x27;s brigade was only the lead unit for all of Griffin&#x27;s and Crawford&#x27;s divisions which were put on the march later that night and would have trapped Pickett&#x27;s force between them and Sheridan&#x27;s troops. This would have given the Confederate force no apparent alternatives other than surrender or flight to the west. Pickett&#x27;s retreat gave him an opportunity to defend Five Forks and the South Side Railroad.

When Sheridan discovered the Confederates were pulling back, he sent Custer&#x27;s division, mostly dismounted, in pursuit on the left and Devin&#x27;s mounted division in pursuit on the right. A few artillery pieces and Gregg&#x27;s brigade from Crook&#x27;s corps moved forward in support. As noted in the previous section, Sheridan had received wrong information so he thought the V Corps was in the rear and almost on the flank of the Confederates and therefore he mistakenly thought V Corps could launch an early, severe attack on Pickett&#x27;s force. Without infantry support, Sheridan did not press his divisions to carry the attack by themselves.

The slow withdrawal and narrow roads kept the last of the Confederate force from reaching Five Forks until midmorning. When the Confederates reached Five Forks, they began to improve the trenches and fortifications, including establishing a return or refusal of the line running north of the left or eastern side of their trenches. While attention was given to improving the refused left flank, Pickett did not have the earthwork line that had been initially constructed when his men had reached Five Forks much improved when his men returned from Dinwiddie Court House. Not only did the line consist only of slim pine logs with a shallow ditch in front but Pickett&#x27;s disposition of forces was poor. The cavalry in particular were placed in wooded areas inundated by heavy streams so that they could only move to the front by a narrow road.

After Pickett returned to Five Forks, he supposedly received Robert E. Lee&#x27;s telegram ordering him to hold Five Forks &quot;at all hazards.&quot; Historian Edward Longacre notes that this story came from Pickett&#x27;s widow, La Salle Corbell Pickett, who has become known for her fictitious accounts of episodes of Pickett&#x27;s career. Longacre states that no copy of the telegram has ever been found. He also writes that Pickett&#x27;s campaign report only says that Lee ordered him to hold his position &quot;so as to protect the road to Ford&#x27;s Depot,&quot; from Five Forks and that he asked Lee to create a diversion for his men. Longacre does acknowledge that many historians have accepted the story of Lee&#x27;s command verbatim.

===Prelude to Five Forks===

Warren&#x27;s gains along the White Oak Road on March 31, 1865 and the movement of Warren&#x27;s divisions which sent Pickett&#x27;s men back to Five Forks from Dinwiddie Court House and later positioned his corps with Sheridan&#x27;s force set the stage for the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Five Forks the day after the battle and the Union breakthrough at the Third Battle of Petersburg on April 2, 1865.

<text>Nick Mamatas () (born February 20, 1972) is an American horror, science fiction and fantasy author and editor for Haikasoru&#x27;s line of translated Japanese science fiction novels for Viz Media. His fiction has been nominated for a number of awards, including several Bram Stoker Awards. He has also been recognised for his editorial work with a Bram Stoker Award, as well as World Fantasy Award and Hugo Award nominations. He funded his early writing career by producing term papers for college students, which gained him some notoriety when he described this experience in an essay for Drexel University&#x27;s online magazine &quot;The Smart Set&quot;.

==Biography==

Nick Mamatas was born on Long Island, New York and attended Stony Brook University and New School University. He is also a graduate of the MFA program in creative and professional writing at Western Connecticut State University, which he attended only after publishing a number of books, short stories, and articles. During his early writing career he wrote not just nonfiction but also worked in a essay mill as a ghostwriter for college students needing term papers, an experience he later described in an essay called &quot;The Term Paper Artist&quot;. His non-fiction work has appeared in &quot;Razor Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and various disinformation books and BenBella Books&#x27; Smart Pop Books anthologies. His parents are Greeks from the island of Icaria.

==Career and themes==

Mamatas is most known for his horror and dark fiction but claims broad influences. Writer Laird Barron described the short fictions in &quot;You Might Sleep...&quot; as running &quot;the gamut of science fiction, fantasy, metafiction, horror, generic lit, to the realms of the effectively unclassifiable&quot;.

&quot;The Internet Review of Science Fiction&quot;, reviewing &quot;You Might Sleep&quot;, contends that &quot;J.D. Salinger [is] an obvious but unacknowledged influence&quot; and also compares Mamatas&#x27; work to &quot;Lewis Carroll with an ISP, Mishima hammering out his death poem on a BlackBerry or Harlan Ellison hyped up on crystal meth...&quot; while suggesting a certain immaturity to Mamatas&#x27;s themes: &quot;Despite his tremendous gifts, Mamatas dares little. One wonders how he would handle more profound materials, how his narrative sorcery might encompass (for example) bereavement, real tragedy or loss of self through enlightenment or love.&quot;

A thematic touchstone for Mamatas is H.P. Lovecraft. His novel &quot;Move Under Ground&quot;, which combines Lovecraftian and Beat themes, was declared one of the best Cthulhu Mythos stories not written by Lovecraft by Kenneth Hite in the book &quot;Cthulhu 101.&quot; Mark Halcomb of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; reviewed the book and its peculiar meshing of Lovecraft and Kerouac, writing, in part, &quot;In fact, Kerouac&#x27;s &#x27;bebop prosody&#x27; and the Cthulhu mythos dovetail nicely, and what seems at first like literary stunt-casting actually gives Mamatas room to recast the Beats&#x27; fall from grace in fanciful terms unhindered by their tricky psychology, the strictures of reality and realism—or lingering platitudes.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewed &quot;Move Under Ground&quot;, discussing the novel&#x27;s &quot;credible pastiche&quot; of Kerouac&#x27;s voice and declared the book &quot;sophisticated, progressive horror...&quot;

A number of his short works, such as the novelette &quot;Real People Slash&quot; and the flash fiction &quot;And Then And Then And Then&quot;, also explicitly combine Lovecraftian themes with the voices of non-fantastical literature. The short story &quot;That of Which We Speak When We Speak of the Unspeakable&quot;, first published in the anthology &quot;Lovecraft Unbound&quot; is a pastiche of Lovecraft and several of the works of Raymond Carver. &quot;The Damned Highway&quot; combines a character based heavily on Hunter S. Thompson and Lovecraftian themes.

Satire is also a significant element of Mamatas&#x27;s fiction. Ed Park, writing for his online &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; review column, described Mamatas&#x27;s &quot;Under My Roof&quot;—a short novel about the formation of a microstate on Long Island—as an &quot;accurate, fast-moving satire that transcends mere target shooting by virtue of its narrator, Daniel’s 12-year-old son Herbie&quot;. A starred review in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; for the same title also highlighted the satirical elements in the work, declaring: &quot;A big-bang ending caps the fast-paced novel, and there&#x27;s much fun to be had watching Mamatas...merrily skewer his targets.&quot;

Mamatas&#x27;s nonfiction work includes essays on publishing, digital culture, and politics. His &quot;Village Voice&quot; piece on the Otherkin phenomenon is cited as one of the earliest national publications on the subculture. His essay about his settlement with the RIAA for file-sharing has been cited in several law reviews, as it is a relatively rare first-person account of the process of settlement with the RIAA. Essays from &quot;The Smart Set&quot;, &quot;Village Voice&quot;, &quot;The Writer&quot; and Tim Pratt&#x27;s fanzine &quot;Flytrap&quot; were compiled, along with original material, into the writing handbook &quot;Starve Better&quot; in 2011, and published by Apex Publications His essay &quot;The Term Paper Artist&quot; originally from &quot;The Smart Set&quot;, about his experiences as an academic ghostwriter for pay, has been discussed on National Public Radio and reprinted in a pair of textbooks, both published by Nelson Education.

<text>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is a component of the United States government&#x27;s Department of Defense responsible for developing a comprehensive defense against ballistic missiles. It had its origins in the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) which was established in 1983 by Ronald Reagan and which was headed by Lt. General James Alan Abrahamson. Under the Strategic Defense Initiative&#x27;s Innovative Sciences and Technology Office headed by physicist and engineer Dr. James Ionson, the investment was predominantly made in basic research at national laboratories, universities, and in industry. These programs have continued to be key sources of funding for top research scientists in the fields of high-energy physics, advanced materials, nuclear research, supercomputing/computation, and many other critical science and engineering disciplines—funding which indirectly supports other research work by top scientists, and which was most politically viable to fund from appropriations for national defense. It was renamed the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization in 1993, and then renamed the Missile Defense Agency in 2002. The current director is Lieutenant General Heath A. Collins.

Rapid changes in the strategic environment due to the rapid dissolution of the Soviet Union led, in 1993, to Bill Clinton focusing on theater ballistic missiles and similar threats, and renaming it the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, BMDO. With another change to a more global focus made by George W. Bush, in 2002 the organization became the Missile Defense Agency.

The Missile Defense Agency is partially or wholly responsible for the development of several ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems, including the Patriot PAC-3, Aegis BMD, THAAD and the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system with a cost of $246 billion. They also led the development of numerous other projects, including the Multiple Kill Vehicle and the newer Multi-Object Kill Vehicle, the Kinetic Energy Interceptor and the Airborne Laser. As the inheritor of the SDI and BMDO work, the MDA continues to fund fundamental research in high-energy physics, supercomputing/computation, advanced materials, and many other science and engineering disciplines.

==Mission statement==
The MDA currently publishes the following mission statement:

The National Defense Authorization Act is cited as the original source of the MDA&#x27;s mission:

==International mission==
Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) must be capable of operating in different regions of the world to ensure the success of the MDA mission. The International Strategy was approved by the MDA Director in 2007. The general strategy for international efforts is:
:Outreach: Communicate the importance of missile defense by promoting worldwide BMDS by sharing information with allies and partners.
:Capability and Interoperability: Identify and integrate U.S and partner systems to create global missile defense system. Promote interoperability among allies.
:Technology: Identify and evaluate possible international technology in support of BMDS capabilities.
:Investment: Identify and execute investment opportunities with allies and partners.
:Workforce: Shape a qualified workforce to execute the MDA International Strategy.

As of 2017 MDA was working on facilities in Germany, Romania, Poland, Japan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

==Potential threats against the United States==
Ballistic missile systems using advanced liquid- or solid-propellant propulsion are becoming more mobile, accurate and capable of striking targets over longer distances and are proliferating worldwide.
* Iran currently has short- and medium- range missiles with guidance systems. Iran&#x27;s launch of a medium range, solid fuel ballistic missile demonstrates its ability to hit targets in Israel and southern Europe. Iran also successfully launched the Safir Space Launch Vehicle on Feb 2, 2009. It was then speculated that development of an ICBM was not far behind. Intelligence reports that a missile could have been built sometime between 2010 and 2015 perhaps using help from Russian and North Korean technology. Iran also recently developed a hypersonic ballistic missile in 2022, which can move fifteen times the speed of sound and can reach U.S. and European targets, as well as the U.S. mainland, in 15 minutes.
* North Korea currently deploys a Nodong ballistic missile capable of hitting Japan and South Korea, and is developing a new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) which could reach Guam and the Aleutian Islands. They also successfully demonstrated the staging and separation technologies required to launch a Taepo-Dong 2 ICBM, which has the capability to reach the United States. The Taepodong missile was first tested in 2006, and failed 40 seconds into midflight. North Korean missiles are notoriously unreliable, and many of the DPRK&#x27;s missile tests have failed, including the most recent Taepodong-2 launches in 2009 and 2012, and a failed launch of the BM25 Musudan in 2016. On 1 January 2017, North Korea announced its final preparation for a test of an ICBM, for the first time. On 6 March 2017, North Korea launched four missiles from Tongchang-ri, a known long-range missile site at 7:36 a.m. local time, one of which landed in the Sea of Japan, with the remaining three missiles landing in Japan&#x27;s economic zone. On July 4, 2017 North Korea launched a ballistic missile that had the potential to be an ICBM. It flew through space and landed in the Sea of Japan. &quot;The launch continues to demonstrate that North Korea poses a threat to the United States and our allies,&quot; a Pentagon statement said.
* Syria has been identified as a host for short-range ballistic missiles (as it acquires equipment from North Korea and Iran).

===Defense of Guam===
MDA will be using multiple technologies to defend Guam.

==Categories==

MDA divides its systems into four phases: boost; ascent; mid-course; and terminal. Each of these corresponds to a different phase of the threat ballistic missile flight regime. Each phase offers different advantages and disadvantages to a missile defense system (see missile defense classified by trajectory phase), and the geography of each defended area dictates the types of systems which can be employed. The resultant flexible and layered defense approach concept is believed to improve overall defense effectiveness. The more opportunities a system has to neutralize a threat (e.g., by shooting down a missile), the better the chance of success.

Activities have also been categorized as fulfilling the goals of one of five &quot;blocks&quot;. For example, &quot;block 4.0&quot; was stated as &quot;Defend Allies and Deployed Forces in Europe from Limited Iranian Long-Range Threats and Expand Protection of U.S. Homeland&quot;. It included the US missile defense complex in Poland to be constructed, and the European Mid-course Radar (EMR), currently located at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site at Kwajalein Atoll, which was to have been modified and relocated to the Czech Republic.

On 17 September 2009, the Obama administration scrapped the &quot;block 4.0&quot; plan, in favor of a new so-called &quot;European Phased Adaptive Approach&quot; (EPAA).

===Boost phase===
Can intercept all ranges of missiles, but the missile boost phase is only from one to five minutes. It is the best time to track the missile because it is bright and hot. The missile defense interceptors and sensors must be in close proximity to the launch, which is not always possible. This is the most desirable interception phase because it destroys the missile early in flight at its most vulnerable point and the debris will typically fall on the launching nations&#x27; territory.

===Ascent phase===
This is the phase after powered flight but before the apogee. It is significantly less challenging than boost phase intercepts, less costly, minimizes the potential impact of debris, and reduces the number of interceptors required to defeat a raid of missiles.

===Midcourse phase===
This phase begins after the booster burns out and begins coasting in space. This can last as long as 20 minutes. Any debris remaining will burn up as it enters the atmosphere. Ground-based missile defense systems can defend from long-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in this phase. Mobile elements can defend against medium and short ranged missiles in midcourse.

===Terminal phase===
This phase is the last chance to intercept the warhead. This contains the least-desirable Interception Point (IP) because there is little room for error and the interception will probably occur close to the defended target.

== Defenses ==

=== Boost phase defense ===
Research and development:
* Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI) – In December 2003, MDA awarded a contract to Northrop Grumman for developing and testing. It will have to be launched from a location not too far from the launch site of the target missile (and is therefore less suitable against large countries), it has to be fired very soon after launch of the target, and it has to be very fast itself (6 km/s). In 2009, the Department of Defense and MDA determined the technological issues were excessive and cancelled the program, allocating no funding for it in its later budget submission.
* Boeing YAL-1 Airborne Laser (ABL) – Team ABL proposed and won the contract for this system in 1996. A high-energy laser mounted on a converted 747 airliner was used to intercept a test target in January 2010, and the following month, successfully destroyed two test missiles. While the program has been cancelled due to concerns about its practicality with present technology (while successful the system was still extremely short ranged, likely needing to fly in heavily defended space to make an interception) the YAL-1 served to demonstrate the potential of such a system. The capabilities of being deployed rapidly to any part of the world and of intercepting a large number of missiles would make a future system extremely attractive. However, the entire concept was deemed infeasible and cancelled without successors in December 2011. 
* Network Centric Airborne Defense Element (NCADE) – On September 18, 2008 Raytheon announced it had been awarded a $10 million contract to continue research and development of NCADE, a missile defense system based on the AIM-120 AMRAAM.
One can distinguish disabling the warheads and just disabling the boosting capability. The latter has the risk of &quot;shortfall&quot;: damage in countries between the launch site and the target location.

See also APS report.

=== Ascent phase defense ===
Research and development:
* Ascent phase intercept (API) – Emerging intercept technologies are being developed and designed to defeat launched missiles in their ascent phase. This phase is after the boost phase and prior to the threat missile&#x27;s apogee (midcourse). The Ascent phase intercept program is still classified so there is little information on it.

=== Midcourse (ballistic) phase defense ===
In use:
* Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD)
* Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis BMD)
Research and development:
* Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV, originally Miniature Kill Vehicle): the Department of Defense has canceled the MKV program for the time being.

=== Hypersonic glide phase defense ===
Research and development:
::&quot;This section included material from United States Army Futures Command&quot; 
By 2021, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) realized that it almost had a countermeasure to hypersonic boost-glide weapons, by using existing data on the adversary hypersonic systems which were gathered from existing US satellite and ground-based sensors. MDA then fed this data into its existing systems models, and concluded that the adversary hypersonic weapon&#x27;s glide phase offered the best chance for MDA to intercept it. MDA next proffered a request for information (RFI) from the defense community for building interceptors (denoted the GPI —glide phase interceptor) against the glide phase of that hypersonic weapon. GPIs would be guided by Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensors (HBTSS). These GPI interceptors could first be offered to the Navy for Aegis to intercept using the C2BMC, and later to the Army for THAAD to intercept using IBCS. By 2024, a first test of the hypersonic tracking sensors was imminent.

=== Terminal phase defense ===
In use:
* Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
* PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3)
* Arrow missile, a joint effort between the U.S. and Israel
Research and development:
* Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), co-developmental program of the United States Department of Defense, Germany and Italy.

The jail is known in Latter Day Saint movement due to the imprisonment of its founder, Joseph Smith, and some of his associates during the 1838 Mormon War.

The location is now a visitors’ center operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and includes an indoor cut-away reconstruction of the jail on its original site, at 216 North Main.

==History==

===Missouri settlements===
Followers of Joseph Smith from Kirtland, Ohio, were among the first settlers in the Kansas City metropolitan area, locating about southeast of the jail site in Independence, Jackson County, Missouri, in 1831. After Smith proclaimed that Independence was the location of the biblical Garden of Eden and the City of Zion should be located there, settlers in the area feared that they would lose political control of the county to the growing numbers of immigrating Mormons. Tensions led to violence when a battle between the two groups broke out on the banks of the Blue River (Missouri). In November 1833, the Mormons were violently driven from Independence and compelled to resettle temporarily in Clay County.

In 1836, Smith&#x27;s followers then moved northeast of Liberty to establish Far West in Caldwell County, Missouri, which had been established by the state especially for them. A few settlers led by Lyman Wight moved about further north to Daviess County, Missouri, where he established a ferry across the Grand River north of Gallatin at Adam-ondi-Ahman.

On May 18, 1838, Smith proclaimed that the land around Wight&#x27;s ferry was the area to which Adam was banished after leaving the Garden of Eden, and that it would be a gathering spot prior to the Millennium. Within three months, the population of Daviess County exploded to 1,500.

===Mormon War===
Non-Mormon settlers in Daviess County, fearing that they would lose control of the county, attempted to prevent Mormons from voting during the Gallatin Election Day Battle on August 6, 1838. This was the first skirmish in what became known as the 1838 Mormon War, in which men would be killed and property destroyed by both sides. Increasing vigilantism on both sides led to the burning of several farms and homes, and also of the towns of Gallatin and Millport. The climax of the conflict came when Captain Samuel Bogart of the Missouri state militia took 3 Mormon men as prisoners, fearing the Mormons were going to raze Richmond and Liberty. Rumors consequently spread through Far West that a &quot;mob&quot; was going to execute the 3 men, and the tensions culminated in October 1838 when Mormon militia forces engaged the state militia unit on the banks of Crooked River, in what became known as the Battle of Crooked River.

Following this engagement, on October 27, 1838, Lilburn W. Boggs, governor of the state of Missouri, issued Missouri Executive Order 44: &quot;The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace ... their outrages are beyond all description.&quot;

===Smith surrenders===
General Samuel D. Lucas, leading a militia of 2500 men informed the Mormons at Far West that &quot;they would massacre every man, woman and child&quot; if Smith and several others were not given up. Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt, Lyman Wight, and George W. Robinson surrendered on November 1.

A secret and illegal court martial was held following Smith&#x27;s surrender. Smith and his companions were not aware of the proceeding until after it was over. At about midnight on November 1, General Lucas issued the following order to General Alexander William Doniphan: &quot;Sir:-- You will take Joseph Smith and the other prisoners into the public square at Far West and shoot them at 9 o-clock tomorrow morning.&quot;

General Doniphan refused to obey the order: &quot;It is cold-blooded murder. I will not obey your order. My brigade shall march for Liberty [township] tomorrow morning at 8 o&#x27;clock; and if you execute these men, I will hold you responsible before an earthly tribunal, so help me God.&quot;

General John Bullock Clark had been appointed by Governor Boggs to enforce the extermination order. He arrived and took command of the combined force on November 4. On November 5, he had an additional 56 men arrested and gave a speech in the public square at Far West. He outlined the terms of the treaty that General Lucas had previously negotiated which stripped the Mormons of all their arms and property, and required them to leave the state immediately.

===Preliminary hearing===
On November 9, Colonel Sterling Price and a force of seventy men took Smith and his companions to Richmond, Missouri, for a preliminary hearing before Austin Augustus King. The hearing began on November 13 and continued for approximately two weeks.

The defense attorneys consisted of Doniphan and David Rice Atchison.

During the hearing, Smith and his companions were not permitted to call witnesses for their defense, as sometimes was allowed during such proceedings, and were abused in various ways. On or about November 30, 1838, the Richmond court committed Smith and his companions, Hyrum Smith, Lyman Wight, Alexander McRae, Caleb Baldwin, and Sidney Rigdon, to Liberty Jail to await trial. They were taken from Richmond to Liberty Jail in a large, heavy wagon.

Many residents of Liberty and the surrounding area turned out to watch their arrival and some expressed their disappointment in their ordinary appearance. As the prisoners climbed the stairs and entered the jail, Smith paused on the platform at the top of the stairs, turned to face the crowd, raised his hat and said, &quot;Good afternoon, gentlemen&quot; before entering the jail.

While Smith and his companions were incarcerated in the lower dungeon room, the upper room was used by their guards.

===Change of venue and escape===
On January 25, 1839, Sidney Rigdon was released from jail following an eloquent self-defense in the Clay County Courthouse. Because of threats, however, he stayed at the jail until February 5, 1839.

On April 6, 1839, Smith and the prisoners were transferred to the Daviess County Jail in Gallatin where a grand jury was investigating. The grand jury was to indict them on murder, treason, burglary, arson, larceny, theft, and stealing. Smith and the followers were to appeal for a change of venue to Marion County, Missouri, in the northeast corner of the state near the village of Commerce, Illinois. However, the venue was changed to Boone County, Missouri.

On April 15, 1839, en route to Boone County, Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Lyman Wight, Alexander McRae, and Caleb Baldwin were allowed to escape after the sheriff and three of their guards drank whiskey while the fourth guard helped them saddle their horses for the escape. They arrived in Quincy, Illinois, on April 22 and from there were to regroup at Nauvoo.

==Smith&#x27;s writings==
On March 20, 1839, while incarcerated in Liberty Jail, Joseph Smith dictated a letter to Edward Partridge which was recorded by Caleb Baldwin and Alexander McRae. Parts of the letter were canonized and are today known in the LDS canon as Sections 121, 122, and 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants.

 begins with Smith asking God for help with the difficulties being experienced by Latter Day Saints, then has God&#x27;s response as he comforts Joseph Smith and discusses righteous and unrighteous dominion. talks about expectations for Smith&#x27;s present and future circumstances and God&#x27;s promise that he will always be with him. instructs Latter Day Saints to document their difficulties and ask the federal government of the United States for assistance.

==The Jail==

===Construction===
Liberty Jail was double walled with a timber structure. The exterior dimensions of the jail were twenty-two and a half feet long, twenty-two feet wide, and twelve feet tall. Inside dimensions were fourteen and a half feet by fourteen feet. The building was divided into two levels, with a six and a half foot ceiling in the lower level and a seven-foot ceiling in the upper room. [&quot;Liberty Jail was a cold, poorly ventilated stone dungeon, with four-foot-thick walls and two small, barred windows. The outside measured twenty-two and a half feet long, twenty-two feet wide, with twelve-foot-high walls, making the interior measurements about four-teen by fourteen by twelve feet. It had an upper level and a lower level with access to the lower level through a hole in the upper floor. Joseph Smith was six feet tall and could not stand up straight in the lower level. They were forced to sleep on filthy straw on the hard floor or on split logs. They were served filthy food and suffered terribly from the winter cold.&quot; [Taken from page 199&lt;/ref&gt; David J. Ridges&#x27; Your Study of The Doctrine and Covenants Made Easier Part Three: Section 94 Through Section 138, 2nd Edition 2020, published by Cedar Fort, Springville, Utah&lt;/ref&gt;] Note:[average temperatures in Carthage: Nov. 1838 F. 38.5, C. 3.6; Dec. 1838 F. 27.4, C. - 2.6; Jan. 1839 F. 37.2, C. 2.9; Feb. 1839 F. 38.5, C 3.6 Statistics taken from https://www.weather.
gov/media/lsx/climate/stl/temp/temp_stl_monthly_seasonal_averages.pdf]

The outer walls were stone masonry construction, two feet thick. The inner walls and ceilings were hewn oak logs, about a foot square. There was about a foot of space between the outside masonry walls and the inside oak walls. This space and the space above the upper ceiling were filled with loose rock to discourage escape.

The only openings in the lower level were two iron barred windows, two feet wide and six inches (152 mm) high, and an opening in the ceiling to the upper room with a heavy wooden door. The upper room had two larger iron barred windows, two feet wide by one foot tall, along with a heavy oak door. Outside the door was a small platform with a stairway down to ground level.

===Conditions===
Smith and his companions were imprisoned in Liberty Jail for four and a half months during the coldest part of the Missouri winter.

Food was scanty, of poor quality and frequently poisoned. Some of the prisoners suspected that they were sometimes fed human flesh, but comments by the guards regarding &quot;Mormon beef&quot; probably had reference to cattle stolen from the Mormons. Their friends on the outside were occasionally able to bring them wholesome food.

No bedding was provided, so the prisoners slept on the stone floor with only a bit of loose straw for comfort.

===Visitors===

The prisoners were allowed visitors from time to time. Alexander McRae recorded visits by Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, George A. Smith, Don Carlos Smith, Benjamin Covey, James Sloan, Alanson Ripley, and Porter Rockwell. In March, Frederick G. Williams came with Presendia H. Buell, but the jailer, concerned that tools could be passed, denied them entrance.

Mary Smith visited her husband, Hyrum Smith, in February with their three-month-old son, Joseph F. Smith, who was named and blessed by his father in custody. Her sister, Mercy Fielding Thompson, accompanied her. Emma Smith also visited her husband Joseph multiple times with their children.
==Restoration==
The jail was torn down although the walls of the dungeon were still visible when a house was built over it. In 1939, the property was purchased by the LDS Church and in 1963 Joseph Fielding Smith presided over the establishment of a partial reconstruction of the jail wholly within a museum. The reconstructed jail includes a front limestone facade on the east side and a cut away on the west side so visitors see the upper area and the lower dungeon which has mannequins representing Smith and the other prisoners. A replica of the Liberty Jail was constructed in 2014 at the Church History Museum in Salt Lake City, Utah. The door to the original jail passed into the ownership of Community of Christ after 1888, and was purchased by the LDS Church on March 5, 2024, as part of a larger transfer of historically significant properties and artifacts.

<doc id="1063286" wikidata="Q2746978" url="?curid=1063286" title="History of anarchism">
<text>According to different scholars, the history of anarchism either goes back to ancient and prehistoric ideologies and social structures, or begins in the 19th century as a formal movement. As scholars and anarchist philosophers have held a range of views on what anarchism means, it is difficult to outline its history unambiguously. Some feel anarchism is a distinct, well-defined movement stemming from 19th-century class conflict, while others identify anarchist traits long before the earliest civilisations existed.

Prehistoric society existed without formal hierarchies, which some anthropologists have described as similar to anarchism. The first traces of formal anarchist thought can be found in ancient Greece and China, where numerous philosophers questioned the necessity of the state and declared the moral right of the individual to live free from coercion. During the Middle Ages, some religious sects espoused libertarian thought, and the Age of Enlightenment, and the attendant rise of rationalism and science, signalled the birth of the modern anarchist movement.

Alongside Marxism, modern anarchism was a significant part of the workers&#x27; movement at the end of the 19th century. Modernism, industrialisation, reaction to capitalism and mass migration helped anarchism to flourish and to spread around the globe. Major anarchist schools of thought sprouted up as anarchism grew as a social movement, particularly anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism, and individualist anarchism. As the workers&#x27; movement grew, the divide between anarchists and Marxists grew as well. The two currents formally split at the fifth congress of the First International in 1872. Anarchists participated enthusiastically in the Russian Revolution, but as soon as the Bolsheviks established their authority, anarchist movements, most notably the Makhnovshchina and the Kronstadt rebellion, were harshly suppressed.

Anarchism played a historically prominent role during the Spanish Civil War, when an anarchist territory was established in Catalonia. Revolutionary Catalonia was organised along anarcho-syndicalist lines, with powerful labor unions in the cities and collectivised agriculture in the country, but ended in the defeat of the anarchists.

In the 1960s, anarchism re-emerged as a global political and cultural force. In association with the New Left and Post-left tendencies, anarchism has influenced social movements that espouse personal autonomy and direct democracy. It has also played major roles in the anti-globalization movement, Zapatista revolution, and Rojava revolution.

==Background==

Τhere has been some controversy over the definition of anarchism and hence its history. One group of scholars considers anarchism strictly associated with class struggle. Others feel this perspective is far too narrow. While the former group examines anarchism as a phenomenon that occurred during the 19th century, the latter group looks to ancient history to trace anarchism&#x27;s roots. Anarchist philosopher Murray Bookchin describes the continuation of the &quot;legacy of freedom&quot; of humankind (i.e. the revolutionary moments) that existed throughout history, in contrast with the &quot;legacy of domination&quot; which consists of states, capitalism and other organisational forms.

The three most common forms of defining anarchism are the &quot;etymological&quot; (an-archei, without a ruler, but anarchism is not merely a negation); the &quot;anti-statism&quot; (while this seems to be pivotal, it certainly does not describe the essence of anarchism); and the &quot;anti-authoritarian&quot; definition (denial of every kind of authority, which over-simplifies anarchism). Along with the definition debates, the question of whether it is a philosophy, a theory or a series of actions complicates the issue. Philosophy professor Alejandro de Agosta proposes that anarchism is &quot;a decentralized federation of philosophies as well as practices and ways of life, forged in different communities and affirming diverse geohistories&quot;.

==Precursors==
===Prehistoric and ancient era===
Many scholars of anarchism, including anthropologists Harold Barclay and David Graeber, claim that some form of anarchy dates back to prehistory. The longest period of human existence, that before the recorded history of human society, was without a separate class of established authority or formal political institutions. Long before anarchism emerged as a distinct perspective, humans lived for thousands of years in self-governing societies without a special ruling or political class. It was only after the rise of hierarchical societies that anarchist ideas were formulated as a critical response to, and a rejection of, coercive political institutions and hierarchical social relationships.

Taoism, which developed in ancient China, has been linked to anarchist thought by some scholars. Taoist sages Lao Tzu and Zhuang Zhou, whose principles were grounded in an &quot;anti-polity&quot; stance and a rejection of any kind of involvement in political movements or organisations, developed a philosophy of &quot;non-rule&quot; in the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. Taoists were trying to live in harmony with nature according to the precepts of their religion by doing this. There is an ongoing debate whether exhorting rulers not to rule is somehow an anarchist objective. A new generation of Taoist thinkers with anarchic leanings appeared during the chaotic Wei-Jin period. Taoism and neo-Taoism had principles more akin to a philosophical anarchisman attempt to delegitimise the state and question its moralityand were pacifist schools of thought, in contrast with their Western counterparts some centuries later. Former professor emeritus of history at California State University Milton W. Meyer has stated that in his opinion, early Taoists were &quot;early anarchists&quot; who believed in concepts often found in states such as anti-intellectualism and &quot;laissez-faire&quot;. Taoist anarchists did not believe in religious traditions such as rituals and the concepts of morality and good and evil.

Some convictions and ideas deeply held by modern anarchists were first expressed in ancient Greece. The first known political usage of the word &quot;anarchy&quot; () appeared in plays by Aeschylus and Sophocles in the fifth century BC. Ancient Greece also saw the first Western instance of anarchy as a philosophical ideal mainly, but not only, by the Cynics and Stoics. The Cynics Diogenes of Sinope and Crates of Thebes are both supposed to have advocated for anarchistic forms of society, although little remains of their writings. Their most significant contribution was the radical approach of &quot;nomos&quot; (law) and &quot;physis&quot; (nature). Contrary to the rest of Greek philosophy, aiming to blend &quot;nomos&quot; and &quot;physis&quot; in harmony, Cynics dismissed &quot;nomos&quot; (and in consequence: the authorities, hierarchies, establishments and moral code of polis) while promoting a way of life, based solely on &quot;physis&quot;. Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, who was much influenced by the Cynics, described his vision of an egalitarian utopian society around 300 BC. Zeno&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; advocates a form of anarchic society where there is no need for state structures. He argued that although the necessary instinct of self-preservation leads humans to egotism, nature has supplied a corrective to it by providing man with another instinct, namely sociability. Like many modern anarchists, he believed that if people follow their instincts, they will have no need of law courts or police, no temples and no public worship, and use no money—free gifts taking the place of monetary exchanges.

Socrates expressed some views appropriate to anarchism. He constantly questioned authority and at the centre of his philosophy stood every man&#x27;s right to freedom of consciousness. Aristippus, a pupil of Socrates and founder of the Hedonistic school, claimed that he did not wish either to rule or be ruled. He saw the State as a danger to personal autonomy. Not all ancient Greeks had anarchic tendencies. Other philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle used the term anarchy negatively in association with democracy which they mistrusted as inherently vulnerable and prone to deteriorate into tyranny.

Among the ancient precursors of anarchism are often ignored movements within ancient Judaism and Early Christianity. As more contemporary literature shows, anti-state and anti-hierarchy positions can be found in the Tanakh as well as in New Testament texts.

===Middle Ages===
In Persia during the Middle Ages a Zoroastrian prophet named Mazdak, now considered a proto-socialist, called for the abolition of private property, free love and overthrowing the king. He and his thousands of followers were massacred in 582 CE, but his teaching influenced Islamic sects in the following centuries. A theological predecessor to anarchism developed in Basra and Baghdad among Mu&#x27;tazilite ascetics and Najdiyya Khirijites. This form of revolutionary Islam was not communist or egalitarian. It did not resemble current concepts of anarchism, but preached the State was harmful, illegitimate, immoral and unnecessary.

In Europe, Christianity was overshadowing all aspects of life. The Brethren of the Free Spirit was the most notable example of heretic belief that had some vague anarchistic tendencies. They held anticleric sentiments and believed in total freedom. Even though most of their ideas were individualistic, the movement had a social impact, instigating riots and rebellions in Europe for many years. Other anarchistic religious movements in Europe during the Middle Ages included the Hussites and Adamites.

20th-century historian James Joll described anarchism as two opposing sides. In the Middle Ages, zealotic and ascetic religious movements emerged, which rejected institutions, laws and the established order. In the 18th century another anarchist stream emerged based on rationalism and logic. These two currents of anarchism later blended to form a contradictory movement that resonated with a very broad audience.

===Renaissance and early modern era===

With the spread of the Renaissance across Europe, anti-authoritarian and secular ideas re-emerged. The most prominent thinkers advocating for liberty, mainly French, were employing utopia in their works to bypass strict state censorship. In &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; (1532–1552), François Rabelais wrote of the Abby of Thelema (from ; meaning &quot;will&quot; or &quot;wish&quot;), an imaginary utopia whose motto was &quot;Do as Thou Will&quot;. Around the same time, French law student Etienne de la Boetie wrote his &quot;Discourse on Voluntary Servitude&quot; where he argued that tyranny resulted from voluntary submission and could be abolished by the people refusing to obey the authorities above them. Later still in France, Gabriel de Foigny perceived a utopia with freedom-loving people without government and no need of religion, as he wrote in &quot;The Southern Land, Known&quot;. For this, Geneva authorities jailed de Foigny. François Fénelon also used utopia to project his political views in the book &quot;Les Aventures de Télémaque&quot; that infuriated Louis XIV.

Some Reformation currents (like the radical reformist movement of Anabaptists) are sometimes credited as the religious forerunners of modern anarchism. Even though the Reformation was a religious movement and strengthened the state, it also opened the way for the humanistic values of the French Revolution. During the English Civil War, Christian anarchism found one of its most articulate exponents in Gerrard Winstanley, who was part of the Diggers movement. He published a pamphlet, &quot;The New Law of Righteousness&quot;, calling for communal ownership and social and economic organisation in small agrarian communities. Drawing on the Bible, he argued that &quot;the blessings of the earth&quot; should &quot;be common to all&quot; and &quot;none Lord over others&quot;. William Blake has also been said to have espoused an anarchistic political position.

In the New World, the first to use the term &quot;anarchy&quot; to mean something other than chaos was Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan in his &quot;Nouveaux voyages dans l&#x27;Amérique septentrionale&quot;, 1703 (&quot;New Voyages in Northern America&quot;). He described indigenous American society as having no state, laws, prisons, priests or private property as being in anarchy.

The Quaker sect, mostly because of their governance and social relations, based on their beliefs of the divine spirit universally within all people and humanity&#x27;s absolute equality, had some anarchistic tendencies; such values must have influenced Benjamin Tucker the editor and publisher of the individualist anarchist periodical &quot;Liberty&quot;.

== Early anarchism ==
=== Developments of the 18th century ===
Modern anarchism grew from the secular and humanistic thought of the Enlightenment. The scientific discoveries that preceded the Enlightenment gave thinkers of the time confidence that humans can reason for themselves. When nature was tamed through science, society could be set free. The development of anarchism was strongly influenced by the works of Jean Meslier, Baron d&#x27;Holbach, whose materialistic worldview later resonated with anarchists, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, especially in his &quot;Discourse on Inequality&quot; and arguments for the moral centrality of freedom. Rousseau affirmed the goodness in the nature of men and viewed the state as fundamentally oppressive. Denis Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Supplément au voyage de Bougainville&quot; (&quot;The Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville&quot;) was also influential.

The French Revolution stands as a landmark in the history of anarchism. The use of revolutionary violence by masses would captivate anarchists of later centuries, with such events as the Women&#x27;s March on Versailles, the Storming of the Bastille and the Réveillon riots seen as the revolutionary archetype. Anarchists came to identify with the &quot;Enragés&quot; () who expressed the demands of the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; (; commoners) who opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms. Denouncing the Jacobin dictatorship, Jean Varlet wrote in 1794 that &quot;government and revolution are incompatible, unless the people wish to set its constituted authorities in permanent insurrection against itself&quot;. In his &quot;Manifeste des Égaux&quot; (&quot;Manifesto of the Equals&quot;) of 1801, Sylvain Maréchal looked forward to the disappearance, once and for all, of &quot;the revolting distinction between rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed&quot;. The French Revolution came to depict in the minds of anarchists that as soon as rebels seize power they become the new tyrants, as evidenced by the state-orchestrated violence of the Reign of Terror. The proto-anarchist groups of &quot;Enragés&quot; and &quot;sans-culottes&quot; were ultimately executed by guillotine.

The debate over the effects of the French Revolution on the anarchist cause continues to this day. To anarchist historian Max Nettlau, the French revolution was a turning point in anarchistic thought, as it promoted the ideals of &quot;Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality&quot;. Yet he felt that the outcome did nothing more than re-shape and modernise the militaristic state. Russian revolutionary and anarchist thinker Peter Kropotkin, however, traced the origins of the anarchist movement further back, linking it to struggles against authority in feudal societies and earlier revolutionary traditions. In a more moderate approach, independent scholar Sean Sheehan points out that the French Revolution proved that even the strongest political establishments can be overthrown.

William Godwin in England was the first to develop an expression of modern anarchist thought. He is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism. He argued in &quot;Political Justice&quot; (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause the government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing a government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution. His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people&#x27;s &quot;mental enslavement&quot;, the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of one&#x27;s capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.

===Proudhon and Stirner===

Frenchman Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the founder of modern anarchism, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work &quot;What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and Government&quot; () published in 1840. In it he asks &quot;What is property?&quot;, a question that he answers with the famous accusation &quot;Property is theft&quot;. Proudhon&#x27;s theory of mutualism rejects the state, capitalism, and communism. It calls for a co-operative society in which the free associations of individuals are linked in a decentralised federation based on a &quot;Bank of the People&quot; that supplies workers with free credit. He contrasted this with what he called &quot;possession&quot;, or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, Proudhon also added that &quot;Property is liberty&quot; and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.

Mutualists would later play an important role in the First International, especially at the first two Congresses held in Geneva and Lausanne, but diminished in European influence with the rise of anarcho-communism. Instead, Mutualism would find fertile ground among American individualists in the late 19th century.

In Spain, Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal &quot;El Porvenir&quot; in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon&#x27;s ideas. Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon&#x27;s works into Spanish. He would later briefly become president of Spain in 1873 while leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party, where he tried to implement some of Proudhon&#x27;s ideas.

An influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, German philosopher Max Stirner. Stirner&#x27;s &quot;The Ego and Its Own&quot; (; also translated as &quot;The Individual and his Property&quot; or &quot;The Unique and His Property&quot;), published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy. Stirner was critical of capitalism as it creates class warfare where the rich will exploit the poor, using the state as its tool. He also rejected religions, communism and liberalism, as all of them subordinate individuals to God, a collective, or the state. According to Stirner the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality. He held that society does not exist, but &quot;the individuals are its reality&quot;. Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties&#x27; support through an act of will, which proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state. Egoist anarchists claimed that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. Stirner was proposing an individual rebellion, which would not seek to establish new institutions nor anything resembling a state.

===Revolutions of 1848===

Europe was shocked by another revolutionary wave in 1848 which started once again in Paris. The new government, consisting mostly of Jacobins, was backed by the working class but failed to implement meaningful reforms. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin were involved in the events of 1848. The failure of the revolution shaped Proudhon&#x27;s views. He became convinced that a revolution should aim to destroy authority, not grasp power. He saw capitalism as the root of social problems and government, using political tools only, as incapable of confronting the real issues. The course of events of 1848, radicalised Bakunin who, due to the failure of the revolutions, lost his confidence in any kind of reform.

Other anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution in France include Anselme Bellegarrigue, Ernest Coeurderoy and the early anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque, who was the first person to call himself a libertarian. Unlike Proudhon, Déjacque argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature&quot;. Déjacque was also a critic of Proudhon&#x27;s mutualist theory and anti-feminist views. Returning to New York, he was able to serialise his book in his periodical &quot;Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement social&quot;. The French anarchist movement, though self-described as &quot;mutualists&quot;, started gaining pace during 1860s as workers&#x27; associations began to form.

==Classical anarchism==

The decades of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries constitute the belle époque of anarchist history. In this &quot;classical&quot; era, roughly defined as the period between the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Spanish Civil War of 1936 to 1939 (or the 1840s/1860s through 1939), anarchism played a prominent role in working-class struggles (alongside Marxism) in Europe as well as in the Americas, Asia, and Oceania. Modernism, mass migration, railroads and access to printing all helped anarchists to advance their causes.

===First International and Paris Commune===

In 1864, the creation of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (IWA, also called the &quot;First International&quot;) united diverse revolutionary currents - including socialist Marxists, trade unionists, communists and anarchists. Karl Marx, a leading figure of the International, became a member of its General Council.

Four years later, in 1868, Mikhail Bakunin joined the First International with his collectivist anarchist associates. They advocated the collectivisation of property and the revolutionary overthrow of the state. Bakunin corresponded with other members of the International, seeking to establish a loose brotherhood of revolutionaries who would ensure that the coming revolution would not take an authoritarian course, in sharp contrast with other currents that were seeking to get a firm grasp on state power. Bakunin&#x27;s energy and writings about a great variety of subjects, such as education and gender equality, helped to increase his influence within the IWA. His main line was that the International should try to promote a revolution without aiming to create a mere government of &quot;experts&quot;. Workers should seek to emancipate their class with direct actions, using cooperatives, mutual credit, and strikes, but avoid participation in bourgeois politics. At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Bakunin characterised Marx&#x27;s ideas as centralist. Because of this, he predicted that if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against. Followers of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the mutualists, also opposed Marx&#x27;s state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.

Meanwhile, an uprising after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 to 1871 led to the formation of the Paris Commune in March 1871. Anarchists had a prominent role in the Commune,
next to Blanquists and - to a lesser extent - Marxists. The uprising was greatly influenced by anarchists and had a great impact on anarchist history. Radical socialist views, like Proudhonian federalism, were implemented to a small extent. Most importantly, the workers proved they could run their own services and factories. After the defeat of the Commune, anarchists like Eugène Varlin, Louise Michel, and Élisée Reclus were shot or imprisoned. The French Third Republic persecuted socialist supporters for a decade. Leading members of the International who survived the bloody suppression of the Commune fled to Switzerland, where the Anarchist St. Imier International would form in 1872.

In 1872, the conflict between Marxists and anarchists climaxed. Marx had, since 1871, proposed the creation of a political party, which anarchists found to be an appalling and unacceptable prospect. Various groups (including Italian sections, the Belgian Federation and the Jura Federation) rejected Marx&#x27;s proposition at the 1872 Hague Congress. They saw it as an attempt to create state socialism that would ultimately fail to emancipate humanity. In contrast, they proposed political struggle through social revolution. Finally, anarchists were expelled from the First International. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.

===Emergence of anarcho-communism===

Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the 1789 French Revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International. It was the convincing critique of Carlo Cafiero and Errico Malatesta that paved the way for anarcho-communism to surpass collectivism; they argued that collectivism would inevitably end in competition and inequality. Essayist Alain Pengam comments that between 1880 and 1890 the perspective of a revolution was thought to be closed. Anarcho-communists had anti-organisational tendencies, opposed political and trade-union struggles (such as the eight-hour day) as being overly reformist, and in some cases favoured acts of terrorism. Finding themselves increasingly isolated, they opted to join the workers&#x27; movements after 1890.

With the aid of Peter Kropotkin&#x27;s optimism and persuasive writing, anarcho-communism became the major anarchist current in Europe and abroad—except in Spain where anarcho-syndicalism prevailed. The theoretical work of Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta grew in importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections. Kropotkin elaborated on the theory behind the revolution of anarcho-communism saying, &quot;it is the risen people who are the real agent and not the working class organised in the enterprise (the cells of the capitalist mode of production) and seeking to assert itself as labour power, as a more &#x27;rational&#x27; industrial body or social brain (manager) than the employers&quot;.

=== Organised labour and syndicalism ===

Due to a high influx of European immigrants, Chicago was the centre of the American anarchist movement during the 19th century. On 1 May 1886, a general strike was called in several United States cities with the demand of an eight-hour work day, and anarchists allied themselves with the workers&#x27; movement despite seeing the objective as reformist. On May 3, a fight broke out in Chicago when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line. Two workers died when police opened fire on the crowd. The next day anarchists staged a rally at Chicago&#x27;s Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown from a side alley. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists, directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally, were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officers. They became international political celebrities in the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide before his execution. The incident became known as the Haymarket affair and was a setback for the movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. It had the secondary purpose of memorialising those workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a one-off event, by the following year the commemoration of International Workers&#x27; Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international workers&#x27; holiday.

Syndicalism saw its heights from 1894 to 1914, with roots reaching back to 19th century labour movements and the trade unionists of the First International. Subsequently, anarcho-syndicalism&#x27;s main tenet that economic struggles come before political ones can be traced back to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and was the same issue that led to the schism of the First International. Anarcho-syndicalists advocated that labour syndicates should focus not only on the conditions and wages of workers but also on revolutionary objectives.

The French Confédération Générale du Travail (General Confederation of Labour) was one of Europe&#x27;s most prominent syndicalist organisations and, while rejecting illegalism, was heavily influenced by anarchism. As a grassroots organisation and lab for revolutionary ideas, its structure was exported to other like-minded European organisations. The organisation would later take a reformist path after 1914.

In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from most European countries, the United States, Japan and Latin America. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and trade unionism. Errico Malatesta and Pierre Monatte strongly disagreed on this issue. Monatte thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions for a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing the phenomenon of professional union officials as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker. Malatesta warned that the syndicalist aims were of perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end goal and consequently must refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.

In Spain, syndicalism had grown significantly during the 1880s but the first anarchist related organisations didn&#x27;t flourish. In 1910 however, the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour or CNT) was founded and gradually became entwined with anarchism. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers&#x27; Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922. The success of the CNT stimulated the spread of anarcho-syndicalism in Latin America. The Federación Obrera Regional Argentina (Argentine Regional Workers&#x27; Federation) reached a quarter of a million members, surpassing social democratic unions.

By the early 20th century, revolutionary syndicalism had spread across the world, from Latin America to Eastern Europe and Asia, with most of its activity then taking place outside of Western Europe.

===Propaganda of the deed===


The use of revolutionary political violence, known as propaganda of the deed, was employed by a small but influential part of the anarchist movement over a roughly four decade period, beginning in the 1880s. It was conceived as a form of insurrectionary action used to provoke and inspire the masses to revolution. This was at a time when anarchists were persecuted and revolutionaries were becoming more isolated. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution or the exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts. But the prime factor in the rise of propaganda of the deed, as historian Constance Bantman outlines, was the writings of Russian revolutionaries between 1869 and 1891, namely of Mikhail Bakunin and Sergei Nechaev who developed significant insurrectionary strategies.

Paul Brousse, a medical doctor and active militant of violent insurrection, popularised the actions of propaganda of the deed. In the United States, Johann Most advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda&quot;. Russian anarchist-communists employed terrorism and illegal acts in their struggle. Numerous heads of state were assassinated or attacked by members of the anarchist movement. In 1901, the Polish-American anarchist Leon Czolgosz assassinated the president of the United States, William McKinley. Emma Goldman, who was erroneously suspected of being involved, expressed some sympathy for Czolgosz and incurred a great deal of negative publicity. Goldman also supported Alexander Berkman in his failed assassination attempt of steel industrialist Henry Frick in the wake of the Homestead Strike, and she wrote about how these small acts of violence were incomparable to the deluge of violence regularly committed by the state and capital. In Europe, a wave of illegalism (the embracement of a criminal way of life) spread throughout the anarchist movement, with Marius Jacob, Ravachol, intellectual Émile Henry and the Bonnot Gang being notable examples. The Bonnot Gang in particular justified illegal and violent behavior by claiming that they were &quot;taking back&quot; property that did not rightfully belong to capitalists. In Russia, Narodnaya Volya (&quot;People&#x27;s Will&quot; which was not an anarchist organisation but nevertheless drew inspiration from Bakunin&#x27;s work), assassinated Tsar Alexander II in 1881 and gained some popular support. However, for the most part, the anarchist movement in Russia remained marginal in the following years. In the Ottoman Empire, the Boatmen of Thessaloniki were a Bulgarian anarchist revolutionary organisation active 1898-1903.

As early as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from both illegalism and propaganda of the deed. Peter Kropotkin, for example, wrote in &quot;Le Révolté&quot; that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;. State repression of the anarchist and labour movements, including the infamous 1894 French &quot;lois scélérates&quot; (&quot;villainous laws&quot;), following a number of successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although state repression may have played an equal role in their adoption. Early proponents of propaganda of the deed, like Alexander Berkman, started to question the legitimacy of violence as a tactic. A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action through the trade union movement.

By the end of the 19th century, it became clear that propaganda of the deed was not going to spark a revolution. Though it was employed by only a minority of anarchists, it gave anarchism a violent reputation and it isolated anarchists from broader social movements. It was abandoned by the majority of the anarchist movement in the early 20th century.

===Revolutionary wave===

Anarchists were involved in the Strandzha Commune and Krusevo Republic established in Macedonia in Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising of 1903, and in the Mexican Revolution of 1910. The revolutionary wave of 1917–23 saw varying degrees of active participation by anarchists. Following the failed 1905 Russian Revolution, anarchists participated again in both the February and October revolutions of 1917 and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik cause. Prior to the revolution, Lenin had won over anarchists and syndicalists with high praises in his 1917 work &quot;The State and Revolution&quot;. However, anarchist objections quickly arose. They opposed, for example, the slogan, &quot;All power to the Soviet&quot;. The dictatorship of the proletariat was incompatible with the libertarian views of the anarchists, and co-operation shortly ended as the Bolsheviks soon turned against anarchists and other left-wing opposition. After their grasp on power was stabilized, the Bolsheviks crushed the anarchists. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. Anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine. There, the Makhnovshchina established an autonomous region of four hundred square miles with a population of approximately seven million. Anarchists who had fought in the Russian Civil War at first against the anti-Bolshevik White Army now also fought the Red Army, Ukrainian People&#x27;s Army, and the German and Austrian forces who fought under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. This conflict culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, a garrison in Kronstadt where Baltic Fleet sailors and citizens made demands for reforms. The new government suppressed the rebellion. The Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine, led by Nestor Makhno, continued to fight until August 1921 when it was crushed by the state only months after the Kronstadt rebellion.

Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who had been deported from the U.S. in 1917, were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of state control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, Mikhail Bakunin&#x27;s predictions on the consequences of Marxist rule, that the leaders of the new socialist state would become the new ruling class, had proven true. In 1920, Peter Kropotkin published a &quot;Message to the Workers of the West&quot; explaining the false path of state socialism was doomed to fail. Disappointed with the course of events, Goldman and Berkman fled the USSR in 1921, the same year Kropotkin died. By 1925, anarchism was banned under the Bolshevik regime. The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw the Bolsheviks&#x27; success as setting an example, and communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the Confédération Générale du Travail (General Confederation of Labour) and Industrial Workers of the World left these organisations to join the Communist International.

From the collapse of anarchism in the newly formed Soviet Union, two anarchist trends arose. The first, platformism, was propagated in the anarchist journal &quot;Dielo Truda&quot; by a group of Russian exiles, including Nestor Makhno. Their main objective, as proponent Piotr Arsinov wrote, was to create a non-hierarchical party that would offer &quot;common organisation of our forces on a basis of collective responsibility and collective methods of action&quot;. They considered that a lack of organisation was a basic reason of why anarchism had failed. Platformism had the purpose of providing a strategy for class struggle, as Bakunin and Kropotkin had suggested before. The other trend emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism, since it had similarities to party structure. Anarchist intellectual Volin was one of the most notable opponents of platformism, and he pointed toward to what is today known as synthesis anarchism.

During the German Revolution of 1918–1919, anarchists Gustav Landauer and Erich Mühsam took important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures of the Bavarian Soviet Republic. In Italy, the syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana (Italian Syndicalist Union), had half a million members. It played a prominent role in events known as the &quot;Biennio Rosso&quot; (&quot;Two Red Years&quot;) and &quot;Settimana Rossa&quot; (&quot;Red Week&quot;). In the latter, the monarchy was almost overthrown.

In Mexico, the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early 1910s it conducted a series of military offensives, leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California. Under the leadership of anarcho-communist Ricardo Flores Magón, its slogan was (&#x27;Land and Liberty&#x27;). Magón&#x27;s journal (&#x27;Regeneration&#x27;) had a significant circulation, and he helped urban workers turn to anarcho-syndicalism. He also influenced the Zapata movement.

Ferdinando Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two insurrectionary anarchists and Italian migrants to the United States, were convicted of involvement in an armed robbery and the murders of two people in 1920. After a controversial trial and a series of appeals they were sentenced to death and executed on 23 August 1927. Following their deaths, critical opinion overwhelmingly held that the two men were convicted largely because of their anarchist political beliefs and were unjustly executed. After the Sacco and Vanzetti case, and despite worldwide protests and mainstream media headlines, the anarchist movement faded in the United States.

===Rise of fascism===

Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation &quot;Arditi del Popolo&quot; (The People&#x27;s Daring Ones or AdP), which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions. They achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922. AdP saw growth after the Socialist Party signed the pacification pact with the fascists. AdP consisted of militant proletarians, anarchists, communists and even socialists. It numbered twenty-thousand members in 144 sections. The veteran Italian anarchist, Luigi Fabbri, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as &quot;the preventive counter-revolution&quot;. Italian anarchists Gino Lucetti and Anteo Zamboni narrowly failed an assassination attempt against Benito Mussolini. Italian anarchists formed various partisan groups during World War II.

In France, where the far-right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a united front policy. One tendency was for the creation of a pack with political parties while others objected. In Spain, the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour or CNT) initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance. Abstention by their supporters led to a right-wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land. However, even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists.

In Germany, the Nazis crushed anarchism upon seizing power. Apart from Spain, nowhere else could the anarchist movement provide a solid resistance to various fascist regimes throughout Europe.

===Spanish Revolution===

The Spanish Revolution of 1936 was the first and only time that libertarian socialism became an imminent reality. It stood on the ground of a strong anarchist movement in Spain that dated back to the 19th century. Anarchist groups enjoyed broad social support particularly in Barcelona, Aragon, Andalusia, Levante. Anarchism in Spain leaned towards syndicalism and this yielded to the formation of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) in 1910. The CNT declared that its aim was a libertarian communist society and was organising strikes all over Spain. The Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI) was founded later to keep CNT on a &quot;pure&quot; anarchist path amidst dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera&#x27;s crackdown on labour movements. The Second Spanish Republic was pronounced in 1931 and brought to power a Republican–Socialist alliance. But instead of the high hopes of the CNT (mostly among &quot;gradualists&quot;) and others, the repression of the labour movement continued. FAI gained more control of CNT.

In 1936, the Popular Front (an electoral alliance dominated by left-wingers) won the elections and months later the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of urban and large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land. Barcelona was the site of the most dramatic change, as workers broke bourgeois habits and even gender hierarchies. Newly formed anarcho-feminist group Mujeres Libres (Free Women) had an active role in the social transformation in Barcelona. This rebellious culture impressed visitors such as George Orwell. Enterprises and farms were collectivised, and working conditions improved drastically. In rural Aragon money was abolished and the economy was collectivised. Villages were run by popular assemblies in a direct democratic fashion, without coercing individuals to join. Anarchist militia columns, fighting without martial discipline or military rank, despite shortages in military materials, made significant gains at the war front.

Anarchists of CNT-FAI faced a major dilemma after the coup had failed in July 1936: either continue their fight against the state or join the anti-fascist left-wing parties and form a government. They opted for the latter and by November 1936, four members of CNT-FAI became ministers in the government of the former trade unionist Francisco Largo Caballero. This was justified by CNT-FAI as a historical necessity since war was being waged, but other prominent anarchists disagreed, both on principle and as a tactical move. In November 1936 the prominent anarcho-feminist Federica Montseny was installed as minister of Health—the first woman in Spanish history to become a cabinet minister.

During the course of the events of the Spanish Revolution, anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists of the Spanish Communist Party, who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republicans received from the Soviet Union. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists. The fight among anarchists and communists escalated during the May Days, as the Soviet Union sought to control the Republicans.

The 1939 defeat of Republican Spain marked the end of anarchism&#x27;s classical period. In light of continual anarchist defeats, one can argue about the naivety of 19th-century anarchist thinking—the establishment of state and capitalism was too strong to be destroyed. According to political philosophy professor Ruth Kinna and lecturer Alex Prichard, it is uncertain whether these defeats were the result of a functional error within the anarchist theories, as New Left intellectuals suggested some decades later, or the social context that prevented the anarchists from fulfilling their ambitions. What is certain, though, is that their critique of state and capitalism ultimately proved right, as the world was marching towards totalitarianism and fascism.

===Anarchism in the colonial world===

As empires and capitalism were expanding at the turn of the century, so was anarchism which soon flourished in Latin America, East Asia, South Africa and Australia.
Anarchism found fertile ground in Asia and was the most vibrant ideology among other socialist currents during the first decades of 20th century. The works of European philosophers, especially Kropotkin&#x27;s, were popular among revolutionary youth. Intellectuals tried to link anarchism to earlier philosophical currents in Asia, like Taoism, Buddhism and neo-Confucianism. But the factor that contributed most to the rise of anarchism was industrialisation and the new capitalistic era that eastern Asia was entering. Young Chinese anarchists in the early days of the 20th century voiced the cause of revolutionary anarcho-communism along with humanism, belief in science and universalism in the journal &quot;Hsin Shih-chi&quot;. Anarchism was growing in influence until the mid-1920s when Bolshevik successes seemed to indicate the way to communism. Likewise in Japan, anarcho-communists such as Kōtoku Shūsui, Osugi Sakae and Hatta Shuzo were inspired by the works of westerners philosophers and opposed capitalism and the state. Shuzo created the school of &quot;pure anarchism&quot;. Because of the industrial growth, anarcho-syndicalism also arose for a brief period, before communists prevailed among workers. Tokyo had been a hotspot for anarchist and revolutionary ideas which were circulating among Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese students who travelled to Japan to study. Socialists by then were enthusiastically supporting the idea of &quot;social revolution&quot; and anarchists were in full support of it. In Korea, anarchism took a different course. Korea was under Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945 and in the early phases of that period, anarchists took part in national resistance, forming an anarchist zone in Shinmin Manchuria from 1928 to 1931. Kim Chwa-chin was a prominent figure of the movement. In India, anarchism did not thrive, partly because of its reputation for being violent. The fragile anarchist movement developed in India was more non-statist, rather than anti-statist.

Anarchism travelled to the Eastern Mediterranean along with other radical secular ideas in the cosmopolitan Ottoman Empire. Under the spell of Errico Malatesta, a group of Egyptian anarchists imported anarchism to Alexandria. It was in a transitional stage during that era, as industrialisation and urbanisation were transforming Egypt. Anarchist activity was spread along with other radical secular ideas within the Islamic Empire. In Africa, anarchism appeared from within the continent. A large part of African society, mainly rural, was founded on African communalism which was mostly egalitarian. It had some anarchist elements, without class divisions, formal hierarchies and access to the means of production by all members of the localities. African Communalism was far from being an ideal anarchist society. Gender privileges were apparent, feudalism and slavery did exist in a few areas but not on a mass scale.

Anarchism travelled to Latin America through European immigrants. The most impressive presence was in Buenos Aires, but Havana, Lima, Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, São Paulo as well saw the growth of anarchist pockets. Anarchists had a much larger impact on trade unions than their authoritarian left counterparts. In Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, a strong anarcho-syndicalist current was formed—partly because of the rapid industrialisation of these countries. In 1905, anarchists took control of the Argentine Regional Workers&#x27; Federation (FORA) in Argentina, overshadowing social democrats. Likewise, in Uruguay, FORU was created by anarchists in 1905. These syndicates organised a series of general strikes in the following years. After this the success of the Bolsheviks, anarchism gradually declined in these three countries which had been the strongholds of anarchism in Latin America. It is worth noting that the notion of imported anarchism in Latin America has been challenged, as slave rebellions appeared in Latin America before the arrival of European anarchists.

Anarchists became involved in the anti-colonial national-independence struggles of the early 20th century. Anarchism inspired anti-authoritarian and egalitarian ideals among national independence movements, challenging the nationalistic tendencies of many national liberation movements.

==Individualist anarchism==
===In the United States===

American anarchism has its roots in religious groups that fled Europe to escape religious persecution during the 17th century. It sprouted towards individual anarchism as distrust of government was widespread in North America during the next centuries. In sharp contrast with their European counterparts, according to the scholar Marshall, American anarchism was leaning towards individualism and was mainly pro-capitalist, hence described as right-wing libertarianism; however Marshall later stated that capitalism and anarchism are incompatible and American anarchists like Tucker and Spooner were left libertarians. The scholar Martin stated the American anarchists were mutualist anarchists in support of the labor theory of value. American anarchist justified private property as the safeguard of personal autonomy. Henry David Thoreau was an important early influence on individualist anarchist thought in the United States in the mid 19th century. He was skeptical towards government—in his work &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; he declared that &quot;That government is best which governs least&quot;. He has frequently been cited as an anarcho-individualist, even though he was never rebellious. Josiah Warren was, at the late 19th century, a prominent advocate of a variant of mutualism called equitable commerce, a fair trade system where the price of a product is based on labor effort instead of the cost of manufacturing. Benjamin Tucker, also influenced by Proudhon, was the editor of the prominent anarchist journal &quot;Liberty&quot; and a proponent of individualism.

In the shade of individualism, there was also anarcho-Christianism as well as some socialist pockets, especially in Chicago. It was after Chicago&#x27;s bloody protests in 1886 when the anarchist movement became known nationwide. But anarchism quickly declined when it was associated with terrorist violence.

An important concern for American individualist anarchism was free love. Free love particularly stressed women&#x27;s rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women, for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures. Openly bisexual radical Edna St. Vincent Millay and lesbian anarchist Margaret Anderson were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman, among others.

A heated debate among American individualist anarchists of that era was the &quot;natural rights&quot; versus egoistic approaches. Proponents of naturals rights claimed that without them brutality would prevail, while egoists were proposing that there is no such right, it only restricted the individual. Benjamin Tucker, who tried to determine a scientific base for moral right or wrong, ultimately sided with the latter.

The Modern Schools, also called Ferrer Schools, were schools established in the United States in the early 20th century. They were modelled after the Escuela Moderna of Francisco Ferrer, the Catalan educator and anarchist. They were an important part of the anarchist, free schooling, socialist, and labour movements in the United States intending to educate the working classes from a secular, class-conscious perspective. The Modern Schools imparted daytime academic classes for children and nighttime continuing-education lectures for adults. The first and most notable of the Modern Schools was opened in New York City in 1911. Commonly called the Ferrer Center, it was founded by notable anarchists—including Leonard Abbott, Alexander Berkman, Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman. The school used Montessori methods and equipment, and emphasised academic freedom rather than fixed subjects, such as spelling and arithmetic.

===In Europe and the arts===
European individualist anarchism proceeded from the roots laid by William Godwin and Max Stirner. Many artists, poets and writers interested in freedom were exploring different aspects of anarchism. Anarcho-individualists were more interested in personal development, challenging the social norms and demanding sexual freedom rather than engaging in social struggles.

In France, an artistic and individualist trend in anarchism was shaping a new cultural movement at the turn of the century, with less of a social component and more of a personal rebellion against norms. Impressionists and neo-Impressionist painters were attracted by anarchism, most notably French Camille Pissarro. Modernist writers having anarchist tendencies, such as Henrik Ibsen and James Joyce, led to the impression that &quot;modernism itself can be understood as the aesthetic realisation of anarchist politics&quot;. Dadaism arose from individualists aiming to use art to achieve &quot;total freedom&quot;. It influenced other currents such as surrealism, and proponents played a significant role in the Berlin rising of 1918. One of the main individualist anarchist journals in France, &quot;L&#x27;Anarchie&quot;, was established in 1905. A notable individualist was Stirnerist Émile Armand who was a defender of polyamory and homosexuality.

== Post-war ==
Following the end of the Spanish Civil War and World War II, the anarchist movement was a &quot;ghost&quot; of its former self, as proclaimed by anarchist historian George Woodcock. In his work &quot;&quot; published 1962, he wrote that after 1936 it was &quot;a ghost that inspires neither fear among governments nor hope among peoples nor even interest among newspapermen&quot;. Capitalism continued to grow throughout the post-war period despite predictions from Marxist scholars that it would soon collapse under its own contradictions, yet anarchism gained a surprising surge in popular interest during the 1960s. Reasons for this were believed to be the gradual demystification of the Soviet Union and tensions at the climax of the Cold War. The New Left, which arose in the 1950s, was a libertarian socialist movement that was closer to anarchism. Prominent thinkers such as Herbert Marcuse and Wright Mills were critical of United States and Soviet Marxism.

In France, a wave of protests and demonstrations confronted the right-wing government of Charles de Gaulle in May 1968. Even though the anarchists had a minimal role, the events of May had a significant impact on anarchism. There were huge demonstrations with crowds in some places reaching one million participants. Strikes were called in many major cities and towns involving seven million workers—all grassroots, bottom-up and spontaneously organised. Various committees were formed at universities, lyceums, and in neighbourhoods, mostly having anti-authoritarian tendencies. Slogans that resonated with libertarian ideas were prominent such as: &quot;I take my desires for reality, because I believe in the reality of my desires.&quot; Even though the spirit of the events leaned mostly towards libertarian communism, some authors draw a connection to anarchism. The wave of protests eased when a 10% pay raise was granted and national elections were proclaimed. The paving stones of Paris were only covering some reformist victories. Nevertheless, the 1968 events inspired a new confidence in anarchism as workers&#x27; management, self-determination, grassroots democracy, antiauthoritarianism, and spontaneity became relevant once more. After decades of pessimism 1968 marked the revival of anarchism, either as a distinct ideology or as a part of other social movements.

Originally founded in 1957, The Situationist International rose to prominence during events of 1968 with the principal argument that life had turned into a &quot;spectacle&quot; because of the corrosive effect of capitalism. They later dissolved in 1972. The late 1960s saw the flourish of anarcha-feminism. It attacked the state, capitalism and patriarchy and was organized in a decentralised manner. As the ecological crisis was becoming a greater threat to the planet, Murray Bookchin developed the next generation of anarchist thought. In his social ecology theory, he claims that certain social practises, and priorities threaten life on Earth. He goes further to identify the cause of such practises as &quot;social oppressions&quot;. &quot;Libertarian municipalism&quot; was his major advancement of anarchist thought—a proposal for the involvement of people in political struggles in decentralized federated villages or towns.

===Contemporary anarchism===


The anthropology of anarchism has changed in the contemporary era as the traditional lines or ideas of the 19th century have been abandoned. Most anarchists are now younger activists informed with feminist and ecological concerns. They are involved in counterculture, Black Power, creating temporary autonomous zones, and events such as Carnival Against Capital. These movements are not &quot;anarchist&quot;, but rather &quot;anarchistic&quot;.

Mexico saw another uprising at the turn of the 21st century. Zapatistas took control of a large area in Chiapas. They were organised in an autonomous, self-governing model that has many parallels to anarchism, inspiring many young anarchists in the West. Another stateless region that has been associated with anarchism is the Kurdish area of Rojava in northern Syria. The conflict there emerged during the Syrian Civil War and Rojava&#x27;s decentralized model is founded upon Bookchin&#x27;s ideas of libertarian municipalism and social ecology within a secular framework and ethnic diversity. Chiapas and Rojava share the same goal, to create a libertarian community despite being surrounded by state apparatus.

Anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements. Maia Ramnath described those social movements that employ the anarchist framework (leaderless, direct democracy) but do not call themselves anarchists as anarchists with a lowercase &quot;a&quot; while describing more traditional forms of anarchism with a capital &quot;A&quot;. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against meetings such as the World Trade Organization in Seattle in 1999, Group of Eight in 2001 and the World Economic Forum, as part of anti-globalisation movement. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as black blocs. Other organisational tactics pioneered during this period include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet. Occupy Wall Street movement had roots in anarchist philosophy.

According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley, &quot;contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism [...] One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological, or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment, and disenfranchisement that is so palpable locally and globally&quot;.

<text>Carthage Jail is a historic building in Carthage, Illinois, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). It was built in 1839 and is best known as the location of the 1844 killing of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and his brother Hyrum, by a mob of approximately 150 men. It was added to the NRHP in 1973 and is operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) as a historic site with an adjacent visitors&#x27; center.

==History==

The jail was built in 1839, constructed of red limestone quarried nearby. The building is rectangular and measures by . It is a gable-front building has two stories and an attic. Like other county jails built during the same period, Carthage Jail was built to incarcerate petty thieves and debtors and as a temporary holding place for violent criminals. The first floor contained a debtor&#x27;s room in the northwest corner, and a dungeon, or &quot;criminal cell&quot;, was located on the north side of the second floor. The living area for the jailer&#x27;s family included a kitchen and dining room on the first floor and a bedroom on the second floor. A small &quot;summer kitchen&quot; was added later.

In June 1844, Smith came to the jail to face charges relating to his ordering the destruction of facilities producing the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;, a newspaper whose only edition had been critical of the Smiths&#x27; religious teachings. He was joined by his brother, Hyrum, and fellow Latter Day Saints John Taylor and Willard Richards. On June 27, a mob stormed the upper room of the prison and killed the Smiths. Taylor was badly wounded and Richards was scathed, but not seriously injured. Hyrum Smith was 44 years old in February 1844 and Joseph Smith was 38 in December 1843.

===Restoration===
The building continued to be used as a jail until 1866 and was afterwards used as a private residence. It was acquired by the LDS Church in 1903 and a partial restoration was completed in 1935. It was added to the NRHP on March 30, 1973. The church fully restored the jail in 1989, returning the building to its 1844 appearance. The restoration also included an expansion of the visitors&#x27; center and renovations to the entire block. Ezra Taft Benson, president of the LDS church at the time, spoke in front of about 3,000 at a shrine dedication of the jail.

Tours of Carthage Jail are available including the original door with a bullet hole, where the jailer and his family would have slept, and where the Smith brothers were held.

In 2020, Carthage Jail and other historic sites in the Nauvoo area were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="1063291" wikidata="Q6303349" url="?curid=1063291" title="Judith Collins">
<text>Judith Anne Collins (born 24 February 1959) is a New Zealand politician who has served as the attorney-general and minister of defence since 27 November 2023. She served as the leader of the Opposition and leader of the New Zealand National Party from 14 July 2020 to 25 November 2021. Collins has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Papakura since 2008 and was MP for Clevedon from 2002 to 2008.

Born in Hamilton, Collins studied at Matamata College, the University of Canterbury and University of Auckland. Before entering politics, she worked as a commercial lawyer and was President of the Auckland District Law Society and Vice-President of the New Zealand Law Society. She was a solicitor for four different firms from 1981 and 1990, before running her own practice for a decade. She was a director of Housing New Zealand from 1999 to 2001 and worked as special counsel for Minter Ellison Rudd Watts from 2000 to 2002 before she entered Parliament at the .

Collins was appointed to the Cabinet by Prime Minister John Key when the National Party entered government at the . She was ranked fifth in the Cabinet and the highest-ranked woman. Collins served as minister of police and minister of corrections from 2008 to 2011 and 2015 to 2016. After the , she was appointed minister of justice and minister for the ACC. In August 2014 Collins was compelled to resign following email leaks alleging she had undermined the head of the Serious Fraud Office whilst she was police minister. While she was not cleared of wrongdoing related to that incident, she returned to the Cabinet in 2015. Collins served under Prime Minister Bill English as minister of revenue and minister of energy and resources from 2016 to 2017.

After the National Party left government in the , Collins served in several shadow portfolios. She was elected to succeed Todd Muller as National Party leader by the parliamentary caucus on 14 July 2020, becoming leader of the Opposition. She was the second female leader of the National Party, after Jenny Shipley. She led the party to its second-worst defeat in the party&#x27;s history at the 2020 election, losing 23 seats. Collins was removed as leader of the National Party by its caucus on 25 November 2021, the day after she suddenly demoted Simon Bridges, a political rival, for allegations of making a since-resolved inappropriate comment in 2017. Following National&#x27;s victory in the 2023 election, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon appointed Collins to Cabinet; she holds seven ministerial posts.

As the current longest continuously serving female MP, Collins is considered the Mother of the House.

==Early life and career==
Collins was born in Hamilton. Her parents were dairy farmers Percy and Jessie Collins of Walton in the Waikato and she was the youngest of six children. She was educated at Walton School, Matamata Intermediate and Matamata College. In 1977 and 1978, she studied at the University of Canterbury. In 1979, she switched to the University of Auckland, and obtained first a Bachelor of Laws degree and then Master of Laws (Hons) and later Master of Taxation Studies (MTaxS) degrees. In 2020, she graduated with a Graduate Diploma in Occupational Health and Safety from Massey University. She met her husband, Chinese-Samoan David Wong-Tung, at university. He was then a police officer and had migrated from Samoa as a child. They have one son. Collins has described herself as a liberal Anglican.

Collins was a Labour Party supporter from childhood, but by 2002 had been a member of the National Party for three years. She has been a member of Zonta International and of Rotary International.

==Professional career==
After leaving university, she worked as a lawyer, specialising in employment, property, commercial, and tax law. She worked as a solicitor for four different firms between 1981 and 1990 and then became principal of her own firm, Judith Collins &amp; Associates (1990–2000). In the last two years before the election to Parliament, she worked as special counsel for Minter Ellison Rudd Watts (2000–2002).

She was active in legal associations, and was President of the Auckland District Law Society (1998–1999) and Vice-President of the New Zealand Law Society (1999–2000). She served as chairperson of the Casino Control Authority (1999–2002) and was a director of Housing New Zealand Limited (1999–2001).

==Early parliamentary career (2002–2008)==




Collins was elected to Parliament in the as the National MP for Clevedon. Although technically a new electorate, Clevedon was largely based on the old electorate, held by National&#x27;s Warren Kyd.

In Parliament, Collins became National&#x27;s Associate Spokesperson on Health and Spokesperson on Internal Affairs. In 2003, these responsibilities were changed for those of Associate Spokesperson on Justice and Spokesperson on Tourism. She was generally regarded as having performed well and when Katherine Rich refused to give full support to the controversial Orewa Speech by then-party leader Don Brash, Rich was demoted in February 2005 and Collins became National&#x27;s spokesperson on Social Welfare instead. Collins then served as spokesperson on Family and spokesperson on Pacific Island Affairs.

In 2003, while in opposition, Collins campaigned for an inquiry to find out whether New Zealand troops were exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War and if so any effect this subsequently had. Despite previous inquiries stating otherwise, the committee established that troops were exposed to defoliant chemicals during their service in Vietnam, and therefore operated in a toxic environment. This resulted in an apology in 2004 from the Labour-led Government to Veterans and the establishment of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to support veterans. In 2004 Collins was awarded the Ex-Vietnam Services Association Pin for campaigning for the inquiry.

Collins&#x27;s Clevedon electorate disappeared under boundary changes for the . She originally announced her intention to seek the National Party nomination for Howick, which comprises the urban part of her former Clevedon electorate. However, following objections made to the Electoral Commission over draft changes to the boundaries that saw a major redrawing of the adjacent constituency Pakuranga, the draft Howick was redrawn and renamed Botany. Collins then sought and won the nomination for Papakura (which comprises the other half of her former Clevedon electorate) and allowed her colleague National Party MP Pansy Wong to seek nomination for Botany. Collins won Papakura with a majority of more than 10,000 votes.

==Fifth National Government (2008–2017)==
The National Party formed a government after the 2008 election, and Collins entered Cabinet with the portfolios of Police, Corrections and Veterans&#x27; Affairs. Early in 2009, she was created Minister Responsible for the Serious Fraud Office.

After the she was appointed Minister of Justice, Minister of Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and Minister of Ethnic Affairs and, with a Cabinet ranking of five, was the highest ranked woman.

=== Minister of Corrections ===

In 2009, Collins questioned the leadership of, and later refused to express confidence in, Department of Corrections chief executive Barry Matthews, after a spate of bad publicity. However, after an enquiry by the State Services Commissioner Iain Rennie, Matthews kept his job because Corrections had made efforts to improve and had warned the government of the day and the previous government that under-resourcing was putting public safety at risk.

Collins increased the availability of work programmes in prison, and increased funding to widen the availability of alcohol and drug treatment programmes. Corrections built three new Drug Treatment Units and introducing condensed treatment programmes for prisoners serving shorter sentences. Collins oversaw completion of a new prison in Mount Eden, Auckland, and instigated the private management contract for the new prison to British company Serco, on the recommendation of the Department of Corrections. This was the first prison since 2005 to be managed by a private sector contractor.

In June 2010, Collins announced that from 1 July 2011 tobacco smoking and possessing lighters in prison would be banned, to reduce the health risk that smoking and fire presented to prison guards and prisoners. This ban was subsequently successfully challenged in court on two occasions, resulting in a law change to maintain it.

=== Minister of Police ===
Following a police trial of tasers in 2006–07, Collins supported their introduction by then Police Commissioner Howard Broad. In the 2009 budget she announced NZ$10 million worth of funding to complete a nationwide taser roll-out to all police districts, and since then has advocated that the police be given further discretion about when they can equip themselves with tasers. She has also supported increased access to firearms for frontline officers, by equipping all front-line police vehicles with lock boxes for firearms, but does not support the full-time general arming of police officers.

During her early years in parliament, Collins developed a reputation for tough talking and in 2009 was nicknamed &quot;Crusher Collins&quot; when she proposed legislation to &#x27;crush&#x27; the cars of persistent boy racers. Collins described herself as the minister &quot;who brought back deterrence&quot;.

=== Minister of Justice ===
In 2012, Collins moderated the cuts-back to legal aid begun by her predecessor, Simon Power. She reduced the charges for family and civil cases, delayed the period before interest is charged on outstanding legal aid debt and dropped a proposal to make it harder to get legal aid for less serious crimes such as theft, assault or careless driving. She did however retain fixed fees for criminal work and the rotation of the legal aid to lawyers in all but the most serious cases, which attracted criticism from some lawyers. 
After a two-year investigation the Law Commission produced a report for government with 153 recommendations to reform New Zealand&#x27;s alcohol laws. While some legislative changes were passed in December 2012, the Opposition and health sector lobbyists said the evidence-based advice from the Commission was disregarded by Collins and her predecessor Simon Power with the result that the final legislation &quot;was a pale imitation of the landmark Law Commission report it was based on.&quot; Examples include Collins originally announcing a ban in May 2012 of ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages with 6 per cent alcohol or more from off-licenses. However, in the face of criticism from the liquor industry, she back-tracked on this ban, and three months later announced that the industry would develop its own voluntary code &quot;to limit the harm to young people caused by RTDs&quot;. The Commission also recommended a 50 per cent tax increase on alcohol (which was dismissed immediately by the Government) and an increase in the purchase age, which was also dismissed after a conscience vote in September 2012. Collins herself voted to raise the purchase age. Overall Collins said &quot;the reforms struck a sensible balance by reducing the serious harm caused by alcohol without penalising people who drank responsibly.&quot; The Labour Party and Professor Doug Sellman said that the changes were weak and would do little to reduce the harm caused by binge drinking. Sellman said: &quot;It&#x27;s called the Alcohol Reform Bill but it has no reforms in it&quot;.

In December 2012, Collins revealed she had concerns about the robustness of a report authored by retired Canadian Supreme Court judge Ian Binnie, which recommended that David Bain should be paid compensation for the 13 years he spent in prison before being acquitted at retrial in 2009. The report had been presented to Collins on 31 August 2012, but the dispute only became public after Binnie threatened to release the report on his own. Collins had provided a copy of the report to the police and the Solicitor-General and ordered a peer review by former New Zealand High Court judge Robert Fisher, sending a &quot;34-point list of issues attacking the case&quot; along with her letter of instruction. She did not provide a copy of Binnie&#x27;s report to Bain&#x27;s legal team. This fact, combined with the circumstances around the peer review by Fisher, led to accusations from Bain&#x27;s team and from Justice Binnie that Collins was not following an &quot;even handed process&quot;. Collins subsequently released the reports publicly. A month later, Bain filed a claim in the High Court seeking a review of Collins&#x27;s actions. The claim alleged Collins breached natural justice and the Bill of Rights Act in her treatment of him and that she &quot;acted in bad faith, abused her power, and acted in a biased, unreasonable and predetermined manner&quot;.

=== Minister for ACC ===
In August 2011, a significant privacy breach occurred at the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) following the accidental release of 6700 claimants&#x27; details to ACC claimant, Bronwyn Pullar. Following the breach, Collins wanted a change in the culture at ACC to make &quot;privacy and information security&quot; the most important focus. As part of these changes the board chair, John Judge, did not have his tenure on the board renewed, and the chief executive Ralph Stewart resigned the next day. In May 2012, Collins sued Labour MPs Trevor Mallard and Andrew Little for defamation over comments they made on Radio New Zealand linking her to the leak of an e-mail from Michelle Boag about Pullar&#x27;s case. The case was settled after a High Court hearing in November 2012.

=== Controversies ===

In March 2014, Collins was accused of a conflict of interest after an overseas trip where she &#x27;dropped in&#x27; and endorsed the milk produced by Oravida – a New Zealand company which exports to China – of which her husband is a director. After being admonished by the Prime Minister, Collins apologised and stated that she and a Chinese executive were &#x27;very close personal friends&#x27;. Over the following weeks the Labour Party continued asking who the Chinese official was. Collins did not provide his name, which House speaker David Carter described as &quot;very unsatisfactory&quot;. Prime Minister John Key stated publicly that Judith Collins was on her final warning over this incident.

In August 2014 the book &quot;Dirty Politics&quot;, written by Nicky Hager, revealed that Collins was friends with right-wing blogger Cameron Slater and had passed on private information to him about Simon Pleasants, a public servant at Internal Affairs. Collins believed Pleasants had leaked information about Deputy Prime Minister Bill English misusing his housing allowance. Slater published Mr Pleasant&#x27;s name and details on his blog as well as the abuse and death threats that were subsequently directed at Mr Pleasants. A 3News-Reid Research poll taken at the time revealed that 63% of voters believed Prime Minister John Key should have stood Collins down over this incident. Key said Collins had been &#x27;unwise&#x27; and placed on her second final warning.

New Zealand First leader Winston Peters claimed he was approached to do a post–2014 election deal with National with Collins as the leader. Peters went on to say he would swear an affidavit that he had been approached. Collins denied this claim. On 29 August 2014 Key backed Collins up by stating &quot;I accept Judith 100 per cent at her word.&quot;

On 30 August 2014 Collins resigned her Cabinet positions following the leak of another e-mail written by Slater in 2011, which suggested she had also attempted to undermine another public servant, Adam Feeley. Feeley was Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and Collins was the Minister responsible for the SFO at the time. Collins says she resigned because she believed the attacks on her had become a distraction for the National Party leading up to the election. She called for an inquiry so she could clear her name.

After the 2014 election, John Key left Collins off the &quot;Roll of the Honourables&quot; due to the ongoing inquiry into her role with Adam Feeley. This made her ineligible to use the title &#x27;The Honourable&#x27;. Collins expressed surprise about having found out about the decision through the media, and Key admitted that his decision should have been explained to Collins.
On 25 November 2014 the Chisholm report was released, clearing Collins of the allegations into her dealings with former SFO director Adam Feeley, so on 4 December 2014 Collins was granted the right to retain the title of &#x27;The Honourable&#x27; for life.

Collins was cleared of involvement in the Adam Feeley smear. On 7 December 2015, Key announced Collins would return to Cabinet, to hold her former portfolios of Corrections and Police again. She was sworn in again on 14 December 2015.

===2016 leadership campaign and aftermath===
John Key announced his resignation as leader of the National Party on 5 December 2016. The following day, Collins announced her intention to stand as his replacement, which would have elevated her to the prime ministership. The other candidates were Bill English and Jonathan Coleman. On 8 December, both Collins and Coleman withdrew as candidates, allowing English to be elected unopposed.

On 20 December 2016, she was officially sworn in as a minister with new portfolios in the new Bill English cabinet. She dropped in cabinet rank but was made Minister of Revenue, Minister of Energy and Resources, and Minister for Ethnic Communities. The corrections and police portfolios were given to Louise Upston and Paula Bennett, respectively.

==Opposition (2017–2023)==

===2018 leadership campaign===

Bill English announced his resignation as leader of the National Party on 13 February 2018. The following day, Collins became the first person to announce their intention to stand as his replacement; she was later joined by Amy Adams and Simon Bridges. She cited the need for &quot;strong and decisive leadership&quot;. Collins was endorsed by former National leader Don Brash, and political commentators Duncan Garner, Mike Hosking, Cameron Slater, and Chris Trotter. Hosking later retracted his endorsement when Steven Joyce announced his candidacy. Bridges went on to win the leadership role.

In late May 2018, Collins, in her capacity as Opposition Transport spokesperson, raised the matter that Transport Minister Phil Twyford had made an unauthorised phone call while his flight had taken off; a violation of national civil aviation laws. In response, Twyford offered to resign as Transport Minister. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern stripped Twyford of his civil aviation portfolio but retained him as Transport Minister.

=== 2020 leadership campaign ===
On 14 July 2020, Collins was elected as leader of the National Party following a leadership election held following the abrupt resignation of Todd Muller earlier that day. Gerry Brownlee was also elected as Deputy Leader of the National Party.

She became the second female leader of the National Party.

Collins faced criticism during her campaign for being out of touch with common New Zealanders after she severely underestimated the price of a block of cheese after being asked how much it cost during an interview.

===Leader of the Opposition (2020–2021)===
Collins led the party to the 2020 election as significant underdogs, with opinion polls suggesting historically large swings to the Labour Party, reflecting its well-received response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Collins, although more popular than her predecessors Todd Muller and Simon Bridges, still significantly lagged behind Jacinda Ardern as preferred prime minister by 30 to 40 points.

Ultimately, the 2020 election saw a massive Labour landslide, with the party winning 65 seats, enough to form a majority government in its own right. Meanwhile, Collins led the National Party to a crushing defeat, suffering a 18.9% swing against them, and a 23 seat drop; finishing with 33 seats. The result was the second-worst defeat the National Party had ever suffered, edged out by the 2002 disaster, where the party won an even grimmer number of 27 seats. The election even saw the party&#x27;s Deputy Leader Gerry Brownlee lose his own seat of Ilam, which was considered National heartland.

With the result beyond doubt, a near-tearful Collins announced on election night that she had telephoned Ardern and conceded defeat, but vowed that the party would bounce back stronger in the next election. Despite these setbacks, Collins retained her electorate seat in Papakura by a final margin of 5,583 votes.

In early February 2021, Collins confirmed that the National Party would be standing candidates in the Māori electorates, reversing the party&#x27;s policy of not contesting those seats. As Leader of the Opposition, Collins has opposed alleged policies of &quot;racist separatism&quot; towards the Māori community including race-based affirmative action policies and the creation of separate Māori governance authorities including the Māori Health Authority and the introduction of Māori wards and constituencies in local government. Collins&#x27;s stance on these issues drew accusations of racism from the Māori Party, which Collins rejected.

In mid-June 2021, Collins supported the Labour Government&#x27;s apology for the Dawn Raids of the 1970s and early 1980s, which disproportionately targeted the Pasifika communities. She stated that &quot;this historic act of discrimination against our Pasifika communities caused anguish that reverberated across decades and it is right that we acknowledge this.&quot;

In early September 2021, Collins drew controversy when she described immunologist and science communicator Siouxsie Wiles as a &quot;big, fat hypocrite&quot; during a virtual conversation with a Pasifika group aligned with the party. Collins&#x27;s remarks came after right-wing blogger Cameron Slater posted a video of Wiles socialising with a friend at an Auckland beach during an Alert Level 4 lockdown in the Auckland Region in response to the August 2021 Delta variant community outbreak. Slater had alleged that Wiles and her friend flouted lockdown restrictions in his blog BFD. In response, Wiles clarified that her friend was part of the same bubble as her and that the pair had cycled 5 km from her house to the beach. In response to Collins&#x27;s criticism of Wiles, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield defended Wiles from allegations that she breached lockdown restrictions.

Collins was removed as leader of the National Party on 25 November 2021 following a caucus vote of no confidence, which took place the day after she sacked rival Simon Bridges over a crude comment he made to fellow MP Jacqui Dean five years prior. The incident had been quickly resolved, with no hard feelings afterwards from either party. Therefore, both National MPs and the media saw Collins&#x27;s action as being to neutralise Bridges as an opponent by smearing him. Shane Reti was acting leader until the subsequent leadership election on 30 November, when Christopher Luxon was elected party leader.

===Shadow Cabinet of Christopher Luxon (2021–2023)===
On 19 January 2023, Collins was promoted from 19th to 10th place on Luxon&#x27;s shadow cabinet. She also assumed the new roles of &quot;Foreign Direct Investment&quot; and &quot;Digitising Government&quot; spokesperson.

==Sixth National Government (2023–present)==

In the 2023 election held on 14 October, Collins retained her Papakura electorate seat by a margin of 13,519 votes over Labour candidate Anahila Kanongata&#x27;a-Suisuiki.

On 27 November 2023, Collins assumed seven ministerial portfolios in the National-led coalition government, namely: Attorney-General, Minister of Defence, Minister for Digitising Government, Minister Responsible for the GCSB, Minister Responsible for the NZSIS, Minister of Science, Innovation and Technology, and Minister for Space. Collins is the first woman to serve as Defence minister. She holds the largest number of portfolios among ministers in the government. On 15 December, Collins was appointed King&#x27;s Counsel by Christopher Luxon in recognition of &quot;her career achievements and the responsibility she holds on behalf of the Crown&quot;. 

During a cabinet reshuffle that occurred on 19 January 2025, Collins assumed the public services portfolio from Nicola Willis. In addition, Shane Reti assumed Collins&#x27; science, innovation and technology ministerial portfolio.

===Minister for the GCSB===
On 8 December 2023 Collins, in her capacity as GCSB Minister, joined New Zealand&#x27;s Five Eyes allies in condemning the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) for conducting a series of cyber attacks on British politicians, civil servants, journalists, think tanks, academics, and other public figures.

===Attorney-General===
On 20 December Collins, in her capacity as Attorney-General, confirmed six judicial appointments: Supreme Court Judge Forrest Miller, Court of Appeal justices Susan Thomas, Rebecca Ellis and Francis Cooke, High Court Chief Judge Sally Fitzgerald, and High Court justice Karen Grau.

Collins delivered a keynote address on constitutional and rule of law challenges in the current global environment to Western Sydney University on 29 October 2024. After her presentation she was named an adjunct professor in the university&#x27;s school of law.

===Minister of Defence===
On 12 January 2024, Collins expressed New Zealand&#x27;s support for Anglo-American airstrikes against Iranian-backed Houthi forces in Yemen, which had been disrupting international shipping in response to the 2023 Israel-Hamas war. She called the airstikes a &quot;good example of the international community uniting to address a serious threat to international security&quot; and reaffirmed the New Zealand Defence Force&#x27;s commitment to supporting international maritime security.

On 22 February 2024, Collins confirmed that the New Zealand Defence Force&#x27;s European deployment to train Ukrainian soldiers would be extended to June 2025. She also announced that the NZ military deployment&#x27;s training mandate will be expanded from July 2024 to include specialised training in combat casualty care, combat engineering, leadership, and maritime explosive ordnance disposal training.

In November 2024, Collins invoked Section 9 of the Defence Act 1990 to cancel holiday leave for Defence Force personnel in order to cover striking civilian security guards at military installations during the 2024–2025 Christmas and New Year holiday period. Collins&#x27; decision was criticised by the lobby group Mission Homefront, who said that the &quot;use of the temporary power undermined the crucial interdependency with civilian staff.&quot;

===Ministry of Science, Innovation and Technology===
On 13 August 2024, Collins as the Minister of Science, Innovation and Technology announced that the Government would introduce legislation to end the ban on genetic modification and genetic engineering outside laboratories. This new law will be based on Australia&#x27;s Gene Technology Act 2000. Collins also confirmed that the Government would establish a national regulator to manage the risks associated with genetic modification and engineering.

On 4 December 2024, Collins announced that the Government would end Marsden grants for humanities and social science research in order to focus on &quot;core sciences&quot; like physics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering and biomedical sciences that would boost economic growth, scientific and technological development.

== Political views ==

Collins has been described as a conservative. She is seen to represent the right wing of her party, and in her previous roles as Minister of Police and Minister of Corrections, she has promoted law and order policies. Collins has praised former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

In 2003, Collins voted against the Death with Dignity Bill, which aimed to legalise euthanasia in New Zealand, but in 2020 voted in support of the End of Life Choice Bill to legalise assisted dying.

Collins has a mixed record on LGBT issues. In 2004, she voted against the Civil Union Act 2004 and the Relationships (Statutory References) Act 2004, stating not because of any sort of homophobic views but because it created a parallel form of marriage. In Parliament she stated, &quot;This Bill is a sop to gay couples, in which they are being told that they can have second best. That is not good enough.&quot; She later voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill 2005, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. In 2013, however, Collins voted for the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry in New Zealand.

In 2005, Collins voted for the Sale of Liquor (Youth Alcohol Harm Reduction) Act, a bill aimed at raising the drinking age to 20 years. In 2012, in her role as Minister of Justice, she introduced the Alcohol Reform Bill, a bill that introduced several restrictions on sale of alcohol including stricter opening hours for bars or liquor stores (but ultimately did not raise the drinking age).

In 2009, Collins voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act to allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes. In 2020, Collins voted no to legalising cannabis in the 2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum.

In 2011, Collins pledged to support abortion-law changes which would make it illegal to perform an abortion on someone under the age of 16 without parental notification. Collins had proposed adding this to the Care of Children Act in 2004. In 2020, she supported the Abortion Legislation Act 2020, which decriminalised abortion.

In June 2021, Collins defended the advocacy group Speak Up For Women, a group opposed to gender self-identification, which had been prevented from hosting a meeting at a Christchurch City Library venue on the grounds of alleged transphobia.

In August 2021, Collins called for a referendum on the growing use of &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, the Māori-language name for New Zealand, in official documents and statements. This was in spite of the fact that Collins had used the name several times during her time as a minister in the previous Fifth National Government.

== Public image ==
Collins has been nicknamed &quot;Crusher Collins&quot;, which stems from her policy as Minister of Police to crush the cars of speeding drivers. She has also been subject to ridicule after using her Samoan husband&#x27;s ethnicity to &quot;shield herself&quot; from accusations of racism and a lack of diversity in her shadow cabinet. She has won a mixture of light-hearted admiration and disapproval for her &quot;tough image&quot; and tongue-in-cheek hubris, to the extent that she was indirectly referred to by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern as a &quot;Karen&quot; in 2021.

<text>Spathodea is a genus in the plant family Bignoniaceae. The single species it contains, Spathodea campanulata, is commonly known as the African tulip tree. The tree grows between tall and is native to tropical dry forests of Africa. It has been nominated as among 100 of the &quot;World&#x27;s Worst&quot; invaders.

This tree is planted extensively as an ornamental tree throughout the tropics and is much appreciated for its very showy reddish-orange or crimson (rarely yellow), campanulate flowers. The generic name comes from the Ancient Greek words σπαθη (&quot;spathe&quot;) and οιδα (&quot;oida&quot;), referring to the spathe-like calyx. It was identified by Europeans in 1787 on the Gold Coast of Africa.

==Description==

The flower bud is ampule-shaped and contains water. People sometimes play with these buds because of their ability to squirt water. The sap sometimes stains yellow on fingers and clothes. The open flowers are cup-shaped and hold rain and dew, making them attractive to many species of birds.

==Flower anatomy==
The African tulip tree flower produces large flamboyant reddish-orange flowers that have approximately five petals and are 8–15 cm long. The flowers are bisexual and zygomorphic. These are displayed in a terminal corymb-like raceme inflorescence. Its pedicel is approximately 6 cm long. This flower also has a yellow margin and throat. The pistil can be found at center of four stamens that is inserted on the corolla tube. This flower has a slender ovary that is superior and is two celled. The seeds of this tree are flat, thin, and broadly winged. 

==Species associations==
In Neotropical gardens and parks, their nectar is popular with many hummingbirds, such as the black-throated mango (&quot;Anthracothorax nigricollis&quot;), the black jacobin (&quot;Florisuga fusca&quot;), or the gilded hummingbird (&quot;Hylocharis chrysura&quot;). The wood of the tree is soft and is used for nesting by many hole-building birds such as barbets. Unfortunately the flowers have a natural defence killing bees, and it is thought various other species who harvest its pollen.

==Geographic distribution==
*Native to: Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia
*Exotic in: Australia, Bangladesh,Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Fiji, Hawaii, India, Jamaica, Mauritius, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka, Zanzibar, Philippines

It has become an invasive species in many tropical areas, such as Hawaii, Queensland (Australia), Fiji, Papua New Guinea, South Africa and the wet and intermediate zones of Sri Lanka.

&quot;Spathodea campanulata&quot; is a declared class 3 pest species in Queensland, Australia, under the &quot;Land Protection (Pest and Stock Route Management) Act 2002&quot;. It is known to be toxic to Australian native stingless bees, such as &quot;Lipotriches (Austronomia) flavoviridis&quot;.

==Pests and diseases==
In Uganda, two lepidopteran species, two termite species, and one bark beetle attack &quot;S. campanulata&quot;. In Puerto Rico nine insect species in the orders Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Thysanoptera have been reported as feeding on various parts of &quot;S. campanulata&quot;. The species is quite susceptible to butt and heart rot; wood of the tree rots quickly when in contact with the ground.

==Use==
Its wood is too weak for construction use but ideal enough for boxes and toothpicks. Fijian children sometimes use its flower buds as water pistols.

<text>Michael Lynn Ballam (born August 21, 1951) is an American opera singer, educator, and arts administrator.

He is the founding general director of Utah Festival Opera and a professor of music at Utah State University. He has served on the faculty of the Music Academy of the West, where he also studied, and as a guest lecturer at Stanford, Yale, Catholic University, and Manhattan School of Music.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Michael Ballam was born in Logan, Utah to Grant Lamb Ballam, a pharmacist, and his wife, Marianne Fullmer. He was raised in River Heights, a town adjacent to Logan. Ballam credits his great-grandfather, an immigrant from Denmark, as an inspiration for his pursuit of music and Latter-day Saint Christianity.

In 1956, he made his stage debut at Logan&#x27;s Capitol Theatre, now the Ellen Eccles Theatre. He attended Sky View High School in the neighboring town of Smithfield, where he was cast as Wang Ta in &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; and Billy Bigelow in &quot;Carousel&quot;, among others. After graduation, he attended the nearby Utah State University to pursue a degree in music education. He continued to sing in musical theater productions and expanded his repertoire to include opera, oratorio, and concert recital works.

At the age of 24, Ballam became the youngest recipient of a Doctor of Music with Distinction in the history of Indiana University. At Indiana, his ten roles performed included Andres in &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, the title role in &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, and Rodolfo in &quot;La bohème&quot;. In 1976, he was the first student to perform the title role in &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

===Professional work===
Ballam has performed with many national houses, including the San Francisco, Metropolitan, Houston Grand, Washington National, San Diego, and Michigan Operas. In 1978, he premiered the role of Beelzebub in Penderecki&#x27;s opera &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; at Chicago Lyric Opera. Ballam also premiered the role of Coyote in Mollicone&#x27;s 1998 opera &quot;Coyote Tales&quot;.

Ballam&#x27;s recital venues have included Kennedy Center, Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall, Notre-Dame, and the Salt Lake Tabernacle. Ballam has also performed as a soloist at the White House and the Vatican.

As an actor, Ballam has starred in &quot;Clubhouse Detectives&quot;, as the Apostle Paul in the BYU Studios biopic &quot;The Chosen Vessel&quot;, as well as Lucifer in the 1990 temple film used in the endowment ordinance.

Ballam is also an oboist and pianist.

===Illness===
In 1987, Ballam was performing &quot;La Traviata&quot; in Caracas when he suddenly lost his ability to sing. He returned to his home in New York City and visited his ENT. After testing, Ballam was informed that the cause of his illness was a mystery and that he should prepare for a poor prognosis. Physicians in Denver and Houston provided similar perspectives. He returned to his family in Logan, Utah. It was later discovered that Ballam had suffered from a sinus infection that had progressed into his cranial cavity as a bone infection and subsequently into his lungs. Doctors operated on his skull and prescribed a regimen of antibiotics. Ballam recovered quickly.

===Utah Festival Opera===
When Ballam returned to Logan in 1987, he joined the music faculty of Utah State University. He was soon notified that the Capitol Theatre, where Ballam first performed as a child, was to be torn down to make room for a parking lot. Ballam ran a successful, multi-million dollar campaign to save, restore, and expand the building, which had fallen into disrepair. Upon completion, the theater had its name changed to the Ellen Eccles Theatre, honoring the community service and character of Ellen Stoddard Eccles (1867-1957) and her family. In subsequent years, Ballam has also led the restoration and renovation projects of several other historic cultural landmarks in Logan, Utah, including the Utah Theatre and the Dansante Building.

In 1992, Ballam founded Utah Festival Opera, which presented its first season in the summer of 1993. Since its inception, Ballam has stood as general director of the company, as well as one of its recurring performers. Most Utah Festival Opera productions are performed on the stages of the Ellen Eccles and Utah Theatres. The repertory company has continued to grow, now staging six shows and several concerts each summer.

For the 30th anniversary season in 2022, Ballam reprised his role as Cervantes/Don Quixote in Man of La Mancha.

==Additional contributions==

Ballam has authored over forty publications and recordings in international distribution, and produced/performed a weekly radio program on Utah Public Radio. He is frequently asked to hold lectures worldwide on the creative arts, more specifically music, and their interaction with the functions of the mind, their use in enhancing education, and as sources of therapy and motivation.

Ballam currently serves on the Board of Directors of several professional arts organizations.

==Achievements==
* 1996: &quot;100 Top Achievers in the State of Utah&quot;, awarded by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
* 2003: &quot;Artist Extraordinaire&quot;, appointed by Governor Olene Walker
* 2007: &quot;Excellence in Community Teaching Award&quot;, given by the Daughters of the American Revolution
* 2010: &quot;Gardner Award&quot;, given by the Utah Academy of Science, Arts &amp; Letters, for “Significant Contributions in the Humanities to the State of Utah”
* Honorary Life Membership to the Utah Congress of Parents and Teachers

==Faith==
Ballam is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has written and lectured on the relationship between music and the doctrines of the Church. The Church created the position of &quot;musical missionary-at-large&quot; specifically for him.

In 1999, Ballam sang &quot;Panis Angelicus&quot; by Cesar Franck at the funeral of his friend and supporter, influential LDS author and historian Leonard J. Arrington. Ballam also sang for the 90th birthday celebration of LDS president Gordon B. Hinckley.

==Family==
Ballam&#x27;s grandfather, Oral Ballam, was a veteran in World War II. When he returned to the United States, he was educated at Utah State University, and received an Ed. D. from UCLA. After graduation, he was granted a Ford Foundation Fellowship, which allowed him further study at Stanford and Columbia Universities. He was a public school administrator in Cache Valley before becoming a professor at USU in 1963. In 1969, he was appointed Dean of the College of Education, retiring in 1992.

Ballam is also descended from J. W. Summerhays, the patriarch of a musical dynasty in the Utah region and a singer himself. Summerhays emigrated from Europe as an LDS convert in 1866.

Michael&#x27;s daughter, Vanessa, is a performer, stage director, and former Miss Utah. She is also a theatre professor at Idaho State University and education director for Utah Festival Opera. Michael&#x27;s son, Benjamin, whose mobility is affected by spina bifida, has appeared in some Utah Festival productions. Michael Ballam has four other children with his wife, Laurie. He currently resides in Logan, Utah.

<text>The Mazda Savanna is a rotary-powered automobile sold by the Japanese manufacturer Mazda between 1971 and 1978. Between 1978 and 1991, spanning two generations, Mazda sold the Savanna replacement as the Mazda Savanna RX-7. Mazda exclusively used the Savanna nameplate in Japan. It was exported as the Mazda RX-3 in its first generation from 1971 to 1978, and as the Mazda RX-7 in its subsequent generations.

For the original 1971 version of Savanna, Mazda fitted its 10A rotary engine to the Mazda Grand Familia to create a separately marketed product sold in coupé, sedan, and station wagon guises. The engine was upgraded to the larger 12A rotary in the GT model introduced in September 1972, and eventually this became the standard engine across the entire range. Coupé sales accounted for over half of total sales, influencing the design and marketing of the second generation of Savanna. The subsequent two generations, released in 1978 and 1985 respectively, fitted the rotary engines to a unique coupe body that sold internationally as the Mazda RX-7.

The rotary engine had financial advantages to Japanese consumers in that the engine displacement remained below 1.5 litres, a significant determination when paying the Japanese annual road tax which kept the obligation affordable to most buyers, while having more power than the traditional inline engines.</text><links>

<doc id="1063321" wikidata="Q3612974" url="?curid=1063321" title="Al Indelicato">
<text>Alphonse &quot;Al&quot; Indelicato (February 25, 1931 – May 5, 1981), also known as Sonny Red, was an American mobster and caporegime in the Bonanno crime family who was murdered with Dominick Trinchera and Philip Giaccone for planning to overthrow Bonanno boss Philip Rastelli.

==Early life==
Alphonse Indelicato was born in New York City. Indelicato&#x27;s family came from Sciacca, Italy, landed and became a naturalized citizen when living in Utica, New York. Indelicato was the father-in-law of Bonanno associate Salvatore Valenti and ex-son-in-law of Bonanno capo, bookmaker Charles Ruvolo. Indelicato was particularly fond of a pair of custom-made red leather cowboy boots, which may have been the source of his nickname &quot;Sonny Red&quot;.

Indelicato is a nephew to Salvatore Falcone, a heroin trafficker. Indelicato was married first to Charles Ruvolo&#x27;s unidentified daughter, with whom he fathered a son, Anthony &quot;Bruno&quot; Indelicato. Indelicato later married Margaret Elizabeth McFhadden, but the two later became estranged.

Indelicato was indicted in 1972 for the inquiry into the murder of Joe Gallo, but was released on $15,000 bail.

===Planning a coup===
Joseph Massino began jockeying for power with Dominick &quot;Sonny Black&quot; Napolitano, another Philip Rastelli loyalist capo, after the 1979 murder of Carmine Galante. Both men were themselves threatened by another faction seeking to depose the absentee boss led by capos Indelicato, Dominick &quot;Big Trin&quot; Trincera and Philip Giaccone. The Commission initially tried to maintain neutrality, but in 1981, Massino got word from his informants that the three capos were stocking up on automatic weapons and planning to kill the Rastelli loyalists within the Bonanno family to take complete control. Massino turned to Colombo crime family boss Carmine Persico and Gambino crime family boss Paul Castellano for advice; they told him to act immediately.

==The three capos murder==
On May 5, 1981, Massino loyalists shot and killed Indelicato, Trinchera, and Giaccone, in a Brooklyn night club. On the pretext of working out a peace agreement, Massino had invited them to meet with him at the 20/20 Night Club in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. However, Massino&#x27;s real plan was to assassinate the capos. The ambush was set in the club store room, with Salvatore Vitale and three other gunmen wearing ski masks hiding in a closet. One of the gunmen was mobster Vito Rizzuto, who came from Montreal with another Canadian mobster to help Massino. Massino told the men to avoid shooting wildly so that bullets wouldn&#x27;t spray around the room. Massino also brought drop cloths and ropes for disposing of the bodies afterwards.

When the capos arrived at the 20/20, Massino and Bonanno mobster Gerlando Sciascia and Frank Lino escorted them to the store room. As the men entered the room, Sciascia brushed his hand through his hair, giving the prearranged signal. Vitale and gunmen rushed out of the closet, with Rizzuto yelling &quot;it&#x27;s a hold up&quot;. Massino immediately punched Giaccone, knocking him to the floor, and also stopping Indelicato from escaping. Giaccone got up and tried to run out of the room, but was blocked up against a wall with Trinchera. The gunmen killed Giaccone with a volley of submachine gun fire. They then turned their weapons on Indelicato and Trinchera. The three capos were unarmed, as was the rule when attending a peace meeting.

After the killings, the Bonanno gunmen transported the three bodies to a lot in Lindenwood, Queens, in an area known as The Hole.

The lot was a Gambino mob graveyard; Gambino capo John Gotti arranged for his men to bury the bodies there as a favor to Massino. A few weeks later, on May 28, authorities discovered Indelicato&#x27;s body and removed it from the lot.

In October 2004, after some children reported finding a body in the Lindenwood lot, FBI agents excavated the property and discovered the bodies of Trinchera and Giaccone. Among the personal items they unearthed was a Piaget watch that had belonged to Giaccone&#x27;s wife. In December 2004, the bodies were positively identified as Giaccone and Trinchera.

On June 23, 2005, Massino, then a government witness to avoid the death penalty, pleaded guilty to several murders including those of Giaccone, Trinchera, and Indelicato. He received two life sentences in prison. On May 4, 2007, after being extradited to the United States, Rizzuto pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn court to reduced charges in the murder of three capos and was sentenced to ten years in state prison.

After his father&#x27;s murder, Indelicato&#x27;s son, Anthony, went into hiding in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Massino wanted to kill him also, but he had missed the meeting. His father brought Lino instead, who was the sole survivor of the massacre. Lino, who had escaped, was quickly won over to Massino&#x27;s side. Napolitano assigned associate Donnie Brasco, who he hoped to make a made man, to kill Indelicato. &quot;Brasco&quot;, however, was in fact an undercover FBI agent named Joseph Pistone; shortly after the hit was ordered, Pistone&#x27;s assignment was ended and Napolitano was informed of their infiltration.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1997 film &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, Al Indelicato was portrayed by Robert Miano.
* In the 2017 Canadian TV series &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, in a flashback, Sonny Red is portrayed by Joe Di Mambro.

<text>The Mennonite Church (MC), also known as the Old Mennonite Church, was formerly the oldest and largest body of Mennonites in North America. It was a loosely-affiliated collection of Mennonite conferences based in the United States and Canada, mainly of Swiss and South German origin. The group dated to the settlement of Germantown in 1683 and included 112,311 members in North America in 1997. Many of the conferences that were considered part of the Old Mennonite Church participated in the Mennonite General Conference from 1898-1971 and the Mennonite General Assembly from 1971-2002. The Mennonite General Assembly voted to merge with the General Conference Mennonite Church at a joint session in Wichita, Kansas, in 1995. In 2002, the two groups merged and then divided along national lines into Mennonite Church USA and Mennonite Church Canada.

== Origins ==
The conferences that made up the Mennonite Church originated from two groups, Mennonites and Amish.

== Polity and ministry ==
The polity of the Mennonite Church varied because of influences of various originating groups and settlement patterns. It also changed over time. The basic pattern was a conference-based polity with conferences having authority over local congregations. Conferences had authority on doctrine and practice and could discipline ministers and congregations. Congregations selected ministers and owned church buildings. The parts of the Mennonite Church with Amish origin tended to give more authority over doctrine and practice to leaders of local congregations.

The traditional pattern of ministry was a plural unsalaried ministry with a bishop, preacher, and deacon. In many conferences, bishops were assigned to several congregations, though Amish-origin congregations often had a single bishop per congregation. In the 1950s and 1960s, this pattern began to change. Congregations began calling pastors to replace preachers. In the more progressive parts of the Mennonite church, these pastors were seminary-trained and salaried. The office of bishop was renamed as a superintendent or overseer in many conferences. The office of deacon declined in usage. By the 1990s, most of the conferences participating in Mennonite General Assembly had a pastor for each local congregation and district superintendents or overseers rather than traditional plural ministry, with the significant exception of the strong bishop system in Lancaster Mennonite Conference.

<text>Manning is a town in northern Alberta, Canada. It is known as the &quot;Land of the Mighty Moose&quot;. It is located on Highway 35 on the Notikewin River, approximately north of Peace River.

Manning is a service centre for the local agriculture, forestry and gas industries. It also serves the nearby rural area within the County of Northern Lights including Deadwood, Hotchkiss, North Star and Notikewin.

== History ==
The community of Manning sprung up as a result of growing agricultural development following the First World War as the Dominion government sought to provide land to returning soldiers to participate in the workforce. The Soldier Settlement Board provided incentives to veterans to begin farming unsettled tracts on the Battle River Prairie north of the Town of Peace River and west of the Peace River. By 1921 the district would have a population of 500 and the community of Battle River Prairie (later Notikewin) would grow as a regional hub. In the late-1920s the communities of Hotchkiss and North Star would spring up in the region.

The northern communities suffered from limited medical resources, which were facilitated by mobile clinics staffed with Registered Nurses. In 1928 nurse Mary Little was assigned to the region, and in 1929 she was replaced by Dr. Mary Percy who was recruited from England. Dr. Percy would serve the area until 1937 when the new hospital was completed.

The population continued to grow in the 1930s, with farmers moving from the drought-stricken regions of southern Alberta. Pressure began to grow for the construction of a hospital in the region, and the Women&#x27;s Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada began collecting funds for the construction, with the Government of Alberta agreeing to match funds collected for the new hospital.

In fall 1936 construction began on the eight bed Battle River Hospital, which was completed later on September 4, 1937, and would later become the hub of the new Aurora settlement. The land was donated by John Robertson, and resident doctor Arthur Doige was secured to operate the hospital. Construction was supervised by W.D.C. Buchanon, and the structure would include a operating room, waiting room, kitchen, and accommodation on the second floor for three nurses.

The official settlement was founded by American Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Larry Craig, who purchased land on the south bank of the Notikewin River and built the Aurora hotel, secured a liquor license and constructed other buildings after the Second World War. The settlement originally intended to be founded under the name &quot;Aurora&quot;, but was rejected by the postal authorities because of possibility of confusion with Aurora, Ontario. In 1947 the Mackenzie Highway was pushed through the region and the community became a government construction and maintenance center, and quickly eclipsed North Star and Notikewin in population. At a public meeting in 1947, the community was renamed in honour of Ernest Manning who had become Premier of Alberta four years earlier in 1943, and would serve in the role until 1968.

Manning would be incorporated as a Village on December 31, 1951, and later a Town on January 1, 1957. During the 1950s the Manning Municipal Hospital would be constructed at a cost of CA$127,000, and later in September 1962, the Great Slave Lake Railway would be completed by Canadian National Railways linking the Town to the rail network.

== Climate ==
Manning has a subarctic climate, very close to being a humid continental climate, with both May and September averaging only fractionally under . There are vast differences between the warm summers and very cold winters, although areas much further south more eastward in Canada have equally cold winters and cooler summers. The climate data is from minor settlement Notikewin very close to the town.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Manning had a population of 1,126 living in 471 of its 540 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,183. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Manning recorded a population of 1,183 living in 484 of its 544 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 1,164. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

== Attractions ==
The Battle River Pioneer Museum is home to many pieces of antique farming equipment, vehicles and other extraordinary items, like the albino moose and Cleave Whitaker&#x27;s childhood crib.

The Manning Farmers’ Market has been a fixture in Manning for over 30 years.

Recreation venues include the Manning R.C.M.P. Centennial Pool, a paved walking trail, a curling rink, a skating/hockey arena, two outdoor ice rinks, a ski hill, a concrete skatepark, an outdoor splash park, and the Condy Meadows Golf Course and Recreation Area.

The Battle River Hospital located on Centre Street and 1st Avenue North is a -storey hospital built between 1936 and 1937 to serve as the hospital for the region. The Battle River Hospital was designated an Alberta Provincial Historic Resource under the &quot;Historical Resources Act&quot; on March 11, 2009.

== Infrastructure ==
Manning has a hospital. It also has a newly constructed RCMP detachment, fire station and skatepark, along with an indoor/outdoor pool. The town is serviced by Manning Airport, located 3.3 km northwest of the community.

== Government ==
The Town of Manning is a municipal corporation with a council–manager government structure consisting of a seven-member Council elected every four years. The council itself consists of an at-large mayor and six councillors. The legal authority to govern as a &quot;creature of the province&quot; is derived from various regulations and legislation of the Alberta Legislature, of which the &quot;Municipal Government Act&quot; provides many of the powers and responsibilities for the town. The current Mayor Robert McLeod was elected over opponent Sunni-Jean Walker in the 2021 Alberta municipal elections.

Provincially, the Town of Manning is represented by the Member of the Legislative Assembly for Peace River, which is held by Dan Williams since the 2019 Alberta general election. Federally, the Town of Manning is represented by the Member of Parliament for Grande Prairie-Mackenzie, which is held by Chris Warkentin.

== Education ==
Manning contains two public schools which are part of the Peace River School Division No. 10, Manning Elementary which provides kindergarten to grade six, and Paul Rowe High School which provides grades seven through twelve. Manning has one separate school under the Holy Family Catholic Regional Division No. 37, Rosary Separate School which provides kindergarten to grade nine.

== Media ==
Manning is served weekly by The Banner Post

<doc id="1063353" wikidata="Q412474" url="?curid=1063353" title="Aspartate transaminase">
<text>Aspartate transaminase (AST) or aspartate aminotransferase, also known as AspAT/ASAT/AAT or (serum) glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT, SGOT), is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminase enzyme () that was first described by Arthur Karmen and colleagues in 1954. AST catalyzes the reversible transfer of an α-amino group between aspartate and glutamate and, as such, is an important enzyme in amino acid metabolism. AST is found in the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, red blood cells and gall bladder. Serum AST level, serum ALT (alanine transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health. The tests are part of blood panels.

The half-life of total AST in the circulation approximates 17 hours and, on average, 87 hours for &quot;mitochondrial&quot; AST. Aminotransferase is cleared by sinusoidal cells in the liver.

== Function ==
Aspartate transaminase catalyzes the interconversion of aspartate and α-ketoglutarate to oxaloacetate and glutamate.

L-Aspartate (Asp) + α-ketoglutarate ↔ oxaloacetate + L-glutamate (Glu)

As a prototypical transaminase, AST relies on PLP (Vitamin B6) as a cofactor to transfer the amino group from aspartate or glutamate to the corresponding ketoacid. In the process, the cofactor shuttles between PLP and the pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP) form. The amino group transfer catalyzed by this enzyme is crucial in both amino acid degradation and biosynthesis. In amino acid degradation, following the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate, glutamate subsequently undergoes oxidative deamination to form ammonium ions, which are excreted as urea. In the reverse reaction, aspartate may be synthesized from oxaloacetate, which is a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle.

==Isoenzymes==
Two isoenzymes are present in a wide variety of eukaryotes. In humans:
* GOT1/cAST, the cytosolic isoenzyme derives mainly from red blood cells and heart.
* GOT2/mAST, the mitochondrial isoenzyme is present predominantly in liver.

These isoenzymes are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral AST via gene duplication, and they share a sequence homology of approximately 45%.

AST has also been found in a number of microorganisms, including &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;H. mediterranei&quot;, and &quot;T. thermophilus&quot;. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, the enzyme is encoded by the &quot;aspC&quot;gene and has also been shown to exhibit the activity of an aromatic-amino-acid transaminase ().

== Structure ==

X-ray crystallography studies have been performed to determine the structure of aspartate transaminase from various sources, including chicken mitochondria, pig heart cytosol, and &quot;E. coli&quot;. Overall, the three-dimensional polypeptide structure for all species is quite similar. AST is dimeric, consisting of two identical subunits, each with approximately 400 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of approximately 45 kD. Each subunit is composed of a large and a small domain, as well as a third domain consisting of the N-terminal residues 3-14; these few residues form a strand, which links and stabilizes the two subunits of the dimer. The large domain, which includes residues 48-325, binds the PLP cofactor via an aldimine linkage to the ε-amino group of Lys258. Other residues in this domain – Asp 222 and Tyr 225 – also interact with PLP via hydrogen bonding. The small domain consists of residues 15-47 and 326-410 and represents a flexible region that shifts the enzyme from an &quot;open&quot; to a &quot;closed&quot; conformation upon substrate binding.

The two independent active sites are positioned near the interface between the two domains. Within each active site, a couple arginine residues are responsible for the enzyme&#x27;s specificity for dicarboxylic acid substrates: Arg386 interacts with the substrate&#x27;s proximal (α-)carboxylate group, while Arg292 complexes with the distal (side-chain) carboxylate.

In terms of secondary structure, AST contains both α and β elements. Each domain has a central sheet of β-strands with α-helices packed on either side.

==Mechanism==
Aspartate transaminase, as with all transaminases, operates via dual substrate recognition; that is, it is able to recognize and selectively bind two amino acids (Asp and Glu) with different side-chains. In either case, the transaminase reaction consists of two similar half-reactions that constitute what is referred to as a ping-pong mechanism. In the first half-reaction, amino acid 1 (e.g., L-Asp) reacts with the enzyme-PLP complex to generate ketoacid 1 (oxaloacetate) and the modified enzyme-PMP. In the second half-reaction, ketoacid 2 (α-ketoglutarate) reacts with enzyme-PMP to produce amino acid 2 (L-Glu), regenerating the original enzyme-PLP in the process. Formation of a racemic product (D-Glu) is very rare.

The specific steps for the half-reaction of Enzyme-PLP + aspartate ⇌ Enzyme-PMP + oxaloacetate are as follows (see figure); the other half-reaction (not shown) proceeds in the reverse manner, with α-ketoglutarate as the substrate.

# Internal aldimine formation: First, the ε-amino group of Lys258 forms a Schiff base linkage with the aldehyde carbon to generate an internal aldimine.
# Transaldimination: The internal aldimine then becomes an external aldimine when the ε-amino group of Lys258 is displaced by the amino group of aspartate. This transaldimination reaction occurs via a nucleophilic attack by the deprotonated amino group of Asp and proceeds through a tetrahedral intermediate. As this point, the carboxylate groups of Asp are stabilized by the guanidinium groups of the enzyme&#x27;s Arg386 and Arg 292 residues.
# Quinonoid formation: The hydrogen attached to the a-carbon of Asp is then abstracted (Lys258 is thought to be the proton acceptor) to form a quinonoid intermediate.
# Ketimine formation: The quinonoid is reprotonated, but now at the aldehyde carbon, to form the ketimine intermediate.
# Ketimine hydrolysis: Finally, the ketimine is hydrolyzed to form PMP and oxaloacetate.

This mechanism is thought to have multiple partially rate-determining steps. However, it has been shown that the substrate binding step (transaldimination) drives the catalytic reaction forward.

==Clinical significance==
AST is similar to alanine transaminase (ALT) in that both enzymes are associated with liver parenchymal cells. The difference is that ALT is found predominantly in the liver, with clinically negligible quantities found in the kidneys, heart, and skeletal muscle, while AST is found in the liver, heart (cardiac muscle), skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells. As a result, ALT is a more specific indicator of liver inflammation than AST, as AST may be elevated also in diseases affecting other organs, such as myocardial infarction, acute pancreatitis, acute hemolytic anemia, severe burns, acute renal disease, musculoskeletal diseases, and trauma.

AST was defined as a biochemical marker for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in 1954. However, the use of AST for such a diagnosis is now redundant and has been superseded by the cardiac troponins.

Laboratory tests should always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that performed the test. Example reference ranges are shown below:

<text>Gerald Brom (born March 9, 1965), known professionally as Brom, is an American gothic fantasy artist and illustrator, known for his work in role-playing games, novels, and comics.

==Early life==
Brom was born March 9, 1965, in Albany, Georgia. As the son of a U.S. Army pilot he spent much of his early years on the move, living in other countries such as Japan and Germany (he graduated from Frankfurt American High School), and in U.S. states including Alabama and Hawaii. Brought up as a military dependent he was known by his last name only, and now signs his name as simply Brom: &quot;I get that asked more than just about any other question. It&#x27;s my real name, my last name. I got called Brom all the time as a kid, and it just stuck.&quot;

Brom has been drawing and painting since childhood, although he had never taken any formal art classes. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call myself self-taught, because I&#x27;ve always looked at the work of other artists and emulated what I liked about it. So you can say they taught me.&quot; Brom cites the work of Frank Frazetta, N.C. Wyeth, and Norman Rockwell as influences on his style: &quot;Okay... Rockwell isn&#x27;t the kind of inspiration most people expect from me, but he just painted things so well. To me it&#x27;s not so much the genre but the way it&#x27;s done, and you have to admire his technique.&quot;

==Career==
At the age of 20, Brom started working full-time as a commercial illustrator. By age twenty-one, he had two national art representatives, and was doing work for such clients as Coca-Cola, IBM, CNN, and Columbia Pictures. TSR, Inc. hired Brom on full-time in 1989 at the age of 24. Brom contributed to all of TSR&#x27;s game and book lines, particularly the Dark Sun setting: &quot;I pretty much designed the look and feel of the Dark Sun campaign. I was doing paintings before they were even writing about the setting. I&#x27;d do a painting or a sketch, and the designers wrote those characters and ideas into the story. I was very involved in the development process. I&#x27;ve been fortunate to be involved in the development end of a lot of projects I&#x27;ve worked on, from role-playing games to computer games.&quot; According to Shannon Appelcline, Brom &quot;contributed the unique illustrations for &quot;Dark Sun&quot; that helped to set it apart from the other TSR games with their more typical fantasy drawings&quot;. His paintings have been published in collectible card games such as Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Last Unicorn Games&#x27; &quot;&quot;. Brom&#x27;s paintings, along with Frank Frazetta&#x27;s, were used in the development of the visual look of the game series Warlords.

In 1993, after four years at TSR, Brom returned to the freelance market, still specializing in the darker side of the roleplaying game, card game, and comic book genres. Shane Lacy Hensley came up with the idea for the game &quot;Deadlands&quot; after he saw Brom&#x27;s cover to &quot;&quot; from White Wolf, and got Brom to do the cover for the initial release. His artwork also appeared on book covers from authors such as Michael Moorcock, Anne McCaffrey, and Terry Brooks. Brom contributed conceptual work to computer games such as &quot;Heretic II&quot;, and several top creature houses for films such as Stan Winston Studios; he also co-created, art directed, and illustrated the &quot;Dark Age&quot; collectible card game. He has since worked as a movie concept artist, and created illustrations for comics (by DC, Chaos, Dark Horse) and computer games (for id Software, Blizzard, Sega and Activision). Brom has also been active with a line of Brom fetish toys from &quot;Fewture&quot; and a series of bronzes from the Franklin Mint and paintings for novels (by Michael Moorcock, Terry Brooks, R.A. Salvatore, Edgar Rice Burroughs).

Brom returned to TSR in 1998, doing paintings for the &quot;Alternity&quot; game, the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; role-playing game and its Forgotten Realms and Planescape lines, and covers for &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazines. His work is included in the book &quot;Masters of Dragonlance Art&quot;. He has also returned to painting for book covers for TSR&#x27;s successor Wizards of the Coast, including the covers for the &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; series and reprints of &quot;The Avatar Series&quot;.

==Reception==
In 2014, Scott Taylor of &quot;Black Gate&quot;, named Brom as #4 in a list of The Top 10 RPG Artists of the Past 40 Years, saying &quot;Brom is arguably one of the greatest pure fantasy talents of his generation, and he still creates works just as sublime as he did in his 1990s glory.&quot;

In 2019, Brom entered the Origins Award Hall of Fame.

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath reviewed the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dark Sun&quot; and noted, &quot;The art of fantasy illustrators Gerald Brom and Tom Baxa tie together this aesthetic-first high concept ... the art of Brom and Baxa distills and transmits the themes of the setting without players having to read a single word of the boxed set. ... Brom&#x27;s paintings, many of which were composed before the details of the setting were decided, evoke an alien landscape that seems dry, harsh, and strangely sexy.&quot;

<text>Dail Michael John Jones (born 7 July 1944) is a New Zealand politician. He has been a member of the New Zealand First party, and was formerly in the National Party.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Karachi, British India, and attended St Joseph&#x27;s College Quetta and Garrison School, Quetta and Karachi Grammar School. He and his mother arrived in New Zealand in 1960, and he completed his education at St Paul&#x27;s College, Auckland, and the University of Auckland, from where he earned an LLB. He began practice as a lawyer.

==Member of Parliament==



In the , Jones was elected MP for Waitemata, standing as a National Party candidate. As such Dail Jones was the first person from Pakistan to become a New Zealand Member of Parliament. In the following election, the Waitemata seat was abolished, and Jones was elected as the MP for Helensville. He retained this electorate until the 1984 election, when Helensville electorate was abolished. Jones contested the new electorate, but was defeated by the Labour Party candidate, Jack Elder.

Jones was Junior Whip for National in 1979. From April 1982 to June 1984, Jones was Deputy Chairman of Committees.

Jones is known as one of the few New Zealand MPs to have been injured in a politically motivated attack; in 1980, while serving as a National Party MP, he was stabbed in the chest by an elderly constituent in his electorate office leaving him with a punctured lung. The assailant, Ambrose Tindall, was obsessed about a traffic ticket totaling $15.

===New Zealand First===
Considerably later, in the , Jones returned to Parliament as a list MP for the New Zealand First party, which had been established during Jones&#x27; time outside Parliament. He was ranked in tenth place on the New Zealand First list. He was New Zealand First spokesperson on foreign affairs, trade, customs, the courts, and the attorney-general&#x27;s role. He lost his seat in the , when he was again tenth on the party list (the lowest list MP elected in 2005 was Pita Paraone, who was ranked seventh). He was elected President of New Zealand First when Doug Woolerton resigned.

More recently, there have been frictions between Jones, Doug Woolerton and New Zealand First social liberal Brian Donnelly over the repeal of Section 59 of the Crimes Act 1961, legislation that allowed the use of parental corporal punishment against children (or spanking).

Dail Jones stated that &quot;custard is more dangerous than second-hand smoke. ...[and] milk ... is worse than second-hand smoke&quot;.

He also attracted criticism in February 2008 from Winston Peters for suggesting that New Zealand First had received large anonymous donations.

On 15 February 2008, Jones was returned to Parliament as a list MP once more, replacing Brian Donnelly, who had been appointed as New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to the Cook Islands. He was tenth on the New Zealand First party list in . Two people ahead of him on the party list, Susan Baragwanath and Jim Peters, declined the position, and he resigned as party President after becoming an MP.

In March 2008, he was critical of fellow NZ First MP Peter Brown&#x27;s views on Asian immigration.

In the , Jones was 14th on the New Zealand First party list, but the party lost all its parliamentary seats, winning no electorates and polling below the 5% threshold. He left politics after this election.

==Honours==
In the 2006 New Year Honours, Jones was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order, for public services.

<text>SEED is a block cipher developed by the Korea Information Security Agency (KISA). It is used broadly throughout South Korean industry, but seldom found elsewhere. It gained popularity in Korea because 40-bit encryption was not considered strong enough, so the Korea Information Security Agency developed its own standard. However, this decision has historically limited the competition of web browsers in Korea, as no major SSL libraries or web browsers supported the SEED algorithm, requiring users to use an ActiveX control in Internet Explorer for secure web sites.

On April 1, 2015 the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP) announced its plan to remove the ActiveX dependency from at least 90 percent of the country&#x27;s top 100 websites by 2017. Instead, HTML5-based technologies will be employed as they operate on many platforms, including mobile devices. Starting with the private sector, the ministry plans to expand this further to ultimately remove this dependency from public websites as well.

== Design ==

SEED is a 16-round Feistel network with 128-bit blocks and a 128-bit key. It uses two 8 × 8 S-boxes which, like those of SAFER, are derived from discrete exponentiation (in this case, x247 and x251 – plus some &quot;incompatible operations&quot;). It also has some resemblance to MISTY1 in the recursiveness of its structure: the 128-bit full cipher is a Feistel network with an F-function operating on 64-bit halves, while the F-function itself is a Feistel network composed of a G-function operating on 32-bit halves. However the recursion does not extend further because the G-function is not a Feistel network. In the G-function, the 32-bit word is considered as four 8-bit bytes, each of which is passed through one or the other of the S-boxes, then combined in a moderately complex set of boolean functions such that each output bit depends on 3 of the 4 input bytes.

SEED has a fairly complex key schedule, generating its thirty-two 32-bit subkeys through application of its G-function on a series of rotations of the raw key, combined with round constants derived (as in TEA) from the Golden ratio.

== Use and adoption ==

SEED has been adopted by several standard protocols: S/MIME (RFC 4010), TLS/SSL (RFC 4162), IPSec (RFC 4196), and ISO/IEC 18033-3:2010.

NSS software security library in Mozilla&#x27;s Gecko platform has implemented support for SEED, and Mozilla Firefox as of 3.5.4 supports SEED as a TLS cipher; however, Mozilla decided to drop the support of SEED by default in Firefox 27 and above because support for SEED has not had any practical positive effect in terms of helping South Korea migrate away from ActiveX-based e-commerce, and other browsers are not offering any SEED-based cipher suites. NSS still supports SEED-based cipher suites.

The Linux kernel has supported SEED since 2007.

Bloombase supports SEED in their full suite of data cryptography solutions.

<doc id="1063370" wikidata="Q3902730" url="?curid=1063370" title="Pieces of Me (Ashlee Simpson song)">
<text>&quot;Pieces of Me&quot; is the debut single of American pop/rock singer Ashlee Simpson and the first single from her debut album, &quot;Autobiography&quot; (2004). The song, which was jointly written and composed by Simpson, Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks and produced by Shanks, is a blend of pop and rock with lyrics about finding comfort and happiness in a relationship with a new boyfriend.

&quot;Pieces of Me&quot; was released as the first single from &quot;Autobiography&quot; on May 17, 2004. It peaked at number five on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Outside of the U.S., the song reached the top 10 in several countries, including Australia, Denmark, Norway, and the United Kingdom. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song at number 97 in their 2017 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Choruses of the 21st Century&quot; and number 26 in their 2020 list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Minivan Rock Songs&quot;. As of , it remains Simpson&#x27;s most successful song as well as her only song to reach the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 or the UK Singles Chart.

==Background and composition==
The recording of &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; features in &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Bummer&quot;, the fourth episode of the first season of Ashlee Simpson&#x27;s reality show, &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show,&quot; and was inspired by Simpson&#x27;s relationship with the musician Ryan Cabrera, a friend with whom she became romantically involved. As she said, &quot;It was just really nice to be with somebody who&#x27;s just real and who&#x27;s nice — just a good person. So I wrote that about him, and when I finished it, I was so excited and so was he.&quot; The two were reported to have broken up in August 2004. In another interview, Simpson said, &quot;It&#x27;s a feel good song, it&#x27;s easy to listen to and every time I perform it or listen to it or whatever, ... it just feels good.&quot;

Jeff Rothschild played drums on the track, John Shanks played guitars and bass, and Simpson and Kara DioGuardi performed background vocals.

==Critical reception==
The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics. IGN.com said of the song that it &quot;lopes along to a feel good melancholic guitar strum while [Simpson] waxes like any lovelorn 19-year old would about the current love of their life.&quot; Another review said that the &quot;stringy&quot; guitar riffs in &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; were &quot;simple, yet effective&quot;, with the &quot;catchy chorus bringing the song to life.&quot; According to one review of the album, Simpson&#x27;s singing on the track goes from &quot;impassioned wail to innocent cooing ably.&quot; A UK review of the single called it &quot;palatable&quot; &quot;as guitar-led lipstick confessionals go&quot;. It has also been described as a &quot;perfect choice&quot; for the album&#x27;s first single, having &quot;a tempo between fast and slow, with hints of both throughout the song.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Pieces of Me&quot; began receiving widespread radio play in the U.S. in May 2004, well before the album&#x27;s release on July 20. According to an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; 97 stations added &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; to their play lists in the week ending on May 17, which it said was the strongest week for any single in 2004 at that point in the year. The song debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 61 in June 2004 (the chart&#x27;s top début for the week) and reached the top 10 in August with a rise from number 13 to number nine. It then rose to number eight the next week, where it spent two weeks before peaking at number five on the Hot 100 in September 2004. After spending one week at number five, it fell to number six and then to number seven. &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; remained in the top 50 on the Hot 100 chart until November 2004. It also reached number one on the Billboard Top 40 Tracks chart. The single was certified gold in October 2004 and platinum in January 2005. &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; was number 39 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s 2004 year end Hot 100 Singles &amp; Tracks chart and number 36 on the year end Hot 100 Singles Sales chart.

The U.S. CD single was released by Geffen Records on June 29, 2004, and debuted at number three in single sales (behind &quot;American Idol&quot; stars Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo) with almost 8,000 copies sold. The single includes the album version of the song as well as an instrumental. On the cover, Simpson has dark hair, and the artwork is similar to that of the album &quot;Autobiography&quot;; an earlier, promotional version of the single shows a blonde Simpson with a yellow jacket. This promotional version includes only the original version of the song.

The single was released in the United Kingdom on September 27, 2004, on two CDs; the first includes a David Garcia &amp; High Spies remix, and the second includes remixes, a of snippets of songs from &quot;Autobiography&quot; (&quot;Shadow&quot;, &quot;Autobiography&quot;, &quot;La La&quot;, and &quot;Better Off&quot;), and the &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; music video. &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; debuted at number four on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending October 3 and remained in the top 40 for seven weeks.

Simpson has described her excitement when she first heard the song on the radio:

In Australia, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; made its debut on the ARIA singles chart at number 14, and peaked for two weeks at number 7 in September; it fell out of the top 40 in late November 2004. &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; was also accredited as a gold single in Australia. In New Zealand, the song debuted on the RIANZ top 40 singles chart at number 33 in September 2004, peaked at 32 the next week, and fell out of the top 40 after its third week.

In Germany, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; reached number 26 on the singles chart, and in Austria it debuted at number 43 and peaked at 15 in its sixth week. In Switzerland, it debuted at number 17 and peaked at 11 in its third week, in October 2004. In Italy, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; peaked at 24 in October 2004, in its fourth week on the top 50 singles chart after debuting at 47; after seven weeks, it fell out of the top 50. In Denmark, the song debuted at 5 and peaked at 4, after which it fell off the chart; in Sweden, it reached a peak of number 31 on the singles chart, while in Norway it stayed on the top 20 singles chart for 12 weeks, peaking at 3 in its fifth week. 

In Japan, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; was a popular hit on radios reaching the top spot in domestic and international top in Japan Radio. It also reached the top 5 in countries such as Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and Taiwan.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Pieces of Me&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Autobiography&quot; on June 29, 2004. The music video for the song, directed by Stefan Smith, features Simpson (wearing a white shirt emblazoned with the word &quot;punk&quot; and a pink dress, as well as using Fostex T20RP headphones) and her band in the studio interspersed with clips of reality TV footage. The video is fairly simplistic, and Simpson refers to the more elaborate video for her second single, &quot;Shadow&quot;, as her first &quot;real&quot; video.

Simpson appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on May 17, 2004, and the &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; video was premiered on the show on this date. On June 2, she also appeared on the show and performed the song. The video did not debut on the countdown&#x27;s top 10 until July 19; however, it reached number one for the first time on August 4 and remained on the countdown through September 13. The &quot;Shadow&quot; video premiered on the following day and took the place of &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; on the countdown.

Simpson has frequently performed &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; live, including a number of notable television performances. She sang the song at Summer Music Mania on May 20, and it aired on FOX on June 1. Simpson sang &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; (followed by a brief interview with Jay Leno) on the May 24, 2004, episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and she also sang the song on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on July 16. She performed &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; (after a brief interview with Charles Gibson) on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on July 19, the day before her album was released in the U.S., and on July 27, she sang it (after an interview) on Ryan Seacrest&#x27;s talk show, &quot;On Air With Ryan Seacrest.&quot; On August 8 she performed &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; on the Teen Choice Awards, and the song also received the &quot;Song of the Summer&quot; award. On August 29, Simpson performed the song during the pre-show for the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards.

The song made its debut somewhat later in the United Kingdom, where the album was also released several months after it was in the U.S. In September 2004, Simpson made several notable television appearances in the UK in which she performed the song, including on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (September 17), &quot;Top of the Pops Saturday&quot; (September 25), &quot;CD:UK&quot; and &quot;Popworld&quot;.

Later in 2004, on the October 23 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Simpson performed &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; as her first of two songs that night; when she started to perform her second song (which was supposed to be &quot;Autobiography&quot;), a recording of &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; was mistakenly played instead, indicating that Simpson was using some sort of vocal aid. She began to do an impromptu jig (which she later named as a hoedown) when she realized she had been caught lip-syncing, and then left the stage. (She later explained it as being due to her acid reflux condition.) For her next performance, at the Radio Music Awards on October 25, Simpson poked fun at the &quot;SNL&quot; incident by having some of &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; play at the beginning of her performance, to suggest that she was caught in the same situation as before, only to then smile and exclaim that she was &quot;just kidding&quot; and begin performing &quot;Autobiography.&quot; The incident was also parodied in Good Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;I Just Wanna Live&quot; music video and later on &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

Simpson subsequently performed &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; (in addition to a performance of &quot;La La&quot;) on &quot;Jingle Ball Rock&quot;, a television special on FOX featuring performances by a number of popular artists; it was taped on December 3 and aired on the evening of December 17. She also sang the song as part of a concert broadcast live over the Internet on December 6, and during the performance she pulled a member of the audience up on stage with her. Simpson later performed the song on &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve 2005,&quot; in which she also hosted the West Coast portion of the show.

The video for &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Pop Video&quot; for the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;Since U Been Gone.&quot; The video was also nominated for the same category for the 2005 MTV Australia Video Music Awards, but lost to Guy Sebastian&#x27;s &quot;Out with My Baby.&quot;

As part of the promotion for her third album, &quot;Bittersweet World,&quot; Simpson performed &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;, together with her newer single &quot;Little Miss Obsessive&quot;, on &quot;The TODAY Show&quot; on April 18, 2008.

<doc id="1063371" wikidata="Q2094605" url="?curid=1063371" title="Joseph Massino">
<text>Joseph Charles Massino (January 10, 1943 – September 14, 2023) was an American mobster. He was a member of the Mafia and boss of the Bonanno crime family from 1991 until 2004, when he became the first boss of one of the Five Families in New York City to turn state&#x27;s evidence.

Massino was a protégé of Philip Rastelli, who took control of the Bonanno family in 1973. Rastelli spent most of his reign in and out of prison, but was able to get the assassination of Carmine Galante, a mobster vying for power, approved in 1979. Originally a truck hijacker, Massino secured his own power after arranging two 1981 gang murders, first a triple murder of three rebel captains, then his rival Dominick Napolitano. In 1991, while Massino was in prison for a 1986 labor racketeering conviction, Rastelli died and Massino succeeded him. Upon his release the following year, he set about rebuilding a family that had been in turmoil for almost a quarter of a century. By the dawn of the new millennium, he was reckoned as the most powerful Mafia leader in the nation. Massino became known as &quot;The Last Don&quot;, the only full-fledged New York boss of his time who was not in prison.

In July 2004, Massino was convicted in a RICO case based on the testimony of several cooperating made men, including Massino&#x27;s disgruntled underboss and brother-in-law Salvatore Vitale. He was also facing the death penalty if convicted in a separate murder trial due to be held later that year, but after agreeing to testify against his former associates, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for both indictments in 2005. Massino testified twice for the government, helping to win a murder conviction against his acting boss Vincent Basciano in 2011, and was resentenced to time served in 2013.

== Early years ==
Joseph Massino was born on January 10, 1943, in New York City. He was one of three sons of Neapolitan-American Anthony and Adeline Massino. Raised in Maspeth, Queens, Massino has admitted to being a juvenile delinquent by the age of 12 and claimed that at 14 he ran away from home to Florida. He dropped out of Grover Cleveland High School in tenth grade.

Massino first met his future wife Josephine Vitale in 1956, and married her in 1960. The couple had three daughters. Massino also befriended Josephine&#x27;s brother, Salvatore Vitale, who, after briefly serving in the Army, became one of Massino&#x27;s most trusted allies. While athletic in youth, Massino was an avid cook, and grew overweight in adulthood. His weight gained him the nickname &quot;Big Joey&quot;, and during a 1987 racketeering trial, when he asked FBI agent Joseph Pistone who was to play him in a film adaptation of his undercover work, Pistone joked that they could not find anyone fat enough. By 2004, Massino was suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure as well.

After he turned state&#x27;s evidence, Massino claimed his first murder victim was a Bonanno crime family associate named Tommy Zummo, whom he shot dead some time in 1969. The killing aroused the ire of Maspeth-based Bonanno caporegime Philip Rastelli, but he remained unaware of Massino&#x27;s participation, and a nephew of Rastelli ultimately helped Massino become his protégé. Rastelli would set Massino up as a lunch wagon operator as part of his &quot;Workmen&#x27;s Mobile Lunch Association&quot;, an effective protection racket; after paying a kickback to Rastelli in the form of membership dues, Massino was assured no competition where he operated.

== Bonanno crime family ==

=== Rise to power ===
By the late 1960s, Massino was a Bonanno associate. He led a successful truck hijacking crew, with the assistance of his brother-in-law Salvatore Vitale and carjacker Duane Leisenheimer, while fencing the stolen goods and running numbers using the lunch wagon as a front. He also befriended another mob hijacker, future Gambino crime family boss John Gotti. Increasingly prosperous, Massino opened his own catering company, J&amp;J Catering, which became another front for his activities. In 1973, boss Natale Evola died. On February 23, 1974, at a meeting at the Americana Hotel in Manhattan, the Commission named Massino&#x27;s mentor, Rastelli as boss. On April 23, 1976, Rastelli was convicted of extortion, and on August 27, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In his absence Carmine Galante, a former consigliere and convicted drug trafficker, seized control of the Bonannos as unofficial acting boss.

In 1975, Massino and Vitale participated in the murder of Vito Borelli, who Massino claimed was primarily executed by Gotti at the behest of Paul Castellano of the Gambino crime family. The Borelli hit was significant for Massino in that he &quot;made his bones&quot;—proved his loyalty to the Mafia by killing on its behalf—and put him close to becoming a made man, a full member, in the Bonanno family. Massino also arranged the murder of one of his hijackers, Joseph Pastore, in 1976, after having Vitale borrow $9,000 from him on his behalf. While later acquitted of the crime, both Vitale and Massino would admit to participation after turning state&#x27;s evidence.

In March 1975, Massino was arrested along with of one of his hijackers, Raymond Wean, and charged with conspiracy to receive stolen goods. He was scheduled to go on trial in 1977, but the charges were dropped after he successfully argued that he had not been properly mirandized, disqualifying statements Massino gave to police from being used in trial.

On June 14, 1977, Massino was inducted into the Bonanno family along with Anthony Spero, Joseph Chilli Jr. and a group of other men in a ceremony conducted by Carmine Galante. He worked as a soldier in James Galante&#x27;s crew, and later worked in Philip &quot;Phil Lucky&quot; Giaccone&#x27;s crew. Massino nevertheless remained loyal to Rastelli, then vying to oust Galante despite his imprisonment. Fearing Galante wanted him dead for insubordination, Massino delivered a request to the Commission, the governing body of the American Mafia, on Rastelli&#x27;s behalf to have Galante killed. The hit was approved and executed on July 12, 1979; Rastelli subsequently took full control of the family and rewarded Massino&#x27;s loyalty by promoting him to capo.

By the beginning of the 1980s, Massino ran his crew from the J&amp;S Cake social club, a property just behind J&amp;J Catering. The building was seized in 1988 during a crackdown on the Bonannos&#x27; gambling activities.

=== Three capos and Napolitano murders ===

Following the Galante hit, Massino began jockeying for power with Dominick &quot;Sonny Black&quot; Napolitano, another Rastelli loyalist capo. Both men were themselves threatened by another faction seeking to depose the absentee boss led by capos Alphonse &quot;Sonny Red&quot; Indelicato, Dominick &quot;Big Trin&quot; Trincera and Philip Giaccone. The Commission initially tried to maintain neutrality, but in 1981, Massino got word from his informants that the three capos were stocking up on automatic weapons and planning to kill the Rastelli loyalists within the Bonanno family to take complete control. Massino turned to Colombo crime family boss Carmine Persico and Gambino boss Paul Castellano for advice; they told him to act immediately.

Massino, Napolitano and Gerlando Sciascia, a Sicilian-born capo linked to the Montreal Rizzuto crime family, arranged a meeting at a Brooklyn social club with the three capos for May 5, 1981. They had four gunmen, including Vitale and Bonanno-affiliated Montreal boss Vito Rizzuto, hiding in a closet to ambush them. When Trinchera, Giaccone and Indelicato arrived with Frank Lino to meet Massino, they were shot to death, with Massino himself stopping Indelicato from escaping. Lino escaped unscathed by running out the door. The hit further improved Massino&#x27;s prestige, but was marred by both Lino&#x27;s escape and the discovery of Indelicato&#x27;s body on May 28.

Massino quickly won Lino over to his side, but Indelicato&#x27;s son, Anthony &quot;Bruno&quot; Indelicato, vowed revenge. Napolitano assigned associate Donnie Brasco, who he hoped to make a made man, to kill Indelicato. &quot;Brasco&quot;, however, was in fact an undercover FBI agent named Joseph Pistone; shortly after the hit was ordered, Pistone&#x27;s assignment was ended and Napolitano was informed of their infiltration.

Already skeptical of Napolitano&#x27;s support of &quot;Brasco&quot;, Massino was deeply disturbed by the breach of security when he learned of the agent&#x27;s true identity. Vitale would later testify that this was the reason Massino subsequently decided to murder Napolitano as well; as he would later quote Massino, &quot;I have to give him a receipt for the Donnie Brasco situation.&quot; In his own testimony, Massino instead claimed Napolitano was targeted for trying to take over the Bonannos himself. On August 17, the former renegade Frank Lino and Steven Cannone drove Napolitano to the house of Ronald Filocomo, a Bonanno family associate, for a meeting. Napolitano was greeted by captain Frank Coppa, then thrown down the stairs to the house&#x27;s basement by Lino and shot to death. Napolitano&#x27;s body was discovered the following year.

Benjamin &quot;Lefty&quot; Ruggiero, who helped Pistone formally become a Bonanno associate, was also targeted, but was arrested en route to the meeting where he was expected to be murdered. On February 18, 1982, Anthony Mirra, the soldier who first &quot;discovered&quot; Pistone, was assassinated on Massino&#x27;s orders. Mirra had gone into hiding upon Pistone&#x27;s exposure but was ultimately betrayed and murdered by his protégé and cousin, Joseph D&#x27;Amico.

=== Fugitive and Bonventre murder ===
On November 23, 1981, based on information gained by Pistone&#x27;s infiltration, six Bonanno mobsters, including the then-missing Napolitano, were indicted on racketeering charges and conspiracy in &quot;the three capos&quot; hit.

In March 1982, Massino was tipped off by a Colombo-associated FBI insider that he was about to be indicted and went into hiding in Pennsylvania with Leisenheimer. On March 25, 1982, Massino was also charged with conspiracy to murder Indelicato, Giaccone and Trinchera and truck hijacking. In hiding, Massino was able to see the prosecution&#x27;s strategy and better plan his defense as well as eventually face trial without association with other mobsters. Pistone later speculated Massino also feared retaliation upon the revelation that his associate, Raymond Wean, had turned state&#x27;s evidence. Massino was visited by many fellow mobsters, including Gotti, and Vitale would secretly deliver cash to support him.

On April 21, 1983, Rastelli was paroled, and he and Massino ordered the murder of Bonanno capo Cesare Bonventre, the leader of the family&#x27;s Sicilian faction. Still a fugitive, Massino summoned Vitale, Louis Attanasio and James Tartaglione to his hideout and gave them the order. By this time, even though Rastelli was still officially head of the family, Massino was considered by most mobsters to be the family&#x27;s street boss and field commander in all but name, as well as Rastelli&#x27;s heir apparent. According to Vitale, Massino had Bonventre killed for giving him no support when he was in hiding.

In April 1984, Bonventre was called to a meeting with Rastelli in Queens. He was picked up by Vitale and Attanasio and driven to a garage. En route, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him; he would kill Bonventre with two more shots when they reached their destination. The task of disposing of Bonventre&#x27;s corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti, who promised Vitale that Bonventre&#x27;s remains would disappear forever. However, after a tipoff, the remains were discovered on April 16, 1984, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, stuffed into two 55-gallon glue drums.

For his part in the hit, Massino had Vitale initiated into the Bonanno family.

=== 1986 conviction and 1987 acquittal ===

Through Gotti associate Angelo Ruggiero, Massino was able to meet with defense attorney John Pollok in 1984 to negotiate his surrender. He finally turned himself in on July 7 and was released on $350,000 bail. That year, Massino and Salvatore Vitale secured no-show jobs with the Long Island based King Caterers in exchange for protecting them from Lucchese extortion.

In 1985, Massino was indicted twice more, first as a co-conspirator with Rastelli in a labor racketeering case for controlling the Teamsters Local 814, then with a conspiracy charge for the Pastore murder that was added to the original three capos indictment. The second indictment also charged Vitale as a co-conspirator in the hijacking cases.

The labor racketeering trial began in April 1986, with Massino as one of 12 defendants including Rastelli and former underboss Nicholas Marangello. While Massino protested in confidence to other mobsters he never had the opportunity to profit from the racket, he was implicated by both Pistone and union official Anthony Gilberti, and on October 15, 1986, was found guilty of racketeering charges for accepting kickbacks on the Bonannos&#x27; behalf. On January 16, 1987, Massino was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment, his first prison term. Rastelli, also convicted and in poor health during the trial, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Around this time, Massino was believed to be the Bonanno family&#x27;s official underboss. With Rastelli in declining health, Massino was also reckoned as the operating head of the family, though consigliere Anthony &quot;Old Man&quot; Spero was nominally acting boss.

In April 1987, Massino and Vitale went on trial for truck hijacking and conspiracy to commit the triple murder, defended by Samuel H. Dawson and Bruce Cutler respectively. Prosecutor Michael Chertoff, describing Massino&#x27;s rise in his opening statements, would characterize him as the &quot;Horatio Alger of the mob&quot;. Raymond Wean and Joseph Pistone testified against Massino, but both proved unable to conclusively link Massino with any of the murder charges. On June 3, while both men were convicted on hijacking charges, they were cleared of the murder conspiracy charges. Further, the only proven criminal acts took place outside the RICO act&#x27;s five-year statute of limitations; without evidence that the &quot;criminal enterprise&quot; was still active in this timeframe the jury returned a special verdict clearing Massino and Vitale of these charges as well.

During Massino&#x27;s imprisonment at Talladega Federal Prison for his 1986 conviction, Vitale functioned as his messenger, effectively becoming co-acting boss alongside Spero. On Massino&#x27;s orders, Vitale organized the murder of Gabriel Infanti, who had also botched a 1982 hit on Anthony Gilberti and was suspected of being an informant.

== Bonanno boss ==

=== The family regroups ===
During his meetings with Massino in prison, Vitale, on behalf of the Bonannos&#x27; capos, urged his brother-in-law to become boss in name as well as in fact. Rastelli had spent all but two years of his reign behind bars, and many felt Massino would bring the family stability. Massino was reluctant to take over as long as Rastelli was alive. Not only was he respectful of Rastelli&#x27;s sponsorship of his Mafia career, but Mafia tradition dictates that a boss keeps his title for life unless he abdicates. However, in the spring of 1991, Massino ordered Vitale to &quot;make me boss&quot; as soon as Rastelli died; Rastelli died on June 24, 1991. A few days after his funeral, Massino instructed Vitale to call a meeting of the family&#x27;s capos, and Massino was acclaimed as boss.

Massino was granted two years&#x27; supervised release on November 13, 1992. During that time, he could not associate with convicted mafiosi. To get around this restriction, Massino named Vitale underboss and retained him as his messenger for the duration of his supervised release. While the FBI suspected Vitale was a mafioso, he had never been convicted of a Mafia-related crime. The FBI would thus have no reason to be suspicious of him associating with Massino since they were brothers-in-law. He returned to his job at King Caterers, and in 1996 became co-owner of Casablanca, a well-reviewed Maspeth Italian restaurant.

Massino was 48 years old at the time of his accession, and knew that he potentially had a long reign ahead of him. With this in mind, he was determined to avoid the pitfalls that landed other Mafia bosses in prison. Inspired by Genovese boss Vincent Gigante, Massino forbade his men from saying his name out loud due to FBI surveillance. Instead, they were to touch their ears when referring to him. Massino gained the nickname &quot;The Ear&quot; because of this. Massino took a great number of precautions in regards to security and the possibility of anything incriminating being picked up on a wiretap. He closed the family&#x27;s longtime social clubs. He also arranged family meetings to be conducted in remote locations within the United States. In some cases, he held meetings in foreign countries, and had his capos bring their wives along so they could be passed off as vacations. Remembering how Pistone&#x27;s infiltration had damaged the family, he also decreed that all prospective made men had to have a working relationship with an incumbent member for at least eight years before becoming made, in hopes of ensuring new mafiosi were as reliable as possible. Unusually for bosses of his era, he actively encouraged his men to have their sons made as well. In Massino&#x27;s view, this would make it less likely that a capo would turn informer, since if that happened the defector&#x27;s son would face almost certain death.

To minimize the damage from informants or undercover investigations Massino decentralized the family&#x27;s organization. He created a clandestine cell system for his crews, forbidding them from contacting one another and avoiding meeting their capos. He would instead create a new committee that would relay his orders to the crews. In contrast to his contemporaries, particularly the publicity-friendly Gotti and the conspicuous feigned insanity of Gigante, Massino himself was also able to operate with a relatively low public profile; both Pistone and mob writer Jerry Capeci would consequently refer to Massino as the &quot;last of the old-time gangsters&quot;.

A side effect of these reforms was the reduction of Vitale, in his own words, to &quot;a figurehead&quot;. By the time of Massino&#x27;s release the Bonanno family had grown tired of Vitale, regarding him as greedy and overstepping his authority. In the new structure of the family, Vitale lost the underboss&#x27;s usual role as a go-between for the boss, as well as the share of the family&#x27;s profits those duties entailed, and Massino made it clear to Vitale his unpopularity was a factor in these changes. Vitale remained loyal, however, and helped Massino organize the March 18, 1999 murder of Gerlando Sciascia. Massino indicated to fellow mobsters that Sciascia was killed for feuding with fellow Massino-confidant capo Anthony Graziano, accusing him of using cocaine, while in his own testimony Massino claimed Sciascia was killed for killing another mobster&#x27;s son. Sciascia&#x27;s body was not covertly buried but instead left to be discovered in a street in the Bronx, an attempt to make the hit look like a botched drug deal rather than a Mafia-ordered hit, and Massino had his capos attend Sciascia&#x27;s funeral.

Shortly after becoming boss, Massino announced that his men should no longer consider themselves as part of the Bonanno family. Instead, he renamed it the Massino family, after himself. Like many mafiosi, he was angered at family namesake Joseph Bonanno&#x27;s tell-all autobiography, &quot;A Man of Honor&quot;, and regarded it as a violation of the code of omertà. He told Vitale that in his view, &quot;Joe Bonanno disrespected the family by ratting.&quot; The new name was first disclosed after Massino was indicted in 2003 and did not catch on outside the Mafia.

=== Relations with other families ===
Before Massino became boss, John Gotti was one of his closest allies. Massino had backed Gotti in his plot to take over the Gambino family, and as Gambino boss, Gotti tried to get Massino a seat on the Commission as the Bonannos&#x27; acting boss. Gotti was reportedly infuriated that Massino had been officially promoted without him being consulted, and Massino would later testify he believed Gotti conspired with Vitale to kill him. Gotti, however, was marginalized by his 1992 racketeering and murder conviction and consequent life imprisonment. Massino, for his own part, was angered at Gotti&#x27;s high public profile and later criticized Gotti for killing Gotti&#x27;s predecessor, Paul Castellano. Massino also had a poor relationship with Vincent Gigante, who had backed the opposition to Rastelli and blocked Gotti&#x27;s attempts to bring Massino onto the Commission.

The Bonanno family had been in decline for the better part of the last quarter century since Joe Bonanno&#x27;s ouster in the 1960s, and it was kicked off the Commission altogether following Pistone&#x27;s infiltration. By the late 1990s, the situation was reversed and the Bonanno family was now reckoned as the most powerful crime family in New York and the nation, in no small part because Massino was the only full-fledged New York boss who was still on the streets. As it turned out, being thrown off the Commission actually worked in the Bonannos&#x27; favor; they were the only family whose leadership wasn&#x27;t decimated in the Mafia Commission Trial. Wary of surveillance, Massino generally avoided meeting with members of other Mafia families and encouraged his crews to operate independently as well. In January 2000, however, Massino did preside over an informal Commission meeting with the acting bosses of the other four families. As the most powerful Mafia leader in both New York and the nation, Massino was in a position to make general policies for the Five Families. Under his direction, the Commission tightened qualifications to become a made man, requiring candidates have full Italian descent (previously having an Italian-American father was the minimum requirement) and imposed restrictions on initiating associates convicted on drug charges.

According to Capeci, the murder of Sciascia soured relations between the Bonanno and Rizzuto families. Originally considered merely a Canadian Bonanno crew, the Rizzutos responded by taking even less heed from New York.

=== Run-up to prosecution ===
At the beginning of his reign as boss, Massino enjoyed the benefit of limited FBI attention. In 1987, with the Bonannos weakened, the FBI merged its Bonanno squad with its Colombo family squad, and this squad was initially preoccupied with the Colombos&#x27; third internal war. Another dedicated Bonanno squad would be established in 1996.

The Bonanno squad&#x27;s chief, Jack Stubing, was well aware of the measures Massino had taken to avoid scrutiny. He therefore decided to go after Massino with a rear-guard action. He convinced his bosses to lend him a pair of forensic accountants normally used in fraud investigations, believing that they could easily pinpoint conspirators in the family&#x27;s money laundering schemes. Stubing believed that the threat of long prison sentences would be sufficient to get any conspirators to turn informer, and thus make it easier to trace how the money flowed to Massino. In the meantime, the FBI also targeted other members of the Bonanno administration. In 1995, consigliere Anthony Spero was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment after being convicted of loansharking, then to life imprisonment in 2002 for murder. Graziano would assume Spero&#x27;s duties, but he too pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in December 2002 and was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment. Vitale would also plead guilty to loansharking charges in June 2002. Vitale was not immediately sentenced, and was placed under house arrest in the interim, but the relatively low maximum sentence he was eligible for led Massino to wrongly suspect he was cooperating with law enforcement. He secretly ordered that, if he was arrested, Vitale was to be &quot;taken down&quot;—demoted or killed.

Until 2002, the Bonannos had been the only family in the modern history of the New York Mafia (i. e., since the Castellammarese War) to have never had a made man turn informant or government witness. Massino used this as a point of pride to rally his crime family. That year Frank Coppa, convicted on fraud and facing further charges from the FBI&#x27;s forensic accounting investigation, became the first to flip. He was followed shortly by acting underboss Richard Cantarella, a participant in the Mirra murder, who was facing racketeering and murder charges. A third, Joseph D&#x27;Amico, subsequently turned state&#x27;s evidence with the knowledge that Cantarella could implicate him for murder as well. All of these defections left Massino, at last, vulnerable to serious charges.

== 2004 conviction ==

On January 9, 2003, Massino was arrested and indicted, alongside Vitale, Frank Lino and capo Daniel Mongelli, in a comprehensive racketeering indictment. The charges against Massino himself included ordering the 1981 murder of Napolitano. Massino was denied bail, and Vincent Basciano took over as acting boss in his absence. Massino hired David Breitbart, an attorney he had originally wanted to represent him in his 1987 trial, for his defense.

Three more Bonanno made men would choose to cooperate before Massino came to trial. The first was James Tartaglione; anticipating he would shortly be indicted as well he went to the FBI and agreed to wear a wire while he remained free. The second was Salvatore Vitale. In custody Massino again put out the word, to a receptive Bonanno family, that he wanted Vitale killed. After learning of Massino&#x27;s earlier plans to kill his brother-in-law from Coppa and Cantarella, prosecutors informed Vitale. Vitale was already dissatisfied by the lack of support he and his family received from Massino after his arrest. On the day he was arraigned with Massino, Vitale decided to flip as soon as it was safe to do so; he formally reached a deal with prosecutors in February. He was followed in short order by Lino, knowing Vitale could implicate him in murder as well. Also flipping was longtime Bonanno associate Duane Leisenheimer, concerned for his safety after an investigator for Massino&#x27;s defense team visited to find out if he intended to flip.

With these defections, Massino was slapped with a superseding indictment charging him with seven additional murders: the three capos (this time for participation in the murder itself rather than conspiracy), Mirra, Bonventre, Infanti and Sciascia. Of particular interest was the Sciascia hit, which took place after a 1994 amendment to racketeering laws that allowed the death penalty for murder in aid of racketeering.

Massino&#x27;s trial began on May 24, 2004, with judge Nicholas Garaufis presiding and Greg D. Andres and Robert Henoch heading the prosecution. He now faced 11 RICO counts for seven murders (due to the prospect of prosecutors seeking the death penalty for the Sciascia murder, that case was severed to be tried separately), arson, extortion, loansharking, illegal gambling, and money laundering. By this time, &quot;Time&quot; magazine had dubbed Massino as &quot;the Last Don&quot;, in reference to his status as the only New York boss not serving a prison sentence at that point. The name stuck.

Despite a weak start, with opening witness Anthony Gilberti unable to recognize Massino in the courtroom, the prosecution would establish its case to link Massino with the charges in the indictment through an unprecedented seven major turncoats, including the six turned made men. Vitale, the last of the six to take the stand, was of particular significance. He had spent most of his three decades in the Mafia as a close confidant to Massino, and his closeness to his brother-in-law allowed him to cover Massino&#x27;s entire criminal history in his testimony. Breitbart&#x27;s defense rested primarily on cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, with his only witness being an FBI agent to challenge Vitale&#x27;s reliability. His defense was also unusual in that he made no attempt to contest that Massino was the Bonanno boss, instead stressing the murders in the case took place before he took over and that Massino himself &quot;showed a love of life...because the murders ceased.&quot; Vitale had admitted to 11 murders, but for his cooperation, was sentenced to time served in October 2010, and entered the witness protection program.

After deliberating for five days, the jury found Massino guilty of all 11 counts on July 30, 2004. His sentencing was initially scheduled for October 12, and he was expected to receive a sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. The jury also approved the prosecutors&#x27; recommended $10 million forfeiture of the proceeds of his reign as Bonanno boss on the day of the verdict.

== Turning state&#x27;s evidence ==
Immediately after his July 30 conviction, as court was adjourned, Massino requested a meeting with Judge Garaufis, where he made his first offer to cooperate. He did so in hopes of sparing his life; he was facing the death penalty if found guilty of Sciascia&#x27;s murder. Indeed, one of John Ashcroft&#x27;s final acts as Attorney General was to order federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Massino. Massino thus stood to be the first Mafia boss to be executed since Lepke Buchalter was executed in 1944.

Massino subsequently claimed he decided to turn informer due to the prospect of his wife and mother having to forfeit their houses to the government. Mob authors and journalists Anthony D. DeStefano and Selwyn Raab both consider the turning of so many made men as a factor in disillusioning Massino with Cosa Nostra, the former also assuming Massino had decided to flip &quot;long before the verdict&quot;. Massino was the first sitting boss of a New York crime family to turn state&#x27;s evidence, and the second in the history of the American Mafia to do so (Philadelphia crime family boss Ralph Natale had flipped in 1999 when facing drug charges). It also marked the second time in a little more than a year that a New York boss had reached a plea bargain; Gigante had pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice charges in 2003 after prosecutors unmasked his long charade of feigning insanity.

At his advice, that October the FBI revisited the Queens mob graveyard where Alphonse Indelicato&#x27;s body was found, and unearthed the bodies of Trinchera and Giaccone as well. They also hoped to find the body of John Favara, who accidentally killed Gotti&#x27;s son, and the body of Tommy DeSimone. Massino also reported that Vincent Basciano, arrested in November, had conspired to kill prosecutor Greg Andres, but after failing a polygraph test regarding the discussion he agreed to wear a wire when meeting the acting boss in jail. While Massino was unable to extract an unambiguous confession regarding Andres, he did record Basciano freely admit to ordering the murder of associate Randolph Pizzolo.

By the end of January 2005, when Basciano was indicted for the Pizzolo murder, Massino was identified by news sources as the then-anonymous fellow mobster who secretly recorded his confession, to the public disgust of Massino&#x27;s family. Further confirmation of Massino&#x27;s defection came in February as he was identified as the source for the graveyard, then in May when the Justice Department dropped the threat of the death penalty regarding the Sciascia case. In a hearing on June 23, 2005, Massino finalized his deal and pleaded guilty to ordering the Sciascia murder. For this and his 2004 conviction he was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, with a possible reduction depending on his service as a witness. That same day Josephine Massino negotiated a settlement to satisfy the forfeiture claim, keeping the homes of herself and Massino&#x27;s mother as well as some rental properties while turning over, among other assets, a cache of $7 million and hundreds of gold bars both of which were kept in his Howard Beach home, and the Casablanca restaurant.

Massino was not replaced as Bonanno boss until 2013 when Michael Mancuso, who had replaced Basciano as acting boss, was reported to have formally assumed the title.

=== Testimony and release ===
Massino was conspicuously absent from the prosecution witnesses at the 2006 racketeering trial of Basciano, the prosecution deciding he was not yet needed; he was also expected to testify against Vito Rizzuto regarding his role in the three capos murder, but the Montreal boss accepted a plea bargain in May 2007 before Rizzuto&#x27;s case went to trial. He finally made his debut as a witness at Basciano&#x27;s trial for the murder of Randolph Pizzolo in April 2011; Massino&#x27;s testified both during the trial itself and, after Basciano was convicted, on behalf of the prosecution&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to impose the death penalty. During his testimony Massino noted, as a result of his cooperation, &quot;I&#x27;m hoping to see a light at the end of the tunnel.&quot;

Massino testified again in the 2012 extortion trial of Genovese capo Anthony Romanello, primarily to provide background as an expert on the American Mafia. While Massino had not worked closely with Romanello, prosecutors decided to use him after another mobster-turned-witness was dropped; the case ended in an acquittal. Massino had also been considered as a witness in the 2013 murder trial of Colombo acting boss Joel Cacace, but was dropped after he was unable to fully remember the meeting where he claimed Cacace indicated his involvement in the murder of NYPD officer Ralph Dols.

In June 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a request to Judge Garaufis for a reduction of Massino&#x27;s sentence; prosecutors cited both the impact of Massino&#x27;s unprecedented cooperation and his failing health as reasons for a reduction of his sentence. Garaufis granted their request on July 10, resentencing Massino to time served and supervised release for the remainder of his life.

Massino lived out his final years in the Federal Witness Protection Program, residing at an upscale retirement community in the Greater Cleveland area under the alias &quot;Ralph Rogers&quot;. After he was recognized during a visit to a Downtown Cleveland casino by a man who later confronted him at his retirement home, Massino was instructed by the FBI and U.S. Marshals to relocate, although he declined and instead remained in Ohio.

==Death==
Massino died following a short illness at a rehabilitation facility in Glen Cove, Long Island on September 14, 2023, at the age of 80. He had been living in Ohio until shortly before his death.

<doc id="1063375" wikidata="Q283105" url="?curid=1063375" title="Wang Yun (Han dynasty)">
<text>Wang Yun () (137–4 July 192), courtesy name Zishi, was a Chinese politician who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty. He served in the Han government through the reigns of three emperors – Emperor Ling (), Emperor Shao (189) and Emperor Xian (). The highest offices he served in were Manager of the Affairs of the Masters of Writing and Minister over the Masses in the early reign of Emperor Xian. In 192, with help from the general Lü Bu and others, he plotted a successful coup in Chang&#x27;an against Dong Zhuo, a tyrannical warlord and regent who controlled the Han central government, and assassinated him. However, later that year, Dong Zhuo&#x27;s followers staged a counter-coup and seized back control of the central government in Chang&#x27;an. Wang Yun and his family members were captured and executed.

In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Wang Yun was the adoptive father of the fictional maiden Diaochan, whom he used to stir up conflict between Lü Bu and Dong Zhuo, causing the former to betray and assassinate the latter.

==Life==
According to &quot;Book of Later Han&quot;, Wang Yun was from Qi County, Taiyuan. His family had many members who had served as administrative officials in the regional government for generations. Wang Yun himself was an official at the age of 19, and became the Inspector of Yu Province (). However, later he failed in the power struggle with the eunuch Zhang Rang. He had to abandon his position and hide himself in the countryside. After the death of Emperor Ling, the general He Jin came into power, and Wang Yun was promoted to the Gentleman of the Household and later to the Intendant of Henan ().

In 190, the capital Luoyang fell into chaos following the death of He Jin and a bloody clash between the powerful Ten Attendants and government officials. Dong Zhuo, a warlord from Liang Province () managed to take control of the situation and eventually placed in the throne a puppet emperor whom he held in his power. At the time, Wang Yun held the positions of the Minister over the Masses (), replacing Yang Biao, and the Prefect of the Masters of Writing ().

Dong Zhuo&#x27;s subsequent tyrannical and cruel behaviour aroused the wrath of many. Wang Yun then colluded with several other officials in a plot to assassinate Dong Zhuo. The plan received a huge boost when the conspirators managed to recruit the help of Lü Bu, a formidable warrior serving as a general under Dong Zhuo. Bringing along a dozen men, Lü Bu cornered Dong Zhuo outside the palace gate and slew him.

After the death of Dong Zhuo, rumours spread that Wang Yun, now the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Han central government, wanted to purge and execute all of Dong Zhuo&#x27;s former subordinates. When Wang Yun refused to grant amnesty to Dong Zhuo&#x27;s former subordinates, they took up arms under the leadership of Li Jue and Guo Si, who led them to attack Chang&#x27;an. Li Jue and Guo Si defeated the Han imperial forces guarding Chang&#x27;an and occupied the capital. While Lü Bu was planning to flee Chang&#x27;an before the city fell, he asked Wang Yun to escape together with him. However, Wang Yun refused to abandon Emperor Xian and remained behind. Li Jue and Guo Si&#x27;s forces captured him and killed him along with his family. Some of Wang Yun&#x27;s relatives managed to escape and survive; one of them was Wang Ling, a nephew of Wang Yun, who later became a general in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Wang Yun appears as a character in two chapters of the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the events in the late Eastern Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period of China. In the novel, Wang Yun devised an elaborate plot to eliminate Dong Zhuo. It involved two of the Thirty-Six Stratagems: Beauty Trap and Chain Stratagems.

In Chapter 8, Wang Yun was thinking about how to get rid of Dong Zhuo when he encountered Diaochan, a singer in his household whom he had been treating like his daughter. An idea struck him: Make use of Diaochan to sow discord between Dong Zhuo and Lü Bu, and instigate Lü Bu to assassinate Dong Zhuo. He then invited Lü Bu and Dong Zhuo to his residence for a party on two occasions. On both occasions, he asked Diaochan to perform for the guest and catch his attention. He initially promised to marry Diaochan to Lü Bu; later, he let Dong Zhuo bring Diaochan home. When Lü Bu found out, he suspected that Dong Zhuo had seized Diaochan for himself and became very angry. One day, while Dong Zhuo was out, Lü Bu sneaked into his room to meet Diaochan. She wept and pleaded with him to save her from Dong Zhuo. In the meantime, Dong Zhuo had returned and he saw Lü Bu embracing Diaochan. He was so furious that he threw a &quot;ji&quot; at Lü Bu which narrowly missed him as he fled. After calming down, Dong Zhuo spoke to Diaochan and asked if she was willing to marry Lü Bu, but she said she would rather die and attempted suicide. Dong Zhuo then believed her.

In Chapter 9, as Lü Bu became increasingly resentful of Dong Zhuo, Wang Yun used the opportunity to instigate and incite Lü Bu to turn against Dong Zhuo. Wang Yun managed to convince Lü Bu to kill Dong Zhuo, and then set up an ambush near the palace gates. He then lied to Dong Zhuo, saying that Emperor Xian wanted to abdicate his throne to him, and lured Dong Zhuo into the ambush, where he met his end at Lü Bu&#x27;s hands. Later in Chapter 9, when Chang&#x27;an was surrounded by Li Jue and Guo Si&#x27;s forces, Wang Yun made them promise to not harm Emperor Xian and then committed suicide in front of them by jumping off the viewing platform above the city gates.

<doc id="1063378" wikidata="Q4963589" url="?curid=1063378" title="Brian Donnelly (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Brian John Donnelly (5 November 1949 – 25 September 2008) was a New Zealand politician. He was a member of the New Zealand First party.

==Early life and career==
Donnelly was born in Auckland, New Zealand, as the third of five children. His father worked as a fabric cutter and later as a real estate agent. Donnelly attended Sacred Heart College on a scholarship. He studied at Massey University and the University of Auckland, and received a Bachelor of Arts, a Bachelor of Education, a Master of Educational Administration, a Diploma in Teaching, and a Diploma in Second Language Teaching. 

He worked in the education sector in New Zealand and the Cook Islands. His educational leadership roles included deputy principal at Titikaveka College in Rarotonga from 1977 to 1980 and principal of Whangarei Intermediate School from 1990 to 1996 (only resigning from the latter on entering parliament). Previously he had also been a lecturer at the Auckland College of Education and worked for the Education Review Office.

==Member of Parliament==


In the 1993 election, he stood for the newly formed New Zealand First in the Whangarei electorate, but was unsuccessful. Donnelly stood again for New Zealand First in Whangarei in the 1996 election and, with the advent of the MMP system, was ranked sixth on the party list. Through the election campaign he was regarded as &quot;an impressive speaker at party gatherings.&quot; 

New Zealand First performed well in the election and Donnelly was elected a list MP. As the party&#x27;s education spokesperson, when New Zealand First formed a coalition with the National Party, he became Minister Responsible for the Education Review Office, Associate Minister of Education, and Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs. As well as sitting as a minister outside of Cabinet, Donnelly was a member of parliament&#x27;s foreign affairs, defence and trade committee. 

Donnelly left his ministerial roles on 26 August 1998 when the coalition collapsed. Donnelly was among the half of New Zealand First members who remained loyal to the party and did not provide continuing support to the government. In the 1999 election Donnelly was ranked third on the New Zealand First list and returned to Parliament as one of the party&#x27;s five members. He continued as the party&#x27;s education spokesperson and also became spokesperson for youth and sports. He sat as a member of the education and science committee. In this term, Parliament passed the Rating Powers (Special Provision for Certain Rates for Educational Establishments) Amendment Act 2001, which had been a member&#x27;s bill in Donnelly&#x27;s name. The purpose of the Act was to set an upper limit on the sewerage disposal rate paid by schools. 

Donnelly was returned as a list MP for his third and fourth terms at the elections in 2002 and 2005. Through both of those terms, he chaired the education and science committee. As well as being his party&#x27;s spokesperson for education and science, he also had responsibility for biosecurity, communications and information technology, industry training, local government, Pacific island affairs, and regional development. 

Donnelly was regarded as a social liberal within his caucus. He voted for legislation enabling civil unions in New Zealand and Sue Bradford&#x27;s member&#x27;s bill to remove the provision allowing parents to use reasonable force in correcting their children. In retaliation, current New Zealand First President Dail Jones threatened demotion of the long-serving List MP, as well as fellow repeal supporter Doug Woolerton. Donnelly was widely respected by members from other political parties and was considered a potential successor to New Zealand First leader Winston Peters.

Donnelly retired from Parliament in February 2008 to take up the role of New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to the Cook Islands. He was succeeded as a list member of Parliament by Dail Jones.

== High Commissioner to the Cook Islands ==
Donnelly had a long association with the Cook Islands which included several years working there as a teacher and representing the islands in rugby. His youngest two children were adopted from the Cook Islands. He learned to speak Cook Islands Māori fluently during his time living there. His appointment as New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to the Cook Islands was brief, from February to August 2008, and ended when he resigned due to ill health.

In the 2008 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Donnelly was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order, for public services.

==Personal life==
Donnelly met his wife Linda through teaching and they married in 1970. They had three children, Theresa, Ioane, and Erena. The youngest two children were adopted.

Donnelly died on 25 September 2008 following a period of illness.

<text>Company Sergeant Major Peter Harold Wright VC (10 August 1916 – 5 April 1990) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and military career==
Peter Harold Wright was born in Mettingham, near Bungay in Suffolk on 10 August 1916, during the First World War. Until the age of 20, he worked on his father&#x27;s farm but decided to join the Coldstream Guards, one of the oldest regiments in the British Army. He served with the 3rd Battalion of his regiment.

==VC citation==
Wright was 27 years old, and a company sergeant major in the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 25 September 1943 near Salerno, Italy, a steep, wooded hill was being assaulted by the 3rd Bn. Coldstream Guards, and Company Sergeant Major Wright&#x27;s company, most of its officers killed, was held up near the crest. Sergeant Major Wright took charge and single-handed he silenced with grenades and bayonet three Spandau posts and then led his men to consolidate the position. He then beat off a counter-attack, and disregarding the heavy fire, brought up extra ammunition.

Wright&#x27;s Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) was substituted for the VC on the instructions of King George VI.

==After the war==
Wright retired from the army in 1945 and in the following year he married Mollie Hurren from Wenhaston, Suffolk. Together they farmed Church Farm at nearby Blythburgh.

Peter Harold Wright died in Ipswich, Suffolk on 5 April 1990, at the age of 73, and is buried in the village churchyard of All Saints at Ashbocking, also in Suffolk.

<doc id="1063381" wikidata="Q7406701" url="?curid=1063381" title="Salvatore Vitale">
<text>Salvatore &quot;Good Looking Sal&quot; Vitale (born September 22, 1947) is an American former underboss of the Bonanno crime family before he became a government informant. After his arrest in 2003, Vitale agreed to cooperate with the government and testify against his brother-in-law, boss Joseph Massino, and in July 2004, Massino was convicted in a RICO case. Vitale had admitted to 11 murders, however, in October 2010, was sentenced to time served due to his cooperation, and entered the witness protection program.

== Early life ==
Vitale was born on September 22, 1947, in Maspeth, Queens in New York City. He was the son of Giuseppe and Lilli Vitale, who had emigrated from the village of San Giuseppe Jato in Sicily after World War II; the couple had already had three daughters, but Salvatore was their only son to survive childbirth. Salvatore was described by his family as emotionally distant as a child.

Vitale first met Joseph Massino, future boss of the Bonanno family, as a child. Massino had begun dating Vitale&#x27;s sister Josephine in 1956, and the couple married in 1960. Massino also befriended Salvatore Vitale, becoming a surrogate &quot;big brother&quot; to his future brother-in-law.

Unlike Massino, Vitale graduated from Grover Cleveland High School in Ridgewood, Queens. He also attempted to have a legitimate career; Vitale entered the U.S. Military and had been trained as a paratrooper. Discharged in 1968, he went on to work briefly as a New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision corrections officer, working in Queens with drug offenders.

He and his wife Diana moved to Long Island, a safe distance from mob-entrenched Maspeth to have a better life for themselves. Salvatore managed his own social club in Maspeth not far from Joseph Massino&#x27;s CasaBlanca Restaurant and Catering Service where he would meet with his underlings. His son Anthony would later work for mob associate Robert Perrino at &quot;The New York Post&quot; after he dropped out of college.

== Criminal career ==
When he quit that job, Vitale approached Joseph Massino for criminal work. He soon became involved in burglaries and transport truck hijacking. He was given a no-show job as a food consultant for King Caterer&#x27;s.

Massino began jockeying for power with Dominick &quot;Sonny Black&quot; Napolitano, another loyalist capo to the boss Philip Rastelli. Both men were themselves threatened by another faction seeking to depose the absentee boss led by capos Alphonse &quot;Sonny Red&quot; Indelicato, Dominick &quot;Big Trin&quot; Trincera and Philip Giaccone. The Commission initially tried to maintain neutrality, but in 1981, Massino got word from Carmine &quot;Tutti&quot; Franzese (Sonny Franzese&#x27;s cousin) that the three capos were stocking up on automatic weapons and planning to kill the Rastelli loyalists within the Bonanno family to take complete control. Massino turned to Colombo crime family boss Carmine Persico and Gambino boss Paul Castellano for advice; they told him to act immediately.

Massino, Napolitano and Gerlando Sciascia, a Sicilian-born capo linked to the Montreal Rizzuto crime family, arranged a meeting at a Brooklyn social club with the three capos for May 5, 1981. They had four gunmen, including Vitale and Bonanno-affiliated Montreal boss Vito Rizzuto, hiding in a closet to ambush them. When Trinchera, Giaccone and Indelicato arrived with Frank Lino to meet Massino, they were shot to death, with Massino himself stopping Indelicato from escaping. Lino escaped unscathed by running out the door. The hit further improved Massino&#x27;s prestige, but was marred by both Lino&#x27;s escape and the discovery of Indelicato&#x27;s body on May 28.

On April 21, 1983, Rastelli was paroled, and he and Massino ordered the murder of Bonanno soldier Cesare Bonventre. Massino summoned Vitale, Louis Attanasio and James Tartaglione to his hideout and gave them the order. By this time, even though Rastelli was still officially head of the family, Massino was considered by most mobsters to be the family&#x27;s street boss and field commander in all but name, as well as Rastelli&#x27;s heir apparent. According to Vitale, Massino had Bonventre killed for giving him no support when he was in hiding.

In April 1984, Bonventre was called to a meeting with Rastelli in Queens. He was picked up by Vitale and Attanasio and driven to a garage. En route, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him; he would kill Bonventre with two more shots when they reached their destination. The task of disposing of Bonventre&#x27;s corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti, who promised Vitale that Bonventre&#x27;s remains would disappear forever. However, after a tipoff, the remains were discovered on April 16, 1984, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, stuffed into two 55-gallon glue drums. For his part in the hit, Massino had Vitale initiated into the Bonanno family.

Later in 1984, Massino and Salvatore Vitale secured no-show jobs with the Long Island based King Caterers in exchange for protecting them from Lucchese extortion. In 1985, an indictment charged Vitale as a co-conspirator in the hijacking cases alongside Massino.

On October 15, 1986, Massino was found guilty of racketeering charges for accepting kickbacks on the Bonannos&#x27; behalf. On January 16, 1987, Massino was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment, his first prison term. Rastelli, also convicted and in poor health during the trial, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Around this time, Massino was believed to be the Bonanno family&#x27;s official underboss. With Rastelli in declining health, Massino was also reckoned as the operating head of the family, though consigliere Anthony &quot;Old Man&quot; Spero was nominally acting boss.

In April 1987, Massino and Vitale went on trial for truck hijacking and conspiracy to commit the triple murder, defended by Samuel H. Dawson and Bruce Cutler respectively. On June 3, while both men were convicted on hijacking charges, they were cleared of the murder conspiracy charges. Further, the only proven criminal acts took place outside the RICO act&#x27;s five-year statute of limitations; without evidence that the &quot;criminal enterprise&quot; was still active in this timeframe the jury returned a special verdict clearing Massino and Vitale of these charges as well.

During Massino&#x27;s imprisonment, Vitale functioned as his messenger, effectively becoming co-acting boss alongside Spero. On Massino&#x27;s orders, Vitale organized the murder of Gabriel Infanti, who had also botched a 1982 hit on Anthony Gilberti and was suspected of being an informant. During his meetings with Massino in prison, Vitale, on behalf of the Bonannos&#x27; capos, urged his brother-in-law to become boss in name as well as in fact. Rastelli had spent all but two years of his reign behind bars, and many felt Massino would bring the family stability. Massino was reluctant to take over as long as Rastelli was alive. Not only was he respectful of Rastelli&#x27;s sponsorship of his Mafia career, but Mafia tradition dictates that a boss keeps his title for life unless he abdicates. However, in the spring of 1991, Massino ordered Vitale, &quot;If Rastelli dies, make me boss.&quot;

Rastelli died on June 24, 1991. A few days after his funeral, in accordance with Massino&#x27;s orders, Vitale called a meeting of the family&#x27;s capos, and Massino was acclaimed as boss.

Massino was granted two years&#x27; supervised release on November 13, 1992. During that time, he could not associate with convicted mafiosi. To get around this restriction, Massino named Vitale underboss and designated him as his messenger for the duration of his supervised release. While the FBI suspected Vitale was a mafioso, he had never been convicted of a Mafia-related crime. The FBI would thus have no reason to be suspicious of him associating with Massino since they were brothers-in-law. He returned to his job at King Caterers, and in 1996 became co-owner of Casablanca, a well-reviewed Maspeth Italian restaurant.

To minimize the damage from informants or undercover investigations Massino decentralized the family&#x27;s organization. He created a clandestine cell system for his crews, forbidding them from contacting one another and avoiding meeting their capos. A side effect of these reforms was the reduction of Vitale, in his own words, to &quot;a figurehead.&quot; By the time of Massino&#x27;s release the Bonanno family had grown tired of Vitale, regarding him as greedy and overstepping his authority. In the new structure of the family, Vitale lost the underboss&#x27;s usual role as a go-between for the boss, as well as the share of the family&#x27;s profits those duties entailed, and Massino made it clear to Vitale his unpopularity was a factor in these changes. Vitale remained loyal, however, and helped Massino organize the March 18, 1999, murder of Gerlando Sciascia. Massino indicated to fellow mobsters that Sciascia was killed for feuding with fellow Massino-confidant capo Anthony Graziano, accusing him of using cocaine, while in his own testimony Massino claimed Sciascia was killed for killing another mobster&#x27;s son. Sciascia&#x27;s body was not covertly buried but instead left to be discovered in a street in the Bronx, an attempt to make the hit look like a botched drug deal rather than a Mafia-ordered hit, and Massino had his capos attend Sciascia&#x27;s funeral.

Vitale was put under house arrest in 2001 after pleading guilty to his role in an extortion scheme on Long Island. Vitale later also pleaded guilty to loansharking charges in June 2002. Vitale was not immediately sentenced, and was placed under house arrest in the interim. However, the maximum sentence Vitale faced was so low that Massino wrongly suspected his underboss was cooperating with law enforcement. He secretly ordered that, if he was arrested, Vitale was to be &quot;taken down&quot;—demoted or killed.

== Informant ==
Until 2002, the Bonannos had been the only family in the modern history of the New York Mafia (i. e., since the Castellammarese War) to have never had a made man turn informant or government witness. Massino used this as a point of pride to rally his crime family. That year, Frank Coppa, convicted on fraud and facing further charges from an FBI forensic accounting investigation, became the first to flip. Coppa gave information that directly implicated both Vitale and acting underboss Richard Cantarella in the Perrino murder. Cantarella himself flipped soon afterward. 

On January 9, 2003, Massino was arrested and indicted, alongside Vitale, Frank Lino and capo Daniel Mongelli, in a comprehensive racketeering indictment. On the day of Vitale&#x27;s arrest, FBI agents dropped a bombshell–they had evidence that Massino believed Vitale had turned informer, and had gone as far as to put a contract on him. 

It turned out that Coppa and Cantarella had told the FBI of Massino&#x27;s earlier plans to kill his brother-in-law. While in custody, Massino again put out the word that he was &quot;very upset&quot; with Vitale and wanted to &quot;give him a receipt&quot;–his term for a whacking. Other Bonanno defendants awaiting trial began calling Vitale &quot;Fredo&quot; (after Fredo Corleone, Michael Corleone&#x27;s turncoat brother in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;). The FBI took the threat very seriously, going as far as to house Massino and Vitale in separate prisons (Massino in Brooklyn, Vitale in Manhattan) and keep them apart when they were not appearing in court.

Vitale was already dissatisfied by the lack of support he and his family received from Massino after his arrest. Despite this, he had every intention of staying loyal until learning that Massino wanted him killed. On the day he was arraigned with Massino, Vitale decided to flip as soon as it was safe to do so; he formally reached a deal with prosecutors in February. 

Shortly after Vitale reached his deal, Lino flipped as well. Lino knew that Vitale could implicate him in at least four murders–including that of Sonny Black. Also flipping was longtime Bonanno associate Duane Leisenheimer, whom Vitale implicated in several crimes, including two murders. When an investigator for Massino&#x27;s defense team started probing to see if Leisenheimer would flip, Leisenheimer feared that Massino would put a contract on him and cut a deal with prosecutors for his own safety.

While the prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of five other turncoats, Vitale was of particular significance to the prosecution&#x27;s case. Not only was he the third confessed underboss of a New York crime family to turn informer (after the Gambinos&#x27; Sammy Gravano and the Luccheses&#x27; Anthony Casso), but he had spent most of his three decades in the Mafia as a close confidant to Massino. This closeness allowed prosecutors to introduce evidence of over three decades of criminal activity by Massino, and enabled Vitale to cover his brother-in-law&#x27;s entire criminal history in his testimony. The only witness called by Massino&#x27;s defense was an FBI agent to challenge Vitale&#x27;s reliability. 

On the strength of testimony from Vitale and other turncoats, Massino was convicted on all 11 RICO counts on July 30, 2004. Facing the prospect of the death penalty for ordering Sciascia&#x27;s murder, Massino almost immediately began talks for a plea deal of his own. He formally pleaded guilty to that charge on June 23, 2005, and was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.

Vitale had admitted to 11 murders, but for his cooperation, was sentenced to time served on October 29, 2010, and entered the witness protection program. Vitale&#x27;s testimony led to the convictions of 51 organized crime figures. Vitale returned to the stand again in March 2012 to testify against Thomas Gioeli.

<text>Ann Hui On-wah, (; born 23 May 1947) is a film director, producer, screenwriter and actress from Hong Kong who is one of the most critically acclaimed filmmakers of the Hong Kong New Wave. She is known for her films about social issues in Hong Kong which include literary adaptations, martial arts, semi-autobiographical works, women&#x27;s issues, social phenomena, political changes, and thrillers. She served as the president of the Hong Kong Film Directors&#x27; Guild from 2004 to 2006.

Hui has won numerous awards. She won Best Director at the Golden Horse Awards three times (1999, 2011, 2014); Best Film at the Asia Pacific Film Festival; and Best Director at the Hong Kong Film Awards six times (1983, 1996, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018).

Only two films have won a Grand Slam (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress) at the Hong Kong Film Awards; they are &quot;Summer Snow&quot; and &quot;A Simple Life&quot;, both directed by Ann Hui. She was honored for her lifetime accomplishments at the 2012 Asian Film Awards. In 2017, the US based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences invited Hui to become a member.

==Early life==
On 23 May 1947, Hui was born in Anshan, a Chinese iron-mining city in Liaoning Province. Hui&#x27;s mother was Japanese and her father was Chinese. In 1952, Hui moved to Macau, then to Hong Kong at the age of five. Hui attended St. Paul&#x27;s Convent School. She grew up in an old-fashioned Chinese family. Since her grandfather and father both loved classical literature, Hui learned to recite many ancient Chinese poems. When she was in college, Hui worked in the student theater troupe performing as an extra, doing busywork and designing posters. When she had troubles she couldn&#x27;t resolve, she would go to the cinema to watch a movie.

== Education ==
In 1972, Hui earned a master&#x27;s in English and comparative literature from the University of Hong Kong. Hui studied at the London Film School for two years. Hui wrote her thesis on the works of Alain Robbe-Grillet, a French writer and filmmaker.

==Career==
When Hui returned to Hong Kong after her stay in London, she became an assistant to prominent Chinese film director King Hu. She then began working for Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) as a scriptwriter-director and produced documentaries such as &quot;Wonderful&quot;, four episodes of &quot;CID&quot;, two of &quot;Social Worker&quot;, and one of the &quot;Dragon, Tiger, Panther&quot; series. In March 1977 she directed six dramas for the Independent Commission Against Corruption, a Hong Kong organization created to clean up government misconduct. Two of these films were so controversial that they were banned. A year later, Hui directed three episodes of &quot;Below the Lion Rock&quot;, a documentary series about people from Hong Kong, produced by public broadcasting station, Radio Television Hong Kong. The most recognized episode of Hui&#x27;s is &quot;Boy from Vietnam&quot; (1978), which is the start of her Vietnam Trilogy.

In 1979, Hui finally directed her first feature-length film, &quot;The Secret&quot;, which presents images from the gloomy and dreary old Western District, with its worn-out mansions, shadowy alleys, fallen leaves and religious rituals, such as the ceremonial rite of releasing the soul from purgatory by burning paper money and cutting off the head of a chicken. &quot;The Secret&quot; earned Hui a Golden Horse Award for Best Feature Film.

In the 1980s, Hui&#x27;s career was growing internationally. The most popular films of that time were Eastern variations of Hollywood gangster and action films. But Hui did not follow the trend, and instead created more personal films. Many of her best films dealt with cultural displacement. In particular, her central characters are often forced to relocate to another country where they struggle to learn and survive. Hui explores the characters&#x27; reactions to new environments and their responses to their return home. During this &quot;New Wave&quot; period, most of her films are sharp and tough, with satirical and political metaphors, reflecting her concern for people; for women; for orphans devastated by war; and for Vietnamese refugees. Her best known works in this category are &quot;The Story of Woo Viet&quot; (1981) and &quot;Boat People&quot; (1982) – the remaining two parts of her Vietnam Trilogy. &quot;Boat People&quot; won the Hong Kong Film Awards for Best Film and Best Director. Although Hui has directed some generic films, another common theme she works with is family conflict, such as in the 1990 film &quot;My American Grandson&quot;.

Hui&#x27;s concern for regular people, and especially women, became the most common theme in her films. She creates stories of the experiences of women. One of her most personal works is &quot;Song of the Exile&quot; (1990), a semi-autobiographical film about family connections and identity. It depicts the story of a young woman, Cheung Hueyin, returning to Hong Kong for her sister&#x27;s wedding after studying film in London for several years. Hueyin and her mother, who is Japanese, do not seem to have a steady relationship. As the film follows Hueyin&#x27;s journey to her mother&#x27;s home town in Japan, Hueyin and her mother are forced to re-examine their relationship, as both have been uprooted from their own countries. &quot;Its narratives of migration also spoke to the displacement of the Hong Kong people as they left the colony in panic to escape the impending Chinese rule.&quot; The film won both the Hong Kong Film Awards and Golden Horse Award for Best Director. She served as the president of the Hong Kong Film Directors&#x27; Guild in 2004.

In the 1990s, Hui worked on more commercial films. She directed fewer films herself, as she focused on behind-the-scenes work for other filmmakers. The theme of displacement still recurs in her work. During the mid-1990s, Hui started a film project about the Tiananmen Square massacre and the reactions of Hong Kong citizens, but the project was not completed due to lack of funding. Throughout her career, Hui has taken chances to develop more intense and ambitious films while making a name for herself.

Hui said in an interview that she wanted to do more socially conscious projects. She knew the difficulties of finding projects that would do that and &quot;attract investors as well as appeal to the public.&quot; Her goal was to &quot;present something that is watchable and at the same time attractive&quot; and allow the public to analyse the social issues involved. Hui is known for making controversial films; the interview, in particular, described the horrors of increased crime and unemployment rates in Tin Shui Wai, Hong Kong. Two of her films that focus on these issues are &quot;The Way We Are&quot; (2008) and &quot;Night and Fog&quot; (2009), while maintaining a motif of displacement.

The 45th annual Hong Kong International Film Festival was held in April 2021. Hui was one of the six veteran Hong Kong filmmakers who directed Johnnie To Kei-Fung&#x27;s highly anticipated anthology film: &quot;Septet: The Story of Hong Kong&quot; (2020). The other filmmakers were Sammo Hung, Ringo Lam, Patrick Tam Kar-Ming, Tsui Hark, Yuen Woo-ping and Johnnie To. The short films were shot entirely on 35 mm film; each touches on a nostalgic and moving story set across different time periods, with each an ode to the city.

===Vietnam Trilogy===
&quot;Collectively, the three have been named the &#x27;Trilogy of Vietnam&#x27;, as they all focus on problems involving Vietnam. They are about the tragic destinies of displaced individuals seeking a place to which they can belong and who are struggling in a period of changes, leading in the end to failure.&quot;

&quot;Boy from Vietnam&quot; (1978) is the first film of Hui&#x27;s Vietnam Trilogy. It chronicles a teenager&#x27;s illegal entry to Hong Kong and adjustment to life in the city. &quot;As the boy locates his brother, who is already in Hong Kong, moves from a safe house and takes up work, Hui and writers Shu Kei and Wong Chi carefully shed light on the hardships immigrants face in Hong Kong. The new home, it turns out, is no promised land for refugees but more a transit point on a journey elsewhere, and a place where injustice and prejudice are common.&quot; This film is historical: in the late 1970s, a large number of Vietnamese boat people illegally immigrated to Hong Kong. This film describes the experience of those who risked their lives in Hong Kong, and shows the setbacks, discrimination and exploitation they experienced when they were only teens.

In 1981, &quot;The Story of Woo Viet&quot; continued to examine the problem of Vietnamese boat people. Woo Viet, an overseas Chinese from Vietnam, smuggles himself into Hong Kong after trying many times. He gets a pen pal from Hong Kong to help him start over in the United States. However, he is stuck in the Philippines as a hired killer for saving his love. This film describes the hardship of smuggling, the memories of war, the sinister nature of refugee camps, and the crisis in Chinatown.

In 1982, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, having just ended a war with Vietnam, permitted Hui to film on Hainan Island. &quot;Boat People&quot; (1982) set in 1978, after the Communist Party began its rule over Vietnam, through the point of view of a Japanese photojournalist, Shiomi Akutagawa, showed the condition of society and political chaos after the Vietnam War. &quot;Boat People&quot; was the first Hong Kong movie filmed in Communist China. Hui saved a role for Chow Yun-fat, but because at that time Hong Kong actors working in mainland China were banned in Taiwan, Chow Yun-fat declined the role out of fear of being blacklisted. Six months before filming was set to start, and after the film crew was already on location in Hainan, a cameraman suggested that Hui give the role to Andy Lau. At that time, Lau was still a newcomer in the Hong Kong film industry. Hui gave Lau the role and flew him to Hainan before a proper audition or even seeing what he looked like.

===Transition from television to film===
Hui left television in 1979, making her first feature, &quot;The Secret&quot;, a mystery thriller based on a real-life murder case and starring Taiwanese star Sylvia Chang. It was immediately hailed as an important film in the Hong Kong New Wave. &quot;The Spooky Bunch&quot; (1981) was her take on the ghost story genre, while &quot;The Story of Woo Viet&quot; (1981) continued her Vietnam Trilogy. Hui experimented with special effects and daring angles; her preoccupation with sensitive political and social issues is a recurrent feature in most of her subsequent films. &quot;Boat People&quot; (1982), the third part of her Vietnam Trilogy, is the most famous of her early films. It examines the plight of the Vietnamese after the Vietnam War.

In the mid-1980s Hui continued her string of critically acclaimed works. &quot;Love in a Fallen City&quot; (1984) was based on a novella by Eileen Chang, and the two-part, ambitious &quot;wuxia&quot; adaptation of Louis Cha&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Book and the Sword&quot;, was divided into &quot;The Romance of Book and Sword&quot; (1987) and &quot;Princess Fragrance&quot; (1987). In 1990, one of her most important works to date, the semi-autobiographical &quot;The Song of Exile&quot;, was released. The film looks into the loss of identity, disorientation and despair faced by an exiled mother and a daughter faced with clashes in culture and historicity. As in the film, Hui&#x27;s mother was Japanese.

===Post-hiatus work===
After a brief hiatus in which she returned briefly to television, Hui returned with &quot;Summer Snow&quot; (1995), about a middle-aged woman trying to cope with everyday family problems and an Alzheimer&#x27;s-inflicted father-in-law. In 1996, she was a member of the jury at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival.

&quot;Eighteen Springs&quot; (1997) reprises another Eileen Chang novel. Hui&#x27;s &quot;Ordinary Heroes&quot; (1999), about Chinese and Hong Kong political activists from 1970s to the 1990s, won the Best Feature at the Golden Horse Awards.

In 2002, her &quot;July Rhapsody&quot;, the companion film to &quot;Summer Snow&quot; about a middle-aged male teacher facing a mid-life crisis, was released to good reviews in Hong Kong and elsewhere. Her film, &quot;Jade Goddess of Mercy&quot; (2003), starring Zhao Wei and Nicholas Tse, was adapted from a novel from Chinese writer Hai Yan.

In 2008, Hui directed the highly acclaimed domestic drama, &quot;The Way We Are&quot;. In an interview with Esther M. K. Cheung, Hui recalls working on &quot;The Way We Are&quot; being the same as working during her &quot;earlier TVB days&quot;.
&quot;The Way We Are&quot; was followed by &quot;Night and Fog&quot;. &quot;The two films revolve around the mundane lives of the inhabitants of Tin Shui Wai&#x27;s public housing blocks.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Muse&quot; magazine, Hui explains how she sees the two films as about something uniquely Hong Kong: &quot;[on &quot;Night and Fog&quot;] I think that this film can represent something; it can express a kind of feeling about the middle and lower class, and maybe even Hong Kong as a whole. Everyone can eat at McDonald&#x27;s or shop at malls. That&#x27;s a way of life, but spiritually, there&#x27;s dissatisfaction, especially with families on welfare. They don&#x27;t really have any worries about life, but there&#x27;s an unspeakable feeling of depression.

&quot;A Simple Life&quot; (2011) premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival where it was nominated for the Golden Lion. The film centres on the relationship of two characters, Ah Tao (Deanie Ip) and Roger (Andy Lau). It is a tale about a master and his long-time servant and was based on the relationship producer Roger Lee had with his servant. The film was chosen as Hong Kong&#x27;s submission to the Academy Awards but did not make the shortlist. Hui could not afford to film &quot;A Simple Life&quot; until she found Andy Lau. &quot;You make a movie and a lot of people ask you why you do it, and this time I was moved by one person&#x27;s behavior, by the script.&quot; &quot;Because she has always shot a very authentic Hong Kong theme, the reaction on the mainland will not be too special&quot;, said Andy Lau. When Hui reached him, she said something that made him sad: &quot;I haven&#x27;t had enough money for a long time. Can you help me?&quot; Andy Lau said it touched him. &quot;I feel so sad. Sometimes when you make a movie, they say, aren&#x27;t you afraid to lose money? It&#x27;s not the best-selling, it&#x27;s not the most famous, but sometimes you&#x27;re moved, maybe it&#x27;s the action, maybe it&#x27;s the script, and the many little drops add together to make me do it. I work hard to make money every day, so I won&#x27;t be stupid&quot;. He invested 30 million yuan before Yu Dong (president of Bona Film Group Limited) joined. &quot;Both the director and I wanted the film to come out, so we calculated the cost and used it to produce, what I lost was just my salary, just count it as finding someone to play with me for two months.&quot;

Hui&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;The Golden Era&quot; premiered out of competition at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. It was a biopic based on the lives of writers Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun. Tang Wei and Feng Shaofeng starred.

&quot;Our Time Will Come&quot; () is a 2017 war film, starring Zhou Xun, Eddie Peng and Wallace Huo. It revolves around the resistance movement during Japan&#x27;s occupation of Hong Kong. Mark Jenkins writes, &quot;Fictionalized from actual events, the sumptuously photographed drama centers on Lan (Zhou Xun), a teacher before the Japanese closed the local schools. After she helps smuggle out a noted author (Guo Tao), the young woman is recruited by the insurgents&#x27; swashbuckling leader (Eddie Peng). Lan eventually learns that her ex (Wallace Huo Chienhwa) has infiltrated the occupation headquarters, where he discusses classical Chinese verse with a Japanese officer (Masatoshi Nagase, who also portrayed another poetry lover in &#x27;Paterson&#x27;).&quot; The film opened in China on 1 July 2017, to commemorate and to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China.

In 2022, Hui was invited to be the Jury President of the 59th Golden Horse Awards.

In February 2024, Hui served as a jury member at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival.

==Style, themes and legacy==
Hui starts with the female perspective, depicting the hearts of women. Most of her films show daily life of women in Hong Kong and create vivid female images through delicate artistic expression. In her movies, women are independent individuals with their own personality. Her films are always full of a sense of drama, but they do not make the audience feel hopeless. They all have an atmosphere of grief, but without pessimism. In her films, there is no terrible conflict, but she uses a plain method to represent the female world. In her movies, women always feel powerlessness, but not all surrender to fate, and they work hard and strive. Hui&#x27;s feminist films are rich with women&#x27;s emotions and female consciousness, making the audiences feel the struggle and warmth of women&#x27;s lives.

As one of the leading figures of Hong Kong&#x27;s New Wave, Hui has continuously challenged herself and broadened her film career while bringing the audience surprises. This is highlighted in women&#x27;s stories forming her artistic style. As a female, Hui has created female images using a film language which is unique in the Hong Kong film industry.

In addition, Hui&#x27;s works discuss the ideas of race and sex in Asian cultures in a sharp tone. Her semi-autobiography work &quot;Song of the Exile&quot; is one of the examples, showing how a female&#x27;s identity has been strugglingly constructed in such a cultural context. Audrey Yue writes, &quot;When it was released in 1990, the film&#x27;s themes of cross-cultural alienation, inter-ethnic marriage, generational reconciliation and divided loyalties resonated with the British colony&#x27;s 1997 transition to Chinese sovereignty.&quot; This &quot;cunningly metaphoric&quot; is said to be one of the most important features of a Hong Kong director in the last few years.

Of &quot;Song of the Exile&quot;, Audrey Yue writes, &quot;The central motif is the diaspora as the inheritance of exile ... Unlike the term &#x27;exile&#x27; that more specifically refers to the psychological condition of people who have been forcefully removed from the homeland, the concept of &#x27;diaspora&#x27; focuses more on the conditions of displacement (and resettlement) in the hostland. Migration, mobile work contracts, globalization and cosmopolitanism have enabled the formation of a new world of shifting populations or ethnoscapes.&quot;

Hui&#x27;s films reflect diverse female images. Firstly, she creates submissive women, for example, with Sum Ching in &quot;The Story of Woo Viet&quot; (1982), Cam Nuong in &quot;Boat People&quot; (1982), Mang Tit Lan in &quot;Zodiac Killers&quot; (1991), and Ling in &quot;Night and Fog&quot; (2009). Facing the injustice of life, these women will only passively accept the arrangement of fate, and silently endure the hardship of life. Hui gives more attention and sympathy to such women, and such films permeate her deep thinking on female destiny. However, Hui also creates female characters with strong sense of rebellion, such as Bai Liu-Su in &quot;Love in a Fallen City&quot; (1984), May Sun in &quot;Summer Snow&quot; (1995), Gu Manzhen in &quot;Eighteen Springs&quot; (1997), and Xiao Hong in &quot;The Golden Era&quot; (2014). In these films, women are no longer the submissive and cowardly appendages of traditional patriarchy. Instead, they become women who have the courage to fight for their rights.

Ambiguous references to politics are also present. The political dimensions in Hui&#x27;s films are unconscious. According to Ka-Fai Yau, Hui has said in an interview that she does not understand politics and therefore just does not think about it. But this denial of the political seems at odds with her films and how spectators have viewed them.
She also revealed her attitudes on her intention of constructing the stories by reflecting the conditions in social reality:
In an interview with Esther M. K. Cheung, Hui revealed: 

&quot;Hui also uses voice-over as a device to link scenes and shots. This is a hallmark of Hui&#x27;s films. In Hui&#x27;s features, voice-over functions not solely to (1) narrate the plot and (2) bring to the surface the interior thoughts and feelings of the characters, but also (3) to catalyze the connection between shots. In most cases, voice-over is employed to give oral expression to the interior thoughts and feelings of the characters&quot;

The 2021 documentary film &quot;Keep Rolling&quot; provides an insight into her life&#x27;s work. It was directed by Hui&#x27;s frequent collaborator Man Lim-chung in his directorial debut.

<text>&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; is a comic science fiction series created by Douglas Adams that has become popular among fans of the genre and members of the scientific community. Phrases from it are widely recognised and often used in reference to, but outside the context of, the source material. Many writers on popular science, such as Fred Alan Wolf, Paul Davies, and Michio Kaku, have used quotations in their books to illustrate facts about cosmology or philosophy.

== The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42 ==

In the radio series and the first novel, a group of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings demand to learn the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything from the supercomputer Deep Thought, specially built for this purpose. It takes Deep Thought million years to compute and check the answer, which turns out to be 42. Deep Thought points out that the answer seems meaningless because the beings who instructed it never knew what the question was.

When asked to produce the Ultimate Question, Deep Thought says that it cannot; however, it can help to design an even more powerful computer that can. This new computer will incorporate living beings into the &quot;computational matrix&quot; and will run for ten million years. The computer is revealed as being the planet Earth, with its pan-dimensional creators assuming the form of white lab mice to observe its running. The process is hindered after eight million years by the unexpected arrival on Earth of the Golgafrinchans, and is then ruined completely, five minutes prior to completion, when the Earth is destroyed by the Vogons to supposedly make way for a new hyperspace bypass. In &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;, this reason is revealed to have been a ruse: the Vogons had been hired to destroy the Earth by a consortium of psychiatrists, led by Gag Halfrunt, who feared for the loss of their careers when the Ultimate Question became known.

Lacking a real question, the mice (pan-dimensional beings) decide not to go through the whole process again and instead settle for the out-of-thin-air suggestion &quot;How many roads must a man walk down?&quot;, a lyric from Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;.

At the end of the radio series, the television series and , Arthur Dent, having escaped the Earth&#x27;s destruction, potentially has some of the computational matrix in his brain. He attempts to discover The Ultimate Question by extracting it from his brainwave patterns, as abusively suggested by Ford Prefect, when a Scrabble-playing caveman spells out &quot;forty two&quot;. Arthur pulls random letters from a bag, but only gets the sentence &quot;What do you get if you multiply six by ?&quot;
Six times nine is actually fifty-four; the answer is deliberately wrong for that question because the question was miscomputed. The program on the &quot;Earth computer&quot; should have run correctly, but the unexpected arrival of the Golgafrinchans on prehistoric Earth caused input errors into the system—computing the wrong question (because of the garbage in, garbage out rule). Therefore, the question in Arthur&#x27;s subconscious was invalid all along.

Quoting Fit the Seventh of the radio series, on Christmas Eve, 1978:

Some readers who were trying to find a deeper meaning in the passage soon noticed a certain veracity when using base-13; 610 × 910 = 5410, which can be expressed as 4213 (i.e. the decimal expression 54 is encoded as 42 in base-13). The author claimed that it was a mere coincidence.

In &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;, a character named &quot;Prak&quot;, who &quot;knows all that is true,&quot; confirms that 42 is indeed The Answer, and that it is impossible for both The Answer and The Question to be known in the same universe, as they will cancel each other out and take the Universe with them—to be replaced by something even more bizarre (as described in the first theory) and that it may have already happened (as described in the second). Though the question is never found, 42 is the table number at which Arthur and his friends sit when they arrive at Milliways at the end of the radio series. Likewise, &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; ends when Arthur stops at a street address identified by his cry of, &quot;There, number 42!&quot; and enters the club Beta, owned by Stavro Mueller (Stavromula Beta). Shortly after, the Earth is destroyed in all existing incarnations.

=== Reasoning ===

Douglas Adams was asked many times why he chose the number 42. Many theories were proposed, including that 42 is 101010 in base 2, that light refracts through a water surface by 42 degrees to create a rainbow, or that light requires 10−42 seconds to cross the diameter of a proton. Adams rejected them all. On 3 November 1993, he gave this answer on alt.fan.douglas-adams:


Adams described his choice as &quot;a completely ordinary number, a number not just divisible by two but also six and seven. In fact it&#x27;s the sort of number that you could without any fear introduce to your parents.&quot;

While 42 was a number with no hidden meaning, Adams explained in more detail in an interview with Iain Johnstone of BBC Radio 4 (recorded in 1998 though never broadcast) to celebrate the first radio broadcast&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Having decided it should be a number, he tried to think what an &quot;ordinary number&quot; should be. He ruled out non-integers, then he remembered having worked as a &quot;prop-borrower&quot; for John Cleese on his Video Arts training videos. Cleese needed a &quot;funny number&quot; for the punchline to a sketch involving a bank teller (himself) and a customer (Tim Brooke-Taylor). Adams believed that the number that Cleese came up with was 42 and he decided to use it.

Adams had also written a sketch for &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot; called &quot;42 Logical Positivism Avenue&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 12 January 1977 – 14 months before &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; first broadcast &quot;42&quot; in Fit the Fourth, 29 March 1978.

In January 2000, in response to a panellist&#x27;s &quot;Where does the number 42 come from?&quot; on the radio show &quot;Book Club&quot;, Adams explained that he was &quot;on his way to work one morning, whilst still writing the scene, and was thinking about what the actual answer should be. He eventually decided that it should be something that made no sense whatsoever – a number, and a mundane one at that. And that is how he arrived at the number 42, completely at random.&quot;

Stephen Fry, a friend of Adams, claims that Adams told him &quot;exactly why 42&quot;, and that the reason is &quot;fascinating, extraordinary and, when you think hard about it, completely obvious.&quot; However, Fry says that he has vowed not to tell anyone the secret, and that it must go with him to the grave. In an interview at the Sydney Opera House in 2010, two minutes before the end of the show, Fry appears to be ready to reveal the answer, but remains inaudible due to an apparent failure of the microphone. John Lloyd, Adams&#x27; collaborator on &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot; and two &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; fits, said that Adams has called 42 &quot;the funniest of the two-digit numbers.&quot;

The number 42 appears frequently in the work of Lewis Carroll, and some critics have suggested that this was an influence. They note, in particular, that Alice&#x27;s attempt at her times tables (chapter two of the 1865 novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;) breaks down at 4 × 13 answered in base 42, which virtually reverses the failure of &#x27;the Question&#x27; (&quot;What do you get if you multiply six by nine?&quot;), in that the latter would equal &quot;42&quot; if calculated in base 13. They find further evidence of Carroll&#x27;s influence in the fact that Adams entitled the episodes of the original radio series of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; &quot;fits&quot;, the word Carroll used to name the chapters of &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;.

There is the persistent tale that 42 is Adams&#x27; tribute to the indefatigable paperback book, and is the average number of lines on an average page of an average paperback. Another common guess is that 42 refers to the number of laws in cricket, a recurring theme of the books. Yet another possible reason relates to Adam&#x27;s background in the ASCII character encoding, where the number 42 can be represented by an asterisk (*). The asterisk, in turn, essentially represents &quot;input whatever the user would like&quot;. This leaves the symbolic meaning that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is anything you, the user, would like it to be.

=== 42 Puzzle ===
The 42 Puzzle is a game devised by Douglas Adams in 1994 for the United States series of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; books. The puzzle is an illustration consisting of 42 multi-coloured balls, in 7 columns and 6 rows. Douglas Adams has said,

In the puzzle the question is unknown, but the answer is already known to be 42. This is similar to the book where the &quot;Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot; is known but not the question. The puzzle first appeared in &quot;The Illustrated Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. It was later incorporated into the covers of all five reprinted &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; novels in the United States.

Adams has described the puzzle as depicting the number 42 in ten different ways. Six possible questions are:

=== On the Internet and in software ===
The number 42 and its associated phrase, &quot;Life, the universe, and everything&quot;, have attained cult status on the Internet. &quot;Life, the universe, and everything&quot; is a common name for the off-topic section of an Internet forum, and the phrase is invoked in similar ways to mean &quot;anything at all&quot;. Many chatbots, when asked about the meaning of life, will answer &quot;42&quot;. Several online calculators are also programmed with the Question. Google Calculator will give the result to &quot;the answer to life the universe and everything&quot; as 42, as will Wolfram&#x27;s Computational Knowledge Engine. Similarly, DuckDuckGo also gives the result of &quot;the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything&quot; as 42. In the online community &quot;Second Life&quot;, there is a section on a sim called &quot;42nd Life&quot;. It is devoted to this concept in the book series, and several attempts at recreating Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, were made. 

In OpenOffice.org software (prior to version 3.4) if &quot;=ANTWORT(&quot;Das Leben, das Universum und der ganze Rest&quot;) (German for =ANSWER(&quot;life, the universe and everything&quot;)) is typed into any cell of a spreadsheet, the result is 42.

&quot;ISO/IEC 14519-2001/ IEEE Std 1003.5-1999, IEEE Standard for Information Technology – POSIX(R) Ada Language Interfaces – Part 1: Binding for System Application Program Interface (API) &quot;, uses the number 42 as the required return value from a process that terminates due to an unhandled exception. The Rationale says &quot;the choice of the value 42 is arbitrary&quot; and cites the Adams book as the source of the value.

The standard for Tagged Image File Format TIFF defines in its Image File Header bytes 2 and 3 to denominate a &#x27;version number&#x27; 42. In revision 5.0 the specification explained the choice with &quot;This number, 42 (2A in hex), is not to be equated with the current Revision of the TIFF specification. In fact, the TIFF version number (42) has never changed, and probably never will. If it ever does, it means that TIFF has changed in some way so radical that a TIFF reader should give up immediately. The number 42 was chosen for its deep philosophical significance.&quot; The later versions have eliminated the lengthy description, but kept the number fixed at 42 anyway.

The random seed chosen to procedurally create the whole universe of the online multi-player computer game &quot;EVE Online&quot; was chosen as 42 by its lead game designer in 2002.

In the 2001 computer game &quot;Gothic&quot;, &quot;42&quot; is a code that deactivates all activated cheats. After typing &quot;42&quot; in a right place, the text &quot;What was the question?&quot; appears.

The OpenSUSE team decided the next version will be based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop and named &quot;Leap 42&quot;. The number 42 was chosen as a reference to the answer to life, the universe and everything.

The Google 1st generation Chromecast has the model number H2G2-42 referencing Douglas Adams&#x27; book.

=== Cultural references ===
The Allen Telescope Array, a radio telescope used by SETI, has 42 dishes in homage to the Answer.

In the American TV show &quot;Lost&quot;, 42 is the last of the mysterious numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42. In an interview with Lostpedia, producer David Fury confirmed this was a reference to &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot;.

The British TV show &quot;The Kumars at No. 42&quot; is so named because show creator Sanjeev Bhaskar is a &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; fan.

The band Coldplay&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Viva la Vida&quot; includes a song called &quot;42&quot;. When asked by &quot;Q&quot; if the song&#x27;s title was &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot;-related, Chris Martin said, &quot;It is and it isn&#x27;t.&quot;

The band Level 42 chose its name in reference to the book.

The 2007 episode &quot;42&quot; of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was named in reference to the Answer. Writer Chris Chibnall acknowledged that &quot;it&#x27;s a playful title&quot;.

Ken Jennings, defeated along with Brad Rutter in a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; match against IBM&#x27;s Watson, writes that Watson&#x27;s avatar which appeared on-screen for those games showed 42 &quot;threads of thought,&quot; shown as colourful lines spinning around Watson&#x27;s logo, and that the number was chosen in reference to this meme.

The Hitchhiker knitting pattern, designed by Martina Behm, is a scarf with 42 teeth.

In &quot;The Flash&quot;, Season 4, Episode 1, Cisco in trying to decipher what Barry is writing explicitly says that what Barry says might solve answer to the Life, the Universe and Everything, which Caitlin suggests is 42.

In &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Fox Mulder lives in apartment 42. This has been acknowledged by the show&#x27;s creator, Chris Carter, as a reference to &quot;Hitchhikers&quot;.

The number 47 appears often throughout the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. When producer Rick Berman was asked about the unusual frequency of the number, he stated, &quot;47 is 42, corrected for inflation.&quot;

In season 2, episode 4 of &quot;A Discovery of Witches&quot;, an auction lot bearing drawings of the series&#x27; two main leads is numbered 42 and the number&#x27;s connection to Douglas Adams is recognized in a conversation.
== &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot; ==
In the series, &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot; is a phrase on the cover of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. The novel explains that this was partly because the device &quot;looked insanely complicated&quot; to operate, and partly to keep interstellar travellers from panicking. &quot;It is said that despite its many glaring (and occasionally fatal) inaccuracies, the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; itself has outsold the &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot; because it is slightly cheaper, and because it has the words &#x27;DON&#x27;T PANIC&#x27; in large, friendly letters on the cover.&quot;

Arthur C. Clarke said Douglas Adams&#x27; use of &quot;don&#x27;t panic&quot; was perhaps the best advice that could be given to humanity.

British rock band Coldplay&#x27;s debut album &quot;Parachutes&quot; contains a song called &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot; in reference to the series.

On 6 February 2018 SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, carrying Elon Musk&#x27;s Tesla Roadster which had &quot;DON&#x27;T PANIC!&quot; written on the screen on the dashboard as a reference to the series.

== Knowing where one&#x27;s towel is ==

Within the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; universe, towels are regarded as indispensable equipment for experienced travellers, since they can be put to a wide variety of uses. Consequently, a person who can quickly adapt to virtually any new situation is said to know where their towel is. The logic behind this statement is presented in chapter 3 of the first novel in the series thus:

Adams got the idea for this phrase when he went travelling and found that his beach towel kept disappearing. In the 1985 book &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy -The Radio Scripts&quot;, his friends describe how he would always &quot;mislay&quot; his towel. On Towel Day, fans commemorate Adams by carrying towels with them.

== Mostly Harmless ==

The only entry about Earth in the &quot;Guide&quot; used to be &quot;Harmless&quot;, but Ford Prefect managed to change it a little before getting stuck on Earth. &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; provoked a very upset reaction from Arthur when heard. Those two words are not what Ford submitted as a result of his researchmerely all that was left after his editors were done with it. The term is the title of the fifth book in the &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; &quot;trilogy&quot;. Its popularity is such that it has become the definition of Earth in many standard works of sci-fi reference, like &quot;The Star Trek Encyclopedia&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Harmless&quot; and &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; both feature as ranks in the computer game &quot;Elite&quot; and its sequels. Also, in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, there is a rifle that fires (mostly) harmless pellets. In the MMORPG &quot;RuneScape&quot;, there is an island called Mos Le Harmless (Mostly Harmless). Low-scoring players in the multiplayer version of the game &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; and &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; are awarded with the designation &quot;mostly harmless&quot;. In the 2008 edition of the board game &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot;, the human race is given the attribute &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;. In the game &quot;Kerbal Space Program&quot;, there is an atomic rocket motor with the description &quot;mostly harmless&quot;. Another reference is in the book title Mostly Harmless Econometrics.

== Not entirely unlike ==
In chapter 17 of , Arthur Dent tries to get a Nutrimatic drinks dispenser to produce a cup of tea. Instead, it invariably produces a concoction (which most people found unpleasant) that is &quot;almost, but not quite, entirely &quot;unlike&quot; tea&quot;.

One of the primary goals of the player, as Arthur Dent, in , is to thwart the machine and find some decent tea, a mission that the player is constantly reminded of by the inventory item &quot;no tea&quot;. According to the Jargon File, the briefer &quot;not entirely unlike&quot; has entered hacker jargon.

== Share and Enjoy ==

&quot;Share and Enjoy&quot; is the slogan of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints Division. In the radio version, this phrase had its own song (sung in ), which was sung by a choir of robots during &quot;special occasions&quot;. The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation tends to produce inherently faulty goods, which renders the statement ironic since few people would want to &quot;Share and Enjoy&quot; something that was defective. Among the design flaws is the choir of robots that perform this song: they sing a tritone out of tune with the accompaniment. The &quot;Guide&quot; relates that the words &quot;&quot;Share and Enjoy&quot; were displayed in illuminated letters three miles high near the Sirius Cybernetics Complaints Division, until their weight caused them to collapse through the underground offices of many young executives. The upper half of the sign that now protrudes translates in the local tongue as &quot;Go stick your head in a pig&quot;&quot;, and is lit up only for special celebrations.

The episode features a personal computer OS booting sound (à la The Microsoft Sound) set to the tune of &quot;Share and Enjoy&quot;. Furthermore, , the last episode in the adaptation of , features a polyphonic ringtone version of the tune. The &quot;Share and Enjoy&quot; tune also is used in the TV series as the backing for a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robot commercial (slogan: &quot;Your plastic pal who&#x27;s fun to be with!&quot;).

== So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish ==

After mice, the second most intelligent species on Earth were the dolphins. The line was also the title of the fourth book in the trilogy, and appears in that book as a message inscribed on crystal bowls left as parting gifts from the dolphins to selected members of the human race. Its popularity was such that it was the title of the opening song for .

The phrase was spoofed for the 1997 NOFX album &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Shoes&quot;.

The phrase was also spoofed for the All Time Low track &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Booze&quot;, from the appropriately-titled album &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot;.

This is also the title of a track by A Perfect Circle on their 2018 album &quot;Eat the Elephant&quot;. At their concerts this track was dedicated to the people in the crowd who knew where their towels are. Also, the video features flying dolphins in reference to HHGTTG.

In the 2020 video game &quot;Factorio&quot;, there is an achievement titled &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;, which is achieved by launching a raw fish into space.

<text>The mie ( or , ), a powerful and emotional pose struck by an actor, who then freezes for a moment, is a distinctive element of &quot;aragoto&quot; Kabuki performance. &quot;Mie&quot; means &#x27;appearance&#x27; or &#x27;visible&#x27; in Japanese, and one of the primary purposes of this convention is to draw attention to a particularly important or powerful portion of the performance. It is meant to show a character&#x27;s emotions at their peak, and can often be a very powerful pose. The actor&#x27;s eyes are opened as wide as possible; if the character is meant to seem agitated or angry, the actor will cross his eyes. In Japanese, the &quot;mie&quot; pose is said to be &quot;cut&quot; by the actor (, &quot;mie wo kiru&quot;). Audience members will shout out (kakegoe) words of praise and the actor&#x27;s name at specific times before and after the pose is struck.

The practice of &quot;mie&quot; is said to have originated with Ichikawa Danjūrō I in the Genroku era, along with the &quot;aragoto&quot; style itself. There are a great many &quot;mie&quot;, each of which has a name describing it, and many of which are associated with particular lines of actors.

In the Genroku &quot;mie&quot;, one of the most famous or well-known, the actor&#x27;s right hand is held flat, perpendicular to the ground, while his left hand is pointed upwards, elbow bent. At the same time, the actor stamps the floor powerfully with his left foot. This &quot;mie&quot; is most strongly associated with the character Kamakura Gongorō Kagemasa, the hero of the play &quot;Shibaraku&quot;, and is said to have been invented by Ichikawa Danjūrō I.

Two &quot;mie&quot; cut by the priest Narukami, in &quot;Narukami Fudō Kitayama Zakura&quot;, are the &quot;post-wrapping pose&quot; (, &quot;Hashimaki no mie&quot;), in which the actor wraps his arms and legs around a post, column, or long weapon such as a naginata, and the &quot;Fudō no mie&quot; (), which is meant to resemble the Buddhist figure Fudō Myoō, is a very strong pose, meant to evoke anger and power.

In &quot;Kanjinchō&quot;, the monk Benkei cuts the &quot;Fudō no mie&quot; while holding a scroll (the play&#x27;s titular &quot;subscription list&quot; or &quot;kanjinchō&quot;) in one hand and Buddhist prayer beads in the other. Another pose taken by Benkei in this play is the so-called &quot;rock-throwing pose&quot; (, &quot;Ishinage no mie&quot;), which is meant to look like its namesake.

The term &quot;tenchi no mie&quot; (), or &quot;heaven and earth pose,&quot; is used when two actors, one low on the stage and one high above, on a rooftop or other set-piece, strike a pose simultaneously.

<doc id="1063391" wikidata="Q2915412" url="?curid=1063391" title="Public diplomacy of Israel">
<text>The public diplomacy of Israel is Israel&#x27;s efforts to communicate directly with citizens of other nations to inform and influence their perceptions, with the aim of garnering support or tolerance for the Israeli government&#x27;s strategic objectives. Historically, these efforts have evolved from being called &quot;propaganda&quot; by early Zionists (when the term was considered neutral), with Theodor Herzl advocating such activities in 1899, to the more contemporary Hebrew term &quot;hasbara&quot; introduced by Nahum Sokolow, which translates roughly to &quot;explaining&quot;. This communicative strategy seeks to justify actions and is considered reactive and event-driven.

In recent times, Israel has shifted toward calling its efforts &quot;public diplomacy&quot;, indicating a strategic move away from a defensive posture to a more proactive and comprehensive approach. This involves various forms of communication and interaction with foreign publics, including mass communication through social media and traditional media, as well as cultural diplomacy. Key Israeli government bodies involved in public diplomacy include the IDF Spokesperson&#x27;s Unit, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and pro-Israeli civil society organizations.

The history of Israeli public diplomacy dates to the early 20th century, with notable efforts during the pre-statehood period, the establishment of the state, and significant developments in response to changing geopolitical challenges. Methods employed range from traditional media outreach to digital campaigns, with a focus on shaping foreign public opinion, particularly in the United States, and coordinating with diaspora Zionist organizations to promote a favorable narrative of Israel.

== History before 1948 ==
The propaganda wing of the Irgun was a substantial proportion of the organization.

== Terms and types ==
Different terms have been used to describe Israel&#x27;s and other actors&#x27; efforts to reach audiences abroad.

Among early Zionists it was common to label communicative efforts propaganda. Theodor Herzl used the term at the 3rd Zionist Congress in 1899, where he asked fellow Zionists in the audience &quot;to engage in propaganda&quot;. At the time the term &quot;propaganda&quot; was considered neutral. The term is now pejorative. &quot;Propaganda&quot; is now typically used for official government statements or by critics of pro-Israeli advocacy groups to portray the communication as misleading and manipulative.

&quot;Hasbara&quot; was formally introduced to the Zionist vocabulary by Nahum Sokolow. &quot;Hasbara&quot; () has no direct English translation, but roughly means &quot;explaining&quot;. It is a communicative strategy that &quot;seeks to explain actions, whether or not they are justified&quot;. As it focuses on providing explanations about one&#x27;s actions, &quot;hasbara&quot; has been called a &quot;reactive and event-driven approach&quot;. Most early practitioners of what became known as &quot;hasbara&quot; were Arabic-speaking Jews who published papers in Arabic to explain Zionism&#x27;s goals to Arabs. These efforts were led by Arabic-speaking Jews like Nissim Malul, Shimon Moyal, Esther Moyal, Avraham Elmalih, and Yehuda Burla. In 2003, Ron Schleifer called &quot;hasbara&quot; &quot;a positive-sounding synonym for &#x27;propaganda&#x27;&quot;.

Today, Israeli practitioners tend to label their communicative efforts &quot;public diplomacy&quot;, not &quot;hasbara&quot;, indicating a shift in strategy. They consider a focus on &quot;explaining&quot; too defensive and prefer to actively determine the agenda by being less reactive and more proactive, moving to a more comprehensive, long-term strategic approach.

Israeli public diplomacy encompasses different forms of communication and other forms of interaction with the public abroad. For instance, Israel engages in open and fully attributable, unidirectional mass communication that targets so far unaffiliated civil populations in other countries (a form of communication Hirschberger defines as &quot;external communication&quot;), both via social media and traditional mass media. The Israeli government uses this type of communication especially to depict Israel positively (a communication strategy Hirschberger calls &quot;branding&quot;). The Israeli government and pro-Israeli groups also use interventive communication to counter what they see as attempts at delegitimisation of Israel, e.g., in the context of BDS. The Israeli government also engages in activities beyond communicative efforts in social media and the traditional mass media, e.g., in the form of cultural diplomacy. The communicative efforts of pro-Israeli civil society groups are partially also called &quot;advocacy&quot;.

In 2024, the French journalist Alain Gresh gave the following example of &quot;hasbara&quot; in &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;, citing an IDF spokesman:As rockets traced white lines across the night sky on New Year&#x27;s Eve last year Colonel Olivier Rafowicz gave vent to his outrage on the news: &quot;For those wondering why Israel has to eliminate Hamas, here&#x27;s your answer. Hamas terrorists are indiscriminately bombing Israeli cities on the stroke of midnight as we begin the new year. Israel is duty-bound to eliminate this threat once and for all.&quot; There were no reported Israeli casualties, but on 31 December the IDF&#x27;s bombing of Gaza continued uninterrupted, causing up to 300 deaths, just like any other day. A few days later, the total number of &quot;neutralised&quot; Palestinians, at least a third of them children, passed 22,000. Meanwhile on Christmas Eve, Israel&#x27;s airstrike on the Maghazi refugee camp had killed a hundred. About this, Rafowicz said nothing.

== Sources for disseminating information ==
Various branches of the Israeli government as well as pro-Israeli civil society organizations engage in public diplomacy efforts:
* IDF Spokesperson&#x27;s Unit: The spokesperson&#x27;s unit of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) plays a central role in the Israeli government&#x27;s public diplomacy. The IDF&#x27;s English-language Facebook page is one of the most-followed army social media pages worldwide. The unit has become Israel&#x27;s largest spokesperson unit, with more than 400 officers, civilians and soldiers. There is also a reserve unit of almost 1,200 soldiers and officers. As of 2017, the unit has 15 staff members that are responsible only for the IDF&#x27;s social media platforms to reach audiences abroad. As of 2015, the IDF is active on 30 different social media platforms.
* Spokesperson&#x27;s Unit of COGAT: The Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the IDF unit responsible for coordination and liaison with the Palestinian Authority, has a spokesperson&#x27;s unit of its own as well as its own social media channels in English and Arabic.
* Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO): Within the Israel Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, the Government Press Office (GPO), the Public Diplomacy Directorate and the National Information Directorate are involved in public diplomacy efforts. The National Information Directorate is in charge of coordinating &quot;the public diplomacy activities of various governmental bodies in foreign and security affairs, and on socioeconomic issues&quot; (Israel PMO s.a.). The Public Diplomacy Directorate is responsible for communicating the Prime Minister&#x27;s and the government&#x27;s policies and decisions. The directorate is headed by the Prime Minister&#x27;s Media Advisor.
* Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA): The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs also has a Public Diplomacy Directorate. &quot;The directorate consists of the Media and Public Affairs Division, the Division for Cultural Affairs and Scientific Cooperation and the Bureau for Religious Affairs and Relations with the Jewish Diaspora. The Media and Public Affairs Division comprises one department in charge of &#x27;branding&#x27;, a department in charge of collecting information, producing visual media content such as videos and drafting policy papers for briefing Israeli missions all around the world, as well as the spokesperson&#x27;s bureau, which is in charge of the relationship with the press. Furthermore, the division also has an academic department and a small department dealing with issues of civil society affairs, especially the battle against BDS. Finally, the ministry has also a Digital Diplomacy Department, which is in charge of all digital channels of the ministry&quot;.
* Pro-Israeli civil society organizations: Various civil society organizations and initiatives from Israel and abroad support the Israeli public diplomacy efforts. Prominent examples are StandWithUs, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Christians United for Israel (CUFI), the Israel on Campus Coalition, the AMCHA Initiative and &quot;The David Project&quot;.
* Masbirim Israel: In 2010, the Israeli Ministry of Information and Diaspora Affairs launched the PR campaign &quot;Masbirim Israel&quot;. The campaign intended to encourage Israeli citizens to contribute to improving Israel&#x27;s image by talking with their international contacts about the country.

==History==

===1970–1999===
Early mentions of the term &quot;hasbara&quot; in English mainstream print media date from the late 1970s and describe it as &quot;overseas image-building&quot;. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, this work &quot;is called hasbara when the purpose is to reshape public opinion abroad&quot;. In the early 1980s, hasbara was defined as a &quot;public relations campaign&quot;. In &quot;Newsweek&quot; it was described as &quot;explaining&quot;. In 1986, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a program for &quot;communicating defense goals&quot; was started in the late 1970s, and a 1984 implementation of a &quot;Hasbara Project&quot; to &quot;train foreign-service officers in communications by placing them with American companies&quot;. Carl Spielvogel, chairman of Backer &amp; Spielvogel, traveled to Israel to advise the government on communicating its defense goals. The trip led to the Hasbara Project, an internship program established to train foreign-service officers in communications by placing them with American companies.

Shmuel Katz&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, published in 1973, was described as &quot;an encyclopedic source-book for those involved in Israel&#x27;s &quot;hasbara&quot; (public relations) effort&quot; by Moshe Phillips, a national director of Herut North America&#x27;s U.S. section. In 1977, Prime Minister Menachem Begin named Katz &quot;Adviser to the Prime Minister of Information Abroad&quot;.

In May 1992, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that American Jewish leaders hardly reacted to news that the Foreign Ministry&#x27;s hasbara department would be eliminated as part of a sweeping reorganization of the ministry. Malcolm Hoenlein noted there had been talk of streamlining the ministry&#x27;s hasbara functions for some time. He said that merging the hasbara department&#x27;s functions with those of the press department did not portend any downgrading in the priority the Likud government gives to hasbara abroad. Abe Foxman reacted similarly, saying he was &quot;not distressed or disturbed&quot;, and noted that disseminating hasbara has always been the responsibility of every Foreign Ministry staff officer, especially those working abroad; if eliminating one department means everyone will assume greater responsibility for his or her own efforts in distributing hasbara, then he is all in favor. It also reported that personnel in foreign hasbara departments would be shifted to press departments, which is where much of the work currently done by hasbara officials properly belongs. He explained that Israel&#x27;s efforts to provide hasbara abroad would focus on media communications.
===2000–2005===
In 2001, Shmuel Katz published a retrospective of Israeli hasbara efforts and said that hasbara &quot;must be tackled not by occasional sudden sallies but by a separate permanent department in the government.&quot; Sharon did increase hasbara efforts, but did not create a cabinet-level ministry for that purpose.

Also in 2001, the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry, the diplomatic arm of the Government of Israel, was a co-sponsor of the Hasbara Fellowships activities of Aish HaTorah. In May 2007, the Fellowships&#x27; website called for volunteers for a team of Wikipedians to make sure Israel is presented fairly and accurately&quot;.

In 2002, the Israeli State Comptroller&#x27;s office issued a report critical of Israel&#x27;s PR efforts. &quot;A lack of an overall strategic public relations conception and objective&quot; and lack of coordination between the various organizations were mentioned. Funding levels are modest; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spent about US$8.6 million on these efforts in 2002, and the Government Press Office was budgeted at US$100,000.

==== Depictions of children ====
In 2002, during the Second Intifada, the Israeli military used an image of a Palestinian toddler dressed as a suicide bomber as part of its public diplomacy. The photo the IDF provided to international media allegedly showed an 18-month-old child dressed as a suicide bomber. The BBC published the photo but said, &quot;there was no independent confirmation of the authenticity of the photograph&quot;. The IDF claimed to have found the photo in a private family photo album while raiding a suspect&#x27;s home. Dawn News reported that the photo was found in the home of a wanted militant named &quot;Al Khalil&quot;. According to BBC News, the child&#x27;s grandfather, Redwan Abu Turki, said the costume was from a rally at the university and &quot;the picture was taken just for the fun of it&quot;. Israeli newspapers published the photo under headlines such as &quot;Terror in Diapers&quot; and &quot;Born to Kill&quot;. The image was also shown on Israeli television.

A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said, “The photograph of the baby suicide bomber symbolizes the incitement and hatred which the Palestinian leadership have been using to brainwash an entire generation of Palestinian children who have, unfortunately, taken in this message like mother&#x27;s milk”.

Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian negotiator and cabinet minister said, &quot;These are lies that they use to cover their own crimes, the murder of our children … This week alone, six children were killed at the hands of Israeli forces&quot;.

The IDF obtained the photo from a family photo album and only used in it public diplomacy; there was no suggestion that photo had been used in Palestinian media or any other organized public communications by Palestinians. Palestinian officials dismissed it as a propaganda trick, &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that a Palestinian journalist in the Hebron area said she did not believe the picture was fake and expressed surprise at the furor it caused in Israel, saying: &quot;I can find you many, many photos like this. Many kids imitate adults and wear toy masks and guns, especially during marches. It&#x27;s not strange at all&quot;. She added that she had seen children as young as the one in the photograph wearing similar costumes: &quot;In our society it happens a lot. It&#x27;s a kind of phenomenon&quot;.

The BBC report said it was &quot;not uncommon&quot; for Palestinian children to dress as bombers, but did not give other examples. Other photos of Palestinian children dressed up as militants, but not suicide bombers, were published in the same BBC report, including a photo of two boys wearing militant insignia and holding what looked like guns, captioned: &quot;The militants are heroes for many Palestinian children&quot;. Children on both sides of the conflict see combatants from their own side as &quot;heroes&quot; and dress up as them. In 2024 (during the Israel–Hamas war) the most popular Purim costume for children in Israel was an IDF soldier. The Jerusalem Post reported a &quot;trend towards choosing real-life heroes over fictional ones&quot; to dress up as for Purim. The IDF costumes were controversial in the Jewish diaspora. In 2008, the Jewish Agency for Israel&#x27;s Department for Jewish Zionist Education had a webpage titled &quot;Hasbara, Israeli Advocacy, Your Guide to the Middle East Conflict&quot;.
=== 2005 to 2014 ===
In 2008, Yarden Vatikay was appointed to coordinate Israel&#x27;s domestic and foreign media policy.

In 2009, Israel&#x27;s foreign ministry organized volunteers to add pro-Israeli commentary on news websites. In July 2009, it was announced that the Israeli Foreign Ministry would assemble an &quot;internet warfare&quot; squad to spread pro-Israel messages on various websites, with funding of ₪600,000 (about $150,000).

A 2010 report produced for the Israeli cabinet by the Reut Institute and cited by the newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; exemplifies the common Israeli view that &quot;hasbara&quot; efforts are needed to respond to what it describes as a diffuse &quot;delegitimization network&quot; of anti-Israel activists. As &quot;Haaretz&quot; put it, &quot;The network&#x27;s activists—&#x27;delegitimizers&#x27; the report dubs them—are relatively marginal: young people, anarchists, migrants and radical political activists.&quot; The newspaper also cites the report as saying this network promotes pro-Palestinian activities in Europe as &quot;trendy&quot;, and calls for it to be monitored by Israeli intelligence services, and for the cabinet to treat the network as a strategic threat. It concludes that Israel was not prepared to meet the threat this network posed and that a counter-effort must be more vigorously undertaken to respond to it.

Neil Lazarus said in 2012 that what he calls &quot;low budget, grassroots Hasbara 2.0&quot; has come of age, and commends websites that keep track of what supporters see as anti-Israel media bias, and that promote email campaigns on Israel&#x27;s behalf. He observes that &quot;Israel&#x27;s hasbara seems to be becoming more dynamic, as the Diaspora takes responsibility&quot;, and that &quot;Even day schools and MASA programs have been conscripted to the task.&quot;

===2014 to present===

==== Hamas is ISIS and the West is next ====

&quot;&quot; was first asserted by Benjamin Netanyahu near the end of the 2014 Gaza War. Some Israeli journalists criticized and mocked the comparison. Netanyahu was particularly criticised for including real ISIS propaganda in his social media posts promoting the analogy, including photos of James Foley from an ISIS beheading video.

In a 2014 speech at the United Nations, Netanyahu said, &quot;Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas&quot;. In reference to this, the head of the Department of Political Science at Hebron University said it was &quot;dangerous&quot; to conflate Hamas and ISIS. Israeli journalists argued that Hamas resembles the Irgun and Lehi more closely than it does ISIS.

In the first days of the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip in October 2023, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; quoted Netanyahu saying: &quot;They are savages. Hamas is ISIS&quot;. The article then highlighted some alleged similarities in the groups&#x27; influences identified by Harel Chorev of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Tel Aviv University. During the first week of Israeli bombing of Gaza, Netanyahu included this assertion in a public addresses in the United States made alongside Secretary Antony Blinken. Netanyahu said, &quot;Hamas is ISIS, and just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed&quot;. In October 2023, he used the analogy to suggest there was a global coalition resembling that of the War against the Islamic State.

International military experts and mainstream international media pointed out major differences, particularly relating to nationalism, Shia Islam, Christianity, democracy, and destruction of cultural heritage. ISIS wants a purely theocratic system of government without any element of democracy, and violently attacks Christians, whereas Hamas participated in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and the Hamas-led electoral list that won the election included a Palestinian Christian running for the Christian reserved seat in Gaza City. Talal Abu Zarifa, a leader from the DFLP (a secular faction allied with Hamas), said Israel was using the comparison to &quot;justify its annihilation of Palestinian people and bloodshed&quot;. Some commentators pointed out some commonalities, such as that both are on the list of designated terrorist groups in the United States and United Kingdom, but still stressed the groups&#x27; very different ideological goals. Only a few pro-government Israeli sources agreed that Hamas and ISIS are comparable.

ISIS itself has a history of skillful social media use, including hijacking hashtags.

Another hashtag that began to become common in October 2023 is &quot;#TheWestIsNext&quot;, signifying that Hamas&#x27;s enemy is not only the State of Israel, and that Israel is actually fighting to protect the entire Western world. But Hamas is a localized Palestinian nationalist group with distinctly different goals and strategies than those of international terror groups such as ISIS and al-Qaeda. Ukraine used similar rhetoric to win Western support in its fight against Russia. Western support for Ukraine began to waver as the Gaza war began.

==Methods==
An article once on the World Union of Jewish Students website described methods it attributed to Palestinian activists, and offered advice on how to respond. Describing demonstrators as &quot;youths&quot;, for example, creates a different impression from calling them &quot;children&quot;. The article drew attention to the subtle differences of meaning between words such as demonstration and riot, terror organization and Palestinian political organization. It advised against name-calling and point-scoring.

Edward Said wrote in 2001 that hasbara methods used during the Second Intifada included lunches and free trips for influential journalists; seminars for Jewish university students; invitations to congressmen; pamphlets and donation of money for election campaigns; telling photographers and writers what to photograph or write about; lecture and concert tours by prominent Israelis; frequent references to the Holocaust; advertisements in the newspapers attacking Arabs and praising Israel.

In 2007, the Israel Citizens Information Council (ICIC) said its purpose was &quot;to assist efforts to explain Israeli life from the vantage point of the average Israeli citizen. Towards that end, the ICIC enlists Israelis from all walks of life to participate in its various projects ... One of our major activities is the production of special Powerpoint presentations which we post on our website. These presentations review specific aspects and issues related to Israel and the Middle East.&quot;

In 2012, the Israeli Foreign Ministry published new guidelines on the appropriate use of social media methods by its diplomatic staff. There have been multiple instances of embarrassing and inappropriate tweets and posts by Israeli embassies, such as one in Ireland criticizing a Knesset member.

===Shaping foreign public opinion===

Israeli officials have emphasized the importance of molding American public opinion to influence U.S. foreign policy favourably toward Israel. For example, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said, &quot;In the last 30 years, I appeared innumerable times in the American media and met thousands of American leaders. I developed a certain ability to influence public opinion.&quot; Netanyahu made this statement in the context of the Israeli government&#x27;s decade-long effort to pressure for military action against Iran. He added that this &quot;is the most important thing: the ability to sway public opinion in the United States against the regime in Iran.&quot;

====Coordination with diaspora Zionist organizations====

According to &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot; by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, major American Jewish organizations have played a significant role in advancing an Israeli state narrative to the American public. They quote Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, former chair of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, saying &quot;The Presidents&#x27; Conference and its members have been instruments of official governmental Israeli policy. It was seen as our task to receive directions from government circles and to do our best no matter what to affect the Jewish community.&quot; Similarly, they quote Hyman Bookbinder, a high-ranking official of the American Jewish Committee, as saying &quot;Unless something is terribly pressing, really critical or fundamental, you parrot Israel&#x27;s line in order to retain American support. As American Jews, we don&#x27;t go around saying Israel is wrong about its policies.&quot;

According to Shivi Greenfield and Nachman Shai, the Israeli government (particularly the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the former Ministry of Public Diplomacy &amp; Diaspora Affairs, and the Ministry of Tourism) has worked with various Israeli and international non-government organizations to promote Israeli public diplomacy within the global Jewish diaspora and international community. Notable Israeli NGOs involved in public diplomacy have included the Jewish Agency for Israel, Israel Project, HonestReporting, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), and Palestinian Media Watch (PMW). The Israeli government has also partnered with several Jewish and Christian Zionist NGOs in the U.S. and abroad, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), American Jewish Committee (AJC), the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Christians United for Israel (CUFI), the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA), and the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA).

According to Greenfield and Shai, the Israeli government and sympathetic NGOs, including Hillel International, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, Israel at Heart, and StandWithUs, have sought to promote sympathy for Israel among university students through study tours (such as Birthright Israel and Masa Israel, talks, meetings, distributing educational materials, distributing educational materials, gift packages, fundraising, and blood donations. These campus outreaches seek to strengthen ties between Israel and the Jewish diaspora and support efforts by Jewish students to combat so-called &quot;anti-Israel&quot; activism on campus such as Israeli Apartheid Week. Shai identifies the &quot;Israel on Campus Coalition&quot; as the umbrella organization for most pro-Israel American campus organizations. It is funded by the Schusterman Foundation and Hillel.

According to Shahar Burla, the Israeli Foreign and Public Diplomacy ministries worked with local Australian Jewish community and Zionist organizations such as the local chapter of the United Israel Appeal, the Australasian Union of Jewish Students, the Zionist Council of New South Wales and the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies to mobilize Australian Jews into supporting Israeli hasbara efforts during the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid. The Ministry of Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs established a &quot;Communications Room&quot; to circulate pro-Israel information to the global Jewish diaspora. These mobilization efforts via email messages, websites, traditional media, meetings and demonstrations. Pro-Israel sympathizers were encouraged to share pro-Israel videos and articles on social media platforms, respond to blogs and TV shows, and write editorial letters.

<doc id="1063395" wikidata="Q6326670" url="?curid=1063395" title="KCDSA">
<text>KCDSA (Korean Certificate-based Digital Signature Algorithm) is a digital signature algorithm created by a team led by the Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency (KISA). It is an ElGamal variant, similar to the Digital Signature Algorithm and GOST R 34.10-94. The standard algorithm is implemented over formula_1, but an elliptic curve variant (EC-KCDSA) is also specified.

KCDSA requires a collision-resistant cryptographic hash function that can produce a variable-sized output (from 128 to 256 bits, in 32-bit increments). HAS-160, another Korean standard, is the suggested choice.

==Domain parameters==
* formula_2: a large prime such that formula_3 for formula_4.
* formula_5: a prime factor of formula_6 such that formula_7 for formula_8.
* formula_9: a base element of order formula_5 in formula_11.

The revised version of the spec additional requires either that formula_12 be prime or that all of its prime factors are greater than formula_5.

==User parameters==
* formula_14: signer&#x27;s private signature key such that formula_15.
* formula_16: signer&#x27;s public verification key computed by formula_17 where formula_18.
* formula_19: a hash-value of &quot;Cert Data&quot;, i.e., formula_20.

The 1998 spec is unclear about the exact format of the &quot;Cert Data&quot;. In the revised spec, z is defined as being the bottom B bits of the public key y, where B is the block size of the hash function in bits (typically 512 or 1024). The effect is that the first input block corresponds to y mod 2^B.

* formula_19: the lower B bits of y.

==Hash Function==
* formula_22: a collision resistant hash function with |q|-bit digests.

==Signing==

To sign a message formula_23:

* Signer randomly picks an integer formula_24 and computes formula_25
* Then computes the first part: formula_26
* Then computes the second part: formula_27
* If formula_28, the process must be repeated from the start.
* The signature is formula_29

The specification is vague about how the integer formula_30 be reinterpreted as a byte string input to hash function. In the example in section C.1 the interpretation is consistent with formula_31 using the definition of I2OSP from PKCS#1/RFC3447.

==Verifying==

To verify a signature formula_29 on a message formula_23:

* Verifier checks that formula_34 and formula_35 and rejects the signature as invalid if not.
* Verifier computes formula_36
* Verifier checks if formula_37. If so then the signature is valid; otherwise it is not valid.

==EC-KCDSA==

EC-KCDSA is essentially the same algorithm using Elliptic-curve cryptography instead of discrete log cryptography.

The domain parameters are:
* An elliptic curve formula_38 over a finite field. 
* A point formula_39 in formula_38 generating a cyclic subgroup of prime order formula_5. (formula_5 is often denoted formula_43 in other treatments of elliptic-curve cryptography.)

The user parameters and algorithms are essentially the same as for discrete log KCDSA except that modular exponentiation is replaced by point multiplication. The specific differences are:
* The public key is formula_44
* In signature generation, formula_45 where formula_46
* In signature verification, the verifier tests whether formula_47

<text>Craig McNair (born 1975) is a former New Zealand politician. He was a New Zealand First member of parliament from 2002–2005.

==Early years==
Before entering politics, McNair was a marketing manager. He also holds a pilot&#x27;s licence.

==Member of Parliament==

He was elected to Parliament as a list MP in the 2002 election, having been ranked in eighth place on the New Zealand First list. He was his party&#x27;s youth affairs spokesman and was on the finance and expenditure select committee.

In 2002, McNair had a brief relationship with the parliamentary executive secretary for Labour MP Clayton Cosgrove, the secretary was sacked for a conflict of interest, but rehired in the office of the Minister of Conservation.

At the 2005 election he was ranked 11th on the party list. New Zealand First gained enough party votes to elect seven MPs, so McNair missed out on being returned as an MP. After being an MP he worked in real estate in Auckland.

In the 2008 election he stood for Waitakere and was ranked 17th on the New Zealand First list, but he did not win the electorate and the party did not make the threshold of five percent of votes to get any list candidates elected.

<doc id="1063406" wikidata="Q502159" url="?curid=1063406" title="Serology">
<text>Serology is the scientific study of serum and other body fluids. In practice, the term usually refers to the diagnostic identification of antibodies in the serum. Such antibodies are typically formed in response to an infection (against a given microorganism), against other foreign proteins (in response, for example, to a mismatched blood transfusion), or to one&#x27;s own proteins (in instances of autoimmune disease). In either case, the procedure is simple.

==Serological tests==
Serological tests are diagnostic methods that are used to identify antibodies and antigens in a patient&#x27;s sample. Serological tests may be performed to diagnose infections and autoimmune illnesses, to check if a person has immunity to certain diseases, and in many other situations, such as determining an individual&#x27;s blood type. Serological tests may also be used in forensic serology to investigate crime scene evidence. Several methods can be used to detect antibodies and antigens, including ELISA, agglutination, precipitation, complement-fixation, and fluorescent antibodies and more recently chemiluminescence.

===Applications===
====Microbiology====

In microbiology, serologic tests are used to determine if a person has antibodies against a specific pathogen, or to detect antigens associated with a pathogen in a person&#x27;s sample. Serologic tests are especially useful for organisms that are difficult to culture by routine laboratory methods, like &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; (the causative agent of syphilis), or viruses.

The presence of antibodies against a pathogen in a person&#x27;s blood indicates that they have been exposed to that pathogen. Most serologic tests measure one of two types of antibodies: immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG). IgM is produced in high quantities shortly after a person is exposed to the pathogen, and production declines quickly thereafter. IgG is also produced on the first exposure, but not as quickly as IgM. On subsequent exposures, the antibodies produced are primarily IgG, and they remain in circulation for a prolonged period of time.

This affects the interpretation of serology results: a positive result for IgM suggests that a person is currently or recently infected, while a positive result for IgG and negative result for IgM suggests that the person may have been infected or immunized in the past. Antibody testing for infectious diseases is often done in two phases: during the initial illness (acute phase) and after recovery (convalescent phase). The amount of antibody in each specimen (antibody titer) is compared, and a significantly higher amount of IgG in the convalescent specimen suggests infection as opposed to previous exposure. False negative results for antibody testing can occur in people who are immunosuppressed, as they produce lower amounts of antibodies, and in people who receive antimicrobial drugs early in the course of the infection.

====Transfusion medicine====
Blood typing is typically performed using serologic methods. The antigens on a person&#x27;s red blood cells, which determine their blood type, are identified using reagents that contain antibodies, called antisera. When the antibodies bind to red blood cells that express the corresponding antigen, they cause red blood cells to clump together (agglutinate), which can be identified visually. The person&#x27;s blood group antibodies can also be identified by adding plasma to cells that express the corresponding antigen and observing the agglutination reactions.

Other serologic methods used in transfusion medicine include crossmatching and the direct and indirect antiglobulin tests. Crossmatching is performed before a blood transfusion to ensure that the donor blood is compatible. It involves adding the recipient&#x27;s plasma to the donor blood cells and observing for agglutination reactions. The direct antiglobulin test is performed to detect if antibodies are bound to red blood cells inside the person&#x27;s body, which is abnormal and can occur in conditions like autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic disease of the newborn and transfusion reactions. The indirect antiglobulin test is used to screen for antibodies that could cause transfusion reactions and identify certain blood group antigens.
====Immunology====
Serologic tests can help to diagnose autoimmune disorders by identifying abnormal antibodies directed against a person&#x27;s own tissues (autoantibodies). All people have different immunology graphs.

== Serological surveys ==
A 2016 research paper by Metcalf et al., amongst whom were Neil Ferguson and Jeremy Farrar, stated that serological surveys are often used by epidemiologists to determine the prevalence of a disease in a population. Such surveys are sometimes performed by random, anonymous sampling from samples taken for other medical tests or to assess the prevalence of antibodies of a specific organism or protective titre of antibodies in a population. Serological surveys are usually used to quantify the proportion of people or animals in a population positive for a specific antibody or the titre or concentrations of an antibody. These surveys are potentially the most direct and informative technique available to infer the dynamics of a population&#x27;s susceptibility and level of immunity. The authors proposed a World Serology Bank (or serum bank) and foresaw &quot;associated major methodological developments in serological testing, study design, and quantitative analysis, which could drive a step change in our understanding and optimum control of infectious diseases.&quot;

In a helpful reply entitled &quot;Opportunities and challenges of a World Serum Bank&quot;, de Lusignan and Correa observed that the 

In another helpful reply on the World Serum Bank, the Australian researcher Karen Coates declared that:
In April 2020, Justin Trudeau formed the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, whose mandate is to carry out a serological survey in a scheme hatched in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>HAS-160 is a cryptographic hash function designed for use with the Korean KCDSA digital signature algorithm. It is derived from SHA-1, with assorted changes intended to increase its security. It produces a 160-bit output.

HAS-160 is used in the same way as SHA-1. First it divides input in blocks of 512 bits each and pads the final block. A digest function updates the intermediate hash value by processing the input blocks in turn.

The message digest algorithm consists of 80 rounds.

<doc id="1063412" wikidata="Q6929758" url="?curid=1063412" title="Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH">
<text>Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH is a 1971 children&#x27;s science fiction/fantasy book by Robert C. O&#x27;Brien, with illustrations by Zena Bernstein. The novel was published by the Los Angeles publishing house Atheneum Books.

This book was the winner of numerous awards including the 1972 Newbery Medal. Ten years following its publication, the story was adapted for film as &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; (1982).

The novel centers around a colony of escaped lab rats—the rats of NIMH—who live in a technologically sophisticated and literate society mimicking that of humans. They come to the aid of Mrs. Frisby, a widowed field mouse who seeks to protect her children and home from destruction by a farmer&#x27;s plow.

The rats of NIMH were inspired by the research of John B. Calhoun on mouse and rat population dynamics at the National Institute of Mental Health from the 1940s to the 1960s.

After O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s death in 1973, his daughter Jane Leslie Conly wrote two sequels to &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
Mrs. Frisby, a recently widowed mouse, lives with her four children in a cinder block in a field belonging to a farmer named Mr. Fitzgibbon. Her son Timothy falls ill with pneumonia just as the farmer begins planning for spring plowing, which will destroy their home. Normally, the family would move to their summer home to avoid being uprooted, but Timothy is too ill to make the journey. An older mouse named Mr. Ages, who was a friend of Mrs. Frisby&#x27;s late husband Jonathan, gives her some medicine for Timothy. On her way home, she saves the life of a young crow named Jeremy from the farmer&#x27;s cat, Dragon. In return, Jeremy flies Mrs. Frisby to an owl&#x27;s tree so that she can ask for help moving her family. When the owl finds out that Mrs. Frisby is the widow of his old friend Jonathan, he suggests that she seek help from the rats who live in a rosebush on the farm.

Frisby discovers that the rats have a literate and mechanized society. They have technology such as elevators, have tapped into the electrical grid to provide lighting and heating, and have acquired other human skills, such as storing food for the winter. Their leader, Nicodemus, tells Frisby of the rats&#x27; capture by scientists working for a laboratory located at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the experiments that were performed on the rats, which increased the rats&#x27; intelligence to the point of being able to read, write and operate complicated machines, as well as enhancing their longevity and strength. Their increased intelligence and strength allowed them to escape from NIMH and migrate to their present location on the farm. Jonathan and Ages were the only two survivors of a group of eight mice who had been part of the experiments at NIMH and made the rats&#x27; escape possible. 

Out of respect for Jonathan, the rats agree to move Frisby&#x27;s house to a location safe from the plow. Nicodemus also tells Frisby that the rats have recently decided to abandon their lifestyle of dependence on humans, which some rats regard as theft. Instead, the rats aim to live independently. A group of rats, led by one named Jenner, rejected this plan and left the nest at some point before Frisby&#x27;s arrival.

In order for the rats to move the Frisby home, the cat Dragon must be drugged, but the rats are too big to accomplish it. Mrs. Frisby volunteers to go, even though she learns that Jonathan was killed by Dragon while attempting to drug him. She is caught by the farmer&#x27;s son, Billy, who puts her in a birdcage. While captured, Frisby overhears the farmer and his family discussing an incident at a nearby hardware store in which a group of rats was electrocuted after seemingly attempting to steal a small motor. This has attracted the attention of a group of men who have offered to exterminate the rats on the farmer&#x27;s land free of charge. At night, the rat Justin comes to save Frisby and manages to get her out of the cage. The rats manage to move the Frisby house out of the way of the plow using a pulley and scaffolding system.

The successful house move allows the mouse family to remain so that Timothy has time to recover before moving to their summer home. Mrs. Frisby warns the rats of what she learned while captured; they assume that the rats at the hardware store were Jenner&#x27;s group, and that the group of men were from NIMH and are looking for them specifically. To fool the exterminators, the rats get rid of all their human-like technology and make their tunnels under the rosebush look like a normal rats&#x27; nest. As the others move, ten rats stay behind so the exterminators will not think the rat hole has been abandoned. When the exterminators fill the rat hole with poisonous gas, eight of the ten rats manage to escape, while the remaining two die in the hole. Once Timothy recovers, Frisby and her family move to their summer home.

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===
Since its release, &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot; has received widespread praise from scholars, critics of children&#x27;s literature, and children themselves. In 1985, Alethea K Helbig called &quot;Mrs. Frisby&quot; &quot;a combination of science fiction and animal fantasy&quot; that described &quot;fantastic situations with scientific accuracy&quot;. Scholar Paula T. Connolly noted the book for Conly&#x27;s &quot;gradations of moral understanding and culpability&quot; while dealing with &quot;such problematic issues as the roles of science and technology, identity, idealism, family life, forms of community and means of survival&quot;.

In a paper titled &quot;The Critical Reader in Children&#x27;s Metafiction&quot;, literary scholar Joe Sanders wrote that the book&#x27;s emphasis on the rats&#x27; abilities to read mirrors the &quot;growing reading abilities of the novel&#x27;s own target audience&quot;. Sanders argues that the book portrays &quot;the act of reading&quot; as &quot;clearly liberatory&quot;. Reading allows the rats to create a thriving human-like society after escaping from NIMH. Furthermore, reading serves as a gateway for the rats to discover that humans dislike them because they steal. Sanders added that &quot;scientific and philosophical treatises help the rats understand what their role is in the world and that if they are to be anything more than thieves, they must become a self-sustaining community&quot;. In essence, Sanders finds that O&#x27;Brien promotes reading as an empowering tool which is an important lesson that children learn through reading this book.

In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal–winning books from 1966 to 1975, children&#x27;s author John Rowe Townsend wrote: &quot;It seems to me that the fact that all the animals talk and behave intelligently from the beginning of the story detracts from the spectacular development of the laboratory rats... &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot; is a pleasing book, but I find it mildly frustrating; it might have been something more than it is&quot;.

In 2012 it was ranked number 33 on a list of the top 100 children&#x27;s novels published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot; won numerous awards, including the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, the Newbery Medal, and the runner-up National Book Award in 1972; the Mark Twain Award in 1973; the Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Readers&#x27; Choice Award and the William Allan White Children&#x27;s Book Award in 1974.

=== Impact on American views of scientific technology ===
In a 2019 essay, American studies scholar Arahshiel Rose Silver wrote that &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot; &quot;reflect the many scientific and technological anxieties present in 1960s American culture&quot;. During this period, scientific advancements–especially in the field of genetics–increased fears about the pervasiveness of technology in everyday life. A culture of fear began to grow surrounding unethical medical and scientific practices, which are heavily reflected in the book. Silver argued that Conly&#x27;s book lays out an example of technological development ending poorly, giving both children reading the book and their parents a lot to think about.

==Related works==
After the death of O&#x27;Brien, his daughter, Jane Leslie Conly, wrote two other novels based on the rats of NIMH. &quot;Racso and the Rats of NIMH&quot; (1986) tells the story of a city rat who runs away to join the new colony, befriending Timothy, while saving the colony from a flood along the way. In &quot;R-T, Margaret, and the Rats of NIMH&quot; (1990), the rats rescue two lost human children who in turn help to save the colony before winter. Constance Vidor commented that &quot;Conly&#x27;s books continue her father&#x27;s emphasis on the theme of social responsibility while weaving in new characters with more personal problems&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===1982 version===
In 1982, the animated film &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; was released, directed by Don Bluth; it was his first feature film outside of Walt Disney Animation Studios. The film adds a mystical element completely absent from the novel, with Nicodemus portrayed as a wise, bearded old wizard with magic powers and an enchanted amulet, rather than as an equal of the other rats. The character of Jenner is made a villain who is still present with the rats, rather than having left them before the story begins. The crow Jeremy has much greater prominence as comic relief in the film than he has in the book. Additionally, the Frisby family name was changed to &quot;Brisby&quot; to avoid trademark infringement with the Frisbee.

===Live-action/animated reboot===
In 2009, Paramount Pictures set Neil Burger to write the script and Cary Granat to produce the film based on the book. Nothing has materialised since and the rights to the book lapsed.

In 2015, MGM, which had released the 1982 film, acquired the rights to the book to adapt it into a live-action/animated film. Michael Berg was set to adapt it, while Daniel Bobker and Ehren Kruger were attached to produce.

The Russo brothers were set as executive producers of the remake as of April 2019.

=== Television series ===
A television series based on the books was in development at Fox as an event series in September 2021.

<doc id="1063423" wikidata="Q578666" url="?curid=1063423" title="Ictaluridae">
<text>The Ictaluridae, sometimes called ictalurids, are a family of catfish native to North America, where they are an important food source and sometimes fished for sport. The family includes about 51 species, some commonly known as bullheads, madtoms, channel catfish, and blue catfish.

==Taxonomy==
The family Ictaluridae is strongly supported as a monophyletic group. It is closely related to the Asian family Cranoglanididae. These two families are sister taxa in the superfamily Ictaluroidea.

Though the family includes three genera of blind, subterranean, and troglobitic catfishes, &quot;Trogloglanis&quot;, &quot;Satan&quot;, and &quot;Prietella&quot;, none of these three genera is closely related. Instead, &quot;Satan&quot; is closely related to &quot;Pylodictis&quot;, &quot;Prietella&quot; to &quot;Noturus&quot;, and &quot;Trogloglanis&quot; possibly to &quot;Ictalurus&quot;, although it may not be closely related to any of the other ictalurids. &quot;Ameiurus&quot; is sister to a clade formed by &quot;Satan&quot;, &quot;Pylodictis&quot;, &quot;Noturus&quot;, and &quot;Prietella&quot;.

The oldest fossil member of the family is &quot;Astephus&quot; from the Eocene Green River Formation of Utah and Wyoming.

==Distribution and habitat==
Ictalurids originate from North America from southern Canada to Guatemala. Both bullheads and madtoms tend to be found in small streams and ponds, but are also known in larger bodies of water. Channel catfish, bullheads, and madtoms are &quot;bottom feeders&quot; with widely varied diets that include scavenging.

==Notable species==
*Blue catfish &quot;Ictalurus furcatus&quot;
*Tadpole madtom
*Brown bullhead
*Yellow bullhead
*Black bullhead
*Channel catfish
*Widemouth blindcat

==Description==
Ictalurid species have four pairs of barbels (commonly referred to as &quot;whiskers&quot; as applied to catfish). Their skin does not have any scales. The dorsal and pectoral fins usually possess a spine. The dorsal fin usually has six soft rays. The palate is toothless except in the fossil genus &quot;Astephus&quot;. The genera &quot;Trogoglanis&quot;, &quot;Satan&quot;, and &quot;Prietella&quot; include four species of blind catfishes. They have the ability to inflict painful stings with venomous spines embedded in their fins.

One of the largest species is the blue catfish, &quot;Ictalurus furcatus&quot;, specimens of which have been found to weigh over . The maximum length is in the blue catfish and the flathead catfish. The bullheads, though, are small catfish which at maturity often weigh less than 0.5 kg (1 lb), while the madtoms (genus &quot;Noturus&quot;) are in general much smaller.

==Relationship to humans==
The North American catfish has acquired an association with American Southern folklore which exceeds its place as a mere food fish. The image of cane-pole fishing for catfish at a proverbial lazy stream has become a stand-by of southern Americana. 

In some areas, the bullhead is seen as a desirable quarry, for its fighting qualities exceed its size. In other areas, it is seen as a nuisance fish due to its efficient bait-stealing qualities.

<text>In mechanics, the normal force formula_1 is the component of a contact force that is perpendicular to the surface that an object contacts. In this instance &quot;normal&quot; is used in the geometric sense and means perpendicular, as opposed to the meaning &quot;ordinary&quot; or &quot;expected&quot;. A person standing still on a platform is acted upon by gravity, which would pull them down towards the Earth&#x27;s core unless there were a countervailing force from the resistance of the platform&#x27;s molecules, a force which is named the &quot;normal force&quot;.

The normal force is one type of ground reaction force. If the person stands on a slope and does not sink into the ground or slide downhill, the total ground reaction force can be divided into two components: a normal force perpendicular to the ground and a frictional force parallel to the ground. In another common situation, if an object hits a surface with some speed, and the surface can withstand the impact, the normal force provides for a rapid deceleration, which will depend on the flexibility of the surface and the object.

==Equations==
In the case of an object resting upon a flat table (unlike on an incline as in Figures 1 and 2), the normal force on the object is equal but in opposite direction to the gravitational force applied on the object (or the weight of the object), that is, formula_2, where &quot;m&quot; is mass, and &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational field strength (about 9.81 m/s2 on Earth). The normal force here represents the force applied by the table against the object that prevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table be sturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking. However, it is easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction force pairs (a common mistake). In this case, the normal force and weight need to be equal in magnitude to explain why there is no upward acceleration of the object. For example, a ball that bounces upwards accelerates upwards because the normal force acting on the ball is larger in magnitude than the weight of the ball.

Where an object rests on an incline as in Figures 1 and 2, the normal force is perpendicular to the plane the object rests on. Still, the normal force will be as large as necessary to prevent sinking through the surface, presuming the surface is sturdy enough. The strength of the force can be calculated as:
formula_3
where formula_1 is the normal force, &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the object, &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational field strength, and &quot;θ&quot; is the angle of the inclined surface measured from the horizontal.

The normal force is one of the several forces which act on the object. In the simple situations so far considered, the most important other forces acting on it are friction and the force of gravity.

===Using vectors===
In general, the magnitude of the normal force, &quot;N&quot;, is the projection of the net surface interaction force, &quot;T&quot;, in the normal direction, &quot;n&quot;, and so the normal force vector can be found by scaling the normal direction by the net surface interaction force. The surface interaction force, in turn, is equal to the dot product of the unit normal with the Cauchy stress tensor describing the stress state of the surface. That is:
formula_5
or, in indicial notation,
formula_6

The parallel shear component of the contact force is known as the frictional force (formula_7).

The static coefficient of friction for an object on an inclined plane can be calculated as follows:
formula_8
for an object on the point of sliding where formula_9 is the angle between the slope and the horizontal.

==Physical origin==

Normal force is directly a result of Pauli exclusion principle and not a true force &quot;per se&quot;: it is a result of the interactions of the electrons at the surfaces of the objects. The atoms in the two surfaces cannot penetrate one another without a large investment of energy because there is no low energy state for which the electron wavefunctions from the two surfaces overlap; thus no microscopic force is needed to prevent this penetration.
However these interactions are often modeled as van der Waals force, a force that grows very large very quickly as distance becomes smaller.

On the more macroscopic level, such surfaces can be treated as a single object, and two bodies do not penetrate each other due to the stability of matter, which is again a consequence of Pauli exclusion principle, but also of the fundamental forces of nature: cracks in the bodies do not widen due to electromagnetic forces that create the chemical bonds between the atoms; the atoms themselves do not disintegrate because of the electromagnetic forces between the electrons and the nuclei; and the nuclei do not disintegrate due to the nuclear forces.

==Practical applications==
In an elevator either stationary or moving at constant velocity, the normal force on the person&#x27;s feet balances the person&#x27;s weight. In an elevator that is accelerating upward, the normal force is greater than the person&#x27;s ground weight and so the person&#x27;s perceived weight increases (making the person feel heavier). In an elevator that is accelerating downward, the normal force is less than the person&#x27;s ground weight and so a passenger&#x27;s perceived weight decreases. If a passenger were to stand on a weighing scale, such as a conventional bathroom scale, while riding the elevator, the scale will be reading the normal force it delivers to the passenger&#x27;s feet, and will be different than the person&#x27;s ground weight if the elevator cab is &quot;accelerating&quot; up or down. The weighing scale measures normal force (which varies as the elevator cab accelerates), not gravitational force (which does not vary as the cab accelerates).

When we define upward to be the positive direction, constructing Newton&#x27;s second law and solving for the normal force on a passenger yields the following equation:
formula_10

In a gravitron amusement ride, the static friction caused by and perpendicular to the normal force acting on the passengers against the walls results in suspension of the passengers above the floor as the ride rotates. In such a scenario, the walls of the ride apply normal force to the passengers in the direction of the center, which is a result of the centripetal force applied to the passengers as the ride rotates. As a result of the normal force experienced by the passengers, the static friction between the passengers and the walls of the ride counteracts the pull of gravity on the passengers, resulting in suspension above ground of the passengers throughout the duration of the ride.

When we define the center of the ride to be the positive direction, solving for the normal force on a passenger that is suspended above ground yields the following equation:
formula_11
where formula_12 is the normal force on the passenger, formula_13 is the mass of the passenger, formula_14 is the tangential velocity of the passenger and formula_15 is the distance of the passenger from the center of the ride.

With the normal force known, we can solve for the static coefficient of friction needed to maintain a net force of zero in the vertical direction:
formula_16
where formula_17 is the static coefficient of friction, and formula_18 is the gravitational field strength.

<text>The T-schema (&quot;truth schema&quot;, not to be confused with &quot;Convention T&quot;) is used to check if an inductive definition of truth is valid, which lies at the heart of any realisation of Alfred Tarski&#x27;s semantic theory of truth. Some authors refer to it as the &quot;Equivalence Schema&quot;, a synonym introduced by Michael Dummett.

The T-schema is often expressed in natural language, but it can be formalized in many-sorted predicate logic or modal logic; such a formalisation is called a &quot;T-theory.&quot; T-theories form the basis of much fundamental work in philosophical logic, where they are applied in several important controversies in analytic philosophy.

As expressed in semi-natural language (where &#x27;S&#x27; is the name of the sentence abbreviated to S): &#x27;S&#x27; is true if and only if S.

Example: &#x27;snow is white&#x27; is true if and only if snow is white.

==The inductive definition==

By using the schema one can give an inductive definition for the truth of compound sentences. Atomic sentences are assigned truth values disquotationally. For example, the sentence &quot;&#x27;Snow is white&#x27; is true&quot; becomes materially equivalent with the sentence &quot;snow is white&quot;, i.e. &#x27;snow is white&#x27; is true if and only if snow is white. Said again, a sentence of the form &quot;A&quot; is true if and only if A is true. The truth of more complex sentences is defined in terms of the components of the sentence:
* A sentence of the form &quot;A and B&quot; is true if and only if A is true and B is true
* A sentence of the form &quot;A or B&quot; is true if and only if A is true or B is true
* A sentence of the form &quot;if A then B&quot; is true if and only if A is false or B is true; see material implication. 
* A sentence of the form &quot;not A&quot; is true if and only if A is false
* A sentence of the form &quot;for all x, A(&quot;x&quot;)&quot; is true if and only if, for every possible value of &quot;x&quot;, A(&quot;x&quot;) is true. 
* A sentence of the form &quot;for some x, A(&quot;x&quot;)&quot; is true if and only if, for some possible value of &quot;x&quot;, A(&quot;x&quot;) is true.
Predicates for truth that meet all of these criteria are called &quot;satisfaction classes&quot;, a notion often defined with respect to a fixed language (such as the language of Peano arithmetic); these classes are considered acceptable definitions for the notion of truth.

==Natural languages==

Joseph Heath points out that &quot;the analysis of the truth predicate provided by Tarski&#x27;s Schema T is not capable of handling all occurrences of the truth predicate in natural language. In particular, Schema T treats only &quot;freestanding&quot; uses of the predicate—cases when it is applied to complete sentences.&quot; He gives as an &quot;obvious problem&quot; the sentence:
* Everything that Bill believes is true.
Heath argues that analyzing this sentence using T-schema generates the sentence fragment—&quot;everything that Bill believes&quot;—on the righthand side of the logical biconditional.

<doc id="1063439" wikidata="Q515625" url="?curid=1063439" title="Luisa Capetillo">
<text>Luisa Capetillo (October 28, 1879 – April 10, 1922) was one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most famous labor leaders. She was an anarchist writer, activist, labor organizer who fought for workers&#x27; rights, women&#x27;s rights, free love, and human emancipation.

==Early years==
Capetillo was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, to a Spanish father Luis Capetillo Echevarría from the Basque country and Luisa Margarita Perone, a Corsican immigrant. Luis Capetillo arrived in Puerto Rico at around the same time as Margarita, traveling with his family.

In 1898, Capetillo had the first of her two children out of wedlock. She found a job as a reader in a cigar-making factory in Arecibo. After the Spanish–American War, the American Tobacco Company, which had gained control of most of the island&#x27;s tobacco fields, would hire people to read novels and current events to the workers. It was in the tobacco factory that Capetillo had her first contact with labor unions. In 1904, Capetillo began to write essays, titled &quot;Mi Opinión&quot; (My Opinion), about her ideas, which were published in radical and union newspapers.

==Influences==
Luisa Capetillo was greatly influenced by her parents, her environment, her personal experiences and the literature she surrounded herself with. Both of her parents shared many ideals, including those related to Romanticism. Her mother being of French descent, believed women should defend their ideals and act according to themselves. She strongly sided with George Sands&#x27; beliefs that the old liberated woman could be &quot;revolutionary, both politically and in her personal life, opposed to marriage and to all social contracts that would regulate human relations, but willing to sacrifice everything in the name of love&quot;. Margarita reflected these ideals since she lived and procreated with the man she loved at the same time providing for herself. Later on, Luisa would dedicate the following words to her mom: &quot;To you, dear mother of mine, who tried to control me, or make me think traditionally. You allowed me to inquire freely, only reproaching what you thought were exaggerations, without forcing me in any way&quot;. As for her father, Luis, he taught her how to read and write.

Luisa Capetillo also developed her ideals of anarchism and romanticism from the literature she read in her childhood. She read much of French writers like Victor Hugo and Émile Zola and of Russian Romantics like Leo Tolstoy. Through some of these books, she encountered anarchists&#x27; beliefs that &quot;the closer behavior is to being natural, the closer it will be to a just society&quot;. Tolstoy was probably the author that most closely reflected her spiritual beliefs. His legacy inspired her even further as a writer. She wrote a play titled &quot;Influencias de las ideas modernas&quot; (The Influence of Modern Ideas) which clearly was motivated by his philosophies. One of the main characters can be said to be Tolstoy himself. One of the characters says &quot;Well, my friends, don&#x27;t let my ways surprise you. I have read Malatesta, Tolstoy and Zola, so I have understood many things that I couldn&#x27;t before&quot;, which can be interpreted as a reflection of herself.

Even though Luisa was baptized as a child, as an adult she rejected the Catholic Church and even called priests hypocrites. In one of her essays titled &quot;Ensayos Libertarios&quot; (Libertarian Essays), she wrote &quot;don&#x27;t baptize your children. Think about it. If it were so necessary, it would be stupid for there to be millions of human beings who don&#x27;t believe in it&quot;. As a mother, she never baptized her children and in one letter she wrote to her daughter she said &quot; I never taught you to pray, that is something you have to feel. You are not baptized by any religious rite.&quot; She considered organized religion to be a form of prison for humans.

==Beliefs==
She considered herself both an anarchist and spiritual person. In an essay she wrote, titled &quot;¿Anarquista y espiritista?... ¡Uf, uf!&quot; (Anarchist and Spiritis?...Humph!), Luisa opened up on how she considered herself a Christian and an anarchist. Traditionally you&#x27;re either an anarchists or a Christian, but she defended the position that you can be both. She taught her children how to be a good Samaritan without having to follow a particular religion. In a letter she wrote to her daughter she advised her that in order to be considered good, she didn&#x27;t have to attend Mass. Instead, she could visit the poor, feed the hungry and nurse the sick.

==Labor leader and women&#x27;s rights activist==
During a farm workers&#x27; strike in 1905, Capetillo wrote propaganda and organized the workers in the strike. In 1910 she became a reporter for the &quot;FLT&quot; (American Federation of Labor) and traveled throughout Puerto Rico educating and organizing women. Her hometown, Arecibo, became the most unionized area of the country. Additionally, she also started her own newspaper called &quot;La mujer&quot;, which confronted women&#x27;s issues.

Capetillo started a program of reading to the women who worked 12 hour shifts on the shop floor making cigars. It is assumed that is where she developed many of her feminist principles. In 1908, during the &quot;FLT&quot; convention, Capetillo asked the union to approve a policy for women&#x27;s suffrage. She insisted that all women should have the same right to vote as men. Capetillo is considered to be one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s first suffragists.

In 1912, Capetillo traveled to New York City, where she organized Cuban and Puerto Rican tobacco workers. Later on, she went to Tampa, Florida, where she also organized the workers. In Florida, she published the second edition of &quot;Mi Opinión&quot;. She also traveled to Cuba and the Dominican Republic, where she joined the striking workers in their cause.

In July 24, 1915, she challenged the mainstream society by becoming the first woman in Puerto Rico to wear pants in public. Capetillo was sent to jail for what was then considered to be a &quot;crime&quot;, but the judge later dropped the charges against her. She would repeat this act of rebellion again stepping off the boat into Cuba where the judge was not so lenient leading to her serving time. In that same year, along with other labor activists, she helped pass a minimum-wage law in the Puerto Rican Legislature.

In 1916, Capetillo was deported by President Menocal.

==Legacy==

On May 29, 2014, The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored 12 illustrious women with plaques in the &quot;La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorriqueña&quot; (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women) in San Juan. According to the plaques the 12 women, who by virtue of their merits and legacies, stand out in the history of Puerto Rico. Capetillo was among those honored.

<text>Hurlstone Agricultural High School (HAHS, colloquially as Hurlstone Ag) is a government-funded co-educational academically selective and specialist secondary day and boarding school, located in Glenfield, a south-western suburb of Sydney, in the Macarthur region of New South Wales, Australia. HAHS is the oldest government boarding school in New South Wales.

Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School, Yanco Agricultural High School and Hurlstone Agricultural High School are the state&#x27;s only public selective and agricultural schools that also include a co-educational boarding school. The Hurlstone Agricultural campus includes classroom blocks, an operational farm, sporting facilities and student accommodation.

== History ==

Hurlstone was established as a boys-only school in 1907 in Hurlstone Park, approximately ten kilometres south west of Sydney, at the present site of Trinity Grammar School. The original owner of the land was a teacher, John Kinloch, one of the first graduates of the University of Sydney. He named the land &#x27;Hurlstone Estate&#x27;, after his mother&#x27;s maiden name and set up his own school on it in 1878 which he called the Hurlstone School and College.

In those days most students completed their schooling after primary school and students at &#x27;Hurlstone Agricultural Continuation School&#x27; (as it was known at the time) studied there for only two years. In 1926 the school moved to its present site in Glenfield, approximately 42 km south-west of Sydney (between Liverpool and Campbelltown) and adjacent to Glenfield railway station. By then its student numbers had grown from 30 in 1907, to 148. The school supported government policy to promote productivity in the agricultural sector through the training of boys in all aspects of agricultural sciences and farm management.

For a brief period in the early 1940s it was known as &#x27;Macarthur Agricultural High School&#x27; in honour of wool-grower John Macarthur, but it soon reverted to its previous name.

Hurlstone was a boys&#x27; school until 1979, when the decision was made to become co-educational.

In 2008, the New South Wales Government declared 140 hectares of Hurlstone&#x27;s farmland &#x27;surplus&#x27; and proposed the sale of the land, leaving the school with just 20 hectares. The announcement was met with immediate public protest and the formation of a local community group Save Hurlstone Educational and Agricultural Property (SHEAP) eventuating in a government inquiry into the proposed sale and proceeds of the sale. There was further pressure against the plans when the National Trust heritage listed the school in late 2009. The government inquiry resulted in a recommendation of the sale of a small parcel of school land with the proceeds intended to help upgrade school facilities.

On 18 November 2015, there was another proposal to sell the land the school and its farm operated on.

==Principals==

The following individuals have served as principal of the Hurlstone Agricultural High School:
== Population ==

Enrolment at the school is dependent on selective examinations of Year 6 students from across the state. New students coming in later grades have to sit a similar exam.

==Campus==

Hurlstone features a fully functional farm and a commercial dairy. Animals on the farm include: beef and dairy cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, and chickens. Clarke House is a heritage listed building which houses Hurlstone&#x27;s memorabilia museum.

The school also hosts a memorial forest and cairn on Roy Watts Road, past the boarding school. Established in 1950, it is believed to be Australia&#x27;s first living war memorial, with a gum tree dedicated to each of the 600 students from the school who served in WWI and II. Currently, ANZAC and Remembrance Day ceremonies are held at the memorial forest.

As part of the 2008 mini-budget, the New South Wales Government declared 140 hectares of the school to be surplus to educational needs and the land will be sold in 2011. However, due to a strong public protest against this action, an inquiry was led into process of selling approximately seven-eighths of the school. As a result, Mal Peters, the Inquiry Chair, recommended the school&#x27;s agricultural sector to be upgraded in order to reflect current industry practice and standards due to it being an economic, wise and important public investment for the people of NSW as it supplies young scientists with the knowledge for the ever declining, but demanding agricultural sector of the world.

In 2020 a new school called Hurlstone Agricultural High School was to open at Western Sydney University, Hawkesbury. The existing school in Glenfield would be renamed Roy Watts High School (after Hurlstone alumnus Roy Watts) and would remain fully selective but would no longer be an agricultural school. However, this decision was cancelled in December 2019. The farm land would have been converted to a new public school as well as housing and a shopping centre.

<doc id="1063441" wikidata="Q7621147" url="?curid=1063441" title="Strait from the Heart">
<text>Strait from the Heart is the second studio album by American country music artist George Strait, released on June 3, 1982, by MCA Records. The album includes Strait&#x27;s first No. 1 single, &quot;Fool Hearted Memory&quot;, as well as follow-up singles &quot;Marina del Rey&quot;, &quot;Amarillo by Morning&quot; and &quot;A Fire I Can&#x27;t Put Out&quot;, reaching No. 6, No. 4, and No.
1 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart. The album peaked at No. 18 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. &quot;Strait from the Heart&quot; is certified platinum by the RIAA.

There were three cover songs on the album: &quot;Honky Tonk Crazy&quot;, which had been released a couple of months earlier in 1982 by the duo of Gary Stewart and Dean Dillon on their &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; album; 2) the Guy Clark song, &quot;Heartbroke&quot;, which was first recorded by Rodney Crowell on his 1980 album, &quot;But What Will the Neighbors Think&quot;; and 3) &quot;Amarillo by Morning&quot; which was first recorded by Terry Stafford in 1973. &quot;The Only Thing I Have Left&quot; was later recorded by Tim McGraw for his 1993 debut album of the same name.

==Recording==
&quot;Strait from the Heart&quot; was recorded at Music City Music Hall in Nashville, Tennessee. The album was recorded and mixed digitally.

== Musical style and composition ==
&quot;Strait from the Heart&quot; is a neotraditional country, honky-tonk, and countrypolitan album that continues the styles of Strait&#x27;s debut album &quot;Strait Country&quot;. The album also has musical elements of Western swing and country pop.
==Critical reception==

&quot;Strait from the Heart&quot; received positive reviews upon its release in 1982. On the music review website AllMusic, it received five out of five stars. In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek called Strait &quot;a singer of uncommon vitality who could sing honky-tonk, countrypolitan, and the new traditional sounds&quot;. Jurek singled out the depth and breadth of the singer&#x27;s talent, delivering his first number one hit, &quot;Fool Hearted Memory&quot;, a slow two-step, alongside the equally successful ballads &quot;Amarillo by Morning&quot;, &quot;Marina del Rey&quot;, and &quot;A Fire I Can&#x27;t Put Out&quot;, as well as the raw traditional numbers &quot;Honky Tonk Crazy&quot;, &quot;Heartbroke&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t See Texas from Here&quot;, and the barroom anthem &quot;The Steal of the Night&quot;—songs that &quot;offer a portrait of Strait as a man who can do it all&quot;. Jurek concludes:
 In 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album 19 on its 100 Greatest Country Albums of All Time publication.

<doc id="1063454" wikidata="Q1328215" url="?curid=1063454" title="Hypocapnia">
<text>Hypocapnia (from the Greek words meaning &quot;below normal&quot; and &quot;kapnós&quot; meaning &quot;smoke&quot;), also known as hypocarbia, sometimes incorrectly called acapnia, is a state of reduced carbon dioxide in the blood. Hypocapnia usually results from deep or rapid breathing, known as hyperventilation.

Hypocapnia is the opposite of hypercapnia.

Short term hypocapnia does not usually have any adverse effects. It is sometimes used as lifesaving treatment for conditions such as neonatal pulmonary-artery hypertension and for people with severe intracranial hypertension. If the state of hypocapnia persists or is prolonged, adverse outcomes may occur. 

==Effects==
Even when marked, hypocapnia is normally well tolerated. Symptoms include tingling sensation (usually in the limbs), abnormal heartbeat, painful muscle cramps, and seizures. Acute hypocapnia causes hypocapnic alkalosis, which causes cerebral vasoconstriction leading to cerebral hypoxia, and this can cause transient dizziness, fainting, and anxiety. A low partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood also causes alkalosis (because CO2 is acidic in solution), leading to lowered plasma calcium ions (Hypocalcaemia), causing increased nerve and muscle excitability. This explains the other common symptoms of hyperventilation—pins and needles, muscle cramps and tetany in the extremities, especially hands and feet.

Because the brain stem regulates breathing by monitoring the level of blood CO2 instead of O2, hypocapnia can suppress breathing to the point of blackout from cerebral hypoxia, as exhibited in shallow water blackout.

Hypocapnia also results in bronchoconstriction in order to decrease ventilation. This mechanism is meant to counteract hyperventilation, and decrease the amount of oxygen coming into the lungs. The body&#x27;s &quot;goal&quot; is to have a relatively even ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Chemoreceptors in the body sense a change in partial pressures and pH (hydrogen ion concentration) in the blood. Chemoreceptors are responsible for signaling vasoconstriction, vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and bronchodilation.

==Causes==

The main physiologic causes of hypocapnia are related to hyperventilation. Hypocapnia is sometimes induced in the treatment of medical emergencies such as intracranial hypertension and hyperkalemia.

Self-induced hypocapnia through hyperventilation is the basis for the dangerous schoolyard fainting game. Deliberate hyperventilation has been used by underwater breath-hold divers for the purpose of extending dive time as it effectively reduces respiratory drive due to low levels. This allows one to break their standard limit of breath holding, at an increased risk of shallow water blackout (which is a significant cause of drownings). This risk is caused due to air hunger being reduced (due to low blood carbon dioxide levels) but oxygen levels not being increased. In fact hypocapnia reduces the oxygen levels available to the brain due to the elevated affinity of oxygen to hemoglobin (Bohr effect) hence highly increasing the chances of blackout.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Neonatal infants ===
Monitoring the level of carbon dioxide in neonatal infants to ensure that the level is not too high (hypercarbia) or too low is important for improving outcomes for neonates in intensive care. Carbon dioxide can be monitored by taking a blood sample (arterial blood gas), through the breath (exhalation), and it can be measured continuously through the skin by using a minimally invasive transcutaneous device. The most effective and safest approach for measuring carbon dioxide in newborn infants is not clear.

<doc id="1063456" wikidata="Q901775" url="?curid=1063456" title="X-ray spectroscopy">
<text>X-ray spectroscopy is a general term for several spectroscopic techniques for characterization of materials by using x-ray radiation.

==Characteristic X-ray spectroscopy==

When an electron from the inner shell of an atom is excited by the energy of a photon, it moves to a higher energy level. When it returns to the low energy level, the energy it previously gained by excitation is emitted as a photon of one of the wavelengths uniquely characteristic of the element. Analysis of the X-ray emission spectrum produces qualitative results about the elemental composition of the specimen. Comparison of the specimen&#x27;s spectrum with the spectra of samples of known composition produces quantitative results (after some mathematical corrections for absorption, fluorescence and atomic number). 

Atoms can be excited by a high-energy beam of charged particles such as electrons (in an electron microscope for example), protons (see PIXE) or a beam of X-rays (see X-ray fluorescence, or XRF or also recently in transmission XRT). These methods enable elements from the entire periodic table to be analysed, with the exception of H, He and Li.

In electron microscopy an electron beam excites X-rays; there are two main techniques for analysis of spectra of characteristic X-ray radiation: energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS). In X-ray transmission (XRT), the equivalent atomic composition (Zeff) is captured based on photoelectric and Compton effects.

=== Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ===

In an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, a semiconductor detector measures energy of incoming photons. To maintain detector integrity and resolution it should be cooled with liquid nitrogen or by Peltier cooling. EDS is widely employed in electron microscopes (where imaging rather than spectroscopy is a main task) and in cheaper and/or portable XRF units.
=== Wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ===

In a wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, a single crystal diffracts the photons according to Bragg&#x27;s law, which are then collected by a detector. By moving the diffraction crystal and detector relative to each other, a wide region of the spectrum can be observed. To observe a large spectral range, three of four different single crystals may be needed. In contrast to EDS, WDS is a method of sequential spectrum acquisition. While WDS is slower than EDS and more sensitive to the positioning of the sample in the spectrometer, it has superior spectral resolution and sensitivity. WDS is widely used in microprobes (where X-ray microanalysis is the main task) and in XRF; 
it is widely used in the field of X-ray diffraction to calculate various data such as interplanar spacing and wavelength of the incident X-ray using Bragg&#x27;s law.

== X-ray emission spectroscopy ==

The father-and-son scientific team of William Lawrence Bragg and William Henry Bragg, who were 1915 Nobel Prize Winners, were the original pioneers in developing X-ray emission spectroscopy. An example of a spectrometer developed by William Henry Bragg, which was used by both father and son to investigate the structure of crystals, can be seen at the Science Museum, London. Jointly they measured the X-ray wavelengths of many elements to high precision, using high-energy electrons as excitation source. The cathode-ray tube or an x-ray tube was the method used to pass electrons through a crystal of numerous elements. They also painstakingly produced numerous diamond-ruled glass diffraction gratings for their spectrometers. The law of diffraction of a crystal is called Bragg&#x27;s law in their honor.

Intense and wavelength-tunable X-rays are now typically generated with synchrotrons. In a material, the X-rays may suffer an energy loss compared to the incoming beam. This energy loss of the re-emerging beam reflects an internal excitation of the atomic system, an X-ray analogue to the well-known Raman spectroscopy that is widely used in the optical region.

In the X-ray region there is sufficient energy to probe changes in the electronic state (transitions between orbitals; this is in contrast with the optical region, where the energy emitted or absorbed is often due to changes in the state of the rotational or vibrational degrees of freedom of the system&#x27;s atoms and groups of atoms). For instance, in the ultra soft X-ray region (below about 1 keV), crystal field excitations give rise to the energy loss.

The photon-in-photon-out process may be thought of as a scattering event. When the x-ray energy corresponds to the binding energy of a core-level electron, this scattering process is resonantly enhanced by many orders of magnitude. This type of X-ray emission spectroscopy is often referred to as resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS).

Due to the wide separation of orbital energies of the core levels, it is possible to select a certain atom of interest. The small spatial extent of core level orbitals forces the RIXS process to reflect the electronic structure in close vicinity of the chosen atom. Thus, RIXS experiments give valuable information about the local electronic structure of complex systems, and theoretical calculations are relatively simple to perform.

=== Instrumentation ===
There exist several efficient designs for analyzing an X-ray emission spectrum in the ultra soft X-ray region. The figure of merit for such instruments is the spectral throughput, i.e. the product of detected intensity and spectral resolving power. Usually, it is possible to change these parameters within a certain range while keeping their product constant.

==== Grating spectrometers ====
Usually X-ray diffraction in spectrometers is achieved on crystals, but in Grating spectrometers, the X-rays emerging from a sample must pass a source-defining slit, then optical elements (mirrors and/or gratings) disperse them by diffraction according to their wavelength and, finally, a detector is placed at their focal points.

==== Spherical grating mounts ====
Henry Augustus Rowland (1848–1901) devised an instrument that allowed the use of a single optical element that combines diffraction and focusing: a spherical grating. Reflectivity of X-rays is low, regardless of the used material and therefore, grazing incidence upon the grating is necessary. X-ray beams impinging on a smooth surface at a few degrees glancing angle of incidence undergo external total reflection which is taken advantage of to enhance the instrumental efficiency substantially.

Denoted by &quot;R&quot; the radius of a spherical grating. Imagine a circle with half the radius &quot;R&quot; tangent to the center of the grating surface. This small circle is called the Rowland circle. If the entrance slit is anywhere on this circle, then a beam passing the slit and striking the grating will be split into a specularly reflected beam, and beams of all diffraction orders, that come into focus at certain points on the same circle.

==== Plane grating mounts ====
Similar to optical spectrometers, a plane grating spectrometer first needs optics that turns the divergent rays emitted by the x-ray source into a parallel beam. This may be achieved by using a parabolic mirror. The parallel rays emerging from this mirror strike a plane grating (with constant groove distance) at the same angle and are diffracted according to their wavelength. A second parabolic mirror then collects the diffracted rays at a certain angle and creates an image on a detector. A spectrum within a certain wavelength range can be recorded simultaneously by using a two-dimensional position-sensitive detector such as a microchannel photomultiplier plate or an X-ray sensitive CCD chip (film plates are also possible to use).

==== Interferometers ====
Instead of using the concept of multiple beam interference that gratings produce, the two rays may simply interfere. By recording the intensity of two such co-linearly at some fixed point and changing their relative phase one obtains an intensity spectrum as a function of path length difference. One can show that this is equivalent to a Fourier transformed spectrum as a function of frequency. The highest recordable frequency of such a spectrum is dependent on the minimum step size chosen in the scan and the frequency resolution (i.e. how well a certain wave can be defined in terms of its frequency) depends on the maximum path length difference achieved. The latter feature allows a much more compact design for achieving high resolution than for a grating spectrometer because x-ray wavelengths are small compared to attainable path length differences.

==== Early history of X-ray spectroscopy in the U.S. ====
Philips Gloeilampen Fabrieken, headquartered in Eindhoven in the Netherlands, got its start as a manufacturer of light bulbs, but quickly evolved until it is now one of the leading manufacturers of electrical apparatus, electronics, and related products including X-ray equipment. It also has had one of the world&#x27;s largest R&amp;D labs. In 1940, the Netherlands was overrun by Hitler’s Germany. The company was able to transfer a substantial sum of money to a company that it set up as an R&amp;D laboratory in an estate in Irvington on the Hudson in NY. As an extension to their work on light bulbs, the Dutch company had developed a line of X-ray tubes for medical applications that were powered by transformers. These X-ray tubes could also be used in scientific X-ray instrumentations, but there was very little commercial demand for the latter. As a result, management decided to try to develop this market and they set up development groups in their research labs in both Holland and the United States.

They hired Dr. Ira Duffendack, a professor at University of Michigan and a world expert on infrared research to head the lab and to hire a staff. In 1951 he hired Dr. David Miller as Assistant Director of Research. Dr. Miller had done research on X-ray instrumentation at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Duffendack also hired Dr. Bill Parish, a well known researcher in X-ray diffraction, to head up the section of the lab on X-ray instrumental development. X-ray diffraction units were widely used in academic research departments to do crystal analysis. An essential component of a diffraction unit was a very accurate angle measuring device known as a goniometer. Such units were not commercially available, so each investigator had do try to make their own. Dr Parrish decided this would be a good device to use to generate an instrumental market, so his group designed and learned how to manufacture a goniometer. This market developed quickly and, with the readily available tubes and power supplies, a complete diffraction unit was made available and was successfully marketed.

The U.S. management did not want the laboratory to be converted to a manufacturing unit so it decided to set up a commercial unit to further develop the X-ray instrumentation market. In 1953 Norelco Electronics was established in Mount Vernon, NY, dedicated to the sale and support of X-ray instrumentation. It included a sales staff, a manufacturing group, an engineering department and an applications lab. Dr. Miller was transferred from the lab to head up the engineering department. The sales staff sponsored three schools a year, one in Mount Vernon, one in Denver, and one in San Francisco. The week-long school curricula reviewed the basics of X-ray instrumentation and the specific application of Norelco products. The faculty were members of the engineering department and academic consultants. The schools were well attended by academic and industrial R&amp;D scientists. The engineering department was also a new product development group. It added an X-ray spectrograph to the product line very quickly and contributed other related products for the next 8 years.

The applications lab was an essential sales tool. When the spectrograph was introduced as a quick and accurate analytical chemistry device, it was met with widespread skepticism. All research facilities had a chemistry department and analytical analysis was done by “wet chemistry” methods. The idea of doing this analysis by physics instrumentation was considered suspect. To overcome this bias, the salesman would ask a prospective customer for a task the customer was doing by “wet methods”. The task would be given to the applications lab and they would demonstrate how accurately and quickly it could be done using the X-ray units. This proved to be a very strong sales tool, particularly when the results were published in the Norelco Reporter, a technical journal issued monthly by the company with wide distribution to commercial and academic institutions.

An X-ray spectrograph consists of a high voltage power supply (50 kV or 100 kV), a broad band X-ray tube, usually with a tungsten anode and a beryllium window, a specimen holder, an analyzing crystal, a goniometer, and an X-ray detector device. These are arranged as shown in Fig. 1.

The continuous X-spectrum emitted from the tube irradiates the specimen and excites the characteristic spectral X-ray lines in the specimen. Each of the 92 elements emits a characteristic spectrum. Unlike the optical spectrum, the X-ray spectrum is quite simple. The strongest line, usually the Kalpha line, but sometimes the Lalpha line, suffices to identify the element. The existence of a particular line betrays the existence of an element, and the intensity is proportional to the amount of the particular element in the specimen. The characteristic lines are reflected from a crystal, the analyzer, under an angle that is given by the Bragg condition. The crystal samples all the diffraction angles theta by rotation, while the detector rotates over the corresponding angle 2-theta. With a sensitive detector, the X-ray photons are counted individually. By stepping the detectors along the angle, and leaving it in position for a known time, the number of counts at each angular position gives the line intensity. These counts may be plotted on a curve by an appropriate display unit. The characteristic X-rays come out at specific angles, and since the angular position for every X-ray spectral line is known and recorded, it is easy to find the sample&#x27;s composition.

A chart for a scan of a Molybdenum specimen is shown in Fig. 2. The tall peak on the left side is the characteristic alpha line at a two theta of 12 degrees. Second and third order lines also appear.

Since the alpha line is often the only line of interest in many industrial applications, the final device in the Norelco X- ray spectrographic instrument line was the Autrometer. This device could be programmed to automatically read at any desired two theta angle for any desired time interval.

Soon after the Autrometer was introduced, Philips decided to stop marketing X-ray instruments developed in both the U.S. and Europe and settled on offering only the Eindhoven line of instruments.

In 1961, during the development of the Autrometer, Norelco was given a sub-contract from the Jet Propulsion Lab. The Lab was working on the instrument package for the Surveyor spaceship. The composition of the Moon’s surface was of major interest and the use of an X-ray detection instrument was viewed as a possible solution. Working with a power limit of 30 watts was very challenging, and a device was delivered but it wasn’t used. Later NASA developments did lead to an X-ray spectrographic unit that did make the desired moon soil analysis.

The Norelco efforts faded but the use of X-ray spectroscopy in units known as XRF instruments continued to grow. With a boost from NASA, units were finally reduced to handheld size and are seeing widespread use. Units are available from Bruker, Thermo Scientific, Elvatech Ltd. and SPECTRA.

<text>Hooglanderveen () is a village in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is a part of the municipality of Amersfoort, and lies about 4 km northeast of Amersfoort. It is notable for the presence of a large Catholic church.

Formerly, the village of Hooglanderveen was located outside of the city limits of Amersfoort, but the new residential areas of Nieuwland and Vathorst now mean that Hooglanderveen is surrounded by the city from three sides.

It was first mentioned in 1899 as Hooglanderveen, and means moorland of Hoogland. In 1918, a Catholic church was built in Hooglanderveen.

<doc id="1063466" wikidata="Q634405" url="?curid=1063466" title="Paul Aurelian">
<text>Paul Aurelian (known in Breton as Paol Aorelian or Saint Pol de Léon and in Latin as Paulinus Aurelianus) was a 6th-century Welshman who became first bishop of the See of Léon and one of the seven founder saints of Brittany. He allegedly died in 575, rumoured to have lived to the age of 140, after having been assisted in his labors by three successive coadjutors. This suggests that several Pauls have been conflated. Gilbert Hunter Doble thought that he might have been Saint Paulinus of Wales.

== Family ==
According to his hagiographic &quot;Life&quot;, completed in 884 by a Breton monk named Wrmonoc of Landévennec Abbey, Paul was the son of a Welsh chieftain named Perphirius/Porphyrius (&quot;clad in purple&quot;), from Penychen in Glamorgan. He was later given three saintly sister-martyrs; Juthwara, Sidwell and Wulvela.

It was also suggested that he may have been related to Ambrosius Aurelianus, both of them possibly active in Brittany at some points of their lives. Occurring at a time of Saxon raids on the British Isles, it supports the idea of an organized migration of the local Brythonic population under the rules of leaders belonging to the clergy and to the local nobility.

In the &quot;Life of Cadoc&quot; the princely founder of Llancarfan is reckoned the son of Gwynllyw, eponymous founder of the cantref of Gwynllwg and the son of Glywys. Medieval sources give Gwynllyw a brother, called &quot;Pawl&quot;, who is chief of neighbouring Penychen.

== Career ==

Paul first was a pupil of Saint Illtud at Llantwit Major. Later, he studied on Caldey Island with Samson of Dol and Gildas.

He went to Brittany, establishing monasteries in Finistère on the northwest coast of Brittany, at Lampaul on the island of Ushant (French &quot;Ouessant&quot;), on the island of Batz and at Ocsimor, now the city of Saint-Pol-de-Léon, where he is said to have founded a monastery in an abandoned fort. He was consecrated bishop at Ocsimor under the authority of Childebert, King of the Franks.

Paul was a vegetarian. One account says he died on the island of Batz. He was first buried at Saint-Pol-de-Léon, but his relics were later transferred to Fleury Abbey.

He was succeeded as bishop by his companion, Saint Joavan.
Paul&#x27;s bell is kept at Saint-Pol. His feast day is 12 March.

== Paulinus of Wales ==
G. H. Doble thought Saint Paul Aurelian might be the same as Saint Paulinus of Wales, revered in Carmarthenshire, southwest Wales as a hermit and teacher at a place usually identified as Whitland. Hywel David Emanuel considered the identification of Paul Aurelian with the Carmarthenshire Paulinus as doubtful.

In Rhigyfarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of S. David&quot; (chapter x), Saint David is stated to have completed his education under S. Paulinus (Paulens), who is described as a &quot;scribe, a disciple of S. Germanus the bishop&quot;. When Paulinus became blind, David is said to have miraculously restored his sight.

Paulinus of Wales founded churches and chapels around Llandovery. He is said to have taught Saint Teilo and to have nominated David to speak at the Synod of Llanddewi Brefi (in around 545). Claims of having founded the church at Paul are dubious.

A 6th century inscribed stone found at Caeo in Carmarthenshire, now in the Carmarthen Museum, appears to honour him as &quot;preserver of the faith, constant lover of his country, champion of righteousness&quot;. His feast day is 23 November.

==Events==

* The Abu Gharib prison torture scandal took place in 2003 and 2004.

===January===
* January 3 – United Nations arms inspectors from UNMOVIC have established a base of operations in Mosul, 375 kilometers or 200 miles north of Baghdad, to speed the inspection process.
* January 7 – French President Jacques Chirac, in a New Year&#x27;s message to French forces, stated that French forces should be prepare to be activated if the United Nations decides on military action in Iraq.
* January 9 – UN Chief Weapons Inspector Hans Blix and International Atomic Energy Agency head Mohammed El Baradei give a report to the United Nations Security Council. They say that progress on the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is &quot;inching forward&quot; but that a more &quot;pro-active&quot; stance is required from the Iraqi government.
* January 16 – UN weapons inspectors in Iraq stated that they found empty rocket warheads, designed to carry chemical warfare agents, at the Ukhaider Ammunition Storage Area.
* January 18 – A mass mobilization pulls together global protests against the Iraq war in cities around the world, including Tokyo, Moscow, Paris, London, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Cologne, Bonn, Göteborg, Istanbul, and Cairo. NION and ANSWER hold protests in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, California.
* January 20 – As part of the plan to invade Iraq, British defence secretary Geoff Hoon announces that 26,000 British troops and equipment including 120 tanks will be sent to Kuwait, joining the 5,000 troops already on their way there.
* January 23 – 350 Australian troops begin their journey towards Iraq, joining the US and UK troops already assembled there. Prime Minister John Howard said that &quot;pre-positioning troops increased the likelihood of (the crisis) being resolved peacefully&quot;. Around 150 people protested as the troop ship left Sydney, some shouting &quot;Go yourself!&quot; to Mr. Howard.
* January 27 – Speaking to the United Nations Security Council, Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri said that the United States and its allies are &quot;unjustifably aggressive&quot; and that Iraq is complying fully with requests made by the UN weapons inspectors. Speaking to the same forum, Hans Blix, the chief inspector, later said that Iraq had not been fully co-operative with the United Nations inspection teams.
* January 30 – Facing worldwide criticism and against the wishes of the majorities of their own electorates, leaders of Britain, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Poland, Denmark, and the Czech Republic release a statement, the letter of the eight, demonstrating support for the United States&#x27; plans for an invasion of Iraq.

===February===
* February 5 – At the United Nations US Secretary of State Colin Powell presents the US government&#x27;s case against the Saddam Hussein government of Iraq, as part of the diplomatic side of the U.S. plan to invade Iraq. The presentation includes tape recordings, satellite photographs and other intelligence data, and aims to prove WMD production, evasion of weapons inspections and a link to Al-Qaeda.
* February 7 - The chief United Nations arms inspector Hans Blix said Iraq appeared to be making fresh efforts to cooperate with U.N. teams hunting weapons of mass destruction, as Washington said the &quot;momentum is building&quot; for war with Iraq.
* February 8 – Sections of a &#x27;dodgy dossier&#x27; issued by the UK government, which purported to present the latest British intelligence about Iraq, and which had been cited by Tony Blair and Colin Powell as evidence for the need for war, were criticized as plagiarisms. They had been copied without permission from a number of sources including &quot;Jane&#x27;s Intelligence Review&quot; and a 12-year-old doctoral thesis of a Californian student that had been published in the US journal &quot;Middle East Review of International Affairs&quot;. Some sentences were copied word-for-word, and spelling mistakes had been reproduced from the original articles. Downing Street responded by saying that the government had never claimed exclusive authorship and that the information was accurate.
* February 9 – 13% of the 3,300 reservists called by the British Government in preparation for a possible war in Iraq have attempted to avoid being drafted.
* February 10 – France and Belgium broke the NATO procedure of silent approval concerning the timing of protective measures for Turkey in case of a possible war with Iraq. Germany said it supports this veto. The procedure was put into operation on February 6 by secretary general George Robertson. In response Turkey called upon Article 4 of the NATO Treaty, which stipulates that member states must deliberate when asked to do so by another member state if it feels threatened.
* February 12 – An audio tape attributed to Osama bin Laden is released by al Jazeera television. It recounts the battle of Tora Bora and urges Muslims to fight the United States and to overthrow the Iraq regime of Saddam Hussein.
* February 13 – Pre-Iraq invasion
** Austria bars US military units involved in the attack on Iraq from entering into or flying over its territories without a United Nations mandate to attack Iraq.
** United States military officials anonymously confirm to the Washington Post that two Special Forces units have been operating on the ground inside Iraq for over a month, making preliminary preparations for a large-scale invasion.
** A United Nations panel reports that Iraq&#x27;s al-Samoud 2 missiles have a range of 180 km (above the 150 km limit allowed by the UN), splitting opinion over whether they breach UNSCR 1441.
* February 14 – Pre-Iraq invasion
** A very large demonstration was held in Melbourne to protest against the Australian government&#x27;s support for the US&#x27;s policy on Iraq. Organisers estimated that 200,000 people came out on to the streets, while some news sources put the number at &quot;up to 150,000&quot;.
** UNMOVIC chief weapons inspectors Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei presented a report to the United Nations Security Council. They stated that the Iraqis had been co-operating well with the inspectors and that no weapons of mass destruction had been found, but that the Saddam Hussein regime had still to account for many banned weapons believed to have been in his arsenal. Blix also expressed doubts about some of the conclusions in Colin Powell&#x27;s Security Council presentation of February 5, and specifically questioned the significance of some of the photographic evidence that Mr Powell had presented.
** Tariq Aziz of Iraq met with Pope John Paul II.
* February 15 – More than six million people protest in over 600 cities worldwide, the largest war protest to take place before the war occurred.
* February 16 – A missile larger than allowed by UN sanction rules has been found in Iraq.
* February 24 – General Colin Powell states at a meeting in Beijing that &quot;It is time to take action. The evidence is clear ... We are reaching that point where serious consequences must flow.&quot; His speech appears to imply that military action is likely to follow within three weeks, based on previous Pentagon briefings.
* February 25 – Pre-Iraq invasion
** The United States, Britain and Spain present to the UN Security Council a much-anticipated second resolution stating that Iraq &quot;has failed to take the final opportunity&quot; to disarm, but does not include deadlines or an explicit threat of military force. Meanwhile, France, Germany, and Russia offer a counter-proposal calling for peaceful disarmament through further inspections. Sometime reporter Jeff Gannon, actual name James Guckert, signs in at the White House for the first time, according to Secret Service White House access logs obtained through FOIA by Representatives John Conyers (D-MI) and Louise Slaughter (D-NY).
** Both major parties of Kurdistan, an autonomous region in Northern Iraq, vow to fight Turkish troops if they enter Kurdistan to capture Mosul or interfere in Kurdish self-rule. Between them the two parties can mobilize up to 80,000 guerillas – most likely no match for the modern Turkish army, but a severe blow to the unity of U.S. allies on the Northern front expected in the U.S. plan to invade Iraq.
* February 26 – Pre-Iraq invasion

<text>Hydrogen embrittlement (HE), also known as hydrogen-assisted cracking or hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC), is a reduction in the ductility of a metal due to absorbed hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms are small and can permeate solid metals. Once absorbed, hydrogen lowers the stress required for cracks in the metal to initiate and propagate, resulting in embrittlement. Hydrogen embrittlement occurs in steels, as well as in iron, nickel, titanium, cobalt, and their alloys. Copper, aluminium, and stainless steels are less susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement.

The essential facts about the nature of hydrogen embrittlement have been known since the 19th century.
Hydrogen embrittlement is maximised at around room temperature in steels, and most metals are relatively immune to hydrogen embrittlement at temperatures above 150 °C. Hydrogen embrittlement requires the presence of both atomic (&quot;diffusible&quot;) hydrogen and a mechanical stress to induce crack growth, although that stress may be applied or residual. Hydrogen embrittlement increases at lower strain rates. In general, higher-strength steels are more susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement than mid-strength steels.

Metals can be exposed to hydrogen from two types of sources: gaseous dihydrogen and atomic hydrogen chemically generated at the metal surface. Gaseous dihydrogen is molecular hydrogen and does not cause embrittlement, though it can cause a hot hydrogen attack (see below). It is the atomic hydrogen from a chemical attack which causes embrittlement because the atomic hydrogen dissolves quickly into the metal at room temperature. Gaseous dihydrogen is found in pressure vessels and pipelines. Electrochemical sources of hydrogen include acids (as may be encountered during pickling, etching, or cleaning), corrosion (typically due to aqueous corrosion or cathodic protection), and electroplating. Hydrogen can be introduced into the metal during manufacturing by the presence of moisture during welding or while the metal is molten. The most common causes of failure in practice are poorly controlled electroplating or damp welding rods.

Hydrogen embrittlement as a term can be used to refer specifically to the embrittlement that occurs in steels and similar metals at relatively low hydrogen concentrations, or it can be used to encompass all embrittling effects that hydrogen has on metals. These broader embrittling effects include hydride formation, which occurs in titanium and vanadium but not in steels, and hydrogen-induced blistering, which only occurs at high hydrogen concentrations and does not require the presence of stress. However, hydrogen embrittlement is almost always distinguished from high temperature hydrogen attack (HTHA), which occurs in steels at temperatures above 204 °C and involves the formation of methane pockets. The mechanisms (there are many) by which hydrogen causes embrittlement in steels are not comprehensively understood and continue to be explored and studied.

== Mechanisms ==
Hydrogen embrittlement is a complex process involving a number of distinct contributing micro-mechanisms, not all of which need to be present. The mechanisms include the formation of brittle hydrides, the creation of voids that can lead to high-pressure bubbles, enhanced decohesion at internal surfaces and localised plasticity at crack tips that assist in the propagation of cracks. There is a great variety of mechanisms that have been proposed and investigated as to the cause of brittleness once diffusible hydrogen has been dissolved into the metal. In recent years, it has become widely accepted that HE is a complex process dependent on material and environment so that no single mechanism applies exclusively.

* Internal pressure: At high hydrogen concentrations, absorbed hydrogen species recombine in voids to form hydrogen molecules (H2), creating pressure from within the metal. This pressure can increase to levels where cracks form, commonly designated hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC), as well as blisters forming on the specimen surface, designated hydrogen-induced blistering. These effects can reduce ductility and tensile strength.
* Hydrogen enhanced localised plasticity (HELP): Hydrogen increases the nucleation and movement of dislocations at a crack tip. HELP results in crack propagation by localised ductile failure at the crack tip with less deformation occurring in the surrounding material, which gives a brittle appearance to the fracture.
* Hydrogen decreased dislocation emission: Molecular dynamics simulations reveal a ductile-to-brittle transition caused by the suppression of dislocation emission at the crack tip by dissolved hydrogen. This prevents the crack tip rounding-off, so the sharp crack then leads to brittle-cleavage failure.
* Hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE): Interstitial hydrogen lowers the stress required for metal atoms to fracture apart. HEDE can only occur when the local concentration of hydrogen is high, such as due to the increased hydrogen solubility in the tensile stress field at a crack tip, at stress concentrators, or in the tension field of edge dislocations.
* Metal hydride formation: The formation of brittle hydrides with the parent material allows cracks to propagate in a brittle fashion. This is particularly a problem with vanadium alloys, while most other structural alloys do not easily form hydrides.
* Phase transformations: Hydrogen can induce phase transformations in some materials, and the new phase may be less ductile.

== Material susceptibility ==
Hydrogen embrittles a variety of metals including steel, aluminium (at high temperatures only), and titanium. Austempered iron is also susceptible, though austempered steel (and possibly other austempered metals) displays increased resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. NASA has reviewed which metals are susceptible to embrittlement and which only prone to hot hydrogen attack: nickel alloys, austenitic stainless steels, aluminium and alloys, copper (including alloys, e.g. beryllium copper). Sandia has also produced a comprehensive guide.

=== Steels ===

Steel with an ultimate tensile strength of less than 1000 MPa (~145,000 psi) or hardness of less than HRC 32 on the Hardness Rockwell Scale is not generally considered susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. As an example of severe hydrogen embrittlement, the elongation at failure of 17-4PH precipitation hardened stainless steel was measured to drop from 17% to only 1.7% when smooth specimens were exposed to high-pressure hydrogen

As the strength of steels increases, the fracture toughness decreases, so the likelihood that hydrogen embrittlement will lead to fracture increases. In high-strength steels, anything above a hardness of HRC 32 may be susceptible to early hydrogen cracking after plating processes that introduce hydrogen. They may also experience long-term failures any time from weeks to decades after being placed in service due to accumulation of hydrogen over time from cathodic protection and other sources. Numerous failures have been reported in the hardness range from HRC 32-36 and above; therefore, parts in this range should be checked during quality control to ensure they are not susceptible.

Testing the fracture toughness of hydrogen-charged, embrittled specimens is complicated by the need to keep charged specimens very cold, in liquid nitrogen, to prevent the hydrogen diffusing away.

=== Copper ===
Copper alloys which contain oxygen can be embrittled if exposed to hot hydrogen. The hydrogen diffuses through the copper and reacts with inclusions of , forming 2 metallic Cu atoms and , which then forms pressurized bubbles of steam at the grain boundaries. This process can force the grains of the crystal lattice away from each other, in a process known as &quot;steam embrittlement&quot;.

=== Vanadium, nickel, and titanium ===
Alloys of vanadium, nickel, and titanium have a high hydrogen solubility, and can therefore absorb significant amounts of hydrogen. This can lead to hydride formation, resulting in irregular volume expansion and reduced ductility (because metallic hydrides are fragile ceramic materials). This is a particular issue when looking for non-palladium-based alloys for use in hydrogen separation membranes.

== Fatigue ==
While most failures in practice have been through fast failure, there is experimental evidence that hydrogen also affects the fatigue properties of steels. This is entirely expected given the nature of the embrittlement mechanisms proposed for fast fracture. In general hydrogen embrittlement has a strong effect on high-stress, low-cycle fatigue and very little effect on high-cycle fatigue.

== Environmental embrittlement ==
Hydrogen embrittlement is a volume effect: it affects the volume of the material. Environmental embrittlement is a surface effect where molecules from the atmosphere surrounding the material under test are adsorbed onto the fresh crack surface. This is most clearly seen from fatigue measurements where the measured crack growth rates can be an order of magnitude higher in hydrogen than in air. That this effect is due to adsorption, which saturates when the crack surface is completely covered, is understood from the weak dependence of the effect on the pressure of hydrogen.

Environmental embrittlement is also observed to reduce fracture toughness in fast fracture tests, but the severity is much reduced compared with the same effect in fatigue.

Hydrogen embrittlement occurs when a previously embrittled material has low fracture toughness regardless of the atmosphere in which it is tested. Environmental embrittlement occurs when the low fracture toughness is only observed in that atmosphere.

== Sources of hydrogen ==
During manufacture, hydrogen can be dissolved into the component by processes such as phosphating, pickling, electroplating, casting, carbonizing, surface cleaning, electrochemical machining, welding, hot roll forming, and heat treatments.

During service use, hydrogen can be dissolved into the metal from wet corrosion or through misapplication of protection measures such as cathodic protection. In one case of failure during construction of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge galvanized (i.e. zinc-plated) rods were left wet for 5 years before being tensioned. The reaction of the zinc with water introduced hydrogen into the steel.

A common case of embrittlement during manufacture is poor arc welding practice, in which hydrogen is released from moisture, such as in the coating of welding electrodes or from damp welding rods. To avoid atomic hydrogen formation in the high temperature plasma of the arc, welding rods have to be perfectly dried in an oven at the appropriate temperature and duration before use. Another way to minimize the formation of hydrogen is to use special low-hydrogen electrodes for welding high-strength steels.

Apart from arc welding, the most common problems are from chemical or electrochemical processes which, by reduction of hydrogen ions or water, generate hydrogen atoms at the surface, which rapidly dissolve in the metal. One of these chemical reactions involves hydrogen sulfide () in sulfide stress cracking (SSC), a significant problem for the oil and gas industries.

After a manufacturing process or treatment which may cause hydrogen ingress, the component should be baked to remove or immobilize the hydrogen.

== Prevention ==
Hydrogen embrittlement can be prevented through several methods, all of which are centered on minimizing contact between the metal and hydrogen, particularly during fabrication and the electrolysis of water. Embrittling procedures such as acid pickling should be avoided, as should increased contact with elements such as sulfur and phosphate.

If the metal has not yet started to crack, hydrogen embrittlement can be reversed by removing the hydrogen source and causing the hydrogen within the metal to diffuse out through heat treatment. This de-embrittlement process, known as low hydrogen annealing or &quot;baking&quot;, is used to overcome the weaknesses of methods such as electroplating which introduce hydrogen to the metal, but is not always entirely effective because a sufficient time and temperature must be reached. Tests such as ASTM F1624 can be used to rapidly identify the minimum baking time (by testing using careful design of experiments, a relatively low number of samples can be used to pinpoint this value). Then the same test can be used as a quality control check to evaluate if baking was sufficient on a per-batch basis. 
In the case of welding, often pre-heating and post-heating the metal is applied to allow the hydrogen to diffuse out before it can cause any damage. This is specifically done with high-strength steels and low alloy steels such as the chromium/molybdenum/vanadium alloys. Due to the time needed to re-combine hydrogen atoms into the hydrogen molecules, hydrogen cracking due to welding can occur over 24 hours after the welding operation is completed.

Another way of preventing this problem is through materials selection. This will build an inherent resistance to this process and reduce the need for post-processing or constant monitoring for failure. Certain metals or alloys are highly susceptible to this issue, so choosing a material that is minimally affected while retaining the desired properties would also provide an optimal solution. Much research has been done to catalogue the compatibility of certain metals with hydrogen. Tests such as ASTM F1624 can also be used to rank alloys and coatings during materials selection to ensure (for instance) that the threshold of cracking is below the threshold for hydrogen-assisted stress corrosion cracking. Similar tests can also be used during quality control to more effectively qualify materials being produced in a rapid and comparable manner.

=== Surface coatings ===
Coatings act as a barrier between the metal substrate and the surrounding environment, hindering the ingress of hydrogen atoms. Various techniques can be used to apply coatings, such as electroplating, chemical conversion coatings, or organic coatings. The choice of coating depends on factors such as the type of metal, the operating environment, and the specific requirements of the application.

Electroplating is a commonly used method to deposit a protective layer onto the metal surface. This process involves immersing the metal substrate into an electrolyte solution containing metal ions. By applying an electric current, the metal ions are reduced and form a metallic coating on the substrate. Electroplating can provide an excellent protective layer that enhances corrosion resistance and reduces the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement.

Chemical conversion coatings are another effective method for surface protection. These coatings are typically formed through chemical reactions between the metal substrate and a chemical solution. The conversion coating chemically reacts with the metal surface, resulting in a thin, tightly adhering protective layer. Examples of conversion coatings include chromate, phosphate, and oxide coatings. These coatings not only provide a barrier against hydrogen diffusion but also enhance the metal&#x27;s corrosion resistance.

Organic coatings, such as paints or polymer coatings, offer additional protection against hydrogen embrittlement. These coatings form a physical barrier between the metal surface and the environment. They provide excellent adhesion, flexibility, and resistance to environmental factors. Organic coatings can be applied through various methods, including spray coating, dip coating, or powder coating. They can be formulated with additives to further enhance their resistance to hydrogen ingress.

Thermally sprayed coatings offer several advantages in the context of hydrogen embrittlement prevention. The coating materials used in this process are often composed of materials with excellent resistance to hydrogen diffusion, such as ceramics or cermet alloys. These materials have a low permeability to hydrogen, creating a robust barrier against hydrogen ingress into the metal substrate.

== Testing ==
Most analytical methods for hydrogen embrittlement involve evaluating the effects of (1) internal hydrogen from production and/or (2) external sources of hydrogen such as cathodic protection. For steels, it is important to test specimens in the lab that are at least as hard (or harder) as the final parts will be. Ideally, specimens should be made of the final material or the nearest possible representative, as fabrication can have a profound impact on resistance to hydrogen-assisted cracking.

There are numerous ASTM standards for testing for hydrogen embrittlement:

* ASTM B577 is the &quot;Standard Test Methods for Detection of Cuprous Oxide (Hydrogen Embrittlement Susceptibility) in Copper&quot;. The test focuses on hydrogen embrittlement of copper alloys, including a metallographic evaluation (method A), testing in a hydrogen charged chamber followed by metallography (method B), and method C is the same as B but includes a bend test. 
* ASTM B839 is the &quot;Standard Test Method for Residual Embrittlement in Metallic Coated, Externally Threaded Articles, Fasteners, and Rod-Inclined Wedge Method&quot;. 
* ASTM F519 is the &quot;Standard Test Method for Mechanical Hydrogen Embrittlement Evaluation of Plating/Coating Processes and Service Environments&quot;. There are 7 different samples designs and the two most commons tests are (1) the rapid test, the Rising step load testing (RSL) method per ASTM F1624 and (2) the sustained load test, which takes 200 hours. The sustained load test is still included in many legacy standards, but the RSL method is increasingly being adopted due to speed, repeatability, and the quantitative nature of the test. The RSL method provides an accurate ranking of the effect of hydrogen from both internal and external sources. 
* ASTM F1459 is the &quot;Standard Test Method for Determination of the Susceptibility of Metallic Materials to Hydrogen Gas Embrittlement (HGE) Test&quot;. The test uses a diaphragm loaded with a differential pressure. 
* ASTM G142 is the &quot;Standard Test Method for Determination of Susceptibility of Metals to Embrittlement in Hydrogen Containing Environments at High Pressure, High Temperature, or Both&quot;. The test uses a cylindrical tensile specimen tested into an enclosure pressurized with hydrogen or helium.
* ASTM F1624 is the &quot;Standard Test Method for Measurement of Hydrogen Embrittlement Threshold in Steel by the Incremental Step Loading Technique&quot;. The test uses the incremental step loading (ISL) or Rising step load testing (RSL) method for quantitatively testing for the Hydrogen Embrittlement threshold stress for the onset of Hydrogen-Induced Cracking due to platings and coatings from Internal Hydrogen Embrittlement (IHE) and Environmental Hydrogen Embrittlement (EHE). F1624 provides a rapid, quantitative measure of the effects of hydrogen both from internal sources and external sources (which is accomplished by applying a selected voltage in an electrochemical cell). The F1624 test is performed by comparing a standard fast-fracture tensile strength to the fracture strength from a Rising step load testing practice where the load is held for hour(s) at each step. In many cases, it can be performed in 30 hours or less. 
* ASTM F1940 is the &quot;Standard Test Method for Process Control Verification to Prevent Hydrogen Embrittlement in Plated or Coated Fasteners&quot;. While the title now explicitly includes the word fasteners, F1940 was not originally intended for these purposes. F1940 is based on the F1624 method and is similar to F519 but with different root radius and stress concentration factors. When specimens exhibit a threshold cracking of 75% of the net fracture strength, the plating bath is considered to be &#x27;non-embrittling&#x27;.

There are many other related standards for hydrogen embrittlement: 
* NACE TM0284-2003 (NACE International) Resistance to Hydrogen-Induced Cracking
* ISO 11114-4:2005 (ISO)Test methods for selecting metallic materials resistant to hydrogen embrittlement. 
* Standard Test Method for Mechanical Hydrogen Embrittlement Evaluation of Plating/Coating Processes and Service Environments

== Notable failures from hydrogen embrittlement ==
* In 2013, six months prior to opening, the East Span of the Oakland Bay Bridge failed during testing. Catastrophic failures occurred in shear bolts in the span, after only two weeks of service, with the failure attributed to embrittlement (see details above).
* In the City of London, 122 Leadenhall Street, generally known as &#x27;the Cheesegrater&#x27;, suffered from hydrogen embrittlement in steel bolts, with three bolts failing in 2014 and 2015. Most of the 3,000 bolts were replaced at a cost of £6m.

<text>Carl Ludwig &quot;Luz&quot; Long (27 April 1913 – 14 July 1943) was a German Olympic long jumper who won the silver medal in the event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin and had a friendship with Jesse Owens, who won the gold medal in that event.
Luz Long won the German long jump championship six times: in 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939.

Long was killed while serving in the German Army during World War II.

==Early life==
Long was born in Leipzig on 27 April 1913. He studied law at the University of Leipzig, where in 1936 he joined the &quot;Leipziger Sport Club&quot;. After graduating, he practiced as a lawyer in Hamburg while continuing his interest in sport.

==1936 Olympic Games==
The 21-year-old, 1.84-metre-tall (6&#x27;½&quot;) Long had finished third in the 1934 European Championships in Athletics with 7.25 metres (23&#x27;9½&quot;). By the summer of 1936, Long held the European record in the long jump and was eager to compete for the first time against Jesse Owens, the American world-record holder. The long jump on 4 August was Long&#x27;s first event against Owens, and Long met his expectations by setting an Olympic record during the preliminary round. In contrast, Owens fouled on his first two jumps. Knowing that he needed to reach at least 7.15 metres (about 23 feet 5½ inches) on his third jump in order to advance to the finals in the afternoon, Owens sat on the field, dejected.

In the 1966 documentary &quot;Jesse Owens Returns to Berlin&quot;, Owens relates a story that Long came over to offer advice before Owens&#x27;s third jump. According to the story, Long said that Owens should jump from a few inches before the takeoff board. This would reduce the measured distance but avoid the risk of another fault; the theory was that Owens would still clear the required distance even with the handicap of jumping early. However, this conversation is apocryphal; Grantland Rice was watching Owens the entirety of the qualifying round and did not see him speak to Long. Tom Ecker relates that he asked Owens about the story in 1965 and Owens admitted that it was not true, but just a good story. On his third qualifying jump, Owens was calm and jumped with at least four inches (10 centimeters) to spare, easily qualifying for the finals. In the finals competition later that day, the jumpers exceeded the old Olympic record five times.

Owens went on to become Olympic champion in the long jump with 8.06 metres (26&#x27;5¼&quot;) while besting Long&#x27;s own record of 7.87 metres (25&#x27;9¾&quot;). Long won the silver medal for second place and was the first to congratulate Owens: they posed together for photos and walked arm-in-arm to the dressing room. Owens said, &quot;It took a lot of courage for him to befriend me in front of Hitler... I would melt down all the medals and cups I have and they wouldn&#x27;t be a plating on the twenty-four karat friendship that I felt for Luz Long at that moment&quot;.
Long&#x27;s competition with Owens is recorded in Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s documentary &quot;Olympia – Fest der Völker&quot;.

Two days later, Long finished 10th in the triple jump. 

He went on to win the British AAA Championships title in the long jump event at the 1937 AAA Championships and finish third in the 1938 European Championships in Athletics long jump with 7.56 metres (24&#x27;9½&quot;).

==World War II==
Long served in the Wehrmacht during World War II, having the rank of &quot;Obergefreiter&quot;. During the Allied invasion of Sicily in Italy, Long was wounded on 10 July 1943, in the battle for the Biscari-Santo Pietro airfield, and died four days later in a British military hospital. He was buried in the war cemetery of Motta Sant&#x27;Anastasia in Sicily.

There is an urban myth that Long sent a letter to Owens from the battlefield, requesting that Owens visit Long&#x27;s son if Long were to die. Long is supposed to have asked Owens to explain to the boy how life was before people were divided by the war. Such a letter has never been seen by the families of Owens or Long, nor would it be likely that Long could send a letter to the United States while in the German military. Additionally, the letter is often reported as having come from North Africa, a theatre that Long did not serve in.

After the war, Owens travelled to Germany to meet Luz&#x27; son, Kai-Heinrich Long (1941-2021). Kai Long is seen with Owens in the 1966 documentary &quot;Jesse Owens Returns To Berlin&quot;, where he is in conversation with Owens in the Berlin Olympic Stadium.

==Memorials==
Roads near sports facilities in Long&#x27;s home town of Leipzig, and in the Munich Olympia Park of 1972, are named after him. His medal, photos, and documents were donated to the Sportmuseum Leipzig.

==In popular culture==
*In the film &quot;The Jesse Owens Story&quot; (1984), he is portrayed by Kai Wulff.
*In the film &quot;Race&quot; (2016), he is played by David Kross.

<text>The Cadillac Commercial Chassis is a chassis that was built by the Cadillac division of General Motors. Produced from 1931 to 1979, the Commercial Chassis was constructed as an incomplete vehicle intended for use by coachbuilders for final assembly and fitment of bodywork. Produced on the D platform (exclusive to Cadillac) throughout its entire production, the Commercial Chassis was initially derived from the Series 355, shifting to the Series 75 from 1936 onward. Since 1960 they had a longer wheelbase by 16 cm. 

Coinciding with a change in design regulations and the downsizing of Cadillac sedans, the Commercial Chassis was phased out as a distinct product line. The professional car basis would be continued by the Series 75 and successor flagship Cadillac sedans to current production.

==Design overview==
The Cadillac Commercial Chassis is a variant of the GM D-body specifically developed for professional car use; most applications included funeral coaches (hearses), ambulances, and combination cars. In contrast to the Cadillac 75 (a factory-built limousine), the Commercial Chassis was designed with a heavier-duty frame; to improve access to the rear cargo area, the rear frame rails were positioned lower than a standard D-body. 

Produced by Cadillac as an &quot;incomplete vehicle&quot;, the rolling chassis was fitted with no bodywork aft of the dashboard. While fitted with all road controls and front body trim (and air conditioning, if specified), all bodywork from the dashboard rearward was completed by coachbuilders using the chassis as a basis for a completed vehicle; to aid body fabrication, front door shells and rear quarter panels were shipped to the coachbuilders (separate from the chassis). 

Before World War II, the Commercial Chassis used the longest wheelbase of any GM sedan-based vehicle, ranging up to 165 inches in 1940. During the 1950s and 1960s, the chassis used a 156-inch wheelbase, with the 1971-1976 chassis reaching a 157.5-inch length. The powertrain was shared with the Series 75 through its entire production. 

==Discontinuation==
In the early 1970s, federal design regulations forced a shift of the donor chassis from commercial car chassis to cutaway van chassis (and light trucks). Along with wider and taller interiors, design requirements for ambulance bodies effectively forced a change from a wagon-type body to a modular box. While construction of funeral coaches remained unaffected, a low demand for new vehicles coincided with their long service life. 

For 1977, Cadillac downsized its full-size sedan lines, including the D-body chassis; the Series 75 became offered solely as a limousine; the Commercial Chassis followed suit in downsizing. The professional car industry underwent a period of struggle, as multiple firms either closed their doors or were reorganized (such as Superior, Miller-Meteor and Hess &amp; Eisenhardt). The final ambulances of the D-body Commercial Chassis were built in 1979. 

Following the discontinuation of the Cadillac Commercial chassis, the construction of coachbuilt professional cars has remained the same; a rolling chassis is bodied aft of the dashboard. On an official basis, Cadillac has produced &quot;incomplete&quot;-bodied versions of several of its unibody-chassis product lines, including the DeVille, DTS, XTS, and CT6. Additionally, the Cadillac Escalade ESV (based on the Chevrolet Suburban) is used for funeral-coach applications. With the closure of the Oshawa assembly plant and subsequent demise of the Cadillac XTS platform, Cadillac is using the XT5 and XT6 SUV chassis for hearses, starting in 2020.

==Legacy==
The Cadillac Commercial Chassis is perhaps most famous as the basis for the Ecto-1 in the 1984 film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and its sequels, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989), &quot;&quot; (2021), &quot;&quot; (2024).

<text>The Aero Adventure Aventura is a family of ultralight amphibians marketed as a kit aircraft by Aero Adventure of DeLand, Florida. The aircraft was designed by Bob Bailey in 1995.

The aircraft are high-wing flying boats of pusher configuration available in both single and two-seat models. Its design heritage stretches back to the Advanced Aeromarine Buccaneer amphibian ultralights.

==Design==
Introduced in 1995, the single-seat Aventura has repositionable main landing gear, down for runways and up for landing on water. The steerable tail wheel is retractable in concert with the repositioning of the main gear. There is no water rudder. The wing is an aluminium frame covered with pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. The hull is constructed from fibreglass and the wingtip floats are polyethylene. The remainder of the structure is anodized aluminium tubing, bolted together. Controls are conventional three-axis, with full span ailerons and no flaps. The company claims that the fast-build kit can be constructed in 90 hours.

The two-seat Aventura II was introduced in 1996 and is similar to the single seater, but with a wider cabin and hull for two occupants in side-by-side configuration. The two-seater also features flaps to reduce landing speeds. The company claims 130 hours to build the two-seater from the kit.

<doc id="1063480" wikidata="Q2914875" url="?curid=1063480" title="Robertsonian translocation">
<text>Robertsonian translocation (ROB) is a chromosomal abnormality where the entire long arms of two different chromosomes become fused to each other. It is the most common form of chromosomal translocation in humans, affecting 1 out of every 1,000 babies born. It does not usually cause medical problems, though some people may produce gametes with an incorrect number of chromosomes, resulting in a risk of miscarriage. In rare cases this translocation results in Down syndrome and Patau syndrome. Robertsonian translocations result in a reduction in the number of chromosomes. A Robertsonian evolutionary fusion, which may have occurred in the common ancestor of humans and other great apes, is the reason humans have 46 chromosomes while all other primates have 48. Detailed DNA studies of chimpanzee, orangutan, gorilla and bonobo apes has determined that where human chromosome 2 is present in our DNA in all four great apes this is split into two separate chromosomes typically numbered 2a and 2b. Similarly, the fact that horses have 64 chromosomes and donkeys 62, and that they can still have common, albeit usually infertile, offspring, may be due to a Robertsonian evolutionary fusion at some point in the descent of today&#x27;s donkeys from their common ancestor.

== Mechanism ==
All chromosomes in animals have a long arm (known as &quot;q&quot;) and a short arm (known as &quot;p&quot;), separated by a region called the centromere. Robertsonian translocations can only occur between chromosomes which have the centromere very close to one end. This means these chromosomes have a long arm which is particularly long, and a short arm which is particularly short. These are known as acrocentric chromosomes. Humans have five of these acrocentric chromosomes: 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22. When these chromosomes break at their centromeres, the two resulting long arms may fuse. The result is a single, large chromosome with a metacentric centromere. This form of rearrangement is a Robertsonian translocation.

This type of translocation may involve homologous (paired) or non-homologous chromosomes. Owing to the acrocentric nature of the chromosomes involved, the long arms of these chromosomes contain the majority of genetic material contained on the original chromosomes. The short arms also join to form a smaller reciprocal product, which typically contains only nonessential genes also present elsewhere in the genome, and is usually lost within a few cell divisions. This type of translocation is cytologically visible, and can reduce chromosome number (in humans, from 23 to 22). However, the smaller chromosome carries so few essential genes that its loss is usually clinically insignificant.

==Consequences==

In humans, when a Robertsonian translocation joins the long arm of chromosome 21 with the long arm of chromosomes 14 or 15, the heterozygous carrier is phenotypically normal because there are two copies of all major chromosome arms and hence two copies of all essential genes. However, the progeny of this carrier may inherit an unbalanced trisomy 21, causing Down syndrome. 

A Robertsonian translocation in balanced form results in no excess or deficit of genetic material and causes no health difficulties. In unbalanced forms, Robertsonian translocations cause chromosomal deletions or addition and result in syndromes of multiple malformations, including trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) and trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). The most frequent forms of Robertsonian translocations are between chromosomes 13 and 14, 14 and 21, and 14 and 15.

A Robertsonian translocation results when the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes fuse at the centromere and the two short arms are lost. If, for example, the long arms of chromosomes 13 and 14 fuse, no significant genetic material is lost—and the person is completely normal in spite of the translocation. Common Robertsonian translocations are confined to the acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22, because the short arms of these chromosomes encode for rRNA which is present in multiple copies.

Most people with Robertsonian translocations have only 45 chromosomes in each of their cells, yet all essential genetic material is present, and they appear normal. Their children, however, may either be normal, carry the fusion chromosome (depending which chromosome is represented in the gamete), or they may inherit a missing or extra long arm of an acrocentric chromosome (phenotype affected). Genetic counseling and genetic testing is offered to families that may be carriers of chromosomal translocations.

Rarely, the same translocation may be present homozygously if heterozygous parents with the same Robertsonian translocation have children. The result may be viable offspring with 44 chromosomes. Outside of humans, Przewalski&#x27;s horse has 66 chromosomes, while both of domesticated horses and the tarpan have 64 chromosomes and donkeys have 62; it is thought that the difference is due to a Robertsonian translocation.

==Nomenclature==

The International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) is an international standard for human chromosome nomenclature, which includes band names, symbols and abbreviated terms used in the description of human chromosome and chromosome abnormalities. Abbreviations include &quot;rob&quot; for Robertsonian translocations. For example, rob(21;21)(q10;q10) causes Down syndrome.

== Name ==
Robertsonian translocations are named after the American zoologist and cytogeneticist William Rees Brebner Robertson (1881–1941) who first described a Robertsonian translocation in grasshoppers in 1916. They are also called &quot;whole-arm translocations&quot; or &quot;centric-fusion translocations&quot;.

<text>6L6 is the designator for a beam power tube introduced by Radio Corporation of America in April 1936 and marketed for application as a power amplifier for audio frequencies. The 6L6 is a beam tetrode that utilizes formation of a low potential space charge region between the anode and screen grid to return anode secondary emission electrons to the anode and offers significant performance improvements over power pentodes. The 6L6 was the first successful beam power tube marketed. In the 21st century, variants of the 6L6 are manufactured and used in some high fidelity audio amplifiers and musical instrument amplifiers. 

== History ==
In the UK, three engineers at EMI (Isaac Shoenberg, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda) had developed and filed patents in 1933 and 1934 on an output tetrode that utilized novel electrode structures to form electron beams to create a dense space charge region between the anode and screen grid to return anode secondary electrons to the anode. The new tube offered improved performance compared to a similar power pentode and was introduced at the Physical and Optical Societies&#x27; Exhibition in January 1935 as the Marconi N40. Around one thousand of the N40 output tetrodes were produced, but MOV (Marconi-Osram Valve) company, under the joint ownership of EMI and GEC, considered the design too difficult to manufacture due to the need for good alignment of the grid wires. As MOV had a design-share agreement with RCA of America, the design was passed to that company.

The metal tube technology utilized for the 6L6 had been developed by General Electric and introduced in April 1935, with RCA manufacturing the metal envelope tubes for GE at that time. Some of the advantages of metal tube construction over glass envelope tubes were smaller size, ruggedness, electromagnetic shielding and smaller interelectrode capacitance. The 6L6 incorporated an octal base, which had been introduced with the GE metal tubes. The 6L6 was rated for 3.5 watts screen power dissipation and 24 watts combined plate and screen dissipation. The 6L6 and variants of it became popular for use in public address amplifiers, musical instrument amplifiers, radio frequency applications and audio stages of radio transmitters. The 6L6 family has had one of the longest active lifetimes of any electronic component, more than 80 years. As of 2021, variants of the 6L6 are manufactured in Russia, China, and Slovakia.

== Variations ==
The voltage and power ratings of the 6L6 series were gradually pushed upwards by such features as thicker plates, grids of larger diameter wire, grid cooling fins, ultra-black plate coatings and low loss materials for the base. Variants of the 6L6 included the 6L6G, 6L6GX, 6L6GA, 6L6GAY, 6L6GB, 5932/6L6WGA and the 6L6GC. All variants after the original 6L6 utilized glass envelopes. A &quot;W&quot; in the descriptor identified the tube as designed to withstand greater vibration and impact. A &quot;Y&quot; in the descriptor indicated that the insulating material of the base was Micanol.
==Application==
The high transconductance and high plate resistance of the 6L6 requires circuit design that incorporates topologies and components that smooth out the frequency response, suppress voltage transients and prevent spurious oscillation.

<text>A chapter (c&quot;apitula&quot; in Latin; &quot;sommaires&quot; in French) is any of the main thematic divisions within a writing of relative length, such as a book of prose, poetry, or law. A book with chapters (not to be confused with the chapter book) may have multiple chapters that respectively comprise discrete topics or themes. In each case, chapters can be numbered, titled, or both. An example of a chapter that has become well known is &quot;Down the Rabbit-Hole&quot;, which is the first chapter from &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

==History of chapter titles==
Many ancient books had neither word divisions nor chapter divisions. In ancient Greek texts, some manuscripts began to add summaries and make them into tables of contents with numbers, but the titles did not appear in the text, only their numbers. Some time in the fifth century CE, the practice of dividing books into chapters began. Jerome (d. 420) is said to use the term &quot;capitulum&quot; to refer to numbered chapter headings and &quot;index capitulorum&quot; to refer to tables of contents. Augustine did not divide his major works into chapters, but in the early sixth century Eugippius did.  Medieval manuscripts often had no titles, only numbers in the text and a few words, often in red, following the number.

==Chapter structure==

Many novels of great length have chapters. Non-fiction books, especially those used for reference, almost always have chapters for ease of navigation. In these works, chapters are often subdivided into sections. Larger works with a lot of chapters often group them in several &#x27;parts&#x27; as the main subdivision of the book.

The chapters of reference works are almost always listed in a table of contents. Novels sometimes use a table of contents, but not always. If chapters are used they are normally numbered sequentially; they may also have titles, and in a few cases an epigraph or prefatory quotation. In older novels it was a common practice to summarise the content of each chapter in the table of contents and/or in the beginning of the chapter.
==Unusual numbering schemes==

In works of fiction, authors sometimes number their chapters eccentrically, often as a metafictional statement. For example:
* &quot;Seiobo There Below&quot; by László Krasznahorkai has chapters numbered according to the Fibonacci sequence.
* &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; by Mark Haddon only has chapters which are prime numbers.
* &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; by Flann O&#x27;Brien has only one chapter: the first page is titled &quot;Chapter 1&quot;, but there are no further chapter divisions.
* &quot;God, A Users&#x27; Guide&quot; by Seán Moncrieff is chaptered backwards (i.e., the first chapter is chapter 20 and the last is chapter 1). The novel &quot;The Running Man&quot; by Stephen King also uses a similar chapter numbering scheme.
* Every novel in the series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket has thirteen chapters, except the final instalment (&quot;The End&quot;), which has a fourteenth chapter formatted as its own novel.
* &quot;Mammoth&quot; by John Varley has the chapters ordered chronologically from the point of view of a non-time-traveler, but, as most of the characters travel through time, this leads to the chapters defying the conventional order.
* &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce has its 18 chapters labelled as episodes, with 3 books split between them.

==Book-like==
In ancient civilizations, books were often in the form of papyrus or parchment scrolls, which contained about the same amount of text as a typical chapter in a modern book. This is the reason chapters in recent reproductions and translations of works of these periods are often presented as &quot;Book 1&quot;, &quot;Book 2&quot; etc.

In the early printed era, long works were often published in multiple volumes, such as the Victorian triple decker novel, each divided into numerous chapters. Modern omnibus reprints will often retain the volume divisions. In some cases the chapters will be numbered consecutively all the way through, such that &quot;Book 2&quot; might begin with &quot;Chapter 9&quot;, but in other cases the numbering might reset after each part (i.e., &quot;Book 2, Chapter 1&quot;). Even though the practice of dividing novels into separate volumes is rare in modern publishing, many authors still structure their works into &quot;Books&quot; or &quot;Parts&quot; and then subdivide them into chapters. A notable example of this is &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; which consists of six &quot;books&quot;, each with a recognizable part of the story, although it is usually published in three volumes.

<text>Alson Menno Weber (; November 7, 1910 – December 29, 2005) was a Canadian volleyball player. He played for the Kitchener-Waterloo Y.M.C.A. Volleyball Team from 1932 to 1946. The K-W YMCA team won the Ontario Senior Open Championship every year from 1932-1946, the Eastern Canadian Championship all three times that it was held in that period, and also many International Tournaments which involved Ontario and New York State teams.

In 1939 the K-W YMCA team competed at the United States National Championships. They were defeated by the Houston, Texas team, which went on to win the US national championship.

Weber&#x27;s teammates included Carl Dunke, Jim McLeod, Delton Kropf, Henry Enns, Arthur Youngman, Lloyd Current and Morton Devitt. Alson Weber is honoured in the Waterloo County, Ontario and Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. The K-W YMCA team is also honoured in the Waterloo County Hall of Fame.

Weber spent the better part of his life in Waterloo, Ontario. He was predeceased by his wife, Lorraine Weber (Snyder) in 1988. He has three sons, John, Jim, and Ross.

<text>The yelkouan shearwater, Levantine shearwater or Mediterranean shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan) is a medium-sized shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae. It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the Manx shearwater (&quot;Puffinus puffinus&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The yelkouan shearwater was formally described in 1827 by the Italian naturalist Giuseppe Acerbi from specimens collected in the Bosphorus, Turkey. He placed the shearwater in the genus &quot;Procellaria&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Procellaria yelkouan&quot;. The yelkouan shearwater is now placed in the genus &quot;Puffinus&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The genus name &quot;Puffinus&quot; is Neo-Latin based on the English &quot;puffin&quot;. The specific &quot;yelkouan&quot; is the Turkish word &quot;wind chaser&quot; for a shearwater. The yelkouan shearwater is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

It was formerly considered a subspecies of the Manx shearwater. After the first split, it was the nominate subspecies of the so-called &quot;Mediterranean shearwater&quot; for nearly ten more years; it is considered a monotypic species now, as the Balearic form &quot;mauretanicus&quot; has been separated as the Balearic shearwater.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2021 found very little genetic difference between the yelkouan shearwater and the Balearic shearwater (&quot;Puffinus mauretanicus&quot;). The authors of the study suggested that these two taxa might be better considered as subspecies of the same species.

The yelkouan shearwater appears to belong to a group of Mediterranean and adjacent Atlantic shearwaters which includes the Balearic shearwater and one to three prehistorically extinct taxa, Hole&#x27;s and possibly also lava shearwater as well as an undescribed population of uncertain distinctness from Menorca. The two living Mediterranean lineages had probably separated before the end of the Pliocene (c. 2 million years ago), as indicated by molecular differences and the putative direct ancestor of the Balearic shearwater, the Ibizan fossil &quot;Puffinus nestori&quot; from the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene.

==Description==
The yelkouan shearwaters is in length and has a wingspan of . It has the typically &quot;shearing&quot; flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. This bird looks like a flying cross, with its wing held at right angles to the body, and it changes from very dark brown to white as the dark upperparts and paler undersides are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.

It is silent at sea, but at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls, higher pitched and more drawn out than the Manx shearwater&#x27;s.

The yelkouan shearwater has a more contrasted appearance than the Balearic shearwater with which its winter range overlaps, since the latter species is brown above and dirty white below. It is very similar to the black-and-white Manx shearwater of the Atlantic, and stray birds out of their usual range are very difficult to identify with certainty.

Also, at least one mixed breeding colony of the yelkouan and the Balearic shearwaters exists on Menorca. A study of these birds recommended that a combination of morphological characteristics and DNA sequence data should be required at least for scientific purposes to assign individual birds to either species.

==Distribution and habitat==
Yelkouan shearwaters breed on islands and coastal cliffs in the eastern and central Mediterranean. Most winter in that sea, but small numbers enter the Atlantic in late summer.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This species nests in burrows which are only visited at night to avoid predation by large gulls.

This is a gregarious species, which can be seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, especially in autumn. The yelkouan shearwater feeds on fish and molluscs. It follows fishing ships when offal is being thrown. 

==Status and conservation==
It is under some threat from the development of holiday resorts near its breeding sites, and also from animals such as rats and cats. On Le Levant Island, one of its major breeding locations, cats kill thousands of birds each year and it is estimated that this may lead to local extinction in several decades.

The study of the Menorcan colony concluded that at least in these westernmost birds, genetic variation was extremely low, suggesting that the yelkouan shearwater may have suffered a marked population decline historically and thus, while not threatened judging from its absolute numbers, it could be vulnerable to adverse effects of inbreeding.

It was formerly classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN. But new research has shown it to be rarer than it was believed. Consequently, it was uplisted to near threatened status in 2008 and vulnerable in 2012.
