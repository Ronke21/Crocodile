<text>The Pinaka (, pināka) is the celestial bow of the Hindu deity, Shiva. In popular legend, he is believed to have employed this bow in his avatar as Tripurantaka to annihilate the three cities of Mayasura, known as Tripura. The weapon is the origin of one of Shiva&#x27;s epithets, &quot;Pinākapāṇi&quot;, literally meaning, &#x27;The Wielder of The Pināka&#x27;.

== Literature ==

The first mention of the pinaka is In the Taittirīya and Vājasneyi Samhitas of the Krishna and Shukla Yajurveda respectively. Here, Rudra is called as Pinākahasta (one who has the Pināka bow in his hands) and Pinākavāsa (The one who wears the Pināka bow as an ornament). 

In the Shiva Purana, Shiva employed the Pinaka in his duel against Ganesha, who had been appointed to stand guard while his mother Parvati bathed.

In the Harivamsa Purana, when the Prajapati Daksha performed a yajna for the gods, his ceremony was obstructed by Shiva and a human incarnation of Nandi, who wielded the Pinaka. Hari (Vishnu) stood to confront him, accompanied by the adityas and the vasus. Shiva struck Hari on his breast, who countered by grabbing his assailant&#x27;s throat. When he strung his own bow Sharanga, the mountain Meru trembled. Infuriated, Nandi raised the Pinaka and struck Hari on the head, who stupefied the man with a smile and stood firm, allowing the yajna to resume.

In the Padma Purana, Shiva employed the Pinaka to combat Jalandhara:
When the Yadava forces invaded Sonitapura to rescue Aniruddha, Shiva and Kartikeya rushed to guard the city of the Shaiva asura, Bana. Krishna&#x27;s Sharanga and Shiva&#x27;s Pinaka were used against each other in the battle, the conflict ultimately won by Krishna.

In the Ramayana, Rama broke the Pinaka to win Princess Sita&#x27;s hand in marriage during her svayamvara.

The Pinaka is sometimes considered to be the weapon Shiva employed to destroy Tripura, even though other legends state that the bow used for the destruction of the three cities was fashioned from Mount Mandara:

<doc id="1067302" wikidata="Q3182481" url="?curid=1067302" title="Robert Elegant">
<text>Robert Sampson Elegant (7 March 1928 – 20 June 2023) was an American-British author and journalist. He spent many years in Asia as a journalist. The Asian settings of all but one of his novels reflect that experience. He covered both the Korean and the Vietnam Wars, as well as four or five lesser conflicts. One of his last novels, &quot;Cry Peace,&quot; is centered on the Korean War.

==Career==
Elegant held degrees from the University of Pennsylvania (AB, Phi Beta Kappa); and Columbia University (MA, Far Eastern studies, MS journalism, Distinguished Alumnus Award), as well as a diploma of proficiency in Chinese from Yale University. He was a Pulitzer Prize traveling fellow (1951) and received an Edgar Allan Poe Special Award in 1967 for &quot;A Kind of Treason,&quot; among the best first mystery thriller novels of the preceding year.

Among other awards, he received four prizes for best interpretation of foreign news by the Overseas Press Club of America. He was shortlisted for a Pulitzer Prize in international reporting three times, a finalist twice. He was a visiting professor at the University of South Carolina and Boston University.

Elegant was a fellow of the Washington, D.C. American Enterprise Institute, the Berlin, Germany, Wissenschaftskolleg, Institute for Advanced Studies, and the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University.

Elegant briefed Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger repeatedly on Asia in general, as well as China and Vietnam in particular.
He was proud of a handwritten note from the former president whose undeniably momentous masterstroke in foreign affairs was reopening contact with mainland China. That note reads: &quot;Dear Robert, You are my favorite China expert. Richard Nixon&quot;

A patron of the Manchu Shih Tzu Society of Great Britain, he raised Shih-tzu (Chinese lion) dogs and was a devoted amateur sailor and owner of small craft for 50 years.

Elegant later lived in London and Italy. He frequently traveled, mainly to the Far East. He spoke, read, and wrote Chinese and Japanese, having studied both the classical and modern languages, as well as German, Italian, and some Indonesian.

His articles were published in hundreds of newspapers and scores of weekly, biweekly, and monthly journals across the world, and his books were published in a number of languages in 20 countries.

==Personal life and death==
On 16 April 1956, Elegant married painter Moira Clarissa Brady. They have two children, Victoria and Simon, and five grandchildren. Brady died of cancer on 19 January 1999. 

On 10 May 2003, Elegant married author and editor Ursula Rosemary Righter (née Douglas). 

Elegant died at home in London on 20 June 2023, at the age of 95.

<doc id="1067303" wikidata="Q390732" url="?curid=1067303" title="Sendo">
<text>Sendo was a British manufacturer and supplier of mobile phones founded in 1998 and based in Birmingham. It specialised in low-cost handsets aimed primarily at the pay-as-you-go markets and also high-end Symbian smartphones.

The company went into administration in 2005 and its technology was bought by Motorola.

==History==
Sendo was created in 1998 by mobile phone experts from Philips and Motorola. In February 2001, Microsoft announced a partnership, in which Microsoft bought $12m of Sendo shares (10%) and a seat on the board. Sendo was to be Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;go to market partner&quot; for the Stinger smartphone platform that became &quot;Smartphone 2002&quot;.

Microsoft was to deliver code for the StingerOS by June and the first prototype, the Sendo Z100, was delivered. Sendo manage to ship an SDK, but by December not enough code had been delivered by Microsoft and, without any products to sell, Sendo couldn&#x27;t raise any money from sales or venture capitalists. Sendo dropped Microsoft and opted to go with Symbian but eventually went bankrupt.

Under the deal, if Sendo was declared insolvent &quot;Microsoft would obtain an irrevocable, royalty free licence to use Sendo&#x27;s Z100 intellectual property, including rights to make, use, or copy the Sendo Smartphone to create other Smartphones and to, most importantly for Microsoft, sublicense those rights to third parties.&quot; A product based on the Sendo Z100 was released while Sendo was still solvent by Orange as the Orange SPV 100, manufactured by HTC as the HTC Canary, the first Windows Mobile smartphone.

As a consequence Sendo sued Microsoft in December 2002, alleging it stole proprietary technology and trade secrets and gave these to HTC enabling HTC and itself to launch into the mobile phone market.

Microsoft denied the allegations and in February 2003 filed a counter suit alleging breach of contract. A trial was scheduled for early 2005 but an out of court settlement was reached in September 2004, in which there was a &quot;monetary component&quot; and Microsoft giving up its stake of Sendo. In June 2006 Sendo then sued Orange.

In September 2003, Microsoft and Sendo dropped their suits and announced that Microsoft had given up its shares in Sendo.

In 2004, Sendo sold 5 million devices and, along with other major mobile phone manufacturer, showed interest in using Nvidia&#x27;s GoForce graphic chips.

In March 2005, Sendo made an objection to the European Commission regarding Ericsson and their patent and licence management after being sued.

Sendo went into administration in June 2005 and its technology was bought by Motorola. At the time Motorola took over the developers and their patents, they held 50 valid patents and had 40 waiting for approval.

<text>Claudius Clavus (Suartho) also known as &quot;Nicholas Niger&quot;, (), (born 14 September 1388), was a Danish geographer sometimes considered to be the first Nordic cartographer.

It is believed that he was born in the village of Salling on the Danish island of Funen. He is commemorated by a plaque in the local &quot;Aagaarden&quot;.

In 141213 at the age of 25 he started to travel around Europe and appeared eleven years later (142324) in Rome. It is believed he travelled as far north as the 70°10&#x27; N. lat. In Rome he became friends with the cardinal Giordano Orsini and the pope&#x27;s secretary Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini, who were among those working to update the old Roman cartography. Claudius contributed to a more realistic description of Nordic countries, in particular Iceland and Greenland, and was probably the first cartographer to put Greenland on a map. He is also known for having named Greenlandic places by using lyrics from old folk songs.

Most of his work (including two maps) is lost, but a copy has been preserved through the German cartographers Donnus Nicholas Germanus and Henricus Martellus Germanus, and in the nineteenth century more texts were rediscovered in the imperial library at Vienna. He drew 27 maps for a copy of the &quot;Geography&quot; by Ptolemy (see image).

<text>Ronald Joseph Ryan (21 February 1925 – 3 February 1967) was the last person to be legally executed in Australia. Ryan was found guilty of shooting and killing warder George Hodson during an escape from Pentridge Prison, Victoria, in 1965. Ryan&#x27;s hanging was met with public protests by those opposed to capital punishment. Capital punishment was abolished in all states by 1985.

== Early life ==

Ronald Edmond Thompson was born at the Royal Women&#x27;s Hospital in Melbourne&#x27;s inner suburb of Carlton, to John Ronald Ryan and Cecilia Thompson (née Young). Cecilia already had a son with her first husband, George Harry Thompson and was living with John Ryan. Cecilia and George had separated in 1915 when George left to fight in the Great War. The relationship never resumed. Cecilia met Ryan while working as a nurse in Woods Point where he was suffering from lung disease. They formed a relationship in 1924 and later married in 1929, after Thompson&#x27;s death in 1927 by falling from a tram and getting hit by a car. Ronald then adopted the name Ronald Edmond Ryan. In 1936, Ryan was confirmed in the Roman Catholic Church. He took as his confirmation name Joseph, becoming Ronald Edmond Joseph Ryan. He did not like Edmond and from then on used &quot;Ronald Joseph Ryan&quot;.

His three sisters were made wards of the state a year later when authorities declared them to be neglected. His sisters were sent to the Good Shepherd Convent in Collingwood. Ryan absconded from Rupertswood in September 1939 and, with his half-brother George Thompson, worked in and around Balranald, New South Wales; spare money earned from sleeper cutting and kangaroo shooting was sent to his mother, who was looking after their sick, alcoholic father.

At the age of 20, Ryan had saved enough money to rent a house in Balranald. He collected his mother and sisters and they lived together in this house. Ryan&#x27;s father stayed in Melbourne and died a year later, aged 62, after a long battle with miners&#x27; disease, phthisis tuberculosis.

==Move to Victoria, marriage and children==

Aged about 22, Ryan decided to join his brother, who was tomato farming near Tatura, Victoria. He started visiting Melbourne on weekends and during one of these weekend trips Ryan met his future wife, Dorothy Janet George. On 4 February 1950, Ryan married Dorothy at St Stephen&#x27;s Anglican Church in Richmond, Victoria. He converted from Roman Catholicism to the Church of England to marry her. He converted back to Catholicism shortly before his execution. Dorothy was the daughter of the mayor of the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. Ryan and Dorothy had three daughters, Janice, Wendy and Rhonda. A fourth baby was stillborn.

== Later life ==

After spending a few months working for his father-in-law as a trainee mechanic, Ryan decided that more money could be made cutting timber near Marysville and Licola. When it was too wet to cut timber, Ryan got a job painting for the State Electricity Commission. By 1952 the Ryan family was living in Noojee.

Trouble with the law started when his rented house burnt down. Ryan was away for the weekend in Melbourne when the arsonist struck. The arsonist was caught and claimed that Ryan had put him up to it in order to claim insurance money. His first appearance in court was in Warragul in 1953 when he was acquitted on a charge of arson.

In 1956 Ryan appeared in court for passing bad cheques in Dandenong. He was given a bond. His next appearance in court was after he issued a large number of forged cheques in Warrnambool. His partner was caught with the goods purchased with the bad cheques and handed Ryan over to the police. He received another good-behaviour bond after the arresting detective gave a favourable character reference on Ryan&#x27;s behalf.

Ryan first served prison time at Bendigo Prison. Here, under Ian Grindlay (who would later become the Governor of Pentridge Prison), he appeared to want to better himself. He was studying for his Matriculation (the successful completion of 12 years of formal schooling) when he was released on parole in August 1963. He was regarded by the authorities as a model prisoner.

After working as a clerk for a couple of months, Ryan went to lunch and was never to be seen again, as he had started robbing butchers shops and used explosives to blow their safes.

Ryan and two accomplices were caught after a shop robbery on 4 January 1964. He was charged with breaking and entering and theft offences on 6 January 1964. Bailed on 3 February 1964, Ryan skipped town and fled to New South Wales. He later admitted to nine robberies in New South Wales between 4 April and 11 July 1964. On a visit home on 14 July he was caught by Victoria Police in the early hours the next morning. On 13 November 1964 he received an eight-year prison sentence for breaking and entering. He was sent to Pentridge Prison.

== Escape ==

After Ryan was sentenced to Pentridge Prison, he was placed in B Division where he met fellow prisoner Peter John Walker, who was serving a 12-year sentence for bank robbery. When Ryan was informed that his wife was seeking a divorce, he made a plan to escape from prison. Walker decided to go along with him. Ryan planned to take himself and his family and flee to Brazil, which did not have an extradition treaty with Australia. On 19 December 1965, Ryan and Walker scaled the prison wall and ran across the top of the wall to a prison watchtower, where they took prison officer Helmut Lange hostage, threatening him to open the gate with his own M1 rifle. Lange agreed, but deliberately pulled the wrong lever. Ryan and Walker then proceeded downstairs with their hostage only to find that the gate would not open. At the bottom of the stairs was the night officers&#x27; lodge. Warder Fred Brown was returning from lunch to relieve Lange when he was confronted by the escapees. Brown did not resist. When Ryan realised Lange had tricked him, he jabbed the rifle into Lange&#x27;s back and marched him back up the stairs so Lange could pull the correct lever to open the tower gate. The two escapees then exited through the gate into the prison car park. To the escapees&#x27; dismay there were only six cars in the car park and five had flat tyres.

However, they did encounter the prison chaplain, Brigadier James Hewitt of the Salvation Army, in the car park. The escapees grabbed Hewitt and used him as a shield. Ryan, armed with the rifle, pointed it at Hewitt and demanded his car. Prison Officer Bennett in Tower 2 saw the prisoners. Ryan called to Bennett to throw down his rifle. Bennett ducked out of sight and then got his rifle.

When Hewitt told Ryan he did not have his car that day, Ryan rifle-butted him in the head causing serious injuries. Les Watt, a petrol attendant who watched the escape from a petrol station on Sydney Rd, witnessed Ryan hitting Hewitt with the rifle. The escapees then left the badly injured chaplain and Ryan ran out to Champ Street, directly in front of the south-west corner of the prison.

Walker went south across Church Street toward the adjacent Roman Catholic church in Sydney Road. Prison officer Bennett had his rifle aimed at Walker and ordered Walker to halt or he would shoot. Walker took cover behind a small wall that bordered the church. The prison alarm was raised by Warder Lange, and it began to blow loudly, indicating a prison escape. Unarmed warders, Wallis, Mitchinson and Paterson, came running out of the prison&#x27;s main gate and onto the street.

Prison officer George Hodson responded to the whistle and was told by Bennett that he had Walker pinned down. Hodson ran over to Walker and disarmed him, but Walker managed to get free and both men ran towards the armed Ryan.

Meanwhile, confusion and noise were increasing around the busy intersection of Sydney Road and O&#x27;Hea Street and across to the Champ Street intersection, with Ryan waving the rifle around trying to get cars to stop so he could commandeer them, and people ducking for cover between cars.

Frank and Pauline Jeziorski were travelling south on Champ Street and had slowed to give way to traffic on Sydney Road when Ryan armed with the rifle appeared in front of their car. Ryan threatened the driver and his passenger wife to get out of their car. The driver, Frank Jeziorski, turned his car off, put it in neutral then got out of his vehicle. Ryan got in via the driver&#x27;s door. Surprisingly, Pauline Jeziorski refused to get out of the car. She was persuaded by Ryan to get out, only to go back in the car to get her handbag. Paterson, realising Ryan was armed, returned inside the prison to get a rifle.

Warder William Mitchinson was first to reach the car and grabbed Ryan through the driver&#x27;s window, he told Ryan &quot;the game&#x27;s up&quot;. Warder Thomas Wallis who was following, ran to Pauline Jeziorski&#x27;s side of the car. He grabbed her and pulled her away from the car.

In frustration, Ryan forced Mitchinson to back off, then got out of the passenger&#x27;s side door and noticed Walker running towards him, being chased by Hodson who was holding the pipe in his hand. Walker was shouting frantically to Ryan that prison guard William Bennett, standing on the Number 2 prison tower, had his rifle aimed at them. At this time, Hodson was chasing Walker; Ryan took a couple of steps forward, raised his rifle, aimed at Hodson, and allegedly fired.

George Hodson fell to the ground. He had been struck by a single bullet that exited through Hodson&#x27;s back, about an inch lower than the point of entry in his right chest. Hodson died in the middle of Sydney Road. Warder Robert Paterson, now with a rifle, ran back outside and onto Champ Street.

Ryan and Walker ran past the critically wounded Hodson and commandeered a blue Standard Vanguard sedan on Sydney Road from its driver, Brian Mullins. With Walker driving and Ryan a passenger, the car travelled through an adjacent service station and then west along O&#x27;Hea Street.

==On the run==

Ryan and Walker successfully eluded their pursuers outside Pentridge Prison and drove away before changing cars. They then made their way south following the Moonee Ponds Creek to change cars again before hiding in a safe house in Kensington provided by Norman Harold Murray. The following day the men moved into Christine Aitken&#x27;s flat in Ormond Road, Elwood.

The prison escape dominated newspapers and other media. One newspaper reported that, &quot;Ronald Ryan, serving time for burglary, seized a prison officer and shot him three times, twice in the chest and once in the back.&quot; Reports of their activities caused widespread anxiety.

On 24 December, Ryan (armed with the warder&#x27;s rifle) and Walker robbed an ANZ bank in North Road, Ormond. The bank manager and a customer were ordered out of his office with a revolver (different to the warder&#x27;s rifle). Ryan herded 13 people into the bank&#x27;s strongroom and stole A£4500. A witness, June Crawford, told reporters, &quot;a bandit told me &#x27;This gun shot a man a few days ago. Ryan and Walker escaped in a 1952 Holden sedan.

On the same day, the Victorian Government announced a £6,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Ryan and Walker. It was reported in &quot;The Age&quot; that the Chief Secretary and Attorney General, Arthur Rylah, had issued a warning to the escapees that the killing of Hodson during the prison escape was the worst Victoria had known and that the &quot;Hanging Act was still in force.&quot;

On 24 December there was a party at the flat. A petty criminal, John Fisher, who knew Ryan, and Arthur Henderson (Aitken&#x27;s boyfriend) were there. After all their beer had been consumed, Walker and Henderson left to find sly-grog in Albert Park for more drinks. An hour later Walker returned alone to the flat. He had killed Henderson in a Middle Park toilet block, having shot him in the back of the head. The escapees left the flat and returned to Kensington. On 26 December, Aitken and another woman were charged with harbouring the criminals. They came forward after Henderson was killed and the escapees had left. The charges were later dropped. The pair returned to hiding in the basement of the house in Kensington. Murray was given money to buy a car in Sydney and return with it. Murray returned with the car with Queensland plates on 31December. Ryan and Walker left for Sydney on 1 January 1966 and arrived on 2 January.

==Recapture==

After arriving in Sydney, Ryan and Walker endeavoured to establish some safe houses; Ryan also wanted to make contact with a woman he knew when he was in Sydney years ago; she was not home but her daughter was. Ryan made an arrangement to meet the woman and daughter at Concord Repatriation Hospital on the evening of 6 January. Unknown to Ryan the daughter recognised Ryan and tipped off the police. Acting on the information, Detective Inspector (DI) Ray &quot;Gunner&quot; Kelly was alerted about their presence. DI Kelly with a heavily armed contingent of 50 police officers and detectives set a trap for them.

When the escapees&#x27; car pulled up near the hospital, Ryan walked over to a nearby telephone box, but it had been deliberately put out of order, so he walked over to a neighbouring shop and asked to use the phone there. The owner had been instructed to tell Ryan that his phone was also out of order, and as Ryan walked out of the shop he was tackled by six detectives, dropping a loaded .32 revolver that he had been carrying. At the same moment Det. Sgt Fred Krahe thrust a shotgun through the car window and held it at Walker&#x27;s head, and he was captured without a struggle. Ryan and Walker had been on the run for 19 days. In the boot of the car police found three pistols, a shotgun and two rifles, all fully loaded, an axe, jemmy, two coils of rope, a hacksaw and two boiler suits.

==Extradition==

Ryan and Walker were extradited back to Melbourne. They were jointly tried for the murder of George Hodson. It is alleged that Ryan made three verbal confessions to police whilst being extradited to Melbourne. According to police, Ryan admitted to them he had shot prison officer Hodson. However, these verbal allegations were not signed by Ryan and he denied making such verbal or written confessions to anyone. The only signed document by Ryan was that he would give no verbal testimony. Walker was also tried for the shooting murder of Arthur James Henderson during the period when he and Ryan were at large.

==Trial and sentencing==

On 15 March 1966, the case of &quot;The Queen v. Ryan and Walker&quot; began in the Supreme Court of Victoria. The first day was spent choosing the make up of the jury. Ryan and Walker each exercised their legal right in objecting to twenty candidates.

===Crown&#x27;s case===

The Crown&#x27;s case presented no scientific evidence. Ryan&#x27;s rifle was never scientifically tested by ballistics experts to prove that it had fired a shot. The fatal bullet and the spent cartridge casing were never recovered so no ballistic or forensic evidence was available to prove that Ryan had fired the fatal shot. 
The Crown&#x27;s case relied only on eyewitnesses who were near Pentridge Prison when Hodson was shot and killed, because there was no scientific forensic evidence to prove Ryan fired a shot. Each eyewitness testified to a different account of what they saw and where Ryan was standing. Eleven eyewitnesses swore that they saw Ryan waving and aiming his rifle. There were variations, whether Ryan was standing, walking or squatting at the time a single shot was heard and whether Ryan was to the left or right of Hodson. Only four eyewitnesses testified that they saw Ryan fire a shot. Two eyewitnesses testified that they saw smoke coming from Ryan&#x27;s rifle. Two eyewitnesses testified that they saw Ryan&#x27;s weapon recoil.

Some witnesses testified that they saw Ryan&#x27;s rifle recoil when he fired and also saw smoke from Ryan&#x27;s rifle. The owners of the car Ryan got into, Frank and Pauline Jeziorski, were two of the witnesses. A warder, Thomas Wallis, testified that he saw smoke come out of the rifle Ryan was holding. Pauline Jeziorski testified that she smelled gunpowder after Ryan had fired the shot.

At trial, all prison officers testified that they did not see Hodson carrying anything and that they did not see Hodson hit Walker. However, two witnesses, Louis Bailey and Keith Dobson, testified that they saw Hodson carrying something like an iron-bar or baton as he was chasing after Walker. Governor Grindlay testified that he did not see a bar near Hodson&#x27;s body but that he found one after Hodson&#x27;s body was loaded into an ambulance.

==== Verbal confessions ====

The Crown also relied upon unrecorded unsigned testimony that Ryan had, allegedly, verbally confessed to shooting Hodson.

Detective Sergeant KP &quot;Bill&quot; Walters told the court that on 6 January 1966, the day after his re-capture in Sydney, Ryan said
In the heat of the moment you sometimes do an act without thinking. I think this is what happened with Hodson. He had no need to interfere. He was stupid. He was told to keep away. He grabbed Pete [Walker] and hit him with an iron bar. He caused his own death. I didn&#x27;t want to shoot him. I could have shot a lot more.

Detective Senior Constable Harry Morrison told the court that on 7 January 1966 during the flight returning Ryan back to Melbourne Ryan said: &quot;The warder spoilt the whole show. If he had not poked his great head into it he would not have got shot. It was either him or Pete.&quot;

The Crown also called the two bank officers from the bank that Ryan and Walker robbed. Robert Sipthorpe and George Robertson testified that Ryan said &quot;This is the gun that shot a man the other day!&quot; At trial, Ryan&#x27;s defence lawyer Philip Opas cross-examined the two witnesses asking if instead they heard &quot;This is the type of gun that shot a man the other day.&quot; Both witnesses stuck to their story.

John Fisher, who had a long criminal history and had not seen or heard from Ryan for more than two years, testified that he asked Ryan who had shot Hodson. Fisher said Ryan told him he had shot Hodson.

None of the verbal confessions were signed by Ryan, who only signed documents saying that he would give no verbal testimony. Ryan testified he had been &quot;verballed&quot; and denied the allegations of verbals/confessions said to have been made by him.

=== Defence&#x27;s case ===

The main problem for the defence was that Victoria had the Gaols Act of 1958 in which it stated: 
*Every male person lawfully imprisoned for any crime misdemeanour or offence by the sentence of any court of competent jurisdiction, or employed at labour as a criminal on the roads or other public works of Victoria who escapes or attempts to escape from any gaol or from the custody of any member of the police force gaoler or other officer in whose custody he may be, shall be guilty of felony: 
*If a killing occurs by an act of violence in the course of a commission of a felony involving violence or in the furtherance of the purpose of such a felony the accused is &quot;guilty of murder&quot; even though, there is no actual intention of killing.

The defence spent a lot of time arguing about when the time of the felony ended. Did it end after the prisoners had cleared the prison walls or did it once the prisoners were caught and returned to custody?

The defence pointed to various substantial discrepancies in The Crown&#x27;s case. While some eyewitnesses testified they saw Ryan to the east of Hodson when a single shot was heard, other eyewitnesses testified Ryan was to the west of Hodson. The discrepancies in evidence were substantial and wide-ranging. Opas contended that each of the fourteen eyewitnesses evidence were so contradictory that little store could be placed on them.

Philip Opas produced a human skeleton as a visual aid to explain the trajectory of the fatal bullet, Opas argued that the ballistics evidence indicated that the fatal bullet entered Hodson&#x27;s (chest) body in a downward trajectory. He also got a Monash University mathematics professor, Terry Speed, to explain that Ryan, tall would have had to have been tall to have fired the shot. These calculations were based on Ryan being twenty feet from Hodson and Hodson was standing perfectly upright. The bullet would enter Hodson&#x27;s body 62 inches from the ground and exit 61 inches from the ground. If the shot was in a downward angle the bullet would have hit the road forty feet from where Hodson was hit, it also suggested that Hodson could have been shot from another elevated point and possibly by another prison officer. It would cast doubt that Ryan had fired the fatal shot. But the prosecution argued that Hodson, tall could have been running in a stooped position, thus accounting for the bullet&#x27;s fatal angle of entry. No witnesses saw or testified seeing Hodson running in a stooped position.

The trajectory theory put forward by Opas, the trial judge dismissed the theory as did the judges at the Appeal two months later. They said there was enough evidence to say Hodson was not standing fully erected but was running in a forward leaning position when he was shot.

Opas in defending Ryan put a lot of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; &quot;I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired.&quot; In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said, &quot;Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot.&quot; In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said, &quot;I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot.&quot; Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said, &quot;I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle.&quot; In his second statement Paterson said, &quot;I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again.&quot; In his third statement Paterson said, &quot;I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered my gun again.&quot;

Ryan testified that he kept his rifle to prove his innocence in the event of recapture, as he knew that forensic microscopic markings on the spent bullet would prove that it was not fired from his rifle.

Despite extensive search by police, neither the fatal bullet nor the spent cartridge were ever found. Although all prison-authorised rifles were the same M1 carbine type, scientific forensic testing of the bullet would have proven which rifle fired the fatal shot – every rifle leaves a microscopic &quot;unique marker&quot; on the fired bullet as it travels through the barrel of the rifle.

All the bullets in Ryan&#x27;s M1 carbine rifle would be accounted for if Ryan cocked the rifle with the safety-catch on; this faulty operation (conceded by prison officer Lange, assistant prison governor Robert Duffy, and confirmed by ballistic experts at trial) would have caused an undischarged bullet to be ejected, spilling onto the floor of the guard tower. Opas established that for a person who was inexperienced in handling that type of rifle and its cocking lever, it would be easy to jam the rifle and any attempt to clear the jam would result in a live round being ejected.

On the eighth day of the trial Ryan was sworn in and took the witness stand. Ryan denied firing a shot, denied the alleged verbal (unsigned) confessions said to have been made by him, and denied ever saying to anyone that he had shot a man. According to Ryan, they were after the reward money by making false allegations. &quot;At no time did I fire a shot. My freedom was the only objective. The rifle was taken in the first instance so that it could not be used against me.&quot;

After a trial in the Victorian Supreme Court lasting twelve sitting days Ryan was convicted of the murder of Hodson and sentenced to death by Justice John Starke, the mandatory sentence at that time. Asked if he had anything to say before sentencing Ryan stated &quot;I still maintain my innocence. I will consult with my counsel with a view to appeal. That is all I have to say!&quot;
Walker was found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. He was also found guilty of manslaughter for the death of Arthur Henderson and received an 12-year sentence. Walker was paroled in 1984. He died on 5 March 2022, at the age of 80.

==After the trial==

According to juryman Tom Gildea, the jury evidently thought that the death sentence would be commuted, as had happened in the previous 35 death penalties cases since 1951. Gildea&#x27;s account of the discussions in the jury room, not one member of the jury thought that Ryan would be executed. Gildea said,

Of the jury, two members held out the first vote we took, but 10 of us were sure Ryan was guilty. He was a bit too sure of himself in the witness box but the thing that decided us was handling the rifle which had killed Hodson. We had been told the rifle had a hair trigger, but when we examined it we found we had to pull it at least half an inch and use quite a bit of force.&quot;

Eight members of the jury were experienced with rifles either in the country or overseas with war service.

Gildea also said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how much experience the judge and the lawyers had but we had had our share in the jury box I can tell you.&quot;

When it was apparent that the Victorian Government was intent on hanging Ryan, Gildea contacted the nine other jury members he could trace. Gildea said that of the twelve jurors, three refused to sign petitions, one older man who was convinced of Ryan&#x27;s guilt and the two who believe Ryan was not guilty. Two other jurors could not be contacted.

Seven jury members, including Gildea, signed separate petitions requesting Ryan&#x27;s death sentence be commuted to life in prison. Later, some of the jurors came forth and stated they would never have convicted Ryan of murder had they known that he would in fact be executed. Gildea said &quot;We didn&#x27;t want the rope. If we had known Ryan would hang, I think we would have gone for manslaughter.&quot;

==Appeal==

Opas decided to appeal against the murder verdict. The appeal was to the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, a bench consisting of three judges of the Supreme Court. The basis of the appeal was that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. He argued that as a matter of law that the inherent inconsistencies and improbabilities and even impossibilities in the evidence.

At the trial there had been a legal argument on when the crime of escaping from jail had been completed. In the Crimes Act, a relevant section provides that &quot;every male person lawfully imprisoned for any crime who escapes shall be guilty of a felony&quot;.

At the trial, Mr Justice Starke had directed the jury: &quot;In certain circumstances, the crime of murder may be established even though the accused had no intention of killing. And that is so in these circumstances. If a killing occurs by an act of violence in the course of a commission of a felony involving violence, or in the furtherance of the purpose of such felony, the accused is guilty of murder, even though there is no actual intention of killing.&quot; There was long legal argument on when the escape felony finished, did it stop once Ryan and Walker left the prison property or did it continue until they were caught in Sydney nineteen days later?

The appeal was dismissed on 8 June 1966.

On 14 October 1966, the Full Bench of the High Court of Australia rejected appeals by Ryan and Walker.
With all legal avenues yet to be exhausted, legal aid to Ryan was cut by the Bolte Government. Premier Bolte then directed the Public Solicitor to withdraw Opas&#x27; brief as the government was not going to fund the petition to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

Ryan had a right to increased free legal assistance for expert forensics analysis, to hire expert witnesses, and to present a series of appeals and recourses that were available to those facing execution by the government. The Full Court agreed that it was unthinkable that a man should be executed before he had exhausted his ultimate right of appeals. Opas decided to apply to the Privy Council in London. The appeal is a vestigial remnant of an appeal to the sovereign in person.

On 12 December 1966, the State Executive Council (Premier Bolte&#x27;s cabinet) announced that Ryan would hang on 9 January 1967.

Opas, convinced of Ryan&#x27;s innocence, agreed to work without pay. Opas consulted the Ethics Committee of the Bar Council to seek approval to make a public appeal for a solicitor prepared to brief him, as Opas was prepared to pay his travel, other expenses and appear without fee. The Committee said that this would be touting for business and was unethical. Opas argued that a man&#x27;s life was at stake and he could not see how he would be touting when no payment was involved. Opas defied the ruling and on national radio sought an instructor. Opas was inundated with offers and accepted the first application, being from Ralph Freadman. Alleyne Kiddle was in London completing a master&#x27;s degree and she agreed to take a junior brief without a fee.

On 4 January 1967, the State Executive Council stayed Ryan&#x27;s execution pending an approach to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

Opas then flew to London to present Ryan&#x27;s case to the highest judges in the Commonwealth. Ryan&#x27;s execution was delayed by Premier Bolte awaiting the Privy Council&#x27;s decision.

On 23 January 1967, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council refused Ryan leave for appeal.

On 25 January 1967, the State Executive Council set Ryan&#x27;s execution date as 31 January.

On 30 January 1967, Justice Starke ordered a stay of execution following an affidavit from former prisoner John Tolmie who said he saw a warder fire a shot from Number 1 tower at the time of the murder. The following day Tolmie was charged with perjury for making a false affidavit; he was not in gaol at the time of the escape.

Bolte scheduled Ryan&#x27;s execution for the morning of Friday 3 February 1967, a week before the dismissal of the appeal to the Privy Council was published in the Government Gazette.

==Final appeals==

The State Government of Victoria had commuted every death sentence passed since 1951, after Robert Clayton, Norman Andrews and Jean Lee were executed for the torture and murder of an old man.

Starke reported that the Premier of Victoria, Sir Henry Bolte, insisted that the death sentence be carried out. Bolte&#x27;s cabinet was unanimous although there were at least four State cabinet members who opposed capital punishment.

When it became apparent that Bolte intended to proceed with the execution, a secret eleventh-hour plea for mercy was made by four of the jury members. They sent petitioning letters to the Governor of Victoria, Sir Rohan Delacombe, stating that in reaching their verdict they believed that capital punishment had been abolished in Victoria and requested that the governor exercise the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and commute Ryan&#x27;s sentence of death. Such Melbourne newspapers as &quot;The Age&quot;, &quot;The Herald&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; all ran campaigns opposing the hanging of Ryan. The papers ran a campaign of spirited opposition on the grounds that the death penalty was barbaric. Churches, universities, unions and a large number of the public and legal professions opposed the death sentence. An estimated 18,000 people participated in street protests and around 15,000 signed a petition against the hanging. The Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) suspended radio broadcasts for two minutes as a protest.

Bolte denied all requests for mercy and was determined that Ryan would hang. On the afternoon of the eve of Ryan&#x27;s hanging, Opas appeared before the trial judge, Justice John Starke, seeking a postponement of the execution due to the opportunity to test new proffered evidence. Opas pleaded with Starke and said, &quot;Why the indecent haste to hang this man until we have tested all possible exculpatory evidence?&quot; Starke, however, rejected the application.

Attorney-General, Sir Arthur Rylah, rejected a second plea to refer Ryan&#x27;s case to the Full Court under Section 584 of the Crimes Act. A third attempt to save Ryan, in the form of a petition presented at the Crown Solicitor&#x27;s office pleading for clemency, was also rejected. Close secrecy surrounded all government moves on the Ryan case. That evening, a former Pentridge prisoner, Allan John Cane, arrived in Melbourne from Brisbane in a new bid to save Ryan. An affidavit by Cane, which was presented to Cabinet, says he and seven prisoners were outside the cookhouse when they saw and heard a prison warder fire a shot from the No. 1 guard post at Pentridge Prison the day Hodson was shot. Police had interviewed these prisoners but none were called on at the trial to give evidence. Cane was immediately rushed into conference with his solicitor, Bernard Gaynor, who tried to contact cabinet ministers informing them of Cane&#x27;s arrival. Gaynor telephoned Government House seeking an audience with the Governor, Sir Rohan Delacombe. However, Gaynor was told by a Government House spokesman that nobody would be answering calls until 9 am (one hour after Ryan&#x27;s scheduled execution). Gaynor said Cane&#x27;s mission had failed.

At 23:00, Ryan was informed that his final petition for mercy had been rejected. More than 3,000 people gathered outside Pentridge Prison in protest of the hanging. Shortly before midnight more than 200 police were at the prison to control the demonstrators.

==Execution==

On the night before the execution Ryan was transferred to a cell just a few steps away from the gallows trapdoor. Father Brosnan was with him most of this time. At the eleventh hour Ryan wrote his last letters to his family members, to his defence counsel, to the Anti-Hanging Committee and to Father Brosnan. The letters were handwritten on toilet paper inside his cell and neatly folded. In the documentary film &quot;The Last Man Hanged&quot; Ryan&#x27;s letter to The Anti-Hanging Committee is read out loud to the public. Ryan wrote: &quot;I state most emphatically that I am not guilty of murder.&quot; Ryan&#x27;s last letter was to his daughters; it contained this line: &quot;With regard to my guilt I say only that I am innocent of intent and have a clear conscience in the matter.&quot;

Ryan refused to have any sedatives but he did have a nip of whisky, and walked calmly onto the gallows trapdoor. Ronald Ryan&#x27;s last words were to the hangman: &quot;God bless you, please make it quick.&quot;

Ryan was hanged in &#x27;D&#x27; Division at Pentridge Prison at 8:00 am on Friday 3 February 1967.

A nationwide three-minute silence was observed by Ryan&#x27;s supporters at the exact time that Ryan was hanged. Ryan&#x27;s fellow prisoners staged their own protest – they refused to get out of bed, staged a sit-in, refused to work or obey orders. There was an eerie silence throughout the prison.

Later that day, Ryan&#x27;s body was buried in an unmarked grave within the &quot;D&quot; Division prison facility.

Forty years later in 2007, the Victorian Premier John Brumby granted permission for Ryan&#x27;s family members to have his body exhumed from Pentridge Prison after Hodson&#x27;s daughter jumped and danced on Ryan&#x27;s grave. Ryan&#x27;s remains were cremated and placed next to his deceased ex-wife in Portland Cemetery.

==Appearance and personality==

Ryan was a slightly built man who stood tall. He had suffered an injury to his left eye as a child resulting in a permanent droop of his left eyelid. He favoured expensive clothing, aiming to impress others, and aspired to be known as Australia&#x27;s leading criminal. He was of above-average intelligence and was described by the people who knew him and prison authorities as a likable character but also a compulsive gambler.

Arresting officer Det Harding described Ryan as &quot;tough, plausible and particularly difficult to question, he gave nothing away until he realised the game was up&quot;.

==Later statements==

Nineteen years after Ryan&#x27;s execution, a former warder, Doug Pascoe, claimed on air to Channel 9 and other media that he had fired a shot during Ryan&#x27;s escape bid. Pascoe said his shot may have accidentally killed his fellow prison guard, Hodson. Pascoe had not told anyone that he fired a shot during the escape because at that time, &quot;I was a 23-year-old coward.&quot; In 1986, he tried to sell his story but his claim was dismissed by police because his rifle had a full magazine after the shooting and he was too far away.

Pascoe&#x27;s claim was rejected by another former warder, Bill Newman. Newman claimed that he was in Tower 3 the afternoon of the escape and that Pascoe was in Tower 4. Tower 3 was 200 metres from the shooting and Tower 4 was 500 metres away. Police produced a photocopy of the duty roster for the day that showed that Newman was meant to have been in Tower 3 and Pascoe in Tower 4.

Though Opas claimed that the staff duty roster was virtually meaningless on the day of the shooting because prison officers were taking turns sitting in for their colleagues while they attended the annual staff Christmas party, Newman said he returned to his tower (3) at 1.45 pm and later signed statements for the police. According to the duty roster Robert Paterson was not on duty either but in fact he was on duty – he was the one that fired a shot.

Retired prison governor Ian Grindlay said that Ryan told him &quot;straight out&quot; that he had shot but not meant to kill Hodson.

Sister Margaret Kingston of the Good Shepherd Convent in Abbotsford, said Ryan told her that he had shot Hodson, but had not meant to kill him.

===Eyewitness===

Twenty-five years after being a witness in Ryan&#x27;s trial, where he gave evidence claiming to have seen him commit the murder, a man broke his silence, for fear that the alleged killer was becoming a latter-day Ned Kelly. Les Watt wrote to &quot;The Australian&quot;: &quot;Let me assure you and your readers that Ryan did kill Hodson.&quot; Watt spoke out after reading Philip Opas&#x27; comments and the latter&#x27;s autobiography. Watt was one of four witnesses to testify seeing Ryan fire a shot. Watt said that it might well be proper for Opas to leave the bar as his emotional involvement with the case had certainly distorted the facts, leading as it had to the suggestion that Ryan might not have fired the shot that killed Hodson. Watt, on the contrary, said that he saw Ryan take aim and fire and then saw Hodson fall flat on his face and not move. &quot;It was a sickening sight. I also witnessed a slight puff of smoke come from the carbine Ryan used. This was probably as a result of a bullet passing through a well-oiled barrel bore.&quot;

==Case for innocence==

An Australian criminologist, Gordon Hawkins, the director of Sydney University&#x27;s Institute of Criminology, doubts the damning validity of the &quot;unsigned confessions&quot; of Ryan in a television film documentary, &quot;Beyond Reasonable Doubt&quot;. Although verbal confessions are not permissible in court, in the 1960s the public—and therefore the jury—were much more trusting of the police. As to whether as a result an innocent man was hanged, there is at least a reasonable doubt following revelations of police corruption uncovered by various Australian police royal commissions. Australian police have to record or tape all interviews they carry out in connection with a crime. The police had no evidence of these unsigned verbal confessions. Ryan signed only a statement saying that he would not be giving any statements, verbal or written, to anyone except his lawyer. Hawkins questions why Ryan, a seasoned criminal, would suddenly feel the need to tell all to the police.

In 1993, a former Pentridge prisoner, Harold Sheehan, claimed he had witnessed the shooting but had not come forward at the time. Sheehan saw Ryan on his knees when the shot rang out and, therefore, Ryan could not have inflicted the wound that had killed Hodson, which passed in a downward trajectory.

All prison-authorised M1 carbine rifles, including that seized by Ryan from Lange, were issued loaded with eight rounds ball. Seven of the eight were accounted for in Ryan&#x27;s case. If the eighth fell onto the floor of the prison watch-tower when Ryan cocked the rifle with the safety catch on, thereby ejecting a live round, then the bullet that killed Hodson must have been fired by a person other than Ryan.

In a letter, &quot;Opas on Ryan – The innocence of Ronald Ryan&quot;, written to the Victorian Bar Association and published in the &quot;Victorian Bar News&quot; (Spring 2002), Opas responded to an assertion made by Julian Burnside, in reviewing Mike Richard&#x27;s book &quot;The Hanged Man&quot;, that Ryan was guilty, but that while the verdict was correct the punishment was wrong.

Opas disagreed with this assertion, refusing to believe that at any time Ryan confessed to anyone that he fired a shot and denying the existence of any evidence whatsoever that Ryan ever confessed guilt to anyone, either verbally or in writing.

Ryan gave evidence and swore that he did not fire at Hodson. He denied firing a shot at all. Ryan denied the alleged verbal confessions said to have been made by him. Opas says the last words Ryan said to him were; &quot;We&#x27;ve all got to go sometime, but I don&#x27;t want to go this way for something I didn&#x27;t do.&quot;

On 26 March 2003, just months prior to his death, Catholic priest Father John Brosnan was asked on ABC Radio by journalist Kellie Day about Ryan, who was believed to have fired the fatal shot during the prison breakout. Brosnan said; &quot;No, I won&#x27;t make a hero out of him. He caused a situation. I don&#x27;t know whose bullet killed who, but a friend of mine died. But I&#x27;ll tell you what, he had heroic qualities.&quot; Father Brosnan said. &quot;George was a nice fellow, but his wife had left him, taking their thirteen-year-old daughter with her, and he didn&#x27;t have much of a life. I used to talk to him at Pentridge and drop in to see him in St Kilda sometimes to cheer him up.&quot;

On 1 March 2004, in an interview with the Australian Coalition Against Death Penalty (ACADP), Opas said: &quot;I want to put the record straight. I want the truth told about Ronald Ryan – that an innocent man went to the gallows. I want the truth to be made available to everyone, for anyone young and old, who may want to do research into Ryan&#x27;s case or research on the issue of capital punishment. I will go to my grave firmly of the opinion that Ronald Ryan did not commit murder. I refuse to believe that at any time he told anyone that he did&quot;.

On 23 August 2008, Philip Opas QC, died after a long illness at the age of 91. Opas maintained Ryan&#x27;s innocence to the end. Opas asked Australian Coalition President Dorina Lisson to keep fighting to clear Ryan&#x27;s name. According to Ms Lisson, she and others are determined to have Ryan&#x27;s murder conviction overturned because there is no scientific ballistic forensic evidence to prove Ryan guilty of murder, that a wrongly convicted man was hanged based solely on unsigned unrecorded unproven &quot;hearsay&quot; allegations of verbals/confessions.

For 35 years, Barry Jones, who was a member of both the Victorian and Federal Parliaments refused to comment publicly on Ryan&#x27;s hanging. Mr Jones broke his silence in 2002 at the launch of Mike Richards&#x27; book, &quot;The Hanged Man&quot;. Mr Jones says he remains &quot;unsure&quot; of whether Ryan ever pulled the trigger. &quot;It seemed to me that there was probably a reasonable doubt in the case,&quot; he said. Mr Jones, also the former secretary of the Victorian Anti-Hanging Committee says he believes Ryan&#x27;s hanging was an attempt by then Victorian Premier Henry Bolte, to push his law and order agenda.

Justice Starke, the judge at Ryan&#x27;s trial and a committed abolitionist, was convinced of Ryan&#x27;s guilt but did not personally think that he should hang. Until his death in 1992, Starke remained troubled about Ryan&#x27;s hanging and would often ask his colleagues if they thought he did the right thing. Philip Opas&#x27; junior in the trial, Brian Bourke, was filmed in 2005 saying: ″One of the problems of Ryan&#x27;s trial was an alleged admission that he made on the plane back to the homicide fellows. That sort of thing can&#x27;t happen now, because they&#x27;ve got to be recorded on tape, but whether he made the admission or was verballed, I don&#x27;t know. He was a pretty talkative fellow, he might have. I didn&#x27;t have much doubt about his guilt.″

An Epiphany Window was installed at St James the Great Anglican Church a few weeks after the execution. It was created by the artist Miroslav &quot;Dismas&quot; Zika, who etched an inscription in Latin into the glass towards the base of the window, a translation of which in English is rendered &quot;Dismas made this in 1967 at the beginning of the month when Bolte, scandalous, arrogant, was demanding Ryan suffer capital punishment.&quot; Bolte considered this objectionable. Sir Frank Woods, Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, apologised to the Premier, clarifying that the inscription had neither been included in the original design brief, nor had any &quot;official authorisation&quot;, and that the offending inscription would be removed. Zika remained unrepentant.

<text>The Budawang Range, commonly called The Budawangs, a rugged mountain range within the Budawang National Park and the Morton National Park, are part of a spur off the Great Dividing Range and are located in the South Coast region of New South Wales, Australia.

The highest mountain in the range is Mount Budawang that has an elevation of above sea level.

==Location and features==
Commencing between the headwaters of the Clyde and Endrick rivers, The Budawangs extend in a generally south southwest direction for about to Mount Budawang about southeast of . The range consists of mountains and escarpments, generally at an elevation of , forming most of the western watershed of the Clyde River. The range comprises a series of hills extending generally west northwest from the north end of Budawang Range near Sassafras for about to above the junction of the Shoalhaven and Endrick rivers. The Pigeon House Range forms the watershed between the northeast waters of Endrick River and those flowing north into the Shoalhaven River. A prominent range bearing west northwest forms the watershed separating the Endrick and Shoalhaven River systems. The Budawang Range is located approximately south-southwest of Sydney.

The range defines part of the boundary between the New South Wales South Coast and the Southern Tablelands.

Much of the land within the range has been declared a wilderness area and are popular with bush walkers due to their terrain and unique features.

===Mountain peaks===
The Budawangs are generally considered to contain peaks located with the Budawang Range, the Pigeon House Range, the Currockbilly Range, and the Wirritin Range. The major recorded peaks are:
*Mount Budawang ()
*Currockbilly Mountain ()
*Mount Tarn (876 m or 2,844 ft)
*Wog Wog Mountain ()
*Mount Cole ()
*Sturgiss Mountain ()
*Fosters Mountain ()
*Barneys Hill ()
*The Castle ()
*Shrouded Gods Mountain ()
*Donjon Mountain ()
*Quiltys Mountain ()
*Wirritin Mountain ()
* Pigeon House Mountain / &quot;Didthul&quot; ()
*Mount Bushwalker ()
*Byangee Mountain ()

===Other features===
Other features within the range include the Monolith Valley, The Seven Gods Monoliths, Clyde River Valley, Hidden Valley, and Ettrema Gorge.

==Land use history==

===Aboriginal use===


The earliest human occupants of The Budawangs were three Aboriginal tribes; the Budawang people who live between Conjola and Duras, the Wandandians who inhabit land to the north of Pigeon House Mountain (Balgan), and the Walbanjas who live south of Pigeon House.

There are archaeological records of Aboriginal presence in the area dating back to around 11,000 years ago. Nearby coastal deposits have been dated at around 20,000 years old, so occupation in the Budawangs may well be older than current evidence suggests. Archaeological evidence found in the area includes occupational deposits in rock shelters, open campsites, and axe grinding grooves often found on rocks by the sides of creeks in the area. Art sites and rock arrangements also exist in the Budawangs though they are quite rare - the best of these is on Quilty&#x27;s Mountain.

===European land use===

There are several grazing farmlands surrounding the national parks region both in the east and the west of the range. Logging began in the Budawang area in the early 1900s, it continues to this day in areas that remain outside of the national parks, such as state forests.

The Australian Army operated an artillery range on the Tianjara plateau between 1943 and 1974, also using the area for practice bombing and exercises often involving offroad vehicles. This area is highly damaged and littered with target debris and unexploded ordnance. If walking in or near this area, walker should take extreme care.

Royal Australian Navy jet aircraft and helicopters use the area as a designated low-fly training area, allowing high speed flight through the area at above the ground.

==Access==
As The Budawangs are only accessible from gravel roads, care should be taken after rain as the roads can become slippery.

The northern parts of the area including the Clyde River valley are best accessed from the Braidwood Nowra road. There are two entrances in the northern part of the park. One is near and requires walking through farmland to the area around Quilty&#x27;s Mountain. The other main northern entrance is a not very clearly marked gate on the side of the road near Sassafras.

Access to The Castle and Monolith Valley is best achieved from Long Gully just off the Western Distributor.

Access to the western Wog Wog Mountain side of the park is via a park entrance off the Mongarlowe/Nerriga road, either coming from Braidwood to the south or to the north.

All three main entrances now have marked campsites and pit toilets. The Sassafrass campsite is approximately down the fire trail from the carpark and has tank water and a sheltered picnic table. The Wog Wog campsite has no water. The Long Gully campsite is located adjacent to the Yadboro River.

===Maps===
If walking in The Budawangs a recommended resource is the Northern Budawang Range and the Upper Clyde River Valley sketch map, published by The Budawang Committee and available in most Sydney/Nowra/Canberra bushwalking stores. The sketch map was hand drawn and details many of the possible walks in the most popular part of the national park. The area is also covered by the 1:25,000 CMA maps CORANG (8927-3-N), ENDRICK (8927-4-S), TIANJARA (8927-1-S) and MILTON (8927-2-N).

<text>Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, also called the Feast of Saint Andrew or Andermas, is the feast day of Andrew the Apostle. It is celebrated on 30 November, during Scotland&#x27;s Winter Festival. Saint Andrew is the disciple in the New Testament who introduced his brother, the Apostle Peter, to Jesus, the Messiah.

==Traditions and celebrations==
Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day marks the beginning of the traditional Advent devotion of the Saint Andrew Christmas Novena.

Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day (, ) is Scotland&#x27;s official national day. It has been a national holiday in Romania since 2015. He is the patron saint of Cyprus, Scotland, Greece (City of Patras), Romania, Russia, Ukraine, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, San Andres Island (Colombia), Saint Andrew (Barbados), Tenerife (Spain), and Chamoson (Switzerland).

==Scotland==
The celebration of Saint Andrew as a national festival among some social strata and locales is thought to originate from the reign of Malcolm III (1058–1093). It was thought that the ritual slaughter of animals associated with Samhain was moved to this date to ensure enough animals were kept alive for winter. Still, it is only in more recent times that 30 November has been given national holiday status, although it remains a normal working day.

===Bank holiday===

In 2006, the Scottish Parliament passed the St. Andrew&#x27;s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007, which designated the day as an official bank holiday. If 30 November falls on a weekend, the next Monday is a bank holiday instead. Although it is a &quot;bank holiday&quot;, banks are not required to close (and, in practice, will remain open as normal), and employers are not required to give their employees the day off as a holiday. Likewise, schools remain open. 

The University of St Andrews traditionally gives the day for all the students as a free holiday, but this is not a binding rule.

===Saltire===

Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day is an official flag day in Scotland. The Scottish Government&#x27;s flag-flying regulations state that the flag of Scotland (the Saltire or Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross) shall fly on all its buildings with a flagpole. Before 2002, the Scottish Government followed the UK Government&#x27;s flag days and would fly the Saltire on Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day only. The regulations were updated to state that the Union Flag would be removed and replaced by the Saltire on buildings with only one flagpole.

The flying of the Union Flag from Edinburgh Castle on all days, including Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, causes anger among some Scottish politicians and Scottish nationalists who have argued that the Saltire should fly on 30 November instead. However, the Union Flag is flown by the British Army at the Castle as it is an official British Army flag flying station.

===Celebrations===

In Scotland and many countries with Scottish connections, Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day is marked with a celebration of Scottish culture and traditional Scottish food and music. In Scotland, the day is also seen as the start of a season of Scottish winter festivals encompassing Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, Hogmanay and Burns Night. There are week-long celebrations in the town of St Andrews and some other Scottish cities.

==Barbados==
Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day is celebrated as the national day of Independence in Barbados. As the patron saint, Saint Andrew is celebrated in some Barbadian symbols, including the cross formation of the Barbadian Coat of Arms, and the former Order of Barbados which styled recipients as Knight or Dame of St Andrew.

==Romania==
There are a few pre-Christian Romanian traditions connected to Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, some of them having their origin in the Roman celebrations of the god Saturn, most famously the Saturnalia.

The Dacian New Year took place from 14 November until 7 December; this was considered the interval when time began its course. One of the elements that came from the Roman and Thracian celebrations concerned wolves. During this night, wolves can eat all the animals they want. It is said that they can speak, too, but anyone who hears them will soon die. Early on Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, the mothers go into the garden and gather tree branches, especially from apple, pear, cherry trees, and rosebush branches. They make a bunch of branches for each family member. The one whose bunch blooms by New Year&#x27;s Day will be lucky and healthy the following year. The best-known tradition connected to this night concerns matrimony and premonitory dreams. Single girls must put a sprig or branch of sweet basil under their pillow. The girl will marry soon if someone takes the plants in their dreams. They can also plant wheat in a dish and water it until New Year&#x27;s Day. The nicer the wheat looks that day, the better the year to come.

==Serbia==
On Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day in 1806, Serbs liberated Belgrade from Ottoman rule. On 12 December 1830 (St. Andrew&#x27;s Day), the Hatt-i şerif was read before the assembly in Belgrade. The document has defined the autonomy of Serbia as a part of the Ottoman Empire, and the additional berat confirmed Prince Miloš as the hereditary ruler of the Serbian Principality. St. Andrew&#x27;s Day was instituted as the Statehood Restoration Day and was celebrated during the rule of the Obrenović dynasty until 1903.

==Saint Andrew&#x27;s Eve==
In parts of Ukraine, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Poland, Russia, and Romania, a superstitious belief exists that the night before Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day is especially suitable for magic that reveals a young woman&#x27;s future husband or that binds a future husband to her. The day was believed to be the start of the most popular time for vampire activity, which would last until Saint George&#x27;s Eve (22 April).

In Poland, the holiday &quot;Andrzejki&quot; is celebrated on the night of the 29th through 30 November. Traditionally, the holiday was only observed by young single girls, though today, both young men and women join the party to see their futures. The main ceremony involved pouring hot wax from a candle through the hole in a key into cold water.
In Romania, it is customary for young women to put 41 grains of wheat beneath their pillow before they go to sleep, and if they dream that someone is coming to steal their grains, they will get married next year. Also, in other parts of the country, the young women light a candle from Easter and bring it to a fountain at midnight. They ask Saint Andrew to let them glimpse their future husband. Saint Andrew is invoked to ward off wolves, who are thought to be able to eat any animal they want on this night and to speak to humans. A human hearing a wolf talk to him will die. Saint Andrew is also the patron saint of Romania and the Romanian Orthodox Church.

In Póvoa de Varzim, an ancient fishing town in northern Portugal, Cape Santo André (Portuguese for Saint Andrew) is a place that shows evidence of Romanisation and probable earlier importance, with hints of Stone Age paintings. Near the cape there are small depressions in a rock, a mystery stone, that the people believe are the footprints of Saint Andrew. Saint Andrew&#x27;s Chapel is of probable mediaeval origin, referenced in 1546 and earlier documents. It is the burial site of drowned fishermen found at the cape. Fishermen also requested intervention from the saint for better catches. Single girls wanting to get married threw a little stone to the chapel&#x27;s roof, hoping it would lodge. Because of pagan syncretism, it has also been associated with white magic up to the present day. It was common to see groups of fishermen, holding lights in their hands, making a pilgrimage to the cape&#x27;s chapel along the beach on Saint Andrew&#x27;s Eve. They believed Saint Andrew fished, from the depths, the souls of the drowned. Those who did not visit Santo André in life would have to make the pilgrimage as a corpse.

== Eton College ==
St Andrew&#x27;s Day has become one of the two biggest holidays marked at Eton College, the other being the Fourth of June.

<text>Brian Manion Dennehy (; July 9, 1938 – April 15, 2020) was an American actor of stage, television, and film. He won two Tony Awards, an Olivier Award, and a Golden Globe, and received six Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Dennehy had roles in over 180 films and in many television and stage productions. His film roles included &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), &quot;Gorky Park&quot; (1983), &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985), &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985), &quot;F/X&quot; (1986), &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (1990), &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; (1995), &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996), &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007), and &quot;Knight of Cups&quot; (2015). Dennehy won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Film for his role as Willy Loman in the television film &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (2000). Dennehy&#x27;s final film was &quot;Driveways&quot; (2019), in which he plays a veteran of the Korean War, living alone, who befriends a young, shy boy who has come with his mother to clean out his deceased aunt&#x27;s hoarded home.

According to &quot;Variety&quot;, Dennehy was &quot;perhaps the foremost living interpreter&quot; of playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s works on stage and screen. He had a decades-long relationship with Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre where much of his O&#x27;Neill work originated. He also regularly played Canada&#x27;s Stratford Festival, especially in works by William Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett. He once gave credit for his award-winning performances to the plays’ authors: &quot;When you walk with giants, you learn how to take bigger steps.&quot; Dennehy was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Early life==
Brian Manion Dennehy was born on July 9, 1938, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Hannah (Manion), a nurse, and Edward Dennehy, a wire service editor for the Associated Press. He had two brothers, Michael and Edward. He was of Irish ancestry and was raised Catholic. The family relocated to Long Island, New York, where Dennehy attended Chaminade High School in the village of Mineola.

He entered Columbia University in New York City on a football scholarship in the fall of 1956. He interrupted his college education to spend five years in the U.S. Marines. He was stationed in the U.S., Japan, and Korea. He returned to Columbia in 1960 and graduated in 1965 with a B.A. in history. While acting in regional theater he supported his family by working blue-collar jobs including driving a taxi and bartending. He hated his brief stint as a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch in their Manhattan office in the mid-1970s. He later described how working odd hours allowed him to attend matinee theater performances that provided his acting education: &quot;I never went to acting school—I was a truck driver and I used to go see everything I could see—Wednesday afternoons&quot;. In the 1970s, stage performances in New York led to television and film work.

==Career==

===Film===
Dennehy was primarily known as a dramatic actor. His breakthrough role was as the overzealous sheriff Will Teasle in &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982) opposite Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo.

His earlier films included several comedies, like &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; (1977) with Burt Reynolds (in which he portrayed a pro football player), &quot;Foul Play&quot; (1978) with Chevy Chase, and &quot;10&quot; (1979) with Dudley Moore (as a Manzanillo bartender). He appeared in the 1983 thriller &quot;Gorky Park&quot; as William Kirwill opposite William Hurt and Lee Marvin. He later portrayed a corrupt sheriff in the western &quot;Silverado&quot; and an alien in &quot;Cocoon&quot;, both released in 1985.

Dennehy had memorable supporting parts in such films as &quot;Split Image&quot; (1982), &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; (1983), &quot;Legal Eagles&quot; (1986), &quot;&quot; (1988), &quot;F/X: Murder By Illusion&quot; (1986), &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (1990), &quot;F/X2: The Deadly Art of Illusion&quot; (1991) and &quot;Prophet of Evil&quot; (1993).

Dennehy gradually became a valuable character actor but also achieved leading-man status in the thriller &quot;Best Seller&quot; (1987) co-starring James Woods. That same year, he also starred in the Peter Greenaway film &quot;The Belly of an Architect&quot;, for which he won the Best Actor Award at the 1987 Chicago International Film Festival. Commenting upon this unusual venture, Dennehy said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been in a lot of movies but this is the first film I&#x27;ve made.&quot;

He went on to star as Harrison in the Australian film &quot;The Man from Snowy River II&quot; in 1988.

<text>The S Group (, ) is a Finnish retailing cooperative organisation with its head office in Helsinki. Founded in 1904, it consists of 19 regional cooperatives operating all around Finland in addition to SOK, &quot;Suomen Osuuskauppojen Keskuskunta&quot; (The Central Finnish Cooperative Society). S Group operates in the markets for groceries, consumer durables, service station, hotel and restaurant services. It is engaged in close competition with Kesko, with which it shares an oligopolistic position in many of the markets it operates in. 

The group has businesses in Finland and Estonia. The S Group also had businesses in Latvia and Lithuania, but announced withdrawal from these markets in May 2017. It also withdrew from the Russian market in 2022.

The organisation&#x27;s member (loyalty) card is called &quot;S-Etukortti&quot;.

== Ownership ==
A client can invest a small sum on the local co-operative and become a client-owner. (The exact sum is decided by the local co-operative board and varies significantly depending on local conditions.) A client-owner gets a membership card, &quot;S-Etukortti&quot;, which functions as a debit or credit card and gives access to special client-owner bargains. For the sums spent in S Group stores, &quot;Bonus&quot; is paid back to the client into the account at S-Bank. The &quot;Bonus&quot; percentage varies from 1% to 5% depending on the sum spent. S-Bank pays an interest that is competitive with interests paid by general banks into savings accounts. &quot;S-Etukortti&quot; is not a regular &quot;loyalty card&quot; as it represents actual monetary investment and the return is formally profit, not discount.

== Corporate ==
In 2012, 35 Members of Parliament were representatives in the S Group or Tradeka (Siwa) corporate governance.

== Local co-operatives ==
The S Group consists of 19 regional co-operative enterprises and 7 local co-operative enterprises. In total, these had 2.4 million individual members in 2018, a number that has grown from 1.2 million in 2003. In 2018, 329 million euros of &quot;Bonus&quot; was paid.

== Supermarkets ==
The S Group operates five distinct chains of supermarkets:
* &quot;Sale&quot; – a chain of small grocery stores, mainly located in the countryside, small towns and suburbs with an emphasis on service rather than selection. Sale stores often only provide everyday groceries. There are about 240 Sale stores in Finland.
* &quot;Alepa&quot; – this is the equivalent for &quot;Sale&quot; in the Greater Helsinki region – there are about 110 Alepa stores in Helsinki and the neighbouring cities.
* &quot;S-market&quot; – larger supermarkets with a better selection of goods for sale, and often providing additional services. This is the largest of the S Group&#x27;s supermarket chains, with nearly 400 stores around Finland. According to HOK-Elanto cooperative, Klaukkala would get another S-market in addition to the existing one, but it will become the largest S-market to match its size and product range with &quot;Prisma&quot;.
* &quot;Prisma&quot; – a hypermarket chain with about 90 stores around Finland and Estonia in major cities. Formerly, the chain also operated in Latvia, Lithuania and Russia.
*Food Market Herkku - premier food market operating in the Finnish metropolitan area (Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa), Oulu, Tampere and Turku.

The largest sales revenues are from S-market&#x27;s (49%) and from Prisma&#x27;s 39%.

The S Group&#x27;s supermarkets retail the general private brands &quot;Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Kotimaista&quot; for products made in Finland, and the no-frills &quot;X-tra&quot; range in partnership with Coop Trading — a Nordic purchasing organisation for co-operatives. Non-food products are marketed under the &quot;House&quot; name. 

The S Group has grown significantly in Finland in recent years, growing both organically and by acquisition.

== Modernist architecture ==

SOK has a key position in the history of Finnish architecture due to its policy in the late 1920s and 1930s of designing cutting-edge Modernist architecture, epitomized by a Functionalist aesthetic of white buildings. The style is called &quot;osuuskauppafunkis&quot; (Co-operative Store Functionalism) in Finland. The key architect designing for SOK in the initial years was Erkki Huttunen (1901–1956), who designed various types of buildings for the company: from grain silos and mills to local village shops. Among his best-known works for SOK are the Toppila mill (1929, &quot;pictured right&quot;), the SOK Offices and Warehouse (1937-38) in Oulu, the SOK Offices and Warehouse (1931) in Rauma, and the Aitta Cooperative Shop (1933) in Sauvo. Today, many of these buildings are protected by law.

== Other fields ==
The S Group also operates the &quot;Sokos&quot; chain of department stores, &quot;ABC&quot; service stations, the hotel chain &quot;Sokos Hotels&quot;, several brands of restaurants such as &quot;Rosso&quot;, &quot;Sevilla&quot; and &quot;Amarillo&quot;, the &quot;Agrimarket&quot; chain, which sells agricultural and DIY supplies, and a number of car dealerships for Peugeot.

== S-Bank ==
The S Group operates Finland&#x27;s first so-called &quot;supermarket bank&quot;, the S-Bank (S-Pankki Oy).

<doc id="1067331" wikidata="Q5126319" url="?curid=1067331" title="Claremont Landscape Garden">
<text>Claremont Landscape Garden, just outside Esher, Surrey, England, is one of the earliest surviving gardens of its kind of landscape design, the English Landscape Garden — still featuring its original 18th-century layout. The garden is Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. 

==History==
Originally created for Claremont House, it represents the work of some of the best known landscape gardeners, such as Charles Bridgeman, Capability Brown, William Kent and Sir John Vanbrugh.

Work on the gardens began around 1715 and by 1727 they were described as &quot;the noblest of any in Europe&quot;. Within the grounds, overlooking the lake, is an unusual-turfed amphitheatre, which used to form the centrepiece of an annual event called the Claremont Fête champêtre. Hundreds of visitors descended on Claremont, most in costume (each year has a different theme) to enjoy four days of music, theatre and fireworks.

==Stewardship==
Also within the grounds is the Belvedere Tower, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh for the Duke of Newcastle. The tower is unusual in that what appear to be windows, are actually bricks painted black and white. It is now owned by Claremont Fan Court School, which is situated alongside the gardens.

In 1949 the landscape garden was donated to the National Trust for stewardship and protection. Initially it was managed by Esher Urban District Council, who could do little more than basic maintenance and grass-cutting. In 1974, the National Trust took back control of the site and a pioneering restoration programme was launched in 1975 following a significant donation by the Slater Foundation.

==Gallery==
==Transport==
The entrance to the garden is directly off the A307, Portsmouth Road. Buses from Kingston on Thames, Esher and Guildford stop nearby. The road originally ran closer to the lake but Robert Clive had it moved further north to its present alignment in 1771.

<doc id="1067338" wikidata="Q348436" url="?curid=1067338" title="Naoki Urasawa">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist and musician. He has been drawing manga since he was four years old, and for most of his professional career has created two series simultaneously. The stories to many of these were co-written in collaboration with his former editor, Takashi Nagasaki. Urasawa has been called one of the artists that changed the history of manga and has won numerous awards, including the Shogakukan Manga Award three times, the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize twice, and the Kodansha Manga Award once. South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho called him &quot;the greatest storyteller of our time&quot;, while Dominican-American writer Junot Díaz proclaimed Urasawa to be a national treasure in Japan. By December 2021, his various works had over 140 million copies in circulation worldwide, making him one of the best-selling authors of all time.

Urasawa&#x27;s first major work was illustrating the action series &quot;Pineapple Army&quot; (1985–1988), which was written by Kazuya Kudo. The first serial that he wrote and illustrated himself, and his first major success, was the sports manga &quot;Yawara!&quot; (1986–1993). He then illustrated the adventure series &quot;Master Keaton&quot; (1988–1994), which was written by Hokusei Katsushika and Nagasaki, and created the sports manga &quot;Happy!&quot; (1993–1999). The thriller &quot;Monster&quot; (1994–2001) was his first to receive international acclaim and success, which continued with the science fiction mystery &quot;20th Century Boys&quot; (1999–2006). Following the acclaimed &quot;Pluto&quot; (2003–2009), which is a re-imagining of &quot;Astro Boy&quot; by Osamu Tezuka, one of Urasawa&#x27;s biggest influences, he and Nagasaki created the mystery series &quot;Billy Bat&quot; (2008–2016). After two short series, a sequel to &quot;Master Keaton&quot; with Nagasaki and &quot;&quot;, Urasawa began his currently ongoing &quot;Asadora!&quot; in 2018.

==Early life==
Urasawa cited Osamu Tezuka as one of his heroes, being particularly fond of his manga &quot;Phoenix&quot;. &quot;The Greatest Robot on Earth&quot; and &quot;The Artificial Sun&quot; arcs of Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Astro Boy&quot; were his first experiences with manga at four or five years old. Around that same age is when he started to draw manga, and at eight he created his first complete story. Even at a young age, Urasawa saw the gulf between his work and that of a &quot;real manga artist.&quot; He said that he could also identify manga that was &quot;commercialized&quot; and made just for the money, something he did not want to do. Thus he never thought of becoming a professional manga artist, and graduated from Meisei University with a degree in economics.

==Career==
===Debut and success: 1982–2009===
When Urasawa visited Shogakukan to apply for a business job, he decided to bring some manga he had drawn out of curiosity. An editor from &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; did not give him the time of day, but the head editor of &quot;Big Comic Original&quot; happened to walk by and felt the work was better suited for &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot;, and took Urasawa to their editorial department. He ended up submitting manga for their 1982 New Manga Artist Award, which his unpublished work &quot;Return&quot; won. It was only then that he thought about becoming a professional manga artist. It was a year after winning the award that Urasawa met Takashi Nagasaki, who would become his longtime editor and collaborator.

After working as an assistant for Toshio Nobe, Urasawa made his professional debut in 1983 with &quot;Beta!&quot;, which was published in a special issue of &quot;Golgo 13&quot;. He then created the short serialized work &quot;Dancing Policeman&quot; the following year. Urasawa began his first major serialized work, &quot;Pineapple Army&quot;, in 1985 in the semimonthly &quot;Big Comic Original&quot;. He was the illustrator of the series, while Kazuya Kudo was its writer. It ended in 1988 and was collected into eight &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. While working on &quot;Pineapple Army&quot;, Urasawa began &quot;Yawara!&quot; in the weekly &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot; in 1986 which he wrote and illustrated himself. It earned him the 1989 Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category. That same year it was adapted into a live-action film and an anime television series. It ended in 1993 and was collected into 29 volumes.

When &quot;Pineapple Army&quot; ended, Urasawa began &quot;Master Keaton&quot; for &quot;Big Comic Original&quot; in November 1988. He illustrated it, while Hokusei Katsushika wrote it. It ended in August 1994 and was collected into 18 volumes. An anime television adaptation began in 1998, before finishing as an original video animation in 2000. Likewise when &quot;Yawara!&quot; ended, Urasawa began another solo series in &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot;. &quot;Happy!&quot; ran from 1993 until 1999 and was collected into 23 volumes. It was adapted into two live-action television films in 2006.

Following &quot;Master Keaton&quot;″s end, Urasawa began &quot;Monster&quot; in &quot;Big Comic Original&quot; in December 1994. It earned him the 1999 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize, and his second Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 2001. It ended in December 2001, was collected into 18 volumes, and adapted into an anime television series in 2004. Junot Díaz, Pulitzer Prize for Fiction winner, praised &quot;Monster&quot; and proclaimed &quot;Urasawa is a national treasure in Japan.&quot; With &quot;Happy!&quot;″s ending, Urasawa began &quot;20th Century Boys&quot; in &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot; in 1999. It earned him the 2001 Kodansha Manga Award in the General category, and his third Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 2002. It ended in 2006 and was collected into 22 volumes. The story briefly continued as &quot;21st Century Boys&quot; in 2007, which was collected into two volumes. &quot;20th Century Boys&quot; was adapted into three live-action films, which were released in 2008 and 2009.

While working on &quot;20th Century Boys&quot;, Urasawa began adapting &quot;The Greatest Robot on Earth&quot; story arc of Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Astro Boy&quot; into the series &quot;Pluto&quot;. It was serialized in &quot;Big Comic Original&quot; from September 9, 2003, to April 5, 2009, and collected into 8 volumes. It earned him his second Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize. In 2008, Urasawa began working for Kodansha, serializing &quot;Billy Bat&quot; in &quot;Morning&quot;. It ran from October 16, 2008, to August 18, 2016, and was collected into 20 volumes. Also in 2008, Urasawa and Nagasaki took guest teaching posts at Nagoya Zokei University, where they taught &quot;Modern Expression Course: Manga Classes&quot; two to three times a year, although the class met every month. Initially planned for only five students, he agreed to expand it to fifteen in an effort to create more &quot;real artists.&quot;

===2010–2019===
Oricon held a poll on the Mangaka that Changed the History of Manga in 2010, &quot;mangaka&quot; being the Japanese word for a manga artist, and Urasawa came in tenth. In 2011, Urasawa illustrated a picture book adaptation of Kosuke Hamada&#x27;s story &quot;Red Oni Cries&quot;.
Urasawa began writing a sequel to &quot;Master Keaton&quot; in 2012 titled &quot;Master Keaton Remaster&quot;. When asked why he went back to a series after so many years, Urasawa stated it was because with the original series he had a hard time making the story he wanted due to contractual obligation, and because people affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami said they had enjoyed the series, so he wanted to do something for them. Beginning in the March 2012 issue of &quot;Big Comic Original&quot; it finished in 2014 and was collected into a single volume. As a guest at the 2012 Japan Expo in France, Urasawa talked about how he entered the manga industry, gave a live drawing demonstration, and performed two songs as a musician, and joined rock band Hemenway on stage the following day.

Between 2013 and 2014, Urasawa contributed to the essay series &quot;The Old Guys&quot; that was published in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Jump X&quot; magazine. His contributions and those of the other 32 writers who participated were collected into a July 2015 volume of the same name. In August 2013, Urasawa created his first &quot;monster manga&quot; titled &quot;Kaiju Kingdom&quot;, a 41-page one-shot published in &quot;Big Comic&quot;. Urasawa is the host of the NHK Educational TV documentary series &quot;Urasawa Naoki no Manben&quot;, which focuses on a different manga artist each episode and explores their individual styles. He coined the word &quot;manben&quot; from his childhood; his parents and grandparents used to tell him, &quot;Don&#x27;t draw &quot;man&quot;ga all day! You need to &quot;ben&quot;kyō (study), too!&quot;. It began as a one-off special in November 2014, a first season was launched in September 2015, a second in March 2016, a third in September 2016, and a fourth in March 2017. After three years, the show returned in October 2020 with &quot;Neo&quot; added to the end of its title. The show won the December 2015 Planning Award as part of Quick Japan&#x27;s annual TV of the Year awards, decided by broadcast writers. The June 9, 2021, episode on Yoshikazu Yasuhiko won the Grand Prize in the entertainment category at the 2022 Japan Media Arts Festival. Beginning in July 2015, Urasawa started contributing to the &quot;Musica Nostra&quot; column series that was published in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Grand Jump&quot; magazine.

An art exhibition of Urasawa&#x27;s work was on display in Tokyo from January 16 to March 31, 2016, before moving to Osaka from November 26 to January 25, 2017. It included illustrations, manga manuscripts, story notes, and childhood manga. Urasawa contributed a short, full color, left-to-right manga titled &quot;Tanshin Funin/Solo Mission&quot; to the February 2016 French comics anthology &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; to commemorate publisher Humanoids&#x27; 40th anniversary. Re-titled &quot;Turning Point&quot;, the anthology was published in Japan in September 2017. He created a short three-page manga about 1960s British rock band the Beatles time-traveling to 2016. Released in June 2016 on the website of Tokyo radio station InterFM897, it coincides with the TV program &quot;KKBOX Here comes The Beatles&quot; and celebrates the 50th anniversary of the band&#x27;s visit to Japan.

On April 9, 2017, Urasawa began co-hosting a radio program with actor and comedian Junji Takada. &quot;Junji and Naoki&quot; airs Sundays at 5pm on Nippon Cultural Broadcasting and features both men talking about their lives, professions, and favorite hobbies. That year Urasawa also began the limited series &quot;&quot; in a collaboration with France&#x27;s Louvre Museum. It began in &quot;Big Comic Original&quot; in October 2017 and ended on February 20, 2018.

In January 2018, Urasawa attended the 45th Angoulême International Comics Festival in France, where he received the Fauve Special Award and the Fauve Polar SNCF Special Award for mystery. The festival also held an art exhibit of his work, before it moved to Paris from February 13 to March 31. Urasawa was the subject of the June 23 Wowow Prime TV program &quot;Nonfiction W Urasawa Naoki ~Tensai Mangaka no Owaranai Tabi~&quot;, which followed him around Europe, including to the 2018 Angoulême International Comics Festival and meeting Klaus Voormann in Germany. Urasawa began &quot;Asadora!&quot; in &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot; on October 6, 2018. South Korean film director Bong Joon-ho called Urasawa &quot;the greatest storyteller of our time&quot; and likened the experience of reading &quot;Asadora!&quot; to that of being able to go back and read &quot;20th Century Boys&quot; for the first time again. The November 2018 issue of &quot;Monthly Big Comic Spirits&quot;, released on September 27, was given the special title &quot;Urasawa Jack&quot;. It included Urasawa&#x27;s one-shot &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&quot;, which adapted a story told to him by musician Kenji Endo, an interview between him and Shigeru Izumiya, and a calendar featuring illustrations of &quot;beautiful women&quot; by the artist. On December 27, Urasawa co-hosted a special radio program about Osamu Tezuka alongside Chiaki Kuriyama for Nippon Cultural Broadcasting.

In 2019, he designed the official posters of the 2019 Osaka Women&#x27;s Marathon and a classic car charity event organized by Toshiaki Karasawa for reconstruction after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. On January 23, 2019, Japan House Los Angeles presented the first North American exhibit of Urasawa&#x27;s work, titled &quot;This is MANGA – the Art of NAOKI URASAWA&quot;. The exhibit ran until March 28, 2019, and featured more than 400 original drawings and storyboards. Urasawa participated in an artist discussion and book signing on opening day. The exhibit moved to Japan House London from June 5 to July 28, also attended by the artist. Urasawa was a 2019 nominee for entry into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame.

===2020–present===
In 2020, Urasawa drew advertisements for the Samsonite Red luggage brand, and was chosen to create one of the official posters for the 2020 Summer Olympics. For the second year in a row, he drew the poster for the Osaka Women&#x27;s Marathon. In June, Urasawa created the cover portrait for Universal Japan&#x27;s 250th anniversary release of music by Ludwig van Beethoven. He also appears in July 2020&#x27;s &quot;ZK/Zunō Keisatsu 50 Mirai e no Kodō&quot;, a documentary film about the rock band Zunō Keisatsu. Urasawa directed and illustrated the music video, and illustrated the cover art, for Kazuyoshi Saito&#x27;s March 2021 digital single &quot;Boy&quot;. In November 2021, Urasawa&#x27;s first one-shot for Shueisha, &quot;Dr. Toguro Dokuro no Saigo&quot;, was published in &quot;Grand Jump&quot; to celebrate the magazine&#x27;s 10th anniversary. By December 2021, his various works had over 140 million copies in circulation worldwide. He had an acting role in the December 2022 film &quot;The Flower in the Sky&quot;, portraying poet Haruo Satō.

==Style==

Fusanosuke Natsume said that prior to entering university, Urasawa&#x27;s style showed influence from Shinji Nagashima and Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s 1970s work, but went on to claim that in 1979 it became aligned with that of Katsuhiro Otomo. Due to his skill at structuring panel layouts, Kazuhiko Torishima cited Urasawa as the true successor to Tezuka. When talking in 1997 about the future of manga, Urasawa opined that &quot;Tezuka created the form that exists today, then caricatures appeared next, and comics changed again when Katsuhiro Otomo came on the scene. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any room left for further changes.&quot; He has also expressed admiration for French &quot;bande dessinée&quot; artist Moebius and American novelist Stephen King. Although Urasawa&#x27;s works like &quot;Yawara!&quot; had light entertainment with cute young girls, Natsume says Urasawa developed his own personal style with &quot;Monster&quot;, which he described as realistic, or directorially based, with cinematic panel layouts similar to Otomo and gekiga artists. Natsume also noted that many of his characters resemble famous movie stars. Urasawa himself described his approach to manga as similar to storyboarding a movie, and acknowledged his work as adult-oriented, stating that even as a child he never liked manga aimed at children. However, he noted that he and Otomo both prefer to have their work called manga and not gekiga.

When asked where he gets ideas from, Urasawa said &quot;I have been illustrating all my life. Inspiration is everywhere, when I get in the bath, when I get out. It&#x27;s whether you are perceiving these ideas and whether you are able to catch them.&quot; He also said that he does not worry about what the readers want, and simply draws stories that he finds interesting. The artist said that while manga is often looked at as simple, he makes sure to use subtleties to show dramatic expressions and convey emotion, claiming &quot;You won&#x27;t find two expressions that are the same&quot; in his work.

On his storytelling process, Urasawa states, &quot;When I start a new project, I start with the larger arc of the story. I visualize a movie trailer for that story, and after I compose this movie trailer in my mind, there comes a point where I&#x27;m so excited about it that I have to write the story. And then I imagine, &#x27;Where do I start to begin to tell this narrative?&#x27; and that&#x27;s usually the first chapter.&quot; He does not plan the story out in advance, claiming that it tells him where it wants to go, and that if the story does not keep surprising even him, then he can not continue making it.

He also does not determine the page or panel layouts in advance. Having drawn manga for over five decades, he just follows his instincts, explaining &quot;When I start to structure a story narratively, the question of tempo — developing a character moment-to-moment and then jumping to a two-page spread — how do you determine where that happens? It&#x27;s like breathing to me — I know when it feels right.&quot;

For most of his career, Urasawa has written two different series simultaneously. With one of them being a weekly serialization and the other having a semimonthly schedule, Urasawa had six deadlines a month and said the only time off he had was when sleeping or eating. Urasawa frequently collaborates with manga editor and author Takashi Nagasaki, to the point where Nagasaki has been called his &quot;producer.&quot; The two met when Nagasaki was made Urasawa&#x27;s editor upon his debut. Although the two continue to collaborate even after Nagasaki became freelance, they rarely socialize outside of work. Urasawa said that following the anime adaptation of &quot;Yawara!&quot;, he has requested that he be able to check the scripts for any adaptation of his works. Until 2018&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Asadora!&quot;, none of Urasawa&#x27;s manga had ever been legally available in digital formats. The author stated that he prefers physical books. However, his earlier works began receiving digital releases in 2022, limited to Japan.

==Music==

Urasawa is also a musician. He stated &quot;A lot of artists really struggled to decide whether to become manga artists or rock musicians, so the two are intertwined, they&#x27;re synonymous!&quot; Urasawa started playing guitar in junior high school inspired by folk rock singer-songwriters Takuro Yoshida and Bob Dylan.

Urasawa wrote and performed the song , which was released on a CD included in the 2002 first pressing of volume 11 of &quot;20th Century Boys&quot;. He released the limited single on June 4, 2008, and his debut album on November 29, 2008. Both were produced by Koji Wakui, while the album features Hiroyuki Namba and other musicians. A single featuring a remix of T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; and Urasawa&#x27;s &quot;Bob Lennon (Kenji no Uta)&quot; was released on August 19, 2009. Urasawa and Mitsuru Kuramoto wrote and performed under the name to be the theme of the 2011 NTT Docomo TV show &quot;Tsubuyaki Sanshirō ~Ippon Nau!~&quot;. In 2012 he performed a Japanese cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; and &quot;Guta Lala Suda Lala&quot; from his series &quot;20th Century Boys&quot; at the Japan Expo, and the following day he joined rock band Hemenway on stage.

Urasawa&#x27;s second album, which he wrote and produced himself, was released in 2016. Urasawa wrote a demo for a song titled and sent it to musician Mike Viola, who finished the track and invited Urasawa to Los Angeles to play on it. The people playing on the song are Urasawa, Viola, drummer Jim Keltner, and Mitsuru Kuramoto. It is included on the album &quot;The Best of Mike Viola&quot; which was released on January 22, 2020, with the performance credited to Monaka. In 2020, Urasawa was one of many people who submitted lyrics that were adopted by Sunplaza Nakano-kun into a new version of Bakufu Slump&#x27;s 1984 song . Urasawa&#x27;s third album, &quot;Love Songs&quot;, will be released on February 26, 2025. It includes a new version of , the theme song to his TV show &quot;Urasawa Naoki no Manben Neo&quot;, that features Tetsuya Komuro, &quot;It&#x27;s Because I Love You&quot; from his manga series &quot;Asadora!&quot;, &quot;Mr. Postman&quot; featuring Lenny Castro, and &quot;Rainbow Child&quot; featuring Miu Sakamoto.

<doc id="1067339" wikidata="Q203424" url="?curid=1067339" title="Milton, New Zealand">
<text>Milton, formerly known as Tokomairiro or Tokomairaro, is a town of over 2,000 people, located on State Highway 1, 50 kilometres to the south of Dunedin in Otago, New Zealand. It lies on the floodplain of the Tokomairaro River (until 2016 called the &quot;Tokomairiro&quot;), one branch of which loops past the north and south ends of the town. This river gives its name to many local features, notably the town&#x27;s only secondary school, Tokomairiro High School.

Founded as a milling town in the 1850s, there has long been dispute as to the naming of the settlement. The town&#x27;s streets are named for prominent British poets, and it is possible that the town&#x27;s original intended name of Milltown became shortened by association with the poet of the same name. It is equally possible, however, that the name Milton inspired the choice of poets&#x27; names for the streets.

==History==
Milton&#x27;s early history was strongly affected by the discovery of gold by Gabriel Read at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully close to the nearby township of Lawrence. As Milton stood close to one of the most easily accessible routes to the interior, it grew greatly during the goldrush years of the 1860s and was a major staging post for prospectors heading for the goldfields.

The town was originally established at Fairfax, a settlement nestling at the foot of the hills which lie to the southeast of the town. As communication with the goldfields in the interior became more important, and the desirability of the town becoming a staging post increased, it spread down onto the plains around the river. A Gothic church, Tokomairiro Presbyterian Church, was built at this time by the architect R A Lawson. At the time of its construction, this church was the tallest building at such a southern latitude in the world. The church is still the town&#x27;s most obvious landmark, and is visible across the Tokomairiro Plains from several kilometres away. It was located as a terminating vista at the end of the main road connecting Fairfax with the main route south from Dunedin to the goldfields, and as such is an imposing structure dominating this road. Milton was an important town in early Otago – much more so than it is today – mainly due to its location on the route to the goldfields, and also for the Bruce Woollen Mills, which were among the province&#x27;s largest factories. Other prominent industries included the Kiwi Bacon Factory, which had a branch in Milton until the early 1980s. The town&#x27;s importance in communication in the early years of New Zealand settlement is emphasised by it being one of the two centres first linked by long-distance telephony, with a pioneering line set up between Milton and Dunedin in February 1878. It was not until the early twentieth century that it was superseded in size by the now considerably larger local town of Balclutha. The town was also important in education in early Otago – the Tokomairiro School – now split into Tokoiti School (still on the site of the original school) and Tokomairiro High School – was founded in 1856, only eight years after the founding of the province itself, and was one of the province&#x27;s leading schools for many years thereafter. Electric lighting was installed in 1919.

=== Railway ===
Milton was connected to the national railway network in the early 1870s when the Main South Line was built through the town and goods were first carried in October 1874. The official opening from Green Island to Balclutha was on 1 September 1875. Milton station was east of Clarksville, south of Milburn, from Christchurch and from Dunedin.

In 1907, the town became a railway junction when an extension of the Roxburgh Branch was constructed alongside the Main South Line from its original junction at nearby Clarksville into Milton to facilitate better operations. In 1960, Milton lost this status when the extension was removed and the Roxburgh Branch&#x27;s junction reverted to being in Clarksville. The Main South Line still runs through the town, though the station closed to passengers on 1 December 1970, when the South Island Limited was replaced by the Southerner, which didn&#x27;t stop at Milton.

Milton had an engine shed for two engines, a passenger platform (later extended to ), a 3rd class station, cart approach to the platform, by goods shed, loading bank, cattle yards, stationmaster&#x27;s house, a refreshment room from 1895 to 1957 and a bookstall from 1897.

A turntable was added in 1927. There were fires at the engine shed in 1938 and in 1959, when both A Class locomotives in the shed were undamaged. There was also a fire at the station in 1942, and in a large shed in 1944.

The stockyards closed in 1971. In December 1988 there was still a station building, verandah, platforms and goods sheds, as can be seen in a 1986 aerial photo, but by 1995 they had gone.
==== Fortification and Waronui coal mines and railway line ====
Coal was dug in the lower Tokomairaro valley from 1855. A railway was considered as early as 1875. Mining near Fortification Hill started in 1882. Poor roads and difficult navigation of the river limited production. The Fortification Railway and Coal Company started building a railway in 1900 and opened it on 3 April 1901, but went into liquidation in 1903. In 1906 the Bruce Coal Company Ltd opened a new mine across the river, calling it Waronui. A temporary bridge was built over the river, until the railway was extended about to the new mine when Glendining and Co took over in 1908. The line ran south west, crossing the Tokomairaro River a few times, from Milton, for about to mines at Fortification and Waronui. The line was little used after two miners were killed in 1930 and it was sold for scrap in 1932.

===Milton pottery===
An early claim to fame for Milton was its pottery, often regarded as some of the country&#x27;s finest. Clay is a plentiful natural resource in South Otago, and potteries were a major employer in the late 19th century throughout South Otago and Southland. Between 1873 and 1915 numerous pottery works operated from the Milton area, starting with William White&#x27;s short-lived Tokomairiro Steam Pottery Works, reputedly the first industrial kilns in the Southern Hemisphere.

The Milton Pottery works was rescued in 1880 by former Mayor of Dunedin (1876) Charles Reeves. The industry reached its height in the 1880s, at which time five kilns were operating and over 40 staff were employed, producing building materials such as bricks and tiles, sanitary ceramics such as washbasins, and domestic and decorative dinner sets, vases, and jars.

The industry in Milton did not survive the loss of manpower during World War I, though pottery as an industry continued in South Otago at Benhar near Balclutha, which was a major producer of toilet bowls and other domestic ceramics until the 1990s.
=== Bruce Herald ===
&quot;The Bruce Herald&quot; was established by Joseph Mackay in 1864 and was one of the longest running country newspapers, closing on 7 October 1971. It was one of a chain, including the &quot;Mataura Ensign&quot; at Gore and &quot;Clutha Times&quot; at Balclutha. Other local papers were the &quot;Bruce Independent&quot; (1866–1867) and the &quot;Milton Mirror&quot; in 1905, but was taken over by the &quot;Herald&quot; after a fire at its office in 1910.

== Demographics ==
Milton covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Milton had a population of 2,157 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 87 people (4.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 111 people (5.4%) since the 2006 census. There were 861 households, comprising 1,086 males and 1,068 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.02 males per female. The median age was 42.9 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 429 people (19.9%) aged under 15 years, 333 (15.4%) aged 15 to 29, 945 (43.8%) aged 30 to 64, and 447 (20.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 87.8% European/Pākehā, 17.8% Māori, 1.7% Pasifika, 1.9% Asian, and 1.8% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 8.3, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 56.1% had no religion, 33.4% were Christian, 0.4% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.3% were Hindu, 0.1% were Muslim, 0.1% were Buddhist and 1.8% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 123 (7.1%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 591 (34.2%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $26,800, compared with $31,800 nationally. 150 people (8.7%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 816 (47.2%) people were employed full-time, 252 (14.6%) were part-time, and 54 (3.1%) were unemployed.

==Modern Milton==
Today, Milton is, after Balclutha, the second largest town in South Otago. Its form is largely a ribbon development along the main highway (State Highway 1), with an extension north of the northern branch of the river (the suburb of Helensbrook). The old town of Fairfax is now a village with the Māori name of Tokoiti (meaning &quot;small poles&quot;). SH1, as Union Street, is the town&#x27;s main road. Five main residential streets run parallel with Union Street (Elderlee, Ajax, Spenser, Johnson, and Chaucer Streets), with these streets being connected by other roads together forming a mostly regular grid pattern. Tokoiti lies one kilometre to the southeast.

Milton&#x27;s main economic livelihood is as a service town for the surrounding farming community, although forestry is also becoming of increasing importance. It is also home to Calder Stewart, one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest construction firms.

The farming settlement of Milburn two kilometres north of Milton, was chosen as the site of a new prison, opened in 2007 with a capacity of 485 prisoners. Officially referred to simply as the Otago Corrections Facility, it quickly picked up the nickname of &quot;The Milton Hilton&quot;.

==&quot;The Kink&quot;==

In Milton there is an unusual planning anomaly – the main street (Union Street) is straight for several kilometres as it runs across the Tokomairaro Plain and through the town, yet in the northern part of Milton it has a kink in it at . Heading north on the main street the road moves a whole road-width to the west.

The reason for the anomaly is disputed. A widely accepted view, but not the official view, states that the road was set out by two surveyors, one moving north and the other moving south, each of whom set out the road to the right of their survey line. Another widely held belief is that the change of course was designed to protect a large tree which formerly stood at the site where the kink is. However, why during the development of a milling area a single tree would be protected, and why the road would not return to its original line after passing the tree are both unexplained by this theory.

A story on the Kink was run by Stuff on 6 May 2021.

== In popular culture ==
Michael Palin describes Milton in his 1997 book Full Circle as a &quot;small inconspicuous town&quot;. He goes on to say &quot;Yet nowhere has looked more like Britain. A gothic spire rises from a red brick parish church. There is a Salvation Army hostel, A Cosy Dell rest home and an advert for &#x27;Frosty Boy&#x27; lollipops – &#x27;Often Licked, Never Beaten&#x27;. The gardens, and fields beyond could be straight from my Yorkshire birthplace. At around the time of my birth.&quot;

<doc id="1067344" wikidata="Q1072946" url="?curid=1067344" title="Chili powder">
<text>Chili powder (also spelledchile, chilli, or, alternatively, powdered chili) is the dried, pulverized fruit of one or more varieties of chili pepper, sometimes with the addition of other spices (in which case it is also sometimes known as chili powder blend or chili seasoning mix). It is used as a spice (or spice blend) to add pungency (piquancy) and flavor to culinary dishes. In American English, the spelling is usually &quot;chili&quot;; in British English, &quot;chilli&quot; (with two &quot;l&quot;s) is used consistently.

Chili powder is used in many different cuisines, including American (particularly Tex-Mex), Chinese, Indian, Bangladeshi, Korean, Mexican, Portuguese, and Thai.

== Varieties ==

Chili powder is sometimes known by the specific type of chili pepper used. Varieties of chili peppers used to make chili powder include Aleppo, ancho, cayenne, chipotle, chile de árbol, jalapeño, New Mexico, pasilla, and piri piri chili peppers. &quot;Gochugaru&quot; is a variety used in Korean cuisine traditionally made from sun-dried Korean red chili peppers known as &quot;taeyang-cho&quot;, with spicier varieties using Cheongyang peppers. Kashmiri chili powder is bright red, but mild in heat and used in Indian cuisine, named after the region of Kashmir.

== Blends ==
Chili powder blends are composed chiefly of chili peppers and blended with other spices including cumin, onion, garlic powder, and sometimes salt. The chilis are most commonly red chili peppers; &quot;hot&quot; varieties usually also include cayenne pepper. As a result of the varying recipes used, the spiciness of any given chili powder is variable.

The first commercial blends of chili powder in the U.S. were created by D.C. Pendery and William Gebhardt for chili con carne. Gebhardt opened Miller&#x27;s Saloon in New Braunfels, Texas. Chili was the town&#x27;s favorite dish. However, chili peppers could only be found at certain times of the year. Gebhardt imported some ancho peppers from Mexico and ran the peppers through a small meat grinder three times and created the first commercial chili powder in 1894.

== Chili in food ==

Chili powder is very commonly seen in traditional Latin American and Asian cuisine. It is used in soups, tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, curries and meat.

Chili can also be found in sauces and curry bases, such as chili con carne. Chili sauce can be used to marinate and season things such as meat.

Chili powder blend is the primary flavor in American chili con carne.

<doc id="1067351" wikidata="Q3184081" url="?curid=1067351" title="José Miguel Arroyo Delgado">
<text>José Miguel Arroyo Delgado (born May 1, 1969) is a Spanish bullfighter. He is better known in bullfighting circles as Joselito, a nickname he shares with at least two other notables: José Gomez, the Joselito bullfighter of the 1910s, and Joselito, a teen idol singer from the 1960s.

==Biography==
Arroyo Delgado was born in Madrid. He grew up in a poor family, dreaming about fame and wealth as a bullfighter. He became a professional bullfighter in Seville at the early age of sixteen. He went on to triumph in Mexico as well as in his native country. In Mexico, he was awarded a bull&#x27;s tail, the top award given to a &quot;torero&quot; there.
Arroyo Delgado himself admits to being one of the most battered bullfighters of his generation. In 1989 he sustained his worst injury, when he was hit by a bull and required hospitalization. In 1996 he came close to another serious injury, when he faced a bull in France: he was not fighting well that day and he was close to losing to a bull. He won the encounter, but thought seriously about retiring. Arroyo Delgado has been a controversial bullfighter in Spain: he is known for his dislike of uniforms, whether military or &quot;torero&quot;, although he does use his &quot;torero&quot; uniform. He was also both widely criticized and praised by the Spanish public for refusing to dedicate a bull to King Juan Carlos de Bourbon, dedicating it instead to his friend, &quot;El Bote&quot;, a fellow bullfighter who had just been hospitalized after an encounter with a bull.

Arroyo Delgado is equally controversial in Spain for his religious views: although he claims to be a Catholic, he has also declared that, had he been born in another country, his God would have been either Allah or Buddha. Arroyo Delgado never prays before his fights, although this is a tradition for bullfighters in Spain, a country that has an overwhelming Catholic majority.

Arroyo Delgado is the owner of a cattle ranch. He is the adoptive son of Enrique Martin Arranz and his wife Adela. Arroyo Delgado&#x27;s natural father died in 1981.

<doc id="1067355" wikidata="Q7839409" url="?curid=1067355" title="Trevor Rogers (politician)">
<text>Trevor Vicemar Rogers (born 18 August 1943 in Auckland) is a former New Zealand member of parliament, sitting for the National Party from 1990 to 1995, then for the Right of Centre party from 1995 to 1996.

==Member of Parliament==

Rogers was first a member of parliament for the National Party, having previously been on several Auckland local bodies; an Auckland City Councillor 1977–1989, a member of the Auckland Regional Authority 1983–1986, and on the No 2 District Roads Council 1983–1987. In 1986, he put himself forward for the National Party nomination in the Auckland electorate of Eden. Up against three other nominees (David Phillips, Jock Parbhu and Hiwi Tauroa) he was unsuccessful.

In the 1990 election he took the Otara seat beating Taito Phillip Field, who had replaced the retiring MP Colin Moyle as the Labour candidate for the seat. He had previously stood for the Otara seat in 1987. In the 1993 election he won the new Howick seat, which comprised the eastern part of the old Otara seat.

He gained considerable public recognition for his crusade against pornography and for the open access to children studying on home computers. He wanted programs such as &quot;Net Nanny&quot; to be available and even compulsory in the home. Open access on the internet he saw as facilitating the distribution of pornography to minors. In 1994 he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill, the &quot;Technology and Crimes Reform Bill&quot;. A select committee recommended against its enactment and it was defeated in the house.

On 8 June 1995, Rogers quit the National Party, having become increasingly frustrated with its refusal to pursue his policies. He joined the Right of Centre, which had been founded by another dissident conservative, Ross Meurant. The Right of Centre party restyled itself as the New Zealand Conservative Party as a result of poor opinion poll performances. After Meurant was dismissed from Government over a conflict of business interests, Meurant left the party and became an independent MP, leaving Rogers as party leader. Despite a belief that they could win 15% of the party vote in the 1996 election, the Conservatives fared badly, gaining only 0.07% of the vote New Zealand wide. Rogers lost his seat, and has never returned to Parliament.

==Life after politics==
Since leaving Parliament, Rogers has managed engineering companies, principally TGR Helicorp which was placed into receivership in April 2008. TGR HElicorp was a design and manufacturing organisation focussing on unmanned helicopters, although a flying prototype was never completed. All of his other companies (shell or otherwise) were also folded and he was forced by Bank of New Zealand into bankruptcy. The status of some of the assets from his various ventures is in some doubt or dispute and forensic receivers and investigators were called in by the liquidators. Some of the missing assets that were claimed as destroyed or sold by Mr and Mrs Rogers, were later found in concurrent property searches, having been sequestered in various shipping containers around Auckland.

He was jailed for one month for contempt of court in February 2011, and again, together with his wife, in March, after failing to provide the Court with the whereabouts of the intellectual property relating to the helicopter businesses. Mr Rogers was censured for &quot;continually lying to the court&quot;.

The Rogers have argued that the intellectual property is in their heads so can not be handed over. A counter offer made by the Rogers to the Court to recreate the intellectual property in exchange for staff, facilities and wages was dismissed by the plaintiff&#x27;s attorney.

<doc id="1067367" wikidata="Q7256236" url="?curid=1067367" title="Psychiatric history">
<text>A psychiatric history is the result of a medical process where a clinician working in the field of mental health (usually a psychiatrist) systematically records the content of an interview with a patient. This is then combined with the mental status examination to produce a &quot;psychiatric formulation&quot; of the person being examined.

Psychologists take a similar history, often referred to as a psychological history.

This article mainly covers the initial assessment history taking of a patient presenting for the first time with a new complaint.

==Background==
In the field of medicine a patient history is an account of the significant events in the patient&#x27;s life that have a relevance to the issue being addressed. The clinician taking the history guides the process in an attempt to achieve a succinct summary of these relevant details. Much of the history is obtained by asking questions. Some of these questions are quite specific, such as, &quot;How old are you?&quot; and others are more open, such as, &quot;How have you been feeling lately?&quot; Although the structure of the interview may appear disjointed, the result is usually under a set of headings which have a worldwide similarity.

==Patient identification==
The basic details of who the patient is are collected. This includes their age, sex, educational status, religion, occupation, relationship status, address and contact details. This serves several purposes. Firstly, it is necessary information for administrative purposes and for this reason some of this is often taken by clerks. Secondly, the questions are largely non threatening and provide a gentle introduction into the meeting of patient and clinician. Thirdly, it provides a format for individual introduction suitable to the culture. Thus the clinician may start by introducing themselves and then move on to these questions. This initial structure can provide a sense of familiarity for the patient who is stressed about what is happening. It also helps the clinician understand the patient&#x27;s social situation.

==Source and method of presentation==
The next step is to determine why the patient is there. How did they get to be in the interview? Were they referred by someone (such as another clinician, a relative or friend, or by the police or the courts) or did they come looking for help? If they were referred by someone then what was that person&#x27;s reason for the referral. Often such information is provided in a referral letter or by an earlier phone call.

==The main (chief) complaints==
The clinician next tries to clarify what are the main problems that have brought the patient to be there. Some of this may have already been achieved in the previous section. The patient may have more than one problem and these may be related, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and alcohol abuse or seemingly unrelated, such as panic disorder and premature ejaculation. The patient is unlikely to present a diagnosis and is more likely to describe the nature of their problems in common language.

==History of the presenting complaints (present illness)==
The clinician then attempts to obtain a clear description of these problems. When did they start? How did they start, suddenly, slowly or in fits and starts? Have they fluctuated over time? What does the patient describe as the essential features of the complaints? Having developed a hypothesis of what may be the diagnosis, the clinician next looks at symptoms that might confirm this hypothesis or lead them to consider another possibility. Much of the mental process for the clinician is involved in this process of hypothesis testing to arrive at a diagnostic formulation that will form the basis of a management plan. The severity of each complaint is assessed and this may include probing questions on sensitive issues such as suicidal thoughts or sexual difficulties.

==History==
This is divided into the &quot;psychiatric history&quot;, which looks at any previous episodes of the presenting complaint as well as any other past or ongoing psychiatric problems. The &quot;substance (drug) history&quot; includes data about patterns of use (mode of administration, age of onset, frequency, amount, last use, medical or psychological complications, history of attempting to quit) for alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. The &quot;medical history&quot; documents significant illnesses, both past and current, and significant medical events such as head injury, seizures, major surgeries, and major illnesses. A separate &quot;sexual history&quot; gathers data about sexual orientation and sexual activity. Finally a &quot;history of abuse&quot;, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse is obtained from the patient and collateral sources (family members or close family friends) as trauma might not be directly remembered by the patient.

==Family history==
Many psychiatric disorders have a genetic component and the biological family history is thus relevant. Clinical experience also suggests that a response to treatment may have a genetic component as well. Thus a patient who presents with clinical depression whose mother also suffered from the same disorder and responded well to fluoxetine would indicate that this drug would be more likely to help in the patient&#x27;s disorder.

Apart from the genetic factors, research has shown that illnesses in the parents such as depression and alcohol abuse are associated with a higher rate of some conditions in the children growing up in that environment. Similar effects are seen with the death of a parent from a protracted illness.

==Developmental history==
This documents the significant events in the patient&#x27;s life. Ideally it starts with pre-natal factors such as maternal illnesses or complications with the pregnancy, then documents delivery and early childhood illnesses or problems. It then looks at significant events in the patient&#x27;s life such as parental separation, abuse, education, psychosexual development, peer relationships, behavioural aspects and any legal complications. It flows then into adulthood with relationship and occupational histories. The aim is to get an overview of who the patient is and what they have experienced in life, both good and bad. Major stresses and transitions such as marriage, parenthood, retirement, death or loss of a partner, and financial success and failure are all important, as is how the patient has dealt with them. Sexual adjustment and problems can be relevant and are often questioned.

==Social history==
If the information has not already been obtained, the clinician then documents the social circumstances of the patient looking at factors such as finances, housing, relationships, drug and alcohol use, and problems with the law or other authorities. This is also a time to document racial or cultural issues that are relevant to the presenting complaint.

==Review of Systems==
A psychiatric review of systems may include screening questions directed at identifying or exploring co-morbid psychiatric illnesses or issues (e.g., SIGECAPS mnemonic or PHQ-9 for depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 for anxiety, DIGFAST mnemonic for mania, or specific questioning around psychoses or other psychiatric complaints. A full review of systems should attempt to identify and list all of the relevant STRESSORS that may be impacting a patient&#x27;s function and overall health.

==Summary==
Having collected this information the clinician usually then considers any other factors that might be relevant to the particular patient and enquires about them. Although the gathering of the information may follow the flow of the patient&#x27;s thoughts rather than those of the clinician, it is not uncommon for the clinician to record the psychiatric history under headings, such as those above, to make it easier for others who will later read it.

Subsequent history taking on reviews concentrates on changes in the levels of symptoms and responses to treatment, including possible side-effects.

<text>Merlin Carpenter (born 1967) is an English visual artist. Writing in Frieze, art critic Katie Sonnenborn stated that a recent exhibition &quot;continued his nuanced critique of the condition of contemporary art-making,&quot; and that &quot;working within the framework of the gallery, he presented a suite of canvases that cast doubt on current systems of cultural reception and consumption.&quot;

== Artistic practice ==
After graduating from Saint Martins School of Art in 1989, Carpenter has gone on to exhibit in 29 solo shows, and 48 group shows between 1989 and 2007. Carpenter&#x27;s paintings can be seen as deeply ambivalent. His style is heavily influenced by artists like Jackson Pollock and Julian Schnabel. Carpenter promotes in his paintings what he calls the &quot;de-subjectivation of the brush stroke&quot;, and with this is his exploration into what he has called &quot;overdetermined imagery&quot; such as fashion photography. In his art Carpenter also marks out the differences and parallels between art and non-artist luxury items.

== The &quot;Poster Studio&quot; ==
In 1994 Carpenter set up an experimental art space in London named &quot;Poster Studio&quot; with fellow artists Dan Mitchell and Nils Norman, among others. Its aim was to produce a critical analysis of the contemporary London art world. The poster studio disbanded in 1996.

== Art writing ==
Carpenter writes articles for the periodical &quot;Texte zur Kunst&quot;, as well as texts for catalogues and reviews..

== Exhibitions ==
Exhibitions include &quot;The Opening&quot;, Mitterrand+Sanz/Contemporary Art, Zurich (2007); &quot;Relax It&#x27;s Only a Bad Cosima von Bonin Show&quot;, Galerie Bleich-Rossi, Vienna (2007) and &quot;Sounds of War&quot;, Galerie Edward Mitterrand, Geneva (2005) and &quot;Ballard in Narnia&quot; (with Richard Parry). In 2011, Carpenter made an exhibition of paintings at Simon Lee Gallery, titled Tate Café.

Merlin Carpenter is represented by Reena Spaulings Fine Art, New York; Overdouin &amp; Co, Los Angeles and galerie dépendance, Brussels.

<doc id="1067380" wikidata="Q5130200" url="?curid=1067380" title="Clayton Cosgrove">
<text>Clayton James Cosgrove (born 31 October 1969) is a former New Zealand politician. He is a member of the Labour Party.

==Early life==

Cosgrove was born in Nelson, New Zealand. He received a BA (Triple Major), in History, American Studies and Political Science, from the University of Canterbury in 1992 and received an MBA in 1996. Before entering politics, he worked in the Corporate Affair field within the Minerals and Telecommunications industries. He was also a small business owner.

==Labour Party involvement==

Cosgove has been a member of the Labour Party since he was fourteen, and has held a number of posts within the party. He was chairman of the party&#x27;s Canterbury branch from 1989 to 1994.

He was a strong supporter of Moore, and opposed Moore&#x27;s replacement by Helen Clark. Before the 1996 election he was involved in discussions with Moore to form a new party but this failed to eventuate.

==Member of Parliament==


Cosgrove himself stood for election in Moore&#x27;s former Waimakariri seat in the 1999 election, and was successful. During 2002 he was selected and graduated the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Leaders of Tomorrow programme (later called Young Global Leaders). He was re-elected in the 2002, 2005 and 2008 general elections. However, he was defeated in the electorate by National&#x27;s Kate Wilkinson in 2011 and was subsequently elected as list MP. Wilkinson retired at the end of the parliamentary term and was replaced as National&#x27;s candidate for the by Matt Doocey, who had previously contested the in Christchurch East. Doocey beat Cosgrove with an increased majority. Being again in eighth place on the Labour list, Cosgrove remained a list MP.

===Cabinet minister (2005–2008)===
He was appointed Minister for Building and Construction, Minister of Statistics, Associate Minister of Finance, Associate Minister of Justice and Associate Minister of Immigration (responsible for individual immigration cases) after the 2005 election. At the October 2007 Cabinet reshuffle, he was promoted and replaced his Building and Construction and Statistics portfolio responsibilities; with the Immigration, Small Business, Sport and Recreation portfolios, and ministerial responsibility for the Rugby World Cup. He retained his roles as Associate Minister of Justice and Finance. Cosgrove lost his ministerial position when Labour was defeated in the 2008 election.

Cosgrove was selected to attend the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Annual meeting in New York and Davos in 2001 and 2002, and was appointed to the Forum&#x27;s task force on Free Trade. He is generally considered to be on the right of the Labour Party.

====Boy racers====
In August 2007 Cosgrove was targeted after raising considerable concerns about boy racers, who have caused numerous and significant problems throughout his electorate and Christchurch in general. Boy racers attempted to intimidate Cosgrove in a number of ways, including defacing billboards and driving past his house on Saturday nights. New Zealand has considerable problems with boy racers, leading to many car seizures and a new law being mooted to crush the vehicles of the worst offenders.

===Opposition (2008–2017)===
When Lianne Dalziel confirmed that she would contest the 2013 Christchurch mayoralty, her Christchurch Earthquake Recovery portfolio was split and assigned to Cosgrove and Ruth Dyson in July 2013. He considered standing in the by-election resulting from Dalziel&#x27;s resignation from Parliament, but in the end decided not to put his name forward for the Labour nomination.

He announced he would be retiring from politics at the 2017 general election in April 2016.

==Post politics==
After leaving parliament, Cosgrove worked as consultant and lobbyist, including for the ill-fated attempt to mine Foulden Maar for pig food and the Greymouth Hospital construction.

<doc id="1067381" wikidata="Q2428909" url="?curid=1067381" title="Freshwater, Isle of Wight">
<text>Freshwater is a large village and civil parish at the western end of the Isle of Wight, England. The southern, coastal part of the village is Freshwater Bay, named for the adjacent small cove.
Freshwater sits at the western end of the region known as the Back of the Wight or the West Wight, a popular tourist area. 
Freshwater is close to steep chalk cliffs. It was the birthplace of physicist Robert Hooke and was the home of Poet Laureate Alfred Lord Tennyson.

==Landmarks==

Freshwater is famous for its geology and coastal rock formations that have resulted from centuries of coastal erosion. Arch Rock was a well-known local landmark that collapsed on 25 October 1992. The neighbouring Stag Rock is so named because supposedly a stag leapt to the rock from the cliff to escape during a hunt. Another huge slab fell off the cliff face in 1968, and is now known as the Mermaid Rock. Immediately behind Mermaid Rock lies a small sea cave that cuts several metres into the new cliff.

Freshwater&#x27;s beach is very popular with tourists and locals. It is mostly pebbles, but it is also covered in chalk from the nearby cliffs, which is frequently gathered by tourists as souvenirs.

Freshwater features an excellent example of a surviving Victorian Beach hotel, The Albion. It was built around the time Freshwater became well-regarded as a coastal resort and is still popular today. Frequent repair work and repainting are undertaken on the building&#x27;s seafront exterior walls, due to strong storms which often batter rocks, and other debris, against it.

The hills above Freshwater are named after Tennyson. On the nearby Tennyson Down is a Cornish granite cross erected in 1897 in tribute to Tennyson, &quot;by the people of Freshwater, and other friends in England and America.&quot; There is also a hill in the area called Hooke Hill, named after Robert Hooke.

The Anglican All Saints&#x27; Church, Freshwater is one of the oldest churches on the Isle of Wight, and it was listed in the Domesday survey of 1086. Mark Whatson is the current pastor of All Saints, which is in the Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth. A primary school associated with the church is nearby. There is a marble memorial commemorating Tennyson in All Saints Church. Tennyson&#x27;s wife Emily and other family members are buried in the church cemetery. The church is also the site of a memorial to Tennyson&#x27;s son, Lionel Tennyson, who died of malaria in 1886.


Dimbola Lodge, the home of Julia Margaret Cameron and now a photographic museum, is in the village of Freshwater Bay, which is part of Freshwater. There is also a tearoom and bookstore.

Tennyson&#x27;s son, Hallam, donated land for a new church in Freshwater Bay. Hallam&#x27;s wife Audrey Tennyson suggested that the church be named for St. Agnes. St. Agnes&#x27; Church, Freshwater was consecrated on 12 August 1908. It is the only thatched church on the Isle of Wight.

Freshwater was the site of the largest station on the Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway that operated from 20 July 1889 to 21 September 1953. A supermarket and garden centre now occupies the location of the former station.

Freshwater is near the source of the Western Yar, a river whose estuary runs north to Yarmouth. Freshwater Marshes are a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and a large part of the Marshes is also a Local Nature Reserve called Afton Marshes.

At the western end of Freshwater Bay on a bluff are the remains of Fort Redoubt, also known as Fort Freshwater or Freshwater Redoubt, a Palmerston Fort. Fort Redoubt was built in 1855–1856 to protect Freshwater Bay and was in use until the early 20th century; it was sold by the military in 1928. A doorway carved into the cliff below the fort was the main access to the building from the beach, although most of the iron stairway that formerly gave access has broken up due to rust and the action of the sea.
Two unusual structures that have been described as ice houses, pottery kilns or crematoria are found on Moons Hill in Freshwater. Robert Walker was the first to excavate these features in the 1890s, and he thought they were evidence of a Phoenician settlement in Freshwater. Chemical analyses suggest that they were most likely lime kilns.

==Notable residents==

The renowned scientist Robert Hooke (1635–1703) was born in Freshwater in 1635. His father John Hooke was the curate of All Saints Church in Freshwater. When Hooke&#x27;s father died in 1648, Hooke left Freshwater for London to be apprenticed to portrait painter Peter Lely. After that, he went to Westminster School and then Oxford.

Painter George Morland lived in Freshwater in a structure known as the Cabin around 1800.

British Poet laureate Alfred Lord Tennyson lived at nearby Farringford House (on the road between Freshwater and Alum Bay). Tennyson lived at Farringford from 1853 until the end of his life in 1892. Tennyson wrote of Farringford:

Tennyson rented Farringford in 1853 and then bought it in 1856. He found that there were too many tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to Aldworth, a stately home on Blackdown hill between Lurgashall and Fernhurst, about south of Haslemere in West Sussex in 1869. However, he returned to Farringford to spend the winters.

Pioneering photographer Julia Margaret Cameron lived in Freshwater at Dimbola Lodge from 1860 to 1875. Gertrude Fenton, the novelist and editor of The Carisbrooke Magazine, lived at Lacey&#x27;s Farm, Freshwater in the early 1880s.

Freshwater was also the birthplace of Sir Vivian Ernest Fuchs (11 February 1908 – 11 November 1999), an English explorer and Fellow of the Royal Society, whose expeditionary team completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica in 1958.

Conductor Trevor Harvey was born in Freshwater in 1911.

==Organisations==

The Freshwater Village Association was created in November 2006. The Freshwater Village Association was formed by Freshwater residents who are concerned that Freshwater might lose its identity as a village. The Freshwater Bay Residents Association was created on 2 July 1984, to express concern over the development of Freshwater Bay.

Freshwater Lifeboat is an independent lifesaving organisation based in Freshwater Bay. It operates the Freshwater Bay Lifeboat Station on the promenade along Freshwater Bay and two lifeboats from public donations and profits from shop sales since it is not part of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.

It hosts the Freshwater and Totland Carnival every year.

Freshwater is the headquarters of the Robert Hooke Society, who have created a walking trail around the area called the &quot;Hooke Trail&quot; to visit sites associated with him. They hold bi-monthly meetings at the Island Planetarium at Fort Victoria, a yearly Memorial Luncheon on 3 March on the date of his death and week-long celebrations of his birthday, 18 July.

==History==
There is evidence of a Roman harbour at the end of the Western Yar. A romano-british grave containing a Vectis ware pot was found on sheepwash farm in 1898. In 530 AD, the Island fell to a combined force of Saxons and Jutes. After the Norman Conquest, Lord of the Island William Fitz Osbern gave the Saxon All Saints&#x27; Church and its tithes to the Norman Abbey of Lyre sometime between 1066 and his death in 1071. In 1414 all alien priories were seized by the Crown. In 1623, when King James I gave Freshwater Parish to John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln, Williams then granted Freshwater to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge on 24 March 1623.

The Freshwater Parish originally was composed of five farms, known as &quot;tuns&quot;: Norton, Sutton, Easton, Weston and Middleton. All of these place names still exist, except for Sutton, which is now called Freshwater Bay (previously Freshwater Gate). The first meeting of the Freshwater Parish Council was on 31 December 1894.

In 2010, 250 kg of cocaine was found in Freshwater Bay. The &quot;Freshwater Five&quot; fishing crew were convicted in relation to this, but are appealing their conviction.

== Village attractions ==

There are several attractions within the immediate area:
*Farringford House, home of poet Alfred Lord Tennyson.
*Dimbola Lodge, home of photographer Julia Margaret Cameron.
*West Wight Sports Centre.
*Freshwater Bay Golf Course.
*Afton Down, the site of the Isle of Wight Festival 1970.
*The Needles Old Battery, a Victorian fort and post-Second World War High Down Rocket Test Site.
*Needles Lighthouse and chalk rocks.
*Compton Bay, where dinosaur footprints are visible at low tide.
*The Longstone, some four miles distant, the only megalithic monument on the Island.

Not all of these attractions are within the formal boundaries of the village.

== Transport ==

Freshwater is linked to other parts of the Island by Southern Vectis buses on route 7 and route 12 serving Totland, Yarmouth and Newport as well as intermediate villages. In the Summer, open-top bus &quot;The Needles Tour&quot; and tourist service &quot;Island Coaster&quot; serve Freshwater Bay. Freshwater is on the Isle of Wight Coastal Path.

For local transport within West Wight, a community transport scheme called FYT Bus (Freshwater, Yarmouth and Totland) running a mix scheduled and on demand services, and expanded in 2023 with a new electric minibus.

Freshwater was connected by train when the Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway opened in 1888. Due to low usage, especially outside the holiday season after the war, the line closed in 1953, ten years before the Beeching cuts were published.

<doc id="1067390" wikidata="Q618681" url="?curid=1067390" title="Imzadi">
<text>Imzadi is a non-canon &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel by Peter David, primarily exploring William Riker&#x27;s assignment to Betazed and his early relationship with Deanna Troi.

&quot;Imzadi&quot; has a complex structure, involving time travel through the Guardian of Forever, but a straightforward plot of love and rescue. Troi&#x27;s history with Riker had been introduced in the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;; this also included the word &quot;imzadi&quot;, a Betazoid term of endearment usually translated as &quot;beloved&quot;. The novel expands on the meaning of &quot;imzadi&quot; when Troi explains that its literal meaning is &quot;the first,&quot; not necessarily referring to the first sexual partner but, as Troi puts it to Riker, &quot;the first to ever touch your soul.&quot;

==Setting==
* Chapters 1 to 6, an unnumbered epilogue chapter (between chapters 10 and 11), chapters 34 to 36, and chapter 44 take place in 2408.
* Chapters 7 to 10, 33, and 37 to 43 take place in 2368. 
* Chapters 11 to 31 take place in 2359.
* Chapter 32 takes place in 2364.

==Plot==
Seventy-three-year-old Admiral William Riker is a bitter, lonely man in a slow downward spiral following the death forty years earlier of Deanna Troi, who died of undetermined causes during a peacekeeping conference with an enemy race, the Sindareen. Riker, now the commander of an unimportant starbase, is summoned to Betazed as Deanna&#x27;s mother, Lwaxana Troi, lies dying. While going through Lwaxana&#x27;s possessions after her death, Riker is reminded of how he and Deanna originally met and began their relationship on Betazed.

In a lengthy flashback, it is revealed that Will and Deanna met when Will was stationed on Betazed between assignments, and while there attended a wedding at which Deanna was maid of honor. Will was instantly attracted to her and began to pursue her, though she initially rebuffed his advances, feeling that he was only interested in her physical attributes, and that he preferred quick, thrilling encounters over meaningful emotional intimacy. Over a series of meetings, however, they began to grow closer, as Will encouraged Deanna to embrace impulsive feelings and Deanna encouraged Will to explore his more spiritual side.

While visiting her favorite museum, Deanna was kidnapped by a Sindareen raiding party, and Riker&#x27;s Starfleet security force shot down their small craft in the jungle. Riker tracked them down and killed the only surviving captor, leaving Deanna and him alone together. In the jungle, they consummated their relationship, and Deanna told Will for the first time that they are &quot;Imzadi.&quot; However, after their return from the jungle, Lwaxana&#x27;s violent objections to their relationship and Deanna&#x27;s seeming compliance led Riker to drunkenly fall into bed with another woman. Deanna discovered them together when she appeared at his living quarters, having planned to tell him she had decided to defy her mother&#x27;s wishes. Deanna and Will decided not to pursue a relationship and Riker left the planet shortly thereafter, not to meet Deanna again until they were both assigned to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D.

In the future timeline, Commodore Data, now in command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-F, tells Riker that scientists studying the Guardian of Forever have discovered that Deanna&#x27;s death was a focal point in time, causing the creation of a parallel timeline; his intention is to comfort Riker with the idea that Deanna lives on in another universe. Struck with a new suspicion, Admiral Riker has an autopsy performed on Deanna&#x27;s corpse and discovers that she had been murdered via a poison that did not exist at the time she died. Deducing that someone had gone back in time to murder her and deliberately alter the timeline, Admiral Riker travels to the Guardian of Forever and goes back to the time of the Sindareen peace conference on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D, a short while before Deanna&#x27;s death. He gives Commander Riker the antidote to the poison, and Riker administers it to Deanna. Her death is thus prevented, but Admiral Riker does not immediately return to his timeline, indicating that the danger to her has not yet passed.

Commodore Data has also pursued Admiral Riker through the Guardian, feeling it is his duty to preserve the timeline by any means. He disables Commander Data and impersonates him, taking Deanna away from the peace conference with the intention of killing her. Admiral Riker realizes Data may try this, so he locates Commander Data and with him confronts Commodore Data, and they fight. As the peace conference attendees look on, Deanna finally becomes familiar enough with the representatives from the Sindareen (a race difficult to read empathically without sufficient exposure) to determine that they are deceiving everyone, and have no real peaceful intentions; the peace conference is only an attempt to stall for time so that their race can become more powerful. One of the Sindareen delegates is actually from the future and had decided to go back in time and kill Deanna to prevent this discovery. When Deanna announces that the Sindareen are behaving duplicitously, the Sindareen makes a last-ditch effort to kill Deanna, which is thwarted by Admiral Riker.

Once Deanna is safe, everyone from the future return to their proper timeline, where the Guardian of Forever intones that &quot;All is as it was.&quot; Data is chagrined that he never thought to ask whether Admiral Riker was correct about the timeline being altered. Now that it has been restored, Admiral Riker and the others have no way of knowing what awaits them. Riker hears his Imzadi&#x27;s voice inside his mind, welcoming him home.

==Sequel==
===&quot;Imzadi II: Triangle&quot;===
The 1998 sequel &quot;Imzadi II: Triangle&quot; addresses Worf&#x27;s romantic interest in Troi, William Riker&#x27;s renewed interest and Thomas Riker&#x27;s resentment at his lost opportunity with Troi. &quot;Imzadi II: Triangle&quot; brings in additional characters and multiple plot lines.

==Other versions==
Both &quot;Imzadi&quot; novels were re-released in 2003 as the omnibus collection &quot;Imzadi Forever&quot;.

Abridged versions of the novels were also released as audiobooks. &quot;Imzadi&quot; was read by Jonathan Frakes (the actor who played Riker), and &quot;Imzadi II&quot; by Robert O&#x27;Reilly (whose recurring onscreen role was the Klingon Gowron).

Extracts from both books were included in &quot;Star Trek: Adventures in Time and Space&quot;, which was described by the editor as featuring clips from the best of twenty years of Pocket Books official &quot;Star Trek&quot; line.

==Reception==
&quot;Imzadi&quot; is rated 4 out of 5 on Google books.

A TrekMovie.com reviewer writing in 2010 about Peter David&#x27;s later works mentioned that &quot;Imzadi&quot; remained his favorite &quot;Star Trek&quot; book of all time. In 2015, &quot;Imzadi&quot; was noted as one of better &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels, noting an audio book narrated by Jonathan Frakes himself (who played Commander Riker on the TV show).

In 2015, John Bardinelli of Barnesandnoble.com highlighted this as among of the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels.

<doc id="1067391" wikidata="Q365977" url="?curid=1067391" title="Bias of Priene">
<text>Bias (; Greek: Βίας ὁ Πριηνεύς; fl. 6th century BC) of Priene was a Greek sage. He is widely accepted as one of the Seven Sages of Greece and was renowned for his probity.

==Life==
Bias was born at Priene (modern-day Güllübahçe, Turkey), and was the son of Teutamus. He is said to have been distinguished for his skill as an advocate, and for his use of it in defence of the right. In reference to which Demodocus of Leros uttered the following saying: &quot;If you are a judge, give a Prienian decision,&quot; and Hipponax said, &quot;More powerful in pleading causes than Bias of Priene.&quot;

He was always reckoned among the Seven Sages. He was mentioned by Dicaearchus as one of the Four to whom alone that title was universally given, the remaining three being Thales, Pittacus, and Solon. Satyrus placed him at the head of the Seven Sages, and even Heraclitus, who poured scorn on figures such as Hesiod and Pythagoras, referred to Bias as &quot;a man of more consideration than any.&quot; One of the examples of his great goodness is the legend that says that Bias paid a ransom for some women who had been taken prisoner. After educating them as his own daughters, he sent them back to Messina, their homeland, and to their fathers.

Bias is said to have died at a very advanced age while pleading a cause for his client. After he had finished speaking, he rested his head on his grandson. When the advocate on the opposite side had spoken, the judges decided in favor of Bias&#x27;s client, by which time Bias had died. The city gave him a magnificent funeral and inscribed on his tomb:
==Works==
It is said that Bias wrote a poem of 2000 lines on Ionia and the way to make it prosperous.

===Sayings===
Many sayings were attributed to him by Diogenes Laërtius and by others:
*&quot;All that is mine I carry with me&quot; or &quot;I carry all my effects with me.&quot;
*&quot;The naïve men are easily fooled.&quot;
*&quot;Most people are evil.&quot;
*&quot;All men are wicked.&quot;
*&quot;It is difficult to bear a change of fortune for the worse with magnanimity.&quot;
*&quot;Choose the course which you adopt with deliberation; but when you have adopted it, then persevere in it with firmness.&quot;
*&quot;Do not speak fast, for that shows folly.&quot;
*&quot;Love prudence.&quot;
*&quot;Speak of the Gods as they are.&quot;
*&quot;Do not praise an undeserving man because of his riches.&quot;
*&quot;Gain your point by persuasion, not by force.&quot; / &quot;Take by persuasion, not by force.&quot;
*&quot;Cherish wisdom as a means of traveling from youth to old age, for it is more lasting than any other possession.&quot;
* &quot;So order your affairs as if you were to live long, or die soon.&quot;
* &quot;They love as if they would one day hate, and hate as if they would one day love.&quot;
* &quot;Office will show a man.&quot;

==Vatican bust==
In April 1819, Schopenhauer wrote in his &quot;Reisebuch&quot; [Travel Diary]: &quot;In the Vatican [Hall of Philosophers] there is the bust of Bias with the inscription of πλεῖστοι ἄνθρωποι κακοί [most men are bad]. Indeed this must have been his maxim.&quot;

<text>The River Foyle () is a river in west Ulster in the northwest of the island of Ireland, which flows from the confluence of the rivers Finn and Mourne at the towns of Lifford in County Donegal, Republic of Ireland, and Strabane in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. From here it flows to the city of Derry, where it discharges into Lough Foyle and, ultimately, the Atlantic Ocean. The total length of the River Foyle is . The river separates part of County Donegal from parts of both County Londonderry and County Tyrone. The district of County Donegal that borders the western bank of the River Foyle is traditionally known as the Laggan. This district includes the villages of St Johnston and Carrigans, both of which are nestled on the banks of the River.

==Tributaries==
The Burn Dale (also known as the Burn Deele or the River Deele) flows into the River Foyle on the northern outskirts of Lifford, while the Swilly Burn flows into the Foyle near Porthall, a hamlet between St Johnston and Lifford. St Johnston Burn flows into the Foyle at St Johnston, while Flushtoun Burn flows into the river on the southern outskirts of St Johnston. Carrigans Burn flows from Port Lough, and enters the Foyle on the southern outskirts of Carrigans. Both the Burn Dennet and the Glenmornan River flow into the Foyle just to the north of Ballymagorry, entering the river a short distance to the north of Corkan Isle.

==Name==
Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) described a river mouth called Ουιδουα (&quot;Widua&quot;, from PIE *&quot;widhu&quot;, &#x27;tree&#x27;) which referred to the Foyle.

The Irish name is &quot;An Feabhal&quot;, which refers to Febail, father of the mythical Bran.

==Crossings==
The River Foyle is also the fastest-flowing river in Europe for its size , making the construction of bridges across it difficult. In Derry, the main crossing point, there are three bridges. The southernmost bridge, the oldest of the three, is Europe&#x27;s only road traffic double-decker bridge and is officially known as the Craigavon Bridge (occasionally referred to colloquially as the Blue Bridge). The northernmost bridge, known as the Foyle Bridge, is a much larger bridge and was built to accommodate tall ships at a time when it was envisaged that the city would need to accommodate such vessels. However, this proved unnecessary as the main port was moved several miles north of the city and the large vessels it was designed for never had to come so far south. The Foyle Bridge was planned originally by the Londonderry Development Commission and was intended to alleviate the traffic congestion on the existing Craigavon Bridge and in the city centre. However, political prevarication meant that it was not constructed until the 1980s. Derry&#x27;s third bridge, the Peace Bridge, is situated behind the Guildhall Square, north of the Craigavon Bridge. The pedestrian and cycle bridge was opened in 2011, intended as a symbol of union between the two sides of the city.

Outside Derry, the only bridge to cross the River Foyle is Lifford Bridge, which was built in the 1960s between Lifford, the county town of County Donegal, on the western bank of the river, and Strabane, a major town in County Tyrone, on the eastern bank.

==Navigation==
The tidal Foyle is navigable from the coast to approximately inland. The derelict Strabane Canal continued from this point a further to Strabane. Traffic on the Foyle further south than the northern bridge is now more or less restricted to pleasure boats with the occasional tanker coming in the refinery at the northern end of the town. A tour of the Foyle on board a small cruise ship called the Toucan One, once provided tourists a chance to travel along the River Foyle from Derry city centre to Greencastle County Donegal on the shores of Lough Foyle. However, because of a lack of funding from various sources, this venture has now come to a standstill.

==Foyle Search and Rescue==
Due to the presence of three bridges over the river in Derry, some people choose to attempt suicide by jumping into the deep and fast-moving Foyle. &#x27;Foyle Search and Rescue&#x27; was established as a charity in July 1993 and has adopted the role of protecting human life in the River Foyle from the Craigavon Bridge, Foyle Bridge and the newly opened Peace Bridge. Between 1993 and 2008 it dealt with more than 1000 people in distress.

==Fishing==
Prior to the Plantation of Ulster the fishing rights on the River would have been owned by the O’Neills and the O’Donnells, the Chieftains of Tír Eoghain and Donegal respectively. When the Plantation of Ulster started in 1609 a body called The Honourable The Irish Society had been set up by Royal Charter in 1613 to administer the affairs of the Plantation. The Society was then given the rights to the fishing on the river and on the River Bann, all except the parts of the rivers owned by the Bishop of Derry. In 1944 an action for trespass was taken by the Society against a fisherman from Porthall who they deemed to be fishing illegally. The case was heard by Mr Justice George Gavan Duffy in the high court in Dublin during 1947–48. The case was dismissed against the man. The Society then appealed the decision and also appealed to both Northern and Southern Governments at losing the case. Both Governments agreed to buy the fishing rights for the sum of £110,280 on condition that they drop the appeal. This led to the establishment of a commission to oversee the fishing on the river and on Lough Foyle. The body set up was called the Foyle Fisheries Commission and was established by a Bill passed simultaneously by the Governments of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland on 25 March 1952. The Foyle Fisheries Commission was disestablished on 10 April 2007 with the signing of the Foyle &amp; Carlingford Fisheries Act 2007. 
The Foyle is believed to be one of the best Atlantic Salmon rivers in Ireland. 
Details of the fishing regulations are available from the Loughs Agency. The village of St Johnston, which lies on the County Donegal bank of the river, is a major fishing settlement on the Foyle.

==Area of Special Scientific Interest==
==Railways==
The riverbank has the Belfast-Derry railway line providing a key link to the city of Derry. Trains bring passengers along on the NI Railways service along the shoreline of Lough Foyle from onward stations such as Coleraine, Belfast Lanyon Place and Belfast Grand Central.

<doc id="1067396" wikidata="Q5691649" url="?curid=1067396" title="Hearing Voices Movement">
<text>The Hearing Voices Movement (HVM) is the name used by organizations and individuals advocating the &quot;hearing voices approach&quot;, an alternative way of understanding the experience of those people who &quot;hear voices&quot;. In the medical professional literature, ‘voices’ are most often referred to as auditory verbal hallucinations. The movement uses the term ‘hearing voices’, which it feels is a more accurate and &#x27;user-friendly&#x27; term.

The movement was instigated by Marius Romme, Sandra Escher and Patsy Hage in 1987. It challenges the notion that to hear voices is necessarily a characteristic of mental illness. Instead it regards hearing voices as a meaningful and understandable, although unusual, human variation. It therefore rejects the stigma and pathologisation of hearing voices and advocates human rights, social justice and support for people who hear voices that is empowering and recovery focused. The movement thus challenges the medical model of mental illness, specifically the validity of the schizophrenia construct.

==History and tenets==
The international Hearing Voices Movement is a prominent mental health service-user/survivor movement that promotes the needs and perspectives of experts by experience in the phenomenon of hearing voices (auditory verbal hallucinations). The main tenet of the Hearing Voices Movement is the notion that hearing voices is a meaningful human experience.

The Hearing Voices Movement regards itself and is regarded by others as being a post-psychiatric organisation. It positions itself outside of the mental health world in recognition that voices are an aspect of human difference, rather than a mental health problem. One of the main issues of concern for the Hearing Voices Movement is empowerment and human rights as outlined in its Melbourne Hearing Voices Declaration 2013 and Thessaloniki Declaration 2014.

The Hearing Voices Movement also seeks holistic health solutions to problematic and overwhelming voices that cause mental distress. Based on their research, the movement espouses that many people successfully live with their voices. In themselves voices are not seen as the problem. Rather it is the relationship the person has with their voices that is regarded as the main issue. Research indicates that mindfulness-based interventions can be beneficial for people distressed by hearing voices.

The Hearing Voices Movement has developed interventions for mental health practitioners to support people who hear voices and are overwhelmed by the experience.

==Position==
The position of the hearing voices movement can be summarised as follows:
*Hearing voices is not &quot;in itself&quot; a sign of mental illness.
*Hearing voices is part of the diversity of being a human, it is a faculty that is common (3-10% of the population will hear a voice or voices in their lifetime) and significant.
*Hearing voices is experienced by many people who do not have symptoms that would lead to diagnosis of mental illness.
*Hearing voices is often related to problems in life history.
*If hearing voices causes distress, the person who hears the voices can learn strategies to cope with the experience. 
*Coping is often achieved by confronting the past problems that lie behind the experience.

==Theoretical overview==
The work of Marius Romme, Sandra Escher and other researchers provides a theoretical framework for the movement. They find that:

# Not everyone who hears voices becomes a patient. Over a third of 400 voice hearers in the Netherlands they studied had not had any contact with psychiatric services. These people either described themselves as being able to cope with their voices and/or described their voices as life enhancing.
# Demographic (epidemiological) research provides evidence that there are people who hear voices in the general population (2%-6%) who are not necessarily troubled by them). Only a small minority fulfill the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis and, of those, only a few seek psychiatric aid indicating that hearing voices in itself is not necessarily a symptom of an illness. Even more (about 8%) have peculiar delusions and do so without being ill.
# People who cope well with their voices and those who did not, show clear differences in terms of the nature of the relationship they had with their voices. 
# People who live well with their voice experience use different strategies to manage their voices than those voice hearers who are overwhelmed by them.
# 70% of voice hearers reported that their voices had begun after a severe traumatic or intensely emotional event such as an accident, divorce or bereavement, sexual or physical abuse, love affairs, or pregnancy. Romme and colleagues found that the onset of voice hearing amongst a patient group was preceded by either a traumatic event or an event that activated the memory of an earlier trauma.
#Specifically, there is a high correlation between voice hearing and abuse. These findings are being substantiated further in on-going studies with voice hearing amongst children.
# Some people who hear voices have a deep need to construct a personal understanding for their experiences and to talk to others about it without being designated as mad.

Romme, colleagues and other researchers find that people who hear voices can be helped using methods such as voice dialoguing cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and self-help methods.

Romme theorizes a three phase model of recovery:
* Startling Initial confusion; emotional chaos, fear, helplessness and psychological turmoil.
* Organization The need to find meaning, arrive at some understanding and acceptance. The development of ways of coping and accommodating voices in everyday living. This task may take months or years and is marked by the attempt to enter into active negotiation with the voice(s).
* Stabilisation The establishment of equilibrium, and accommodation, with the voice(s), and the consequent re-empowerment of the person.

==Alternative to medical model of disability==
The Hearing Voices Movement disavows the medical model of disability and disapproves of the practises of mental health services through much of the Western world, such as treatment solely with medication. For example, some service users have reported negative experiences of mental health services because they are discouraged from talking about their voices as these are seen solely as symptoms of psychiatric illness. Slade and Bentall conclude that the failure to attend to hallucinatory experiences and/or have the opportunity for dialogue about them is likely to have the effect of helping to maintain them.

In &quot;Voices of Reason, Voices of Insanity&quot;, Leudar and Thomas review nearly 3,000 years of voice-hearing history. They argue that the Western World has moved the experience of hearing voices from a socially valued context to a pathologised and denigrated one. Foucault has argued that this process can generally arise when a minority perspective is at odds with dominant social norms and beliefs.

==Organisation==
The Hearing Voices Movement was established in 1987 by Romme and Escher, both from the Netherlands, with the formation of Stichting Weerklank (Foundation Resonance), a peer led support organisation for people who hear voices. In 1988, the Hearing Voices Network was established in England with the active support of Romme. Since then, networks have been established in 35 countries.

INTERVOICE (The International Network for Training, Education and Research into Hearing Voices) is the organisation that provides coordination and support to the Hearing Voices Movement. It is supported by people who hear voices, relatives, friends and mental health professionals including therapists, social workers, nurses, psychiatrists and psychologists.

INTERVOICE was formed in 1997, at a meeting of voice hearers, family members and mental health workers was held in Maastricht, Netherlands to consider how to organise internationally further research and work about the subject of voice hearing. The meeting decided to create a formal organizational structure to provide administrative and coordinating support to the wide variety of initiatives in the different involved countries.

The organisation is structured as a network and was incorporated in 2007 as a non-profit company and charity under UK law. It operates under the name of International Hearing Voices Projects Ltd. The president is Marius Romme and the governing body is made up of people who hear voices and mental health practitioners.

==Activities==

===Hearing Voices Groups===
Hearing Voices Groups are based on an ethos of self-help, mutual respect and empathy. They provide a safe space for people to share their experiences and to support one another. They are peer support groups, involving social support and belonging, not necessarily therapy or treatment. Groups offer an opportunity for people to accept and live with their experiences in a way that helps them regain some power over their lives. There are hundreds of hearing voices groups and networks across the world. In 2014 there were more than 180 groups in the UK. These include groups for young people, people in prison, women and people from Black and Minority Ethnic communities.

===World Hearing Voices Congress===
INTERVOICE hosts the annual World Hearing Voices Congress. In 2015 the 7th Congress was held in Madrid, Spain, the 2016 Congress will be held in Paris, France. Previous conferences have been held in Maastricht, Netherlands, (2009); Nottingham, England (2010), Savona, Italy (2011), Cardiff, Wales (2012); Melbourne, Australia (2013); Thessaloniki, Greece (2014); Madrid, Spain (2015).

===Annual World Hearing Voices Day===
This is held on 14 September and celebrates hearing voices as part of the diversity of human experience, It seeks to increase awareness of the fact that you can hear voices and be healthy. It also challenges the negative attitudes towards people who hear voices and the assumption that hearing voices, in itself, is a sign of mental illness.

===Research committee===
INTERVOICE has an international research committee, that commissions research, encourages and supports exchanges and visits between member countries, the translation and publication of books and other literature on the subject of hearing voices and other related extraordinary experiences.

== Criticism of the Hearing Voices Movement ==
The Hearing Voices Movement has been criticised for its stance on medication and schizophrenia and for promoting non-medical and non-evidence-based approaches to severe mental illnesses in articles by Susan Inman from the Huffington Post, such as &quot;People Who Hear Voices Need Science-Based Advice&quot; in 2013, and &quot;What You&#x27;re not Hearing About the Hearing Voices Movement&quot; in 2015.

Specific criticisms of the hearing voices approach include:

* using ideas that don&#x27;t support science-based ways of understanding illness
* undermines people&#x27;s trust in medical help that might be crucial to their wellbeing
* encourages people to focus on their voices when they may be having a hard time differentiating between what&#x27;s real and what&#x27;s not real
* doesn&#x27;t recognize the very different needs of people with severe mental illnesses 
* by failing to differentiate between the needs of people who actually have psychotic disorders and those who don&#x27;t, HVM poses serious risks
* poses real danger for the substantial number of people who lack insight into their psychotic disorder
* people struggling with psychotic symptoms shouldn&#x27;t be advised to emphasize the meaning of auditory hallucinations

==Appearances in media==

* &quot;The voices in my head TED2013&quot;, Filmed February 2013 

A study investigating media reports of the experience of hearing voices found that 84% of the articles in the study contained no suggestion that voice-hearing can be ‘normal’. Half of those that did, put voice-hearing in a religious or spiritual context, for example considering the case of Joan of Arc. Most of the articles (81.8%) connected voice-hearing to mental illness. In some cases, auditory verbal hallucinations were simply equated with insanity.

<text>Elpidia Carrillo (born August 16, 1961) is a Mexican actress and director. Her career includes roles in both film and television. Internationally she is best known for supporting roles in &quot;Predator&quot;, &quot;Bread and Roses,&quot; &quot;Nine Lives&quot; and &quot;Blue Beetle&quot;.

She was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead for her performance in &quot;Salvador&quot;. She is known for the role Tecuichpo in the independent film &quot;The Other Conquest&quot;.

== Early life ==
Carrillo was born in Parácuaro, Michoacán, Mexico, on August 16, 1961. One of eight children in a family of farm laborers, her childhood was marked by violence and poverty. At the age of three, her father was murdered, forcing her eldest brother to assume responsibility of the family. Wanting Carrillo to get an education, he forged a birth certificate so she could begin first grade at age four.

When she was six, her brother was shot outside a theater and the family faced constant threats to their lives. When she was ten, Carrillo moved to Uruapan with an older sister where she dropped out of school as she began working alongside her sister at a Chinese restaurant.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Carrillo was discovered by a local photographer in Uruapan, Mexico and soon received a modeling contract. At 12 years old, director Rafael Corkidi cast Elpidia as Malinche in the surrealist Mexican feature film &quot;Pafnucio Santo&quot;. The film was Mexico&#x27;s official submission to the Academy Awards that year, but with its many esoteric elements, it failed to garner a nomination. Due to the role involving nudity and her being under age, Carrillo was credited under the fake name Piya. Corkidi cast Carrillo again for a larger role in his film &quot;Deseos&quot;.

By the age of 16, she had shot her first lead role in the controversial Mexican feature &quot;Nuevo Mundo&quot;, directed by Gabriel Retes. Having worked numerous films, she decided to enroll in the Bellas Artes School in Mexico City.

=== Hollywood career ===
After numerous Mexican and International film and television credits, Carrillo&#x27;s US film career quickly emerged as she did a series of critically acclaimed roles in award nominated US projects. Her first US film came when Academy Award winning director Tony Richardson cast her in a co-starring role in the film &quot;The Border&quot; opposite Jack Nicholson and Harvey Keitel. That was soon followed by a co-starring role in the &quot;Beyond the Limit&quot; opposite Richard Gere, Michael Caine, and Bob Hoskins, with the latter two receiving BAFTA Nominations for their performances.

For her third US film, Carrillo performed a small supporting role in another successful Academy Award nominated art film &quot;Under Fire&quot; for which Gene Hackman&#x27;s performance received a Golden Globe nomination.

Next she made her US television debut in the role of Coana in the Primetime Emmy nominated mini-series &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot;.

Her first award nomination came when Oliver Stone cast her as the female lead of Maria in &quot;Salvador&quot; which earned Carrillo an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Female Lead, earned her co-star James Woods an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and earned Oliver Stone an Academy Award nomination with co-writer Rick Boyle for Best Original Screenplay, which they would both lose to Stone&#x27;s other nominated screenplay that year, &quot;Platoon.&quot;

With awards and critical recognition all by the age of 25, Carrillo then accepted what would be one of the most recognizable and commercially successful roles of her career as the only actress appearing in the 1987 action film &quot;Predator&quot; opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Shane Black, and Jesse Ventura. &quot;Predator&quot; is widely considered the most commercially successful film of Carrillo&#x27;s career and her most recognizable role. Though initially weakly received by critics, the film has subsequently gone on to become an action film classic making numerous &quot;best of&quot; lists in later years. At the time of its release, the film received an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects.

===Post commercial success===
Following the commercial success of &quot;Predator,&quot; and performances in television guest starring roles in &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, Carrillo increasingly focused her career once again on US film and television, as well as returning to Mexican independent cinema with roles including Guldbagge Award winning &quot;La Hija del Puma,&quot; &quot;Una Cita con el Destino,&quot; Ariel Award winning &quot;City of the Blind&quot;, and the Guillermo del Toro produced &quot;Un Embrujo&quot;, a winner of 9 Ariel Awards.

Carrillo appeared in Gregory Nava&#x27;s Mexican-American film &quot;My Family&quot; playing Isabel Magaña, the El Salvadorean refugee wife of Jimmy Smits, who won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead for the role. The film also won the Casting Society of America&#x27;s Artios Award for Best Casting for a Drama Feature.

Johnny Depp cast her as the female lead of his only directorial effort, the controversial &quot;The Brave&quot;, which he also starred in along with Marlon Brando. The film received an Palme d&#x27;Or nomination at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.

Despite the critical recognition and various nominations throughout her career, Carrillo&#x27;s first US acting award win was for her performance as Rosa in the drama &quot;Bread and Roses,&quot; which was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. Carrillo won the 2002 ALMA Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture, and shared the award with Elizabeth Peña.

Carrillo won the same award four years later, this time as sole recipient of the 2006 ALMA Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture for her performance as Sandra in &quot;Nine Lives&quot; written and directed by Rodrigo García. This was soon followed by a co-starring role in &quot;Seven Pounds&quot; which starred Will Smith.

Rodrigo García would then once again cast Carrillo, this time to co-star in the ensemble drama &quot;Mother and Child&quot;, this time sharing the screen and not the podium with Elizabeth Peña as well as Annette Bening, with whom she shares the majority of her scenes. The ensemble film also featured her former &quot;My Family&quot; co-star Jimmy Smits and Naomi Watts, Kerry Washington, and Samuel L. Jackson. The film premiered at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and Sundance Film Festival.

She did an episode of ER S6 E16: Under Control

===Later career===
Carrillo returned to star in the Mexican family comedy &quot;Familia Gang&quot; and the independent features &quot;Relentless&quot; and &quot;Foreign Land&quot;.

She made her return to television with a major recurring arc as Linda Brenner in &quot;Nashville&quot; and a guest starring role as President Daphne Tejeda on &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;.

<text>Arthur Yvor Winters (October 17, 1900 – January 25, 1968) was an American poet and literary critic.

==Life==
Winters was born in Chicago, Illinois and lived there until 1919 except for brief stays in Seattle and Pasadena, where his grandparents lived. He attended the University of Chicago for four-quarters in 1917–18, where he was a member of a literary circle that included Glenway Wescott, Elizabeth Madox Roberts and his future wife Janet Lewis. In the winter of 1918–19 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and underwent treatment for two years in Santa Fe, New Mexico. During his recuperation he wrote and published some of his early poems. On his release from the sanitarium he taught in high schools in nearby mining towns. In 1923 Winters published one of his first critical essays, &quot;Notes on the Mechanics of the Poetic Image,&quot; in the expatriate literary journal &quot;Secession&quot;. That same year he enrolled at the University of Colorado, where he achieved his BA and MA degrees in 1925.

In 1926, Winters married the poet and novelist Janet Lewis, also from Chicago and a fellow tuberculosis sufferer. After leaving Colorado he taught at the University of Idaho and then began the doctoral program at Stanford University. He remained at Stanford after receiving his PhD in 1934, becoming a member of the English faculty and living in Los Altos for the rest of his life. He retired from his Stanford position in 1966, two years before his death from throat cancer. His students included the poets Edgar Bowers, Turner Cassity, Thom Gunn, Donald Hall, Philip Levine, Jim McMichael, N. Scott Momaday, Robert Pinsky, John Matthias, Moore Moran, Roger Dickinson-Brown and Robert Hass, the critic Gerald Graff, and the theater director and writer Herbert Blau. He was also a mentor to Donald Justice, J.V. Cunningham, and Bunichi Kagawa.

He edited the literary magazine &quot;Gyroscope&quot; with his wife from 1929 to 1931; and &quot;Hound &amp; Horn&quot; from 1932 to 1934.

He was awarded the 1961 Bollingen Prize for Poetry for his &quot;Collected Poems&quot;.

==As modernist==
Winters&#x27;s early poetry appeared in small avant-garde magazines alongside work by writers like James Joyce and Gertrude Stein and was written in the modernist idiom; it was heavily influenced both by Native American poetry and by Imagism, being described as &#x27;arriving late at the Imagist feast&#x27;. His essay &quot;The Testament of a Stone&quot; gives an account of his poetics during this early period. Although beginning his career as an admirer and imitator of the Imagist poets, Winters by the end of the 1920s had formulated a neo-classic poetics. Around 1930, he turned away from modernism and developed an Augustan style of writing, notable for its clarity of statement and its formality of rhyme and rhythm, with most of his poetry thereafter being in the accentual-syllabic form.

==As critic==
Winters&#x27;s critical style was comparable to that of F. R. Leavis, and in the same way he created a school of students (of mixed loyalty). His affiliations and proposed canon, however, were quite different: Edith Wharton&#x27;s The Age of Innocence above any one novel by Henry James, Robert Bridges above T. S. Eliot, Charles Churchill above Alexander Pope, Fulke Greville and George Gascoigne above Sidney and Spenser. In his view, &quot;a poem in the first place should offer us a new perception . . . bringing into being a new experience.&quot;

He attacked Romanticism, particularly in its American manifestations, and assailed Emerson&#x27;s reputation as that of a sacred cow. His first book of poems, &quot;Diadems and Fagots,&quot; takes its title from one of Emerson&#x27;s poems. In this he was probably influenced by Irving Babbitt. Winters was associated with the New Criticism.

Winters is best known for his argument attacking the &quot;fallacy of imitative form&quot;:

:&quot;To say that a poet is justified in employing a disintegrating form in order to express a feeling of disintegration, is merely a sophistical justification for bad poetry, akin to the Whitmanian notion that one must write loose and sprawling poetry to &#x27;express&#x27; the loose and sprawling American continent. In fact, all feeling, if one gives oneself (that is, one&#x27;s form) up to it, is a way of disintegration; poetic form is by definition a means to arrest the disintegration and order the feeling; and in so far as any poetry tends toward the formless, it fails to be expressive of anything.&quot;

<text>Eidgenossenschaft () is a German word specific to the political history of Switzerland. 
It means &quot;oath commonwealth&quot; or &quot;oath alliance&quot;, in reference to the &quot;eternal pacts&quot; formed between the Eight Cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy of the late medieval period. In Swiss historiography, this relates most notably to the Rütlischwur (Rütli Oath) between the three founding cantons Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, which traditionally dates to 1307. In modern usage, &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot; is the German term used as an equivalent to &quot;Confederation&quot; in the official name of Switzerland, &quot;Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft&quot; (rendered, respectively, as &quot;Confédération suisse&quot; and &quot;Confederazione svizzera&quot; in French and Italian). Its corresponding adjective, eidgenössisch—officially translated as &quot;Swiss federal&quot;—is used in the name of organisations such as the &quot;Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule&quot;, or Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.
The term Eidgenosse (literally: comrade by oath) refers to individual members of the &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot;. It is attested as early as 1315 in the Pact of Brunnen (as &quot;Eitgenoze&quot;), referring to the
cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. The abstract noun &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot; (mostly contracted to &quot;eidgnoszschaft&quot; or &quot;eidgnoschaft&quot;) is attested in the 15th century.
In modern usage, &quot;Eidgenosse&quot; is sometimes used in archaic or ironic usage for &quot;Swiss citizen&quot;, especially for those citizens of purely Swiss origin and not from immigration.

In a historical context, &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot; refers to the medieval Swiss Confederacy, which grew from the 13th to the 16th century in central Europe, persisted until 1798 and then evolved into a federal state in the 19th century. When used in this sense, the eternal nature of the pact is necessary—the members of the &quot;Dreizehn Orte&quot; (Thirteen Cantons), frequently made time-limited alliances sworn by oath with other partners, but such pacts were not considered an &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot;.

The members of an &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot; are called &quot;Eidgenossen&quot; (singular &quot;Eidgenosse&quot;). This term is documented in an alliance from 1351 between the communal, countrified lieus of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden and the civic city lieus of Lucerne and Zürich, which referred to themselves as such. In the evolution of the Swiss Confederacy, the members initially were not united by one single pact, but rather by a whole set of overlapping pacts and separate bilateral treaties between various members. The abstraction to the singular use of &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot;, which implies a stronger sense of community and the perception of a strong common cause, did not occur until some forty years later, after the Battle of Sempach, although it began already in the &quot;Pfaffenbrief&quot; of 1370, a treaty among some of the then eight members of the Swiss Confederacy.

The communal movement in medieval Europe often led to similar alliances or leagues, called &quot;conjurationes&quot; in the Latin of the official documents of the time. The city alliances () in the medieval Holy Roman Empire, in which the member cities also were equal, can be regarded as &quot;Eidgenossenschaften&quot;, too, although they generally proved less stable, partly due to their fragmented territories. The best known of these city alliances was the Hanseatic League, but many others existed in the 13th and 14th century. An early example is the Lombard League at the time of Frederick I &quot;Barbarossa&quot;; an example from Switzerland would be the &quot;Burgundian Confederacy&quot; of Bern.

In the Holy Roman Empire, emperor Charles IV outlawed any such &quot;conjurationes, confederationes,&quot; and &quot;conspirationes&quot; in his Golden Bull of 1356. Most &quot;Städtebünde&quot; were subsequently dissolved, sometimes forcibly, and where refounded, their political influence was much reduced. On the Swiss &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot;, however, the edict had no such effect as Charles IV, who was of the House of Luxembourg, regarded the Swiss as potential useful allies against his rivals, the Habsburgs.

<text>Hyndland is an affluent residential area in the West End of the city of Glasgow, Scotland.

==Description==
Bordering Broomhill, Dowanhill, Kelvinside and Partickhill, it is a wealthy neighbourhood populated mainly by businessmen, lawyers, GPs, professionals (many employed at the nearby University of Glasgow) and a number of noted authors, poets, actors, comedians and footballers. Average property prices in the area are considerably higher than the Glasgow or Scottish averages.

The area is defined by quiet streets and red sandstone tenements, many of which are fronted by communal city gardens, often embellished with ornate doorway carvings and stained glass windows, built in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. One of the most expensive hotels in Scotland, Devonshire Gardens is located in the area along with several other fine dining options. There are also a number of townhouses built during these periods which contribute significantly to the area&#x27;s character. While many of these townhouses have been split into multiple apartments to cater to modern urban living, some remain individual properties. This division of property types accounts for the area&#x27;s unusual demographic. The district is also characterised by its large population of domestic cats.

There are a number of retail outlets in the area including high-quality delicatessens, cafés, hair and beauty salons, photographers, and local service shops. The Glasgow and Hillhead-Jordanhill rugby teams play in the area at Hughenden Stadium. There is also a lawn bowling club (Hyndland Bowling club) which was founded in 1904. There is a local school, Hyndland Secondary School.

The area includes several churches, including Hyndland Parish Church (Church of Scotland) and St. Bride&#x27;s Church (Scottish Episcopal Church), and there is a Marist House on Partickhill Road. The Church of Christ, Scientist on Hyndland Road was recently demolished, and the former United Presbyterian Church on Hyndland Street is now a theatre, called &quot;Cottier&#x27;s&quot;.

Hyndland railway station is on the North Clyde and Argyle lines, offering a direct link to central Glasgow in under ten minutes, and by a number of bus routes. The nearest Subway stations are Hillhead, Partick and Kelvinhall.

Formerly, the area was also served by the huge electric tramway network of the City of Glasgow. Services 1, 5 and 5A provided pollution-free transport on Great Western Road, Byres Road, Hyndland Road and Clarence Drive.

==Conservation Area==

The Glasgow Corporation designated the &quot;West End Conservation Area&quot; in 1972 and &quot;Hyndland Conservation Area&quot; in 1975. Planning authorities are obliged to &quot;protect and enhance the character and appearance&quot; of such areas, which is why Hyndland has retained so many original architectural features.

Various local buildings including the two churches, the school, the terraces of Kingsborough Gardens, and the one-time Royal Bank of Scotland building have listed building statuses.

Unfortunately there have been numerous breaches of the conservation area status in Hyndland with replacement uPVC windows, particularly in the tenements in Novar, Dudley and Clarence Drives and Airlie Street which have destroyed the visual appeal of these streets.

==History==

Prior to development, Hyndland was an area of farmland called &#x27;Hind Land&#x27; and belonged to the Bishops of Glasgow. The first tenements were built in 1885.

On 13 March 1941, a parachute mine was dropped on Hyndland by the Luftwaffe, destroying three tenement buildings on Dudley Drive. Also, during the war a number of refugee children from Germany and Poland were educated at Hyndland School, many of whom achieved a higher in English.

<text>Roberto Sebastián Antonio Matta Echaurren (; November 11, 1911 – November 23, 2002), better known as Roberto Matta, was one of Chile&#x27;s best-known painters and a seminal figure in 20th century abstract expressionist and surrealist art across the Americas and Europe. 

==Biography==
Matta was of Spanish, Basque and French descent. Born in Santiago, he studied architecture and interior design at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in Santiago, and graduated in 1935. That spring, he journeyed from Peru to Panama and completed surreal drawings of many of the geographical features he witnessed. He first encountered Europe while serving in the Merchant Marine after graduating. His travels in Europe and the USA led him to meet artists such as Arshile Gorky, René Magritte, Salvador Dalí, André Breton, and Le Corbusier.
It was Breton who provided the major spur to the Chilean&#x27;s direction in art, encouraging his work and introducing him to the leading members of the Paris Surrealist movement. Matta produced illustrations and articles for Surrealist journals such as &quot;Minotaure&quot;. During this period he was introduced to the work of many prominent contemporary European artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Marcel Duchamp.

The first true flowering of Matta&#x27;s own art came in 1938, when he moved from drawing to the oil painting for which he is best known. This period coincided with his emigration to the United States, where he lived until 1948. His early paintings, such as &quot;Invasion of the Night&quot;, give an indication of the work he would continue, with diffuse light patterns and bold lines on a featureless background. This is also the period of the &quot;inscape&quot; series, and the closely related &quot;psychological morphologies&quot;. Prof. Claude Cernuschi (see Boston College Matta exhibition external link below) writes, &quot;Matta&#x27;s key ambition to represent and evoke the human psyche in visual form was filtered through the writings of Freud and the psychoanalytic view of the mind as a three-dimensional space: the &#x27;inscape&#x27;.&quot; According to the essay on Matta in &quot;Crosscurrents of Modernism&quot; (see references below), the inscapes&#x27; evocative forms &quot;are visual analogies for the artist&#x27;s psyche&quot; (p. 241). During the 1940s and 1950s, the disturbing state of world politics found reflection in Matta&#x27;s work, with the canvases becoming busy with images of electrical machinery and distressed figures. The addition of clay to Matta&#x27;s paintings in the early 1960s lent an added dimension to the distortions.

In his art Matta creates new dimensions in a blend of organic and cosmic lifeforms (see biomorphism). He was one of the first artists to take this abstract leap.
Matta&#x27;s connections with Breton&#x27;s surrealist movement were severed following a private disagreement concerning Arshile Gorky and his family. Matta was accused of indirectly causing Gorky&#x27;s suicide (in response to Matta&#x27;s relationship with the Armenian-American painter&#x27;s wife). This led to his expulsion from the group, but by this time Matta&#x27;s own name was becoming widely known. He divided his life between Europe and South America during the 1950s and 1960s, successfully combining the political and the semi-abstract in epic surreal canvases. Matta believed that art and poetry can change lives, and was very involved in the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. He was a strong supporter of the socialist government of president Salvador Allende in Chile. A 4x24 meter mural of his entitled &quot;The First Goal of the Chilean People&quot;, was painted over with 16 coats of paint by the military regime of Augusto Pinochet following their violent overthrow of Salvador Allende in 1973. In 2005 the mural was discovered by local officials. In 2008 the mural was completely restored at a cost of $43,000, and it is displayed today in Santiago at the La Granja city hall.

Throughout his life, Matta worked with many different types of media, including ceramic, photography, and video production.

Matta died in Civitavecchia, Italy on 23 November 2002, eleven days after his 91st birthday.

Matta was married twice: his first wife was Patricia Matta Echaurren (&quot;née&quot; O&#x27;Connell), an American (who later married Pierre Matisse), and his second wife was Germana Ferrari. He is the father of six children. Two died prematurely, leaving his creative legacy to artists Gordon Matta-Clark and his twin brother Sebastian, Ramuntcho Matta, Federica Matta, designer Alisée and artist and writer Pablo Echaurren, whose surname was wrongly recorded at birth.

== Exhibitions (selection) ==

=== Group shows ===
In 2019, his work was included in the group show &quot;The Gift of Art&quot;, at Pérez Art Museum Miami. The exhibition highlighted important artworks within PAMM&#x27;s permanent collection on Latinx and Latin American artists. Among the artists featured in the exhibition were José Bedia (Cuba), Teresa Margolles (Mexico), Carmen Herrera (Cuba), Oscar Murillo (Colombia), Amelia Peláez (Cuba), Zilia Sánchez (Cuba), Tunga (Brazil) and Wifredo Lam (Cuba).

<text>Garnethill is a predominantly residential area of the city of Glasgow, Scotland with a number of important public buildings.

==Geography==

Located in the city centre, the area borders Cowcaddens to its north, Sauchiehall Street to its south, Cambridge Street to its east with the M8 motorway and Charing Cross forming its western boundary. The hill forms part of the historic Lands of Blythswood which the Douglas-Campbell families sold in stages from the late 18th century onwards, the largest purchaser/developer being William Harley of Blythswood Hill, cotton merchant and builder. Harley laid out Renfrew Street and encouraged the building of villas, which extended round into St George&#x27;s Road. One major site was developed as Garnethill Observatory in 1810. Later developments included spacious tenements as families moved upward from the overcrowded Cowcaddens. Harley also laid out Blythswood Square.

The area was named Garnet Hill by William Harley, in honour of Professor Thomas Garnett, one of the first professors of Anderson&#x27;s Institution, known today as Strathclyde University.

==Demography==
Garnethill is ethnically diverse, with significant ethnically Scottish, Pakistani, Arab, Indian, Chinese and African populations.

==Sites==
The Glasgow School of Art, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow Film Theatre are located in Garnethill. It is also the location of Scotland&#x27;s oldest and first purpose-built synagogue Garnethill Synagogue, founded in 1879, and the Glasgow Dental Hospital and School. Garnethill is also home to St. Aloysius&#x27; RC Church, built in 1910.

==Schools==
Garnetbank Primary School is situated on Renfrew Street opposite Renfrew Street Nursery School.

There is a private school, St Aloysius&#x27; College, whose Clavius building and Junior School both recently won architectural awards. St Aloysius&#x27; College also have a 4-storey sports complex on Dalhousie Street between Hill Street and Renfrew Street.

==Buildings==
Garnethill is a conservation area and contains several listed buildings, most significantly Glasgow School of Art designed by Charles Rennie Macintosh. Housing listed includes Breadalbane Terrace built between 1845 - 1855 by Charles Wilson. Heritage buildings which are now apartments include the first Beatson Cancer Hospital, in Hill Street, and the Glasgow High School for Girls, in Buccleuch Street.

The rebuilding of the fire-damaged, and twice gutted, unique Mackintosh Building of Glasgow School of Art in Renfrew Street is awaited.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Garnethill became the principal centre of Scotland&#x27;s Chinese community, with Cantonese speaking immigrants from Hong Kong settling in the area. Most had already settled in the UK, and moved north from England. As a result, the neighbourhood is home to Glasgow&#x27;s Chinatown shopping mall on New City Road.

==Streets==
Garnethill comprises the following streets:
*West Graham Street
*Buccleuch Street
*Hill Street, which was home to 4 of the last 15 Turner Prize winners
*Renfrew Street
*Garnet Street
*Garnethill Street
*Scott Street
*Dalhousie Street
*Rose Street
*New City Road
*Shamrock Street
*Cambridge Street

==Community groups==

The Community Council is the longest established community group in Garnethill (since 1970&#x27;s), and is currently operating with all ten positions filled following an election held in October 2023. The Community Councillors meet the second Monday of the month 7pm-9pm, in person in Garnethill Multicultural Centre, 21 Rose Street, Glasgow G3 6RE and also on Zoom. The meetings are open to the public and deal with community development, local issues, planning and licensing issues etc. Attendees include Local councillors, Glasgow Art School, Glasgow Film Theatre, local religious buildings, Police Scotland. 

A Neighbourhood Watch was setup in 2017 and they hold their public meetings in the Garnethill Multicultural Centre. Police Scotland are normally invited along to provide any updates, and for residents to raise any issues.

The Friends of Garnethill Greenspaces (FROGGS) is a constituted group whose focus is the green spaces of Garnethill, including the Garnethill Park. They organise and publicise regular community meetings e.g. litter picks and firing up of the Bread Oven in the park, etc. They have sourced funding and provided attractive planters on railings around the area.

There is also a Garnetbank Parents Council which has been running for many years, and is a group of parents whose offspring attend the Garnetbank Primary School on Renfrew Street. They operate mainly on Facebook and Twitter.

Celebrities who have visited the Oxford chip shop on Hill Street include Jeremy Corbyn, Kiera Knightley, Susan Boyle. 

Glasgow Film Theatre was built in 1939 and was Scotland&#x27;s first arts cinema. Hollywood directors Quentin Tarentino, Martin Scorsese, Baz Luhrmann have visited here.

<doc id="1067415" wikidata="Q602963" url="?curid=1067415" title="Glacial period">
<text>A glacial period (alternatively glacial or glaciation) is an interval of time (thousands of years) within an ice age that is marked by colder temperatures and glacier advances. Interglacials, on the other hand, are periods of warmer climate between glacial periods. The Last Glacial Period ended about 15,000 years ago. The Holocene is the current interglacial. A time with no glaciers on Earth is considered a greenhouse climate state.
==Quaternary Period==
Within the Quaternary, which started about 2.6 million years before present, there have been a number of glacials and interglacials. At least eight glacial cycles have occurred in the last 740,000 years alone.

==Penultimate Glacial Period==

The Penultimate Glacial Period (PGP) is the glacial period that occurred before the Last Glacial Period. It began about 194,000 years ago and ended 135,000 years ago, with the beginning of the Eemian interglacial.

==Last Glacial Period==

The last glacial period was the most recent glacial period within the Quaternary glaciation at the end of the Pleistocene, and began about 110,000 years ago and ended about 11,700 years ago. The glaciations that occurred during the glacial period covered many areas of the Northern Hemisphere and have different names, depending on their geographic distributions: &quot;Wisconsin&quot; (in North America), &quot;Devensian&quot; (in Great Britain), &quot;Midlandian&quot; (in Ireland), &quot;Würm&quot; (in the Alps), &quot;Weichsel&quot; (in northern Central Europe), &quot;Dali&quot; (in East China), &quot;Beiye&quot; (in North China), &quot;Taibai&quot; (in Shaanxi) &quot;Luoji Shan&quot; (in southwest Sichuan), &quot;Zagunao&quot; (in northwest Sichuan), &quot;Tianchi&quot; (in the Tian Shan) &quot;Jomolungma&quot; (in the Himalayas), and &quot;Llanquihue&quot; (in Chile). The glacial advance reached the Last Glacial Maximum about 26,500 BP. In Europe, the ice sheet reached Northern Germany. Over the last 650,000 years, there have been on average seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat.

==Next glacial period==

Since orbital variations are predictable, computer models that relate orbital variations to climate can predict future climate possibilities. 
Work by Berger and Loutre suggests that the current warm climate may last another 50,000 years. The amount of heat trapping (greenhouse) gases being emitted into the Earth&#x27;s oceans and its atmosphere may delay the next glacial period by an additional 50,000 years.

<text>The New Zealand Air Training Corps (also known as Air Cadets and ATC) is one of the three corps in the New Zealand Cadet Forces (NZCF), alongside the New Zealand Sea Cadet Corps and the New Zealand Cadet Corps. It is funded in partnership between the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) and local communities. Members are civilians with no obligation to enlist in the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF). Should a cadet enlist, their service in the ATC cadet does not translate into higher pay, rank, or seniority. 

The ATC&#x27;s mission is to develop and enable self-disciplined, confident and responsible young people, with a vision to prepare New Zealand&#x27;s successful leaders of tomorrow. As of 2021 the Air Training Corps has approximately 2000 personnel, including 202 commissioned officers.

==History==
=== British roots ===
In the late 1930s, with the increase of military aircraft technology and the decrease of war-time resources, the Royal Air Force (RAF) struggled to find sufficient numbers of suitable recruits. To overcome this problem, the Air League of the British Empire launched its Air Defence Cadet Corps in 1938, replaced by the Air Training Corps in February 1941. It ran in schools with the aim to train boys aged 16–17.5 so they could enter the RAF at the age of 18 without needing to complete basic training.

=== Foundation and World War II ===

The first proposal for an Air Corps in New Zealand came in August 1940 from Lord Galway. Early the following year, a review of aircrew requirements found that there would be difficulty obtaining sufficient recruits by the end of 1942. Authority was given by War Cabinet in February 1941 to form an Air Cadet Training Corps, the name subsequently being standardised as Air Training Corps (ATC). &#x27;&quot;Town&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;&quot;School&quot;&#x27; and &quot;&#x27;Country&quot;&#x27; units were set up in major cities, training young men between 16.5 and 18 years of age. The first squadron was No 1 SQN in Wellington and No 2 SQN in Petone, both formed at the same time.

With New Zealand considered to be at risk from Japanese invasion and the British not in a position to help, the ATC&#x27;s purpose was to prepare potential airmen to join the RNZAF when they came of age by training them in basic airmanship and providing an insight into Air Force work. The ATC peaked during World War II at approximately 9200 cadets, and provided 3500 recruits to the RNZAF. By the end of the war, unit numbers had risen to 105 town units and 64 school units, but when the war ended in August 1945 unit and cadet numbers began to decline.

=== Post World War II and compulsory military training ===

The introduction of compulsory military training brought a period of crisis for the ATC. If the RNZAF could get sufficient recruits from conscripted trainees there would be little need for an ATC. Premises were in poor shape, equipment was short, and there was a serious shortage of instructors. It was decided that the ATC lacked good officers, and that the regular force provided insufficient assistance. Steps were taken to improve the ATC by reducing the lower age limit to 15 years, closing some smaller units and holding a refresher course for instructors.

Compulsory military training was abolished in 1958 and replaced by a ballot system of conscripted service for randomly selected 20-year-old males, which operated between 1960 and 1970. By 1964 the Combined Cadet Forces reached a peak strength of 198 units, with 1000 officers and about 56,000 cadets.

In 1962 the Air Training Corps celebrated its 21st anniversary. Celebrations were held around the country including a rugby game held at RNZAF Station Hobsonville in September and a team of cadets making an ultra-marathon relay run from Invercargill to Hobsonville, a distance of over 1,600km.

=== Modernization and restructuring ===

By 1970 Sea Cadet and ATC units had decreased to 55 units with 3,200 cadets. In 1971 the government decided to disband the ATC. This caused a public outcry, with support for the ATC coming from such organisations as the Returned Services Association, Brevet Clubs and the Air Force Association, forcing the Government to reconsider its decision. Instead, from 1972 the ATC was separated from the RNZAF and came under the umbrella of the newly formed NZCF, along with the Sea Cadets and New Zealand Cadet Corps, as a voluntary organisation under the Minister of Defence&#x27;s responsibility. Units were required to be initiated and funded by the community. The Chief of Defence Forces was authorised to &quot;direct and supervise&quot; the Cadet Forces and provide military support, initially restricted to providing uniforms, training and equipment at a cost no greater than $400,000.

Although no longer an integral part of the services, the ATC is still administered by the Ministry of Defence. Under new legislation, the Air Cadet League was formed for the purpose of providing a supporting and funding role, although part of the annual Defence vote is still allocated to the Cadet Forces.

Centralised supervision was established under a Commandant. Regular Force Defence personnel, under the control of the Commandant, provided support units at five locations around New Zealand. ATC Officers ceased to have &quot;Queen&#x27;s Commissions&quot; and are appointed by the Minister of Defence with Cadet Force commissions, effectively remaining civilian volunteers on an unpaid basis with authority to wear military uniform and rank.

Women were first accepted into the ATC in 1978 as a result of the Human Rights Commission Act 1977. The first recorded Woman to hold a commission in the New Zealand Air Training Corps was on the 28th of July 1978. In 1990, No. 38 (Waimairi) Squadron of the NZCF was the first to appoint a female Cadet Unit Commander. 

During these changes, the focus of the NZCF changed from primarily military training and preparation for the Armed Forces to become predominantly based on adventure and youth development with a military flavour. The aim of this new thrust was to teach &quot;good citizenship skills&quot; to cadets.

By 1985 the ATC had increased to 50 units. A resurgence of interest since 1989, attributed to the movies such as &quot;Top Gun&quot; and &quot;Iron Eagle&quot;, saw unit numbers expand to around 100 units, many in areas that did not previously have cadet units.

=== ATC Golden Jubilee and the new Millennium ===

In 1991 the ATC celebrated its Golden Jubilee. To celebrate and raise its public profile, cadets from every unit in New Zealand participated in a run that started at either end of the country and converged in Wellington. Along the way money was collected and donated to CANTEEN-teenagers with cancer.

In 2001 the ATC celebrated its Diamond Jubilee with special parades held in each area. By this time the ATC comprised 52 Squadrons from Kaitaia to Invercargill and approximately 2500 cadets.

At the beginning of 2010, there were 103 Cadet Force units In New Zealand, and cadet numbers were approximately 4500 with 360 cadet officers.

=== Air Training Corps&#x27; 75th Anniversary ===
The ATC celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2016 with numerous exercises and parades held around the country.

Southern area held exercise &quot;Southern Falcon&quot; at the West Melton Aerodrome, just west of Christchurch. More than 100 cadet force personnel attended, from nine units across the country. Cadets had the opportunity to fly in an RNZAF C-130H as well as visits to aviation facilities around Christchurch. The event ended with a formal dinner at the Air Force Museum.

Central area held exercise &quot;Silver Sparrowhawk&quot; at RNZAF Base Ohakea. The exercise had an attendance of over 150 personnel from nine units all over the lower North Island and functioned as both a celebration and as a friendly competition between central area ATC Squadrons. Activities included flights on RNZAF NH-90 helicopters, a Pōwhiri welcoming the ATC on to the RNZAF Tūrangawaewae. Cadets also participated in a &quot;Village Green&quot;, which included a tug of war, fitness tests, observation exercises, and rogaining. No. 10 (Palmerston North) Squadron was awarded the winning trophy for the event.

Northern area units celebrated the anniversary with a combined parade with all seven of the Auckland ATC Squadrons. This event combined with the 76th anniversary of the Battle of Britain saw more than 320 cadets parade for the Chief of the Air Force, Air Vice Marshall Tony Davies, at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.

=== Air Training Corps&#x27; 80th Anniversary ===
2021 saw the ATC celebrate the 80th year since its formation. The seven local squadrons in Auckland joined with units outside of Auckland and the Auckland Air Force Association to mark both the 80th anniversary of the ATC and the annual Battle of Britain commemoration service.

==Organisation==
===National===
The ATC is managed at a national level by the Commandant (usually a Regular Force Lieutenant-Colonel/Wing Commander/Commander), and their Staff based out of Trentham Army Camp. It is supported by the Air Training Corps Association of New Zealand (ATCANZ).

===Area===
The country is divided into 3 areas, Northern (northern half of the North Island), Central (southern half of the North Island) and Southern (entire South Island). Each area has a NZCF Cadet Force Training and Support Unit (CFTSU), commanded by an Area Coordinator, with Advisors for Air Training Corps Squadrons.

===Unit===
Each unit is managed by the Cadet Unit Commander, in partnership with the unit&#x27;s branch of the ATCANZ. A typical unit has between one and four officers filling various roles. The Cadet Unit Commander appoints all personnel in the unit to their positions. Each unit has an Adjutant, Training Officer, and Stores Officer. These positions are usually filled by commissioned officers (individual officers can hold multiple positions if necessary). One or more of these personnel may have assistants, often junior officers or senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs).

Each unit has a cadet NCO holding the position of Squadron Warrant Officer (who doesn&#x27;t necessarily hold the rank of Cadet Warrant Officer). If the unit is large enough, each flight of cadets may have a Flight Sergeant. The Warrant Officer is normally responsible for supervising the NCOs in their various tasks. The Warrant Officer can skip the normal chain of command to liaise directly with the Unit Commander.

How an individual unit is organised varies widely. A unit&#x27;s organisation depends on its size, number of officers, number of Cadet NCOs, facilities, and the organisational preference of the Cadet Unit Commander.
Cadet units are graded on their parading numbers, which dictates the number of officers each unit may have, and the number of Corporals, Sergeants, Flight Sergeants and Officer Cadets.

== Air Training Corps Association of New Zealand (ATCANZ) ==
The Air Training Corps Association of New Zealand was formed as a result of the Defence Act 1990. This is the secondary support body of the New Zealand Air Training Corps, behind only Headquarters New Zealand Cadet Forces.

The association has a branch in every ATC squadron, made up of up to eight members of that unit. These members are usually parents of cadets belonging to that squadron, however other persons involved in the unit are also able to serve as committee members. The method of selecting committee members is by election of self-nominated personnel during a general meeting. The Cadet Unit Commander or a delegate officer from the unit is also expected to be a sitting member of the committee to ensure that the branch is kept informed of squadron activities and that the branch aligns its practices with the Unit Commander&#x27;s intent and direction.

Each branch has three elected positions: Chairperson, Secretary and Treasurer. People self-nominate for these positions then face election by the general committee.

=== Meetings ===

==== Local branch general meetings ====
Branches convene for annual general meetings shortly after the end of each financial year to elect new position holders and decide strategy for the next year. These meetings are often held at the relevant cadet unit&#x27;s headquarters or the nearest Royal New Zealand Returned and Services&#x27; Association (RSA). Special meetings normally occur on a monthly basis or whenever needed depending on the operational tempo of the squadron.

==== National council annual general meetings ====
Each year the ATCANZ National Council holds an Annual General Meeting. A representative from every ATCANZ branch is invited to attend so the location is chosen to be most convenient for travel. In recent years this has been at RNZAF Base Ohakea.

The purpose of this meeting is to facilitate the meeting of every unit&#x27;s ATCANZ branch and allow them to coordinate on a national level. Often the Minister of Defence will be in attendance, as well as the Commandant NZCF, Assistant Commandant NZCF, and Returned Serviceman Association leadership.

=== Scholarships and awards ===
Each year ATCANZ provides a number of scholarships to Air Training Corps Personnel, including,
* The Sainsbury Awards
* Partial funding for cadets participating in the International Air Cadet Exchange
* Partial funding for cadets participating in the National Aviation course
* Partial funding for cadets participating in the National Gliding course

Further prizes are given to cadets on Air Training Corps aviation courses;
==Uniform and Insignia==

=== Insignia and Badges ===

The uniform worn by ATC members is the same as that of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, except that for all ranks, the lettering on the bottom of the rank insignia shoulder boards reads &quot;&quot;CADET FORCES&quot; rather than &quot;NEW ZEALAND&quot; to differentiate ATC personnel from RNZAF personnel. Officer Service Dress Uniforms have a shoulder flash reading &quot;NEW ZEALAND CADET FORCES&quot; rather than &quot;ROYAL NEW ZEALAND AIR FORCE&quot; for the same reason. Cadets wear a cloth &quot;ATC&quot; cap badge on their flight caps, while officers and officer cadets wear the same cap insignia as RNZAF officers.
Since 2019, all ATC personnel wear dark blue oval badges with &quot;AIR TRAINING CORPS&quot;&quot; on their shoulders to differentiate them from the RNZAF.
Cadets wear a shoulder brassard on their right arm to display their individual achievements, which further distinguishes them from RNZAF personnel. Cadet achievements include The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award, flying/navigation badge, marksman badge and training level badges, and the number and name of the squadron they parade with.
Commissioned Officers, Officer Cadets, National, and Area Warrant Officers do not wear brassards.

=== Uniforms ===
The Air Training Corps follows the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) with regard to uniform standards and clothing items. All mandatory clothing is issued by the RNZAF. 

Before December 2020, each unit was graded on the number of personnel who attended parade nights, and based on this grade, received an annual allowance for cadets&#x27; uniforms. 
Since December 2020, new uniform is issued directly new cadets upon their enrolment into a squadron after their measurements are entered into CadetNet. Units still maintain a local supply of uniform as spares, but the bulk of uniform issued to new recruits comes from Headquarters New Zealand Cadet Forces.

The Air Training Corps currently uses the following uniforms:
=== Air Cadet Working Dress ===
New Zealand disruptive pattern material was adopted as an official ATC uniform in 2002.
In 2018 the NZDF moved away from the disruptive pattern material so the ATC explored new uniforms. The product of that exploration is the &#x27;Cadet Working Dress&#x27; (CWD).

Intended to be introduced in late 2021, the New Zealand Sea Cadet Corps and ATC have a new single multipurpose uniform. The ATC was to adopt the uniform first to free up remaining disruptive pattern material for the New Zealand Cadet Corps. The style of the new uniform was modeled on the RNZAF&#x27;s General Purpose Uniform but was not made of fire-retardant fabric as cadets&#x27; risk of fire was lower. These modifications and bulk ordering made the uniform affordable to the organisation. The Sea Cadet retained the darker blue colour of the Royal New Zealand Navy&#x27;s General Working Dress, but was otherwise identical.

Cadets and Officer are issued a &#x27;pack&#x27; of equipment and uniform from New Zealand Cadet Forces Headquarters that includes their general purpose uniform (No. 6 GP).

As well as the key components of shirt, pants and boots, the New Zealand Cadet Forces also intend to roll out accessories such as rain jackets, either to be supplied or purchased through the NZCF. More accessories are yet to be announced but warm weather equipment such as jerseys, wind breakers, and high visibility vests have been speculated by NZCF personnel.

The supplier for the Cadet Working Dress was based in Fiji, and introduction of the uniform was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic in Fiji.
Roll out of the uniform commenced in July 2021, with more than 300 personnel receiving their uniform by 18 July. By 11 August every Squadron in the South Island had been equipped with Cadet Working Dress with squadrons in the North Island to follow shortly after.

=== Unit Recognition Patches ===
Subject to approval by the Commandant NZCF, Units are authorised to design and produce Unit Recognition Patches (URP) for their personnel to wear. For the ATC, authorised Unit Recognition Patches are square 80 mm x 80 mm patches fastened by Velcro to Cadet Working Dress.

Unit Recognition Patches are commonly gifted to other units as signs of goodwill and friendship but they may only be worn by members belonging to that particular unit. The New Zealand Cadet Forces operate the NZCF logo as a recognition patch, although these are only worn by personnel attached to Headquarters NZCF, or Cadet Force Training and Support Units (CFTSUs).

== Ranks ==
All active Air Cadets are able to work towards being promoted. The size of each unit dictates the number of cadets at each rank that a unit is allowed.

=== Cadet and Non-Commissioned Officer Ranks ===
Cadet and Non-Commissioned Officer ranks are based on the RNZAF ranks, and are:

The CDT prefix/suffix is used to distinguish cadet ranks from those of regular force personnel. The only other difference is that in the RNZAF, LAC stands for Leading Aircraftman

Whilst not all cadets become NCOs, all get the chance to train and progress through the different levels of training, Basic 1, Basic 2, Proficiency, and Advanced, by demonstrating knowledge and skills in subjects including cadet forces knowledge, general service knowledge, leadership, firearms safety, and aviation.

In early 2007, the Chief of Air Staff accepted the introduction of the rank of Leading Air Cadet (LACDT). This is not regarded as an NCO rank but will be awarded to those cadets showing obvious leadership skills or to give seniority to long-serving or older cadets who may not otherwise have been given a chance to go on a junior NCO course. This is the ATC equivalent to the NZCC Lance Corporal and Sea Cadet Corps&#x27; Able Cadet.
=== Commissioned Officer Ranks ===
Air Training Corps Officers also follow RNZAF Ranks:
While New Zealand Cadet Forces Officers hold commissions on behalf the New Zealand Parliament, via the Minister of Defence, they are not entitled to be saluted by New Zealand Defence Force personnel. Due to the rank emblems being identical other than the &quot;&quot;New Zealand&quot; and &quot;Cadet Forces&quot;&quot; identifiers, occasionally Cadet Force Officers are saluted by NZDF personnel. If this happens, Cadet Force Officers are encouraged to return the salute to be polite.

New Zealand Cadet Force Officers do not hold precedence of rank over NZDF personnel e.g. a Cadet Force Squadron leader has no authority to issue orders to a NZDF Pilot Officer or Non-Commissioned Officer.

New Zealand Cadet Force Officers continue to undergo training throughout their career, following the yet to be released NZCF 170O.

==Membership==

=== Cadet members ===
Interested personnel can join between the ages of 13 and 15 (or if attending the first year of high school) and can stay on without being promoted to the age of 18. Senior Non-Commissioned Officers may serve until their 20th birthday.

Other than black lace up shoes, all uniform is provided upon enrolment into a unit and completion of a training camp where wearing of the uniform is taught. Bonds are sometimes held to ensure uniforms are returned.

==== Fees ====
Unit fees are set by each unit Parent Support Committee annually. Due to fluctuating operating costs, these vary from unit to unit dependent on the type of activities the unit has planned, although typically fees will be no more than $200 annually.

=== Adult members ===

==== Adult Cadets ====

In 2017 the New Zealand Cadet Forces updated their Child Protection policy surrounding cadets who are either Non-Commissioned Officers or personnel completing cadet level training who are aged 18 and over.

There is a deliberate delineation between an &#x27;Adult&#x27; and an &#x27;Officer&#x27; as the latter has specific authority to exercise command and control over cadets and other NZCF Officers.

The key difference between a cadet who is an adult and a cadet who is under 18 is that adult cadets, and indeed all adults within the New Zealand Cadet Forces, are charged with the responsibility of maintaining the safety and welfare of cadets during all NZCF activities. While this doesn&#x27;t mean that cadets who are classified as adults hold authority over other cadets due to their age, it does mean that adult cadets are expected to vocalize to an Officer or Supplementary Staff member when they believe safety or welfare have been compromised.

Cadet Non-Commissioned Officers who are 18 or older are issued a thin white band which is sewn into the rank slide immediately above the &quot;CADET FORCES&quot; lettering and below the rank emblem, and a white stripe is placed vertically on the left hand side of the CWD name badge.

==== Officers and supplementary staff ====
Adult Members can serve in two capacities: Commissioned officers or Supplementary Staff. Officers are commissioned into the New Zealand Cadet Forces, with the post-nominal letters NZCF, at the rank of Pilot Officer, and can be promoted after completing the necessary training and service.

In 2014 the organisation introduced a new position of National Support Officer (NSO). This position was designed to place a New Zealand Cadet Force Officer at a high level of influence within Headquarters NZCF, where traditionally positions were solely occupied by New Zealand Defence Force Personnel. In 2016 with the adoption of the continental staff system the position was renamed to &quot;Assistant Commandant.&quot; If he or she is an ATC officer, as opposed to an NZCC or SCC officer, they hold the rank of Wing Commander.

Supplementary Staff or SS for short, are civilians who help train cadets. They do not wear uniform but are generally treated similarly to officers by cadets. Members of the NZDF are occasionally attached to cadet units to assist in conducting training. This is normally because they know a cadet/officer in that unit, or they have a particular interest in cadet forces. They are addressed as &quot;Instructor&quot; or by cadets&#x27; choice, &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;.

==== Fees ====
Most NZCF officers do not pay any membership fees but many choose to contribute, for example by purchasing stationery and equipment for their unit.

== Activities ==
Source:
=== The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Hillary Award ===
==== Officers and adults ====
Any Commissioned Officer in the NZCF or Supplementary Staff member that has an active security clearance is eligible to become an award facilitator, allowing cadets within their unit to actively participate in the award and allows any progress towards the award to be signed off. There is no limit to the number of staff members who can be award facilitators, allowing larger units to focus a staff member to each section of the award.

While the award is directed towards young adults within the NZCF, any adults under the age of 25 are eligible to complete any of the awards (although the Gold award would be the most reasonable).

==== Cadet participation ====
Run in partnership with the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Hillary Awards organisation, the award is a multi-year, voluntary, non-competitive programme of practical, cultural and adventurous activities, designed to support the personal and social development of young people aged 14–25, regardless of gender, background or ability. It offers an individual challenge and encourages young people to undertake exciting, constructive, challenging and enjoyable activities in their free time.

Personnel undertaking the award can begin the activity either through their school, a third party provider, or the New Zealand Cadet Forces with more than 9,000 young adults undertaking the programme each year.

Within the frame of the New Zealand Cadet Forces, parade nights and community service events like Anzac Day parades can count towards the service requirement, while weekend camps and courses can count towards the skill section of the awards. The Cadet Fieldcraft Activity can also count towards the Adventurous Journey for all three awards. Cadets are able to retrospectively claim up to 3 months of work they&#x27;ve done before signing up for their first award. For example, if a cadet completed a NZCF promotional course such as the Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Course shortly before signing up for an award, then they would be able to retroactively use the course for their residential project.

Cadets that successfully complete an award are entitled to wear the pin of the highest award they receive on their brassard.
===Parade Nights===
Every unit holds Parade Nights around 2–4 hours long each week during school terms. Parade nights usually begin and end with a parade. The starting parade is used to raise the RNZAF ensign, to inspect uniforms, and to inform the cadets of the parade night&#x27;s activities. The final parade is used to lower the RNZAF ensign. Cadets are then informed either during parade or at a debrief of upcoming events in the unit. Between the parades, cadets undergo classroom or practical instruction.

===Flying===
Units teach aviation theory as part of the parade nights and units typically organise practical Flying Training for cadets in partnership with local Aero Clubs. There is an annual National Aviation Course, consisting of separate Flying and Navigation flights. Those that opt for the Flying component spend two weeks covering both theory and practical lessons in flying, with First Solo being a common achievement for those over 16 years of age. The Navigation component is a 1-week-long theoretical and practical course covering the NZ CAA Private Pilot Licence syllabus. The practical content includes 4 navigation flights building up from an initial 30-minute map reading exercise to a full two-hour Navigation exercise covering up to distance. As of 2021 the cost of attending the aviation courses for Air Cadets has increased, with the cost per person for those attending the two courses required to pay the following:

* National Power Flying Course – $1,000 (NZD), up from $650 that had previously been charged (which was unadjusted for 6 years).
* National Navigation Course – $440 (NZD)

===Gliding===
As with Flying, Gliding Training is organised by the unit in partnership with local gliding clubs. There is an annual week-long Gliding Course, which is held at Matamata aerodrome. Cadets from all over New Zealand may attend this week-long course. As of 2021 the course costs $550. 

===Field craft activity===
Most units conduct classroom training in bushcraft and survival skills and hold regular Basic and Advanced bushcraft camps in the local area during weekends. The Cadet Fieldcraft activity, renamed and reshaped from the all encompassing &#x27;bushcraft course&#x27;, is a nine-day course that provides Cadets with an enhanced practical experience in field craft to further their outdoor skills training. The cadet section of the course allows between 30 and 60 cadets to travel around the country to meet and interact with cadets from other squadrons. Separately the course serves to train Commissioned Officers to lead and manage cadets on day tramps and/or overnight camps on clearly formed tracks in and below the bush line. Officers are taught leadership, risk and crisis management, bush craft skills, and first aid.

The course is held either at RNZAF Dip Flat in the South Island, Waiouru Army base in the North Island, or occasionally Tekapo Army Camp south west of Christchurch.

===Shooting===
Units conduct regular range training with small-bore rifles. Some units have their own armories and ranges at their parade hall. Cadets must pass a Dry Firing Training Test (DFTT) before being allowed on the range. Cadets who achieve high marks regularly on the range may be awarded a marksmanship badge to be worn on their brassard.

=== Public service ===
Each year the New Zealand Cadet Forces participate in numerous public service events around the country. Anzac Day represents the most public and personnel-intensive deployment for cadet forces, often involving the bulk of the unit&#x27;s forces. Cadets will form cenotaph and catafalque parties on behalf of, and in partnership with the New Zealand Defence Force.

Another high-profile public service is the annual Poppy Day drive by the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services&#x27; Association (RNRSA), where cadets and RSA members work together to raise funds towards helping New Zealand Veterans and the RNRSA.

=== International Air Cadet Exchange (IACE) ===

The International Air Cadet Exchange is an annual exchange programme organised by the International Air Cadet Exchange Association.
Each year the New Zealand Air Training Corps sends a dozen members of the organisation to countries all over the world. The participants can be any rank and a Commissioned NZCF Officer accompanies each group of cadets overseas, providing opportunities for both adult and youth members.

==Local training==

=== Cadets ===
Each Squadron trains at least one night per week at a &quot;parade night&quot; in order to undertake the Cadet Development Framework Each squadron employs a training officer whose role is to create and implement a local training programme. The Cadet Development Framework is a four-year programme which provides cadets with the opportunity to develop skills in leadership, aviation knowledge, drill, firearms training, fieldcraft, and more.

The programme provides standardisation for training and expected development within Cadet Units for CDT – CDTW/O. Some content is applicable to all three Corps of the NZCF, whilst some is specific to particular Corps.

The content of the Four-Year Training Programme is not designed to fill every period during parade nights in a calendar year, but intentionally leaves scope for Cadet Unit Commanders to add content that will add value to their communities, strengthen Unit identity and provide opportunities for cadets that they may not receive outside of NZCF. However, only completion of the prescribed training will ensure that cadets can continue moving through the development model. Delivery of the content of the Four-Year Training Programme is at the Cadet Unit Commander&#x27;s discretion. In time, further resources to assist in delivery will be developed, including parade night lesson plans, instructor guides and additional resources. Where gaps in knowledge or skills exist, Area Advisors and/or Area Support Officers should be engaged.

The training is split into three different levels off learning that correspond with a cadet&#x27;s progression.

* Lead Self – Years 1-2
* Lead Teams – Year 3+
* Lead Leaders – Year 4+


==Competitions==
=== Aviation Skills Competition===
The Aviation Skills Competition (AVSKILLS), is a set of three competitions held across New Zealand, each open to ATC squadrons in their area. This is followed by a national competition, pitting the three winners against each other to determine the top squadron in the country. The competition aims to test cadets on their teamwork, comradeship and capabilities. Cadets are tested on various aspects of their training, including rifle shooting, general service knowledge &amp; cadet forces knowledge (knowledge of the NZDF and NZCF respectively), first aid, drill and navigation.
=== Air League Trophy – Area and national efficiency competition===
At some point in the year, nominated squadrons are inspected by their Area Co-ordinator. They judge them on their standards of drill, knowledge of the ATC curriculum, and general efficiency in running the unit. The three winning squadrons are then inspected by New Zealand Defence Force staff who determine the most efficient unit nationally. Units that win the national competition are awarded the Air League Trophy.

=== Davy Memorial Drill Competition===

The Davy Drill Competition is a Ceremonial Drill competition held annually, in each of the three areas. The competition is only open to the ATC and must consist of no less than 12 people in a marching formation, with one parade commander, which is to be of Senior NCO rank. The winner of each area&#x27;s competition moves onto the National Competition.
The winner of the National competition wins the Davy Memorial Trophy, which was donated in memoriam of Hr. H.A.C Davy, who was the Dominion President of the Air Training Corps Association for a number of years.

=== Shooting Competitions ===

==== Wallingford Shooting Competition====
Source:

The Wallingford Shooting Competition represents the New Zealand Air Training Corps national shooting competition. All NZCF Air Training Corps squadrons are eligible for the competition.

Air Commodore S. Wallingford CB, CBE, who was for many years President of the RNZAF Small Arms Association, donated this trophy for team postal competition to encourage rifle shooting in the Air Training Corps. This cup is awarded to the winning team of the Air Training Corps small-bore postal shoot.

This competition also represents one of a few opportunities for ATC personnel to earn the NZCF Marksman Badge, the others being:

==== Ffennell Shooting Competition====
The Ffennell competitions are a group of small-bore rifle matches for the youth of the Commonwealth. New Zealand Cadet Forces units contest the Class B competitions (using issued rifles and sights). The matches are held under the authority of the Commonwealth Postal Competitions Committee (CPCC). All international correspondence on behalf of the CPCC will be handled by the Council for Cadet Rifle Shooting.

The aim of these team matches is to encourage the Youth of the Commonwealth to participate in the sport of small-bore target rifle shooting.

Entry is open to any unit or sub-unit of the following:

# New Zealand Cadet Forces;
# Junior Servicemen of the New Zealand Defence Forces in one establishment; and
# Other youth groups approved by the CPCC.

Units may enter one or more teams. Each team shall consist of eight firers. A shooter cannot shoot on more than one team. The team captain may or may not be one of these eight. All members of the team must be under the age of 19 years on the day of firing the match, and be serving members of the same unit or sub-unit.

Each team member will fire two cards, 10 rounds to count being fired at each card, with two rounds fired at each aiming mark. Sighting shots will be completed before the practice begins. The whole team need not complete shooting in one day. Highest Possible Score (HPS) is 200. Team HPS is 1600.

<text>Gilbert Saint Elmo Heron (9 April 1922 – 27 November 2008) was a Jamaican professional footballer. He was the first black player to play for Scottish club Celtic and was the father of poet and musician Gil Scott-Heron.

==Career==
Born Gilbert Heron in Kingston, Jamaica, to Walter Gilbert Heron and Lucille Gentles, he came from a family of means. He played for St Georges College, a prominent Jamaican high school, and won the Manning Cup and Oliver Shield in 1937 – a statement of island-wide, schoolboy football supremacy. He went on to represent a Caribbean all-star football team and beat Jamaican Olympian Herb McKenley as a schoolboy.

He moved to Canada as a youth and was later enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force. As well as being a track athlete and a boxer, he played football and broke through during his stay there. A centre forward, he signed for Detroit Corinthians and the champion Detroit Wolverines, where he was top goalscorer in the 1946 season of the North American Soccer Football League. He then played for the Chicago Maroons in 1947.

After playing for Chicago Sparta in 1949, he played for Windsor Corinthians in 1950 and was twice selected to all-star teams against the touring England national team. After missing the first match with the Ontario All-Stars on May 24 (on account of a league suspension in Detroit), he recorded an assist for the Essex All-Stars in the June 17 match (albeit a 9–2 loss to England). Both Gil and his brother Lee played for the Essex All-Stars.

He was spotted by a scout from Glasgow club Celtic while the club was on tour in North America and he was signed by the Scottish club in 1951 after being invited over for a trial. Becoming the first black player for Celtic, and one of the first to play professionally in Scotland, Heron went on to score on his debut on 18 August 1951 in a League Cup tie against Morton that Celtic won 2–0. Heron only played five first-team matches in all, scoring twice. He was released by the club the next year after making one appearance in the Scottish Football League (having been unable to displace the established John McPhail) and joined Third Lanark, where he played in seven League Cup matches, scoring five goals but did not appear in the League.

Next, he went to English club Kidderminster Harriers, before moving back to North America.

In 1957, he played for Windsor Corinthians and was again selected to Ontario&#x27;s Essex All-Stars to face a touring English team, Tottenham Hotspur, on 22 May.

==Personal life==
While in Chicago, Heron met Bobbie Scott, a singer, with whom he had a son in 1949, Gil Scott-Heron, who became a famed poet and musician. They separated when Heron left for Scotland and did not meet again until Scott-Heron was 26. Heron had three more children with his wife Margaret Frize (deceased), whom he met while in Glasgow, Scotland: Gayle, Denis and his youngest child Kenneth, who was killed in Detroit. His older brother, Roy Trevor Gilbert Heron, served with the Norwegian Merchant Navy during World War II and then joined the Canadian army, later moving to Canada, where he became active in black Canadian politics.

At Celtic, he earned the nicknames &quot;The Black Arrow&quot; and &quot;The Black Flash&quot;. While living in Glasgow, he played cricket with leading local clubs such as Poloc. He later became a published poet, with one of his works, &quot;The Great Ones&quot;, describing leading players from his time playing football in Scotland.

Heron died in Detroit of a heart attack on 27 November 2008, aged 86.

<text>The New Zealand Cadet Forces (Cadet Forces or NZCF) is a voluntary military-style training organisation for New Zealand youth between the ages of 13 and 21. Run in partnership with the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) and local community organisations. Through its three branches, the New Zealand Cadet Forces provide young adults with a four-year training curriculum, while a number of local, area, and national camps and courses provide further experience and qualifications. It is jointly funded by the Ministry of Defence, the Royal New Zealand Returned Services&#x27; Association, local communities, and the Associated charities belonging to each branch (CCANZ, SCANZ, ATCANZ). Overall it is directed by Air Marshal Kevin Short, Chief of Defence Force. Cadets are not under any obligation to join the New Zealand Defence Force, however many choose to do so upon turning 18 years old.

==Organization==
It is composed of three Branches or Corps (similar to the New Zealand Defence Force):

* New Zealand Cadet Corps (NZCC)
* Sea Cadet Corps (SCC)
* Air Training Corps (ATC).

The New Zealand Cadet Forces is commanded by the Commandant New Zealand Cadet Forces (COMDT NZCF). Assisting the Commandant is the Executive Officer NZCF (XO NZCF), the Assistant Commandant (ASST COMDT NZDF), and the Warrant Officer New Zealand Cadet Forces (WONZCF).

Training is provided by Cadet Force Officers, Cadet Non-Commissioned Officers, and adult volunteers through Cadet Units nationwide. Supported by three Cadet Force Training and Support Units (CFTSU) composed of NZDF Regular Force (RF) personnel. The New Zealand Cadet Forces also play a large role in supporting community projects through volunteer labour.

== History ==

===1864–1902===
The first unit raised was at Otago Boys&#x27; High School in 1864, making it one of the oldest youth service organisations in New Zealand. By 1870 there were several secondary school units in existence, among the first being Nelson College, Christ&#x27;s College, Wellington College and Auckland Grammar School.

From 1864 until 1902 the training followed that used in the British public schools. The emphasis was on rigid discipline and shooting marksmanship and it was entirely controlled by the Headmaster; the Army was not involved. The Education Act of 1902 was responsible for most secondary schools forming cadet units and the Army became directly involved in the Cadets training following their Boer War participation.

===1903–1940===
In 1911, Lord Kitchener stated, during his visit to New Zealand, that the Cadet movement had an important role to play in the Defence of the Empire. Subsequently, the Army began to provide uniforms, rifles and other equipment to the units. This Army support continued through World War I, with many school cadets making up the officers and non-commissioned officers of the First Expeditionary Force.

In 1919 Compulsory Military Training was for all males from 14 – 21 years, thus Cadet units were structured into Cadet Battalions. Territorial regiments were raised and on completion of Secondary school schoolboys were posted to these Regiments.

In 1932 CMT was abolished, but most Cadet Units continued at the schools on a voluntary basis, supported by teachers who had experienced World War I. During World War II the Army could not support the cadet movement but Officers ineligible for war service continued to manage the organisation.

In 1929 the first open Sea Cadet Corps was formed in Christchurch, by the Canterbury Navy League. Units formed in the four main centres and were controlled nationally by the Canterbury branch of the League. The Navy League continued to manage these open community Sea Cadet units even when they came under the control of the Royal New Zealand Navy.

===1941–1970===
The Air Training Corps was formed in September 1941, Its purpose was to train potential airmen, providing basic knowledge and training as well as to provide an insight into Air Force work to prepare young men for the Air Force when they were old enough.

In the 1950s specialist training appropriate to their parent service was introduced for the cadet forces. The rate of increase in the cadet movement from 1948 – 1960 eventually proved counter productive in the 1960s as the Army could not effectively support the numbers while meeting their own commitments.

By 1964 the NZCF reached peak strength, mainly in school units of 198 units, with 1,000 officers and about 54,000 cadets.

Reorganisation saw many schools cease cadet support and by 1965 there were about 20,000 cadets; further changes to support by the Army and the communities reduced school cadet numbers to 34 units and 10,300 cadets by 1970. Open community Sea Cadet Corps and Air Training Corps units had, meanwhile, slowly decreased to 55 units with 3,200 cadets.

===1971–1984===
Centralised supervision was established by the Chief of Defence Force of all three Corps and a Commandant appointed with Regular Force Defence personnel, under the control of the Commandant, provided at 5 locations around New Zealand to support units. Cadet Force officers were appointed by the Minister of Defence with Cadet Force commissions, on a voluntary unpaid basis with authority to wear military uniform and rank.

The 1971 Defence Act, established the NZCF, as a volunteer organisation, for which the Minister of Defence was responsible. The open units were required to be initiated and funded by the community and the Chief of Defence Force was authorised to &quot;direct and supervise&quot; the NZCF and provide military support which was initially confirmed as uniforms, training and some equipment at a cost of no greater than $400,000.

The role of the NZCF ceased being primarily of military training and the preparation of young men for the Armed Forces and became predominantly adventure and development motivated with a military flavour and about 50% military subjects associated with providing knowledge of the roles and functions of the NZDF. The new thrust was to provide &quot;good citizenship skills&quot; to young men under the training methods used by the Military Forces.

Female cadets were accepted from 1977 and although the service flavour and well tried and tested services training methods and character was retained, additional training was introduced by units, which were desired by them and the community supporters.

===1985–1990===
The loss of Government financial support and turbulent social change in the 1970s caused school units to be abandoned such that by 1985 there were only 9 remaining units, including the two earliest formed at Christ&#x27;s and Nelson Colleges. Meanwhile, the Sea Cadet Corps had increased to 17 units and the ATC to 50 in the open community units. A significant development saw the introduction of Cadet Corps Units into the open community to satisfy the demand which the schools had abandoned, the first open Cadet Unit being the City of Porirua unit in October 1985.

=== 1991–2010 ===
In 1991 the ATC celebrated its Golden Jubilee, 50 years since it was formed. To celebrate and raise its public profile a relay run was organised in which cadets from every unit in NZ participated. It started at either end of the country and converged in Wellington. Along the way money was collected and donated to CANTEEN-teenagers with cancer.

In 2001 the ATC celebrated its Diamond Jubilee of 60 years in operation with special parades held in each area. By this time the ATC comprised 52 Squadrons spread from Kaitaia to Invercargill and approximately 2500 cadets.

At the beginning of 2010, there were 103 Cadet Force units In New Zealand, and cadet numbers approximately 4500 with 360 cadet officers.

=== 2010–2019 ===
Cadet 150

In 2014 the NZ Cadet Forces celebrated 150 years as one of New Zealand&#x27;s oldest youth organisations. This saw most of their personnel hold the largest cadet exercise in 50 years, &#x27;Cadet 150&#x27;. Held at Waiouru Army Camp, the exercise ran from January 24-30th and had cadets from every unit attending. In total around 1200 Personnel attended the event, with approximately 120 personnel being invited from allied cadet forces around the world, including:

* 6 Cadets and 1 Officer from the Canadian Cadet Organisation
* 70 Cadets and Officers from the Australian Defence Cadets. These personnel were transported to New Zealand via RAAF C-130J aircraft.

Upon arrival all cadets were separated in to 25 different teams sorted Alpha – Yankee. These Platoons represented the group cadets would belong to for the week long activity and dictated when cadets would be eating and their accommodation and was relevant to the elective that the attending cadet had chosen.

Before arriving, personnel were able to nominate an elective to participate in, which determined a set of activities they participated in:

Land Elective

The Land Elective was a day tramp over the Tongariro Crossing in the Tongariro National Park volcanic plateau.

Water Elective

The Water Elective included sailing, kayaking, life raft experience and abseiling off a dam. Conducted at Lake Moawhango.

Air Elective

The Air Elective included an air experience flight, a flight simulator, military aircraft static displays, as well as RNZAF unit presentations. Conducted at RNZAF Base Ohakea. Cadets were transported via contracted bus services to RNZAF Base Ohakea early in the morning.

General Training Programme

As well as their chosen elective, attending personnel also participated in the following activities:

2014 - Operation Tauira

2014 saw the implementation of Operation Tauira, a four-year, complete overhaul of the NZCF to better align the organisation with legislation and volunteer organisation best practice, improving the linkages with the NZDF recruiting objectives and to better enable achievement of the NZCF mission. Operation Tauira also implemented deliberate future-proofing initiatives to reduce risk, particularly in health and safety, reputation and relationship management. Along with the changes the NZCF saw a complete the restructure of the Headquarters element. The new structure saw the NZCF adopt the NATO style continental staff system, with NZCF commissioned officers now taking a bigger role in running the organisation at the national and area levels. This change saw the appointment of the first ever senior NZCF officer at the rank of a Wing Commander who has control over the day to day Cadet Force volunteers, and their operational running of the organisation in consultation with the Commandant NZCF.

2017 - Battle of Passchendaele, Youth Ambassadors

On 11 August 2016 the Ministry for Veteran&#x27;s Affairs announced the &quot;2016 Battle of Passchendaele Multi-Media Competition&quot;. Two personnel from the NZCF were selected from the general competition (Available to all year 13 students in New Zealand) to take part in the Youth Ambassadors delegation to travel to Belgium. The NZCF also sent along official representatives.

2018 - Visual Identity System

In August 2018, the New Zealand Cadet Forces introduce a new Visual Identity System. Under this new system the NZCF allowed the use of Navy Cadets, Army Cadets, and Air Cadets for the members of the Sea Cadet Corps, the New Zealand Cadet Corps, and the Air Training Corps respectively. The system also introduced a new logo for each corps and a primary logo for the NZCF. The primary logo is an amalgamation of the three separate corps logos. &quot;The new NZCF logo is an opportunity to refresh and modernise the NZCF brand. It is a clean and modern visual representation of the three component organisations which comprise the NZCF.&quot; The badges of the three cadet forces remain official emblems. These badges have Royal Assent and are protected by the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981.

2018 - CadetNet

CadetNet is an online website based intranet developed in house by New Zealand Cadet Forces personnel that is designed to optimize processes and act as a singular source for information and material related to the New Zealand Cadet Forces. The system is operated by, and only accessible by active members of the organisation.

Early Release

The concept for a Cadet Forces online hub began in 2014 with several years’ work being undertaken by a small group of NZCF Officers. In 2018 an early version of an integrated online hub for all cadet needs was released named &quot;CadetNet&quot;. Developed by the S6 – Communications and Information Systems branch of Headquarters, and managed by project leader SQNLDR S. Hobbs, NZCF. This early role out to officers and a limited number of units included basic functionality such as a repository of manuals and information relevant to the routine operation and training of NZCF personnel. Over the course of the year more systems were rolled out unit by unit, such as a tab based system for different branches of the organisation. In practice this meant if a person within the organisation wanted to find out about uniform, they could go the &quot;S4 – Logistics&quot; tab and find the manual relevant to the uniform they wanted to know about.

The other half of CadetNet included digital profiles for all personnel. Meaning all members of the New Zealand Cadet Forces could be uniquely recorded in a single database for the first time in the organisations history. These profiles allow personnel to update their personal details such as changes in address and contact details. With a comprehensive privacy policy ensuring the data of each individual can&#x27;t be accessed without appropriate permissions.

The profiles also allow the ability for cadets to see a history of their promotions, awards they&#x27;ve received courses and camps they&#x27;ve completed, creating a &quot;Cadet CV&quot;. While this doesn&#x27;t make the NZCF record of service books that all cadets are issued redundant, this enables cadets to track their record of achievements using a more convenient medium.

In mid 2018 a new version was released that included automatic compiling of the NZCF 20 form. The NZCF 20 form is a monthly report detailing the number of each rank that paraded with that unit, any activities and events that the unit undertook, and a forecast of events happening in the upcoming month. This CadetNet update reduced the role the adjutant plays to double checking the results are correct and signing off on them.

Full release

In late 2018 and early 2019 the first organisation wide release occurred with all personnel of all rank being required to supply (in addition to what is required upon enrolment) an email and two separate next of kin who must have basic contact details (Contact number, email, address).

At this point more functions had been introduced with the goal of streamlining and reducing workload on officers. In addition to the digitization of the NZCF 20 form, Cadets were able to directly apply for courses and eventually unit activities directly through the CadetNet portal. Previously if personnel wanted to attend a course they would have to rely on NZCF staff promulgating the Annual Training Programme issued from Headquarters, request and complete the NZCF Form 8, supply it to their unit&#x27;s adjutant, then the adjutant would have to collate all applications and email the successful applications (subject to Cadet Unit Commander&#x27;s approval) to Headquarters. With CadetNet this shortened to a cadet being able to see all upcoming courses they are eligible for and applying directly to them, this means from a staff point of view all that&#x27;s necessary is to select the applicants and forward them to headquarters.

2019 - RNZAF Base Auckland - New Youth Facility

On 29 June 2019 the New Zealand Defence Force opened a new youth development facility on the grounds of RNZAF Base Auckland. The new facility, which has accommodation for up to 120 personnel will give the NZCF another facility to utilise for promotional NCO courses (SNCO and JNCO course primarily) and shooting courses, which will see the NZCF use the nearby 25m range.

The first use of the facility by the NZCF was a Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Course, which ran from 15 to 21 July 2020. Since this the facility has been used for numerous courses and competitions. The primary benefit for the facility is the location, with most Northern Area units being based in or around Auckland, there are fewer logistical challenges than transporting personnel to Whangaparāoa (Tamaki Leadership Centre).

=== 2020–2021 ===
After the success of the Cadet 150 exercise the organisation wanted to capitalise on the planning and experience gained. This came to fruition from 19 to 26 January 2020, the New Zealand Cadet Forces held exercise Cadet 2020. While originally the exercise was scheduled to be held at Tekapo Military Camp, due to logistical challenges the location was changed to Waiouru Army Camp. The exercise saw approximately 1000 cadets and 250 officers from the New Zealand Cadet Forces attend as well as personnel from the New Zealand Defence in support, providing the venue and logistical support for the exercise.

Using the experience from the Cadet 150 Exercise, the activity was expanded to accommodate more activities and experiences, but unlike Cadet 150, was not opened to the cadet forces of other nations.

The exercise was fortunate in its timing, as the first case of COVID-19 was reported in New Zealand less than a month after the exercise. This was closely followed by an announcement from the NZCF Headquarters of &quot;an operational pause to all NZCF activities&quot;.

Similar to the Cadet 150 exercise, before cadets arrived they were given the option of 4 electives to choose from;

* Air Elective, Land Elective, Adventure Elective and Maritime Elective. Furthermore, for four days of the activity cadets were grouped into formations for a &#x27;round robin&#x27; training programme where they were able to experience;
2020 - COVID-19 Effects on the NZCF

Due to the effects of COVID-19 in New Zealand, Headquarters New Zealand Cadet Forces declared an &quot;Operational Pause on ALL NZCF ACTIVITIES&quot; at 11:59pm on 22 March 2020. To be reviewed on a weekly basis, while all of New Zealand remained at Alert Level 3 or above then all NZCF activities ceased. The cause for this &quot;Operational Pause&quot; was for two reasons;

# To prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the organisation and comply with government restrictions on the size of gatherings.
# To free up NZDF personnel in NZCF roles for recall to other positions for Operation PROTECT.

Due to the multiple COVID-19 resurgences in New Zealand there have been further operational pauses, forcing NZCF units to rapidly shift to online learning tools. Due to the continued closure of NZ borders all international exchanges have been indefinitely postponed.

== Composition ==

=== Headquarters ===
New Zealand Cadet Forces&#x27; headquarters element is based in Trentham Army Camp The commandant and New Zealand Defence Force Headquarters staff work out of this office. Each Area (Northern, Central, and Southern) also have their own offices which they use to administer their areas. Each area is normally led by a regular force commissioned officer, however occasionally senior non-commissioned officers hold the position. The Commandant of New Zealand Cadet Forces is typically a senior New Zealand Defence Force officer (LTCOL/E) and is drawn from any of the three NZDF branches.

National and Area Warrant Officers

2017 saw the introduction of four new Warrant Officer positions for senior cadet NCOs. These positions are to allow a direct line of communication from cadets to the senior staff of the New Zealand Cadet Forces. The individual who holds the Warrant Officer New Zealand Cadet Forces position is a member of the Headquarters NZCF leadership team. They are mandated to render advice on any matters within the NZCF environment, but with particular focus on strategic matters affecting personnel, training, and welfare. The Warrant Officer of the New Zealand Cadet Forces reports directly to the Commandant, NZCF.

Area Warrant Officers operate in a similar, more regional capacity. These individuals are a supplementary member of the Cadet Force Training and Support Unit (CFTSU) of their relevant Area. Just like the National Warrant Officer these personnel are mandated to render advice on any matters within the NZCF environment, but with particular focus on matters affecting personnel and training and welfare in their areas. They work in partnership with the Area Coordinators and Area Support Officers in their region as well as corresponding with both the National Warrant Officer and holding regular conferences with the Unit Warrant Officers and Company Sergeant Majors in their regions to establish a consistent and effective strategy.

The four positions are as follows;

* Warrant Officer Cadet Forces
* Warrant Officer Northern Area
* Warrant Officer Central Area
* Warrant Officer Southern Area

The positions are intended for senior cadets who have held the position of Warrant Officer or Company Sergeant Major within a cadet unit of any corps. Air Training Corps and Sea Cadet Corps personnel are attributed the rank Cadet Warrant Officer, New Zealand Cadet Corps personnel are given the rank Cadet Warrant Officer Class 1.

In order for personnel to eligible for any of the four positions they must:

* Be a senior Warrant Officer or Warrant Officer Class II who has completed at least one year acting as a Cadet Unit Warrant Officer.
* Have the experience, ability and capacity to provide support and advice at strategic and operation levels;
* Have the ability to establish and maintain professional relationships at all levels.

Personnel selected for either an Area or National Warrant Officer position are appointed for a two-year period.


=== Branches ===
The Cadet Forces is made up of three branches or corps. Each corps is modelled on a corresponding branch of the NZDF: the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN), the New Zealand Army and the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF).

Each corps has its own training curriculum, uniforms and organisational structures aligned with its parent regular force branch.
==== New Zealand Cadet Corps ====
The New Zealand Cadet Corps (NZCC) is the land component of the NZCF and Aligned with the New Zealand Army. Founded in 1864 the NZCC is the oldest branch of the New Zealand Cadet Forces. The NZCC represent the second smallest of the three Cadet branches, and as of 2024 there are 34 units across New Zealand.

Cadet Corps training includes drill, first aid, land based navigation, land based search and rescue (SAR), survival skills, familiarisation with military tactics and equipment and dedicated firearms training. Each NZCC unit is sponsored by a unit in the New Zealand Army which give NZCC personnel unique opportunities to accompany and participate in army activities and become familiar with army equipment. Each area (Southern, Central, Northern) hold an annual Skills competition with all units being eligible to compete in, focusing on competitive application of core skills, with the winning team from each area later in the year competing at a national competition. A national course in fieldcraft is also offered.
==== Sea Cadet Corps ====
The Sea Cadet Corps (SCC) is the maritime arm of the NZCF, and is aligned with the RNZN. Founded in 1929 the SCC is the smallest of the three branches; as of 2021 the SCC has 17 Training Ships across New Zealand.

Sea Cadet Corps&#x27; training focus is marine based, with a large volume of spent sailing allowing personnel to develop their skills on the water including a swimming test in the beginning of service. To supplement core training, the SCC also provides its personnel with training in fieldcraft, firearms training, land and sea navigation, radio procedures, and other useful skills. Each area (Southern, Central, Northern) hold an annual regatta with all Training Ships, focusing on competitive application of core skills, with the winning team from each area later in the year competing at a national competition.

The two sailing boats that the SCC use are the Crown and the RS Feva. The Crown is a 4-person dinghy, specifically designed for the use of the units. The RS Feva&#x27;s serves as a more modern vessel which could be raced in local, national and international regattas.
==== Air Training Corps ====

The Air Training Corps (ATC) is the aviation arm of the NZCF and is aligned with the RNZAF. Formed in September 1941 originally for the purpose of training young pilots ready for active service. As of 2021 there are 49 ATC squadrons across New Zealand.

The ATC curriculum contains aviation, fieldcraft, drill, leadership, search and rescue (SAR), survival skills, organisational knowledge of NZDF and NZCF and firearms training. National courses are provided in powered flying, aeronautical navigation, gliding and fieldcraft. Each area (Southern, Central, Northern) hold an annual skills competition for all squadrons, focusing on competitive application of core aviation skills, with the winning team from each area later in the year competing at a national competition.

====NZCF Structure====
The NZDF and the NZCF work together in a combined structure to deliver the NZCF&#x27;s Mission and Core Values.

The NZDF provides 27 regular force personnel and six NZDF civilian employees to perform training development, administration and logistics for Cadet Force operations. These operations are commanded from HQNZCF, based in Trentham Military Camp in Wellington.

There are three Cadet Force Training Support Units (CFTSUs), each covering a Cadet Force region and operating from an NZDF establishment. Northern Area CFTSU is based in RNZAF Base Auckland; Central Area CFTSU at RNZAF Base Ohakea near Palmerston North; and Southern Area CFTSU at Burnham Military Camp just South of Christchurch.

The New Zealand Cadet Force is under the command of the Commandant NZCF. The Commandant of the NZCF is typically given a three-year appointment, however, some choose to renew their appointment, or otherwise are required to leave their command early due to extraordinary circumstances.

Working alongside the NZDF personnel are NZCF Officers and Senior Cadets from all three Corps appointed to key strategic, operational and tactical positions.

They provide:
*Policy advice and recommendations that will enhance both the support and training.
*Representation to the community meeting the Government/Community partnership requirement to develop and implement strategies for growth by raising the national profile of the NZCF.
*Quality Control for the cadets by ensuring the content of the entire training programme is relevant and suits the needs of today&#x27;s youth.
===Recognised Civilian Support Organizations===
====Association National Executives====

Three non-profit organisations, the Sea Cadet Corps Association of New Zealand Inc. (SCANZ), the Cadet Corps Association of New Zealand Trust (CCANZ), and the Air Training Corps Association of New Zealand Inc (ATCANZ) have been appointed by the Chief of the Defence Force to play an integral role in the Cadet Forces&#x27; management. They are responsible for developing policy in regards to training and NZDF involvement, national marketing, liaison with non-recognised organisations with Cadet Forces involvement, and additional logistical support. They also represent individual units and their support committees in the Standing Committee of the Cadet Advisory Council and via direct consultation from the Commandant Cadet Forces.

All associations have a National Executive to deal with the NZCF directly, while each unit is represented by an association branch.

SCANZ has the additional responsibilities of acquiring national resources and assets for SCC training use – as the Navy is unable to provide these facilities – and provide a disputes resolution process for SCC unit support committees.

====Returned Services Association====

The Royal New Zealand Returned Services Association (RNZRSA) supports NZCF involvement in its ceremonial and commemorative activities, encourages its members to join the support committees of individual cadet units, and provides additional support and resources.

Many RNZRSA members have formally served for branches of the Cadet Forces.

====Defence Employer Support Council (DESC)====

The Defence Employer Support Council is a civilian agency run by the New Zealand Government that works to facilitate good working relationships between NZDF Reservists, Cadet Force Officer&#x27;s, and their civilian employers. The Council liaises with the Minister of Defence on matters related to Reserves and also NZDF youth programmes (the NZCF and Limited Service Volunteers).

The focus of the DESC is for members to use their knowledge, networks and experience to:

# Engage with the employers of Reserve Force members and New Zealand Cadet Force officers;
# Open doors to civilian employment opportunities for members of the:
## Limited Service Volunteer programme;
## New Zealand Cadet Forces; and
## Regular Force members who are transitioning from the NZDF; and to
# Foster relationships with employers to identify potential NZDF opportunities where members with unique skills are needed by the NZDF

NZCF Officers of all branches are encouraged to reach out to DESC for support with their civilian employer if they feel they need it. Occasionally the DESC also facilitate the recruitment of new NZCF Officers from retiring Defence Force personnel who still want to contribute to New Zealand.

Each year the DESC hold an award ceremony to recognise and reward employers who ensure that Cadet Force Officers are able to not just meet their commitments, but provide the support needed for Officers to succeed and thrive. This can be by providing Officers with the leave they need to go on promotional course and attend unit activities, or by providing resources to help facilitate the operation of New Zealand Cadet Forces. Officers nominate their employer through the DESC website, and support the application with written testimony including examples of how their employer supports their position in the NZCF. 
====Cadet Unit Support Committees====

Each individual unit has a Cadet Unit Support Committee. Made up of voluntary members of the community, often parents and relatives of cadets, the committees assist units with fundraising and the supply of voluntary labour and resources when required.

==Rank Structure==
===Commissioned officers===
NZCF Active List

NZCF Active Service is defined under Cadet Force Order 1 (CFO 1). Every NZCF Officer appointed to the strength of an NZCF Cadet Unit, to HQ NZCF or a CFTSU will be held on the Active List and has the option of taking Cadet Unit Commander&#x27;s Leave or transferring either to the Non active List of that unit or to the NZCF Reserve or NZCF Standby Reserve as the regulations allow.

NZCF Non-Active List

The NZCF Non-Active List is for NZCF Officers who are unable to meet the requirements of efficient service for a period greater than three months and who do not wish to resign their NZCF commission. The maximum period an officer will be transferred to the Non-Active List is 12 months.
Note: Once an Officer Cadet passes the Commissioning Course, they are promoted to the rank of Acting Ensign (A/ENS), Acting Second lieutenant (A/2LT), or Acting Pilot officer (A/PLTOFF).

===Cadet ranks===

Note: Promotions are not purely based on meeting requirements, there are many factors that come into play such as how many Cadets are a part of the unit, do they need more higher ranking NCO&#x27;s/Cadets. However it is at the Unit Commanders Discretion to promote Cadets as they see fit.
=== Former ranks ===
=== Unit grading ===
Units are graded on their size, which dictates the number of Officers and Non-Commissioned Office each unit may possess. Units are able to deviate from the limitations of their grade, however must seek approval from the COMDT NZCF beforehand. Notably, the number of personnel used for the grading is based on the average attendance of weekly parade nights, as opposed to the total number of cadets enrolled at the unit. By 1 September each year, each Cadet Unit Commander is notified of their unit&#x27;s grade.
=== Under Officer Rank ===
Consultation for the potential removal of the rank began in 2018 with the area Warrant Officers (WONA, WOCA, WOSA) talking to Under Officers and Warrant Officer&#x27;s around the country to seek opinions regarding how Under Officers were utilised on a local level. Some NZCF Officers were also polled for an opinion. The result was that in 2019 HQ NZCF announced their intention to remove the under officer rank completely from service, to be replaced by the Officer Cadet rank. The Officer Cadet rank had traditionally been used for those attending a Commissioning Course to give personnel a shared rank and equalise personnel from the two different methods of commissioning (serving Under Officers and direct entry civilians). The rank of Officer Cadet is now given in its place to personnel intending to commission, regardless of if they previously served as a Non-commissioned Officer. This also gives direct entry candidates the opportunity to practice being in uniform and participate in unit parade nights before attending commissioning courses.

One of the more commonly used locations for the Under Officer course was the Royal New Zealand Police College, located in Porirua. This location presented the unique opportunity for NZCF students and staff to interact with the New Zealand Police and interact with their equipment. The last course held at the RNZPC was between 20 and 29 January 2017. The Last Under Officer Course was held at RNZAF Woodbourne between 6 and 15 July 2018.

As of April 2021 the last Under Officer graduated from the NZCF Officer Commissioning Course.

==Vision, Mission, Values and Aims==

The aim of drill:
* The aim of drill is to develop a cadet who is proud, alert, self-disciplined, obedient, and provides the basis of teamwork.

==Service eligibility==

=== Cadet Personnel ===
Any person between the ages of 13 and 15 years may join the NZCF. The full consent of parents or guardians is required to apply, and while under the age of 18 parental consent is required for all training and exercises undertaken. A person younger than 13 may join if presently attending Year 9 at a New Zealand Secondary School. Cadets can stay on without being promoted to the age of 18. Senior Non-Commissioned Officers may serve until their 20th birthday at which time they must commit to serving as a commissioned officer, Supplementary Staff, or leave the unit.

Other than black lace up shoes, all uniform is provided upon enrolment into a unit and completion of a training camp where wearing of the uniform is taught. Bonds are sometimes held to ensure that they are returned.

NZCF personnel are not subject to the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971, and hence cannot be deployed into active service.

==== Fees ====
Unit fees are set by each unit Parent Support Committee annually. Due to fluctuating operating costs, these vary from unit to unit dependent on the type of activities the unit has planned, although typically fees will be no more than $200 annually. Participating in unit exercises may incur extra charges, although any costs outside of government funding are often subsidised by sponsors.

=== Adult Personnel ===

==== Adult Cadets ====

In 2017 the New Zealand Cadet Forces updated their Child Protection policy surrounding cadets who are either Non-Commissioned Officers or personnel who are completing cadet level training that are aged 18 and over.

There is a deliberate delineation between an &#x27;Adult&#x27; and an &#x27;Officer&#x27; as the latter has specific authority to exercise command and control over cadets and other NZCF Officers.

The key difference between a cadet who is an adult and a cadet who is under 18 is that adult cadets and indeed all adults within the New Zealand Cadet Forces are charged with the responsibility of maintaining the safety and welfare of cadets during all NZCF activities. While this doesn&#x27;t mean that cadets who are classified as adults hold authority over other cadets due to their age, it means that adult cadets are expected to at the very least vocalize to an Officer or Supplementary Staff member when they believe safety and welfare have been compromised.

Cadet Non-Commissioned Officers who are 18 or older are issued a thin white band which is sewn into the rank slide of the individual immediately above the &quot;CADET FORCES&quot; lettering and below the rank emblem.

==== Officers and Supplementary Staff ====
Adult Members can serve in two capacities: Commissioned Officers or Supplementary Staff. Officers are commissioned into the New Zealand Cadet Forces, with the post-nominal letters NZCF, at the rank of Pilot Officer, and can be promoted to Flying Officer, and Flight Lieutenant after completing the necessary training and service. Cadet Force officers may serve to any age after receiving a commission.

In 2014 the organisation introduced a new position of National Support Officer (NSO). This position was designed to place a New Zealand Cadet Force Officer at high level of influence within HQNZCF, which traditionally had his position had been solely occupied by New Zealand Defence Force Personnel. In 2016 with the adoption of the continental staff system the position was renamed to &quot;Assistant Commandant.&quot; If he or she is an ATC officer, as opposed to an NZCC or SCC officer, they will hold the rank of Wing Commander.

Supplementary Staff or SS for short, are civilians who help train cadets. They do not wear uniform, but they are generally treated similarly to officers by cadets. Members of the NZDF are occasionally attached to cadet units to assist in conducting training. This is normally because they know a cadet/officer in that unit, or if they have a particular interest in cadet forces. They are addressed as &quot;Instructor&quot; or by cadets choice, &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;.

==== Fees ====
NZCF Officers do not typically pay any membership fees for belonging to a Unit or Training Ship, this is typically to balance the time and effort put in by NZCF Officers. While Officers aren&#x27;t encouraged to, a large amount contribute anyway, by way of purchasing stationary and equipment for their unit.

== Courses ==
Each year the New Zealand Cadet Forces holds numerous courses designed to train and maintain the skills of all its personnel. Twice per year (Mid and late year) Headquarters, NZCF promulgates the NZCF &quot;Annual Training Programme&quot; or &#x27;ATP&#x27;, which represents the &quot;Authorised Activities&quot; that are undertaken by the NZCF. &quot;Authorised Activities&quot; are those which are at least partially funded by the New Zealand Defence Force and the support organisations for each branch (SCANZ/CCANZ/ATCANZ). Any other activity undertaken such as unit camps are &quot;Recognised Activities&quot; and receive no formal funding from the NZDF and are not included on the ATP.

Each course is staffed by a mix of Defence and Cadet Force personnel, with the bulk of staff being Cadet Forces Officers with Defence staff often performing logistics and support roles such as administrators. However, more enthusiastic personnel are often actively involved in the courses and provide an opportunity for cadets to ask questions regarding recruitment into the New Zealand Defence Force.

Tri-Corps promotional courses are held in each area up to three times per year (each school holidays excluding Christmas holidays) depending on requirements, with courses occasionally being removed if there aren&#x27;t enough applicants. Conversely, if a course in one area is removed then students from that area may be transported to and from another area (whichever has space on a course) for the student to undertake the course.

=== NZCF Courses ===

==== Tri Corps Courses ====
Tri Corps Courses are available to everybody in the New Zealand Cadet Forces regardless of which branch they&#x27;re in.

*Personnel are required to undergo further training before being eligible to act in a staff role. This will always be passing the course as a student first.

==== Sea Cadet Corps Courses ====
These courses and exercises are normally restricted to cadets in the Sea Cadet Corps. However, occasionally Officers from other branches will attend either as staff members or in order to cross train their skills. Officers that are stationed at multi-Corps Unit headquarters, such as TS Amokura (Wellington) which also has No. 1 (City of Wellington) Squadron, and Wellington City Cadet Unit parade from the same facility.
====New Zealand Cadet Corps====
These courses and exercises are normally restricted to cadets in the New Zealand Cadet Corps. However, occasionally Officers from other branches will attend as staff members to help facilitate the activities.
====Air Training Corps====
These courses and exercises are normally restricted to cadets in the Air Training Corps. However, occasionally Officers from other branches will attend either as staff members or in order to cross train their skills. Officers that are stationed at multi-Corps Unit headquarters, such as TS Amokura (Wellington) which also has No. 1 (City of Wellington) Squadron, and Wellington City Cadet Unit parade from the same facility.

A recent addition to the list of courses on offer is an Officer Gliding Course, aiming to give New Zealand Cadet Force Officers, whose courses are normally paperwork based, the opportunity to have similar experiences to Cadets. A relatively small course in relation to the larger National Gliding Course, this course has proved extremely popular with ATC Officers.
=== Staffing Courses ===

==== Officers ====
All Commissioned Officers of the NZCF are eligible to staff both the JNCO and SNCO course by virtue of being commissioned. However precedence is given to Officers that have successfully completed the Instructional Technique and Training Management Course.

For promotional course there are several roles that an Officer can perform as a course staff member. Some Officers will be assigned multiple roles depending on their skill level and experience. The roles available to an Officer include, but are not limited to;

* Syndicate Leader – This will be the first position assigned to an Officer when they begin staffing courses. Directly responsible for a group of Cadets and their progress over the course. The Syndicate Leader will assess the students based on their performance and behaviour on the course. These personnel also provide the majority of the Duty of Care and &quot;in loco parentis&quot; on the course.
* Adjutant – Responsible for the administration and personnel of the course. This person will ensure all personnel attending receive their JI&#x27;s (Joining Instructions) and will collate the nominal roll. Typically assigned to an Officer who has staffed courses previously and volunteers for the position. The individual holding this position will often double as a Syndicate Leader.
* Training Officer – Responsible for the creation and maintenance of the training programme for the course as well as ensuring lesson plans and instructors are adequate for the course. Typically assigned to an Officer who has staffed courses previously and volunteers for the position. The individual holding this position will often double as a Syndicate Leader.
* Course Director – The senior most Cadet Force Officer on the course. Ultimately responsible to the Area Office (CFTSU) for the successful running of the course. This position will only be given to an Officer that is trusted by the Area Coordinator or Senior Area Advisor and will almost always be CAPT/FLTLT/LT in rank and have staffed numerous courses previously. While on a course, if a student fails a terminal objective on the course (possibly resulting in them not passing the course) the Course Director will oversee the retraining and eventual retest of the student. This will normally be the only role that does not double as a Syndicate Leader.

==== Cadets ====
Cadets who graduate from the Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Course are eligible to go back and staff the JNCO course, the SNCO course, and the Cadet Fieldcraft Experience. These NCOs can staff in two capacities, depending on the course.

* Cadet Staff member – On promotional courses Cadet NCOs act as mentors and guides for junior cadets, displaying the behaviour and attitudes expected. Cadets are assigned in Platoon Sergeant/Division Lead/Flight Sergeant roles.
** Course Warrant Officer/Sergeant Major/Course Coxswain – A sub position for NCO Staff. This is the senior Cadet on the course, responsible for the rest of the Cadet Staff and the drill on course.
* Fatigue – Commonly referred to as &quot;slushies&quot;, on promotional courses 2–4 Cadet NCOs are employed to help out in the kitchen and with logistics on the course such as setting up activity stands. These personnel won&#x27;t typically interact with students in an educational capacity.

All Cadet Forces personnel that staff courses, regardless of rank and position are entitled to be paid for their work on course.

== Competitions ==

=== Shooting Competitions and Trophies ===

The David Culverwell Memorial Trophy for Top NZCF Shot

In 2004 Cadet Forces was approached, through Flight Lieutenant Bruce Sinclair, regarding the donation of a .22 competition rifle for use as a trophy by Mr Denis Culverwell. He wanted to donate the weapon as a trophy in memory of his son David who was tragically killed in a traffic accident. David was a very keen competition shot and his parents wanted to continue in this vein with the trophy. Northern Area had the trophy mounted and engraved and Headquarters verified it as being the trophy for the &#x27;Top Shot&#x27; within Cadet Forces. The trophy is to be awarded annually to the highest scoring Cadet based on the annual .22 calibre shooting competition (Smit, Gunford or Wallingford). If two or more cadets have the same final score (regardless of unit) the COMDT has agreed to fund a shoot off. Using the same rules and conditions as the National shooting competitions the highest possible score (HPS) is 100.

Lady Islington Challenge Cup

Awarded to the NZCF team that attains the highest aggregate score in the annual .22 calibre shooting competition (Smit, Gunford or Wallingford).

Canterbury Defence Victory Trophy

==Medals and Awards==
Cadet of the Year Award

Inaugurated in 2016, the Cadet of the Year Award (COTY) is an annual panel judged award received by one cadet who most exemplifies the NZCF values of Courage, Commitment, Comradeship and Integrity, during a calendar year. To be selected for judging by the panel a person must be nominated by another member of the NZCF, who must complete an NZCF 104 – COTY Nomination Form. Potential recipients must have demonstrated each of the values throughout the year and be recommended by their Cadet Unit Commander, who must complete submit a comment with the NZCF 104 form as to why the cadet deserves the award. Any cadet (CDTWO1(E) and below) can be nominated for the Cadet of the Year Award.

Initially a two-day competition held each October or September in each year, this version of the award was short lived due to the cost and lack of ability to travel for some personnel. With the active competition version of the award only occurring between 2016 – 2018.

The recipient is invited to the New Zealand Defence Force Person of the Year Awards to receive the award.
Cadet Force Medal Commissioned Officers are awarded the Cadet Forces Medal (CFM) after 12 years of continuous service from the age of 18 and choosing to become an Officer Cadet.

After each further eight years of continuous service, a clasp to the Cadet Forces Medal is awarded.

Personnel who receive this award typically hold the rank of Captain(E) due to the time in service required for the medal. However, it&#x27;s possible for Officers holding junior ranks such as Second Lieutenant (Equivalent) to be awarded this medal.

Commandant&#x27;s Commendation The &#x27;COMDT NZCF Commendation&#x27; is available to NZCF personnel and Cadet Units whose contributions to the NZCF deserve formal recognition, but which may not meet the criteria for honours and awards from the Sovereign, or Chief of Defence Force/Service Chief/NZDF Commendations.

A Commandant&#x27;s Commendation may be awarded to a member of the New Zealand Cadet Force for an act of gallantry, bravery or specific courage that, in the opinion of the Commandant, is worthy of recognition but does not merit a higher award. Alternatively the Commendation may be awarded for a singular accomplishment or extraordinary performance of duty over time.

Commandant&#x27;s Coin Acting as an official &#x27;challenge coin&#x27; of the New Zealand Cadet Forces. The Commandant&#x27;s Coin is open to all individuals involved and associated with the New Zealand Cadet Forces. While not an award the coin is personal recognition to those who have provided valuable service to the NZCF; the service being above that normally expected. Recipients are at the discretion of the commandant.

New Year/Birthday Honours

While New Zealand Cadet Force members are not eligible for awards in the Military List of New Year or Birthday Honours. They are, however, eligible for awards in the Civil list
New Zealand Defence Force Chiefs Commendations

The New Zealand Chief of the Defence Force and single service Chiefs (Army/Navy/Air Force) make available Defence Commendation awards to New Zealand Cadet Forces personnel and units similarly to the Commandants Commendations.
== New Zealand Cadet Forces Haka ==
&quot;i Ngā Toa Pōtiki o Aotearoa&quot; – the official Māori translation of The NZ Cadet Forces and the name of the New Zealand Cadet Forces Haka. In days gone past the term ‘Toa Pōtiki’ was used for the youngest warriors, those who were undergoing training. Toa muri was another term used to describe young warriors undergoing training.

==Government Funding and Pay ==
The Cadet Forces is partially funded through the Miscellaneous Support Activities (M22) appropriation in Vote Defence Force. This covers provision of the Defence infrastructure and planned support to regional defence forces and the New Zealand community. It includes the Mutual Assistance Programme, New Zealand Cadet Forces, Service Museums and assisting with the training of Limited Service Volunteers.

Pay

Excluding any Regular Force personnel, all service is voluntary and unpaid apart from commissioned officers and Cadet NCOs who are paid by the NZDF for staffing nationally organised (authorised) courses.

For Cadet Non-commissioned Officers and Second Lieutenant(E) this is flat rate equivalent to the New Zealand Minimum Wage at the time of the course multiplied by eight hours a day (a standard working day) for the length of the course. For Cadet NCOs this payrate is irrespective of rank, a Sergeant acting as a staff member will make the same as a Warrant Officer.

Commissioned Officers however are entitled to amounts commensurate with their ranks. Senior Cadet Force Officers such, Major(E) are entitled to a higher rate of approximately $340 per day for the length of the course (not including travel days).

Staff members are also entitled to monetary compensation in the form of reimbursement for travel expenses to and from courses, however advantage is of the special relationships the New Zealand Defence has with national carriers, notably Air New Zealand, both aviation and bus transport is utilised for personnel movements when feasible. The New Zealand Defence Force also offer transport using RNZAF aircraft as long as it does not affect operational requirements.

In June 2021 the New Zealand Chief of Defence Force approved an &#x27;annual gratuity payment&#x27; to Commissioned New Zealand Cadet Force Officers. Officers who logged enough hours in 2020 received a &quot;good faith&quot; payment from the New Zealand Defence Force. And moving forward from 2021 a criterion has been set for each NZCF Officer that will need to be met annually in order for the payment to be made;

* Must be a Commissioned Officer of the New Zealand Cadet Forces
* Not under probation or suspension
* Accumulate 20 days minimum NZCF service each calendar year
* Must have a completed an annular PDR (Performance Development Review)
* The rate is paid at the rank held for the majority of the year.

==Legal Standing==
The New Zealand Cadet Forces (NZCF) are established and maintained under Part 6, Section 74 of the Defence Act 1990. This legally empowers the Minister of Defence to raise and maintain cadet forces: the Sea Cadet Corps (SCC), the New Zealand Cadet Corps (NZCC), and the Air Training Corps (ATC).

Sub section 1A of Part 6, Section 74, of the Defence Act 1990 delegates and empowers the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) to maintain the NZCF. The NZCF is not, however, a component of the New Zealand Defence Force. Aspects of the CDF delegation are then sub-delegated to the Commandant NZCF who is responsible for the strategic direction and operational functioning of the organisation.

== Controversies ==
Temporary Order No. 3 Controversy

In November 2011 Temporary Order no. 3 (Temporary orders are numbered as they are released annually, i.e. Temporary order 3 was the third released in 2011) was released by HQNZCF detailing sweeping changes in the eligibility of cadets and to what age they were able to serve until. The Temporary order, which was eventually scribed into the NZCF Policy and Administration Manual (PAM), restricted all cadets over the age 18 from serving unless they were promoted to the rank of Under Officer (disestablished and replaced by Officer Cadet). This was highly controversial for members of the organisation and resulted in many Senior Non-Commissioned Officers leaving the organisation, creating a power vacuum that resulted in junior cadets being thrust into higher ranks without the necessary experience and training. There is speculation as to exactly what prompted the creation of this Temporary Order, however there has not been a public statement given that confirms any theory. In the aftermath a NZCF Officer was asked to formally resign for breach of the Code of Conduct of the New Zealand Cadet Forces, which states that no member of the organisation may bring it in to disrepute.

Adventurous Training

In July 2010 HQ NZCF issued a memo that clarified to Cadet Unit Commanders and NZCF Officers that &quot;Adventurous Activities&quot; were overwhelmingly not permitted by NZCF personnel and activities paintball, skydiving, and paragliding were explicitly restricted. This persisted until November 2016 when Temporary Order T2/2016 was released once again allowing NZCF units to oragnise and participate in the aforementioned activities provided the appropriate planning was completed and approved by Area Offices (Cadet Force Training and Support Units). Resultingly activities such as paintball and skydiving are recognised activities within the boundaries of the New Zealand Cadet Forces.

=== Gliding Incidents ===
December 1997

On 9 December 1997 a fatal incident occurred on a Cadet Gliding Course that resulted in the deaths of a 16 year old from Upper Hutt and an English born doctor that moved to the local area from Canada in 1994. At 4:12pm the glider entered into a stall, before nose diving towards the ground, disintegrating in the process. Cadets on the course were witness to the event.

January 2009

On 31 January 2009 an incident at Central Hawkes Bay Aeroclub, located in Waipukurau, occurred that resulted in minor injuries for a cadet and an instructor. The glider made an unexpectedly low approach and when the instructor made evasive maneuvers the right wing of the glider has struck a power line resulting in a crash. Both the cadet and instructor survived with no serious injuries, with the cadet continuing on to complete the camp.

April 2009

On 30 April 2009 a second gliding related incident occurred on the National Gliding Course. Minutes after takeoff a glider carrying a 14 year old cadet from Christchurch and a 77 year old instructor from Taupō, suffered an event which resulted in the glider aircraft crashing into the ground. The instructor in the back suffered from moderate back injuries and had both ankles broken, the cadet however, was taken by rescue helicopter to Waikato Hospital in critical but stable condition. The cadet suffered from a spinal injury and was required to use a wheel chair and walking frame for some time. By June 2019 the cadet was back parading with his unit in Christchurch.

=== Firearms Incidents ===
Theft of Cadet Rifles

In July 2015 Taupo Cadet Unit was burgled, resulting in the loss of 6 Marlin XT rifles and 4 drill purpose Norinco JW-15a rifles.

Negligent Discharge

On 17 September 2020 an incident occurred that resulted in the discharge of a personal firearm at a cadet training facility. The incident occurred on the grounds of Timaru Christian School, however the facility involved was not part of the school. The incident was during firearms training, with the instructor involved bringing in eight personal firearms to demonstrate to cadets the evolution of firearms. The incident was investigated by the New Zealand Police and the HQ NZCF. The instructor received a warning from the NZ Police.

<text>Summerston is a residential area of Glasgow, Scotland. With most of the housing constructed in the 1970s, it is situated in the far north of the city and is considered to be part of the larger Maryhill district, but has a different postcode; other nearby neighbourhoods are Gilshochill to the south and Cadder to the south-east. With open farmland to the north-east, Summerston is separated from the southern parts of the town of Bearsden to the north-west by the River Kelvin and a golf course.

==Amenities== 
Summerston has a riding school run by UK charity Riding for the Disabled. The area is also home to St Blane&#x27;s Primary and John Paul Academy.

The 4th Glasgow Scout Beaver Colony and Cub Scout Pack are based in Caldercuilt Primary School at 101 Invershiel Road. It is also home to Summerston Childcare which is the most popular Family Learning and Out of School centre in Summerston having had a waiting list for their classes since their opening in 1995. Maryhill Harriers running club meet at John Paul Academy as well as various other clubs together with a range of fitness class in the evening at the school. Summerston has several large shops, including an ASDA, also a chemist. There was previously a B&amp;M Bargain, Poundstretchers store and a flooring shop they have subsequently been removed and building remodelled to make way for new shops rumoured to be a Iceland and a home bargains.

As of July 2021 the current shops are opened: Asda, Home Bargains, Gregg’s, Iceland.

There is an entrance to Maryhill Park from Summerston which contains tennis courts, a children&#x27;s play area and walking paths.

The residential streets are mostly named after locations in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, including obscure places such as Gorstan, Carbost, Tolsta, Ardessie, Loch Mullardoch and Milovaig.

==History==

The current Summerston railway station is about south of the original one which was on the Kelvin Valley Railway. The original station was north and west of the River Kelvin, close to the Summerston Farm and Cottages and the site of a fortlet on the Antonine Wall. The fortlet was discovered from aerial observation in 1980. A temporary marching camp, south of the Kelvin, was found in 1978 also from the air. A sandstone distance slab was found at Summerston Farm before 1694. A video of scans taken from the stone has been produced.

The slab, reminiscent of The Bridgeness Slab, was made by the Second Legion and depicts a helmeted horseman and naked captives. It is now in the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. The slab was probably originally painted with bright pigments. The colours were found using X-ray and laser technology. The gory slabs showed natives with bright red blood on their faces, bodies and legs. The neighbouring forts to this forlet were at Bearsden to the west and at Balmuildy to the east.

Another Summerston slab can be compared with one found near Castlehill. Both these similar slabs, like two others from Duntocher have two decorative pelta shields, one on either side of the slab. The horns of each shield are embellished with three rosettes on the Castlehill slab whereas the Summerton slab has these end in two griffins&#x27; heads.

The first, badly weathered, slab has four rosettes between the shields and the inscription. It was found in 1803 on Low Millochan farm. The farm, later called East Millichen, is near Summerston. It was built into a dovecot and records the building of 3666.5 paces of wall by the Sixth Legion. MacDonald describes the work as coarse and relates that some of the abbreviations are unusual. He suggests that it stood side-by-side with what he calls no. 6 (RIB 2193) at Summerston. On the similar Castlehill slab (RIB 2196) he suggests the stone-cutter has blundered and made a letter P where he should have a letter F (for Fidelis) on the fourth line. The Castlehill slab also records 3666.5 paces although the units used are a matter of ongoing research.

There is some evidence of a Roman bridge over the Kelvin between Summerston and Balmuildy. Summerston was part of the parish of Strathblane. Ironstone and coal were historically mined in the area.

<doc id="1067439" wikidata="Q284920" url="?curid=1067439" title="Sardar">
<text>Sardar, also spelled as Sardaar (, , &#x27;commander&#x27;, literally &#x27;headmaster&#x27;), is a title of royalty and nobility that was originally used to denote princes, noblemen, chiefs, kings and other aristocrats. It has also been used to denote a chief or leader of a tribe or group. It is used as a Persian synonym of the title &quot;Emir&quot; of Arabic origin.

The term and its cognates originate from Persian &quot;sardār&quot; () and have been historically used across Persia (Iran), the Ottoman Empire and Turkey (as &quot;Serdar&quot;), Afghanistan (as &quot;Sardar&quot; for a member of the royal Mohammadzai clan in meaning of noblemen), Mesopotamia (now Iraq), Syria, South Asia (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal), Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Balkans and Egypt (as &quot;Sirdar&quot;).

Amongst Sikhs, the term began to be adopted due to Afghan influence in the mid-18th century to signify a leader of a Jatha or Misl and gradually replaced other prior used terms for these positions, such as &#x27;Jathedar&#x27; and &#x27;Misldar&#x27;. The term &quot;sardar&quot; was used by Sikh leaders and generals who held important positions in various Sikh Misls. The title is still commonly used by Sikhs today. Though historically signifying one&#x27;s military rank or membership of a locally important family, in the contemporary period the title is used widely in India and neighbouring countries for any respected Sikh male. &quot;Sardar&quot; was also used to refer to generals of the Maratha Empire. After the decline of feudalism, &quot;sardar&quot; later indicated a Head of State, a Commander-in-chief, and an army military rank. As a military rank, a &quot;sardar&quot; typically marked the Commander-in-Chief or the highest-ranking military officer in an army, akin to the modern Field Marshal, General of the Army or Chief of Army. The more administrative title &quot;Sirdar-Bahadur&quot; denoted a Governor-General or Chief Minister of a remote province, akin to a British Viceroy.

In Himalayan mountaineering, a &quot;sirdar&quot; is a local leader of the Sherpas. Among other duties, he records the heights reached by each Sherpa, which factors into their compensation.

==Princes==

*The Kapurthala State, have been ruled by kings of state styled &quot;Sardar&quot;. For example, the king of Kapurthala used the title of Sardar.

==Examples of regional use==
* In Balochistan, the title &quot;Sardar&quot; marked the chief of his tribe.
* In the Royal Afghan Kingdom, the original &quot;Nishan-i-Sardari&quot; (Order of the Leader), founded by King Amanullah in 1923, was bestowed for exceptional service to the Crown by the Afghan monarch. Recipients enjoyed the titles of &quot;Sardar-i-Ala&quot; or &quot;Sardar-i-Ali&quot; before their names and also received grants of land. The original Order was disbanded in 1929, and was later revived by King Muhammad Zahir Shah.
* In Ottoman Turkey, Serdar was a rank in Bosnia Eyalet with Herzegovina Eyalet, later Bosnia Vilayet, encompassing entire Bosnia and Herzegovina, and parts of Montenegro and Serbia, as well as in other parts Ottoman Montenegro, Serbia, and other lands. Serdar was also used in the Principality of Montenegro and the Principality of Serbia as an honorary &quot;title&quot; below that of Vojvoda. For example, Janko Vukotić who was a military leader and former prime minister of Montenegro with title of &quot;Serdar&quot;. However, these were not noble titles as there was no nobility in Serbia and Montenegro and no hereditary titles apart from those borne by members of the reigning families of both countries.
* In Persia, &quot;Sardar-i-Bozorg&quot; was the title of both Hossein Khan Sardar and his brother Hasan Khan Qajar. Both were uncles of Agha Khan Qajar, the King-Emperor of Persia and the Commander-in-chief under Emperor Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar in the Russo-Persian Wars of 1804 and 1826.
*In Punjab, village chiefs, military commanders, and noble personalities were referred to as Sardars. The title is commonly used by both Muslims and Sikhs.
* The early feudal Maratha Empire prior to Peshwa administration (1674–1749) used the title &quot;Sardar&quot; to identify an imperial court minister with military and diplomatic functions. If granted land (&quot;jagir&quot;), the title &quot;Sardar&quot; also marked a feudal superior responsible for administration, defense and taxing of the granted territory (equivalent to the European title Count, from the French &quot;comte&quot; meaning the &quot;companion&quot; or delegate to the Emperor that administered a county). These &quot;Sardars&quot; of the early Maratha Empire were life peers; the title was not hereditary.
* If the &quot;Sardar&quot; was appointed to Commander-in-Chief of all Maratha forces, the style &quot;Senapati&quot; was used in combination (e.g., &quot;Sardar Senapati&quot; or &quot;Sarsenapati&quot; Khanderao Yesajirao Dabhade. The title Senapati is a primogeniture hereditary title, as is evidenced by the current &quot;Senapati&quot; Shrimant Sardar Padmasenraje Dabhade of Talegaon Dabhade.
* In the Maratha Empire, the more administrative role of &quot;Sirdar-Bahadur&quot; denoted a Governor General or Chief Minister of a remote province; this best equates to a Mughal &quot;Subahdar&quot; or British Viceroy in function and rank.
* The title &quot;Sirdar&quot; was used by Englishmen to describe native noblemen in British India (e.g., &quot;Sirdars&quot; of the Deccan).

==Aristocrats==
* In the Hazara Division of Pakistan, the word &quot;Sardar&quot; is used by the Karlal tribe, traditionally, to stress their upper-caste status.
*In the districts of Poonch and Sudhanoti, Kashmir, &quot;Sardar&quot; is used by the hybrid Sudhan tribe and Douli tribe. Also, other tribal families in Poonch use &quot;Sardar&quot; at the beginning of their names.
* Similarly &quot;Sardar&quot; is used by Khattar tribe noble men, native to the districts of Attock and adjacent areas of Rawalpindi. 
*&quot;Sardar&quot; was used for important political, tribal, military and religious officers rankings by the Sikhs during the period of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

==Head of state==
* In Persian, &quot;Sardar i-Azam&quot; was occasionally used as an alternative title for the Shahanshah&#x27;s Head of government, normally styled &quot;Vazir i-Azam&quot;, notably in 1904-06 for a Qajar prince, Prince Major General Abdol Majid Mirza.
* Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Deputy Prime Minister of India was referred to as Sardar Patel; he is also now known as the &quot;Iron Man of India&quot;.
* &quot;Sadr-e-Riyasat&quot; was the title of one Constitutional Head of State of the princely state of Kashmir, Yuvaraj Shri Karan Singhji Bahadur, who was appointed as Heir Apparent in 1931. After his father had acceded to India, ending the sovereign Monarchy, Regent in 1949 to 1956. &quot;Sardar-i-Riyasat&quot; 1956 to 1965 (succeeded on the death of his father as Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1961, no longer carrying any hereditary power), next Governor of the Indian constitutive State of Jammu and Kashmir 1965 to 1967.
*Mohammad Daoud Khan of Afghanistan had the title of &quot;Sardar&quot; as president.
* Saparmurat Niyazov, the authoritarian ruler of Turkmenistan in 1990–2006, carried a few glorifying titles, one of which was &quot;Serdar&quot; (“Leader”).
*Sardar Sulakhan Singh Puar of Sikh Empire had the title of Sardar. Among Sikhs, Sardar is the title used by Sikh nobles, Military leaders &amp; village chiefs.

* &quot;Sirdar&quot; was the official title of the British Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-Egyptian army.
* The title &quot;Serdar&quot; is also common amongst Ottomans in referring to a Commander-in-Chief. The Serbs adopted this usage from the Ottomans (e.g. Serdar Janko Vukotić).

* In Iran, &quot;Sardar&quot; is used to address Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps high-ranking officers. (see List of senior officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards)
*During the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the term Sardar became even more common as a title given to Sikh men. Although it was officially reserved to address a high-ranking official or a commanding chief such as a general or officer.

==Modern usage==
* The term &quot;Sardar&quot; is today used to refer to adult male followers of the religion of Sikhism, as a disproportionate number of Sikhs have honorably served in many high-ranking positions within the Indian Army. Notable examples include Generals Joginder Jaswant Singh and Harbaksh Singh.
*In Himalayan mountaineering, a &quot;Sirdar&quot; is the local leader of the Sherpas and porters. Among other duties, he records the heights reached by individual Sherpas, which dictates the amounts the Sherpas will be paid.

<text>Rocco Buttiglione (; born 6 June 1948) is an Italian Union of Christian and Centre Democrats politician and an academic. Buttiglione&#x27;s nomination for a post as European Commissioner with a portfolio that was to include civil liberties, resulted in controversy as some political groups opposed him for his conservative Catholic views on homosexuality, despite his assurances that these were only his personal convictions and would not dictate his administration.

Buttiglione is a Professor of political science at Saint Pius V University in Rome, and member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. He served as a minister for EU policies (from 2001 to 2005) and then as Minister for Cultural Assets and Activities (from 2005 to 2006) in Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s governments. In 2005 Buttiglione received an honorary doctoral degree from Guatemalan Francisco Marroquín University for his commitment to the ideas of liberty.

In May 2006, he unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Turin.

==Early career==

Rocco Buttiglione was born in Gallipoli, Apulia, on the &quot;heel&quot; of Italy.

He studied law in Turin and Rome and became a Professor of political science at Saint Pius V University in Rome. He was also a professor of philosophy and acting rector at the International Academy for Philosophy in Liechtenstein.

Rocco Buttiglione first attained attention on the Italian political stage when in 1994 he became secretary of the Italian People&#x27;s Party, the largest of the parties that emerged from the collapse of Christian Democracy, formerly the largest party in Italy since the Second World War, after the Tangentopoli corruption scandals. The People&#x27;s Party had presented itself along with &quot;Patto Segni&quot; in the centrist alliance Pact for Italy, in which it came third after Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s centre-right Pole of Freedoms/Pole of Good Government and the centre-left Alliance of Progressives.

Buttiglione eventually joined forces with Berlusconi and the Northern League, led by Umberto Bossi, to win the 2001 election. Buttiglione was elected a Parliamentary Deputy for Milan in May 2001, and joined Berlusconi&#x27;s new government as the European Union Policy Minister. From 2005-06 Buttiglione was Minister for Cultural Assets and Activities.

==Nominee for the European Commission==

===Background to the nomination===
Following an increase of popular support for his socially conservative Catholic political party, the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), at a time of political difficulty for Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s government, the UDC leader, Marco Follini, asked for more influence in the government. At this point the UDC was lobbying against the powerful Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti, supported by Umberto Bossi&#x27;s Northern League; Subsequently, Tremonti was ousted from office and replaced with the politically more neutral Domenico Siniscalco.

The new balance of power inside the ruling coalition effectively entitled the UDC to ask for even more and it was therefore decided that Rocco Buttiglione, already a minister in the government, would become Italy&#x27;s member of the European Commission. As a result, his place in the Italian government was granted to another member of the UDC.

Rocco Buttiglione&#x27;s apparent qualifications included speaking foreign languages, including English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Polish.

In 2004, José Manuel Barroso included him on his list of nominees for the European Commission, with a designated portfolio of Justice, Freedom and Security.

===Controversy===

The nomination resulted in controversy. During his hearing before the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice And Home Affairs, Buttiglione - a Catholic - was asked about his stance on homosexuality and women. Buttiglione responded that while he considered homosexuality a sin, his personal opinion would not prevent him from moving against discrimination of homosexuals. He also stated his belief that the family &quot;exists in order to allow women to have children and to have the protection of a male who takes care of them&quot;.

The PES, ALDE and Green/EFA groups expressed reservations regarding Buttiglione&#x27;s ability to take positive political action in the area of civil rights, particularly in regards combating discrimination, and threatened to reject the entire proposed Commission. On 11 October the committee voted by 27-26 not to endorse the nomination. After it became clear that a vote on 27 October in the European Parliament, to approve the Commission, would not succeed, José Manuel Barroso withdrew his proposed Commission.

Italian conservative and Catholic politicians and church leaders rallied to defend Buttiglione&#x27;s views. &quot;This decision shows the real face of Europe, a face which we don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s fundamentalist, which is absolutely not on&quot;, said Justice Minister Roberto Castelli.

On 21 October José Manuel Barroso attempted to defuse the row by indicating that civil liberties, human rights and discrimination issues would be handled by a special panel that would include Buttiglione but that Barroso himself would chair it. &quot;The new Commission will be absolutely opposed to any kind of discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender, or religious beliefs&quot;, he stated.

On 30 October Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s government withdrew Buttiglione&#x27;s nomination, keeping him in his office of minister in the Italian government. &quot;The new soft totalitarianism that is advancing on the left wants to have a state religion. It is an atheist, nihilistic religion - but it is a religion that is obligatory for all&quot;, Buttiglione subsequently commented.

Foreign minister Franco Frattini was later indicated as a possible alternative, with the implicit promise that his ministry would then go to Gianfranco Fini, whose party had recently increased its influence in the government coalition. However, there were still rumors that Giulio Tremonti, supported by the Northern League, might be picked for the job, but eventually Frattini was nominated and appointed.

In response to the veto of Buttiglione&#x27;s candidature, a collection of Christian personalities in 2008 (with Buttiglione himself as Founding Patron) formed the Dignitatis Humanae Institute to oversee the creation of a network of parliamentary working groups on human dignity across a diverse number of legislatures, with the aim of protecting the integrity of Christians serving in public life.

==Turin mayoral election==
Rocco Buttiglione ran as the candidate for his coalition, the House of Freedoms, for the office of Mayor in Turin. His opponent was the incumbent Sergio Chiamparino, member of The Union. Turin had been a left-wing stronghold in the previous general elections and the city hosted successfully the 2006 Winter Olympics, making Buttiglione&#x27;s challenge very difficult. Adding to that, some wondered why such a hard-line conservative, who had never lived in Turin before, was proposed for the office, calling Buttiglione&#x27;s move as a political suicide. After a poor campaign results were disastrous; Sergio Chiamparino, who had been elected in the previous elections with 52.8% of the votes, scored 66.6% of the votes against Buttiglione, and became the first Turin mayor to be elected at the first turn.

==Financial investigations==

It has also emerged that Buttiglione was investigated by the authorities in Monaco in 2002 over possible illegal money laundering in favour of his political party. At the end no evidence was found that a crime had been committed. Giampiero Catone, a senior aide of Buttiglione, has been charged with &quot;fraudulent bankruptcy&quot; in Italy; and faces inquiries into the disappearance of millions of Euros of Italian and EU funds.

==Views on abortion==
In an interview with &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, Italy&#x27;s leading daily newspaper, Buttiglione was quoted as saying that he is opposed to efforts to create binding legal protections for the unborn in Italy. He later told the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute that he had been misquoted and clarified that he meant it was unlikely that Italy would ban abortion given its political situation. He also stated that anti-abortion advocates should focus on reducing the demand for abortions by providing alternatives to mothers.

<text>An anklet, also called &quot;ankle chain&quot;, &quot;ankle bracelet&quot; or &quot;ankle string&quot;, is an ornament worn around the ankle. Barefoot anklets and toe rings historically have been worn for at least over 8,000 years by girls and women in Indus Valley, in Indian Subcontinent where it is commonly known as &quot;pattilu&quot;, &quot;payal, golusu&quot; and sometimes as &quot;nupur&quot;. They have also been worn by Egyptian women since predynastic times. In the United States both casual and more formal anklets became fashionable from the 1930s to the late–20th century. While in Western popular culture both younger men and women may wear casual leather anklets, they are popular among barefoot women. Formal anklets (of silver, gold, or beads) are used by some women as fashion jewellery. Anklets are an important piece of jewellery in Indian marriages, worn along with saris.

Occasionally, anklets on both ankles are joined by a chain to limit the step. This practice was once prevalent in Southeast Asia, where the effect was to give a &quot;feminine&quot; short tripping step. Today, a few Western women follow this practice, but rarely in public. More rarely still, some people wear &quot;permanent&quot; (e.g., soldered) ankle chains and even connecting chains.

== History ==
===Egypt===
Anklets were worn as an everyday ornament by Egyptian women of all social classes in ancient Egypt from as early as predynastic times. The name for anklets was not much different from that of bracelets being &quot;menefret&quot; (&quot;mnfrt&quot;) except by adding a phrase to denote connection to the feet. They were made of different metals and in multiple shapes, with more expensive metals like gold being more common among the rich, while less expensive ones like silver and iron more common among lower social classes. During the fourth, fifth, and sixth dynasties, anklets were usually made of beads threaded in several rows held together with spacer-bars. Anklets were also worn by dancers like those shown in the tombs of Kagemni, Ti, and Akh-hotp.

In the early–20th century, anklets were commonly worn by Egyptian women of inner cities. They were called &quot;kholkhal&quot; (pl. &quot;khalakheel&quot;) and were most commonly worn by women of Alexandria, along with a traditional dress covered by a one-piece black cloth called &quot;melaya leff&quot;.

Today, anklets are not commonly worn by Egyptian women in public due to increased Islamic conservatism that has spread in Egypt where wearing anklets in public is generally perceived as being immodest. Anklets are still commonly worn by dancers in public events.

===Europe===
Bronze anklets are visible as early as the Bronze Age in temperate Europe, in an area roughly along the Danube, in the Alpine foreland, up the Rhine to the Atlantic, and also down the Rhône (Sherratt, 2001). These were found among hoards in these areas, along with other bronze items characteristic of this time (c. 1800 BCE onwards), and are attributable to the Tumulus culture that spread across this region.

Periscelis (), was an anklet worn by ancient Greek and Roman women. The plebeian women wore anklets of silver, whereas the patricians of gold.

=== South Asia ===
Neolithic and chalcolithic periods at Mehrgarh indicate use of anklets. Jhon Marshall describes dancing girl statue as being adorned with armlets, bangles, and anklets A first-century CE epic of Tamil literature called &quot;Silappatikaram&quot; (&quot;The Story of the Anklet&quot;) dealt with a woman whose husband was killed while trying to sell one of her ruby anklets to a dishonest goldsmith. The anklets are described in great detail in the poem.

Rajasthani women wear the heaviest type of anklets, which are silver and signify tribal adherence. The women wear these as costume jewelry, but also to show their bravery as a tribe against other rival tribes. The fashion for heavy anklets is declining in India, but is still common in rural areas.

In the eastern Indian state of Odisha, which is known for its traditional jewelry, there are varieties of anklets known as Paunji Nupur, which are worn by women. Another variety, which covers the entire foot, is known as Padapadma. In ancient times men also wore anklets. Traditionally, only Kshatriya (royal/warrior caste) persons can wear gold anklets, and other castes wear silver anklets.

The word &quot;Payal&quot; (payalak) and &quot;Jhanjar&quot; are words for the anklet in Hindi and Punjabi respectively.

In Bengali language anklet is called &quot;nupur&quot; and widely worn in the Bengal region – eastern Indian state of West Bengal and Republic of Bangladesh.

In Eastern cultures, particularly India, anklets are worn on either or both ankles.

===Sri Lanka===
The dancers wear anklets. Anklets are worn on both ankles.

== As an ornament ==
Anklets can be made of silver, gold, and other less precious metals as well as leather, plastic, nylon and other such materials.

Metal anklets are of two types: &quot;flexible&quot; and &quot;inflexible&quot;. Flexible anklets, often called paayal, pajeb or jhanjhar in India, are made by tying links in a chain. Subsequently, sonorous bells can be attached to the chain, so that the wearer can make pleasing sounds while walking. Inflexible anklet are usually created by shaping flat metal sheet to the ankle.

== Bells ==
Salangai or ghunghru are small bells that Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, and Odissi dancers tie around their ankles.

== Other anklets==
Scuba divers sometimes wear lead anklets to stop a tendency for their legs to float up when diving in a drysuit. Convicted criminals may wear ankle monitors as electronic tagging devices while being confined to a specific venue.

<doc id="1067455" wikidata="Q92648" url="?curid=1067455" title="Brendan Eich">
<text>Brendan Eich ( ; born July 4, 1961) is an American computer programmer and technology executive. He created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation. He served as the Mozilla Corporation&#x27;s chief technical officer before he was appointed chief executive officer, but resigned shortly after his appointment due to pressure over his opposition to same-sex marriage. He subsequently became the cofounder and CEO of Brave Software.

==Early life==
Eich grew up in Pittsburgh; Gaithersburg, Maryland; and Palo Alto, where he attended Ellwood P. Cubberley High School, graduating in the class of 1979. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics and computer science at Santa Clara University, and he received his master&#x27;s degree in 1985 from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Eich is Roman Catholic.

He began his career at Silicon Graphics, working for seven years on operating system and network code. He then worked for three years at MicroUnity Systems Engineering writing microkernel and DSP code.

==Career==
===Netscape===
Eich started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. He originally joined intending to put Scheme &quot;in the browser&quot;, but his Netscape managers insisted that the language&#x27;s syntax resemble that of Java. As a result, Eich devised a language that had much of the functionality of Scheme, the object-orientation of Self, and the syntax of Java. He completed the first version in ten days in order to accommodate the Navigator 2.0 Beta release schedule. At first the language was called Mocha, but it was renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and finally – in a joint announcement with Sun Microsystems – it was named JavaScript in December. Simultaneously, he designed the first SpiderMonkey engine, to execute the new language in the Navigator browser.

When Mozilla inherited the Netscape base code in 1998, it included this engine, which was written in the C language. It was then changed in JavaScript 1.5 to comply with the ECMA-262 standard. Eich continued to oversee the development of SpiderMonkey, the specific implementation of JavaScript in Navigator.

===Mozilla===
In early 1998, Eich co-founded the free and open-source software project Mozilla with Jamie Zawinski and others, creating the mozilla.org website, which was meant to manage open-source contributions to the Netscape source code. He served as Mozilla&#x27;s chief architect. AOL bought Netscape in 1999. After AOL shut down the Netscape browser unit in July 2003, Eich helped spin out the Mozilla Foundation.

In August 2005, after serving as a lead technologist and as a member of the board of directors of the Mozilla Foundation, Eich became chief technical officer (CTO) of the newly founded Mozilla Corporation, meant to be the Mozilla Foundation&#x27;s for-profit arm. Eich continued to &quot;own&quot; the Mozilla SpiderMonkey module, its JavaScript engine, until he passed the ownership of it to Dave Mandelin in 2011.

====Appointment to CEO and resignation====
On March 24, 2014, Mozilla made the decision to appoint Eich as CEO of Mozilla Corporation. The appointment triggered widespread criticism due to Eich&#x27;s past political donations – specifically, a 2008 donation of $1,000 to California Proposition 8, which called for the banning of same-sex marriage in California, and donations in the amount of $2,100 to Proposition 8 supporter Tom McClintock between 2008 and 2010. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; initially reported that, in protest against his coming appointment, half of Mozilla&#x27;s board (Gary Kovacs, John Lilly, and Ellen Siminoff) stepped down, leaving Mitchell Baker, Reid Hoffman, and Katharina Borchert. CNET later reported that of the three board members who had gone, only Lilly left due to Eich&#x27;s appointment. Lilly told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I left rather than appoint him&quot;, and declined to elaborate further.

On March 26, 2014, Eich expressed &quot;sorrow for causing pain&quot; and pledged to &quot;work with LGBT communities and allies&quot; at Mozilla. Some of the activists created an online campaign against Eich, with online dating site OkCupid automatically displaying a message to Firefox users with information about Eich&#x27;s donation, and suggesting that users switch to a different browser (although giving them a link to continue with Firefox). CREDO Mobile collected more than 50,000 signatures demanding that Eich resign.

After 11 days as CEO, Eich resigned on April 3, 2014, and left Mozilla after public outrage. In his personal blog, he posted, &quot;under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader&quot;. Mozilla made a press release saying that board members tried to get Eich to stay in the company in a different role, but that he had chosen to sever ties for the time being.

===Brave Software===
Eich is the co-founder and CEO of Brave Software, a web browser platform company that raised $2.5 million in early funding from angel investors like Founders Fund, Foundation Capital, and Digital Currency Group. In January 2016, the company released developer versions of its open-source, Chromium-based Brave web browser, which blocks ads and trackers.

At Brave Software, Eich co-created the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a cryptocurrency designed for use in the Brave browser. BAT launched its ICO on May 31, 2017, and raised $35 million.

In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Eich&#x27;s comments about &quot;the policy and science related to the coronavirus&quot; on Twitter caused a backlash within the browser&#x27;s user base, commenting that this echoed the criticism that led to his resignation from Mozilla.

<doc id="1067456" wikidata="Q2940032" url="?curid=1067456" title="Caroline Lawrence">
<text>Caroline Lawrence (born 1954) is an English American author, best known for &quot;The Roman Mysteries&quot; series of historical novels for children. The series is about a Roman girl called Flavia and her three friends: Nubia (a freed slave girl), Jonathan (a shunned Jewish boy) and Lupus (a beggar boy without a tongue). The series has won numerous awards and has been published in many different languages worldwide. In March 2010, Lawrence was commissioned to write another history mystery series of books called The Western Mysteries, set in Virginia City, Nevada Territory in the early 1860s.

== Biography ==

Lawrence was born in London, England. Her American parents returned to the United States shortly afterwards and she grew up in Bakersfield, California with her younger brother and sister. Her father taught English and drama in a local high school and her mother was an artist.

When she was twelve, Caroline&#x27;s family moved to Stanford University in northern California so that her father could study Linguistics. She afterwards studied Classics at Berkeley, where she won a Marshall Scholarship to Cambridge. There, at Newnham College, she studied Classical Art and Archaeology.

After Cambridge, Caroline remained in England, and later took an MA in Hebrew and Jewish Studies at University College London. She then taught Latin, French and art at a small London primary school. In 2000 she wrote &quot;The Thieves of Ostia&quot;, the first in a series of children&#x27;s adventure stories set in Ancient Rome, the book was published in 2001. &quot;The Roman Mysteries&quot; combine Caroline&#x27;s love of art history, ancient languages and travel. Her other passions include cinema, jazz and London. Caroline has a son Simon, from a previous marriage, and she now lives by the Thames in London with her husband Richard, a graphic designer. In 2009, Caroline won the Classical Association Prize of £5000 for &quot;a significant contribution to the public understanding of Classics&quot;.

Lawrence has also worked on the University of Reading&#x27;s educational website &quot;Romans Revealed&quot;, creating stories about Roman Britain closely based on archaeological finds.

In 2013 she was chosen to be President of JACT (The Joint Association of Classical Teachers) following in the footsteps of Boris Johnson, Bettany Hughes and Paul Cartledge.

<text>The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh is the fifth novel by Salman Rushdie, published in 1995. It is set in the Indian cities of Bombay and Cochin.

==Title and influences==
The title is taken from the story of Boabdil, the last Moorish king of Granada, who is also mentioned frequently in the book. The spot from which Boabdil last looked upon Granada after surrendering is known as Puerto del Suspiro del Moro (&quot;Pass of the Moor&#x27;s Sigh&quot;). The mother of the narrator and an artist friend of the mother&#x27;s each make a painting which they call &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot;.

The book draws on a variety of real historical figures and events, including Boabdil&#x27;s surrender of Granada, the demolition of the Babri Masjid, the 1993 Bombay bombings, the gangster and terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, as well as modern Indian political entities like Bal Thackeray and the Shiv Sena. Salman Rushdie mentions Thomas Babington Macaulay in this novel.

==Plot details==
&quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot; traces four generations of the narrator&#x27;s family and the ultimate effects upon the narrator. The narrator, Moraes Zogoiby, traces his family&#x27;s beginnings down through time to his own lifetime. Moraes, who is called &quot;Moor&quot; throughout the book, is an exceptional character, whose physical body ages twice as fast as a normal person&#x27;s does and also has a deformed hand. The book also focuses heavily on the Moor&#x27;s relationships with the women in his life, including his mother Aurora, who is a famous national artist; his first female tutor; his three older sisters, Ina, Minnie and Mynah; and his first love, a charismatic, demented sculptor named Uma.

==Awards and nominations==
The book won the Whitbread Prize for &#x27;Best novel&#x27; in 1995, and the Aristeion Prize in 1996. The book was also shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1995.

The cover artwork for this book is by Dennis Leigh, more widely known as musician and multi-media artist John Foxx.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing the novel in the &quot;New York Times&quot; upon its publication, Norman Rush wrote, &quot;[T]his novel, looked at as a work of literary art, is a triumph, an intricate and deceptive one... So, another brave and dazzling fable from Salman Rushdie, one that meets the test of civic usefulness -- broadly conceived -- as certainly as it fulfills the requirements of true art.&quot; On 5 November 2019 &quot;BBC&quot; Arts included &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

<text>A Process Control Network (PCN) is a communications network layer that is a part of the Industrial Automation networks in Process Industries. This network is used to transmit instructions and data between control and measurement units and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) equipment.

==Industry requirements==
These networks have, over the years, used many of the technologies and topologies utilised in other network applications. However, Process Control Networks (PCNs) have several special requirements that must be met in order for the solution to be acceptable to the industry. These requirements are, in no particular order: Robustness, Determinacy, Compatibility. Robustness includes requirements such as connection redundancy, reduced sensitivity to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), and good error checking and correction. Determinacy involves assuring that each device is guaranteed access to the network, and in many cases mechanisms to allow priority information (such as alarms) through the system. Compatibility allows SCADA and Distributed Control Systems (DCS) from various manufacturers to communicate with control and measurement equipment from others.

==Development of standards== 
Many early PCNs were serial based, using low level standards such as EIA RS-422 and EIA RS-485 with proprietary protocols on top. One of the de facto standards (which is now becoming an open standard) is Modbus, originally from Modicon. Many PCNs used token passing based protocols because they are essentially deterministic. Both Allen Bradley and Eurotherm utilised such mechanisms. Many of the measurement and control unit manufacturers signed up to the Fieldbus consortium but rather than one standard emerging each manufacturer promoted their own &#x27;standard&#x27; leading to a myriad, and confusing, range of physical and logical systems. Modern process control networks rely on Ethernet, TCP/IP, and Microsoft Windows technology.

<text>Kumrovec () is a village in the northern part Croatia, part of Krapina-Zagorje County. It sits on the Sutla River, along the Croatian-Slovenian border. The Kumrovec municipality has 1,413 residents (2021), but the village itself has only 267 people. The municipality was established on May 6, 1997, after it was split from the municipality of Tuhelj.

Kumrovec is notably the birthplace of Josip Broz Tito (1892–1980), the president of former Yugoslavia. The birth house of Tito (built in 1860 as the first brickwork house in the village) features the Memorial Museum of Marshal Tito, opened in 1953. The museum is also important for the local folklore. Next to the house is the bronze standing statue of Marshal Tito (made by Antun Augustinčić, 1948). The old part of Kumrovec comprises the Ethnological Museum with 18 village houses, displaying permanent exhibitions of artifacts related to the life and work of Zagorje peasants in the 19th/20th century. The village is small but of great popularity in the former Yugoslavia, owing to the annual celebration of Youth Day every May 25.

Today the major attraction of Kumrovec is the Ethnological Museum Staro Selo (Old Village) Kumrovec with very well preserved village houses from the turn of 19th/20th century. The reconstruction and redecoration of these houses started in 1977. So far 40-odd houses and other farmstead facilities have been restored, which makes Staro Selo the most attractive place of this kind in Croatia. Visitors may see permanent ethnological exhibitions such as the Zagorje-style Wedding, the Life of Newly-weds, From Hemp to Linen, Blacksmith&#x27;s Crafts, Cart-wright&#x27;s Craft, Pottery, From Grain to Bread, etc.

On November 24, 1935, the Brethren of the Croatian Dragon raised a monument to the Croatian anthem Lijepa naša domovino to celebrate its one hundredth anniversary. Kumrovec celebrates this day as its municipal holiday.

==History==
In the late 19th and early 20th century, Kumrovec was part of Varaždin County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.

According to the research of Slovenian historian , during the initial phase of the German occupation of the Slovene-Croatian territory between May and June 1941, the municipality of Kumrovec was temporarily occupied by Nazi Germany, along with other parts of the western outskirts of the Croatian Zagorje (Hum na Sotli, Prišlin, Druškovec, Brezno and Lupinjak). For the first few weeks after the occupation in April, the swastika also hung in Kumrovec. The occupied territory of Western Croatian Zagorje (including Kumrovec) was returned to the Independent State of Croatia in mid-June 1941. At that time, the state and occupation border between Germany and Croatia was finally established along the water line of the Sotla river.

==Culture==
The municipality is home to the cultural organization &quot;KUD Kumrovec&quot;. It has two Catholic chapels: &quot;Kapela sv. Rok&quot; built in 1963 and &quot;Kapela Majke Božje Snježne&quot; built in 1639.

==Population==
According to the 2011 census, the municipality had a total population of 1,588 in ten separate settlements:
* Donji Škrnik (pop. 169)
* Dugnjevec (pop. 67)
* Kladnik (pop. 155)
* Kumrovec (pop. 267)
* Podgora (pop. 45)
* Ravno Brezje (pop. 216)
* Razdrto Tuheljsko (pop. 97)
* Razvor (pop. 191)
* Risvica (pop. 277)
* Velinci (pop. 104)

<doc id="1067469" wikidata="Q5941165" url="?curid=1067469" title="Type I hypersensitivity">
<text>Type I hypersensitivity (or immediate hypersensitivity), in the Gell and Coombs classification of allergic reactions, is an allergic reaction provoked by re-exposure to a specific type of antigen referred to as an allergen. Type I is distinct from type II, type III and type IV hypersensitivities. The relevance of the Gell and Coombs classification of allergic reactions has been questioned in the modern-day understanding of allergy, and it has limited utility in clinical practice.

Exposure may be by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or direct contact.

==Pathophysiology==
In type I hypersensitivity, B cells are stimulated (by CD4+ Th2 cells) to produce IgE antibodies specific to an antigen. The difference between a normal infectious immune response and a type 1 hypersensitivity response is that in type 1 hypersensitivity, the antibody is IgE instead of IgA, IgG, or IgM. During sensitization, the IgE antibodies bind to FcεRI receptors on the surface of tissue mast cells and blood basophils. Mast cells and basophils coated by IgE antibodies are &quot;sensitized&quot;. Later exposure to the same allergen cross-links the bound IgE on sensitized cells, resulting in anaphylactic degranulation, which is the immediate and explosive release of pharmacologically active pre-formed mediators from storage granules and concurrent synthesis of inflammatory lipid mediators from arachidonic acid; some of these mediators include histamine, leukotriene (LTC4 and LTD4 and LTB4), and prostaglandin, which act on proteins (e.g., G-protein coupled receptors) located on surrounding tissues. The principal effects of these products are vasodilation and smooth-muscle contraction.

Type I hypersensitivity can be further classified into immediate and late-phase reactions. Within minutes of exposure to an antigen, the immediate hypersensitivity occurs, releasing histamines and lipid mediators which are responsible for the initial allergic reaction response. However, about 4-12 hours after antigen exposure, a cough and wheezing may persist in the patient, along with swelling and redness of the skin. This is known as the late-phase hypersensitivity reaction which can last from approximately 1-3 days and is caused by the release of additional mediators from the mast cells and basophils.

The reaction may be either local or systemic. Symptoms vary from mild irritation to sudden death from anaphylactic shock.

==Treatment and prognosis==

If multiple systems are involved, then anaphylaxis can take place, which is an acute, systemic reaction that can prove fatal.

Treatment usually involves adrenaline (epinephrine) because it counteracts anaphylaxis by increasing blood flow and relaxing bronchial muscles that block one’s airways. Antihistamines and corticosteroids are also commonly used in less severe reactions.

==Examples==
Some examples:
* Allergic asthma
* Allergic conjunctivitis
* Allergic rhinitis (&quot;hay fever&quot;)
* Anaphylaxis
* Angioedema
* Urticaria (hives)
* Eosinophilia
* Penicillin allergy
* Cephalosporin allergy
* Food allergy
* Sweet itch

<doc id="1067479" wikidata="Q411022" url="?curid=1067479" title="Brucine">
<text>Brucine is an alkaloid closely related to strychnine, most commonly found in the &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot; tree. Brucine poisoning is rare, since it is usually ingested with strychnine, and strychnine is more toxic than brucine. In chemical synthesis, it can be used as a tool for stereospecific chemical syntheses.

Brucine&#x27;s name derives from this of the genus &quot;Brucea&quot;, named after James Bruce who brought back &quot;Brucea antidysenterica&quot; from Ethiopia.

== History ==
Brucine was discovered in 1819 by the French chemist Pelletier and the French pharmacist Caventou in the bark of the &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot; tree. While its chemical structure was not deduced until much later, it was determined that it was closely related to strychnine in 1884 when the chemist Hanssen converted both strychnine and brucine into the same molecule.

== Identification ==
Brucine can be detected and quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Historically, brucine was distinguished from strychnine by its reactivity toward chromic acid.

== Applications ==

=== Chemical applications ===
Since brucine is a large chiral molecule, it has been used in chiral resolution. Fisher first reported its use as a resolving agent in 1899, and it was the first natural product used as an organocatalyst in a reaction resulting in an enantiomeric enrichment by Marckwald, in 1904. Its bromide salt has been used as the stationary phase in HPLC to selectively bind one of two an ionic enantiomers. Brucine has also been used for fractional crystallization in acetone to resolve dihydroxy fatty acids, as well as diarylcarbinols.

=== Medical applications ===
While brucine has been shown to have good anti-tumor effects, on both hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, its narrow therapeutic window has limited its use as a treatment for cancer.

Brucine is also used in traditional Chinese medicine as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent, as well as in some Ayurveda and homeopathy drugs.

=== Alcohol denaturant ===
Brucine is one of the many chemicals used as a denaturant to make alcohol unfit for human consumption.

== Cultural references ==
One of the most famous cultural references to brucine occurs in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, the novel by French author Alexandre Dumas. In a discussion of mithridatism, Monte Cristo states:

“Well, suppose, then, that this poison was brucine, and you were to take a milligramme the first day, two milligrams the second day, and so on…at the end of a month, when drinking water from the same carafe, you would kill the person who drank with you, without your perceiving…that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water.”

Brucine is also mentioned in the 1972 version of &quot;The Mechanic&quot;, in which the hitman Steve McKenna betrays his mentor, ageing hitman Arthur Bishop, using a celebratory glass of wine spiked with brucine, leaving Bishop to die of an apparent heart attack.

Such fictions run contrary to reality in the very properties which make brucine useful as a denaturant, and useless as a covert poison. While being only about one-eighth as toxic as strychnine, its threshold of bitterness occurs at 69 % greater dilution. A drink laden with brucine, overwhelmingly bitter at far below lethal concentration, would cause an intended victim to gag on the first sip.

== Safety ==
Brucine intoxication occurs very rarely, since it is usually ingested with strychnine. Symptoms of brucine intoxication include muscle spasms, convulsions, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury. Brucine’s mechanism of action closely resembles that of strychnine. It acts as an antagonist at glycine receptors and paralyzes inhibitory neurons.

The probable lethal dose of brucine in adults is 1 g. In other animals, the LD50 varies considerably.

<text>Jett Williams (born Antha Belle Jett; January 6, 1953) is an American singer and songwriter.

==Early life==
Born Antha Belle Jett, she is the daughter of country music icon Hank Williams and Bobbie Jett (1922–1974), whose brief relationship with Hank Williams occurred between his two marriages. She is a posthumous child; born on January 6, 1953, in Montgomery, Alabama, five days after her father&#x27;s death on January 1. In December 1954, she was legally adopted by her paternal grandmother, Lillie Williams Stone, who renamed her Catherine Yvonne Stone. Following her grandmother&#x27;s death in 1955, Stone was made a ward of the state of Alabama and subsequently adopted by parents who renamed her Cathy Louise Deupree.

==Court fight==
Deupree knew she was adopted, but did not learn of her biological parents until the early 1980s. Although Hank Williams had executed a custody agreement three months before her birth that gave him custody of his unborn daughter, she was forced to go to extreme lengths to prove the relationship and be recognized as Williams&#x27; daughter.

In September 1984, she met and retained Washington, D.C. investigative attorney Keith Adkinson to help her. Within days, he obtained a copy of the custody contract, and within months had conclusive proof Deupree was defrauded for the financial gain of others. A lawsuit was filed based on this discovery. On September 28, 1986, Deupree and Adkinson married in Washington. He died on June 19, 2013. In 2016, Jett married Kelly Zumwalt.

In 1985, the Alabama State Court ruled she was the daughter of Hank Williams. On October 26, 1987, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled she was entitled to her half-share in the Williams estate, as she had been the victim of fraud and judicial error. Hank Williams Jr. appealed against the decision in federal court, but the ruling stood when the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case in 1990.

==Book and honors==
In 1990, she published her autobiography &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; as Sweet as My Baby&quot;.

In 2000, the Tennessee legislature passed HJR 621 designating May 18, 2000, as &quot;Jett Williams Appreciation Day&quot; in Macon County.
==Sole rights==
In January 2006, the Tennessee Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling stating Hank Williams&#x27; heirs — son Randall Hank Williams (Hank Williams Jr.) and daughter Jett Williams, Hank Jr.&#x27;s half-sister — have the sole rights to sell his old recordings made for a Nashville radio station in the early 1950s. The court rejected claims made by Polygram Records and Legacy Entertainment in releasing recordings Williams made for the &quot;Mother&#x27;s Best Flour Show&quot;, a program that originally aired on WSM. The recordings, which Legacy Entertainment acquired in 1997, include live versions of Williams&#x27; hits and covers of other songs. Polygram contended Williams&#x27; contract with MGM Records, which Universal Music Nashville now owns since 1998, gave them rights to release the radio recordings. In October 2008, a selection of the &quot;Mother&#x27;s Best&quot; recordings was released by Time-Life as &quot;Hank Williams: The Unreleased Recordings&quot;.

Jett Williams released a number of albums featuring her own songs, and toured with a version of the Drifting Cowboys to sing her father&#x27;s songs. Her nephew Hank Williams III is an ardent critic of her, calling her an atrocious performer and saying that she should have written a book instead.

<text>Bismanol is a magnetic alloy of bismuth and manganese (manganese bismuthide) developed by the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory. 

==History==
Bismanol, a permanent magnet made from powder metallurgy of manganese bismuthide, was developed by the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory in the early 1950s – at the time of invention it was one of the highest coercive force permanent magnets available, at 3000 oersteds. Coercive force reached 3650 oersteds and magnetic flux density 4800 by the mid 1950s. The material was generally strong, and stable to shock and vibration, but had a tendency to chip. Slow corrosion of the material occurred under normal conditions.

The material was used to make permanent magnets for use in small electric motors.

Bismanol magnets have been replaced by neodymium magnets which are both cheaper and superior in other ways, by samarium-cobalt magnets in more critical applications, and by alnico magnets.

<text>Easterton is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, south of Devizes. The parish includes the hamlets of Easterton Sands and Eastcott.

==Geography==
Easterton lies at the northern edge of Salisbury Plain.

The parish includes gault and greensand north-west of the road, and lower, middle and upper chalk zones ascending the slope south-eastwards on to the high plain. Across the parish run The Ridgeway along the scarp, the railway north of the greensand ridge, and the former turnpike road in between. This forms the village street, where it is bordered on the west side by a small brook. The street is in a hollow, so that gardens on the east side rise very steeply and have been terraced up the slope. Paths and lanes lead off the street to &#x27;the Clays&#x27; on the east and &#x27;the Sands&#x27; on the west. The main streets in the village are Oak Lane, Haywards Place, High Street, White Street, the Clay, Kings Road and Vicarage Lane.
==History==
Easterton is the site of a Roman villa estate, known from stray archaeological finds in the area of Kestrels in Oak Lane, west of the village. This may be linked with a mid 4th century Roman coin hoard, discovered in an urn during the 19th century and dispersed (although some coins passed to the Wiltshire Museum, Devizes). Another possible Roman site, deduced from place-name evidence, may lie at Wickham Green on the boundary with Urchfont some 2 km north of Kestrels.

Easterton&#x27;s toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;the more easterly farm&quot;. It was a tithing which formed the eastern part of the ancient parish of East Lavington, now Market Lavington. Easterton was made a separate civil parish soon after its ecclesiastical parish was created in 1874, and in 1934 Eastcott hamlet was transferred to it from Urchfont parish.

The parish has three concentrations of buildings: around Easterton Manor House and the Royal Oak inn; near the Victorian parish church; and at Eastcott along a secondary road (B3098) and interspersed with modern housing. Some older houses were lost as a result of road widening in the later 20th century. A map of 1773 suggests that there were then more buildings at Eastcott, and between Eastcott and Easterton than at present, and therefore that the settlements have declined. The survival of timber-framed houses in separate groups in an area where from the 18th century brick buildings have predominated is consistent with such a decline.

A school opened at Easterton in 1865, moved to a new building in 1876, and later became a National School. The school closed in 1971, along with the Victorian school at Market Lavington, and pupils from both parishes transferred to a new school, now called St Barnabas Church of England Primary School, in Market Lavington parish near the boundary with Easterton.

Market gardening and fruit growing by smallholders on the fertile soils of the greensand became important as the traditional sheep and corn husbandry on the chalk (&#x27;the Clays&#x27;) declined following enclosures before 1800. Samuel Moore&#x27;s jam factory was a legacy of the fruit fields. It began in a small way early in the 20th century after an earlier venture had closed, and became a major employer in the area, with 100 staff in 1972. An extension was opened in 1985, but the whole enterprise closed in 1998, and visitors to the village are no longer greeted by the all-pervading aroma of warm strawberry jam. The site of the factory was redeveloped into housing.

== Religious sites ==
Easterton was anciently a tithing of St Mary&#x27;s, Market Lavington. In 1874 a new ecclesiastical parish was created by combining the tithing with those of Fiddington (transferred from West Lavington) and Eastcott (from Urchfont). This was made possible by Rev George Bourdieu Rogers (d. 1872) of Easterton, who left money and land to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to endow the new parish, together with his house which he intended to be used as a parsonage. Louisa Hay, widow of Samuel Hay, of Clyffe Hall, Market Lavington, gave a further £1,500 endowment and undertook to build a church for Easterton.

The Church of England parish church of St Barnabas was duly built in 1875, in red brick with coloured brick decoration. Today the church is part of the benefice of the Lavingtons, Cheverells and Easterton.

A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built at Easterton in 1868. It was sold and became a private house in 1985.

Eastcott had a small chapel by 1309, which passed to Edington Priory later in the century. The chapel fell into disuse after the 1548 Dissolution and its location is not known.

== Notable buildings ==
Eastcott Manor is a Grade II* listed farmhouse of c. 1600, extended in the later 17th century and in the 18th. At Easterton, Kestrels is an early 18th century brick house, also Grade II*.

Wroughton&#x27;s Folly was a mansion in the far northwest of the parish, close to the modern boundary with Urchfont parish. It was built and enlarged by two members of the Wroughton family, Francis and Seymour, between about 1730 and 1780. After Seymour&#x27;s accidental death in 1789 the house was left unoccupied and became a ruin. Its foundations, visible in the 19th century, have now disappeared. Seymour&#x27;s ghost remains (according to local legend) recreating along his vanished driveway the furious carriage ride which ended in his death.

==Local government==
Easterton is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for almost all significant local government functions.

== Amenities ==
Easterton has a pub, the &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, a 17th-century thatched building. There is a village hall.

<text>The Catalan independence movement (; ; ) is a social and political movement with roots in Catalan nationalism that seeks the independence of Catalonia from Spain.

The beginnings of separatism in Catalonia can be traced back to regionalist and nationalist movements of the mid–19th century, influenced by romantic ideas widespread in Europe at the time. The first organised Catalan independence party was Estat Català (Catalan State), founded in 1922 by Francesc Macià. In 1931, Estat Català and other parties formed Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia, ERC). Macià proclaimed a Catalan Republic within Spain in 1931, subsequently accepting autonomy within the Spanish state after negotiations with the leaders of the Second Spanish Republic. During the Spanish Civil War, General Francisco Franco abolished Catalan autonomy in 1938. Following Franco&#x27;s death in 1975, Catalan political parties concentrated on the recovery and further increase of autonomy rather than independence.

The contemporary independence movement began around 2009 after a series of events, including the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the (People&#x27;s Party) challenging the 2006 Statute of Autonomy in the Constitutional Court of Spain; Catalan municipalities held symbolic referendums on independence between 2009 and 2011. The 2010 ruling of the court that parts of the statute were unconstitutional sparked huge protests, and a snap election in 2012 led to the first pro-independence majority ever in the Catalan parliament. The new government held a &quot;non-binding&quot; self-determination referendum in 2014, which yielded a large majority in favour of independence, but with a low turnout due to boycotting by anti-independence voters. A further election in 2015 was followed by the calling of a new, binding referendum. This was however considered illegal by the Spanish government and the Constitutional Court, as the Catalan government lacks legal jurisdiction to organize referendums. The referendum was nonetheless held in 2017 amidst great political and social controversy including police violence aimed at stopping it both before and during the voting. Amidst large protests from both the pro- and anti-independence camps, the Catalan parliament approved a motion with the aim to proclaim an independent republic. At the same time, the Spanish senate voted to take control of the Catalan institutions until new regional elections. The autonomous government leaders were arrested in the subsequent weeks with some fleeing abroad including then president Carles Puigdemont. In 2019, the new Spanish government agreed to hold a &#x27;table of negotiations&#x27; with the government of Catalonia, though refusing beforehand to consider independence or self-determination. In 2020, the Spanish government began processing a request for the pardon of the arrested leaders, which was effective in June 2021.

In the Parliament of Catalonia, parties explicitly supporting independence are Together for Catalonia (Junts), heir of the former Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC); Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) and Catalan Alliance. Parties opposed to the Catalan independence are the People&#x27;s Party (PP), the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC) and Vox. Catalunya en Comú (Comuns) supports federalism and a legal and agreed referendum.

==History==

===Principality of Catalonia===
The Principality of Catalonia was a state of the composite monarchy known as Crown of Aragon. The Principality was the result of the absortion or vassalization by the County of Barcelona of the other Catalan counties (such as the counties of Girona, Osona, Urgell or Rousillon), while the Crown was created by the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon in 1137. In the late 15th century, Aragon united by marriage with the Crown of Castile to form what would later become the Monarchy of Spain. Initially, the various polities of the Crown of Aragon, including the Principality of Catalonia, kept their own laws and customs, known as Constitutions, equivalent in the other kingdoms to the &quot;fueros&quot; ( in Catalan), and political institutions such as the Catalan Courts and the Generalitat as a guarantee of their sovereignty and jurisdiction, for which they fought a civil war during the actual union of the crowns, known as the Catalan Civil War (1462–1472) between foralists and royalists. In 1640, during the Thirty Years War and Franco-Spanish War, Catalan peasants and institutions revolted, starting the Reapers&#x27; War. The following year, the Catalan government seceded, establishing the independence of the Principality as a Catalan Republic, called France for protection and finally named Louis XIII count of Barcelona. After a decade of war, the Spanish Monarchy counter-attacked in 1652 and recovered Barcelona and the rest of Catalonia, except for Roussillon, which was annexed by France. Catalonia retained its Constitutions.

During the War of Spanish Succession, most of the territories of the Crown of Aragon, including the Principality of Catalonia, fiercely supported Archduke Charles, the Habsburg contender, who swore the Catalan constitutions, against the Bourbon contender, who would later abolish the Catalan constitutions and political institutions through the Nueva Planta Decrees. The Habsburgs&#x27; English allies withdrew from the war with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, and shortly thereafter, Habsburg troops were evacuated from Italy and from Spain. This left the Catalan government isolated, but it remained loyal to Charles and unilaterally declared the war to Philip V and the Kingdom of France. After a 14-month siege, Barcelona capitulated to a Bourbon army on 11 September 1714. 11 September, the date of the fall of Barcelona, was commemorated by Catalan nationalists from 1886, and in the 20th century it was chosen as the National Day of Catalonia.

After the War of the Spanish Succession, based on the political position of the Count-Duke of Olivares and the absolutism of Philip V, the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Castilian Crown through the Nueva Planta decrees was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state, with a centralised Spanish government. Like other contemporary European states, political union is the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state, in this case not on a uniform ethnic basis, but through the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant ethnic group. in this case the Castilians, over those of other ethnic groups, become national minorities to be assimilated. In fact, since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards Catalan-speaking territories (Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, part of Aragon) and other national minorities have been a historical constant.
It begins with secret instructions to the corregidores of the Catalan territory: &quot;will take the utmost care to introduce the Castilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed&quot;, and from there the actions, discreet or aggressive, are continued, and reach the last detail, such as, in 1799, the Royal Certificate prohibiting &quot;represent, sing and dance pieces that were not in Spanish.&quot; These nationalist policies, sometimes very aggressive, and still in forces, have been and still are the seed of repeated territorial conflicts within the State.

===Nineteenth and twentieth century===
Although since its loss there were claims to recover the Constitutions, the beginnings of separatism in Catalonia can be traced back to the mid–19th century. The Renaixença (cultural renaissance), which aimed at the revival of the Catalan language and Catalan traditions, led to the development of Catalan nationalism and a desire for self-government, through a Spanish federal republic or even the independence. Between the 1850s and the 1910s, some individuals, organisations and political parties started demanding full independence of Catalonia from Spain.

The first pro-independence political party in Catalonia was Estat Català (Catalan State), founded in 1922 by Francesc Macià. Estat Català went into exile in France during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923–1930), launching an unsuccessful uprising from Prats de Molló in 1926. In March 1931, following the overthrow of Primo de Rivera, Estat Català joined with the Partit Republicà Català (Catalan Republican Party) and the political group L&#x27;Opinió (Opinion) to form Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia; ERC), with Macià as its first leader. The following month, the ERC achieved a spectacular victory in the municipal elections that preceded the 14 April proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. Macià proclaimed a Catalan Republic on 14 April, but after negotiations with the provisional government he was obliged to settle for autonomy, under a revived Generalitat of Catalonia. Catalonia was granted a statute of autonomy in 1932, which lasted until the Spanish Civil War. In 1938, General Franco abolished both the Statute of Autonomy and the Generalitat.

A section of Estat Català which had broken away from the ERC in 1936 joined with other groups to found the Front Nacional de Catalunya (National Front of Catalonia; FNC) in Paris in 1940. The FNC declared its aim to be &quot;an energetic protest against Franco and an affirmation of Catalan nationalism&quot;. Its impact, however, was on Catalan exiles in France rather than in Catalonia itself. The FNC in turn gave rise to the Partit Socialista d&#x27;Alliberament Nacional (Socialist Party of National Liberation; PSAN), which combined a pro-independence agenda with a left-wing stance. A split in the PSAN led to the formation of the Partit Socialista d&#x27;Alliberament Nacional - Provisional (Socialist Party of National Liberation – Provisional; PSAN-P) in 1974.

Following Franco&#x27;s death in 1975, Spain moved to restore democracy. A new constitution was adopted in 1978, which asserted the &quot;indivisible unity of the Spanish Nation&quot;, but acknowledged &quot;the right to autonomy of the nationalities and regions which form it&quot;. Independence parties objected to it on the basis that it was incompatible with Catalan self-determination, and formed the Comité Català Contra la Constitució Espanyola (Catalan Committee Against the Constitution) to oppose it. The constitution was approved in a referendum by 88% of voters in Spain overall, and just over 90% in Catalonia. It was followed by the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979, which was approved in a referendum, with 88% of voters supporting it. This led to the marginalisation or disappearance of pro-independence political groups, and for a time the gap was filled by militant groups such as Terra Lliure.

In 1981, a manifesto issued by intellectuals in Catalonia claiming discrimination against the Castilian language, drew a response in the form of published letter, &#x27; (&quot;Call for Solidarity in Defence of the Catalan Language, Culture and Nation&quot;), which called for a mass meeting at the University of Barcelona, out of which a popular movement arose. The Crida organised a series of protests that culminated in a massive demonstration in the Camp Nou on 24 June 1981. Beginning as a cultural organisation, the Crida soon began to demand independence. In 1982, at a time of political uncertainty in Spain, the &#x27; (LOAPA) was introduced in the Spanish parliament, supposedly to &quot;harmonise&quot; the autonomy process, but in reality to curb the power of Catalonia and the Basque region. There was a surge of popular protest against it. The Crida and others organised a huge rally against LOAPA in Barcelona on 14 March 1982. In March 1983, it was held to be &quot;ultra vires&quot; by the Spanish Constitutional Court. During the 1980s, the Crida was involved in nonviolent direct action, among other things campaigning for labelling in Catalan only, and targeting big companies. In 1983, the Crida&#x27;s leader, Àngel Colom, left to join the ERC, &quot;giving an impulse to the independentist refounding&quot; of that party.

In 1992 the police operation known as &quot;Operation Garzón&quot; saw the arrest of 45 Catalan pro-independence activists and politicians on the eve of the Summer Olympics held in Barcelona, under the accusation to be members of Terra Lliure without real proof. 25 of the arrested were kept in solitary confinement. They denounced torture at the hands of the Spanish police and threats of violence and rape to them and their families, as well as constant anti-Catalan insults.

===Second Statute of Autonomy and after===
Following elections in 2003, the moderate nationalist Convergència i Unió (CiU), which had governed Catalonia since 1980, lost power to a coalition of left-wing parties composed of the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC), the pro-independence Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) and a far-left/Green coalition (ICV–EUiA), headed by Pasqual Maragall. The government produced a draft for a new Statute of Autonomy, which was supported by the CiU and was approved by the parliament by a large majority. The draft statute then had to be approved by the Spanish parliament, which could make changes; it did so, removing clauses on finance and the language, and an article stating that Catalonia was a nation. When the amended statute was put to a referendum on 18 June 2006, the ERC, in protest, called for a &quot;no&quot; vote. The statute was approved, but turnout was only 48.9%. At the subsequent election, the left-wing coalition was returned to power, this time under the leadership of José Montilla.
In November 2005, Omnium Cultural organized a meeting of Catalan and Madrid intellectuals in the Círculo de bellas artes in Madrid to show support for ongoing reform of Catalan Statute of Autonomy, which sought to resolve territorial tensions, and among other things better protect the Catalan language. On the Catalan side, a flight was made with one hundred representatives of the cultural, civic, intellectual, artistic and sporting world of Catalonia, but on the Spanish side, except Santiago Carrillo, a politician from the Second Republic, did not attend any more. The subsequent failure of the statutory reform with respect to its objectives opened the door to the growth of Catalan sovereignty.

The conservative , which had opposed the statute in the Spanish parliament, challenged its constitutionality in the Spanish High Court of Justice. The case lasted four years. In its judgement, issued on 18 June 2010, the court ruled that fourteen articles in the statute were unconstitutional, and that 27 others were to be interpreted restrictively. The affected articles included those that gave preference to the Catalan language, freed Catalonia from responsibility for the finances of other autonomous communities, and recognised Catalonia as a nation. The full text of the judgement was released on 9 July 2010, and the following day a protest demonstration organised by the cultural organisation Òmnium Cultural was attended by over a million people, and led by José Montilla.

During and after the court case, a series of symbolic referendums on independence were held in municipalities throughout Catalonia. The first of these was in the town of Arenys de Munt on 13 September 2009. About 40% of eligible voters participated, of whom 96% voted for independence. In all, 552 towns held independence referendums between 2009 and 2011. These, together with demonstrations organised by Òmnium Cultural and the Assemblea Nacional Catalana (ANC), represented a &quot;bottom-up&quot; process by which society influenced the political movement for independence. At an institutional level, several municipalities of Catalonia came together to create the Association of Municipalities for Independence, an organisation officially established on 14 December 2011 in Vic which brought local organisations together to further the national rights of Catalonia and promote its right to self-determination. The demonstration of 11 September 2012 explicitly called on the Catalan government to begin the process of secession. Immediately after it, Artur Mas, whose CiU had regained power in 2010, called a snap election for 25 November 2012, and the parliament resolved that a referendum on independence would be held in the life of the next legislature. Although the CiU lost seats to the ERC, Mas remained in power.

===2014 Referendum===

Mas and ERC leader Oriol Junqueras signed an agreement by which the ERC would support the CiU on sovereignty issues while on other matters it might oppose it. The two leaders drafted the Declaration of Sovereignty and of the Right to Decide of the Catalan People, which was adopted by the parliament at its first sitting in January 2013. The declaration stated that &quot;the Catalan people have, for reasons of democratic legitimacy, the nature of a sovereign political and legal subject&quot;, and that the people had the right to decide their own political future.

The Spanish government referred the declaration to the Spanish Constitutional Court, which ruled in March 2014 that the declaration of sovereignty was unconstitutional. The court did not, however, reject the &quot;right to decide&quot;, arguing that that right didn&#x27;t necessarily imply sovereignty or self-determination.

On 11 September 2013, an estimated 1.6 million demonstrators formed a human chain, the Catalan Way, from the French border to the regional border with Valencia.

The following month, the CiU, the ERC, the ICV-EUiA and Candidatura d&#x27;Unitat Popular (CUP) agreed to hold the independence referendum on 9 November 2014, and that it would ask two questions: &quot;Do you want Catalonia to become a State?&quot; and (if yes) &quot;Do you want this State to be independent?&quot;. A further mass demonstration, the Catalan Way 2014, took place on 11 September 2014, when protesters wearing the Catalan colours of yellow and red filled two of Barcelona&#x27;s avenues to form a giant &quot;V&quot;, to call for a vote. Following the Constitutional Court&#x27;s ruling, the Catalan government changed the vote to a &quot;process of citizen participation&quot; and announced that it would be supervised by volunteers. The Spanish government again appealed to the Constitutional Court, which suspended the process pending the appeal, but the vote went ahead. The result was an 81% vote for yes-yes, but the turnout was only 42%, which could be seen as a majority opposed to both independence and the referendum. Criminal charges were subsequently brought against Mas and others for defying the court order.
In June 2015 the CiU broke up as a result of disagreement between its constituent parties – Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya (CDC) and Unió Democràtica de Catalunya (UDC) – over the independence process. Mas&#x27;s CDC joined with the ERC and other groups to form Junts pel Sí (Together for &quot;Yes&quot;), which announced that it would declare independence if it won the election scheduled for September. In the September election, Junts pel Sí and the CUP between them won a majority of seats, but fell short of a majority of votes, with just under 48%. On 9 November 2015, the parliament passed a resolution declaring the start of the independence process, proposed by Junts pel Sí and the CUP. In response, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said that the state would &quot;use any available judicial and political mechanism contained in the constitution and in the laws to defend the sovereignty of the Spanish people and of the general interest of Spain&quot;, a hint that he would not stop at military intervention. Following prolonged negotiations between Junts pel Sí and the CUP, Mas was replaced as president by Carles Puigdemont in January 2016. Puigdemont, on taking the oath of office, omitted the oath of loyalty to the king and the Spanish constitution, the first Catalan president to do so.

Further pro-independence demonstrations took place in Barcelona in September 2015, and in Barcelona, Berga, Lleida, Salt and Tarragona in September 2016.

===2017 Referendum, Declaration of Independence and new regional elections===

In late September 2016, Puigdemont told the parliament that a binding referendum on independence would be held in the second half of September 2017, with or without the consent of the Spanish institutions. Puigdemont announced in June 2017 that the referendum would take place on 1 October, and that the question would be, &quot;Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?&quot; The Spanish government said in response, &quot;that referendum will not take place because it is illegal.&quot;

A law creating an independent republic—in the event that the referendum took place and there was a majority &quot;yes&quot; vote, without requiring a minimum turnout—was approved by the Catalan parliament in a session on 6 September 2017. Opposition parties protested against the bill, calling it &quot;a blow to democracy and a violation of the rights of the opposition&quot;, and staged a walkout before the vote was taken. On 7 September, the Catalan parliament passed a &quot;transition law&quot;, to provide a legal framework pending the adoption of a new constitution, after similar protests and another walkout by opposition parties. The same day, 7 September, the Spanish Constitutional Court suspended the 6 September law while it considered an appeal from Mariano Rajoy, seeking a declaration that it was in breach of the Spanish constitution, meaning that the referendum could not legally go ahead on 1 October. The law was finally declared void on 17 October and is also illegal according to the Catalan Statutes of Autonomy which require a two-thirds majority in the Catalan parliament for any change to Catalonia&#x27;s status.

The national government seized ballot papers and cell phones, threatened to fine people who staffed the polling stations up to €300,000, shut down web sites, and demanded that Google remove a voting location finder from the Android app store. Police were sent from the rest of Spain to suppress the vote and close polling locations, but parents scheduled events at schools (where polling places are located) over the weekend and vowed to occupy them to keep them open during the vote. Some election organizers were arrested, including Catalan cabinet officials, while demonstrations by local institutions and street protests grew larger.

The referendum took place on 1 October 2017, despite being suspended by the Constitutional Court, and despite the action of Spanish police to prevent voting in some centres. Images of violence from Spanish riot police beating Catalan voters shocked people and human rights organizations across the globe and resulted in hundreds of injured citizens according to Catalan government officials. Some foreign politicians, including the former Belgian Prime-Minister Charles Michel, condemned violence and called for dialogue. According to the Catalan authorities, 90% of voters supported independence, but turnout was only 43%, and there were reports of irregularities. On 10 October 2017, in the aftermath of the referendum, the President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, declared the independence of Catalonia but left it suspended. Puigdemont said during his appearance in the Catalan parliament that he assumes, in presenting the results of the referendum, &quot;the people&#x27;s mandate for Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic&quot;, but proposed that in the following weeks the parliament &quot;suspends the effect of the declaration of independence to engage in a dialogue to reach an agreed solution&quot; with the Spanish Government.

On 25 October 2017, after the Spanish government had threatened to suspend the Catalan autonomy through article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the UN Independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, Alfred de Zayas, deplored the decision to suspend Catalan autonomy, stating &quot;This action constitutes retrogression in human rights protection, incompatible with Articles 1, 19, 25 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Pursuant to Articles 10(2) and 96 of the Spanish Constitution, international treaties constitute the law of the land and, therefore, Spanish law must be interpreted in conformity with international treaties.&quot;

On 27 October 2017 the Catalan Parliament voted in a secret ballot to approve a resolution declaring independence from Spain by a vote of 70–10 in the absence of the constitutionalist deputies, who refused to participate in a vote considered illegal for violating the decisions of the Constitutional Court of Spain.

As a result, the same day (27 October 2017) Article 155 of the Spanish constitution was triggered by the Spanish government; the Catalan government was dismissed and direct rule was imposed from the central government in Madrid.

Under direct rule from Spain, elections were held in Catalonia on 21 December 2017. The three pro-independence parties retained their control of parliament with a reduced majority of 70 seats and a combined 47.5% of valid votes cast. Inés Arrimadas&#x27; anti-independence Ciudadanos party was the most voted party with 25.4% of votes, the first time in Catalan history that a non-nationalist party won most votes and seats in an election. Parties which endorsed the suspension of autonomy by central government represented 43.5% of votes cast and parties which did not include independence in their electoral program amounted to 52.5% of the vote, notably Catcomu-Podem (7.5% of votes and 8 seats), which is opposed to independence but supports a legal referendum and denounced the suspension of autonomy. The excellent performance of the centre-right parties on both sides of the independence debate, Ciudadanos and Juntxcat, and the underperformance of all other parties (notably, left wing parties and the Partido Popular) were the most significant factor in this election result.

===The trial of Catalonia independence leaders and October 2019 protests===
In 2018 some of the independence leaders were sent to preventive detention without bail, accused of crimes of rebellion, disobedience, and misuse of public funds. Carles Puigdemont and four members of his cabinet fled into self-exile.

Twelve people were tried by the Supreme Court of Spain, including the previous vice president Oriol Junqueras of the regional government and most of the cabinet as well as political activists Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart and the former Speaker of the Parliament of Catalonia Carme Forcadell. The trial proceedings officially ended on 12 June 2019. A unanimous verdict by the seven judges that tried the case was made public on 14 October 2019. Nine of the 12 accused received prison sentences for the crimes of sedition; of them, four were also found guilty of misuse of public funds. Their sentences ranged from 9 to 13 years. The remaining three accused were found guilty of disobedience and were sentenced to pay a fine but received no prison term. The court dismissed the charges of rebellion. Some of the defendants of the trial have expressed their intention to appeal to the Constitutional Court of Spain and the European Court of Human Rights. The verdict delivered by the Supreme Court sparked multiple protests across the region.

Clashes erupted into open violence, as protesters reacted violently at police efforts to end the demonstration, with some demonstrators setting cars on fire and throwing jars of acid at police officers. The Catalan Law Enforcement agency Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra, which had previously been accused of aiding the independence movement, replied by firing tear gas at the demonstrators. The pro-independence speaker of the Catalan Parliament condemned the violent incidents and called for peaceful protests against the ruling. The protests grew larger, as more and more Catalans took to the streets. Some demonstrators attempted to storm buildings belonging to the Spanish Government and clashed with police forces. The Spanish Police announced that 51 protesters had been arrested.

On 17 October, the pro-independence President of the Catalan Autonomous government, Quim Torra, called for an immediate halt to violence and disassociated himself from violent protesters, while at the same time calling for more peaceful protests. Nevertheless, the situation in Barcelona had evolved into open street battles between protesters and police, as both violent demonstrators attacked and provoked police forces, and police officers charged peaceful protesters for their proximity to violent ones.

Several reports claim that the protests and subsequent riots had been infiltrated by Neo-Nazis who used the marches as an opportunity to incite violence.

Shortly thereafter, the Catalan President attempted to rally the crowd by stating that he will push for a new independence referendum as large scale protests continued for the fourth day.

On 18 October, Barcelona became paralyzed, as tens of thousands of peaceful protesters answered the Catalan President&#x27;s call and rallied in support of the jailed independence leaders. The demonstration grew quickly, with the Barcelona police counting at least 525,000 protesters in the city.

By late 18 October, minor trade unions (Intersindical-CSC and ) linked to pro-independence movement called for a general strike. However, major trade unions (UGT and CCOO) did not endorse the event as well as representatives of the latter contested its very nature as &quot;strike&quot;. Five peaceful marches converged on Barcelona&#x27;s city center, essentially bringing the city to a halt. Protesters further blocked the road on the French-Spanish border. At least 20 other major roads were also blocked. Clashes nevertheless took place, with masked protesters confronting riot police by throwing stones and setting alight rubbish bins. 25,000 university students joined in the protest movement by declaring a peaceful student strike.

As a result of the strike, trains and metro lines saw a reduction to 33% of their usual capacity, while buses saw a reduction to 25–50% of their usual capacity. The roads to the French border remained blocked and all roads leading into Barcelona were also cut. 190 flights in and out of the city were cancelled as a result of the strike. Spanish car manufacturer SEAT further announced a halt in the production of its Martorell plant and most of Barcelona&#x27;s tourist sites had been closed and occupied by pro-independence demonstrators waving &quot;Estelada&quot; independence flags and posters with pro-independence slogans. The El Clásico football match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid CF was postponed due to the strike.

By the end of the day, just like the previous days, riots developed in the centre of Barcelona. Masked individuals blocked the boulevard close to the city&#x27;s police headquarters in Via Laetana. Withdrawn to the vicinity of the Plaça Urquinaona, protesters erected barricades setting trash bins in fire and hurled rubble (debris from broken paving stones) and other solid objects at riot policemen. The riot units responded with non-lethal foam and rubber bullets, tear gas and smoke grenades. The Mossos used for the first time the water cannon trunk acquired in 1994 from Israel in order to make way across the barricades. The clashes spread to cities outside Barcelona, with Spain&#x27;s acting interior minister stating that 207 policemen had been injured since the start of the protests, while also noting that 128 people had been arrested by the nation&#x27;s police forces. Miquel Buch, the Catalan Interior Minister, responsible for public order, and a pro-independence politician, called the violence &quot;unprecedented&quot; and distanced himself from the violent events, instead calling for peaceful protests to continue.

On 19 October, following a fifth consecutive night of violence, Catalan President Quim Torra called for talks between the Catalan independence movement and the Spanish government, adding that violence had never been the &quot;flag&quot; of the independence movement. The head of the Spanish Government, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, refused to hold talks with the Catalan government, as it deemed the former had not condemned the violence strongly enough. He further categorically rejected the idea of discussing Catalan Independence, stating that it was impossible under Spanish law.

===2021 and 2024 elections===
In the 2021 regional election, which saw a low turnout due to the COVID-19 pandemic, pro-independence parties won over 50% of the popular vote for the first time, and increased their representation in the parliament from 70 to 74 seats. In June 2021, the nine activists who had been jailed in 2019 were released, having been pardoned by King Felipe VI on the advice of Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez. In 2024, the Congress of Deputies voted in favour of amnesty for all those involved in the 2017 campaign, including Carles Puigdemont; despite the law being vetoed by the Senate, it was expected to be enacted by the end of May 2024. On May 30, the Spanish Parliament voted 177 to 172 to pass a bill granting amnesty to hundreds of Catalan secessionists involved in the Catalan declaration of independence from 2011 to 2017.

Junts and the ERC split in October 2022, leaving Pere Aragonès leading a minority government. In March 2024 Aragonès called a snap election after his budget was voted down. In that election, the pro-independence parties lost their majority in the parliament for the first time in 10 years. Junts slightly increased their number of seats, but the ERC and CUP lost heavily, meaning the pro-independence were far short of the 68 seats needed to form a government.

== Support for independence ==
=== Recent pro-independence vote evolution ===
==== Catalan regional elections, consultation and independence referendum ====
The parties explicitly campaigning for independence currently represented in the Catalan Parliament are the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC); the Junts per Catalunya coalition (composed of Crida Nacional per la República, Acció per la República, Els Verds–Alternativa Verda, and splinter elements from the PDeCAT); and the Candidatura d&#x27;Unitat Popular (CUP), which included the smaller parties Endavant and Poble Lliure. They obtained 33, 32 and 9 seats, respectively, in the 2021 regional election (a total of 74 out of 135 seats). Including those who won no seats, pro-independence parties had an overall share of 51.3% of the popular vote.

Other smaller pro-independence parties or coalitions, without present representation in any parliament, are PDeCAT (formerly called CDC), Catalan Solidarity for Independence, Estat Català, PSAN, and Reagrupament. There are also youth organisations such as Young Republican Left of Catalonia, Arran, La Forja, and the student unions SEPC and FNEC.

==== Spanish general elections in Catalonia====

==== Elections to the European Parliament in Catalonia====
==== Unofficial consultations and referendums ====
=== Others ===
From around 2010, support for Catalan independence broadened from being the preserve of traditional left or far-left Catalan nationalism. Relevant examples are the liberal economists Xavier Sala-i-Martín and Ramon Tremosa Balcells (elected deputy for CiU in the European parliament in the 2009 election), the lawyer and current FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta or the jurist and former member of the Consejo General del Poder Judicial Alfons López Tena.

The &quot;Cercle d&#x27;Estudis Sobiranistes&quot;, a think tank led by the jurists Alfons López Tena and Hèctor López Bofill, was founded in 2007. It affiliated with Solidaritat Catalana per la Independència (Catalan Solidarity for Independence) in 2011.

At the beginning of 2021, Òmnium Cultural published a manifesto to obtain amnesty for Catalan politicians persecuted by the Spanish justice system. Among the signatories are four Nobel Peace Prize winners and several world-renowned personalities such as Yoko Ono Lennon and Dilma Rousseff. The Nobel Peace Prize winners that signed the manifesto are: Jody Williams, Mairead Corrigan, Shirin Ebadi and Adolfo Pérez Esquivel.

== Opposition to independence ==

=== Political parties ===
All of the Spanish national political parties in Catalonia reject the idea of independence, except En Comú Podem and its successor Comuns Sumar, which are pro-referendum but have remained neutral on the issue. Together they represent a minority of votes and a minority of seats in the Catalan parliament. Others such as Citizens, and the People&#x27;s Party of Catalonia, which had 25.4% and 4.2% of the vote respectively in the 2017 Catalan regional election, have always opposed the notion of Catalan self-determination. The Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (13.9% of the vote) opposes independence as well. While some of its members supported the idea of a self-determination referendum up until 2012, the official position as of 2015 is that the Spanish Constitution should be reformed in order to better accommodate Catalonia. A slight majority of voters of left-wing platform Catalonia In Common-We Can (Catalunya En Comú-Podem) (8.94%) reject independence although the party favours a referendum in which it would campaign for Catalonia remaining part of Spain. CDC&#x27;s Catalanist former-partner Unió came out against independence and fared badly in every subsequent election, eventually disbanding due to bankruptcy in 2017. Vox also strongly opposes the idea of independence or a referendum, even going so far as to propose a ban on pro-independence parties.

=== Anti-independence movement ===

On 8 October 2017, Societat Civil Catalana held a rally against Catalan independence; the organisers claimed that over a million people attended, while the Barcelona police force estimated the number at about 300,000. To date this event is the largest pro-Constitution and anti-independence demonstration in the history of Catalonia.

On 12 October 2017, 65,000 people, according to the Barcelona police, marched against independence in a smaller demonstration marking the Spanish national day. The turnout was thirteen times more than the prior year and the highest on record in Barcelona&#x27;s history for this event.

On 29 October 2017, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated on the streets of Barcelona in favor of the unity of Spain and celebrating the Spanish government forcing new regional elections in December, in a demonstration called by Societat Civil Catalana. According to the Delegation of the Spanish government in Catalonia the turnout was of 1,000,000 people whereas according to the Barcelona police it was of 300,000 people. Societat Civil Catalana itself estimated the turnout at 1,000,000 people.

In 2017 the concept of &#x27;Tabarnia&#x27; became popular on social media and received widespread media attention. Tabarnia is a fictional region covering urban coastal Catalonia demanding independence from the wider region, should it proceed with independence. Arguments in favor of Tabarnia satirically mirror those in favor of Catalan independence from Spain. Numerous pro-independence groups and individuals were critical of the concept and responded that the parody unfairly trivializes Catalonia&#x27;s independence movement, which is based in part on Catalonia&#x27;s distinct culture and identity. This proposal, from a platform created in 2011, was shown to map the electoral results of the Catalan regional election of 21 December 2017, which provoked renewed interest. The word &#x27;Tabarnia&#x27; went viral on 26 December 2017, reaching worldwide top-trending status with over 648,000 mentions. The first major demonstration in favour of Tabarnia&#x27;s autonomy from Catalonia took place in Barcelona on 4 February 2017, with 15,000 participants according to the Guàrdia Urbana and 200,000 according to organizers.

In these years, different figures from Catalan culture and politics have spoken out against the process, like Joan Manuel Serrat, Josep Borrell, Isabel Coixet, Pau Gasol, Mercedes Milá, &quot;Estopa&quot;, Montserrat Caballé or Núria Espert among others.

==Opinion polling==

This is a list of recent opinion polling on the subject. Most polls are conducted by the Centre d&#x27;Estudis d&#x27;Opinió, a research institute under the purview of the Catalan government, or the Institut de Ciencès Politiques i Socials, a part of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. However newspapers such as &quot;La Vanguardia&quot; or &quot;El Periodico&quot; also sometimes conduct polls on the subject.

Questions about a referendum are listed below if asked, however the ICPS also asked &#x27;Do you want Catalunya to be an independent state or do you prefer to stay part of Spain?&#x27;, where &#x27;stay part of Spain&#x27; regularly performs ~10 points better than &#x27;No&#x27; on the referendum question.


==Long-term prospects==

Under Spanish law, lawfully exiting Spain would require the Spanish parliament to amend the constitution. It may be difficult for an independent Catalonia to gain international recognition; for example, many countries (including Spain) fail to recognize Kosovo, despite Kosovo having a strong humanitarian claim to independence. Most of Catalonia&#x27;s foreign exports go to the European Union; Catalonia would need Spain&#x27;s permission if it wishes to eventually re-enter the EU following secession. Catalonia already runs its own police, schools, healthcare, transport, agriculture, environment policy, and municipal governments. Other institutions, such as a central bank and a revenue collection service would have to be rebuilt, possibly losing existing economies of scale. Accounting measures vary, but the BBC and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; cite estimates that in 2014 Catalans may have paid about 10 billion euros (or about US$12 billion) more in taxes to the state than what it received in exchange. As of 2014, an independent Catalonia would be the 34th largest economy in the world. Should Catalonia secede from Spain, some residents of Val d&#x27;Aran (population 10,000) have stated they might break away from Catalonia, although others state that the local identity has only been recognised by the Catalan government, something the Spanish state never did.

==Criticism==

Opponents of Catalan independence have accused the movement of racism or elitism, and argue that the majority of the Catalan public does not support independence. In an op-ed for &quot;The Guardian&quot; Aurora Nacarino-Brabo and Jorge San Miguel Lobeto, two political scientists affiliated with the anti-independence Ciutadans Spanish nationalist party, disputed the claim that Catalonia has been oppressed or excluded from Spanish politics. They argued that the independence movement is &quot;neither inclusive nor progressive&quot;, and criticised nationalists for excluding the Spanish speaking population of Catalonia, and resorting to what they argue are appeals to ethnicity. These criticisms of ethnic-based appeals and exclusion of Spanish speakers have been echoed by other politicians and public figures opposed to independence, such as former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González, and the leader of Ciutadans in Catalonia Inés Arrimadas. Polls show that the wish for independence is positively correlated with having Catalonia-born parents and grandparents, families which also tend to fare better economically.

Statements by different key figures in the independence movement have sometimes contributed to this view. In 2013 Carme Forcadell, then president of the influential Assemblea Nacional Catalana and later president of the Parliament of Catalonia publicly declared that the and Citizens were not part of the &#x27;Catalan people&#x27; and hence were &#x27;enemies&#x27; to defeat. Former president of the Parliament of Catalonia Núria de Gispert has been involved in controversy over the years due to her Tweets, including comparing members of those two parties with pigs to be exported, or for revealing the address of the school where Citizens&#x27; leader Albert Rivera&#x27;s daughter studied. Quim Torra, who was appointed president of the regional parliament of Catalonia in 2018, was also involved in controversy regarding past tweets suggesting &quot;Spaniards know only how to plunder&quot; and describing them as having &quot;a rough patch in their DNA&quot;.

Members of the Catalan independence movement have strongly denied their movement is xenophobic or supremacist and define it as &quot;an inclusive independence movement in which neither the origin nor the language are important&quot;. In addition, independence supporters usually allege most far-right and xenophobic groups in Catalonia support Spanish nationalism, and usually participate in unionist demonstrations.

On the part of the independence movement, the Comitès de Defensa de la República (Committees for the Defense of the Republic; CDR) were created and organised to hinder police action through passive resistance. In September 2019, seven members of the CDR, alleged to be a branch called &quot;Equipos de Respuesta Técnica&quot; (Tactical Response Teams), were arrested for terrorist offenses; they were said to have been found with explosive material and maps of official buildings. Three of them were released on bail in October 2019.

<doc id="1067498" wikidata="Q1241160" url="?curid=1067498" title="Sharpness, Gloucestershire">
<text>Sharpness ( ) is a port in the civil parish of Hinton, in the Stroud district, in Gloucestershire, England, one of the most inland in Britain, and eighth largest in the South West England region. It is on the River Severn at , at a point where the tidal range, though less than at Avonmouth downstream ( typical spring tide), is still large ( typical spring).

There is a small community of approximately 100 residents directly adjacent to the port, in addition to the subvillage of Newtown approximately 0.5 miles to the south-east. Four miles to the south lies the small town of Berkeley.

== Docks ==
Sharpness docks began as a basin giving access to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. There were no port facilities at Sharpness itself and all traffic proceeded up the canal to Gloucester. The original Old Dock opened, with the canal, in 1827. The dock was separated from the Severn by a lock gate. The level of the basin varied for the hour or two for which the gate was open and so it was isolated from the canal by a lock with two gates. This lock was improved over time, expanding to be a ship lock of 163 ft length and 38 ft breadth and a smaller lock for trows of 81 ft and 19 ft. An intermediate lock gate was also provided in the larger lock, allowing shorter vessels to pass through more quickly and with less water consumption. A house for the Harbour Master was provided on the seaward dockside alongside the river gate. Today the Severn Area Rescue Association maintain a rescue station in the old house.

The size of the Old Dock became a drawback for increasingly large ships and so in 1874 a floating New Dock was opened to the South. This had several advantages over the Old Dock: its entrance was now through a tidal basin and a large lock. This gave a constant water level within the dock, matching that of the canal, and so no locks were needed between dock and canal, encouraging traffic. The lock was 320 ft long and 57 ft wide. For ships longer than this, the basin itself could also be used as a lock. A graving dock was provided parallel to the lock. This constant level encouraged the building of wharves and warehouses. With the new rail connections available to Bristol, Sharpness also developed as a port in its own right. At first the only stone quay was on the landward side of the dock, but after a railway swing bridge was built across the dock, the island area between the two docks also developed as a quayside.

In typical fashion for the competing pre-Grouping railway companies, there were not only two railway lines into Sharpness, but there were even two separate bridges across the dock: the Midland Railway&#x27;s low level bridge from the south east to Berkeley, and the Great Western&#x27;s high level bridge from the north and across the Severn. The line to the south was the Sharpness branch of the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, by this time part of the Midland, and opened on 2 August 1875. Although this line left Sharpness to the south, it joined the main line facing North. The northerly route across the bridge opened on 17 October 1879. An important development was on 19 March 1908 when a short Great Western line to the south of the previous junction formed the Berkeley triangle, giving a direct route to the Great Western main lines, and thus Bristol, through the Westerleigh Loop.

After the New Dock was opened, the Old Dock and its cumbersome lock access to the canal was used less and less. From 1908 the old entrance was abandoned and the Old Dock became used for ship repair. After age, storm and tide damage led to the gates being removed and sealed permanently in the 1990s, the dock water level was raised to that of the canal and the locks could also be abandoned.

Just north of Sharpness the river and canal were crossed by the Severn Railway Bridge, until it was damaged beyond repair by a barge collision in 1960. The bridge was locally convenient, schoolchildren crossing the river to go to school, but it was soon superseded for long-distance travel by the double tracked Severn Tunnel on the faster and more direct route between Bristol or London and Cardiff.

Proposals to reinstate a river-crossing at this point are frequently made especially by the local authorities in Lydney, which lies almost opposite Sharpness.

The Port Authority for the impounded dock is Canal &amp; River Trust, but the quayside activities are run by Sharpness Dock Limited. The competent (statutory) harbour authority for the river from the Severn Road Bridges up to Sharpness and on to Gloucester is Gloucester Harbour Trustees - they are responsible for navigation aids in the channel and for the provision of pilots. Pilotage up the river is compulsory (except for exemption holders) for all vessels over 30 metres length overall.

Between 1939 and 1966, the demasted sailing ship &quot;Vindicatrix&quot; was moored in the Old Dock as a training hulk for the Merchant Navy.

Seafarers&#x27; welfare charity Apostleship of the Sea, which provides practical and pastoral support to seafarers, has a port chaplain who covers Sharpness.

== Railway links ==

The port remains connected to the main Gloucester to Bristol railway line with its junction at the site of the former Berkeley Road railway station. The line is rarely used (if ever) although a steam special visited the line in April 2007, making two journeys from Gloucester. The locomotive (The Lancashire Fusilier) ran round its train using the loop at Sharpness. From the branch line, protected by locked gates, rails remain in situ around the docks and are linked to the line from Berkeley Road, however the condition of the track makes it look unlikely that any of them are usable. This is due to change as the Vale of Berkeley Railway, a charitable trust, has begun restoration work on the sidings and has plans to eventually run trains again between Sharpness and Berkeley Road, where the line joins the main Bristol–Gloucester line.

== In popular culture ==
The final episode of the third series of teenage drama &quot;Skins&quot; was filmed on location in Sharpness.

<text>Dave &quot;Davey&quot; Hilton Jr. (born December 9, 1963) is a Canadian former boxing world champion. He is also known for being convicted of sexually assaulting two of his daughters.

He is the older brother of former light middleweight world champion of boxing, Matthew Hilton.

==Professional boxing career==
He briefly held the WBC super middleweight title after defeating Dingaan Thobela in December 2000, but shortly thereafter, the WBC stripped it from him after child molestation charges were leveled against him. Hilton suffered only two losses in his career, to fellow Canadians Stephane Ouellet, and Alain Bonnamie. He later avenged the loss to Bonnamie, and has previously knocked out Ouellet twice.

==Professional boxing record==


==Legal troubles==

Hilton was found guilty in 2001 of sexually abusing his daughters when they were under 14 years old, Jeannie, born in 1981, and Anne Marie, born in 1983, between 1995 and 1998, and was sentenced to seven years in jail in a facility 110 kilometers northwest of Montreal. In May 2006, Hilton was granted parole and was freed on June 20. He made his return to the boxing ring in May 2007 and won a unanimous decision. Hilton&#x27;s daughters have written a book, &quot;Le Coeur au beurre noir (The Heart with a Black Eye)&quot;, describing their abuse in detail. In September 2004, a Quebec judge lifted a publication ban on the identities of the daughters so they could publish the book. An English translation is in progress.

On August 20, 2007, Hilton was arrested by police and returned to jail for breaching conditions of his release. It was reported that Hilton assaulted his wife and made threats. He was acquitted on the charges of assault and death threats but remained detained pending the decision of Commission nationale des libérations conditionnelles due to his conditional release violations.

Dave Hilton was again arrested on September 28, 2010, and charged with threats and assault, along with his brother, Jimmy Hilton.

Hilton remarried in September 2012, and had another daughter in March 2013.

<text>Conyza (horseweed, butterweed or fleabane) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.

They are native to tropical and warm temperate regions throughout the world, and also north into cool temperate regions in North America and eastern Asia. The New World species of the genus are closely related to &quot;Erigeron&quot; (also known as fleabanes).

The species are annual or perennial herbaceous plants, rarely shrubs, growing to 1–2 m tall. The stems are erect, branched, with alternate leaves. The flowers are produced in inflorescences, with several inflorescences loosely clustered on each stem.

Many species of the genus &quot;Conyza&quot; are ruderal species and some have been found to be resistant to the herbicide glyphosate.

<doc id="1067524" wikidata="Q1188118" url="?curid=1067524" title="Strong's Concordance">
<text>The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, generally known as Strong&#x27;s Concordance, is a Bible concordance, an index of every word in the King James Version (KJV), constructed under the direction of American theologian James Strong. Strong first published his &quot;Concordance&quot; in 1890, while professor of exegetical theology at Drew Theological Seminary.
==Use==
&quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot; provides an index to the Bible. This allows the reader to find words where they appear in the Bible. It also lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used elsewhere in the Bible.

==Strong&#x27;s numbers==
Each original-language word (Hebrew or Greek) is given an entry number in the dictionary of those original language words listed in the back of the concordance. These have become known as the &quot;Strong&#x27;s numbers&quot;. The main concordance lists each word that appears in the KJV Bible in alphabetical order with each verse in which it appears listed in order of its appearance in the Bible, with a snippet of the surrounding text (including the word in italics). Appearing to the right of the scripture reference is the Strong&#x27;s number. This allows the user of the concordance to look up the meaning of the original language word in the associated dictionary in the back, thereby showing how the original language word was translated into the English word in the KJV Bible.

&quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot; includes:
* The 8,674 Hebrew root words used in the Old Testament. (Example: )
* The 5,624 Greek root words used in the New Testament. (Example: )

Although the Greek words in &quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot; are numbered 1–5624, the numbers 2717 and 3203–3302 are unassigned due to &quot;changes in the enumeration while in progress&quot;. Not every distinct word is assigned a number, but rather only the root words. For example, is assigned the same number as – both are listed as in &quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot; ().

Due to Strong&#x27;s numbers it became possible to translate concordances from one language into another. Thus, the Russian concordance of 30,000 words from the Russian Thompson Study Bible is a translation of the English concordance from Thompson Chain-Reference Bible. In the process of compiling the Russian concordance, the Hebrew/Greek word corresponding to the English concordance word was found, and then its Russian equivalent in the Russian Synodal translation of the Bible was added to the resulting Russian concordance text.

==Strong&#x27;s dictionaries==
In the 1890 version, Strong added a &quot;Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary&quot; and a &quot;Greek Dictionary of the New Testament&quot; to his concordance. In the preface to both dictionaries, Strong explains that these are &quot;brief and simple&quot; dictionaries, not meant to replace reference to &quot;a more copious and elaborate Lexicon.&quot; He mentions Gesenius and Fürst as examples of the lexicons that &quot;Strong&#x27;s&quot; is drawn from. His dictionaries were meant to give students a quick and simple way to look up words and have a general idea of their meaning.

<doc id="1067526" wikidata="Q2029338" url="?curid=1067526" title="QF 18-pounder gun">
<text>The Ordnance QF 18-pounder, or simply 18-pounder gun, was the standard British Empire field gun of the First World War-era. It formed the backbone of the Royal Field Artillery during the war, and was produced in large numbers. It was used by British Forces in all the main theatres, and by British troops in Russia in 1919. Its calibre (84 mm) and shell weight were greater than those of the equivalent field guns in French (75 mm) and German (77 mm) service. It was generally horse drawn until mechanisation in the 1930s.

The first versions were introduced in 1904. Later versions remained in service with British forces until early 1942. During the interwar period, the 18-pounder was developed into the early versions of the Ordnance QF 25-pounder, which would form the basis of the British artillery forces during and after the Second World War in much the same fashion as the 18-pounder had during the First.

== History ==
During the Second Boer War, the British government realised that its field artillery was being overtaken by the more modern &quot;quick-firing&quot; guns of other major powers, and investigated replacements for its existing field gun, the BL 15-pounder 7 cwt. In 1900, General Sir Henry Brackenbury, the then director-general of ordnance, sent officers to visit European gun makers. At Rheinische Metallwaren und Maschinenfabrik in Düsseldorf, they found a quick firing gun designed by Heinrich Ehrhardt with a recoil system that totally absorbed all the recoil of firing, 108 guns plus spares, were secretly purchased and entered service as the Ordnance QF 15-pounder in June 1901.

At the same time, the British Cabinet ordered Field Marshal Lord Roberts, the Commander-in-Chief in South Africa, to send home artillery brigade and battery commanders &quot;selected for their eminence and experience&quot; to form an Equipment Committee. The committee was chaired by General Sir George Marshall, who had been artillery commander in South Africa. It formed in January 1901 with a wide-ranging area of study from horse-drawn mobile guns and the larger more static field guns, to harness design, and even binoculars. They swiftly established the &quot;conditions to be fulfilled by proposed new equipment&quot;; the most important were the &quot;weight behind the team&quot;, then ballistics, rapidity of fire, weight of shell, provision of shield and number of rounds carried.

British gun manufacturers were invited to propose designs. Of the many entries, five for the horse artillery gun and three for the field gun were selected and their makers invited to submit a &quot;specimen&quot;. These were tested in 1902, but none was found suitable for service although they all had good features. The makers were called to a conference and agreed to collaborate to produce a composite design. This used the Armstrong gun, Vickers&#x27; recoil system, and Royal Ordnance Factory&#x27;s sighting and elevating gear and ammunition carrying. Reduced wheel size from to was also accepted (it had been a matter the Equipment Committee had to investigate) which saved weight. Four Artillery batteries of the composite design took part in trials of in 1903, and the new 18-pounder design was accepted.

The cost of rearmament was huge, and it took some pressure from the press for the War Office to follow through. Initially the British Indian Army was re-equipped first; however, the First Moroccan Crisis changed the priorities. In the end the weapon phase-in cost £4 million (equivalent to £ with the GDP deflator) and became the biggest such undertaking to the date in British Army history.

The 18-pounder was used on all fronts during the First World War. It remained in service during the inter-war period. Starting in 1938, carriages Marks IV and V were converted to 25-pounder Ordnance QF Mark 1 on Carriage Mark 1. 18-pounder Guns served with the British Expeditionary Force in France in the Second World War and were used in other theatres as well as for training or beach defence.

== Description ==

The 18-pounder was a quick-firing horse-drawn field gun designed to be towed behind a limber and six horses. The gun barrel was wire-wound nickel-steel with a single-motion screw breech with a cartridge extractor. It fired a fixed round of shell and cartridge fixed together, which was known as &quot;quick firing&quot; in British terminology. The lower carriage comprised a single hollow steel trail fixed to the centre of the axle-tree. The limited traverse saddle supported the elevating mass and a shield. Traverse controls were on the left and elevation on the right of the saddle. Recoil was by a hydraulic buffer with telescopic running-up springs to return the barrel to its firing position.

The Equipment Committee&#x27;s conditions required tangent sights (i.e. direct fire) with the option of a telescope. However, the 18-pounder entered service with rocking bar (also called &quot;bar and drum&quot;) sights – open sights with the option of a telescope on the left and a range scale (in yards) on the right of the cradle. These arrangements also incorporated independent line of sight, meaning that the sights could remain laid on the target while the barrel was elevated or depressed. A clinometer was provided for indirect fire when the sight was aimed using a gun-arc (a refined version of the expedient devices used in South Africa) and aiming posts in line horizontally with the target.

In 1906 indirect fire goniometric sights were adopted which consisted of an alidade mounted on a circular scale graduated in degrees that was mounted on the shield. In 1910, the Number 3 Dial Sight, a refined version with a telescope and compass, replaced the goniometer. The rocking bar and telescope were retained for direct fire, as was the range scale on the right in spite of a clinometer being part of the Dial Sight mount.

In 1910, after three years of trials, the Number 7 Dial Sight was adopted. This was a very heavily modified version (notably using external instead of internal scales) of the German Goertz panoramic sight. This, with its sight mount that again included a sight clinometer, replaced the No 3. However, resolving various issues, notably with the sight and mount carrying case mounted on the shield, meant that the Number 7 sight did not enter service until early in 1914.

Unusually for a 20th-century British gun, the 18-pounder retained two-man laying throughout its life, elevation (in yards) was set on a range scale on the righthand side of the cradle. The Equipment Committee had also insisted on better methods of fuze setting, important because until late in 1914 it only had time fuzed ammunition. A hand held mechanical fuze setter was developed, and in early 1914 a &quot;fuze indicator&quot; was introduced, this converted the range into a fuze setting.
=== Mk I Gun on Mk I Carriage ===

The Ordnance Quick Firing 18-pounder Mark I gun barrel was wire-wound for one-third of its length, chosen as it was lighter, stronger and cheaper to manufacture than a fully built-up barrel. A jacket was shrunk over the wire and &quot;A&quot; tube. The Mk I gun and Mk I carriage were accepted into service on 30 June 1904.

The narrow single-pole trail design of the Carriages Mk I and II were suited to towing by teams of horses, but constrained downward motion of the breech, and thus limited the gun&#x27;s range to 6525 yards in normal use. The range could be increased to 7800 yards by &quot;digging in&quot; the end of the pole trail to increase elevation. Its distinguishing feature was the barrel, significantly longer than the 13-pounder&#x27;s and, unlike the 13-pounder, the barrel was significantly longer than the recuperator housing above it.

=== Mk II Gun on Mk I Carriage ===
The original gun design was quickly replaced in production from 1906 by the &quot;rationalized&quot; Mark II gun for ease of relining : the exterior of the inner &quot;A&quot; tube was slightly tapered, and was inserted into a matching tapered jacket by hydraulic pressure.

Mark I and II guns were still in use in the post-First World War era, and some saw combat in the Far East in Second World War.

=== Mk II Gun on High-angle Anti-aircraft mounting ===
In early 1915, a number of 18-pounder guns were mounted on pedestals, with the addition of a second recuperator and retaining catch for the cartridge case at high angle, in an attempt to come up with a workable anti-aircraft gun. The gun&#x27;s relatively low muzzle velocity, and the unsatisfactory ballistic characteristics of its shrapnel shell at high angles, made it a marginal performer in such a role. However, by sleeving the barrel down to and mating the 18-pounder cartridge with the 13-pounder&#x27;s shell, the successful QF 13-pounder 9 cwt anti-aircraft gun was produced with the necessary high muzzle velocity.

The early versions of 18-pounder anti-aircraft guns remained in service, apparently only in the home defense of Britain. 35 were in service in Britain in June 1916 and 56 at the end of the First World War. After the war, they were converted back to field gun use by removing the cartridge retaining catch.

=== Mk II Gun on Mk I Carriage with armoured oil reservoir on recuperator ===

Battlefield experience in 1914 and 1915 showed up the weakness of the original recuperator springs (which returned the barrel to firing position after recoil) and loss of oil in the recuperator under intense firing. Poor quality of wartime manufacture of the springs was also a factor. Spring shortages due to breakages meant guns remained in the firing line and had to be &quot;run up&quot; – have the barrel moved forward into its firing position – by hand, hence slowing the rate of fire. A temporary preventive measure was the addition of a distinctive armoured box-shaped oil reservoir to the front end of the recuperator to maintain the oil supply and extend spring life. This modification is visible in many photographs of 18-pounders in action on the Western Front right up to the end of the war

=== Mk I* and II Carriage ===

The recuperator spring problem was rectified with the new Mk II carriage officially introduced in the field in November 1916 with a hydro-pneumatic recuperator design which replaced the recuperator springs with a system driven by air compression and could be fitted into the existing spring housing by battery officers in the field. It is identified by the torpedo-shaped extension on the recuperator, which made the recuperator assembly nearly as long as the barrel and hence altered the equipment profile. Converted existing carriages were designated Mk I*. The Mk II carriage also incorporated a longer cradle.

In about 1917, all 18-pounders began to be fitted with a new calibrating range scale. This allowed the gun&#x27;s muzzle velocity to be set on it and automatically corrected the range for the difference between the actual muzzle velocity and the standard one.

=== Mk III gun on High-angle Carriage ===
An experimental Mk III gun was developed in 1916. It had a semi-automatic horizontal sliding block breech, with the recoil mechanism below rather than above the gun barrel. The high-angle mounting may have been an experimental dual anti-aircraft and field carriage. The design did not enter service.
=== Mk IV Gun on Mk III and Mk IV Carriage ===


A major variant (essentially, a new artillery piece with the same ballistics) was the Mark IV gun on Mk IV carriage. The Mk IV gun started testing in 1916 mounted on a new Mk III carriage with box trail, then typical for howitzers. This eliminated the original central pole trail, which had restricted elevation, allowing increased elevation to 37.5 degrees and hence increased maximum range from 6525 to 9300 yards with the 2 charge shell.

Mk III carriage was quickly superseded by Mk IV carriage as the standard field carriage.

Mk III and IV carriages incorporated a new variable-recoil hydro-pneumatic system and moved from above to below the gun barrel. The new single-motion &quot;Asbury breech&quot; allowed for higher rates of fire and a Welin tapered screw adopted for the breech. A single battery of the Mk IV gun on the early Mk III carriage was serving with 4th Army when the First World War ended. The new gun and carriage was in effect a new weapon but as the calibre and ammunition remained the same it was referred to as part of the 18 pr development cycle until the calibre was phased out.

By 1919, the standard British field gun was the 18-pounder Mk IV gun on Mk IV carriage but Britain still possessed many of the older Marks.
=== Naval Use ===
In addition to its land role 184 guns were converted to arm Defensively Armed Merchant Ships (DAMS) against U-boat attack during the First World War. The conversion entailed mounting the guns on the same type of elastic mount used by the QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss.

=== Wagons and Limbers ===
The &quot;carriage&quot; limber, towed between the gun and horse team, carried 24 rounds of ammunition. Each gun was accompanied by a second horse team towing an ammunition wagon and wagon limber carrying the gun detachment (none were carried on the gun limber) and 38 rounds in each. In action, the wagon was placed close beside the gun; its steel body provided an extended shield to protect the detachments against small arms fire.

The towed weight of the gun and loaded limber was 40 cwt (2,000 kg), the wagon and its limber were about 37 cwt. Each battery also held a second wagon and wagon limber per gun, giving first line ammunition stocks of 176 rounds per gun.

=== Inter-War Period ===

On 28 June 1922, Michael Collins effectively started the Irish Civil War by using two 18-pounder field guns, previously owned by the British Army, to bombard the Four Courts in Dublin.

The Mk V carriage with split trail entered service in 1923, it allowed 25 degrees left and right traverse without moving the trail and up to 37.5 degrees elevation. In the same year the Army began a full-scale mechanisation of the artillery: Vickers Medium Dragon tracked artillery tractors were used to tow the gun, and the horse teams began to be returned to the Army Remount Service.

In 1925, some guns were experimentally fitted on a Medium tank chassis as self-propelled artillery (the &quot;Birch gun&quot;), the Birch gun was used for the exercises of the Experimental Mechanized Force in 1927–1928.

The Mk IV ordnance was modified. In the Mk IVA, the A tube and wire were replaced by an autofrettaged loose liner. The Mk IVB was the same with minor modifications, most notably 3 shoulders instead of 2. A Mk V ordnance was designed but does not appear to have entered service.

In the 1930s, as the British Army started to fully mechanise, all guns were converted to mechanised towing. Initially, this was by fitting heavy wooden wheels with solid rubber tyres, the carriages becoming Mks IIITR, IVR and VR. Subsequently, wooden wheels were replaced by new axles, steel wheels, pneumatic tyres and modern brakes. The Mk IV and V carriages had a British conversion to produce the Mk IVP and VP on 9.00 X 16&quot; wheels. The Mk IIs, with their pole trails, had the American &#x27;Martin Parry&#x27; conversion to produce the Mk IIPA on 7.50 X 24&quot; wheels. Unlike other guns, 18-pounder was not converted to Probert pattern calibrating sights.

Introduction of a new streamlined shell, Mk 1C, with a 4/7.5 crh increased maximum range to 11,100 yards with Mks III, IV and V carriages.

Starting in 1938, Mk IVP and VP carriages were used for the new Ordnance QF 25-pounder Mk 1. This was a conversion from the 18-pounder Mk IV Ordnance. The calibre was increased from 84 mm to 87.6 mm by changing the liner.

==== Spanish service ====

After WWI, Vickers modified 18-pounder on the Mk. IV carriage to shoot 105-mm shells; this design was license-produced as &quot;Obús Vickers de 10,5 cm. modelo 1922 (105/22)&quot; at partially Vickers-owned Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval plant; those howitzers were used by both sides of the Spanish Civil War. After the start of WWII they were modernised with a lengthened (from 22 calibres to 30 calibres) barrel featuring a counterweight at the breech and redesignated as &quot;Obús de campaña Vickers de 105/30 modelo 1940&quot; Some 105/30 pieces (but not all) received pneumatic wheels.
=== Production ===
By the outbreak of war in 1914, 1225 guns had been produced, including 99 in India. UK production was by Armstrong Whitworth, Vickers and Woolwich Ordnance factory. During the First World War, these were joined by Beardmore, the Elswick Ordnance Company and, in the US, Bethlehem Steel. In the latter part of the war, component assemblies were produced by various other companies.

Total wartime production 1914–1918 was 9908 guns and 6926 carriages. Limited production of both guns and carriages continued between the wars and some carriages for use with 25-pounder Mk 1 were produced in the early part of the Second World War.

== Combat use ==
=== First World War ===

Throughout the First World War, the 18-pounder was operated by the Royal Field Artillery as the standard field gun. Some Royal Horse Artillery batteries were also re-equipped with it as their 13-pounders proved unsuited to the prevalent trench warfare.

The gun and its 2-wheeled ammunition (carriage) limber were towed by a team of six vanner horses (light draught) in pairs – lead pair, centre pair, limber pair. A driver rode the left horse of each pair. The limber was hooked up to the horses and the trail of the gun was hooked up to the limber, so the total weight of the gun and trail were supported on 4 wheels. The gun detachment all rode into action either on their own horses or on the limber and wagons, led by the No. 1 (the detachment commander, a Sergeant) on his own horse. In the early actions of the war, the ammunition wagon was positioned on the gun position to the left of the gun. The teams with their respective limbers, moving back from the gun position to the &quot;wagon lines&quot;. Ammunition was passed from the wagon to the loader. As the war progressed and larger quantities of ammunition were fired, ammunition was often dumped directly onto the gun position next to the gun pits and the wagons held in the wagon lines.

Initially, British Regular Army and Canadian infantry divisions were equipped with three field artillery brigades each with three batteries of six 18-pounders (for a total of 54 per division), and a brigade of 4.5-inch howitzers. By the end of September 1914, all reserve guns (25% above the establishment entitlements as decided by the Mowat Committee in 1901) had been delivered to France, although new production orders had been placed on the outbreak of war. However, there were insufficient guns to equip brigades of New Army, Territorial Force and other Dominion divisions, so their batteries had only four guns (total 36 per division) and at Gallipoli, Australian and New Zealand divisions had fewer brigades. In 1916, the decision was taken on the Western Front that all batteries should have six guns.

From February 1917, all divisions were standardised with two artillery brigades each with three batteries (named A, B and C) of six 18-pounders (total 36 per division) and one battery (D) of six 4.5-inch howitzers (total 12 per division). The remaining 18 guns from Regular divisions were transferred to Army control in Army Field Artillery Brigades, to be available for more flexible deployment.

==== 1914 ====

When the war began, British field guns (13-pounder and 18-pounder) were equipped solely with shrapnel shells, with an approximate 3:1 ratio of field guns to field howitzers (5-inch and 4.5-inch).

The 18-pounder shrapnel shell contained 374 small spherical bullets. A time fuze was set to initiate the shell in the air in front of the target. This blew off the shell nose and fired the bullets forward in a cone like a shotgun – they were effective up to 300 yards from the burst. For maximum effect from the cone of bullets, the angle of descent of the shell had to be flat and not plunging. At a theoretical maximum 20 rounds per minute, it could deliver 7,480 bullets per minute at a far greater range than machine guns. The gunners and officers of Regular Army field artillery batteries were expert at closely supporting the &quot;fire and movement&quot; tactics of the infantry with accurate shrapnel fire.

Shrapnel was effective against troops in the open, including those serving guns without gun shields. They remained effective throughout the war against opportunity targets, such as working parties. They were used for wire cutting and most importantly in the creeping barrage, where they prevented defenders from manning their trench parapets during a British assault. In this respect, they were perhaps the key element in the British artillery doctrine of neutralizing defenders during an assault instead of trying to destroy the enemy in their defences before an attack. Primacy of neutralizing defenders became the distinguishing characteristic of British artillery for the remainder of the 20th century.

The first trial high-explosive TNT rounds were fired in action on 31 October 1914 by 70th Battery, 34th Brigade RFA and 54th Battery, 39th Brigade RFA on the Ypres front and were quite successful, demonstrating both that they could destroy enemy guns and kill troops. From then on, Britain increasingly supplied 18-pounders with high-explosive shells.

A major lesson learned in 1914 was that the early British doctrine of positioning field guns in open or semi-open positions made them vulnerable to enemy artillery fire, and subsequently more use would be made of available sheltered and hidden positions for firing. This made the role of the Observing Officer crucial for 18-pounder batteries engaging targets as they could no longer rely on direct line of sight. These officers suffered high casualties. It is instructive to compare the photograph of the 18-pounder gun in the open at the 1914 Battle of the Marne with that below of the gun almost hidden in a pit at the Second Battle of Bullecourt in 1917.

==== 1915 ====

With Britain now attacking on the Western Front from 1915 onwards, barrages were used to neutralize defenders during an attack (first used some 15 years earlier). 18-pounder fire was also used to cut enemy barbed-wire obstacles, and high-explosive shells to inflict damage on defensive works. From 1916, light and medium mortars were increasingly used to blow aside barbed wire obstacles.

The 18-pounder continued to be used as a general-purpose light gun in other theatres, such as on Gallipoli where it was manhandled up onto the tops of steep hills such as the &quot;400 Plateau&quot;, &quot;Bolton&#x27;s Hill&quot; and &quot;Russell&#x27;s Top&quot; because of the lack of a modern mountain gun and shortage of field howitzers. The 18-pounder could attack lightly protected troops by destroying the parapets of trenches, small houses, and barricades. But its relatively flat high velocity trajectory meant that it could not reach an enemy sheltering out of the direct line of sight, in dips in the ground, on reverse slopes (such as the Quadrilateral east of Ginchy on the Somme) or in deep trenches or cellars. It lacked the power to demolish fortifications. However, it could neutralize defenders with HE or shrapnel.

Nevertheless, in the first 10 months of the war, 3628 18-pounders were ordered and only 530 4.5-inch Howitzers. Heavier guns were being collected from the farthest corners of the Empire and by June 1915 orders had been placed for 274 new heavy guns and howitzers from 60-pounder Gun to 15-inch Howitzer and a new 6-inch Howitzer designed. However, by June 1915 it had also become clear that Germany was reducing the proportion of field guns (to 3.5 per 1000 bayonets) and increasing that of heavier guns and howitzers (to 1.7 per 1000 bayonets), with one-third of their artillery being 15 cm or more. Britain had no choice but to increase the amount of heavy artillery, but did not plan to reduce the scale of field artillery because of the need for what would later be called &quot;close support&quot;. Nevertheless, a de facto decrease had happened due to expansion limiting field batteries to 4 guns.

British planners considered that they would need a 2:1 ratio for a successful offensive, while the French believed they needed 1:1. General Farndale justified the retention of 2:1 field artillery as &quot;Field guns were essential to attack targets close to our own troops and to play their part in the tactical plan&quot;.

During 1915, 18-pounder ammunition production was equally divided between HE and shrapnel, but expenditure was mostly shrapnel, 88% in September and November.

==== 1916 ====

Field artillery (both 18-pounder and 4.5-inch howitzer) was used successfully during the pre-Zero fire in the Battle of the Somme in late June – early July 1916, when the British heavy artillery damaged German defensive works and forced troops into the open to rebuild them they were successfully fired on with shrapnel. The use of field guns to provide a covering fire barrage that neutralized the enemy during the infantry advance was used and improved during the Battle of the Somme, forcing the enemy to remain in shelters while the infantry advanced immediately behind the bursting shells – &quot;... It is therefore of the first importance that in all cases the infantry must advance right under the field artillery barrage, which must not uncover the first objective until the infantry is within 50 yards of it&quot;. The small bursting range of the shell was an advantage in this case, as advancing troops could approach close to it. The 18-pounder&#x27;s role was spelled out following the Somme battles &quot;... primarily in barrage fire, repelling attacks in the open, raking communications, wire cutting and sometimes for neutralising guns within their reach, destroying breast-works and barriers with HE and preventing repair work on defenses beyond the reach of infantry weapons&quot;.

18-pounder ammunition requirements were predominantly shrapnel during 1916, although in the latter part of the year it shifted back to equality between HE and shrapnel. In July 1916, standard contract prices for UK produced shells were 12 shillings and 6 pence (62.5 pence in modern terms) for HE and 18 shillings and 6 pence for shrapnel. US and Canadian prices were significantly higher. The lowest price achieved for 18-pounder HE shells was 8 shillings and 11 pence (44.8 pence) later in 1916.

==== 1917 ====

The January 1917 &quot;Artillery in Offensive Operations&quot; estimated that 18-pounders needed 7.5 shrapnel rounds + 5% HE per yard of front at medium range to cut barbed wire defences, and 20 rounds of HE to destroy trenches in enfilade. The destruction of trenches frontally was generally estimated as requiring twice the enfilade amount. It was estimated that an 18-pounder would fire 200 rounds per day in an &quot;all-out&quot; offensive. It expressed a preference for shrapnel with a long corrector in creeping barrages due to its high number of &quot;man-killing missiles&quot; and its smoke cloud (shrapnel shells were designed to produce a white puff of smoke on bursting, originally as an aid to gunnery spotting). HE was viewed as not providing this necessary visual screen but could be considered for use in creeping and back-barrages in conjunction with smoke shell, but smoke shell was considered &quot;still in its infancy&quot;.

In its February 1917 Technical Notes on 18-pounder Barrages, GHQ stated shrapnel and HE barrages would normally cover to a depth of 200 yards and expressed its preference for timed shrapnel (T.S.) for creeping barrages, due partly to shrapnel directing its force forward hence being safer for those following, especially if it fell short. 50% air bursts and 50% percussion (bursting on contact) was considered optimal except on &quot;very bad ground&quot; where percussion rounds would mostly be wasted. HE with its lateral bursting was considered more dangerous to advancing troops (as they were assumed to be in a line abreast) than shrapnel if it burst short, but lateral bursts were considered to have less effect on the enemy as they had less &quot;forward effect&quot;. HE with delay was difficult for advancing troops to stay close behind, as it burst 30–40 yards beyond the point of initial contact. HE without delay was assessed as effective only if it burst actually in the enemy trench. With a proper barrage program and fuze setting, timed shrapnel creeping barrage was considered optimal. British regular army field gunners were already proficient in accurately timed low shrapnel bursts in 1914, as demonstrated in the early battles, but few remained by early 1917 and many gunners were relatively new recruits and inexperienced; HE had only been in use with 18-pounders for two years, so this note perhaps reflects a desire to stick with a proven method for which they could still draw on a nucleus of experts. Shrapnel appears to have been favoured for creeping barrages and a mix of shrapnel and HE for standing barrages and other tasks.

The British advance in pursuit of the German army in early 1917 as it withdrew to stronger positions on the Hindenburg Line brought a brief resumption of mobile warfare, and from the experience GHQ emphasised the need to get all light weaponry as far forward as possible to support infantry, and that &quot;Covering fire of 18-pounders and 4.5-inch howitzers can not be too far exploited&quot; [i.e. should be exploited as much as possible]. It also warned &quot;There was tendency, due to trench warfare, among C.R.A.s to attempt to control individual batteries. Brigade or group commanders should be given a task and allowed to carry it out&quot;.

At the opening of the Battle of Arras on 9 April 1917, the order was for 18-pounders to fire 50% HE and 50% shrapnel in the creeping barrage ahead of the advancing infantry, with one gun for every 20 yards of front. While a few commanders varied this slightly, such as Brigadier-General Tudor, CRA of 9th (Scottish) Division, who chose 75% HE and 25% smoke, the opening was notable for the first use of a coordinated fireplan across the whole front of several armies, with a common strategy linking infantry with artillery and coordinating the advance of various types of artillery. For instance, the 18-pounders were to move forward when the infantry reached their Phase 2 objective and the 60-pounders and 6-inch howitzers would move forward to take their vacated firing positions. This contrasted with the Somme, where individual Corps and Division commanders used their own fire plans and assault tactics.

For the Third Battle of Ypres in July 1917, the plan was for wire cutting to be done by mortars and howitzers, &quot;to conceal the strength of the field guns&quot;. 1,098 18-pounders, one for every 15 yards on average, would include shrapnel in firing a creeping barrage starting close to the British trenches and moving forward at 100 yards in 4 minutes. Field batteries were to advance beyond no-mans land as the priority was to protect the infantry while they were &quot;consolidating on their objectives&quot; (i.e. gaining and holding new advanced positions).

In the opening barrage for the first phase on 31 July, the Battle of Pilckem Ridge, 2/3s of the 18-pounders fired in the creeping barrage at four rounds per minute and 1/3 fired in the standing barrage on the German second line. The barrage was generally successful; but as the weather deteriorated, tracks turned to mud and shell holes filled with water, it became nearly impossible for guns to advance in support of the infantry as planned.

For the opening barrage at the Battle of Menin Road on 20 September, the ratio of medium/heavy artillery to field artillery reached 1 : 1.5 for the first time, reflecting more heavy guns rather than fewer field guns. 18-pounders were to fire 50%-50% shrapnel and HE with 25% of the HE fuzes set to delay. Hence the previous doubts about HE appear to have been overcome, and for the lifting barrage for the Battle of Cambrai on 20 November (this was chosen rather than a creeping barrage) the 18-pounders were to fire equal proportions of shrapnel, HE and smoke, with the precise smoke usage depending on weather conditions at the time.

A total of 47,992,000 18-pounder rounds were manufactured in 1917 and 38,068,000 were fired, (38% of its total for the whole war) indicating the extent to which the artillery war escalated in 1917. 18-pounder ammunition requirements in 1917 were generally equal quantities of shrapnel and HE.

==== 1918 ====
18-pounders were used effectively in the spring of 1918 against attacking German troops during their Spring Offensive. However, the effectiveness of the German fire plan on 21 March caused many casualties amongst the gunners, and in too many cases batteries were unable to withdraw before being overrun. Nevertheless, on 4 April, the Germans made their final attempt to break the British line having advanced to the area of Villers Bretonneux held by 14th (Light) and 18th (Eastern) Divisions, reinforced by the 16th (Irish) and 39th divisional artilleries although batteries were understrength through losses. By mid-morning, observers were engaging massed German infantry but these pressed forward and reached just east of Hamel. Brigadier-General Edward Harding-Newman, CRA of 14th (Light) Division issued the following order &quot;This attack must and can be stopped by artillery fire. If any battery can no longer effectively stop the enemy from its present position, it will at once move forward to a position on the crest, to engage the enemy over open sights. It is essential that the artillery hold the line and they will do so.&quot; Fire from several RFA brigades, mostly with 18-pounder batteries, stopped the German advance, including some from 16th (Irish) Division that deployed forward to the crest and observers from the 177th Brigade RFA using Hamel church tower. This action effectively ended the German advance.

For the successful British attack at the Battle of Amiens on 4 July, there was one 18-pounder per 25 yards of front, supplemented by machine guns, and they fired a barrage of 60% shrapnel, 30% HE and 10% smoke 200 yards ahead of the advancing troops.

In the first half of 1918, 18-pounder ammunition requirements were predominantly (about 60%) shrapnel, moving back to equality between shrapnel and HE in the final months of the war. Chemical and smoke shells were each around 5% of the total.

By the end of the war, the modern &quot;empty battlefield&quot; was evolving, with troops learning to avoid open spaces, and the light field gun was becoming obsolete, with an increasing use of light machine guns, light mortars and field howitzers which, with their high trajectory, were able to drop shells onto even deeply sheltered enemy troops on reverse slopes that field guns could not reach. The 18-pounder Mk IV, with its box trail which allowed it to fire in a high trajectory, had begun its evolution into the more versatile 25-pounder gun-howitzer.

At the Armistice, there were 3,162 18-pounders in service on the Western Front, which had fired approximately 99,397,670 rounds, and 800 guns in Egypt, Russia and on other fronts.

=== Between The Wars ===
After the Armistice in 1918, some British and Canadian 18-pounders, including a battery transported portee, were in the British Army of the Rhine in the Rhineland. It also served with British and Canadian forces in North Russia in 1918–1919 and with the Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force.

In 1919, it served with the 7th, 16th, 21st and 217th Brigades R.F.A. in the Third Afghan War, in operations in Mesopotamia 1920–21, and Waziristan 1936–37.

=== Second World War ===

During the Second World War, the 18-pounder was used mainly by Territorial Army regiments in the British Expeditionary Force. Some Regular units were also equipped with them, including K (Hondeghem) Battery, which won its battle honour with them. A total of 216 guns were lost in the 1940 campaign. This left the British Army with 126 guns in UK and 130 in the rest of the world, according to a stocktake in July 1940.

It was also used by British and other Commonwealth units in the East African campaign, and the North African campaign.

During the war against Japan (from December 1941), the 18-pdr was used in the Malayan campaign (by a number of British field regiments) and, to a lesser degree, the Battle of Hong Kong (by 965 Beach Defence Battery). At the Battle of Kota Bharu (Malaya) some of the first shots of the Pacific War were fired by an Indian Army 18-pounder. Most, if not all, of these guns were lost as a result of the defeat of Commonwealth forces and the capture of Hong Kong and Singapore. 

From 1942, the 25-pdr replaced the 18-pdr for British and Indian forces in the Burma campaign.

=== Irish Service ===
The 18-pounder was introduced to the Irish National Army in 1922 on the foundation of the state. It was first used by National Army Gunners to bombard the Four Courts in Dublin from 28 June 1922, as part of the Battle of Dublin. The departing British Forces were criticised for the lack of training that they had imparted to the gunners of the infant Irish artillery corps, and for providing shells intended to destroy barbed wire rather than the normal HE shells. The marks of the shell fire can still be seen on the walls of the Four Courts. The 18-pounder played an important role throughout the Irish Civil War, being instrumental in the fighting in Munster alongside the Rolls-Royce Armoured Car. The nine 18-pounder guns were used in the infantry support role until grouped together to form an artillery corps in March 1923.

With the establishment of the Defence Forces in 1924, the 18-pounder was the only artillery weapon in Irish service, forming the 1st and 2nd Field Batteries of the Artillery Corps. By the following year, twenty five 18-pounder guns were on hand and three more were delivered in 1933. Additional equipment received by the army in 1941 included four 18-pounder guns. The regular army&#x27;s field batteries re-equipped with the 25-pounder in 1949 but thirty seven 18-pounder guns were still in use with the reserve FCA. The guns remained in FCA service until the late 1970s, when they were replaced by the 25-pounder and 120 mm mortars.

Some examples remain preserved, including several in Collins Barracks, Cork, in McKee Barracks, Dublin and two Mk IV guns in Aiken Barracks, Dundalk.

=== Finnish Service ===
In 1940 Britain sold 30 Mk 2 guns on Mk 2PA carriages to Finland during the Winter War, but they arrived too late to be used during that combat. They were used as &quot;84 K/18&quot; during the Continuation War by Field Artillery Regiment 8, 17th Division. They were modified by the Finns who fitted a large muzzle brake and a much improved sighting system. For use in deep snow a second set of wheels were fitted.

== First World War Ammunition ==
18-pounder ammunition was a fixed round (i.e. the shell and brass cartridge case were loaded as a single unit, much like a large rifle cartridge), and fitted with a nose fuze. The normal service round was &quot;Full Charge&quot;, a &quot;Reduced Charge&quot; round was available for training. Double base propellant (nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose) was used, Cordite Mark 1 was the standard propellant when the gun was first introduced into service. By 1914, this cordite had been replaced by Cordite MD. During the First World War this was replaced by a revised formulation that was easier to produce called Cordite RDB.

Until September 1914, the only 18-pounder issued shell was shrapnel, fitted with a No. 80 &quot;Time &amp; Percussion&quot; fuze (based on a Krupp design). The timer was set to open the shell and fire the bullets forward before it hit the ground. No 80 Fuze was an igniferous type of time fuze (as were most First World War time fuzes), meaning that it burnt gunpowder at a known rate to give a time from firing to fuze functioning. The shell did not burst, but projected spherical lead-antimony bullets forward in a cone, these bullets were effective up to 300 yards from the burst. 18-pounder carried 374 of the 41/pound size bullets. The fuze was designed to function as close as 50 yards from the muzzle if required, in order to eliminate the need for case shot. Observing shrapnel bursts was difficult and, after many experiments, gunpowder pellets were added to the tube between the fuze and the gunpowder ejecting charge in the base of the shell in order to emit a puff of smoke, this had the added advantage of widening the cone of the bullet spread.

A star shell with a time fuze (No 25) had been developed and small stocks were held before the war but it was not routine issue.

Pre-war experiments with 18-pounder HE shells had been inconclusive in terms of their benefits. However, the first month of the war showed that they were worth having and the first HE rounds arrived in September 1914. This was a different shape to the existing shrapnel shell so a new Mark 2 shrapnel shell was introduced to ensure ballistic compatibility. The original shrapnel shells had a relatively blunt ogive – 1.5 circular radius head (crh), the newer ones were 2 crh.

In 1914, the standard HE used by UK artillery was Lyddite, a formulation based on picric acid, this was a powerful explosive but expensive. TNT was introduced, but this too was expensive, particularly in its pure form required for shells so eventually Amatol was adopted. This was a mixture of ammonium nitrate and lower quality TNT, various proportions were used but eventually 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% TNT became standard. The parallel inside walls of the shell made it suitable for filling using pre-formed blocks of explosive as well as pouring.

Other types of shell were also introduced, although not as extensively as they were for howitzers and heavier guns. White phosphorus smoke shells became available in small quantities in 1916, and in 1918 chemical and incendiary shells were provided. The latter was a shrapnel type shell using thermite pellets, although a black powder incendiary shell for AA use against Zeppelins was introduced in 1916.
== Second World War Ammunition ==

After the First World War, the variety of ammunition was reduced, although an armour piercing HE shell was developed. The main change was introduction of a new streamlined HE shell, 4/7.5 crh, giving a significant improvement in range. In the 1930s, the new generation of double base propellant, Cordite W, was also adopted.

<text>Infernal Affairs II is a 2003 Hong Kong crime-action film directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak. It is a prequel to the 2002 film &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;. Anthony Wong, Eric Tsang, Edison Chen, Shawn Yue and Chapman To reprise their roles from the original film alongside new cast members Carina Lau, Francis Ng, Hu Jun and Roy Cheung. Neither Andy Lau nor Tony Leung, who played the central roles in the original, appear in this film as they are replaced by their younger versions portrayed by Chen and Yue respectively. The events of the film take place from 1991 to 1997. It was followed by &quot;Infernal Affairs III&quot; (2003), which is both a sequel and a semi-prequel to the original film.

==Plot==

=== In 1991 ===
Hong Kong Police Force Senior Inspector Wong Chi-Shing meets his Triad informant, Hon Sam. Meanwhile, Lau Kin-Ming, who is due to become Hon&#x27;s prospective spy within the Hong Kong Police Force, assassinates Hon&#x27;s Triad boss, Ngai Kwun, in a mission for Hon&#x27;s wife, Mary, who wants Hon to rise up the triad ranks. Mary tells Lau to keep her order secret from all, including Hon.

With Kwun dead, the Big Four triad underbosses intend to stop paying their dues to the Ngai family, but Kwun&#x27;s successor and son Ngai Wing-Hau manipulates them to continue by blackmailing them on their mutual betrayals. As Lau enlists in the police academy, another police cadet, Chan Wing-Yan, is fired from the academy upon the discovery that he is also a (illegitimate) son of Kwun&#x27;s, despite his dissociation with the Ngais. The police tell Chan to meet Wong, who enlists Chan as an undercover cop after Chan relays his purpose of being a righteous man. Chan is imprisoned on fake criminal charges to get close to one of Hon&#x27;s men, Keung, whom Chan helped arrest previously.

=== In 1995 ===

Lau has risen as a rookie cop, due to tips on criminal dealings from Hon. Meanwhile, Chan has become a small-time gangster after his and Keung&#x27;s release from prison. Chan&#x27;s girlfriend aborts their baby due to his gang association. Hau invites Chan to join the Triad, then tells the Big Four and Hon that he wants to emigrate, leaving them the Hong Kong underworld. Hau sends Hon to Thailand to link up with Thai cocaine smugglers, Hon leaves despite Mary&#x27;s warning of a trap. Mary meets Wong; it is revealed that Wong ordered her to kill Kwun.

Hau&#x27;s right-hand-man, Law, an undercover cop, tips off the next deal of Hau&#x27;s. There, the police arrest Hau, but instead of finding drugs, they find a video located by Hau&#x27;s hired private investigators, showing Mary and Wong&#x27;s conspiracy to murder Kwun. Simultaneously, Hau&#x27;s men assassinate the Big Four. Mary admits the truth about Kwun to Hon. Spooked, Hon and Keung kill many Thai mafia. Trapped, Hon makes a desperate overture to Thai mafioso Paul for an alliance. Paul attempts to shoot Hon; the gun misfires. Hau also sends a man to kill Mary, but Lau kills him to save Mary. The police release Hau, who kills Law after discovering Law&#x27;s wire. Chan saves Hau from a drive-by shooting, possibly conducted by Lau.

Hau has a car bomb planted in Wong&#x27;s car, which kills Wong&#x27;s superior and friend, Superintendent Luk, while Wong is unharmed. Lau hides Mary in a safehouse. When she rejects his romantic advances and attempts to travel to Thailand for Hon, Lau anonymously betrays her to Hau&#x27;s men, who kill her at Kai Tak Airport.

=== In 1997 ===

Lau is promoted to Probation Inspector; Chan is a full-fledged triad member. Hon has a new wife and child in Thailand. Wong admits guilt of conspiracy to murder to an internal investigation, but the department clears him so that he can take down the increasingly powerful Hau. Wong persuades Hon to return to Hong Kong to testify against Hau, as revenge for Mary. Hau is arrested, ruining his attempt to enter politics. Hon&#x27;s testimony would threaten a short jail sentence for Hau. Chan later passes Wong decisive evidence against Hau.

Triad member John has the Thai mafia take Hon&#x27;s Thai wife and child hostage. Hon escapes witness protection and confronts Hau. Hon reveals that the Thai mafia were allied with him; they kill John. Hon also proves that Paul is holding the rest of the Ngai family hostage in Hawaii. The police arrive as an infuriated Hau prepares to shoot Hon. Hon accepts his death as revenge for Hau to be killed or jailed for life. Wong shoots Hau to save Hon. As Hau dies in Chan&#x27;s arms, he discovers Chan&#x27;s wire.

Wong laments the failure to imprison Hau. Paul insists on executing the Ngai family to tie up loose ends, despite Hon&#x27;s reluctance. The murders turn Hon into a top criminal target for Wong. Undercover cop Chan joins Keung in Hon&#x27;s triad, while Lau, Hon&#x27;s police spy, handles a case for a young woman, Mary, his future fiancée, setting up the events of &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;.

<doc id="1067529" wikidata="Q12068773" url="?curid=1067529" title="Severn Railway Bridge">
<text>The Severn Railway Bridge (historically called the Severn Bridge) was a bridge carrying the railway across the River Severn between Sharpness and Lydney in Gloucestershire, England. It was built in the 1870s by the Severn Bridge Railway Company, primarily to carry coal from the Forest of Dean to the docks at Sharpness; it was the furthest-downstream bridge over the Severn until the opening of the Severn road bridge in 1966. When the company got into financial difficulties in 1893, it was taken over jointly by the Great Western Railway and the Midland Railway companies. The bridge continued to be used for freight and passenger services until 1960, and saw temporary extra traffic on the occasions that the Severn Tunnel was closed for engineering work.

The bridge was constructed by Hamilston&#x27;s Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. It was approached from the north via a masonry viaduct and had twenty-two spans. The pier columns were formed of circular sections, bolted together and filled with concrete. The twenty-one regular wrought iron spans were then put in place, as well as the southernmost span, the swing bridge over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. The bridge was long and above high water. of iron were used in its construction.

A number of incidents took place at the bridge over the years, with vessels colliding with the piers due to the strong tides. In 1960 two river barges hit one of the piers on the bridge, causing two spans to collapse into the river. Repair work was under consideration when a similar collision occurred the following year, after which it was decided that it would be uneconomical to repair the bridge. It was demolished between 1967 and 1970, with few traces remaining.

==Construction==
For more than fifty years before the Severn Railway Bridge was opened, there had been discussion and various proposals for rail routes to cross the Severn downstream of Gloucester, either by a bridge or a tunnel, but most of these did not leave the drawing board. The exception was a tunnel near Newnham on Severn in 1810; this had been excavated partway under the river when water broke in, and the tunnellers were lucky to escape with their lives. The damage was irreparable and the project abandoned. In 1845, an ambitious project by Isambard Kingdom Brunel was to bridge the Severn near Awre for his projected South Wales Railway, bypassing Gloucester completely. This plan got close to receiving the approval of Parliament but did not proceed. Other schemes were mooted and in 1871, six different schemes were under consideration. Finally the Severn Bridge Railway&#x27;s scheme was approved by Parliament and received Royal Assent on 18 July 1872.
The Severn Railway Bridge was built by the Severn Bridge Railway Company to transport coal from the Forest of Dean on the Severn and Wye Railway. At the time it was expected that the amount of coal freighted would increase year by year and the existence of a bridge would remove the necessity for the coal to be shipped via Gloucester. Work began in 1875 and was completed in 1879; the wrought iron bridge, which was long and above high water, had twenty-two spans and had stone abutments made from local limestone. The first span across the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which ran parallel to the Severn at this point, operated as a swing bridge. The twenty-one fixed spans, in order of erection from the southeast (Sharpness) side, consisted of thirteen of length , five of length , two of length , and a single span of length . The bridge incorporated of iron. It was approached from the south-east by a two-arch masonry viaduct on the canal embankment leading to the swing bridge, and on the northwest by a 12-arch viaduct about high.

The river, with its large tidal range (the Severn bore) and strong currents, made construction difficult. The pier columns were formed of cylindrical sections, about in diameter. Near the west bank, the bedrock was a long way below the shifting sands so much work had to prepare firm foundations. Staging was used through which the sections were lowered by chains, and when in place, filled with concrete. Near the east bank, a primitive piling machine was used to drive the sections through a ridge of clay. The staging was extended upwards for use while assembling the spans.

The spans were assembled on site. Staging was laid and rails put in place to carry a travelling crane. The long beams were hoisted in place first, followed by the vertical bracings, and then the outer and inner plates of the top chordal trusses and the diagonals. The whole structure was bolted together at first, and later riveted by blacksmiths using hand-operated forges. Some individual spans were completed within a week, with contractors being complimented on the efficiency of their work.

The main contractor was Hamilston&#x27;s Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. They were tasked with the founding and erection of the pier cylinders on the riverbed, and the erection and riveting of the twenty-one bowstring spans and the swing bridge over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. They were also responsible for another swing bridge on the North Docks Branch of the line close to the New Docks at Sharpness. The company manufactured the castings and the wrought-iron structures for the bridge. Project manager George Earle was later given a watch praising his ability and enthusiasm for carrying out the project. The engineers for the project were George Wells Owen and George William Keeling.

==History==

The bridge carried a single-track railway line. When it came into service, it took approximately off the journey from Bristol to Cardiff, with trains no longer having to pass through Gloucester. The bridge predated the construction of the Severn Tunnel, around downstream, by seven years. The opening ceremony for the bridge took place on 17 October 1879; nearly 400 dignitaries travelled in twenty-three first class carriages across the bridge and back again, with fog detonators exploding on each of the spans during the return trip. A banquet followed at the Pleasure Grounds near Sharpness station.

During construction, it was anticipated that the Severn Bridge Railway would mainly receive its revenue from carrying coal from the Forest of Dean. However, the company ran into financial difficulties as coal was not carried in the volumes that had been anticipated, nor had tourist travel risen to the expected levels. Miners in the Forest of Dean went on strike about low pay and poor conditions and the coal trade there continued to be depressed. The opening of the Severn Tunnel, providing an alternative route from England into South Wales, was a serious blow to the bridge. By 1890, the company was unable to pay the interest on its debentures and faced bankruptcy. As a result, it was taken over jointly by the Great Western Railway and the Midland Railway in 1893, becoming the Severn and Wye Joint Railway.

Several fatalities occurred during the construction of the bridge. A baulk of timber fell on one man when a rope slipped, and another died when he fell from the part-completed structure, injuring himself on the staging as he fell. Only a few days after the bridge&#x27;s opening, a rowing boat trying to pass underneath was caught in a giant eddy and capsized, one occupant being drowned. Over the succeeding years a number of incidents happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow &quot;Brothers&quot; was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the &quot;Victoria&quot;, employed in the bridge&#x27;s construction, was wrecked in the 1880s. In 1938, a tug and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by the tide into the bridge; a connecting hawser snagged one of the piers and the vessels capsized, with several fatalities.

In 1943, a flight of three Spitfire fighter aircraft was being delivered by ATA pilots, including one woman, Ann Wood, from their factory in Castle Bromwich to Whitchurch, Bristol. As it was low tide, the lead pilot Johnnie Jordan flew under the bridge. Some time later, Ann Wood repeated this underflying – without realising that this time it was high tide and there was less headroom but she just squeezed through. These were not the only instances of pilots buzzing the bridge, and on one occasion a Vickers Wellington bomber, a much larger aircraft, was seen to fly under it. The practice became so common that RAF police were called in and tasked with the recording of serial numbers of offending aircraft. After a few courts-martial the incidents ceased.

==Railway operation==

Until the Severn Road Bridge was opened in 1966, the Severn Railway Bridge was often referred to simply as the Severn Bridge. There was a small station known as on the Lydney side, adjacent to the Gloucester to Newport Line, which the Severn Bridge Line crossed over. The bridge was used as a diversionary route for passenger services when the Severn Tunnel was closed for engineering work. The south-to-north chord at Berkeley Loop South Junction used for this route was closed when the bridge was abandoned. The remaining line from Berkeley Rd Junction to Sharpness Docks remains and on the north side of the Severn estuary, the line from the former Otters Pool Junction at Lydney to the Severn Bridge has long been lifted but a short section of the track exists as part of the Forest of Dean Railway network.

While the bridge provided a considerably shorter railway route from London to South Wales, its use was limited in that the route was single track, and also because the bridge was only strong enough to carry locomotives up to a 2-6-0. By the early 1960s traffic was restricted to trains serving Lydney, both passenger trains to Berkeley Road and freight to Stoke Gifford, with GWR 1600 Class locomotives typically heading the trains.

There were plans by British Railways to improve the bridge in order to provide additional capacity for diverted main line trains.

==1960 partial collapse==
On 25 October 1960, in thick fog and a strong tide, two barges (named the &quot;Arkendale H&quot; and &quot;Wastdale H&quot;) which had overshot Sharpness Dock, collided with one of the columns of the bridge after being carried upstream. Two bridge spans collapsed into the river. As they fell, parts of the structure hit the barges causing the fuel oil and petroleum they were carrying to catch fire. Five people died in the incident.

During the collapse of the bridge the diameter gas main that ran alongside the railway line was damaged leaving households across the Forest of Dean without mains gas. Locals who were around at the time talk of people from the gas company banging on the doors early in the morning and being told not to use their gas, and of having to be supplied with bottled gas and compatible appliances for weeks and months until the mains could be restored. Gas engineers from across the UK were brought in to help with visiting every house affected before the household could use the mains gas again.
Local people favoured repairing the bridge as it was an important community link, in particular used by children of Sharpness to travel by train to their school at Lydney on the opposite side; they now had to be taken on a detour via Gloucester. An underwater survey in December 1961 found extensive damage to Pier 16. Rebuilding costs were estimated to be £312,000 (£ million in ) as against dismantling costs of £250,000 (£ million in ). The Western Region of British Railways planned to go ahead with reconstruction but shortly before the work was due to start, a capsized tanker caused further damage to Pier 20, and this same pier was struck again when the contractor&#x27;s crane broke adrift. These incidents added a further £20,000 to the estimated costs of repair, and in 1965, BR decided that the bridge was damaged beyond economic repair and opted for demolition.

==Demolition==

Demolition began in August 1967. The contract was awarded to Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the &quot;Magnus II&quot;, a floating crane with a lifting capacity of , which could remove all but two of the spans. These longer spans were pulled sideways off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.

In May 1968, another firm, Swinnerton &amp; Miller, completed the main demolition work with the help of explosives, but clearing of the debris took another two years.

Evidence of several of the piers remains. The most significant is a large circular tower, sited between the canal and river. This had formed the base of the swinging section and housed the steam engine to power it. A large stone arch also remains on the landward side of the canal, the original abutment to the swinging section. Some piers reduced to their stone foundations and the wrecks of the petrol barges that caused the original damage are visible at low tide. The river at this point has always been hazardous to shipping because of the strong tidal currents, which caused the 1960 collision.

During the demolition, the support vessel &quot;Severn King&quot;, an old Aust Ferry boat that had become surplus after the new Severn road bridge replaced the ferry in 1966, broke its mooring in the tide, grounded on the remains of the bridge and flooded.

A wooden motor barge, the &quot;Halfren&quot; of 1913, was also used in the demolition work, for collecting small pieces of wreckage. Worn out by this work and the frequent groundings, it was abandoned on the shore at Aust.

<text>In computing, a code segment, also known as a text segment or simply as text, is a portion of an object file or the corresponding section of the program&#x27;s virtual address space that contains executable instructions.

==Segment==
The term &quot;segment&quot; comes from the memory segment, which is a historical approach to memory management that has been succeeded by paging. When a program is stored in an object file, the code segment is a part of this file; when the loader places a program into memory so that it may be executed, various memory regions are allocated (in particular, as pages), corresponding to both the segments in the object files and to segments only needed at run time. For example, the code segment of an object file is loaded into a corresponding code segment in memory.

The code segment in memory is typically read-only and has a fixed size, so on embedded systems it can usually be placed in read-only memory (ROM), without the need for loading. If the code segment is not read-only, then the particular architecture allows self-modifying code. Fixed-position or position-independent code may be shared in memory by several processes in segmented or paged memory systems. As a memory region, the code segment may be placed below the heap or stack in order to prevent heap and stack overflows from overwriting it.

<doc id="1067538" wikidata="Q2705075" url="?curid=1067538" title="Cryosurgery">
<text>Cryosurgery (with &quot;cryo&quot; from the Ancient Greek ) is the use of extreme cold in surgery to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue; thus, it is the surgical application of cryoablation.

Cryosurgery has been historically used to treat a number of diseases and disorders, especially a variety of benign and malignant skin conditions.

== History ==
In 1841, English physician James Arnott described therapeutic applications of extremely cold temperatures, namely a mixture of crushed ice and salt applied locally (to skin or mucous membrane). He theorized his technique was capable of &quot;arresting the accompanying inflammation, and perhaps destroying the vitality of the cancer cell.&quot; His works were the first to hypothesize that extreme cold could be used to selectively damage or destroy harmful tissue.

== Uses ==

Warts, moles, skin tags, solar keratoses, molluscum, Morton&#x27;s neuroma and small skin cancers are candidates for cryosurgical treatment. Several internal disorders are also treated with cryosurgery, including liver cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, oral cancers, cervical disorders and, more commonly in the past, hemorrhoids. Soft tissue conditions such as plantar fasciitis (jogger&#x27;s heel) and fibroma (benign excrescence of connective tissue) can be treated with cryosurgery.

Cryosurgery works by taking advantage of the destructive force of freezing temperatures on cells. When their temperature sinks beyond a certain level ice crystals begin forming inside the cells and, because of their lower density, eventually tear apart those cells. Further harm to malignant growth will result once the blood vessels supplying the affected tissue begin to freeze.

Cryosurgery is used to treat a variety of benign skin lesions including:
* Acne
* Dermatofibroma
* Hemangioma
* Keloid (hypertrophic scar)
* Molluscum contagiosum
* Myxoid cyst
* Pyogenic granuloma
* Seborrheic keratoses
* Skin tags
* Warts (including anogenital warts)

Cryosurgery may also be used to treat low risk skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma but a biopsy should be obtained first to confirm the diagnosis, determine the depth of invasion and characterize other high risk histologic features.

== Method ==

===Liquid nitrogen===

A common method of freezing lesions is by using liquid nitrogen as the cryogen. The liquid nitrogen may be applied to lesions using a variety of methods, such as dipping a cotton or synthetic material tipped applicator in liquid nitrogen and then directly applying the cryogen onto the lesion. The liquid nitrogen can also be sprayed onto the lesion using a spray canister. The spray canister may utilize a variety of nozzles for different spray patterns. A cryoprobe, which is a metal applicator that has been cooled using liquid nitrogen, can also be directly applied onto lesions.

=== Carbon dioxide ===
Carbon dioxide is also available as a spray and is used to treat a variety of benign spots. Less frequently, doctors use carbon dioxide &quot;snow&quot; formed into a cylinder or mixed with acetone to form a slush that is applied directly to the treated tissue.

===Argon===
Recent advances in technology have allowed for the use of argon gas to drive ice formation using a principle known as the Joule-Thomson effect. This gives physicians excellent control of the ice and minimizes complications using ultra-thin 17 gauge cryoneedles.

=== Freeze sprays ===
A mixture of dimethyl ether and propane is used in some &quot;freeze spray&quot; preparations such as Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Freeze Away. The mixture is stored in an aerosol spray type container at room temperature and drops to when dispensed. The mixture is often dispensed into a straw with a cotton-tipped swab. Similar products may use tetrafluoroethane or other substances.

== Products ==

;Cryosurgical systems
A number of medical supply companies have developed cryogen delivery systems for cryosurgery. Most are based on the use of liquid nitrogen, although some employ the use of proprietary mixtures of gases that combine to form the cryogen.

==In cancer treatment==
Cryosurgery is also used to treat internal and external tumors as well as tumors in the bone. To cure internal tumors, a hollow instrument called a cryoprobe is used, which is placed in contact with the tumor. Liquid nitrogen or argon gas is passed through the cryoprobe. Ultrasound or MRI is used to guide the cryoprobe and monitor the freezing of the cells. This helps in limiting damage to adjacent healthy tissues. A ball of ice crystals forms around the probe which results in freezing of nearby cells. When it is required to deliver gas to various parts of the tumor, more than one probe is used. After cryosurgery, the frozen tissue is either naturally absorbed by the body in the case of internal tumors, or it dissolves and forms a scab for external tumors.

== Results ==
Cryosurgery is a minimally invasive procedure, and is often preferred to other types of surgery because of its safety, ease of use, minimal pain and scarring as well as low cost; however, as with any medical treatment, there are risks involved, primarily that of damage to nearby healthy tissue. Damage to nerve tissue is of particular concern but is rare.

Cryosurgery cannot be used on lesions that would subsequently require biopsy as the technique destroys tissue and precludes the use of histopathology.

More common complications of cryosurgery include blistering and edema which are transient. Cryosurgery may cause complications due to damage of underlying structures. Destruction of the basement membrane may cause scarring and destruction of hair follicles can cause alopecia or hair loss. Occasionally, hypopigmentation may occur in the area of skin treated with cryosurgery, however, this complication is usually transient and often resolves as melanocytes migrate and repigment the area over several months. Bleeding can also occur, which can be delayed or immediate, due to damage of underlying arteries and arterioles. Tendon rupture and cartillage necrosis can occur, particularly if cryosurgery is done over bony prominences. These complications can be avoided or minimized if freeze times of less than 30 seconds are used during cryosurgery.

Patients undergoing cryosurgery usually experience redness and minor-to-moderate localized pain, which most of the time can be alleviated sufficiently by oral administration of mild analgesics such as ibuprofen, codeine or acetaminophen (paracetamol). Blisters may form as a result of cryosurgery, but these usually scab over and peel away within a few days.

<text>Cleobulus (; , &quot;Kleoboulos ho Lindios&quot;; fl. 6th century BC) was a Greek poet and a native of Lindos. He is one of the Seven Sages of Greece.

==Life==
Cleobulus was the son of Evagoras and a citizen of Lindus in Rhodes. Clement of Alexandria called Cleobulus king of the Lindians, and Plutarch spoke of him as the tyrant. The letter quoted by Diogenes Laërtius, in which Cleobulus invites Solon to Lindus as a democratic place of refuge from the tyrant Peisistratus in Athens, is undoubtedly a later forgery. Cleobulus is also said to have studied philosophy in Egypt. He had a daughter, Cleobulina, who found fame as a poet, composing riddles in hexameter verse. Cleobulus is said to have lived to the age of seventy, and to have been greatly distinguished for strength and beauty of person.

==Extant fragments==
Cleobulus apparently wrote lyric poems, as well as riddles in verse. Diogenes Laërtius also ascribes to him the inscription on the tomb of Midas, of which Homer was considered by others to have been the author:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
I am a brazen maiden lying here
Upon the tomb of Midas. And as long
As water flows, as trees are green with leaves,
As the sun shines and eke the silver moon,
As long as rivers flow, and billows roar,
So long will I upon this much wept tomb,
Tell passers by, &quot;Midas lies buried here.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

The Suda mentions him, and farther down, his daughter Cleobulina. An epigram of his is in the Palatine Anthology (VII, 153), and in another place records two epigrams together as &quot;One of Homer, or of Cleobulus&quot;, without specifying which is the latter&#x27;s. French scholar Pierre Waltz analyzed the problem in the &quot;Anthologie Grecque&quot; Likewise an is attributed to him is recorded in the Palatine Anthology (XIV).

Many sayings were attributed to Cleobulus:
*&quot;Ignorance and talkativeness bear the chief sway among men.&quot;
*&quot;Cherish not a thought.&quot;
*&quot;Do not be , or ungrateful.&quot;
*&quot;Be fond of hearing rather than of talking.&quot;
*&quot;Be fond of learning rather than unwilling to learn.&quot;
*&quot;Seek virtue and eschew vice.&quot;
*&quot;Be superior to pleasure.&quot;
*&quot;Instruct one&#x27;s children.&quot;
*&quot;Be ready for reconciliation after quarrels.&quot;
*&quot;Avoid injustice.&quot;
*&quot;Do nothing by force.&quot;
*&quot;Moderation is the best thing.&quot;

==Legacy==
There is a stone tumulus on the northern headland of Lindos bay, which is sometimes called the &quot;Tomb of Cleobulus&quot;.

An asteroid, 4503 Cleobulus, discovered in 1989, is named for him.

<doc id="1067550" wikidata="Q772950" url="?curid=1067550" title="Superantigen">
<text>Superantigens (SAgs) are a class of antigens that result in excessive activation of the immune system. Specifically they cause non-specific activation of T-cells resulting in polyclonal T cell activation and massive cytokine release. Superantigens act by binding to the MHC proteins on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and to the TCRs on their adjacent helper T-cells, bringing the signaling molecules together, and thus leading to the activation of the T-cells, regardless of the peptide displayed on the MHC molecule. SAgs are produced by some pathogenic viruses and bacteria most likely as a defense mechanism against the immune system. Compared to a normal antigen-induced T-cell response where 0.0001–0.001% of the body&#x27;s T-cells are activated, these SAgs are capable of activating up to 20% of the body&#x27;s T-cells. Furthermore, Anti-CD3 and Anti-CD28 antibodies (CD28-SuperMAB) have also shown to be highly potent superantigens (and can activate up to 100% of T cells).

The large number of activated T-cells generates a massive immune response which is not specific to any particular epitope on the SAg thus undermining one of the fundamental strengths of the adaptive immune system, that is, its ability to target antigens with high specificity. More importantly, the large number of activated T-cells secrete large amounts of cytokines, the most important of which is Interferon gamma. This excess amount of IFN-gamma in turn activates the macrophages. The activated macrophages, in turn, over-produce proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha is particularly important as a part of the body&#x27;s inflammatory response. In normal circumstances it is released locally in low levels and helps the immune system defeat pathogens. However, when it is systemically released in the blood and in high levels (due to mass T-cell activation resulting from the SAg binding), it can cause severe and life-threatening symptoms, including septic shock and multiple organ failure.

== Structure ==
SAgs are produced intracellularly by bacteria and are released upon infection as extracellular mature toxins.

The sequences of these bacterial toxins are relatively conserved among the different subgroups. More important than sequence homology, the 3D structure is very similar among different SAgs resulting in similar functional effects among different groups. There are at least 5 groups of superantigens with different binding preferences.

Crystal structures of the enterotoxins reveals that they are compact, ellipsoidal proteins sharing a characteristic two-domain folding pattern comprising an NH2-terminal β barrel globular domain known as the oligosaccharide / oligonucleotide fold, a long α-helix that diagonally spans the center of the molecule, and a COOH-terminal globular domain.

The domains have binding regions for the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) and the T-cell receptor (TCR), respectively. By bridging these two together, the SAg causes nonspecific activation.

== Binding ==
Superantigens bind first to the MHC class II and then coordinate to the variable alpha- or beta chain of T-cell Receptors (TCR)

===MHC Class II===
SAgs show preference for the HLA-DQ form of the molecule. Binding to the α-chain puts the SAg in the appropriate position to coordinate to the TCR.

Less commonly, SAgs attach to the polymorphic MHC class II β-chain in an interaction mediated by a zinc ion coordination complex between three SAg residues and a highly conserved region of the HLA-DR β chain. The use of a zinc ion in binding leads to a higher affinity interaction. Several staphylococcal SAgs are capable of cross-linking MHC molecules by binding to both the α and β chains. This mechanism stimulates cytokine expression and release in antigen presenting cells as well as inducing the production of costimulatory molecules that allow the cell to bind to and activate T cells more effectively.

===T-cell receptor===
T-cell binding region of the SAg interacts with the Variable region on the Beta chain (Vβ region) of the T-cell Receptor. A given SAg can activate a large proportion of the T-cell population because the human T-cell repertoire comprises only about 50 types of Vβ elements and some SAgs are capable of binding to multiple types of Vβ regions. This interaction varies slightly among the different groups of SAgs. Variability among different people in the types of T-cell regions that are prevalent explains why some people respond more strongly to certain SAgs. Group I SAgs contact the Vβ at the CDR2 and framework region of the molecule. SAgs of Group II interact with the Vβ region using mechanisms that are conformation-dependent. These interactions are for the most part independent of specific Vβ amino acid side-chains. Group IV SAgs have been shown to engage all three CDR loops of certain Vβ forms. The interaction takes place in a cleft between the small and large domains of the SAg and allows the SAg to act as a wedge between the TCR and MHC. This displaces the antigenic peptide away from the TCR and circumvents the normal mechanism for T-cell activation.

The biological strength of the SAg (its ability to stimulate) is determined by its affinity for the TCR. SAgs with the highest affinity for the TCR elicit the strongest response. SPMEZ-2 is the most potent SAg discovered to date.

== T-cell signaling ==
The SAg cross-links the MHC and the TCR inducing a signaling pathway that results in the proliferation of the cell and production of cytokines. This occurs because a cognate antigen activates a T cell not because of its structure &quot;per se&quot;, but because its affinity allows it to bind the TCR for a lengthy enough time period, and the SAg mimics this temporal bonding. Low levels of Zap-70 have been found in T-cells activated by SAgs, indicating that the normal signaling pathway of T-cell activation is impaired.

It is hypothesized that Fyn rather than Lck is activated by a tyrosine kinase, leading to the adaptive induction of anergy.

Both the protein kinase C pathway and the protein tyrosine kinase pathways are activated, resulting in upregulating production of proinflammatory cytokines.

This alternative signaling pathway impairs the calcium/calcineurin and Ras/MAPkinase pathways slightly, but allows for a focused inflammatory response.

== Effects ==

=== Direct effects ===
SAg stimulation of antigen presenting cells and T-cells elicits a response that is mainly inflammatory, focused on the action of Th1 T-helper cells. Some of the major products are IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α), MIP-1β, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1).

This excessive uncoordinated release of cytokines, (especially TNF-α), overloads the body and results in rashes, fever, and can lead to multi-organ failure, coma and death.

Deletion or anergy of activated T-cells follows infection. This results from production of IL-4 and IL-10 from prolonged exposure to the toxin. The IL-4 and IL-10 downregulate production of IFN-gamma, MHC Class II, and costimulatory molecules on the surface of APCs. These effects produce memory cells that are unresponsive to antigen stimulation.

One mechanism by which this is possible involves cytokine-mediated suppression of T-cells. MHC crosslinking also activates a signaling pathway that suppresses hematopoiesis and upregulates Fas-mediated apoptosis.

IFN-α is another product of prolonged SAg exposure. This cytokine is closely linked with induction of autoimmunity, and the autoimmune disease Kawasaki disease is known to be caused by SAg infection.

SAg activation in T-cells leads to production of CD40 ligand which activates isotype switching in B cells to IgG and IgM and IgE.

To summarize, the T-cells are stimulated and produce excess amounts of cytokine resulting in cytokine-mediated suppression of T-cells and deletion of the activated cells as the body returns to homeostasis. The toxic effects of the microbe and SAg also damage tissue and organ systems, a condition known as toxic shock syndrome.

If the initial inflammation is survived, the host cells become anergic or are deleted, resulting in a severely compromised immune system.

=== Superantigenicity-independent (indirect) effects ===
Apart from their mitogenic activity, SAgs are able to cause symptoms that are characteristic of infection.

One such effect is vomiting. This effect is felt in cases of food poisoning, when SAg-producing bacteria release the toxin, which is highly resistant to heat. There is a distinct region of the molecule that is active in inducing gastrointestinal toxicity. This activity is also highly potent, and quantities as small as 20-35 μg of SAg are able to induce vomiting.

SAgs are able to stimulate recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection in a way that is independent of T-cell stimulation. This effect is due to the ability of SAgs to activate monocytic cells, stimulating the release of the cytokine TNF-α, leading to increased expression of adhesion molecules that recruit leukocytes to infected regions. This causes inflammation in the lungs, intestinal tissue, and any place that the bacteria have colonized. While small amounts of inflammation are natural and helpful, excessive inflammation can lead to tissue destruction.

One of the more dangerous indirect effects of SAg infection concerns the ability of SAgs to augment the effects of endotoxins in the body. This is accomplished by reducing the threshold for endotoxicity. Schlievert demonstrated that, when administered conjunctively, the effects of SAg and endotoxin are magnified as much as 50,000 times. This could be due to the reduced immune system efficiency induced by SAg infection. Aside from the synergistic relationship between endotoxin and SAg, the “double hit” effect of the activity of the endotoxin and the SAg result in effects more deleterious that those seen in a typical bacterial infection. This also implicates SAgs in the progression of sepsis in patients with bacterial infections.

== Diseases associated with superantigen production==

* Diabetes mellitus
* Eczema
* Guttate psoriasis
* Kawasaki disease
* Nasal polyps
* Rheumatic fever
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Scarlet fever
* Toxic shock syndrome
* Infective endocarditis

== Treatment ==
The primary goals of medical treatment are to hemodynamically stabilize the patient and, if present, to eliminate the microbe that is producing the SAgs. This is accomplished through the use of vasopressors, fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.

The body naturally produces antibodies to some SAgs, and this effect can be augmented by stimulating B-cell production of these antibodies.

Immunoglobulin pools are able to neutralize specific antibodies and prevent T-cell activation. Synthetic antibodies and peptides have been created to mimic SAg-binding regions on the MHC class II, blocking the interaction and preventing T cell activation.

Immunosuppressants are also employed to prevent T-cell activation and the release of cytokines. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammatory effects.

== Evolution of superantigen production ==
SAg production effectively corrupts the immune response, allowing the microbe secreting the SAg to be carried and transmitted unchecked. One mechanism by which this is done is through inducing anergy of the T-cells to antigens and SAgs. Lussow and MacDonald demonstrated this by systematically exposing animals to a streptococcal antigen. They found that exposure to other antigens after SAg infection failed to elicit an immune response. In another experiment, Watson and Lee discovered that memory T-cells created by normal antigen stimulation were anergic to SAg stimulation and that memory T-cells created after a SAg infection were anergic to all antigen stimulation. The mechanism by which this occurred was undetermined. The genes that regulate SAg expression also regulate mechanisms of immune evasion such as M protein and Bacterial capsule expression, supporting the hypothesis that SAg production evolved primarily as a mechanism of immune evasion.

When the structure of individual SAg domains has been compared to other immunoglobulin-binding streptococcal proteins (such as those toxins produced by &quot;E. coli&quot;) it was found that the domains separately resemble members of these families. This homology suggests that the SAgs evolved through the recombination of two smaller β-strand motifs.

&quot;Staphylococcal Superantigen-Like&quot; (SSL) toxins are a group of secreted proteins structurally similar to SAgs. Instead of binding to MHC and TCR, they target diverse components of innate immunity such as complement, Fc receptors, and myeloid cells. One way SSL targets myeloid cells is by binding the siallylactosamine glycan on surface glycoproteins. In 2017, a superantigen was found to also have a glycan-binding ability.

== Endogenous and viral SAgs ==
Minor lymphocyte stimulating (Mls; ) exotoxins were originally discovered in the thymic stromal cells of mice. These toxins are encoded by SAg genes that were incorporated into the mouse genome from the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV). The presence of these genes in the mouse genome allows the mouse to express the antigen in the thymus as a means of negatively selecting for lymphocytes with a variable Beta region that is susceptible to stimulation by the viral SAg. The result is that these mice are immune to infection by the virus later in life.

Similar endogenous SAg-dependent selection has yet to be identified in the human genome, but endogenous SAgs have been discovered and are suspected of playing an integral role in viral infection. Infection by the Epstein–Barr virus, for example, is known to cause production of a SAg in infected cells, yet no gene for the toxin has been found on the genome of the virus. The virus manipulates the infected cell to express its own SAg genes, and this helps it to evade the host immune system. Similar results have been found with rabies, cytomegalovirus, and HIV. In 2001, it was found that EBV actually transactivates a superantigen encoded by the &quot;env&quot; gene () of HERV-K18. In 2006, it was found that EBV does so by docking to CD2.

The two viral superantigens have no homology to aforementioned bacterial superantigens, nor are they homologous to each other.

<doc id="1067552" wikidata="Q1011880" url="?curid=1067552" title="Evil twin">
<text>The evil twin is an antagonist found in many different fictional genres. The twin is physically nearly identical to the protagonist, but with a radically inverted morality. In films, they may have a symbolic physical difference from the protagonist—such as a goatee, eyepatch, scar, distinctive clothing, or a more muscular build—which makes it easy for the audience to visually identify the two characters. Sometimes, however, the physical differences between the characters will be minimized, so as to confuse the audience. Both roles are almost always played by either the same actor or the actor&#x27;s actual twin (if the actor has one).

Though there may be moral disparity between actual biological twins, the term is more often used figuratively: the two look-alikes are not actually twins, but physical duplicates produced by other phenomena (e.g. alternate universes). In other cases, the so-called &quot;evil&quot; twin is a dual opposite to their &quot;good&quot; counterpart, possessing at least some commonality with the value system of the protagonist.

==Origins==
=== Mythologic precursors ===

The concept of evil twins is ancient and mythical. One of the earliest may be in the Zurvanite branch of Zoroastrianism. This sect distilled the general abstract duality of Zoroastrianism into a concept of manifest twins &quot;born&quot; of a monist (first) principle &quot;Zurvan&quot; (Time). In this cosmological model, the twins—Ahura Mazda (Ormuzd) and Angra Mainyu (Ahriman)—were co-eternal representatives of good and evil. Ahura Mazda, representing good, was eventually expected to win the battle. The doctrinal foundation of Zurvanism lies in its interpretation of the Zoroastrian precepts of Free Will: Like Mazdaism (the other, and still extant branch of Zoroastrianism), Zurvanism emphasized that mortals always &quot;have a choice between good and evil, and that one is always free to make the choice one way or the other.&quot; Zurvanism took this one step further and considered Angra Mainyu &quot;evil&quot; by choice, rather than by nature. This characterization is important to modern uses of the &quot;evil twin&quot;, as most examples are in fact opposites of their &quot;good twin&quot;, rather than wholly evil.

Amongst the Mandika of southern Mali, the origin of the world is also attributed to twins, albeit fraternal ones. According to this legend, Mangala, or God, twice tried to create the world with seeds. The first attempt failed because he had but one seed. On his second attempt, Mangala used four sets of twin seeds. This experiment was more satisfactory, and soon a universe was growing within a cosmic egg. Ultimately, however, one of the male twins, Pemba, grew tired of being confined. In attempting to escape, he proved himself treacherous. The rip he caused in the cosmic egg begat the Earth. It also compelled Mangala to seek a sacrifice of atonement. For this, Mangala killed Pemba&#x27;s innocent fraternal twin, Faro. When Faro&#x27;s remains were scattered on the newly formed Earth, fertile land was formed. Thus the Earth as we know it is the result of the treason of the evil twin and the sacrifice of the good one.

Many Native American creation myths likewise provide for the role of dualistic twins.

===Early fictional appearances===
====Literature====
In literature, &quot;Beowulf&quot; has been cited as an early example of the evil twin story. Although it does not feature biological twins or even characters that seem to have similar appearances, the precise parallel language suggests that the monsters are evil reflections of the hero.

====Film====
A notable early use of the modern concept of evil twins in film is 1939&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot;. This adaptation of a part of the novel &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot; by Alexandre Dumas made a key change to the source material by suggesting that the plot&#x27;s central twins were in fact opposites of each other. Louis XIV is portrayed as the evil twin of Philippe, a boy raised by d&#x27;Artagnan and The Three Musketeers. The movie contains many of the common tropes of the evil twin plot, such as the fact that Phillippe is unaware of his twin&#x27;s existence, differences in upbringing being important to the twins&#x27; adult temperaments, facial hair as a way for the audience to distinguish between the twins, one twin impersonating the other, and the eventual triumph of the good twin.

Evil twins were also staples of serial films. They were crucial plot devices in the initial 1937 &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; storyline and the 1941 &quot;Jungle Girl serial&quot;. In the 1937 serial, Gordon Tracy was introduced as Dick&#x27;s twin brother. Gordon underwent an evil scientist&#x27;s procedure which rendered him evil and physically transformed. For the majority of the story he and Dick were played by different actors, but it is understood that he was intended as a twin. In the case of Jungle Girl, it is not the titular character who has the twin, but her father. She is raised in the wilds of Africa, according to the narrative, because her uncle drives her father into exile there when she is a young girl. Later, after she has grown into a young woman, she stops her uncle&#x27;s plan to illegally remove diamonds from the continent.

However, just as in the modern era, early film usages were not confined to action-adventure stories. Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; was a 1940 comedic evil twin story that worked on two levels. In the narrative itself, Chaplin played both a good, simple barber and his evil counterpart, a Hitler-esque dictator. But it was also born of the notion that Chaplin himself actually looked like Hitler. As a modern reviewer has noted: 

====Comic books====
Comic books contain some other early appearances of evil twins. One example, still available on the market today, is &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; by Hergé which originally was published in 1938–39. Tintin is hired as Professor Alembick&#x27;s secretary and flies with him to Syldavia. The real Alembick has been abducted in the beginning of the story, and unknown to Tintin replaced by an antagonist, in a plan to steal the sceptre. In the end of the story Tintin understands the impostor was the evil twin of the professor.

Another example is found in September 1948&#x27;s &quot;Kid Eternity&quot; #11. The final story in the work revolves around &quot;Handsome Harry&quot;, the evil twin of Kid Eternity&#x27;s mentor, Mr. Keeper. Handsome Harry is the archetypal evil twin in that he is both evil and a biological twin.

The concept was brought to the more iconic superhero, Superman, about a decade later. 1958&#x27;s Bizarro was at first Superboy&#x27;s evil twin. This twin was easily distinguishable both in deformed physical appearance and manner of speech. Bizarro, more anti-Superman than evil, nevertheless &quot;represented Superman&#x27;s Jungian shadow, his dark side&quot;. In DC Comics, evil doppelgangers of various superheroes reside on Earth-Three, such as Superman and Batman&#x27;s evil counterparts, Ultraman and Owlman, respectively.

Although the &quot;Kid Eternity&quot; story has had the term retroactively applied to it, none of these examples originally used words &quot;evil twin&quot; explicitly. 1968&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #175 is thus important for being an early case of the term appearing on a comic cover.

====Television====
While evil twins are inextricably linked to the soap opera (one particularly long-running &quot;evil twin&quot; soap opera storyline was on &quot;All My Children&quot;, where David Canary played evil twin Adam Chandler and good twin Stuart Chandler for nearly 30 years), they have appeared in most televised genres. Some of the earliest usages were in fact in westerns. Two episodes entitled &quot;Deadly Image&quot; appeared within a year of each other on two different westerns. &quot;Maverick&#x27;s&quot; version appeared in March 1961, followed swiftly by &quot;The Rifleman&#x27;s&quot; take in February 1962. Beyond the coincidence of name, both offered similar plots: the hero becomes confused with a look-alike criminal, and the guilt of the hero must be cleared by demonstrating that the evil twin is a separate individual. In the Disney Cartoon series Aladdin it is implied that the evil wizard Mozenrath is Aladdin Evil twin.

==Tropes==
The evil twin has now been used with great enough frequency to become viewed with cynicism as a hackneyed concept. As the character of Kate Austen remarked in a deleted scene from &quot;Lost&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s not a soap opera until somebody&#x27;s evil twin shows up.&quot; However, within the concept of the evil twin there are characteristics which are themselves tropes.
===The goatee===
The biggest of these distinguishing traits is the goatee. Famously used by the &quot;Mirror Universe&quot; version of &quot;Star Trek&quot; character Spock, in the episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, it was an easy way for audiences to tell &quot;good&quot; Spock from &quot;evil&quot; Spock (the character, while more ruthlessly logical than his counterpart, is far from evil). The presence of a goatee on a familiar character is now seen as an immediate clue that the character is an evil twin. Even writers not discussing evil twins in their literary sense have occasionally made reference to the goatee through quick metaphor: 

The Evil Overlord List refers to it with Item 35: &quot;I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look diabolic. Now they just make you look like a disaffected member of Generation X.&quot;

==General usage==
===Type of doppelgänger===

In modern use, &quot;evil twin&quot; and one sense of the word &quot;doppelgänger&quot; have come to be virtually interchangeable. While &quot;evil twin&quot; does not connote the sense of &quot;supernatural harbinger of death&quot;, it can be used to mean &quot;a physical copy of one&#x27;s self who has an altered morality&quot;.
===As metaphor===
The term &quot;evil twin&quot; has also passed into general usage in a variety of different contexts. In computer technology, it describes a faked wireless access point designed to appear like a genuine one, for the purpose of phishing information from unsuspecting users. The term is further used in contemporary journalism and non-fiction as a convenient label. In astronomy, Venus is often called Earth&#x27;s &quot;evil twin&quot;, in reference to the similarity, yet opposition, of the two bodies. It is also a commonly asked question twins get and there are various view points on this.

<text>Vaginal photoplethysmography (VPG, VPP) is a technique using light to measure the amount of blood in the walls of the vagina. The device that is used is called a vaginal photometer.

==Use==
The device is used to try to obtain an objective measure of a woman&#x27;s sexual arousal. There is an overall poor correlation (r = 0.26) between women&#x27;s self-reported levels of desire and their VPG readings.

==Instrument==
The instrument used in the procedure is called vaginal photometer. The device has a clear shell, inside of which is a light source and a photocell, which senses reflected light. The use of the device is done with the assumption that the more light that is scattered back, and that the photocell senses, the more blood is in the walls of the vagina.

The output of the VPG can be filtered into two types of signals, which have different properties. The direct current signal is a measure of vaginal blood volume (VBV) and reflects the total blood volume in the vaginal tissues. The alternating current signal is a measure of vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) and reflects the pressure change within the blood vessels of the vaginal wall associated with each heartbeat. While changes in VBV occur in response to sexual and anxiety-inducing stimuli, changes in VPA only occur in response to sexual stimuli.

VPA is defined as the peak-to-trough amplitude of the vaginal pulse wave. It is calculated by subtracting the means of all troughs from the means of all peaks experienced during stimulus presentation. VPA lacks an absolute scale of measurement; each unit of change (mV) does not correspond directly with a physiological change. Since VPA does not have a standard unit of measurement, it is difficult for researchers to make between-participant comparisons.

==History==
VPG was first introduced in the 1960s by Palti and Bercovici, who affixed a light source and photosensitive cell onto a gynecological speculum and recorded vaginal pulse waves. Sintchak and Geer improved on the device in the 1970s by using a vaginal probe which became the common instrument to measure vaginal blood flow.

<doc id="1067558" wikidata="Q4975563" url="?curid=1067558" title="Brother Stair">
<text>Ralph Gordon Stair (May 3, 1933 – April 3, 2021), also known as Brother R. G. Stair, or simply as Brother Stair, was an American minister and evangelist. He broadcast his preaching on digital and shortwave radio. In the 1990s, at the peak of his radio ministry, Stair was heard on 120 stations.

Stair founded Overcomer Ministry in 1978, declaring himself a prophet. He lived in a community with his followers at a compound in Walterboro, South Carolina. Over the years, Stair was involved in a number of controversies, including convictions for sexual abuse, allegations that he caused infant deaths, and allegations that his ministry is a cult.

==Early life==
Stair was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He was ordained as a Methodist minister, but he later left organized religion, stating &quot;I just call myself a Christian.&quot; He moved to the Southern United States in the 1950s, saying that God told him to move there because it would be &quot;the safest place for Christians in the end time.&quot;

==Overcomer Ministry==
Stair led the Overcomer Ministry, officially incorporated as the Faith Cathedral Fellowship, a conservative Pentecostal Christian organization which runs a widely heard radio-based ministry. Stair purchased a motel in Walterboro, South Carolina in 1978, and encouraged followers to move to the community, sell all their possessions, take a vow of poverty, and donate all that they owned to Overcomer Ministry.

The community of about 70 strives for self-sufficiency and simplicity, growing their own food and making their own clothes. Community members live in mobile homes and handmade houses, eating communal meals and gathering for Saturday worship in the Tabernacle. They dress conservatively. Women wear long skirts and men wear long pants and shirts with collars. Typically, work is divided along traditional gender lines, with men performing farm/manual labor and women doing domestic chores. Members primarily rely on bicycles for transportation within the community.

Stair objected to medical intervention, and taught avoidance of doctors. Commune members typically followed Stair&#x27;s teaching, and in the 1980s and 1990s, local authorities conducted investigations after three infants died at the community either during or shortly after birth.

Evangelism was the primary focus of Stair&#x27;s ministry. He broadcast from a solar-powered radio studio which is based in the community, often for hours at a time. As of 2014, Stair leased airtime globally on five free-to-air satellites (Galaxy 19, Hot Bird 8, Optus D2, Thaicom 5, and Eutelsat 25B) and on seven international shortwave radio stations (WHRI, WWRB, WTWW, WWCR, WBCQ, WRMI, and Media Broadcast GmbH) to convey his message to listeners in the United States as well as listeners in locations as far-flung as South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Israel, Russia, and India.

In addition to international satellite and shortwave, Stair broadcast worldwide via internet streaming from his ministry&#x27;s web site. He also leased time on terrestrial AM and FM radio stations throughout the United States, some of which are large-coverage stations. In the 1990s, Brother Stair was heard on 120 such stations, though by 2007 and continuing through 2014, that total had been reduced to approximately 25.

In 2016, however, the broadcast was dramatically increased due to a large contribution which allowed Brother Stair to purchase hundreds of hours per day of broadcasting time to create one of the most extensive shortwave broadcasts in history. Broadcast expenditures of about $1.5 million are funded by donations from listeners. In 1993 and 1994, Stair and his ministry were partners in a failed ship-based radio project due to authorities raiding and confiscating both the ship and its equipment before it could set sail to international waters.

Stair&#x27;s teachings place a strong emphasis on millennial predictions of world-changing events which will result from divine judgment. In the year 1999, he said that there would be such changes at the dawn of the third millennium. &quot;If the Lord God Almighty does not make a major move before the year 2000,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell God to go to Hell.&quot; Stair also has received publicity over the years for several of his prophecies, including a nuclear confrontation prophesied for 1988, and that Ronald Reagan would not complete his term as president.

==Criminal cases==
While hosting a revival in Muskogee, Oklahoma, Stair was arrested in late December 1963 on charges of outraging public decency, including using obscene language and actions in front of a minor.

Stair, then aged 69, was arrested in Walterboro on May 16, 2002, on two counts of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree; two women associated with Brother Stair, ages 17 and 20, alleged he coerced them by &quot;enforcing his religious/personal beliefs&quot; on them. In 2004, Stair pleaded guilty to the charge of assault and battery and was sentenced to time served, a total of 77 days in custody.

During his incarceration, recorded programs continued to be broadcast. Stair&#x27;s conviction caused division in the community. However, about 70 residents remained loyal to him and there are two small branch communities which are part of his ministry.

On December 18, 2017, Stair was arrested on eight counts, which include three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and single counts of assault with the intent to commit criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, second-degree assault, first-degree burglary, and third-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor. Stair came to the attention of authorities because of YouTube videos showing him touching a 12-year-old girl&#x27;s breast during service and then saying, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna touch them things till nobody else can touch them.&quot;

Another video showed a 16-year-old girl accusing him of sexually assaulting her over a five-month period. Four women described assaults including groping and rape. Stair reportedly told the women that the acts were &quot;God&#x27;s will&quot;. He was released on a $750,000 bond a month later on condition he not leave the property and was electronically monitored. Stair later admitted to the touching allegations during production of a documentary about Craig Mack, a musician that joined Stair&#x27;s commune in 2011 and died in 2018.

On January 1, 2018, the Overcomer Ministry ceased broadcasting its show on radio stations as a result of what it called &#x27;legal difficulties&#x27;. Currently, the Overcomer Ministry continues to stream its show on its website, and it also continues to broadcast its show on satellite radio stations. As of November 2020, the station can also be heard on the 7.49 MHz shortwave station WBCQ.

==Death==
Stair died of heart failure at the age of 87 on April 3, 2021, at his home in Canadys, South Carolina.

Carina Lau Kar-ling (; born 8 December 1965) is a Hong Kong actress and singer. She started her acting career at TVB, before achieving success with her girl-next-door roles in the 1980s&#x27; Hong Kong films. She also plays Empress Wu Zetian in Tsui Hark&#x27;s &quot;Detective Dee&quot; films, starting with &quot;Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame&quot; in 2010. She won Best Actress at the Nantes Three Continents Festival for &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; (1990), at the Golden Rooster Awards for &quot;Curiosity Kills the Cat&quot; (2006), and at the Hong Kong Film Awards for &quot;Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame&quot; (2011).

==Early life==
Lau was born on 1965 in Suzhou, Jiangsu, with her ancestral home in Rong County, Guangxi, to Liu Guiming (1940–2006) and Wang Fumei (born 1944).

Her grandfather, Liu Ji, moved to Thailand in 1935 to make a living and later moved to the country with his wife in 1938, just before the Canton Operation during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Lau&#x27;s father, Liu Guiming, was born in Thailand on 1940. Lau&#x27;s father returned to China in 1955 and with the help of All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, he studied at a junior high school in Guangzhou and high school in Suzhou. Following the start of Cultural Revolution in 1965, overseas Chinese who returned to China were targets of criticism. Lau&#x27;s father moved to Hong Kong in 1976, while Lau moved to Hong Kong with her mother and brother in 1978, and joined TVB&#x27;s acting class in 1983.

==Career==
Lau made her on-screen debut in TVB&#x27;s &quot;The Clones&quot; (1984) where she starred opposite of her future husband, Tony Leung. She gained wider recognition after a series of appearances in successful drama series such as &quot;The Duke of Mount Deer&quot; and &quot;Police Cadet&quot; and skyrocketed to fame following her role as a wealthy heiress in one of Hong Kong&#x27;s most-watched ever series, &quot;Looking Back in Anger&quot; (1989).

Lau then expanded to films. She was nominated at the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actress for her role in &quot;Her Beautiful Life Lies&quot; (1989). She received acclaim for her role in &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; (1991), one of her many collaborations with film director Wong Kar-wai. She continued to showcase her versatility with impressive performances in the martial arts epic &quot;Saviour of the Soul&quot; (1991), the biopic &quot;Center Stage&quot; (1991), the cross-dressing comedy &quot;He&#x27;s a Woman, She&#x27;s a Man&quot; (1994), and the offbeat romance &quot;Gigolo and Whore&quot; (1994). Following parts in the wuxia classic &quot;Ashes of Time&quot; (1994) and James Bond pastiche &quot;Forbidden City Cop&quot; (1997), Lau once again attracted the attention of various awards juries with her measured portrayals of bisexual silk factory owner Wan in &quot;Intimates&quot; (1997) and a prostitute in the 19th-century epic &quot;Flowers of Shanghai&quot; (1998).

Her roles as Hon Sam&#x27;s wife in the two &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; sequels and an android in Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;2046&quot; (2004) further increased Lau&#x27;s international recognition. Lau then stepped in the shoes of Sarah Jessica Parker for the Hong Kong version of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, named &quot;Sex and the Beauties&quot; (2004). She won rave reviews for her performances as unhappily-married Rose in the low-budget thriller &quot;Curiosity Kills the Cat&quot; (2006) and as Wu Zetian in the blockbuster &quot;Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame&quot; (2010), which earned her a Golden Rooster Award for Best Actress and a Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actress, respectively. She reprised her role as Wu Zetian in two &quot;Detective Dee&quot; prequels. She received a Best Actress nomination at the Cannes Film Festival for her role as a rich housewife abandoned by her husband in &quot;Bends&quot; (2013).

In 2016, Lau was one of the celebrities that appeared on the Chinese reality show &quot;Up Idol&quot;. Since then, she has made guest appearances in other mainland reality TV shows. In June 2017, she and her husband were invited to become a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2021, she hosted &quot;Reflection,&quot; a short web series interviewing various female celebrities.

In 2024, she hosted the Jiangsu TV talk show &quot;Jia Ren Zi You Yue.&quot;

===Other activities===
She was executive president of Hong Kong&#x27;s TVMART channel, but was replaced by the board after a loss of 40 million Taiwan Dollars. She told the media that because she had no education, the decisions made by her had some negative influences on the company.

==Incidents==
===1990 abduction===
While filming &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; in 1990, Lau disappeared, and Reuters news agency later reported that the actress had been kidnapped, although a police report was not filed. She was safely retrieved after two hours, and in 2008 revealed that she had been abducted by four men working for a triad boss who forced her to strip and took photos of her topless as punishment for refusing a film offer. Lau stated that no sexual assault took place.

===2002 &quot;East Week&quot; magazine photo ===
In October 2002, &quot;East Week&quot; magazine published a nude photo of an &quot;unnamed female star&quot; in visible distress whose face was partially blurred. The public quickly connected the photo to Lau&#x27;s abduction 12 years prior, and Lau confirmed that she was the person in the photo.

Massive protests broke out in the following days, led by various Hong Kong entertainment guilds and citizen groups. Media ethics by Hong Kong tabloids and gossip magazines were questioned. Hong Kong police became involved and &quot;East Week&quot; was forced to shut down a few days later. It eventually restarted in late 2003 under new ownership. In 2009, Mong Hanming, the chief editor of &quot;East Week&quot; at the time of the incident, received a 5-month jail sentence after pleading guilty to publishing obscene photos.

==Personal life==
Lau had a relationship with Hong Kong tycoon Julian Hui from 1986 to 1988. They were engaged and lived together, until Hui announced their split in April 1988. The media characterized their relationship as a failed attempt on Lau&#x27;s part to marry into a wealthy family, but Lau has publicly stated that their breakup was amicable, and she remains friends with Hui and his family.

She has been in a relationship with Tony Leung Chiu-wai since 1989, after working together on a Hong Kong production of &quot;Run For Your Wife&quot;. They married on 21 July 2008, at the COMO Uma Paro hotel in Bhutan. The wedding itself cost more than HK$30 million and Lau&#x27;s Cartier wedding ring is worth over HK$10 million. Guests included singer Faye Wong, who performed for them on their special day. Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai also directed the ceremony. The wedding created a media frenzy in Hong Kong, with companies spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to pursue the wedding party.

There have long been rumours that Leung and actress Maggie Cheung were romantically involved, ever since they starred together in the film &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (2000), which was a hot topic among media outlets in Greater China due to the trio&#x27;s fame. The alleged feud between Lau and Cheung was put to rest in 2013 when Lau uploaded a photo of them together to social media. When asked about the rumored affair, Lau said in a 2016 interview on &quot;The Jin Xing Show&quot; that &quot;it&#x27;s just a beautiful story&quot; and she &quot;knows about the affair as much as the public does&quot;.

<text>Vysoké Mýto (; , also &quot;Hohenmauth&quot;) is a town in Ústí nad Orlicí District in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 12,000 inhabitants. Its town square is the largest example of its type in the country. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Vysoké Mýto consists of ten municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Vysoké Mýto-Město (807)
*Choceňské Předměstí (1,677)
*Litomyšlské Předměstí (6,275)
*Pražské Předměstí (2,706)
*Brteč (98)
*Domoradice (166)
*Knířov (46)
*Lhůta (102)
*Svařeň (85)
*Vanice (107)
==Etymology==
The predecessor of the town was a small settlement by a trade route called &quot;Mýto&quot; (literally &#x27;toll&#x27; in Czech). After a new town was founded, it adopted the privilege of collecting the toll. The old settlement was renamed to &quot;Staré Mýto&quot; (&#x27;old toll&#x27;) and the new town was called &quot;Vysoké Mýto&quot; (&#x27;high toll&#x27;), probably referring to its location above the old settlement.

==Geography==
Vysoké Mýto is located about southeast of Pardubice. It lies in the Svitavy Uplands. The highest point is at above sea level. The Loučná River flows through the town.

==History==
The first written mention of Vysoké Mýto is from 1265. It was founded shortly before this year by King Ottokar II as one of the trading centres on the trade route from Bohemia to Moravia, and was inhabited by German settlers. The town square and the network of streets were built in a regular shape, which is preserved to this day. Stone walls with three gates were gradually built around the whole town.

In the early 14th century, Vysoké Mýto became a dowry town administered by Elizabeth Richeza of Poland. Thanks to its location on a busy mercantile road it soon became rich. During the Hussite Wars, the town was occupied several times. Most of the German population left the town and Czech citizens became the majority. After the wars, it became royal town of King Sigismund, who donated it to his wife Barbara of Cilli and it became again a dowry town.

Vysoké Mýto was devastated by fires between 1461 and 1517. Thanks to its wealth, the town recovered and new buildings were building, including stone houses on the square, the new town hall, and the Church of the Holy Trinity. In the 16th century, the town prospered and crafts developed. Cloth and knives were exported abroad. The prosperity ended with the Thirty Years&#x27; War and several fires in the 18th century.

During the 19th century, new development occurred, and the town became a cultural centre. A Czech-language theatre was established in 1825, the first public library in the region was established in 1839, and the town museum was founded in 1871. At the end of the 19th century, Vysoké Mýto was industrialized and two big engineering and machine-building companies were founded.

Until 1918, Vysoké Mýto was part of Austria-Hungary, head of the district of the same name, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The most important employer in the town is Iveco Czech Republic and its Iveco Bus factory (previously Karosa), which produces buses under the brands Irisbus Crossway, Irisbus Arway and Iveco Urbanway. With more than 3,000 employees, Iveco Czech Republic is the largest industrial company in the Pardubice Region.

==Transport==
The I/35 road (part of the European route E442), which replaces the unfinished section of the D35 motorway from Olomouc to the Hradec Králové Region, passes through the town.

Vysoké Mýto lies on a railway line heading from Litomyšl to Choceň.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s football club is SK Vysoké Mýto. It plays in lower amateur tiers.

==Sights==

The quadrangle square named Přemysla Otakara II. Square is the largest square of its type in the Czech Republic. The Old Town Hall from 1433 is one of the oldest stone buildings in the town. It was rebuilt several times, last in 1828 in the Empire style. Today it houses the tourist information centre, the Town Gallery and an exposition on the manufacture of car bodies. In the middle of the square is a Baroque Marian column from 1714.

The Church of Saint Lawrence is a large cathedral from the second half of the 13th century. It was reconstructed after the fire in the 16th century, and the near Renaissance belfry was erected in 1585. The current appearance of the church is result of purist restoration from the late 19th century. Nowadays the premises of the belfry are used by the Town Gallery.

The Church of the Holy Trinity was built in the Renaissance style with Gothic elements in 1543.

Most of the town fortifications from the 14th century were demolished in the 18th century. Some fragments are preserved to this day, including the Prague Gate and Litomyšl Gate. The tower of the Prague Gate is open to the public as a lookout tower.

The Vysoké Mýto Regional Museum, which was founded in 1871, is the oldest town museum in the country.

<text>Cristóbal Balenciaga Eizaguirre (; ; 21 January 1895 – 23 March 1972) was a Spanish fashion designer, and the founder of the Balenciaga clothing brand. He had a reputation as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as &quot;the master of us all&quot; by Christian Dior and as &quot;the only couturier in the truest sense of the word&quot; by Coco Chanel, who continued, &quot;The others are simply fashion designers&quot;. On the day of his death, in 1972, &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; ran the headline &quot;The King is Dead&quot;.

Since 2011 the purpose-built has exhibited examples of his work in his birth town Getaria. Many of the 1,200 pieces in the collection were supplied by his pupil Hubert de Givenchy and clients such as Grace Kelly.

== Early life ==
Balenciaga was born in the Basque town Getaria (Gipuzkoa), Spain on 21 January 1895. His father, José Balenciaga Basurto, was a fisherman who died when Cristóbal was a boy, and his mother, Martina Eizaguirre Embil, a seamstress. As a child Balenciaga often spent time with his mother as she worked. At the age of twelve, he began work as the apprentice of a tailor. When he was a teenager, the Marchioness de Casa Torres, the foremost noblewoman in his town, became his customer and patron. She sent him to Madrid, where he was formally trained in tailoring.

== Career ==
Balenciaga was successful during his early career as a designer in Spain. He opened a boutique in San Sebastián in 1919, which expanded to include branches in Madrid and Barcelona. The Spanish royal family and the aristocracy wore his designs, but when the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his stores, Balenciaga moved to Paris. He opened his Paris couture house on Avenue George V in August 1937.

However, it was not until the post-war years that the full scale of the inventiveness of his highly original designs became evident. In 1951, he totally transformed the silhouette, broadening the shoulders and removing the waist. In 1955, he designed the tunic dress, which later developed into the chemise dress of 1957. In 1959, his work culminated in the Empire line, with high-waisted dresses and coats cut like kimono.

In 1960 he made the wedding dress for Fabiola de Mora y Aragón when she married King Baudouin of Belgium. He created many designs for socialite Aline Griffith, diplomat Margarita Salaverría Galárraga, and designer Meye Allende de Maier, considering them his muses. He taught fashion design classes, inspiring other designers including Oscar de la Renta, André Courrèges, Emanuel Ungaro, Mila Schön, and Hubert de Givenchy. His often spare, sculptural creations were considered masterworks of &quot;haute couture&quot; in the 1950s and 1960s.

His most famous clients were Mona von Bismarck, Gloria Guinness, Grace Kelly, Ava Gardner, Audrey Hepburn, and Jackie Kennedy.

== Retirement and death ==
Balenciaga retired from the high fashion world in 1968 at the age of 74 after working in Paris for thirty years. First, he decided to retire from active life in May 1968 and, a few months later, on 1 July, the newspapers broke the news of his headquarters in Paris and his studios in Madrid closing. The closing down of his business came by surprise even to his employees. He justified the closing with his habitual clinical brevity: &quot;High fashion is mortally wounded&quot;. On one hand, the intense imposing burden of the French taxes blew through the largest part of the profits and, on the other, Americans stopped buying French high fashion, largely because of General De Gaulle&#x27;s Anti-American politics. Americans had succeeded in signifying close to seventy percent of the Balenciaga clientele.

Balenciaga returned to Spain. He ended his days living in his house in Altea (Alicante), where he enjoyed painting, talking, and eating in the company of some of his Spanish assistants.

As an exception, four years after his retirement, he accepted the job of designing a gown for the wedding of Carmen Martínez-Bordiú, the daughter of one of his most important clients, Carmen Franco y Polo, and hence, the granddaughter of dictator Francisco Franco. Her wedding to Alfonso de Borbón y Dampierre, a grandson of the Spanish king-in-exile, Alfonso XIII, was celebrated on 8 March 1972, Martínez-Bordiu&#x27;s dress being Balenciaga&#x27;s last work.

That same month of March 1972, Balenciaga went to spend a vacation at the Parador of Jávea (Alicante). He was not sick, nor known of any serious ailment, but unexpectedly on 23 March 1972, he suffered a heart attack, followed by heart failure. He was 77 years old at the time of his death. He was buried in the Getaria Cemetery.

== Personal life ==
Balenciaga was gay, although he kept his sexuality private throughout his life. The love of his life and his long time partner was Franco-Polish millionaire Władzio Jaworowski d&#x27;Attainville, who had helped set him up and fund him. When d&#x27;Attainville died in 1948, Balenciaga was so broken he considered closing the business. His next collection after d&#x27;Attainville&#x27;s death was designed entirely in black to mourn his loss.

== Work ==
During the 1950s, designers like Christian Dior, Pierre Balmain, and Coco Chanel emerged, creating pieces very representative to their fashion houses and to their own styles. An important protagonist for this period was Cristóbal Balenciaga. This Spanish fashion designer was known as &quot;The King of Fashion&quot; and &quot;The Master of Us All&quot; and was one of the great masterminds of the period. Balenciaga was born and raised in Spain, where he worked for the Spanish royalty, but because of the Spanish Civil War he moved to Paris where his genius was finally recognized, leading to a domination of the fashion scene.

The most eye-catching designer of this period was Balenciaga because of his structural designs, which had never before been seen in the fashion world. He was a master of construction, and created all of his work without any sketches or illustrations beforehand. This was practically unheard of in his time, and still is to this day. In the age of couture, most all couturiers were mainly proficient in illustration, lacking profound knowledge of the craft. It is said that when designing his garments, he began by feeling the fabric, and only then could he form a design around what would best suit it. Compared to his counterparts, he obtained an edge with his deep understanding and unrelenting precision. &quot;He reshaped women&#x27;s silhouette in the 1950s, so that clothes we think as typical of that decade are mostly dilutions of his work.&quot; (Irvine, 2013) Compared to some work like the New Look from Christian Dior, which featured full skirts and a tiny waist, Balenciaga worked to achieve what was seemingly the opposite. Much of Cristobal&#x27;s work of the mid to later 50s showcased wildly avant garde designs which did not conform to the female body in the same ways; designs like the Sack Dress, which was developed alongside Hubert de Givenchy, the Cocoon Coat, and Babydoll Dress. He blurred the line of contemporary design by dropping waist lines and simplifying seams to achieve elegance in his designs. The one-seam Yoki coat&#x27;s construction showcased this sewing approach; it featured a front and back that include the sleeves in their pattern pieces similar to the construction of a Kimono. He also invented multiple coats under his main line, Balenciaga, and the sister label, Eisa, which featured a back yoke that extended into the under sleeve, and also utilized a similar approach.

== Legacy ==
In the studio of Cristóbal Balenciaga, many couturiers formed, some of which would reach international fame and would get to have their own business. Among these include Paco Rabanne, André Courreges, Emanuel Ungaro, Hubert de Givenchy, or Óscar de la Renta.

=== Balenciaga brand ===

The closing of Balenciaga&#x27;s high fashion house in 1968 did not signify the extinction of &quot;Balenciaga’s brand&quot;. The brand was inactive until 1986 when Jacques Konckier of Jacques Bogart bought the Balenciaga company.

Although separate from the big name of its creator, Balenciaga has actively kept up in the fashion world since then as far as relevance. The reason behind his relevance still today is &quot;his sense of proportion and measurement, and his vision and interpretation of the female body have anointed him as one of the more influential designers of all time&quot;. Balenciaga comprises products of high fashion, ready-to-wear, perfumery, jewels, and other accessories. The Balenciaga business has mainly kept active in the perfumery and accessories spectrum. Balenciaga bags, including the Motorcycle Bag, have been consistently popular. Other objects of desire from the Balenciaga business are their shoes, for their great originality in design.

Today the Balenciaga fashion house continues under the direction of Cedric Charbit and under the ownership of the Kering group.

=== Presence in Museums ===

In Getaria, a foundation was established with the objective of creating a museum dedicated to Cristóbal Balenciaga. After numerous problems and the avoided judicial process about alleged inconsistencies in its management, the was inaugurated by Queen Sofía on 7 June 2011, with the presence of Hubert de Givenchy, who was the honorific president of the foundation. The museum opened on 10 June 2011. It has a collection of more than 1,200 pieces designed by him, some of them donations by disciples, like Givenchy, or clients, like Queen Fabiola – who donated her wedding dress to the foundation – and the heirs of Grace Kelly, although only one part displays simultaneously. The pieces are displayed on invisible mannequins.

The historic collection of the Museum of Textile and Clothing, that is part of the Design Museum of Barcelona, has an extensive number of dresses and accessories designed by Cristóbal Balenciaga, where its hats and headdresses stand out, for their great variety of shapes. The Museum of Garment (Madrid) also has a collection of dresses designed by him. Within these exhibitions and pieces, people can find, like seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum (London), &quot;sculptural silhouettes that the forms of architecture drink from, in the geometric lines of their patterns and also in the set with the volumes that allowed to go without saying as far as unthinkable in 1958, with his babydoll model: inspired in children clothing, the dress left in flotation without pressure to the figure and with total freedom of movement to the user&quot;.

His work has been an object of numerous museum study expositions, starting with an anthology exposition that the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York) provided in 1973, &quot;The World of Balenciaga&quot;, which exhibited for six months, with 180 models on display. Balenciaga&#x27;s garments accompanied the paintings of Goya, Velázquez, El Greco, Zuloaga, Miró or Picasso, in which they had inspired the designs of the Basque couturier. It was the first time that an art museum of the importance of the Metropolitan added dresses to the category of works of art. In Spain, a namesake exposition was also celebrated, which was installed in the noble living rooms of the Palace of Library and National Museums in Madrid.

On 24 March 2011, M. H. de Young Museum (San Francisco) celebrated the opening of &quot;Balenciaga and Spain&quot;, a 120-piece fashion retrospective of his career. &quot;You can&#x27;t even measure it&quot;, said Rodarte designer Laura Mulleavy, of Balenciaga&#x27;s influence. The $2,500-a-ticket fund-raiser for the museum drew 350 guests, including Marissa Mayer, Jamie Tisch, Gwyneth Paltrow, Orlando Bloom, Balthazar Getty, Maggie Rizer, Connie Nielsen, Maria Bello, and Mia Wasikowska.

The Queen Letizia of Spain wears a 1948 black dress and a 1962 fuchsia cape, designed by Balenciaga and owned by the Antoni de Montpalau Foundation, in the portrait made in 2024 by Annie Leibovitz for the Bank of Spain portrait gallery.

=== Cultural depictions ===
His friend, the sculptor Eduardo Chillida, made a sculpture-tribute called &quot;Homage to Balenciaga&quot;. San Sebastián, also pays homage with a promenade, that is situated in the neighborhood of Igeldo, where he had a house.

&quot;Cristóbal Balenciaga&quot; is a Disney+ biographical drama series starring Alberto San Juan in the titular role. Nuno Lopes plays Cristóbal Balenciaga in the Apple TV+ series about Christian Dior, &quot;The New Look&quot;. Javier Rey plays Cristóbal Balenciaga in the Telecinco drama miniseries &quot;Lo que escondían sus ojos&quot;.
